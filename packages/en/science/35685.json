Even to keep abreast of the periodical literature devoted to his\r\nsubject provides ample occupation for the ethnologist and few are those\r\nwho can now lay claim to such an omniscient title.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the faults of omission and compression could\r\nnot be avoided in revising Professor Keane's work, but it is hoped that\r\nthe copious references which form a prominent feature of the present\r\nedition will compensate in some measure for these obvious defects. The\r\nmain object of the revisers has been to retain as much as possible of\r\nthe original text wherever it fairly represents current opinion at the\r\npresent time, but so different is our outlook from that of 1899 that\r\ncertain sections have had to be entirely rewritten and in many places\r\npages have been suppressed to make room for more important information.\r\nIn every case where new matter has been inserted references are given\r\nto the responsible authorities and the fullest use has been made of\r\ndirect quotation from the authors cited.\r\n\r\nMrs Hingston Quiggin is responsible for the whole work of revision with\r\nthe exception of Chapter XI, revised by Miss Lilian Whitehouse, while\r\nDr A. C. Haddon has criticized, corrected and supervised the work\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\n                                                              A. H.

As both points have elsewhere\r\nbeen dealt with by me somewhat fully[1], it will here suffice to show\r\ntheir direct bearing on the general evolution of the human species from\r\nthat remote epoch to the present day.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious that, if man is specifically one, though not\r\nnecessarily sprung of a single pair, he must have had, in homely\r\nlanguage, a single cradle-land, from which the peopling of the earth\r\nwas brought about by migration, not by independent developments from\r\ndifferent species in so many independent geographical areas.\r\n\r\nIt follows further, and this point is all-important, that, since the\r\nworld was peopled by pleistocene man, it was peopled by a generalised\r\nproto-human form, prior to all later racial differences. The existing\r\ngroups, according to this hypothesis, have developed in different areas\r\nindependently and divergently by continuous adaptation to their several\r\nenvironments. If they still constitute mere varieties, and not distinct\r\nspecies, the reason is because all come of like pleistocene ancestry,\r\nwhile the divergences have been confined to relatively narrow limits,\r\nthat is, not wide enough to be regarded zoologically as specific\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nThe battle between monogenists and polygenists cannot be decided until\r\nmore facts are at our disposal, and much will doubtless be said on both\r\nsides for some time to come[2]. Among the views of human origins brought\r\nforward in recent years should be mentioned the daring theory of\r\nKlaatsch[3]. Recognising two distinct human types, Neandertal and\r\nAurignac (see pp. 8, 9 below), and two distinct anthropoid types,\r\ngorilla and orang-utan, he derives Neandertal man and African gorilla\r\nfrom one common ancestor, and Aurignac man and Asiatic orang-utan from\r\nanother. Though anatomists, especially those conversant with anthropoid\r\nstructure[4], are not able to accept this view, they admit that many\r\ndifficulties may be solved by the recognition of more than one\r\nprimordial stock of human ancestors[5]. The questions of adaptation to\r\nclimate and environment[6], the possibilities of degeneracy, the varying\r\ndegrees of physiological activity, of successful mutations, the effects\r\nof crossing and all the complicated problems of heredity are involved in\r\nthe discussion, and it must be acknowledged that our information\r\nconcerning all of these is entirely inadequate.\r\n\r\nNevertheless all speculations on the subject are not based merely on\r\nhypotheses, and three discoveries of late years have provided solid\r\nfacts for the working out of the problem.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries were the remains of _Pithecanthropus erectus_[7] in\r\nJava, in 1892, of the Mauer jaw[8], near Heidelberg, in 1907, and of the\r\nPiltdown skull[9] in Sussex in 1912. Although the Mauer jaw was accepted\r\nwithout hesitation, the controversy concerning the correct\r\ninterpretation of the Javan fossils has been raging for more than twenty\r\nyears and shows no sign of abating, while _Eoanthropus Dawsoni_ is too\r\nrecent an intruder into the arena to be fairly dealt with at present.\r\nCertain facts however stand out clearly. In late pliocene or early\r\npleistocene times certain early ancestral forms were already in\r\nexistence which can scarcely be excluded from the _Hominidae_. In range\r\nthey were as widely distributed as Java in the east to Heidelberg and\r\nSussex in the west, and in spite of divergence in type a certain\r\ncorrelation is not impossible, even if the Piltdown specimen should\r\nfinally be regarded as representing a distinct genus[10]. Each\r\ncontributes facts of the utmost importance for the tracing out of the\r\nhistory of human evolution. _Pithecanthropus_ raises the vexed question\r\nas to whether the erect attitude or brain development came first in the\r\nstory. The conjunction of pre-human braincase with human thighbone\r\nappeared to favour the popular view that the erect attitude was the\r\nearlier, but the evidence of embryology suggests a reverse order. And\r\nalthough at first the thighbone was recognised as distinctly human it\r\nseems that of late doubts have been cast on this interpretation[11], and\r\neven the claim to the title _erectus_ is called in question. The\r\ncharacters of straightness and slenderness on which much stress was laid\r\nare found in exaggerated form in gibbons and lemurs. The intermediate\r\nposition in respect of mental endowment (in so far as brain can be\r\nestimated by cranial capacity) is shown in the accompanying diagram in\r\nwhich the cranial measurements of _Pithecanthropus_ are compared with\r\nthose of a chimpanzee and prehistoric man. The teeth strengthen the\r\nevidence, for they are described as too large for a man and too small\r\nfor an ape. Thus _Pithecanthropus_ has been confidently assigned to a\r\nplace in a branch of the human family tree.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: POSITION OF P. ERECTUS.\r\n  (Manouvrier, _Bul. Soc. d'Anthrop._ 1896, p. 438.)]\r\n\r\nThe Mauer jaw, the geological age of which is undisputed, also\r\nrepresents intermediate characters. The extraordinary strength and\r\nthickness of bone, the wide ascending ramus with shallow sigmoid notch\r\n(distinctly simian features) and the total absence of chin[12] would\r\ndeny it a place among human jaws, but the teeth, which are all\r\nfortunately preserved in their sockets, are not only definitely human,\r\nbut show in certain peculiarities less simian features than are to be\r\nfound in the dentition of modern man[13].\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GENEALOGICAL TREE OF MAN'S ANCESTRY.\r\n  (A. Keith, _The Antiquity of Man_, 1915; fig. 187, p. 501.)]\r\n\r\nThe cranial capacity of the Piltdown skull, though variously\r\nestimated[14], is certainly greater than that of _Pithecanthropus_, the\r\ngeneral outlines with steeply rounded forehead resemble that of modern\r\nman, and the bones are almost without exception typically human. The\r\njaw, however, though usually attributed to the same individual[15],\r\nrecalls the primitive features of the Mauer specimen in its thick\r\nascending portion and shallow notch, while in certain characters it\r\ndiffers from any known jaw, ancient or modern[16]. The evidence afforded\r\nby the teeth is even more striking. The teeth of _Pithecanthropus_ and\r\nof _Homo Heidelbergensis_ were recognised as remarkably human, and\r\nalthough primitive in type, are far more advanced in the line of human\r\nevolution than the lowly features with which they are associated would\r\nlead one to expect. The Piltdown teeth are more primitive in certain\r\ncharacters than those of either the Javan or the Heidelberg remains. The\r\nfirst molar has been compared to that of Taubach, the most ape-like of\r\nhuman or pre-human teeth hitherto recorded, but the canine tooth (found\r\nby P. Teilhard in the same stratum in 1913[17]) finds no parallel in any\r\nknown human jaw; it resembles the milk canine of the chimpanzee more\r\nthan that of the adult dentition.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that any clear view of pleistocene man can be obtained\r\nfrom these imperfect scraps of evidence, valuable though they are.\r\nRather may we agree with Keith that the problem grows more instead of\r\nless complex. \"In our first youthful burst of Darwinianism we pictured\r\nour evolution as a simple procession of forms leading from ape to man.\r\nEach age, as it passed, transformed the men of the time one stage nearer\r\nto us--one more distant from the ape. The true picture is very\r\ndifferent. We have to conceive an ancient world in which the family of\r\nmankind was broken up into narrow groups or genera, each genus again\r\ndivided into a number of species--much as we see in the monkey or ape\r\nworld of to-day. Then out of that great welter of forms one species\r\nbecame the dominant form, and ultimately the sole surviving one--the\r\nspecies represented by the modern races of mankind[18].\"\r\n\r\nWe may assume therefore that the earth was mainly peopled by the\r\ngeneralised pleistocene precursors, who moved about, like the other\r\nmigrating faunas, unconsciously, everywhere following the lines of least\r\nresistance, advancing or receding, and acting generally on blind impulse\r\nrather than of any set purpose.\r\n\r\nThat such must have been the nature of the first migratory movements\r\nwill appear evident when we consider that they were carried on by rude\r\nhordes, all very much alike, and differing not greatly from other\r\nzoological groups, and further that these migrations took place prior to\r\nthe development of all cultural appliances beyond the ability to wield a\r\nbroken branch or a sapling, or else chip or flake primitive stone\r\nimplements[19].\r\n\r\nHerein lies the explanation of the curious phenomenon, which was a\r\nstumbling-block to premature systematists, that all the works of early\r\nman everywhere present the most startling resemblances, affording\r\nabsolutely no elements for classification, for instance, during the\r\ntimes corresponding with the Chellean or first period of the Old Stone\r\nAge. The implements of palaeolithic type so common in parts of South\r\nIndia, South Africa, the Sudan, Egypt, etc., present a remarkable\r\nresemblance to one another. This, while affording a _prima facies_ case\r\nfor, is not conclusive of, the migrations of a definite type of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the identity of certain objects from the Hastings\r\nkitchen-middens and a barrow near Sevenoaks, W. J. L. Abbot proceeds:\r\n\"The first thing that would strike one in looking over a few trays of\r\nthese implements is the remarkable likeness which they bear to those of\r\nDordogne. Indeed many of the figures in the magnificent 'Reliquiae\r\nAquitanicae' might almost have been produced from these specimens[20].\"\r\nAnd Sir J. Evans, extending his glance over a wider horizon, discovers\r\nimplements in other distant lands \"so identical in form and character\r\nwith British specimens that they might have been manufactured by the\r\nsame hands.... On the banks of the Nile, many hundreds of feet above its\r\npresent level, implements of the European types have been discovered,\r\nwhile in Somaliland, in an ancient river valley, at a great elevation\r\nabove the sea, Seton-Karr has collected a large number of implements\r\nformed of flint and quartzite, which, judging from their form and\r\ncharacter, might have been dug out of the drift-deposits of the Somme\r\nand the Seine, the Thames or the ancient Solent[21].\"\r\n\r\nIt was formerly held that man himself showed a similar uniformity, and\r\nall palaeolithic skulls were referred to one long-headed type, called,\r\nfrom the most famous example, the Neandertal, which was regarded as\r\nhaving close affinities with the present Australians. But this\r\nresemblance is shown by Boule[22] and others to be purely superficial,\r\nand recent archaeological finds indicate that more than one racial type\r\nwas in existence in the Palaeolithic Age.\r\n\r\nW. L. H. Duckworth on anatomical evidence constructs the following\r\ntable[23].\r\n\r\n  Group  I. Early ancestral forms.\r\n              _Ex. gr. H. heidelbergensis._\r\n\r\n  Group II. _Subdivision A. H. primigenius._\r\n              _Ex. gr. La Chapelle._\r\n            _Subdivision B. H. recens_; with varieties\r\n              { _H. fossilis. Ex. gr. Galley Hill._\r\n              { _H. sapiens._\r\n\r\nH. Obermaier[24] argues as follows: _Homo primigenius_ is neither the\r\nrepresentative of an intermediate species between ape and man, nor a\r\nlower or distinct type than _Homo sapiens_, but an older primitive\r\nvariety (race) of the latter, which survives in exceptional cases down\r\nto the present day[25]. Clearly then, according to the rules of\r\nzoological classification, we must term the two, _Homo sapiens var.\r\nprimigenius_, as compared with _Homo sapiens var. recens_.\r\n\r\nWhatever classification or nomenclature may be adopted the dual division\r\nin palaeolithic times is now generally recognised. The more primitive\r\ntype is commonly called Neandertal man, from the famous cranium found\r\nin the Neandertal cave in 1857, or Mousterian man, from the culture\r\nassociations. To this group belong the Gibraltar skull[26], and the\r\nskeletons from Spy[27], and Krapina, Croatia[28], together with the\r\nlater discoveries (1908-11) at La Chapelle[29] (Correze), Le\r\nMoustier[30], La Ferassie[31] (Dordogne) and many others.\r\n\r\nPalaeolithic examples of the modern human type have been found at Bruex\r\n(Bohemia)[32], Bruenn (Moravia)[33] and Galley Hill in Kent[34], but the\r\nmost complete find was that at Combe Capelle in 1909[35]. The numerous\r\nskeletons found at Cro-Magnon[36] and at the Grottes de Grimaldi at\r\nMentone[37] though showing certain skeletal differences may be included\r\nin this group, the earliest examples of which are associated with\r\nAurignacian culture[38].\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence contributed by these examples the main characteristics\r\nof the two groups may be indicated, although, owing to the imperfection\r\nof the records, any generalisations must necessarily be tentative and\r\nsubject to criticism.\r\n\r\nThe La Chapelle skull recalls many of the primitive features of the\r\n\"ancestral types.\" The low receding forehead, the overhanging\r\nbrow-ridges, forming continuous horizontal bars of bone overshadowing\r\nthe orbits, the inflated circumnasal region, the enormous jaws, with\r\nmassive ascending ramus, shallow sigmoid notch, \"negative\" chin and\r\nother \"simian\" characters seem reminiscent of _Pithecanthropus_ and\r\n_Homo Heidelbergensis_. The cranial capacity however is estimated at\r\nover 1600 c.c., thus exceeding that of the average modern European, and\r\nthis development, even though associated, as M. Boule has pointed out,\r\nwith a comparatively lowly brain, is of striking significance. The low\r\nstature, probably about 1600 mm. (under 5-1/2 feet) makes the size of\r\nthe skull and cranial capacity all the more remarkable. \"A survey of\r\nthe characters of Neanderthal man--as manifested by his skeleton, brain\r\ncast, and teeth--have convinced anthropologists of two things: first,\r\nthat we are dealing with a form of man totally different from any form\r\nnow living; and secondly, that the kind of difference far exceeds that\r\nwhich separates the most divergent of modern human races[39].\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest complete and authentic example of \"Aurignacian man\" was the\r\nskeleton discovered near Combe Capelle (Dordogne) in 1909[40]. The\r\nstature is low, not exceeding that of the Neandertal type, but the limb\r\nbones are slighter and the build is altogether lighter and more slender.\r\nThe greatest contrast lies in the skull. The forehead is vertical\r\ninstead of receding, and the strongly projecting brow-ridges are\r\ndiminished, the jaw is less massive and less simian with regard to all\r\nthe features mentioned above. Especially is this difference noticeable\r\nin the projection of the chin, which now for the first time shows the\r\nmodern human outline. In short there are no salient features which\r\ncannot be matched among the living races of the present day.\r\n\r\nOn the cultural side no less than on the physical, the thousands of\r\nyears which the lowest estimate attributes to the Early Stone Age were\r\nmarked by slow but continuous changes.\r\n\r\nThe Reutelian (at the junction of the Pliocene and Pleistocene),\r\nMafflian and Mesvinian industries, recognised by M. Rutot in Belgium,\r\nbelong to the doubtful Eolithic Period, not yet generally accepted[41].\r\n\r\nThe lowest palaeolithic deposit is the Strepyan, so called from Strepy,\r\nnear Charleroi, typically represented at St Acheul, Amiens, and\r\nrecognised also in the Thames Valley[42]. The tools exhibit deliberate\r\nflaking, and mark the transition between eolithic and palaeolithic\r\nwork. The associated fauna includes two species of elephant,\r\n_E. meridionalis_ and _E. antiquus_, two species of rhinoceros,\r\n_R. Etruscus_ and _R. Merckii_, and the hippopotamus. It is possible\r\nthat the Mauer jaw and the Piltdown skull belong to this stage.\r\n\r\nThe Chellean industry[43], with the typical coarsely flaked\r\nalmond-shaped implements, occurs abundantly in the South of England and\r\nin France, less commonly in Belgium, Germany, Austria-Hungary and\r\nRussia, while examples have been recognised in Palestine, Egypt,\r\nSomaliland, Cape Colony, Madras and other localities, though outside\r\nEurope the date is not always ascertainable and the form is not an\r\nabsolute criterion[44].\r\n\r\nAcheulean types succeed apparently in direct descent but the implements\r\nare altogether lighter, sharper, more efficient, and are characterised\r\nby finer workmanship and carefully retouched edges. A small finely\r\nfinished lanceolate implement is typical of the sub-industry or local\r\ndevelopment at La Micoque (Dordogne).\r\n\r\nThe Chellean industry is associated with a warm climate and the remains\r\nof _Elephas antiquus_, _Rhinoceros Merckii_ and hippopotamus. Lower\r\nAcheulean shows little variation, but with Upper Acheulean certain\r\nanimals indicating a colder climate make their appearance, including\r\nthe mammoth, _Elephas primigenius_, and the woolly rhinoceros,\r\n_R. tichorhinus_, but no reindeer.\r\n\r\nThe Mousterian industry is entirely distinct from its predecessors. The\r\nwarm fauna has disappeared, the reindeer first occurs together with the\r\nmusk ox, arctic fox, the marmot and other cold-loving animals. Man\r\nappears to have sought refuge in the caves, and from complete skeletons\r\nfound in cave deposits of this stage we gain the first clear ideas\r\nconcerning the physical type of man of the early palaeolithic period.\r\nTypical Mousterian implements consist of leaf-like or triangular points\r\nmade from flakes struck from the nodule instead of from the dressed\r\nnodule itself, as in the earlier stages. The Levallois flakes, occurring\r\nat the base of the Mousterian (sometimes included in the Acheulean\r\nstage), initiate this new style of workmanship, but the Mousterian point\r\nshows an improvement in shape and a greater mastery in technique,\r\nproducing a more efficient tool for piercing and cutting. Scrapers,\r\ncarefully retouched, with a curved edge are also characteristic, besides\r\nmany other forms. The complete skeletons from Le Moustier itself, La\r\nChapelle, La Ferassie, and Krapina all belong to this stage, which marks\r\nthe end of the lower palaeolithic period, the Age of the Mammoth.\r\n\r\nThe upper palaeolithic or Reindeer Age is divided into Aurignacian,\r\nSolutrian, and Magdalenian[45] culture stages, with the Azilian[46]\r\nseparating the Magdalenian from the neolithic period. Each stage is\r\ndistinguished by its implements and its art. The Aurignacian fauna,\r\nthough closely resembling the Mousterian, indicates an amelioration of\r\nclimate, the most abundant animals being the bison, horse, cave lion,\r\nand cave hyena, and human settlements are again found in the open. Among\r\nthe typical implements are finely worked knife-like blades (Chatelperron\r\npoint, Gravette point), keeled scrapers (Tarte type), _burins_ or\r\ngravers, and various tools and ornaments of bone. Art is represented by\r\nengravings and wall paintings, and to this stage belong statuettes\r\nrepresenting nude female figures such as those of Brassempouy, Mentone,\r\nPont-a-Lesse (Belgium), Predmost and Willendorf, near Krems. The\r\nNeandertal type appears to have died out and Aurignacian man belongs to\r\nthe modern type represented at Combe Capelle. If the evidence of the\r\nfigurines is to be accepted, a steatopygous race was at this time in\r\nexistence, which Sollas is inclined to connect with the Bushmen[47].\r\n\r\nThe Solutrian stage is characterised by the abundance of the horse,\r\nreplaced in the succeeding period by the reindeer. The Solutrians seem\r\nto have been a warlike steppe people who came from the east into western\r\nEurope. Their subsequent fate has not been elucidated. The culture\r\nappears to have had a limited range, only a few stations being found\r\noutside Dordogne and the neighbouring departments. The technique, as\r\nshown in the laurel-leaf and willow-leaf points, exhibits a perfection\r\nof workmanship unequalled in the Palaeolithic Age, and only excelled by\r\nlate prehistoric knives of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe rock shelter at La Madeleine has given its name to the closing epoch\r\nof the Palaeolithic Age. The flint industry shows distinct decadence,\r\nbut the working in bone and horn was at its zenith; indeed, so marked is\r\nthe contrast between this and the preceding stage that Breuil is\r\nconvinced that \"the first Magdalenians were not evolved from the\r\nSolutrians; they were new-comers in our region[48].\" The typical\r\nimplements are barbed harpoons in reindeer antler (later that of the\r\nstag), often decorated with engravings. Sculpture and engravings of\r\nanimals in life-like attitudes are among the most remarkable records of\r\nthe age, and the polychrome pictures in the caves of Altamira, \"the\r\nSistine chapel of Quaternary Art,\" are the admiration of the world[49].\r\n\r\nIn the cave of Mas-d'Azil, between the Magdalenian and Neolithic\r\ndeposits occurs a stratum, termed Azilian, which, to some extent,\r\nbridges over the obscure transition between the Palaeolithic and\r\nNeolithic Ages. The reindeer has disappeared, and its place is taken by\r\nthe stag. The realistic art of the Magdalenians is succeeded by a more\r\ngeometric style. In flint working a return is made to Aurignacian\r\nmethods, and a particular development of pygmy flints has received the\r\nname _Tardenoisian_[50].\r\n\r\nThe characteristic implement is still the harpoon, but it differs in\r\nshape from the Magdalenian implement, owing to the different structure\r\nof the material. Painted pebbles, marked with red and black lines, in\r\nsome cases suggesting a script, have given rise to much controversy.\r\nTheir meaning at present remains obscure[51].\r\n\r\nThe question of prehistoric chronology is a difficult one, and the more\r\ncautious authorities do not commit themselves to dates. Of late years,\r\nhowever, such researches as those of A. Penck and E. Brueckner in the\r\nAlps[52] and of Baron de Geer and W. C. Brogger in Sweden[53], have\r\nprovided a sound basis for calculations. Penck recognises four periods\r\nof glaciation during the pleistocene period, which he has named after\r\ntypical areas, the Guenz, Mindel, Riss and Wuerm. He dates the Wuerm\r\nmaximum at between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago and estimates the\r\nduration of the Riss-Wuerm interglacial period at about 100,000 years.\r\nAccording to his calculations the Chellean industry occurs in the\r\nMindel-Riss, or even in the Guenz-Mindel interval, but it is more\r\ncommonly placed in the mild phase intervening before the last (Wuerm)\r\nglaciation, this latter corresponding with the cold Mousterian stage. At\r\nleast four subsequent oscillations of climate have been recognised by\r\nPenck, the Achen, Buehl, Gschnitz and Daun, and the correspondence of\r\nthese with palaeolithic culture stages may be seen in the following\r\ntable[54].\r\n\r\n        Penck and Brueckner                Obermaier and others    Rutot\r\n\r\n      Post-glacial {Daun    } Azilian     Proto-Neolithic}\r\n        with       {Gschnitz}             Azilian        }\r\n      oscillations {Buehl  }               Magdalenian    } Neolithic\r\n                   {Achen } Magdalenian   Solutrian and  }\r\n                          }                 Aurignacian  }\r\n  IV.

But if, as recent\r\ndiscoveries would seem to indicate, man was an occupant of our Continent\r\nduring the First Interglacial epoch, if not in still earlier times, we\r\nmay be compelled greatly to increase our estimate of his antiquity\"\r\n(p. 303).\r\n\r\nW. J. Sollas, on the other hand, is content with a far more contracted\r\nmeasure. Basing his calculations mainly on the investigations of de\r\nGeer, he concludes that the interval that separates our time from the\r\nbeginning of the end of the last glacial episode is 17,000 years. He\r\nplaces the Azilian age at 5500 B.C., the middle of the Magdalenian age\r\nsomewhere about 8000 B.C., Mousterian 15,000 B.C., and the close of the\r\nChellean 25,000 B.C.[56]\r\n\r\nBut when all the changes in climate are taken into consideration, the\r\nperiods of elevation and depression of the land, the transformations of\r\nthe animals, the evolution of man, the gradual stages of advance in\r\nhuman culture, the development of the races of mankind, and their\r\ndistribution over the surface of the globe, this estimate is regarded by\r\nmany as insufficient. Allen Sturge claims \"scores of thousands of years\"\r\nfor the neolithic period alone[57], and Sir W. Turner points out the\r\nvery remote times to which the appearance of neolithic man must be\r\nassigned in Scotland. After showing that there is undoubted evidence of\r\nthe presence of man in North Britain during the formation of the Carse\r\nclays, this careful observer explains that the Carse cliffs, now in\r\nplaces 45 to 50 feet above the present sea-level, formed the bed of an\r\nestuary or arm of the sea, which in post-glacial times extended almost,\r\nif not quite across the land from east to west, thus separating the\r\nregion south of the Forth from North Britain. He even suggests, after\r\nthe separation of Britain from the Continent in earlier times, another\r\nland connection, a \"Neolithic land-bridge\" by which the men of the New\r\nStone Age may have reached Scotland when the upheaved 100-foot terrace\r\nwas still clothed with the great forest growths that have since\r\ndisappeared[58].\r\n\r\nOne begins to ask, Are even 100,000 years sufficient for such\r\noscillations of the surface, upheaval of marine beds, appearance of\r\ngreat estuaries, renewed connection of Britain with the Continent by a\r\n\"Neolithic land-bridge\"? In the Falkirk district neolithic\r\nkitchen-middens occur on, or at the base of, the bluffs which overlook\r\nthe Carse lands, that is, the old sea-coast. In the Carse of Gowrie also\r\na dug-out canoe was found at the very base of the deposits, and\r\nimmediately above the buried forest-bed of the Tay Valley[59].\r\n\r\nThat the neolithic period was also of long duration even in Scandinavia\r\nhas been made evident by Carl Wibling, who calculates that the\r\ngeological changes on the south-east coast of Sweden (Province of\r\nBleking), since its first occupation by the men of the New Stone Age,\r\nmust have required a period of \"at least 10,000 years[60].\"\r\n\r\nStill more startling are the results of the protracted researches\r\ncarried on by J. Nueesch at the now famous station of Schweizersbild,\r\nnear Schaffhausen in Switzerland[61]. This station was apparently in the\r\ncontinuous occupation of man during both Stone Ages, and here have been\r\ncollected as many as 14,000 objects belonging to the first, and over\r\n6000 referred to the second period. Although the early settlement was\r\nonly post-glacial, a point about which there is no room for doubt, L.\r\nLaloy[62] has estimated \"the absolute duration of both epochs together\r\nat from 24,000 to 29,000 years.\" We may, therefore, ask, If a\r\ncomparatively recent post-glacial station in Switzerland is about 29,000\r\nyears old, how old may a pre- or inter-glacial station be in Gaul or\r\nBritain?\r\n\r\nFrom all this we see how fully justified is J. W. Powell's remark that\r\nthe natural history of early man becomes more and more a geological, and\r\nnot merely an ethnological problem[63]. We also begin to understand how\r\nit is that, after an existence of some five score millenniums, the first\r\nspecialised human varieties have diverged greatly from the original\r\ntypes, which have thus become almost \"ideal quantities,\" the subjects\r\nrather of palaeontological than of strictly anthropological studies.\r\n\r\nAnd here another consideration of great moment presents itself. During\r\nthese long ages some of the groups--most African negroes south of the\r\nequator, most Oceanic negroes (Negritoes and Papuans), and Australian\r\nand American aborigines--have remained in their original habitats ever\r\nsince what may be called the first settlement of the earth by man.\r\nOthers again, the more restless or enterprising peoples, such as the\r\nMongols, Manchus, Turks, Ugro-Finns, Arabs, and most Europeans, have no\r\ndoubt moved about somewhat freely; but these later migrations, whether\r\nhostile or peaceable, have for the most part been confined to regions\r\npresenting the same or like physical and climatic conditions. Wherever\r\ndifferent climatic zones have been invaded, the intruders have failed to\r\nsecure a permanent footing, either perishing outright, or disappearing\r\nby absorption or more or less complete assimilation to the aboriginal\r\nelements. Such are some \"black Arabs\" in Egyptian Sudan, other Semites\r\nand Hamites in Abyssinia and West Sudan (Himyarites, Fulahs and others),\r\nFinns and Turks in Hungary and the Balkan Peninsula (Magyars, Bulgars,\r\nOsmanli), Portuguese and Netherlanders in Malaysia, English in tropical\r\nor sub-tropical lands, such as India, where Eurasian half-breeds alone\r\nare capable of founding family groups.\r\n\r\nThe human varieties are thus seen to be, like all other zoological\r\nspecies, the outcome of their several environments. They are what\r\nclimate, soil, diet, pursuits and inherited characters have made them,\r\nso that all sudden transitions are usually followed by disastrous\r\nresults[64]. \"To urge the emigration of women and children, or of any\r\nsave those of the most robust health, to the tropics, may not be to\r\nmurder in the first degree, but it should be classed, to put it mildly,\r\nas incitement to it[65].\" Acclimatisation may not be impossible but in\r\nall extreme cases it can be effected only at great sacrifice of life,\r\nand by slow processes, the most effective of which is perhaps Natural\r\nSelection. By this means we may indeed suppose the world to have been\r\nfirst peopled.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it should be remembered that we know little of the\r\nclimatic conditions at the time of the first migrations, though it has\r\nbeen assumed that it was everywhere much milder than at present.\r\nConsequently the different zones of temperature were less marked, and\r\nthe passage from one region to another more easily effected than in\r\nlater times. In a word the pleistocene precursors had far less\r\ndifficulty in adapting themselves to their new surroundings than modern\r\npeoples have when they emigrate, for instance, from Southern Europe to\r\nBrazil and Paraguay, or from the British Isles to Rhodesia and\r\nNyassaland.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of man must be no less true of his works; from which it\r\nfollows that racial and cultural zones correspond in the main with zones\r\nof temperature, except so far as the latter may be modified by altitude,\r\nmarine influences, or other local conditions. A glance at past and\r\nexisting relations the world over will show that such harmonies have at\r\nall times prevailed. No doubt the overflow of the leading European\r\npeoples during the last 400 years has brought about divers dislocations,\r\nblurrings, and in places even total effacements of the old landmarks.\r\n\r\nBut, putting aside these disturbances, it will be found that in the\r\nEastern hemisphere the inter-tropical regions, hot, moist and more\r\nfavourable to vegetable than to animal vitality, are usually occupied by\r\nsavage, cultureless populations. Within the same sphere are also\r\ncomprised most of the extra-tropical southern lands, all tapering\r\ntowards the antarctic waters, isolated, and otherwise unsuitable for\r\nareas of higher specialisation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the sub-tropical Asiatic peninsulas, the bleak Tibetan\r\ntableland, the Pamir, and arid Mongolian steppes are found mainly in\r\npossession of somewhat stationary communities, which present every stage\r\nbetween sheer savagery and civilisation.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the higher races and cultures are confined to the more\r\nfavoured north temperate zone, so that between the parallels of 24 deg. and\r\n50 deg. (but owing to local conditions falling in the far East to 40 deg. and\r\nunder, and in the extreme West rising to 55 deg.) are situated nearly all\r\nthe great centres, past and present, of human activities--the Egyptian,\r\nBabylonian, Minoan (Aegean), Hellenic, Etruscan, Roman, and modern\r\nEuropean. Almost the only exceptions are the early civilisations\r\n(Himyaritic) of Yemen (Arabia Felix) and Abyssinia, where the low\r\nlatitude is neutralised by altitude and a copious rainfall.\r\n\r\nThanks also to altitude, to marine influences, and the contraction of\r\nthe equatorial lands, the relations are almost completely reversed in\r\nthe New World. Here all the higher developments took place, not in the\r\ntemperate but in the tropical zone, within which lay the seats of the\r\nPeruvian, Chimu, Chibcha and Maya-Quiche cultures; the Aztec sphere\r\nalone ranged northwards a little beyond the Tropic of Cancer.\r\n\r\nThus in both hemispheres the iso-cultural bands follow the isothermal\r\nlines in all their deflections, and the human varieties everywhere\r\nfaithfully reflect the conditions of their several environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Ethnology_, Chaps.

J. Evans and many others, all archaeologists first, and\r\nanthropologists only in the second instance.\r\n\r\nFrom the researches of these investigators it is now clear that copper,\r\nbronze, and iron were successively in use in Europe in the order named,\r\nso that the current expressions, \"Copper,\" \"Bronze,\" and \"Iron\" Ages\r\nremain still justified. But it also appears that overlappings, already\r\nbeginning in late Neolithic times, were everywhere so frequent that in\r\nmany localities it is quite impossible to draw any well-marked dividing\r\nlines between the successive metal periods.\r\n\r\nThat iron came last, a fact already known by vague tradition to the\r\nancients[66], is beyond doubt, and it is no less certain that bronze of\r\nvarious types intervened between copper and iron. But much obscurity\r\nstill surrounds the question of copper, which occurs in so many graves\r\nof Neolithic and Bronze times, that this metal has even been denied an\r\nindependent position in the sequence.\r\n\r\nBut we shall not be surprised that confusion should prevail on this\r\npoint, if we reflect that the metals, unlike stone, came to remain. Once\r\nintroduced they were soon found to be indispensable to civilised man, so\r\nthat in a sense the \"Metal Ages\" still survive, and must last to the end\r\nof time. Hence it was natural that copper should be found in prehistoric\r\ngraves associated, first with polished stone implements, and then with\r\nbronze and iron, just as, since the arrival of the English in Australia,\r\nspoons, clay pipes, penknives, pannikins, and the like, are now found\r\nmingled with stone objects in the graves of the aborigines.\r\n\r\nBut that there was a true Copper Age[67] prior to that of Bronze, though\r\npossibly of not very long duration, except of course in the New\r\nWorld[68], has been placed beyond reasonable doubt by recent\r\ninvestigations. Considerable attention was devoted to the subject by J.\r\nH. Gladstone, who finds that copper was worked by the Egyptians in the\r\nSinaitic Peninsula, that is, in the famous mines of the Wadi Maghara,\r\nfrom the fourth to the eighteenth dynasty, perhaps from 3000 to 1580\r\nB.C.[69] During that epoch tools were made of pure copper in Egypt and\r\nSyria, and by the Amorites in Palestine, often on the model of their\r\nstone prototypes[70].\r\n\r\nElliot Smith[71] claims that \"the full story of the coming of copper,\r\ncomplete in every detail and circumstance, written in a simple and\r\nconvincing fashion that he who runs may read,\" has been displayed in\r\nEgypt ever since the year 1894, though the full significance of the\r\nevidence was not recognised until Reisner called attention to the record\r\nof pre-dynastic graves in Upper Egypt when superintending the\r\nexcavations at Naga-ed-der in 1908[72]. These excavations revealed the\r\nindigenous civilisation of the ancient Egyptians and, according to\r\nElliot Smith, dispose of the idea hitherto held by most archaeologists\r\nthat Egypt owed her knowledge of metals to Babylonia or some other\r\nAsiatic source, where copper, and possibly also bronze, may be traced\r\nback to the fourth millennium B.C. There was doubtless intercourse\r\nbetween the civilisations of Egypt and Babylonia but \"Reisner has\r\nrevealed the complete absence of any evidence to show or even to suggest\r\nthat the language, the mode of writing, the knowledge of copper ... were\r\nimported\" (p. 34). Elliot Smith justly claims (p. 6) that in no other\r\ncountry has a similarly complete history of the discovery and the\r\nevolution of the working of copper been revealed, but until equally\r\nexhaustive excavations have been undertaken on contemporary or earlier\r\nsites in Sumer and Elam, the question cannot be regarded as settled.\r\n\r\nThe work of J. de Morgan at Susa[73] (1907-8) shows the extreme\r\nantiquity of the Copper Age in ancient Elam, even if his estimate of\r\n5000 B.C. is regarded as a millennium too early[74]. At the base of the\r\nmound on the natural soil, beneath 24 meters of archaeological layers,\r\nwere the remains of a town and a necropolis consisting of about 1000\r\ntombs. Those of the men contained copper axes of primitive type; those\r\nof the women, little vases of paint, together with discs of polished\r\ncopper to serve as mirrors. At Fara, excavations by Koldewey in 1902,\r\nand by Andrae and Noeldeke in 1903 on the site of Shuruppak (the home of\r\nthe Babylonian Noah) in the valley of the Lower Euphrates, revealed\r\ngraves attributed to the prehistoric Sumerians, containing copper spear\r\nheads, axes and drinking vessels[75].\r\n\r\nIn Europe, North Italy, Hungary and Ireland[76] may lay claim to a\r\nCopper Age, but there is very little evidence of such a stage in\r\nBritain. To this period also may be attributed the nest or _cache_ of\r\npure copper ingots found at Tourc'h, west of the Aven Valley,\r\nFinisterre, described by M. de Villiers du Terrage, and comprising 23\r\npieces, with a total weight of nearly 50 lbs.[77] These objects, which\r\nbelong to \"the transitional period when copper was used at first\r\nconcurrently with polished stone, and then disappeared as bronze came\r\ninto more general use[78],\" came probably from Hungary, at that time\r\napparently the chief source of this metal for most parts of Europe. Of\r\nover 200 copper objects described by Mathaeus Much[79] nearly all were\r\nof Hungarian or South German _provenance_, five only being accredited to\r\nBritain and eight to France.\r\n\r\nThe study of this subject has been greatly advanced by J. Hampel, who\r\nholds on solid grounds that in some regions, especially Hungary, copper\r\nplayed a dominant part for many centuries, and is undoubtedly the\r\ncharacteristic metal of a distinct culture. His conclusions are based on\r\nthe study of about 500 copper objects found in Hungary and preserved in\r\nthe Buda Pesth collections. Reviewing all the facts attesting a Copper\r\nAge in Central Europe, Egypt, Italy, Cyprus, Troy, Scandinavia, North\r\nAsia, and other lands, he concludes that a Copper Age may have sprung up\r\nindependently wherever the ore was found, as in the Ural and Altai\r\nMountains, Italy, Spain, Britain, Cyprus, Sinai; such culture being\r\ngenerally indigenous, and giving evidence of more or less characteristic\r\nlocal features[80]. In fact we know for certain that such an independent\r\nCopper Age was developed not only in the region of the Great Lakes of\r\nNorth America, but also amongst the Bantu peoples of Katanga and other\r\nparts of Central Africa. Copper is not an alloy like bronze, but a\r\nsoft, easily-worked metal occurring in large quantities and in a\r\ntolerably pure state near the surface in many parts of the world. The\r\nwonder is, not that it should have been found and worked at a somewhat\r\nremote epoch in several different centres, but that its use should have\r\nbeen so soon superseded in so many places by the bronze alloys.\r\n\r\nFrom copper to bronze, however, the passage was slow and progressive,\r\nthe proper proportion of tin, which was probably preceded in some places\r\nby an alloy of antimony, having been apparently arrived at by repeated\r\nexperiments often carried out with no little skill by those prehistoric\r\nmetallurgists.\r\n\r\nAs suggested by Bibra in 1869, the ores of different metals would appear\r\nto have been at first smelted together empirically, and the process\r\ncontinued until satisfactory results were obtained. Hence the\r\nextraordinary number of metals, of which percentages are found in some\r\nof the earlier specimens, such as those of the Elbing Museum, which on\r\nanalysis yielded tin, lead, silver, iron, antimony, arsenic, sulphur,\r\nnickel, cobalt, and zinc in varying quantities[81].\r\n\r\nSome bronzes from the pyramid of Medum analysed by J. H. Gladstone[82]\r\nyielded the high percentage of 9.1 of tin, from which we must infer, not\r\nonly that bronze, but bronze of the finest quality, was already known to\r\nthe Egyptians of the fourth dynasty, _i.e._ 2840 B.C. The statuette of\r\nGudea of Lagash (2500 B.C.) claimed as the earliest example of bronze in\r\nBabylonia is now known to be pure copper, and though objects from Tello\r\n(Lagash) of earlier date contain a mixture of tin, zinc, arsenic and\r\nother alloys, the proportion is insignificant. The question of priority\r\nmust, however, be left open until the relative chronology of Egypt and\r\nBabylonia is finally settled, and this is still a much disputed\r\npoint[83]. Neither would all the difficulties with regard to the origin\r\nof bronze be cleared up should Egypt or Babylonia establish her claim to\r\npossess the earliest example of the metal, for neither country appears\r\nto possess any tin. The nearest deposit known in ancient times would\r\nseem to be that of Drangiana, mentioned by Strabo, identified with\r\nmodern Khorassan[84].\r\n\r\nStrabo and other classical writers also mention the occurrence of tin in\r\nthe west, in Spain, Portugal and the Cassiterides or tin islands, whose\r\nidentity has given rise to so much speculation[85], but \"though in after\r\ntimes Egypt drew her tin from Europe it would be bold indeed to suppose\r\nthat she did so [in 3000 B.C.] and still bolder to maintain that she\r\nlearned from northern people how to make the alloy called bronze[86].\"\r\nApart from the indigenous Egyptian origin maintained by Elliot Smith\r\n(above) the hypothesis offering fewest difficulties is that the earliest\r\nbronze is to be traced to the region of Elam, and that the knowledge\r\nspread from S. Chaldaea (Elam-Sumer) to S. Egypt in the third millennium\r\nB.C.[87]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be little doubt that the Aegean was the centre of\r\ndispersal for the new metals throughout the Mediterranean area, and\r\ncopper ingots have been found at various points of the Mediterranean,\r\nmarked with Cretan signs[88]. Bronze was known in Crete before 2000 B.C.\r\nfor a bronze dagger and spear head were found at Hagios Onuphrios, near\r\nPhaistos, with seals resembling those of the sixth to eleventh\r\ndynasties[89].\r\n\r\nFrom the eastern Mediterranean the knowledge spread during the second\r\nmillennium along the ordinary trade routes which had long been in use.\r\nThe mineral ores of Spain were exploited in pre-Mycenean times and\r\nprobably contributed in no small measure to the industrial development\r\nof southern Europe. From tribe to tribe, along the Atlantic coasts the\r\ntraffic in minerals reached the British Isles, where the rich ores were\r\ndiscovered which, in their turn, supplied the markets of the north, the\r\nwest and the south.\r\n\r\nEven Ireland was not left untouched by Aegean influence, which reached\r\nit, according to G. Coffey[90], by way of the Danube and the Elbe, and\r\nthence by way of Scandinavia, though this is a matter on which there is\r\nmuch difference of opinion. Ireland's richness in gold during the Bronze\r\nAge made her \"a kind of El Dorado of the western world,\" and the\r\ndiscovery of a gold torc found by Schliemann in the royal treasury in\r\nthe second city of Troy raises the question as to whether the model of\r\nthe torc was imported into Ireland from the south[90], or whether (which\r\nJ. Dechelette[91] regards as less probable) there was already an\r\nexportation of Irish gold to the eastern Mediterranean in pre-Mycenean\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nOf recent years great strides have been made towards the establishment\r\nof a definite chronology linking the historic with the prehistoric\r\nperiods in the Aegean, in Egypt and in Babylonia, and as the estimates\r\nof various authorities differ sometimes by a thousand years or so, the\r\nsubjoined table will be of use to indicate the chronological schemes\r\nmost commonly followed; the dates are in all cases merely approximate.\r\n\r\nIt has often been pointed out that there is no reason why iron should\r\nnot have been the earliest metal to be used by man. Its ores are more\r\nabundant and more easily reduced than any others, and are worked by\r\npeoples in a low grade of culture at the present day[92]. Iron may have\r\nbeen known in Egypt almost as early as bronze, for a piece in the\r\nBritish Museum is attributed to the fourth dynasty, and some beads of\r\nmanufactured iron were found in a pre-dynastic grave at El Gerzeh[93].\r\nBut these and other less well authenticated occurrences of iron are\r\nrare, and the metal was not common in Egypt before the middle of the\r\nsecond millennium. By the end of the second millennium the knowledge had\r\nspread throughout the eastern Mediterranean[94], and towards 900 at\r\nlatest iron was in common use in Italy and Central Europe.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLE.\r\n\r\n      Egypt[95]  Babylonia[96]    Aegean[97]   Greece[98]  Bronze Age in\r\n                                                           Europe[99]\r\n\r\n 3300 Dynasty I\r\n 3200\r\n 3100\r\n 3000            Dynasty of Opis  ?Early       ?Pre-Mycenean\r\n 2900            Dyn. of Kish        Minoan I\r\n 2800 Dyn.

Hallstatt\r\n\r\nThe introduction of iron into Italy has often been attributed to the\r\nEtruscans, who were thought to have brought the knowledge from Lydia.\r\nBut the most abundant remains of the Early Iron Age are found not in\r\nTuscany, but along the coasts of the Adriatic[102], showing that iron\r\nfollowed the well-known route of the amber trade, thus reaching Central\r\nEurope and _Hallstatt_ (which has given its name to the Early Iron Age),\r\nwhere alone in Europe the gradual transition from the use of bronze to\r\nthat of iron has been clearly traced. W. Ridgeway[103] believes that the\r\nuse of iron was first discovered in the Hallstatt area and that thence\r\nit spread to Switzerland, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, the Aegean area,\r\nand Egypt rather than that the culture drift was in the opposite\r\ndirection. There is no difference of opinion however as to the\r\nimportance of this Central European area which contained the most famous\r\niron mines of antiquity. Hallstatt culture extended from the Iberian\r\npeninsula in the west to Hungary in the east, but scarcely reached\r\nScandinavia, North Germany, Armorica or the British Isles where the\r\nBronze Age may be said to have lasted down to about 500 B.C. Over such a\r\nvast domain the culture was not everywhere of a uniform type and\r\nHoernes[104] recognises four geographical divisions distinguished mainly\r\nby pottery and fibulae, and provisionally classified as Illyrian in the\r\nSouth West, or Adriatic region, in touch with Greece and Italy; Celtic\r\nin the Central or Danubian area; with an off-shoot in Western Germany,\r\nNorthern Switzerland and Eastern France; and Germanic in parts of\r\nGermany, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Posen.\r\n\r\nThe Hallstatt period ends, roughly, at 500 B.C., and the Later Iron Age\r\ntakes its name from the settlement of _La Tene_, in a bay of the Lake of\r\nNeuchatel in Switzerland. This culture, while owing much to that of\r\nHallstatt, and much also to foreign sources, possesses a distinct\r\nindividuality, and though soon overpowered on the Continent by Roman\r\ninfluence, attained a remarkable brilliance in the Late Celtic period in\r\nthe British Isles.\r\n\r\nThat the peoples of the Metal Ages were physically well developed, and\r\nin a great part of Europe and Asia already of Aryan speech, there can be\r\nno reasonable doubt. A skull of the early Hallstatt period, from a grave\r\nnear Wildenroth, Upper Bavaria, is described by Virchow as long-headed,\r\nwith a cranial capacity of no less than 1585 c.c., strongly developed\r\nocciput, very high and narrow face and nose, and in every respect a\r\nsuperb specimen of the regular-featured, long-headed North\r\nEuropean[105]. But owing to the prevalence of cremation the evidence of\r\nrace is inadequate. The Hallstatt population was undoubtedly mixed, and\r\nat Glasinatz in Bosnia, another site of Hallstatt civilisation, about a\r\nquarter of the skulls examined were brachycephalic[106].\r\n\r\nTheir works, found in great abundance in the graves, especially of the\r\nBronze and Iron periods, but a detailed account of which belongs to the\r\nprovince of archaeology, interest us in many ways. The painted\r\nearthenware vases and incised metal-ware of all kinds enable the student\r\nto follow the progress of the arts of design and ornamentation in their\r\nupward development from the first tentative efforts of the prehistoric\r\nartist at pleasing effects. Human and animal figures, though rarely\r\ndepicted, occasionally afford a curious insight into the customs and\r\nfashions of the times. On a clay vessel, found in 1896 at Lahse in\r\nPosen, is figured a regular hunting scene, where we see men mounted on\r\nhorseback, or else on foot, armed with bow and arrow, pursuing the\r\nquarry (nobly-antlered stags), and returning to the penthouse after the\r\nchase[107]. The drawing is extremely primitive, but on that account all\r\nthe more instructive, showing in connection with analogous\r\nrepresentations on contemporary objects, how in prehistoric art such\r\nfigures tend to become conventionalised and purely ornamental, as in\r\nsimilar designs on the vases and textiles from the Ancon Necropolis,\r\nPeru. \"Most ornaments of primitive peoples, although to our eye they may\r\nseem merely geometrical and freely-invented designs, are in reality\r\nnothing more than degraded animal and human figures[108].\"\r\n\r\nThis may perhaps be the reason why so many of the drawings of the metal\r\nperiod appear so inferior to those of the cave-dwellers and of the\r\npresent Bushmen. They are often mere conventionalised reductions of\r\npictorial prototypes, comparable, for instance, to the characters of our\r\nalphabets, which are known to be degraded forms of earlier pictographs.\r\n\r\nOf the so-called \"Prehistoric Age\" it is obvious that no strict\r\ndefinition can be given. It comprises in a general way that vague period\r\nprior to all written records, dim memories of which--popular myths,\r\nfolklore, demi-gods[109], eponymous heroes[110], traditions of real\r\nevents[111]--lingered on far into historic times, and supplied ready to\r\nhand the copious materials afterwards worked up by the early poets,\r\nfounders of new religions, and later legislators.\r\n\r\nThat letters themselves, although not brought into general use, had\r\nalready been invented, is evident from the mere fact that all memory of\r\ntheir introduction beyond the vaguest traditions had died out before the\r\ndawn of history. The works of man, while in themselves necessarily\r\ncontinuous, stretched back to such an inconceivably remote past, that\r\neven the great landmarks in the evolution of human progress had long\r\nbeen forgotten by later generations.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was everywhere, in the New World as in the Old, amongst\r\nEastern as amongst Western Peoples. In the Chinese records the \"Age of\r\nthe Five Emperors\"--five, though nine are named--answers somewhat to our\r\nprehistoric epoch. It had its eponymous hero, Fu Hi, reputed founder of\r\nthe empire, who invented nets and snares for fishing and hunting, and\r\ntaught his people how to rear domestic animals. To him also is ascribed\r\nthe institution of marriage, and in his time Tsong Chi is supposed to\r\nhave invented the Chinese characters, symbols, not of sounds, but of\r\nobjects and ideas.\r\n\r\nThen came other benevolent rulers, who taught the people agriculture,\r\nestablished markets for the sale of farm produce, discovered the\r\nmedicinal properties of plants, wrote treatises on diseases and their\r\nremedies, studied astrology and astronomy, and appointed \"the Five\r\nObservers of the heavenly bodies.\"\r\n\r\nBut this epoch had been preceded by the \"Age of the Three [six] Rulers,\"\r\nwhen people lived in caves, ate wild fruits and uncooked food, drank the\r\nblood of animals and wore the skins of wild beasts (our Old Stone Age).\r\nLater they grew less rude, learned to obtain fire by friction, and built\r\nthemselves habitations of wood or foliage (our Early Neolithic Age).\r\nThus is everywhere revealed the background of sheer savagery, which lies\r\nbehind all human culture, while the \"Golden Age\" of the poets fades with\r\nthe \"Hesperides\" and Plato's \"Atlantis\" into the region of the fabulous.\r\n\r\nLittle need here be said of strictly historic times, the most\r\ncharacteristic feature of which is perhaps the general use of letters.\r\nBy means of this most fruitful of human inventions, everything worth\r\npreserving was perpetuated, and thus all useful knowledge tended to\r\nbecome accumulative. It is no longer possible to say when or where the\r\nmiracle was wrought by which the apparently multifarious sounds of\r\nfully-developed languages were exhaustively analysed and effectively\r\nexpressed by a score or so of arbitrary signs. But a comparative study\r\nof the various writing-systems in use in different parts of the world\r\nhas revealed the process by which the transition was gradually brought\r\nabout from rude pictorial representations of objects to purely\r\nphonetical symbols.\r\n\r\nAs is clearly shown by the \"winter counts\" of the North American\r\naborigines, and by the prehistoric rock carvings in Upper Egypt, the\r\nfirst step was a _pictograph_, the actual figure, say, of a man,\r\nstanding for a given man, and then for any man or human being. Then this\r\nfigure, more or less reduced or conventionalised, served to indicate not\r\nonly the term _man_, but the full sound _man_, as in the word\r\n_manifest_, and in the modern rebus. At this stage it becomes a\r\n_phonogram_, or _phonoglyph_, which, when further reduced beyond all\r\nrecognition of its original form, may stand for the syllable _ma_ as in\r\n_ma-ny_, without any further reference either to the idea or the sound\r\nman. The phonogram has now become the symbol of a monosyllable, which is\r\nnormally made up of two elements, a consonant and a vowel, as in the\r\nDevanagari, and other syllabic systems.\r\n\r\nLastly, by dropping the second or vowel element the same symbol, further\r\nmodified or not, becomes a _letter_ representing the sound _m_, that is,\r\none of the few ultimate elements of articulate speech. A more or less\r\ncomplete set of such characters, thus worn down in form and meaning,\r\nwill then be available for indicating more or less completely all the\r\nphonetic elements of any given language. It will be a true _alphabet_,\r\nthe wonderful nature of which may be inferred from the fact that only\r\ntwo, or possibly three, such alphabetic systems are known with absolute\r\ncertainty to have ever been independently evolved by human\r\ningenuity[112]. From the above exposition we see how inevitably the\r\nPhoenician parent of nearly all late alphabets expressed at first the\r\nconsonantal sounds only, so that the vowels or vowel marks are in all\r\ncases later developments, as in Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Greek, the\r\nItalic group, and the Runes.\r\n\r\nIn primitive systems, such as the Egyptian, Sumerian, Chinese,\r\nMaya-Quiche and Mexican, one or more of the various transitional steps\r\nmay be developed and used simultaneously, with a constant tendency to\r\nadvance on the lines above indicated, by gradual substitution of the\r\nlater for the earlier stages. A comparison of the Sumerian cuneiform and\r\nEgyptian hieroglyphic systems brings out some curious results. Thus at\r\nan extremely remote epoch, some millenniums ago, the Sumerians had\r\nalready got rid of the pictorial, and to a great extent of the\r\nideographic, but had barely reached the alphabetic phase. Consequently\r\ntheir cuneiform groups, although possessing phonetic value, mainly\r\nexpress full syllables, scarcely ever letters, and rarely complete\r\nwords. Ideographs had given place first to phonograms and then to mere\r\nsyllables, \"complex syllables in which several consonants may be\r\ndistinguished, or simple syllables composed of only one consonant and\r\none vowel or _vice versa_[113].\"\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians, on the other hand, carried the system right through the\r\nwhole gamut from pictures to letters, but retained all the intermediate\r\nphases, the initial tending to fall away, the final to expand, while the\r\nbulk of the hieroglyphs represented in various degrees the several\r\ntransitional states. In many cases they \"had kept only one part of the\r\nsyllable, namely a mute consonant; they detached, for instance, the\r\nfinal _u_ from _bu_ and _pu_, and gave only the values _b_ and _p_ to\r\nthe human leg [Hieroglyph Symbol] and to the mat [Hieroglyph Symbol].\r\nThe peoples of the Euphrates stopped half way, and admitted actual\r\nletters for the vowel sounds _a_, _i_ and _u_ only[114].\"\r\n\r\nIn the process of evolution, metaphor and analogy of course played a\r\nlarge part, as in the evolution of language itself. Thus a lion might\r\nstand both for the animal and for courage, and so on. The first essays\r\nin phonetics took somewhat the form of a modern rebus, thus: [Hieroglyph\r\nSymbol] = _khau_ = sieve, [Hieroglyph Symbol] = _pu_ = mat; [Hieroglyph\r\nSymbol] = _ru_ = mouth, whence [Hieroglyph Symbol] = _kho-pi-ru_ = to\r\nbe, where the sounds and not the meaning of the several components are\r\nalone attended to[115].\r\n\r\nBy analogous processes was formed a true alphabet, in which, however,\r\neach of the phonetic elements was represented at first by several\r\ndifferent characters derived from several different words having the\r\nsame initial syllable. Here was, therefore, an _embarras de richesses_,\r\nwhich could be got rid of only by a judicious process of elimination,\r\nthat is, by discarding all like-sounding symbols but one for the same\r\nsound. When this final process of reduction was completed by the\r\nscribes, in other words, when all the phonetic signs were rejected\r\nexcept 23, _i.e._ one for each of the 23 phonetic elements, the\r\nPhoenician alphabet as we now have it was completed. Such may be taken\r\nas the real origin of this system, whether the scribes in question were\r\nBabylonians, Egyptians, Minaeans, or Europeans, that is, whether the\r\nPhoenician alphabet had a cuneiform, a hieroglyphic, a South Arabian, a\r\nCretan (Aegean), Ligurian or Iberian origin, for all these and perhaps\r\nother peoples have been credited with the invention. The time is not\r\nyet ripe for deciding between these rival claimants[116].\r\n\r\nBut whatever be the source of the Phoenician, that of the Persian system\r\ncurrent under the Achaemenides is clear enough. It is a true alphabet of\r\n37 characters, derived by some selective process directly from the\r\nBabylonian cuneiforms, without any attempt at a modification of their\r\nshapes. Hence although simple compared with its prototype, it is clumsy\r\nenough compared with the Phoenician script, several of the letters\r\nrequiring groups of as many as four or even five \"wedges\" for their\r\nexpression. None of the other cuneiform systems also derived from the\r\nSumerian (the Assyrian, Elamite, Vannic, Medic) appear to have reached\r\nthe pure alphabetic state, all being still encumbered with numerous\r\ncomplex syllabic characters. The subjoined table, for which I have to\r\nthank T. G. Pinches, will help to show the genesis of the cuneiform\r\ncombinations from the earliest known pictographs. These pictographs\r\nthemselves are already reduced to the merest outlines of the original\r\npictorial representations. But no earlier forms, showing the gradual\r\ntransition from the primitive picture writing to the degraded\r\npictographs here given, have yet come to light[117].\r\n\r\nHere it may be asked, What is to be thought of the already-mentioned\r\npebble-markings from the Mas-d'Azil Cave at the close of the Old Stone\r\nAge? If they are truly phonetic, then we must suppose that palaeolithic\r\nman not only invented an alphabetic writing system, but did this right\r\noff by intuition, as it were, without any previous knowledge of letters.\r\nAt least no one will suggest that the Dordogne cave-dwellers were\r\nalready in possession of pictographic or other crude systems, from which\r\nthe Mas-d'Azil \"script\" might have been slowly evolved. Yet E. Piette,\r\nwho groups these pebbles, painted with peroxide of iron, in the four\r\ncategories of numerals, symbols, pictographs, and alphabetical\r\ncharacters, states, in reference to these last, that 13 out of 23\r\nPhoenician characters were equally Azilian graphic signs. He even\r\nsuggests that there may be an approach to an inscription in one group,\r\nwhere, however, the mark indicating a stop implies a script running\r\nSemitic-fashion from right to left, whereas the letters themselves seem\r\nto face the other way[118]. G. G. MacCurdy[119], who accepts the\r\nevidence for the existence of writing in Azilian, if not in Magdalenian\r\ntimes, notes the close similarity between palaeolithic signs and\r\nPhoenician, ancient Greek and Cypriote letters. But J. Dechelette[120],\r\nreviewing (pp. 234, 236) the arguments against Piette's claims, points\r\nout in conclusion (p. 320) the impossibility of admitting that the\r\npopulation of Gaul could suddenly lose so beneficial a discovery as that\r\nof writing. Yet thousands of years elapse before the earliest appearance\r\nof epigraphic monuments.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EVOLUTION OF THE SUMERIAN CUNEIFORMS.]\r\n\r\nA possible connection has been suggested by Sergi between the Mas-d'Azil\r\nsigns and the markings that have been discovered on the megalithic\r\nmonuments of North Africa, Brittany, and the British Isles. These are\r\nall so rudimentary that resemblances are inevitable, and of themselves\r\nafford little ground for necessary connections. Primitive man is but a\r\nchild, and all children bawl and scrawl much in the same way.\r\nNevertheless C. Letourneau[121] has taken the trouble to compare five\r\nsuch scrawls from \"Libyan inscriptions\" now in the Bardo Museum, Tunis,\r\nwith similar or identical signs on Brittany and Irish dolmens. There is\r\nthe familiar circle plain and dotted [Symbol] [Symbol], the cross in its\r\nsimplest form [Symbol], the pothook and segmented square [Symbol], all\r\nof which recur in the Phoenician, Keltiberian, Etruscan, Libyan or\r\nTuareg systems. Letourneau, however, who does not call them letters but\r\nonly \"signes alphabetiformes,\" merely suggests that, if not phonetic\r\nmarks when first carved on the neolithic monuments, they may have become\r\nso in later times. Against this it need only be urged that in later\r\ntimes all these peoples were supplied with complete alphabetic systems\r\nfrom the East as soon as they required them. By that time all the\r\npeoples of the culture-zone were well-advanced into the historic period,\r\nand had long forgotten the rude carvings of their neolithic forefathers.\r\n\r\nArmed with a nearly perfect writing system, and the correlated cultural\r\nappliances, the higher races soon took a foremost place in the general\r\nprogress of mankind, and gradually acquired a marked ascendancy, not\r\nonly over the less cultured populations of the globe, but in large\r\nmeasure over the forces of nature herself. With the development of\r\nnavigation and improved methods of locomotion, inland seas, barren\r\nwastes, and mountain ranges ceased to be insurmountable obstacles to\r\ntheir movements, which within certain limits have never been arrested\r\nthroughout all recorded time.\r\n\r\nThus, during the long ages following the first peopling of the earth by\r\npleistocene man, fresh settlements and readjustments have been\r\ncontinually in progress, although wholesale displacements must be\r\nregarded as rare events. With few exceptions, the later migrations,\r\nwhether hostile or peaceful, were, for reasons already stated[122],\r\ngenerally of a partial character, while certain insular regions, such as\r\nAmerica and Australia, remained little affected by such movements till\r\nquite recent times. But for the inhabitants of the eastern hemisphere\r\nthe results were none the less far-reaching. Continuous infiltrations\r\ncould not fail ultimately to bring about great modifications of early\r\ntypes, while the ever-active principle of convergence tended to produce\r\na general uniformity amongst the new amalgams. Thus the great varietal\r\ndivisions, though undergoing slow changes from age to age, continued,\r\nlike all other zoological groups, to maintain a distinct regional\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nFlinders Petrie has acutely observed that the only meaning the term\r\n\"race\" now can have is that of a group of human beings, whose type has\r\nbecome unified by their rate of assimilation exceeding the rate of\r\nchange produced by foreign elements[123]. We are also reminded by\r\nGustavo Tosti that \"in the actual state of science the word 'race' is a\r\nvague formula, to which nothing definite may be found to correspond. On\r\nthe one hand, the original races can only be said to belong to\r\npalaeontology, while the more limited groups, now called races, are\r\nnothing but peoples, or societies of peoples, brethren by civilization\r\nmore than by blood. The race thus conceived ends by identifying itself\r\nwith nationality[124].\" Hence it has been asked why, on the principle of\r\nconvergence, a fusion of various races, if isolated long enough in a\r\ngiven area, may not eventually lead to a new racial type, without\r\nleaving any trace of its manifold origin[125].\r\n\r\nSuch new racial types would be normal for the later varietal groups,\r\njust as the old types were normal for the earlier groups, and a general\r\napplication might be given to Topinard's famous dictum that _les peuples\r\nseuls sont des realites_[126], that is, peoples alone--groups occupying\r\ndefinite geographical areas--have an objective existence. Thus, the\r\nnotion of race, as a zoological expression in the sense of a pure breed\r\nor strain, falls still more into the background, and, as Virchow aptly\r\nremarks, \"this term, which always implied something vague, has in recent\r\ntimes become in the highest degree uncertain[127].\"\r\n\r\nHence Ehrenreich treats the present populations of the earth rather as\r\nzoological groups which have been developed in their several\r\ngeographical domains, and are to be distinguished not so much by their\r\nbony structure as by their external characters, such as hair, colour,\r\nand expression, and by their habitats and languages. None of these\r\nfactors can be overlooked, but it would seem that the character of the\r\nhair forms the most satisfactory basis for a classification of mankind,\r\nand this has therefore been adopted for the new edition of the present\r\nwork. It has the advantage of simplicity, without involving, or even\r\nimplying, any particular theory of racial or geographical origins. It\r\nhas stood the test of time, being proposed by Bory de Saint Vincent in\r\n1827, and adopted by Huxley, Haeckel, Broca, Topinard and many others.\r\n\r\nThe three main varieties of hair are the _straight_, the _wavy_ and the\r\nso-called _woolly_, termed respectively _Leiotrichous_, _Cymotrichous_\r\nand _Ulotrichous_[128]. Straight hair usually falls straight down,\r\nthough it may curl at the ends, it is generally coarse and stiff, and is\r\ncircular in section. Wavy hair is undulating, forming long curves or\r\nimperfect spirals, or closer rings or curls, and the section is more or\r\nless elliptical. Woolly hair is characterised by numerous, close, often\r\ninterlocking spirals, 1-9 mm. in diameter, the section giving the form\r\nof a lengthened ellipse. Straight hair is usually the longest, and\r\nwoolly hair the shortest, wavy hair occupying an intermediate position.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEME OF CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n    I.

Mutual\r\nencroachments and interpenetrations have probably been continuous, and\r\nindeed are still going on. Yet so marked is the difference between the\r\ntwo groups, and such is the tenacity with which each clings to its\r\nproper domain, that, despite any very distinct geographical frontiers,\r\nthe ethnological parting line may still be detected. Obliterated at one\r\nor two points, and at others set back always in favour of the higher\r\ndivision, it may be followed from the Atlantic coast along the course of\r\nthe Senegal river east by north to the great bend of the Niger at\r\nTimbuktu; then east by south to Lake Chad, beyond which it runs nearly\r\ndue east to Khartum, at the confluence of the White and Blue Niles.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the now isolated Negro groups (Base and Barea), on the\r\nnorthern slope of the Abyssinian plateau, show that the original\r\nboundary was at first continued still east to the Red Sea at or about\r\nMassowa. But for many ages the line appears to have been deflected from\r\nKhartum along the White Nile south to the Sobat confluence, then\r\ncontinuously south-eastwards round by the Sobat Valley to the Albert\r\nNyanza, up the Somerset Nile to the Victoria Nyanza, and thence with a\r\nconsiderable southern bend round Masailand eastwards to the Indian Ocean\r\nat the equator.\r\n\r\nAll the land north of this irregular line belongs to the Hamito-Semitic\r\nsection of the Caucasic division, all south of it to the western\r\n(African) section of the Ulotrichous division. Throughout this\r\nregion--which comprises the whole of Sudan from the Atlantic to the\r\nWhite Nile, and all south of Sudan except Abyssinia, Galla, Somali and\r\nMasai lands--the African Negro, clearly, distinguished from the other\r\nmain groups by the above summarised physical[130] and mental qualities,\r\nlargely predominates everywhere and in many places exclusively. The\r\nroute by which he probably reached these intertropical lands, where he\r\nmay be regarded as practically indigenous, has been indicated in\r\n_Ethnology_, Chs. X. and XI.\r\n\r\nAs regards the date of this occupation, nothing can be clearly proved.\r\n\"The history of Africa reaches back but a short distance, except, of\r\ncourse, as far as the lower Nile Valley and Roman Africa is concerned;\r\nelsewhere no records exist, save tribal traditions, and these only\r\nrelate to very recent events. Even archaeology, which can often sketch\r\nthe main outlines of a people's history, is here practically powerless,\r\nowing to the insufficiency of data. It is true that stone implements of\r\npalaeolithic and neolithic types are found sporadically in the Nile\r\nValley[131], Somaliland, on the Zambesi, in Cape Colony and the northern\r\nportions of the Congo Free State, as well as in Algeria and Tunisia; but\r\nthe localities are far too few and too widely separated to warrant the\r\ninference that they are to be in any way connected. Moreover, where\r\nstone implements are found they are, as a rule, very near, even actually\r\non, the surface of the earth,\" and they are rarely, if ever, found in\r\nassociation with bones of extinct animals. \"Nothing occurs resembling\r\nthe regular stratification of Europe, and consequently no argument based\r\non geological grounds is possible[132].\" The exceptions are the lower\r\nNile and Zambesi where true palaeoliths have been found not only on the\r\nsurface (which in this case is not inconsistent with great antiquity)\r\nbut also in stratified gravel. Implements of palaeolithic _type_ are\r\ndoubtless common, and may be compared to Chellean, Mousterian and even\r\nSolutrian specimens[133], but primitive culture is not necessarily\r\npleistocene. Ancient forms persisted in Egypt down to the historic\r\nperiod, and even patination is no sure test of age, so until further\r\nevidence is found the antiquity of man in Africa must remain\r\nundecided[134].\r\n\r\nYet since some remote if undated epoch the specialised Negro type, as\r\ndepicted on the Egyptian monuments some thousands of years ago[135], has\r\neverywhere been maintained with striking uniformity. \"Within this wide\r\ndomain of the black Negro there is a remarkably general similarity of\r\ntype.... If you took a Negro from the Gold Coast of West Africa and\r\npassed him off amongst a number of Nyasa natives, and if he were not\r\nremarkably distinguished from them by dress or tribal marks, it would\r\nnot be easy to pick him out[136].\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless considerable differences are perceptible to the practised\r\neye, and the contrasts are sufficiently marked to justify ethnologists\r\nin treating the _Sudanese_ and the _Bantu_ as two distinct subdivisions\r\nof the family. In both groups the relatively full-blood natives are\r\neverywhere very much alike, and the contrasts are presented chiefly\r\namongst the mixed or Negroid populations. In Sudan the disturbing\r\nelements are both Hamitic (Berbers and Tuaregs) and Semitic (Arabs);\r\nwhile in Bantuland they are mainly Hamitic (Galla) in all the central\r\nand southern districts, and Arabs on the eastern seaboard from the\r\nequator to Sofala beyond the Zambesi. To the varying proportions of\r\nthese several ingredients may perhaps be traced the often very marked\r\ndifferences observable on the one hand between such Sudanese peoples as\r\nthe Wolof, Mandingans, Hausa, Nubians, Zandeh[137], and Mangbattu, and\r\non the other between all these and the Swahili, Baganda, Zulu-Xosa,\r\nBe-Chuana, Ova-Herero and some other Negroid Bantu.\r\n\r\nBut the distinction is based on social, linguistic, and cultural, as\r\nwell as on physical grounds, so that, as at present constituted, the\r\nSudanese and Bantu really constitute two tolerably well-defined branches\r\nof the Negro family. Thanks to Muhammadan influences, the former have\r\nattained a much higher level of culture. They cultivate not only the\r\nalimentary but also the economic plants, such as cotton and indigo; they\r\nbuild stone dwellings, walled towns, substantial mosques and minarets;\r\nthey have founded powerful states, such as those of the Hausa and\r\nSonghai, of Ghana and Bornu, with written records going back a thousand\r\nyears, although these historical peoples are all without exception\r\nhalf-breeds, often with more Semitic and Hamitic than Negro blood in\r\ntheir veins.\r\n\r\nNo such cultured peoples are anywhere to be found in Bantuland except on\r\nthe east coast, where the \"Moors\" founded great cities and flourishing\r\nmarts centuries before the appearance of the Portuguese in the eastern\r\nseas. Among the results of the gold trade with these coastal settlements\r\nmay be classed the Zimbabwe monuments and other ruins explored by\r\nTheodore Bent in the mining districts south of the Zambesi. But in all\r\nthe Negro lands free from foreign influences no true culture has ever\r\nbeen developed, and here cannibalism, witchcraft, and sanguinary\r\n\"customs\" are often still rife, or have been but recently suppressed by\r\nthe direct action of European administrations.\r\n\r\nNumberless authorities have described the Negro as unprogressive, or, if\r\nleft to himself, incapable of progress in his present physical\r\nenvironment. Sir H. H. Johnston, who knows him well, goes much further,\r\nand speaks of him as a fine animal, who, \"in his wild state, exhibits a\r\nstunted mind and a dull content with his surroundings, which induces\r\nmental stagnation, cessation of all upward progress, and even\r\nretrogression towards the brute. In some respects I think the tendency\r\nof the Negro for several centuries past has been an actual retrograde\r\none[138].\"\r\n\r\nThere is one point in which the Bantu somewhat unaccountably compare\r\nfavourably with the Sudanese. In all other regions the spread of culture\r\nhas tended to bring about linguistic unity, as we see in the Hellenic\r\nworld, where all the old idioms were gradually absorbed in the \"common\r\ndialect\" of the Byzantine empire, again in the Roman empire, where Latin\r\nbecame the universal speech of the West, and lastly in the Muhammadan\r\ncountries, where most of the local tongues have nearly everywhere,\r\nexcept in Sudan, disappeared before the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nBut in Negroland the case is reversed, and here the less cultured Bantu\r\npopulations all, without any known exception, speak dialects of a single\r\nmother-tongue, while the greatest linguistic confusion prevails amongst\r\nthe semi-civilised as well as the savage peoples of Sudan.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Bantu language may, as some suppose[139], have originated\r\nin the north and spread southwards to the Congo, Zambesi, and Limpopo\r\nbasins, it cannot now be even remotely affiliated to any one of the\r\nnumerous distinct forms of speech current in the Sudanese domain. Hence\r\nto allow time for its diffusion over half the continent, the initial\r\nmovement must be assigned to an extremely remote epoch, and a\r\ncorresponding period of great duration must be postulated for the\r\nprofound linguistic disintegration that is everywhere witnessed in the\r\nregion between the Atlantic and Abyssinia. Here agglutination, both with\r\nprefixed and postfixed particles, is the prevailing morphological order,\r\nas in the Mandingan, Fulah, Nubian, Dinkan, and Mangbattu groups. But\r\nevery shade of transition is also presented between true agglutination\r\nand inflection of the Hamito-Semitic types, as in Hausa, Kanuri, Kanem,\r\nDasa or Southern and Teda or Northern Tibu[140].\r\n\r\nElsewhere, and especially in Upper Guinea, the originally agglutinating\r\ntongues have developed on lines analogous to those followed by Tibetan,\r\nBurmese, Chinese, and Otomi in other continents, with corresponding\r\nresults. Thus the Tshi, Ewe, and Yoruba, surviving members of a now\r\nextinct stock-language, formerly diffused over the whole region between\r\nCape Palmas and the Niger Delta, have become so burdened with\r\nmonosyllabic homophones (like-sounding monosyllables), that to indicate\r\ntheir different meanings several distinguishing tones have been evolved,\r\nexactly as in the Indo-Chinese group. In Ewe (Slave Coast) the root\r\n_do_, according as it is toned may mean to put, let go, tell, kick, be\r\nsad, join, change, grow big, sleep, prick, or grind. So great are the\r\nravages of phonetic decay, that new expedients have been developed to\r\nexpress quite simple ideas, as in Tshi (Gold Coast) _addanmu_, room\r\n(_addan_ house, _mu_ interior); _akwancherifo_, a guide (_akwan_ road,\r\n_cheri_ to show, _fo_ person); _ensahtsiabah_, finger (_ensah_ hand,\r\n_tsia_ small, _abbah_ child = hand's-little-child); but middle-finger =\r\n\"hand's-little-chief\" (_ensahtsiahin_, where _ehin_ chief takes the\r\nplace of _abbah_ child[141]).\r\n\r\nCommon both to Sudanese and Bantus, especially about the western\r\nborderlands (Upper Guinea, Cameruns, etc.) is the \"drum-language,\" which\r\naffords a striking illustration of the Negro's musical faculty. \"Two or\r\nthree drums are usually used together, each producing a different note,\r\nand they are played either with the fingers or with two sticks. The\r\nlookers-on generally beat time by clapping the hands. To a European,\r\nwhose ear and mind are untrained for this special faculty, the rhythm\r\nof a drum expresses nothing beyond a repetition of the same note at\r\ndifferent intervals of time; but to a native it expresses much more. To\r\nhim the drum can and does speak, the sounds produced from it forming\r\nwords, and the whole measure or rhythm a sentence. In this way, when\r\ncompany drums are being played at an _ehsadu_ [palaver], they are made\r\nto express and convey to the bystanders a variety of meanings. In one\r\nmeasure they abuse the men of another company, stigmatising them as\r\nfools and cowards; then the rhythm changes, and the gallant deeds of\r\ntheir own company are extolled. All this, and much more, is conveyed by\r\nthe beating of drums, and the native ear and mind, trained to select and\r\ninterpret each beat, is never at fault. The language of drums is as well\r\nunderstood as that which they use in their daily life. Each chief has\r\nhis own call or motto, sounded by a particular beat of his drums. Those\r\nof Amankwa Tia, the Ashanti general who fought against us in the war of\r\n1873-4, used to say _P[)i]r[)i]h[=u]h_, hasten. Similar mottoes are also\r\nexpressed by means of horns, and an entire stranger in the locality can\r\nat once translate the rhythm into words[142].\"\r\n\r\nSimilar contrasts and analogies will receive due illustration in the\r\ndetailed account here following of the several more representative\r\nSudanese groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST SUDANESE.\r\n\r\n_Wolofs._ Throughout its middle and lower course the Senegal river,\r\nwhich takes its name from the Zenaga Berbers, forms the ethnical\r\n\"divide\" between the Hamites and the Sudanese Negroes. The latter are\r\nhere represented by the Wolofs, who with the kindred _Jolofs_ and\r\n_Serers_ occupy an extensive territory between the Senegal and the\r\nGambia rivers. Whether the term \"Wolof\" means \"Talkers,\" as if they\r\nalone were gifted with the faculty of speech, or \"Blacks\" in contrast to\r\nthe neighbouring \"Red\" Fulahs, both interpretations are fully justified\r\nby these Senegambians, at once the very blackest and amongst the most\r\ngarrulous tribes in the whole of Africa. The colour is called \"ebony,\"\r\nand they are commonly spoken of as \"Blacks of the Black.\" They are also\r\nvery tall even for Negroes, and the Serers especially may claim to be\r\n\"the Patagonians of the Old World,\" men six feet six inches high and\r\nproportionately muscular being far from rare in the coast districts\r\nabout St Louis and Dakar.\r\n\r\nTheir language, which is widespread throughout Senegambia, may be taken\r\nas a typical Sudanese form of speech, unlike any other in its peculiar\r\nagglutinative structure, and unaffected even in its vocabulary by the\r\nHamitic which has been current for ages on the opposite bank of the\r\nSenegal. A remarkable feature is the so-called \"article,\" always\r\npostfixed and subject to a two-fold series of modifications, first in\r\naccordance with the initial consonant of the noun, for which there are\r\nsix possible consonantal changes (_w_, _m_, _b_, _d_, _s_, _g_), and\r\nthen according as the object is present, near, not near, and distant,\r\nfor which there are again four possible vowel changes (_i_, _u_, _o_,\r\n_a_), or twenty-four altogether, a tremendous redundancy of useless\r\nvariants as compared with the single English form _the_. Thus this\r\nProtean particle begins with _b_, _d_ or _w_ to agree with _baye_,\r\nfather, _digene_, woman, or _fos_, horse, and then becomes _bi_, _bu_,\r\n_bo_, _ba_; _di_, _du_ etc.; _wi_, _wu_ etc. to express the presence and\r\nthe varying distances of these objects: _baye-bi_ = father-the-here;\r\n_baye-bu_ = father-the-there; _baye-bo_ = father-the-yonder; _baye-ba_ =\r\nfather-the-away in the distance.\r\n\r\nAll this is curious enough; but the important point is that it probably\r\ngives us the clue to the enigmatic alliterative system of the Bantu\r\nlanguages as explained in _Ethnology_, p. 273, the position of course\r\nbeing reversed. Thus as in Zulu _in_- kose requires _en_- kulu, so in\r\nWolof _baye_ requires _bi_, _di_gene _di_, and so on. There are other\r\nindications that the now perfected Bantu grew out of analogous but less\r\ndeveloped processes still prevalent in the Sudanese tongues.\r\n\r\nEqually undeveloped is the Wolof process of making earthenware, as\r\nobserved by M. F. Regnault amongst the natives brought to Paris for the\r\nExhibition of 1895. He noticed how one of the women utilised a somewhat\r\ndeep bowl resting on the ground in such a way as to be easily spun round\r\nby the hand, thus illustrating the transition between hand-made and\r\nturned pottery. Kneading a lump of clay, and thrusting it into the\r\nbowl, after sprinkling the sides with some black dust to prevent\r\nsticking, she made a hollow in the mass, enlarging and pressing it\r\nagainst the bowl with the back of the fingers bent in, the hand being\r\nall the time kept in a vertical position. At the same time the bowl was\r\nspun round with the left palm, this movement combined with the pressure\r\nexerted by the right hand causing the sides of the vessel to rise and\r\ntake shape. When high enough it was finished off by thickening the clay\r\nto make a rim. This was held in the right hand and made fast to the\r\nmouth of the vessel by the friction caused by again turning the bowl\r\nwith the left hand. This transitional process is frequently met with in\r\nAfrica[143].\r\n\r\nMost of the Wolofs profess themselves Muhammadans, the rest Catholics,\r\nwhile all alike are heathen at heart; only the former have charms with\r\ntexts from the Koran which they cannot read, and the latter medals and\r\nscapulars of the \"Seven Dolours\" or of the Trinity, which they cannot\r\nunderstand. Many old rites still flourish, the household gods are not\r\nforgotten, and for the lizard, most popular of tutelar deities, the\r\ncustomary milk-bowl is daily replenished. Glimpses are thus afforded of\r\nthe totemic system which still survives in a modified form amongst the\r\nBe-Chuana, the Mandingans, and several other African peoples, but has\r\nelsewhere mostly died out in Negroland. The infantile ideas associated\r\nwith plant and animal totem tokens have been left far behind, when a\r\npeople like the Serers have arrived at such a lofty conception as\r\nTakhar, god of justice, or even the more materialistic Tiurakh, god of\r\nwealth, although the latter may still be appealed to for success in\r\nnefarious projects which he himself might scarcely be expected to\r\ncountenance. But the harmony between religious and ethical thought has\r\nscarcely yet been reached even amongst some of the higher races.\r\n\r\n_Mandingans._ In the whole of Sudan there is scarcely a more numerous or\r\nwidespread people than the Mandingans, who--with their endless\r\nramifications, _Kassonke_, _Jallonke_, _Soninke_, _Bambara_, _Vei_ and\r\nmany others--occupy most of the region between the Atlantic and the\r\nJoliba (Upper Niger) basin, as far south as about 9 deg. N. latitude. Within\r\nthese limits it is often difficult to say who are, or who are not\r\nmembers of this great family, whose various branches present all the\r\ntransitional shades of physical type and culture grades between the true\r\npagan Negro and the Muhammadan Negroid Sudanese.\r\n\r\nEven linguistic unity exists only to a limited extent, as the numerous\r\ndialects of the Mande stock-language have often diverged so greatly as\r\nto constitute independent tongues quite unintelligible to the\r\nneighbouring tribes. The typical Mandingans, however--Faidherbe's\r\nMalinka-Soninke group--may be distinguished from the surrounding\r\npopulations by their more softened features, broader forehead, larger\r\nnose, fuller beard, and lighter colour. They are also distinguished by\r\ntheir industrious habits and generally higher culture, being rivalled by\r\nfew as skilled tillers of the soil, weavers, and workers in iron and\r\ncopper. They thus hold much the same social position in the west that\r\nthe Hausa do in the central region beyond the Niger, and the French\r\nauthorities think that \"they are destined to take a position of ever\r\nincreasing importance in the pacified Sudan of the future[144].\"\r\n\r\nThus history brings about its revenges, for the Mandingans proper of the\r\nKong plateau may fairly claim, despite their late servitude to the Fulah\r\nconquerors and their present ready acceptance of French rule, to be a\r\nhistorical people with a not inglorious record of over 1000 years, as\r\nfounders of the two great empires of Melle and Guine, and of the more\r\nrecent states of Moasina, Bambara, Kaarta, Kong, and others about the\r\nwater-parting between the head-streams of the Niger, and the rivers\r\nflowing south to the Gulf of Guinea. Here is the district of Manding,\r\nwhich is the original home of the _Manding'ke_, _i.e._ \"People of\r\nManding,\" as they are generally called, although _Mande_ appears to be\r\nthe form used by themselves[145]. Here also was the famous city of Mali\r\nor Melle, from which the Upper Niger group take the name of _Mali'nke_,\r\nin contradistinction to the _Soni'nke_ of the Senegal river, the\r\n_Jalo'nke_ of Futa-Jallon, and the _Bamana_ of Bambara, these being the\r\nmore important historical and cultured groups.\r\n\r\nAccording to native tradition and the annals of Ahmed Baba, rescued from\r\noblivion by Barth[146], the first Mandingan state of Guine (Ghana,\r\nGhanata), a name still surviving in the vague geographical term\r\n\"Guinea,\" goes back to pre-Muhammadan times. Wakayamangha, its legendary\r\nfounder, is supposed to have flourished 300 years before the Hejira, at\r\nwhich date twenty-two kings had already reigned. Sixty years after that\r\ntime the Moslem Arabs or Berbers are said to have already reached West\r\nSudan, where they had twelve mosques in Ghana, first capital of the\r\nempire, and their chief stronghold till the foundation of Jinni on the\r\nUpper Niger (1043 A.D.).\r\n\r\nTwo centuries later (1235-60) the centre of the Mandingan rule was\r\ntransferred to Mali, which under the great king Mansa-Musa (1311-31)\r\nbecame the most powerful Sudanese state of which there is any authentic\r\nrecord. For a time it included nearly the whole of West Sudan, and a\r\ngreat part of the western Sahara, beside the Songhai State with its\r\ncapital Gogo, and Timbuktu. Mansa-Musa, who, in the language of the\r\nchronicler, \"wielded a power without measure or limits,\" entered into\r\nfriendly relations with the emperor of Morocco, and made a famous\r\npilgrimage to Mecca, the splendours of which still linger in the memory\r\nof the Mussulman populations through whose lands the interminable\r\nprocession wound its way. He headed 60,000 men of arms, says Ahmed Baba,\r\nand wherever he passed he was preceded by 500 slaves, each bearing a\r\ngold stick weighing 500 mitkals (14 lbs.), the whole representing a\r\nmoney value of about L4,000,000 (?). The people of Cairo and Mecca were\r\ndazzled by his wealth and munificence; but during the journey a great\r\npart of his followers were seized by a painful malady called in their\r\nlanguage _tuat_, and this word still lives in the Oasis of Tuat, where\r\nmost of them perished.\r\n\r\nEven after the capture of Timbuktu by the Tuaregs (1433), Mali long\r\ncontinued to be the chief state in West Nigritia, and carried on a\r\nflourishing trade, especially in slaves and gold. But this gold was\r\nstill supposed to come from the earlier kingdom of Guine, which word\r\nconsequently still remains associated with the precious metal in the\r\npopular belief. About the year 1500 Mali was captured by the Songhai\r\nking, Omar Askia, after which the empire fell to pieces, and its memory\r\nnow survives only in the ethnical term _Mali'nke_.\r\n\r\n_Felups._ From the semi-civilised Muhammadan negroid Mandingans to the\r\nutterly savage full-blood Negro Felups the transition is abrupt, but\r\ninstructive. In other regions the heterogeneous ethnical groups crowded\r\ninto upland valleys, as in the Caucasus, have been called the \"sweepings\r\nof the plains.\" But in West Sudan there are no great ranges towering\r\nabove the lowlands, and even the \"Kong Mountains\" of school geographies\r\nhave now been wiped out by L. G. Binger[147]. Hence the rude aborigines\r\nof the inland plateau, retreating before the steady advance of Islam,\r\nfound no place of refuge till they reached the indented fjord-like\r\nAtlantic seaboard, where many still hold their ground. This is the\r\nexplanation of the striking contrasts now witnessed between the interior\r\nand so many parts of the West Coast; on the one hand powerful political\r\norganisations with numerous, more or less homogeneous, and\r\nsemi-civilised negroid populations, on the other an infinite tangle of\r\nethnical and linguistic groups, all alike weltering in the sheerest\r\nsavagery, or in grades of barbarism even worse than the wild state.\r\n\r\nEven the _Felups_, whose territory now stretches from the Gambia to the\r\nCacheo, but formerly reached the Geba and the Bissagos Islands, do not\r\nform a single group. Originally the name of an obscure coast-tribe, the\r\nterm Felup or Fulup has been extended by the Portuguese traders to all\r\nthe surrounding peoples--_Ayamats_, _Jolas_, _Jigushes_, _Vacas_,\r\n_Joats_, _Karons_, _Banyuns_, _Banjars_, _Fuluns_, _Bayots_ and some\r\nothers who amid much local diversity, presented a sufficiently general\r\noutward resemblance to be regarded as a single people by the first\r\nEuropean settlers. The Felups proper display the physical and mental\r\ncharacters of the typical Negro even in an exaggerated form--black\r\ncolour, flat nose, wide nostrils, very thick and everted lips, red on\r\nthe inner surface, stout muscular frame, correlated with coarse animal\r\npassions, crass ignorance, no arts, industry, or even tribal\r\norganisation, so that every little family group is independent and\r\nmostly in a state of constant feud with its neighbours. All go naked,\r\narmed with bow and arrow, and live in log huts which, though strongly\r\nbuilt, are indescribably filthy[148].\r\n\r\nMother-right frequently prevails, rank and property being transmitted in\r\nthe female line. There is some notion of a superhuman being vaguely\r\nidentified with the sky, the rain, wind or thunderstorm. But all live in\r\nextreme terror of the medicine-man, who is openly courted, but inwardly\r\ndetested, so that whenever it can be safely done the tables are turned,\r\nthe witch-doctor is seized and tortured to death.\r\n\r\n_Timni, Kru, Sierra-Leonese, Liberians._ Somewhat similar conditions\r\nprevail all along the seaboard from Sierra Leone to, and beyond, Cape\r\nPalmas, disturbed or modified by the Liberian intruders from the North\r\nAmerican plantations, and by the slaves rescued in the thirties and\r\nforties by the British cruisers and brought to Sierra Leone, where their\r\ndescendants now live in settled communities under European influences.\r\nThese \"coloured\" citizens of Sierra Leone and Liberia, who are so often\r\nthe butt of cheap ridicule, and are themselves perhaps too apt to scorn\r\nthe kindred \"niggers\" of the bush, have to be carefully distinguished\r\nfrom these true aborigines who have never been wrenched from their\r\nnatural environment.\r\n\r\nIn Sierra Leone the chief aboriginal groups on the coastlands are the\r\n_Timni_ of the Rokelle river, flanked north and south by two branches of\r\nthe _Bulams_, and still further south the _Gallinas_, _Veys_ and\r\n_Golas_; in the interior the _Lokkos_, _Limbas_, _Konos_, and _Kussas_,\r\nwith _Kurankos_, _Mendis_, _Hubus_, and other Mandingans and Fulahs\r\neverywhere in the Hinterland.\r\n\r\nOf all these the most powerful during the British occupation have always\r\nbeen the Timni (Timani, Temne), who sold to the English the peninsula on\r\nwhich now stands Freetown, but afterwards crying off the bargain,\r\nrepeatedly tried to drive the white and coloured intruders into the\r\nsea. They are a robust people of softened Negro type, and more\r\nindustrious farmers than most of the other natives. Like the Wolofs they\r\nbelieve in the virtue both of Christian and Moslem amulets, but have\r\nhitherto lent a deaf ear to the preachers of both these religions.\r\nNevertheless the Protestant missionaries have carefully studied the\r\nTimni language, which possesses an oral literature rich in legends,\r\nproverbs, and folklore[149].\r\n\r\nThe Timni district is a chief centre of the so-called _porro_\r\nfraternity[150], a sort of secret society or freemasonry widely diffused\r\nthroughout the coastlands, and possessing its own symbols, skin\r\nmarkings, passwords, and language. It presents curious points of analogy\r\nwith the brotherhoods of the Micronesian islanders, but appears to be\r\neven more potent for good and evil, a veritable religious and political\r\nstate within the state. \"When their mandates are issued all wars and\r\ncivil strife must cease, a general truce is established, and bloodshed\r\nstopped, offending communities being punished by bands of armed men in\r\nmasks. Strangers cannot enter the country unless escorted by a member of\r\nthe guild, who is recognised by passwords, symbolic gestures, and the\r\nlike. Their secret rites are celebrated at night in the depths of the\r\nforest, all intruders being put to death or sold as slaves[151].\"\r\n\r\nIn studying the social conditions prevalent amongst the Sierra Leonese\r\nproper, it should be remembered that they are sprung, not only from\r\nrepresentatives of almost every tribe along the seaboard, and even in\r\nthe far interior, but also to a large extent from the freedmen and\r\nrunaways of Nova Scotia and London, besides many maroons of Jamaica, who\r\nwere settled here under the auspices of the Sierra Leone Company towards\r\nthe close of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\nOthers also have in recent years been attracted to the settlements from\r\nthe Timni and other tribes of the neighbouring districts. The Sierra\r\nLeonese are consequently not themselves a tribe, nor yet a people, but\r\nrather a people in course of formation under the influence of a new\r\nenvironment and of a higher culture. An immediate consequence of such a\r\nsudden aggregation of discordant elements was the loss of all the native\r\ntongues, and the substitution of English as the common medium of\r\nintercourse. But English is the language of a people standing on the\r\nvery highest plane of culture, and could not therefore be properly\r\nassimilated by the _disjecta membra_ of tribes at the lowest rung of the\r\nsocial ladder. The resultant form of speech may be called ludicrous, so\r\nludicrous that the Sierra Leonese version of the New Testament had to be\r\nwithdrawn from circulation as verging almost on the blasphemous[152].\r\n\r\nIt has also to be considered that all the old tribal relations were\r\nbroken up, while an attempt was made to merge these waifs and strays in\r\na single community based on social conditions to which each and all were\r\nutter strangers. It is not therefore surprising that the experiment has\r\nnot proved a complete success, and that the social relations in Sierra\r\nLeone leave something to be desired. Although the freedmen and the\r\nrescued captives received free gifts of land, their dislike for the\r\nlabours of the field induced many to abandon their holdings, and take to\r\nhuckstering and other more pleasant pursuits. Hence their descendants\r\nalmost monopolise the petty traffic and even the \"professions\" in\r\nFreetown and the other colonial settlements. Although accused of\r\nlaziness and dishonesty, they have displayed a considerable degree of\r\nindustrial as well as commercial enterprise, and the Sierra Leone\r\ncraftsmen--smiths, mechanics, carpenters, builders--enjoy a good\r\nreputation in all the coast towns. All are Christians of various\r\ndenominations, and even show a marked predilection for the \"ministry.\"\r\nYet below the surface the old paganism still slumbers, and vodoo\r\npractices, as in the West Indies and some of the Southern States, are\r\nstill heard of.\r\n\r\nMorality also is admittedly at a low ebb, and it is curious to note that\r\nthis has in part been attributed to the freedom enjoyed under the\r\nBritish administration. \"They have passed from the sphere of native law\r\nto that of British law, which is brought to this young community like an\r\narticle of ready-made clothing. Is it a wonder that the clothes do not\r\nfit? Is it a wonder that kings and chiefs around Sierra Leone, instead\r\nof wishing their people to come and see how well we do things, dread for\r\nthem to come to this colony on account of the danger to their morals? In\r\npassing into this colony, they pass into a liberty which to them is\r\nlicense[153].\"\r\n\r\nAn experiment of a somewhat different order, but with much the same\r\nnegative results, has been tried by the well-meaning founders of the\r\nRepublic of Liberia. Here also the bulk of the \"civilised aristocrats\"\r\nare descended of emancipated plantation slaves, a first consignment of\r\nwhom was brought over by a philanthropic American society in 1820-22.\r\nThe idea was to start them well in life under the fostering care of\r\ntheir white guardians, and then leave them to work out their own\r\nredemption in their own way. All control was accordingly withdrawn in\r\n1848, and since then the settlement has constituted an absolutely\r\nindependent Negro state in the enjoyment of complete self-government.\r\nProgress of a certain material kind was undoubtedly made. The original\r\n\"free citizens\" increased from 8000 in 1850 to perhaps 20,000 in\r\n1898[154], and the central administration, modelled on that of the\r\nUnited States, maintained some degree of order among the surrounding\r\naborigines, estimated at some two million within the limits of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nBut these aborigines have not benefited perceptibly by contact with\r\ntheir \"civilised\" neighbours, who themselves stand at much the same\r\nlevel intellectually and morally as their repatriated forefathers.\r\nInstead of attending to the proper administration of the Republic, the\r\n\"Weegee,\" as they are called, have constituted themselves into two\r\nfactions, the \"coloured\" or half-breeds, and the full-blood Negroes who,\r\nlike the \"Blancos\" and \"Neros\" of some South American States, spend most\r\nof their time in a perpetual struggle for office. All are of course\r\nintensely patriotic, but their patriotism takes a wrong direction, being\r\nchiefly manifested in their insolence towards the English and other\r\nEuropean traders on the coast, and in their supreme contempt for the\r\n\"stinking bush-niggers,\" as they call the surrounding aborigines. In\r\n1909 internal and external difficulties led to the appointment of a\r\nCommission by President Roosevelt with the result that the American\r\nGovernment took charge of the finances, military organisation,\r\nagriculture and boundary questions, besides arranging for a loan of\r\nL400,000. The able administration of President Barclay, a pure blooded\r\nNegro, though not of Liberian ancestry, is perhaps the happiest augury\r\nfor the future of the Republic[155].\r\n\r\nThe _Krus_ (Kroomen, Krooboys[156]), whose numerous hamlets are\r\nscattered along the coast from below Monrovia nearly to Cape Palmas, are\r\nassuredly one of the most interesting people in the whole of Africa.\r\nOriginally from the interior, they have developed in their new homes a\r\nmost un-African love of the sea, hence are regularly engaged as crews by\r\nthe European skippers plying along those insalubrious coastlands.\r\n\r\nIn this service, in which they are known by such nicknames as\r\n\"Bottle-of-Beer,\" \"Mashed-Potatoes,\" \"Bubble-and-Squeak,\"\r\n\"Pipe-of-Tobacco,\" and the like, their word may always be depended upon.\r\nBut it is to be feared that this loyalty, which with them is a strict\r\nmatter of business, has earned for them a reputation for other virtues\r\nto which they have little claim. Despite the many years that they have\r\nbeen in the closest contact with the missionaries and traders, they are\r\nstill at heart the same brutal savages as ever. After each voyage they\r\nreturn to the native village to spend all their gains and pilferings in\r\ndrunken orgies, and relapse generally into sheer barbarism till the next\r\nsteamer rounds the neighbouring headland. \"It is not a comfortable\r\nreflection,\" writes Bishop Ingham, whose testimony will not be suspected\r\nof bias, \"as we look at this mob on our decks, that, if the ship chance\r\nto strike on a sunken rock and become unmanageable, they would rise to a\r\nman, and seize all they could lay hands on, cut the very rings off our\r\nfingers if they could get them in no other way, and generally loot the\r\nship. Little has been done to Christianise these interesting,\r\nhard-working, cheerful, but ignorant and greedy people, who have so long\r\nhung on the skirts of civilisation[157].\"\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to the Kru to say that this unflattering picture of them\r\nstands alone. \"There is but one man of all of us who have visited West\r\nAfrica who has not paid a tribute to the Kruboy's sterling qualities,\"\r\nsays Miss Kingsley. Her opinion coincides with that of the old coasters\r\nbased on life-long experience, and she waxes indignant at the\r\ningratitude with which Kruboy loyalty is rewarded. \"They have devoted\r\nthemselves to us English, and they have suffered, laboured, fought, been\r\nmassacred and so on with us generation after generation.... Kruboys are,\r\nindeed, the backbone of white effort in West Africa[158].\"\r\n\r\nBut the very worst \"sweepings of the Sudanese plateau\" seem to have\r\ngathered along the Upper Guinea Coast, occupied by the already mentioned\r\n_Tshi_, _Ewe_, and _Yoruba_ groups[159]. They constitute three branches\r\nof one linguistic, and probably also of one ethnical family, of which,\r\nowing to their historic and ethnical importance, the reader may be glad\r\nto have here subjoined a somewhat complete tabulated scheme.\r\n\r\nThe _Ga_ of the Volta delta are here bracketed with the Tshi because A.\r\nB. Ellis, our great authority on the Guinea peoples[160], considers the\r\ntwo languages to be distantly connected. He also thinks there is a\r\nfoundation of fact in the native traditions, which bring the dominant\r\ntribes--Ashanti, Fanti, Dahomi, Yoruba, Bini--from the interior to the\r\ncoast districts at no very remote period. Thus it is recorded of the\r\nAshanti and Fanti, now hereditary foes, that ages ago they formed one\r\npeople who were reduced to the utmost distress during a long war with\r\nsome inland power, perhaps the conquering Muhammadans of the Ghana or\r\nMali empire. They were saved, however, some by eating of the _shan_,\r\nothers of the _fan_ plant, and of these words, with the verb _di_, \"to\r\neat,\" were made the tribal names _Shan-di_, _Fan-di_, now _Ashanti_,\r\n_Fanti_. The _seppiriba_ plant, said to have been eaten by the Fanti, is\r\nstill called _fan_ when cooked.\r\n\r\n  TRIBES OF TSHI     TRIBES OF EWE      TRIBES OF YORUBA\r\n  AND GA SPEECH         SPEECH               SPEECH\r\n\r\n   _Gold Coast_    _Slave Coast West_   _Slave Coast East_\r\n                                        _and Niger Delta_\r\n\r\n    Ashanti             Dahomi             Yoruba[161]\r\n    Safwhi              Eweawo             Ibadan\r\n    Denkera             Agotine            Ketu\r\n    Bekwai              Anfueh             Egba\r\n    Nkoranza            Krepe              Jebu\r\n    Adansi              Avenor             Remo\r\n    Assin               Awuna              Ode\r\n    Wassaw              Agbosomi           Ilorin\r\n    Ahanta              Aflao              Ijesa\r\n    Fanti               Ataklu             Ondo\r\n    Agona               Krikor             Mahin\r\n    Akwapim             Geng               Benin (Bini)\r\n    Akim                Attakpami          Kakanda\r\n    Akwamu              Aja                Wari\r\n    Kwao                Ewemi              Ibo[161]\r\n    Ga                  Appa               Efik[161]\r\n\r\nOther traditions refer to a time when all were of one speech, and lived\r\nin a far country beyond Salagha, open, flat, with little bush, and\r\nplenty of cattle and sheep, a tolerably accurate description of the\r\ninland Sudanese plateaux. But then came a red people, said to be the\r\nFulahs, Muhammadans, who oppressed the blacks and drove them to take\r\nrefuge in the forests. Here they thrived and multiplied, and after many\r\nvicissitudes they came down, down, until at last they reached the coast,\r\nwith the waves rolling in, the white foam hissing and frothing on the\r\nbeach, and thought it was all boiling water until some one touched it\r\nand found it was not hot, and so to this day they call the sea _Eh-huru\r\nden o nni shew_, \"Boiling water not hot,\" but far inland the sea is\r\nstill \"Boiling water[162].\"\r\n\r\nTo A. B. Ellis we are indebted especially for the true explanation of\r\nthe much used and abused term _fetish_, as applied to the native\r\nbeliefs. It was of course already known to be not an African but a\r\nPortuguese word[163], meaning a charm, amulet, or even witchcraft. But\r\nEllis shows how it came to be wrongly applied to all forms of animal and\r\nnature worship, and how the confusion was increased by De Brosses'\r\ntheory of a primordial fetishism, and by his statement that it was\r\nimpossible to conceive a lower form of religion than fetishism, which\r\nmight therefore be assumed to be the beginning of all religion[164].\r\n\r\nOn the contrary it represents rather an advanced stage, as Ellis\r\ndiscovered after four or five years of careful observation on the spot.\r\nA fetish, he tells us, is something tangible and inanimate, which is\r\nbelieved to possess power in itself, and is worshipped for itself alone.\r\nNor can such an object be picked up anywhere at random, as is commonly\r\nasserted, and he adds that the belief \"is arrived at only after\r\nconsiderable progress has been made in religious ideas, when the older\r\nform of religion becomes secondary and owes its existence to the\r\nconfusion of the tangible with the intangible, of the material with the\r\nimmaterial; to the belief in the indwelling god being gradually lost\r\nsight of until the power originally believed to belong to the god, is\r\nfinally attributed to the tangible and inanimate object itself.\"\r\n\r\nBut now comes a statement that may seem paradoxical to most students of\r\nthe evolution of religious ideas. We are assured that fetishism thus\r\nunderstood is not specially or at all characteristic of the religion of\r\nthe Gold Coast natives, who are in fact \"remarkably free from it\" and\r\nbelieve in invisible intangible deities. Some of them may dwell in a\r\ntangible inanimate object, popularly called a \"fetish\"; but the idea of\r\nthe indwelling god is never lost sight of, nor is the object ever\r\nworshipped for its own sake. True fetishism, the worship of such\r\nmaterial objects and images, prevails, on the contrary, far more\r\n\"amongst the Negroes of the West Indies, who have been christianised for\r\nmore than half-a-century, than amongst those of West Africa. Hence the\r\nbelief in Obeah, still prevalent in the West Indies, which formerly was\r\na belief in indwelling spirits which inhabited certain objects, has now\r\nbecome a worship paid to tangible and inanimate objects, which of\r\nthemselves are believed to possess the power to injure. In Europe itself\r\nwe find evidence amongst the Roman Catholic populations of the South,\r\nthat fetishism is a corruption of a former _culte_, rather than a\r\nprimordial faith. The lower classes there have confused the intangible\r\nwith the tangible, and believe that the images of the saints can both\r\nsee, hear and feel. Thus we find the Italian peasants and fishermen beat\r\nand ill-treat their images when their requests have not been complied\r\nwith.... These appear to be instances of true fetishism[165].\"\r\n\r\nAnother phase of religious belief in Upper Guinea is ancestry worship,\r\nwhich has here been developed to a degree unknown elsewhere. As the\r\ndeparted have to be maintained in the same social position beyond the\r\ngrave that they enjoyed in this world, they must be supplied with\r\nslaves, wives, and attendants, each according to his rank. Hence the\r\ninstitution of the so-called \"customs,\" or anniversary feasts of the\r\ndead, accompanied by the sacrifice of human victims, regulated at first\r\nby the status and afterwards by the whim and caprice of chiefs and\r\nkings. In the capitals of the more powerful states, Ashanti, Dahomey,\r\nBenin, the scenes witnessed at these sanguinary rites rivalled in horror\r\nthose held in honour of the Aztec gods. Details may here be dispensed\r\nwith on a repulsive subject, ample accounts of which are accessible from\r\nmany sources to the general reader. In any case these atrocities teach\r\nno lesson, except that most religions have waded through blood to better\r\nthings, unless arrested in mid-stream by the intervention of higher\r\npowers, as happily in Upper Guinea, where the human shambles of Kumassi,\r\nAbomeh, Benin and most other places have now been swept away.\r\n\r\nOn the capture of Benin by the English in 1897 a rare and unexpected\r\nprize fell into the hands of ethnologists. Here was found a large\r\nassortment of carved ivories, woodwork, and especially a series of about\r\n300 bronze and brass plates or panels with figures of natives and\r\nEuropeans, armed and in armour, in full relief, all cast by the _cire\r\nperdue_ process[166], some barbaric, others, and especially a head in\r\nthe round of a young negress, showing high artistic skill. Many of these\r\nremarkable objects are in the British Museum, where they have been\r\nstudied by C. H. Read and O. M. Dalton[167], who are evidently right in\r\nassigning the better class to the sixteenth century, and to the aid, if\r\nnot the hand, of some Portuguese artificers in the service of the King\r\nof Benin. They add that \"casting of an inferior kind continues down to\r\nthe present time,\" and it may here be mentioned that armour has long\r\nbeen and is still worn by the cavalry, and even their horses, in the\r\nMuhammadan states of Central Sudan. \"The chiefs (_Kashellawa_) who serve\r\nas officers under the Sultan [of Bornu] and act as his bodyguard wear\r\njackets of chain armour and cuirasses of coats of mail[168].\" It is\r\nclear that metal casting in a large way has long been practised by the\r\nsemi-civilised peoples of Sudan.\r\n\r\nWithin the great bend of the Niger the veil, first slightly raised by\r\nBarth in the middle of the nineteenth century, has now been drawn aside\r\nby L. G. Binger, F. D. Lugard and later explorers. Here the _Mossi_,\r\n_Borgu_ and others have hitherto more or less successfully resisted the\r\nMoslem advance, and are consequently for the most part little removed\r\nfrom the savage state. Even the \"Faithful\" wear the cloak of Islam\r\nsomewhat loosely, and the level of their culture may be judged from the\r\ncase of the Imam of Diulasu, who pestered Binger for nostrums and charms\r\nagainst ailments, war, and misfortunes. What he wanted chiefly to know\r\nwas the names of Abraham's two wives. \"Tell me these,\" he would say,\r\n\"and my fortune is made, for I dreamt it the other night; you must tell\r\nme; I really must have those names or I'm lost[169].\"\r\n\r\nIn some districts the ethnical confusion is considerable, and when\r\nBinger arrived at the Court of the Mossi King, Baikary, he was addressed\r\nsuccessively in Mossi, Hausa, Songhai, and Fulah, until at last it was\r\ndiscovered that Mandingan was the only native language he understood.\r\nWaghadugu, capital of the chief Mossi state, comprises several distinct\r\nquarters occupied respectively by Mandingans, Marengas (Songhai),\r\nZang-wer'os (Hausas), Chilmigos (Fulahs), Mussulman and heathen Mossis,\r\nthe whole population scarcely exceeding 5000. However, perfect harmony\r\nprevails, the Mossi themselves being extremely tolerant despite the long\r\nreligious wars they have had to wage against the fanatical Fulahs and\r\nother Muhammadan aggressors[170].\r\n\r\nReligious indifference is indeed a marked characteristic of this people,\r\nand the case is mentioned of a nominal Mussulman prince who could even\r\nread and write, and say his prayers, but whose two sons \"knew nothing at\r\nall,\" or, as we should say, were \"Agnostics.\" One of them, however, it\r\nis fair to add, is claimed by both sides, the Moslems asserting that he\r\nsays his prayers in secret, the heathens that he drinks _dolo_\r\n(palm-wine), which of course no true believer is supposed ever to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL SUDANESE.\r\n\r\nIn Central Sudan, that is, the region stretching from the Niger to\r\nWadai, a tolerably clean sweep has been made of the aborigines, except\r\nalong the southern fringe and in parts of the Chad basin. For many\r\ncenturies Islam has here been firmly established, and in Negroland Islam\r\nis synonymous with a greater or less degree of miscegenation. The native\r\ntribes who resisted the fiery Arab or Tuareg or Tibu proselytisers were\r\nfor the most part either extirpated, or else driven to the southern\r\nuplands about the Congo-Chad water-parting. All who accepted the Koran\r\nbecame merged with the conquerors in a common negroid population, which\r\nsupplied the new material for the development of large social\r\ncommunities and powerful political states.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the old tribal organisations were in great\r\nmeasure dissolved, and throughout its historic period of about a\r\nmillennium Central Sudan is found mainly occupied by peoples gathered\r\ntogether in a small number of political systems, each with its own\r\nlanguage and special institutions, but all alike accepting Islam as the\r\nState religion. Such are or were the Songhai empire, the Hausa States,\r\nand the kingdoms of Bornu with Kanem and Baghirmi, and these jointly\r\ncover the whole of Central Sudan as above defined.\r\n\r\n_Songhais_[171]. How completely the tribe[172] has merged in the\r\npeople[172] may be inferred from the mere statement that, although no\r\nlonger an independent nation[172], the negroid Songhais form a single\r\nethnical group of about two million souls, all of one speech and one\r\nreligion, and all distinguished by somewhat uniform physical and mental\r\ncharacters. This territory lies mainly about the borderlands between\r\nSudan and the Sahara, stretching from Timbuktu east to the Asben oasis\r\nand along both banks of the Niger from Lake Debo round to the Sokoto\r\nconfluence, and also at some points reaching as far as the Hombori hills\r\nwithin the great bend of the Niger.\r\n\r\nHere they are found in the closest connection with the Ireghenaten\r\n(\"mixed\") Tuaregs, and elsewhere with other Tuaregs, and with Arabs,\r\nFulahs or Hausas[173], so that exclusively Songhai communities are now\r\nsomewhat rare. But the bulk of the race is still concentrated in Gurma\r\nand in the district between Gobo and Timbuktu, the two chief cities of\r\nthe old Songhai empire.\r\n\r\nThey are a distinctly negroid people, presenting various shades of\r\nintermixture with the surrounding Hamites and Semites, but generally of\r\na very deep brown or blackish colour, with somewhat regular features and\r\nthat peculiar long, black, and ringletty hair, which is so\r\ncharacteristic of Negro and Caucasic blends, as seen amongst the Trarsas\r\nand Braknas of the Senegal, the Bejas, Danakils, and many Abyssinians of\r\nthe region between the Nile and the Red Sea. Barth, to whom we still owe\r\nthe best account of this historical people, describes them as of a dull,\r\nmorose temperament, the most unfriendly and churlish of all the peoples\r\nvisited by him in Negroland.\r\n\r\nThis writer's suggestion that they may have formerly had relations with\r\nthe Egyptians[174] has been revived in an exaggerated form by M. Felix\r\nDubois, whose views have received currency in England through uncritical\r\nnotices of his _Timbouctou la Mysterieuse_ (Paris, 1897). But there is\r\nno \"mystery\" in the matter. The Songhai are a Sudanese people, whose\r\nexodus from Egypt is a myth, and whose Kissur language, as it is called,\r\nhas not the remotest connection with any form of speech known to have\r\nbeen at any time current in the Nile Valley[175]. Nor has it any evident\r\naffinities with any group of African tongues. H. H. Johnston regards the\r\nSonghai as the result of the mixing of \"the Libyan section of the\r\nHamitic peoples, reinforced by Berbers (Iberians) from Spain,\" with the\r\npre-existing Fulah type and the Negroids; as also from the far earlier\r\nintercourse between the Fulah and the Negro[176].\r\n\r\nThe Songhai empire, like that of the rival Mandingans, claims a\r\nrespectable antiquity, its reputed founder Za-el-Yemeni having\r\nflourished about 680 A.D. Za Kasi, fifteenth in succession from the\r\nfounder, was the first Muhammadan ruler (1009); but about 1326 the\r\ncountry was reduced by the Mandingans, and remained throughout the\r\nfourteenth and a great part of the fifteenth century virtually subject\r\nto the Mali empire, although Ali Killun, founder of the new Sonni\r\ndynasty, had acquired a measure of independence about 1335-6. But the\r\npolitical supremacy of the Songhai people dates only from about 1464,\r\nwhen Sonni Ali, sixteenth of the Sonni dynasty, known in history as \"the\r\ngreat tyrant and famous miscreant,\" threw off the Mandingan yoke, \"and\r\nchanged the whole face of this part of Africa by prostrating the kingdom\r\nof Melle[177].\" Under his successor, Muhammad Askia[178], \"perhaps the\r\ngreatest sovereign that ever ruled over Negroland[179],\" the Songhai\r\nEmpire acquired its greatest expansion, extending from the heart of\r\nHausaland to the Atlantic seaboard, and from the Mossi country to the\r\nTuat oasis, south of Morocco. Although unfavourably spoken of by Leo\r\nAfricanus, Askia is described by Ahmed Baba as governing the subject\r\npeoples \"with justice and equity, causing well-being and comfort to\r\nspring up everywhere within the borders of his extensive dominions, and\r\nintroducing such of the institutions of Muhammadan civilisation as he\r\nconsidered might be useful to his subjects[180].\"\r\n\r\nAskia also made the Mecca pilgrimage with a great show of splendour. But\r\nafter his reign (1492-1529) the Songhai power gradually declined, and\r\nwas at last overthrown by Mulay Hamed, Emperor of Morocco, in 1591-2.\r\nAhmed Baba, the native chronicler, was involved in the ruin of his\r\npeople[181], and since then the Songhai nation has been broken into\r\nfragments, subject here to Hausas, there to Fulahs, elsewhere to\r\nTuaregs, and, since the French occupation of Timbuktu (1894), to the\r\nhated Giaur.\r\n\r\n_Hausas._ In everything that constitutes the real greatness of a\r\nnation, the Hausas may rightly claim preeminence amongst all the peoples\r\nof Negroland. No doubt early in the nineteenth century the historical\r\nHausa States, occupying the whole region between the Niger and Bornu,\r\nwere overrun and reduced by the fanatical Fulah bands under Othman Dan\r\nFodye. But the Hausas, in a truer sense than the Greeks, \"have captured\r\ntheir rude conquerors[182],\" for they have even largely assimilated them\r\nphysically to their own type, and the Hausa nationality is under British\r\nauspices asserting its natural social, industrial and commercial\r\npredominance throughout Central and even parts of Western Sudan.\r\n\r\nIt could not well be otherwise, seeing that the Hausas form a compact\r\nbody of some five million peaceful and industrious Sudanese, living\r\npartly in numerous farmsteads amid their well-tilled cotton, indigo,\r\npulse, and corn fields, partly in large walled cities and great trading\r\ncentres such as Kano[183], Katsena, Yacoba, whose intelligent and\r\nlaw-abiding inhabitants are reckoned by many tens of thousands. Their\r\nmelodious tongue, with a vocabulary containing perhaps 10,000\r\nwords[184], has long been the great medium of intercourse throughout\r\nSudan from Lake Chad to and beyond the Niger, and is daily acquiring\r\neven greater preponderance amongst all the settled and trading\r\npopulations of these regions.\r\n\r\nBut though showing a marked preference for peaceful pursuits, the Hausas\r\nare by no means an effeminate people. Largely enlisted in the British\r\nservice, they have at all times shown fighting qualities of a high order\r\nunder their English officers, and a well-earned tribute has been paid to\r\ntheir military prowess amongst others by Sir George Goldie and Lieut.\r\nVandeleur[185]. With the Hausas on her side England need assuredly fear\r\nno rivals to her beneficent sway over the teeming populations of the\r\nfertile plains and plateaux of Central Sudan, which is on the whole\r\nperhaps the most favoured land in Africa north of the equator.\r\n\r\nAccording to the national traditions, which go back to no very remote\r\nperiod[186], the seven historical Hausa States known as the \"Hausa\r\nbokoy\" (\"the seven Hausas\") take their name from the eponymous heroes\r\n_Biram_, _Daura_, _Gober_, _Kano_, _Rano_, _Katsena_ and _Zegzeg_, all\r\nsaid to be sprung from the Deggaras, a Berber tribe settled to the north\r\nof Munyo. From Biram, the original seat, the race and its language\r\nspread to seven other provinces--_Zanfara_, _Kebbi_, _Nupe_ (_Nyffi_),\r\n_Gwari_, _Yauri_, _Yariba_ and _Kororofa_, which in contempt are called\r\nthe \"Banza bokoy\" (\"the seven Upstarts\"). All form collectively the\r\nHausa domain in the widest sense.\r\n\r\nAuthentic history is quite recent, and even Komayo, reputed founder of\r\nKatsena, dates only from about the fourteenth century. Ibrahim Maji, who\r\nwas the first Moslem ruler, is assigned to the latter part of the\r\nfifteenth century, and since then the chief events have been associated\r\nwith the Fulah wars, ending in the absorption of all the Hausa States in\r\nthe unstable Fulah empire of Sokoto at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. With the fall of Kano and Sokoto in 1903 British supremacy was\r\nfinally established throughout the Hausa States, now termed Northern\r\nNigeria[187].\r\n\r\n_Kanembu_; _Kanuri_[188]; _Baghirmi_, _Mosgu_. Round about the shores of\r\nLake Chad are grouped three other historical Muhammadan nations, the\r\nKanembu (\"People of Kanem\") on the north, the Kanuri of Bornu on the\r\nwest, and the Baghirmi on the south side. The last named was conquered\r\nby the Sultan of Wadai in 1871, and overrun by Rabah Zobeir, half Arab,\r\nhalf Negro adventurer, in 1890. But in 1897 Emile Gentil[189], French\r\ncommissioner for the district, placed the country under French\r\nprotection, although French authority was not firmly established until\r\nthe death of Rabah and the rout of his sons in 1901. At the same time\r\nKanem was brought under French control, and shortly afterwards Bornu was\r\ndivided between Great Britain, France and Germany.\r\n\r\nIn this region the ethnical relations are considerably more complex than\r\nin the Hausa States. Here Islam has had greater obstacles to contend\r\nwith than on the more open western plateaux, and many of the pagan\r\naborigines have been able to hold their ground either in the\r\narchipelagos of Lake Chad (_Yedinas, Kuri, Buduma_[190]), or in the\r\nswampy tracts and uplands of the Logon-Shari basin (_Mosgu_, _Mandara_,\r\n_Makari_, etc.).\r\n\r\nIt was also the policy of the Muhammadans, whose system is based on\r\nslavery, not to push their religious zeal too far, for, if all the\r\nnatives were converted, where could they procure a constant supply of\r\nslaves, those who accept the teachings of the Prophet being _ipso facto_\r\nentitled to their freedom? Hence the pagan districts were, and still\r\nare, regarded as convenient preserves, happy hunting-grounds to be\r\nraided from time to time, but not utterly wasted; to be visited by\r\norganised razzias just often enough to keep up the supply in the home\r\nand foreign markets. This system, controlled by the local governments\r\nthemselves, has long prevailed about the borderlands between Islam and\r\nheathendom, as we know from Barth, Nachtigal, and one or two other\r\ntravellers, who have had reluctantly to accompany the periodical\r\nslave-hunting expeditions from Bornu and Baghirmi to the territories of\r\nthe pagan Mosgu people with their numerous branches (_Margi, Mandara,\r\nMakari, Logon, Gamergu, Keribina_) and the other aborigines (_Bede,\r\nNgisem, So, Kerrikerri, Babir_) on the northern slopes of the Congo-Chad\r\nwater-parting. As usual on such occasions, there is a great waste of\r\nlife, many perishing in defence of their homes or even through sheer\r\nwantonness, besides those carried away captives. \"A large number of\r\nslaves had been caught this day,\" writes Barth, \"and in the evening a\r\ngreat many more were brought in; altogether they were said to have taken\r\none thousand, and there were certainly not less than five hundred. To\r\nour utmost horror, not less than 170 full-grown men were mercilessly\r\nslaughtered in cold blood, the greater part of them being allowed to\r\nbleed to death, a leg having been severed from the body[191].\" There was\r\nprobably just then a glut in the market.\r\n\r\nA curious result of these relations is that in the wooded districts some\r\nof the natives have reverted to arboreal habits, taking refuge during\r\nthe raids in the branches of huge bombax-trees converted into temporary\r\nstrongholds. Round the vertical stem of these forest giants is erected a\r\nbreast-high look-out, while the higher horizontal branches, less exposed\r\nto the fire of the enemy, support strongly-built huts and store-houses,\r\nwhere the families of the fugitives take refuge with their effects,\r\nincluding, as Nachtigal assures us[192], their domestic animals, such as\r\ngoats, dogs, and poultry. During the siege of the aerial fortress, which\r\nis often successfully defended, long light ladders of withies are let\r\ndown at night, when no attack need be feared, and the supply of water\r\nand provisions is thus renewed from _caches_ or hiding-places round\r\nabout. In 1872 Nachtigal accompanied a predatory excursion to the pagan\r\ndistricts south of Baghirmi, when an attack was made on one of these\r\ntree-fortresses. Such citadels can be stormed only at a heavy loss, and\r\nas the Gaberi (Baghirmi) warriors had no tools capable of felling the\r\ngreat bombax-tree, they were fain to rest satisfied with picking off a\r\npoor wretch now and then, and barbarously mutilating the bodies as they\r\nfell from the overhanging branches.\r\n\r\nSome of these aborigines disfigure their faces by the disk-like\r\nlip-ornament, which is also fashionable in Nyassaland, and even amongst\r\nthe South American Botocudos. The type often differs greatly, and while\r\nsome of the widespread Mosgu tribes are of a dirty black hue, with\r\ndisagreeable expression, wide open nostrils, thick lips, high\r\ncheek-bones, coarse bushy hair, and disproportionate knock-kneed legs,\r\nother members of the same family astonished Barth \"by the beauty and\r\nsymmetry of their forms, and by the regularity of their features, which\r\nin some had nothing of what is called the Negro type. But I was still\r\nmore astonished at their complexion, which was very different in\r\ndifferent individuals, being in some of a glossy black, and in others of\r\na light copper, or rather rhubarb colour, the intermediate shades being\r\nalmost entirely wanting. I observed in one house a really beautiful\r\nfemale who, with her son, about eight or nine years of age, formed a\r\nmost charming group, well worthy of the hand of an accomplished artist.\r\nThe boy's form did not yield in any respect to the beautiful symmetry of\r\nthe most celebrated Grecian statues. His hair, indeed, was very short\r\nand curled, but not woolly. He, as well as his mother and the whole\r\nfamily, were of a pale or yellowish-red complexion, like rhubarb[193].\"\r\n\r\nThere is no suggestion of albinism, and the explanation of such strange\r\ncontrasts must await further exploration in the whole of this borderland\r\nof Negroes and Bantus about the divide between the Chad and the Congo\r\nbasins. The country has until lately been traversed only at rare\r\nintervals by pioneers, interested more in political than in\r\nanthropological matters.\r\n\r\nOf the settled and more or less cultured peoples in the Chad basin, the\r\nmost important are the _Kanembu_[194], who introduce a fresh element of\r\nconfusion in this region, being more allied in type and speech to the\r\nHamitic Tibus than to the Negro stock, or at least taking a transitional\r\nposition between the two; the _Kanuri_, the ruling people in Bornu, of\r\nsomewhat coarse Negroid appearance[195]; and the southern _Baghirmi_,\r\nalso decidedly Negroid, originally supposed to have come from the Upper\r\nShari and White Nile districts[196]. Their civilisation, such as it is,\r\nhas been developed exclusively under Moslem influences, but it has never\r\npenetrated much below the surface. The people are everywhere extremely\r\nrude, and for the most part unlettered, although the meagre and not\r\naltogether trustworthy Kanem-Bornu records date from the time of Sef,\r\nreputed founder of the monarchy about 800 A.D. Duku, second in descent\r\nfrom Sef, is doubtfully referred to about 850 A.D. Hame, founder of a\r\nnew dynasty, flourished towards the end of the eleventh century\r\n(1086-97), and Dunama, one of his successors, is said to have extended\r\nhis sway over a great part of the Sahara, including the whole of Fezzan\r\n(1221-59). Under Omar (1394-98) a divorce took place between Kanem and\r\nBornu, and henceforth the latter country has remained the chief centre\r\nof political power in the Chad basin.\r\n\r\nA long series of civil wars was closed by Ali (1472-1504), who founded\r\nthe present capital, Birni, and whose grandson, Muhammad, brought the\r\nempire of Bornu to the highest pitch of its greatness (1526-45). Under\r\nAhmed (1793-1810) began the wars with the Fulahs, who, after bringing\r\nthe empire to the verge of ruin, were at last overthrown by the aid of\r\nthe Kanem people, and since 1819 Bornu has been ruled by the present\r\nKanemiyin dynasty, which though temporarily conquered by Rabah in 1893,\r\nwas restored under British administration in 1902[197].\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTERN SUDANESE.\r\n\r\nAs some confusion prevails regarding the expression \"Eastern Sudan,\" I\r\nmay here explain that it bears a very different meaning, according as it\r\nis used in a political or an ethnical sense. Politically it is\r\npractically synonymous with Egyptian Sudan, that is the whole region\r\nfrom Darfur to the Red Sea which was ruled or misruled by the Khedivial\r\nGovernment before the revolt of the Mahdi (1883-4), and was restored to\r\nEgypt by the British occupation of Khartum in 1898. Ethnically Eastern\r\nSudan comprises all the lands east of the Chad basin, where the Negro or\r\nNegroid populations are predominant, that is to say, Wadai, Darfur, and\r\nKordofan in the West, the Nile Valley from the frontier of Egypt proper\r\nsouth to Albert Nyanza, both slopes of the Nile-Congo divide (the\r\nwestern tributaries of the White Nile and the Welle-Makua affluent of\r\nthe Congo), lastly the Sobat Valley with some Negro enclaves east of the\r\nWhite Nile, and even south of the equator (Kavirondo, Semliki Valley).\r\n\r\nThroughout this region the fusion of the aborigines with Hamites and\r\nArabs, Tuareg, or Tibu Moslem intruders, wherever they have penetrated,\r\nhas been far less complete than in Central and Western Sudan. Thus in\r\nWadai the dominant Maba people, whence the country is often called\r\nDar-Maba (\"Mabaland\"), are rather Negro than Negroid, with but a slight\r\nstrain of foreign blood. In the northern districts the _Zoghawa_,\r\n_Gura'an_, _Baele_ and _Bulala_ Tibus keep quite aloof from the blacks,\r\nas do elsewhere; the _Aramkas_, as the Arabs are collectively called in\r\nWadai. Yet the _Mahamid_ and some other Bedouin tribes have here been\r\nsettled for over 500 years, and it was through their assistance that the\r\nMabas acquired the political supremacy they have enjoyed since the\r\nseventeenth century, when they reduced or expelled the _Tynjurs_[198],\r\nthe former ruling race, said to be Nubians originally from Dongola. It\r\nwas Abd-el-Kerim, founder of the new Moslem Maba state, who gave the\r\ncountry its present name in honour of his grandfather, _Wadai_. His\r\nsuccessor Kharub I removed the seat of government to Wara, where Vogel\r\nwas murdered in 1856. Abeshr, the present capital, dates only from the\r\nyear 1850. Except for Nachtigal, who crossed the frontier in 1873,\r\nnothing was known of the land or its people until the French occupation\r\nat the end of the last century (1899). Since that date it has been\r\nprominent as the scene of the attack on a French column and the death of\r\nits leader, Colonel Moll, in 1910, and the tragic murder of Lieutenant\r\nBoyd Alexander earlier in the same year[199].\r\n\r\n_Nubas._ As in Wadai, the intruding and native populations have been\r\neither imperfectly or not at all assimilated in Darfur and Kordofan,\r\nwhere the Muhammadan Semites still boast of their pure Arab\r\ndescent[200], and form powerful confederacies. Chief among these are the\r\n_Baggara_ (Baqqara, \"cow-herds\"), cattle-keepers and agriculturalists,\r\nof whom some are as dark as the blackest negroes, though many are\r\nfine-looking, with regular, well-shaped features. Their form of Arabic\r\nis notoriously corrupt. Their rivals, the _Jaalan_ (Jalin, Jahalin), are\r\nmostly riverain \"Arabs,\" a learned tribe, containing many scribes, and\r\ntheir language is said to be closer to classical Arabic than the form\r\ncurrent in Egypt. These are the principal slave-hunters of the Sudan,\r\nand the famous Zobeir belonged to their tribe. The _Yemanieh_ are\r\nlargely traders, and trace their origin from South Arabia. The\r\n_Kababish_ are the wealthiest camel-owning tribe, perhaps less\r\ncontaminated by negro blood than any other Arab tribe in the Sudan[201].\r\nThe _Nuba_ and the _Nubians_ have been a source of much confusion, but\r\nrecent investigations in the field such as those of C. G. Seligman[202]\r\nand H. A. MacMichael[203], and the publications of the Archaeological\r\nSurvey of Nubia conducted by G. A. Reisner, help to elucidate the\r\nproblem. We have first of all to get rid of the \"Nuba-Fulah\" family,\r\nwhich was introduced by Fr. Mueller and accepted by some English writers,\r\nbut has absolutely no existence. The two languages, although both of the\r\nagglutinative Sudanese type, are radically distinct in all their\r\nstructural, lexical, and phonetic elements, and the two peoples are\r\nequally distinct. The Fulahs are of North African origin, although many\r\nhave in recent times been largely assimilated to their black Sudanese\r\nsubjects. The Nuba on the contrary belong originally to the Negro stock,\r\nwith hair of the common negro type, and are among the darkest skinned\r\ntribes in the Sudan, their colour varying from a dark chocolate brown to\r\nthe darkest shade of brown black.\r\n\r\nBut rightly to understand the question we have carefully to avoid\r\nconfusion between the Nubians of the Nile Valley and the Negro _Nubas_,\r\nwho gave their name to the Nuba Mountains, Kordofan, where most of the\r\naborigines (_Kargo, Kulfan, Kolaji, Tumali, Lafofa, Eliri, Talodi_)\r\nstill belong to this connection[203]. Kordofan is probably itself a Nuba\r\nword meaning \"Land of the Kordo\" (_fan_ = Arab, _dar_, land, country).\r\nThere is a certain amount of anthropological evidence to connect the\r\nNuba with the _Fur_ and the _Kara_ of Darfur to the west[204]. But it is\r\na different anthropological type that is represented in the three groups\r\nof _Matokki_ (_Kenus_) between the First Cataract and Wadi-el-Arab, the\r\n_Mahai_ (_Marisi_) between Korosko and Wadi-Halfa, at the Second\r\nCataract, and the _Dongolawi_, of the province of Dongola between\r\nWadi-Halfa and Jebel Deja near Meroe.\r\n\r\nThese three groups, all now Muhammadans, but formerly Christians,\r\nconstitute collectively the so-called \"Nubians\" of European writers, but\r\ncall themselves _Barabra_, Plural of _Berberi_, _i.e._ people of Berber,\r\nalthough they do not at present extend so far up the Nile as that\r\ntown[205]. Possibly these are Strabo's \"Noubai, who dwell on the left\r\nbank of the Nile in Libya [Africa], a great nation etc.[206]\"; and are\r\nalso to be identified with the _Nobatae_, who in Diocletian's time were\r\nsettled, some in the Kharga oasis, others in the Nile Valley about\r\nMeroe, to guard the frontiers of the empire against the incursions of\r\nthe restless Blemmues. But after some time they appear to have entered\r\ninto peaceful relations with these Hamites, the present Bejas, even\r\nmaking common cause with them against the Romans; but the confederacy\r\nwas crushed by Maximinus in 451, though perhaps not before crossings had\r\ntaken place between the Nobatae and the Caucasic Bejas. Then these Bejas\r\nwithdrew to their old homes, which they still occupy, between the Nile\r\nand the Red Sea above Egypt, while the Nobatae, embracing Christianity,\r\nas is said, in 545, established the powerful kingdom of Dongola which\r\nlasted over 800 years, and was finally overthrown by the Arabs in the\r\nfourteenth century, since which time the Nile Nubians have been\r\nMuhammadans.\r\n\r\nThere still remains the problem of language which, as shown by\r\nLepsius[207], differs but slightly from that now current amongst the\r\nKordofan Nubas. But this similarity only holds in the north, and is now\r\nshown to be due to Berberine immigration into Kordofan[208]. Recent\r\ninvestigations show that the Nuba and the Barabra, in spite of this\r\nlinguistic similarity which has misled certain authors[209], are not to\r\nbe regarded as belonging to the same race[210]. \"The Nuba are a tall,\r\nstoutly built muscular people, with a dark, almost black skin. They are\r\npredominantly mesaticephalic, for although cephalic indices under 70 and\r\nover 80 both occur, nearly 60 per cent. of the individuals measured are\r\nmesaticephals, the remaining being dolichocephalic and brachycephalic in\r\nabout equal proportions.\" The hair is invariably woolly. The Barabra, on\r\nthe contrary, is of slight, or more commonly medium build, not\r\nparticularly muscular and in skin colour varies from a yellowish to a\r\nchocolate brown. The hair is commonly curly or wavy and may be almost\r\nstraight, while the features are not uncommonly absolutely non-Negroid.\r\n\"Thus there can be no doubt that the two peoples are essentially\r\ndifferent in physical characters and the same holds good on the cultural\r\nside\" (p. 611). Barabra were identified by Lepsius with the Wawat, a\r\npeople frequently mentioned in Egyptian records, and recent excavations\r\nby the members of the Archaeological Survey of Nubia show a close\r\nconnection with the predynastic Egyptians, a connection supported also\r\non physical grounds. It seems strange, therefore, to meet with repeated\r\nreference on Egyptian monuments to Negroes in Nubia when, as proved by\r\nexcavations, the inhabitants were by no means Negroes or even frankly\r\nNegroid. Seligman's solution of the difficulty is as follows (p. 619).\r\nIt seems that only one explanation is tenable, namely that for a period\r\nsubsequent to the Middle Kingdom the country in the neighbourhood of the\r\nSecond Cataract became essentially a Negro country and may have remained\r\nin this condition for some little time. Then a movement in the opposite\r\ndirection set in; the Negroes, diminished by war, were in part driven\r\nback by the great conquerors of the New Empire; those that were left\r\nmixed with the Egyptian garrisons and traders and once more a hybrid\r\nrace arose which, however, preserved the language of its Negro\r\nancestors. Although Seligman regards the conclusion that this race gave\r\nrise directly to the present-day inhabitants of Nubia as \"premature,\"\r\nand suggests further mixture with the Beja of the eastern deserts,\r\nElliot Smith recognises the essential similarity between the homogeneous\r\nblend of Egyptian and Negro traits which characterise the Middle Nubian\r\npeople (contemporary with the Middle Empire, XII-XVII dynasties), a type\r\nwhich \"seems to have remained dominant in Nubia ever since then, for the\r\nspan of almost 4000 years[211].\"\r\n\r\nBefore the incursions of the Nubian-Arab traders and raiders, who began\r\nto form settlements (_zeribas_, fenced stations) in the Upper Nile\r\nregions above Khartum about the middle of the nineteenth century, most\r\nof the Nile-Congo divide (White Nile tributaries and Welle-Makua basin)\r\nbelonged in the strictest sense to the Negro domain. Sudanese tribes,\r\nand even great nations reckoned by millions, had been for ages in almost\r\nundisturbed possession, not only of the main stream from the equatorial\r\nlakes to and beyond the Sobat junction, but also of the Sobat Valley\r\nitself, and of the numerous south-western head-waters of the White Nile\r\nconverging about Lake No above the Sobat junction. Nearly all the Nile\r\npeoples--the _Shilluks_ and _Dinkas_ about the Sobat confluence, the\r\n_Bari_ and _Nuers_ of the Bahr-el-Jebel, the _Bongos_ (_Dors_), _Rols_,\r\n_Golos_, _Mittus_, _Madis_, _Makarakas_, _Abakas_, _Mundus_, and many\r\nothers about the western affluents, as well as the _Funj_ of Senaar--had\r\nbeen brought under the Khedivial rule before the revolt of the Mahdi.\r\n\r\nThe same fate had already overtaken or was threatening the formerly\r\npowerful _Mombuttu_ (_Mangbattu_) and _Zandeh_[212] nations of the Welle\r\nlands, as well as the _Krej_ and others about the low watersheds of the\r\nNile-Congo and Chad basins. Since then the Welle groups have been\r\nsubjected to the jurisdiction of the Congo Free State, while the\r\npolitical destinies of the Nilotic tribes must henceforth be controlled\r\nby the British masters of the Nile lands from the Great Lakes to the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nAlthough grouped as Negroes proper, very few of the Nilotic peoples\r\npresent the almost ideal type of the blacks, such as those of Upper\r\nGuinea and the Atlantic coast of West Sudan. The complexion is in\r\ngeneral less black, the nose less broad at the base, the lips less\r\neverted (Shilluks and one or two others excepted), the hair rather less\r\nfrizzly, the dolichocephaly and prognathism less marked.\r\n\r\nApart from the more delicate shades of transition, due to diverse\r\ninterminglings with Hamites and Semites, two distinct types may be\r\nplainly distinguished--one black, often very tall, with long thin legs,\r\nand long-headed (_Shilluks, Dinkas, Bari, Nuers, Alur_), the other\r\nreddish or ruddy brown, more thick-set, and short-headed (_Bongos_,\r\n_Golos_, _Makarakas_, with the kindred _Zandehs_ of the Welle region).\r\nNo explanation has been offered of their brachycephaly, which is all the\r\nmore difficult to account for, inasmuch as it is characteristic neither\r\nof the aboriginal Negro nor of the intruding Hamitic and Semitic\r\nelements. Have we here an indication of the transition suspected by many\r\nbetween the true long-headed Negro and the round-headed Negrillo, who is\r\nalso brownish, and formerly ranged as far north as the Nile\r\nhead-streams, as would appear from the early Egyptian records (Chap.\r\nIV.)? Schweinfurth found that the Bongos were \"hardly removed from the\r\nlowest grade of brachycephaly[213],\" and the same is largely true of the\r\nZandehs and their Makaraka cousins, as noticed by Junker: \"The skull\r\nalso in many of these peoples approaches the round form, whereas the\r\ntypical Negro is assumed to be long-headed[214].\" But so great is the\r\ndiversity of appearance throughout the whole of this region, including\r\neven \"a striking Semitic type,\" that this observer was driven to the\r\nconclusion that \"woolly hair, common to all, forms in fact the only sure\r\ncharacteristic of the Negro[215].\"\r\n\r\nDinka is the name given to a congeries of independent tribes spread over\r\na vast area, stretching from 300 miles south of Khartum to within 100\r\nmiles of Gondokoro, and reaching many miles to the west in the\r\nBahr-el-Ghazal Province. All these tribes according to C. G.\r\nSeligman[216] call themselves _Jieng_ or _Jenge_, corrupted by the\r\nArabs into Dinka; but no Dinka nation has arisen, for the tribes have\r\nnever recognised a supreme chief, as do their neighbours, the Shilluk,\r\nnor have they even been united under a military despot, as the Zulu were\r\nunited under Chaka. They differ in manners and customs and even in\r\nphysique and are often at war with one another. One of the most obvious\r\ndistinctions in habits is between the relatively powerful cattle-owning\r\nDinka and the small and comparatively poor tribes who have no cattle and\r\nscarcely cultivate the ground, but live in the marshes in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Sudd, and depend largely for their sustenance on\r\nfishing and hippopotamus-hunting. Their villages, which are generally\r\ndirty and evil-smelling, are built on ground which rises but little\r\nabove the reed-covered surface of the country. The Dinka community is\r\nlargely autonomous under leadership of a chief or headman (_bain_) who\r\nis sometimes merely the local magician, but in one community in each\r\ntribe he is the hereditary rain-maker whose wish is law. \"Cattle form\r\nthe economic basis of Dinka society; ... they are the currency in which\r\nbride-price and blood-fines are paid; and the desire to acquire a\r\nneighbour's herds is the common cause of those inter-tribal raids which\r\nconstitute Dinka warfare.\"\r\n\r\nSome uniformity appears to prevail amongst the languages of the\r\nNile-Welle lands, and from the rather scanty materials collected by\r\nJunker, Fr. Mueller was able to construct an \"Equatorial Linguistic\r\nFamily,\" including the Mangbattu, Zandeh, Barmbo, Madi, Bangba, Krej,\r\nGolo and others, on both sides of the water-parting. Leo Reinisch,\r\nhowever, was not convinced, and in a letter addressed to the author\r\ndeclared that \"in the absence of sentences it is impossible to determine\r\nthe grammatical structure of Mangbattu and the other languages. At the\r\nsame time we may detect certain relations, not to the Nilotic, but the\r\nBantu tongues. It may therefore be inferred that Mangbattu and the\r\nothers have a tolerably close relationship to the Bantu, and may even be\r\nremotely akin to it, judging from their tendency to prefix\r\nformations[217].\" Future research will show how far this conjecture is\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nAlthough Islam has made considerable progress, throughout the greater\r\npart of the Sudanese region, though not among the Nilotic tribes, the\r\nbulk of the people are still practically pagan. Witchcraft continues to\r\nflourish amongst the equatorial peoples, and important events are almost\r\neverywhere attended by sanguinary rites. These are absent among the true\r\nNilotics. The Dinka are totemic, with ancestor-worship. The Shilluk have\r\na cult of divine kings.\r\n\r\nCannibalism however, in some of its most repulsive forms, prevails\r\namongst the Zandehs, who barter in human fat as a universal staple of\r\ntrade, and amongst the Mangbattu, who cure for future use the bodies of\r\nthe slain in battle and \"drive their prisoners before them, as butchers\r\ndrive sheep to the shambles, and these are only reserved to fall victims\r\non a later day to their horrible and sickly greediness[218].\"\r\n\r\nIn fact here we enter the true \"cannibal zone,\" which, as I have\r\nelsewhere shown, was in former ages diffused all over Central and South\r\nAfrica, or, it would be more correct to say, over the whole\r\ncontinent[219], but has in recent times been mainly confined to \"the\r\nregion stretching west and east from the Gulf of Guinea to the western\r\nhead-streams of the White Nile, and from below the equator northwards in\r\nthe direction of Adamawa, Dar-Banda and Dar-Fertit. Wherever explorers\r\nhave penetrated into this least-known region of the continent they have\r\nfound the practice fully established, not merely as a religious rite or\r\na privilege reserved for priests, but as a recognised social\r\ninstitution[220].\"\r\n\r\nYet many of these cannibal peoples, especially the Mangbattus and\r\nZandehs, are skilled agriculturists, and cultivate some of the useful\r\nindustries, such as iron and copper smelting and casting, weaving,\r\npottery and wood-carving, with great success. The form and ornamental\r\ndesigns of their utensils display real artistic taste, while the temper\r\nof their iron implements is often superior to that of the imported\r\nEuropean hardware. Here again the observation has been made that the\r\ntribes most addicted to cannibalism also excel in mental qualities and\r\nphysical energy. Nor are they strangers to the finer feelings of human\r\nnature, and above all the surrounding peoples the Zandeh\r\nanthropophagists are distinguished by their regard and devotion for\r\ntheir women and children.\r\n\r\nIn one respect all these peoples show a higher degree of intelligence\r\neven than the Arabs and Hamites. \"My later experiences,\" writes Junker,\r\n\"revealed the remarkable fact that certain negro peoples, such as the\r\nNiam-Niams, the Mangbattus and the Bantus of Uganda and Unyoro, display\r\nquite a surprising understanding of figured illustrations or pictures of\r\nplastic objects, which is not as a rule exhibited by the Arabs and\r\nArabised Hamites of North-east Africa. Thus the Unyoro chief, Riongo,\r\nplaced photographs in their proper position, and was able to identify\r\nthe negro portraits as belonging to the Shuli, Lango, or other tribes,\r\nof which he had a personal knowledge. This I have called a remarkable\r\nfact, because it bespoke in the lower races a natural faculty for\r\nobservation, a power to recognise what for many Arabs or Egyptians of\r\nhigh rank was a hopeless puzzle. An Egyptian pasha in Khartum could\r\nnever make out how a human face in profile showed only one eye and one\r\near, and he took the portrait of a fashionable Parisian lady in\r\nextremely low dress for that of the bearded sun-burnt American naval\r\nofficer who had shown him the photograph[221].\" From this one is almost\r\ntempted to infer that, amongst Moslem peoples, all sense of plastic,\r\nfigurative, or pictorial art has been deadened by the Koranic precept\r\nforbidding the representation of the human form in any way.\r\n\r\nThe Welle peoples show themselves true Negroes in the possession of\r\nanother and more precious quality, the sense of humour, although this is\r\nprobably a quality which comes late in the life of a race. Anyhow it is\r\na distinct Negro characteristic, which Junker was able to turn to good\r\naccount during the building of his famous _Lacrima_ station in Ndoruma's\r\ncountry. \"In all this I could again notice how like children the Negroes\r\nare in many respects. Once at work they seemed animated by a sort of\r\nchildlike sense of honour. They delighted in praise, though even a frown\r\nor a word of reproach could also excite their hilarity. Thus a loud\r\nburst of laughter would, for instance, follow the contrast between a\r\npiece of good and bad workmanship. Like children, they would point the\r\nfinger of scorn at each other[222].\"\r\n\r\nOne morning Ndoruma, hearing that they had again struck work, had the\r\ngreat war-drum beaten, whereupon they rushed to arms and mustered in\r\ngreat force from all quarters. But on finding that there was no enemy to\r\nmarch against, and that they had only been summoned to resume operations\r\nat the station, they enjoyed the joke hugely, and after a general\r\nexplosion of laughter at the way they had been taken in, laid aside\r\ntheir weapons and returned cheerfully to work. Some English overseers\r\nhave already discovered that this characteristic may be utilised far\r\nmore effectively than the cruel kurbash. Ethnology has many such lessons\r\nto teach.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[129] For a tentative classification of African tribes see T. A. Joyce,\r\nArt. \"Africa: Ethnology,\" _Ency.

Barth, therefore, does not\r\nbring the people themselves, or their language, from Egypt, but only\r\nsome of their institutions, and that indirectly through the Aujila Oasis\r\nin Cyrenaica, and it may be added that this intercourse with Aujila\r\nappears to date only from about 1150 A.D.

While Sudanese Negro in phonology and\r\nperhaps in most of its word roots, it is Hamitic in its grammatical\r\nfeatures and pronouns. But the Hamitic element is thought by experts to\r\nbe as much Kushite, or even Koptic, as Libyan. \"On the whole, it seems\r\nprobable,\" says H. H.

It is remarkable what a difference there is between the\r\ncharacter of the ba-Haushe and the Kanuri--the former lively, spirited,\r\nand cheerful, the latter melancholic, dejected, and brutal; and the same\r\ndifference is visible in their physiognomies--the former having in\r\ngeneral very pleasant and regular features, and more graceful forms,\r\nwhile the Kanuri, with his broad face, his wide nostrils and his large\r\nbones, makes a far less agreeable impression, especially the women, who\r\nare very plain and certainly among the ugliest in all Negroland\" (II.\r\npp. 163-4).\r\n\r\n[196] See Nachtigal, II. p. 690.\r\n\r\n[197] For recent literature see Lady Lugard's _A Tropical Dependency_,\r\n1905, and the references, note 3, p. 58.\r\n\r\n[198] These are the same people as the _Tunjurs_ (_Tunzers_) of Darfur,\r\nregarding whose ethnical position so much doubt still prevails. Strange\r\nto say, they themselves claim to be Arabs, and the claim is allowed by\r\ntheir neighbours, although they are not Muhammadans. Lejean thinks they\r\nare Tibus from the north-west, while Nachtigal, who met some as far west\r\nas Kanem, concluded from their appearance and speech that they were\r\nreally Arabs settled for hundreds of years in the country (_op. cit._\r\nII. p. 256).\r\n\r\n[199] A.

In a later\r\ninscription of Rameses II at Karnak (1400 B.C.) occurs the form\r\n_Beraberata_, name of a southern people conquered by him. Hence Brugsch\r\n(_Reisebericht aus AEgypten_, pp. 127 and 155) is inclined to regard the\r\nmodern _Barabra_ as a true ethnical name confused in classical times\r\nwith the Greek and Roman _Barbarus_, but revived in its proper sense\r\nsince the Moslem conquest.

H. Johnston has shown that it coincides with\r\nthe lower course of the Rio del Rey, while farther east the French\r\nexpedition of 1891 under M. Dybowski found that it ran at about the same\r\nparallel (5 deg. N.) along the elevated plateau which here forms the\r\nwater-parting between the Congo and the Chad basin. From this point the\r\nline takes a south-easterly trend along the southern borders of the\r\nZandeh and Mangbattu territories to the Semliki Valley between Lakes\r\nAlbert Edward and Albert Nyanza, near the equator. Thence it pursues a\r\nsomewhat irregular course, first north by the east side of the Albert\r\nNyanza to the mouth of the Somerset Nile, then up that river to Mruli\r\nand round the east side of Usoga and the Victoria Nyanza to Kavirondo\r\nBay, where it turns nearly east to the sources of the Tana, and down\r\nthat river to its mouth in the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nAt some points the line traverses debatable territory, as in the Semliki\r\nValley, where there are Sudanese and Negrillo overlappings, and again\r\nbeyond Victoria Nyanza, where the frontiers are broken by the Hamitic\r\nMasai nomads and their Wandorobbo allies. But, speaking generally,\r\neverything south of the line here traced is Bantu, everything north of\r\nit Sudanese Negro in the western and central regions, and Hamitic in the\r\neastern section between Victoria Nyanza and the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn some districts the demarcation is not quite distinct, as in the Tana\r\nbasin, where some of the Galla and Somali Hamites from the north have\r\nencroached on the territory of the Wa-Pokomo Bantus on the south side of\r\nthe river. But on the central plateau M. Dybowski passed abruptly from\r\nthe territory of the Bonjos, northernmost of the Bantu tribes, to that\r\nof the Sudanese Bandziri, a branch of the widespread Zandeh people. In\r\nthis region, about the crest of the Congo-Chad water-parting, the\r\ncontrasts appear to be all in favour of the Sudanese and against the\r\nBantus, probably because here the former are Negroids, the latter\r\nfull-blood Negroes. Thus Dybowski[226] found the Bonjos to be a\r\ndistinctly Negro tribe with pronounced prognathism, and altogether a\r\nrude, savage people, trading chiefly in slaves, who are fattened for the\r\nmeat market, and when in good condition will fetch about twelve\r\nshillings. On the other hand the Bandziri, despite their Niam-Niam\r\nconnection, are not cannibals, but a peaceful, agricultural people,\r\nfriendly to travellers, and of a coppery-brown complexion, with regular\r\nfeatures, hence perhaps akin to the light-coloured people met by Barth\r\nin the Mosgu country.\r\n\r\nPossibly the Bonjos may be a degraded branch of the _Bayas_ or\r\n_Nderes_, a large nation, with many subdivisions widely diffused\r\nthroughout the Sangha basin, where they occupy the whole space between\r\nthe Kadei and the Mambere affluents of the main stream (3 deg. to 7 deg. 30' N.;\r\n14 deg. to 17 deg. E.). They are described by M. F. J. Clozel[227] as of tall\r\nstature, muscular, well-proportioned, with flat nose, slightly tumid\r\nlips, and of black colour, but with a dash of copper-red in the upper\r\nclasses. Although cannibals, like the Bonjos, they are in other respects\r\nan intelligent, friendly people, who, under the influence of the\r\nMuhammadan Fulahs, have developed a complete political administration,\r\nwith a Royal Court, a Chancellor, Speaker, Interpreter, and other\r\nofficials, bearing sonorous titles taken chiefly from the Hausa\r\nlanguage. Their own Bantu tongue is widespread and spoken with slight\r\ndialectic differences as far as the Nana affluents.\r\n\r\nM. Clozel, who regards them as mentally and morally superior to most of\r\nthe Middle and Lower Congo tribes, tells us that the Bayas, that is, the\r\n\"Red People,\" came at an unknown period from the east, \"yielding to that\r\ngreat movement of migration by which the African populations are\r\ncontinually impelled westwards.\" The Yangere section were still on the\r\nmove some twelve years ago, but the general migration has since been\r\narrested by the Fulahs of Adamawa. Human flesh is now interdicted to the\r\nwomen; they have domesticated the sheep, goat, and dog, and believe in a\r\nsupreme being called _So_, whose powers are manifested in the dense\r\nwoodlands, while minor deities preside over the village and the hut,\r\nthat is, the whole community and each separate family group. Thus both\r\ntheir religious and political systems present a certain completeness,\r\nwhich recalls those prevalent amongst the semi-civilised peoples of the\r\nequatorial lake region, and is evidently due to the same cause--long\r\ncontact or association with a race of higher culture and intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand all these relations, as well as the general\r\nconstitution of the Bantu populations, we have to consider that the\r\nalready-described Black Zone, running from the Atlantic seaboard\r\neastwards, has for countless generations been almost everywhere\r\narrested north of the equator by the White Nile. Probably since the\r\nclose of the Old Stone Age the whole of the region between the main\r\nstream and the Red Sea, and from the equator north to the Mediterranean,\r\nhas formed an integral part of the Hamitic domain, encroached upon in\r\nprehistoric times by Semites and others in Egypt and Abyssinia, and in\r\nhistoric times chiefly by Semites (Arabs) in Egypt, Upper Nubia, Senaar,\r\nand Somaliland. Between this region and Africa south of the equator\r\nthere are no serious physical obstructions of any kind, whereas farther\r\nwest the Hamitic Saharan nomads were everywhere barred access to the\r\nsouth by the broad, thickly-peopled plateaux of the Sudanese Black Zone.\r\nAll encroachments on this side necessarily resulted in absorption in the\r\nmultitudinous Negro populations of Central Sudan, with the modifications\r\nof the physical and mental characters which are now presented by the\r\nKanuri, Hausas, Songhai and other Negroid nations of that region, and\r\nare at present actually in progress amongst the conquering Fulah Hamites\r\nscattered in small dominant groups over a great part of Sudan from\r\nSenegambia to Wadai.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the leavening element, by which the southern Negro\r\npopulations have been diversely modified throughout the Bantu lands,\r\ncould have been drawn only from the Hamitic and Semitic peoples of the\r\nnorth-east. But in this connection the Semites themselves must be\r\nconsidered as almost _une quantite negligeable_, partly because of their\r\nrelatively later arrival from Asia, and partly because, as they arrived,\r\nthey became largely assimilated to the indigenous Hamitic inhabitants of\r\nEgypt, Abyssinia, and Somaliland. Belief in the presence of a Semitic\r\npeople in the interior of S.E. Africa in early historic times was\r\nsupported by the groups of ruins (especially those of Zimbabwe), found\r\nmainly in Southern Rhodesia, described in J. T. Bent's _Ruined Cities of\r\nMashonaland_. Exploration in 1905 dispelled the romance hitherto\r\nconnected with the \"temples\" and produced evidence to show that they\r\nwere not earlier in date than the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries and\r\nwere of native construction[228]. They probably served as distributing\r\ncentres for the gold traffic carried on with the Semitic traders of the\r\ncoast. For certainly in Muhammadan times Semites from Arabia formed\r\npermanent settlements along the eastern seaboard as far south as Sofala,\r\nand these intermingled more freely with the converted coast peoples\r\n(_Wa-Swahili_, from _sahel_ = \"coast\"), but not with the _Kafirs_, or\r\n\"Unbelievers,\" farther south and in the interior. In our own days these\r\nSwahili half-breeds, with a limited number of full-blood Arabs[229],\r\nhave penetrated beyond the Great Lakes to the Upper and Middle Congo\r\nbasin, but rather as slave-hunters and destroyers than as peaceful\r\nsettlers, and contracting few alliances, except perhaps amongst the\r\nWa-Yao and Ma-Gwangara tribes of Mozambique, and the cannibal Ma-Nyemas\r\nfarther inland.\r\n\r\nTo this extent Semitism may be recognised as a factor in the constituent\r\nelements of the Bantu populations. Malays have also been mentioned, and\r\nsome ethnologists have even brought the Fulahs of Western Sudan all the\r\nway from Malaysia. Certainly if they reached and formed settlements in\r\nMadagascar, there is no intrinsic reason why they should not have done\r\nthe same on the mainland. But I have failed to find any evidence of the\r\nfact, and if they ever at any time established themselves on the east\r\ncoast they have long disappeared, without leaving any clear trace of\r\ntheir presence either in the physical appearance, speech, usages or\r\nindustries of the aborigines, such as are everywhere conspicuous in\r\nMadagascar. The small canoes with two booms and double outriggers which\r\noccur at least from Mombasa to Mozambique are of Indonesian origin, as\r\nare the fish traps that occur at Mombasa.\r\n\r\nThere remain the north-eastern Hamites, and especially the Galla branch,\r\nas the essential extraneous factor in this obscure Bantu problem. To the\r\nstream of migration described by M. Clozel as setting east and west,\r\ncorresponds another and an older stream, which ages ago took a southerly\r\ndirection along the eastern seaboard to the extremity of the continent,\r\nwhere are now settled the Zulu-Xosa nations, almost more Hamites than\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\nThe impulse to two such divergent movements could have come only from\r\nthe north-east, where we still find the same tendencies in actual\r\noperation. During his exploration of the east equatorial lands, Capt.\r\nSpeke had already observed that the rulers of the Bantu nations about\r\nthe Great Lakes (Karagwe, Ba-Ganda, Ba-Nyoro, etc.) all belonged to the\r\nsame race, known by the name of _Ba-Hima_, that is, \"Northmen,\" a\r\npastoral people of fine appearance, who were evidently of Galla stock,\r\nand had come originally from Gallaland. Since then Schuver found that\r\nthe Negroes of the Afilo country are governed by a Galla\r\naristocracy[230], and we now know that several Ba-hima communities\r\nbearing different names live interspersed amongst the mixed Bantu\r\nnations of the lacustrian plateaux as far south as Lake Tanganyika and\r\nUnyamweziland[231]. Here the Wa-Tusi, Wa-Hha, and Wa-Ruanda are or were\r\nall of the same Hamitic type, and M. Lionel Decle \"was very much struck\r\nby the extraordinary difference that is to be found between them and\r\ntheir Bantu neighbours[232].\" Then this observer adds: \"Pure types are\r\nnot common, and are only to be found amongst the aristocracy, if I may\r\nuse such an expression for Africans. The mass of the people have lost\r\ntheir original type through intermixture with neighbouring tribes.\"\r\n\r\nJ. Roscoe[233] thus describes the inhabitants of Ankole. \"The pastoral\r\npeople are commonly called Bahima, though they prefer to be called\r\nBanyankole; they are a tall fine race though physically not very strong.\r\nMany of them are over six feet in height, their young king being six\r\nfeet six inches and broad in proportion to his height.... It is not only\r\nthe men who are so tall, the women also being above the usual stature of\r\ntheir sex among other tribes, though they do injustice to their height\r\nby a fashionable stoop which makes them appear much shorter than they\r\nreally are. The features of these pastoral people are good: they have\r\nstraight noses with a bridge, thin lips, finely chiselled faces, heads\r\nwell set on fairly developed frames, and a good carriage; there is in\r\nfact nothing but their colour and their short woolly hair to make you\r\nthink of them as negroids.\"\r\n\r\nThe contrast and the relationship between the pastoral conquerors and\r\nthe agricultural tribes is clearly seen among the Ba-Nyoro. \"The\r\npastoral people are a tall, well-built race of men and women with finely\r\ncut features, many of them over six feet in height. The men are athletic\r\nwith little spare flesh, but the women are frequently very fat and\r\ncorpulent: indeed their ideal of beauty is obesity, and their milk diet\r\ntogether with their careful avoidance of exercise tends to increase\r\ntheir size. The agricultural clans, on the other hand, are short,\r\nill-favoured looking men and women with broad noses of the negro type,\r\nlean and unkempt. Both classes are dark, varying in shade from a light\r\nbrown to deep black, with short woolly hair. The pastoral people\r\nrefrain, as far as possible, from all manual labour and expect the\r\nagricultural clans to do their menial work for them, such as building\r\ntheir houses, carrying firewood and water, and supplying them with grain\r\nand beer for their households.\" \"Careful observation and enquiry lead to\r\nthe opinion that the agricultural clans were the original inhabitants\r\nand that they were conquered by the pastoral people who have reduced\r\nthem to their present servile condition[234].\"\r\n\r\nFrom these indications and many others that might easily be adduced, it\r\nmay be concluded with some confidence that the great mass of the Bantu\r\npopulations are essentially Negroes, leavened in diverse proportions,\r\nfor the most part by conquering Galla or Hamitic elements percolating\r\nfor thousands of generations from the north-eastern section of the\r\nHamitic domain into the heart of Bantuland.\r\n\r\nThe date of the Bantu migrations is much disputed. \"As far as linguistic\r\nevidence goes,\" says H. H. Johnston[235], \"the ancestors of the Bantu\r\ndwelt in some region like the Bahr-al-Ghazal, not far from the Mountain\r\nNile on the east, from Kordofan on the north, or the Benue and Chad\r\nbasins on the west. Their first great movement of expansion seems to\r\nhave been eastward, and to have established them (possibly with a\r\nguiding aristocracy of Hamitic origin) in the region between Mount\r\nElgon, the Northern Victoria Nyanza, Tanganyika, and the Congo Forest.\r\nAt some such period as about 300 B.C. their far-reaching invasion of\r\nCentral and South Africa seems to have begun.\" The date is fixed by the\r\ndate of the introduction of the fowl from Nile-land, since the root word\r\nfor fowl is the same almost throughout Bantu Africa, \"obviously related\r\nto the Persian words for fowl, yet quite unrelated to the Semitic terms,\r\nor to those used by the Kushites of Eastern Africa.\" F. Stuhlmann, on\r\nthe contrary, places the migrations practically in geological times.\r\nAfter bringing the Sudan Negroes from South Asia at the end of the\r\nTertiary or beginning of the Pleistocene (_Pluvialperiod_), and the\r\nProto-Hamites from a region probably somewhat further to the north and\r\nwest of the former, he continues: From the mingling of the Negroes and\r\nthe Proto-Hamites were formed, probably in East Africa, the Bantu\r\nlanguages and the Bantu peoples, who wandered thence south and west. The\r\nwanderings began in the latter part of the Pleistocene period[236]. He\r\nquotes Th. Arldt, who with greater precision places the occupation of\r\nAfrica by the Negroes in the Riss period (300,000 years ago) and that of\r\nthe Hamites in the Mousterian period (30,000 to 50,000 years ago)[237].\r\n\r\nAll these peoples resulting from the crossings of Negroes with Hamites\r\nnow speak various forms of the same organic Bantu mother-tongue. But\r\nthis linguistic uniformity is strictly analogous to that now prevailing\r\namongst the multifarious peoples of Aryan speech in Eurasia, and is due\r\nto analogous causes--the diffusion in extremely remote times of a mixed\r\nHamito-Negro people of Bantu speech in Africa south of the equator. It\r\nmight perhaps be objected that the present Ba-Hima pastors are of\r\nHamitic speech, because we know from Stanley that the late king M'tesa\r\nof Buganda was proud of his Galla ancestors, whose language he still\r\nspoke as his mother-tongue. But he also spoke Luganda, and every echo\r\nof Galla speech has already died out amongst most of the Ba-Hima\r\ncommunities in the equatorial regions. So it was with what I may call\r\nthe \"Proto-Ba-Himas,\" the first conquering Galla tribes, Schuver's and\r\nDecle's \"aristocracy,\" who were gradually blended with the aborigines in\r\na new and superior nationality of Bantu speech, because \"there are many\r\nmixed races, ... but there are no mixed languages[238].\"\r\n\r\nThese views are confirmed by the traditions and folklore still current\r\namongst the \"Lacustrians,\" as the great nations may be called, who are\r\nnow grouped round about the shores of Lakes Victoria and Albert Nyanza.\r\nAt present, or rather before the recent extension of the British\r\nadministration to East Central Africa, these peoples were constituted in\r\na number of separate kingdoms, the most powerful of which were Buganda\r\n(Uganda)[239], Bunyoro (Unyoro), and Karagwe. But they remember a time\r\nwhen all these now scattered fragments formed parts of a mighty\r\nmonarchy, the vast Kitwara Empire, which comprised the whole of the\r\nlake-studded plateau between the Ruwenzori range and Kavirondoland.\r\n\r\nThe story is differently told in the different states, each nation being\r\neager to twist it to its own glorification; but all are agreed that the\r\nfounder of the empire was Kintu, \"The Blameless,\" at once priest,\r\npatriarch and ruler of the land, who came from the north hundreds of\r\nyears ago, with one wife, one cow, one goat, one sheep, one chicken, one\r\nbanana-root, and one sweet potato. At first all was waste, an\r\nuninhabited wilderness, but it was soon miraculously peopled, stocked,\r\nand planted with what he had brought with him, the potato being\r\napportioned to Bunyoro, the banana to Buganda, and these form the staple\r\nfood of those lands to this day.\r\n\r\nThen the people waxed wicked, and Kintu, weary of their evil ways and\r\ndaily bloodshed, took the original wife, cow, and other things, and went\r\naway in the night and was seen no more. But nobody believed him dead,\r\nand a long line of his mythical successors appear to have spent the time\r\nthey could spare from strife and war and evil deeds in looking for the\r\nlost Kintu. Kimera, one of these, was a mighty giant of such strength\r\nand weight that he left his footprints on the rocks where he trod, as\r\nmay still be seen on a cliff not far from Ulagalla, the old capital of\r\nBuganda. There was also a magician, Kibaga, who could fly aloft and kill\r\nthe Ba-Nyoro people (this is the Buganda version) by hurling stones down\r\nupon them, and for his services received in marriage a beautiful\r\nBa-Nyoro captive, who, another Delilah, found out his secret, and\r\nbetrayed him to her people.\r\n\r\nAt last came King Ma'anda, who pretended to be a great hunter, but it\r\nwas only to roam the woodlands in search of Kintu, and thus have tidings\r\nof him. One day a peasant, obeying the directions of a thrice-dreamt\r\ndream, came to a place in the forest, where was an aged man on a throne\r\nbetween two rows of armed warriors, seated on mats, his long beard white\r\nwith age, and all his men fair as white people and clothed in white\r\nrobes. Then Kintu, for it was he, bid the peasant hasten to summon\r\nMa'anda thither, but only with his mother and the messenger. At the\r\nCourt Ma'anda recognised the stranger whom he had that very night seen\r\nin a dream, and so believed his words and at once set out with his\r\nmother and the peasant. But the Katikiro, or Prime Minister, through\r\nwhom the message had been delivered to the king, fearing treachery, also\r\nstarted on their track, keeping them just in view till the\r\ntrysting-place was reached. But Kintu, who knew everything, saw him all\r\nthe time, and when he came forward on finding himself discovered the\r\nenraged Ma'anda pierced his faithful minister to the heart and he fell\r\ndead with a shriek. Thereupon Kintu and his seated warriors instantly\r\nvanished, and the king with the others wept and cried upon Kintu till\r\nthe deep woods echoed Kintu, Kintu-u, Kintu-u-u. But the blood-hating\r\nKintu was gone, and to this day has never again been seen or heard of by\r\nany man in Buganda. The references to the north and to Kintu and his\r\nghostly warriors \"fair as white people\" need no comment[240]. It is\r\nnoteworthy that in some of the Nyassaland dialects _Kintu_ (_Caintu_)\r\nalternates with _Mulungu_ as the name of the Supreme Being, the great\r\nancestor of the tribe[241].\r\n\r\nThen follows more traditional or legendary matter, including an account\r\nof the wars with the fierce Wakedi, who wore iron armour, until\r\nauthentic history is reached with the atrocious Suna II (1836-60),\r\nfather of the scarcely less atrocious M'tesa. After his death in 1884\r\nBuganda and the neighbouring states passed rapidly through a series of\r\nastonishing political, religious, and social vicissitudes, resulting in\r\nthe present _pax Britannica_, and the conversion of large numbers, some\r\nto Islam, others to one form or another of Christianity. At times it\r\nmight have been difficult to see much religion in the ferocity of the\r\ncontending factions; but since the establishment of harmony by the\r\nsecular arm, real progress has been made, and the Ba-Ganda especially\r\nhave displayed a remarkable capacity as well as eagerness to acquire a\r\nknowledge of letters and of religious principles, both in the Protestant\r\nand the Roman Catholic communities. Printing-presses, busily worked by\r\nnative hands, are needed to meet the steadily increasing demand for a\r\nvernacular literature, in a region where blood had flowed continually\r\nfrom the disappearance of \"Kintu\" till the British occupation.\r\n\r\nTo the admixture of the Hamitic and Negro elements amongst the\r\nLacustrians may perhaps be attributed the curious blend of primitive and\r\nhigher institutions in these communities. At the head of the State was a\r\nKabaka, king or emperor, although the title was also borne by the\r\nqueen-mother and the queen-sister. This autocrat had his _Lukiko_, or\r\nCouncil, of which the members were the _Katikiro_, Prime Minister and\r\nChief Justice, the _Kimbugwe_, who had charge of the King's umbilical\r\ncord, and held rank next to the _Katikiro_, and ten District chiefs, for\r\nthe administration of the ten large districts into which the country was\r\ndivided, each rendering accounts to the _Katikiro_ and through him to\r\nthe King. Each District chief had to maintain in good order a road some\r\nfour yards wide, reaching from the capital to his country seat, a\r\ndistance possibly of nearly 100 miles. Each District chief had\r\nsub-chiefs under him, independent of the chief in managing their own\r\nportion of land. These were responsible for keeping in repair the road\r\nbetween their own residence and that of the District chief. In each\r\ndistrict was a supreme court, and every sub-chief, even with only a\r\ndozen followers, could hold a court and try cases among his own people.\r\nThe people, however, could take their cases from one court to another\r\nuntil eventually they came before the _Katikiro_ or the King.\r\n\r\nYet together with this highly advanced social and political development\r\na totemic exogamous clan system was in force throughout Uganda, all the\r\nBa-Ganda belonging to one of 29 _kika_ or clans, each possessing two\r\ntotems held sacred by the clan. Thus the Lion (_Mpologoma_) clan had the\r\nEagle (_Mpungu_) for its second totem; the Mushroom (_Butiko_) clan had\r\nthe Snail (_Nsonko_); the Buffalo (_Mbogo_) clan had a New Cooking Pot\r\n(_Ntamu_). Each clan had its chief, or Father, who resided on the clan\r\nestate which was also the clan burial-ground, and was responsible for\r\nthe conduct of the members of his branch. All the clans were\r\nexogamous[242], and a man was expected to take a second wife from the\r\nclan of his paternal grandmother[243].\r\n\r\nNo direct relations appear to exist between the Lacustrians and the\r\n_Wa-Kikuyu_, _Wa-Kamba_, _Wa-Pokomo_, Wa-Gweno, _Wa-Chaga_, _Wa-Teita_,\r\n_Wa-Taveita_, and others[244], who occupy the region east of Victoria\r\nNyanza, between the Tana, north-east frontier of Bantuland, and the\r\nsouthern slopes of Kilimanjaro. Their affinities seem to be rather with\r\nthe _Wa-Nyika_, _Wa-Boni_, _Wa-Duruma_, _Wa-Giryama_, and the other\r\ncoast tribes between the Tana and Mombasa. All of these tribes have more\r\nor less adopted the habits and customs of the Masai.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Sir A. Harding[245] that in the British East African\r\nProtectorate there are altogether as many as twenty-five distinct\r\ntribes, generally at a low stage of culture, with a loose tribal\r\norganisation, a fully-developed totemic system, and a universal faith in\r\nmagic; but there are no priests, idols or temples, or even distinctly\r\nrecognised hereditary chiefs or communal councils. The Gallas, who have\r\ncrossed the Tana and here encroached on Bantu territory, have\r\nreminiscences of a higher civilisation and apparently of Christian\r\ntraditions and observances, derived no doubt from Abyssinia. They tell\r\nyou that they had once a sacred book, the observance of whose precepts\r\nmade them the first of nations. But it was left lying about, and so got\r\neaten by a cow, and since then when cows are killed their entrails are\r\ncarefully searched for the lost volume.\r\n\r\nExceptional interest attaches to the Wa-Giryama, who are the chief\r\npeople between Mombasa and Melindi, the first trustworthy accounts of\r\nwhom were contributed by W. E. Taylor[246], and W. W. A.\r\nFitzgerald[247]. Here again Bantus and Gallas are found in close\r\ncontact, and we learn that the Wa-Giryama, who came originally from the\r\nMount Mangea district in the north-east, occupied their present homes\r\nonly about a century ago \"upon the withdrawal of the Gallas.\" The\r\nlanguage, which is of a somewhat archaic type, appears to be the chief\r\nmember of a widespread Bantu group, embracing the Ki-nyika, and\r\nKi-pokomo in the extreme north, the Ki-swahili of the Zanzibar coast,\r\nand perhaps the Ki-kamba, the Ki-teita, and others of the interior\r\nbetween the coastlands and Victoria Nyanza. These inland tongues,\r\nhowever, have greatly diverged from the primitive Ki-giryama[248], which\r\nstands in somewhat the same relation to them and to the still more\r\ndegraded and Arabised Ki-swahili[249] that Latin stands to the Romance\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nBut the chief interest presented by the Wa-Giryama is centred in their\r\nreligious ideas, which are mainly connected with ancestry-worship, and\r\nafford an unexpected insight into the origin and nature of that perhaps\r\nmost primitive of all forms of belief. There is, of course, a vague\r\nentity called a \"Supreme Being\" in ethnographic writings, who, like the\r\nAlgonquian Manitu, crops up under various names (here _Mulungu_) all\r\nover east Bantuland, but on analysis generally resolves itself into some\r\ndim notion growing out of ancestry-worship, a great or aged person,\r\neponymous hero or the like, later deified in diverse ways as the\r\nPreserver, the Disposer, and especially the Creator. These Wa-Giryama\r\nsuppose that from his union with the Earth all things have sprung, and\r\nthat human beings are Mulungu's hens and chickens. But there is also an\r\nidea that he may be the manes of their fathers, and thus everything\r\nbecomes merged in a kind of apotheosis of the departed. They think \"the\r\ndisembodied spirit is powerful for good and evil. Individuals worship\r\nthe shades of their immediate ancestors or elder relatives; and the\r\n_k'omas_ [souls?] of the whole nation are worshipped on public\r\noccasions.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the European ghost or \"revenant\" is unknown, the spirits of\r\nnear ancestors may appear in dreams, and express their wishes to the\r\nliving. They ask for sacrifices at their graves to appease their hunger,\r\nand such sacrifices are often made with a little flour and water poured\r\ninto a coconut shell let into the ground, the fowls and other victims\r\nbeing so killed that the blood shall trickle into the grave. At the\r\noffering the dead are called on by name to come and partake, and bring\r\ntheir friends with them, who are also mentioned by name. But whereas\r\nChristians pray to be remembered of heaven and the saints, the\r\nWa-Giryama pray rather that the new-born babe be forgotten of Mulungu,\r\nand so live. \"Well!\" they will say on the news of a birth, \"may Mulungu\r\nforget him that he may become strong and well.\" This is an instructive\r\ntrait, a reminiscence of the time when Mulungu, now almost harmless or\r\nindifferent to mundane things, was the embodiment of all evil, hence to\r\nbe feared and appeased in accordance with the old dictum _Timor fecit\r\ndeos_.\r\n\r\nAt present no distinction is drawn between good and bad spirits, but all\r\nare looked upon as, of course, often, though not always, more powerful\r\nthan the living, but still human beings subject to the same feelings,\r\npassions, and fancies as they are. Some are even poor weaklings on whom\r\nofferings are wasted. \"The Shade of So-and-so's father is of no use at\r\nall; it has finished up his property, and yet he is no better,\" was a\r\nnative's comment on the result of a series of sacrifices a man had\r\nvainly made to his father's shade to regain his health. They may also be\r\nduped and tricked, and when _pombe_ (beer) is a-brewing, some is poured\r\nout on the graves of the dead, with the prayer that they may drink, and\r\nwhen drunk fall asleep, and so not disturb the living with their brawls\r\nand bickerings, just like the wrangling fairies in _A Midsummer Night's\r\nDream_[250].\r\n\r\nFar removed from such crass anthropomorphism, but not morally much\r\nimproved, are the kindred Wa-Swahili, who by long contact and\r\ninterminglings have become largely Arabised in dress, religion, and\r\ngeneral culture. They are graphically described by Taylor as \"a\r\nseafaring, barter-loving race of slave-holders and slave-traders, strewn\r\nin a thin line along a thousand miles of creeks and islands; inhabitants\r\nof a coast that has witnessed incessant political changes, and a\r\nsuccession of monarchical dynasties in various centres; receiving into\r\ntheir midst for ages past a continuous stream of strange blood,\r\nconsisting not only of serviles from the interior, but of immigrants\r\nfrom Persia, Arabia, and Western India; men that have come to live, and\r\noften to die, as resident aliens, leaving in many cases a hybrid\r\nprogeny. Of one section of these immigrants--the Arabs--the religion has\r\nbecome the master-religion of the land, overspreading, if not entirely\r\nsupplanting, the old Bantu ancestor-worship, and profoundly affecting\r\nthe whole family life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wa-Swahili are in a sense a historical people, for they formed the\r\nchief constituent elements of the renowned Zang (Zeng) empire[251],\r\nwhich in Edrisi's time (twelfth century) stretched along the seaboard\r\nfrom Somaliland to and beyond the Zambesi. When the Portuguese burst\r\nsuddenly into the Indian Ocean it was a great and powerful state,\r\nor rather a vast confederacy of states, with many flourishing\r\ncities--Magdoshu, Brava, Mombasa, Melindi, Kilwa, Angosha, Sofala--and\r\nwidespread commercial relations extending across the eastern waters\r\nto India and China, and up the Red Sea to Europe. How these great\r\ncentres of trade and eastern culture were one after the other\r\nruthlessly destroyed by the Portuguese corsairs _co' o ferro e fogo_\r\n(\"with sword and fire,\" Camoens) is told by Duarte Barbosa, who was\r\nhimself a Portuguese and an eyewitness of the havoc and the horrors\r\nthat not infrequently followed in the trail of his barbarous\r\nfellow-countrymen[252].\r\n\r\nBeyond Sofala we enter the domain of the _Ama-Zulu_, the _Ama-Xosa_, and\r\nothers whom I have collectively called _Zulu-Xosas_[253], and who are in\r\nsome respects the most remarkable ethnical group in all Bantuland.\r\nIndeed they are by common consent regarded as Bantus in a preeminent\r\nsense, and this conventional term _Bantu_ itself is taken from their\r\ntypical Bantu language[254]. There is clear evidence that they are\r\ncomparatively recent arrivals, necessarily from the north, in their\r\npresent territory, which was still occupied by Bushman and Hottentot\r\ntribes probably within the last thousand years or so. Before the Kafir\r\nwars with the English (1811-77) this territory extended much farther\r\nround the coast than at present, and for many years the Great Kei River\r\nhas formed the frontier between the white settlements and the Xosas.\r\n\r\nBut what they have lost in this direction the Zulu-Xosas, or at least\r\nthe Zulus, have recovered a hundredfold by their expansion northwards\r\nduring the nineteenth century. After the establishment of the Zulu\r\nmilitary power under Dingiswayo and his successor Chaka (1793-1828),\r\nhalf the continent was overrun by organised Zulu hordes, who ranged as\r\nfar north as Victoria Nyanza, and in many places founded more or less\r\nunstable kingdoms or chieftaincies on the model of the terrible\r\ndespotism set up in Zululand. Such were, beyond the Limpopo, the states\r\nof Gazaland and Matabililand, the latter established about 1838 by\r\nUmsilikatzi, father of Lobengula, who perished in a hopeless struggle\r\nwith the English in 1894. Gungunhana, last of the Swazi (Zulu) chiefs in\r\nGazaland, where the A-Ngoni had overrun the Ba-Thonga (Ba-Ronga)[255],\r\nwas similarly dispossessed by the Portuguese in 1896.\r\n\r\nNorth of Zambesi the Zulu bands--Ma-Situ, Ma-Viti, Ma-Ngoni (A-Ngoni),\r\nand others--nowhere developed large political states except for a short\r\ntime under the ubiquitous Mirambo in Unyamweziland. But some, especially\r\nthe A-Ngoni[256], were long troublesome in the Nyasa district, and\r\nothers about the Lower Zambesi, where they are known to the Portuguese\r\nas \"Landins.\" The A-Ngoni power was finally broken by the English early\r\nin 1898, and the reflux movement has now entirely subsided, and cannot\r\nbe revived, the disturbing elements having been extinguished at the\r\nfountain-head by the absorption of Zululand itself in the British Colony\r\nof Natal (1895).\r\n\r\nNowhere have patriarchal institutions been more highly developed than\r\namong the Zulu-Xosas, all of whom, except perhaps the Ama-Fingus and\r\nsome other broken groups, claim direct descent from some eponymous hero\r\nor mythical founder of the tribe. Thus in the national traditions Chaka\r\nwas seventh in descent from a legendary chief Zulu, from whom they take\r\nthe name of _Abantu ba-Kwa-Zulu_, that is \"People of Zulu's Land,\"\r\nalthough the true mother-tribe appear to have been the now extinct\r\nAma-Ntombela. Once the supremacy and prestige of Chaka's tribe were\r\nestablished, all the others, as they were successively reduced, claimed\r\nalso to be true Zulus, and as the same process went on in the far north,\r\nthe term Zulu has now in many cases come to imply political rather than\r\nblood relationship. Here we have an object lesson, by which the ethnical\r\nvalue of such names as \"Aryan,\" \"Kelt,\" \"Briton,\" \"Slav,\" etc. may be\r\ngauged in other regions.\r\n\r\nSo also most of the southern section claim as their founder and ancestor\r\na certain _Xosa_, sprung from Zuide, who may have flourished about 1500,\r\nand whom the Ama-Tembus and Ama-Mpondos also regard as their progenitor.\r\nThus the whole section is connected, but not in the direct line, with\r\nthe Xosas, who trace their lineage from Galeka and Khakhabe, sons of\r\nPalo, who is said to have died about 1780, and was himself tenth in\r\ndirect descent from Xosa. We thus get a genealogical table as under,\r\nwhich gives his proper place in the Family Tree to nearly every\r\nhistorical \"Kafir\" chief in Cape Colony, where ignorance of these\r\nrelations caused much bloodshed during the early Kafir wars:\r\n\r\n                             Zuide (1500?)\r\n        _______________________/\\________________________\r\n       /                                                 \\\r\n     Tembu                   Xosa (1530?)

The hair is\r\nuniformly of a somewhat frizzly texture, the colour of a light or clear\r\nbrown amongst the Ama-Tembus, but elsewhere very dark, the Swazis being\r\nalmost \"blue-black\"; the head decidedly long (72.5) and high (195.8);\r\nnose variable, both Negroid and perfectly regular; height above the mean\r\n1.75 m. to 1.8 m. (5 ft. 9 in. to 5 ft. 11 in.); figure shapely and\r\nmuscular, though Fritsch's measurements show that it is sometimes far\r\nfrom the almost ideal standard of beauty with which some early observers\r\nhave credited them.\r\n\r\nMentally the Zulu-Xosas stand much higher than the true Negro, as shown\r\nespecially in their political organisation, which, before the\r\ndevelopment of Dingiswayo's military system under European influences,\r\nwas a kind of patriarchal monarchy controlled by a powerful aristocracy.\r\nThe nation was grouped in tribes connected by the ties of blood and\r\nruled by the hereditary _inkose_, or feudal chief, who was supreme, with\r\npower of life and death, within his own jurisdiction. Against his\r\nmandates, however, the nobles could protest in council, and it was in\r\nfact their decisions that established precedents and the traditional\r\ncode of common law. \"This common law is well adapted to a people in a\r\nrude state of society. It holds everyone accused of crime guilty unless\r\nhe can prove himself innocent; it makes the head of the family\r\nresponsible for the conduct of all its branches, the village\r\ncollectively for all resident in it, and the clan for each of its\r\nvillages. For the administration of the law there are courts of various\r\ngrades, from any of which an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Council,\r\npresided over by the paramount chief, who is not only the ruler but also\r\nthe father of the people[257].\"\r\n\r\nIn the interior, between the southern coast ranges and the Zambesi, the\r\nHottentot and Bushman aborigines were in prehistoric ages almost\r\neverywhere displaced or reduced to servitude by other Bantu peoples such\r\nas the Ma-Kalakas and Ma-Shonas, the Be-Chuanas and the kindred\r\nBa-Sutos. Of these the first arrivals (from the north) appear to have\r\nbeen the Ma-Shonas and Ma-Kalakas, who were being slowly \"eaten up\" by\r\nthe Ma-Tabili when the process was arrested by the timely intervention\r\nof the English in Rhodesia.\r\n\r\nBoth nations are industrious tillers of the soil, skilled in metal-work\r\nand in mining operations, being probably the direct descendants of the\r\nnatives, whose great chief _Monomotapa_, _i.e._ \"Lord of the Mines,\" as\r\nI interpret the word[258], ruled over the Manica and surrounding\r\nauriferous districts when the Portuguese first reached Sofala early in\r\nthe sixteenth century. Apparently for political reasons[259] this\r\nMonomotapa was later transformed by them from a monarch to a monarchy,\r\nthe vast empire of Monomotapaland, which was supposed to comprise pretty\r\nwell everything south of the Zambesi, but, having no existence, has for\r\nthe last two hundred years eluded the diligent search of historical\r\ngeographers.\r\n\r\nBut some centuries before the arrival of the Portuguese the Ma-Kalakas\r\nwith the kindred Ba-Nyai, Ba-Senga and others, may well have been at\r\nwork in the mines of this auriferous region, in the service of the\r\nbuilders of the Zimbabwe ruins explored and described by the late\r\nTheodore Bent[260], and by him and many others attributed to some\r\nancient cultured people of South Arabia. This theory of prehistoric\r\nOriental origin was supported by a calculation of the orientation of the\r\nZimbabwe \"temple,\" by reports of inscriptions and emblems suggesting\r\n\"Phoenician rites,\" and by the discovery, during excavation, of foreign\r\nobjects. Later investigation, however, showed that the orientation was\r\nbased on inexact measurements; no authentic inscriptions were found\r\neither at Zimbabwe or elsewhere in connection with the ruins; none of\r\nthe objects discovered in the course of the excavations could be\r\nrecognised as more than a few centuries old, while those that were not\r\ndemonstrably foreign imports were of African type. In 1905 a scientific\r\nexploration of the ruins placed these facts beyond dispute. The\r\nmedieval objects were found in such positions as to be necessarily\r\ncontemporaneous with the foundation of the buildings, all of which could\r\nbe attributed to the same period. Finally it was established that the\r\nplan and construction of Zimbabwe instead of being unique, as was\r\nformerly supposed, only differed from other Rhodesian ruins in\r\ndimensions and extent. The explorers felt confident that the buildings\r\nwere not earlier than the fourteenth or fifteenth century A.D., and that\r\nthe builders were the Bantu people, remains of whose stone-faced kraals\r\nare found at so many places between the Limpopo and the Zambesi. Their\r\nconclusions, however, have not met with universal acceptance[261].\r\n\r\nWith the Be-Chuanas, whose territory extends from the Orange river to\r\nLake Ngami and includes Basutoland with a great part of the Transvaal,\r\nwe again meet a people at the totemic stage of culture. Here the\r\neponymous heroes of the Zulu-Xosas are replaced by baboons, fishes,\r\nelephants, and other animals from which the various tribal groups claim\r\ndescent. The animal in question is called the _siboko_ of the tribe and\r\nis held in especial reverence, members (as a rule) refraining from\r\nkilling or eating it. Many tribes take their name from their _siboko_,\r\nthus the Ba-Tlapin, \"they of the fish,\" Ba-Kuena, \"they of the\r\ncrocodile.\" The _siboko_ of the Ba-Rolong, who as a tribe are\r\naccomplished smiths, is not an animal, but the metal iron[262].\r\n\r\nWith a section of the great Be-Chuana family, the Ba-Suto, and the\r\nBa-Rotse is connected one of the most remarkable episodes in the\r\nturbulent history of the South African peoples during the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Many years ago an offshoot of the Ba-Rotse migrated to the\r\nMiddle Zambesi above the Victoria Falls, where they founded a powerful\r\nstate, the \"Barotse (Marotse) Empire,\" which despite a temporary eclipse\r\nstill exists as a British protectorate. The eclipse was caused by\r\nanother migration northwards of a great body of Ma-Kololo, a branch of\r\nthe Ba-Suto, who under the renowned chief Sebituane reached the Zambesi\r\nabout 1835 and overthrew the Barotse dynasty, reducing the natives to a\r\nstate of servitude.\r\n\r\nBut after the death of Sebituane's successor, Livingstone's Sekeletu,\r\nthe Ba-Rotse, taking advantage of their oppressors' dynastic rivalries,\r\nsuddenly revolted, and after exterminating the Ma-Kololo almost to the\r\nlast man, reconstituted the empire on a stronger footing than ever. It\r\nnow comprises an area of some 250,000 square miles between the Chobe and\r\nthe Kafukwe affluents[263], with a population vaguely estimated at over\r\n1,000,000, including the savage Ba-Shukulumbwe tribes of the Kafukwe\r\nbasin reduced in 1891[264].\r\n\r\nYet, short as was the Ma-Kololo rule (1835-70), it was long enough to\r\nimpose their language on the vanquished Ba-Rotse[265]. Hence the curious\r\nphenomenon now witnessed about the Middle Zambesi, where the Ma-Kololo\r\nhave disappeared, while their Sesuto speech remains the common medium of\r\nintercourse throughout the Barotse empire. How often have analogous\r\nshiftings and dislocations taken place in the course of ages in other\r\nparts of the world! And in the light of such lessons how cautious\r\nethnographists should be in arguing from speech to race, and drawing\r\nconclusions from these or similar surface relations!\r\n\r\nReferring to these stirring events, Mackenzie writes: \"Thus perished the\r\nMakololo from among the number of South African tribes. No one can put\r\nhis finger on the map of Africa and say, 'Here dwell the\r\nMakololo[266].'\" This will puzzle many who since the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century have repeatedly heard of, and even been in\r\nunpleasantly close contact with, Ma-Kololo so called, not indeed in\r\nBarotseland, but lower down the Zambesi about its Shire affluent.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the seeming contradiction is given by another\r\nincident, which is also not without ethnical significance. From\r\nLivingstone's _Journals_ we learn that in 1859 he was accompanied to the\r\neast coast by a small party of Ma-Kololo and others, sent by his friend\r\nSekeletu in quest of a cure for leprosy, from which the emperor was\r\nsuffering. These Ma-Kololo, hearing of the Ba-Rotse revolt, wisely\r\nstopped on their return journey at the Shire confluence, and through the\r\nprestige of their name have here succeeded in founding several so-called\r\n\"Makololo States,\" which still exist, and have from time to time given\r\nconsiderable trouble to the administrators of British Central Africa.\r\nBut how true are Mackenzie's words, if the political be separated from\r\nthe ethnical relations, may be judged from the fact that of the original\r\nfounders of these petty Shire states only two were full-blood Ma-Kololo.\r\nAll the others were, I believe, Ba-Rotse, Ba-Toka, or Ba-Tonga, these\r\nakin to the savage Ba-Shukulumbwe.\r\n\r\nThus the Ma-Kololo live on, in their speech above the Victoria Falls, in\r\ntheir name below the Victoria Falls, and it is only from history we know\r\nthat since about 1870 the whole nation has been completely wiped out\r\neverywhere in the Zambesi valley. But even amongst cultured peoples\r\nhistory goes back a very little way, 10,000 years at most anywhere. What\r\nchanges and shiftings may, therefore, have elsewhere also taken place\r\nduring prehistoric ages, all knowledge of which is now past\r\nrecovery[267]!\r\n\r\nFew Bantu peoples have lent a readier ear to the teachings of Christian\r\npropagandists than the Xosa, Ba-Suto, and Be-Chuana natives. Several\r\nstations in the heart of Kafirland--Blythswood, Somerville, Lovedale,\r\nand others--have for some time been self-supporting, and prejudice alone\r\nwould deny that they have worked for good amongst the surrounding Gaika,\r\nGaleka, and Fingo tribes. Sogo, a member of the Blythswood community,\r\nhas produced a translation of the _Pilgrim's Progress_, described by J.\r\nMacdonald as \"a marvel of accuracy and lucidity of expression[268]\";\r\nnumerous village schools are eagerly attended, and much land has been\r\nbrought under intelligent cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe French and Swiss Protestant teachers have also achieved great things\r\nin Basutoland, where they were welcomed by Moshesh, the founder of the\r\npresent Basuto nation. The tribal system has yielded to a higher social\r\norganisation, and the Ba-Tau, Ba-Puti, and several other tribal groups\r\nhave been merged in industrious pastoral and agricultural communities\r\nprofessing a somewhat strict form of Protestant Christianity, and\r\nentirely forgetful of the former heathen practices associated with\r\nwitchcraft and ancestry-worship. Moshesh was one of the rare instances\r\namong the Kafirs of a leader endowed with intellectual gifts which\r\nplaced him on a level with Europeans. He governed his people wisely and\r\nwell for nearly fifty years, and his life-work has left a permanent mark\r\non South African history[269].\r\n\r\nIn Bechuanaland one great personality dominates the social horizon.\r\nKhama, king of the Ba-Mangwato nation, next to the Ba-Rotse the most\r\npowerful section of the Be-Chuana, may be described as a true father of\r\nhis people, a Christian legislator in the better sense of the term, and\r\nan enlightened reformer even from the secular point of view.\r\n\r\nWhen these triumphs, analogous to those witnessed amongst the\r\nLacustrians and in other parts of Bantuland, are contrasted with the\r\ndull weight of resistance everywhere opposed by the full-blood Negro\r\npopulations to any progress beyond their present low level of culture,\r\nwe are the better able to recognise the marked intellectual superiority\r\nof the negroid Bantu over the pure black element.\r\n\r\nWest of Bechuanaland the continuity of the Bantu domain is arrested in\r\nthe south by the Hottentots, who still hold their ground in Namaqualand,\r\nand farther north by the few wandering Bushman groups of the Kalahari\r\ndesert. Even in Damaraland, which is mainly Bantu territory, there are\r\ninterminglings of long standing that have given rise to much ethnical\r\nconfusion. The Ova-Herero, who were here dominant, and the kindred\r\nOva-Mpo of Ovampoland bordering on the Portuguese possessions, are\r\nundoubted Bantus of somewhat fine physique, though intellectually not\r\nspecially distinguished. Owing to the character of the country, a\r\nsomewhat arid, level steppe between the hills and the coast, they are\r\noften collectively called \"Cattle Damaras,\" or \"Damaras of the Plains,\"\r\nin contradistinction to the \"Hill Damaras\" of the coast ranges. To this\r\npopular nomenclature is due the prevalent confusion regarding these\r\naborigines. The term \"Damara\" is of Hottentot origin, and is not\r\nrecognised by the local tribes, who all call themselves Ova-Herero, that\r\nis, \"Merry People.\" But there is a marked difference between the\r\nlowlanders and the highlanders, the latter, that is, the \"Hill Damaras,\"\r\nhaving a strong strain of Hottentot blood, and being now of Hottentot\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThe whole region is a land of transition between the two races, where\r\nthe struggle for supremacy was scarcely arrested by the temporary\r\nintervention of German administrators. Though annexed by Germany in\r\n1884, fighting continued for ten years longer, and, breaking out again\r\nin 1903, was not subdued until 1908, after the loss to Germany of 5000\r\nlives and L15,000,000, while 20,000 to 30,000 of the Herero are\r\nestimated to have perished. Under the rule of the Union of South Africa\r\nthis maltreatment of the natives will never occur again. Clearness would\r\nbe gained by substituting for Hill Damaras the expression _Ova-Zorotu_,\r\nor \"Hillmen,\" as they are called by their neighbours of the plains, who\r\nshould of course be called Hereros to the absolute exclusion of the\r\nexpression \"Cattle Damaras.\" These Hereros show a singular dislike for\r\nsalt; the peculiarity, however, can scarcely be racial, as it is shared\r\nin also by their cattle, and may be due to the heavy vapours, perhaps\r\nslightly charged with saline particles, which hang so frequently over\r\nthe coastlands.\r\n\r\nNo very sharp ethnical line can be drawn between Portuguese West Africa\r\nand the contiguous portion of the Belgian Congo south and west of the\r\nmain stream. In the coastlands between the Cunene and the Congo estuary\r\na few groups, such as the historical _Eshi-Kongo_[270] and the\r\n_Kabindas_, have developed some marked characteristics under European\r\ninfluences, just as have the cannibal _Ma-Nyema_ of the Upper Congo\r\nthrough association with the Nubian-Arab slave-raiders. But with the\r\nexception of the _Ba-Shilange_, the _Ba-Lolo_ and one or two others,\r\nmuch the same physical and mental traits are everywhere presented by the\r\nnumerous Bantu populations within the great bend of the Congo.\r\n\r\nThe people who give their name to this river present some points of\r\nspecial interest. It is commonly supposed that the old \"Kongo Empire\"\r\nwas a creation of the Portuguese. But Mbanza, afterwards rechristened\r\n\"San Salvador,\" was already the capital of a powerful state when it was\r\nfirst visited by the expedition of 1491, from which time date its\r\nrelations with Portugal. At first the Catholic missionaries had great\r\nsuccess, thousands were at least baptised, and for a moment it seemed as\r\nif all the Congo lands were being swept into the fold. There were great\r\nrejoicings on the conversion of the _Mfumu_ (\"Emperor\") himself, on whom\r\nwere lavished honours and Portuguese titles still borne by his present\r\ndegenerate descendant, the Portuguese state pensioner, \"Dom Pedro V,\r\nCatholic King of Kongo and its Dependencies.\" But Christianity never\r\nstruck very deep roots, and, except in the vicinity of the Imperial and\r\nvassal Courts, heathenish practices of the worst description were\r\ncontinued down to the middle of the nineteenth century. About 1870 fresh\r\nefforts were made both by Protestant and Catholic missionaries to\r\nre-convert the people, who had little to remind them of their former\r\nfaith except the ruins of the cathedral of San Salvador, crucifixes,\r\nbanners, and other religious emblems handed down as heirlooms and\r\nregarded as potent fetishes by their owners. A like fate, it may be\r\nincidentally mentioned, has overtaken the efforts of the Portuguese\r\nmissionaries to evangelise the natives of the east coast, where little\r\nnow survives of their teachings but snatches of unintelligible songs to\r\nthe Blessed Virgin, such as that still chanted by the Lower Zambesi\r\nboatmen and recorded by Mrs Pringle:--\r\n\r\n  Sina mama, sina mamai,\r\n  Sina mama Maria, sina mamai ...\r\n\r\n  Mary, I'm alone, mother I have none,\r\n  Mother I have none, she and father both are gone, etc.[271]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that at some remote period the ruling race reached the\r\nwest coast from the north-east, and imposed their Bantu speech on the\r\nrude aborigines, by whom it is still spoken over a wide tract of country\r\non both sides of the Lower Congo. It is an extremely pure and somewhat\r\narchaic member of the Bantu family, and W. Holman Bentley, our best\r\nauthority on the subject, is enthusiastic in praise of its \"richness,\r\nflexibility, exactness, subtlety of idea, and nicety of expression,\" a\r\nlanguage superior to the people themselves, \"illiterate folk with an\r\nelaborate and regular grammatical system of speech of such subtlety and\r\nexactness of idea that its daily use is in itself an education[272].\"\r\nKishi-Kongo has the distinction of being the first Bantu tongue ever\r\nreduced to written form, the oldest known work in the language being a\r\ntreatise on Christian Doctrine published in Lisbon in 1624. Since that\r\ntime the speech of the \"Mociconghi,\" as Pigafetta calls them[273], has\r\nundergone but slight phonetic or other change, which is all the more\r\nsurprising when we consider the rudeness of the present Mushi-Kongos and\r\nothers by whom it is still spoken with considerable uniformity. Some of\r\nthese believe themselves sprung from trees, as if they had still\r\nreminiscences of the arboreal habits of a pithecoid ancestry.\r\n\r\nAmongst the neighbouring _Ba-Mba_, whose sobas were formerly _ex\r\nofficio_ Commanders-in-chief of the Empire, still dwells a potent being,\r\nwho is invisible to everybody, and although mortal never dies, or at\r\nleast after each dissolution springs again into life from his remains\r\ngathered up by the priests. All the young men of the tribe undergo a\r\nsimilar transformation, being thrown into a death-like trance by the\r\nmagic arts of the medicine-man, and then resuscitated after three days.\r\nThe power of causing the cataleptic sleep is said really to exist, and\r\nthese strange rites, unknown elsewhere, are probably to be connected\r\nwith the resurrection of Christ after three days and of everybody on the\r\nlast day as preached by the early Portuguese evangelists. A volume might\r\nbe written on the strange distortions of Christian doctrines amongst\r\nsavage peoples unable to grasp their true inwardness.\r\n\r\nIn Angola the Portuguese distinguish between the _Pretos_, that is, the\r\n\"civilised,\" and the _Negros_, or unreclaimed natives. Yet both terms\r\nmean the same thing, as also does _Ba-Fiot_[274], \"Black People,\" which\r\nis applied in an arbitrary way both to the Eshi-Kongos and their near\r\nrelations, the _Kabindas_ of the Portuguese enclave north of the Lower\r\nCongo. These Kabindas, so named from the seaport of that name on the\r\nLoango coast, are an extremely intelligent, energetic, and enterprising\r\npeople, daring seafarers, and active traders. But they complain of the\r\nkeen rivalry of another dark people, the _Judeos Pretos_, or \"Black\r\nJews,\" who call themselves _Ma-Vambu_, and whose hooked nose combined\r\nwith other peculiarities has earned for them their Portuguese name. The\r\nKabindas say that these \"Semitic Negroes\" were specially created for the\r\npunishment of other unscrupulous dealers by their ruinous competition in\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nA great part of the vast region within the bend of the Congo is occupied\r\nby the _Ba-Luba_ people, whose numerous branches--_Ba-Sange_ and\r\n_Ba-Songe_ about the sources of the Sankuru, _Ba-Shilange_\r\n(_Tushilange_) about the Lulua-Kassai confluence, and many\r\nothers--extend all the way from the Kwango basin to Manyemaland. Most of\r\nthese are Bantus of the average type, fairly intelligent, industrious\r\nand specially noted for their skill in iron and copper work. Iron ores\r\nare widely diffused and the copper comes from the famous mines of the\r\nKatanga district, of which King Mzidi and his Wa-Nyamwezi followers were\r\ndispossessed by the Congo Free State in 1892[275].\r\n\r\nSpecial attention is claimed by the _Ba-Shilange_ nation, for our\r\nknowledge of whom we are indebted chiefly to C. S. Latrobe Bateman[276].\r\nThese are the people whom Wissmann had already referred to as \"a nation\r\nof thinkers with the interrogative 'why' constantly on their lips.\"\r\nBateman also describes them as \"thoroughly honest, brave to\r\nfoolhardiness, and faithful to each other. They are prejudiced in favour\r\nof foreign customs and spontaneously copy the usages of civilisation.\r\nThey are the only African tribe among whom I have observed anything\r\nlike a becoming conjugal affection and regard. To say nothing of such\r\nrecommendations as their emancipation from fetishism, their ancient\r\nabandonment of cannibalism, and their national unity under the sway of a\r\nreally princely prince (Kalemba), I believe them to be the most open to\r\nthe best influences of civilisation of any African tribe\r\nwhatsoever[277].\" Their territory about the Lulua, affluent of the\r\nKassai, is the so-called Lubuka, or land of \"Friendship,\" the theatre of\r\na remarkable social revolution, carried out independently of all\r\nEuropean influences, in fact before the arrival of any whites on the\r\nscene. It was initiated by the secret brotherhood of the _Bena-Riamba_,\r\nor \"Sons of Hemp,\" established about 1870, when the nation became\r\ndivided into two parties over the question throwing the country open to\r\nforeign trade. The king having sided with the \"Progressives,\" the\r\n\"Conservatives\" were worsted with much bloodshed, whereupon the barriers\r\nof seclusion were swept away. Trading relations being at once\r\nestablished with the outer world, the custom of _riamba_ (bhang) smoking\r\nwas unfortunately introduced through the Swahili traders from Zanzibar.\r\nThe practice itself soon became associated with mystic rites, and was\r\nfollowed by a general deterioration of morals throughout Tushilangeland.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Ba-Luba follows the great _Ba-Lolo_ nation, whose domain\r\ncomprises nearly the whole of the region between the equator and the\r\nleft bank of the Congo, and whose Kilolo speech is still more widely\r\ndiffused, being spoken by perhaps 10,000,000 within the horseshoe bend.\r\nThese \"Men of Iron\" in the sense of Cromwell's \"Ironsides,\" or \"Workers\r\nin Iron,\" as the name has been diversely interpreted (from _lolo_,\r\niron), may not be all that they have been depicted by the glowing pen of\r\nMrs H. Grattan Guinness[278]; but nobody will deny their claim to be\r\nregarded as physically, if not mentally, one of the finest Bantu races.\r\nBut for the strain of Negro blood betrayed by the tumid under lip,\r\nfrizzly hair, and wide nostrils, many might pass for average Hamites\r\nwith high forehead, straight or aquiline nose, bright eye, and\r\nintelligent expression. They appear to have migrated about a hundred\r\nyears ago from the east to their present homes, where they have cleared\r\nthe land both of its forests and the aborigines, brought extensive\r\ntracts under cultivation, and laid out towns in the American chessboard\r\nfashion, but with the houses so wide apart that it takes hours to\r\ntraverse them. They are skilled in many crafts, and understand the\r\ndivision-of-labour principle, \"farmers, gardeners, smiths, boatbuilders,\r\nweavers, cabinet-makers, armourers, warriors, and speakers being already\r\ndifferentiated amongst them[279].\"\r\n\r\nFrom the east or north-east a great stream of migration has also for\r\nmany years been setting right across the cannibal zone to the west coast\r\nbetween the Ogowai and Cameruns estuary. Some of these cannibal bands,\r\ncollectively known as _Fans_, _Pahuins_, _Mpangwes_[280], _Oshyebas_ and\r\nby other names, have already swarmed into the Gabun and Lower Ogowai\r\ndistricts, where they have caused a considerable dislocation of the\r\ncoast tribes. They are at present the dominant, or at least the most\r\npowerful and dreaded, people in West Equatorial Africa, where nothing\r\nbut the intervention of the French administration has prevented them\r\nfrom sweeping the _Mpongwes_, _Mbengas_, _Okandas_, _Ashangos_,\r\n_Ishogos_, _Ba-Tekes_[281], and the other maritime populations into the\r\nAtlantic. Even the great _Ba-Kalai_ nation, who are also immigrants, but\r\nfrom the south-east, and who arrived some time before the Fans, have\r\nbeen hard pressed and driven forward by those fierce anthropophagists.\r\nThey are still numerous, certainly over 100,000, but confined mainly to\r\nthe left bank of the Ogowai, where their copper and iron workers have\r\ngiven up the hopeless struggle to compete with the imported European\r\nwares, and have consequently turned to trade. The Ba-Kalai are now the\r\nchief brokers and middlemen throughout the equatorial coastlands, and\r\ntheir pure Bantu language is encroaching on the Mpongwe in the Ogowai\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\nWhen first heard of by Bowdich in 1819, the Paaemways, as he calls the\r\nFans, were an inland people presenting such marked Hamitic or Caucasic\r\nfeatures that he allied them with the West Sudanese Fulahs. Since then\r\nthere have been inevitable interminglings, by which the type has no\r\ndoubt been modified, though still presenting distinct non-Bantu or\r\nnon-Negro characters. Burton, Winwood Reade, Oscar Lenz and most other\r\nobservers separate them altogether from the Negro connection, describing\r\nthem as \"well-built, tall and slim, with a light brown complexion, often\r\ninclining to yellow, well-developed beard, and very prominent frontal\r\nbone standing out in a semicircular protuberance above the superciliary\r\narches. Morally also, they differ greatly from the Negro, being\r\nremarkably intelligent, truthful, and of a serious temperament, seldom\r\nlaughing or indulging in the wild orgies of the blacks[282].\"\r\n\r\nM. H. Kingsley adds that \"the average height in mountain districts is\r\nfive feet six to five feet eight (1.67 m. to 1.72 m.), the difference in\r\nstature between men and women not being great. Their countenances are\r\nvery bright and expressive, and if once you have been among them, you\r\ncan never mistake a Fan. The Fan is full of fire, temper, intelligence\r\nand go; very teachable, rather difficult to manage, quick to take\r\noffence and utterly indifferent to human life.\" The cannibalism of the\r\nFans, though a prevalent habit, is not, according to Miss Kingsley, due\r\nto sacrificial motives. \"He does it in his common sense way. He will eat\r\nhis next door neighbour's relations and sell his own deceased to his\r\nnext door neighbour in return; but he does not buy slaves and fatten\r\nthem up for his table as some of the Middle Congo tribes do.... He has\r\nno slaves, no prisoners of war, no cemeteries, so you must draw your own\r\nconclusions[283].\" The Fan language has been grouped by Sir H. H.\r\nJohnston among Bantu tongues, but he describes it as so corrupt as to be\r\nonly just recognisable as Bantu. In linguistic, physical and mental\r\nfeatures they thus show a remarkable divergence from the pure Negro,\r\nsuggesting Hamitic probably Fulah elements.\r\n\r\nIn the Camerun region, which still lies within Bantu territory, Sir H.\r\nH. Johnston[284] divides the numerous local tribes into two groups, the\r\naborigines, such as the _Ba-Yong_, _Ba-Long_, _Ba-Sa_, _Abo_ and _Wuri_;\r\nand the later intruders--_Ba-Kundu_, _Ba-Kwiri_, _Dwala_, \"_Great\r\nBatanga_\" and _Ibea_--chiefly from the east and south-east. Best known\r\nare the Dwalas of the Camerun estuary, physically typical Bantus with\r\nalmost European features, and well-developed calves, a character which\r\nwould alone suffice to separate them from the true Negro. Nor are these\r\ntraits due to contact with the white settlers on the coast, because the\r\nDwalas keep quite aloof, and are so proud of their \"blue blood,\" that\r\ntill lately all half-breeds were \"weeded-out,\" being regarded as\r\nmonsters who reflected discredit on the tribe[285].\r\n\r\nSocially the Camerun natives stand at nearly the same low level of\r\nculture as the neighbouring full-blood Negroes of the Calabar and Niger\r\ndelta. Indeed the transition in customs and institutions, as well as in\r\nphysical appearance, is scarcely perceptible between the peoples\r\ndwelling north and south of the Rio del Rey, here the dividing line\r\nbetween the Negro and Bantu lands. The _Ba-Kish_ of the Meme river,\r\nalmost last of the Bantus, differ little except in speech from the Negro\r\n_Efiks_ of Old Calabar, while witchcraft and other gross superstitions\r\nwere till lately as rife amongst the Ba-Kwiri and Ba-Kundu tribes of the\r\nwestern Camerun as anywhere in Negroland. It is not long since one of\r\nthe Ba-Kwiri, found guilty of having eaten a chicken at a missionary's\r\ntable, was himself eaten by his fellow clansmen. The law of blood for\r\nblood was pitilessly enforced, and charges of witchcraft were so\r\nfrequent that whole villages were depopulated, or abandoned by their\r\nterror-stricken inhabitants. The island of Ambas in the inlet of like\r\nname remained thus for a time absolutely deserted, \"most of the\r\ninhabitants having poisoned each other off with their everlasting\r\nordeals, and the few survivors ending by dreading the very air they\r\nbreathed[286].\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus completed our survey of the Bantu populations from the\r\ncentral dividing line about the Congo-Chad water-parting round by the\r\neast, south, and west coastlands, and so back to the Sudanese zone, we\r\nmay pause to ask, What routes were followed by the Bantus themselves\r\nduring the long ages required to spread themselves over an area\r\nestimated at nearly six million square miles? I have established,\r\napparently on solid grounds, a fixed point of initial dispersion in the\r\nextreme north-east, and allusion has frequently been made to migratory\r\nmovements, some even now going on, generally from east to west, and, on\r\nthe east side of the continent, from north to south, with here an\r\nimportant but still quite recent reflux from Zululand back nearly to\r\nVictoria Nyanza. If a parallel current be postulated as setting on the\r\nAtlantic side in prehistoric times from south to north, from Hereroland\r\nto the Cameruns, or possibly the other way, we shall have nearly all the\r\nfactors needed to explain the general dispersion of the Bantu peoples\r\nover their vast domain.\r\n\r\nSupport is given to this view by the curious distribution of the two\r\nchief Bantu names of the \"Supreme Being,\" to which incidental reference\r\nhas already been made. As first pointed out I think by Dr Bleek,\r\n_(M)unkulunkulu_ with its numerous variants prevails along the eastern\r\nseaboard, _Nzambi_ along the western, and both in many parts of the\r\ninterior; while here and there the two meet, as if to indicate\r\nprehistoric interminglings of two great primeval migratory movements.\r\nFrom the subjoined table a clear idea may be had of the general\r\ndistribution:\r\n\r\n              MUNKULUNKULU                  NZAMBI\r\n\r\n          { Mpondo: Ukulukulu        | Eshi-Kongo: Nzambi   }\r\n          { Zulu: Unkulunkulu        | Kabinda: Nzambi Pongo}\r\n          { Inhambane: Mulungulu     | Lunda: Zambi         }\r\n          { Sofala: Murungu          | Ba-Teke: Nza[~m]     }\r\n          { Be-Chuana: Mulungulu     | Ba-Rotse: Nyampe     }\r\n          { Lake Moero: Mulungu      | Bihe: Nzambi         }\r\n          { Lake Tanganyika: Mulungu | Loango: Zambi, Nyambi}\r\n  Eastern { Makua: Moloko            | Bunda: Onzambi       }Western\r\n  Seaboard{ Quillimane: Mlugu        | Ba-Ngala: Nsambi     }Seaboard\r\n  and     { Lake Bangweolo: Mungu    | Ba-Kele: Nshambi     }and\r\n  Parts   { Tete, Zambesi: Muungu    | Rungu: Anyambi       }Parts\r\n  of      { Nyasaland: Murungu       | Ashira: Aniembie     }of\r\n  Interior{ Swahili: Muungu          | Mpongwe: Njambi      }Interior\r\n          { Giryama: Mulungu         | Benga: Anyambi       }\r\n          { Pokomo: Mungo            | Dwala: Nyambi        }\r\n          { Nyika: Mulungu           | Yanzi: Nyambi        }\r\n          { Kamba: Mulungu           | Herero: Ndyambi      }\r\n          { Yanzi: Molongo           |\r\n          { Herero: Mukuru           |\r\n\r\nOf _Munkulunkulu_ the primitive idea is clear enough from its best\r\npreserved form, the Zulu _Unkulunkulu_, which is a repetitive of the\r\nroot _inkulu_, great, old, hence a deification of the great departed, a\r\ndirect outcome of the ancestry-worship so universal amongst Negro and\r\nBantu peoples[287]. Thus Unkulunkulu becomes the direct progenitor of\r\nthe Zulu-Xosas: _Unkulunkulu ukobu wetu_. But the fundamental meaning of\r\n_Nzambi_ is unknown. The root does not occur in Kishi-Kongo, and Bentley\r\nrightly rejects Kolbe's far-fetched explanation from the Herero, adding\r\nthat \"the knowledge of God is most vague, scarcely more than nominal.\r\nThere is no worship paid to God[288].\"\r\n\r\nMore probable seems W. H. Tooke's suggestion that Nzambi is \"a Nature\r\nspirit like Zeus or Indra,\" and that, while the eastern Bantus are\r\nancestor-worshippers, \"the western adherents of Nzambi are more or less\r\nNature-worshippers. In this respect they appear to approach the Negroes\r\nof the Gold, Slave, and Oil Coasts[289].\" No doubt the cult of the dead\r\nprevails also in this region, but here it is combined with naturalistic\r\nforms of belief, as on the Gold Coast, where _Bobowissi_, chief god of\r\nall the southern tribes, is the \"Blower of Clouds,\" the \"Rain-maker,\"\r\nand on the Slave Coast, where the Dahoman _Mawu_ and the Yoruba _Olorun_\r\nare the Sky or Rain, and the \"Owner of the Sky\" (the deified Firmament),\r\nrespectively[290].\r\n\r\nIt would therefore seem probable that the Munkulunkulu peoples from the\r\nnorth-east gradually spread by the indicated routes over the whole of\r\nBantuland, everywhere imposing their speech, general culture, and\r\nancestor-worship on the pre-Bantu aborigines, except along the Atlantic\r\ncoastlands and in parts of the interior. Here the primitive\r\nNature-worship, embodied in Nzambi, held and still holds its ground,\r\nboth meeting on equal terms--as shown in the above table--amongst the\r\nBa-Yanzi, the Ova-Herero, and the Be-Chuanas (_Mulungulu_ generally, but\r\n_Nyampe_ in Barotseland), and no doubt in other inland regions. But the\r\nabsolute supremacy of one on the east, and of the other on the west,\r\nside of the continent, seems conclusive as to the general streams of\r\nmigration, while the amazing uniformity of nomenclature is but another\r\nillustration of the almost incredible persistence of Bantu speech\r\namongst these multitudinous illiterate populations for an incalculable\r\nperiod of time[291].\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VAALPENS AND THE STRANDLOOPERS.\r\n\r\nAmong the ethnological problems of Africa may be reckoned the _Vaalpens_\r\nand the _Strandloopers_. Along the banks of the Limpopo between the\r\nTransvaal and Southern Rhodesia there are scattered a few small groups\r\nof an extremely primitive people who are generally confounded with the\r\nBushmen, but differ in some important respects from that race. They are\r\nthe \"Earthmen\" of some writers, but their real name is _Kattea_, though\r\ncalled by their neighbours either _Ma Sarwa_ (\"Bad People\") or\r\n_Vaalpens_ (\"Grey Paunches\") from the khaki colour acquired by their\r\nbodies from creeping on all fours into their underground hovels. But the\r\ntrue colour is almost a pitch black, and as they are only about four\r\nfeet high they are quite distinct both from the tall Bantus and the\r\nyellowish Hottentot-Bushmen. For the Zulus they are mere \"dogs\" or\r\n\"vultures,\" and are certainly the most degraded of all the aborigines,\r\nbeing undoubtedly cannibals, eating their own aged and infirm like some\r\nof the Amazonian tribes. Their habitations are holes in the ground,\r\nrock-shelters, or caves, or lately a few hovels of mud and foliage at\r\nthe foot of the hills. Of their speech nothing is known except that it\r\nis absolutely distinct both from the Bantu and the Bushman. There are no\r\narts or industries of any kind, not even any weapons beyond those\r\nprocured in exchange for ostrich feathers, skins or ivory. But they can\r\nmake fire, and are thus able to cook the offal thrown to them by the\r\nBoers in return for their help in skinning the captured game. Whether\r\nthey have any religious ideas it is impossible to say, all intercourse\r\nwith the surrounding peoples being restricted to barter carried on with\r\ngesture language for nobody has ever yet mastered their tongue. A\r\n\"chief\" is spoken of, but he is merely a headman who presides over the\r\nlittle family groups of from thirty to fifty (there are no tribes\r\nproperly so called), and whose purely domestic functions are acquired,\r\nnot by heredity, but by personal worth, that is, physical strength.\r\nAltogether the Kattea is perhaps the most perfect embodiment of the pure\r\nsavage still anywhere surviving[292].\r\n\r\nWhen the Hottentots of South Africa were questioned by scientific men a\r\nhundred years ago and more regarding their traditions, they were wont to\r\nrefer to their predecessors on the coast of South Africa as a savage\r\nrace living on the seashore and subsisting on shellfish and the bodies\r\nof stranded whales. From their habits these were styled in Dutch the\r\nStrandloopers or \"Shore-runners[293].\" According to F. C. Shrubsall the\r\nStrandlooper of the Cape Colony caves preceded the Bushman in South\r\nAfrica. They were a race of short but not dwarfish men with a much\r\nhigher skull capacity than that of the average Bush race. The extreme of\r\ncranial capacity in the Strandloopers was a maximum of over 1600 c.c.,\r\nwhile the extreme minimum among the Bush people descends as low as 955\r\nc.c. The frontal region of the skull is much better developed than in\r\nthe Bush race, and in that respect is more like the Negro. There is\r\nlittle or no brow prominence and one at least of the skulls is as\r\northognathous in facial angle as that of a European. L. Peringuey\r\nremarks also that the type was less dolichocephalic than the Bushmen and\r\nHottentots, under 80 in cephalic index. \"He was artistically gifted,\r\nlike the race which occupied and decorated the Altamira ... and other\r\ncaves of Spain and France. He painted; he possibly carved on rocks; he\r\nused bone tools; he made pottery; he perforated stones for either\r\nheading clubs or to be used as make-weights for digging tools; his\r\nornaments consisted of sea-shells; and the ostrich egg-shell discs which\r\nhe made may be said to be a typical product of his industry. And this\r\nculture is retained in South Africa by a kindred race, but more\r\ndolichocephalic--the Bushmen-Hottentots. Analogous are most of his tools\r\nand his expressions of culture to those of Aurignacian man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRILLOES.\r\n\r\nThe proper domain of the African Negrilloes is the intertropical\r\nforest-land, although they appear to be at present confined to somewhat\r\nnarrow limits, between about six degrees of latitude north and south of\r\nthe equator, unless the Bushmen be included. But formerly they probably\r\nranged much farther north, and in historic times were certainly known in\r\nEgypt some 4000 or 5000 years ago. This is evident from the frequent\r\nreferences to them in the \"Book of the Dead\" as far back as the 6th\r\nDynasty. Like the dwarfs in medieval times, they were in high request at\r\nthe courts of the Pharaohs, who sent expeditions to fetch these _Danga_\r\n(_Tank_) from the \"Island of the Double,\" that is, the fabulous region\r\nof Shade Land beyond Punt, where they dwelt. The first of whom there is\r\nauthentic record was brought from this region, apparently the White\r\nNile, to King Assa (3300 B.C.) by his officer, Baurtet. Some 70 years\r\nlater Heru-Khuf, another officer, was sent by Pepi II \"to bring back a\r\npygmy alive and in good health,\" from the land of great trees away to\r\nthe south[294]. That the Danga came from the south we know from a later\r\ninscription at Karnak, and that the word meant dwarf is clear from the\r\naccompanying determinative of a short person of stunted growth.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note in this connection that the limestone statue of\r\nthe dwarf Nem-hotep, found in his tomb at Sakkara and figured by Ernest\r\nGrosse, has a thick elongated head suggesting artificial deformation,\r\nunshapely mouth, dull expression, strong full chest, and small deformed\r\nfeet, on which he seems badly balanced. It will be remembered that\r\nSchweinfurth's Akkas from Mangbattuland were also represented as\r\ntop-heavy, although the best observers, Junker and others, describe\r\nthose of the Welle and Congo forests as shapely and by no means\r\nill-proportioned.\r\n\r\nKollmann also, who has examined the remains of the Neolithic pygmies\r\nfrom the Schweizersbild Station, Switzerland, \"is quite certain that the\r\ndwarf-like proportions of the latter have nothing in common with\r\ndiseased conditions. This, from many points of view, is a highly\r\ninteresting discovery. It is possible, as Nueesch suggests, that the\r\nwidely-spread legend as to the former existence of little men, dwarfs\r\nand gnomes, who were supposed to haunt caves and retired places in the\r\nmountains, may be a reminiscence of these Neolithic pygmies[295].\"\r\n\r\nThis is what may be called the picturesque aspect of the Negrillo\r\nquestion, which it seems almost a pity to spoil by too severe a\r\ncriticism. But \"ethnologic truth\" obliges us to say that the\r\nidentification of the African Negrillo with Kollmann's European dwarfs\r\nstill lacks scientific proof. Even craniology fails us here, and\r\nalthough the Negrilloes are in great majority round-headed, R. Verneau\r\nhas shown that there may be exceptions[296], while the theory of the\r\ngeneral uniformity of the physical type has broken down at some other\r\npoints. Thus the _Dume_, south of Gallaland, discovered by Donaldson\r\nSmith[297] in the district where the _Doko_ Negrilloes had long been\r\nheard of, and even seen by Antoine d'Abbadie in 1843, were found to\r\naverage five feet, or more than one foot over the mean of the true\r\nNegrillo. D'Abbadie in fact declared that his \"Dokos\" were not pygmies\r\nat all[298], while Donaldson Smith now tells us that \"doko\" is only a\r\nterm of contempt applied by the local tribes to their \"poor relations.\"\r\n\"Their chief characteristics were a black skin, round features, woolly\r\nhair, small oval-shaped eyes, rather thick lips, high cheekbones, a\r\nbroad forehead, and very well formed bodies\" (p. 273).\r\n\r\nThe expression of the eye was canine, \"sometimes timid and\r\nsuspicious-looking, sometimes very amiable and merry, and then again\r\nchanging suddenly to a look of intense anger.\" Pygmies, he adds,\r\n\"inhabited the whole of the country north of Lakes Stephanie and Rudolf\r\nlong before any of the tribes now to be found in the neighbourhood; but\r\nthey have been gradually killed off in war, and have lost their\r\ncharacteristics by inter-marriage with people of large stature, so that\r\nonly this one little remnant, the Dume, remains to prove the existence\r\nof a pygmy race. Formerly they lived principally by hunting, and they\r\nstill kill a great many elephants with their poisoned arrows\" (pp.\r\n274-5).\r\n\r\nSome of these remarks apply also to the _Wandorobbo_, another small\r\npeople who range nearly as far north as the Dume, but are found chiefly\r\nfarther south all over Masailand, and belong, I have little doubt, to\r\nthe same connection. They are the henchmen of the Masai, whom they\r\nprovide with big game in return for divers services.\r\n\r\nThose met by W. Astor Chanler were also \"armed with bows and arrows, and\r\neach carried an elephant-spear, which they called _bonati_. This spear\r\nis six feet in length, thick at either end, and narrowed where grasped\r\nby the hand. In one end is bored a hole, into which is fitted an arrow\r\ntwo feet long, as thick as one's thumb, and with a head two inches\r\nbroad. Their method of killing elephants is to creep cautiously up to\r\nthe beast, and drive a spear into its loin. A quick twist separates the\r\nspear from the arrow, and they make off as fast and silently as\r\npossible. In all cases the arrows are poisoned; and if they are well\r\nintroduced into the animal's body, the elephant does not go far[299].\"\r\n\r\nFrom some of the peculiarities of the Achua (Wochua) Negrilloes met by\r\nJunker south of the Welle one can understand why these little people\r\nwere such favourites with the old Egyptian kings. These were\r\n\"distinguished by sharp powers of observation, amazing talent for\r\nmimicry, and a good memory. A striking proof of this was afforded by an\r\nAchua whom I had seen and measured four years previously in Rumbek, and\r\nnow again met at Gambari's. His comic ways and quick nimble movements\r\nmade this little fellow the clown of our society. He imitated with\r\nmarvellous fidelity the peculiarities of persons whom he had once seen;\r\nfor instance, the gestures and facial expressions of Jussuf Pasha\r\nesh-Shelahis and of Haj Halil at their devotions, as well as the address\r\nand movements of Emin Pasha, 'with the four eyes' (spectacles). His\r\nimitation of Hawash Effendi in a towering rage, storming and abusing\r\neverybody, was a great success; and now he took me off to the life,\r\nrehearsing after four years, down to the minutest details, and with\r\nsurprising accuracy, my anthropometric performance when measuring his\r\nbody at Rumbek[300].\"\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar account is given by Ludwig Wolf of the Ba-Twa pygmies\r\nvisited by him and Wissmann in the Kassai region. Here are whole\r\nvillages in the forest-glades inhabited by little people with an average\r\nheight of about 4 feet 3 inches. They are nomads, occupied exclusively\r\nwith hunting and the preparation of palm-wine, and are regarded by their\r\nBa-Kubu neighbours as benevolent little people, whose special mission is\r\nto provide the surrounding tribes with game and palm-wine in exchange\r\nfor manioc, maize, and bananas[301].\r\n\r\nDespite the above-mentioned deviations, occurring chiefly about the\r\nborderlands, considerable uniformity both of physical and mental\r\ncharacters is found to prevail amongst the typical Negrillo groups\r\nscattered in small hunting communities all over the Welle, Semliki,\r\nCongo, and Ogowai woodlands. Their main characters are thus described.\r\nTheir skin is of a reddish or yellowish brown in colour, sometimes very\r\ndark. Their height varies from 1.37 m. to 1.45 m. (4 ft. 4-1/4 in. to 4\r\nft. 9-1/4 in.[302]). Their hair is very short and woolly, usually of a\r\ndark rusty brown colour; the face hair is variable, but the body is\r\nusually covered with a light downy hair. The cephalic index is 79. The\r\nnose is very broad and exceptionally flattened at the root; the lips are\r\nusually thin, and the upper one long; the eyes are protuberant; the face\r\nis sometimes prognathic. Steatopygia occurs. They are a markedly\r\nintelligent people, innately musical, cunning, revengeful and suspicious\r\nin disposition, but they never steal.\r\n\r\nThey are nomadic hunters and collectors, never resorting to agriculture.\r\nThey have no domestic animals. Only meat is cooked. They wear no\r\nclothing. They use bows and poisoned arrows. Their language is unknown.\r\nThey live in small communities which centre round a cunning fighter or\r\nable hunter. Their dead are buried in the ground. They differ from\r\nsurrounding Negroes in having no veneration for the departed, no\r\namulets, no magicians or professional priests. They have charms for\r\nensuring luck in hunting, but it is uncertain whether these charms\r\nderive their potency from the supreme being, though evidence of belief\r\nin a high-god is reported from various pygmy peoples.[303]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUSHMEN AND HOTTENTOTS.\r\n\r\nTowards the south the Negrillo domain was formerly conterminous with\r\nthat of the Bushmen, of whom traces were discovered by Sir H. H.\r\nJohnston[304] as far north as Lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika, and who, it\r\nhas been conjectured, belong to the same primitive stock. The\r\ndifferences mental and physical now separating the two sections of the\r\nfamily may perhaps be explained by the different environments--hot,\r\nmoist and densely wooded in the north, and open steppes in the\r\nsouth--but until more is known of the African pygmies their affinities\r\nmust remain undecided.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the Bushmen and the Hottentots is another\r\ndisputed question. Early authorities regarded the Hottentots as the\r\nparent family, and the Bushmen as the offspring, but the researches of\r\nGustav Fritsch, E. T. Hamy, F. Shrubsall[305] and others show that the\r\nHottentots are a cross between the Bushmen--the primitive race--and the\r\nBantu, the Bushman element being seen in the leathery colour, prominent\r\ncheek-bones, pointed chin, steatopygia and other special characters.\r\n\r\nIn prehistoric times the Hottentots ranged over a vast area. Evidence\r\nhas now been produced of the presence of a belated Hottentot or\r\nHottentot-Bushman group as far north as the Kwa-Kokue district, between\r\nKilimanjaro and Victoria Nyanza. The _Wa-Sandawi_ people here visited by\r\nOskar Neumann are not Bantus, and speak a language radically distinct\r\nfrom that of the neighbouring Bantus, but full of clicks like that of\r\nthe Bushmen[306]. Two Sandawi skulls examined by Virchow[307] showed\r\ndistinct Hottentot characters, with a cranial capacity of 1250 and 1265\r\nc.c., projecting upper jaw and orthodolicho head[308]. The geographical\r\nprefix _Kwa_, common in the district (Kwa-Kokue, Kwa-Mtoro, Kwa-Hindi),\r\nis pure Hottentot, meaning \"people,\" like the postfix _qua_ (_Kwa_) of\r\nKora-_qua_, Nama-_qua_, etc. in the present Hottentot domain. The\r\ntransposition of prefixes and postfixes is a common linguistic\r\nphenomenon, as seen in the Sumero-Akkadian of Babylonia, in the\r\nNeo-Sanskritic tongues of India, and the Latin, Oscan, and other members\r\nof the Old Italic group.\r\n\r\nFarther south a widely-diffused Hottentot-Bushman geographical\r\nterminology attests the former range of this primitive race all over\r\nSouth Africa, as far north as the Zambesi. Lichtenstein had already\r\ndiscovered such traces in the Zulu country[309], and Vater points out\r\nthat \"for some districts the fact has been fully established; mountains\r\nand rivers now occupied by the Koossa [Ama-Xosa] preserve in their\r\nHottentot names the certain proof that they at one time formed a\r\npermanent possession of this people[310].\"\r\n\r\nThanks to the custom of raising heaps of stones or cairns over the\r\ngraves of renowned chiefs, the migrations of the Hottentots may be\r\nfollowed in various directions to the very heart of South Zambesia. Here\r\nthe memory of their former presence is perpetuated in the names of such\r\nwater-courses as Nos-ob, Up, Mol-opo, Hyg-ap, Gar-ib, in which the\r\nsyllables _ob_, _up_, _ap_, _ib_ and others are variants of the\r\nHottentot word _ib_, _ip_, water, river, as in _Gar-ib_, the \"Great\r\nRiver,\" now better known as the Orange River. The same indications may\r\nbe traced right across the continent to the Atlantic, where nearly all\r\nthe coast streams--even in Hereroland, where the language has long been\r\nextinct--have the same ending[311].\r\n\r\nOn the west side the Bushmen are still heard of as far north as the\r\nCunene, and in the interior beyond Lake Ngami nearly to the right bank\r\nof the Zambesi. But the Hottentots are now confined mainly to Great and\r\nLittle Namaqualand. Elsewhere there appear to be no full-blood natives\r\nof this race, the Koraquas, Gonaquas, Griquas, etc. being all\r\nHottentot-Boer or Hottentot-Bantu half-castes of Dutch speech. In Cape\r\nColony the tribal organisation ceased to exist in 1810, when the last\r\nHottentot chief was replaced by a European magistrate. Still the\r\nKoraquas keep themselves somewhat distinct about the Upper Orange and\r\nVaal Rivers, and the Griquas in Griqualand East, while the Gonaquas,\r\nthat is, \"Borderers,\" are being gradually merged in the Bantu\r\npopulations of the Eastern Provinces. There are at present scarcely\r\n180,000 south of the Orange River, and of these the great majority are\r\nhalf-breeds[312].\r\n\r\nDespite their extremely low state of culture, or, one might say, the\r\nalmost total lack of culture, the Bushmen are distinguished by two\r\nremarkable qualities, a fine sense of pictorial or graphic art[313], and\r\na rich imagination displayed in a copious oral folklore, much of which,\r\ncollected by Bleek, is preserved in manuscript form in Sir George Grey's\r\nlibrary at Cape Town[314]. The materials here stored for future use,\r\nperhaps long after the race itself has vanished for ever, comprise no\r\nless than 84 thick volumes of 3600 double-column pages, besides an\r\nunfinished Bushman dictionary with 11,000 entries. There are two great\r\nsections, (1) Myths, fables, legends and poetry, with tales about the\r\nsun and moon, the stars, the _Mantis_ and other animals, legends of\r\npeoples who dwelt in the land before the Bushmen, songs, charms, and\r\neven prayers; (2) Histories, adventures of men and animals, customs,\r\nsuperstitions, genealogies, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn the tales and myths the sun, moon, and animals speak either with\r\ntheir own proper clicks, or else use the ordinary clicks in some way\r\npeculiar to themselves. Thus Bleek tells us that the tortoise changes\r\nclicks in labials, the ichneumon in palatals, the jackal substitutes\r\nlinguo-palatals for labials, while the moon, hare, and ant-eater use\r\n\"a most unpronounceable click\" of their own. How many there may be\r\naltogether, not one of which can be properly uttered by Europeans,\r\nnobody seems to know. But grammarians have enumerated nine, indicated\r\neach by a graphic sign as under:\r\n\r\n  Cerebral     [Symbol]        Palatal          [Symbol]\r\n  Dental       [Symbol]        Lateral (Faucal) [Symbol]\r\n  Guttural     [Symbol]        Labial           [Symbol]\r\n  Spiro-dental [Symbol]        Linguo-palatal   [Symbol]\r\n                   Undefined [Symbol]\r\n\r\nFrom Bushman--a language in a state of flux, fragmentary as the small\r\ntribal or rather family groups that speak it[315]--these strange\r\ninarticulate sounds passed to the number of four into the remotely\r\nrelated Hottentot, and thence to the number of three into the wholly\r\nunconnected Zulu-Xosa. But they are heard nowhere else to my knowledge\r\nexcept amongst the newly-discovered Wa-Sandawi people of South\r\nMasailand. At the same time we know next to nothing of the Negrillo\r\ntongues, and should clicks be discovered to form an element in their\r\nphonetic system also[316], it would support the assumption of a common\r\norigin of all these dwarfish races now somewhat discredited on\r\nanatomical grounds.\r\n\r\nM. G. Bertin, to whom we are indebted for an excellent monograph on the\r\nBushman[317], rightly remarks that he is not, at least mentally, so\r\ndebased as he has been described by the early travellers and by the\r\nneighbouring Bantus and Boers, by whom he has always been despised and\r\nharried. \"His greatest love is for freedom, he acknowledges no master,\r\nand possesses no slaves. It is this love of independence which made him\r\nprefer the wandering life of a hunter to that of a peaceful\r\nagriculturist or shepherd, as the Hottentot. He rarely builds a hut, but\r\nprefers for abode the natural caves he finds in the rocks. In other\r\nlocalities he forms a kind of nest in the bush--hence his name of\r\nBushman--or digs with his nails subterranean caves, from which he has\r\nreceived the name of 'Earthman.' His garments consist only of a small\r\nskin. His weapons are still the spear, arrow and bow in their most\r\nrudimentary form. The spear is a mere branch of a tree, to which is tied\r\na piece of bone or flint; the arrow is only a reed treated in the same\r\nway. The arrow and spear-heads are always poisoned, to render mortal the\r\nslight wounds they inflict. He gathers no flocks, which would impede his\r\nmovements, and only accepts the help of dogs as wild as himself. The\r\nBushmen have, however, one implement, a rounded stone perforated in the\r\nmiddle, in which is inserted a piece of wood; with this instrument,\r\nwhich carries us back to the first age of man, they dig up a few edible\r\nroots growing wild in the desert. To produce fire, he still retains the\r\nprimitive system of rubbing two pieces of wood--another prehistoric\r\nsurvival.\"\r\n\r\nTouching their name, it is obvious that these scattered groups, without\r\nhereditary chiefs or social organisation of any kind, could have no\r\ncollective designation. The term _Khuai_, of uncertain meaning, but\r\nprobably to be equated with the Hottentot _Khoi_, \"Men,\" is the name\r\nonly of a single group, though often applied to the whole race. _Saan_,\r\ntheir Hottentot name, is the plural of Sa, a term also of uncertain\r\norigin; _Ba-roa_, current amongst the Be-Chuanas, has not been\r\nexplained, while the Zulu _Abatwa_ would seem to connect them even by\r\nname with Wolf's and Stanley's _Ba-Twa_ of the Congo forest region.\r\nOther so-called tribal names (there are no \"tribes\" in the strict sense\r\nof the word) are either nicknames imposed upon them by their\r\nneighbours, or else terms taken from the localities, as amongst the\r\nFuegians.\r\n\r\nWe may conclude with the words of W. J. Sollas: \"The more we know of\r\nthese wonderful little people the more we learn to admire and like them.\r\nTo many solid virtues--untiring energy, boundless patience, and fertile\r\ninvention, steadfast courage, devoted loyalty, and family\r\naffection--they added a native refinement of manners and a rare\r\naesthetic sense. We may learn from them how far the finer excellences of\r\nlife may be attained in the hunting stage. In their golden age, before\r\nthe coming of civilised man, they enjoyed their life to the full, glad\r\nwith the gladness of primeval creatures. The story of their later days,\r\ntheir extermination and the cruel manner of it, is a tale of horror on\r\nwhich we do not care to dwell. They haunt no more the sunlit veldt,\r\ntheir hunting is over, their nation is destroyed; but they leave behind\r\nan imperishable memory, they have immortalised themselves in their\r\nart[318].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[223] C. Meinhof holds that Proto-Bantu arose through the mixture of a\r\nSudan language with one akin to Fulah. _An Introduction to the Study of\r\nAfrican Languages_, 1915, p. 151 sqq.\r\n\r\n[224] Bantu, properly Aba-ntu, \"people.\" _Aba_ is one of the numerous\r\npersonal prefixes, each with its corresponding singular form, which are\r\nthe cause of so much confusion in Bantu nomenclature. To _aba_, _ab_,\r\n_ba_ answers a sing. _umu_, _um_, _mu_, so that sing. _umu-ntu_,\r\n_um-ntu_ or _mu-ntu_, a man, a person; plu. _aba-ntu_, _ab-ntu_, ba-ntu.\r\nBut in some groups mu is also plural, the chief dialectic variants\r\nbeing, _Ama_, _Aba_, _Ma_, _Ba_, _Wa_, _Ova_, _Va_, _Vua_, _U_, _A_,\r\n_O_, _Eshi_, as in Ama-Zulu, Mu-Sarongo, Ma-Yomba, Wa-Swahili,\r\nOva-Herero, Vua-Twa, Ba-Suto, Eshi-Kongo.

There is already an extensive literature,\r\nincluding grammars, dictionaries, translations of the Bible and other\r\nworks, and even _A History of Rome_ issued by the S.P.C.K. in 1898.\r\n\r\n[250] W. E. H. Barrett, \"Notes on the Customs and Beliefs of the\r\nWa-Giriama,\" etc., _Journ. Roy. Anthr. Inst._ XLI. 1911, gives further\r\ndetails. For a full review of the religious beliefs of Bantu tribes see\r\nE. S. Hartland, Art. \"Bantu and S. Africa,\" _Ency. of Religion and\r\nEthics_, 1909.\r\n\r\n[251] The name still survives in _Zangue-bar_ (\"Zang-land\") and the\r\nadjacent island of _Zanzibar_ (an Indian corruption). _Zang_ is \"black,\"\r\nand _bar_ is the same Arabic word, meaning dry land, that we have in\r\n_Mala-bar_ on the opposite side of the Indian Ocean. Cf. also _barran wa\r\nbahran_, \"by land and by sea.\"\r\n\r\n[252] _Viage por Malabar y Costas de Africa_, 1512, translated by the\r\nHon. Henry E. J. Stanley, Hakluyt Society, 1868.\r\n\r\n[253] In preference to the more popular form _Zulu-Kafir_, where _Kafir_\r\nis merely the Arabic \"Infidel\" applied indiscriminately to any people\r\nrejecting Islam; hence the _Siah Posh Kafirs_ (\"Black-clad Infidels\") of\r\nAfghanistan; the _Kufra_ oasis in the Sahara, where _Kufra_, plural of\r\n_Kafir_, refers to the pagan Tibus of that district; and the Kafirs\r\ngenerally of the East African seaboard. But according to English usage\r\n_Zulu_ is applied to the northern part of the territory, mainly Zululand\r\nproper and Natal, while Kafirland or Kaffraria is restricted to the\r\nsouthern section between Natal and the Great Kei River. The bulk of\r\nthese southern \"Kafirs\" belong to the Xosa connection; hence this term\r\ntakes the place of _Kafir_, in the compound expression _Zulu-Xosa_.\r\n_Ama_ is explained on p. 86, and the _X_ of _Xosa_ represents an\r\nunpronounceable combination of a guttural and a lateral click, this with\r\ntwo other clicks (a dental and a palatal) having infected the speech of\r\nthese Bantus during their long prehistoric wars with the Hottentots or\r\nBushmen. See p. 129.\r\n\r\n[254] See p. 86 above.\r\n\r\n[255] See the admirable monograph on the Ba-Thonga, by H. A. Junod, _The\r\nLife of a South African Tribe_, 1912.\r\n\r\n[256] Robert Codrington tells us that these A-Ngoni (Aba-Ngoni) spring\r\nfrom a Zulu tribe which crossed the Zambesi about 1825, and established\r\nthemselves south-east of L. Tanganyika, but later migrated to the\r\nuplands west of L. Nyasa, where they founded three petty states. Others\r\nwent east of the Livingstone range, and are here still known as\r\nMagwangwara. But all became gradually assimilated to the surrounding\r\npopulations. Intermarrying with the women of the country they preserve\r\ntheir speech, dress, and usages for the first generation in a slightly\r\nmodified form, although the language of daily intercourse is that of the\r\nmothers. Then this class becomes the aristocracy of the whole nation,\r\nwhich henceforth comprises a great part of the aborigines ruled by a\r\nprivileged caste of Zulu origin, \"perpetuated almost entirely among\r\nthemselves\" (\"Central Angoniland,\" _Geograph. Jour._ May, 1898, p. 512).\r\nSee A. Werner, _The Natives of British Central Africa_, 1906.\r\n\r\n[257] Rev. J. Macdonald, _Light in Africa_, p. 194. Among recent works\r\non the Zulu-Xosa tribes may be mentioned Dudley Kidd, _The Essential\r\nKafir_, 1904, _Savage Childhood_, 1905; H. A. Junod, _The Life of a\r\nSouth African Tribe_ (Ba-Thonga), 1912-3; G. W. Stow and G. M. Theal,\r\n_The Native Races of South Africa_, 1905.\r\n\r\n[258] From _Mwana_, lord, master, and _tapa_, to dig, both common Bantu\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n[259] The point was that Portugal had made treaties with this mythical\r\nState, in virtue of which she claimed in the \"scramble for Africa\" all\r\nthe hinterlands behind her possessions on the east and west coasts\r\n(Mozambique and Angola), in fact all South Africa between the Orange and\r\nZambesi rivers. Further details on the \"Monomotapa Question\" will be\r\nfound in my monograph on \"The Portuguese in South Africa\" in Murray's\r\n_South Africa, from Arab Domination to British Rule_, 1891, p. 11 sq.\r\nFive years later Mr G. McCall Theal also discovered, no doubt\r\nindependently, the mythical character of Monomotapaland in his book on\r\n_The Portuguese in South Africa_, 1896.\r\n\r\n[260] _Proc. R. Geogr.

XI. a reconstruction may be\r\nattempted of the obscure ethnical relations in Australasia on the\r\nfollowing broad lines.\r\n\r\n1. The two main sections of the Ulotrichous division of mankind, now\r\nseparated by the intervening waters of the Indian Ocean, are\r\nfundamentally one.\r\n\r\n2. To the Sudanese and Bantu sub-sections in Africa correspond, _mutatis\r\nmutandis_, the Papuan and Melanesian sub-sections in Oceania, the former\r\nbeing distinguished by great linguistic diversity, the latter by\r\nconsiderable linguistic uniformity, and both by a rather wide range of\r\nphysical variety within certain well-marked limits.\r\n\r\n3. In Africa the physical varieties are due mainly to Semitic and\r\nHamitic grafts on the Negro stock; in Oceania mainly to Mongoloid\r\n(Malay) and Caucasian (Indonesian) grafts on the Papuan stock.\r\n\r\n4. The Negrillo element in Africa has its counterpart in an analogous\r\nNegrito element in Oceania (Andamanese, Semangs, Aetas, etc.).\r\n\r\n5. In both regions the linguistic diversity apparently presents similar\r\nfeatures--a large number of languages differing profoundly in their\r\ngrammatical structure and vocabularies, but all belonging to the same\r\nagglutinative order of speech, and also more or less to the same\r\nphonetic system.\r\n\r\n6. In both regions the linguistic uniformity is generally confined to\r\none or two geographical areas, Bantuland in Africa and Melanesia in\r\nOceania.\r\n\r\n7. In Bantuland the linguistic system shows but faint if any\r\nresemblances to any other known tongues, whereas the Melanesian group is\r\nbut one branch, though the most archaic, of the vast Austronesian\r\nFamily, diffused over the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Papuan\r\nlanguages are entirely distinct from the Melanesian. They are in some\r\nrespects similar to the Australian, but their exact positions are not\r\nyet proved[319].\r\n\r\n8. Owing to their linguistic, geographical, and to some extent their\r\nphysical and social differences, it is desirable to treat the Papuans\r\nand Melanesians as two distinct though closely related sub-groups, and\r\nto restrict the use of the terms PAPUAN and MELANESIAN accordingly,\r\nwhile both may be conveniently comprised under the general or collective\r\nterm PAPUASIAN[320].\r\n\r\n9. Here, therefore, by _Papuans_ will be understood the true aborigines\r\nof New Guinea with its eastern Louisiade dependency[321], and in the\r\nwest many of the Malaysian islands as far as Flores inclusive, where the\r\nblack element and non-Malay speech predominate; by _Melanesians_, the\r\nnatives of Melanesia as commonly understood, that is, the Admiralty\r\nIsles, New Britain, New Ireland and Duke of York; the Solomon Islands;\r\nSanta Cruz; the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, Loyalty, and Fiji, where\r\nthe black element and Austronesian speech prevail almost exclusively.\r\nPAPUASIA will thus comprise the insular world from Flores to New\r\nCaledonia.\r\n\r\nSuch appear to be the present limits of the Papuasian domain, which\r\nformerly may have included Micronesia also (the Marianne, Pelew, and\r\nCaroline groups), and some writers suggest that it possibly extended\r\nover the whole of Polynesia as far as Easter Island.\r\n\r\nThe variation in the inhabitants of New Guinea has often been recognised\r\nand is well described by C. G. Seligman who remarks[322] that the\r\ncontrast between the relatively tall, dark-skinned, frizzly-haired\r\ninhabitants of Torres Straits, the Fly River and the neighbouring parts\r\nof New Guinea on the one hand, and the smaller lighter coloured peoples\r\nto the east, is so striking that the two peoples must be recognised as\r\nracially distinct. He restricts the name Papuan to the congeries of\r\nfrizzly-haired and often mop-headed peoples whose skin colour is some\r\nshade of brownish black, and proposes the term Papuo-Melanesian for the\r\ngenerally smaller, lighter coloured, frizzly-haired races of the eastern\r\npeninsula and the islands beyond. Besides these conspicuous differences\r\n\"The Papuan is generally taller and is more consistently dolichocephalic\r\nthan the Papuo-Melanesian: he is always darker, his usual colour being a\r\ndark chocolate or sooty brown; his head is high and his face, is, as a\r\nrule, long with prominent brow-ridges, above which his rather flat\r\nforehead commonly slopes backwards. The Papuo-Melanesian head is usually\r\nless high and the brow ridges less prominent, while the forehead is\r\ncommonly rounded and not retreating. The skin colour runs through the\r\nwhole gamut of shades of _cafe-au-lait_, from a lightish yellow with\r\nonly a tinge of brown, to a tolerably dark bronze colour. The lightest\r\nshades are everywhere uncommon, and in many localities appear to be\r\nlimited to the female sex. The Papuan nose is longer and stouter and is\r\noften so arched as to present the outline known as 'Jewish.' The\r\ncharacter of its bridge varies, typically the nostrils are broad and the\r\ntip of the nose is often hooked downwards. In the Papuo-Melanesian the\r\nnose is generally smaller: both races have frizzly hair, but while this\r\nis universal among Papuans, curly and even wavy hair is common among\r\nboth [Eastern and Western] divisions of Papuo-Melanesians[323].\"\r\n\r\nThe Melanesians are as variable as the natives of New Guinea; the hair\r\nmay be curly, or even wavy, showing evidence of racial mixture, and the\r\nskin is chocolate or occasionally copper-coloured. The stature of the\r\nmen ranges from 1.50 m. to 1.78 m. (4 ft. 11 in. to 5 ft. 10 in.), with\r\nan average between 1.56 m. and 1.6 m. (5 ft. 1-1/2 in. to 5 ft. 3 in.).\r\nThe skull is usually dolichocephalic, but ranges from 67 to 85 and in\r\ncertain parts brachycephaly is predominant; the nose shows great\r\ndiversity. This type ranges with local variations from the Admiralty\r\nIslands and parts of New Guinea through the Bismarck Archipelago,\r\nSolomon Islands, and the New Hebrides and other island groups to Fiji\r\nand New Caledonia.\r\n\r\nThe \"Kanakas,\" as the natives of New Caledonia and the Loyalty group are\r\nwrongly[324] called by their present rulers, have been described by\r\nvarious French investigators. Among the best accounts of them is that of\r\nM. Augustin Bernard[325], based on the observations of de Rochas,\r\nBourgard, Vieillard, Bertillon, Meinicke, and others. Apart from several\r\nsporadic Polynesian groups in the Loyalties[326], all are typical\r\nMelanesians, long-headed with very broad face at least in the middle,\r\nnarrow boat-shaped skull (ceph. index 70)[327], large, massive lower\r\njaw, often with two supplementary molars[328], colour a dark chocolate,\r\noften with a highly characteristic purple tinge; but de Rochas'\r\nstatement that for a few days after birth infants are of a light reddish\r\nyellow hue lacks confirmation; hair less woolly but much longer than the\r\nNegro; beard also longish and frizzly, the peppercorn tufts with\r\nsimulated bald spaces being an effect due to the assiduous use of the\r\ncomb; very prominent superciliary arches and thick eyebrows, whence\r\ntheir somewhat furtive look; mean height 5 ft. 4 in.; speech Melanesian\r\nwith three marked varieties, that of the south-eastern districts being\r\nconsidered the most rudimentary member of the whole Melanesian\r\ngroup[329].\r\n\r\nFrom the state of their industries, in some respects the rudest, in\r\nothers amongst the most advanced in Melanesia, it may be inferred that\r\nafter their arrival the New Caledonians, like the Tasmanians, the\r\nAndamanese, and some other insular groups, remained for long ages almost\r\ncompletely secluded from the rest of the world. Owing to the poverty of\r\nthe soil the struggle for food must always have been severe. Hence the\r\nmost jealously guarded privileges of the chiefs were associated with\r\nquestions of diet, while the paradise of the dead was a region where\r\nthey had abundance of food and could gorge on yams.\r\n\r\nThe ethnological history of the whole of the Melanesian region is\r\nobscure, but as the result of recent investigations certain broad\r\nfeatures may be recognised. The earliest inhabitants were probably a\r\nblack, woolly-haired race, now represented by the pygmies of New Guinea,\r\nremnants of a formerly widely extended Negrito population also surviving\r\nin the Andaman Islands, the Malay Peninsula (Semang) and the Philippines\r\n(Aeta). A taller variety advanced into Tasmania and formed the Tasmanian\r\ngroup, now extinct, others spread over New Guinea and the western\r\nPacific as \"Papuans,\" and formed the basis of the Melanesian\r\npopulations[330]. The Proto-Polynesians in their migrations from the\r\nEast Indian Archipelago to Polynesia passed through this region and\r\nimposed their speech on the population and otherwise modified it. In\r\nlater times other migrations have come from the west, and parts of\r\nMelanesia have also been directly influenced by movements from\r\nPolynesia. The result of these supposed influences has been to form the\r\nMelanesian peoples as they exist to-day[331]. G. Friederici[332] has\r\naccumulated a vast amount of evidence based chiefly on linguistics and\r\nmaterial culture, to support the theory of Melanesian cultural streams\r\nfrom the west. He regards the Melanesians as having come from that part\r\nof Indonesia which extends from the Southern Islands of the Philippine\r\ngroup, through the Minahasa peninsula of Celebes, to the Moluccas in the\r\nneighbourhood of Buru and Ceram. From the Moluccan region they passed\r\nnorth of New Guinea to the region about Vitiaz and Dampier Straits,\r\nwhich Friederici regards as the gateway of Melanesia. Here they\r\ncolonised the northern shores of New Britain, and part of the swarm\r\nsettled along the eastern and south-eastern shores of New Guinea.\r\nAnother stream passed to the Northern Louisiades, Southern Solomons, and\r\nNorthern New Hebrides. The Philippine or sub-Philippine stream took a\r\nmore northerly route, going by the Admiralty group to New Hanover, East\r\nNew Ireland and the Solomons.\r\n\r\nThe first serious attempt to disentangle the complex character of\r\nMelanesian ethnography was made by F. Graebner in 1905[333], followed by\r\nG. Friederici, the references to whose work are given above. More\r\nrecently W. H. R. Rivers[334] has attacked the cultural problem by means\r\nof the genealogical method and the results of his investigations are\r\nhere briefly summarised. He has discovered several remarkable forms of\r\nmarriage in Melanesia and has deduced others which have existed\r\npreviously. He argues that the anomalous forms of marriage imply a\r\nformer dual organisation (_i.e._ a division of the community into two\r\nexogamous groups) with matrilineal descent, and he is driven to assume\r\nthat in early times there was a state of society in which the elders had\r\nacquired so predominant a position that they were able to monopolise all\r\nthe young women. Some of the relationship systems are of great\r\nantiquity, and it is evident that changes have taken place due to\r\ncultural influences coming in from without.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of kava-drinking and betel-chewing is of great\r\ninterest. The former occurs all over Polynesia (except Easter Island and\r\nNew Zealand) and throughout southern Melanesia, including certain Santa\r\nCruz Islands, where it is limited to religious ceremonial. Betel-chewing\r\nbegins at these islands and extends northwards through New Guinea and\r\nIndonesia to India. Kava and betel were introduced into Melanesia by\r\ndifferent cultural migrations.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of betel-chewing was relatively late and restricted and\r\nmay have taken place from Indonesia after the invasion by the Hindus.\r\nWith it were associated strongly established patrilineal institutions,\r\nmarriage with a wife of a father's brother, the special sanctity of the\r\nskull and the plank-built canoe. The use of pile dwellings is a more\r\nconstant element of the betel-culture than of the kava-culture. The\r\nreligious ritual centres round the skulls of ancestors and relatives,\r\nand the cult of the skull has taken a direction which gives the heads of\r\nenemies an importance equal to that of relatives, hence head-hunting has\r\nbecome the chief object of warfare. The skull of a relative is the\r\nsymbol--if not the actual abiding place--of the dead, to be honoured and\r\npropitiated, while the skulls of enemies act as the means whereby this\r\nhonour and propitiation are effected.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the kava-using peoples was more extensive in time and\r\nspace than that of the betel-chewing people. Rivers supposes that they\r\nhad neither clan organisation nor exogamy. Some of them preserved the\r\nbody after death and respect was paid to the head or skull. It is\r\npossible that the custom of payment for a wife came into existence in\r\nMelanesia as the result of the need of the immigrant men for women of\r\nthe indigenous people owing to their bringing few women with them, and\r\nthe great development of shell money may be due in part to those\r\npayments. Contact with the earlier populations also resulted in the\r\ndevelopment of secret societies. The immigrants introduced the cult of\r\nthe dead and the institutions of taboo, totemism and chieftainship. They\r\nbrought with them the form of outrigger canoe and the knowledge of\r\nplank-building for canoes (which however was only partially adopted),\r\nthe rectangular house, and may have known the art of making pile\r\ndwellings. They introduced various forms of currency made of shells,\r\nteeth, feathers, mats, etc., the drill, the slit drum, or gong, the\r\nconch trumpet, the fowl, pig, dog, and megalithic monuments.\r\n\r\nThere may have been two immigrations of peoples who made monuments of\r\nstone: 1. Those who erected the more dolmen-like structures, probably\r\nhad aquatic totems, and interred their dead in the extended position.\r\n\r\n2. A later movement of people whose stone structures tended to take the\r\nform of pyramids, who had bird totems, practised a cult of the sun and\r\ncremated their dead.\r\n\r\nWhen the kava-using people came into Melanesia they found it already\r\ninhabited. The earliest form of social organisation of which we have\r\nevidence was on the dual basis, associated with matrilineal descent, the\r\ndominance of the old men (gerontocracy) and certain peculiar forms of\r\nmarriage. These people interred their dead in the contracted or sitting\r\nposition, which also was employed in most parts of Polynesia. Evidently\r\nthey feared the ghosts and removed their dead as completely as possible\r\nfrom the living. These people--whom we may speak of as the\r\n\"dual-people\"--were communistic in property and probably practised\r\nsexual communism; the change towards the institution of individual\r\nproperty and individual marriage were assisted by, if not entirely due\r\nto, the influence of the kava-people. They practised circumcision. Magic\r\nwas an indigenous institution. Characteristic is the cult of _vui_,\r\nunnamed local spirits with definite haunts or abiding places whose rites\r\nare performed in definite localities. In the Northern New Hebrides the\r\nofferings connected with _vui_ are not made to the _vui_ themselves but\r\nto the man who owns the place connected with the _vui_. It would seem as\r\nif ownership of a locality carried with it ownership of the _vui_\r\nconnected with the locality. Thus _vui_ are local spirits belonging to\r\nthe indigenous owners of the soil, and there seems no reason to believe\r\nthat they were ever ghosts of dead men. As totemism occurs among the\r\ndual-people of the Bismarck Archipelago (who live in parts of New\r\nBritain and New Ireland and Duke of York Island) it is possible that the\r\nkava-people were not the sole introducers of totemism into Melanesia.\r\nThe dual-people were probably acquainted with the bow, which they may\r\nhave called _busur_, and the dug-out canoe which was used either lashed\r\ntogether in pairs or singly with an outrigger.\r\n\r\nThe origin of a dual organisation is generally believed to be due to\r\nfission, but it is more reasonable to regard it as due to fusion, as\r\nhostility is so frequently manifest between the two groups despite the\r\nfact that spouses are always obtained from the other moiety. In New\r\nIreland (and elsewhere) each moiety is associated with a hero; one acts\r\nwisely but unscrupulously, the other is a fool who is always falling an\r\neasy victim to the first. Each moiety has a totem bird: one is a fisher,\r\nclever and capable, while the second obtains its food by stealing from\r\nthe other and does not go to sea. One represents the immigrants of\r\nsuperior culture who came by sea, the other the first people,\r\naborigines, of lowly culture who were quite unable to cope with the\r\nwiles and stratagems of the people who had settled among them. In the\r\nGazelle Peninsula of New Britain, the dual groups are associated with\r\nlight and dark coconuts; affiliated with the former are male objects and\r\nthe clever bird, which is universally called _taragau_, or a variant of\r\nthat term. The bird of the other moiety is named _malaba_ or\r\n_manigulai_, and is associated with female objects. The dark coconuts,\r\nthe dark colour and flattened noses of the women who were produced by\r\ntheir transformation, and the projecting eyebrows of the _malaba_ bird\r\nand its human adherents seem to be records in the mythology of the\r\nBismarck Archipelago of the negroid (or, Rivers suggests, an Australoid)\r\ncharacter of the aboriginal population. The light coconut which was\r\nchanged into a light-coloured woman seems to have preserved a tradition\r\nof the light colour of the immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe autochthones of Melanesia were a dark-skinned and ulotrichous\r\npeople, who had neither a fear of the ghosts of their dead nor a manes\r\ncult, but had a cult of local spirits. The Baining of the Gazelle\r\nPeninsula of New Britain may be representatives of a stage of Melanesian\r\nhistory earlier than the dual system; if so, they probably represent in\r\na modified form, the aboriginal element. They are said to be completely\r\ndevoid of any fear of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe immigrants whose arrival caused the institution of the dual system\r\nwere a relatively fair people of superior culture who interred their\r\ndead in a sitting position and feared their ghosts. They first\r\nintroduced the Austronesian language.\r\n\r\nAll subsequent migrations were of Austronesian-speaking peoples from\r\nIndonesia. First came the kava-peoples in various swarms, and more\r\nrecently the betel-people.\r\n\r\nPossibly New Caledonia shows the effects of relative isolation more than\r\nother parts of Melanesia, but, except for Polynesian influence (most\r\ndirectly recognisable in Fiji and southern Melanesia), Melanesia may be\r\nregarded as possessing a general culture with certain characteristic\r\nfeatures which may be thus summarised[335]. The Melanesians are a noisy,\r\nexcitable, demonstrative, affectionate, cheery, passionate people. They\r\ncould not be hunters everywhere, as in most of the islands there is no\r\ngame, nor could they be pastors anywhere, as there are no cattle; the\r\nonly resources are fishing and agriculture. In the larger islands there\r\nis usually a sharp distinction between the coast people, who are mainly\r\nfishers, and the inlanders who are agriculturalists; the latter are\r\nalways by far the more primitive, and in many cases are subservient to\r\nthe former. Both sexes work in the plantations. In parts of New Guinea\r\nand the Western Solomons the sago palm is of great importance; coconut\r\npalms grow on the shores of most islands, and bananas, yams,\r\nbread-fruit, taro and sweet potatoes supply abundant food. As for dress,\r\nthe men occasionally wear none, but usually have belts or bands, of\r\nbark-cloth, plaits, or strings, and the women almost everywhere have\r\npetticoats of finely shredded leaves. The skin is decorated with scars\r\nin various patterns, and tattooing is occasionally seen, the former\r\nbeing naturally characteristic of the darker skinned people, and the\r\nlatter of the lighter. Every portion of the body is decorated in\r\ninnumerable ways with shells, teeth, feathers, leaves, flowers, and\r\nother objects, and plaited bands encircle the neck, body, and limbs.\r\nShell necklaces, which constitute a kind of currency, and artificially\r\ndeformed boars' tusks are especially characteristic, though each group\r\nusually has its peculiar ornaments, distinguishing it from any other\r\ngroup. There is a great variety of houses. The typical Melanesian house\r\nhas a gable roof, the ridge pole is supported by two main posts, side\r\nwalls are very low, and the ends are filled in with bamboo screens. Pile\r\ndwellings are found in the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands and\r\nNew Guinea, and some New Guinea villages extend out into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe weapons typical of Melanesia are the club and the spear (though the\r\nlatter is not found in the Banks Islands), each group and often each\r\nisland possessing its own distinctive pattern. Stone headed clubs are\r\nfound in New Guinea, New Britain and the New Hebrides. The spears of the\r\nSolomon Islands are finely decorated and have bone barbs; those of New\r\nCaledonia are pointed with a sting-ray spine; those of the Admiralty\r\nIslands have obsidian heads; and those of New Britain have a human\r\narmbone at the butt end. The bow, the chief weapon of the Papuans,\r\noccurs over the greater part of Melanesia, though it is absent in S.E.\r\nNew Guinea, and is only used for hunting in the Admiralty Islands.\r\n\r\nThe hollowed out tree trunk with or without a plank gunwale is general,\r\nusually with a single outrigger, though plank-built canoes occur in the\r\nSolomons, characteristically ornamented with shell inlay. Pottery is an\r\nimportant industry in parts of New Guinea and in Fiji; it occurs also in\r\nNew Caledonia, Espiritu Santo (New Hebrides) and the Admiralty Islands.\r\nBark-cloth is made in most islands, but a loom for weaving leaf strips\r\nis now found only in Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nA division of the community into two exogamous groups is very widely\r\nspread, no intermarriage being permitted within the group. Mother-right\r\nis prevalent, descent and inheritance being counted on the mother's\r\nside, while a man's property descends to his sister's children. At the\r\nsame time the mother is in no sense the head of the family; the house is\r\nthe father's, the garden may be his, the rule and government are his,\r\nthough the maternal uncle sometimes has more authority than the father.\r\nThe transition to father-right has definitely occurred in various\r\nplaces, and is taking place elsewhere; thus, in some of the New\r\nHebrides, the father has to buy off the rights of his wife's relations\r\nor his sister's children.\r\n\r\nChiefs exist everywhere, being endowed with religious sanctity in Fiji,\r\nwhere they are regarded as the direct descendants of the tribal\r\nancestors. More often, a chief holds his position solely owing to the\r\nfact that he has inherited the cult of some powerful spirit, and his\r\ninfluence is not very extensive. Probably everywhere public affairs are\r\nregulated by discussion among the old or important men, and the more\r\nprimitive the society, the more power they possess. But the most\r\npowerful institutions of all are the secret societies, occurring with\r\ncertain exceptions throughout Melanesia. These are accessible to men\r\nonly, and the candidates on initiation have to submit to treatment which\r\nis often rough in the extreme. The members of the societies are believed\r\nto be in close association with ghosts and spirits, and exhibit\r\nthemselves in masks and elaborate dresses in which disguise they are\r\nbelieved by the uninitiated to be supernatural beings. These societies\r\ndo not practise any secret cult, in fact all that the initiate appears\r\nto learn is that the \"ghosts\" are merely his fellows in disguise, and\r\nthat the mysterious noises which herald their approach are produced by\r\nthe bull-roarer and other artificial means. These organisations are most\r\npowerful agents for the maintenance of social order and inflict\r\npunishment for breaches of customary law, but they are often terrorising\r\nand blackmailing institutions. Women are rigorously excluded.\r\n\r\nOther social factors of importance are the clubs, especially in the New\r\nHebrides and Banks Islands. These are a means of attaining social rank.\r\nThey are divided into different grades, the members of which eat\r\ntogether at their particular fire-place in the club-house. Each rank has\r\nits insignia, sometimes human effigies, usually, but wrongly, called\r\n\"idols.\" Promotion from one grade to another is chiefly a matter of\r\npayment, and few reach the highest. Those who do so become personages of\r\nvery great influence, since no candidate can obtain promotion without\r\ntheir permission.\r\n\r\nTotemism occurs in parts of New Guinea and elsewhere and has marked\r\nsocialising effects, as totemic solidarity takes precedence of all other\r\nconsiderations, but it is becoming obsolete. The most important\r\nreligious factor throughout Melanesia is the belief in a supernatural\r\npower or influence, generally called _mana_. This is what works to\r\neffect everything which is beyond the ordinary power of man or outside\r\nthe common processes of nature; but this power, though in itself\r\nimpersonal, is always connected with some person who directs it; all\r\nspirits have it, ghosts generally, and some men. A more or less\r\ndeveloped ancestor cult is also universally distributed. Human beings\r\nmay become beneficent or malevolent ghosts, but not every ghost becomes\r\nan object of regard. The ghost who is worshipped is the spirit of a man\r\nwho in his lifetime had _mana_. Good and evil spirits independent of\r\nancestors are also abundant everywhere. There is no established\r\npriesthood, except in Fiji, but as a rule, any man who knows the\r\nparticular ritual suitable to a definite spirit, acts as intermediary,\r\nand a man in communication with a powerful spirit becomes a person of\r\ngreat importance. Life after death is universally believed in, and the\r\nsoul is commonly pictured as undertaking a journey, beset with various\r\nperils, to the abode of departed spirits, which is usually represented\r\nas lying towards the west. As a rule only the souls of brave men, or\r\ninitiates, or men who have died in fight, win through to the most\r\ndesirable abode. Magical practices occur everywhere for the gaining of\r\nbenefits, plenteous crops, good fishing, fine weather, rain, children or\r\nsuccess in love. Harmful magic for producing sickness or death is\r\nequally universal[336].\r\n\r\nReturning to the Papuan lands proper, in the insular groups west of New\r\nGuinea we enter one of the most entangled ethnical regions in the world.\r\nHere are, no doubt, a few islands such as the Aru group, mainly\r\ninhabited by full-blood Papuans, men who furnished Wallace with the\r\nmodels on which he built up his true Papuan type, which has since been\r\nvainly assailed by so many later observers. But in others--Ceram, Buru,\r\nTimor, and so on to Flores--diverse ethnical and linguistic elements are\r\nintermingled in almost hopeless confusion. Discarding the term \"Alfuro\"\r\nas of no ethnical value[337], we find the whole area west to about 120 deg.\r\nE. longitude[338] occupied in varying proportions by pure and mixed\r\nrepresentatives of three distinct stocks: Negro (Papuans), Mongoloid\r\n(Malayans), and Caucasic (Indonesians). From the data supplied by\r\nCrawfurd, Wallace, Forbes, Ten Kate and other trustworthy observers, I\r\nhave constructed the subjoined table, in which the east Malaysian\r\nislands are disposed according to the constituent elements of their\r\ninhabitants[339]:\r\n\r\n_Aru Group_--True Papuans dominant; Indonesians (Korongoei) in the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\n_Kei Group_--Malayans; Indonesians; Papuan strain everywhere.\r\n\r\n_Timor; Wetta; Timor Laut_--Mixed Papuans, Malayans and Indonesians; no\r\npure type anywhere.\r\n\r\n_Serwatti Group_--Malayans with slight trace of black blood (Papuan or\r\nNegrito).\r\n\r\n_Roti and Sumba_--Malayans.\r\n\r\n_Savu_--Indonesians.\r\n\r\n_Flores; Solor; Adonera; Lomblen; Pantar; Allor_--Papuans pure or mixed\r\ndominant; Malayans in the coast towns.\r\n\r\n_Buru_--Malayans on coast; reputed Papuans, but more probably\r\nIndonesians in interior.\r\n\r\n_Ceram_--Malayans on coast; mixed Malayo-Papuans inland.\r\n\r\n_Amboina; Banda_--Malayans; Dutch-Malay half-breeds (\"Perkeniers\").\r\n\r\n_Goram_--Malayans with slight Papuan strain.\r\n\r\n_Matabello; Tior; Nuso Telo; Tionfoloka_--Papuans with Malayan\r\nadmixture.\r\n\r\n_Misol_--Malayo-Papuans on coast; Papuans inland.\r\n\r\n_Tidor; Ternate; Sulla; Makian_--Malayans.\r\n\r\n_Batjan_--Malayans; Indonesians.\r\n\r\n_Gilolo_--Mixed Papuans; Indonesians in the north.\r\n\r\n_Waigiu; Salwatti; Batanta_--Malayans on the coast; Papuans inland.\r\n\r\nFrom this apparently chaotic picture, which in some places, such as\r\nTimor, presents every gradation from the full-blood Papuan to the\r\ntypical Malay, Crawfurd concluded that the eastern section of Malaysia\r\nconstituted a region of transition between the yellowish-brown\r\nlank-haired and the dark-brown or black mop-headed stocks. In a sense\r\nthis is true, but not in the sense intended by Crawfurd, who by\r\n\"transition\" meant the actual passage by some process of development\r\nfrom type to type independently of interminglings. But such extreme\r\ntransitions have nowhere taken place spontaneously, so to say, and in\r\nany case could never have been brought about in a small zoological area\r\npresenting everywhere the same climatic conditions. Biological types may\r\nbe, and have been, modified in different environments, arctic,\r\ntemperate, or tropical zones, but not in the same zone, and if two such\r\nmarked types as the Mongol and the Negro are now found juxtaposed in the\r\nMalaysian tropical zone, the fact must be explained by migrations and\r\ndisplacements, while the intermediate forms are to be attributed to\r\nsecular intermingling of the extremes. Why should a man, passing from\r\none side to another of an island 10 or 20 miles long, be transformed\r\nfrom a sleek-haired brown to a frizzly-haired black, or from a mercurial\r\nlaughter-loving Papuan to a Malayan \"slow in movement and thoroughly\r\nphlegmatic in disposition, rarely seen to laugh or become animated in\r\nconversation, with expression generally of vague wonder or weary\r\nsadness\"[340]?\r\n\r\nWallace's classical description of these western Papuans, who are here\r\nin the very cradleland of the race, can never lose its charm, and its\r\naccuracy has been fully confirmed by all later observers. \"The typical\r\nPapuan race,\" he writes, \"is in many respects the very opposite of the\r\nMalay. The colour of the body is a deep sooty-brown or black, sometimes\r\napproaching, but never quite equalling, the jet-black of some negro\r\nraces. The hair is very peculiar, being harsh, dry, and frizzly, growing\r\nin little tufts or curls, which in youth are very short and compact, but\r\nafterwards grow out to a considerable length, forming the compact,\r\nfrizzled mop which is the Papuan's pride and glory.... The moral\r\ncharacteristics of the Papuan appear to me to separate him as distinctly\r\nfrom the Malay as do his form and features. He is impulsive and\r\ndemonstrative in speech and action. His emotions and passions express\r\nthemselves in shouts and laughter, in yells and frantic leapings.... The\r\nPapuan has a greater feeling for art than the Malay. He decorates his\r\ncanoe, his house, and almost every domestic utensil with elaborate\r\ncarving, a habit which is rarely found among tribes of the Malay race.\r\nIn the affections and moral sentiments, on the other hand, the Papuans\r\nseem very deficient. In the treatment of their children they are often\r\nviolent and cruel, whereas the Malays are almost invariably kind and\r\ngentle.\"\r\n\r\nThe ethnological parting-line between the Malayan and Papuasian races,\r\nas first laid down by Wallace, nearly coincides with his division\r\nbetween the Indo-Malayan and Austro-Malayan floras and faunas, the chief\r\ndifferences being the positions of Sumbawa and Celebes. Both of these\r\nislands are excluded from the Papuasian realm, but included in the\r\nAustro-Malayan zoological and botanical regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OCEANIC NEGRITOES.\r\n\r\nRecent discoveries and investigations of the pygmy populations on the\r\neastern border of the Indian Ocean tend to show that the problem is by\r\nno means simple. Already two main stocks are recognised, differentiated\r\nby wavy and curly hair and dolichocephaly in the Sakai, and so-called\r\nwoolly hair in the Andamanese Islanders, Semang (Malay Peninsula) and\r\nAeta (Philippines), combined with mesaticephaly or low brachycephaly. In\r\nEast Sumatra and Celebes a short, curly-haired dark-skinned people\r\noccur, racially akin to the Sakai, and Moszkowski suggests that the same\r\nelement occupied Geelvink Bay (Netherlands New Guinea). These with the\r\nVedda of Ceylon, and some jungle tribes of the Deccan, represent\r\nremnants of a once widely distributed pre-Dravidian race, which is also\r\nsupposed to form the chief element in the Australians[341].\r\n\r\nThe \"Mincopies,\" as the Andamanese used to be called, nobody seems to\r\nknow why, were visited in 1893 by Louis Lapicque, who examined a large\r\nkitchen-midden near Port Blair, but some distance from the present\r\ncoast, hence of great age[342]. Nevertheless he failed to find any\r\nworked stone implements, although flint occurs in the island. Indeed,\r\nchipped or flaked flints, now replaced by broken glass, were formerly\r\nused for shaving and scarification. But, as the present natives use only\r\nfishbones, shells, and wood, Lapicque somewhat hastily concluded that\r\nthese islanders, like some other primitive groups, have never passed\r\nthrough a Stone Age at all. The shell-mounds have certainly yielded an\r\narrow-head and polished adze \"indistinguishable from any of the European\r\nor Indian celts of the so-called Neolithic period[343].\" But there is no\r\nreason to think that the archipelago was ever occupied by a people\r\ndifferent from its present inhabitants. Hence we may suppose that their\r\nancestors arrived in their Stone Age, but afterwards ceased to make\r\nstone implements, as less handy for their purposes and more difficult to\r\nmake than the shell or bone-tipped weapons and the nets with which they\r\ncapture game and fish more readily \"than the most skilful fisherman with\r\nhook and line[344].\" Similarly they would seem to have long lost the art\r\nof making fire, having once obtained it from a still active volcano in\r\nthe neighbouring Barren Island[345].\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Andaman Islands range in colour from bronze to\r\nsooty black. Their hair is extremely frizzly, seeming to grow in spiral\r\ntufts and is seldom more than 5 inches long when untwisted. The women\r\nusually shave their heads. Their height is about 1.48 m. (4 ft. 10-1/2\r\nin.), with well-proportioned body and small hands. The cephalic index\r\naverages 82. The face is broad at the cheek-bones, the eyes are\r\nprominent, the nose is much sunken at the root but straight and small;\r\nthe lips are full but not thick, the chin is small but not retreating,\r\nnor do the jaws project. The natives are characterised by honesty,\r\nfrankness, politeness, modesty, conjugal fidelity, respect for elders\r\nand real affection between relatives and friends. The women are on an\r\nequal footing with the men and do their full share of work. The food is\r\nmainly fish (obtained by netting, spearing or shooting with bow and\r\narrow), wild yams, turtle, pig and honey. They do not till the soil or\r\nkeep domestic animals. Instead of clothing both sexes wear belts,\r\nnecklaces, leg-bands, arm-bands etc. made of bones, wood and shell, the\r\nwomen wearing in addition a rudimentary leaf apron. When fully dressed\r\nthe men wear bunches of shredded Pandanus leaf at wrists and knees, and\r\na circlet of the same leaf folded on the head. They make canoes, some of\r\nwhich have an outrigger, but never venture far from the shore. They\r\nusually live in small encampments round an oval dancing ground, their\r\nsimple huts are open in front and at the sides, or in a large communal\r\nhut in which each family has its own particular space, the bachelors and\r\nspinsters having theirs. A family consists of a man and his wife and\r\nsuch of their children, own and adopted, as have not passed the period\r\nof the ceremonies of adolescence. Between that period and marriage the\r\nboys and girls reside in the bachelors' and spinsters' quarters\r\nrespectively. A man is not regarded as an independent member of the\r\ncommunity till he is married and has a child. There is no organised\r\npolity. Generally one man excels the rest in hunting, warfare, wisdom\r\nand kindliness, and he is deferred to, and becomes, in a sense, chief. A\r\nregular feature of Andamanese social life is the meeting at intervals\r\nbetween two or more communities. A visit of a few days is paid and\r\npresents are exchanged between hosts and guests, the time being spent in\r\nhunting, feasting and dancing.\r\n\r\nNo forms of worship have been noticed, but there is a belief in various\r\nkinds of spirits, the most important of whom is Biliku, usually regarded\r\nas female, who is identified with the north-east monsoon and is paired\r\nwith Tarai the south-west monsoon. Biliku and Tarai are the producers of\r\nrain, storms, thunder and lightning. Fire was stolen from Biliku. There\r\nis always great fluidity in native beliefs, so some tribes regard Puluga\r\n(Biliku) as a male. Three things make Biliku angry and cause her to send\r\nstorms; melting or burning of bees-wax, interfering in any way with a\r\ncertain number of plants, and killing a cicada or making a noise during\r\nthe time the cicadae are singing. A. R. Brown[346] gives an interesting\r\nexplanation of this curious belief. Biliku is supposed to have a human\r\nform but nobody ever sees her. Her origin is unknown. The idea of her\r\nbeing a creator is local and is probably secondary, she does not concern\r\nherself with human actions other than those noted above.\r\n\r\nE. H. Man has carefully studied and reduced to writing the Andamanese\r\nlanguage, of which there are at least nine distinct varieties,\r\ncorresponding to as many tribal groups. It has no clear affinities to\r\nany other tongue[347], the supposed resemblances to Dravidian and\r\nAustralian being extremely slight, if not visionary. Its phonetic system\r\nis astonishingly rich (no less than 24 vowels and 17 consonants, but no\r\nsibilants), while the arithmetic stops at _two_. Nobody ever attempts to\r\ncount in any way beyond _ten_, which is reached by a singular process.\r\nFirst the nose is tapped with the finger-tips of either hand, beginning\r\nwith the little finger, and saying _ubatul_ (one), then _ikpor_ (two)\r\nwith the next, after which each successive tap makes _anka_, \"and this.\"\r\nWhen the thumb of the second hand is reached, making _ten_, both hands\r\nare brought together to indicate 5 + 5, and the sum is clenched with the\r\nword _arduru_ = \"all.\" But this feat is exceptional, and usually after\r\n_two_ you get only words answering to several, many, numerous,\r\ncountless, which flight of imagination is reached at about 6 or 7.\r\n\r\nYet with their infantile arithmetic these paradoxical islanders have\r\ncontrived to develop an astonishingly intricate form of speech\r\ncharacterised by an absolutely bewildering superfluity of pronominal and\r\nother elements. Thus the possessive pronouns have as many as sixteen\r\npossible variants according to the class of noun (human objects, parts\r\nof the body, degrees of kinship, etc.) with which they are in agreement.\r\nFor instance, _my_ is _dia_, _dot_, _dong_, _dig_, _dab_, _dar_, _daka_,\r\n_doto_, _dai_, _dar_, _ad_, _ad-en_, _deb_, with _man_, _head_, _wrist_,\r\n_mouth_, _father_, _son_, _step-son_, _wife_, etc. etc.; and so with\r\n_thy_, _his_, _our_, _your_, _their_! This grouping of nouns in classes\r\nis analogous to the Bantu system, and it is curious to note that the\r\nnumber of classes is about the same. On the other hand there is a wealth\r\nof postfixes attached as in normal agglutinating forms of speech, so\r\nthat \"in adding their affixes they follow the principles of the ordinary\r\nagglutinative tongues; in adding their prefixes they follow the\r\nwell-defined principles of the South African tongues. Hitherto, as far\r\nas I know, the two principles in full play have never been found\r\ntogether in any other language.... In Andamanese both are fully\r\ndeveloped, so much so as to interfere with each other's grammatical\r\nfunctions[348].\" The result often is certain _sesquipedalia verba_\r\ncomparable in length to those of the American polysynthetic languages. A\r\nsavage people, who can hardly count beyond two, possessed of about the\r\nmost intricate language spoken by man, is a psychological puzzle which I\r\ncannot profess to fathom.\r\n\r\nIn the Malay Peninsula the indigenous element is certainly the Negrito,\r\nwho, known by many names--Semang, Udai, Pangan, Hami, Menik or\r\nMandi--forms a single ethnical group presenting some striking analogies\r\nwith the Andamanese. But, surrounded from time out of mind by Malay\r\npeoples, some semi-civilised, some nearly as wild as themselves, but all\r\nalike slowly crowding them out of the land, these aborigines have\r\ndeveloped defensive qualities unneeded by the more favoured insular\r\nNegritoes, while their natural development has been arrested at perhaps\r\na somewhat lower plane of culture. In fact, doomed to extinction before\r\ntheir time came, they never have had a chance in the race, as Hugh\r\nClifford sings in _The Song of the Last Semangs_:\r\n\r\n  The paths are rough, the trails are blind\r\n    The Jungle People tread;\r\n  The yams are scarce and hard to find\r\n    With which our folk are fed.\r\n\r\n  We suffer yet a little space\r\n    Until we pass away,\r\n  The relics of an ancient race\r\n    That ne'er has had its day.\r\n\r\nIn physical features they in many respects resemble the Andamanese.\r\nTheir hair is short, universally woolly and black, the skin colour dark\r\nchocolate brown approximating to glossy black[349], sometimes with a\r\nreddish tinge[350]. There is very little evidence for the stature but\r\nthe 17 males measured by Annandale and Robinson[351] averaged 1.52 m. (5\r\nft. 0-1/4 in.). The average cephalic index is about 78 to 79, extremes\r\nranging from 74 to 84. The face is round, the forehead rounded, narrow\r\nand projecting, or as it were \"swollen.\" The nose is short and\r\nflattened, with remarkable breadth and distended nostrils. The nasal\r\nindex of five adult males was 101.2[352]. The cheekbones are broad and\r\nthe jaws often protrude slightly; the lips are as a rule thick. Martin\r\nremarks that characteristic both of Semang and Sakai[353] is the great\r\nthickening of the integumental part of the upper lip, the whole mouth\r\nregion projecting from the lower edge of the nose. This convexity occurs\r\nin 79 per cent., and is well shown in his photographs[354].\r\n\r\nHugh Clifford, who has been intimately associated with the \"Orang-utan\"\r\n(Wild-men) as the Malays often call them, describes those of the Plus\r\nRiver valley as \"like African Negroes seen through the reverse end of a\r\nfield-glass. They are sooty-black in colour; their hair is short and\r\nwoolly, clinging to the scalp in little crisp curls; their noses are\r\nflat, their lips protrude, and their features are those of the pure\r\nnegroid type. They are sturdily built and well set upon their legs, but\r\nin stature little better than dwarfs. They live by hunting, and have no\r\npermanent dwellings, camping in little family groups wherever, for the\r\nmoment, game is most plentiful[355].\"\r\n\r\nTheir shelters--huts they cannot be called--are exactly like the\r\nfrailest of the Andamanese, mere lean-to's of matted palm-leaves crazily\r\npropped on rough uprights; clothes they have next to none, and their\r\nfood is chiefly yams and other jungle roots, fish from the stream, and\r\nsun-dried monkey, venison and other game, this term having an elastic\r\nmeaning. Salt, being rarely obtainable, is a great luxury, as amongst\r\nalmost all wild tribes. They are a nomadic people living by collecting\r\nand hunting; the wilder ones will often not remain longer than three\r\ndays in one place. Very few have taken to agriculture. They make use of\r\nbamboo rafts for drifting down stream but have no canoes. All men are on\r\nan equal footing, but each tribe has a head, who exercises authority.\r\nDivision of labour is fairly even between men and women. The men hunt,\r\nand the women build the shelters and cook the food. They are strictly\r\nmonogamous and faithful.\r\n\r\nAll the faculties are sharpened mainly in the quest of food and of means\r\nto elude the enemy now closing round their farthest retreats in the\r\nupland forests. When hard pressed and escape seems impossible, they will\r\nclimb trees and stretch rattan ropes from branch to branch where these\r\nare too wide apart to be reached at a bound, and along such frail aerial\r\nbridges women and all will pass with their cooking-pots and other\r\neffects, with their babies also at the breast, and the little ones\r\nclinging to their mother's heels. For like the Andamanese they love\r\ntheir women-folk and children, and in this way rescue them from the\r\nMalay raiders and slavers. But unless the British raj soon intervenes\r\ntheir fate is sealed. They may slip from the Malays, but not from their\r\nown traitorous kinsmen, who often lead the hunt, and squat all night\r\nlong on the tree tops, calling one to another and signalling from these\r\nlook-outs when the leaves rustle and the rattans are heaved across, so\r\nthat nothing can be done, and another family group is swept away into\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nFrom their physical resemblance, undoubted common descent, and\r\ngeographical proximity, one might also expect to find some affinity in\r\nthe speech of the Andaman and Malay Negritoes. But H. Clifford, who made\r\na special study of the dialects on the mainland, discovered no points of\r\ncontact between them and any other linguistic group[356]. This, however,\r\nneed cause no surprise, being in no discordance with recognised\r\nprinciples. As in the Andamans, stone implements have been found in the\r\nPeninsula, and specimens are now in the Pitt-Rivers collection at\r\nOxford[357]. But the present aborigines do not make or use such tools,\r\nand there is good reason for thinking that they were the work of their\r\nancestors, arriving, as in the Andamans, in the remote past. Hence the\r\ntwo groups have been separated for many thousands of years, and their\r\nspeech has diverged too widely to be now traced back to a common\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nWith the Negritoes of the Philippines we enter a region of almost\r\nhopeless ethnical complications[358], amid which, however, the dark\r\ndwarfish _Aeta_ peoples crop out almost everywhere as the indigenous\r\nelement. The Aeta live in the mountainous districts of the larger\r\nislands, and in some of the smaller islands of the Philippines, and the\r\nname is conveniently extended to the various groups of Philippine\r\nNegritoes, many of whom show the results of mixture with other peoples.\r\nTheir hair is universally woolly, usually of a dirty black colour, often\r\nsun-burnt on the top to a reddish brown. The skin is dark chocolate\r\nbrown rather than black, sometimes with a yellowish tinge. The average\r\nstature of 48 men was 1.46 m. (4 ft. 9 in.), but showed considerable\r\nrange. The typical nose is broad, flat, and bridgeless, with prominent\r\narched nostrils, the average nasal index for males being 102, and for\r\nfemales 105[359]. The lips are thick, but not protruding, sometimes\r\nshowing a pronounced convexity between the upper lip and the nose.\r\n\r\nJohn Foreman[360] noted the curious fact that the Aeta were recognised\r\nas the owners of the soil long after the arrival of the Malayan\r\nintruders.\r\n\r\n\"For a long time they were the sole masters of Luzon Island, where they\r\nexercised seignorial rights over the Tagalogs and other immigrants,\r\nuntil these arrived in such numbers, that the Negritoes were forced to\r\nthe highlands.\r\n\r\n\"The taxes imposed upon the primitive Malay settlers by the Negritoes\r\nwere levied in kind, and, when payment was refused, they swooped down in\r\na posse, and carried off the head of the defaulter. Since the arrival of\r\nthe Spaniards terror of the white man has made them take definitely to\r\nthe mountains, where they appear to be very gradually decreasing[361].\"\r\n\r\nAt first sight it may seem unaccountable that a race of such extremely\r\nlow intellect should be able to assert their supremacy in this way over\r\nthe intruding Malayans, assumed to be so much their superiors in\r\nphysical and mental qualities. But it has to be considered that the\r\ninvasions took place in very remote times, ages before the appearance on\r\nthe scene of the semi-civilised Muhammadan Malays of history. Whether of\r\nIndonesian or of what is called \"Malay\" stock, the intruders were rude\r\nOceanic peoples, who in the prehistoric period, prior to the spread of\r\ncivilising Hindu or Moslem influences in Malaysia, had scarcely advanced\r\nin general culture much beyond the indigenous Papuan and Negrito\r\npopulations of that region. Even at present the Gaddanes, Itaves,\r\nIgorrotes, and others of Luzon are mere savages, at the head-hunting\r\nstage, quite as wild as, and perhaps even more ferocious than any of the\r\nAetas. Indeed we are told that in some districts the Negrito and\r\nIgorrote tribes keep a regular Debtor and Creditor account of heads.\r\nWherever the vendetta still prevails, all alike live in a chronic state\r\nof tribal warfare; periodical head-hunting expeditions are organised by\r\nthe young men, to present the bride's father with as many grim trophies\r\nas possible in proof of their prowess, the victims being usually taken\r\nby surprise and stricken down with barbarous weapons, such as a long\r\nspear with tridented tips, or darts and arrows carrying at the point two\r\nrows of teeth made of flint or sea-shells. To avoid these attacks some,\r\nlike the Central Sudanese Negroes, live in cabins on high posts or trees\r\n60 to 70 feet from the ground, and defend themselves by showering stones\r\non the marauders.\r\n\r\nA physical peculiarity of the full-blood Negritoes, noticed by J.\r\nMontano[362], is the large, clumsy foot, turned slightly inwards, a\r\ntrait characteristic also of the African Negrilloes; but in the Aeta the\r\neffect is exaggerated by the abnormal divergence of the great toe, as\r\namongst the Annamese.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a pygmy element in the population of New Guinea had long\r\nbeen suspected, but the actual existence of a pygmy people was first\r\ndiscovered by the British Ornithologists' Union Expedition, 1910, at the\r\nsource of the Mimika river in the Nassau range[363].\r\n\r\nThe description of these people, the Tapiro, is as follows. Their\r\nstature averages 1.449 m. (4 ft. 9 in.) ranging from 1.326 m. (4 ft.\r\n4-1/2 in.) to 1.529 (5 ft. 0-1/4 in.). The skull is very variable giving\r\nindices from 66.9 to 85.1. The skin colour is lighter than that of the\r\nneighbouring Papuans, some individuals being almost yellow. The nose is\r\nstraight, and though described as \"very wide at the nostrils,\" the mean\r\nof the indices is only 83, the extremes being 65.5 and 94. The eyes are\r\nnoticeably larger and rounder than those of Papuans, and the upper lip\r\nof many of the men is long and curiously convex. A Negrito element has\r\nalso been recognised in the Mafulu people investigated by R. W.\r\nWilliamson in the Mekeo District[364], here mixed with Papuan and\r\nPapuo-Melanesian. Their stature ranges from 1.47 m. (4 ft. 10 in.) to\r\n1.63 m. (5 ft. 4 in.). The average cephalic index is 80 ranging from\r\n74.7 to 86.8. The skin colour is dark sooty brown and the hair, though\r\nusually brown or black, is often very much lighter, \"not what we in\r\nEurope should call dark.\" The average nasal index is 84 with extremes of\r\n71.4 and 100. Also partly of Negrito origin are the P[)e]s[)e]g[)e]m of\r\nthe upper waters of the Lorentz river[365].\r\n\r\nAll these Negrito peoples, as has been pointed out, show considerable\r\ndiversity in physical characters, none of the existing groups, with the\r\nexception of the Andamanese, appearing to be homogeneous as regards\r\ncephalic or nasal index, while the stature, though always low, shows\r\nconsiderable range. They have certain cultural features in common[366],\r\nand these as a rule differentiate them from their neighbours. They\r\nseldom practise any deformation of the person, such as tattooing or\r\nscarification, though the Tapiro and Mafulu wear a nose-stick. They are\r\ninvariably collectors and hunters, never, unless modified by contact\r\nwith other peoples, undertaking any cultivation of the soil. Their huts\r\nare simple, the pile dwellings of the Tapiro being evidently copied from\r\ntheir neighbours. All possess the bow and arrow, though only the Semang\r\nand Aeta use poison. The Andamanese appear to be one of the very few\r\npeoples who possess fire but do not know how to make it afresh. There\r\nseems a certain amount of evidence that the Negrito method of making\r\nfire was that of splitting a dry stick, keeping the ends open by a piece\r\nof wood or stone placed in the cleft, stuffing some tinder into the\r\nnarrow part of the slit and then drawing a strip of rattan to and fro\r\nacross the spot until a spark sets fire to the tinder[367]. The social\r\nstructure is everywhere very simple. The social unit appears to be the\r\nfamily and the power of the headman is very limited. Strict monogamy\r\nseems to prevail even where, as among the Aeta, polygyny is not\r\nprohibited. The dead are buried, but the bodies of those whom it is\r\nwished to honour are placed on platforms or on trees.\r\n\r\nRelated in certain physical characters to the pygmy Negritoes, although\r\nnot of pygmy proportions[368], were the aborigines of Tasmania, but\r\ntheir racial affinities are much disputed. Huxley thought they showed\r\nsome resemblance to the inhabitants of New Caledonia and the Andaman\r\nIslands, but Flower was disposed to bring them into closer connection\r\nwith the Papuans or Melanesians. The leading anthropologists in France\r\ndo not accept either of these views. Topinard states that there is no\r\nclose alliance between the New Caledonians and the Tasmanians, while\r\nQuatrefages and Hamy remark that \"from whatever point of view we look at\r\nit, the Tasmanian race presents special characters, so that it is quite\r\nimpossible to discover any well-defined affinities with any other\r\nexisting race.\" Sollas, reviewing these conflicting opinions, concludes\r\nthat \"this probably represents the prevailing opinion of the present\r\nday[369].\"\r\n\r\nThe Tasmanians were of medium height, the average for the men being\r\n1.661 m. (5 ft. 5-1/2 in.) with a range from 1.548 m. to 1.732 m. (5 ft.\r\n1 in. to 5 ft. 8 in.); the average height for women being 1.503 m. (4\r\nft. 11 in.) with a range from 1.295 m. to 1.630 m. (4 ft. 3 in. to 5 ft.\r\n4-1/4 in.). The skin colour was almost black with a brown tinge. The\r\neyes were small and deep set beneath prominent overhanging brow-ridges.\r\nThe nose was short and broad, with a deep notch at the root and widely\r\ndistended nostrils. The skull was dolichocephalic or low mesaticephalic,\r\nwith an average index of 75, of peculiar outline when viewed from above.\r\nOther peculiarities were the possession of the largest teeth, especially\r\nnoticeable in comparison with the small jaw, and the smallest known\r\ncranial capacity (averaging 1199 c.c. for both sexes, falling in the\r\nwomen to 1093 c.c.).\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal Tasmanians stood even at a lower level of culture than\r\nthe Australians. At the occupation the scattered bands, with no\r\nhereditary chiefs or social organisation, numbered altogether 2000 souls\r\nat most, speaking several distinct dialects, whether of one or more\r\nstock languages is uncertain. In the absence of sibilants and some other\r\nfeatures they resembled the Australian, but were of ruder or less\r\ndeveloped structure, and so imperfect that according to Joseph Milligan,\r\nour best authority on the subject, \"they observed no settled order or\r\narrangement of words in the construction of their sentences, but\r\nconveyed in a supplementary fashion by tone, manner, and gesture those\r\nmodifications of meaning which we express by mood, tense, number,\r\netc.[370]\" Abstract terms were rare, and for every variety of gum-tree\r\nor wattle-tree there was a name, but no word for \"tree\" in general, or\r\nfor qualities, such as hard, soft, warm, cold, long, short, round, etc.\r\nAnything hard was \"like a stone,\" round \"like the moon,\" and so on,\r\n\"usually suiting the action to the word, and confirming by some sign the\r\nmeaning to be understood.\"\r\n\r\nThey made fire by the stick and groove method, but their acquaintance\r\nwith the fire-drill is uncertain[371]. The stone implements are the\r\nsubject of much discussion. A great number are so rude and uncouth that,\r\ntaken alone, we should have little reason to suspect that they had been\r\nchipped by man: some, on the other hand, show signs of skilful working.\r\nThey were formerly classed as \"eoliths\" and compared to the plateau\r\nimplements of Kent and Sussex, but the comparison cannot be\r\nsustained[372]. Sollas illustrates an implement \"delusively similar to\r\nthe head of an axe\" and notes its resemblance to a Levallois flake\r\n(Acheulean). J. P. Johnson[373] points out the general likeness to\r\npre-Aurignacian forms and there is a remarkable similarity of certain\r\nexamples to Mousterian types. Weapons were of wood, and consisted of\r\nspears pointed and hardened in the fire, and a club or waddy, about two\r\nfeet long, sometimes knobbed at one end; the range is said to have been\r\nabout 40 yards.\r\n\r\nIn the native diet were included \"snakes, lizards, grubs and worms,\"\r\nbesides the opossum, wombat, kangaroo, birds and fishes, roots, seeds\r\nand fruits, but not human flesh, at least normally. Like the Bushmen,\r\nthey were gross feeders, consuming enormous quantities of food when they\r\ncould get it, and the case is mentioned of a woman who was seen to eat\r\nfrom 50 to 60 eggs of the sooty petrel (larger than a duck's), besides a\r\ndouble allowance of bread, at the station on Flinders Island. They had\r\nfrail bundles of bark made fast with thongs or rushes, half float, half\r\nboat, to serve as canoes, but no permanent abodes or huts, beyond\r\nbranches of trees lashed together, supported by stakes, and disposed\r\ncrescent-shape with the convex side to windward. On the uplands and\r\nalong the sea-shore they took refuge in caves, rock-shelters and natural\r\nhollows. Usually the men went naked, the women wore a loose covering of\r\nskins, and personal ornamentation was limited to cosmetics of red ochre,\r\nplumbago, and powdered charcoal, with occasionally a necklace of shells\r\nstrung on a fibrous twine.\r\n\r\nBeing merely hunters and collectors, with the arrival of English\r\ncolonists their doom was sealed. \"Only in rare instances can a race of\r\nhunters contrive to co-exist with an agricultural people. When the\r\nhunting ground of a tribe is restricted owing to its partial occupation\r\nby the new arrivals, the tribe affected is compelled to infringe on the\r\nboundaries of its neighbours: this is to break the most sacred 'law of\r\nthe Jungle,' and inevitably leads to war: the pressure on one boundary\r\nis propagated to the next, the ancient state of equilibrium is\r\nprofoundly disturbed, and inter-tribal feuds become increasingly\r\nfrequent. A bitter feeling is naturally aroused against the original\r\noffenders, the alien colonists; misunderstandings of all kinds\r\ninevitably arise, leading too often to bloodshed, and ending in a\r\ngeneral conflict between natives and colonists, in which the former,\r\nalready weakened by disagreements among themselves, must soon succumb.\r\nSo it was in Tasmania.\" After the war of 1825 to 1831 the few wretched\r\nsurvivors, numbering about 200, were gathered together into a\r\nsettlement, and from 1834 onwards every effort was made for their\r\nwelfare, \"but 'the white man's civilisation proved scarcely less fatal\r\nthan the white man's bullet,' and in 1877, with the death of Truganini,\r\nthe last survivor, the race became extinct[374].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[319] Cf.

But this observer found the characters so variable in\r\nNew Guinea that he was unable to use it as a racial test. In the New\r\nHebrides, Louisiades, and Bismarck group also he found many of the\r\nnatives to be broad-headed, with indices as high as 80 and 85; and even\r\nin the Solomon Islands Guppy records cephalic indices ranging from 69 to\r\n86, but dolichocephaly predominates (_The Solomon Islands_, 1887, pp.\r\n112, 114).

These two, that is, the main and secondary branch, which\r\njointly occupy the greater part of south-east Asia with most of\r\nMalaysia, Madagascar, the Philippines and Formosa, will form the subject\r\nof the present and following chapters. Allowing for encroachments and\r\noverlappings, especially in Manchuria and North Tibet, the northern\r\n\"divide\" towards the Mongolo-Tatar domain is roughly indicated by the\r\nGreat Wall and the Kuen-lun range westwards to the Hindu-Kush, and\r\ntowards the south-west by the Himalayas from the Hindu-Kush eastwards to\r\nAssam. The Continental section thus comprises the whole of China proper\r\nand Indo-China, together with a great part of Tibet with Little Tibet\r\n(Baltistan and Ladakh), and the Himalayan uplands including their\r\nsouthern slopes. This section is again separated from the Oceanic\r\nsection by the Isthmus of Kra--the Malay Peninsula belonging ethnically\r\nto the insular Malay world. \"I believe,\" writes Warington Smyth, \"that\r\nthe Malay never really extended further south than the Kra\r\nisthmus[376].\"\r\n\r\nFrom the considerations advanced in _Ethnology_, Chap. XII., it seems a\r\nreasonable assumption that the lacustrine Tibetan tableland with its\r\nHimalayan escarpments, all standing in pleistocene times at a\r\nconsiderably lower level than at present, was the cradle of the Mongol\r\ndivision of mankind. Here were found all the natural conditions\r\nfavourable to the development of a new variety of the species moving\r\nfrom the tropics northwards--ample space such as all areas of marked\r\nspecialisation seem to require; a different and cooler climate than that\r\nof the equatorial region, though, thanks to its then lower elevation,\r\nwarmer than that of the bleak and now barely inhabitable Tibetan\r\nplateau; extensive plains, nowhere perhaps too densely wooded,\r\nintersected by ridges of moderate height, and diversified by a\r\nlacustrine system far more extensive than that revealed by the\r\nexploration of modern travellers[377].\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, which are not matter of mere speculation, but\r\nto be directly inferred from the observations of intelligent explorers\r\nand of trained Anglo-Indian surveyors, it would seem not only probable\r\nbut inevitable that the pleistocene Indo-Malayan should become modified\r\nand improved in his new and more favourable Central Asiatic environment.\r\n\r\nLater, with the gradual upheaval of the land to a mean altitude of some\r\n14,000 feet above sea-level, the climate deteriorated, and the present\r\nsomewhat rude and rugged inhabitants of Tibet are to be regarded as the\r\noutcome of slow adaptation to their slowly changing surroundings since\r\nthe occupation of the country by the Indo-Malayan pleistocene precursor.\r\nTo this precursor Tibet was accessible either from India or from\r\nIndo-China, and although few of his implements have yet been reported\r\nfrom the plateau, it is certain that Tibet has passed through the Stone\r\nas well as the Metal Ages. In Bogle's time \"thunder-stones\" were still\r\nused for tonsuring the lamas, and even now stone cooking-pots are found\r\namongst the shepherds of the uplands, although they are acquainted both\r\nwith copper and iron. In India also and Indo-China palaeoliths of rude\r\ntype occur at various points--Arcot, the Narbada gravels, Mirzapur[378],\r\nthe Irawadi valley and the Shan territory--as if to indicate the routes\r\nfollowed by early man in his migrations from Indo-Malaysia northwards.\r\n\r\nThus, where man is silent the stones speak, and so old are these links\r\nof past and present that amongst the Shans, as in ancient Greece, their\r\norigin being entirely forgotten, they are often mounted as jewellery and\r\nworn as charms against mishaps.\r\n\r\nUsually the Mongols proper, that is, the steppe nomads who have more\r\nthan once overrun half the eastern hemisphere, are taken as the typical\r\nand original stem of the Mongolian stock. But if Ch. de Ujfalvy's views\r\ncan be accepted this honour will now have to be transferred to the\r\nTibetans, who still occupy the supposed cradle of the race. This veteran\r\nstudent of the Central Asiatic peoples describes two Mongol types, a\r\nnorthern round-headed and a southern long-headed, and thinks that the\r\nlatter, which includes \"the Ladakhi, the Champas and Tibetans proper,\"\r\nwas \"the primitive Mongol type[379].\"\r\n\r\nOwing to the political seclusion of Tibet, the race has hitherto been\r\nstudied chiefly in outlying provinces beyond the frontiers, such as\r\nLadakh, Baltistan, and Sikkim[380], that is, in districts where mixture\r\nwith other races may be suspected. Indeed de Ujfalvy, who has made a\r\ncareful survey of Baltistan and Ladakh, assures us that, while the\r\nLadakhi represent two varieties of Asiatic man with ceph. index 77, the\r\nBalti are not Tibetans or Mongols at all, but descendants of the\r\nhistorical Sacae, although now of Tibetan speech and Moslem faith[381].\r\nThey are of the mean height or slightly above it, with rather low brow,\r\nvery prominent superciliary arches, deep depression at nasal root, thick\r\ncurved eyebrows, long, straight or arched nose, thick lips, oval chin,\r\nsmall cheek-bones, small flat ears, straight eyes, very black and\r\nabundant ringletty (_boucle_) hair, full beard, usually black and silky,\r\nrobust hairy body, small hands and feet, and long head (index 72). In\r\nsuch characters it is impossible to recognise the Mongol, and the\r\ncontrast is most striking with the neighbouring Ladakhi, true Mongols,\r\nas shown by their slightly raised superciliary arches, square and\r\nscarcely curved eyebrows, slant eyes, large prominent cheek-bones, lank\r\nand coarse hair, yellowish and nearly hairless body.\r\n\r\nDoubtless there has been a considerable intermingling of Balti and\r\nLadakhi, and in recent times still more of Balti and Dards (Hindu-Kush\r\n\"Aryans\"), whence Leitner's view that the Balti are Dards at a remote\r\nperiod conquered by the Bhots (Tibetans), losing their speech with their\r\nindependence. But of all these peoples the Balti were in former times\r\nthe most civilised, as shown by the remarkable rock-carvings still found\r\nin the country, and attributed by the present inhabitants to a long\r\nvanished race. Some of these carvings represent warriors mounted and on\r\nfoot, the resemblance being often very striking between them and the\r\npersons figured on the coins of the Sacae kings both in their physical\r\nappearance, attitudes, arms, and accoutrements. The Balti are still\r\nfamous horsemen, and with them is said to have originated the game of\r\npolo, which has thence spread to the surrounding peoples as far as\r\nChitral and Irania.\r\n\r\nFrom all these considerations it is inferred that the Balti are the\r\ndirect descendants of the Sacae, who invaded India about 90 B.C., not\r\nfrom the west (the Kabul valley) as generally stated, but from the north\r\nover the Karakorum Passes leading directly to Baltistan[382]. Thus lives\r\nagain a name renowned in antiquity, and another of those links is\r\nestablished between the past and the present, which it is the province\r\nof the historical ethnologist to rescue from oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn Tibet proper the ethnical relations have been confused by the loose\r\nway tribal and even national names are referred to by Prjevalsky and\r\nsome other modern explorers. It should therefore be explained that three\r\nsomewhat distinct branches of the race have to be carefully\r\ndistinguished: 1. The _Bod-pa_[383], \"Bodmen,\" the settled and more or\r\nless civilised section, who occupy most of the southern and more fertile\r\nprovinces of which Lhasa is the capital, who till the land, live in\r\ntowns, and have passed from the tribal to the civic state. 2. The\r\n_Dru-pa_[384], peaceful though semi-nomadic pastoral tribes, who live in\r\ntents on the northern plateaux, over 15,000 feet above sea-level. 3. The\r\n_Tanguts_[385], restless, predatory tribes, who hover about the\r\nnorth-eastern borderland between Koko-nor and Kansu.\r\n\r\nAll these are true Tibetans, speak the Tibetan language, and profess one\r\nor other of the two national religions, _Bonbo_ and Lamaism (the Tibetan\r\nform of Buddhism). But the original type is best preserved, not amongst\r\nthe cultured Bod-pa, who in many places betray a considerable admixture\r\nboth of Chinese and Hindu elements, but amongst the Dru-pa, who on their\r\nbleak upland steppes have for ages had little contact with the\r\nsurrounding Mongolo-Turki populations. They are described by W. W.\r\nRockhill from personal observation as about five feet five inches high,\r\nand round-headed, with wavy hair, clear-brown and even hazel eye,\r\ncheek-bone less high than the Mongol, thick nose, depressed at the root,\r\nbut also prominent and even aquiline and narrow but with broad nostrils,\r\nlarge-lobed ears standing out to a less degree than the Mongol, broad\r\nmouth, long black hair, thin beard, generally hairless body, broad\r\nshoulders, very small calves, large foot, coarse hand, skin coarse and\r\ngreasy and of light brown colour, though \"frequently nearly white, but\r\nwhen exposed to the weather a dark brown, nearly the colour of our\r\nAmerican Indians. Rosy cheeks are quite common amongst the younger\r\nwomen[386].\"\r\n\r\nSome of these characters--wavy hair, aquiline nose, hazel eye, rosy\r\ncheeks--are not Mongolic, and despite W. W. Rockhill's certificate of\r\nracial purity, one is led to suspect a Caucasic strain, perhaps through\r\nthe neighbouring Salars. These are no doubt sometimes called\r\nKara-Tangutans, \"Black Tangutans,\" from the colour of their tents, but\r\nwe learn from Potanin, who visited them in 1885[387], that they are\r\nMuhammadans of Turki stock and speech, and we already know[388] that\r\nfrom a remote period the Turki people were in close contact with\r\nCaucasians. The Salars pitch their tents on the banks of the Khitai and\r\nother Yang-tse-Kiang headstreams.\r\n\r\nThat the national name Bod-pa must be of considerable antiquity is\r\nevident from the Sanskrit expression _Bhotiya_, derived from it, and\r\nlong applied by the Hindus collectively to all southern Tibetans, but\r\nespecially to those of the Himalayan slopes, such as the Rongs (Lepchas)\r\nof Sikkim and the _Lho-pa_ dominant in Bhutan, properly _Bhot-ant_, that\r\nis, \"Land's End\"--the extremity of Tibet. Eastwards also the Tibetan\r\nrace stretches far beyond the political frontiers into the Koko-nor\r\nregion (Tanguts), and the Chinese province of Se-chuan, where they are\r\ngrouped with all the other Si-fan aborigines. Towards the south-east are\r\nthe kindred _Tawangs_, _Mishmi_, _Miri_, _Abor_[389], _Daflas_, and many\r\nothers about the Assam borderlands, all of whom may be regarded as true\r\nBhotiyas in the wild state.\r\n\r\nThrough these the primitive Tibetan race extends into Burma, where\r\nhowever it has become greatly modified and again civilised under\r\ndifferent climatic and cultural influences. Thus we see how, in the\r\ncourse of ages, the Bod-pa have widened their domain, radiating in all\r\ndirections from the central cradle-land about the Upper Brahmaputra\r\n(San-po) valley westwards into Kashmir, eastwards into China, southwards\r\ndown the Himalayan slopes to the Gangetic plains, south-eastwards to\r\nIndo-China. In some places they have come into contact with other races\r\nand disappeared either by total extinction or by absorption (India,\r\nHindu-Kush), or else preserved their type while accepting the speech,\r\nreligion, and culture of later intruders. Such are the _Garhwali_, and\r\nmany groups in Nepal, especially the dominant _Gurkhas_ (_Khas_[390]),\r\nof whom there are twelve branches, all Aryanised and since the twelfth\r\ncentury speaking the _Parbattia Bhasha_, a Prakrit or vulgar Sanskrit\r\ntongue current amongst an extremely mixed population of about 2,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn other directions the migrations took place in remote prehistoric\r\ntimes, the primitive proto-Tibetan groups becoming more and more\r\nspecialised as they receded farther and farther from the cradle-land\r\ninto Mongolia, Siberia, China, Farther India, and Malaysia. This is at\r\nleast how I understand the peopling of a great part of the eastern\r\nhemisphere by an original nucleus of Mongolic type first differentiated\r\nfrom a pleistocene precursor on the Tibetan tableland.\r\n\r\nStrangely contradictory estimates have been formed of the temperament\r\nand mental characters of the Bod-pa, some, such as that of Turner[391],\r\nno doubt too favourable, while others err perhaps in the opposite\r\ndirection. Thus Desgodins, who nevertheless knew them well, describes\r\nthe cultured Tibetan of the south as \"a slave towards the great, a\r\ndespot towards the weak, knavish or treacherous according to\r\ncircumstances, always on the look-out to defraud, and lying impudently\r\nto attain his end,\" and much more to the same effect[392].\r\n\r\nW. W. Rockhill, who is less severe, thinks that \"the Tibetan's character\r\nis not as black as Horace della Penna and Desgodins have painted it.\r\nIntercourse with these people extending over six years leads me to\r\nbelieve that the Tibetan is kindhearted, affectionate, and\r\nlaw-abiding[393].\" He concludes, however, with a not very flattering\r\nnative estimate deduced from the curious national legend that \"the\r\nearliest inhabitants of Tibet descended from a king of monkeys and a\r\nfemale hobgoblin, and the character of the race perhaps from those of\r\nits first parents. From the king of monkeys [he was an incarnate god]\r\nthey have religious faith and kindheartedness, intelligence and\r\napplication, devotion to religion and to religious debate; from the\r\nhobgoblin they get cruelty, fondness for trade and money-making, great\r\nbodily strength, lustfulness, fondness for gossip, and carnivorous\r\ninstinct[394].\"\r\n\r\nWhile they are cheerful under a depressing priestly regime, all allow\r\nthat they are vindictive, superstitious, and cringing in the presence of\r\nthe lamas, who are at heart more dreaded than revered. In fact the whole\r\nreligious world is one vast organised system of hypocrisy, and above the\r\nold pagan beliefs common to all primitive peoples there is merely a\r\nveneer of Buddhism, above which follows another and most pernicious\r\nveneer of lamaism (priestcraft), under the yoke of which the natural\r\ndevelopment of the people has been almost completely arrested for\r\nseveral centuries. The burden is borne with surprising endurance, and\r\nwould be intolerable but for the relief found in secret and occasionally\r\neven open revolt against the more oppressive ordinances of the\r\necclesiastical rule. Thus, despite the prescriptions regarding a strict\r\nvegetarian diet expressed in the formula \"eat animal flesh eat thy\r\nbrother,\" not only laymen but most of the lamas themselves supplement\r\ntheir frugal diet of milk, butter, barley-meal, and fruits with game,\r\nyak, and mutton--this last pronounced by Turner the best in the world.\r\nThe public conscience, however, is saved by a few extra turns of the\r\nprayer-wheel at such repasts, and by the general contempt in which is\r\nheld the hereditary caste of butchers, who like the Jews in medieval\r\ntimes are still confined to a \"ghetto\" of their own in all the large\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nThese remarks apply more particularly to the settled southern\r\ncommunities living in districts where a little agriculture is possible.\r\nElsewhere the religious cloak is worn very loosely, and the nomad\r\n_Horsoks_ of the northern steppes, although all nominal Buddhists, pay\r\nbut scant respect to the decrees supposed to emanate from the Dalai Lama\r\nenshrined in Lhasa. Horsok is an almost unique ethnical term[395], being\r\na curious compound of the two names applied by the Tibetans to the\r\n_Hor-pa_ and the _Sok-pa_ who divide the steppe between them. The\r\nHor-pa, who occupy the western parts, are of Turki stock, and are the\r\nonly group of that race known to me who profess Buddhism[396], all the\r\nrest being Muhammadans with some Shamanists (Yakuts) in the Lena basin.\r\nThe Sok-pa, who roam the eastern plains and valleys, although commonly\r\ncalled Mongols, are true Tibetans or more strictly speaking Tanguts, of\r\nwhom there are here two branches, the _Goliki_ and the _Yegrai_, all,\r\nlike the Hor-pa, of Tibetan speech. The Yegrai, as described by\r\nPrjevalsky, closely resemble the other North Tibetan tribes, with their\r\nlong, matted locks falling on their shoulders, their scanty whiskers\r\nand beard, angular head, dark complexion and dirty garb[397].\r\n\r\nBesides stock-breeding and predatory warfare, all these groups follow\r\nthe hunt, armed with darts, bows, and matchlock guns; the musk-deer is\r\nensnared, and the only animal spared is the stag, \"Buddha's horse.\" The\r\ntaste of these rude nomads for liquid blood is insatiable, and the\r\nsurveyor, Nain Singh, often saw them fall prone on the ground to lick up\r\nthe blood flowing from a wounded beast. As soon as weaned, the very\r\nchildren and even the horses are fed on a diet of cheese, butter, and\r\nblood, kneaded together in a horrible mess, which is greedily devoured\r\nwhen the taste is acquired. On the other hand alcoholic drinks are\r\nlittle consumed, the national beverage being coarse Chinese tea imported\r\nin the form of bricks and prepared with _tsampa_ (barley-meal) and\r\nbutter, and thus becoming a food as well as a drink. The lamas have a\r\nmonopoly of this tea-trade, which could not stand the competition of the\r\nIndian growers; hence arises the chief objection to removing the\r\nbarriers of seclusion.\r\n\r\nTibet is one of the few regions where polyandrous customs, intimately\r\nassociated with the matriarchal state, still persist almost in their\r\npristine vigour. The husbands are usually but not necessarily all\r\nbrothers, and the bride is always obtained by purchase. Unless otherwise\r\narranged, the oldest husband is the putative \"father,\" all the others\r\nbeing considered as \"uncles.\" An inevitable result of the institution is\r\nto give woman a dominant position in society; hence the \"queens\" of\r\ncertain tribes, referred to with so much astonishment by the early\r\nChinese chroniclers. Survivors of this \"petticoat government\" have been\r\nnoticed by travellers amongst the Lolos, Mossos, and other indigenous\r\ncommunities about the Indo-Chinese frontiers. But it does not follow\r\nthat polyandry and a matriarchal state always and necessarily preceded\r\npolygyny and a patriarchal state. On the contrary, it would appear that\r\npolyandry never could have been universal; possibly it arose from\r\nspecial conditions in particular regions, where the struggle for\r\nexistence is severe, and the necessity of imposing limits to the\r\nincrease of population more urgent than elsewhere[398]. Hence to me it\r\nseems as great a mistake to assume a matriarchate as it is to assume\r\npromiscuity as the universal antecedent of all later family relations.\r\nIn Tibet itself polygyny exists side by side with polyandry amongst the\r\nwealthy classes, while monogamy is the rule amongst the poor pastoral\r\nnomads of the northern steppe.\r\n\r\nGreat ethnical importance has been attached by some distinguished\r\nanthropologists to the treatment of the dead. But, as in the New Stone\r\nand Metal Ages in Europe cremation and burial were practised side by\r\nside[399], so in Tibet the dead are now simultaneously disposed of in\r\ndiverse ways. It is a question not so much of race as of caste or social\r\nclasses, or of the lama's pleasure, who, when the head has been shaved\r\nto facilitate the transmigration of the soul, may order the body to be\r\nburnt, buried, cast into the river, or even thrown to carrion birds or\r\nbeasts of prey. Strange to say, the last method, carried out with\r\ncertain formalities, is one of the most honourable, although the lamas\r\nare generally buried in a seated posture, and high officials burnt, and\r\n(in Ladakh) the ashes, mixed with a little clay, kneaded into much\r\nvenerated effigies--doubtless a survival of ancestry worship.\r\n\r\nReference was above made to the primitive Shamanistic ideas which still\r\nsurvive beneath the Buddhist and the later lamaistic systems. In the\r\ncentral and eastern provinces of Ui and Tsang this pre-Buddhist religion\r\nhas again struggled to the surface, or rather persisted under the name\r\nof _Bonbo_ (_Boa-ho_) side by side with the national creed, from which\r\nit has even borrowed many of its present rites. From the colour of the\r\nrobes usually worn by its priests, it is known as the sect of the\r\n\"Blacks,\" in contradistinction to the orthodox \"Yellow\" and dissenting\r\n\"Red\" lamaists, and as now constituted, its origin is attributed to\r\nShen-rab (Gsen-rabs), who flourished about the fifth century before the\r\nnew era, and is venerated as the equal of Buddha himself. His followers,\r\nwho were powerful enough to drive Buddhism from Tibet in the tenth\r\ncentury, worship 18 chief deities, the best known being the red and\r\nblack demons, the snake devil, and especially the fiery tiger-god,\r\nfather of all the secondary members of this truly \"diabolical pantheon.\"\r\nIt is curious to note that the sacred symbol of the Bonbo sect is the\r\nubiquitous svastika, only with the hooks of the cross reversed, [Symbol]\r\ninstead of [Symbol]. This change, which appears to have escaped the\r\ndiligent research of Thomas Wilson[400], was caused by the practice of\r\nturning the prayer-wheel from right to left as the red lamas do, instead\r\nof from left to right as is the orthodox way. The common Buddhist\r\nformula of six syllables--_om-ma-ni-pad-me-hum_--is also replaced by one\r\nof seven syllables--_ma-tri-mon-tre-sa-ta-dzun_[401].\r\n\r\nBuddhism itself, introduced by Hindu missionaries, is more recent than\r\nis commonly supposed. Few conversions were made before the fifth century\r\nof our era, and the first temple dates only from the year 698. Reference\r\nis often made to the points of contact or \"coincidences\" which have been\r\nobserved between this system and that of the Oriental and Latin\r\nChristian Churches. There is no question of a common dogma, and the\r\nnumerous resemblances are concerned only with ritualistic details, such\r\nas the cross, the mitre, dalmatica, and other distinctive vestments,\r\nchoir singing, exorcisms, the thurible, benedictions with outstretched\r\nhand, celibacy, the rosary, fasts, processions, litanies, spiritual\r\nretreats, holy water, scapulars or other charms, prayer addressed to the\r\nsaints, relics, pilgrimages, music and bells at the service,\r\nmonasticism; this last being developed to a far greater extent in Tibet\r\nthan at any time in any Christian land, Egypt not excepted. The lamas,\r\nrepresenting the regular clergy of the Roman Church, hold a monopoly of\r\nall \"science,\" letters, and arts. The block printing-presses are all\r\nkept in the huge monasteries which cover the land, and from them are\r\nconsequently issued only orthodox works and treatises on magic. Religion\r\nitself is little better than a system of magic, and the sole aim of all\r\nworship, reduced to a mere mechanical system of routine, is to baffle\r\nthe machinations of the demons who at every turn beset the path of the\r\nwayfarer through this \"vale of tears.\"\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the prayer-wheels--an ingenious contrivance by which\r\ninnumerable supplications, not less efficacious because vicarious, may\r\nbe offered up night and day to the powers of darkness--are incessantly\r\nkept going all over the land, some being so cleverly arranged that the\r\nsacred formula may be repeated as many as 40,000 times at each\r\nrevolution of the cylinder. These machines, which have also been\r\nintroduced into Korea and Japan, have been at work for several centuries\r\nwithout any appreciable results, although fitted up in all the houses,\r\nby the river banks or on the hill-side, and kept in motion by the hand,\r\nwind, and water; while others of huge size, 30 to 40 feet high and 15 to\r\n20 in diameter, stand in the temples, and at each turn repeat the\r\ncontents of whole volumes of liturgical essays stowed away in their\r\ncapacious receptacles. But despite all these everlasting revolutions,\r\nstagnation reigns supreme throughout the most priest-ridden land under\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nWith its religion Tibet imported also its letters from India by the\r\nroute of Nepal or Kashmir in the seventh century. Since then the\r\nlanguage has undergone great changes, always, like other members of the\r\nIndo-Chinese family, in the direction from agglutination towards\r\nmonosyllabism[402]. But the orthography, apart from a few feeble efforts\r\nat reform, has remained stationary, so that words are still written as\r\nthey were pronounced 1200 years ago. The result is a far greater\r\ndiscrepancy between the spoken and written tongue than in any other\r\nlanguage, English not excepted. Thus the province of Ui has been\r\nidentified by Sir A. Cunningham with Ptolemy's _Debasae_ through its\r\nwritten form _Dbus_, though now always pronounced _U_[403]. This bears\r\nout de Lacouperie's view that all words were really uttered as\r\noriginally spelt, although often beginning with as many as three\r\nconsonants. Thus _spra_ (monkey) is now pronounced _deu_ in the Lhasa\r\ndialect, but still _streu-go_ in that of the province of Kham. The\r\nphonetic disintegration is still going on, so that, barring reform, the\r\ntime must come when there will be no correspondence at all between sound\r\nand its graphic expression.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it is a mistake to suppose that all languages in the\r\nIndo-Chinese linguistic zone have undergone this enormous extent of\r\nphonetic decay. The indefatigable B. H. Hodgson has made us acquainted\r\nwith several, especially in Nepal, which are of a highly conservative\r\ncharacter. Farther east the _Lepcha_ (properly _Rong_) of Sikkim\r\npresents the remarkable peculiarity of distinct agglutination of the\r\nMongolo-Turki, or perhaps I should say of the Kuki-Lushai type, combined\r\nwith numerous homophones and a total absence of tone. Thus _pano-sa_, of\r\na king, _pano-sang_, kings, and _pano-sang-sa_, of kings, shows pure\r\nagglutination, while _mat_ yields no less than twenty-three distinct\r\nmeanings[404], which should necessitate a series of discriminating\r\ntones, as in Chinese or Siamese. Their absence, however, is readily\r\nexplained by the persistence of the agglutinative principle, which\r\nrenders them unnecessary.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar feature is presented by the Angami Naga, the chief\r\nlanguage of the Naga Hills, of which R. B. McCabe writes that it is\r\n\"still in a very primitive stage of the agglutinating class,\" and\r\n\"peculiarly rich in intonation,\" although \"for one Naga who clearly\r\nmarks these tonal distinctions twenty fail to do so[405].\" It follows\r\nthat it is mainly spoken without tones, and although said to be\r\n\"distinctly monosyllabic\" it really abounds in polysyllables, such as\r\n_merenama_, orphan, _kehutsaporimo_, nowhere, _dukriwache_, to kill,\r\netc. There are also numerous verbal formative elements given by McCabe\r\nhimself, so that Angami must clearly be included in the agglutinating\r\norder. To this order also belongs beyond all doubt the _Kuki-Lushai_ of\r\nthe neighbouring North Kachar Hills and parts of Nagaland itself, the\r\ncommon speech in fact of the _Rangkhols_, _Jansens_, _Lushai_, _Roeys_\r\nand other hill peoples, collectively called _Kuki_ by the lowlanders,\r\nand _Dzo_ by themselves[406]. The highly agglutinating character of this\r\nlanguage is evident from the numerous conjugations given by\r\nSoppitt[407], for some of which he has no names, but which may be called\r\n_Acceleratives_, _Retardatives_, _Complementatives_, and so on. Thus\r\nwith the root, _ahong_, come, and infix _jam_, slow, is formed the\r\nretardative _nang ahongjamrangmoh_, \"will-you-come-slowly?\" (_rang_,\r\nfuture, _moh_, interrogative particle)[408].\r\n\r\nThe Kuki, the Naga and the Manipuri, none of which claim to be the\r\noriginal occupants of the country, have a tradition of a common\r\nancestor, who had three sons who became the progenitors of the tribes.\r\nThe Kuki are found almost everywhere throughout Manipur. \"We are like\r\nthe birds of the air,\" said a Kuki to T. C. Hodson, \"we make our nests\r\nhere this year, and who knows where we shall build next year[409]?\" The\r\nfollowing description is given of the Naga tribes, _Tangkhuls_, _Mao_\r\nand _Maram Nagas_ (_Angami Nagas_), _Kolya_, or _Mayang Khong_ group,\r\n_Kabuis_, _Quoirengs_, _Chirus_ and _Marrings_. \"Differences of stature,\r\ndress, coiffure and weapons make it easy to distinguish between the\r\nmembers of these tribes. In colour they are all brown with but little\r\nvariety, though some of the Tangkhuls who earn their living by salt\r\nmaking seem to be darker. Among them all, as among the Manipuris, there\r\nare persons who have a tinge of colour in their cheeks when still young.\r\nThe nose also varies, for there are cases where it is almost straight,\r\nwhile in the majority of individuals it is flattened at the nostril.\r\nHere and there one may see noses which in profile are almost Roman. The\r\neyes are usually brown, though black eyes are sometimes found to occur.\r\nThe jaw is generally clean, not heavy, and the hair is of some variety,\r\nas there are many persons whose hair is decidedly curly, and in most\r\nthere is a wave. Beards are very uncommon, and hair on the face is very\r\nrare, so much so that the few who possess a moustache are known as\r\n_khoi-hao-bas_ (Meithei words, meaning moustache grower). I am informed\r\nthat the ladies do not like hirsute men, and that the men therefore pull\r\nout any stray hairs. The cheekbones are often prominent and the slope of\r\nthe eye is not very marked[410].\" The stature is moderate varying from\r\nthe slender lightly built Marrings to the tall sturdy finely\r\nproportioned Maos. The women are all much shorter than the men, but\r\nstrongly built with a muscular development of which the men would not be\r\nashamed. The land is thickly peopled with local deities and at Maram the\r\ncase is recorded of a Rain Deity who was once a man of the village\r\nspecially cunning in rain making. Among the points of special interest\r\nin this region are the stone monuments still erected in honour of the\r\ndead, and the custom of head-hunting, connected with simple blood feud,\r\nwith agrarian rites, with funerary rites and eschatological belief, and\r\nin some cases no more than a social duty[411].\r\n\r\nThrough these Naga and Kuki aborigines we pass without any break of\r\ncontinuity from the Bhotiya populations of the Himalayan slopes to those\r\nof Indo-China. Here also, as indeed in nearly all semi-civilised lands,\r\npeoples at various grades of culture are found dwelling for ages side by\r\nside--rude and savage groups on the uplands or in the more dense wooded\r\ntracts, settled communities with a large measure of political unity (in\r\nfact nations and peoples in the strict sense of those terms) on the\r\nlowlands, and especially along the rich alluvial riverine plains of this\r\nwell watered region. The common theory is that the wild tribes represent\r\nthe true aborigines driven to the hills and woodlands by civilised\r\ninvaders from India and other lands, who are now represented by the\r\nsettled communities.\r\n\r\nWhether such movements and dislocations have elsewhere taken place we\r\nneed not here stop to inquire; indeed their probability, and in some\r\ninstances their certainty may be frankly admitted. But I cannot think\r\nthat the theory expresses the true relations in most parts of Farther\r\nIndia. Here the civilised peoples, and _ex hypothesi_ the intruders, are\r\nthe Manipuri, Burmese, Arakanese, and the nearly extinct or absorbed\r\nTalaings or Mons in the west; the Siamese, Shans or Laos, and Khamti in\r\nthe centre; the Annamese (Tonkinese and Cochin-Chinese), Cambojans, and\r\nthe almost extinct Champas in the east. Nearly all of these I hold to be\r\nquite as indigenous as the hillmen, the only difference being that,\r\nthanks to their more favourable environment, they emerged at an early\r\ndate from the savage state and thus became more receptive to foreign\r\ncivilising influences, mostly Hindu, but also Chinese (in Annam). All\r\nare either partly or mainly of Mongolic or Indonesian type, and all\r\nspeak toned Indo-Chinese languages, except the Cambojans and Champas,\r\nwhose linguistic relations are with the Oceanic peoples, who are not\r\nhere in question. The cultivated languages are no doubt full of Sanskrit\r\nor Prakrit terms in the west and centre, and of Chinese in the east, and\r\nall, except Annamese, which uses a Chinese ideographic system, are\r\nwritten with alphabets derived through the square Pali characters from\r\nthe Devanagari. It is also true that the vast monuments of Burma, Siam,\r\nand Camboja all betray Hindu influences, many of the temples being\r\ncovered with Brahmanical or Buddhist sculptures and inscriptions. But\r\nprecisely analogous phenomena are reproduced in Java, Sumatra, and other\r\nMalaysian lands, as well as in Japan and partly in China itself. Are we\r\nthen to conclude that there have been Hindu invasions and settlements in\r\nall these regions, the most populous on the globe?\r\n\r\nDuring the historic period a few Hinduized Dravidians, especially\r\nTelingas (Telugus) of the Coromandel coast, have from time to time\r\nemigrated to Indo-China (Pegu), where the name survives amongst the\r\n\"Talaings,\" that is, the Mons, by whom they were absorbed, just as the\r\nMons themselves are now being absorbed by the Burmese. Others of the\r\nsame connection have gained a footing here and there in Malaysia,\r\nespecially the Malacca coastlands, where they are called \"Klings[412],\"\r\n_i.e._ Telings, Telingas.\r\n\r\nBut beyond these partial movements, without any kind of influence on the\r\ngeneral ethnical relations, I know of no Hindu (some have even used the\r\nterm \"Aryan,\" and have brought Aryans to Camboja) invasions except those\r\nof a moral order--the invasions of the zealous Hindu missionaries, both\r\nBrahman and Buddhist, which, however, amply suffice to account for all\r\nthe above indicated points of contact between the Indian, the\r\nIndo-Chinese, and the Malayan populations.\r\n\r\nThat the civilised lowlanders and rude highlanders are generally of the\r\nsame aboriginal stocks is well seen in the Manipur district with its\r\nfertile alluvial plains and encircling Naga and Lushai Hills on the\r\nnorth and south. The Hinduized Manipuri of the plains, that is, the\r\npolitically dominant _Meithis_, as they call themselves, are considered\r\nby George Watt to be \"a mixed race between the Kukies and the\r\nNagas[413].\" The Meithis are described as possessing in general the\r\nfacial characteristics of Mongolian type, but with great diversity of\r\nfeature. \"It is not uncommon to meet with girls with brownish-black\r\nhair, brown eyes, fair complexions, straight noses and rosy\r\ncheeks[414].\" In spite of the veneer of civilisation acquired by the\r\nMeithis, the old order of things has by no means passed away. \"The\r\n_maiba_, the doctor and priest of the animistic system, still finds a\r\nlivelihood despite the competition on the one hand of the Brahmin, and\r\non the other of the hospital Assistant. Nevertheless the _maibas_\r\nfrequently adapt their methods to the altered circumstances in which\r\nthey now find themselves, and realize that the combination of croton oil\r\nand a charm is more efficacious than the charm alone[415].\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible to discover at least four definite orders of spiritual\r\nbeings who have crystallized out from the amorphous mass of animistic\r\nDeities. There are the _Lam Lai_, gods of the country-side who shade off\r\ninto Nature Gods controlling the rain, the primal necessity of an\r\nagricultural community; the _Umang Lai_ or Deities of the Forest Jungle;\r\nthe _Imung Lai_, the Household Deities, Lords of the lives, the births\r\nand the deaths of individuals, and there are Tribal Ancestors, the\r\nritual of whose worship is a strange compound of magic and\r\nNature-worship. Beyond these Divine beings, who possess in some sort a\r\nmajesty of orderly decent behaviour, there are spirits of the mountain\r\npasses, spirits of the lakes and rivers, vampires and all the horrid\r\nlegion of witchcraft.... It is difficult to estimate the precise effect\r\nof Hinduism on the civilisation of the people, for to the outward\r\nobserver they seem to have adopted only the festivals, the outward\r\nritual, the caste marks and the exclusiveness of Hinduism, while all\r\nunmindful of its spirit and inward essentials. Colonel McCulloch\r\nremarked nearly fifty years ago that 'In fact their observances are only\r\nfor appearance sake, not the promptings of the heart[416].'\"\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the Manipuri are also devoted to the game of polo,\r\nwhich R. C. Temple tells us they play much in the same way as do the\r\nBalti and Ladakhi at the opposite extremity of the Himalayas. Another\r\nremarkable link with the \"Far West\" is the term _Khel_, which has\r\ntravelled all the way from Persia or Parthia through Afghanistan to\r\nNagaland, where it retains the same meaning of clan or section of a\r\nvillage, and produces the same disintegrating effects as amongst the\r\nAfghans. In Angamiland each village is split into two or more Khels, and\r\n\"it is no unusual state of affairs to find Khel A of one village at war\r\nwith Khel B of another, while not at war with Khel B of its own village.\r\nThe Khels are often completely separated by great walls, the people on\r\neither side living within a few yards of each other, yet having no\r\ndealings whatever. Each Khel has its own headman, but little respect is\r\npaid to the chief: each Khel maybe described as a small republic[417].\"\r\nThere appears to be no trace even of a _jirga_, or council of elders, by\r\nwhich some measure of cohesion is imparted to the Afghan Khel system.\r\n\r\nFrom the Kuki-Nagas the transition is unbroken to the large group of\r\n_Chins_ of the Chindwin valley, named from them, and thence northwards\r\nto the rude _Kakhyens_ (_Kachins_) about the Irawadi headstreams and\r\nsouthwards to the numerous _Karen_ tribes, who occupy the ethnical\r\nparting-line between Burma and Siam all the way down to Tenasserim.\r\n\r\nFor the first detailed account of the Chins we are indebted to S. Carey\r\nand H. N. Tuck[418], who accept B. Houghton's theory that these tribes,\r\nas well as the Kuki-Lushai, \"originally lived in what we now know as\r\nTibet, and are of one and the same stock; their form of government,\r\nmethod of cultivation, manners and customs, beliefs and traditions, all\r\npoint to one origin.\" The term Chin, said to be a Burmese form of the\r\nChinese _jin_, \"men,\" is unknown to these aborigines, who call\r\nthemselves _Yo_ in the north and _Lai_ in the south, while in Lower\r\nBurma they are _Shu_.\r\n\r\nIn truth there is no recognised collective name, and _Shendu_ (_Sindhu_)\r\noften so applied is proper only to the once formidable Chittagong and\r\nArakan frontier tribes, _Klangklangs_ and _Hakas_, who with the _Sokte_,\r\n_Tashons_, _Siyirs_, and others are now reduced and administered from\r\nFalam. Each little group has its own tribal name, and often one or two\r\nothers, descriptive, abusive and so on, given them by their neighbours.\r\nThus the _Nwengals_ (_Nun_, river, _ngal_, across) are only that section\r\nof the Soktes now settled on the farther or right bank of the Manipur,\r\nwhile the Soktes themselves (_Sok_, to go down, _te_, men) are so called\r\nbecause they migrated from Chin Nwe (9 miles from Tiddim), cradle of the\r\nChin race, down to Molbem, their earliest settlement, which is the\r\nMobingyi of the Burmese. So with Siyin, the Burmese form of _Sheyante_\r\n(_she_, alkali, _yan_, side, _te_, men), the group who settled by the\r\nalkali springs east of Chin Nwe, who are the _Taute_ (\"stout\" or\r\n\"sturdy\" people) of the Lushai and southern Chins. Let these few\r\nspecimens suffice as a slight object-lesson in the involved tribal\r\nnomenclature which prevails, not only amongst the Chins, but everywhere\r\nin the Tibeto-Indo-Chinese domain, from the north-western Himalayas to\r\nCape St James at the south-eastern extremity of Farther India. I have\r\nmyself collected nearly a thousand such names of clans, septs, and\r\nfragmentary groups within this domain, and am well aware that the list\r\nneither is, nor ever can be, complete, the groups themselves often being\r\nunstable quantities in a constant state of fluctuation.\r\n\r\nMost of the Chin groups have popular legends to explain either their\r\norigin or their present reduced state. Thus the Tawyans, a branch of the\r\nTashons, claim to be Torrs, that is, the people of the Rawvan district,\r\nwho were formerly very powerful, but were ruined by their insane\r\nefforts to capture the sun. Building a sort of Jacob's ladder, they\r\nmounted higher and higher; but growing tired, quarrelled among\r\nthemselves, and one day, while half of them were clambering up the pole,\r\nthe other half below cut it down just as they were about to seize the\r\nsun. So the Whenohs, another Tashon group, said to be Lushais left\r\nbehind in a district now forming part of Chinland, tell a different\r\ntale. They say they came out of the rocks at Sepi, which they think was\r\ntheir original home. They share, however, this legend of their\r\nunderground origin with the Soktes and several other Chin tribes.\r\n\r\nAmid much diversity of speech and physique the Chins present some common\r\nmental qualities, such as \"slow speech, serious manner, respect for\r\nbirth and knowledge of pedigrees, the duty of revenge, the taste for a\r\ntreacherous method of warfare, the curse of drink, the virtue of\r\nhospitality, the clannish feeling, the vice of avarice, the filthy state\r\nof the body, mutual distrust, impatience under control, the want of\r\npower of combination and of continued effort, arrogance in victory,\r\nspeedy discouragement and panic in defeat[419].\"\r\n\r\nPhysically they are a fine race, taller and stouter than the surrounding\r\nlowlanders, men 5 feet 10 or 11 inches being common enough among the\r\nindependent southerners. There are some \"perfectly proportioned giants\r\nwith a magnificent development of muscle.\" Yet dwarfs are met with in\r\nsome districts, and in others \"the inhabitants are a wretched lot, much\r\nafflicted with goitre, amongst whom may be seen cretins who crawl about\r\non all fours with the pigs in the gutter. At Dimlo, in the Sokte tract,\r\nleprosy has a firm hold on the inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough often described as devil-worshippers, the Chins really worship\r\nneither god nor devil. The northerners believe there is no Supreme\r\nBeing, and although the southerners admit a \"Kozin\" or head god, to whom\r\nthey sacrifice, they do not worship him, and never look to him for any\r\ngrace or mercy, except that of withholding the plagues and misfortunes\r\nwhich he is capable of working on any in this world who offend him.\r\nBesides Kozin, there are _nats_ or spirits of the house, family, clan,\r\nfields; and others who dwell in particular places in the air, the\r\nstreams, the jungle, and the hills. Kindly _nats_ are ignored; all\r\nothers can and will do harm unless propitiated[420].\r\n\r\nThe departed go to _Mithikwa_, \"Dead Man's Village,\" which is divided\r\ninto _Pwethikwa_, the pleasant abode, and _Sathikwa_, the wretched abode\r\nof the _unavenged_. Good or bad deeds do not affect the future of man,\r\nwho must go to Pwethikwa if he dies a natural or accidental death, and\r\nto Sathikwa if killed, and there bide till avenged by blood. Thus the\r\nvendetta receives a sort of religious sanction, strengthened by the\r\nbelief that the slain becomes the slave of the slayer in the next world.\r\n\"Should the slayer himself be slain, then the first slain is the slave\r\nof the second slain, who in turn is the slave of the man who killed\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nWhether a man has been honest or dishonest in this world is of no\r\nconsequence in the next existence; but, if he has killed many people in\r\nthis world, he has many slaves to serve him in his future existence; if\r\nhe has killed many wild animals, then he will start well-supplied with\r\nfood, for all that he kills on earth are his in the future existence. In\r\nthe next existence hunting and drinking will certainly be practised, but\r\nwhether fighting and raiding will be indulged in is unknown.\r\n\r\nCholera and small-pox are spirits, and when cholera broke out among the\r\nChins who visited Rangoon in 1895 they carried their _dahs_ (knives)\r\ndrawn to scare off the _nat_, and spent the day hiding under bushes, so\r\nthat the spirit should not find them. Some even wanted to sacrifice a\r\nslave boy, but were talked over to substitute some pariah dogs. They\r\nfirmly believe in the evil eye, and the Hakas think the Sujins and\r\nothers are all wizards, whose single glance can bewitch them, and may\r\ncause lizards to enter the body and devour the entrails. A Chin once\r\ncomplained to Surgeon-Major Newland that a _nat_ had entered his stomach\r\nat the glance of a Yahow, and he went to hospital quite prepared to die.\r\nBut an emetic brought him round, and he went off happy in the belief\r\nthat he had vomited the _nat_.\r\n\r\nEthnically connected with the Kuki-Naga groups are the _Kakhyens_ of the\r\nIrawadi headstreams, and the _Karens_, who form numerous village\r\ncommunities about the Burma-Siamese borderland. The Kakhyens, so called\r\nabusively by the Burmese, are the _Cacobees_ of the early writers[421],\r\nwhose proper name is _Singpho_ (_Chingpaw_), i.e. \"Men[422],\" and whose\r\ncurious semi-agglutinating speech, spoken in an ascending tone, each\r\nsentence ending in a long-drawn _i_ in a higher key (Bigandet), shows\r\naffinities rather with the Mishmi and other North Assamese tongues than\r\nwith the cultured Burmese. They form a very widespread family,\r\nstretching from the Eastern Himalayas right into Yunnan, and presenting\r\ntwo somewhat marked physical types: (1) the true Chingpaws, with short\r\nround head, low forehead, prominent cheek-bones, slant eye, broad nose,\r\nthick protruding lips, very dark brown hair and eyes, dirty buff colour,\r\nmean height (about 5 ft. 5 or 6 in.) with disproportionately short legs;\r\n(2) a much finer race, with regular Caucasic features, long oval face,\r\npointed chin, aquiline nose. One Kakhyen belle met with at Bhamo, \"with\r\nlarge lustrous eyes and fair skin, might almost have passed for a\r\nEuropean[423].\"\r\n\r\nIt is important to note this Caucasic element, which we first meet here\r\ngoing eastwards from the Himalayas, but which is found either separate\r\nor interspersed amongst the Mongoloid populations all over the\r\nsouth-east Asiatic uplands from Tibet to Cochin-China, and passing\r\nthence into Oceanica[424].\r\n\r\nThe kinship of the Kakhyens with the still more numerous Karens is now\r\ngenerally accepted, and it is no longer found necessary to bring the\r\nlatter all the way from Turkestan. They form a large section, perhaps\r\none-sixth, of the whole population of Burma, and overflow into the west\r\nSiamese borderlands. Their subdivisions are endless, though all may be\r\nreduced to three main branches, _Sgaws_, _Pwos_ and _Bwais_, these last\r\nincluding the somewhat distinct group of _Karenni_, or \"Red Karens.\"\r\nAlthough D. M. Smeaton calls the language \"monosyllabic,\" it is\r\nevidently agglutinating, of the normal sub-Himalayan type[425].\r\n\r\nThe Karens are a short, sturdy race, with straight black and also\r\nbrownish hair, black, and even hazel eyes, and light or yellowish brown\r\ncomplexion, so that here also a Caucasic strain may be suspected.\r\n\r\nDespite the favourable pictures of the missionaries, whose propaganda\r\nhas been singularly successful amongst these aborigines, the Karens are\r\nnot an amiable or particularly friendly people, but rather shy, reticent\r\nand even surly, though trustworthy and loyal to those chiefs and guides\r\nwho have once gained their confidence. In warfare they are treacherous\r\nrather than brave, and strangely cruel even to little children. Their\r\nbelief in a divine Creator who has deserted them resembles that of the\r\nKuki people, and to the _nats_ of the Kuki correspond the _la_ of the\r\nKarens, who are even more numerous, every mountain, stream, rapid,\r\ncrest, peak or other conspicuous object having its proper indwelling\r\n_la_. There are also seven specially baneful spirits, who have to be\r\nappeased by family offerings. \"On the whole their belief in a personal\r\ngod, their tradition as to the former possession of a 'law,' and their\r\nexpectation of a prophet have made them susceptible to Christianity to a\r\ndegree that is almost unique. Of this splendid opportunity the American\r\nmission has taken full advantage, educating, civilising, welding\r\ntogether, and making a people out of the downtrodden Karen tribes, while\r\nChristianizing them[426].\"\r\n\r\nIn the Burmese division proper are comprised several groups, presenting\r\nall grades of culture, from the sheer savagery of the Mros, Kheongs, and\r\nothers of the Arakan Yoma range, and the agricultural Mugs of the Arakan\r\nplains, to the dominant historical Burmese nation of the Irawadi valley.\r\nHere also the terminology is perplexing, and it may be well to explain\r\nthat _Yoma_, applied by Logan collectively to all the Arakan Hill\r\ntribes, has no ethnic value at all, simply meaning a mountain range in\r\nBurmese[427]. _Toung-gnu_, one of Mason's divisions of the Burmese\r\nfamily, was merely a petty state founded by a younger branch of the\r\nRoyal House, and \"has no more claim to rank as a separate tribe than any\r\nother Burman town[428]. \"_Tavoyers_ are merely the people of the Tavoy\r\ndistrict, Tenasserim, originally from Arakan, and now speaking a Burmese\r\ndialect largely affected by Siamese elements; _Tungthas_, like Yoma,\r\nmeans \"Highlander,\" and is even of wider application; the Tipperahs,\r\nMrungs, Kumi, Mros, Khemis, and Khyengs are all Tungthas of Burmese\r\nstock, and speak rude Burmese dialects.\r\n\r\nThe correlative of Tungthas is _Khyungthas_, \"River People,\" that is,\r\nthe Arakan Lowlanders comprising the more civilised peoples about the\r\nmiddle and lower course of the rivers, who are improperly called _Mugs_\r\n(_Maghs_) by the Bengali, and whose real name is _Rakhaingtha_, _i.e._\r\npeople of Rakhaing (Arakan). They are undoubtedly of the same stock as\r\nthe cultured Burmese, whose traditions point to Arakan as the cradle of\r\nthe race, and in whose chronicles the Rakhaingtha are called\r\n_M'ranmakrih_, \"Great M'ranmas,\" or \"Elder Burmese.\" Both branches call\r\nthemselves _M'ranma, M'rama_ (the correct form of _Barma, Burma_, but\r\nnow usually pronounced Myamma), probably from a root _mro, myo_, \"man,\"\r\nthough connected by Burnouf with Brahma, the Brahmanical having preceded\r\nthe Buddhist religion in this region. In any case the M'rama may claim a\r\nrespectable antiquity, being already mentioned in the national records\r\nso early as the first century of the new era, when the land \"was said to\r\nbe overrun with fabulous monsters and other terrors, which are called to\r\nthis day by the superstitious natives, the five enemies. These were a\r\nfierce tiger, an enormous boar, a flying dragon, a prodigious man-eating\r\nbird, and a huge creeping pumpkin, which threatened to entangle the\r\nwhole country[429].\"\r\n\r\nThe Burmese type has been not incorrectly described as intermediate\r\nbetween the Chinese and the Malay, more refined, or at least softer than\r\neither, of yellowish brown or olive complexion, often showing very dark\r\nshades, full black and lank hair, no beard, small but straight nose,\r\nweak extremities, pliant figure, and a mean height[430].\r\n\r\nMost Europeans speak well of the Burmese people, whose bright genial\r\ntemperament and extreme friendliness towards strangers more than\r\noutweigh a natural indolence which hurts nobody but themselves, and a\r\nlittle arrogance or vanity inspired by the still remembered glories of a\r\nnation that once ruled over a great part of Indo-China. Perhaps the most\r\nremarkable feature of Burmese society is the almost democratic\r\nindependence and equality of all classes developed under an\r\nexceptionally severe Asiatic autocracy. \"They are perfectly republican\r\nin the freedom with which all ranks mingle together and talk with one\r\nanother, without any marked distinction in regard to difference of rank\r\nor wealth[431].\" Scott attributes this trait, I think rightly, to the\r\ngreat leveller, Buddhism, the true spirit of which has perhaps been\r\nbetter preserved in Burma than in any other land.\r\n\r\nThe priesthood has not become the privileged and oppressive class that\r\nhas usurped all spiritual and temporal functions in Tibet, for in Burma\r\neverybody is or has been a priest for some period of his life. All enter\r\nthe monasteries--which are the national schools--not only for general\r\ninstruction, but actually as members of the sacerdotal order. They\r\nsubmit to the tonsure, take \"minor orders,\" so to say, and wear the\r\nyellow robe, if only for a few months or weeks or days. But for the time\r\nbeing they must renounce \"the world, the flesh and the devil,\" and must\r\nplay the mendicant, make the round of the village at least once with the\r\nbegging-bowl hung round their neck in company with the regular members\r\nof the community. They thus become initiated, and it becomes no longer\r\npossible for the confraternity to impose either on the rulers or on the\r\nruled. \"Teaching is all that the brethren of the order do for the\r\npeople. They have no spiritual powers whatever. They simply become\r\nmembers of a holy society that they may observe the precepts of the\r\nMaster more perfectly, and all they do for the alms lavished on them by\r\nthe pious laity is to instruct the children in reading, writing, and the\r\nrudiments of religion[432].\"\r\n\r\nR. Grant Brown denies the common report which \"has appeared in almost\r\nevery work in which religion in Burma is dealt with\" that Burman\r\nBuddhism is superficial. \"The Burman Buddhist is at least as much\r\ninfluenced by his religion as the average Christian. The monks are\r\nprobably as strict in their religious observances as any large religious\r\nbody in the world.... Most laymen, too, obey the prohibitions against\r\nalcohol and the taking of life, though these run counter both to strong\r\nhuman instincts and to animistic practice[433].\"\r\n\r\nNor is the personal freedom here spoken of confined to the men. In no\r\nother part of the world do the women enjoy a larger measure of\r\nindependent action than in Burma, with the result that they are\r\nacknowledged to be far more virtuous, thrifty, and intelligent than\r\nthose of all the surrounding lands. Their capacity for business and\r\npetty dealings is rivalled only by their Gallic sisters; and H. S.\r\nHallett tells us that in every town and village \"you will see damsels\r\nsquatted on the floor of the verandah with diminutive, or sometimes\r\nlarge, stalls in front of them, covered with vegetables, fruit,\r\nbetel-nut, cigars and other articles. However numerous they may be, the\r\nprice of everything is known to them; and such is their idea of probity,\r\nthat pilfering is quite unknown amongst them. They are entirely trusted\r\nby their parents from their earliest years; even when they blossom into\r\nyoung women, _chaperons_ are never a necessity; yet immorality is far\r\nless customary amongst them, I am led to believe, than in any country in\r\nEurope[434].\"\r\n\r\nThis observer quotes Bishop Bigandet, a forty years' resident amongst\r\nthe natives, to the effect that \"in Burmah and Siam the doctrines of\r\nBuddhism have produced a striking, and to the lover of true civilization\r\na most interesting result--the almost complete equality of the condition\r\nof the women with that of the men. In these countries women are seen\r\ncirculating freely in the streets; they preside at the _comptoir_, and\r\nhold an almost exclusive possession of the bazaars. Their social\r\nposition is more elevated, in every respect, than in the regions where\r\nBuddhism is not the predominating creed. They may be said to be men's\r\ncompanions, and not their slaves.\"\r\n\r\nBurma is one of those regions where tattooing has acquired the rank of a\r\nfine art. Indeed the intricate designs and general pictorial effect\r\nproduced by the Burmese artists on the living body are rivalled only by\r\nthose of Japan, New Zealand, and some other Polynesian groups. Hallett,\r\nwho states that \"the Burmese, the Shans, and certain Burmanized tribes\r\nare the only peoples in the south of Asia who are known to tattoo their\r\nbody,\" tells us that the elaborate operation is performed only on the\r\nmale sex, the whole person from waist to knees, and amongst some Shan\r\ntribes from neck to foot, being covered with heraldic figures of\r\nanimals, with intervening traceries, so that at a little distance the\r\neffect is that of a pair of dark-blue breeches[435]. The pigments are\r\nlamp-black or vermilion, and the pattern is usually first traced with a\r\nfine hair pencil and then worked in by a series of punctures made by a\r\nlong pointed brass style[436].\r\n\r\nEast of Burma we enter the country of the _Shans_, one of the most\r\nnumerous and widespread peoples of Asia, who call themselves _Tai_\r\n(_T'hai_), \"Noble\" or \"Free,\" although slavery in various forms has from\r\ntime immemorial been a social institution amongst all the southern\r\ngroups. Here again tribal and national terminology is somewhat\r\nbewildering; but it will help to notice that _Shan_, said to be of\r\nChinese origin[437], is the collective Burmese name, and therefore\r\ncorresponds to _Lao_, the collective Siamese name. These two terms are\r\ntherefore rather political than ethnical, Shan denoting all the Tai\r\npeoples formerly subject to Burma and now mostly British subjects, Lao\r\nall the Tai peoples formerly subject to Siam, and now (since 1896)\r\nmostly French subjects[438]. The Siamese group them all in two\r\ndivisions, the _Lau-pang-dun_, \"Black-paunch Lao,\" so called because\r\nthey clothe themselves as it were in a dark skin-tight garb by the\r\ntattooing process; and the _Lau-pang-kah_, \"White-paunch Lao,\" who do\r\nnot tattoo. The Burmese groups call themselves collectively\r\n_Ngiou_[439], while the most general Chinese name is _Pai_ (_Pa-y_).\r\nPrince Henri d'Orleans, who is careful to point out that Pai is only\r\nanother name for Lao[440], constantly met Pai groups all along the route\r\nfrom Tonking to Assam, and the bulk of the lowland population in Assam\r\nitself belongs originally[441] to the same family, though now mostly\r\nassimilated to the Hindus in speech, religion, and general culture.\r\nAssam in fact takes its name from the _Ahoms_, the \"peerless,\" the title\r\nfirst adopted by the Mau Shan chief, Chukupha, who invaded the country\r\nfrom north-east Burma, and in 1228 A.D. founded the Ahom dynasty, which\r\nwas overthrown in 1810 by the Burmese, who were ejected in 1827 by the\r\nEnglish[442].\r\n\r\nThese Ahoms came from the Khamti (Kampti) district about the sources of\r\nthe Irawadi, where Prince Henri was surprised to find a civilised and\r\nlettered Buddhist people of Pai (Shan) speech still enjoying political\r\nautonomy in the dangerous proximity of _le leopard britannique_. They\r\ncall themselves _Padao_, and it is curious to note that both _Padam_ and\r\n_Assami_ are also tribal names amongst the neighbouring Abor Hillmen.\r\nThe French traveller was told that the Padao, who claimed to be _T'hais_\r\n(Tai) like the Laotians[443], were indigenous, and he describes the type\r\nas also Laotian--straight eyes rather wide apart, nose broad at base,\r\nforehead arched, superciliary arches prominent, thick lips, pointed\r\nchin, olive colour, slightly bronzed and darker than in the Lao country;\r\nthe men ill-favoured, the young women with pleasant features, and some\r\nwith very beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\nPassing into China we are still in the midst of Shan peoples, whose\r\nrange appears formerly to have extended up to the right bank of the\r\nYang-tse-Kiang, and whose cradle has been traced by de Lacouperie to\r\n\"the Kiu-lung mountains north of Sechuen and south of Shensi in China\r\nproper[444].\" This authority holds that they constitute a chief element\r\nin the Chinese race itself, which, as it spread southwards beyond the\r\nYang-tse-Kiang, amalgamated with the Shan aborigines, and thus became\r\nprofoundly modified both in type and speech, the present Chinese\r\nlanguage comprising over thirty per cent. of Shan ingredients. Colquhoun\r\nalso, during his explorations in the southern provinces, found that\r\n\"most of the aborigines, although known to the Chinese by various\r\nnicknames, were Shans; and that their propinquity to the Chinese was\r\nslowly changing their habits, manners, and dress, and gradually\r\nincorporating them with that people[445].\"\r\n\r\nThis process of fusion has been in progress for ages, not only between\r\nthe southern Chinese and the Shans, but also between the Shans and the\r\nCaucasic aborigines, whom we first met amongst the Kakhyens, but who are\r\nfound scattered mostly in small groups over all the uplands between\r\nTibet and the Cochin-Chinese coast range. The result is that the Shans\r\nare generally of finer physique than either the kindred Siamese and\r\nMalays in the south, or the more remotely connected Chinese in the\r\nnorth. The colour, says Bock, \"is much lighter than that of the\r\nSiamese,\" and \"in facial expression the Laotians are better-looking than\r\nthe Malays, having good high foreheads, and the men particularly having\r\nregular well-shaped noses, with nostrils not so wide as those of their\r\nneighbours[446].\" Still more emphatic is the testimony of Kreitner of\r\nthe Szechenyi expedition, who tells us that the Burmese Shans have \"a\r\nnobler head than the Chinese; the dark eyes are about horizontal, the\r\nnose is straight, the whole expression approaches that of the Caucasic\r\nrace[447].\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their wide diffusion, interminglings with other races,\r\nvaried grades of culture, and lack of political cohesion, the Tai-Shan\r\ngroups acquire a certain ethnical and even national unity from their\r\ngenerally uniform type, social usages, Buddhist religion, and common\r\nIndo-Chinese speech. Amidst a chaos of radically distinct idioms current\r\namongst the surrounding indigenous populations, they have everywhere\r\npreserved a remarkable degree of linguistic uniformity, all speaking\r\nvarious more or less divergent dialects of the same mother-tongue.\r\nExcluding a large percentage of Sanskrit terms introduced into the\r\nliterary language by their Hindu educators, this radical mother-tongue\r\ncomprises about 1860 distinct words or rather sounds, which have been\r\nreduced by phonetic decay to so many monosyllables, each uttered with\r\nfive tones, the natural tone, two higher tones, and two lower[448]. Each\r\nterm thus acquires five distinct meanings, and in fact represents five\r\ndifferent words, which were phonetically distinct dissyllables, or even\r\npolysyllables in the primitive language.\r\n\r\nThe same process of disintegration has been at work throughout the whole\r\nof the Indo-Chinese linguistic area, where all the leading\r\ntongues--Chinese, Annamese, Tai-Shan, Burmese--belong to the same\r\nisolating form of speech, which, as explained in _Ethnology_, Chap. IX.,\r\nis not a primitive condition, but a later development, the outcome of\r\nprofound phonetic corruption.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable uniformity of the Tai-Shan member of this order of speech\r\nmay be in part due to the conservative effects of the literary standard.\r\nProbably over 2000 years ago most of the Shan groups were brought under\r\nHindu influences by the Brahman, and later by the Buddhist missionaries,\r\nwho reduced their rude speech to written form, while introducing a large\r\nnumber of Sanskrit terms inseparable from the new religious ideas. The\r\nwriting systems, all based on the square Pali form of the Devanagari\r\nsyllabic characters, were adapted to the phonetic requirements of the\r\nvarious dialects, with the result that the Tai-Shan linguistic family is\r\nencumbered with four different scripts. \"The Western Shans use one very\r\nlike the Burmese; the Siamese have a character of their own, which is\r\nvery like Pali; the Shans called Lue have another character of their own;\r\nand to the north of Siam the Lao Shans have another[449].\"\r\n\r\nThese Shan alphabets of Hindu origin are supposed by de Lacouperie to be\r\nconnected with the writing systems which have been credited to the\r\nMossos, Lolos, and some other hill peoples about the Chinese and\r\nIndo-Chinese borderlands. At Lan-Chu in the Lolo country Prince Henri\r\nfound that MSS. were very numerous, and he was shown some very fine\r\nspecimens \"enlumines.\" Here, he tells us, the script is still in use,\r\nbeing employed jointly with Chinese in drawing up legal documents\r\nconnected with property. He was informed that this Lolo script comprised\r\n300 characters, read from top to bottom and from left to right[450],\r\nalthough other authorities say from right to left.\r\n\r\nOf the Lolo he gives no specimens[451], but reproduces two or three\r\npages of a Mosso book with transliteration and translation. Other\r\nspecimens, but without explanation, were already known through Gill and\r\nDesgodins, and their decipherment had exercised the ingenuity of several\r\nChinese scholars. Their failure to interpret them is now accounted for\r\nby Prince Henri, who declares that, \"strictly speaking the Mossos have\r\nno writing system. The magicians keep and still make copy-books full of\r\nhieroglyphics; each page is divided into little sections (_cahiers_)\r\nfollowing horizontally from left to right, in which are inscribed one or\r\nmore somewhat rough figures, heads of animals, men, houses, conventional\r\nsigns representing the sky or lightning, and so on.\" Some of the\r\nmagicians expounded two of the books, which contained invocations,\r\nbeginning with the creation of the world, and winding up with a\r\ncatalogue of all the evils threatening mortals, but to be averted by\r\nbeing pious, that is, by making gifts to the magicians. The same ideas\r\nare always expressed by the same signs; yet the magicians declared that\r\nthere was no alphabet, the hieroglyphs being handed down bodily from one\r\nexpert to another. Nevertheless Prince Henri looks on this as one of the\r\nfirst steps in the history of writing; \"originally many of the Chinese\r\ncharacters were simply pictorial, and if the Mossos, instead of being\r\nhemmed in, had acquired a large expansion, their sacred books might also\r\nperhaps have given birth to true characters[452].\"\r\n\r\nAlthough now \"hemmed in,\" the Mossos are a historical and somewhat\r\ncultured people, belonging to the same group as the _Iungs_ (_Njungs_),\r\nwho came from the regions north-east of Tibet, and appeared on the\r\nChinese frontiers about 600 B.C. They are referred to in the Chinese\r\nrecords of 796 A.D., when they were reduced by the king of Nanchao.\r\nAfter various vicissitudes they recognised the Chinese suzerainty in the\r\nfourteenth century, and were finally subdued in the eighteenth. De\r\nLacouperie[453] thinks they are probably of the same origin as the\r\nLolos, the two languages having much in common, and the names of both\r\nbeing Chinese, while the Lolos and the Mossos call themselves\r\nrespectively _Nossu_ (_Nesu_) and _Nashi_ (_Nashri_).\r\n\r\nEverywhere amongst these border tribes are met groups of aborigines, who\r\npresent more or less regular features which are described by various\r\ntravellers as \"Caucasic\" or \"European.\" Thus the _Kiu-tse_, who are the\r\n_Khanungs_ of the English maps, and are akin to the large _Lu-tse_\r\nfamily (_Melam_, _Anu_, _Diasu_, etc.), reminded Prince Henri of some\r\nEuropeans of his acquaintance[454], and he speaks of the light colour,\r\nstraight nose and eyes, and generally fine type of the Yayo (Yao), as\r\nthe Chinese call them, but whose real name is _Lin-tin-yu_.\r\n\r\nThe same Caucasic element reappears in a pronounced form amongst the\r\nindigenous populations of Tonking, to whom A. Billet has devoted an\r\ninstructive monograph[455]. This observer, who declares that these\r\naborigines are quite distinct both from the Chinese and the Annamese,\r\ngroups them in three main divisions--_Tho_, _Nong_, and _Man_[456]--all\r\ncollectively called _Moi_, _Muong_, and _Myong_ by the Annamese. The\r\nThos, who are the most numerous, are agriculturists, holding all the\r\nupland valleys and thinning off towards the wooded heights. They are\r\ntall compared to the Mongols (5 ft. 6 or 7 in.), lighter than the\r\nAnnamese, round-headed, with oval face, deep-set straight eyes, low\r\ncheek-bones, straight and even slightly aquiline nose not depressed at\r\nroot, and muscular frames. They are a patient, industrious, and frugal\r\npeople, now mainly subject to Chinese and Annamese influences in their\r\nsocial usages and religion. Very peculiar nevertheless are some of their\r\nsurviving customs, such as the feast of youth, the pastime of swinging,\r\nand especially chess played with living pieces, whose movements are\r\ndirected by two players. The language appears to be a Shan dialect, and\r\nto this family the writer affiliates both the Thos and the Nongs. The\r\nlatter are a much more mixed people, now largely assimilated to the\r\nChinese, although the primitive type still persists, especially amongst\r\nthe women, as is so often the case. A. Billet tells us that he often met\r\nNong women \"with light and sometimes even red hair[457].\"\r\n\r\nIt is extremely interesting to learn that the Mans came traditionally\r\n\"from a far-off western land where their forefathers were said to have\r\nlived in contact with peoples of white blood thousands of years ago.\"\r\nThis tradition, which would identify them with the above-mentioned\r\nMan-tse, is supported by their physical appearance--long head, oval\r\nface, small cheek-bones, eyes without the Mongol fold, skin not\r\nyellowish but rather \"browned by the sun,\" regular features--in nothing\r\nrecalling the traits of the yellow races.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to M. R. Verneau's comments on the rich materials\r\nbrought together by A. Billet, in whom, \"being not only a medical man,\r\nbut also a graduate in the natural sciences, absolute confidence may be\r\nplaced[458].\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mans-Tien, the Mans-Coc, the Mans-Meo (Miao, Miao-tse, or Mieu)\r\npresent a pretty complete identity with the Pan-y and the Pan-yao of\r\nSouth Kwang-si; they are the debris of a very ancient race, which with\r\nT. de Lacouperie may be called pre-Chinese. This early race, which bore\r\nthe name of _Pan-hu_ or _Ngao_, occupied Central China before the\r\narrival of the Chinese. According to M. d'Hervey de Saint-Denys, the\r\nmountains and valleys of Kwei-chau where these Miao-tse still survive\r\nwere the cradle of the Pan-hu. In any case it seems certain that the\r\nT'hai and the Man race came from Central Asia, and that, from the\r\nanthropological standpoint, they differ altogether from the Mongol group\r\nrepresented by the Chinese and the Annamese. The Man especially presents\r\nstriking affinities with the Aryan type.\"\r\n\r\nThus is again confirmed by the latest investigations, and by the\r\nconclusions of some of the leading members of the French school of\r\nanthropology, the view first advanced by me in 1879, that peoples of the\r\nCaucasic (here called \"Aryan\") division had already spread to the utmost\r\nconfines of south-east Asia in remote prehistoric times, and had in\r\nthis region even preceded the first waves of Mongolic migration\r\nradiating from their cradle-land on the Tibetan plateau[459].\r\n\r\nReference was above made to the singular lack of political cohesion at\r\nall times betrayed by the Tai-Shan peoples. The only noteworthy\r\nexception is the Siamese branch, which forms the bulk of the population\r\nin the Menam basin. In this highly favoured region of vast\r\nhill-encircled alluvial plains of inexhaustible fertility, traversed by\r\nnumerous streams navigable for light craft, and giving direct access to\r\nthe inland waters of Malaysia, the Southern Shans were able at an early\r\ndate to merge the primitive tribal groups in a great nationality, and\r\nfound a powerful empire, which at one time dominated most of Indo-China\r\nand the Malay Peninsula.\r\n\r\nSiam, alone of all the Shan states, even still maintains a precarious\r\nindependence, although now again reduced by European aggression to\r\nlittle more than the natural limits of the fluvial valley, which is\r\nusually regarded by the Southern Shans as the home of their race. Yet\r\nthey appear to have been here preceded by the Caucasic Khmers\r\n(Cambojans), whose advent is referred in the national chronicles to the\r\nyear 543 B.C. and who, according to the Hindu records, were expelled\r\nabout 443 A.D. It was through these Khmers, and not directly from India,\r\nthat the \"Sayamas\" received their Hindu culture, and the Siamese annals,\r\nmingling fact with fiction, refer to the miraculous birth of the\r\nnational hero, Phra-Ruang, who threw off the foreign yoke, declared the\r\npeople henceforth T'hai, \"Freemen,\" invented the present Siamese\r\nalphabet, and ordered the Khom (Cambojan) to be reserved in future for\r\ncopying the sacred writings.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Buddhism is assigned to the year 638 A.D., one of\r\nthe first authentic dates in the native records. The ancient city of\r\nLabong had already been founded (575), and other settlements now\r\nfollowed rapidly, always in the direction of the south, according as the\r\nShan race steadily advanced towards the seaboard, driving before them or\r\nmingling with Khmers, Lawas, Karens, and other aborigines, some now\r\nextinct, some still surviving on the wooded uplands and plateaux\r\nencircling the Menam valley. Ayuthia, the great centre of national life\r\nin later times, dates only from the year 1350, when the empire had\r\nreceived its greatest expansion, comprising the whole of Camboja, Pegu,\r\nTenasserim, and the Malay Peninsula, and extending its conquering arms\r\nacross the inland waters as far as Java[460]. Then followed the\r\ndisastrous wars with Burma, which twice captured and finally destroyed\r\nAyuthia (1767), now a picturesque elephant-park visited by tourists from\r\nthe present capital, Bangkok, founded in 1772 a little lower down the\r\nMenam.\r\n\r\nBut the elements of decay existed from the first in the institution of\r\nslavery or serfdom, which was not restricted to a particular class, as\r\nin other lands, but, before the modern reforms, extended in principle to\r\nall the kings' subjects in mockery declared \"Freemen\" by the founders of\r\nthe monarchy. This, however, may be regarded as perhaps little more than\r\na legal fiction, for at all times class distinctions were really\r\nrecognised, comprising the members of the royal family--a somewhat\r\nnumerous group--the nobles named by the king, the _leks_ or vassals, and\r\nthe people, these latter being again subdivided into three sections,\r\nthose liable to taxation, those subject to forced labour, and the slaves\r\nproper. But so little developed was the sentiment of personal dignity\r\nand freedom, that anybody from the highest noble to the humblest citizen\r\nmight at any moment lapse into the lowest category. Like most Mongoloid\r\npeoples, the Siamese are incurable gamblers, and formerly it was an\r\neveryday occurrence for a freeman to stake all his goods and chattels,\r\nwives, children, and self, on the hazard of the die.\r\n\r\nYet the women, like their Burmese sisters, have always held a somewhat\r\nhonourable social position, being free to walk abroad, go shopping,\r\nvisit their friends, see the sights, and take part in the frequent\r\npublic feastings without restriction. Those, however, who brought no\r\ndower and had to be purchased, might again be sold at any time, and\r\nmany thus constantly fell from the dignity of matrons to the position of\r\nthe merest drudges without rights or privileges of any kind. These\r\nstrange relations were endurable, thanks to the genial nature of the\r\nnational temperament, by which the hard lot of the thralls was softened,\r\nand a little light allowed to penetrate into the darkest corners[461] of\r\nthe social system. The open slave-markets, which in the vassal Lao\r\nstates fostered systematic raiding-expeditions amongst the unreduced\r\naborigines, were abolished in 1873, and since 1890 all born in slavery\r\nare free on reaching their 21st year.\r\n\r\nSiamese Buddhism is a slightly modified form of that prevailing in\r\nCeylon, although strictly practised but by few. There are two classes or\r\n\"sects,\" the reformers who attach more importance to the observance of\r\nthe canon law than to meditation, and the old believers, some devoted to\r\na contemplative life, others to the study of the sunless wilderness of\r\nBuddhist writings. But, beneath it all, spirit or devil-worship is still\r\nrife, and in many districts pure animism is practically the only\r\nreligion. Even temples and shrines have been raised to the countless\r\ngods of land and water, woods, mountains, villages and households. To\r\nthese gods are credited all sorts of calamities, and to prevent them\r\nfrom getting into the bodies of the dead the latter are brought out, not\r\nthrough door or window, but through a breach in the wall, which is\r\nafterwards carefully built up. Similar ideas prevail amongst many other\r\npeoples, both at higher and lower levels of culture, for nothing is more\r\nineradicable than such popular beliefs associated with the relations\r\npresumed to exist between the present and the after life.\r\n\r\nIncredible sums are yearly lavished in offerings to the spirits, which\r\ngive rise to an endless round of feasts and revels, and also in support\r\nof the numerous Buddhist temples, convents, and their inmates. The\r\ntreasures accumulated in the \"royal cloisters\" and other shrines\r\nrepresent a great part of the national savings--investments for the\r\nother world, among which are said to be numerous gold statues glittering\r\nwith rubies, sapphires, and other priceless gems. But in these matters\r\nthe taste of the _talapoins_[462], as the priests were formerly called,\r\nis somewhat catholic, including pictures of reviews and battle-scenes\r\nfrom the European illustrated papers, and sometimes even statues of\r\nNapoleon set up by the side of Buddha.\r\n\r\nSo numerous, absurd, and exacting are the rules of the monastic\r\ncommunities that, but for the aid of the temple servants and novices,\r\nexistence would be impossible. A list of such puerilities occupies\r\nseveral pages in A. R. Colquhoun's work _Amongst the Shans_ (219-231),\r\nand from these we learn that the monks must not dig the ground, so that\r\nthey can neither plant nor sow; must not boil rice, as it would kill the\r\ngerm; eat corn for the same reason; climb trees lest a branch get\r\nbroken; kindle a flame, as it destroys the fuel; put out a flame, as\r\nthat also would extinguish life; forge iron, as sparks would fly out and\r\nperish; swing their arms in walking; wink in speaking; buy or sell;\r\nstretch the legs when sitting; breed poultry, pigs, or other animals;\r\nmount an elephant or palanquin; wear red, black, green, or white\r\ngarments; mourn for the dead, etc., etc. In a word all might be summed\r\nup by a general injunction neither to do anything, nor not to do\r\nanything, and then despair of attaining _Nirvana_; for it would be\r\nimpossible to conceive of any more pessimistic system in theory[463].\r\nPractically it is otherwise, and in point of fact the utmost religious\r\nindifference prevails amongst all classes.\r\n\r\nWithin the Mongolic division it would be difficult to imagine any more\r\nstriking contrast than that presented by the gentle, kindly, and on the\r\nwhole not ill-favoured Siamese, and their hard-featured, hard-hearted,\r\nand grasping Annamese neighbours. Let anyone, who may fancy there is\r\nlittle or nothing in blood, pass rapidly from the bright, genial--if\r\nsomewhat listless and corrupt--social life of Bangkok to the dry,\r\nuncongenial moral atmosphere of Ha-noi or Saigon, and he will be apt to\r\nmodify his views on that point. Few observers have a good word to say\r\nfor the Tonkingese, the Cochin-Chinese, or any other branch of the\r\nAnnamese family, and some even of the least prejudiced are so outspoken\r\nthat we must needs infer there is good ground for their severe\r\nstrictures on these strange, uncouth materialists. Buddhists of course\r\nthey are nominally; but of the moral sense they have little, unless it\r\nbe (amongst the lettered classes) a pale reflection of the pale Chinese\r\nethical code. The whole region in fact is a sort of attenuated China, to\r\nwhich it owes its arts and industries, its letters, moral systems,\r\ngeneral culture, and even a large part of its inhabitants. _Giao-shi_\r\n(_Kiao-shi_), the name of the aborigines, said to mean \"Bifurcated,\" or\r\n\"Cross-toes[464],\" in reference to the wide space between the great toe\r\nand the next, occurs in the legendary Chinese records so far back as\r\n2285 B.C., since which period the two countries are supposed to have\r\nmaintained almost uninterrupted relations, whether friendly or hostile,\r\ndown to the present day. At first the Giao-shi were confined to the\r\nnorthern parts of Lu-kiang, the present Tonking, all the rest of the\r\ncoastlands being held by the powerful Champa (Tsiampa) people, whose\r\naffinities are with the Oceanic populations. But in 218 B.C., Lu-kiang\r\nhaving been reduced and incorporated with China proper, a large number\r\nof Chinese emigrants settled in the country, and gradually merged with\r\nthe Giao-shi in a single nationality, whose twofold descent is still\r\nreflected in the Annamese physical and mental characters.\r\n\r\nThis term Annam[465], however, did not come into use till the seventh\r\ncentury, when it was officially applied to the frontier river between\r\nChina and Tonking, and afterwards extended to the whole of Tonking and\r\nCochin-China. Tonking itself, meaning the \"Eastern Court[466],\" was\r\noriginally the name only of the city of Ha-noi when it was a royal\r\nresidence, but was later extended to the whole of the northern kingdom,\r\nwhose true name is _Yueeh-nan_. To this corresponded the southern\r\nKwe-Chen-Ching, \"Kingdom of Chen-Ching,\" which was so named in the ninth\r\ncentury from its capital Chen-Ching, and of which our Cochin-China\r\nappears to be a corrupt form.\r\n\r\nBut, amid all this troublesome political nomenclature, the dominant\r\nAnnamese nation has faithfully preserved its homogeneous character,\r\nspreading, like the Siamese Shans, steadily southwards, and gradually\r\nabsorbing the whole of the Champa domain to the southern extremity of\r\nthe peninsula, as well as a large part of the ancient kingdom of Camboja\r\nabout the Mekhong delta. They thus form at present the almost exclusive\r\nethnical element throughout all the lowland and cultivated parts of\r\nTonking, upper and lower Cochin-China and south Camboja, with a total\r\npopulation in 1898 of about twenty millions.\r\n\r\nThe Annamese are described in a semi-official report[467] as\r\ncharacterised by a high broad forehead, high cheek-bones, small crushed\r\nnose, rather thick lips, black hair, scant beard, mean height, coppery\r\ncomplexion, deceitful (_rusee_) expression, and rude or insolent\r\nbearing. The head is round (index 83 to 84) and the features are in\r\ngeneral flat and coarse, while to an ungainly exterior corresponds a\r\nharsh unsympathetic temperament. The Abbe Gagelin, who lived years in\r\ntheir midst, frankly declares that they are at once arrogant and\r\ndishonest, and dead to all the finer feelings of human nature, so that\r\nafter years of absence the nearest akin will meet without any outward\r\nsign of pleasure or affection. Others go further, and J. G. Scott summed\r\nit all up by declaring that \"the fewer Annamese there are, the less\r\ntaint there is on the human race.\" No doubt Lord Curzon gives a more\r\nfavourable picture, but this traveller spent only a short time in the\r\ncountry, and even he allows that they are \"tricky and deceitful,\r\ndisposed to thieve when they get the chance, mendacious, and incurable\r\ngamblers[468].\"\r\n\r\nYet they have one redeeming quality, an intense love of personal\r\nfreedom, strangely contrasting with the almost abject slavish spirit of\r\nthe Siamese. The feeling extends to all classes, so that servitude is\r\nheld in abhorrence, and, as in Burma, a democratic sense of equality\r\npermeates the social system[469]. Hence, although the State has always\r\nbeen an absolute monarchy, each separate commune constitutes a veritable\r\nlittle oligarchic commonwealth. This has come as a great surprise to the\r\npresent French administrators of the country, who frankly declare that\r\nthey cannot hope to improve the social or political position of the\r\npeople by substituting European for native laws and usages. The Annamese\r\nhave in fact little to learn from western social institutions.\r\n\r\nTheir language, spoken everywhere with remarkable uniformity, is of the\r\nnormal Indo-Chinese isolating type, possessing six tones, three high,\r\nand three low, and written in ideographic characters based on the\r\nChinese, but with numerous modifications and additions. But, although\r\nthese are ill-suited for the purpose, the attempt made by the early\r\nPortuguese missionaries to substitute the so-called _quoc-ngu_, or Roman\r\nphonetic system, has been defeated by the conservative spirit of the\r\npeople. Primary instruction has long been widely diffused, and almost\r\neverybody can read and write as many of the numerous hieroglyphs as are\r\nneeded for the ordinary purpose of daily intercourse. Every village has\r\nits free school, and a higher range of studies is encouraged by the\r\npublic examinations to which, as in China, all candidates for government\r\nappointments are subjected. Under such a scheme surprising results might\r\nbe achieved, were the course of studies not based exclusively on the\r\nempty formulas of Chinese classical literature. The subjects taught are\r\nfor the most part puerile, and true science is replaced by the dry moral\r\nprecepts of Confucius. One result amongst the educated classes is a\r\nscoffing, sceptical spirit, free from all religious prejudice, and\r\nunhampered by theological creeds or dogmas, combined with a lofty moral\r\ntone, not always however in harmony with daily conduct.\r\n\r\nEven more than in China, the family is the true base of the social\r\nsystem, the head of the household being not only the high-priest of the\r\nancestral cult, but also a kind of patriarch enjoying almost absolute\r\ncontrol over his children. In this respect the relations are somewhat\r\none-sided, the father having no recognised obligations towards his\r\noffspring, while these are expected to show him perfect obedience in\r\nlife and veneration after death. Besides this worship of ancestry and\r\nthe Confucian ethical philosophy, a national form of Buddhism is\r\nprevalent. Some even profess all three of these so-called \"religions,\"\r\nbeneath which there still survive many of the primitive superstitions\r\nassociated with a not yet extinct belief in spirits and the supernatural\r\npower of magicians. While the Buddhist temples are neglected and the few\r\nbonzes[470] despised, offerings are still made to the genii of\r\nagriculture, of the waters, the tiger, the dolphin, peace, war,\r\ndiseases, and so forth, whose rude statues in the form of dragons or\r\nother fabulous monsters are even set up in the pagodas. Since the early\r\npart of the seventeenth century Roman Catholic missionaries have\r\nlaboured with considerable success in this unpromising field, where the\r\ncongregations were estimated in 1898 at about 900,000.\r\n\r\nFrom Annam the ethnical transition is easy to China[471] and its teeming\r\nmultitudes, regarding whose origins, racial and cultural, two opposite\r\nviews at present hold the field. What may be called the old, but by no\r\nmeans the obsolete school, regards the Chinese populations as the direct\r\ndescendants of the aborigines who during the Stone Ages entered the\r\nHoang-ho valley probably from the Tibetan plateau, there developed their\r\npeculiar culture independently of foreign influences, and thence spread\r\ngradually southwards to the whole of China proper, extirpating,\r\nabsorbing, or driving to the encircling western and southern uplands the\r\nruder aborigines of the Yang-tse-Kiang and Si-Kiang basins.\r\n\r\nIn direct opposition to this view the new school, championed especially\r\nby T. de Lacouperie[472], holds that the present inhabitants of China\r\nare late intruders from south-western Asia, and that they arrived not as\r\nrude aborigines, but as a cultured people with a considerable knowledge\r\nof letters, science, and the arts, all of which they acquired either\r\ndirectly or indirectly from the civilised Akkado-Sumerian inhabitants of\r\nBabylonia.\r\n\r\nNot merely analogies and resemblances, but what are called actual\r\nidentities, are pointed out between the two cultures, and even between\r\nthe two languages, sufficient to establish a common origin of both,\r\nMesopotamia being the fountain-head, whence the stream flowed by\r\nchannels not clearly defined to the Hoang-ho valley. Thus the Chin.\r\n_yu_, originally _go_, is equated with Akkad _gu_, to speak; _ye_ with\r\n_ge_, night, and so on. Then the astronomic and chronologic systems are\r\ncompared, Berossus and the cuneiform tablets dividing the prehistoric\r\nAkkad epoch into 10 periods of 10 kings, lasting 120 Sari, or 432,000\r\nyears, while the corresponding Chinese astronomic myth also comprises 10\r\nkings (or dynasties) covering the same period of 432,000 years. The\r\nastronomic system credited to the emperor Yao (2000 B.C.) similarly\r\ncorresponds with the Akkadian, both having the same five planets with\r\nnames of like meaning, and a year of 12 months and 30 days, with the\r\nsame cycle of intercalated days, while several of the now obsolete names\r\nof the Chinese months answer to those of the Babylonians. Even the name\r\nof the first Chinese emperor who built an observatory, Nai-Kwang-ti,\r\nsomewhat resembles that of the Elamite king, Kuder-na-hangti, who\r\nconquered Chaldaea about 2280 B.C.\r\n\r\nAll this can hardly be explained away as a mere series of coincidences;\r\nnevertheless neither Sinologues nor Akkadists are quite convinced, and\r\nit is obvious that many of the resemblances may be due to trade or\r\nintercourse both by the old overland caravan routes, and by the seaborne\r\ntraffic from Eridu at the head of the Persian Gulf, which was a\r\nflourishing emporium 4000 or 5000 years ago.\r\n\r\nBut, despite some verbal analogies, an almost insurmountable difficulty\r\nis presented by the Akkadian and Chinese languages, which no\r\nphilological ingenuity can bring into such relation as is required by\r\nthe hypothesis. T. G. Pinches has shown that at a very early period, say\r\nsome 5000 years ago, Akkadian already consisted, \"for the greater part,\r\nof words of one syllable,\" and was \"greatly affected by phonetic decay,\r\nthe result being that an enormous number of homophones were developed\r\nout of roots originally quite distinct[473].\" This Akkadian scholar\r\nsends me a number of instances, such as _tu_ for _tura_, to enter; _ti_\r\nfor _tila_, to live; _du_ for _dumu_, son; _du_ for _dugu_, good, as in\r\n_Eridu_, for _Gurudugu_, \"the good city,\" adding that \"the list could be\r\nextended indefinitely[474].\" But de Lacouperie's Bak tribes, that is,\r\nthe first immigrants from south-west Asia, are not supposed to have\r\nreached North China till about 2500 or 3000 B.C., at which time the\r\nChinese language was still in the untoned agglutinating state, with but\r\nfew monosyllabic homophones, and consequently quite distinct from the\r\nAkkadian, as known to us from the Assyrian syllabaries, bilingual lists,\r\nand earlier tablets from Nippur or Lagash.\r\n\r\nHence the linguistic argument seems to fail completely, while the\r\nBabylonian origin of the Chinese writing system, or rather, the\r\nderivation of Chinese and Sumerian from some common parent in Central\r\nAsia, awaits further evidence. Many of the Chinese and Akkadian \"line\r\nforms\" collated by C. J. Ball[475] are so simple and, one might say,\r\nobvious, that they seem to prove nothing. They may be compared with such\r\ninfantile utterances as _pa_, _ma_, _da_, _ta_, occurring in half the\r\nlanguages of the world, without proving a connection or affinity between\r\nany of them. But even were the common origin of the two scripts\r\nestablished, it would prove nothing as to the common origin of the two\r\npeoples, but only show cultural influences, which need not be denied.\r\n\r\nBut if Chinese origins cannot be clearly traced back to Babylonia,\r\nChinese culture may still, in a sense, claim to be the oldest in the\r\nworld, inasmuch as it has persisted with little change from its rise\r\nsome 4500 years ago down to present times. All other early\r\ncivilisations--Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Assyrian, Persian,\r\nHellenic--have perished, or live only in their monuments, traditions,\r\noral or written records. But the Chinese, despite repeated political and\r\nsocial convulsions, is still as deeply rooted in the past as ever,\r\nshowing no break of continuity from the dim echoes of remote prehistoric\r\nages down to the last revolution, and the establishment of the Republic.\r\nThese things touch the surface only of the great ocean of Chinese\r\nhumanity, which is held together, not by any general spirit of national\r\nsentiment (all sentiment is alien from the Chinese temperament), nor by\r\nany community of speech, for many of the provincial dialects differ\r\nprofoundly from each other, but by a prodigious power of inertia, which\r\nhas hitherto resisted all attempts at change either by pressure from\r\nwithout, or by spontaneous impulse from within.\r\n\r\nWhat they were thousands of years ago, the Chinese still are, a frugal,\r\npeace-loving, hard-working people, occupied mainly with tillage and\r\ntrade, cultivating few arts beyond weaving, porcelain and metal work,\r\nbut with a widely diffused knowledge of letters, and a writing system\r\nwhich still remains at the cumbrous ideographic stage, needing as many\r\ndifferent symbols as there are distinct concepts to be expressed. Yet\r\nthe system has one advantage, enabling those who speak mutually\r\nunintelligible idioms to converse together, using the pencil instead of\r\nthe tongue. For this very reason the attempts made centuries ago by the\r\ngovernment to substitute a phonetic script had to be abandoned. It was\r\nfound that imperial edicts and other documents so written could not be\r\nunderstood by the populations speaking dialects different from the\r\nliterary standard, whereas the hieroglyphs, like our ciphers 1, 2,\r\n3 ..., could be read by all educated persons of whatever allied form of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nOriginally the Chinese system, whether developed on the spot or derived\r\nfrom Akkadian or any other foreign source, was of course pictographic or\r\nideographic, and it is commonly supposed to have remained at that stage\r\never since, the only material changes being of a graphic nature. The\r\npictographs were conventionalised and reduced to their present form, but\r\nstill remained ideograms supplemented by a limited number of phonetic\r\ndeterminants. But de Lacouperie has shown that this view is a mistake,\r\nand that the evolution from the pictograph to the phonetic symbol had\r\nbeen practically completed in China many centuries before the new era.\r\nThe _Ku-wen_ style current before the ninth century B.C. \"was really\r\nthe phonetic expression of speech[476].\" But for the reason stated it\r\nhad to be discontinued, and a return made to the earlier ideographic\r\nstyle. The change was effected about 820 B.C. by She Choeu, minister of\r\nthe Emperor Sueen Wang, who introduced the _Ta-chuen_ style in which \"he\r\ntried to speak to the eye and no longer to the ear,\" that is, he\r\nreverted to the earlier ideographic process, which has since prevailed.\r\nIt was simplified about 227 B.C. (_Siao Chuen_ style), and after some\r\nother modifications the present caligraphic form (_Kiai Shu_) was\r\nintroduced by Wang Hi in 350 A.D. Thus one consequence of the \"Expansion\r\nof China\" was a reversion to barbarism, in respect at least of the\r\nnational graphic system, by which Chinese thought and literature have\r\nbeen hampered for nearly 3000 years.\r\n\r\nWritten records, though at first mainly of a mythical character, date\r\nfrom about 3000 B.C.[477] Reference is made in the early documents to\r\nthe rude and savage times, which in China as elsewhere certainly\r\npreceded the historic period. Three different prehistoric ages are even\r\ndiscriminated, and tradition relates how Fu-hi introduced wooden,\r\nThin-ming stone, and Shi-yu metal implements[478]. Later, when their\r\norigin and use were forgotten, the jade axes, like those from Yunnan,\r\nwere looked on as bolts hurled to the earth by the god of thunder, while\r\nthe arrow-heads, supposed to be also of divine origin, were endowed in\r\nthe popular fancy with special virtues and even regarded as emblems of\r\nsovereignty. Thus may perhaps be explained the curious fact that in\r\nearly times, before the twelfth century B.C., tribute in flint weapons\r\nwas paid to the imperial government by some of the reduced wild tribes\r\nof the western uplands.\r\n\r\nThese men of the Stone and Metal Ages are no doubt still largely\r\nrepresented, not only amongst the rude hill tribes of the southern and\r\nwestern borderlands, but also amongst the settled and cultured\r\nlowlanders of the great fluvial valleys. The \"Hundred Families,\" as the\r\nfirst immigrants called themselves, came traditionally from the\r\nnorth-western regions beyond the Hoang-ho. According to the Yu-kung\r\ntheir original home lay in the south-western part of Eastern Turkestan,\r\nwhence they first migrated east to the oases north of the Nan-Shan\r\nrange, and then, in the fourth millennium before the new era, to the\r\nfertile valleys of the Hoang-ho and its Hoei-ho tributary. Thence they\r\nspread slowly along the other great river valleys, partly expelling,\r\npartly intermingling with the aborigines, but so late as the seventh\r\ncentury B.C. were still mainly confined to the region between the Pei-ho\r\nand the lower Yang-tse-Kiang. Even here several indigenous groups, such\r\nas the Hoei, whose name survives in that of the Hoei river, and the Lai\r\nof the Shantong Peninsula, long held their ground, but all were\r\nultimately absorbed or assimilated throughout the northern lands as far\r\nsouth as the left bank of the Yang-tse-Kiang.\r\n\r\nBeyond this river many were also merged in the dominant people\r\ncontinually advancing southwards; but others, collectively or vaguely\r\nknown as Si-fans, Mans, Miao-tse, Pai, Tho, Y-jen[479], Lolo, etc., were\r\ndriven to the south-western highlands which they still occupy. Even some\r\nof the populations in the settled districts, such as the _Hok-los_[480],\r\nand _Hakkas_[481], of Kwang-tung, and the _Pun-ti_[482] of the Canton\r\ndistrict, are scarcely yet thoroughly assimilated. They differ greatly\r\nin temperament, usages, appearance, and speech from the typical Chinese\r\nof the Central and Northern provinces, whom in fact they look upon as\r\n\"foreigners,\" and with whom they hold intercourse through \"Pidgin\r\nEnglish[483],\" the _lingua franca_ of the Chinese seaboard[484].\r\n\r\nNevertheless a general homogeneous character is imparted to the whole\r\npeople by their common political, social, and religious institutions,\r\nand by that principle of convergence in virtue of which different\r\nethnical groups, thrown together in the same area and brought under a\r\nsingle administration, tend to merge in a uniform new national type.\r\nThis general uniformity is conspicuous especially in the religious ideas\r\nwhich, except in the sceptical lettered circles, everywhere underlie the\r\nthree recognised national religions, or \"State Churches,\" as they might\r\nalmost be called: _ju-kiao_, Confucianism; _tao-kiao_, Taoism; and\r\n_fo-kiao_, Buddhism (Fo = Buddha). The first, confined mainly to the\r\neducated upper classes, is not so much a religion as a philosophic\r\nsystem, a frigid ethical code based on the moral and matter-of-fact\r\nteachings of Confucius[485]. Confucius was essentially a social and\r\npolitical reformer, who taught by example and precept; the main\r\ninducement to virtue being, not rewards or penalties in the after-life,\r\nbut well- or ill-being in the present. His system is summed up in the\r\nexpression \"worldly wisdom,\" as embodied in such popular sayings as: A\r\nfriend is hardly made in a year, but unmade in a moment; When safe\r\nremember danger, in peace forget not war; Filial father, filial son,\r\nunfilial father, unfilial son; In washing up, plates and dishes may get\r\nbroken; Don't do what you would not have known; Thatch your roof before\r\nthe rain, dig the well before you thirst; The gambler's success is his\r\nruin; Money goes to the gambling den as the criminal to execution (never\r\nreturns); Money hides many faults; Stop the hand, stop the mouth (stop\r\nwork and starve); To open a shop is easy, to keep it open hard; Win your\r\nlawsuit and lose your money.\r\n\r\nAlthough he instituted no religious system, Confucius nevertheless\r\nenjoined the observance of the already existing forms of worship, and\r\nafter death became himself the object of a widespread cult, which still\r\npersists. \"In every city there is a temple, built at the public expense,\r\ncontaining either a statue of the philosopher, or a tablet inscribed\r\nwith his titles. Every spring and autumn worship is paid to him in these\r\ntemples by the chief official personages of the city. In the schools\r\nalso, on the first and fifteenth of each month, his title being written\r\non red paper and affixed to a tablet, worship is performed in a special\r\nroom by burning incense and candles, and by prostrations[486].\"\r\n\r\nTaoism, a sort of pantheistic mysticism, called by its founder, Lao-tse\r\n(600 B.C.), the _Tao_, or \"way of salvation,\" was embodied in the\r\nformula \"matter and the visible world are merely manifestations of a\r\nsublime, eternal, incomprehensible principle.\" It taught, in\r\nanticipation of Sakya-Muni, that by controlling his passions man may\r\nescape or cut short an endless series of transmigrations, and thus\r\narrive by the Tao at everlasting bliss--sleep? unconscious rest or\r\nabsorption in the eternal essence? Nirvana? It is impossible to tell\r\nfrom the lofty but absolutely unintelligible language in which the\r\nmaster's teachings are wrapped.\r\n\r\nBut it matters little, because his disciples have long forgotten the\r\nprinciples they never understood, and Taoism has almost everywhere been\r\ntransformed to a system of magic associated with the never-dying\r\nprimeval superstitions. Originally there was no hierarchy of priests,\r\nthe only specially religious class being the Ascetics, who passed their\r\nlives absorbed in the contemplation of the eternal verities. But out of\r\nthis class, drawn together by their common interests, was developed a\r\nkind of monasticism, with an organised brotherhood of astrologers,\r\nmagicians, Shamanists, somnambulists, \"mediums,\" \"thought-readers,\"\r\ncharlatans and impostors of all sorts, sheltered under a threadbare garb\r\nof religion.\r\n\r\nBuddhism also, although of foreign origin, has completely conformed to\r\nthe national spirit, and is now a curious blend of Hindu metaphysics\r\nwith the primitive Chinese belief in spirits and a deified ancestry. In\r\nevery district are practised diverse forms of worship between which no\r\nclear dividing line can be drawn, and, as in Annam, the same persons may\r\nbe at once followers of Confucius, Lao-tse, and Buddha. In fact such was\r\nthe position of the Emperor, who belonged _ex officio_ to all three of\r\nthese State religions, and scrupulously took part in their various\r\nobservances. There is even some truth in the Chinese view that \"all\r\nthree make but one religion,\" the first appealing to man's moral nature,\r\nthe second to the instinct of self-preservation, the third to the higher\r\nsphere of thought and contemplation.\r\n\r\nBut behind, one might say above it all, the old animism still prevails,\r\nmanifested in a multitude of superstitious practices, whose purport is\r\nto appease the evil and secure the favour of the good spirits, the\r\n_Feng-shui_ or _Fung-shui_, \"air and water\" genii, who have to be\r\nreckoned with in all the weightiest as well as the most trivial\r\noccurrences of daily life. These with the ghosts of their ancestors, by\r\nwhom the whole land is haunted, are the bane of the Chinaman's\r\nexistence. Everything depends on maintaining a perfect balance between\r\nthe Fung-shui, that is, the two principles represented by the \"White\r\nTiger\" and the \"Azure Dragon,\" who guard the approaches of every\r\ndwelling, and whose opposing influences have to be nicely adjusted by\r\nthe well-paid professors of the magic arts. At the death of the emperor\r\nTung Chih (1875) a great difficulty was raised by the State astrologers,\r\nwho found that the realm would be endangered if he were buried,\r\naccording to rule, in the imperial cemetery 100 miles west of Pekin, as\r\nhis father reposed in the other imperial cemetery situated the same\r\ndistance east of the capital. For some subtle reason the balance would\r\nhave been disturbed between Tiger and Dragon, and it took nine months to\r\nsettle the point, during which, as reported by the American Legation,\r\nthe whole empire was stirred, councils of State agitated, and L50,000\r\nexpended to decide where the remains of a worthless and vicious young\r\nman should be interred.\r\n\r\nOwing to the necessary disturbance of the ancestral burial places, much\r\ntrouble has been anticipated in the construction of the railways, for\r\nwhich concessions have now been granted to European syndicates. But an\r\nEnglishman long resident in the country has declared that there will be\r\nno resistance on the part of the people. \"The dead can be removed with\r\ndue regard to Fung Shui; a few dollars will make that all right.\" This\r\nis fully in accordance with the thrifty character of the Chinese, which\r\noverrides all other considerations, as expressed in the popular saying:\r\n\"With money you may move the gods; without it you cannot move men.\" But\r\nthe gods may even be moved without money, or at least with spurious\r\npaper money, for it is a fixed belief of their votaries that, like\r\nmortals, they may be outwitted by such devices. When rallied for burning\r\nflash notes at a popular shrine, since no spirit-bank would cash them, a\r\nChinaman retorted: \"Why me burn good note? Joss no can savvy.\" In a\r\nsimilar spirit the god of war is hoodwinked by wooden boards hung on the\r\nramparts of Pekin and painted to look like heavy ordnance.\r\n\r\nIn fact appearance, outward show, observance of the \"eleventh\r\ncommandment,\" in a word \"face\" as it is called, is everything in China.\r\n\"To understand, however imperfectly, what is meant by 'face,' we must\r\ntake account of the fact that as a race the Chinese have a strong\r\ndramatic instinct. Upon very slight provocation any Chinese regards\r\nhimself in the light of an actor in a drama. A Chinese thinks in\r\ntheatrical terms. If his troubles are adjusted he speaks of himself as\r\nhaving 'got off the stage' with credit, and if they are not adjusted he\r\nfinds no way to 'retire from the stage.' The question is never of facts,\r\nbut always of form. Once rightly apprehended, 'face' will be found to be\r\nin itself a key to the combination-lock of many of the most important\r\ncharacteristics of the Chinese[487].\"\r\n\r\nOf foreign religions Islam, next to Buddhism, has made most progress.\r\nIntroduced by the early Arab and Persian traders, and zealously preached\r\nthroughout the Jagatai empire in the twelfth century, it has secured a\r\nfirm footing especially in Kan-su, Shen-si, and Yunnan, and is of course\r\ndominant in Eastern (Chinese) Turkestan. Despite the wholesale\r\nbutcheries that followed the repeated insurrections between 1855 and\r\n1877, the _Hoei-Hoei_, _Panthays_, or _Dungans_, as the Muhammadans are\r\nvariously called, were still estimated, in 1898, at about 22,000,000 in\r\nthe whole empire.\r\n\r\nIslam was preceded by Christianity, which, as attested by the authentic\r\ninscription of Si-ngan-fu, penetrated into the western provinces under\r\nthe form of Nestorianism about the seventh century. The famous Roman\r\nCatholic missions with headquarters at Pekin date from the close of the\r\nsixteenth century, and despite internal dissensions have had a fair\r\nmeasure of success, the congregations comprising altogether over one\r\nmillion members. Protestant missions date from 1807 (London Missionary\r\nSociety) and in 1910 claimed over 200,000 church members and baptized\r\nChristians, the total having more than doubled since 1900[488].\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned dissensions arose out of the practices associated\r\nwith ancestry worship, offerings of flowers, fruits and so forth, which\r\nthe Jesuits regarded merely as proofs of filial devotion, but were\r\ndenounced by the Dominicans as acts of idolatry. After many years of\r\nidle controversy, the question was at last decided against the Jesuits\r\nby Clement XI in the famous Bull, _Ex illa die_ (1715), and since then,\r\nneophytes having to renounce the national cult of their forefathers,\r\nconversions have mainly been confined to the lower classes, too humble\r\nto boast of any family tree, or too poor to commemorate the dead by\r\never-recurring costly sepulchral rites.\r\n\r\nIn China there are no hereditary nobles, indeed no nobles at all, unless\r\nit be the rather numerous descendants of Confucius who dwell together\r\nand enjoy certain social privileges, in this somewhat resembling the\r\n_Shorfa_ (descendants of the Prophet) in Muhammadan lands. If any titles\r\nhave to be awarded for great deeds they fall, not on the hero, but on\r\nhis forefathers, and thus at a stroke of the vermilion pencil are\r\nennobled countless past generations, while the last of the line remains\r\nunhonoured until he goes over to the majority. Between the Emperor,\r\n\"patriarch of his people,\" and the people themselves, however, there\r\nstood an aristocracy of talent, or at least of Chinese scholarship, the\r\ngoverning Mandarin[489] class, which was open to the highest and the\r\nlowest alike. All nominations to office were conferred exclusively on\r\nthe successful competitors at the public examinations, so that, like the\r\nFrench conscript with the hypothetical Marshal's baton in his knapsack,\r\nevery Chinese citizen carried the buttoned cap of official rank in his\r\ncapacious sleeve. Of these there are nine grades, indicated respectively\r\nin descending order by the ruby, red coral, sapphire, opaque blue,\r\ncrystal, white shell, gold (two), and silver button, or rather little\r\nglobe, on the cap of office, with which correspond the nine\r\nbirds--manchu crane, golden pheasant, peacock, wild goose, silver\r\npheasant, egret, mandarin duck, quail, and jay--embroidered on the\r\nbreast and back of the State robe.\r\n\r\nTheoretically the system is admirable, and at all events is better than\r\nappointments by Court favour. But in practice it was vitiated, first by\r\nthe narrow, antiquated course of studies in the dry Chinese classics,\r\ncalculated to produce pedants rather than statesmen, and secondly by the\r\nmonopoly of preference which it conferred on a lettered caste to the\r\nexclusion of men of action, vigour, and enterprise. Moreover,\r\nappointments being made for life, barring crime or blunder, the\r\nMandarins, as long as they approved themselves zealous supporters of the\r\nreigning dynasty, enjoyed a free hand in amassing wealth by plunder, and\r\nthe wealth thus acquired was used to purchase further promotion and\r\nadvancement, rather than to improve the welfare of the people.\r\n\r\nThey have the reputation of being a courteous people, as punctilious as\r\nthe Malays themselves; and they are so amongst each other. But their\r\nattitude towards strangers is the embodiment of aggressive\r\nself-righteousness, a complacent feeling of superiority which nothing\r\ncan disturb. Even the upper classes, with all their efforts to be at\r\nleast polite, often betray the feeling in a subdued arrogance which is\r\nnot always to be distinguished from vulgar insolence. \"After the\r\ncourteous, kindly Japanese, the Chinese seem indifferent, rough, and\r\ndisagreeable, except the well-to-do merchants in the shops, who are\r\nbland, complacent, and courteous. Their rude stare, and the way they\r\nhustle you in the streets and shout their 'pidjun' English at you is not\r\nattractive[490].\" But the stare, the hustling and the shouting may not\r\nbe due to incivility. No doubt the Chinaman regards the foreigner as a\r\n\"devil\" but he has reason, and he never ceases to be astonished at\r\nforeign manners and customs \"extremely ferocious and almost entirely\r\nuncivilised[491].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[375] _Ethnology_, p. 300.\r\n\r\n[376] _Geogr.

It is curious to note that the Mongol Tangutu is\r\nbalanced by the Tibetan _Sok-pa_, often applied to all Mongolians.\r\n\r\n[386] _Notes on the Ethnology of Tibet_, 1895, p. 675; see also S.\r\nChandra Das, _Journey to Lhasa and Central Tibet_, 1904; F.

These are all affiliated by Desgodins\r\nto the Lho-pa of Bhutan (_Bul. Soc. Geogr._, October, 1877, p. 431), and\r\nare to be distinguished from the _Bori_ (_i.e._ \"dependent\") tribes of\r\nthe plains, all more or less Hinduized Bhotiyas (Dalton, _Ethnology of\r\nBengal_, p. 22 sq.).

Under the heading Tibeto-Burman Languages Sten Konow\r\nrecognises _Tibetan_, _Himalayan_, _North Assam_, _Bodo_, _Naga_,\r\n_Kuki-Chin_, _Meitei_ and _Kachin_. The Naga group comprises dialects of\r\nvery different kinds; some approach Tibetan and the North Assam group,\r\nothers lead over to the Bodo, others connect with Tibeto-Burman. Meitei\r\nlies midway between Kuki-Chin and Kachin, and these merge finally in\r\nBurmese. Grierson's _Linguistic Survey of India_, Vol. III. 1903-6.\r\n\r\n[406] Almost hopeless confusion continues to prevail in the tribal\r\nnomenclature of these multitudinous hill peoples. The official sanction\r\ngiven to the terms _Kuki_ and _Lushai_ as collective names may be\r\nregretted, but seems now past remedy. _Kuki_ is unknown to the people\r\nthemselves, while _Lushai_ is only the name of a single group proud of\r\ntheir head-hunting proclivities, hence they call themselves, or perhaps\r\nare called _Lu-Shai_, \"Head-Cutters,\" from _lu_ head, _sha_ to cut (G.\r\nH. Damant). Other explanations suggested by C. A. Soppitt (_Kuki-Lushai\r\nTribes, with an Outline Grammar of the Rangkhol-Lushai Language_,\r\nShillong, 1887) cannot be accepted.\r\n\r\n[407] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n[408] See G. A.

This observer notes that many of the Ngiou\r\nhave been largely assimilated in type to the Burmese and in one place\r\ngoes so far as to assert that \"the Ngiou are decidedly of the same race\r\nas the Burmese. I have had opportunities of seeing hundreds of both\r\ncountries, and of closely watching their features and build. The Ngiou\r\nwear the hair in a topknot in the same way as the Burmese, but they are\r\neasily distinguished by their tattooing, which is much more elaborate\"\r\n(_Temples and Elephants_, 1884, p. 297). Of course all spring from one\r\nprimeval stock, but they now constitute distinct ethnical groups, and,\r\nexcept about the borderlands, where blends may be suspected, both the\r\nphysical and mental characters differ considerably. Bock's _Ngiou_ is no\r\ndoubt the same name as _Ngnio_, which H. S. Hallett applies in one place\r\nto the Mosse Shans north of Zimme, and elsewhere to the Burmese Shans\r\ncollectively (_A Thousand Miles on an Elephant_, 1890, pp. 158 and 358).\r\n\r\n[440] \"Les Pai ne sont autres que des Laotiens\" (Prince Henri, p. 42).\r\n\r\n[441] One Shan group, the Deodhaings, still persist, and occupy a few\r\nvillages near Sibsagar (S. E. Peal, _Nature_, June 19, 1884, p. 169).\r\nDalton also mentions the _Kamjangs_, a Khamti (Tai) tribe in the Sadiya\r\ndistrict, Assam (_Ethnology of Bengal_, p. 6).\r\n\r\n[442] Much unexpected light has been thrown upon the early history of\r\nthese Ahoms by E. Gait, who has discovered and described in the _Journ.\r\nAs. Soc. Bengal_, 1894, a large number of _puthis_, or MSS. (28 in the\r\nSibsagar district alone), in the now almost extinct Ahom language, some\r\nof which give a continuous history of the Ahom rajas from 568 to 1795\r\nA.D.

Colborne\r\nBaber from a Lolo chief, forwarded to Europe in 1881, and described by\r\nde Lacouperie, _Journ. R. As. Soc._ Vol. XIV. Part I. \"The writing runs\r\nin lines from top to bottom and from left to right, as in Chinese\" (p.\r\n1), and this authority regards it as the link that was wanting to\r\nconnect the various members of a widely diffused family radiating from\r\nIndia (Harapa seal, Indo-Pali, Vatteluttu) to Malaysia (Batta, Rejang,\r\nLampong, Bugis, Makassar, Tagal), to Indo-China (Lao, Siamese, Lolo),\r\nKorea and Japan, and also including the Siao-chuen Chinese system \"in\r\nuse a few centuries B.C.\" (p. 5).

Soc. Geogr._ XII. p. 410). In 1877\r\nCapt. W. Gill visited a large nation of _Man-tse_ with 18 tribal\r\ndivisions, reaching from West Yunnan to the extreme north of Sechuen, a\r\nsort of federacy recognising a king, with Chinese habits and dress, but\r\nspeaking a language resembling Sanskrit (?). These were the _Sumu_, or\r\n\"White Man-tse,\" apparently the same as those visited in 1896 by Mrs\r\nBishop, and by her described as semi-independent, ruled by their own\r\nchiefs, and in appearance \"quite Caucasian, both men and women being\r\nvery handsome,\" strict Buddhists, friendly and hospitable, and living in\r\nlarge stone houses (Letter to _Times_, Aug. 18, 1896).\r\n\r\n[457] \"Des paysannes nongs dont les cheveux etaient blonds, quelquefois\r\nmeme roux.\" _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n[458] _L'Anthropologie_, 1896, p. 602 sq.\r\n\r\n[459] \"On the Relations of the Indo-Chinese and Inter-Oceanic Races and\r\nLanguages.\" Paper read at the Meeting of the Brit. Association,\r\nSheffield, 1879, and printed in the _Journ. Anthr. Inst._, February,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\n[460] In the Javanese annals the invaders are called \"Cambojans,\" but at\r\nthis time (about 1340) Camboja had already been reduced, and the Siamese\r\nconquerors had brought back from its renowned capital, Angkor Wat, over\r\n90,000 captives. These were largely employed in the wars of the period,\r\nwhich were thus attributed to Camboja instead of to Siam by foreign\r\npeoples ignorant of the changed relations in Indo-China.\r\n\r\n[461] How very dark some of these corners can be may be seen from the\r\nsad picture of maladministration, vice, and corruption still prevalent\r\nso late as 1890, given by Hallett in _A Thousand Miles on an Elephant_,\r\nCh. xxxv.; and even still later by H. Warington Smyth in _Five Years in\r\nSiam, from 1891 to 1896_ (1898). This observer credits the Siamese with\r\nan undeveloped sense of right and wrong, so that they are good only by\r\naccident. \"To do a thing because it is right is beyond them; to abstain\r\nfrom a thing because it is against their good name, or involves serious\r\nconsequences, is possibly within the power of a few; the question of\r\nright and wrong does not enter the calculation.\" But he thinks they may\r\npossess a high degree of intelligence, and mentions the case of a\r\npeasant, who from an atlas had taught himself geography and politics. P.\r\nA. Thompson, _Lotus Land_, 1906, gives an account of the country and\r\npeople of Southern Siam.\r\n\r\n[462] Probably a corruption of _talapat_, the name of the palm-tree\r\nwhich yields the fan-leaf constantly used by the monks.\r\n\r\n[463] \"In conversation with the monks M'Gilvary was told that it would\r\nmost likely be countless ages before they would attain the much wished\r\nfor state of Nirvana, and that one transgression at any time might\r\nrelegate them to the lowest hell to begin again their melancholy\r\npilgrimage\" (Hallett, _A Thousand Miles on an Elephant_, p. 337).\r\n\r\n[464] \"Le gros orteil est tres developpe et ecarte des autres doigts du\r\npied.

See also a note on the subject by C. F. Tremlett in\r\n_Journ. Anthr.

The most common\r\nnational name is Chung-kue, \"middle kingdom\" (presumably the centre of\r\nthe universe), whence Chung-kue-Jin, the Chinese people. Some have\r\nreferred _China_ to the _Chin_ (_Tsin_) dynasty (909 B.C.), while Marco\r\nPolo's _Kataia_ (Russian _Kitai_) is the _Khata_ (North China) of the\r\nMongol period, from the Manchu _K'i-tan_, founders of the Liao dynasty,\r\nwhich was overthrown 1115 A.D. by the Nue-Ch[)a]n Tatars. Ptolemy's\r\n_Thinae_ is rightly regarded by Edkins as the same word as _Sinae_, the\r\nsubstitution of t for s being normal in Annam, whence this form may have\r\nreached the west through the southern seaport of Kattigara.\r\n\r\n[472] _Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization, from 2300 B.C.\r\nto 200 A.D., or Chapters on the Elements Derived from the Old\r\nCivilizations of West Asia in the Formation of the Ancient Chinese\r\nCulture_, London, 1894.\r\n\r\n[473] \"Observations upon the Languages of the Early Inhabitants of\r\nMesopotamia,\" in _Journ.

Ball, _Chinese and Sumerian_, 1913.\r\n\r\n[476] _History of the Archaic Chinese Writing and Texts_, 1882, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[477] The first actual date given is that of Tai Hao (Fu-hi), 2953 B.C.,\r\nbut this ruler belongs to the fabulous period, and is stated to have\r\nreigned 115 years. The first certain date would appear to be that of\r\nYau, first of the Chinese sages and reformer of the calendar (2357\r\nB.C.). The date 2254 B.C. for Confucius's model king Shun seems also\r\nestablished. But of course all this is modern history compared with the\r\nnow determined Babylonian and Egyptian records.\r\n\r\n[478] Amongst the metals reference is made to iron so early as the time\r\nof the Emperor Ta Yue (2200 B.C.), when it is mentioned as an article of\r\ntribute in the _Shu-King_. F. Hirth, who states this fact, adds that\r\nduring the same period, if not even earlier, iron was already a\r\nflourishing industry in the Liang district (Paper on the \"History of\r\nChinese Culture,\" Munich Anthropological Society, April, 1898). At the\r\ndiscussion which followed the reading of this paper Montelius argued\r\nthat iron was unknown in Western Asia and Egypt before 1500 B.C.,\r\nalthough the point was contested by Hommel, who quoted a word for iron\r\nin the earliest Egyptian texts. Montelius, however, explained that terms\r\noriginally meaning \"ore\" or \"metal\" were afterwards used for \"iron.\"\r\nSuch was certainly the case with the Gk. [Greek: chalkos], at first\r\n\"copper,\" then metal in general, and used still later for [Greek:\r\nsideros], \"iron\"; hence [Greek: chalkeus] = coppersmith, blacksmith, and\r\neven goldsmith. So also with the Lat. _aes_ (Sanskrit _ayas_, akin to\r\n_aurora_, with simple idea of brightness), used first especially for\r\ncopper (_aes cyprium, cuprum_), and then for _bronze_ (Lewis and Short).\r\nFor Hirth's later views see his _Ancient History of China_, 1908 (from\r\nthe fabulous ages to 221 B.C.).\r\n\r\n[479] This term _Y-jen_ (_Yi-jen_), meaning much the same as _Man_,\r\n_Man-tse_, savage, rude, untameable, has acquired a sort of diplomatic\r\ndistinction.

Even here they have mingled in\r\nmany places with other populations, forming fresh ethnical groups, in\r\nwhich the Mongol element is not always conspicuous. Such fusions have\r\ntaken place with the Negrito aborigines in the Malay Peninsula and the\r\nPhilippines; with Papuans in Micronesia, Flores, and other islands east\r\nof Lombok; with dolichocephalic Indonesians in Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes,\r\nHalmahera (Jilolo), parts of the Philippines[492], and perhaps also\r\nTimor and Ceram; and with African negroes (Bantu) in Madagascar. To\r\nunravel some of these racial entanglements is one of the most difficult\r\ntasks in anthropology, and in the absence of detailed information cannot\r\nyet be everywhere attempted with any prospect of success.\r\n\r\nThe problem has been greatly, though perhaps inevitably complicated by\r\nthe indiscriminate extension of the term \"Malay\" to all these and even\r\nto other mixed Oceanic populations farther east, as, for instance, in\r\nthe expression \"Malayo-Polynesian,\" applied by many writers not only in\r\na linguistic, but also in an ethnical sense, to most of the insular\r\npeoples from Madagascar to Easter Island, and from Hawaii to New\r\nZealand. It is now of course too late to hope to remedy this misuse of\r\nterms by proposing a fresh nomenclature. But much of the consequent\r\nconfusion will be avoided by restricting _Malayo-Polynesian_[493]\r\naltogether to linguistic matters, and carefully distinguishing between\r\n_Indonesian_, the pre-Malay dolichocephalic element in Oceania[494],\r\n_Malayan_ or _Proto-Malayan_, collective name of all the Oceanic\r\nMongols, who are brachycephals, and _Malay_, a particular branch of the\r\nMalayan family, as fully explained in _Ethnology_, pp. 326-30[495].\r\n\r\nThe essential point to remember is that the true Malays--who call\r\nthemselves _Orang-Malayu_, speak the standard but quite modern Malay\r\nlanguage, and are all Muhammadans--are a historical people who appear on\r\nthe scene in relatively recent times, ages after the insular world had\r\nbeen occupied by the Mongol peoples to whom their name has been\r\nextended, but who never call themselves Malays. The Orang-Malayu, who\r\nhave acquired such an astonishing predominance in the Eastern\r\nArchipelago, were originally an obscure tribe who rose to power in the\r\nMenangkabau district, Sumatra, not before the twelfth century, and whose\r\nmigrations date only from about the year 1160 A.D. At this time,\r\naccording to the native records[496], was founded the first foreign\r\nsettlement, Singapore, a pure Sanskrit name meaning the \"Lion City,\"\r\nfrom which it might be inferred that these first settlers were not\r\nMuhammadans, as is commonly assumed, but Brahmans or Buddhists, both\r\nthese forms of Hinduism having been propagated throughout Sumatra and\r\nthe other Sunda Islands centuries before this time. It is also\r\nnoteworthy that the early settlers on the mainland are stated to have\r\nbeen pagans, or to have professed some corrupt form of Hindu idolatry,\r\ntill their conversion to Islam by the renowned Sultan Mahmud Shah about\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century. It is therefore probable enough\r\nthat the earlier movements were carried out under Hindu influences, and\r\nmay have begun long before the historical date 1160. Menangkabau,\r\nhowever, was the first Mussulman State that acquired political supremacy\r\nin Sumatra, and this district thus became the chief centre for the later\r\ndiffusion of the cultured Malays, their language, usages, and religion,\r\nthroughout the Peninsula and the Archipelago. Here they are now found in\r\ncompact masses chiefly in south Sumatra (Menangkabau, Palembang, the\r\nLampongs); in all the insular groups between Sumatra and Borneo; in the\r\nMalay Peninsula as far north as the Kra Isthmus, here intermingling\r\nwith the Siamese as \"Sam-Sams,\" partly Buddhists, partly Muhammadans;\r\nround the coast of Borneo and about the estuaries of that island; in\r\nTidor, Ternate, and the adjacent coast of Jilolo; in the Banda, Sula,\r\nand Sulu groups; in Batavia, Singapore, and all the other large seaports\r\nof the Archipelago. In all these lands beyond Sumatra the Orang-Malayu\r\nare thus seen to be comparatively recent arrivals[497], and in fact\r\nintruders on the other Malayan populations, with whom they collectively\r\nconstitute the Oceanic branch of the Mongol division. Their diffusion\r\nwas everywhere brought about much in the same way as in Ternate, where\r\nA. R. Wallace tells us that the ruling people \"are an intrusive Malay\r\nrace somewhat allied to the Macassar people, who settled in the country\r\nat a very early epoch, drove out the indigenes, who were no doubt the\r\nsame as those of the adjacent island of Gilolo, and established a\r\nmonarchy. They perhaps obtained many of their wives from the natives,\r\nwhich will account for the extraordinary language they speak--in some\r\nrespects closely allied to that of the natives of Gilolo, while it\r\ncontains much that points to a Malayan [Malay] origin. To most of these\r\npeople the Malay language is quite unintelligible[498].\"\r\n\r\nThe Malayan populations, as distinguished from the Malays proper, form\r\nsocially two very distinct classes--the _Orang Benua_, \"Men of the\r\nSoil,\" rude aborigines, numerous especially in the interior of the Malay\r\nPeninsula, Borneo, Celebes, Jilolo, Timor, Ceram, the Philippines,\r\nFormosa, and Madagascar; and the cultured peoples, formerly Hindus but\r\nnow mostly Muhammadans, who have long been constituted in large\r\ncommunities and nationalities with historical records, and flourishing\r\narts and industries. They speak cultivated languages of the Austronesian\r\nfamily, generally much better preserved and of richer grammatical\r\nstructure than the simplified modern speech of the Orang-Malayu. Such\r\nare the Achinese, Rejangs, and Passumahs of Sumatra; the Bugis,\r\nMangkassaras and some Minahasans of Celebes[499]; the Tagalogs and\r\nVisayas of the Philippines; the Sassaks and Balinese of Lombok and Bali\r\n(most of these still Hindus); the Madurese and Javanese proper of Java;\r\nand the Hovas of Madagascar. To call any of these \"Malays[500],\" is like\r\ncalling the Italians \"French,\" or the Germans \"English,\" because of\r\ntheir respective Romance and Teutonic connections.\r\n\r\nPreeminent in many respects amongst all the Malayan peoples are the\r\n_Javanese_--_Sundanese_ in the west, _Javanese proper_ in the centre,\r\n_Madurese_ in the east--who were a highly civilised nation while the\r\nSumatran Malays were still savages, perhaps head-hunters and cannibals\r\nlike the neighbouring Battas. Although now almost exclusively\r\nMuhammadans, they had already adopted some form of Hinduism probably\r\nover 2000 years ago, and under the guidance of their Indian teachers had\r\nrapidly developed a very advanced state of culture. \"Under a completely\r\norganised although despotic government, the arts of peace and war were\r\nbrought to considerable perfection, and the natives of Java became\r\nfamous throughout the East as accomplished musicians and workers in\r\ngold, iron and copper, none of which metals were found in the island\r\nitself. They possessed a regular calendar with astronomical eras, and a\r\nmetrical literature, in which, however, history was inextricably blended\r\nwith romance. Bronze and stone inscriptions in the Kavi, or old Javanese\r\nlanguage, still survive from the eleventh or twelfth century, and to the\r\nsame dates may be referred the vast ruins of Brambanam and the\r\nstupendous temple of Boro-budor in the centre of the island. There are\r\nfew statues of Hindu divinities in this temple, but many are found in\r\nits immediate vicinity, and from the various archaeological objects\r\ncollected in the district it is evident that both the Buddhist and\r\nBrahmanical forms of Hinduism were introduced at an early date.\r\n\r\n\"But all came to an end by the overthrow of the chief Hindu power in\r\n1478, after which event Islam spread rapidly over the whole of Java and\r\nMadura. Brahmanism, however, still holds its ground in Bali and Lombok,\r\nthe last strongholds of Hinduism in the Eastern Archipelago[501].\"\r\n\r\nOn the obscure religious and social relations in these Lesser Sundanese\r\nIslands much light has been thrown by Capt. W. Cool, an English\r\ntranslation of whose work _With the Dutch in the East_ was issued by E.\r\nJ. Taylor in 1897. Here it is shown how Hinduism, formerly dominant\r\nthroughout a great part of Malaysia, gradually yielded in some places to\r\na revival of the never extinct primitive nature-worship, in others to\r\nthe spread of Islam, which in Bali alone failed to gain a footing. In\r\nthis island a curious mingling of Buddhist and Brahmanical forms with\r\nthe primordial heathendom not only persisted, but was strong enough to\r\nacquire the political ascendancy over the Mussulman Sassaks of the\r\nneighbouring island of Lombok. Thus while Islam reigns exclusively in\r\nJava--formerly the chief domain of Hinduism in the Archipelago--Bali,\r\nLombok, and even Sumbawa, present the strange spectacle of large\r\ncommunities professing every form of belief, from the grossest\r\nheathendom to pure monotheism.\r\n\r\nAs I have elsewhere pointed out[502], it is the same with the cultures\r\nand general social conditions, which show an almost unbroken transition\r\nfrom the savagery of Sumbawa to the relative degrees of refinement\r\nreached by the natives of Lombok and especially of Bali. Here, however,\r\nowing to the unfavourable political relations, a retrograde movement is\r\nperceptible in the crumbling temples, grass-grown highways, and\r\nneglected homesteads. But it is everywhere evident enough that \"just as\r\nHinduism has only touched the outer surface of their religion, it has\r\nfailed to penetrate into their social institutions, which, like their\r\ngods, originate from the time when Polynesian heathendom was all\r\npowerful[503].\"\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of the vitality of the early beliefs is\r\npresented by the local traditions, which relate how these foreign gods\r\ninstalled themselves in the Lesser Sundanese Islands after their\r\nexpulsion from Java by the Muhammadans in the fifteenth century. Being\r\ngreatly incensed at the introduction of the Koran, and also anxious to\r\navoid contact with the \"foreign devils,\" the Hindu deities moved\r\neastwards with the intention of setting up their throne in Bali. But\r\nBali already possessed its own gods, the wicked Rakshasas, who fiercely\r\nresented the intrusion, but in the struggle that ensued were\r\nannihilated, all but the still reigning Mraya Dewana. Then the new\r\nthrones had to be erected on heights, as in Java; but at that time there\r\nwere no mountains in Bali, which was a very flat country. So the\r\ndifficulty was overcome by bodily transferring the four hills at the\r\neastern extremity of Java to the neighbouring island. Gunong Agong,\r\nhighest of the four, was set down in the east, and became the Olympus of\r\nBali, while the other three were planted in the west, south, and north,\r\nand assigned to the different gods according to their respective ranks.\r\nThus were at once explained the local theogony and the present physical\r\nfeatures of the island.\r\n\r\nDespite their generally quiet, taciturn demeanour, all these Sundanese\r\npeoples are just as liable as the Orang-Malayu himself, to those sudden\r\noutbursts of demoniacal frenzy and homicidal mania called by them\r\n_m[)e]ng-amok_, and by us \"running amok.\" Indeed A. R. Wallace tells us\r\nthat such wild outbreaks occur more frequently (about one or two every\r\nmonth) amongst the civilised Mangkassaras and Bugis of south Celebes\r\nthan elsewhere in the Archipelago. \"It is the national and therefore the\r\nhonourable mode of committing suicide among the natives of Celebes, and\r\nis the fashionable way of escaping from their difficulties. A Roman fell\r\nupon his sword, a Japanese rips up his stomach, and an Englishman blows\r\nout his brains with a pistol. The Bugis mode has many advantages to one\r\nsuicidically inclined. A man thinks himself wronged by society--he is in\r\ndebt and cannot pay--he is taken for a slave or has gambled away his\r\nwife or child into slavery--he sees no way of recovering what he has\r\nlost, and becomes desperate. He will not put up with such cruel wrongs,\r\nbut will be revenged on mankind and die like a hero. He grasps his\r\nkris-handle, and the next moment draws out the weapon and stabs a man to\r\nthe heart. He runs on, with bloody kris in his hand, stabbing at\r\neveryone he meets. 'Amok! Amok!' then resounds through the streets.\r\nSpears, krisses, knives and guns are brought out against him. He rushes\r\nmadly forward, kills all he can--men, women, and children--and dies\r\noverwhelmed by numbers amid all the excitement of a battle[504].\"\r\n\r\nPossibly connected with this blind impulse may be the strange nervous\r\naffection called _latah_, which is also prevalent amongst the Malayans,\r\nand which was first clearly described by the distinguished Malay\r\nscholar, Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham[505]. No attempt has yet been\r\nmade thoroughly to diagnose this uncanny disorder[506], which would seem\r\nso much more characteristic of the high-strung or shattered nervous\r\nsystem of ultra-refined European society, than of that artless\r\nunsophisticated child of nature, the Orang-Malayu. Its effects on the\r\nmental state are such as to disturb all normal cerebration, and\r\nSwettenham mentions two latah-struck Malays, who would make admirable\r\n\"subjects\" at a seance of theosophic psychists. Any simple device served\r\nto attract their attention, when by merely looking them hard in the face\r\nthey fell helplessly in the hands of the operator, instantly lost all\r\nself-control, and went passively through any performance either verbally\r\nimposed or even merely suggested by a sign.\r\n\r\nA peculiar feminine strain has often been imputed to the Malay\r\ntemperament, yet this same Oceanic people displays in many respects a\r\ncuriously kindred spirit with the ordinary Englishman, as, for instance,\r\nin his love of gambling, boxing, cock-fighting, field sports[507], and\r\nadventure. No more fearless explorers of the high seas, formerly rovers\r\nand corsairs, at all times enterprising traders, are anywhere to be\r\nfound than the Menangkabau Malays and their near kinsmen, the renowned\r\nBugis \"Merchant Adventurers\" of south Celebes. Their clumsy but\r\nseaworthy praus are met in every seaport from Sumatra to the Aru\r\nIslands, and they have established permanent trading stations and even\r\nsettlements in Borneo, the Philippines, Timor, and as far east as New\r\nGuinea. On one occasion Wallace sailed from Dobbo in company with\r\nfifteen large Makassar praus, each with a cargo worth about L1000, and\r\nas many of the Bugis settle amongst the rude aborigines of the eastern\r\nisles, they thus cooperate with the Sumatran Malays in extending the\r\narea of civilising influences throughout Papuasia.\r\n\r\nFormerly they combined piracy with legitimate trade, and long after the\r\nsuppression of the North Bornean corsairs by Keppel and Brooke, the\r\ninland waters continued to be infested especially by the _Bajau_ rovers\r\nof Celebes, and by the _Balagnini_ of the Sulu Archipelago, most dreaded\r\nof all the _Orang-Laut_, \"Men of the Sea,\" the \"Sea Gypsies\" of the\r\nEnglish. These were the \"Cellates\" (_Orang-Selat_, \"Men of the Straits\")\r\nof the early Portuguese writers, who described them as from time\r\nimmemorial engaged in fishing and plundering on the high seas[508].\r\n\r\nIn those days, and even in comparatively late times, the relations in\r\nthe Eastern Archipelago greatly resembled those prevailing in the Aegean\r\nSea at the dawn of Greek history, while the restless seafaring\r\npopulations were still in a state of flux, passing from island to island\r\nin quest of booty or barter before permanently settling down in\r\nfavourable sites[509]. With the Greek historian's philosophic\r\ndisquisition on these Pelasgian and proto-Hellenic relations may be\r\ncompared A. R. Wallace's account of the Batjan coastlands when visited\r\nby him in the late fifties. \"Opposite us, and all along this coast of\r\nBatchian, stretches a row of fine islands completely uninhabited.\r\nWhenever I asked the reason why no one goes to live in them, the answer\r\nalways was 'For fear of the Magindano pirates[510].' Every year these\r\nscourges of the Archipelago wander in one direction or another, making\r\ntheir rendezvous on some uninhabited island, and carrying devastation to\r\nall the small settlements around; robbing, destroying, killing, or\r\ntaking captive all they meet with. Their long, well-manned praus escape\r\nfrom the pursuit of any sailing vessel by pulling away right in the\r\nwind's eye, and the warning smoke of a steamer generally enables them to\r\nhide in some shallow bay, or narrow river, or forest-covered inlet, till\r\nthe danger is passed[511].\" Thus, like geographical surroundings, with\r\ncorresponding social conditions, produce like results in all times\r\namongst all peoples.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental truth receives further illustration from the ideas\r\nprevalent amongst the Malayans regarding witchcraft, the magic arts,\r\ncharms and spells, and especially the belief in the power of certain\r\nmalevolent human beings to transform themselves into wild beasts and\r\nprey upon their fellow-creatures. Such superstitions girdle the globe,\r\ntaking their local colouring from the fauna of the different regions, so\r\nthat the were-wolf of medieval Europe finds its counterpart in the human\r\njaguar of South America, the human lion or leopard of Africa[512], and\r\nthe human tiger of the Malay Peninsula. Hugh Clifford, who relates an\r\noccurrence known to himself in connection with a \"were-tiger\" story of\r\nthe Perak district, aptly remarks that \"the white man and the brown, the\r\nyellow and the black, independently, and without receiving the idea from\r\none another, have all found the same explanation for the like phenomena,\r\nall apparently recognising the truth of the Malay proverb, that we are\r\nlike unto the _taman_ fish that preys upon its own kind[513].\" The story\r\nin question turns upon a young bride, whose husband comes home late\r\nthree nights following, and the third time, being watched, is discovered\r\nby her in the form of a full-grown tiger stretched on the ladder, which,\r\nas in all Malay houses, leads from the ground to the threshold of the\r\ndoor. \"Patimah gazed at the tiger from a distance of only a foot or two,\r\nfor she was too paralysed with fear to move or cry out, and as she\r\nlooked a gradual transformation took place in the creature at her feet.\r\nSlowly, as one sees a ripple of wind pass over the surface of still\r\nwater, the tiger's features palpitated and were changed, until the\r\nhorrified girl saw the face of her husband come up through that of the\r\nbeast, much as the face of a diver comes up to the surface of a pool. In\r\nanother moment Patimah saw that it was Haji Ali who was ascending the\r\nladder of his house, and the spell that had hitherto bound her was\r\nsnapped.\"\r\n\r\nThese same Malays of Perak, H. H. Rajah Dris tells us, are still\r\nspecially noted for many strange customs and superstitions \"utterly\r\nopposed to Muhammadan teaching, and savouring strongly of devil-worship.\r\nThis enormous belief in the supernatural is possibly a relic of the\r\npre-Islam State[514].\"\r\n\r\nWe do not know who were the primitive inhabitants of Borneo. One would\r\nexpect to find Negritoes in the interior, but despite the assertion of\r\nA. de Quatrefages[515] it is impossible to overlook the conclusions of\r\nA. B. Meyer[516] that no authoritative evidence of their occurrence is\r\nforthcoming, and A. C. Haddon[517] confidently states that there are\r\nnone in Sarawak. It might be supposed that the Pre-Dravidian element\r\nfound in Sumatra and Celebes might occur also in Borneo, but the only\r\nindication of such influence is the \"black skin\" noticed among certain\r\nUlu Ayar of the Upper Kapuas in Western Dutch Borneo[518]. With the\r\nexception of certain peoples such as Europeans, Indians, Chinese, and\r\nOrang-Malayu, whose foreign origin is obvious, the population as a whole\r\nmay be regarded as being composed of two main races, the Indonesian and\r\nProto-Malay. Probably all tribes are of mixed origin, but some, such as\r\nthe _Murut_, _Dusun_, _Kalabit_, and _Land Dayak_ are more Indonesian\r\nwhile the _Iban_ (_Sea Dayak_) are distinctly Proto-Malay. The _Land\r\nDayak_ have doubtless been crossed with Indo-Javans.\r\n\r\nScattered over a considerable part of the jungle live the nomad _Punan_\r\nand _Ukit_. They are a slender pale people with a slightly broad head.\r\nThey are grouped in small communities and inhabit the dense jungle at\r\nthe head waters of the principal rivers of Borneo. They live on\r\nwhatever they can find in the jungle, and do not cultivate the soil, nor\r\nlive in permanent houses. Their few wants are supplied by barter from\r\nfriendly settled peoples, or in return for iron implements, calico,\r\nbeads, tobacco, etc., they offer jungle produce, mainly gutta,\r\nindiarubber, camphor, dammar and ratans. They are very mild savages, not\r\nhead-hunters, they are generous to one another, moderately truthful,\r\nkind to the women and very fond of their children.\r\n\r\nHose and Haddon have introduced the term _Klemantan_ (_Kalamantan_) for\r\nthe weak agricultural tribes such as the _Murut_, _Kalabit_, _Land\r\nDayak_, _Sebop_, _Barawan_, _Milanau_, etc.[519] Brook Low[520], who\r\nknew the Land Dayak well, gives a very favourable account of the people\r\nand this opinion has been confirmed by other travellers. They are\r\ndescribed as amiable, honest, grateful, moral and hospitable. Crimes of\r\nviolence, other than head-hunting, are unknown. The circular _panga_ is\r\na \"house set apart for the residence of young unmarried men, in which\r\nthe trophy-heads are kept, and here also all ceremonial receptions take\r\nplace[521].\" The _baloi_ of the Ot Danom of the Kahajan river is very\r\nsimilar[522]. The very energetic and dominating _Bahau-Kenyah-Kayan_\r\ngroup are rather short in stature, with slightly broad heads. They\r\noccupy the best tracts of land which lie in the undulating hills at the\r\nupper reaches of the rivers, between the swampy low country and the\r\nmountains. The Kayan more especially have almost exterminated some of\r\nthe smaller tribes. The Klemantan and Kenyah-Kayan tribes are\r\nagriculturalists. They clear the jungle off the low hills that flank the\r\ntributaries of the larger rivers, but always leave a few scattered trees\r\nstanding; irrigation is attempted by the Kalabits only, as _padi_ rice\r\nis grown like any other cereals on dry ground; swamp _padi_ is also\r\ngrown on the low land. In their gardens they grow yams, pumpkins, sugar\r\ncane, bananas, and sometimes coconuts and other produce. They hunt all\r\nland animals that serve as food, and fish, usually with nets, in the\r\nrivers, or spear those fish that have been stupefied with _tuba_; river\r\nprawns are also a favourite article of diet.\r\n\r\nThey all live in long communal houses which are situated on the banks of\r\nthe rivers. Among the Klemantan tribes the headman has not much\r\ninfluence, unless he is a man of exceptional power and energy, but among\r\nthe larger tribes and especially among the Kayan and Kenyah the headmen\r\nare the real chiefs and exercise undisputed sway. The Kenyah are perhaps\r\nthe most advanced in social evolution, holding their own by superior\r\nsolidarity and intelligence against the turbulent Kayan.\r\n\r\nAll the agricultural tribes are artistic, but in varying degrees; they\r\nare also musical and sing delightful chorus songs. In some tribes the\r\nends of the beams of the houses are carved to represent various animals,\r\nin some the verandah is decorated with boldly carved planks, or with\r\npainted boards and doors. The bamboo receptacles carved in low relief,\r\nthe bone handles of their swords and the minor articles of daily life,\r\nare decorated in a way that reveals the true artistic spirit. Both\r\nKenyah and Kayan smelt iron and make spear heads and sword blades, the\r\nformer being especially noted for their good steel. The forge with two\r\nbellows is the form widely spread in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe truculent _Iban_ (_Sea Dayak_) have spread from a restricted area in\r\nSarawak[523]. They are short and have broader heads than the other\r\ntribes; the colour is on the whole darker than among the cinnamon\r\ncoloured inland tribes. They have the same long, slightly wavy, black\r\nhair showing a reddish tinge in certain lights, that is characteristic\r\nof the Borneans generally. Most of the Iban inhabit low lying land; they\r\nprefer to live on the low hills, but as this is not always practicable\r\nthey plant swamp _padi_; all those who settle at the heads of rivers\r\nplant _padi_ on the hills in the same manner as the up-river natives.\r\nThey also cultivate maize, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, gourds, pumpkins,\r\ncucumbers, melons, mustard, ginger and other vegetables. Generally\r\ngroups of relations work together in the fields. Although essentially\r\nagricultural, they are warlike and passionately devoted to head-hunting.\r\nThe Iban of the Batang Lupar and Saribas in the olden days joined the\r\nMalays in their large war praus on piratical raids along the coast and\r\nup certain rivers and they owe their name of Sea Dayaks to this\r\npractice. The raids were organised by Malays who went for plunder but\r\nthey could always ensure the aid of Iban by the bribe of the heads of\r\nthe slain as their share. The Iban women weave beautiful cotton cloths\r\non a very simple loom. Intricate patterns are made by tying several warp\r\nstrands with leaves at varying intervals, then dipping the whole into\r\nthe dye which does not penetrate the tied portions. This process is\r\nrepeated if a three-colour design is desired. The pattern is produced\r\nsolely in the warp, the woof threads are self-coloured and are not\r\nvisible in the fabric, which is therefore a cotton rep. Little tattooing\r\nis seen among the Iban women though the men have adopted the custom from\r\nthe Kayan.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Iban belong to the same stock as the original\r\nMalay and if so, their migration may be regarded as the first wave of\r\nthe movement that culminated in the Malay Empire. The Malays must have\r\ncome to Borneo not later than the early part of the fifteenth century as\r\nBrunei was a large and wealthy town in 1521. Probably the Malays came\r\ndirectly from the Malay Peninsula, but they must have mixed largely with\r\nthe _Kadayan_, _Milanau_ and other coastal people. The Sarawak and\r\nBrunei Malays are probably mainly coastal Borneans with some Malay\r\nblood, but they have absorbed the Malay culture, spirit and religion.\r\n\r\nFrom the sociological point of view the Punan, living by the chase and\r\non exploitation of jungle produce, represent the lowest grade of culture\r\nin Borneo. Without social organisation they are alike incapable of real\r\nendemic improvement or of seriously affecting other peoples. The purely\r\nagricultural tribes that cultivate _padi_ on the low hills or in the\r\nswamps form the next social stratum. These indigenous tillers of the\r\nsoil have been hard pressed by various swarms of foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe Kenyah-Kayan migration was that of a people of a slightly higher\r\ngrade of culture. They were agriculturalists, but the social\r\norganisation was firmer and they were probably superior in physique. If\r\nthey introduced iron weapons, this would give them an enormous\r\nadvantage. These immigrant agricultural artisans, directed by powerful\r\nchiefs, had no difficulty in taking possession of the most desirable\r\nland.\r\n\r\nFrom an opposite point of the compass in early times came another\r\nagricultural people who strangely enough have strong individualistic\r\ntendencies, the usually peaceable habits of tillers of the soil having\r\nbeen complicated by a lust for heads and other warlike propensities. But\r\nthe Iban do not appear to have gained much against the Kenyah and Kayan.\r\nConquest implies a strong leader, obedience to authority and concerted\r\naction. The Iban appear to be formidable only when led and organised by\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nThe Malay was of a yet higher social type. His political organisation\r\nwas well established, and he had the advantage of religious enthusiasm,\r\nfor Islam has no small share in the expansion of the Malay. He is a\r\ntrader, and still more an exploiter, having a sporting element in his\r\ncharacter not altogether compatible with steady trade. Then appeared on\r\nthe scene the Anglo-Saxon overlord. The quality of firmness combined\r\nwith justice made itself felt. At times the lower social types hurled\r\nthemselves, but in vain, against the instrument that had been forged and\r\ntempered in a similar turmoil of Iberian, Celt, Angle and Viking in\r\nNorthern Europe. Now they acknowledge that safety of life and property\r\nand almost complete liberty are fully worth the very small price that\r\nthey have to pay for them[524].\r\n\r\nThe cult of omen animals, most frequently birds, is indigenous to\r\nBorneo. These are possessed with the spirit of certain invisible beings\r\nabove, and bear their names, and are invoked to secure good crops,\r\nfreedom from accident, victory in war, profit in exchange, skill in\r\ndiscourse and cleverness in all native craft. The Iban have a belief in\r\n_Ngarong_ or spirit-helpers, somewhat resembling that of the _Manitu_ of\r\nNorth America. The _Ngarong_ is the spirit of a dead relative who visits\r\na dreamer, who afterwards searches for the outward and visible sign of\r\nhis spiritual protector, and finds it in some form, perhaps a natural\r\nobject, or some one animal, henceforth held in special respect[525].\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra there occur some remains of Hindu temples[526], as well as\r\nother mysterious monuments in the Passumah lands inland from Benkulen,\r\nrelics of a former culture, which goes back to prehistoric times. They\r\ntake the form of huge monoliths, which are roughly shaped to the\r\nlikeness of human figures, with strange features very different from the\r\nMalay or Hindu types. The present Sarawi natives of the district, who\r\nwould be quite incapable of executing such works, know nothing of their\r\norigin, and attribute them to certain legendary beings who formerly\r\nwandered over the land, turning all their enemies into stone. Further\r\nresearch may possibly discover some connection between these relics of a\r\nforgotten past and the numerous prehistoric monuments of Easter Island\r\nand other places in the Pacific Ocean. Of all the Indonesian peoples\r\nstill surviving in Malaysia, none present so many points of contact with\r\nthe Eastern Polynesians, as do the natives of the Mentawi Islands which\r\nskirt the south-west coast of Sumatra. \"On a closer inspection of the\r\ninhabitants the attentive observer at once perceives that the Mentawi\r\nnatives have but little in common with the peoples and tribes of the\r\nneighbouring islands, and that as regards physical appearance, speech,\r\ncustoms, and usages they stand almost entirely apart. They bear such a\r\ndecided stamp of a Polynesian tribe that one feels far more inclined to\r\ncompare them with the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands[527].\"\r\n\r\nThe survival of an Indonesian group on the western verge of Malaysia is\r\nall the more remarkable since the _Nias_ islanders, a little farther\r\nnorth, are of Mongol stock, like most if not all of the inhabitants of\r\nthe Sumatran mainland. Here the typical Malays of the central districts\r\n(Menangkabau, Korinchi, and Siak) merge southwards in the mixed\r\nMalayo-Javanese peoples of the _Rejang_, _Palembang_, and _Lampong_\r\ndistricts. Although Muhammadans probably since the thirteenth century,\r\nall these peoples had been early brought under Hindu influences by\r\nmissionaries and even settlers from Java, and these influences are still\r\napparent in many of the customs, popular traditions, languages, and\r\nletters of the South Sumatran settled communities. Thus the Lampongs,\r\ndespite their profession of Islam, employ, not the Arabic characters,\r\nlike the Malays proper, but a script derived from the peculiar Javanese\r\nwriting system. This system itself, originally introduced from India\r\nprobably over 2000 years ago, is based on some early forms of the\r\nDevanagari, such as those occurring in the rock inscriptions of the\r\nfamous Buddhist king As'oka (third century B.C.)[528]. From Java, which\r\nis now shown beyond doubt to be the true centre of dispersion[529], the\r\nparent alphabet was under Hindu influences diffused in pre-Muhammadan\r\ntimes throughout Malaysia, from Sumatra to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nBut the thinly-spread Indo-Javanese culture, in few places penetrating\r\nmuch below the surface, received a rude shock from the Muhammadan\r\nirruption, its natural development being almost everywhere arrested, or\r\nelse either effaced or displaced by Islam. No trace can any longer be\r\ndetected of graphic signs in Borneo, where the aborigines have retained\r\nthe savage state even in those southern districts where Buddhism or\r\nBrahmanism had certainly been propagated long before the arrival of the\r\nMuhammadan Malays. But elsewhere the Javanese stock alphabet has shown\r\nextraordinary vitality, persisting under diverse forms down to the\r\npresent day, not only amongst the semi-civilised Mussulman peoples, such\r\nas the Sumatran Rejangs[530], Korinchi, and Lampongs, the Bugis and\r\nMangkassaras of Celebes, and the (now Christian) Tagalogs and Visayas\r\nof the Philippines, but even amongst the somewhat rude and pagan Palawan\r\nnatives, the wild Manguianes of Mindoro, and the cannibal Battas[531] of\r\nNorth Sumatra.\r\n\r\nThese Battas, however, despite their undoubted cannibalism[532], cannot\r\nbe called savages, at least without some reserve. They are skilful\r\nstock-breeders and agriculturists, raising fine crops of maize and rice;\r\nthey dwell together in large, settled communities with an organised\r\ngovernment, hereditary chiefs, popular assemblies, and a written civil\r\nand penal code. There is even an effective postal system, which utilises\r\nfor letter-boxes the hollow tree-trunks at all the cross-roads, and is\r\nlargely patronised by the young men and women, all of whom read and\r\nwrite, and carry on an animated correspondence in their degraded\r\nDevanagari script, which is written on palm-leaves in vertical lines\r\nrunning upwards and from right to left. The Battas also excel in several\r\nindustries, such as pottery, weaving, jewellery, iron work, and\r\nhouse-building, their picturesque dwellings, which resemble Swiss\r\nchalets, rising to two stories above the ground-floor reserved for the\r\nlive stock. For these arts they are no doubt largely indebted to their\r\nHindu teachers, from whom also they have inherited some of their\r\nreligious ideas, such as the triune deity--Creator, Preserver, and\r\nDestroyer--besides other inferior divinities collectively called\r\n_diebata_, a modified form of the Indian _devate_[533].\r\n\r\nIn the strangest contrast to these survivals of a foreign culture which\r\nhad probably never struck very deep roots, stand the savage survivals\r\nfrom still more ancient times. Conspicuous amongst these are the\r\ncannibal practices, which if not now universal still take some\r\npeculiarly revolting forms. Thus captives and criminals are, under\r\ncertain circumstances, condemned to be eaten alive, and the same fate is\r\nor was reserved for those incapacitated for work by age or infirmities.\r\nWhen the time came, we are told by the early European observers and by\r\nthe reports of the Arabs, the \"grandfathers\" voluntarily suspended\r\nthemselves by their arms from an overhanging branch, while friends and\r\nneighbours danced round and round, shouting, \"when the fruit is ripe it\r\nfalls.\" And when it did fall, that is, as soon as it could hold on no\r\nlonger, the company fell upon it with their krisses, hacking it to\r\npieces, and devouring the remains seasoned with lime-juice, for such\r\nfeasts were generally held when the limes were ripe[534].\r\n\r\nGrouped chiefly round about Lake Toba, the Battas occupy a very wide\r\ndomain, stretching south to about the parallel of Mount Ophir, and\r\nbordering northwards on the territory of the Achin people. These valiant\r\nnatives, who have till recently stoutly maintained their political\r\nindependence against the Dutch, were also at one time Hinduized, as is\r\nevident from many of their traditions, their Malayan language largely\r\ncharged with Sanskrit terms, and even their physical appearance,\r\nsuggesting a considerable admixture of Hindu as well as of Arab blood.\r\nWith the Arab traders and settlers came the Koran, and the Achinese\r\npeople have been not over-zealous followers of the Prophet since the\r\nclose of the twelfth century. The Muhammadan State, founded in 1205,\r\nacquired a dominant position in the Archipelago early in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when it ruled over about half of Sumatra, exacted tribute from\r\nmany vassal princes, maintained powerful armaments by land and sea, and\r\nentered into political and commercial relations with Egypt, Japan, and\r\nseveral European States.\r\n\r\nThere are two somewhat distinct ethnical groups, the _Orang-Tunong_ of\r\nthe uplands, a comparatively homogeneous Malayan people, and the mixed\r\n_Orang-Baruh_ of the lowlands, who are described by A. Lubbers[535] as\r\ntaller than the average Malay (5 feet 5 or 6 in.), also less\r\nround-headed (index 80.5), with prominent nose, rather regular features,\r\nand muscular frames; but the complexion is darker than that of the\r\nOrang-Malayu, a trait which has been attributed to a larger infusion of\r\nDravidian blood (Klings and Tamuls) from southern India. The charge of\r\ncruelty and treachery brought against them by the Dutch may be received\r\nwith some reserve, such terms as \"patriot\" and \"rebel\" being\r\ninterchangeable according to the standpoints from which they are\r\nconsidered. In any case no one denies them the virtues of valour and\r\nlove of freedom, with which are associated industrious habits and a\r\nremarkable aptitude for such handicrafts as metal work, jewellery,\r\nweaving, and ship-building. The Achinese do not appear to be very strict\r\nMuhammadans; polygamy is little practised, their women are free to go\r\nabroad unveiled, nor are they condemned to the seclusion of the harem,\r\nand a pleasing survival from Buddhist times is the _Kanduri_, a solemn\r\nfeast, in which the poor are permitted to share. Another reminiscence of\r\nHindu philosophy may perhaps have been an outburst of religious fervour,\r\nwhich took the form of a pantheistic creed, and was so zealously\r\npreached, that it had to be stamped out with fire and sword by the\r\ndominant Moslem monotheists[536].\r\n\r\nSince the French occupation of Madagascar, the Malagasy problem has\r\nnaturally been revived. But it may be regretted that so much time and\r\ntalent have been spent on a somewhat thrashed-out question by a number\r\nof writers, who did not first take the trouble to read up the literature\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\nBy what race Madagascar was first peopled it is no longer possible to\r\nsay. The local reports or traditions of primitive peoples, either\r\nextinct or still surviving in the interior, belong rather to the sphere\r\nof Malagasy folklore than to that of ethnological research. In these\r\nreports mention is frequently made of the _Kimos_, said to be now or\r\nformerly living in the Bara country, and of the _Vazimbas_, who are by\r\nsome supposed to have been Gallas (_Ba-Simba_)--though they had no\r\nknowledge of iron--whose graves are supposed to be certain monolithic\r\nmonuments which take the form of menhirs disposed in circles, and are\r\nbelieved by the present inhabitants of the land to be still haunted by\r\nevil spirits, that is, the ghosts of the long extinct Vazimbas.\r\n\r\nMuch of the confusion prevalent regarding the present ethnical relations\r\nmay be avoided if certain points (ably summarised by T. A. Joyce[537])\r\nare borne in mind. The greater part of the population is negroid; the\r\nlanguage spoken over the whole of the island and many institutions and\r\ncustoms are Malayo-Polynesian. A small section (Antimerina commonly\r\ncalled Hovas)--forming the dominant people in the nineteenth century--is\r\nof fairly pure Malay (or Javanese) blood, but is composed of\r\nsixteenth-century immigrants, whereas the language belongs to a very\r\nearly branch of the Malayo-Polynesian (Austronesian) family. It would be\r\nnatural to suppose that the negroid element was African[538], for in\r\nlater times large numbers of Africans have been brought over by Arabs\r\nand other slavers; but there are several objections to this view. In the\r\nfirst place, the natives of the neighbouring coast are not seamen, and\r\nthe voyage to Madagascar offers peculiar difficulties owing to the\r\nstrong currents. In the second place, it seems impossible that the first\r\ninhabitants, supposing them to be African, should have abandoned their\r\nown language in favour of one introduced by a small minority of\r\nimmigrants; the few Bantu words found in Madagascar may well have been\r\nadopted from the slaves. In the third place, the culture exhibits no\r\ndistinctively African features, but is far more akin to that of\r\nsouth-east Asia. There is much to be said, therefore, for the view that\r\nthe earliest and negroid inhabitants of Madagascar were Oceanic\r\nnegroids, who have always been known as expert seamen.\r\n\r\nSince the coming of the negroid population, which probably arrived in\r\nvery early days, various small bands of immigrants or castaways have\r\nlanded on the shores of Madagascar and imposed themselves as reigning\r\ndynasties on the surrounding villages, each thus forming the nucleus of\r\nwhat now appears as a tribe. Among these were immigrants from Arabia,\r\nand J. T. Last, who identifies Madagascar with the island of\r\n_Menuthias_ described by Arrian in the third century A.D.[539], suggests\r\nthe \"possibility that Madagascar may have been reached by Arabs before\r\nthe Christian era.\" This \"possibility\" is converted almost into a\r\ncertainty by the analysis of the Arabo-Malagasy terms made by Dahle, who\r\nclearly shows that such terms \"are comparatively very few,\" and also\r\n\"very ancient,\" in fact that, as already suggested by Fleischer of\r\nLeipzig, many, perhaps the majority of them, \"may be traced back to\r\nHimyaritic influence[540],\" that is, not merely to pre-Muhammadan, but\r\nto pre-Christian times, just like the Sanskritic elements in the Oceanic\r\ntongues.\r\n\r\nThe evidence that Malagasy is itself one of these Oceanic tongues, and\r\nnot an offshoot of the comparatively recent standard Malay is\r\noverwhelming, and need not here detain us[541]. The diffusion of this\r\nAustronesian language over the whole island--even amongst distinctly\r\nNegroid Bantu populations, such as the Betsileos and Tanalas--to the\r\nabsolute exclusion of all other forms of speech, is an extraordinary\r\nlinguistic phenomenon more easily proved than explained. There are, of\r\ncourse, provincialisms and even what may be called local dialects, such\r\nas that of the Antankarana people at the northern extremity of the\r\nisland who, although commonly included in the large division of the\r\nwestern Sakalavas, really form a separate ethnical group, speaking a\r\nsomewhat marked variety of Malagasy. But even this differs much less\r\nfrom the normal form than might be supposed by comparing, for instance,\r\nsuch a term as _maso-mahamay_, sun, with the Hova _maso-andro_, where\r\n_maso_ in both means \"eye,\" _mahamay_ in both = \"burning,\" and _andro_\r\nin both = \"day.\" Thus the only difference is that one calls the sun\r\n\"burning eye,\" while the Hovas call it the \"day's eye,\" as do so many\r\npeoples in Malaysia[542].\r\n\r\nSo also the fish-eating _Anorohoro_ people, a branch of the _Sihanakas_\r\nin the Alaotra valley, are said to have \"quite a different dialect from\r\nthem[543].\" But the statement need not be taken too seriously, because\r\nthese rustic fisherfolk, who may be called the Gothamites of Madagascar,\r\nare supposed, by their scornful neighbours, to do everything\r\n\"contrariwise.\" Of them it is told that once when cooking eggs they\r\nboiled them for hours to make them soft, and then finding they got\r\nharder and harder threw them away as unfit for food. Others having only\r\none slave, who could not paddle the canoe properly, cut him in two,\r\nputting one half at the prow, the other at the stern, and were surprised\r\nat the result. It was not to be expected that such simpletons should\r\nspeak Malagasy properly, which nevertheless is spoken with surprising\r\nuniformity by all the Malayan and Negro or Negroid peoples alike.\r\n\r\nIn Madagascar, however, the fusion of the two races is far less complete\r\nthan is commonly supposed. Various shades of transition between the two\r\nextremes are no doubt presented by the _Sakalavas_ of the west, and the\r\n_Betsimisarakas_, _Sitanakas_, and others of the east coast. But,\r\nstrange to say, on the central tableland the two seem to stand almost\r\ncompletely apart, so that here the politically dominant Hovas still\r\npresent all the essential characteristics of the Oceanic Mongol, while\r\ntheir southern neighbours, the _Betsileos_, as well as the _Tanalas_ and\r\n_Ibaras_, are described as \"African pure and simple, allied to the\r\nsouth-eastern tribes of that continent[544].\"\r\n\r\nSpecially remarkable is the account given by a careful observer, G. A.\r\nShaw, of the Betsileos, whose \"average height is not less than six feet\r\nfor the men, and a few inches less for the women. They are large-boned\r\nand muscular, and their colour is several degrees darker than that of\r\nthe Hovas, approaching very close to a black. The forehead is low and\r\nbroad, the nose flatter, and the lips thicker than those of their\r\nconquerors, whilst their hair is _invariably_ crisp and woolly. No pure\r\nBetsileo is to be met with having the smooth long hair of the Hovas. In\r\nthis, as in other points, there is a very clear departure from the\r\nMalayan type, and a close approximation to the Negro races of the\r\nadjacent continent[545].\"\r\n\r\nNow compare these brawny negroid giants with the wiry undersized Malayan\r\nHovas. As described by A. Vouchereau[546], their type closely resembles\r\nthat of the Javanese--short stature, yellowish or light leather\r\ncomplexion, long, black, smooth and rather coarse hair, round head\r\n(85.25), flat and straight forehead, flat face, prominent cheek-bones,\r\nsmall straight nose, tolerably wide nostrils, small black and slightly\r\noblique eyes, rather thick lips, slim lithesome figure, small\r\nextremities, dull restless expression, cranial capacity 1516 c.c.,\r\nsuperior to both Negro and Sakalava[547].\r\n\r\nExcept in respect of this high cranial capacity, the measurements of\r\nthree Malagasy skulls in the Cambridge University Anatomical Museum,\r\nstudied by W. L. H. Duckworth[548], correspond fairly well with these\r\ndescriptions. Thus the cephalic index of the reputed Betsimisaraka\r\n(Negroid) and that of the Betsileo (Negro) are respectively 71 and 72.4,\r\nwhile that of the Hova is 82.1; the first two, therefore, are\r\nlong-headed, the third round-headed, as we should expect. But the cubic\r\ncapacity of the Hova (presumably Mongoloid) is only 1315 as compared\r\nwith 1450 and 1480 of two others, presumably African Negroes. Duckworth\r\ndiscusses the question whether the black element in Madagascar is of\r\nAfrican or Oceanic (Melanesian-Papuan) origin, about which much\r\ndiversity of opinion still prevails, and on the evidence of the few\r\ncranial specimens available he decides in favour of the African.\r\n\r\nDespite the low cubic capacity of Duckworth's Hova, the mental powers of\r\nthese, and indeed of the Malagasy generally, are far from despicable.\r\nBefore the French occupation the London Missionary Society had succeeded\r\nin disseminating Christian principles and even some degree of culture\r\namong considerable numbers both in the Hova capital and surrounding\r\ndistricts. The local press had been kept going by native compositors who\r\nhad issued quite an extensive literature both in Malagasy and English.\r\nAgricultural and industrial methods had been improved, some engineering\r\nworks attempted, and the Hova craftsmen had learnt to build but not to\r\ncomplete houses in the European style, because, although they could\r\nmaster European processes, they could not, Christians though they were,\r\nget the better of the old superstitions, one of which is that the owner\r\nof a house always dies within a year of its completion. Longevity is\r\ntherefore ensured by not completing it, with the curious result that the\r\nwhole city looks unfinished or dilapidated. In the house where Mrs\r\nColvile stayed, \"one window was framed and glazed, the other nailed up\r\nwith rough boards; part of the stair-banister had no top-rail; outside\r\nonly a portion of the roof had been tiled; and so on throughout[549].\"\r\n\r\nThe culture has been thus summarised by T. A. Joyce[550]. Clothing is\r\nentirely vegetable, and the Malay _sarong_ is found throughout the east;\r\nbark-cloth in the south-east and west. Hairdressing varies considerably,\r\nand among the Bara and Sakalava is often elaborate. Silver ornaments are\r\nfound amongst the Antimerina and some other eastern tribes, made chiefly\r\nfrom European coins dating from the sixteenth century. Circumcision is\r\nuniversal. In the east the tribes are chiefly agricultural; in the\r\nnorth, west and south, pastoral. Fishing is important among those tribes\r\nsituated on coast, lake or river. Houses are all rectangular and\r\npile-dwellings are found locally. Rice is the staple crop and the cattle\r\nare of the humped variety. The Antimerina excel the rest in all crafts.\r\nWeaving, basket-work (woven variety) and iron-working are all good; the\r\nuse of iron is said to have been unknown to the Bara and Vazimba until\r\ncomparatively recent times. Pottery is poor. Carvings in the round (men\r\nand animals) are found amongst the Sakalava and Bara, in relief\r\n(arabesques, etc.) among the Betsileo and others. Before the\r\nintroduction of firearms, the spear was the universal weapon; bows are\r\nrare and possibly of late introduction; slings and the blowgun are also\r\nfound. Shields are circular, made of wood covered with hide. The early\r\nsystem of government was patriarchal, and villages were independent; the\r\nlater immigrants introduced a system of feudal monarchy with themselves\r\nas a ruling caste. Thus the Antimerina have three main castes;\r\n_Andriana_ or nobles (_i.e._ pure-blooded descendants of the\r\nconquerors), _Hova_, or freemen (descendants of the incorporated Vazimba\r\nmore or less mixed with the conquerors), and _Andevo_ or slaves. The\r\nking was regarded almost as a god. An institution thoroughly suggestive\r\nof Malayo-Polynesian sociology is that of _fadi_ or tabu, which enters\r\ninto every sphere of human activity. An indefinite creator-god was\r\nrecognized, but more important were a number of spirits and fetishes,\r\nthe latter with definite functions. Signs of tree worship and of belief\r\nin transmigration are sporadic. At the present time, half the population\r\nof the island is, at least nominally, Christian.\r\n\r\nA good deal of fancy is displayed in the oral literature, comprising\r\nhistories, or at least legends, fables, songs, riddles, and a great mass\r\nof folklore, much of which has already been rescued from oblivion by the\r\n\"Malagasy Folklore Society.\" Some of the stories present the usual\r\nanalogies to others in widely separated lands, stories which seem to be\r\nperennial, and to crop up wherever the surface is a little disturbed by\r\ninvestigators. One of those in Dahle's extensive collection, entitled\r\nthe \"History of Andrianarisainaboniamasoboniamanoro\" might be described\r\nas a variant of our \"Beauty and the Beast.\" Besides this prince with the\r\nlong name, called _Bonia_ \"for short,\" there is a princess \"Golden\r\nBeauty,\" both being of miraculous birth, but the latter a cripple and\r\ndeformed, until found and wedded by Bonia. Then she is so transfigured\r\nthat the \"Beast\" is captivated and contrives to carry her off. Thereupon\r\nfollows an extraordinary series of adventures, resulting of course in\r\nthe rescue of Golden Beauty by Bonia, when everything ends happily, not\r\nonly for the two lovers, but for all other people whose wives had also\r\nbeen abducted. These are now restored to their husbands by the hero, who\r\nvanquishes and slays the monster in a fierce fight, just as in our\r\nnursery tales of knights and dragons.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, where the ethnical confusion is probably greater\r\nthan in any other part of Malaysia, the great bulk of the inhabitants\r\nappear to be of Indonesian and proto-Malayan stocks. Except in the\r\nsouthern island of Mindanao, which is still mainly Muhammadan or\r\nheathen, most of the settled populations have long been nominal Roman\r\nCatholics under a curious theocratic administration, in which the true\r\nrulers are not the civil functionaries, but the priests, and especially\r\nthe regular clergy[551]. One result has been over three centuries of\r\nunstable political and social relations, ending in the occupation of the\r\narchipelago by the United States (1898). Another, with which we are here\r\nmore concerned, has been such a transformation of the subtle Malayan\r\ncharacter that those who have lived longest amongst the natives\r\npronounce their temperament unfathomable. Having to comply outwardly\r\nwith the numerous Christian observances, they seek relief in two ways,\r\nfirst by making the most of the Catholic ceremonial and turning the many\r\nfeast-days of the calendar into occasions of revelry and dissipation,\r\nconnived at if not even shared in by the padres[552]; secondly by\r\nsecretly cherishing the old beliefs and disguising their true feelings,\r\nuntil the opportunity is presented of throwing off the mask and\r\ndeclaring themselves in their true colours. A Franciscan friar, who had\r\nspent half his life amongst them, left on record that \"the native is an\r\nincomprehensible phenomenon, the mainspring of whose line of thought and\r\nthe guiding motive of whose actions have never yet been, and perhaps\r\nnever will be, discovered. A native will serve a master satisfactorily\r\nfor years, and then suddenly abscond, or commit some such hideous crime\r\nas conniving with a brigand band to murder the family and pillage the\r\nhouse[553].\"\r\n\r\nIn fact nobody can ever tell what a Tagal, and especially a Visaya, will\r\ndo at any moment. His character is a succession of surprises; \"the\r\nexperience of each year brings one to form fresh conclusions, and the\r\nmost exact definition of such a kaleidoscopic creature is, after all,\r\nhypothetical.\"\r\n\r\nAfter centuries of misrule, it was perhaps not surprising that no kind\r\nof sympathy was developed between the natives and the whites. Foreman\r\nfells us that everywhere in the archipelago he found mothers teaching\r\ntheir little ones to look on their white rulers as demoniacal beings,\r\nevil spirits, or at least something to be dreaded. \"If a child cries, it\r\nis hushed by the exclamation, _Castila!_ (Spaniard); if a white man\r\napproaches a native dwelling, the watchword always is _Castila!_ and the\r\nchildren hasten to retreat from the dreadful object.\"\r\n\r\nFor administrative purposes the natives were classed in three social\r\ndivisions--_Indios_, _Infieles_, and _Moros_--which, as aptly remarked\r\nby F. H. H. Guillemard, is \"an ecclesiastical rather than a scientific\r\nclassification[554].\" The _Indios_ were the Christianized and more or\r\nless cultured populations of all the towns and of the settled\r\nagricultural districts, speaking a distinct Malayo-Polynesian language\r\nof much more archaic type than the standard Malay. According to the\r\ncensus of 1903 the total population of the islands was 7,635,428, of\r\nwhom nearly 7,000,000 were classed as civilised, and the rest as wild,\r\nincluding 23,000 Negritoes (_Aeta_, see p. 156). At the time of the\r\nSpanish occupation in the sixteenth century the _Visayas_ of the central\r\nislands and part of Mindanao were the most advanced among the native\r\ntribes, but this distinction is now claimed for the _Tagalogs_, who form\r\nthe bulk of the population in Manila and other parts of Luzon, and also\r\nin Mindanao, and whose language is gradually displacing other dialects\r\nthroughout the archipelago. Other civilised tribes are the _Ilocano_,\r\n_Bicol_, _Pangasinan_, _Pampangan_ and _Cagayan_, all of Luzon. Less\r\ncivilised tribes are the _Manobo_, _Mandaya_, _Subano_ and _Bagobo_ of\r\nMindanao, the _Bukidnon_ of Mindanao and the central islands, the\r\n_Tagbanua_ and _Batak_ of Palawan, and the _Igorots_ of Luzon, some of\r\nwhom are industrious farmers, while among others, head-hunting is still\r\nprevalent. These have been described by A. E. Jenks in a monograph[555].\r\nThe head form is very variable. Of 32 men measured by Jenks the\r\nextremes of cephalic index were 91.48 and 67.48. The stature is always\r\nlow, averaging 1.62 m. (5 ft. 4 in.) but with an appearance of greater\r\nheight. The hair is black, straight, lank, coarse and abundant but \"I\r\ndoubt whether to-day an entire tribe of perfectly straight-haired\r\nprimitive Malayan people exists in the archipelago[556].\"\r\n\r\nUnder _Moros_ (\"Moors\") are comprised the Muhammadans exclusively, some\r\nof whom are Malayans (chiefly in Mindanao, Basilan, and Palawan), some\r\ntrue Malays (chiefly in the Sulu archipelago). Many of these are still\r\nindependent, and not a few, if not actually wild, are certainly but\r\nlittle removed from the savage state. Yet, like the Sumatran Battas,\r\nthey possess a knowledge of letters, the Sulu people using the Arabic\r\nscript, as do all the Orang-Malayu, while the Palawan natives employ a\r\nvariant of the Devanagari prototype derived directly from the Javanese,\r\nas above explained. They number nearly 280,000, of whom more than one\r\nhalf are in Mindanao, and they form the bulk of the population in some\r\nof the islands of the Sulu archipelago.\r\n\r\nSome of these Sulu people, till lately fierce sea-rovers, get baptized\r\nnow and then; but, says Foreman, \"they appeared to be as much Christian\r\nas I was Mussulman[557].\" They keep their harems all the same, and when\r\nasked how many gods there are, answer \"four,\" presumably Allah plus the\r\nAthanasian Trinity. So the Ba-Fiots of Angola add crucifying to their\r\n\"penal code,\" and so in King M'tesa's time the Baganda scrupulously kept\r\ntwo weekly holidays, the Mussulman Friday, and the Christian Sunday.\r\nLofty creeds superimposed too rapidly on primitive beliefs are apt to\r\nget \"mixed\"; they need time to become assimilated.\r\n\r\nThat in the aborigines of Formosa are represented both Mongol\r\n(proto-Malayan) and Indonesian elements may now probably be accepted as\r\nan established fact. The long-standing reports of Negritoes also, like\r\nthe Philippine Aeta, have never been confirmed, and may be dismissed\r\nfrom the present consideration. Probably five-sixths of the whole\r\npopulation are Chinese immigrants, amongst whom are a large number of\r\nHakkas and Hok-los from the provinces of Fo-Kien and Kwang-tung[558].\r\nThey occupy all the cultivated western lowlands, which from the\r\nethnological standpoint may be regarded as a seaward outpost of the\r\nChinese mainland. The rest of the island, that is, the central highlands\r\nand precipitous eastern slopes, may similarly be looked on as a\r\nnorth-eastern outpost of Malaysia, being almost exclusively held by\r\nIndonesian and Malayan aborigines from Malaysia (especially the\r\nPhilippines), with possibly some early intruders both from Polynesia and\r\nfrom the north (Japan). All are classed by the Chinese settlers after\r\ntheir usual fashion in three social divisions:--\r\n\r\n1. The _Pepohwans_ of the plains, who although called \"Barbarians,\" are\r\nsedentary agriculturists and quite as civilised as their Chinese\r\nneighbours themselves, with whom they are gradually merging in a single\r\nethnical group. The Pepohwans are described by P. Ibis as a fine race,\r\nvery tall, and \"fetishists,\" though the mysterious rites are left to the\r\nwomen. Their national feasts, dances, and other usages forcibly recall\r\nthose of the Micronesians and Polynesians. They may therefore, perhaps,\r\nbe regarded as early immigrants from the South Sea Islands, distinct in\r\nevery respect from the true aborigines.\r\n\r\n2. The _Sekhwans_, \"Tame Savages[559],\" who are also settled\r\nagriculturists, subject to the Chinese (since 1895 to the Japanese)\r\nadministration, but physically distinct from all the other\r\nFormosans--light complexion, large mouth, thick lips, remarkably long\r\nand prominent teeth, weak constitution. P. Ibis suspects a strain of\r\nDutch blood dating from the seventeenth century. This is confirmed by\r\nthe old books and other curious documents found amongst them, which have\r\ngiven rise to so much speculation, and, it may be added, some\r\nmystification, regarding a peculiar writing system and a literature\r\nformerly current amongst the Formosan aborigines[560].\r\n\r\n3. The _Chinhwans_, \"Green Barbarians\"--that is, utter savages--the true\r\nindependent aborigines, of whom there are an unknown number of tribes,\r\nbut regarding whom the Chinese possess but little definite information.\r\nNot so their Japanese successors, one of whom, Kisak Tamai[561], tells\r\nus that the Chinhwans show a close resemblance to the Malays of the\r\nMalay Peninsula and also to those of the Philippines, and in some\r\nrespects to the Japanese themselves. When dressed like Japanese and\r\nmingling with Japanese women, they can hardly be distinguished from\r\nthem. The vendetta is still rife amongst many of the ruder tribes, and\r\nsuch is their traditional hatred of the Chinese intruders that no one\r\ncan either be tattooed or permitted to wear a bracelet until he has\r\ncarried off a Celestial head or two. In every household there is a frame\r\nor bracket on which these heads are mounted, and some of their warriors\r\ncan proudly point to over seventy of such trophies. It is a relief to\r\nhear that with their new Japanese masters they have sworn friendship,\r\nthese new rulers of the land being their \"brothers and sisters.\" The\r\noath of eternal alliance is taken by digging a hole in the ground,\r\nputting a stone in it, throwing earth at each other, then covering the\r\nstone with the earth, all of which means that \"as the stone in the\r\nground keeps sound, so do we keep our word unbroken.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that this Japanese ethnologist's remarks on\r\nthe physical resemblances of the aborigines are fully in accord with\r\nthose of European observers. Thus to Hamy \"they recalled the Igorrotes\r\nof North Luzon, as well as the Malays of Singapore[562].\" G. Taylor\r\nalso, who has visited several of the wildest groups in the southern and\r\neastern districts[563] (_Tipuns_, _Paiwans_, _Diaramocks_, _Nickas_,\r\n_Amias_ and many others), traces some \"probably\" to Japan (Tipuns);\r\nothers to Malaysia (the cruel, predatory Paiwan head-hunters); and\r\nothers to the Liu-Kiu archipelago (the Pepohwans now of Chinese speech).\r\nHe describes the Diaramocks as the most dreaded of all the southern\r\ngroups, but doubts whether the charge of cannibalism brought against\r\nthem by their neighbours is quite justified.\r\n\r\nWhether the historical Malays from Singapore or elsewhere, as above\r\nsuggested, are really represented in Formosa may be doubted, since no\r\nsurvivals either of Hindu or Muhammadan rites appear to have been\r\ndetected amongst the aborigines. It is of course possible that they may\r\nhave reached the island at some remote time, and since relapsed into\r\nsavagery, from which the Orang-laut were never very far removed. But in\r\nthe absence of proof, it will be safer to regard all the wild tribes as\r\npartly of Indonesian, partly of proto-Malayan origin.\r\n\r\nThis view is also in conformity with the character of the numerous\r\nFormosan dialects, whose affinities are either with the Gyarung and\r\nothers of the Asiatic Indonesian tongues, or else with the Austronesian\r\norganic speech generally, but not specially with any particular member\r\nof that family, least of all with the comparatively recent standard\r\nMalay. Thus Arnold Schetelig points out that only about a sixth part of\r\nthe Formosan vocabulary taken generally corresponds with modern\r\nMalay[564]. The analogies of all the rest must be sought in the various\r\nbranches of the Oceanic stock language, and in the Gyarung and the\r\nnon-Chinese tongues of Eastern China[565]. Formosa thus presents a\r\ncurious ethnical and linguistic connecting link between the Continental\r\nand Oceanic populations.\r\n\r\nIn the Nicobar archipelago are distinguished two ethnical groups, the\r\ncoast people, _i.e._ the _Nicobarese_[566] proper, and the _Shom Pen_,\r\naborigines of the less accessible inland districts in Great Nicobar. But\r\nthe distinction appears to be rather social than racial, and we may now\r\nconclude with E. H. Man that all the islanders belong essentially to the\r\nMongolic division, the inlanders representing the pure type, the others\r\nbeing \"descended from a mongrel Malay stock, the crosses being probably\r\nin the majority of cases with Burmese and occasionally with natives of\r\nthe opposite coast of Siam, and perchance also in remote times with such\r\nof the Shom Pen as may have settled in their midst[567].\"\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous usages which point to an Indo-Chinese and Oceanic\r\nconnection are pile-dwellings; the chewing of betel, which appears to be\r\nhere mixed with some earthy substance causing a dental incrustation so\r\nthick as even to prevent the closing of the lips; distention of the\r\near-lobe by wooden cylinders; aversion from the use of milk; and the\r\n_couvade_, as amongst some Bornean Dayaks. The language, which has an\r\nextraordinarily rich phonetic system (as many as 25 consonantal and 35\r\nvowel sounds), is polysyllabic and untoned, like the Austronesian, and\r\nthe type also seems to resemble the Oceanic more than the Continental\r\nMongol subdivision. Mean height 5 ft. 3 in. (Shom Pen one inch less);\r\nnose wide and flat; eyes rather obliquely set; cheekbones prominent;\r\nfeatures flat, though less so than in the normal Malayan; complexion\r\nmostly a yellowish or reddish brown (Shom Pen dull brown); hair a dark\r\nrusty brown, rarely quite black, straight, though not seldom wavy and\r\neven ringletty, but Shom Pen generally quite straight.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand they approach nearer to the Burmese in their mental\r\ncharacters; in their frank, independent spirit, inquisitiveness, and\r\nkindness towards their women, who enjoy complete social equality, as in\r\nBurma; and lastly in their universal belief in spirits called _iwi_ or\r\n_siya_, who, like the _nats_ of Indo-China, cause sickness and death\r\nunless scared away or appeased by offerings. Like the Burmese, also,\r\nthey place a piece of money in the mouth or against the cheek of a\r\ncorpse before burial, to help in the other world.\r\n\r\nOne of the few industries is the manufacture of a peculiar kind of rough\r\npainted pottery, which is absolutely confined to the islet of Chowra, 5\r\nmiles north of Teressa. The reason of this restriction is explained by a\r\npopular legend, according to which in remote ages the Great Unknown\r\ndecreed that, on pain of sudden death, an earthquake, or some such\r\ncalamity, the making of earthenware was to be carried on only in Chowra,\r\nand all the work of preparing the clay, moulding and firing the pots,\r\nwas to devolve on the women. Once, a long time ago, one of these women,\r\nwhen on a visit in another island, began, heedless of the divine\r\ninjunction, to make a vessel, and fell dead on the spot. Thus was\r\nconfirmed the tradition, and no attempt has since been made to infringe\r\nthe \"Chowra monopoly[568].\"\r\n\r\nAll things considered, it may be inferred that the archipelago was\r\noriginally occupied by primitive peoples of Malayan stock now\r\nrepresented by the Shom Pen of Great Nicobar, and was afterwards\r\nre-settled on the coastlands by Indo-Chinese and Malayan intruders, who\r\nintermingled, and either extirpated or absorbed, or else drove to the\r\ninterior the first occupants. Nicobar thus resembles Formosa in its\r\nintermediate position between the continental and Oceanic Mongol\r\npopulations. Another point of analogy is the absence of Negritoes from\r\nboth of these insular areas, where anthropologists had confidently\r\nanticipated the presence of a dark element like that of the Andamanese\r\nand Philippine Aeta.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[492] Here E. T. Hamy finds connecting links between the true Malays and\r\nthe Indonesians in the Bicols of Albay and the Bisayas of Panay (\"Les\r\nRaces Malaiques et Americaines,\" in _L'Anthropologie_, 1896, p. 136).\r\nUsed in this extended sense, Hamy's _Malaique_ corresponds generally to\r\nour _Malayan_ as defined presently.\r\n\r\n[493] Ethnically Malayo-Polynesian is an impossible expression, because\r\nit links together the Malays, who belong to the Mongol, and the\r\nPolynesians, who belong to the Caucasic division. But as both\r\nundoubtedly speak languages of the same linguistic stock the expression\r\nis permitted in philology, although, as P. W. Schmidt points out,\r\n\"Malay\" and \"Polynesian\" are not of equal rank: and the combination is\r\nas unbalanced as \"Indo-Bavarian\" for \"Indo-Germanic\"; it is best\r\ntherefore to adopt Schmidt's term _Austronesian_ for this family of\r\nlanguages (_Die Mon-Khmer Voelker_, 1906, p. 69).\r\n\r\n[494] Indonesian type: undulating black hair, often tinged with red;\r\ntawny skin, often rather light; low stature, 1.54 m.-1.57 m. (5 ft.\r\n0-1/2 in.-5 ft. 1-3/4 in.); mesaticephalic head (76-78) probably\r\noriginally dolichocephalic; cheek-bones sometimes projecting; nose often\r\nflattened, sometimes concave. It is difficult to isolate this type as it\r\nhas almost everywhere been mixed with a brachycephalic Proto-Malay\r\nstock, but the Muruts of Borneo (cranial index 73) are probably typical\r\n(A. C. Haddon, _The Races of Man_, 1909, p. 14).\r\n\r\n[495] Recent literature on this area includes F. A. Swettenham, _The\r\nReal Malay_, 1900, _British Malaya_, 1906; W. W. Skeat, _Malay Magic_,\r\n1900; N. Annandale and H. C. Robinson, _Fasciculi Malayenses_, 1903; W.\r\nW. Skeat and C. O. Blagden, _Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula_, 1903.\r\n\r\n[496] J.

It was interesting to\r\nnotice the very marked Mongolic features of these natives, vividly\r\nrecalling the remark of A. R. Wallace, on the difficulty of\r\ndistinguishing between a Javanese and a Chinaman when both are dressed\r\nalike. The resemblance may to a small extent be due to \"mixture with\r\nChinese blood\" (B. Hagen, _Jour. Anthrop. Soc._ Vienna, 1889); but\r\noccurs over such a wide area that it must mainly be attributed to the\r\ncommon origin of the Chinese and Javanese peoples.\r\n\r\n[501] A. H.

Amongst the points of\r\nclose resemblance may be mentioned the outriggers, for which Mentawi has\r\nthe same word (_abak_) as the Samoan (_va'r_ = _vaka_); the funeral\r\nrites; taboo; the facial expression; and the language, in which the\r\nnumerical systems are identical; cf. Ment. _limongapula_ with Sam.\r\n_limagafulu_, the Malay being _limapulah_ (fifty), where the Sam. infix\r\n_ga_ (absent in Malay) is pronounced _gna_, exactly as in Ment.\r\n\r\n[528] See Fr. Mueller, _Ueber den Ursprung der Schrift der Malaiischen\r\nVoelker_, Vienna, 1865; and my Appendix to Stanford's _Australasia_,\r\nFirst Series, 1879, p. 624.\r\n\r\n[529] _Die Mangianenschrift von Mindoro, herausgegeben von A.

The suggestion that it\r\nmay have been introduced by the Phoenician crews of Alexander's admiral,\r\nNearchus (_Archaeol. Oxon._ 1895, No. 6), could not have been made by\r\nanyone aware of its close connection with the Lampong of South, and the\r\nBatta of North Sumatra (see also Prof. Kern, _Globus_, 70, p. 116).\r\n\r\n[531] Sing. _Batta_, pl. _Battak_, hence the current form _Battaks_ is a\r\nsolecism, and we should write either _Battas_ or _Battak_. Lassen\r\nderives the word from the Sanskrit _b'hata_, \"savage.\"\r\n\r\n[532] Again confirmed by Volz and H. von Autenrieth, who explored\r\nBattaland early in 1898, and penetrated to the territory of the\r\n\"Cannibal Pakpaks\" (_Geogr. Journ._, June, 1898, p. 672); not however\r\n\"for the first time,\" as here stated. The Pakpaks had already been\r\nvisited in 1853 by Von Rosenberg, who found cannibalism so prevalent\r\nthat \"Niemand Anstand nimmt das essen von Menschenfleisch einzugestehen\"\r\n(_op. cit._ 1. p. 56).\r\n\r\n[533] It is interesting to note that by the aid of the Lampong alphabet,\r\nSouth Sumatra, John Mathew reads the word _Daibattah_ in the legend on\r\nthe head-dress of a gigantic figure seen by Sir George Grey on the roof\r\nof a cave on the Glenelg river, North-west Australia (\"The Cave\r\nPaintings of Australia,\" etc., in _Journ. Anthr. Inst._ 1894, p. 44\r\nsq.). He quotes from Coleman's _Mythology of the Hindus_ the statement\r\nthat \"the Battas of Sumatra believe in the existence of one supreme\r\nbeing, whom they name _Debati Hasi Asi_. Since completing the work of\r\ncreation they suppose him to have remained perfectly quiescent, having\r\nwholly committed the government to his three sons, who do not govern in\r\nperson, but by vakeels or proxies.\" Here is possibly another\r\nconfirmation of the view that early Malayan migrations or expeditions,\r\nsome even to Australia, took place in pre-Muhammadan times, long before\r\nthe rise and diffusion of the Orang-Malayu in the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n[534] _Memoir of the Life etc. of Sir T.

Their domain is roughly separated from that of the\r\nSouthern Mongols (Chap. VI.) by the Great Wall and the Kuen-lun range,\r\nbeyond which it spreads out westwards over most of Western Asia, and a\r\nconsiderable part of North Europe, with many scattered groups in Central\r\nand South Russia, the Balkan Peninsula, and the Middle Danube basin. In\r\nthe extreme north their territory stretches from the shores of the\r\nPacific with Japan and parts of Sakhalin continually westwards across\r\nKorea, Siberia, Central and North Russia to Finland and Lapland. But its\r\nsouthern limits can be indicated only approximately by a line drawn from\r\nthe Kuen-lun range westwards along the northern escarpments of the\r\nIranian plateau, and round the southern shores of the Caspian to the\r\nMediterranean. This line, however, must be drawn in such a way as to\r\ninclude Afghan Turkestan, much of the North Persian and Caucasian\r\nsteppes, and nearly the whole of Asia Minor, while excluding Armenia,\r\nKurdestan, and Syria.\r\n\r\nNor is it to be supposed that even within these limits the North Mongol\r\nterritory is everywhere continuous. In East Europe especially, where\r\nthey are for the most part comparatively recent intruders, the Mongols\r\nare found only in isolated and vanishing groups in the Lower and Middle\r\nVolga basin, the Crimea, and the North Caucasian steppe, and in more\r\ncompact bodies in Rumelia, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Throughout all these\r\ndistricts, however, the process of absorption or assimilation to the\r\nnormal European physical type is so far completed that many of the Nogai\r\nand other Russian \"Tartars,\" as they are called, the Volga and Baltic\r\nFinns, the Magyars, and Osmanli Turks, would scarcely be recognised as\r\nmembers of the North Mongol family but for their common Finno-Turki\r\nspeech, and the historic evidence by which their original connection\r\nwith this division is established beyond all question.\r\n\r\nIn Central Asia also (North Irania, the Aralo-Caspian and Tarim basins)\r\nthe Mongols have been in close contact with Caucasic peoples probably\r\nsince the New Stone Age, and here intermediate types have been\r\ndeveloped, by which an almost unbroken transition has been brought about\r\nbetween the yellow and the white races.\r\n\r\nDuring recent years much light has been shed on the physiographical\r\nconditions of Central Asia in early times. Stein's[570] explorations in\r\n1900-1 and 1906-8 in Chinese Turkestan, the Pumpelly Expeditions[571] in\r\n1903 and 1904 in Russian Turkestan, the travels of Sven Hedin[572] in\r\n1899-1902, and 1906-8, of Carruthers[573] in N.W. Mongolia, and the\r\nresearches of Ellsworth Huntington[574] (a member of the first Pumpelly\r\nExpedition) in 1905-7 all bear testimony to the variation in climate\r\nwhich the districts of Central Asia have undergone since glacial times.\r\nThere has been a general trend towards arid conditions, alternating with\r\nperiods of greater humidity, when tracts, now deserted, were capable of\r\nmaintaining a dense population. Abundant evidence of man's occupation\r\nhas been found in delta oases formed by snow-fed mountain streams, or on\r\nthe banks of vanished rivers, where now-a-days all is desolation,\r\nthough, as T. Peisker[575] points out, climate was not the sole or even\r\nthe main factor in many areas. In some places, as at Merv, the earliest\r\noccupation was only a few centuries before the Christian era, but at\r\nAnau near Askhabad some 300 miles east of the Caspian, explored by the\r\nPumpelly Expedition, the earliest strata contained remains of Stone Age\r\nculture. The North Kurgan or tumulus, rising some 40 or 50 feet above\r\nthe plain, showed a definite stratification of structures in sun-dried\r\nbricks, raised by successive generations of occupants. H. Schmidt, who\r\nwas in charge of the excavations, was able to collect a valuable series\r\nof potsherds, showing a gradual evolution in form, technique and\r\nornamentation, from the earliest to the latest periods. One point of\r\ngreat significance for establishing cultural if not physical\r\nrelationships in this obscure region is the resemblance between the\r\ngeometrical designs on pots of the early period and similar pottery\r\nfound by MM. Gautier and Lampre[576] at Mussian, and by M. J. de\r\nMorgan[576] at Susa, while clay figurines from the South Kurgan (copper\r\nculture) are clearly of Babylonian type, the influence of which is seen\r\nmuch later in terra-cotta figurines discovered by Stein[577] at Yotkan.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of archaeological research, it becomes daily more\r\nevident that the whole of the North Mongol domain, from Finland to\r\nJapan, has passed through the Stone and Metal Ages, like most other\r\nhabitable parts of the globe. During his wanderings in Siberia and\r\nMongolia in the early nineties, Hans Leder[578] came upon countless\r\nprehistoric stations, kurgans (barrows), stone circles, and many\r\nmegalithic monuments of various types. In West Siberia the barrows,\r\nwhich consist solely of earth without any stone-work, are by the present\r\ninhabitants called _Chudskiye Kurgani_, \"Chudish Graves,\" and, as in\r\nNorth Russia, this term \"Chude\" is ascribed to a now vanished unknown\r\nrace which formerly inhabited the land. To them, as to the \"Toltecs\" in\r\nCentral America, all ancient monuments are credited, and while some\r\nregard them as prehistoric Finns, others identify them with the historic\r\nScythians, the Scythians of Herodotus.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons, however, for thinking that the Chudes may represent\r\nan earlier race, the men of the Stone Age, who, migrating from north\r\nEurope eastwards, had reached the Tom valley (which drains to the Obi)\r\nbefore the extinction of the mammoth, and later spread over the whole of\r\nnorthern Asia, leaving everywhere evidence of their presence in the\r\nmegalithic monuments now being daily brought to light in East Siberia,\r\nMongolia, Korea, and Japan. This view receives support from the\r\ncharacters of two skulls found in 1895 by A. P. Mostitz in one of the\r\nfive prehistoric stations on the left bank of the Sava affluent of the\r\nSelenga river, near Ust-Kiakta in Trans-Baikalia. They differ markedly\r\nfrom the normal Buryat (Siberian Mongol) type, recalling rather the\r\nlong-shaped skulls of the South Russian kurgans, with cephalic indices\r\n73.2 and 73.5, as measured by M. J. D. Talko-Hryncewicz[579]. Thus, in\r\nthe very heart of the Mongol domain, the characteristically round-headed\r\nrace would appear to have been preceded, as in Europe, by a long-headed\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nIn East Siberia, and especially in the Lake Baikal region, Leder found\r\nextensive tracts strewn with kurgans, many of which have already been\r\nexplored, and their contents deposited in the Irkutsk museum. Amongst\r\nthese are great numbers of stone implements, and objects made of bone\r\nand mammoth tusks, besides carefully worked copper ware, betraying\r\ntechnical skill and some artistic taste in the designs. In\r\nTrans-Baikalia, still farther east, with the kurgans are associated the\r\nso-called _Kameni Babi_, \"Stone Women,\" monoliths rough-hewn in the form\r\nof human figures. Many of these monoliths bear inscriptions, which,\r\nhowever, appear to be of recent date (mostly Buddhist prayers and\r\nformularies), and are not to be confounded with the much older rock\r\ninscriptions deciphered by W. Thomsen through the Turki language.\r\n\r\nContinuing his investigations in Mongolia proper, Leder here also\r\ndiscovered earthen kurgans, which, however, differed from those of\r\nSiberia by being for the most part surmounted either with circular or\r\nrectangular stone structures, or else with monoliths. They are called\r\n_Kueruektsur_ by the present inhabitants, who hold them in great awe, and\r\nnever venture to touch them. Unfortunately strangers also are unable to\r\nexamine their contents, all disturbance of the ground with spade or\r\nshovel being forbidden under pain of death by the Chinese officials, for\r\nfear of awakening the evil spirits, now slumbering peacefully below the\r\nsurface. The Siberian burial mounds have yielded no bronze, a fact which\r\nindicates considerable antiquity, although no date can be set for its\r\nintroduction into these regions. Better evidence of antiquity is found\r\nin the climatic changes resulting in recent desiccation, which must\r\nhave taken place here as elsewhere, for the burials bear witness to the\r\nexistence of a denser population than could be supported at the present\r\ntime[580].\r\n\r\nSuch an antiquity is indeed required to explain the spread of neolithic\r\nremains to the Pacific seaboard, and especially to Korea and Japan. In\r\nKorea W. Gowland examined a dolmen 30 miles from Seul, which he\r\ndescribes and figures[581], and which is remarkable especially for the\r\ndisproportionate size of the capstone, a huge undressed megalith 14-1/2\r\nby over 13 feet. He refers to four or five others, all in the northern\r\npart of the peninsula, and regards them as \"intermediate in form between\r\na cist and a dolmen.\" But he thinks it probable that they were never\r\ncovered by mounds, but always stood as monuments above ground, in this\r\nrespect differing from the Japanese, the majority of which are all\r\nburied in tumuli. In some of their features these present a curious\r\nresemblance to the Brittany structures, but no stone implements appear\r\nto have been found in any of the burial mounds, and the Japanese\r\nchambered tombs, according to Hamada, Professor of Archaeology in Kyoto\r\nUniversity, are usually attributed to the Iron Age (fifth to seventh\r\ncenturies A.D.[582]).\r\n\r\nIn many districts Japan contains memorials of a remote past--shell\r\nmounds, cave-dwellings, and in Yezo certain pits, which are not occupied\r\nby the present Ainu population, but are by them attributed to the\r\n_Koro-pok-guru_, \"People of the Hollows,\" who occupied the land before\r\ntheir arrival, and lived in huts built over these pits. Similar remains\r\non an islet near Nemuro on the north-east coast of Yezo are said by the\r\nJapanese to have belonged to the _Kobito_, a dwarfish race exterminated\r\nby the Ainu, hence apparently identical with the Koro-pok-guru. They are\r\nassociated by John Milne with some primitive peoples of the Kurile\r\nIslands, Sakhalin, and Kamchatka, who, like the Eskimo of the American\r\ncoast, had extended formerly much farther south than at present.\r\n\r\nIn a kitchen-midden, 330 by 200 feet, near Shiidzuka in the province of\r\nIbaraki, the Japanese antiquaries S. Yagi and M. Shinomura[583] have\r\nfound numerous objects belonging to the Stone Age of Japan. Amongst them\r\nwere flint implements, worked bones, ashes, pottery, and a whole series\r\nof clay figures of human beings. The finders suggest that these remains\r\nmay have belonged to a homogeneous race of the Stone Period, who,\r\nhowever, were not the ancestors of the Ainu--hitherto generally regarded\r\nas the first inhabitants of Japan. In the national records vague\r\nreference is made to other aborigines, such as the \"Long Legs,\" and the\r\n\"Eight Wild Tribes,\" described as the enemies of the first Japanese\r\nsettlers in Kiu-shiu, and reduced by Jimmu Tenno, the semi-mythical\r\nfounder of the present dynasty; the _Ebisu_, who are probably to be\r\nidentified with the Ainu; and the _Seki-Manzi_, \"Stone-Men,\" also\r\nlocated in the southern island of Kiu-shiu. The last-mentioned, of whom,\r\nhowever, little further is known, seem to have some claim to be\r\nassociated with the above described remains of early man in Japan[584].\r\n\r\nIn the extreme west the present Mongol peoples, being quite recent\r\nintruders, can in no way be connected with the abundant prehistoric\r\nrelics daily brought to light in that region (South Russia, the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, Hungary). The same remark applies even to Finland itself,\r\nwhich was at one time supposed to be the cradle of the Finnish people,\r\nbut is now shown to have been first occupied by Germanic tribes. From an\r\nexhaustive study of the bronze-yielding tumuli A. Hackman[585] concludes\r\nthat the population of the Bronze Period was Teutonic, and in this he\r\nagrees both with Montelius and with W. Thomsen. The latter holds on\r\nlinguistic grounds that at the beginning of the new era the Finns still\r\ndwelt east of the Gulf of Finland, whence they moved west in later\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that, owing probably to the character of the country,\r\nremains of the Stone Age in Babylonia are wanting so that no comparison\r\ncan yet be made with the neolithic cultures of Egypt and the Aegean. The\r\nconstant floods to which Babylonia was ever subject swept away all\r\ntraces of early occupations until the advent of the Sumerians, who built\r\ntheir cities on artificial mounds. The question of Akkado-Sumerian[586]\r\norigins is by no means clear, for many important cities are unexplored\r\nand even unidentified, but the general trend of recent opinion may be\r\nnoted. The linguistic problem is peculiarly complicated by the fact that\r\nalmost all the Sumerian texts show evidence of Semitic influence, and\r\nconsist to a great extent of religious hymns and incantations which\r\noften appear to be merely translations of Semitic ideas turned by\r\nSemitic priests into the formal religious Sumerian language. J. Halevy,\r\nindeed, followed by others, regarded Sumerian as no true language, but\r\nmerely a priestly system of cryptography[587], based on Semitic. As\r\nregards linguistic affinities, K. A. Hermann[588] endeavoured to\r\nestablish a connection between the early texts and Ural-Altaic, more\r\nespecially with Ugro-Finnish. A more recent suggestion that the language\r\nis of Indo-European origin and structure rests on equally slight\r\nresemblances. The comparison with Chinese has already been noticed. J.\r\nD. Prince[589] utters a word of caution against comparing ancient texts\r\nwith idioms of more recent peoples of Western Asia, in spite of many\r\ntempting resemblances, and claims that until further light has been shed\r\non the problem Sumerian should be regarded as standing quite alone, \"a\r\nprehistoric philological remnant.\"\r\n\r\nE. Meyer[590] claims for the Sumerians not only linguistic but also\r\nphysical isolation. The Sumerian type as represented on the monuments\r\nshows a narrow pointed nose, with straight bridge and small nostrils,\r\ncheeks and lips not fleshy, like the Semites, with prominent\r\ncheek-bones, small mouth, narrow lips finely curved, the lower jaw very\r\nshort, with angular sharply projecting chin, oblique Mongolian eyes, low\r\nforehead, usually sloping away directly from the root of the nose. In\r\nfact the nose has almost the appearance of a bird's beak, projecting far\r\nin advance of mouth and chin, while the forehead almost disappears. The\r\nhair and beard are closely shaven. The Sumerians were undoubtedly a\r\nwarlike people, fighting not like the Semites in loosely extended battle\r\narray, but in close phalanx, their large shields protecting their bodies\r\nfrom neck to feet, forming a rampart beyond which projected the inclined\r\nspears of the foremost rank. Battle axe and javelin were also used.\r\nHelmets protected head and neck. Besides lance or spear the royal\r\nleaders carried a curved throwing weapon, formed of three strands bound\r\ntogether at intervals with thongs of leather or bands of metal; this\r\nseems to have developed later into a sign of authority and hence into a\r\nsceptre. The bow, the typical weapon of the Semites and the mountainous\r\npeople to the east, was unrepresented. The gods carried clubs with stone\r\nheads. It is important to notice that, in direct contrast to the\r\nSumerians themselves, their gods had abundant hair on their heads,\r\ncarefully curled and dressed, and a long curly beard on the chin, though\r\ncheeks and lips were closely shaven; these fashions recall those of the\r\nSemites. Thus, although the general view is to regard the Sumerians as\r\nthe autochthones and the Semites as the later intruders in Babylonia,\r\nthe Semitic character of the Sumerian gods points to an opposite\r\nconclusion. But the time has not yet come for any definite conclusion to\r\nbe reached. All that can be said is that according to our present\r\nknowledge the assumption that the earliest population was Sumerian and\r\nthat the Semites were the conquering intruders is only slightly more\r\nprobable than the reverse[591].\r\n\r\nRecent archaeological discoveries make Sumerian origins a little\r\nclearer. Explorations in Central Asia (as mentioned above p. 257) show\r\nthat districts once well watered, and capable of supporting a large\r\npopulation, have been subject to periods of excessive drought, and this\r\nno doubt is the prime cause of the racial unrest which has ever been\r\ncharacteristic of the dwellers in these regions. A cycle of drought may\r\nwell have prompted the Sumerian migration of the fourth millennium B.C.,\r\nas it is shown to have prompted the later invasions of the last two\r\nthousand years[592]. Although there is no evidence to connect the\r\noriginal home of the Sumerians with any of the oases yet excavated in\r\nCentral Asia, yet signs of cultural contact are not wanting, and it may\r\nsafely be inferred that their civilisation was evolved in some region to\r\nthe east of the Euphrates valley before their entrance into\r\nBabylonia[593].\r\n\r\nSince Semitic influence was first felt in the north of Babylonia, at\r\nAkkad, it is assumed that the immigration was from the north-west from\r\nArabia by way of the Syrian coastlands, and in this case also the\r\nimpulse may have been the occurrence of an arid period in the centre of\r\nthe Arabian continent. The Semites are found not as barbarian invaders,\r\nbut as a highly cultivated people. They absorbed several cultural\r\nelements of the Sumerians, notably their script, and were profoundly\r\ninfluenced by Sumerian religion. The Akkadians are represented with\r\nelaborately curled hair and beard, and hence, in contradistinction to\r\nthe shaven Sumerians, are referred to as \"the black-headed ones.\" Their\r\nchief weapon was the bow, but they had also lances and battle axes. As\r\namong the Sumerians the sign of kingship was a boomerang-like\r\nsceptre[594]. Except for Babylon and Sippar, which throw little light on\r\nthe early periods, no systematic excavation has been undertaken in\r\nnorthern Babylonia, and the site of Akkad is still unidentified.\r\n\r\nThe chronology of this early age of Babylonia is much disputed. The very\r\nhigh dates of 5000 or 6000 B.C. formerly assigned by many writers to the\r\nearliest remains of the Sumerians and the Babylonian Semites, depended\r\nto a great extent on the statement of Nabonidus (556 B.C.) that 3200\r\nyears separated his own age from that of Naram-Sin, the son of Sargon of\r\nAgade; for to Sargon, on this statement alone, a date of 3800 has\r\nusually been assigned[595]. This date presents many difficulties,\r\nleaving many centuries unrepresented by any royal names or records. Even\r\nthe suggested emendation of the text reducing the estimate by a thousand\r\nyears is not generally acceptable. Most authorities hesitate to date any\r\nBabylonian records before 3000 B.C.[596] and agree that the time has not\r\narrived for fixing any definite dates for the early period.\r\n\r\nDespite the legendary matter associated with his memory,\r\nShar-Gani-sharri, commonly called Sargon of Akkad, about 2500 B.C.\r\n(Meyer), 2650 B.C. (King), was beyond question a historical person\r\nthough it seems that there has been some confusion with Sharru-gi, or\r\nSharrukin, also called Sargon, earliest king of Kish[597]. Tradition\r\nrecords how his mother, a royal princess, concealed his birth by placing\r\nhim in a rush basket closed with bitumen and sending him adrift on the\r\nstream, from which he was rescued by Akki the water-carrier, who brought\r\nhim up as his own child. The incident, about which there is nothing\r\nmiraculous, presents a curious parallel to, if it be not the source of,\r\nsimilar tales related of Moses, Cyrus, and other ancient leaders of men.\r\nSargon also tells us that he ruled from his capital, Agade, for 45 years\r\nover Upper and Lower Mesopotamia, governed the black-headed ones, as the\r\nAkkads are constantly called, rode in bronze chariots over rugged lands,\r\nand made expeditions thrice to the sea-coast. The expeditions are\r\nconfirmed by inscriptions from Syria, though the cylinder of his son,\r\nNaram-Sin, found by Cesnola in Cyprus, is now regarded as of later\r\ndate[598]. As they also penetrated to Sinai their influence appears to\r\nhave extended over the whole of Syria and North Arabia. They erected\r\ngreat structures at Nippur, which was at that time so ancient that\r\nNaram-Sin's huge brick platform stood on a mass 30 feet thick of the\r\naccumulated debris of earlier buildings. Among the most interesting of\r\nrecent discoveries at Nippur are pre-Semitic tablets containing accounts\r\nsimilar to those recorded in the book of Genesis, from which in some\r\ncases the latter have clearly been derived. The \"Deluge Fragment\"\r\npublished in 1910 relates the warning given by the god Ea to\r\nUtnapishtim, the Babylonian Noah, and the directions for building a ship\r\nby means of which he and his family may escape, together with the beasts\r\nof the field and the birds of heaven[599]. A still later discovery\r\nagrees more closely with the Bible version, giving the name of the one\r\npious man as Tagtog, Semitic Nuhu, and assigning nine months as the\r\nperiod of the duration of the flood. The same tablet also contains an\r\naccount of the Fall of Man; but it is Noah, not Adam, who is tempted\r\nand falls, and the forbidden fruit is cassia[600].\r\n\r\nSennacherib's grandson, Ashurbanipal, who belongs to the late Assyrian\r\nempire when the centre of power had been shifted from Babylonia to\r\nNineveh, has left recorded on his brick tablets how he overran Elam and\r\ndestroyed its capital, Susa (645 B.C.). He states that from this place\r\nhe brought back the effigy of the goddess, Nana, which had been carried\r\naway from her temple at Erech by an Elamite king by whom Akkad had been\r\nconquered 1635 years before, _i.e._ 2280 B.C. Over Akkad Elam ruled 300\r\nyears, and it was a king of this dynasty, Khudur-Lagamar, who has been\r\nidentified by T. G. Pinches with the \"Chedorlaomer, king of Elam\" routed\r\nby Abraham (Gen. xiv. 14-17)[601]. Thus is explained the presence of\r\nElamites at this time so far west as Syria, their own seat being amid\r\nthe Kurdish mountains in the Upper Tigris basin.\r\n\r\nThe Elamites do not appear to have been of the same stock as the\r\nSumerians. They are described as peaceful, industrious, and skilful\r\nhusbandmen, with a surprising knowledge of irrigating processes. The\r\nnon-Semitic language shows possible connections with Mitanni[602]. Yet\r\nthe type would appear to be on the whole rather Semitic, judging at\r\nleast from the large arched nose and thick beard of the Susian god,\r\nRamman, brought by Ashurbanipal out of Elam, and figured in Layard's\r\n_Monuments of Nineveh_, 1st Series, Plate 65. This, however, may be\r\nexplained by the fact that the Elamites were subdued at an early date by\r\nintruding Semites, although they afterwards shook off the yoke and\r\nbecame strong enough to conquer Mesopotamia and extend their expeditions\r\nto Syria and the Jordan. The capital of Elam was the renowned city of\r\nSusa (Shushan, whence Susiana, the modern Khuzistan). Recent\r\nexcavations show that the settlement dates from neolithic times[603].\r\n\r\nEven after the capture of Susa by Ashurbanipal, Elam again rose to great\r\npower under Cyrus the Great, who, however, was no Persian adventurer, as\r\nstated by Herodotus, but the legitimate Elamite ruler, as inscribed on\r\nhis cylinder and tablet now in the British Museum:--\"Cyrus, the great\r\nking, the king of Babylon, the king of Sumir and Akkad, the king of the\r\nfour zones, the son of Kambyses, the great king, the king of Elam, the\r\ngrandson of Cyrus the great king,\" who by the favour of Merodach has\r\novercome the black-headed people (_i.e._ the Akkads) and at last entered\r\nBabylon in peace. On an earlier cylinder Nabonidus, last king of\r\nBabylon, tells us how this same Cyrus subdued the Medes--here called\r\n_Mandas_, \"Barbarians\"--and captured their king Astyages and his capital\r\nEkbatana. But although Cyrus, hitherto supposed to be a Persian and a\r\nZoroastrian monotheist, here appears as an Elamite and a polytheist, \"it\r\nis pretty certain that although descended from Elamite kings, these were\r\n[at that time] kings of Persian race, who, after the destruction of the\r\nold [Elamite] monarchy by Ashurbanipal, had established a new dynasty at\r\nthe city of Susa. Cyrus always traces his descent from Achaemenes, the\r\nchief of the leading Persian clan of Pasargadae[604].\" Hence although\r\nwrong in speaking of Cyrus as an adventurer, Herodotus rightly calls him\r\na Persian, and at this late date Elam itself may well have been already\r\nAryanised in speech[605], while still retaining its old Sumerian\r\nreligion. The Babylonian pantheon survived, in fact, till the time of\r\nDarius Hystaspes, who introduced Zoroastrianism with its supreme gods,\r\nAhura-Mazda, creator of all good, and Ahriman, author of all evil.\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to gain some idea of the gradual growth of the city\r\nstates of Babylonia. Beginning with a mere collection of rude reed huts,\r\nthese were succeeded by structures of sun-dried bricks, built in a group\r\nfor mutual protection, probably around a centre of a local god, and\r\nsurrounded by a wall. The land around the settlement was irrigated by\r\ncanals, and here the corn and vegetables were grown and the flocks and\r\nherds were tended for the maintenance of the population. The central\r\nfigure was always the god, who occasionally gave his name to the site,\r\nand who was the owner of all the land, the inhabitants being merely his\r\ntenants who owed him rent for their estates. It was the god who waged\r\nwars with the neighbours, and with whom treaties were made. The treaty\r\nbetween Lagash and Umma fixing the limitations of their boundaries, a\r\nconstant matter of dispute, was made by Ningirsu, god of Lagash, and the\r\ncity god of Umma, under the arbitration of Enlil, the chief of the gods,\r\nwhose central shrine was at Nippur.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the cities disputes of territory were sure to arise,\r\nand either by conquest or amalgamation, cities became absorbed into\r\nstates. The problem then was the adjustment of the various city gods,\r\neach reigning supreme in his own city, but taking a higher or lower\r\nplace in the Babylonian pantheon. When one city gained a supremacy over\r\nall its neighbours, its governor might assume the title of king. But the\r\nking was merely the _patesi_, the steward of the city god. Even when the\r\nsupremacy was sufficiently permanent for the establishment of a dynasty,\r\nthis was a dynasty of the city rather than of a family, for the\r\nsuccessive kings were not necessarily of the same family[606].\r\n\r\nAmong the city gods who developed into powerful deities were Anu of Uruk\r\n(Erech), Enlil of Nippur and Ea of Eridu (originally a sea-port). These\r\nbecame the supreme triad, Anu ruling over the heavens, enthroned on the\r\nnorthern pole, as king and father of the gods; Enlil, the Semitic Bel,\r\ngod of earth, lord of the lands, formerly chief of all the gods; and Ea,\r\ngod of the water-depths, whose son was ultimately to eclipse his father\r\nas Marduk of Babylon. A second triad is composed of the local deities\r\nwho developed into Sin, the moon-god of Ur, Shamash the sun-god of\r\nLarsa, and the famous Ishtar, the great mother, goddess of love and\r\nqueen of heaven. The realm of the dead was a dark place under the earth,\r\nwhere the dead lived as shadows, eating the dust of the earth. Their lot\r\ndepended partly on their earlier lives, and partly on the devotion of\r\ntheir surviving relatives. Although their dead kings were deified there\r\nseems to be no evidence for a belief in a general resurrection or in the\r\ntransmigration of souls. The hymns and prayers to the gods however show\r\na very high religious level in spite of the important part played by\r\nsoothsaying and exorcism, relics of earlier culture. The permanence of\r\nthese may be partly ascribed to the essentially theocratic character of\r\nBabylonian government. The king was merely the agent of the god, whose\r\ndesires were interpreted by the priestly soothsayers and exorcists, and\r\nno action could be undertaken in worldly or in religious concerns\r\nwithout their superintendence. The kings occasionally attempted to free\r\nthemselves from the power of the priests, but the attempt was always\r\nvain. The power of the priests had often a sound economic basis, for the\r\ntemples of the great cities were centres of vast wealth and of\r\nfar-reaching trade, as is proved by the discovery of the commercial\r\ncontracts stored in the temple archives[607].\r\n\r\nHow the family expands through the clan and tribe into the nation, is\r\nclearly seen in the Babylonian social system, in which the inhabitants\r\nof each city were still \"divided into clans, all of whose members\r\nclaimed to be descended from a common ancestor who had flourished at a\r\nmore or less remote period. The members of each clan were by no means\r\nall in the same social position, some having gone down in the world,\r\nothers having raised themselves; and amongst them we find many different\r\ncallings--from agricultural labourers to scribes, and from merchants to\r\nartisans. No natural tie existed among the majority of these members\r\nexcept the remembrance of their common origin, perhaps also a common\r\nreligion, and eventual rights of succession or claims upon what belonged\r\nto each one individually[608].\" The god or goddess, it is suggested, who\r\nwatched over each man, and of whom each was the son, was originally the\r\ngod or goddess of the clan (its totem). So also in Egypt, the members of\r\nthe community were all supposed to come of the same stock (_pait_), and\r\nto belong to the same family (_paitu_), whose chiefs (_ropaitu_) were\r\nthe guardians of the family, several groups of such families being under\r\na _ropaitu-ha_, or head chief[609].\r\n\r\nAmongst the local institutions, it is startling to find a fully\r\ndeveloped ground-landlord system, though not quite so bad as that still\r\npatiently endured in England, already flourishing ages ago in Babylonia.\r\n\"The cost of repairs fell usually on the lessee, who was also allowed to\r\nbuild on the land he had leased, in which case it was declared free of\r\nall charges for a period of about ten years; but the house and, as a\r\nrule, all he had built, then reverted to the landlord[610].\"\r\n\r\nIn many other respects great progress had been made, and it is the\r\nbelief of von Ihring[611], Hommel[612] and others that from Babylonia\r\nwas first diffused a knowledge of letters, astronomy, agriculture,\r\nnavigation, architecture, and other arts, to the Nile valley, and mainly\r\nthrough Egypt to the Western World, and through Irania to China and\r\nIndia. In this generalisation there is probably a large measure of\r\ntruth, although it will be seen farther on that the Asiatic origin of\r\nEgyptian culture is still far from being proved[613].\r\n\r\nOne element the two peoples certainly had in common--a highly developed\r\nagricultural system, which formed the foundation of their greatness, and\r\nwas maintained in a rainless climate by a stupendous system of\r\nirrigation works. Such works were carried out on a prodigious scale by\r\nthe ancient Babylonians six or eight thousand years ago. The plains of\r\nthe Lower Euphrates and Tigris, since rendered desolate under Turkish\r\nmisrule, are intersected by the remains of an intricate network of\r\ncanalisation covering all the space between the two rivers, and are\r\nstrewn with the ruins of many great cities, whose inhabitants, numbering\r\nscores of thousands, were supported by the produce of a highly\r\ncultivated region, which is now an arid waste varied only by crumbling\r\nmounds, stagnant waters, and the camping-grounds of a few Arab\r\ntent-dwellers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose who attach weight to distinctive racial qualities have always\r\nfound a difficulty in attributing this wonderful civilisation to the\r\nsame Mongolic people, who in their own homes have scarcely anywhere\r\nadvanced beyond the hunting, fishing, or pastoral states. But it has\r\nalways to be remembered that man, like all other zoological forms,\r\nnecessarily reflects the character of his environment. The Mongols might\r\nin time become agriculturalists in the alluvial Mesopotamian lands,\r\nthough the kindred people who give their name to the whole ethnical\r\ndivision and present its physical characters in an exaggerated form,\r\never remain tented nomads on the dry Central Asiatic steppe, which\r\nyields little but herbage, and is suitable for tillage only in a few\r\nmore favoured districts. Here the typical Mongols, cut off from the\r\narable lands of South Siberia by the Tian-shan and Altai ranges, and to\r\nsome extent denied access to the rich fluvial valleys of the Middle\r\nKingdom by the barrier of the Great Wall, have for ages led a pastoral\r\nlife in the inhabitable tracts and oases of the Gobi wilderness and the\r\nOrdos region within the great bend of the Hoang-ho. During the historic\r\nperiod these natural and artificial ramparts have been several times\r\nsurmounted by fierce Mongol hordes, pouring like irresistible\r\nflood-waters over the whole of China and many parts of Siberia, and\r\nextending their predatory or conquering expeditions across the more open\r\nnorthern plains westwards nearly to the shores of the Atlantic. But such\r\ndevastating torrents, which at intervals convulsed and caused\r\ndislocations amongst half the settled populations of the globe, had\r\nlittle effect on the tribal groups that remained behind. These continued\r\nand continue to occupy the original camping-grounds, as changeless and\r\nuniform in their physical appearance, mental characters, and social\r\nusages as the Arab bedouins and all other inhabitants of monotonous\r\nundiversified steppe lands.\r\n\r\nDe Ujfalvy's suggestion that the typical Mongols of the plains, with\r\nwhom we are now dealing, were originally a long-headed race, can\r\nscarcely be taken seriously. At present and, in fact, throughout\r\nhistoric times, all true Mongol peoples are and have been distinguished\r\nby a high degree of brachycephaly, with cephalic index generally from 87\r\nupwards, and it may be remembered that the highest known index of any\r\nundeformed skull was that of Huxley's Mongol (98.21). But, as already\r\nnoticed, those recovered from prehistoric, or neolithic kurgans, are\r\nfound to be dolichocephalous like those of palaeolithic and early\r\nneolithic man in Europe.\r\n\r\nTaken in connection with the numerous prehistoric remains above recorded\r\nfrom all parts of Central Asia and Siberia, this fact may perhaps help\r\nto bring de Ujfalvy's view into harmony with the actual conditions.\r\nEverything will be explained by assuming that the proto-Mongolic tribes,\r\nspreading from the Tibetan plateau over the plains now bearing their\r\nname, found that region already occupied by the long-headed Caucasic\r\npeoples of the Stone Ages, whom they either exterminated or drove north\r\nto the Altai uplands, and east to Manchuria and Korea, where a strong\r\nCaucasic strain still persists. De Ujfalvy's long-heads would thus be,\r\nnot the proto-Mongols who were always round-headed, but the long-headed\r\nneolithic pre-Mongol race expelled by them from Mongolia who may\r\nprovisionally be termed proto-Nordics.\r\n\r\nThat this region has been their true home since the first migrations\r\nfrom the south there can be no doubt. Here land and people stand in the\r\nclosest relation one to the other; here every conspicuous physical\r\nfeature recalls some popular memory; every rugged crest is associated\r\nwith the name of some national hero, every lake or stream is still\r\nworshipped or held in awe as a local deity, or else the abode of the\r\nancestral shades. Here also the Mongols proper form two main divisions,\r\n_Sharra_ in the east and _Kalmuk_ in the west, while a third group, the\r\nsomewhat mixed _Buryats_, have long been settled in the Siberian\r\nprovinces of Irkutsk and Trans-Baikalia. Under the Chinese semi-military\r\nadministration all except the Buryats, who are Russian subjects, are\r\nconstituted since the seventeenth century in 41 _Aimaks_ (large tribal\r\ngroups or principalities with hereditary khans) and 226 _Koshungs_,\r\n\"Banners,\" that is, smaller groups whose chiefs are dependent on the\r\nkhans of their respective Aimaks, who are themselves directly\r\nresponsible to the imperial government. Subjoined is a table of these\r\nadministrative divisions, which present a curious but effective\r\ncombination of the tribal and political systems, analogous to the\r\narrangement in Pondoland and some other districts in Cape Colony, where\r\nthe hereditary tribal chief assumes the functions of a responsible\r\nBritish magistrate.\r\n\r\n   Tribal or Territorial          Aimaks       Koshungs\r\n         Divisions           (Principalities)  (Banners)\r\n\r\n          Khalkas                    4            86\r\n  Inner Mongolia with Ordos         25            51\r\n          Chakars                    1             8\r\n          Ala-Shan                   1             3\r\n    Koko-nor and Tsaidam             5            29\r\n          Sungaria                   4            32\r\n          Uriankhai                  1            17\r\n                                    --           ---\r\n                                    41           226\r\n\r\nSince their organisation in Aimaks and Koshungs, the Mongols have ceased\r\nto be a terror to the surrounding peoples. The incessant struggles\r\nbetween these tented warriors and the peaceful Chinese populations,\r\nwhich began long before the dawn of history, were brought to a close\r\nwith the overthrow of the Sungarian power in the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen their political cohesion was broken, and the whole nation reduced\r\nto a state of abject helplessness, from which they cannot now hope to\r\nrecover. The arm of Chinese rule could be replaced only by the firmer\r\ngrip of the northern autocrat, whose shadow already lies athwart the\r\nGobi wilderness.\r\n\r\nThus the only escape from the crushing monotony of a purely pastoral\r\nlife, no longer relieved by intervals of warlike or predatory\r\nexpeditions, lies in a survival of the old Shamanist superstitions, or a\r\nfurther development of the degrading Tibetan lamaism represented at Urga\r\nby the _Kutukhtu_, an incarnation of the Buddha only less revered than\r\nthe Dalai Lama himself[614]. Besides this High Priest at Urga, there are\r\nover a hundred smaller incarnations--_Gigens_, as they are called--and\r\nthese saintly beings possess unlimited means of plundering their\r\nvotaries. The smallest favour, the touch of their garments, a pious\r\nejaculation or blessing, is regarded as a priceless spiritual gift, and\r\nmust be paid for with costly offerings. Even the dead do not escape\r\nthese exactions. However disposed of, whether buried or cremated, like\r\nthe khans and lamas, or exposed to beasts and birds of prey, as is the\r\nfate of the common folk, \"masses,\" which also command a high price, have\r\nto be said for forty days to relieve their souls from the torments of\r\nthe Buddhist purgatory.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, which, however, may perhaps admit of explanation,\r\nthat nearly all the true Mongol peoples have been Buddhists since the\r\nspread of Sakya-Muni's teachings throughout Central Asia, while their\r\nTurki kinsmen are zealous followers of the Prophet. Thus is seen, for\r\ninstance, the strange spectacle of two Mongolic groups, the Kirghiz of\r\nthe Turki branch and the Kalmuks of the West Mongol branch, encamped\r\nside by side on the Lower Volga plains, the former all under the banner\r\nof the Crescent, the latter devout worshippers of all the incarnations\r\nof Buddha. But analogous phenomena occur amongst the European peoples,\r\nthe Teutons being mainly Protestants, those of neo-Latin speech mainly\r\nRoman Catholics, and the Easterns Orthodox. From all this, however,\r\nnothing more can be inferred than that the religions are partly a\r\nquestion of geography, partly determined by racial temperament and\r\npolitical conditions; while the religious sentiment, being universal, is\r\nabove all local or ethnical considerations.\r\n\r\nUnder the first term of the expression _Mongolo-Turki_ (p. 256) are\r\ncomprised, besides the Mongols proper, nearly all those branches of the\r\ndivision which lie to the east and north-east of Mongolia, and are in\r\nmost respects more closely allied with the Mongol than with the Turki\r\nsection. Such are the _Tunguses_, with the kindred _Manchus_, _Golds_,\r\n_Orochons_, _Lamuts_, and others of the Amur basin, the Upper Lena\r\nhead-streams, the eastern affluents of the Yenisei, and the shores of\r\nthe Sea of Okhotsk; the _Gilyaks_ about the Amur estuary and in the\r\nnorthern parts of Sakhalin; the _Kamchadales_ in South Kamchatka; in the\r\nextreme north-east the _Koryaks_, _Chukchis_, and _Yukaghirs_; lastly\r\nthe _Koreans_, _Japanese_, and _Liu-Kiu (Lu-Chu) Islanders_. To the\r\nMongol section thus belong nearly all the peoples lying between the\r\nYenisei and the Pacific (including most of the adjacent archipelagos),\r\nand between the Great Wall and the Arctic Ocean. The only two exceptions\r\nare the _Yakuts_ of the middle and Lower Lena and neighbouring Arctic\r\nrivers, who are of Turki stock; and the _Ainus_ of Yezo, South Sakhalin,\r\nand some of the Kurile Islands, who belong to the Caucasic division.\r\n\r\nM. A. Czaplicka proposes a useful classification of the various peoples\r\nof Siberia, usually grouped on account of linguistic affinities as\r\nUral-Altaians, and as \"no other part of the world presents a racial\r\nproblem of such complexity and in regard to no other part of the world's\r\ninhabitants have ethnologists of the last hundred years put forward such\r\nwidely differing hypotheses of their origin[615],\" her tabulation may\r\nserve to clear the way. She divides the whole area[616] into\r\n_Palaeo-Siberians_, representing the most ancient stock of dwellers in\r\nSiberia, and _Neo-Siberians_, comprising the various tribes of Central\r\nAsiatic origin who are sufficiently differentiated from the kindred\r\npeoples of their earlier homes as to deserve a generic name of their\r\nown. The Palaeo-Siberians thus include the _Chukchi_, _Koryak_,\r\n_Kamchadale_, _Ainu_, _Gilyak_, _Eskimo_, _Aleut_, _Yukaghir_,\r\n_Chuvanzy_ and _Ostyak_ of Yenisei. The Neo-Siberians include the Finnic\r\nTribes (Ugrian _Ostyak_, and _Vogul_), Samoyedic Tribes, Turkic Tribes\r\n(_Yakut_ and Turko-Tatars of Tobolsk and Tomsk Governments), Mongolic\r\nTribes (Western Mongols or _Kalmuk_, Eastern Mongols, and _Buryat_), and\r\nTungusic Tribes (_Tungus_, _Chapogir_, _Gold_, _Lamut_, _Manchu_,\r\n_Manyarg_, _Oroch_, _Orochon_ (\"Reindeer Tungus\"), _Oroke_).\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of the general statement that the various\r\ncultural states are a question not of race, but of environment, is\r\nafforded by the varying social conditions of the widespread Tungus\r\nfamily, who are fishers on the Arctic coast, hunters in the East\r\nSiberian woodlands, and for the most part sedentary tillers of the soil\r\nand townspeople in the rich alluvial valleys of the Amur and its\r\nsouthern affluents. The Russians, from whom we get the term Tungus[617],\r\nrecognise these various pursuits, and speak of _Horse_, _Cattle_,\r\n_Reindeer_, _Dog_, _Steppe_, and _Forest_ Tunguses, besides the settled\r\nfarmers and stock-breeders of the Amur. Their original home appears to\r\nhave been the Shan-alin uplands, where they dwelt with the kindred\r\n_Niu-chi_ (Manchus) till the thirteenth century, when the disturbances\r\nbrought about by the wars and conquests of Jenghiz-Khan drove them to\r\ntheir present seat in East Siberia. The type, although essentially\r\nMongolic in the somewhat flat features, very prominent cheek-bones,\r\nslant eyes, long lank hair, yellowish brown colour and low stature,\r\nseems to show admixture with a higher race in the shapely frame, the\r\nnimble, active figure, and quick, intelligent expression, and especially\r\nin the variable skull. While generally round (indices 80 deg. to 84 deg.), the\r\nhead is sometimes flat on the top, like that of the true Mongol,\r\nsometimes high and short, which, as Hamy tells us, is specially\r\ncharacteristic of the Turki race[618].\r\n\r\nAll observers speak in enthusiastic language of the temperament and\r\nmoral qualities of the Tunguses, and particularly of those groups that\r\nroam the forests about the Tunguska tributaries of the Yenisei, which\r\ntake their name from these daring hunters and trappers. \"Full of\r\nanimation and natural impulse, always cheerful even in the deepest\r\nmisery, holding themselves and others in like respect, of gentle manners\r\nand poetic speech, obliging without servility, unaffectedly proud,\r\nscorning falsehood, and indifferent to suffering and death, the Tunguses\r\nare unquestionably an heroic people[619].\"\r\n\r\nA few have been brought within the pale of the Orthodox Church, and in\r\nthe extreme south some are classed as Buddhists. But the great bulk of\r\nthe Tungus nation are still Shamanists. Indeed the very word _Shaman_ is\r\nof Tungus origin, though current also amongst the Buryats and Yakuts. It\r\nis often taken to be the equivalent of priest; but in point of fact it\r\nrepresents a stage in the development of natural religion which has\r\nscarcely yet reached the sacerdotal state. \"Although in many cases the\r\nshamans act as priests, and take part in popular and family festivals,\r\nprayers, and sacrifices, their chief importance is based on the\r\nperformance of duties which distinguish them sharply from ordinary\r\npriests[620].\" Their functions are threefold, those of the medicine-man\r\n(the leech, or healer by supernatural means); of the soothsayer (the\r\nprophet through communion with the invisible world); and of the priest,\r\nespecially in his capacity as exorcist, and in his general power to\r\ninfluence, control, or even coerce the good and evil spirits on behalf\r\nof their votaries. But as all spirits are, or were originally,\r\nidentified with the souls of the departed, it follows that in its\r\nultimate analysis Shamanism resolves itself into a form of\r\nancestry-worship.\r\n\r\nThe system, of which there are many phases reflecting the different\r\ncultural states of its adherents, still prevails amongst all the\r\nSiberian aborigines[621], and generally amongst all the uncivilised\r\nUral-Altaic populations, so that here again the religions strictly\r\nreflect the social condition of the peoples. Thus the somewhat cultured\r\nFinns, Turks, Mongols, and Manchus are all either Christians,\r\nMuhammadans, or Buddhists; while the uncultured but closely related\r\nSamoyeds, Ostyaks, Orochons, Tunguses, Golds, Gilyaks, Koryaks, and\r\nChukchi, are almost without exception Shamanists.\r\n\r\nThe shamans do not appear to constitute a special caste or sacerdotal\r\norder, like the hierarchies of the Christian Churches. Some are\r\nhereditary, some elected by popular vote, so to say. They may be either\r\nmen, or women (_shamanka_), married or single; and if \"rank\" is spoken\r\nof, it simply means greater or less proficiency in the performance of\r\nthe duties imposed on them. Everything thus depends on their personal\r\nmerits, which naturally gives rise to much jealousy between the members\r\nof the craft. Thus amongst the \"whites\" and the \"blacks,\" that is, those\r\nwhose dealings are with the good and the bad spirits respectively, there\r\nis in some districts a standing feud, often resulting in fierce\r\nencounters and bloodshed. The Buryats tell how the two factions throw\r\naxes at each other at great distances, the struggle usually ending in\r\nthe death of one of the combatants. The blacks, who serve the evil\r\nspirits, bringing only disease, death, or ill-luck, and even killing\r\npeople by eating up their souls, are of course the least popular, but\r\nalso the most dreaded. Many are credited with extraordinary and even\r\nmiraculous powers, and there can be no doubt that they often act up to\r\ntheir reputation by performing almost incredible conjuring tricks in\r\norder to impose on the credulity of the ignorant, or outbid their rivals\r\nfor the public favour. Old Richard Johnson of Chancelour's expedition to\r\nMuscovy records how he saw a Samoyed shaman stab himself with a sword,\r\nthen make the sword red hot and thrust it through his body, so that the\r\npoint protruded at the back, and Johnson was able to touch it with his\r\nfinger. They then bound the wizard tight with a reindeer-rope, and went\r\nthrough some performances curiously like those of the Davenport brothers\r\nand other modern conjurers[622].\r\n\r\nTo the much-discussed question whether the shamans are impostors, the\r\nbest answer has perhaps been given by Castren, who, speaking of the same\r\nSamoyed magicians, remarks that if they were merely cheats, we should\r\nhave to suppose that they did not share the religious beliefs of their\r\nfellow-tribesmen, but were a sort of rationalists far in advance of the\r\ntimes. Hence it would seem much more probable that they deceived both\r\nthemselves and others[623], while no doubt many bolster up a waning\r\nreputation by playing the mountebank where there is no danger of\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\n\"Shamanism amongst the Siberian peoples,\" concludes our Russian\r\nauthority, \"is at the present time in a moribund condition; it must die\r\nout with those beliefs among which alone such phenomena can arise and\r\nflourish. Buddhism on the one hand, and Muhammadanism on the other, not\r\nto mention Christianity, are rapidly destroying the old ideas of the\r\ntribes among whom the shamans performed. Especially has the more ancient\r\nBlack Faith suffered from the Yellow Faith preached by the lamas. But\r\nthe shamans, with their dark mysterious rites, have made a good struggle\r\nfor life, and are still frequently found among the native Christians and\r\nMuhammadans. The mullahs and lamas have even been obliged to become\r\nshamans to a great extent, and many Siberian tribes, who are nominally\r\nChristians, believe in shamans, and have recourse to them.\"\r\n\r\nOf all members of the Tungusic family the Manchus alone can be called a\r\nhistorical people. If they were really descended from the _Khitans_ of\r\nthe Sungari valley, then their authentic records will date from the\r\ntenth century A.D., when these renowned warriors, after overthrowing the\r\nPu-hai (925), founded the Liao dynasty and reduced a great part of North\r\nChina and surrounding lands. The Khitans, from whom China was known to\r\nMarco Polo as _Khitai_ (Cathay), as it still is to the Russians, were\r\nconquered in 1125 by the _Niu-chi_ (_Yu-chi, Nu-chin_) of the Shan-alin\r\nuplands, reputed cradle of the Manchu race. These Niu-chi, direct\r\nancestors of the Manchus, founded (1115) the State known as that of the\r\n\"Golden Tartars,\" from _Kin_, \"gold,\" the title adopted by their chief\r\nAguta, \"because iron (in reference to the _Liao_, 'Iron' dynasty) may\r\nrust, but gold remains ever pure and bright.\" The Kins, however,\r\nretained their brightness only a little over a century, having been\r\neclipsed by Jenghiz-Khan in 1234. But about the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury the Niu-chi again rose to power under Aishiu-Gioro, who,\r\nalthough of miraculous birth and surrounded by other legendary matter,\r\nappears to have been a historical person. He may be regarded as the true\r\nfounder of the Manchu dynasty, for it was in his time that this name\r\ncame into general use. Sing-tsu, one of his descendants, constructed the\r\npalisade, a feeble imitation of the Great Wall, sections of which still\r\nexist. Thai-tsu, a still more famous member of the family, greatly\r\nextended the Manchu Kingdom (1580-1626), and it was his son Tai-dsung\r\nwho first assumed the imperial dignity under the title of Tai-Tsing.\r\nAfter his death, the Ming dynasty having been overthrown by a rebel\r\nchief, the Manchus were invited by the imperialists to aid in restoring\r\norder, entered Peking in triumph, and, finding that the last of the\r\nMings had committed suicide, placed Tai-dsung's nephew on the throne,\r\nthus founding the Manchu dynasty (1644) which lasted down to 1912.\r\n\r\nSuch has been the contribution of the Manchu people to history; their\r\ncontributions to arts, letters, science, in a word, to the general\r\nprogress of mankind, have been _nil_. They found the Middle Kingdom,\r\nafter ages of a sluggish growth, in a state of absolute stagnation, and\r\nthere they have left it. On the other hand their assumption of the\r\nimperial administration brought about their own ruin, their effacement,\r\nand almost their very extinction as a separate nationality[624].\r\nManchuria, like Mongolia, is organised in a number of half military,\r\nhalf civil divisions, the so-called _Paki_, or \"Eight Banners,\" and the\r\nconstant demand made on these reserves, to support the dynasty and\r\nsupply trustworthy garrisons for all the strongholds of the empire, has\r\ndrawn off the best blood of the people, in fact sapped its vitality at\r\nthe fountain-head. Then the rich arable tracts thus depleted were\r\ngradually occupied by agricultural settlers from the south, with the\r\nresult that the Manchu race has nearly disappeared. From the ethnical\r\nstandpoint the whole region beyond the Great Wall as far north as the\r\nAmur has practically become an integral part of China, and from the\r\npolitical standpoint since 1898 an integral part of the Russian empire.\r\nTowards the middle of the nineteenth century the Eight Banners numbered\r\nscarcely more than a quarter of a million, and about that time the Abbe\r\nHuc declared that \"the Manchu nationality is destroyed beyond recovery.\r\nAt present we shall look in vain for a single town or a single village\r\nthroughout Manchuria which is not exclusively inhabited by Chinese. The\r\nlocal colour has been completely effaced, and except a few nomad groups\r\nnobody speaks Manchu[625].\"\r\n\r\nSimilar testimony is afforded by later observers, and Henry Lansdell,\r\namongst others, remarks that \"the Manchu, during the two centuries they\r\nhave reigned in China, may be said to have been working out their own\r\nannihilation. Their manners, language, their very country has become\r\nChinese, and some maintain that the Manchu proper are now extinct[626].\"\r\n\r\nBut the type, so far from being extinct, may be said to have received a\r\nconsiderable expansion, especially amongst the populations of north-east\r\nChina. The taller stature and greatly superior physical appearance of\r\nthe inhabitants of Tien-tsin and surrounding districts[627] over those\r\nof the southern provinces (Fokien, Kwang-tung), who are the chief\r\nrepresentatives of the Chinese race abroad, seem best explained by\r\ncontinual crossings with the neighbouring Manchu people, at least since\r\nthe twelfth century, if not earlier.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the Manchus (of the same stock says Sir H. H.\r\nHoworth, the distinction being purely political) are the _Dauri_, who\r\ngive their name to the extensive Daur plateau, and formerly occupied\r\nboth sides of the Upper Amur. Daur is, in fact, the name applied by the\r\nBuryats to all the Tungus peoples of the Amur basin. The Dauri proper,\r\nwho are now perhaps the best representatives of the original Manchu\r\ntype, would seem to have intermingled at a remote time with the\r\nlong-headed pre-Mongol populations of Central Asia. They are \"taller and\r\nstronger than the Oronchons [Tungus groups lower down the Amur]; the\r\ncountenance is oval and more intellectual, and the cheeks are less\r\nbroad. The nose is rather prominent, and the eyebrows straight. The skin\r\nis tawny, and the hair brown[628].\" Most of these characters are such as\r\nwe should expect to find in a people of mixed Mongolo-Caucasic descent,\r\nthe latter element being derived from the long-headed race who had\r\nalready reached the present Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea, and the adjacent\r\nislands during neolithic times. Thus may be explained the tall stature,\r\nsomewhat regular features, brown hair, light eyes, and even florid\r\ncomplexion so often observed amongst the present inhabitants of\r\nManchuria, Korea, and parts of North China.\r\n\r\nBut no admixture, except of Chinese literary terms, is seen in the\r\nManchu language, which, like Mongolic, is a typical member of the\r\nagglutinating Ural-Altaic family. Despite great differences, lexical,\r\nphonetic, and even structural, all the members of this widespread order\r\nof speech have in common a number of fundamental features, which justify\r\nthe assumption that all spring from an original stock language, which\r\nhas long been extinct, and the germs of which were perhaps first\r\ndeveloped on the Tibetan plateau. The essential characters of the system\r\nare:--(1) a \"root\" or notional term, generally a closed syllable,\r\nnominal or verbal, with a vowel or diphthong, strong or weak (hard or\r\nsoft) according to the meaning of the term, hence incapable of change;\r\n(2) a number of particles or relational terms somewhat loosely postfixed\r\nto the root, but incorporated with it by the principle of (3) vowel\r\nharmony, a kind of vocal concordance, in virtue of which the vowels of\r\nall the postfixes must harmonise with the unchangeable vowel of the\r\nroot. If this is strong all the following vowels of the combination, no\r\nmatter what its length, must be strong; if weak they must conform in the\r\nsame way. With nominal roots the postfixes are necessarily limited to\r\nthe expression of a few simple relations; but with verbal roots they are\r\nin principle unlimited, so that the multifarious relations of the verb\r\nto its subject and object are all incorporated in the verbal compound\r\nitself, which may thus run at times to inordinate lengths. Hence we have\r\nthe expression \"incorporating,\" commonly applied to this agglutinating\r\nsystem, which sometimes goes so far as to embody the notions of\r\ncausality, possibility, passivity, negation, intensity, condition, and\r\nso on, besides the direct pronominal objects, in one interminable\r\nconglomerate, which is then treated as a simple verb, and run through\r\nall the secondary changes of number, person, tense, and mood. The result\r\nis an endless number of theoretically possible verbal forms, which,\r\nalthough in practice naturally limited to the ordinary requirements of\r\nspeech, are far too numerous to allow of a complete verbal paradigm\r\nbeing constructed of any fully developed member of the Ural-Altaic\r\ngroup, such, for instance, as Yakut, Tungus, Turki, Mordvinian, Finnish,\r\nor Magyar.\r\n\r\nIn this system the vowels are classed as strong or hard (_a, o, u_),\r\nweak or soft (the same _umlauted_: _ae_, _oe_, _ue_), and neutral\r\n(generally _e_, _i_), these last being so called because they occur\r\nindifferently with the two other classes. Thus, if the determining root\r\nvowel is _a_ (strong), that of the postfixes may be either _a_ (strong),\r\n_e_ or _i_ (neutral); if _ae_ (weak), that of the postfixes may be either\r\n_ae_ (weak), or _e_ or _i_ as before. The postfixes themselves no doubt\r\nwere originally notional terms worn down in form and meaning, so as to\r\nexpress mere abstract relation, as in the Magyar _vel_ = with, from\r\n_veli_ = companion. Tacked on to the root _fa_ = tree, this will give\r\nthe ablative case, first unharmonised, _fa-vel_, then harmonised,\r\n_fa-val_ = tree-with, with a tree. In the early Magyar texts of the\r\ntwelfth century inharmonic compounds, such as _halal-nek_, later\r\n_halak-nak_ = at death, are numerous, from which it has been inferred\r\nthat the principle of vowel harmony is not an original feature of the\r\nUral-Altaic languages, but a later development, due in fact to phonetic\r\ndecay, and still scarcely known in some members of the group, such as\r\nVotyak and Highland Cheremissian (Volga Finn). But M. Lucien Adam holds\r\nthat these idioms have lost the principle through foreign (Russian)\r\ninfluence, and that the few traces still perceptible are survivals from\r\na time when all the Ural-Altaic tongues were subject to progressive\r\nvowel harmony[629].\r\n\r\nBut however this be, Dean Byrne is disposed to regard the alternating\r\nenergetic utterance of the hard, and indolent utterance of the soft\r\nvowel series, as an expression of the alternating active and lethargic\r\ntemperament of the race, such alternations being themselves due to the\r\nclimatic conditions of their environment. \"Certainly the life of the\r\ngreat nomadic races involves a twofold experience of this kind, as they\r\nmust during their abundant summer provide for their rigorous winter,\r\nwhen little can be done. Their character, too, involves a striking\r\ncombination of intermittent indolence and energy; and it is very\r\nremarkable that this distinction of roots is peculiar to the languages\r\nspoken originally where this great distinction of seasons exists. The\r\nfact that the distinction [between hard and soft] is imparted to all the\r\nsuffixes of a root proves that the radical characteristic which it\r\nexpresses is thought with these; and consequently that the radical idea\r\nis retained in the consciousness while these are added to it[630].\"\r\n\r\nThis is a highly characteristic instance of the methods followed by Dean\r\nByrne in his ingenious but hopeless attempt to explain the subtle\r\nstructure of speech by the still more subtle temperament of the speaker,\r\ntaken in connection with the alternating nature of the climate. The\r\nfeature in question cannot be due to such alternation of mood and\r\nclimate, because it is persistent throughout all seasons, while the hard\r\nand soft elements occur simultaneously, one might say, promiscuously, in\r\nconversation under all mental states of those conversing.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation is given by Schleicher, who points out that\r\nprogressive vocal assimilation is the necessary result of agglutination,\r\nwhich by this means binds together the idea and its relations in their\r\noutward expression, just as they are already inseparately associated in\r\nthe mind of the speaker. Hence it is that such assonance is not confined\r\nto the Ural-Altaic group, analogous processes occurring at certain\r\nstages of their growth in all forms of speech, as in Wolof, Zulu-Xosa,\r\nCeltic (expressed by the formula of Irish grammarians: \"broad to broad,\r\nslender to slender\"), and even in Latin, as in such vocalic concordance\r\nas: _annus, perennis_; _ars, iners_; _lego, diligo_. In these examples\r\nthe root vowel is influenced by that of the prefix, while in the\r\nMongolo-Turki family the root vowel, coming first, is unchangeable, but,\r\nas explained, influences the vowels of the postfixes, the phonetic\r\nprinciple being the same in both systems.\r\n\r\nBoth Mongol and Manchu are cultivated languages employing modified forms\r\nof the Uiguric (Turki) script, which is based on the Syriac introduced\r\nby the Christian (Nestorian) missionaries in the seventh century. It was\r\nfirst adopted by the Mongols about 1280, and perfected by the scribe\r\nTsorji Osir under Jenezek Khan (1307-1311). The letters, connected\r\ntogether by continuous strokes, and slightly modified, as in Syriac,\r\naccording to their position at the beginning, middle, or end of the\r\nword, are disposed in vertical columns from left to right, an\r\narrangement due no doubt to Chinese influence. This is the more probable\r\nsince the Manchus, before the introduction of the Mongol system in the\r\nsixteenth century, employed the Chinese characters ever since the time\r\nof the Kin dynasty.\r\n\r\nNone of the other Tungusic or north-east Siberian peoples possess any\r\nwriting system except the Yukaghirs of the Yasachnaya affluent of the\r\nKolymariver, who were visited in 1892 by the Russian traveller, S.\r\nShargorodsky. From his report[631], it appears that this symbolic\r\nwriting is carved with a sharp knife out of soft fresh birch-bark, these\r\nsimple materials sufficing to describe the tracks followed on hunting\r\nand fishing expeditions, as well as the sentiments of the young women in\r\ntheir correspondence with their sweethearts. Specimens are given of\r\nthese curious documents, some of which are touching and even pathetic.\r\n\"Thou goest hence, and I bide alone, for thy sake still to weep and\r\nmoan,\" writes one disconsolate maid to her parting lover. Another with a\r\ntouch of jealousy: \"Thou goest forth thy Russian flame to seek, who\r\nstands 'twixt thee and me, thy heart from me apart to keep. In a new\r\nhome joy wilt thou find, while I must ever grieve, as thee I bear in\r\nmind, though another yet there be who loveth me.\" Or again: \"Each youth\r\nhis mate doth find; my fate alone it is of him to dream, who to another\r\nwedded is, and I must fain contented be, if only he forget not me.\" And\r\nwith a note of wail: \"Thou hast gone hence, and of late it seems this\r\nplace for me is desolate; and I too forth must fare, that so the\r\nmemories old I may forget, and from the pangs thus flee of those bright\r\ndays, which here I once enjoyed with thee.\"\r\n\r\nDetails of domestic life may even be given, and one accomplished maiden\r\nis able to make a record in her note-book of the combs, shawls, needles,\r\nthimble, cake of soap, lollipops, skeins of wool, and other sundries,\r\nwhich she has received from a Yakut packman, in exchange for some\r\nclothes she has made him. Without illustrations no description of the\r\nprocess would be intelligible. Indeed it would seem these primitive\r\ndocuments are not always understood by the young folks themselves. They\r\ngather at times in groups to watch the process of composition by some\r\nexpert damsel, the village \"notary,\" and much merriment, we are told, is\r\ncaused by the blunders of those who fail to read the text aright.\r\n\r\nIt is not stated whether the system is current amongst the other\r\nYukaghir tribes, who dwell on the banks of the Indigirka, Yana,\r\nKerkodona, and neighbouring districts. They thus skirt the Frozen Ocean\r\nfrom near the Lena delta to and beyond the Kolyma, and are conterminous\r\nlandwards with the Yakuts on the south-west and the Chukchi on the\r\nnorth-east. With the Chukchi, the Koryaks, the Kamchadales, and the\r\nGilyaks they form a separate branch of the Mongolic division sometimes\r\ngrouped together as \"Hyperboreans,\" but distinguished from other\r\nUral-Altaic peoples perhaps strictly on linguistic grounds. Although now\r\nreduced to scarcely 1500, the Yukaghirs were formerly a numerous people,\r\nand the popular saying that their hearths on the banks of the Kolyma at\r\none time outnumbered the stars in the sky seems a reminiscence of more\r\nprosperous days. But great inroads have been made by epidemics, tribal\r\nwars, the excessive use of coarse Ukraine tobacco and of bad spirits,\r\nindulged in even by the women and children. \"A Yukaghir, it is said,\r\nnever intoxicates himself alone, but calls upon his family to share the\r\ndrink, even children in arms being supplied with a portion[632].\" Their\r\nlanguage, which A. Schiefner regards as radically distinct from all\r\nothers[633], is disappearing even more rapidly than the people\r\nthemselves, if it be not already quite extinct. In the eighties it was\r\nspoken only by about a dozen old persons, its place being taken almost\r\neverywhere by the Turki dialect of the Yakuts[634].\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a curious interchange of tribal names between the\r\nChukchi and their Koryak neighbours, the term _Koryak_ being the Chukchi\r\n_Khorana_, \"Reindeer,\" while the Koryaks are said to call themselves\r\n_Chauchau_, whence some derive the word _Chukchi_. Hooper, however,\r\ntells us that the proper form of Chukchi is _Tuski_, \"Brothers,\" or\r\n\"Confederates[635],\" and in any case the point is of little consequence,\r\nas Dittmar is probably right in regarding both groups as closely\r\nrelated, and sprung originally from one stock[636]. Jointly they occupy\r\nthe north-east extremity of the continent between the Kolyma and Bering\r\nStrait, together with the northern parts of Kamchatka; the Chukchi lying\r\nto the north, the Koryaks to the south, mainly round about the\r\nnorth-eastern inlets of the Sea of Okhotsk. Reasons have already been\r\nadvanced for supposing that the Chukchi were a Tungus people who came\r\noriginally from the Amur basin. In their arctic homes they appear to\r\nhave waged long wars with the Onkilon (Ang-kali) aborigines, gradually\r\nmerging with the survivors and also mingling both with the Koryaks and\r\nChuklukmiut Eskimo settled on the Asiatic side of Bering Strait.\r\n\r\nBut their relations to all these peoples are involved in great\r\nobscurity, and while some connect them with the Itelmes of\r\nKamchatka[637], by others they have been affiliated to the Eskimo, owing\r\nto the Eskimo dialect said to be spoken by them. But this \"dialect\" is\r\nonly a trading jargon, a sort of \"pidgin Eskimo\" current all round the\r\ncoast, and consisting of Chukchi, Innuit, Koryak, English, and even\r\nHawaii elements, mingled together in varying proportions. The true\r\nChukchi language, of which Nordenskioeld collected 1000 words, is quite\r\ndistinct from Eskimo, and probably akin to Koryak[638], and the Swedish\r\nexplorer aptly remarks that \"this race, settled on the primeval route\r\nbetween the Old and New World, bears an unmistakable stamp of the\r\nMongols of Asia and the Eskimo and Indians of America.\" He was much\r\nstruck by the great resemblance of the Chukchi weapons and household\r\nutensils to those of the Greenland Eskimo, while Signe Rink shows that\r\neven popular legends have been diffused amongst the populations on both\r\nsides of Bering Strait[639]. Such common elements, however, prove little\r\nfor racial affinity, which seems excluded by the extremely round shape\r\nof the Chukchi skull, as compared with the long-headed Eskimo. But the\r\ntype varies considerably both amongst the so-called \"Fishing Chukchi,\"\r\nwho occupy permanent stations along the seaboard, and the \"Reindeer\r\nChukchi,\" who roam the inland districts, shifting their camping-grounds\r\nwith the seasons. There are no hereditary chiefs, and little deference\r\nis paid to the authority even of the owner of the largest reindeer\r\nherds, on whom the Russians have conferred the title of _Jerema_,\r\nregarding him as the head of the Chukchi nation, and holding him\r\nresponsible for the good conduct of his rude subjects. Although nominal\r\nChristians, they continue to sacrifice animals to the spirits of the\r\nrivers and mountains, and also to practise Shamanist rites. They believe\r\nin an after-life, but only for those who die a violent death. Hence the\r\nresignation and even alacrity with which the hopelessly infirm and the\r\naged submit, when the time comes, to be dispatched by their kinsfolk, in\r\naccordance with the tribal custom of _kamitok_, which still survives in\r\nfull vigour amongst the Chukchi, as amongst the Sumatran Battas, and may\r\nbe traced in many other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\"The doomed one,\" writes Harry de Windt, \"takes a lively interest in the\r\nproceedings, and often assists in the preparation for his own death. The\r\nexecution is always preceded by a feast, where seal and walrus meat are\r\ngreedily devoured, and whisky consumed till all are intoxicated. A\r\nspontaneous burst of singing and the muffled roll of walrus-hide drums\r\nthen herald the fatal moment. At a given signal a ring is formed by the\r\nrelations and friends, the entire settlement looking on from the\r\nbackground. The executioner (usually the victim's son or brother) then\r\nsteps forward, and placing his right foot behind the back of the\r\ncondemned, slowly strangles him to death with a walrus-thong. A kamitok\r\ntook place during the latter part of our stay[640].\"\r\n\r\nThis custom of \"voluntary death\" is sometimes due to sorrow at the death\r\nof a near relative, a quarrel at home, or merely weariness of life, and\r\nBogoras thinks that the custom of killing old people does not exist as\r\nsuch, but is voluntarily chosen in preference to the hard life of an\r\ninvalid[641].\r\n\r\nMost recent observers have come to look upon the Chukchi and _Koryaks_\r\nas essentially one and the same people, the chief difference being that\r\nthe latter are if possible even more degraded than their northern\r\nneighbours[642]. Like them they are classed as sedentary fisherfolk or\r\nnomad reindeer-owners, the latter, who call themselves Tumugulu,\r\n\"Wanderers,\" roaming chiefly between Ghiyiginsk Bay and the Anadyr\r\nriver. Through them the Chukchi merge gradually in the _Itelmes_, who\r\nare better known as Kamchadales, from the Kamchatka river, where they\r\nare now chiefly concentrated. Most of the Itelmes are already Russified\r\nin speech and--outwardly at least--in religion; but they still secretly\r\nimmolate a dog now and then, to propitiate the malevolent beings who\r\nthrow obstacles in the way of their hunting and fishing expeditions. Yet\r\ntheir very existence depends on their canine associates, who are of a\r\nstout, almost wolfish breed, inured to hunger and hardships, and\r\nexcellent for sledge work.\r\n\r\nSomewhat distinct both from all these Hyperboreans and from their\r\nneighbours, the Orochons, Golds, Manegrs and other Tungus peoples, are\r\nthe _Gilyaks_, formerly widespread, but now confined to the Amur delta\r\nand the northern parts of Sakhalin[643]. Some observers have connected\r\nthem with the Ainu and the Korean aborigines, while A. Anuchin detects\r\ntwo types--a Mongoloid with sparse beard, high cheek-bones, and flat\r\nface, and a Caucasic with bushy beard and more regular features[644].\r\nThe latter traits have been attributed to Russian mixture, but, as\r\nconjectured by H. von Siebold, are more probably due to a fundamental\r\nconnection with their Ainu neighbours[645].\r\n\r\nMentally the Gilyaks take a low position--H. Lansdell thought the lowest\r\nof any people he had met in Siberia[646]. Despite the zeal of the\r\nRussian missionaries, and the inducements to join the fold, they remain\r\nobdurate Shamanists, and even fatalists, so that \"if one falls into the\r\nwater the others will not help him out, on the plea that they would thus\r\nbe opposing a higher power, who wills that he should perish.... The soul\r\nof the Gilyak is supposed to pass at death into his favourite dog, which\r\nis accordingly fed with choice food; and when the spirit has been prayed\r\nby the shamans out of the dog, the animal is sacrificed on his master's\r\ngrave. The soul is then represented as passing underground, lighted and\r\nguided by its own sun and moon, and continuing to lead there, in its\r\nspiritual abode, the same manner of life and pursuits as in the\r\nflesh[647].\"\r\n\r\nA speciality of the Gilyaks, as well as of their Gold neighbours, is the\r\nfish-skin costume, made from the skins of two kinds of salmon, and from\r\nthis all these aborigines are known to the Chinese as _Yupitatse_,\r\n\"Fish-skin-clad-People.\" \"They strip it off with great dexterity, and by\r\nbeating with a mallet remove the scales, and so render it supple.\r\nClothes thus made are waterproof. I saw a travelling-bag, and even the\r\nsail of a boat, made of this material[648].\"\r\n\r\nLike the Ainu, the Gilyaks may be called bear-worshippers. At least this\r\nanimal is supposed to be one of their chief gods, although they ensnare\r\nhim in winter, keep him in confinement, and when well fattened tear him\r\nto pieces, devouring his mangled remains with much feasting and\r\njubilation.\r\n\r\nSince the opening up of Korea, some fresh light has been thrown upon the\r\norigins and ethnical relations of its present inhabitants. In his\r\nmonograph on the Yellow Races[649] Hamy had included them in the Mongol\r\ndivision, but not without reserve, adding that \"while some might be\r\ntaken for Tibetans, others look like an Oceanic cross; hence the\r\ncontradictory reports and theories of modern travellers.\" Since then the\r\nstudy of some skulls forwarded to Paris has enabled him to clear up some\r\nof the confusion, which is obviously due to interminglings of different\r\nelements dating from remote (neolithic) times. On the data supplied by\r\nthese skulls Hamy classes the Koreans in three groups:--1. The natives\r\nof the northern provinces (Ping-ngan-tao and Hienking-tao), strikingly\r\nlike their Mongol [Tungus] neighbours; 2. Those of the southern\r\nprovinces (Klingchang-tao and Thsiusan-lo-tao), descendants of the\r\nancient Chinhans and Pien-hans, showing Japanese affinities; 3. Those of\r\nthe inner provinces (Hoanghae-tao and Ching-tsing-tao), who present a\r\ntransitional form between the northerns and southerns, both in their\r\nphysical type and geographical position[650].\r\n\r\nCaucasic features--light eyes, large nose, hair often brown, full beard,\r\nfair and even white skin, tall stature--are conspicuous, especially\r\namongst the upper classes and many of the southern Koreans[651]. They\r\nare thus shown to be a mixed race, the Mongol element dominating in the\r\nnorth, as might be expected, and the Caucasic in the south.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions seem to be confirmed by what is known of the early\r\nmovements, migrations, and displacements of the populations in\r\nnorth-east Asia about the dawn of history. In these vicissitudes the\r\nKoreans, as they are now called[652], appear to have first taken part in\r\nthe twelfth century B.C., when the peninsula was already occupied, as it\r\nstill is, by Mongols, the _Sien-pi_, in the north, and in the south by\r\nseveral branches of the _Hans_ (_San-San_), of whom it is recorded that\r\nthey spoke a language unintelligible to the Sien-pi, and resembled the\r\nJapanese in appearance, manners, and customs. From this it may be\r\ninferred that the Hans were the true aborigines, probably direct\r\ndescendants of the Caucasic peoples of the New Stone Age, while the\r\nSien-pi were Mongolic (Tungusic) intruders from the present Manchuria.\r\nFor some time these Sien-pi played a leading part in the political\r\nconvulsions prior and subsequent to the erection of the Great Wall by\r\nShih Hwang Ti, founder of the Tsin dynasty (221-209 B.C.)[653]. Soon\r\nafter the completion of this barrier, the _Hiung-nu_, no longer able to\r\nscour the fertile plains of the Middle Kingdom, turned their arms\r\nagainst the neighbouring _Yue-chi_, whom they drove westwards to the\r\nSungarian valleys. Here they were soon displaced by the _Usuns_\r\n(_Wusun_), a fair, blue-eyed people of unknown origin, who have been\r\ncalled \"Aryans,\" and even \"Teutons,\" and whom Ch. de Ujfalvy identifies\r\nwith the tall long-headed western blonds (de Lapouge's _Homo\r\nEuropaeus_), mixed with brown round-headed hordes of white\r\ncomplexion[654]. Accepting this view, we may go further, and identify\r\nthe Usuns, as well as the other white peoples of the early Chinese\r\nrecords, with the already described Central Asiatic Caucasians of the\r\nStone Ages, whose osseous remains we now possess, and who come to the\r\nsurface in the very first Chinese documents dealing with the turbulent\r\npopulations beyond the Great Wall. The white element, with all the\r\ncorrelated characters, existed beyond all question, for it is\r\ncontinuously referred to in those documents. How is its presence in East\r\nCentral Asia, including Manchuria and Korea, to be explained? Only on\r\ntwo assumptions--_proto-historic_ migrations from the Far West, barred\r\nby the proto-historic migrations from the Far East, as largely\r\ndetermined by the erection of the Great Wall; or _pre-historic_\r\n(neolithic) migrations, also from the Far West, but barred by no serious\r\nobstacle, because antecedent to the arrival of the proto-Mongolic tribes\r\nfrom the Tibetan plateau. The true solution of the endless ethnical\r\ncomplications in the extreme East, as in the Oceanic world, will still\r\nbe found in the now-demonstrated presence of a Caucasic element\r\nantecedent to the Mongol in those regions.\r\n\r\nWhen the Hiung-nu[655] power was weakened by their westerly migrations\r\nto Sungaria and south-west Siberia (Upper Irtysh and Lake Balkash\r\ndepression), and broken into two sections during their wars with the two\r\nHan dynasties (201 B.C.-220 A.D.), the Korean Sien-pi became the\r\ndominant nation north of the Great Wall. After destroying the last\r\nvestiges of the unstable Hiung-nu empire, and driving the Mongolo-Turki\r\nhordes still westwards, the Yuan-yuans, most powerful of all the Sien-pi\r\ntribes, remained masters of East Central Asia for about 400 years and\r\nthen disappeared from history[656]. At least after the sixth century\r\nA.D. no further mention is made of the Sien-pi principalities either in\r\nManchuria or in Korea. Here, however, they appear still to form a\r\ndominant element in the northern (Mongol) provinces, calling themselves\r\nGhirin (Khirin), from the Khirin (Sungari) valley of the Amur, where\r\nthey once held sway.\r\n\r\nSince those days Korea has been alternately a vassal State and a\r\nprovince of the Middle Kingdom, with interludes of Japanese ascendancy,\r\ninterrupted only by the four centuries of Korai ascendancy (934-1368).\r\nThis was the most brilliant epoch in the national records, when Korea\r\nwas rather the ally than the vassal of China, and when trade, industry,\r\nand the arts, especially porcelain and bronze work, flourished in the\r\nland. But by centuries of subsequent misrule, a people endowed with\r\nexcellent natural qualities have been reduced to the lowest state of\r\ndegradation. Before the reforms introduced by the political events of\r\n1895-96, \"the country was eaten up by officialism. It is not only that\r\nabuses without number prevailed, but the whole system of government was\r\nan abuse, a sea of corruption, without a bottom or a shore, an engine of\r\nrobbery, crushing the life out of all industry[657].\" But an improvement\r\nwas speedily remarked. \"The air of the men has undergone a subtle and\r\nreal change, and the women, though they nominally keep up their habits\r\nby seclusion, have lost the hang-dog air which distinguished them at\r\nhome. The alacrity of movement is a change also, and has replaced the\r\nconceited swing of the _yang-ban_ [nobles] and the heartless lounge of\r\nthe peasant.\" This improvement was merely temporary. The last years of\r\nthe century were marked by the waning of Japanese influence, due to\r\nRussian intrigues, the restoration of absolute monarchy together with\r\nits worst abuses, the abandonment of reforms and a retrograde movement\r\nthroughout the kingdom. The successes of Japan in 1904-5 resulted in the\r\nrestoration of her ascendancy, culminating in 1910 in the cession of\r\nsovereignty by the emperor of Korea to the emperor of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe religious sentiment is perhaps less developed than among any other\r\nAsiatic people. Buddhism, introduced about 380 A.D., never took root,\r\nand while the _literati_ are satisfied with the moral precepts of\r\nConfucius, the rest have not progressed beyond the nature-worship which\r\nwas the ancient religion of the land. Every mountain, pass, ford or even\r\neddy of a river has a spirit to whom offerings are made. Honour is also\r\npaid to ancestors, both royal and domestic, at their temples or altars,\r\nand chapels are built and dedicated to men who have specially\r\ndistinguished themselves in loyalty, virtue or lofty teaching.\r\n\r\nPhilologists now recognise some affinity between the Korean and\r\nJapanese languages, both of which appear to be remotely connected with\r\nthe Ural-Altaic family. The Koreans possess a true alphabet of 28\r\nletters, which, however, is not a local invention, as is sometimes\r\nasserted. It appears to have been introduced by the Buddhist monks about\r\nor before the tenth century, and to be based on some cursive form of the\r\nIndian (Devanagari) system[658], although scarcely any resemblance can\r\nnow be traced between the two alphabets. This script is little used\r\nexcept by the lower classes and the women, the _literati_ preferring to\r\nwrite either in Chinese, or else in the so-called _nido_, that is, an\r\nadaptation of the Chinese symbols to the phonetic expression of the\r\nKorean syllables. The _nido_ is exactly analogous to the Japanese\r\n_Katakana_ script, in which modified forms of Chinese ideographs are\r\nused phonetically to express 47 syllables (the so-called _I-ro-fa_\r\nsyllabary), raised to 73 by the _nigori_ and _maru_ diacritical marks.\r\n\r\nThe present population of Japan, according to E. Baelz, shows the\r\nfollowing types. The first and most important is the Manchu-Korean type,\r\ncharacteristic of North China and Korea, and most frequent among the\r\nupper classes in Japan. The stature is conspicuously tall, the effect\r\nbeing heightened by slender and elegant figure. The face is long, with\r\nmore or less oblique eyes but no marked prominence of the cheek-bones.\r\nThe nose is aquiline, the chin slightly receding. With this type is\r\nassociated a narrow chest, giving an air of elegance rather than of\r\nmuscularity, an effect which is enhanced by the extremely delicate hands\r\nwith long slender fingers. The second type is the Mongol, and presents a\r\ndistinct contrast, with strong and squarely built figure, broad face,\r\nprominent cheek-bones, oblique eyes, flat nose and wide mouth. This type\r\nis not common in the Japanese Islands. The third type, more conspicuous\r\nthan either of the preceding, is the Malay. The stature is small, with\r\nwell-knit frame, and broad, well-developed chest. The face is generally\r\nround, the nose short, jaws and chin frequently projecting. None of\r\nthese three types represents the aboriginal race of Japan, for there\r\nseems to be no doubt that the Ainu, who now survive in parts of the\r\nnorthern island of Yezo, occupied a greater area in earlier times and to\r\nthem the prehistoric shell-mounds and other remains are usually\r\nattributed[659]. The Ainu are thickly and strongly built, but differ\r\nfrom all other Oriental types in the hairiness of face and body. The\r\nhead is long, with a cephalic index of 77.8. Face and nose are broad,\r\nand the eyes are horizontal, not oblique, lacking the Mongolian fold.\r\n\r\nIt is generally assumed that this population represents the easterly\r\nmigration of that long-headed type which can be traced across the\r\ncontinents of Europe and Asia in the Stone Age, and that their entrance\r\ninto the islands was effected at a time when the channel separating them\r\nfrom the mainland was neither so wide nor so deep as at the present\r\ntime. Later Manchu-Korean invaders from the West, Mongols from the\r\nSouth, and Malays from the East pressed the aborigines further and\r\nfurther north, to Yezo, Sakhalin and the Kuriles. But it is possible\r\nthat the Ainu were not the earliest inhabitants of Japan, for they\r\nthemselves bear witness to predecessors, the _Koro-pok-guru_, mentioned\r\nabove (p. 260). Neither is the assumption of kinship between the Ainu\r\nand prehistoric populations of Western Europe accepted without demur.\r\nDeniker, while acknowledging the resemblance to certain European types,\r\nclasses the Ainu as a separate race, the _Palaeasiatics_. For while in\r\nhead-length, prominent superciliary ridges, hairiness and the form of\r\nthe nose they may be compared to Russians, Todas, and Australians, their\r\nskin colour, prominent cheek-bones, and other somatic features make any\r\nclose affinity impossible[660].\r\n\r\nIn spite of these various ingredients the Japanese people may be\r\nregarded as fairly homogeneous. Apart from some tall and robust persons\r\namongst the upper classes, and athletes, acrobats, and wrestlers, the\r\ngeneral impression that the Japanese are a short finely moulded race is\r\nfully borne out by the now regularly recorded military measurements of\r\nrecruits, showing for height an average of 1.585 m. (5 ft. 2-1/2 in.) to\r\n1.639 m. (5 ft. 4-1/2 in.), for chest 33 in., and disproportionately\r\nshort legs. Other distinctive characters, all tending to stamp a certain\r\nindividuality on the people, taken as a whole and irrespective of local\r\npeculiarities, are a flat forehead, great distance between the eyebrows,\r\na very small nose with raised nostrils, no glabella, no perceptible\r\nnasal root[661]; an active, wiry figure; the exposed skin less yellow\r\nthan the Chinese, and rather inclining to a light fawn, but the covered\r\nparts very light, some say even white; the eyes also less oblique, and\r\nall other characteristically Mongol features generally softened, except\r\nthe black lank hair, which in transverse section is perhaps even rounder\r\nthan that of most other Mongol peoples[662].\r\n\r\nWith this it will be instructive to compare F. H. H. Guillemard's\r\ngraphic account of the Liu-Kiu islanders, whose Koreo-Japanese\r\naffinities are now placed beyond all doubt: \"They are a short race,\r\nprobably even shorter than the Japanese, but much better proportioned,\r\nbeing without the long bodies and short legs of the latter people, and\r\nhaving as a rule extremely well-developed chests. The colour of the skin\r\nvaries of course with the social position of the individual. Those who\r\nwork in the fields, clad only in a waist-cloth, are nearly as dark as a\r\nMalay, but the upper classes are much fairer, and are at the same time\r\ndevoid of any of the yellow tint of the Chinaman. To the latter race\r\nindeed they cannot be said to bear any resemblance, and though the type\r\nis much closer to the Japanese, it is nevertheless very distinct.... In\r\nLiu-Kiu the Japanese and natives were easily recognised by us from the\r\nfirst, and must therefore be possessed of very considerable differences.\r\nThe Liu-Kiuan has the face less flattened, the eyes are more deeply set,\r\nand the nose more prominent at its origin. The forehead is high and the\r\ncheek-bones somewhat less marked than in the Japanese; the eyebrows are\r\narched and thick, and the eyelashes long. The expression is gentle and\r\npleasing, though somewhat sad, and is apparently a true index of their\r\ncharacter[663].\"\r\n\r\nThis description is not accepted without some reserve by Chamberlain,\r\nwho in fact holds that \"the physical type of the Luchuans resembles that\r\nof the Japanese almost to identity[664].\" In explanation however of the\r\nsingularly mild, inoffensive, and \"even timid disposition\" of the\r\nLiu-Kiuans, this observer suggests \"the probable absence of any\r\nadmixture of Malay blood in the race[665].\" But everybody admits a\r\nMalay element in Japan. It would therefore appear that Guillemard must\r\nbe right, and that, as even shown by all good photographs, differences\r\ndo exist, due in fact to the presence of this very Malay strain in the\r\nJapanese race.\r\n\r\nElsewhere[666] Chamberlain has given us a scholarly account of the\r\nLiu-Kiu language, which is not merely a \"sister,\" as he says, but\r\nobviously an _elder_ sister, more archaic in structure and partly in its\r\nphonetics, than the oldest known form of Japanese. In the verb, for\r\ninstance, Japanese retains only one past tense of the indicative, with\r\nbut one grammatical form, whereas Liu-Kiuan preserves the three original\r\npast tenses, each of which possesses a five-fold inflection. All these\r\nracial, linguistic, and even mental resemblances, such as the\r\nfundamental similarity of many of their customs and ways of thought, he\r\nwould explain with much probability by the routes followed by the first\r\nemigrants from the mainland. While the great bulk spread east and north\r\nover the great archipelago, everywhere \"driving the aborigines before\r\nthem,\" a smaller stream may have trended southward to the little\r\nsouthern group, whose islets stretch like stepping-stones the whole way\r\nfrom Japan to Great Liu-Kiu[667].\r\n\r\nAmongst the common mental traits, mention is made of the Shinto\r\nreligion, \"the simplest and most rustic form\" of which still survives in\r\nLiu-Kiu. Here, as in Japan, it was originally a rude system of\r\nnature-worship, the normal development of which was arrested by Chinese\r\nand Buddhist influences. Later it became associated with spirit-worship,\r\nthe spirits being at first the souls of the dead, and although there is\r\nat present no cult of the dead, in the strict sense of the expression,\r\nthe Liu-Kiu islanders probably pay more respect to the departed than any\r\nother people in the world.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, Shintoism, as reformed in recent times, has become much more a\r\npolitical institution than a religious system. The _Kami-no-michi_, that\r\nis, the Japanese form of the Chinese _Shin-to_, \"way of the Gods,\" or\r\n\"spirits,\" is not merely the national faith, but is inseparably bound up\r\nwith the interests of the reigning dynasty, holding the Mikado to be the\r\ndirect descendant of the Sun-goddess Hence its three cardinal precepts\r\nnow are:--1. Honour the _Kami_ (spirits), of whom the emperor is the\r\nchief representative on earth; 2. Revere him as thy sovereign; 3. Obey\r\nthe will of his Court, and that is the whole duty of man. There is no\r\nmoral code, and loyal expositors have declared that the Mikado's will is\r\nthe only test of right and wrong.\r\n\r\nBut apart from this political exegesis, Shintoism in its higher form may\r\nbe called a cultured deism, in its lower a \"blind obedience to\r\ngovernmental and priestly dictates[668].\" There are dim notions about a\r\nsupreme creator, immortality, and even rewards and penalties in the\r\nafter-life. Some also talk vaguely, as a pantheist might, of a sublime\r\nbeing or essence pervading all nature, too vast and ethereal to be\r\npersonified or addressed in prayer, identified with the _tenka_,\r\n\"heavens,\" from which all things emanate, to which all return. Yet,\r\nalthough a personal deity seems thus excluded, there are Shinto temples,\r\napparently for the worship of the heavenly bodies and powers of nature,\r\nconceived as self-existing personalities--the so-called _Kami_,\r\n\"spirits,\" \"gods,\" of which there are \"eight millions,\" that is, they\r\nare countless.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but suspect that some of these notions have been grafted on\r\nthe old national faith by Buddhism, which was introduced about 550 A.D.\r\nand for a time had great vogue. It was encouraged especially by the\r\nShoguns, or military usurpers of the Mikado's[669] functions, obviously\r\nas a set-off against the Shinto theocracy. During their tenure of power\r\n(1192-1868 A.D.) the land was covered with Buddhist shrines and temples,\r\nsome of vast size and quaint design, filled with hideous idols, huge\r\nbells, and colossal statues of Buddha.\r\n\r\nBut with the fall of the Shogun the little prestige still enjoyed by\r\nBuddhism came to an end, and the temples, spoiled of their treasures,\r\nhave more than ever become the resort of pleasure-seekers rather than of\r\npious worshippers. \"To all the larger temples are attached regular\r\nspectacles, playhouses, panoramas, besides lotteries, games of various\r\nsorts, including the famous 'fan-throwing,' and shooting-galleries,\r\nwhere the bow and arrow and the blow-pipe take the place of the rifle.\r\nThe accumulated treasures of the priests have been confiscated, the\r\nmonks driven from their monasteries, and many of these buildings\r\nconverted into profane uses. Countless temple bells have already found\r\ntheir way to America, or have been sold for old metal[670].\"\r\n\r\nBesides these forms of belief, there is a third religious, or rather\r\nphilosophic system, the so-called _Siza_, based on the ethical teachings\r\nof Confucius, a sort of refined materialism, such as underlies the whole\r\nreligious thought of the nation. Siza, always confined to the\r\n_literati_, has in recent years found a formidable rival in the \"English\r\nPhilosophy,\" represented by such writers as Buckle, Mill, Herbert\r\nSpencer, Darwin, and Huxley, most of whose works have already been\r\ntranslated into Japanese.\r\n\r\nThus this highly gifted people are being assimilated to the western\r\nworld in their social and religious, as well as their political\r\ninstitutions. Their intellectual powers, already tested in the fields of\r\nwar, science, diplomacy, and self-government, are certainly superior to\r\nthose of all other Asiatic peoples, and this is perhaps the best\r\nguarantee for the stability of the stupendous transformation that a\r\nsingle generation has witnessed from an exaggerated form of medieval\r\nfeudalism to a political and social system in harmony with the most\r\nadvanced phases of modern thought. The system has doubtless not yet\r\npenetrated to the lower strata, especially amongst the rural\r\npopulations. But their natural receptivity, combined with a singular\r\nfreedom from \"insular prejudice,\" must ensure the ultimate acceptance of\r\nthe new order by all classes of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[569] As fully explained in _Eth._ p. 303.\r\n\r\n[570] Mark Aurel Stein, _Sand-buried Cities of Khotan_, 1903, and _Geog.\r\nJourn._, July, Sept. 1909.\r\n\r\n[571] R.

It should\r\nbe noted that neither Akkad nor Sumer occurs in the oldest texts, where\r\nAkkad is called _Kish_ from the name of its capital, and Sumer _Kiengi_\r\n(_Kengi_), probably a general name meaning \"the land.\" Kish has been\r\nidentified with the Kush of Gen. x., one of the best abused words in\r\nPalethnology. For this identification, however, there is some ground,\r\nseeing that Kush is mentioned in the closest connection with \"Babel, and\r\nErech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar\" (Mesopotamia) _v._\r\n10.\r\n\r\n[603] J. de Morgan, _Memoires de la Delegation en Perse_, 1899-1906.\r\n\r\n[604] S. Laing, _Human Origins_, p. 74.\r\n\r\n[605] And it has remained so ever since, the present Lur and Bakhtiari\r\ninhabitants of Susiana speaking, not the standard Neo-Persian, but\r\ndialects of the ruder Kurdish branch of the Iranian family, as if they\r\nhad been Aryanised from Media, the capital of which was Ekbatana. We\r\nhave here, perhaps, a clue to the origin of the Medes themselves, who\r\nwere certainly the above-mentioned Mandas of Nabonidus, their capital\r\nbeing also the same Ekbatana. Now Sayce (_Academy_, Sept. 7, 1895, p.\r\n189) identified the Kimmerians with these Manda nomads, whose king\r\nTukdamme (Tugdamme) was the Lygdanis of Strabo (I. 3, 16), who led a\r\nhorde of Kimmerians into Lydia and captured Sardis. We know from\r\nEsarhaddon's inscriptions that by the Assyrians these Kimmerians were\r\ncalled Manda, their prince Teupsa (Teispe) being described as \"of the\r\npeople of the Manda.\" An oracle given to Esar-haddon begins: \"The\r\nKimmerian in the mountains has set fire in the land of Ellip,\" _i.e._\r\nthe land where Ekbatana was afterwards founded, which is now shown to\r\nhave already been occupied by the Kimmerian or Manda hordes. It follows\r\nthat Kimmerians, Mandas, Medes with their modern Kurd and Bakhtiari\r\nrepresentatives, were all one people, who were almost certainly of Aryan\r\nspeech, if not actually of proto-Aryan stock. \"The Kurds are the\r\ndescendants of Aryan invaders and have maintained their type and their\r\nlanguage for more than 3300 years,\" F. v.

The explanation is that in the\r\nthirteenth century a local incarnation of Buddha was raised by the then\r\ndominant Mongols to the first rank, and this title of _Dalai Lama_, the\r\n\"Ocean Priest,\" _i.e._ the Priest of fathomless wisdom, was bestowed on\r\none of his successors in the sixteenth century, and still retained by\r\nthe High Pontiff at Lhasa.\r\n\r\n[615] _Aboriginal Siberia_, 1914, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[616] _Loc. cit._ pp. 18-21.\r\n\r\n[617] Either from the Chinese _Tunghu_, \"Eastern Barbarians,\" or from\r\nthe Turki _Tinghiz_, as in Isaac Massa: _per interpretes se Tingoesi\r\nvocari dixerunt_ (_Descriptio_, etc., Amsterdam, 1612).

But there\r\nis an extraordinary disparity between the two sexes, perhaps greater\r\nthan in any other country. The much smaller stature and feebler\r\nconstitution of the women is no doubt due to the detestable custom of\r\ncrippling the feet in childhood, thereby depriving them of natural\r\nexercise during the period of growth. It may be noted that the\r\nanti-foot-bandaging movement is making progress throughout China, the\r\nobject being to abolish the cruel practice by making the _kin lien_\r\n(\"golden lilies\") unfashionable, and the _ti mien_, the \"heavenly\r\nfeet,\"--_i.e._ the natural--popular in their stead.\r\n\r\n[628] H.

Coree_, p. 800).\r\n\r\n[652] From _Korai_, in Japanese _Kome_ (Chinese _Kaoli_), name of a\r\npetty state, which enjoyed political predominance in the peninsula for\r\nabout 500 years (tenth to fourteenth century A.D.). An older designation\r\nstill in official use is _Tsio-sien_, that is, the Chinese _Chao-sien_,\r\n\"Bright Dawn\" (Klaproth, _Asia Polyglotta_, p. 334 sq.).\r\n\r\n[653] This stupendous work, on which about 1,000,000 hands are said to\r\nhave been engaged for five years, possesses great ethnical as well as\r\npolitical importance. Running for over 1500 miles across hills, valleys,\r\nand rivers along the northern frontier of China proper, it long arrested\r\nthe southern movements of the restless Mongolo-Turki hordes, and thus\r\ngave a westerly direction to their incursions many centuries before the\r\ngreat invasions of Jenghiz-Khan and his successors. It is strange to\r\nreflect that the ethnological relations were thus profoundly disturbed\r\nthroughout the eastern hemisphere by the work of a ruthless despot who\r\nreigned only twelve years, and in that time waged war against all the\r\nbest traditions of the empire, destroying the books of Confucius and the\r\nother sages, and burying alive 460 men of letters for their efforts to\r\nrescue those writings from total extinction.\r\n\r\n[654] _Les Aryens au Nord et au Sud de l'Hindou-Kouch_, 1896, p. 25.\r\nThis writer does not think that the Usuns should be identified with the\r\ntall race of horse-like face, large nose, and deep-set eyes mentioned in\r\nthe early Chinese records, because no reference is made to \"blue eyes,\"\r\nwhich would not have been omitted had they existed. But, if I remember,\r\n\"green eyes\" are spoken of, and we know that none of the early writers\r\nuse colour terms with strict accuracy.\r\n\r\n[655] I have not thought it desirable to touch on the interminable\r\ncontroversy respecting the ethnical relations of the Hiung-nu, regarding\r\nthem, not as a distinct ethnical group, but like the Huns, their later\r\nwestern representatives, as a heterogeneous collection of Mongol,\r\nTungus, Turki, and perhaps even Finnish hordes under a Mongol military\r\ncaste. At the same time I have little doubt that Mongolo-Tungus elements\r\ngreatly predominated in the eastern regions (Mongolia proper, Manchuria)\r\nboth amongst the Hiung-nu and their Yuan-yuan (Sien-pi) successors, and\r\nthat all the founders of the first great empires prior to that of the\r\nTurki Assena in the Altai region (sixth century A.D.) were full-blood\r\nMongols, as indeed recognised by Jenghiz-Khan himself. For the\r\nmigrations of these and neighbouring peoples, consult A. C. Haddon, _The\r\nWanderings of Peoples_, 1911, pp. 16 and 28.\r\n\r\n[656] On the authority of the Wei-Shu documents contained in the\r\nWei-Ch[=i], E. H. Parker gives (in the _China Review_ and _A Thousand\r\nYears of the Tartars_, Shanghai, 1895) the dates 386-556 A.D. as the\r\nperiod covered by the \"Sien-pi Tartar dynasty of Wei.\" This is not to be\r\nconfused with the Chinese dynasty of Wei (224-264, or according to Kwong\r\nKi-Chiu 234-274 A.D.). The term \"Tartar\" (Ta-Ta), it may be explained,\r\nis used by Parker, as well as by the Chinese historians generally, in a\r\nsomewhat wide sense, so as to include all the nomad populations north of\r\nthe Great Wall, whether of Tungus (Manchu), Mongol, or even Turki stock.\r\nThe original tribes bearing the name were Mongols, and Jenghiz-Khan\r\nhimself was a Tata on his mother's side.\r\n\r\n[657] Mrs Bishop, _Korea and Her Neighbours_, 1898.\r\n\r\n[658] T. de Lacouperie says on \"a Tibeto-Indian base\" (_Beginnings of\r\nWriting in Central and Eastern Asia_, 1894, p. 148); and E.

Jointly they constitute a well-marked section of\r\nthe family, being distinguished from the eastern section by several\r\nfeatures which they have in common, and the most important of which is\r\nunquestionably a much larger infusion of Caucasic blood than is seen in\r\nany of the Mongolo-Tungusic groups. So pronounced is this feature\r\namongst many Finnish as well as Turkish peoples, that some\r\nanthropologists have felt inclined to deny any direct connection between\r\nthe eastern and western divisions of Mongolian man and to regard the\r\nBaltic Finns, for instance, rather as \"Allophylian Whites\" than as\r\noriginal members of the yellow race. Prichard, to whom we owe this now\r\nnearly obsolete term \"Allophylian,\" held this view[671], and even Sayce\r\nis \"more than doubtful whether we can class the Mongols physiologically\r\nwith the Turkish-Tatars [the Turki peoples], or the Ugro-Finns[672].\"\r\n\r\nIt may, indeed, be allowed that at present the great majority of the\r\nFinno-Turki populations occupy a position amongst the varieties of\r\nmankind which is extremely perplexing for the strict systematist. When\r\nthe whole division is brought under survey, every shade of transition is\r\nobserved between the Siberian Samoyeds of the Finnic branch and the\r\nsteppe Kirghiz of the Turki branch on the one hand, both of whom show\r\nMongol characters in an exaggerated form, and on the other the Osmanli\r\nTurks and Hungarian Magyars, most of whom may be regarded as typical\r\nCaucasians. Moreover, the difficulty is increased by the fact, already\r\npointed out, that these mixed Mongolo-Caucasic characters occur not only\r\namongst the late historic groups, but also amongst the earliest known\r\ngroups--\"Chudes,\" Usuns, Uigurs and others--who may be called\r\nProto-Finnish and Proto-Turki peoples. But precisely herein lies the\r\nsolution of the problem. Most of the region now held by Turki and\r\nFinnish nations was originally occupied by long-headed Caucasic men of\r\nthe late Stone Ages (see above). Then followed the Proto-Mongol\r\nintruders from the Tibetan table-land, who partly submerged, partly\r\nintermingled with their neolithic neighbours, many thus acquiring those\r\nmixed characters by which they have been distinguished from the earliest\r\nhistoric times. Later, further interminglings took place according as\r\nthe Finno-Turki hordes, leaving their original seats in the Altai and\r\nsurrounding regions, advanced westwards and came more and more into\r\ncontact with the European populations of Caucasic type.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore conclude that the majority of the Finno-Turki were\r\nalmost from the first a somewhat mixed race, and that during historic\r\ntimes the original Mongol element has gradually yielded to the Caucasic\r\nin the direction from east to west. Such is the picture now presented by\r\nthese heterogeneous populations, who in their primeval eastern seats are\r\nstill mostly typical Mongols, but have been more and more assimilated to\r\nthe European type in their new Anatolian, Baltic, Danubian, and Balkan\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nObservant travellers have often been impressed by this progressive\r\nconformity of the Mongolo-Turki to Europeans. During his westward\r\njourney through Central Asia Younghusband, on passing from Mongolia to\r\nEastern Turkestan, found that the people, though tall and fine-looking,\r\nhad at first more of the Mongol cast of feature than he had expected.\r\n\"Their faces, however, though somewhat round, were slightly more\r\nelongated than the Mongol, and there was considerably more intelligence\r\nabout them. But there was more roundness, less intelligence, less\r\nsharpness in the outlines than is seen in the inhabitants of Kashgar and\r\nYarkand.\" Then he adds: \"As I proceeded westwards I noticed a gradual,\r\nscarcely perceptible, change from the round of a Mongolian type to a\r\nsharper and yet more sharp type of feature.... As we get farther away\r\nfrom Mongolia, we notice that the faces become gradually longer and\r\nnarrower; and farther west still, among some of the inhabitants of\r\nAfghan Turkestan, we see that the Tartar or Mongol type of feature is\r\nalmost entirely lost[673].\" To complete the picture it need only be\r\nadded that still further west, in Asia Minor, the Balkan Peninsula,\r\nHungary, and Finland, the Mongol features are often entirely lost. \"The\r\nTurks of the west have so much Aryan and Semitic blood in them, that the\r\nlast vestiges of their original physical characters have been lost, and\r\ntheir language alone indicates their previous descent[674].\"\r\n\r\nBefore they were broken up and dispersed over half the northern\r\nhemisphere by Mongol pressure from the east, the primitive Turki tribes\r\ndwelt, according to Howorth, mainly between the Ulugh-dagh mountains and\r\nthe Orkhon river in Mongolia, that is, along the southern slopes and\r\nspurs of the Altai-Sayan system from the head waters of the Irtysh to\r\nthe valleys draining north to Lake Baikal. But the Turki cradle is\r\nshifted farther east by Richthofen, who thinks that their true home lay\r\nbetween the Amur, the Lena, and the Selenga, where at one time they had\r\ntheir camping-grounds in close proximity to their Mongol and Tungus\r\nkinsmen. There is nothing to show that the Yakuts, who are admittedly of\r\nTurki stock, ever migrated to their present northern homes in the Lena\r\nbasin, which has more probably always been their native land[675].\r\n\r\nBut when they come within the horizon of history the Turki are already a\r\nnumerous nation, with a north-western and south-eastern division[676],\r\nwhich may well have jointly occupied the whole region from the Irtysh to\r\nthe Lena, and both views may thus be reconciled. In any case the Turki\r\ndomain lay west of the Mongol, and the Altai uplands, taken in the\r\nwidest sense, may still be regarded as the most probable zone of\r\nspecialisation for the Turki physical type. The typical characteristics\r\nare a yellowish white complexion, a high brachycephalic head, often\r\nalmost cuboid, due to parieto-occipital flattening (especially\r\nnoticeable among the Yakuts), an elongated oval face, with straight,\r\nsomewhat prominent nose, and non-Mongolian eyes. The stature is\r\nmoderate, with an average of 1.675 m. (5 ft. 6 in.), and a tendency to\r\nstoutness.\r\n\r\nIntermediate between the typical Turki and the Mongols Hamy places the\r\nUzbegs, Kirghiz, Bashkirs, and Nogais; and between the Turks and Finns\r\nthose extremely mixed groups of East Russia commonly but wrongly called\r\n\"Tartars,\" as well as other transitions between Turk, Slav, Greek, Arab,\r\nOsmanli of Constantinople, Kurugli of Algeria and others, whose study\r\nshows the extreme difficulty of accurately determining the limits of the\r\nYellow and the White races[677].\r\n\r\nAnalogous difficulties recur in the study of the Northern (Siberian)\r\ngroups--Samoyeds, Ostyaks, Voguls and other Ugrians--who present great\r\nindividual variations, leading almost without a break from the Mongol to\r\nthe Lapp, from the Lapp to the Finn, from Finn to Slav and Teuton. Thus\r\nmay be shown a series of observations continuous between the most\r\ntypical Mongol, and those aberrant Mongolo-Caucasic groups which answer\r\nto Prichard's \"Allophylian races.\" Thus also is confirmed by a study of\r\ndetails the above broad generalisation in which I have endeavoured to\r\ndetermine the relation of the Finno-Turki peoples to the primary Mongol\r\nand Caucasic divisions.\r\n\r\nPeisker's description of the Scythian invasions of Irania[678] may be\r\ntaken as typical of the whole area, and explains the complexity of the\r\nethnological problems. The steppes and deserts of Central Asia are an\r\nimpassable barrier for the South Asiatics, the Aryans, but not for the\r\nNorth Asiatic, the Altaian; for him they are an open country, providing\r\nhim with the indispensable winter pastures. On the other hand, for the\r\nSouth Asiatic Aryan these deserts are an object of terror, and besides\r\nhe is not impelled towards them as he has winter pastures near at hand.\r\nIt is this difference in the distance of summer and winter pastures that\r\nmakes the North Asiatic Altaian an ever-wandering herdsman, and the\r\ngrazing part of the Indo-European race cattle-rearers settled in limited\r\ndistricts. Thus, while the native Iranian must halt before the trackless\r\nregion of steppes and deserts and cannot follow the well-mounted\r\nrobber-nomad thither, Iran itself is the object of greatest longing to\r\nthe nomadic Altaian. Here he can plunder and enslave to his heart's\r\ndelight, and if he succeeds in maintaining himself for a considerable\r\ntime among the Aryans, he learns the language of the subjugated people\r\nand, by mingling with them, loses his Mongol characteristics more and\r\nmore. If the Iranian is now fortunate enough to shake off the yoke, the\r\ndispossessed iranised Altaian intruder inflicts himself upon other\r\nlands. So it was with the Scythians. Leaving their families behind in\r\nthe South Russian steppes, the Scythians invaded Media _c._ B.C. 630,\r\nand advanced into Mesopotamia as far as Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn Media they took Median wives and learned the Median language. After\r\nbeing driven out by Cyaxares, on their return, some 28 years later, they\r\nmet with a new generation, the offspring of the wives and daughters whom\r\nthey had left behind, and slaves of an alien race. A hundred and fifty\r\nyears later Hippocrates remarked their yellowish red complexion,\r\ncorpulence, smooth skins, and their consequent eunuch-like\r\nappearance--all typically Mongol characteristics. Hippocrates was the\r\nmost celebrated physician and natural philosopher of the ancient world.\r\nHis evidence is unshakeable and cannot be invalidated by the Aryan\r\nspeech of the Scythians. Their Mongol type was innate in them, whereas\r\ntheir Iranian speech was acquired and is no refutation of Hippocrates'\r\ntestimony. On the later Greek vases from South Russian excavations they\r\nalready appear strongly demongolised and the Altaian is only suggested\r\nby their hair, which is as stiff as a horse's mane--hence Aristotle's\r\nepithet [Greek: euthytriches]--the characteristic that survives\r\nlongest among all Ural-Altaian hybrid peoples.\r\n\r\nE. H. Parker unfortunately lent the weight of his authority to the\r\nstatement that the word \"Tuerkoe\" [Turki] \"goes no farther back than the\r\nfifth century of our era,\" and that \"so far as recorded history is\r\nconcerned the name of Turk dates from this time[679].\" But Turki tribes\r\nbearing this national name had penetrated into East Europe hundreds of\r\nyears before that time, and were already seated on the Tanais (Don)\r\nabout the new era. They are mentioned by name both by Pomponius\r\nMela[680] and by Pliny[681], and to the same connection belonged, beyond\r\nall doubt, the warlike _Parthians_, who 300 years earlier were already\r\nseated on the confines of Iran and Turan, routed the legions of Crassus\r\nand Antony, and for five centuries (250 B.C.-229 A.D.) usurped the\r\nthrone of the \"King of Kings,\" holding sway from the Euphrates to the\r\nGanges, and from the Caspian to the Indian Ocean. Direct descendants of\r\nthe Parthians are the fierce Turkoman nomads, who for ages terrorised\r\nover all the settled populations encircling the Aralo-Caspian\r\ndepression. Their power has at last been broken by the Russians, but\r\nthey are still politically dominant in Persia[682]. They have thus been\r\nfor many ages in the closest contact with Caucasic Iranians, with the\r\nresult that the present Turkoman type is shown by J. L. Yavorsky's\r\nobservations to be extremely variable[683].\r\n\r\nBoth the Parthians and the _Massagetae_ have been identified with the\r\n_Yue-chi_, who figured so largely in the annals of the Han dynasties,\r\nand are above mentioned as having been driven west to Sungaria by the\r\nHiung-nu after the erection of the Great Wall. It has been said that,\r\ncould we follow the peregrinations of the Yue-chi bands from their early\r\nseats at the foot of the Kinghan mountains to their disappearance amid\r\nthe snows of the Western Himalayas, we should hold the key to the\r\nsolution of the obscure problems associated with the migrations of the\r\nMongolo-Turki hordes since the torrent of invasion was diverted\r\nwestwards by Shih Hwang Ti's mighty barrier. One point, however, seems\r\nclear enough, that the Yue-chi were a different people both from the\r\nParthians who had already occupied Hyrcania (Khorasan) at least in the\r\nthird century B.C., if not earlier, and from the Massagetae. For the\r\nlatter were seated on the Yaxartes (Sir-darya) in the time of Cyrus\r\n(sixth century B.C.), whereas the Yue-chi still dwelt east of Lake Lob\r\n(Tarim basin) in the third century. After their defeat by the Hiung-nu\r\nand the Usuns (201 and 165 B.C.), they withdrew to Sogdiana\r\n(Transoxiana), reduced the _Ta-Hia_ of Baktria, and in 126 B.C.\r\noverthrew the Graeco-Baktrian kingdom, which had been founded after the\r\ndeath of Alexander towards the close of the fourth century. But in the\r\nKabul valley, south of the Hindu-Kush, the Greeks still held their\r\nground for over 100 years, until Kadphises I., king of the Kushans--a\r\nbranch of the Yue-chi--after uniting the whole nation in a single\r\nIndo-Scythian state, extended his conquests to Kabul and succeeded\r\nHermaeus, last of the Greek dynasty (40-20 B.C.?). Kadphises' son\r\nKadaphes (10 A.D.) added to his empire a great part of North India,\r\nwhere his successors of the Yue-chi dynasty reigned from the middle of\r\nthe first to the end of the fourth century A.D. Here they are supposed\r\nby some authorities to be still represented by the _Jats_ and _Rajputs_,\r\nand even Prichard allows that the supposition \"does not appear\r\naltogether preposterous,\" although \"the physical characters of the Jats\r\nare very different from those attributed to the Yuetschi [Yue-chi] and\r\nthe kindred tribes [Suns, Kushans, etc.] by the writers cited by\r\nKlaproth and Abel Remusat, who say that they are of sanguine complexion\r\nwith blue eyes[684].\"\r\n\r\nWe now know that these characters present little difficulty when the\r\ncomposite origin of the Turki people is borne in mind. On the other hand\r\nit is interesting to note that the above-mentioned Ta-Hia have by some\r\nbeen identified with the warlike Scythian Dahae[685], and these with the\r\nDehiya or Dhe one of the great divisions of the Indian Jats. But if\r\nRawlinson[686] is right, the term _Dahae_ was not racial but social,\r\nmeaning _rustici_,--the peasantry as opposed to the nomads; hence the\r\nDahae are heard of everywhere throughout Irania, just as _Dehwar_[687]\r\nis still the common designation of the Tajik (Persian) peasantry in\r\nAfghanistan and Baluchistan. This is also the view taken by de Ujfalvy,\r\nwho identifies the Ta-Hia, not with the Scythian Dahae, or with any\r\nother particular tribe, but with the peaceful rural population of\r\nBaktriana[688], whose reduction by the Yue-chi, possibly Strabo's\r\nTokhari, was followed by the overthrow of the Graeco-Baktrians. The\r\nsolution of the puzzling Yue-chi-Jat problem would therefore seem to be\r\nthat the Dehiya and other Jats, always an agricultural people, are\r\ndescended from the old Iranian peasantry of Baktriana, some of whom\r\nfollowed the fortunes of their Greek rulers into Kabul valley, while\r\nothers accompanied the conquering Yue-chi founders of the Indo-Scythian\r\nempire into northern India.\r\n\r\nThen followed the overthrow of the Yue-chi themselves by the _Ye-tha_\r\n(_Ye-tha-i-li-to_) of the Chinese records, that is, the _Ephthalites_,\r\nor so-called \"White Huns,\" of the Greek and Arab writers, who about 425\r\nA.D. overran Transoxiana, and soon afterwards penetrated through the\r\nmountain passes into the Kabul and Indus valleys. Although confused by\r\nsome contemporary writers (Zosimus, Am. Marcellinus) with Attila's Huns,\r\nM. Drouin has made it clear that the Ye-tha were not Huns (Mongols) at\r\nall, but, like the Yue-chi, a Turki people, who were driven westwards\r\nabout the same time as the Hiung-nu by the Yuan-yuans (see above). Of\r\nHun they had little but the name, and the more accurate Procopius was\r\naware that they differed entirely from \"the Huns known to us, not being\r\nnomads, but settled for a long time in a fertile region.\" He speaks also\r\nof their white colour and regular features, and their sedentary\r\nlife[689] as in the Chinese accounts, where they are described as\r\nwarlike conquerors of twenty kingdoms, as far as that of the A-si\r\n(Arsacides, Parthians), and in their customs resembling the Tu-Kiu\r\n(Turks), being in fact \"of the same race.\" On the ruins of the\r\nIndo-Scythian (Yue-chi) empire, the White Huns ruled in India and the\r\nsurrounding lands from 425 to the middle of the sixth century. A little\r\nlater came the Arabs, who in 706 captured Samarkand, and under the\r\nAbassides were supreme in Central Asia till scattered to the winds by\r\nthe Oghuz Turki hordes.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it has been suggested that--while the Baktrian peasants\r\nentered India as settlers, and are now represented by the agricultural\r\nJats--the Yue-chi and Ye-tha, both of fair Turki stock, came as\r\nconquerors, and are now represented by the Rajputs, \"Sons of Kings,\" the\r\nwarrior and land-owning race of northern India. It is significant that\r\nthese Thakur, \"feudal lords,\" mostly trace their genealogies from about\r\nthe beginning of the seventh century, as if they had become Hinduized\r\nsoon after the fall of the foreign Ye-tha dynasty, while on the other\r\nhand \"the country legends abound with instances of the conflict between\r\nthe Rajput and the Brahman in prehistoric times[690].\" This supports the\r\nconjecture that the Rajputs entered India, not as \"Aryans\" of the\r\nKshatriya or military caste, as is commonly assumed, but as aliens\r\n(Turki), the avowed foes of the true Aryans, that is, the Brahman or\r\ntheocratic (priestly) caste. Thus also is explained the intimate\r\nassociation of the Rajputs and the Jats from the first--the Rajputs\r\nbeing the Turki leaders of the invasions; and the Jats their peaceful\r\nBaktrian subjects following in their wake.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the haughty Rajputs are of unsullied \"Aryan blood\" is\r\nscarcely any longer held even by the Rajputs themselves; they are\r\nundoubtedly of mixed origin. But the definite physical type which H. H.\r\nRisley[691] describes as characteristic of Rajputs and Jats in the\r\nKashmir Valley, Punjab and Rajputana, shows them to be wavy-haired\r\ndark-skinned dolichocephals, linked rather with the \"Caucasic\" than the\r\n\"Mongolian\" division.\r\n\r\nNearly related to the White Huns were the _Uigurs_, the _Kao-che_ of the\r\nChinese annals, who may claim to be the first Turki nation that founded\r\na relatively civilised State in Central Asia. Before the general\r\ncommotion caused by the westward pressure of the Hiung-nu, they appear\r\nto have dwelt in eastern Turkestan (Kashgaria) between the Usuns and the\r\nSacae, and here they had already made considerable progress under\r\nBuddhist influences about the fourth or fifth century of the new era.\r\nLater, the Buddhist missionaries from Tibet were replaced by Christian\r\n(Nestorian) evangelists from western Asia, who in the seventh century\r\nreduced the Uigur language to written form, adapting for the purpose the\r\nSyriac alphabet, which was afterwards borrowed by the Mongols and the\r\nManchus.\r\n\r\nThis Syriac script--which, as shown by the authentic inscription of\r\nSi-ngan-fu, was introduced into China in 635 A.D.--is not to be confused\r\nwith that of the Orkhon inscriptions[692] dating from 732 A.D., and\r\nbearing a certain resemblance to some of the Runic characters, as also\r\nto the Korean, at least in form, but never in sound. Yet although\r\ndiffering from the Uiguric, Prof. Thomsen, who has successfully\r\ndeciphered the Orkhon text, thinks that this script may also be derived,\r\nat least indirectly through some of the Iranian varieties, from the same\r\nAramean (Syriac) form of the Semitic alphabet that gave birth to the\r\nUiguric[693].\r\n\r\nIt is more important to note that all the non-Chinese inscriptions are\r\nin the Turki language, while the Chinese text refers by name to the\r\nfather, the grandfather, and the great-grandfather of the reigning Khan\r\nBilga, which takes us back nearly to the time when Sinjibu (Dizabul),\r\nGreat Khan of the Altai Turks, was visited by the Byzantine envoy,\r\nZimarchus, in 569 A.D. In the still extant report of this embassy[694]\r\nthe Turks ([Greek: Tourkoi]) are mentioned by name, and are described as\r\nnomads who dwelt in tents mounted on wagons, burnt the dead, and raised\r\nto their memory monuments, statues, and cairns with as many stones as\r\nthe foes slain by the deceased in battle. It is also stated that they\r\nhad a peculiar writing system, which must have been that of these Orkhon\r\ninscriptions, the Uiguric having apparently been introduced somewhat\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nOriginally the Uigurs comprised nineteen clans, which at a remote period\r\nalready formed two great sections:--the On-Uigur (\"Ten Uigurs\") in the\r\nsouth, and the Toghuz-Uigur (\"Nine Uigurs\") in the north. The former had\r\npenetrated westwards to the Aral Sea[695] as early as the second century\r\nA.D., and many of them undoubtedly took part in Attila's invasion of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nLater, all these Western Uigurs, mentioned amongst the hordes that\r\nharassed the Eastern Empire in the fifth and sixth centuries, in\r\nassociation especially with the Turki Avars, disappear from history,\r\nbeing merged in the Ugrian and other Finnish peoples of the Volga basin.\r\nThe Toghuz section also, after throwing off the yoke of the Mongol or\r\nTungus Geugen (Jeu-Jen) in the fifth century, were for a time submerged\r\nin the vast empire of the Altai Turks, founded in 552 by Tumen of the\r\nHouse of Assena (A-shi-na), who was the first to assume the title of\r\nKha-Khan, \"Great Khan,\" and whose dynasty ruled over the united Turki\r\nand Mongol peoples from the Pacific to the Caspian, and from the Frozen\r\nOcean to the confines of China and Tibet. Both the above-mentioned\r\nSinjibu, who received the Byzantine envoy, and the Bilga Khan of the\r\nOrkhon _stele_, belonged to this dynasty, which was replaced in 774 by\r\nPei-lo (Huei-hu), chief of the Toghuz-Uigurs. This is how we are to\r\nunderstand the statement that all the Turki peoples who during the\r\nsomewhat unstable rule of the Assena dynasty from 552 to 774 had\r\nundergone many vicissitudes, and about 580 were even broken into two\r\ngreat sections (Eastern Turks of the Karakoram region and Western Turks\r\nof the Tarim basin), were again united in one vast political system\r\nunder the Toghuz-Uigurs. These are henceforth known in history simply as\r\nUigurs, the On branch having, as stated, long disappeared in the West.\r\nThe centre of their power seems to have oscillated between Karakoram and\r\nTurfan in Eastern Turkestan, the extensive ruins of which have been\r\nexplored by D. A. Klements, Sven Hedin and M. A. Stein. Their vast\r\ndominions were gradually dismembered, first by the _Hakas_, or\r\n_Ki-li-Kisse_, precursors of the present Kirghiz, who overran the\r\neastern (Orkhon) districts about 840, and then by the Muhammadans of\r\nMawar-en-Nahar (Transoxiana), who overthrew the \"Lion Kings,\" as the\r\nUigur Khans of Turfan were called, and set up several petty Mussulman\r\nstates in Eastern Turkestan. Later they fell under the yoke of the\r\nKara-Khitais, and were amongst the first to join the devastating hordes\r\nof Jenghiz-Khan; their name, which henceforth vanishes from\r\nhistory[696], has been popularly recognised under the form of \"Ogres,\"\r\nin fable and nursery tales, but the derivation lacks historical\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nAt present the heterogeneous populations of the Tarim basin (Kashgaria,\r\nEastern Turkestan), where the various elements have been intermingled,\r\noffer a striking contrast to those of the Ili valley (Sungaria), where\r\none invading horde has succeeded and been superimposed on another. Hence\r\nthe complexity of the Kashgarian type, in which the original \"horse-like\r\nface\" everywhere crops out, absorbing the later Mongolo-Turki arrivals.\r\nBut in Sungaria the Kalmuk, Chinese, Dungan, Taranchi, and Kirghiz\r\ngroups are all still sharply distinguished and perceptible at a glance.\r\n\"Amongst the Kashgarians--a term as vague ethnically as\r\n'Aryan'--Richthofen has determined the successive presence of the Su,\r\nYue-chi, and Usun hordes, as described in the early Chinese\r\nchronicles[697].\"\r\n\r\nThe recent explorations of M. A. Stein have thrown some light on the\r\nethnology of this region, and a preliminary survey of results was\r\nprepared and published by T. A. Joyce. He concludes that the original\r\ninhabitants were of Alpine type, with, in the west, traces of the\r\nIndo-Afghan, and that the Mongolian has had very little influence upon\r\nthe population[698].\r\n\r\nIn close proximity to the Toghuz-Uigurs dwelt the _Oghuz_ (_Ghuz, Uz_),\r\nfor whom eponymous heroes have been provided in the legendary records of\r\nthe Eastern Turks, although all these terms would appear to be merely\r\nshortened forms of Toghuz[699]. But whether true Uigurs, or a distinct\r\nbranch of the Turki people, the Ghuz, as they are commonly called by\r\nthe Arab writers, began their westward migrations about the year 780.\r\nAfter occupying Transoxiana, where they are now represented by the\r\nUzbegs[700] of Bokhara and surrounding lands, they gradually spread as\r\nconquerors over all the northern parts of Irania, Asia Minor, Syria, the\r\nRussian and Caucasian steppes, Ukrainia, Dacia, and the Balkan\r\nPeninsula. In most of these lands they formed fresh ethnical\r\ncombinations both with the Caucasic aborigines, and with many kindred\r\nTurki as well as Mongol peoples, some of whom were settled in these\r\nregions since neolithic times, while others had either accompanied\r\nAttila's expeditions, or followed in his wake (Pechenegs, Komans, Alans,\r\nKipchaks, Kara-Kalpaks), or else arrived later in company with\r\nJenghiz-Khan and his successors (Kazan and Nogai \"Tatars\"[701]).\r\n\r\nIn Russia, Rumania (Dacia), and most of the Balkan Peninsula these\r\nMongolo-Turki blends have been again submerged by the dominant Slav and\r\nRumanian peoples (Great and Little Russians, Servo-Croatians,\r\nMontenegrini, Moldavians, and Walachians). But in south-western Asia\r\nthey still constitute perhaps the majority of the population between the\r\nIndus and Constantinople, in many places forming numerous compact\r\ncommunities, in which the Mongolo-Turki physical and mental characters\r\nare conspicuous. Such, besides the already mentioned Turkomans of\r\nParthian lineage, are all the nomad and many of the settled inhabitants\r\nof Khiva, Ferghana, Karategin, Bokhara, generally comprised under the\r\nname of Uzbegs and \"Sartes.\" Such also are the Turki peoples of Afghan\r\nTurkestan, and of the neighbouring uplands (Hazaras and Aimaks who claim\r\nMongol descent, though now of Persian speech); the Aderbaijani and many\r\nother more scattered groups in Persia; the Nogai and Kumuk tribes of\r\nCaucasia, and especially most of the nomad and settled agricultural\r\npopulations of Asia Minor. The Anatolian peasantry form, in fact, the\r\nmost numerous and compact division of the Turki family still surviving\r\nin any part of their vast domain between the Bosporus and the Lena.\r\n\r\nOut of this prolific Oghuz stock arose many renowned chiefs, founders of\r\nvast but somewhat unstable empires, such as those of the Gasnevides, who\r\nruled from Persia to the Indus; the Seljuks, who first wrested the\r\nAsiatic provinces from Byzantium; the Osmanli, so named from Othman, the\r\nArabised form of Athman, who prepared the way for Orkhan (1326-60), true\r\nbuilder of the Ottoman power, which has alone survived the shipwreck of\r\nall the historical Turki states. The vicissitudes of these monarchies,\r\nlooked on perhaps with too kindly an eye by Gibbon, belong to the domain\r\nof history, and it will suffice here to state that from the ethnical\r\nstandpoint the chief interest centres in that of the Seljukides,\r\ncovering the period from about the middle of the eleventh to the middle\r\nof the thirteenth century. It was under Togrul-beg of this dynasty\r\n(1038-63) that \"the whole body of the Turkish nation embraced with\r\nfervour and sincerity the religion of Mahomet[702].\" A little later\r\nbegan the permanent Turki occupation of Asia Minor, where, after the\r\nconquest of Armenia (1065-68) and the overthrow of the Byzantine emperor\r\nRomanus Diogenes (1071), numerous military settlements, followed by\r\nnomad Turkoman encampments, were established by the great Seljuk rulers,\r\nAlp Arslan and Malek Shah (1063-92), at all the strategical points.\r\nThese first arrivals were joined later by others fleeing before the\r\nMongol hosts led by Jenghiz-Khan's successors down to the time of\r\nTimur-beg. But the Christians (Greeks and earlier aborigines) were not\r\nexterminated, and we read that, while great numbers apostatised, \"many\r\nthousand children were marked by the knife of circumcision; and many\r\nthousand captives were devoted to the service or the pleasures of their\r\nmasters\" (_ib._). In other words, the already mixed Turki intruders were\r\nyet more modified by further interminglings with the earlier inhabitants\r\nof Asia Minor. Those who, following the fortunes of the Othman dynasty,\r\ncrossed the Bosporus and settled in Rumelia and some other parts of the\r\nBalkan Peninsula, now prefer to call themselves _Osmanli_, even\r\nrepudiating the national name \"Turk\" still retained with pride by the\r\nruder peasant classes of Asia Minor. The latter are often spoken of as\r\n\"Seljuk Turks,\" as if there were some racial difference between them and\r\nthe European Osmanli, and for the distinction there is some foundation.\r\nAs pointed out by Arminius Vambery[703], the Osmanli have been\r\ninfluenced and modified by their closer association with the Christian\r\npopulations of the Balkan lands, while in Anatolia the Seljuks have been\r\nable better to preserve the national type and temperament. The true\r\nTurki spirit (\"das Tuerkentum\") survives especially in the provinces of\r\nLykaonia and Kappadokia, where the few surviving natives were not only\r\nIslamised but ethnically fused, whereas in Europe most of them\r\n(Bosnians, Albanians) were only Islamised, and here the Turki element\r\nhas always been slight.\r\n\r\nAt present the original Turki type and temperament are perhaps best\r\npreserved amongst the remote _Yakuts_ of the Lena, and the _Kirghiz_\r\ngroups (_Kirghiz Kazaks_ and _Kara Kirghiz_) of the West Siberian steppe\r\nand the Pamir uplands. The Turki connection of the Yakuts, about which\r\nsome unnecessary doubts had been raised, has been set at rest by V. A.\r\nSierochevsky[704], who, however, describes them as now a very mixed\r\npeople, owing to alliances with the Tunguses and Russians. They are of\r\nshort stature, averaging scarcely 5 ft. 4 in., and this observer thought\r\ntheir dark but not brilliant black eyes, deeply sunk in narrow orbits,\r\ngave them more of a Red Indian than of a Mongol cast. They are almost\r\nthe only progressive aboriginal people in Siberia, although numbering\r\nnot more than 200,000 souls, concentrated chiefly along the river banks\r\non the plateau between the Lena and the Aldan.\r\n\r\nIn the Yakuts we have an extreme instance of the capacity of man to\r\nadapt himself to the _milieu_. They not merely exist, but thrive and\r\ndisplay a considerable degree of energy and enterprise in the coldest\r\nregion on the globe. Within the isothermal of -72 deg. Fahr., Verkhoyansk,\r\nin the heart of their territory, is alone included, for the period from\r\nNovember to February, and in this temperature, at which the quicksilver\r\nfreezes, the Yakut children may be seen gambolling naked in the snow. In\r\nmidwinter R. Kennan met some of these \"men of iron,\" as Wrangel calls\r\nthem, airily arrayed in nothing but a shirt and a sheepskin, lounging\r\nabout as if in the enjoyment of the balmy zephyrs of some genial\r\nsub-tropical zone.\r\n\r\nAlthough nearly all are Orthodox Christians, or at least baptized as\r\nsuch, they are mere Shamanists at heart, still conjuring the powers of\r\nnature, but offering no worship to a supreme deity, of whom they have a\r\nvague notion, though he is too far off to hear, or too good to need\r\ntheir supplications. The world of good and evil spirits, however, has\r\nbeen enriched by accessions from the Russian calendar and pandemonium.\r\nThanks to their commercial spirit, the Yakut language, a very pure Turki\r\nidiom, is even more widespread than the race, having become a general\r\nmedium of intercourse for Tungus, Russian, Mongol and other traders\r\nthroughout East Siberia, from Irkutsk to the Sea of Okhotsk, and from\r\nthe Chinese frontier to the Arctic Ocean[705].\r\n\r\nTo some extent W. Radloff is right in describing the great Kirghiz Turki\r\nfamily as \"of all Turks most nearly allied to the Mongols in their\r\nphysical characters, and by their family names such as Kyptshak\r\n[Kipchak], Argyn, Naiman, giving evidence of Mongolian descent, or at\r\nleast of intermixture with Mongols[706].\" But we have already been\r\nwarned against the danger of attaching too much importance to these\r\ntribal designations, many of which seem, after acquiring renown on the\r\nbattle-field, to have passed readily from one ethnic group to another.\r\nThere are certain Hindu-Kush and Afghan tribes who think themselves\r\nGreeks or Arabs, because of the supposed descent of their chiefs from\r\nAlexander the Great or the Prophet's family, and genealogical trees\r\nspring up like the conjurer's mango plant in support of such illustrious\r\nlineage. The Chagatai (Jagatai) tribes, of Turki stock and speech, take\r\ntheir name from a full-blood Mongol, Chagatai, second son of\r\nJenghiz-Khan, to whom fell Eastern Turkestan in the partition of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nIn the same way many Uzbeg and Kirghiz Turki tribes are named from\r\nfamous Mongol chiefs, although no one will deny a strain of true Mongol\r\nblood in all these heterogeneous groups. This is evident enough from the\r\nsquare and somewhat flat Mongol features, prominent cheek-bones, oblique\r\neyes, large mouth, feet and hands, yellowish brown complexion, ungainly\r\nobese figures and short stature, all of which are characteristic of\r\nboth sections, the Kara-Kirghiz highlanders, and the Kazaks of the\r\nlowlands. Some ethnologists regard these Kirghiz groups, not as a\r\ndistinct branch of the Mongolo-Turki race, but rather as a confederation\r\nof several nomad tribes stretching from the Gobi to the Lower Volga, and\r\nmingled together by Jenghiz-Khan and his successors[707].\r\n\r\nThe true national name is _Kazak_, \"Riders,\" and as they were originally\r\nfor the most part mounted marauders, or free lances of the steppe, the\r\nterm came to be gradually applied to all nomad and other horsemen\r\nengaged in predatory warfare. It thus at an early date reached the South\r\nRussian steppe, where it was adopted in the form of _Kossack_ by the\r\nRussians themselves. It should be noted that the compound term\r\nKirghiz-Kazak, introduced by the Russians to distinguish these nomads\r\nfrom their own Cossacks, is really a misnomer. The word \"Kirghiz,\"\r\nwhatever its origin, is never used by the Kazaks in reference to\r\nthemselves, but only to their near relations, the Kirghiz, or\r\nKara-Kirghiz[708], of the uplands.\r\n\r\nThese highlanders, who roam the Tian-Shan and Pamir valleys, form two\r\nsections:--_On_, \"Right,\" or East, and _Sol_, \"Left,\" or West. They are\r\nthe _Diko Kamennyi_, that is, \"Wild Rock People,\" of the Russians,\r\nwhence the expression \"Block Kirghiz\" still found in some English books\r\nof travel. But they call themselves simply Kirghiz, claiming descent\r\nfrom an original tribe of that name, itself sprung from a legendary\r\nKirghiz-beg, from whom are also descended the Chiliks, Kitars and\r\nothers, all now reunited with the Ons and the Sols.\r\n\r\nThe Kazaks also are grouped in long-established and still jealously\r\nmaintained sections--the _Great_, _Middle_, _Little_, and _Inner\r\nHorde_--whose joint domain extends from Lake Balkash round the north\r\nside of the Caspian down to the Lower Volga[709]. All accepted the\r\nteachings of Islam many centuries ago, but their Muhammadanism[710] is\r\nof a somewhat negative character, without mosques, mollahs, or\r\nfanaticism, and in practice not greatly to be distinguished from the old\r\nSiberian Shamanism. Kumiss, fermented mare's milk, their universal\r\ndrink, as amongst the ancient Scythians, plays a large part in the life\r\nof these hospitable steppe nomads.\r\n\r\nOne of the lasting results of Castren's labours has been to place beyond\r\nreasonable doubt the Altai origin of the Finnish peoples[711]. Their\r\ncradle may now be localised with some confidence about the head waters\r\nof the Yenisei, in proximity to that of their Turki kinsmen. Here is the\r\nseat of the _Soyotes_ and of the closely allied _Koibals_,\r\n_Kamassintzi_, _Matores_, _Karagasses_ and others, who occupy a\r\nconsiderable territory along both slopes of the Sayan range, and may be\r\nregarded as the primitive stock of the widely diffused Finnish race.\r\nSome of these groups have intermingled with the neighbouring Turki\r\npeoples, and even speak Turki dialects. But the original Finnish type\r\nand speech are well represented by the Soyotes, who are here indigenous,\r\nand \"from these their ... kinsmen, the Samoyeds have spread as breeders\r\nof reindeer to the north of the continent from the White Sea to the Bay\r\nof Chatanga[712].\" Others, following a westerly route along the foot of\r\nthe Altai and down the Irtysh to the Urals, appear to have long occupied\r\nboth slopes of that range, where they acquired some degree of culture,\r\nand especially that knowledge of, and skill in working, the precious and\r\nother metals, for which the \"White-eyed Chudes\" were famous, and to\r\nwhich repeated reference is made in the songs of the _Kalevala_[713].\r\nAs there are no mines or minerals in Finland itself, it seems obvious\r\nthat the legendary heroes of the Finnish national epic must have dwelt\r\nin some metalliferous region, which could only be the Altai or the\r\nUrals, possibly both.\r\n\r\nIn any case the Urals became a second home and point of dispersion for\r\nthe Finnish tribes (_Ugrian Finns_), whose migrations--some prehistoric,\r\nsome historic--can be followed thence down the Pechora and Dvina to the\r\nFrozen Ocean[714], and down the Kama to the Volga. From this artery,\r\nwhere permanent settlements were formed (_Volga Finns_), some conquering\r\nhordes went south and west (_Danubian Finns_), while more peaceful\r\nwanderers ascended the great river to Lakes Ladoga and Onega, and thence\r\nto the shores of the Baltic and Lapland (_Baltic and Lake Finns_).\r\n\r\nThus were constituted the main branches of the widespread Finnish\r\nfamily, whose domain formerly extended from the Katanga beyond the\r\nYenisei to Lapland, and from the Arctic Ocean to the Altai range, the\r\nCaspian, and the Volga, with considerable _enclaves_ in the Danube\r\nbasin. But throughout their relatively short historic life the Finnish\r\npeoples, despite a characteristic tenacity and power of resistance, have\r\nin many places been encroached upon, absorbed, or even entirely\r\neliminated, by more aggressive races, such as the Siberian \"Tatars\" in\r\ntheir Altai cradleland, the Turki Kirghiz and Bashkirs in the West\r\nSiberian steppes and the Urals, the Russians in the Volga and Lake\r\ndistricts, the Germans and Lithuanians in the Baltic Provinces (Kurland,\r\nLivonia, Esthonia), the Rumanians, Slavs, and others in the Danube\r\nregions, where the Ugrian Bulgars and Magyars have been almost entirely\r\nassimilated in type (and the former also in speech) to the surrounding\r\nEuropean populations.\r\n\r\nFew anthropologists now attach much importance to the views not yet\r\nquite obsolete regarding a former extension of the Finnish race over\r\nthe whole of Europe and the British Isles. Despite the fact that all the\r\nFinns are essentially round-headed, they were identified first with the\r\nlong-headed cavemen, who retreated north with the reindeer, as was the\r\nfavourite hypothesis, and then with the early neolithic races who were\r\nalso long-headed. Elaborate but now forgotten essays were written by\r\nlearned philologists to establish a common origin of the Basque and the\r\nFinnic tongues, which have nothing in common, and half the myths,\r\nfolklore, and legendary heroes of the western nations were traced to\r\nFinno-Ugrian sources.\r\n\r\nNow we know better, and both archaeologists and philologists have made\r\nit evident that the Finnish peoples are relatively quite recent arrivals\r\nin Europe, that the men of the Bronze Age in Finland itself were not\r\nFinns but Teutons, and that at the beginning of the new era all the\r\nFinnish tribes still dwelt east of the Gulf of Finland[715].\r\n\r\nNot only so, but the eastern migrations themselves, as above roughly\r\noutlined, appear to have taken place at a relatively late epoch, long\r\nafter the inhabitants of West Siberia had passed from the New Stone to\r\nthe Metal Ages. J. R. Aspelin, \"founder of Finno-Ugrian archaeology,\"\r\npoints out that the Finno-Ugrian peoples originally occupied a\r\ngeographical position between the Indo-Germanic and the Mongolic races,\r\nand that their first Iron Age was most probably a development, between\r\nthe Yenisei and the Kama, of the so-called Ural-Altai Bronze Age, the\r\nlast echoes of which may be traced westwards to Finland and North\r\nScandinavia. In the Upper Yenisei districts iron objects had still the\r\nforms of the Bronze Age, when that ancient civilisation, associated with\r\nthe name of the \"Chudes,\" was interrupted by an invasion which\r\nintroduced the still persisting Turki Iron Age, expelled the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants, and thus gave rise to the great migrations first of the\r\nFinno-Ugrians, and then of the Turki peoples (Bashkirs, Volga \"Tatars\"\r\nand others) to and across the Urals. It was here, in the Permian\r\nterritory between the Irtysh and the Kama, that the West Siberian\r\n(Chudish) Iron Age continued its normal and unbroken evolution. The\r\nobjects recovered from the old graves and kurgans in the present\r\ngovernments of Tver and Iaroslav, and especially at Ananyino on the\r\nKama, centre of this culture, show that here took place the transition\r\nfrom the Bronze to the Iron Age some 300 years before the new era, and\r\nhere was developed a later Iron Age, whose forms are characteristic of\r\nthe northern Finno-Ugrian lands. The whole region would thus appear to\r\nhave been first occupied by these immigrants from Asia after the\r\nirruption of the Turki hordes into Western Siberia during the first Iron\r\nAge, at most some 500 or 600 years before the Christian era. The\r\nFinno-Ugrian migrations are thus limited to a period of not more than\r\n2600 years from the present time, and this conclusion, based on\r\narchaeological grounds, agrees fairly well with the historical,\r\nlinguistic, and ethnical data.\r\n\r\nIt is especially in this obscure field of research that the eminent\r\nDanish scholar, Vilhelm Thomsen, has rendered inestimable services to\r\nEuropean ethnology. By the light of his linguistic studies A. H.\r\nSnellman[716] has elucidated the origins of the Baltic Finns, the\r\nProto-Esthonians, the now all but extinct Livonians, and the quite\r\nextinct Kurlanders, from the time when they still dwelt east and\r\nsouth-east of the Baltic lands, under the influence of the surrounding\r\nLithuanian and Gothic tribes, till the German conquest of the Baltic\r\nprovinces. We learn from Jordanes, to whom is due the first authentic\r\naccount of these populations, that the various Finnish tribes were\r\nsubject to the Gothic king Hermanarich, and Thomsen now shows that all\r\nthe Western Finns (Esthonians, Livonians, Votes, Vepses, Karelians,\r\nTavastians, and others of Finland) must in the first centuries of the\r\nnew era have lived practically as one people in the closest social\r\nunion, speaking one language, and following the same religious, tribal,\r\nand political institutions. Earlier than the Gothic was the\r\nLetto-Lithuanian contact, as shown by the fact that its traces are\r\nperceptible in the language of the Volga Finns, in which German\r\nloan-words are absent. From these investigations it becomes clear that\r\nthe Finnish domain must at that time have stretched from the present\r\nEsthonia, Livonia, and Lake Ladoga south to the western Dvina.\r\n\r\nThe westward movement was connected with the Slav migrations. When the\r\nSlavs south of the Letts moved west, other Slav tribes must have pushed\r\nnorth, thus driving both Letts and Finns west to the Baltic provinces,\r\nwhich had previously been occupied by the Germans (Goths). Some of the\r\nWestern Finns must have found their way about 500 A.D., scarcely\r\nearlier, into parts of this region, where they came into hostile and\r\nfriendly contact with the Norsemen. These relations would even appear to\r\nbe reflected in the Norse mythology, which may be regarded as in great\r\nmeasure an echo of historic events. The wars of the Swedish and Danish\r\nkings referred to in these oral records may be interpreted as plundering\r\nexpeditions rather than permanent conquests, while the undoubtedly\r\nactive intercourse between the east and west coasts of the Baltic may be\r\nexplained on the assumption that, after the withdrawal of the Goths, a\r\nremnant of the Germanic populations remained behind in the Baltic\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nFrom Nestor's statement that all three of the Varangian princes settled,\r\nnot amongst Slavish but amongst Finnish peoples, it may be inferred that\r\nthe Finnish element constituted the most important section in the newly\r\nfounded Russian State; and it may here be mentioned that the term \"Russ\"\r\nitself has now been traced to the Finnish word _Ruost_ (_Ruosti_), a\r\n\"Norseman.\" But although at first greatly outnumbering the Slavs, the\r\nFinnish peoples soon lost the political ascendancy, and their subsequent\r\nhistory may be summed up in the expression--gradual absorption in the\r\nsurrounding Slav populations. This inevitable process is still going on\r\namongst all the Volga, Lake and Baltic Finns, except in Finland and\r\nLapland, where other conditions obtain[717].\r\n\r\nMost Finnish ethnologists agree that however much they may now differ in\r\ntheir physical and mental characters and usages, Finns and Lapps were\r\nall originally one people. Some variant of _Suoma_[718] enters into the\r\nnational name of all the Baltic groups--_Suomalaiset_, the Finns of\r\nFinland, _Somelaized_, those of Esthonia, _Samelats_ (Sabmelad), the\r\nLapps, _Samoyad_, the Samoyeds. In Ohthere's time the Norsemen called\r\nall the Lapps \"Finnas\" (as the Norwegians still do), and that early\r\nnavigator already noticed that these \"Finns\" seemed to speak the same\r\nlanguage as the Beormas, who were true Finns[719]. Nor do the present\r\ninhabitants of Finland, taken as a whole, differ more in outward\r\nappearance and temperament from their Lapp neighbours than do the\r\nTavastians and the Karelians, that is, their western and eastern\r\nsections, from each other. The Tavastians, who call themselves\r\nHemelaiset, \"Lake People,\" have rather broad, heavy frames, small and\r\noblique blue or grey eyes, towy hair and white complexion, without the\r\nclear florid colour of the North Germanic and English peoples. The\r\ntemperament is somewhat sluggish, passive and enduring, morose and\r\nvindictive, but honest and trustworthy.\r\n\r\nVery different are the tall, slim, active Karelians (_Karialaiset_,\r\n\"Cowherds,\" from _Kari_, \"Cow\"), with more regular features, straight\r\ngrey eyes, brown complexion, and chestnut hair, like that of the hero of\r\nthe Kalevala, hanging in ringlets down the shoulders. Many of the\r\nKarelians, and most of the neighbouring _Ingrians_ about the head of the\r\nGulf of Finland, as well as the Votes and Vepses of the great lakes,\r\nhave been assimilated in speech, religion, and usages to the surrounding\r\nRussian populations. But the more conservative Tavastians have hitherto\r\ntenaciously preserved the national sentiment, language, and traditions.\r\nDespite the pressure of Sweden on the west, and of Russia on the east,\r\nthe Finns still stand out as a distinct European nationality, and\r\ncontinue to cultivate with success their harmonious and highly poetical\r\nlanguage. Since the twelfth century they have been Christians, converted\r\nto the Catholic faith by \"Saint\" Eric, King of Sweden, and later to\r\nLutheranism, again by the Swedes[720]. The national university, removed\r\nin 1827 from Abo to Helsingfors, is a centre of much scientific and\r\nliterary work, and here E. Loennrot, father of Finnish literature,\r\nbrought out his various editions of the _Kalevala_, that of 1849\r\nconsisting of some 50,000 strophes[721].\r\n\r\nA kind of transition from these settled and cultured Finns to the Lapps\r\nof Scandinavia and Russia is formed by the still almost nomad, or at\r\nleast restless _Kwaens_, who formerly roamed as far as the White Sea,\r\nwhich in Alfred's time was known as the _Cwen Sae_ (Kwaen Sea). These\r\nKwaens, who still number nearly 300,000, are even called nomads by J. A.\r\nFriis, who tells us that there is a continual movement of small bands\r\nbetween Finland and Scandinavia. \"The wandering Kwaens pass round the\r\nGulf of Bothnia and up through Lappmarken to Kittalae, where they\r\nseparate, some going to Varanger, and others to Alten. They follow the\r\nsame route as that which, according to historians, some of the Norsemen\r\nfollowed in their wanderings from Finland[722].\" The references of the\r\nSagas are mostly to these primitive Bothnian Finns, with whom the\r\nNorsemen first came in contact, and who in the sixth and following\r\ncenturies were still in a rude state not greatly removed from that of\r\ntheir Ugrian forefathers. As shown by Almqvist's researches, they lived\r\nalmost exclusively by hunting and fishing, had scarcely a rudimentary\r\nknowledge of agriculture, and could prepare neither butter nor cheese\r\nfrom the milk of their half-wild reindeer herds.\r\n\r\nSuch were also, and in some measure still are, the kindred Lapps, who\r\nwith the allied _Yurak Samoyeds_ of Arctic Russia are the only true\r\nnomads still surviving in Europe. A. H. Cocks, who travelled amongst all\r\nthese rude aborigines in 1888, describes the Kwaens who range north to\r\nLake Enara, as \"for the most part of a very rough class,\" and found that\r\nthe Russian Lapps of the Kola Peninsula, \"except as to their clothing\r\nand the addition of coffee and sugar to their food supply, are living\r\nnow much the same life as their ancestors probably lived 2000 or more\r\nyears ago, a far more primitive life, in fact, than the Reindeer Lapps\r\n[of Scandinavia]. They have not yet begun to use tobacco, and reading\r\nand writing are entirely unknown among them. Unlike the three other\r\ndivisions of the race [the Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish Lapps], they\r\nare a very cheerful, light-hearted people, and have the curious habit\r\nof expressing their thoughts aloud in extempore sing-song[723].\"\r\n\r\nSimilar traits have been noticed in the Samoyeds, whom F. G. Jackson\r\ndescribes as an extremely sociable and hospitable people, delighting in\r\ngossip, and much given to laughter and merriment[724]. He gives their\r\nmean height as nearly 5 ft. 2 in., which is about the same as that of\r\nthe Lapps (Von Dueben, 5 ft. 2 in., others rather less), while that of\r\nthe Finns averages 5 ft. 5 in. (Topinard). Although the general Mongol\r\nappearance is much less pronounced in the Lapps than in the Samoyeds, in\r\nsome respects--low stature, flat face with peculiar round outline--the\r\nlatter reminded Jackson of the Ziryanians, who are a branch of the\r\nBeormas (Permian Finns), though like them now much mixed with the\r\nRussians. The so-called prehistoric \"Lapp Graves,\" occurring throughout\r\nthe southern parts of Scandinavia, are now known from their contents to\r\nhave belonged to the Norse race, who appear to have occupied this region\r\nsince the New Stone Age, while the Lapp domain seems never to have\r\nreached very much farther south than Trondhjem.\r\n\r\nAll these facts, taken especially in connection with the late arrival of\r\nthe Finns themselves in Finland, lend support to the view that the Lapps\r\nare a branch, not of the Suomalaiset, but of the Permian Finns, and\r\nreached their present homes, not from Finland, but from North Russia\r\nthrough the Kanin and Kola Peninsulas, if not round the shores of the\r\nWhite Sea, at some remote period prior to the occupation of Finland by\r\nits present inhabitants. This assumption would also explain Ohthere's\r\nstatement that Lapps and Permians seemed to speak nearly the same\r\nlanguage. The resemblance is still close, though I am not competent to\r\nsay to which branch of the Finno-Ugrian family Lapp is most nearly\r\nallied.\r\n\r\nOf the Mongol physical characters the Lapp still retains the round low\r\nskull (index 83), the prominent cheek-bones, somewhat flat features, and\r\nungainly figure. The temperament, also, is still perhaps more Asiatic\r\nthan European, although since the eighteenth century they have been\r\nChristians--Lutherans in Scandinavia, Orthodox in Russia. In pagan times\r\nShamanism had nowhere acquired a greater development than among the\r\nLapps. A great feature of the system were the \"rune-trees,\" made of\r\npine or birch bark, inscribed with figures of gods, men, or animals,\r\nwhich were consulted on all important occasions, and their mysterious\r\nsigns interpreted by the Shamans. Even foreign potentates hearkened to\r\nthe voice of these renowned magicians, and in England the expression\r\n\"Lapland witches\" became proverbial, although it appears that there\r\nnever were any witches, but only wizards, in Lapland. Such rites have\r\nlong ceased to be practised, although some of the crude ideas of a\r\nmaterial after-life still linger on. Money and other treasures are often\r\nburied or hid away, the owners dying without revealing the secret,\r\neither through forgetfulness, or more probably of set purpose in the\r\nhope of thus making provision for the other world.\r\n\r\nAmongst the kindred Samoyeds, despite their Russian orthodoxy, the old\r\npagan beliefs enjoy a still more vigorous existence. \"As long as things\r\ngo well with him, he is a Christian; but should his reindeer die, or\r\nother catastrophe happen, he immediately returns to his old god _Num_ or\r\n_Chaddi_.... He conducts his heathen services by night and in secret,\r\nand carefully screens from sight any image of Chaddi[725].\" Jackson\r\nnoticed several instances of this compromise between the old and the\r\nnew, such as the wooden cross supplemented on the Samoyed graves by an\r\noverturned sledge to convey the dead safely over the snows of the\r\nunder-world, and the rings of stones, within which the human sacrifices\r\nwere perhaps formerly offered to propitiate Chaddi; and although these\r\nthings have ceased, \"it is only a few years ago that a Samoyad living on\r\nNovaia Zemlia sacrificed a young girl[726].\"\r\n\r\nSimilar beliefs and practices still prevail not only amongst the\r\nSiberian Finns--Ostyaks of the Yenisei and Obi rivers, Voguls of the\r\nUrals--but even amongst the Votyaks, Mordvinians, Cheremisses and other\r\nscattered groups still surviving in the Volga basin. So recently as the\r\nyear 1896 a number of Votyaks were tried and convicted for the murder of\r\na passing mendicant, whom they had beheaded to appease the wrath of\r\nKiremet, Spirit of Evil and author of the famine raging at that time in\r\nCentral Russia. Besides Kiremet, the Votyaks--who appear to have\r\nmigrated from the Urals to their present homes between the Kama and the\r\nViatka rivers about 400 A.D., and are mostly heathens--also worship\r\nInmar, God of Heaven, to whom they sacrifice animals as well as human\r\nbeings whenever it can be safely done. We are assured by Baron de Baye\r\nthat even the few who are baptized take part secretly in these\r\nunhallowed rites[727].\r\n\r\nTo the Ugrian branch, rudest and most savage of all the Finnish peoples,\r\nbelong these now moribund Volga groups, as well as the fierce Bulgar and\r\nMagyar hordes, if not also their precursors, the _Jazyges_ and\r\n_Rhoxolani_, who in the second century A.D. swarmed into Pannonia from\r\nthe Russian steppe, and in company with the Germanic Quadi and\r\nMarcomanni twice (168 and 172) advanced to the walls of Aquileia, and\r\nwere twice arrested by the legions of Marcus Aurelius and Verus. Of the\r\nonce numerous Jazyges, whom Pliny calls Sarmates, there were several\r\nbranches--_Maeotae_, Metanastae, _Basilii_ (\"Royal\")--who were first\r\nreduced by the Goths spreading from the Baltic to the Euxine and Lower\r\nDanube, and then overwhelmed with the Dacians, Getae, Bastarnae, and a\r\nhundred other ancient peoples in the great deluge of the Hunnish\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nFrom the same South Russian steppe--the plains watered by the Lower Don\r\nand Dnieper--came the _Bulgars_, first in association with the Huns,\r\nfrom whom they are scarcely distinguished by the early Byzantine\r\nwriters, and then as a separate people, who, after throwing off the yoke\r\nof the Avars (635 A.D.), withdrew before the pressure of the Khazars\r\nwestwards to the Lower Danube (678). But their records go much farther\r\nback than these dates, and while philologists and archaeologists are\r\nable to trace their wanderings step by step north to the Middle Volga\r\nand the Ural Mountains, authentic Armenian documents carry their history\r\nback to the second century B.C. Under the Arsacides numerous bands of\r\nBulgars, driven from their homes about the Kama confluence by civil\r\nstrife, settled on the banks of the Aras, and since that time (150-114\r\nB.C.) the Bulgars were known to the Armenians as a great nation dwelling\r\naway to the north far beyond the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally the name, which afterwards acquired such an odious notoriety\r\namongst the European peoples, may have been more geographical than\r\nethnical, implying not so much a particular nation as all the\r\ninhabitants of the _Bulga_ (Volga) between the Kama and the Caspian. But\r\nat that time this section of the great river seems to have been mainly\r\nheld by more or less homogeneous branches of the Finno-Ugrian family,\r\nand palethnologists have now shown that to this connection beyond all\r\nquestion belonged in physical appearance, speech, and usages those bands\r\nknown as Bulgars, who formed permanent settlements in Moesia south of\r\nthe Lower Danube towards the close of the seventh century[728]. Here\r\n\"these bold and dexterous archers, who drank the milk and feasted on the\r\nflesh of their fleet and indefatigable horses; whose flocks and herds\r\nfollowed, or rather guided, the motions of their roving camps; to whose\r\ninroads no country was remote or impervious, and who were practised in\r\nflight, though incapable of fear[729],\" established a powerful state,\r\nwhich maintained its independence for over seven hundred years\r\n(678-1392).\r\n\r\nActing at first in association with the Slavs, and then assuming \"a\r\nvague dominion\" over their restless Sarmatian allies, the Bulgars spread\r\nthe terror of their hated name throughout the Balkan lands, and were\r\nprevented only by the skill of Belisarius from anticipating their Turki\r\nkinsmen in the overthrow of the Byzantine Empire itself. Procopius and\r\nJornandes have left terrible pictures of the ferocity, debasement, and\r\nutter savagery, both of the Bulgars and of their Slav confederates\r\nduring the period preceding the foundation of the Bulgar dynasty in\r\nMoesia. Wherever the Slavs (Antes, Slavini) passed, no soul was left\r\nalive; Thrace and Illyria were strewn with unburied corpses; captives\r\nwere shut up with horse and cattle in stables, and all consumed\r\ntogether, while the brutal hordes danced to the music of their shrieks\r\nand groans. Indescribable was the horror inspired by the Bulgars, who\r\nkilled for killing's sake, wasted for sheer love of destruction, swept\r\naway all works of the human hand, burnt, razed cities, left in their\r\nwake nought but a picture of their own cheerless native steppes. Of all\r\nthe barbarians that harried the Empire, the Bulgars have left the most\r\ndetested name, although closely rivalled by the Slavs.\r\n\r\nTo the ethnologist the later history of the Bulgarians is of exceptional\r\ninterest. They entered the Danubian lands in the seventh century as\r\ntypical Ugro-Finns, repulsive alike in physical appearance and mental\r\ncharacters. Their dreaded chief, Krum, celebrated his triumphs with\r\nsanguinary rites, and his followers yielded in no respects to the Huns\r\nthemselves in coarseness and brutality. Yet an almost complete moral if\r\nnot physical transformation had been effected by the middle of the ninth\r\ncentury, when the Bulgars were evangelised by Byzantine missionaries,\r\nexchanged their rude Ugrian speech for a Slavonic tongue, the so-called\r\n\"Church Slav,\" or even \"Old Bulgarian,\" and became henceforth merged in\r\nthe surrounding Slav populations. The national name \"Bulgar\" alone\r\nsurvives, as that of a somewhat peaceful southern \"Slav\" people, who in\r\nour time again acquired the political independence of which they had\r\nbeen deprived by Bajazet I. in 1392.\r\n\r\nNor did this name disappear from the Volga lands after the great\r\nmigration of Bulgar hordes to the Don basin during the third and fourth\r\ncenturies A.D. On the contrary, here arose another and a greater Bulgar\r\nempire, which was known to the Byzantines of the tenth century as \"Black\r\nBulgaria,\" and later to the Arabs and Western peoples as \"Great\r\nBulgaria,\" in contradistinction to the \"Little Bulgaria\" south of the\r\nDanube[730]. It fell to pieces during the later \"Tatar\" wars, and\r\nnothing now remains of the Volga Bulgars, except the Volga itself from\r\nwhich they were named.\r\n\r\nIn the same region, but farther north[731], lay also a \"Great Hungary,\"\r\nthe original seat of those other Ugrian Finns known as Hungarians and\r\nMagyars, who followed later in the track of the Bulgars, and like them\r\nformed permanent settlements in the Danube basin, but higher up in\r\nPannonia, the present kingdom of Hungary. Here, however, the Magyars had\r\nbeen preceded by the kindred (or at least distantly connected) Avars,\r\nthe dominant people in the Middle Danube lands for a great part of the\r\nperiod between the departure of the Huns and the arrival of the\r\nMagyars[732]. Rolling up like a storm cloud from the depths of Siberia\r\nto the Volga and Euxine, sweeping everything before them, reducing\r\nKutigurs, Utigurs, Bulgars, and Slavs, the Avars presented themselves in\r\nthe sixth century on the frontiers of the empire as the unwelcome allies\r\nof Justinian. Arrested at the Elbe by the Austrasian Franks, and hard\r\npressed by the Gepidae, they withdrew to the Lower Danube under the\r\nferocious Khagan Bayan, who, before his overthrow by the Emperor\r\nMauritius and death in 602, had crossed the Danube, captured Sirmium,\r\nand reduced the whole region bordering on the Byzantine empire. Later\r\nthe still powerful Avars with their Slav followers, \"the Avar viper and\r\nthe Slav locust,\" overran the Balkan lands, and in 625 nearly captured\r\nConstantinople. They were at last crushed by Pepin, king of Italy, who\r\nreoccupied Sirmium in 799, and brought back such treasure that the value\r\nof gold was for a time enormously reduced.\r\n\r\nThen came the opportunity of the _Hunagars_ (Hungarians), who, after\r\nadvancing from the Urals to the Volga (550 A.D.), had reached the Danube\r\nabout 886. Here they were invited to the aid of the Germanic king\r\nArnulf, threatened by a formidable coalition of the western Slavs under\r\nthe redoubtable Zventibolg, a nominal Christian who would enter the\r\nchurch on horseback followed by his wild retainers, and threaten the\r\npriest at the altar with the lash. In the upland Transylvanian valleys\r\nthe Hunagars had been joined by eight of the derelict Khazar tribes,\r\namongst whom were the _Megers_ or _Mogers_, whose name under the form of\r\n_Magyar_ was eventually extended to the united Hunagar-Khazar nation.\r\nUnder their renowned king Arpad, son of Almuth, they first overthrew\r\nZventibolg, and then with the help of the surviving Avars reduced the\r\nsurrounding Slav populations. Thus towards the close of the ninth\r\ncentury was founded in Pannonia the present kingdom of Hungary, in\r\nwhich were absorbed all the kindred Mongol and Finno-Turki elements\r\nthat still survived from the two previous Mongolo-Turki empires,\r\nestablished in the same region by the Huns under Attila (430-453), and\r\nby the Avars under Khagan Bayan (562-602).\r\n\r\nAfter reducing the whole of Pannonia and ravaging Carinthia and Friuli,\r\nthe Hunagars raided Bavaria and Italy (899-900), imposed a tribute on\r\nthe feeble successor of Arnulf (910), and pushed their plundering\r\nexpeditions as far west as Alsace, Lorraine, and Burgundy, everywhere\r\ncommitting atrocities that recalled the memory of Attila's savage\r\nhordes. Trained riders, archers and javelin-throwers from infancy, they\r\nadvanced to the attack in numerous companies following hard upon each\r\nother, avoiding close quarters, but wearing out their antagonists by the\r\npersistence of their onslaughts. They were the scourge and terror of\r\nEurope, and were publicly proclaimed by the Emperor Otto I. (955) the\r\nenemies of God and humanity.\r\n\r\nThis period of lawlessness and savagery was closed by the conversion of\r\nSaint Stephen I. (997-1038), after which the Magyars became gradually\r\nassimilated in type and general culture, but not in speech, to the\r\nwestern nations[733]. Their harmonious and highly cultivated language\r\nstill remains a typical member of the Ural-Altaic family, reflecting in\r\nits somewhat composite vocabulary the various Finno-Ugric and Turki\r\nelements (Ugrians and Permians from the Urals, Volga Finns, Turki Avars\r\nand Khazars), of which the substratum of the Magyar nation is\r\nconstituted[734].\r\n\r\n\"The modern Magyars,\" says Peisker, \"are one of the most varied\r\nrace-mixtures on the face of the earth, and one of the two chief Magyar\r\ntypes of today--traced to the Arpad era [end of ninth century] by\r\ntomb-findings--is dolichocephalic with a narrow visage. There we have\r\nbefore us Altaian origin, Ugrian speech and Indo-European type\r\ncombined[735].\"\r\n\r\nPolitically the Magyars continue to occupy a position of vital\r\nimportance in Eastern Europe, wedged in between the northern and\r\nsouthern Slav peoples, and thus presenting an insurmountable obstacle to\r\nthe aspirations of the Panslavist dreamers. The fiery and vigorous\r\nMagyar nationality, a compact body of about 8,000,000 (1898), holds the\r\nboundless plains watered by the Middle Danube and the Theiss, and thus\r\npermanently separates the Chechs, Moravians, and Slovaks of Bohemia and\r\nthe northern Carpathians from their kinsmen, the Yugo-Slavs (\"Southern\r\nSlavs\") of Servia and the other now Slavonised Balkan lands. These\r\nYugo-Slavs are in their turn severed by the Rumanians of Neo-Latin\r\nspeech from their northern and eastern brethren, the Ruthenians, Poles,\r\nGreat and Little Russians. Had the Magyars and Rumanians adopted any of\r\nthe neighbouring Slav idioms, it is safe to say that, like the Ugrian\r\nBulgarians, they must have long ago been absorbed in the surrounding\r\nPanslav world, with consequences to the central European nations which\r\nit would not be difficult to forecast. Here we have a striking\r\nillustration of the influence of language in developing and preserving\r\nthe national sentiment, analogous in many respects to that now witnessed\r\non a larger scale amongst the English-speaking populations on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic and in the Austral lands. From this point of view the\r\nethnologist may unreservedly accept Ehrenreich's trenchant remark that\r\n\"the nation stands and falls with its speech[736].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[671] _Natural History of Man_, 1865 ed. pp. 185-6.\r\n\r\n[672] _Science of Language_, 1879, II. p. 190.\r\n\r\n[673] _The Heart of a Continent,_ 1896, p. 118.\r\n\r\n[674] O.

In medieval times the whole region\r\nbetween the White Sea and the Urals was often called Permia; but since\r\nthe withdrawal southwards of the Zirynians and other Permian Finns this\r\nArctic region has been thinly occupied by Samoyed tribes spreading\r\nslowly westward from Siberia to the Pechora and Lower Dvina.\r\n\r\n[715] See A. Hackman, _Die Bronzezeit Finnlands_, Helsingfors, 1897;\r\nalso M. Aspelin, O. Montelius, V. Thomsen and others, who have all, on\r\nvarious grounds, arrived at the same conclusion. Even D. E. D.\r\nEuropaeus, who has advanced so many heterodox views on the Finnish\r\ncradleland, and on the relations of the Finnic to the Mongolo-Turki\r\nlanguages, agrees that \"vers l'epoque de la naissance de J.

The absence from America at any period of the\r\nworld's history not only of anthropoid apes but also of the\r\n_Cercopithecidae_, in other words of the Catarrhini, entirely precludes\r\nthe possibility of the independent origin of man in the western\r\nhemisphere. Therefore the population of the Americas must have come from\r\nthe Old World. In prehistoric times there were only two possible routes\r\nfor such immigration to have taken place. For the mid-Atlantic land\r\nconnection was severed long ages before the appearance of man, and the\r\nconnection of South America with Antarctica had also long\r\ndisappeared[737]. We are therefore compelled to look to a farther\r\nextension of land between North America and northern Europe on the one\r\nhand, and between north-west America and north-east Asia on the other.\r\nWe know that in late Tertiary times there was a land-bridge connecting\r\nnorth-west Europe with Greenland, and Scharff[738] believes that the\r\nBarren-ground reindeer took this route to Norway and western Europe\r\nduring early glacial times, but that \"towards the latter part of the\r\nGlacial period the land-connection ... broke down.\" Other authorities\r\nare of opinion that the continuous land between the two continents in\r\nhigher latitudes remained until post-glacial times. Brinton[739]\r\nconsidered that it was impossible for man to have reached America from\r\nAsia, because Siberia was covered with glaciers and not peopled until\r\nlate Neolithic times, whereas man was living in both North and South\r\nAmerica at the close of the Glacial Age. He acknowledged frequent\r\ncommunication in later times between Asia and America, but maintained\r\nthat the movement was rather from America to Asia than otherwise. He was\r\ntherefore a strong advocate of the European origin of the American race.\r\nThere is no doubt that North America was connected with Asia in Tertiary\r\ntimes, though some geologists assert that \"the far North-west did not\r\nrise from the waves of the Pacific Ocean (which once flowed with a\r\nboundless expanse to the North Pole) until after the glacial period.\" In\r\nthat case \"the first inhabitants of America certainly did not get there\r\nin this way, for by that time the bones of many generations were already\r\nbleaching on the soil of the New World[740].\" The \"Miocene Bridge,\" as\r\nthe land connecting Asia and America in late geological times has been\r\ncalled, was probably very wide, one side would stretch from Kamchatka to\r\nBritish Columbia, and the other across Behring Strait. If, as seems\r\nprobable, this connection persisted till, or was reconstituted during,\r\nthe human period, tribes migrating to America by the more northerly\r\nroute would enter the land east of the great barrier of the Rocky\r\nMountains. The route from the Old World to the New by the Pacific margin\r\nprobably remained nearly always open. Thus, while not denying the\r\npossibility of a very early migration from North Europe to North America\r\nthrough Greenland, it appears more probable that America received its\r\npopulation from North Asia.\r\n\r\nWe have next to determine what were the characteristics of the earliest\r\ninhabitants of America, and the approximate date of their arrival. There\r\nhave been many sensational accounts of the discoveries of fossil man in\r\nAmerica, which have not been able to stand the criticism of scientific\r\ninvestigation. It must always be remembered that the evidence is\r\nprimarily one of stratigraphy. Assuming, of course, that the human\r\nskeletal remains found in a given deposit are contemporaneous with the\r\nformation of that deposit and not subsequently interred in it, it is for\r\nthe geologist to determine the age. The amount of petrifaction and the\r\nstate of preservation of the bones are quite fallacious nor can much\r\nreliance be placed upon the anatomical character of the remains.\r\nPrimordial human remains may be expected to show ancestral characters to\r\na marked degree, but as we have insufficient data to enable us to\r\ndetermine the rate of evolution, anatomical considerations must fit into\r\nthe timescale granted by the geologist.\r\n\r\nApart from pure stratigraphy associated animal remains may serve to\r\nsupport or refute the claims to antiquity, while the presence of\r\nartifacts, objects made or used by man, may afford evidence for\r\ndetermining the relative date if the cultural stratigraphy of the area\r\nhas been sufficiently established.\r\n\r\nFortunately the fossil human remains of America have been carefully\r\nstudied by a competent authority who says, \"Irrespective of other\r\nconsiderations, in every instance where enough of the bones is preserved\r\nfor comparison the somatological evidence bears witness against the\r\ngeological antiquity of the remains and for their close affinity to, or\r\nidentity with those of the modern Indian. Under these circumstances but\r\none conclusion is justified, which is that thus far on this continent,\r\nno human bones of undisputed geological antiquity are known[741].\"\r\nHrdli[vc]ka subsequently studied the remains of South America and says,\r\n\"A conscientious, unbiased study of all the available facts has shown\r\nthat the whole structure erected in support of the theory of\r\ngeologically ancient man on that continent rests on very imperfectly and\r\nincorrectly interpreted data and in many instances on false premises,\r\nand as a consequence of these weaknesses must completely collapse when\r\nsubjected to searching criticism.--As to the antiquity of the various\r\narchaeological remains from Argentina attributed to early man, all\r\nthose to which particular importance has been attached have been found\r\nwithout tenable claim to great age, while others, mostly single objects,\r\nwithout exception fall into the category of the doubtful[742].\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of W. H. Holmes, Bailey Willis, F. E. Wright and C. N.\r\nFenner, who collaborated with Hrdli[vc]ka, with regard to the evidence\r\nthus far furnished, are that, \"it fails to establish the claim that in\r\nSouth America there have been brought forth thus far tangible traces of\r\neither geologically ancient man himself or of any precursors of the\r\nhuman race[743].\" Hrdli[vc]ka is careful to add, however, \"This should\r\nnot be taken as a categorical denial of the existence of early man in\r\nSouth America, however improbable such a presence may now appear.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to J. W. Gidley[744] the evidence of vertebrate paleontology\r\nindicates (1) That man did not exist in North America at the beginning\r\nof the Pleistocene although there was a land connection between Asia and\r\nNorth America at that time permitting a free passage for large mammals.\r\n(2) That a similar land connection was again in existence at the close\r\nof the last glacial epoch, and probably continued up to comparatively\r\nrecent times, as indicated by the close resemblance of related living\r\nmammalian species on either side of the present Behring Strait. (3) That\r\nthe first authentic records of prehistoric man in America have been\r\nfound in deposits that are not older than the last glacial epoch, and\r\nprobably of even later date, the inference being that man first found\r\nhis way into North America at some time near the close of the existence\r\nof this last land bridge. (4) That this land bridge was broad and\r\nvegetative, and the climate presumably mild, at least along its southern\r\ncoast border, making it habitable for man.\r\n\r\nRivet[745] points out that from Brazil to Terra del Fuegia on the\r\nAtlantic slope, in Bolivia and Peru, on the high plateaux of the Andes,\r\non the Pacific coast and perhaps in the south of California, traces of a\r\ndistinct race are met with, sometimes in single individuals, sometimes\r\nin whole groups. This race of Lagoa Santa is an important primordial\r\nelement in the population of South America, and has been termed by\r\nDeniker the Palaeo-American sub-race[746].\r\n\r\nThe men were of low stature but considerable strength, the skull was\r\nlong, narrow and high, of moderate size, prognathous, with strong brow\r\nridges, but not a retreating forehead. There is no reliable evidence as\r\nto the age of these remains. Hrdli[vc]ka, after reviewing all the\r\nevidence says, \"Besides agreeing closely with the dolichocephalic\r\nAmerican type, which had an extensive representation throughout Brazil,\r\nincluding the Province of Minas Geraes, and in many other parts of South\r\nAmerica, it is the same type which is met with farther north among the\r\nAztec, Tarasco, Otomi, Tarahumare, Pima, Californians, ancient Utah\r\ncliff dwellers, ancient north-eastern Pueblos, Shoshoni, many of the\r\nPlains Tribes, Iroquois, Eastern Siouan, and Algonquian. But it is apart\r\nfrom the Eskimo, who form a distinct subtype of the yellow-brown strain\r\nof humanity[747].\"\r\n\r\nRivet[748] adds that an examination of the present distribution of the\r\ndescendants of the Lagoa-Santa type shows that they are all border\r\npeoples, in East Brazil, and the south of Patagonia and Terra del\r\nFuegia, where the climate is rigorous, in desert islands of west and\r\nsouthern Chili, on the coast of Ecuador, and perhaps in California. This\r\nsuggests that they have been driven out in a great eccentric movement\r\nfrom their old habitat, into new environment producing fresh crossings.\r\n\r\nThere is an absence of this high narrow-headed type throughout the\r\nnorthern part of South America, and a prevalence of medium or\r\nsub-brachycephalic heads which are always low in the crown. These are\r\nnow represented by the Caribs and Arawaks, but there was more than one\r\nmigration of brachycephalic peoples from the north.\r\n\r\nTo return to North America. As we have just seen Hrdli[vc]ka recognises\r\na dolichocephalic element in North America, and various ethnic groups\r\nrange to pronounced brachycephaly. Nevertheless he believes in the\r\noriginal unity of the Indian race in America, basing his conclusions on\r\nthe colour of the skin, which ranges from yellowish white to dark brown,\r\nthe straight black hair, scanty beard, hairless body, brown and often\r\nmore or less slanting eye, mesorrhine nose, medium prognathism,\r\nskeletal proportions and other essential features. In all these\r\ncharacters the American Indians resemble the yellowish brown peoples of\r\neastern Asia and a large part of Polynesia[749]. He also believes that\r\nthere were many successive migrations from Asia.\r\n\r\nThe differences of opinion between Hrdli[vc]ka and other students is\r\nprobably more a question of nomenclature than of fact. The eastern\r\nAsiatics and Polynesians are mixed peoples, and if there were numerous\r\nmigrations from Asia, spread over a very long period of time, people of\r\ndifferent stocks would have found their way into America. \"It is indeed\r\nprobable,\" Hrdli[vc]ka adds, \"that the western coast of America, within\r\nthe last two thousand years, was on more than one occasion reached by\r\nsmall parties of Polynesians, and that the eastern coast was similarly\r\nreached by small groups of whites; but these accretions have not\r\nmodified greatly, if at all, the mass of the native population[750].\"\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the plains east of the Rocky Mountains and the\r\neastern wooded area are characterised by a head which varies about the\r\nlower limit of brachycephaly, and by tall stature. This stock probably\r\narrived by the North Pacific Bridge before the end of the last Glacial\r\nperiod, and extended over the continent east of the great divide.\r\nFinally bands from the north, east and south migrated into the prairie\r\narea. The markedly brachycephalic immigrants from Asia appear to have\r\nproceeded mainly down the Pacific slope and to have populated Central\r\nand South America, with an overflow into the south of North America. It\r\nis probable that there were several migrations of allied but not similar\r\nbroad-headed peoples from Asia in early days, and we know that recently\r\nthere have been racial and cultural drifts between the neighbouring\r\nportions of America and Asia[751]. Indeed Bogoras[752] suggests that\r\nethnographically the line separating Asia and America should lie from\r\nthe lower Kolyma River to Gishiga Bay.\r\n\r\nOwing to these various immigrations and subsequent minglings the cranial\r\nforms show much variation, and are not sufficiently significant to serve\r\nas a basis of classification. In parts of North America the round-headed\r\nmound-builders and others were encroached upon by populations of\r\nincreasingly dolichocephalic type--Plains Indians and Cherokees,\r\nChichimecs, Tepanecs, Acolhuas. Even still dolichocephaly is\r\ncharacteristic of Iroquois, Coahuilas, Sonorans, while the intermediate\r\nindices met with on the prairies and plateaux undoubtedly indicate the\r\nmixture between the long-headed invaders and the round-heads whom they\r\nswept aside as they advanced southwards. Thus the Minnetaris are highly\r\ndolicho; the Poncas and Osages sub-brachy; the Algonquians variable,\r\nwhile the Siouans oscillate widely round a mesaticephalous mean.\r\n\r\nThe Athapascans alone are homogeneous, and their sub-brachycephaly\r\nrecurs amongst the Apaches and their other southern kindred, who have\r\ngiven it an exaggerated form by the widespread practice of artificial\r\ndeformation, which dates from remote times. The most typical cases both\r\nof brachy and dolicho deformation are from the Cerro de las Palmas\r\ngraves in south-west Mexico. Deformation prevails also in Peru and\r\nBolivia, as well as in Ceara and the Rio Negro on the Atlantic side. The\r\nflat-head form, so common from the Columbia estuary to Peru, occurs\r\namongst the broad-faced Huaxtecs, their near relations the Maya-Quiches,\r\nand the Nahuatlans. It is also found amongst the extinct Cebunys of\r\nCuba, Hayti and Jamaica, and the so-called \"Toltecs,\" that is, the\r\npeople of Tollan (Tula), who first founded a civilised state on the\r\nMexican table-land (sixth and seventh centuries A.D.), and whose name\r\nafterwards became associated with every ancient monument throughout\r\nCentral America. On this \"Toltec question\" the most contradictory\r\ntheories are current; some hold that the Toltecs were a great and\r\npowerful nation, who after the overthrow of their empire migrated\r\nsouthwards, spreading their culture throughout Central America; others\r\nregard them as \"fabulous,\" or at all events \"nothing more than a sept of\r\nthe Nahuas themselves, the ancestors of those Mexicans who built\r\nTenochtitlan,\" _i.e._ the present city of Mexico. A third view, that of\r\nValentini, that the Toltecs were not Nahuas but Mayas, is now supported\r\nboth by E. P. Dieseldorff[753] and by Foerstemann[754]. T. A. Joyce[755]\r\nsuggests that the vanguard of the Nahuas on reaching the Mexican valley\r\nadopted and improved the culture of an agricultural people of Tarascan\r\naffinities whose culture was in part due to Mayan inspiration, whom they\r\nfound settled there. Later migrations of Nahua were greatly impressed\r\nwith the \"Toltec\" culture which had thus arisen through the impact of a\r\nvirile hunting people on more passive agriculturalists.\r\n\r\nOn the North-west Pacific Coast similar ethnical interminglings recur,\r\nand Franz Boas[756] here distinguishes as many as four types, the\r\nNorthern (Tsimshian and others), the Kwakiutl, the Lillooet of the\r\nHarrison Lake region and the inland Salishan (Flat-heads, Shuswaps,\r\netc.). All are brachycephalic, but while the Tsimshians are of medium\r\nheight 1.675 m. (5 ft. 6 in.) with low, concave nose, very large head,\r\nand enormously broad face, exceeding the average for North America by 6\r\nmm., the Kwakiutls are shorter 1.645 m. (5 ft. 4-3/4 in.) with very high\r\nand relatively narrow hooked nose, and quite exceptionally high face;\r\nthe Harrison Lake very short 1.600 m. (5 ft 3 in.) with exceedingly\r\nshort and broad head (C. I. nearly 89), \"surpassing in this respect all\r\nother forms known to exist in North America\"; lastly, the inland Salish\r\nof medium height 1.679 m. (5 ft. 6 in.) with high and wide nose of the\r\ncharacteristic Indian form and a short head.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find anywhere a greater contrast than that\r\nwhich is presented by some of these British Columbian natives, those,\r\nfor instance, of Harrison Lake with almost circular heads (88.8), and\r\nsome of the Labrador Eskimo with a degree of dolichocephaly not exceeded\r\neven by the Fijian Kai-Colos (65)[757]. But this violent contrast is\r\nsomewhat toned by the intermediate forms, such as those of the Tlingits,\r\nthe Aleutian islanders, and the western (Alaskan) Eskimo, by which the\r\ntransition is effected between the Arctic and the more southern\r\npopulations. It is not possible at present to indicate even in outline\r\nthe chronology of any of the ethnic movements outlined above. Warren K.\r\nMoorehead[758] agrees with the great majority of American archaeologists\r\nin holding the existence of palaeolithic man in North America as not\r\nproven[759], the so-called palaeoliths being either rejects or rude\r\ntools for rough purposes. When man migrated to America from North and\r\nEast Asia whenever that period may have been, he appears to have been in\r\nthat stage of culture--or rather of stone technique--which we term\r\nNeolithic, and the drifting movement ceased before he had learnt the use\r\nof metals.\r\n\r\nA further proof of the antiquity of the migrations is afforded by\r\nlinguistics. A. F. Chamberlain asserts[760] that \"it may be said with\r\ncertainty, so far as all data hitherto presented are concerned, that no\r\nsatisfactory proof whatever has been put forward to induce us to believe\r\nthat any single American Indian tongue or group of tongues has been\r\nderived from any Old World form of speech now existing or known to have\r\nexisted in the past. In whatever way the multiplicity of American Indian\r\nlanguages and dialects may have arisen, one can be reasonably sure that\r\nthe differentiation and divergence have developed here in America and\r\nare in no sense due to the occasional intrusion of Old World tongues\r\nindividually or _en masse_.... Certain real relationships between the\r\nAmerican Indians and the peoples of north-eastern Asia, known as\r\n'Paleo-Asiatics,' have, however, been revealed as a result of the\r\nextensive investigations of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition.... The\r\ngeneral conclusion to be drawn from the evidence is that the so-called\r\n'Paleo-Asiatic' peoples of north-eastern Asia, _i.e._ the Chukchee,\r\nKoryak, Kamchadale, Gilyak, Yukaghir, etc. really belong physically and\r\nculturally with the aborigines of north-western America.... Like the\r\nmodern Asiatic Eskimo they represent a reflex from America and Asia, and\r\nnot _vice versa_.... It is the opinion of good authorities also that the\r\n'Paleo-Asiatic' peoples belong linguistically with the American Indians\r\nrather than with the other tribes and stocks of northern or southern\r\nAsia. Here we have then the only real relationship of a linguistic\r\ncharacter that has ever been convincingly argued between tongues of the\r\nNew World and tongues of the Old.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not merely that the American languages differ from other forms of\r\nspeech in their general phonetic, structural and lexical features; they\r\ndiffer from them in their very morphology, as much, for instance, as in\r\nthe zoological world class differs from class, order from order. They\r\nhave all of them developed on the same polysynthetic lines, from which\r\nif a few here and there now appear to depart, it is only because in the\r\ncourse of their further evolution they have, so to say, broken away from\r\nthat prototype[761]. Take the rudest or the most highly cultivated\r\nanywhere from Alaska to Fuegia--Eskimauan, Iroquoian, Algonquian, Aztec,\r\nTarascan, Ipurina, Peruvian, Yahgan--and you will find each and all\r\ngiving abundant evidence of this universal polysynthetic character, not\r\none true instance of which can be found anywhere in the eastern\r\nhemisphere. There is incorporation with the verb, as in Basque, many of\r\nthe Caucasus tongues, and the Ural-Altaic group; but it is everywhere\r\nlimited to pronominal and purely relational elements.\r\n\r\nBut in the American order of speech there is no such limitation, and not\r\nmerely the pronouns, which are restricted in number, but the nouns with\r\ntheir attributes, which are practically numberless, all enter\r\nnecessarily into the verbal paradigm. Thus in Tarascan (Mexico):\r\n_hopocuni_ = to wash the hands; _hopodini_ = to wash the ears, from\r\n_hoponi_ = to wash, which cannot be used alone[762]. So in Ipurina\r\n(Amazonia): _nicucacatcaurumatinii_ = I draw the cord tight round your\r\nwaist, from _ni_, I; _cucaca_, to draw tight; _tca_, cord; _turuma_,\r\nwaist; _tini_, characteristic verbal affix; _i_, thy, referring to\r\nwaist[763].\r\n\r\nWe see from such examples that polysynthesis is not a primitive\r\ncondition of speech, as is often asserted, but on the contrary a\r\nhighly developed system, in which the original agglutinative process\r\nhas gone so far as to attract all the elements of the sentence to\r\nthe verb, round which they cluster like swarming bees round their\r\nqueen. In Eskimauan the tendency is shown in the construction of\r\nnouns and verbs, by which other classes of words are made almost\r\nunnecessary, and one word, sometimes of interminable length, is\r\nable to express a whole sentence with its subordinate clauses. H. Rink,\r\none of the first Eskimo scholars of modern times, gives the instance:\r\n\"Suerukame-autdlasassoq-tusaramiuk-tuningingmago-iluarin-gilat = they\r\ndid not approve that he (_a_) had omitted to give him (_b_) something,\r\nas he (_a_) heard that he (_b_) was going to depart on account of being\r\ndestitute of everything[764].\" Such monstrosities \"are so complicated\r\nthat in daily speech they could hardly ever occur; but still they are\r\ncorrect and can be understood by intelligent people[765].\"\r\n\r\nHe gives another and much longer example, which the reader may be\r\nspared, adding that there are altogether about 200 particles, as many as\r\nten of which may be piled up on any given stem. The process also often\r\ninvolves great phonetic changes, by which the original form of the\r\nelements becomes disguised, as, for instance, in the English _hap'oth_ =\r\nhalf-penny-worth. The attempt to determine the number of words that\r\nmight be formed in this way on a single stem, such as _igdlo_, a house,\r\nhad to be given up after getting as far as the compound\r\n_igdlorssualiortugssarsiumavoq_ = he wants to find one who will build a\r\nlarge house.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such a linguistic evolution implies both the postulated\r\nisolation from other influences, which must have disturbed and broken up\r\nthe cumbrous process, and also the postulated long period of time to\r\ndevelop and consolidate the system throughout the New World. But time is\r\nstill more imperiously demanded by the vast number of stock languages,\r\nmany already extinct, many still current all over the continent, all of\r\nwhich differ profoundly in their vocabulary, often also in their\r\nphonesis, and in fact have nothing in common except this extraordinary\r\npolysynthetic groove in which they are cast. There are probably about 75\r\nstock languages in North America, of which 58 occur north of Mexico.\r\n\r\nBut even that conveys but a faint idea of the astonishing diversity of\r\nspeech prevailing in this truly linguistic Babel. J. W. Powell[766]\r\npoints out that the practically distinct idioms are far more numerous\r\nthan might be inferred even from such a large number of mother tongues.\r\nThus, in the Algonquian[767] linguistic family he tells us there are\r\nabout 40, no one of which could be understood by a people speaking\r\nanother; in Athapascan from 30 to 40; in Siouan over 20; and in\r\nShoshonian a still greater number[768]. The greatest linguistic\r\ndiversity in a relatively small area is found in the state of\r\nCalifornia, where, according to Powell's classification, 22 distinct\r\nstocks of languages are spoken. R. B. Dixon and A. L. Kroeber[769] show\r\nhowever that these fall into three morphological groups which are also\r\ncharacterised by certain cultural features. It is the same, or perhaps\r\neven worse, in Central and in South America, where the linguistic\r\nconfusion is so great that no complete classification of the native\r\ntongues seems possible. Clements R. Markham in the third edition of his\r\nexhaustive list of the Amazonian tribes[770] has no less than 1087\r\nentries. He concludes that these may be referred to 485 distinct tribes\r\nin all the periods, since the days of Acuna (1639). Deducting some 111\r\nas extinct or nearly so, the total amounts to \"323 at the outside\" (p.\r\n135). But for such linguistic differences, large numbers of these groups\r\nwould be quite indistinguishable from each other, so great is the\r\nprevailing similarity in physical appearance and usages in many\r\ndistricts. Thus Ehrenreich tells us that, \"despite their\r\nethnico-linguistic differences, the tribes about the head-waters of the\r\nXingu present complete uniformity in their daily habits, in the\r\nconditions of their existence, and their general culture[771],\" though\r\nit is curious to note that the art of making pottery is restricted here\r\nto the Arawak tribes[772]. Yet amongst them are represented three of\r\nthe radically distinct linguistic groups of Brazil, some (Bakairi and\r\nNahuqua) belonging to the Carib, some (Auetoe and Kamayura) to the\r\nTupi-Guarani, and some (Mehinaku and Vaura) to the Arawak family.\r\nObviously these could not be so discriminated but for their linguistic\r\ndifferences. On the other hand the opposite phenomenon is occasionally\r\npresented of tribes differing considerably in their social relations,\r\nwhich are nevertheless of the same origin, or, what is regarded by\r\nEhrenreich as the same thing, belong to the same linguistic group. Such\r\nare the Ipurina, the Paumari and the Yamamadi of the Purus valley, all\r\ngrouped as Arawaks because they speak dialects of the Arawakan stock\r\nlanguage. At the same time it should be noted that the social\r\ndifferences observed by some modern travellers are often due to the\r\never-increasing contact with the whites, who are now encroaching on the\r\nGran Chaco plains, and ascending every Amazonian tributary in quest of\r\nrubber and the other natural produce abounding in these regions. The\r\nconsequent displacement of tribes is discussed by G. E. Church[773].\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to his valuable list Clements Markham observes that\r\nthe evidence of language favours the theory that the Amazonian tribes,\r\n\"now like the sands on the sea-shore for number, originally sprang from\r\ntwo or at most three parent stocks. Dialects of the _Tupi_ language\r\nextend from the roots of the Andes to the Atlantic, and southward into\r\nParaguay ... and it is established that the differences in the roots,\r\nbetween the numerous Amazonian languages, are not so great as was\r\ngenerally supposed[774].\" This no doubt is true, and will account for\r\nmuch. But when we see it here recorded that of the Carabuyanas (Japura\r\nriver) there are or were 16 branches, that the Chiquito group (Bolivia)\r\ncomprises 40 tribes speaking \"seven different languages\"; that of the\r\nJuris (Upper Amazons) there are ten divisions; of the Moxos (Beni and\r\nMamore rivers) 26 branches, \"speaking nine or, according to Southey,\r\nthirteen languages\"; of the Uaupes (Rio Negro) 30 divisions, and so on,\r\nwe feel how much there is still left to be accounted for. Attempts have\r\nbeen made to weaken the force of the linguistic argument by the\r\nassumption, at one time much in favour, that the American tongues are of\r\na somewhat evanescent nature, in an unstable condition, often changing\r\ntheir form and structure within a few generations. But, says Powell,\r\n\"this widely spread opinion does not find warrant in the facts\r\ndiscovered in the course of this research. The author has everywhere\r\nbeen impressed with the fact that savage tongues are singularly\r\npersistent, and that a language which is dependent for its existence\r\nupon oral tradition is not easily modified[775].\" A test case is the\r\nDelaware (Leni Lenape), an Algonquian tongue which, judging from the\r\nspecimens collected by Th. Campanius about 1645, has undergone but\r\nslight modification during the last 250 years.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the important point to be noticed is the fact that\r\nsome of the stock languages have an immense range, while others are\r\ncrowded together in indescribable confusion in rugged upland valleys, or\r\nabout river estuaries, or in the recesses of trackless woodlands, and\r\nthis strangely irregular distribution prevails in all the main divisions\r\nof the continent. Thus of Powell's 58 linguistic families in North\r\nAmerica as many as 40 are restricted to the relatively narrow strip of\r\ncoastland between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific, ten are dotted\r\nround the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to the Rio Grande, and two\r\ndisposed round the Gulf of California, while nearly all the rest of the\r\nland--some six million square miles--is occupied by the six widely\r\ndiffused Eskimauan, Athapascan, Algonquian, Iroquoian, Siouan, and\r\nShoshonian families. The same phenomenon is presented by Central and\r\nSouth America, where less than a dozen stock languages--Opatan,\r\nNahuatlan, Huastecan, Chorotegan, Quichuan, Arawakan, Gesan (Tapuyan),\r\nTupi-Guaranian, Cariban--are spread over millions of square miles, while\r\nmany scores of others are restricted to extremely narrow areas. Here the\r\ncrowding is largely determined, as in Caucasia, by the altitude (Andes\r\nin Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia; Sierras in Mexico).\r\n\r\nIt is strongly held by many American ethnologists that the various\r\ncultures of America are autochthonous, nothing being borrowed from the\r\nOld World. J. W. Powell[776], who rendered such inestimable services to\r\nAmerican anthropology, affirmed that \"the aboriginal peoples of America\r\ncannot be allied preferentially to any one branch of the human race in\r\nthe Old World\"; that \"there is no evidence that any of the arts of the\r\nAmerican Indians were borrowed from the Orient\"; that \"the industrial\r\narts of America were born in America, America was inhabited by tribes\r\nat the time of the beginning of industrial arts. They left the Old World\r\nbefore they had learned to make knives, spear and arrowheads, or at\r\nleast when they knew the art only in its crudest state. Thus primitive\r\nman has been here ever since the invention of the stone knife and the\r\nstone hammer.\" He further contended that \"the American Indian did not\r\nderive his forms of government, his industrial or decorative arts, his\r\nlanguages, or his mythological opinions from the Old World, but\r\ndeveloped them in the New\"; and that \"in the demotic characteristics of\r\nthe American Indians, all that is common to tribes of the Orient is\r\nuniversal, all that distinguishes one group of tribes from another in\r\nAmerica distinguishes them from all other tribes of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThis view has been emphasised afresh by Fewkes[777], though of recent\r\nyears it has met with vigorous opposition. At the conclusion of his\r\narticle \"Die melanesische Bogenkultur und ihre Verwandten[778]\" Graebner\r\nattempts to trace the cultural connection of South America with\r\nSouth-east Asia rather than with the South Seas, the main links being\r\nrepresented by head-hunting, certain types of skin-drum and of basket,\r\nand in particular three types of crutch-handled paddle. According to him\r\nthe spread of culture has taken place by the land route and Behring\r\nStrait, not across the Pacific by way of the South Seas, a view to which\r\nhe adheres in his later work. An ingenious and detailed attempt has also\r\nbeen made by Pater Schmidt[779] to trace the various cultures determined\r\nfor Oceania and Africa in South America. Apart from the great linguistic\r\ngroups usually adopted as the basis of classification, Schmidt would\r\ndivide the South American Indians according to their stage of economic\r\ndevelopment into collectors, cultivators, and civilised peoples of the\r\nAndean highlands. Though this series may have the appearance of\r\nevolution, in point of fact \"each group is composed of peoples differing\r\nabsolutely in language and race, who brought with them to South America\r\nin historically distinct migrations at all events the fundamentals of\r\ntheir respective cultures.... As we pass in review the cultural elements\r\nof the separate groups, their weapons, implements, dwellings, their\r\nsociology, mythology, and religion we discover the innate similarity of\r\nthese groups to the culture-zones of the Old World in all essential\r\nfeatures[780].\" The author proceeds to work out his theory in great\r\ndetail; the earlier cultures he too considers have travelled by the\r\nenormously lengthy land route by way of North America, only the \"free\r\npatrilineal culture\" (Polynesia and Indonesia) having reached the west\r\ncoast directly by sea[781].\r\n\r\nW. H. Holmes[782] draws attention to analogies between American and\r\nforeign archaeological remains, for example the stone gouge of New\r\nEngland and Europe. He hints at influences coming from the Mediterranean\r\nand even from Africa. \"Even more remarkable and diversified are the\r\ncorrespondences between the architectural remains of Yucatan and those\r\nof Cambodia and Java in the far East. On the Pacific side of the\r\nAmerican continent strange coincidences occur in like degree, seeming to\r\nindicate that the broad Pacific has not proved a complete bar to\r\nintercourse of peoples of the opposing continents ... it seems highly\r\nprobable considering the nature of the archaeological evidence, that the\r\nWestern World has not been always and wholly beyond the reach of members\r\nof the white, Polynesian, and perhaps even the black races.\"\r\n\r\nWalter Hough[783] gives various cultural parallels between America and\r\nthe other side of the Pacific but does not commit himself. S. Hagar[784]\r\nbrings forward some interesting correspondences between the astronomy of\r\nthe New and of the Old Worlds, but adopts a cautious attitude.\r\n\r\nMore recently the problem has been attacked with great energy by G.\r\nElliot Smith[785]. His investigations into the processes of\r\nmummification and the tombs of ancient Egypt led him to comparative\r\nstudies, and he notes that certain customs seem to be found in\r\nassociation, forming what is known as a culture-complex. For example,\r\n\"in most regions the people who introduced the habit of megalithic\r\nbuilding and sun worship also brought with them the practice of\r\nmummification.\" Also associated with these are:--stories of dwarfs and\r\ngiants, belief in the indwelling of gods and great men in megalithic\r\nmonuments, the use of these structures in a particular manner for\r\nspecial council, the practice of hanging rags on trees in association\r\nwith such monuments, serpent worship, tattooing, distension of the lobe\r\nof the ear, the use of pearls, the conch-shell trumpet, etc. In a map\r\nshowing the distribution of this \"heliolithic\" culture-complex he\r\nindicates the main lines of migration to America, one across the\r\nAleutian chain and down the west coast to California, the other and more\r\nimportant one, across the Pacific to Peru, and thence to various parts\r\nof South America, through Central America to the southern half of the\r\nUnited States. Contrary to Schmidt, Elliot Smith postulates contact of\r\ncultures rather than actual migrations of people; he considers it\r\npossible that a small number of aliens arriving by sea in Peru, for\r\nexample, might introduce customs of a highly novel and subversive\r\ncharacter which would take root and spread far and wide. The Peruvian\r\ncustom of embalming the dead certainly presents analogies to that of\r\nancient Egypt, and Elliot Smith is convinced that \"the rude megalithic\r\narchitecture of America bears obvious evidence of the same inspiration\r\nwhich prompted that of the Old World.\" In a later paper Elliot\r\nSmith[786] adduces further evidence in support of his thesis \"that the\r\nessential elements of the ancient civilization of India, Further Asia,\r\nthe Malay Archipelago, Oceania, and America were brought in succession\r\nto each of these places by mariners, whose oriental migrations (on an\r\nextensive scale) began as trading intercourse between the Eastern\r\nMediterranean and India some time after 800 B.C. and continued for many\r\ncenturies.\" This dissemination was in the first instance due to the\r\nPhoenicians and there are \"unmistakable tokens that the same Phoenician\r\nmethods which led to the diffusion of this culture-complex in the Old\r\nWorld also were responsible for planting it in the New[787] some\r\ncenturies after the Phoenicians themselves had ceased to be\" (_l.c._ p.\r\n27). Further evidence along the same lines is offered by W. J.\r\nPerry[788] who has noted the geographical distribution of terraced\r\ncultivation and irrigation and finds that it corresponds to a remarkable\r\nextent with that of the \"heliolithic\" culture-complex, and by J.\r\nWilfrid Jackson[789] who has investigated the Aztec Moon-cult and its\r\nrelation to the Chank cult of India, the money cowry as a sacred object\r\namong North American Indians[790], shell trumpets and their distribution\r\nin the Old and New World[791] and the geographical distribution of the\r\nshell purple industry[792]. He points out that we have ample evidence of\r\nthe practice of this ancient industry in several places in Central\r\nAmerica, and refers to Zelia Nuttall's interesting paper on the\r\nsubject[793]. Elliot Smith also discusses \"Pre-Columbian Representations\r\nof the Elephant in America[794]\" and remarks \"coincidences of so\r\nremarkable a nature cannot be due to chance. They not only confirm the\r\nidentification of the elephant in designs in America, but also\r\nincidentally point to the conclusion that the Hindu god Indra was\r\nadopted in Central America with practically all the attributes assigned\r\nto him in his Asiatic home.\" Elliot Smith believes that practically\r\nevery element of the early civilisation of America was derived from the\r\nOld World. Small groups of immigrants from time to time brought certain\r\nof the beliefs, customs, and inventions of the Mediterranean area,\r\nEgypt, Ethiopia, Arabia, Babylonia, Indonesia, Eastern Asia and Oceania,\r\nand the confused jumble of practices became assimilated and\r\n\"Americanised\" in the new home across the Pacific as the result of the\r\ndomination of the great uncultured aboriginal populations by small bands\r\nof more cultured foreigners. These highly suggestive studies will force\r\nadherents of the theory of the indigenous origin of American culture to\r\nreconsider the grounds for their opinions and will lead them to turn\r\nonce more to the writings of Bancroft[795], Tylor[796], Nuttall[797],\r\nMacmillan Brown[798], Enoch[799] and others.\r\n\r\nThere is no satisfactory scheme of classification of the American\r\npeoples. Although there is a good deal of scattered information about\r\nthe physical anthropology of the natives it has not yet been\r\nsystematised and no classification can at present be based thereon. A\r\nlinguistic classification is therefore usually adopted, but a\r\ngeographical or cultural grouping, or a combination of the two, has much\r\npractical convenience. As Farrand[800] points out \"It must never be\r\nforgotten that the limits of physical, linguistic and cultural groups do\r\nnot correspond; and the overlapping of stocks determined by those\r\ncriteria is an unavoidable complication.\"\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the map of the distribution of linguistic stocks of\r\nNorth America prepared by J. W. Powell[801] which represents the\r\nprobable state of affairs about 1500 A.D. shows that a few linguistic\r\nstocks have a wide distribution while there is a large number of\r\nrestricted stocks crowded along the Pacific slope. The following are the\r\nbetter known tribes of the more important stocks together with their\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n_Eskimauan_ (Eskimo), along the Arctic coasts from 60 deg. N. lat. in the\r\nwest, to 50 deg. in the east. _Athapascan_, northern group, Dene or Tinneh\r\n(including many tribes), interior of Alaska, northern British Columbia\r\nand the Mackenzie basin, and the Sarsi of south-eastern Alberta and\r\nnorthern Montana; southern group, Navaho and Apache in Arizona, New\r\nMexico and northern Mexico; the Pacific group, a small band in southern\r\nBritish Columbia, others in Washington, Oregon and northern California.\r\n_Algonquian_, south and west of Canada, the United States east of the\r\nMississippi, the whole valley of the Ohio, and the states of the\r\nAtlantic coast. Blackfoot of Montana, Alberta, south and further east,\r\nCheyenne and Arapaho of Minnesota. The main group of dialects is divided\r\ninto the Massachusett, Ojibway (Ojibway, Ottawa, Illinois, Miami, etc.)\r\nand Cree types. The latter include the Cree, Montagnais, Sauk and Fox,\r\nMenomini, Shawnee, Abnaki, etc. _Iroquoian_, in the provinces of Ontario\r\nand Quebec; Hurons in the valley of the St Lawrence and lake Simcoe.\r\nNeutral confederacy in western New York and north and west of lake Erie.\r\nThe great confederacy of the Iroquois or \"Five Nations\" (Seneca, Cayuga,\r\nOneida, Onondaga and Mohawk, to which the Tuscarora were added in 1712)\r\nin central New York; the Conestoga and Susquehanna to the south. A\r\nsouthern group was located in eastern Virginia and north Carolina, and\r\nthe Cherokee, centred in the southern Appalachians from parts of\r\nVirginia and Kentucky to northern Alabama. _Muskhogean_ of Georgia,\r\nAlabama and Mississippi, including the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek,\r\nSeminole, etc. and the Natchez. There are several small groups about the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi. _Caddoan_. The earliest inhabitants of the\r\ncentral and southern plains beyond the Missouri belonged to this stock,\r\nthe largest group occupied parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and\r\nTexas, it consists of the Caddo, Wichita, etc. and the Kichai, the\r\nPawnee tribes in parts of Nebraska and Kansas and an offshoot, the\r\nArikara in North Dakota. _Siouan_, a small group in Virginia, Carolina,\r\nCatawba, etc. and a very large group, practically occupying the basins\r\nof the Missouri and Arkansas, with a prolongation through Wisconsin,\r\nwhere were the Winnebago. The main tribes are the Mandan, Crow, Dakota,\r\nAssiniboin, Omaha and Osage. _Shoshonian_ of the Great Plateau and\r\nsouthern California. The two outlying tribes were the Hopi of north\r\nArizona and the Comanche who ranged over the southern plains. Among the\r\nplateau tribes are the Ute, Shoshoni, Mono and Luiseno. _Yuman_, from\r\nArizona to Lower California.\r\n\r\nFrom the data available J. R. Swanton and R. B. Dixon draw the following\r\nconclusions[802]. \"It appears that the origin of the tribes of several\r\nof our stocks may be referred back to a swarming ground, usually of\r\nrather indefinite size but none the less roughly indicated. That for the\r\nMuskhogeans, including probably some of the smaller southern stocks,\r\nmust be placed in Louisiana, Arkansas and perhaps the western parts of\r\nMississippi and Tennessee, although a few tribes seem to have come from\r\nthe region of the Ohio. That for the Iroquoians would be along the Ohio\r\nand perhaps farther west, and that of the Siouans on the lower Ohio and\r\nthe country to the north including part at least of Wisconsin. The\r\ndispersion area for the Algonquians was farther north about the Great\r\nLakes and perhaps also the St Lawrence, and that for the Eskimo about\r\nHudson Bay or between it and the Mackenzie river. The Caddoan peoples\r\nseem to have been on the southern plains from earliest times. On the\r\nnorth Pacific coast we have indications that the flow of population has\r\nbeen from the interior to the coast. This seems certain in the case of\r\nthe Indians of the Chimmesayan stock and some Tlinglit subdivisions.\r\nSome Tlinglit clans, however, have moved from the neighbourhood of the\r\nNass northward. Looking farther south we find evidence that the coast\r\nSalish have moved from the inner side of the coast ranges, while a small\r\nbranch has subsequently passed northward to the west of it. The\r\nAthapascan stock in all probability has moved southward, sending one arm\r\ndown the Pacific coast, and a larger body presumably through the Plains\r\nwhich reached as far as northern Mexico. Most of the stocks of the Great\r\nPlateau and of Oregon and California show little evidence of movement,\r\nsuch indications as are present, however, pointing toward the south as a\r\nrule. The Pueblo Indians appear to have had a mixed origin, part of them\r\ncoming from the north, part from the south. In general there is to be\r\nnoted a striking contrast between the comparatively settled condition of\r\nthose tribes west of the Rocky mountains and the numerous movements,\r\nparticularly in later times, of those to the east.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Pacific coast Dixon[803] notes that it \"has\r\napparently been occupied from the earliest times by peoples differing\r\nbut little in their culture from the tribes found in occupancy in the\r\nsixteenth century. Cut off from the rest of the country by the great\r\nchain of the Cordilleras and the inhospitable and arid interior\r\nplateaus, the tribes of this narrow coastal strip developed in\r\ncomparative seclusion their various cultures, each adopted to the\r\nenvironment in which it was found....\r\n\r\n\"In several of the ingenious theories relating to the development and\r\norigin of American cultures in general, it has been contended that\r\nconsiderable migrations both of peoples and of cultural elements passed\r\nalong this coastal highway from north to south. If, however, the\r\narchaeological evidence is to be depended on, such great sweeping\r\nmovements, involving many elements of foreign culture, could hardly have\r\ntaken place, for no trace of their passage or modifying effect is\r\napparent.... We can feel fairly sure that the prehistoric peoples of\r\neach area were in the main the direct ancestors of the local tribes of\r\ntoday....\r\n\r\n\"In comparison with the relative simplicity of the archaeological record\r\non the Pacific coast, that of the eastern portion of the continent is\r\ncomplex, and might indeed be best described as a palimpsest. This\r\ncomplexity leads inevitably to the conclusion that here there have been\r\nnumerous and far-reaching ethnic movements, resulting in a\r\nstratification of cultures.\"\r\n\r\nW. H. Holmes has compiled a map marking the limits of eleven areas which\r\ncan be recognised by their archaeological remains[804]. He points out\r\nthat the culture units are, as a matter of course, not usually\r\nwell-defined. Cultures are bound to over-lap and blend along the borders\r\nand more especially along lines of ready communication. In some cases\r\nevidence has been reported of early cultures radically distinct from the\r\ntype adopted as characteristic of the areas, and ancestral forms grading\r\ninto the later and into the historic forms are thought to have been\r\nrecognised. Holmes frankly acknowledges the tentative character of the\r\nscheme, which forms part of a synthesis that he is preparing of the\r\nantiquities of the whole American continent.\r\n\r\nNorth America is customarily divided into nine areas of material\r\nculture, and though this is convenient, a more correct method, as C.\r\nWissler points out[805], is to locate the respective groups of typical\r\ntribes as culture centres, classifying the other tribes as intermediate\r\nor transitional. The geographical stability of the material culture\r\ncentres is confirmed by archaeological evidence which suggests that the\r\nstriking individuality they now possess resulted from a more or less\r\ngradual expansion along original lines. The material cultures of these\r\ncentres possess great vitality and are often able completely to dominate\r\nintrusive cultural unity. Thus tribes have passed from an intermediate\r\nstate to a typical, as when the Cheyenne were forced into the Plains\r\ncentre, and the Shoshonian Hopi adopted the typical Pueblo culture.\r\nWissler comes to the conclusion that \"the location of these centres is\r\nlargely a matter of ethnic accident, but once located and the\r\nadjustments made, the stability of the environment doubtless tends to\r\nhold each particular type of material culture to its initial locality,\r\neven in the face of many changes in blood and language.\" It is from his\r\nvaluable paper that the material culture traits of the following areas\r\nhave been obtained.\r\n\r\nI. Eskimo Area. The fact that the Eskimo live by the sea and chiefly\r\nupon sea food does not differentiate them from the tribes of the North\r\nPacific coast, but they are distinguished from the latter by the habit\r\nof camping in winter upon sea ice and living upon seal, and in the\r\nsummer upon land animals. The kayak and \"woman's boat,\" the lamp,\r\nharpoon, float, woman's knife, bowdrill, snow goggles, trussed-bow, and\r\ndog traction are almost universal. The type of winter shelter varies\r\nconsiderably, but the skin tent is general in summer and the snow house,\r\nas a more or less permanent winter house, prevails east of Point Barrow.\r\n\r\nThe mode of life of all the Eskimo, as F. Boas[806] has pointed out, is\r\nfairly uniform and depends on the distribution of food at the different\r\nseasons. The migrations of game compel the natives to move their\r\nhabitations from time to time, and as the inhospitable country does not\r\nproduce vegetation to an extent sufficient to support human life they\r\nare forced to depend entirely upon animal food. The abundance of seals\r\nin Arctic America enables man to withstand the inclemency of the climate\r\nand the sterility of the soil. The skins of seals furnish the materials\r\nfor summer garments and for the tent, their flesh is almost their only\r\nfood, and their blubber their indispensable fuel during the long dark\r\nwinter when they live in solid snow houses. When the ice breaks up in\r\nthe spring the Eskimo establish their settlements at the head of the\r\nfiords where salmon are easily caught. When the snow on the land has\r\nmelted in July the natives take hunting trips inland in order to obtain\r\nthe precious skins of the reindeer, or of the musk-ox, of whose heavy\r\npelts the winter garments are made. Walrus and the ground seal also\r\narrive and birds are found in abundance and eaten raw.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo[807] occupy more than 5000 miles of seaboard from north-east\r\nGreenland to the mouth of the Copper river in western Alaska. Many views\r\nhave been advanced as to the position of their centre of dispersion;\r\nmost probably it lay to the west of Hudson Bay. Rink[808] is of opinion\r\nthat they originated as a distinct people in Alaska, where they\r\ndeveloped an Arctic culture; but Boas[809] regards them \"as,\r\ncomparatively speaking, new arrivals in Alaska, which they reached from\r\nthe east.\" A westward movement is supported by myths and customs, and by\r\nthe affinities of the Eskimo with northern Asiatics. There was always\r\nhostility between the Eskimo and the North American Indians, which,\r\napart from their very specialised mode of life, precluded any Eskimo\r\nextension southwards. The expansion of the Eskimo to Greenland is\r\nexplained by Steensby[810] as follows:--the main southern movement would\r\nhave followed the west coast from Melville Bay, rounded the southern\r\npoint and proceeded some distance up the east coast. From the Barren\r\nGrounds north-west of Hudson Bay the Polar Eskimo followed the musk-ox,\r\nadvanced due north to Ellesmere Land, then crossed to Greenland, and,\r\nstill hunting the musk-ox, advanced along the north coast and down the\r\neast coast towards Scoresby Sound. Another line of migration apparently\r\nstarted from the vicinity of Southampton Island and pursued the reindeer\r\nnorthwards into Baffin Land; on reaching Ponds Inlet these\r\nreindeer-hunting Eskimo for the most part turned along the east coast.\r\n\r\nPhysically the Eskimo constitute a distinct type. They are of medium\r\nstature, but possess uncommon strength and endurance; their skin is\r\nlight brownish yellow with a ruddy tint on the exposed parts; hands and\r\nfeet are small and well formed; their heads are high, with broad faces,\r\nand narrow high noses, and eyes of a Mongolian character. But great\r\nvarieties are found in different parts of the vast area over which they\r\nrange. The Polar Eskimo of Greenland, studied by Steensby, were more of\r\nAmerican Indian than of Asiatic type[811]. Of their psychology this\r\nwriter says, \"For the Polar Eskimos life is deadly real and sober, a\r\nconstant striving for food and warmth which is borne with good humour,\r\nand all dispensations are accepted as natural consequences, about which\r\nit is of no use to reason or complain.\" \"The hard struggle for existence\r\nhas not permitted the Polar Eskimo to become other than a confirmed\r\negoist, who knows nothing of disinterestedness. Towards his enemies he\r\nis crafty and deceitful--he does not attack them openly, but indulges\r\nin backbiting.... It is only during the hunt that a common interest and\r\na common danger engender a deeper feeling of comradeship[812].\"\r\n\r\nStill less Mongolian in type are the \"blond Eskimo\" recently encountered\r\nby Stefansson in south-west Victoria Island[813], who are regarded by\r\nhim as very possibly the mixed descendants of Scandinavian ancestors who\r\nhad drifted there from west Greenland. It is known that Eric the Red\r\ndiscovered Greenland in the year 982 and that 3 years later settlers\r\nwent there from the Norse colony in Iceland.\r\n\r\nThe winter snow houses, which are about 12 x 15 ft. in diameter and 12\r\nft. high, usually with annexes, are always occupied by two families,\r\neach woman having her own lamp and sitting on the ledge in front of it.\r\nIf more families join in making a snow house, they make two main rooms.\r\nWhenever it is possible the men spend the short days in hunting and each\r\nwoman prepares the food for her husband. The long nights are mainly\r\nspent in various recreations. The social life in the summer settlement\r\nis somewhat different. The families do not cook their own meals, but a\r\nsingle one suffices for the whole settlement. The day before it is her\r\nturn to cook the woman goes to the hills to fetch enough shrubs for the\r\nfire. When a meal is ready the master of the house calls out and\r\neverybody comes out of his tent with a knife, the men sit in one circle\r\nand the women in another. These dinners, which are always held in the\r\nevening, are almost always enlivened by a mimic performance. The great\r\nreligious feasts take place just before the beginning of winter.\r\n\r\nThere are three forms of social grouping: the Family, House-mates, and\r\nPlace-mates. (1) The family consists of a man, his wife or wives, their\r\nchildren and adopted children; widows and their children may be adopted,\r\nbut the woman retains her own fireplace. Sometimes men are adopted, such\r\nas bachelors without any relatives, cripples, or impoverished men. Joint\r\nownership and use of a boat and house, and common labour and toil in\r\nobtaining the means of support define the real community of the family.\r\n(2) House-mates are families that join together to build and occupy and\r\nmaintain the same house. This form of establishment is especially common\r\nin Greenland, but each family keeps its separate establishment inside\r\nthe common house. (3) Place-fellows. The inhabitants of the same hamlet\r\nor winter establishment form one community although no chief is elected\r\nor authority acknowledged.\r\n\r\nGenerally children are betrothed when very young. The newly married pair\r\nusually live at first with the wife's family. Both polygyny and\r\npolyandry occur. A man may lend or exchange his wife for a whole season\r\nor longer, as a sign of friendship. On certain occasions it is even\r\ncommanded by religious law. There is no government, but there is a kind\r\nof chief in the settlement, though his authority is very limited. He is\r\ncalled the \"pimain,\" _i.e._ he who knows everything best. He decides the\r\nproper time to shift the huts from one place to another, he may ask some\r\nmen to go sealing, others to go deer hunting, but there is not the\r\nslightest obligation to obey him. The men in a community may form\r\nthemselves into an informal council for the regulation of affairs. The\r\ndecorative art of the Eskimo is not remarkably developed, but the\r\npictorial art consists of clever sketches of everyday scenes and there\r\nis a well developed plastic art. Many of the carvings are toys and are\r\nmade for the pleasure of the work. \"The religious views and practices of\r\nthe Eskimo while, on the whole, alike in their fundamental traits, show\r\na considerable amount of differentiation in the extreme east and in the\r\nextreme west. It would seem that the characteristic traits of shamanism\r\nare common to all the Eskimo tribes. The art of the shaman (angakok) is\r\nacquired by the acquisition of guardian spirits.... Besides the spirits\r\nwhich may become guardian spirits of men, the Eskimo believes in a great\r\nmany others which are hostile and bring disaster and death.... The\r\nritualistic development of Eskimo religion is very slight[814].\"\r\n\r\nII. Mackenzie Area. Skirting the Eskimo area is a belt of semi-Arctic\r\nlands almost cut in two by Hudson Bay. To the west are the Dene tribes,\r\nwho are believed to fall into three culture groups, an eastern group,\r\nYellow Knives, Dog Rib, Hares, Slavey, Chipewyan and Beaver; a\r\nsouth-western group, Nahane, Sekani, Babine and Carrier; and a\r\nnorth-western group, comprising the Kutchin, Loucheux, Ahtena and\r\nKhotana. The material culture of the south-western group is deduced\r\nfrom the writings of Father Morice[815]. All the tribes are hunters of\r\nlarge or small game, caribou are often driven into enclosures, small\r\ngame taken in snares or traps; various kinds of fish are largely used,\r\nand a few of the tribes on the head waters of the Pacific take salmon;\r\nlarge use of berries is made, they are mashed and dried by a special\r\nprocess; edible roots and other vegetable foods are used to some extent;\r\nutensils are of wood and bark; there is no pottery; bark vessels are\r\nused for boiling with or without stones; travel in summer is largely by\r\ncanoe, in winter by snowshoe; dog sleds are used to some extent, but\r\nchiefly since trade days, the toboggan form prevailing; clothing is of\r\nskins; mittens and caps are worn; there is no weaving except rabbit-skin\r\ngarments, but fine network occurs on snowshoes, bags, and fish nets,\r\nmaterials being of bark fibre, sinew and babiche; there is also a\r\nspecial form of woven quill work; the typical habitation seems to be the\r\ndouble lean-to, though many intrusive forms occur; other material\r\nculture traits include the making of fish-hooks and spears; a limited\r\nuse of copper; and poorly developed work in stone.\r\n\r\nThe physical characteristics vary very much from tribe to tribe. The\r\nSekani, according to Morice, are slender and bony, in stature rather\r\nbelow the average, with a narrow forehead, hollow cheeks, prominent\r\ncheekbones, small eyes deeply sunk in their orbit, the upper lip very\r\nthin and the lower somewhat protruding, the chin very small and the nose\r\nstraight. The Carriers, on the contrary, are tall and stout, without as\r\na rule being too corpulent. The men average 1.66 m. in height. Their\r\nforehead is much broader than that of the Sekani, and less receding than\r\nis usual with American aborigines. The face is full, and the nose\r\naquiline. All the tribes are remarkably unwarlike, timid, and even\r\ncowardly. Weapons are seldom used and in personal combat, which consists\r\nin a species of wrestling, knives are previously laid aside. The fear of\r\nenemies is a marked feature, due in part, doubtless, to traditional\r\nrecollection of the raids of earlier days. Their honesty is noted by all\r\ntravellers. Morice records that among the Sekani a trader will sometimes\r\ngo on a trapping expedition, leaving his store unlocked, without fear\r\nof any of its contents going amiss. Meantime a native may call in his\r\nabsence, help himself to as much powder and shot or any other item as he\r\nmay need, but he will never fail to leave there an exact equivalent in\r\nfurs.\r\n\r\nThe eastern Dene are nomad hunters who gather berries and roots, while\r\nthe western are semi-sedentary, living for most of the year in villages\r\nwhen they subsist largely on salmon. The former are patrilineal and the\r\nlatter are grouped into matrilineal exogamic totemic clans. The headmen\r\nof the clans formed a class of privileged nobles who alone owned the\r\nhunting grounds. Morice speaks of clan, honorific and personal totems.\r\nThe first two were adopted from coastal tribes, the honorific was\r\nassumed by some individuals in order to attain a rank to which they were\r\nnot entitled by heredity. The \"personal totem\" is the guardian spirit or\r\ngenius, the belief in which is common to nearly all North American\r\npeoples. Shamanism prevails throughout the area. The mythology almost\r\nalways refers to a \"Transformer\" who visited the world when incomplete\r\nand set things in order. They have the custom of the potlatch[816]. If a\r\nman desires another man's wife he can challenge the husband to a\r\nwrestling match, the winner keeps the woman[817].\r\n\r\nIII. North Pacific Coast Area. This culture is rather complex with\r\ntribal variations, but it can be treated under three subdivisions, a\r\nnorthern group, Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian; a central group, the\r\nKwakiutl tribes and the Bellacoola; and a southern group, the Coast\r\nSalish, Nootka, Chinook, Kalapooian, Waiilatpuan, Chimakuan and some\r\nAthapascan tribes. The first of these seem to be the type and are\r\ncharacterised by: the great dependence upon sea food, some hunting upon\r\nthe mainland, large use of berries (dried fish, clams and berries are\r\nthe staple food); cooking with hot stones in boxes and baskets; large\r\nrectangular gabled houses of upright cedar planks with carved posts and\r\ntotem poles; travel chiefly by water in large seagoing dug-out canoes\r\nsome of which had sails; no pottery nor stone vessels, except mortars;\r\nbaskets in checker, those in twine reaching a high state of excellence\r\namong the Tlingit; coil basketry not made; mats of cedar bark and soft\r\nbags in abundance; no true loom, the warp hanging from a bar and weaving\r\nwith the fingers downwards; clothing rather scanty, chiefly of skin, a\r\nwide basket hat (the only one of the kind on the continent, apparently\r\nfor protection against rain); feet usually bare, but skin moccasins and\r\nleggings occasionally made; for weapons the bow, club and a peculiar\r\ndagger, no lances; slat, rod and skin armour; wooden helmets, no\r\nshields; practically no chipped stone tools, but nephrite or green stone\r\nused; wood work highly developed; work in copper possibly aboriginal\r\nbut, if so, weakly developed. The central group differs in a few minor\r\npoints; twisted and loosely woven bark or wool takes the place of skins\r\nfor clothing and baskets are all in checkerwork. Among the southern\r\ngroup appears a strong tendency to use stone arrowheads, and a peculiar\r\nflat club occurs, vaguely similar to the New Zealand type[818].\r\n\r\nPhysically the typical North Pacific tribes are of medium stature, with\r\nlong arms and short bodies. Among the northern branches the stature\r\naverages 1.675 m. (5 ft. 6 in.), the head is very large with an average\r\nindex of 82.5. The face is very broad, the nose concave or straight,\r\nseldom convex, with slight elevation. Among the southern tribes, notably\r\nthe Kwakiutl, the stature averages 1.645 m. (5 ft. 4-3/4 in.), the\r\ncephalic index is 84.5, the face very broad but also of great length,\r\nthe nose very high, rather narrow and frequently convex.\r\n\r\nThe social relations of these peoples vary from tribe to tribe, but on\r\nthe whole they fall into a sequence from north to south. In the northern\r\nportion descent is matrilineal, but patrilineal in the south. J. G.\r\nFrazer does not accept the view of Boas \"that the Northern Kwakiutl have\r\nborrowed both the rule of maternal descent and the division into totemic\r\nclans from their more northerly neighbours of alien stocks; in other\r\nwords, that totemism and mother-kin have spread southward among a people\r\nwho had father-kin and no totemic system[819].\" He inclines \"to the\r\nother view, formerly favoured by Boas himself, namely, that the\r\nKwakiutl are in a stage of transition from mother-kin to\r\nfather-kin[820].\"\r\n\r\nEach village is autonomous and originally may have been restricted to a\r\nsingle totem clan. The population is divided into three ranks, nobles,\r\ncommon people and a low caste consisting of poor people and serfs who\r\ncannot participate in the secret societies. In addition there is a\r\ntotemic grouping. There may be several totemic clans in one village and\r\nthe same totem may not only occur in every village, but may extend from\r\none tribe to another. This suggests that there were originally two, or\r\nin some cases more than two, totemic clans which in process of time\r\nbecame subdivided into sub-clans; these, while retaining the crest of\r\nthe original clan, acquired fresh ones, and the families contained in\r\neach sub-clan may have their special crest or crests in addition. New\r\ncrests and names are constantly being introduced. Marriage is forbidden\r\nbetween people of the same crest, irrespective of the tribe. The natives\r\naccording to Boas do not consider themselves descendants from their\r\ntotem. A wife brings her father's position, crest and privileges as a\r\ndower to her husband, who is not allowed to use them himself, but\r\nacquires them for the use of his son, in other words this inheritance is\r\nin the female line.\r\n\r\nThe widely spread American custom of a youth acquiring a guardian spirit\r\nis far more prevalent among the southern section than the northern, but\r\namong the Kwakiutl he can only obtain as his patron, one or more of a\r\nlimited number of spirits which are hereditary in his clan. In the\r\nnorthern tribes the secret societies are coextensive with the totemic\r\nclans; among the Kwakiutl they are connected with guardian spirits and\r\nit is significant that during the summer, when the people are scattered,\r\nsociety is based on the old clan system, but when the people live\r\ntogether in villages in the winter, society is reorganised on the basis\r\nof the secret societies. There is a highly developed system of barter of\r\nwhich the blanket is now the unit of value, formerly the units were\r\nelk-skins, canoes or slaves. Certain symbolic objects have attained\r\nfanciful values. A vast credit system has grown up based on the custom\r\nof loaning property at high interest, at the great festivals called\r\n\"potlatch\" and by it the giver gains great honour. The religion is\r\nclosely related to the totemic beliefs; supernatural aid is given by\r\nthe spirits to those who win their favour. The raven is the chief figure\r\nin the mythology; he regulates the phenomena of nature, procures fire,\r\ndaylight, and fresh water, and teaches men the arts.\r\n\r\nTo the south, and extending inland to the divide, forming a much less\r\ncharacteristic group are the Salish or Flat-heads who are allied to the\r\nAthapascans. The coastal Salish assimilate the culture just described,\r\nbut the plateau Salish are more democratic, less settled and more\r\nindividualistic in religious matters[821]. The Chinooks or Flat-heads of\r\nthe lower reaches of the Columbia river are nearly extinct. They\r\ndeformed the heads of infants. These tribes and the Shahapts or Nez\r\nPerces are differentiated by garments of raw hides, cranial deformation,\r\nabsence of tattooing and plain bows, but they still have communal houses\r\nthough without totem posts. They cook by means of heated stones and have\r\nzoomorphic masks[822].\r\n\r\nIV. Plateau Area. The Plateau area lies between the North Pacific Coast\r\narea and the Plains. It is far less uniform than either in its\r\ntopography, the south being a veritable desert while the north is moist\r\nand fertile. The traits may be summarised as: extensive use of salmon,\r\ndeer, roots (especially camas) and berries; the use of a handled digging\r\nstick, cooking with hot stones in holes and baskets; the pulverisation\r\nof dried salmon and roots for storage; winter houses, semi-subterranean,\r\na circular pit with a conical roof and smoke hole entrance; summer\r\nhouses, movable or transient, mat or rush-covered tents and the lean-to,\r\ndouble and single; the dog sometimes used as a pack animal; water\r\ntransportation weakly developed, crude dug-outs and bark canoes being\r\nused; pottery not known; basketry highly developed, coil, rectangular\r\nshapes, imbricated technique; twine weaving in flexible bags and mats;\r\nsome simple weaving of bark fibre for clothing; clothing for the entire\r\nbody usually of deerskins; skin caps for the men, and in some cases\r\nbasket caps for women; blankets of woven rabbit-skin; the sinew-backed\r\nbow prevailed; clubs, lances, and knives, and rod and slat armour were\r\nused in war, also heavy leather shirts; fish spears, hooks, traps and\r\nbag nets were used; dressing of deerskins highly developed; upright\r\nstretching frames and straight long handled scrapers; wood work more\r\nadvanced than among Plains tribes, but insignificant compared to North\r\nPacific Coast area; stone work confined to the making of tools and\r\npoints, battering and flaking; work in bone, metal, and feathers very\r\nweak[823].\r\n\r\nOf the tribes of this area, the interior Salish, the Thompson, Shushwap\r\nand Lillooet, appear to be the most typical of those concerning which\r\nany information is available. The Shahapts or Nez Perces, and the\r\nShoshoni show some marked Plains traits. \"The interior Salish are\r\nlandsmen and hunters, and from time immemorial have been accustomed to\r\nfollow their game over mountainous country. This mode of life has\r\nengendered among them an active, slender, athletic type of men; they are\r\nconsiderably taller and possess a much finer physique than their\r\ncongeners of the coastal region, who are fishermen, passing the larger\r\nportion of their time on the water squatting in their canoes, never\r\nwalking to any place if they can possibly reach it by water. The typical\r\ncoast Salish are a squat thick-set people, with disproportionate legs\r\nand bodies, slow and heavy in their movements, and as unlike their\r\nbrothers of the interior as it is possible for them to be[824].\"\r\n\r\nThe Thompsons represented the Salish at their highest and best, both\r\nmorally and physically, and their ethical precepts and teaching set a\r\nvery high standard of virtue before the advent of the Europeans.\r\nHill-Tout says that receptiveness and a wholesale adoption of foreign\r\nfashions and customs are their striking qualities, and \"if they have\r\nfallen away from these high standards, as we fear they have, the fault\r\nis not theirs but ours.... We assumed a grave responsibility when we\r\nundertook to civilise these races[825].\"\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of social organisation is found among the interior\r\nhunting tribes, where a state of pure anarchy may be said to have\r\nformerly prevailed, each family being a law unto itself and\r\nacknowledging no authority save that of its own elderman. Each local\r\ncommunity was composed of a greater or less number of these self-ruling\r\nfamilies. There was a kind of headship or nominal authority given to the\r\noldest and wisest of the eldermen in some of the larger communities,\r\nwhere occasion called for it or where circumstances arose in which it\r\nbecame necessary to have a central representative. This led in some\r\ncentres to the regular appointing of local chiefs or heads whose\r\nbusiness it was to look after the material interest of the commune over\r\nwhich they presided; but the office was always strictly elective and\r\nhedged with manifold limitations as to authority and privilege. For\r\nexample, the local chief was not necessarily the head of all\r\nundertakings. He would not lead in war or the chase unless he happened\r\nto be the best hunter or the bravest and most skilful warrior among\r\nthem; and he was subject to deposition at a moment's notice if his\r\nconduct did not meet with the approval of the elders of the commune. His\r\noffice or leadership was therefore purely a nominal one. All hunting,\r\nfishing, root, and berry grounds were common property and shared in by\r\nall alike.... In one particular tribe even the food was held and meals\r\nwere taken in common, the presiding elder or headman calling upon a\r\ncertain family each day to provide and prepare the meals for all the\r\nrest, every one, more or less, taking it in turn to discharge this\r\nsocial duty[826].\r\n\r\nV. Californian Area. Of the four sub-culture areas noted by Kroeber[827]\r\nthe central group is the most extensive and typical. Its main\r\ncharacteristics are: acorns as the chief vegetable food, supplemented by\r\nwild seeds, while roots and berries are scarcely used; the acorns are\r\nmade into bread by a roundabout process; hunting is mostly of small\r\ngame, fishing wherever possible; the houses are of many forms, all\r\nsimple shelters of brush or tule, or more substantial conical lean-to\r\nstructures of poles; the dog was not used for packing and there were no\r\ncanoes, but rafts of tule were used for ferrying; no pottery but high\r\ndevelopment of basketry both coil and twine; bags and mats scanty; cloth\r\nor other weaving of simple elements not known; clothing simple and\r\nscanty; feet usually bare; the bow the only weapon, usually\r\nsinew-backed; work in skins, wood, bone etc., weak, in metals absent, in\r\nstone work not advanced. In the south modifications enter with large\r\ngroups of Yuman and Shoshonian tribes where pottery, sandals and wooden\r\nwar clubs are intrusive. The extinct Santa Barbara were excellent\r\nworkers in stone, bone and shell, and made plank canoes.\r\n\r\nTopographical variation produces consequent changes in mode of life as\r\nthe well watered and wooded country of Oregon and Northern California\r\ngradually merges into the warm dry climate of South California with\r\ndecreasing moisture towards the tropics. As Kroeber says[828], \"From the\r\ntime of the first settlement of California, its Indians have been\r\ndescribed as both more primitive and more peaceful than the majority of\r\nthe natives of North America.... The practical arts of life, the social\r\ninstitutions and the ceremonies of the Californian Indians are unusually\r\nsimple and undeveloped. There was no war for its own sake, no\r\nconfederation of powerful tribes, no communal stone pueblos, no totems,\r\nor potlatches. The picturesqueness and the dignity of the Indians are\r\nlacking. In general rudeness of culture the Californian Indians are\r\nscarcely above the Eskimo.... If the degree of civilisation attained by\r\npeople depends in any large measure on their habitat, as does not seem\r\nlikely, it might be concluded from the case of the Californian Indians\r\nthat natural advantages were an impediment rather than an incentive to\r\nprogress.... It is possible to speak of typical Californian Indians and\r\nto recognise a typical Californian culture area. A feature that should\r\nnot be lost sight of is the great stability of population.... The social\r\norganisation was both simple and loose.... Beyond the family the only\r\nbases of organisation were the village and the language.\" In so simple a\r\ncondition of society difference of rank naturally found but little\r\nscope. The influence of chiefs was comparatively small, and distinct\r\nclasses, as of nobility or slaves, were unknown. Individual property\r\nrights were developed and what organisation of society there was, was\r\nlargely on the basis of property. The ceremonies are characterised by a\r\nvery slight development of the extreme ritualism that is so\r\ncharacteristic of the American Indians, and by an almost entire absence\r\nof symbolism of any kind. Fetishism is also unusual. One set of\r\nceremonies was usually connected with a secret religious society; during\r\ninitiation members were disguised by feathers and paint, but masks were\r\nnot worn. There was also an annual tribal spectacular ceremony held in\r\nremembrance of the dead. In the north-west portion of the state a\r\nsomewhat more highly developed and specialised culture existed which has\r\nsome affinities with that of the north-west tribes, as is indicated by a\r\ngreater advance in technology, a social organisation largely upon a\r\nproperty basis and a system of mythology that is suggestive of those\r\nfurther north. The now extinct tribes of the Santa Barbara islands and\r\nadjacent mainland were more advanced. They alone employed a plank-built\r\ncanoe instead of the balsas or canoe-shaped bundles of rushes of the\r\ngreater part of California. They made stone bowls and did inlaid work.\r\nLike the North Californians and tribes further north they buried instead\r\nof burning their dead. The eastern tribes shade off into their\r\nneighbours. The Luiseno, the southernmost of the Shoshonians, had\r\npuberty rites for girls and boys[829]. The belief in a succession of\r\nbirths \"is reminiscent of Oceanic and Asiatic ways of thought[830].\"\r\n[About] 1788 a secret cult arose inculcating, with penalties, obedience,\r\nfasting, and self-sacrifice on initiates[831].\r\n\r\nVI. Plains Area. The chief traits of this culture are the dependence\r\nupon the bison (\"buffalo\") and the very limited use of roots and\r\nberries; absence of fishing; lack of agriculture; the _tipi_ or tent as\r\nthe movable dwelling and transportation by land only, with the dog and\r\nthe travois (in historic times, with the horse); no baskets, pottery, or\r\ntrue weaving; clothing of bison and deerskins; there is high development\r\nof work in skins and special bead technique and raw-hide work\r\n(parfleche, cylindrical bag etc.), and weak development of work in wood,\r\nstone and bone. This typical culture is manifested in the Assiniboin,\r\nArapaho, Blackfoot, Crow, Cheyenne, Comanche, Gros Ventre, Kiowa,\r\nKiowa-Apache, Sarsi and Teton-Dakota[832]. Among the tribes of the\r\neastern border a limited use of pottery and basketry may be added, some\r\nspinning and weaving of bags, and rather extensive agriculture. Here the\r\ntipi alternates with larger and more permanent houses covered with\r\ngrass, bark or earth, and there was some attempt at water\r\ntransportation. These tribes are the Arikara, Hidatsa, Iowa, Kansa,\r\nMandan, Missouri, Omaha, Osage, Oto, Pawnee, Ponca, Santee-Dakota[833],\r\nYankton-Dakota[833] and Wichita.\r\n\r\nOn the western border other tribes (Wind River Shoshoni, Uinta and\r\nUncompahgre Ute) lack pottery but produce a rather high type of\r\nbasketry, depending far less on the bison but more on deer and small\r\ngame, making large use of wild grass seeds.\r\n\r\nOn the north-eastern border the Plains-Ojibway and Plains-Cree combine\r\nmany traits of the forest hunting tribes with those found in the Plains.\r\n\r\nThe Dakota or Sioux are universally conceded to be of the highest type,\r\nphysically, mentally and probably morally of any of the western tribes.\r\nTheir bravery has never been questioned by white or Indian and they\r\nconquered or drove out every rival except the Ojibway. Their physical\r\ncharacteristics are as follows: dark skin faintly tinged with red,\r\nfacial features more strongly marked than those of the Pacific Coast\r\nIndians, nose and lower jaw particularly prominent and heavy, head\r\ngenerally mesocephalic and not artificially deformed. They are a free\r\nand dominant race of hunters and warriors, necessarily strong and\r\nactive. Their weapons of stone, wood, bone and horn are tomahawk, club,\r\nflint knife, and bow and arrow. All their habits centre in the bison,\r\nwhich provided the staple materials of nutrition and industry. Drawing\r\nand painting were done on prepared bison skins and elaborately carved\r\npipes were made for ceremonial use.\r\n\r\nThey are divided into kinship groups, with inheritance as a rule in the\r\nmale line. The woman is autocrat of the home. Exogamy was strictly\r\nenforced in the clan but marriage within the tribe or with related\r\ntribes was encouraged. The marriage was arranged by the parents and\r\npolygyny was common where means would permit. Government consisted in\r\nchieftainship acquired by personal merit, and the old men exercised\r\nconsiderable influence.\r\n\r\nReligious conceptions were based on a belief in _Wakonda_ or\r\n_Manito_[834], an all-pervading spirit force, whose cult involved\r\nvarious shamanistic ceremonials consisting of dancing, chanting,\r\nfeasting and fasting. Most distinctive of these is the Sun dance,\r\npractised by almost all the tribes of the plains except the Comanche. It\r\nis an annual festival lasting several days, in honour of the sun, for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining abundant produce throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe Sun dance was not only the greatest ceremony of the Plains tribes\r\nbut was a condition of their existence. More than any other ceremony or\r\noccasion, it furnished the tribe the opportunity for the expression of\r\nemotion in rhythm, and was the occasion of the tribe becoming more\r\nclosely united. It gave opportunity for the making and renewing of\r\ncommon interests, the inauguration of tribal policies, and the renewing\r\nof the rank of the chiefs; for the exhibition, by means of mourning\r\nfeasts, of grief over the loss of members of families; for the\r\nfulfilment of social obligations by means of feasts; and, finally, for\r\nthe exercise and gratification of the emotions of love on the part of\r\nthe young in the various social dances which always formed an\r\ninteresting feature of the ceremony[835].\r\n\r\nBeing strongly opposed by the missionaries because it was utterly\r\nmisunderstood[836], and finding no favour in official circles, the Sun\r\ndance has been for many years an object of persecution, and in\r\nconsequence is extinct among the Dakota, Crows, Mandan, Pawnee, and\r\nKiowa, but it is still performed by the Cree, Siksika (Blackfoot),\r\nArapaho, Cheyenne, Assiniboin, Ponca, Shoshoni and Ute, though in many\r\nof these tribes its disappearance is near at hand, for it has lost part\r\nof its rites and has become largely a spectacle for gain rather than a\r\ngreat religious ceremony[837].\r\n\r\nThe Pawnee do not differ at all widely from the Dakota, but have a\r\nsomewhat finer cast of features. They are more given to agriculture,\r\nraising crops of maize, pumpkins, etc. The Pawnee type of hut is\r\ncharacteristic, consisting of a circular framework of poles or logs,\r\ncovered with brush, bark and earth. Their religious ceremonies were\r\nconnected with the cosmic forces and the heavenly bodies. The dominating\r\npower was Tirawa generally spoken of as \"Father.\" The winds, thunder,\r\nlightning and rain were his messengers. Among the Skidi the morning and\r\nevening stars represented the masculine and feminine elements, and were\r\nconnected with the advent and perpetuation on earth of all living forms.\r\nA series of ceremonies relative to the bringing of life and its increase\r\nbegan with the first thunder in the spring and culminated at the summer\r\nsolstice in human sacrifice, but the series did not close until the\r\nmaize, called \"mother corn,\" was harvested. At every stage of the series\r\ncertain shrines or \"bundles\" became the centre of a ceremony. Each\r\nshrine was in charge of an hereditary keeper, but its rituals and\r\nceremonies were in the keeping of a priesthood open to all proper\r\naspirants. Through the sacred and symbolic articles of the shrines and\r\ntheir rituals and ceremonies a medium of communication was believed to\r\nbe opened between the people and the supernatural powers, by which food,\r\nlong life and prosperity were obtained. The mythology of the Pawnee is\r\nremarkably rich in symbolism and poetic fancy and their religious system\r\nis elaborate and cogent. The secret societies, of which there were\r\nseveral in each tribe, were connected with the belief in supernatural\r\nanimals. The functions of these societies were to call the game, to heal\r\ndiseases, and to give occult powers. Their rites were elaborate and\r\ntheir ceremonies dramatic[838].\r\n\r\nThe Blackfeet or Siksika[839], an Algonquian confederacy of the northern\r\nplains, agree in culture with the Plains tribes generally, though there\r\nis evidence of an earlier culture, approximately that of the eastern\r\nwoodland tribes. They are divided into the Siksika proper, or Blackfeet,\r\nthe Kainah or Bloods, and the Piegan, the whole being popularly known as\r\nBlackfoot or Blackfeet. Formerly bison and deer were their chief food\r\nand there is no evidence that they ever practised agriculture, though\r\ntobacco was grown and used entirely for ceremonial purposes. The doors\r\nof their tipis always faced east. They have a great number of\r\ndances--religious, war and social--besides secret societies for various\r\npurposes, together with many \"sacred bundles\" around every one of which\r\ncentres a ritual. Practically every adult has his personal \"medicine.\"\r\nThe principal deities are the Sun, and a supernatural being known as\r\n_Napi_ \"Old Man,\" who may be an incarnation of the same idea. The\r\nreligious activity of a Blackfoot consists in putting himself into a\r\nposition where the cosmic power will take pity upon him and give him\r\nsomething in return. There was no conception of a single personal\r\ngod[840].\r\n\r\nThe Arapaho, another Algonquian Plains tribe, were once according to\r\ntheir own traditions a sedentary agricultural people far to the north of\r\ntheir present range, apparently in North Minnesota. They have been\r\nclosely associated with the Cheyenne for many generations[841]. The\r\nannual Sun Dance is their greatest tribal ceremony, and they were active\r\npropagators of the ghost-dance religion of the last century which\r\ncentred in the belief in the coming of a messiah and the restoration of\r\nthe country to the Indians[842].\r\n\r\nThe Cheyenne, also of agricultural origin, have been for generations a\r\ntypical prairie tribe, living in skin tipis, following the bison over\r\nlarge areas, travelling and fighting on horseback. In character they are\r\nproud, contentious, and brave to desperation, with an exceptionally high\r\nstandard for women. Under the old system they had a council of 44\r\nelective chiefs, of whom four constituted a higher body, with power to\r\nelect one of their number as head chief of the tribe. In all councils\r\nthat concerned the relations with other tribes, one member of the\r\ncouncil was appointed to argue as proxy or \"devil's advocate\" for the\r\nalien people. The council of 44 is still symbolised by a bundle of 44\r\ninvitation sticks, kept with the sacred medicine-arrows, and formerly\r\nsent round when occasion arose to convene the assembly. The four\r\nmedicine-arrows constitute the tribal palladium which they claim to have\r\nhad from the beginning of the world. It was exposed once a year with\r\nappropriate rites, and is still religiously preserved. No woman, white\r\nman, or even mixed blood of the tribe has ever been allowed to come near\r\nthe sacred arrows. In priestly dignity the keepers of the\r\nmedicine-arrows and the priests of the Sun dance rites stood first and\r\nequal[843].\r\n\r\nVII. Eastern Woodland Area[844]. The culture north of the Great Lakes\r\nand east of the St Lawrence is comparable to that of the Dene (see p.\r\n361), the main traits being: the taking of caribou in pens; the snaring\r\nof game; the importance of small game and fish, also of berries; the\r\nweaving of rabbit-skins; the birch canoe; the toboggan; the conical skin\r\nor bark-covered shelter; the absence of basketry and pottery and the use\r\nof bark and wooden utensils. To this northern group belong the Ojibway\r\nnorth of the lakes, including the Saulteaux, the Wood Cree, the\r\nMontagnais and the Naskapi. Further south the main body falls into three\r\nlarge divisions: Iroquoian tribes (Huron, Wyandot, Erie, Susquehanna and\r\nFive Nations); Central Algonquian to the west of the Iroquois (some\r\nOjibway, Ottawa, Menomini, Sauk and Fox[845], Potawatomi, Peoria,\r\nIllinois, Kickapoo, Miami, Piankashaw, Shawnee and Siouan Winnebago);\r\nEastern Algonquian (Abnaki group and Micmac).\r\n\r\nThe Central group west of the Iroquois appears to be the most typical\r\nand the best known and the following are the main culture traits: maize,\r\nsquashes and bean were cultivated, wild rice where available was a great\r\nstaple, and maple sugar was manufactured; deer, bear and even bison were\r\nhunted; also wild fowl; fishing was fairly developed, especially\r\nsturgeon fishing on the lakes; pottery poor, but formerly used for\r\ncooking vessels, vessels of wood and bark common; some splint basketry;\r\ntwo types of shelter prevailed, a dome-shaped bark or mat-covered lodge\r\nfor winter and a rectangular bark house for summer, though the Ojibway\r\nused the conical type of the northern border group; dug-out and bark\r\ncanoes and snowshoes were used, occasionally the toboggan and dog\r\ntraction; weaving was of bark fibre (downward with fingers), and soft\r\nbags, pack lines and fish nets were made; clothing was of skins;\r\nsoft-soled moccasins with drooping flaps, leggings, breech-cloth and\r\nsleeved shirts for men, for women a skirt and jacket, though a one-piece\r\ndress was known; robes of skin or woven rabbit-skin; no armour or\r\nlances; bows of plain wood and clubs; in trade days, the tomahawk; work\r\nin wood, stone and bone weakly developed; probably considerable use of\r\ncopper in prehistoric times; feather-work rare.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern group agriculture was more intensive (except in the\r\nnorth) and pottery was more highly developed. Woven feather cloaks were\r\ncommon, there was a special development of work in steatite, and more\r\nuse was made of edible roots.\r\n\r\nThe Iroquoian tribes were even more intensive agriculturalists and\r\npotters. They made some use of the blow-gun, developed cornhusk weaving,\r\ncarved elaborate masks from wood, lived in rectangular houses of\r\npeculiar pattern, built fortifications and were superior in bone\r\nwork[846].\r\n\r\nIn physical type the Ojibways[847], who may be taken as typical of the\r\ncentral Algonquians, were 1.73 m. (5 ft. 8 in.) in height, with\r\nbrachycephalic heads (82 in the east, 80 in the west, but variable),\r\nheavy strongly developed cheek-bones and heavy and prominent nose. They\r\nwere hard fighters and beat back the raids of the Iroquois on the east\r\nand of the Foxes on the south, and drove the Sioux before them out upon\r\nthe Plains. According to Schoolcraft, who was personally acquainted with\r\nthem and married a woman of the tribe, the warriors equalled in physical\r\nappearance the best formed of the North-West Indians, with the possible\r\nexception of the Foxes.\r\n\r\nThey were organised in many exogamous clans; descent was patrilineal\r\nalthough it was matrilineal in most Algonquian tribes. The clan system\r\nwas totemic. There was a clan chief and generally a tribal chief as\r\nwell, chosen from one clan in which the office was hereditary. His\r\nauthority was rather indefinite.\r\n\r\nAs regards religion W. Jones[848] notes their belief in a cosmic mystery\r\npresent throughout all Nature, called \"Manito.\" It was natural to\r\nidentify the Manito with both animate and inanimate objects and the\r\nimpulse was strong to enter into personal relations with the mystic\r\npower. There was one personification of the cosmic mystery; and this was\r\nan animate being called the Great Manito. Although they have long been\r\nin friendly relations with the whites Christianity has had but little\r\neffect on them, largely owing to the conservatism of the native\r\nmedicine-men. The _Medewiwin_, or grand medicine society, was a powerful\r\norganisation, which controlled all the movements of the tribe[849].\r\n\r\nThe Iroquois[850] are not much differentiated in general culture from\r\nthe stocks around them, but in political development they stand unique.\r\nThe Five Nations, Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga and Seneca\r\n(subsequently joined by the Tuscarora), formed the famous League of the\r\nIroquois about the year 1570. Each tribe remained independent in matters\r\nof local concern, but supreme authority was delegated to a council of\r\nelected sachems. They were second to no other Indian people north of\r\nMexico in political organisation, statecraft and military prowess, and\r\ntheir astute diplomats were a match for the wily French and English\r\nstatesmen with whom they treated. So successful was this confederacy\r\nthat for centuries it enjoyed complete supremacy over its neighbours,\r\nuntil it controlled the country from Hudson Bay to North Carolina. The\r\npowerful Ojibway at the end of Lake Superior checked their north-west\r\nexpansion, and their own kindred the Cherokee stopped their progress\r\nsouthwards.\r\n\r\nThe social organisation was as a rule much more complex and cohesive\r\nthan that of any other Indians, and the most notable difference was in\r\nregard to the important position accorded to the women. Among the\r\nCherokee, the Iroquois and the Hurons the women performed important and\r\nessential functions in their government. Every chief was chosen and\r\nretained his position and every important measure was enacted by the\r\nconsent and cooperation of the child-bearing women, and the candidate\r\nfor a chieftainship was nominated by the suffrages of the matrons of\r\nthis group. His selection from among their sons had to be confirmed by\r\nthe tribal and the federal councils respectively, and finally he was\r\ninstalled into office by federal officers. Lands and the \"long houses\"\r\nof related families belonged solely to the women.\r\n\r\nVIII. South-eastern Area. This area is conveniently divided by the\r\nMississippi, the typical culture occurring in the east. The Powhatan\r\ngroup and the Shawnee are intermediate, and the chief tribes are the\r\nMuskhogean (Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, etc.) and Iroquoian\r\ntribes (Cherokee and Tuscarora) with the Yuchi, Eastern Siouan, Tunican\r\nand Quapaw. The main culture traits are: great use of vegetable food and\r\nintensive agriculture; maize, cane (a kind of millet), pumpkins,\r\nwatermelons and tobacco being raised. Large use of wild vegetables, the\r\ndog, the only domestic animal, eaten; later chickens, hogs, horses and\r\ncattle quickly adopted; large game, deer, bear and bison, in the west;\r\nturkeys and small game also hunted; some fishing (with fish poison); of\r\nmanufactured foods bears' oil, hickory-nut oil, persimmon bread and\r\nhominy are noteworthy, together with the famous black drink[851]; houses\r\ngenerally rectangular with curved roofs, covered with thatch or bark,\r\noften with plaster walls, reinforced with wicker work; towns were\r\nfortified with palisades; dug-out canoes were used for transport.\r\nClothing chiefly of deerskins and bison robes, shirt-like garments for\r\nmen, skirts and toga-like, upper garments for women, boot-like moccasins\r\nin winter; there were woven fabrics of bark fibre, fine netted feather\r\ncloaks, and some bison hair weaving in the west (the weaving being\r\ndownwards with the fingers); baskets of cane and splints, the double or\r\nnetted basket and the basket meal sieve being special forms; knives of\r\ncane, darts of cane and bone; blow-guns in general use; pottery good,\r\ncoil process, with paddle decorations; a particular method of skin\r\ndressing (macerated in mortars), good work in stone, but little in\r\nmetal[852].\r\n\r\nThe Creek women were short though well formed, while the warrior\r\naccording to Pickett[853] was \"larger than the ordinary race of\r\nEuropeans, often above 6 ft. in height, but was invariably well formed,\r\nerect in his carriage, and graceful in every movement. They were proud,\r\nhaughty and arrogant, brave and valiant in war.\" As a people they were\r\nmore than usually devoted to decoration and ornament; they were fond of\r\nmusic and ball play was their most important game. Each Creek town had\r\nits independent government, under an elected chief who was advised by\r\nthe council of the town in all important matters. Certain towns were\r\nconsecrated to peace ceremonies and were known as \"white towns,\" while\r\nothers, set apart for war ceremonials, were known as \"red towns.\" The\r\nsolemn annual festival of the Creeks was the \"busk\" or _puskita_, a\r\nrejoicing over the first-fruits of the year. Each town celebrated its\r\nbusk whenever the crops had come to maturity. All the worn-out clothes,\r\nhousehold furniture, pots and pans and refuse, grain and other\r\nprovisions were gathered together into a heap and consumed. After a\r\nfast, all the fires in the town were extinguished and a priest kindled a\r\nnew fire from which were made all the fires in the town. A general\r\namnesty was proclaimed, all malefactors might return to their towns and\r\ntheir offences were forgiven. Indeed the new fire meant the new life,\r\nphysical and moral, which had to begin with the new year[854].\r\n\r\nThe Yuchi houses are grouped round a square plot of ground which is held\r\nas sacred, and here the religious ceremonies and social gatherings take\r\nplace. On the edges stand four ceremonial lodges, in conformity with the\r\nfour cardinal points, in which the different clan groups have assigned\r\nplaces. The square ground symbolises the rainbow, where in the\r\nsky-world, Sun, the mythical culture-hero, underwent the ceremonial\r\nordeals which he handed down to the first Yuchi. The Sun, as chief of\r\nthe sky-world, author of the life, the ceremonies and the culture of the\r\npeople, is by far the most important figure in their religious life.\r\nVarious animals in the sky-world and vegetation spirits are recognised,\r\nbesides the totemic ancestral spirits, who play an important part.\r\n\r\nAccording to Speck[855] \"the members of each clan believe that they are\r\nrelatives and, in some vague way, the descendants of certain\r\npre-existing animals whose names and identity they now bear. The animal\r\nancestors are accordingly totemic. In regard to the living animals,\r\nthey, too, are the earthly types and descendants of the pre-existing\r\nones, hence, since they trace their descent from the same sources as the\r\nhuman clans, the two are consanguinely related.\" Thus the members of a\r\nclan feel obliged not to do violence to the wild animals having the form\r\nor name of their tutelaries, though the flesh and fur may be obtained\r\nfrom the members of other clans who are under no such obligations. The\r\ndifferent individuals of the clan inherit the protection of the clan\r\ntotems at the initiatory rites, and thenceforth retain them as their\r\nprotectors through life.\r\n\r\nPublic religious worship centres in the complex annual ceremony\r\nconnected with the corn harvest and includes the making of new fire,\r\nclan dances impersonating totemic ancestors, dances to propitiate\r\nmaleficent spirits and acknowledge the assistance of beneficent ones in\r\nthe hope of a continuance of their benefits, scarification of the males\r\nfor sacrifice and purification, taking an emetic as a purifier, the\r\npartaking of the first green corn of the season, and the performance of\r\na characteristic ball game with two sticks.\r\n\r\nThe middle and lower portions of the Mississippi valley with out-lying\r\nterritories exhibit archaeological evidence of a remarkable culture,\r\nhigher than that of any other area north of Mexico. This culture\r\nwas characterised by \"well established sedentary life, extensive\r\npractice of agricultural pursuits, and construction of permanent\r\nworks--domiciliary, religious, civic, defensive and mortuary, of great\r\nmagnitude and much diversity of form.\" The people, some, if not all of\r\nwhom were mound-builders, were of numerous linguistic stocks, Siouan,\r\nAlgonquian, Iroquoian, Muskhogean, Tunican, Chitimachan, Caddoan and\r\nothers, and \"these historic peoples, remnants of which are still found\r\nwithin the area, were doubtless preceded by other groups not of a\r\ndistinct race but probably of the same or related linguistic families.\r\nThis view, in recent years, has gradually taken the place of the early\r\nassumption that the mound culture belonged to a people of high cultural\r\nattainments who had been succeeded by Indian tribes. That mound building\r\ncontinued down to the period of European occupancy is a well established\r\nfact, and many of the burial mounds contain as original inclusions\r\narticles of European make[856].\"\r\n\r\nThese general conclusions are in no way opposed to De Nadaillac's\r\nsuggestion that the mounds were certainly the work of Indians, but of\r\nmore civilised tribes than the present Algonquians, by whom they were\r\ndriven south to Florida, and there found with their towns,\r\ncouncil-houses, and other structures by the first white settlers[857].\r\nIt would appear, however, from F. H. Cushing's investigations, that\r\nthese tribal council-houses of the Seminole Indians were a local\r\ndevelopment, growing up on the spot under conditions quite different\r\nfrom those prevailing in the north. Many of the vast shell-mounds,\r\nespecially between Tampa and Cape Sable, are clearly of artificial\r\nstructure, that is, made with definite purpose, and carried up\r\nsymmetrically into large mounds comparable in dimensions with the Indian\r\nmounds of the interior. They originated with pile dwellings in shallow\r\nwater, where the kitchen refuse, chiefly shells, accumulates and rises\r\nabove the surface, when the building appears to stand on posts in a low\r\nmound. Then this type of structure comes to be regarded as the normal\r\nfor house-building everywhere. \"Through this natural series of changes\r\nin type there is a tendency to the development of mounds as sites for\r\nhabitations and for the council-house of the clan or tribe, the sites\r\nbeing either separate mounds or single large mounds, according to\r\ncircumstances. Thus the study of the living Seminole Indians and of the\r\nshell-mounds in the same vicinity ... suggests a possible origin for a\r\ncustom of mound-building at one time so prevalent among the North\r\nAmerican Indians[858].\" But if this be the genesis of such structures,\r\nthe custom must have spread from the shores of the Gulf inland, and not\r\nfrom the Ohio valley southwards to Florida.\r\n\r\nIX. South-western Area. On account of its highly developed state and its\r\nprehistoric antecedents, the Pueblo culture appears as the type, though\r\nthis is by no means uniform in the different villages. Three\r\ngeographical groups may be recognised, the Hopi[859], the Zuni[860] and\r\nthe Rio Grande[861].\r\n\r\nThe culture of the whole may be characterised by: main dependence upon\r\nmaize and other cultivated foods (men doing the cultivating and\r\ncloth-weaving instead of women); use of a grinding stone instead of a\r\nmortar; the art of masonry; loom or upward weaving; cultivated cotton as\r\na textile material; pottery decorated in colour; unique style of\r\nbuilding and the domestication of the turkey. Though the main dependence\r\nwas on vegetable food there was some hunting; the eastern villages\r\nhunted bison and deer, especially Taos. Drives of rabbits and antelopes\r\nwere practised, the unique hunting weapon being the curved rabbit stick.\r\nWoven robes were usual. Men wore aprons and a robe when needed. Women\r\nwore a garment reaching from shoulder to knee fastened on the right\r\nshoulder only. In addition to cloth robes some were woven of rabbit-skin\r\nand some netted with turkey feathers. Hard-soled moccasins were worn,\r\nthose for women having long strips of deerskin wound round the leg.\r\nPottery was highly developed, not only for practical use. Basketry was\r\nknown but not so highly developed as among the non-Pueblo tribes. The\r\ndog was not used for transportation and there were no boats. Work in\r\nstone and wood not superior to that of other areas; some work in\r\nturquoise, but none in metal.\r\n\r\nMany tribes appear to be transitional to the Pueblo type. Thus the Pima\r\nonce lived in adobe houses, though not of Pueblo type, they developed\r\nirrigation but also made extensive use of wild plants, raised cotton,\r\nwove cloth, were indifferent potters but experts in basketry. The\r\nMohave, Yuma, Cocopa, Maricopa and Yavapai built a square flat-roofed\r\nhouse of wood, had no irrigation, were not good basket-makers (except\r\nthe Yavapai) but otherwise resembled the Pima. The Walapai and Havasupai\r\nwere somewhat more nomadic.\r\n\r\nThe Athapascan tribes to the east show intermediate cultures. The\r\nJicarilla and Mescalero used the Plains tipi, gathered wild vegetable\r\nfood, hunted bison, had no agriculture or weaving, but dressed in skins,\r\nand had the glass-bead technique of the Plains. The western Apache\r\ndiffered little from these, but rarely used tipis and gave a little more\r\nattention to agriculture. In general the Apache have certain undoubted\r\nPueblo traits, they also remind one of the Plains, the Plateaus, and, in\r\na lean-to like shelter, of the Mackenzie area. The Navaho seem to have\r\ntaken their most striking features from European influence, but their\r\nshelter is of the northern type, while costume, pottery and feeble\r\nattempts at basketry and formerly at agriculture suggest Pueblo\r\ninfluence[862].\r\n\r\nPueblo culture takes its name from the towns or villages of stone or\r\nadobe houses which form the characteristic feature of the area. These\r\nvary according to the locality, those in the north being generally of\r\nsandstone, while adobe or sun-dried brick was employed to the south. The\r\ngroups of dwellings were generally compact structures of several\r\nstories, with many small rooms, built in terrace fashion, the roof of\r\none storey forming a promenade for the storey next above. Thus from the\r\nfront the structure is like a gigantic staircase, from the back a\r\nperpendicular wall. The upper houses were and still are reached by means\r\nof movable ladders and a hatchway in the roof. Mainly in the north but\r\nscattered throughout the area are the remains of dwellings built in\r\nnatural recesses of cliffs, while in some places the cliff face is\r\nhoneycombed with masonry to provide habitations.\r\n\r\nAlthough doubtless designed for purposes of hiding and defence, many of\r\nthe cliff houses were near streams and fields and were occupied because\r\nthey afforded shelter and were natural dwelling places; many were\r\nstorage places for maize and other property: others again were places\r\nfor outlook from which the fields could be watched or the approach of\r\nstrangers observed. In some districts evidence of post-Spanish occupancy\r\nexists. From intensive investigation of the cliff dwellings it is\r\nevident that the inhabitants had the same material culture as that of\r\nexisting Pueblo Indians, and from the ceremonial objects which have been\r\ndiscovered and the symbolic decoration that was employed it is equally\r\nclear that their religion was essentially similar. Moreover the various\r\ntypes of skulls that have been recovered are similar to those of the\r\npresent population of the district. It may therefore be safely said that\r\nthere is no evidence of the former general occupancy of the region by\r\npeoples other than those now classed as Pueblo Indians or their\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Fewkes points out that the district is one of arid plateaus,\r\nseparated and dissected by deep canons, frequently composed of\r\nflat-lying rock strata forming ledge-marked cliffs by the erosive action\r\nof the rare storms. \"Only along the few streams heading in the mountains\r\ndoes permanent water exist, and along the cliff lines slabs of rock\r\nsuitable for building abound; and the primitive ancients, dependent as\r\nthey were on environment, naturally produced the cliff dwellings. The\r\ntendency toward this type was strengthened by intertribal relations; the\r\ncliff dwellers were probably descended from agricultural or\r\nsemi-agricultural villagers who sought protection against enemies, and\r\nthe control of land and water through aggregation in communities....\r\nLocally the ancient villages of Canyon de Chelly are known as Aztec\r\nruins, and this designation is just so far as it implies relationship\r\nwith the aborigines of moderately advanced culture in Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica, though it would be misleading if regarded as indicating\r\nessential difference between the ancient villagers and their modern\r\ndescendants and neighbours still occupying the pueblos[863].\"\r\n\r\nEach pueblo contains at least one _kiva_, either wholly or partly\r\nunderground, entered by means of a ladder and hatchway, forming a sacred\r\nchamber for the transaction of civil or religious affairs, and also a\r\nclub for the men. In some villages each totemic clan has its own _kiva_.\r\nThe Indians are eminently a religious people and much time is devoted to\r\ncomplicated rites to ensure a supply of rain, their main concern, and\r\nthe growth of crops. Among the Hopi from four to sixteen days in every\r\nmonth are employed by one society or another in the carrying out of\r\nreligious rites. The secret portions of these complicated ceremonies\r\ntake place in the _kiva_, while the so-called \"dances\" are performed in\r\nthe open.\r\n\r\nThe clan ancestors may be impersonated by masked men, called _katcinas_,\r\nthe name being also applied to the religious dramas in which they\r\nappear[864].\r\n\r\nIn reference to J. Walter Fewkes' account of the \"Tusayan Snake\r\nCeremonies,\" it is pointed out that \"the Pueblo Indians adore a\r\nplurality of deities, to which various potencies are ascribed. These\r\nzoic deities, or beast gods, are worshipped by means of ceremonies which\r\nare sometimes highly elaborate; and, so far as practicable, the mystic\r\nzoic potency is represented in the ceremony by a living animal of\r\nsimilar species or by an artificial symbol. Prominent among the animate\r\nrepresentatives of the zoic pantheon throughout the arid region is the\r\nserpent, especially the venomous and hence mysteriously potent\r\nrattlesnake. To the primitive mind there is intimate association, too,\r\nbetween the swift-striking and deadly viper and the lightning, with its\r\nattendant rain and thunder; there is intimate association, too, between\r\nthe moisture-loving reptile of the subdeserts and the life-giving storms\r\nand freshets; and so the native rattlesnake plays an important role in\r\nthe ceremonies, especially in the invocations for rain, which\r\ncharacterize the entire arid region[865].\"\r\n\r\nFewkes pursues the same fruitful line of thought in his monograph on\r\n_The Feather Symbol in Ancient Hopi Designs_[866], showing how amongst\r\nthe Tusayan Pueblos, although they have left no written records, there\r\nsurvives an elaborate paleography, the feather _motif_ in the pottery\r\nfound in the old ruins, which is in fact \"a picture writing often highly\r\nsymbolic and complicated,\" revealing certain phases of Hopi thought in\r\nremote times. \"Thus we come back to a belief, taught by other reasoning,\r\nthat ornamentation of ancient pottery was something higher than simple\r\neffort to beautify ceramic wares. The ruling motive was a religious one,\r\nfor in their system everything was under the same sway. Esthetic and\r\nreligious feelings were not differentiated, the one implied the other,\r\nand to elaborately decorate a vessel without introducing a religious\r\nsymbol was to the ancient potter an impossibility[867].\"\r\n\r\nPhysically the Pueblo Indians are of short stature, with long, low head,\r\ndelicate face and dark skin. They are muscular and of great endurance,\r\nable to carry heavy burdens up steep and difficult trails, and to walk\r\nor even run great distances. It is said to be no uncommon thing for a\r\nHopi to run 40 miles over a burning desert to his cornfield, hoe his\r\ncorn, and return home within 24 hours. Distances of 140 miles are\r\nfrequently made within 36 hours[868]. In disposition they are mild and\r\npeaceable, industrious, and extraordinarily conservative, a trait shown\r\nin the fidelity with which they retain and perpetuate their ancient\r\ncustoms[869]. Labour is more evenly divided than among most Indian\r\ntribes. The men help the women with the heavier work of house-building,\r\nthey collect the fuel, weave blankets and make moccasins, occupations\r\nusually regarded as women's work. The women carry the water, and make\r\nthe pottery for which the region is famous[870].\r\n\r\nA. L. Kroeber has made a careful study of Zuni sociology[871] and come\r\nto the conclusion that the family is fundamental and the clan secondary,\r\nthough kinship terms are applied to clan mates in a random fashion, and\r\neven the true kinship terms are applied loosely. In view of the obvious\r\npreeminence of the woman, who receives the husband into her and her\r\nmother's house, it is worthy of note that she and her children recognise\r\nher husband's relatives as their kin as fully as he adopts hers. The\r\nZuni are not a woman-ruled people. As regards government, women neither\r\nclaim nor have any voice whatever, nor are there women priests, nor\r\nfraternity officers. Even within the house, so long as a man is a\r\nlegitimate inmate thereof, he is master of it and of its affairs. They\r\nare a monogamous people. Divorce is more easy than marriage, and most\r\nmen and women of middle age have been married to several partners.\r\nMarriage in the mother's clan is forbidden; in the father's clan,\r\ndisapproved. The phratries have no social significance, there is no\r\ncentral clan house, no recognised head, no meeting, council or any\r\norganisation, nor does the clan as such ever act as a body. The clans\r\nhave little connection with the religious societies or fraternities.\r\nThere are no totemic tabus nor is there worship of the clan totem.\r\nPeople are reckoned as belonging to the father's clan almost as much as\r\nto that of the mother. If one of the family of a person who belongs to a\r\nfraternity falls sick the fraternity is called in to cure the patient,\r\nwho is subsequently received into its ranks. The Zuni fraternity is\r\nlargely a body of religious physicians, membership is voluntary and not\r\nlimited by sex. At Hopi we hear of rain-making more than of doctoring,\r\nmore of \"priests\" than of \"theurgists.\" The religious functions of the\r\nZuni are most marked in the ceremonies of the Ko-tikkyanne, the\r\n\"god-society\" or \"masked-dancer society,\" and it is with these that the\r\n_kivas_ are associated. They are almost wholly concerned with rain. Only\r\nmen can become members and entrance is compulsory. Kroeber believes that\r\n\"the truest understanding of Zuni life, other than its purely practical\r\nmanifestation, can be had by setting the ettowe ['fetish'] as a centre.\r\nAround these, priesthoods, fraternities, clan organisation, as well as\r\nmost esoteric thinking and sacred tradition, group themselves; while, in\r\nturn, kivas, dances, and acts of public worship can be construed as but\r\nthe outward means of expression of the inner activities that radiate\r\naround the nucleus of the physical fetishes and the ideas attached to\r\nthem[872].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[737] A.

But that the\r\nsystem must have formerly been continuous over the whole of America\r\nseems proved by the persistence of extremely polysynthetic tongues in\r\nsuch widely separated regions as Greenland (Eskimo), Mexico (Aztec),\r\nPeru (Quichuan), and Chili (Araucanian).\r\n\r\n[762] R. de la Grasserie and N.

Thus, although their\r\ncivilisations are concentrated respectively in the Anahuac (Mexican)\r\nplateau and Yucatan and Guatemala, the two domains overlap completely at\r\nboth ends, so that there are isolated branches of the Huaxtecan family\r\nin Mexico (the Huaxtecs (Totonacs) of Vera Cruz, from whom the whole\r\ngroup is named, and of the Nahuatlan in Nicaragua (Pipils, Niquirans,\r\nand others)[873].\r\n\r\nThis very circumstance has no doubt tended to increase the difficulties\r\nconnected with the questions of their origins, migrations, and mutual\r\ncultural influences. Some of these difficulties disappear if the\r\n\"Toltecs\" be eliminated (see p. 342), who had hitherto been a great\r\ndisturbing element in this connection, and all the rest have in my\r\nopinion been satisfactorily disposed of by E. Foerstemann, a leading\r\nauthority on all Aztec-Maya questions[874]. This eminent archaeologist\r\nrefers first to the views of Seler[875], who assumes a southern movement\r\nof Maya tribes from Yucatan, and a like movement of Aztecs from Tabasco\r\nto Nicaragua, and even to Yucatan. On the other hand Dieseldorff holds\r\nthat Maya art was independently developed, while the link between it and\r\nthe Aztec shows that an interchange took place, in which process the\r\nMaya was the giver, the Aztec the recipient. He further attributes the\r\noverthrow of the Maya power 100 or 200 years before the conquest to the\r\nAztecs, and thinks the Aztecs or Nahuas took their god Quetzalcoatl from\r\nthe \"Toltecs,\" who were a Maya people. Ph. J. Valentini also infers that\r\nthe Maya were the original people, the Aztecs \"mere parasites[876].\"\r\n\r\nNow Foerstemann lays down the principle that any theory, to be\r\nsatisfactory, should fit in with such facts as:--(1) the agreement and\r\ndiversity of both cultures; (2) the antiquity and disappearance of the\r\nmysterious Toltecs; (3) the complete isolation at 22 deg. N. lat. of the\r\nHuaxtecs from the other Maya tribes, and their difference from them; (4)\r\nthe equally complete isolation of the Guatemalan Pipils, and of the\r\nother southern (Nicaraguan) Aztec groups from the rest of the Nahua\r\npeoples; (5) the remarkable absence of Aztec local names in Yucatan,\r\nwhile they occur in hundreds in Chiapas, Guatemala, Honduras and\r\nNicaragua, where scarcely any trace is left of Maya names.\r\n\r\nTo account for these facts he assumes that in the earliest known times\r\nCentral America from about 23 deg. to 10 deg. N. was mainly inhabited by Maya\r\ntribes, who had even reached Cuba. While these Mayas were still at quite\r\na low stage of culture, the Aztecs advanced from as far north as at\r\nleast 26 deg. N. but only on the Pacific side, thus leaving the Huaxtecs\r\nalmost untouched in the east. The Aztecs called the Mayas \"Toltecs\"\r\nbecause they first came in contact with one of their northern branches\r\nliving in the region about Tula (north of Mexico city)[877]. But when\r\nall the relations became clearer, the Toltecs fell gradually into the\r\nbackground, and at last entered the domain of the fabulous.\r\n\r\nNow the Aztecs borrowed much from the Mayas, especially gods, whose\r\nnames they simply translated. A typical case is that of Cuculcan, which\r\nbecomes Quetzalcoatl, where _cuc_ = _quezal_ = the bird _Trogon\r\nresplendens_, and _can_ = _coatl_ = snake[878]. With the higher culture\r\ndeveloped in Guatemala the Aztecs came first in contact after passing\r\nthrough Mixtec and Zapotec territory, not long before Columbian times,\r\nso that they had no time here to consolidate their empire and assimilate\r\nthe Mayas. On the contrary the Aztecs were themselves merged in these,\r\nall but the Pipils and the settlements on Lake Nicaragua, which retained\r\ntheir national peculiarities.\r\n\r\nBut whence came the hundreds of Aztec names in the lands between Chiapas\r\nand Nicaragua? Here it should be noted that these names are almost\r\nexclusively confined to the more important stations, while the less\r\nprominent places have everywhere names taken from the tongues of the\r\nlocal tribes. But even the Aztec names themselves occur properly only in\r\nofficial use, hence also on the charts, and are not current to-day\r\namongst the natives who have kept aloof from the Spanish-speaking\r\npopulations. Hence the inference that such names were mainly introduced\r\nby the Spaniards and their Mexican troops during the conquest of those\r\nlands, say, up to about 1535, and do not appear in Yucatan which was not\r\nconquered from Mexico. Foerstemann reluctantly accepts this view,\r\nadvanced by Sapper[879], having nothing better to suggest.\r\n\r\nThe coastal towns of Yucatan visited by Spaniards from Cuba in 1517 and\r\nonwards were decidedly inferior architecturally to the great temple\r\nstructures of the interior, though doubtless erected by the same people.\r\nThe inland cities of Chichen-Itza and Uxmal by that time had fallen from\r\ntheir ancient glory though still religious centres[880].\r\n\r\nThe Maya would thus appear to have stood on a higher plane of culture\r\nthan their Aztec rivals, and the same conclusion may be drawn from\r\ntheir respective writing systems. Of all the aborigines these two alone\r\nhad developed what may fairly be called a script in the strict sense of\r\nthe term, although neither of them had reached the same level of\r\nefficiency as the Babylonian cuneiforms, or the Chinese or the Egyptian\r\nhieroglyphs, not to speak of the syllabic and alphabetic systems of the\r\nOld World. Some even of the barbaric peoples, such as most of the\r\nprairie Indians, had reached the stage of graphic symbolism, and were\r\nthus on the threshold of writing at the discovery. \"The art was\r\nrudimentary and limited to crude pictography. The pictographs were\r\npainted or sculptured on cliff-faces, boulders, the walls of caverns,\r\nand even on trees, as well as on skins, bark, and various artificial\r\nobjects. Among certain Mexican tribes, also, autographic records were in\r\nuse, and some of them were much better differentiated than any within\r\nthe present area of the United States. The records were not only painted\r\nand sculptured on stone and moulded in stucco, but were inscribed in\r\nbooks or codices of native parchment and paper; while the characters\r\nwere measurably arbitrary, _i.e._ ideographic rather than\r\npictographic[881].\"\r\n\r\nThe Aztec writing may be best described as pictographic, the pictures\r\nbeing symbolical or, in the case of names, combined into a rebus. No\r\ndoubt much diversity of opinion prevails as to whether the Maya symbols\r\nare phonetic or ideographic, and it is a fact that no single text,\r\nhowever short, has yet been satisfactorily deciphered. It seems that\r\nmany of the symbols possessed true phonetic value and were used to\r\nexpress sounds and syllables, though it cannot be claimed that the Maya\r\nscribes had reached that advanced stage where they could indicate each\r\nletter sound by a glyph or symbol[882]. According to Cyrus Thomas, a\r\nsymbol was selected because the name or word it represented had as its\r\nchief phonetic element a certain consonant sound or syllable. If this\r\nwere _b_ the symbol would be used where _b_ was the prominent element of\r\nthe word to be indicated, no reference, however, to its original\r\nsignification being necessarily retained. Thus the symbol for _cab_,\r\n'earth,' might be used in writing _Caban_, a day name, or _cabil_,\r\n'honey,' because _cab_ is their chief phonetic element.... One reason\r\nwhy attempts at decipherment have failed is a misconception of the\r\npeculiar character of the writing, which is in a transition stage from\r\nthe purely ideographic to the phonetic[883]. From the example here\r\ngiven, the Maya script would appear to have in part reached the rebus\r\nstage, which also plays so large a part in the Egyptian hieroglyphic\r\nsystem. _Cab_ is obviously a rebus, and the transition from the rebus to\r\ntrue syllabic and alphabetic systems has already been explained[884].\r\nThe German Americanists on the other hand have always regarded Maya\r\nwriting as more ideographic, and H. Beuchat adopts this view, for \"no\r\nsymbol has ever been read phonetically with a different meaning from\r\nthat which it possesses as an ideogram[885].\"\r\n\r\nBut not only were the Maya day characters phonetic; the Maya calendar\r\nitself, afterwards borrowed by the Aztecs, has been described as even\r\nmore accurate than the Julian itself. \"Among the Plains Indians the\r\ncalendars are simple, consisting commonly of a record of winters\r\n('winter counts'), and of notable events occurring either during the\r\nwinter or during some other season; while the shorter time divisions are\r\nreckoned by 'nights' (days), 'dead moons' (lunations), and seasons of\r\nleafing, flowering, or fruiting of plants, migrating of animals, etc.,\r\nand there is no definite system of reducing days to lunations or\r\nlunations to years. Among the Pueblo Indians calendric records are\r\ninconspicuous or absent, though there is a much more definite calendric\r\nsystem which is fixed and perpetuated by religious ceremonies; while\r\namong some of the Mexican tribes there are elaborate calendric systems\r\ncombined with complete calendric records. The perfection of the calendar\r\namong the Maya and Nahua Indians is indicated by the fact that not only\r\nwere 365 days reckoned as a year, but the bissextile was\r\nrecognized[886].\"\r\n\r\nIn another important respect the superiority of the Maya-Quiche peoples\r\nover the northern Nahuans is incontestable. When their religious systems\r\nare compared, it is at once seen that at the time of the discovery the\r\nMexican Aztecs were little better than ruthless barbarians newly clothed\r\nin the borrowed robes of an advanced culture, to which they had not had\r\ntime to adapt themselves properly, and in which they could but\r\nmasquerade after their own savage fashion.\r\n\r\nIt has to be remembered that the Aztecs were but one branch of the\r\nNahuatlan family, whose affinities Buschmann[887] has traced northwards\r\nto the rude Shoshonian aborigines who roamed from the present States of\r\nMontana, Idaho, and Oregon down into Utah, Texas, and California[888].\r\nTo this Nahuatlan stock belonged the barbaric hordes who overthrew the\r\ncivilisation which flourished on the Anahuac (Mexican) table-land about\r\nthe sixth century A.D. and is associated with the ruins of Tula and\r\nCholula. It now seems clear that the so-called \"Toltecs,\" the\r\n\"Pyramid-builders,\" were not Nahuatlans but Huaxtecans, who were\r\nabsorbed by the immigrants or driven southwards.\r\n\r\nTo north and north-west of the settled peoples of the valley lived\r\nnomadic hunting tribes called Chichimec[889], merged in a loose\r\npolitical system which was dignified in the local traditions by the name\r\nof the \"Chichimec Empire.\" The chief part was played by tribes of Nahuan\r\norigin[890], whose ascendancy lasted from about the eleventh to the\r\nfifteenth century, when they were in their turn overthrown and absorbed\r\nby the historical Nahuan confederacy of the _Aztecs_[891] whose capital\r\nwas Tenochtitlan (the present city of Mexico), the _Acolhuas_ (capital\r\nTezcuco), and the _Tepanecs_ (capital Tlacopan).\r\n\r\nThus the Aztec Empire reduced by the Conquistadores in 1520 had but a\r\nbrief record, although the Aztecs themselves as well as many other\r\ntribes of Nahuatl speech, must have been in contact with the more\r\ncivilised Huaxtecan peoples for centuries before the appearance of the\r\nSpaniards on the scene. It was during these ages that the Nahuas\r\n\"borrowed much from the Mayas,\" as Foerstemann puts it, without greatly\r\nbenefiting by the process. Thus the Maya gods, for the most part of a\r\nrelatively mild type like the Maya themselves, become in the hideous\r\nAztec pantheon ferocious demons with an insatiable thirst for blood, so\r\nthat the teocalli, \"god's houses,\" were transformed to human shambles,\r\nwhere on solemn occasions the victims were said to have numbered tens of\r\nthousands[892].\r\n\r\nBesides the Aztecs and their allies, the elevated Mexican plateaus were\r\noccupied by several other relatively civilised nations, such as the\r\n_Miztecs_ and _Zapotecs_ of Oajaca, the _Tarasco_ and neighbouring\r\n_Matlaltzinca_, of Michoacan[893], all of whom spoke independent stock\r\nlanguages, and the _Totonacs_ of Vera Cruz, who were of Huaxtecan\r\nspeech, and were in touch to the north with the Huaxtecs, a primitive\r\nMaya people. The high degree of civilisation attained by some of these\r\nnations before their reduction by the Aztecs is attested by the\r\nmagnificent ruins of Mitla, capital of the Zapotecs, which was captured\r\nand destroyed by the Mexicans in 1494[894]. Of the royal palace\r\nViollet-le-Duc speaks in enthusiastic terms, declaring that \"the\r\nmonuments of the golden age of Greece and Rome alone equal the beauty of\r\nthe masonry of this great building[895].\" In general their usages and\r\nreligious rites resembled those of the Aztecs, although the Zapotecs,\r\nbesides the civil ruler, had a High Priest who took part in the\r\ngovernment. \"His feet were never allowed to touch the ground; he was\r\ncarried on the shoulders of his attendants; and when he appeared all,\r\neven the chiefs themselves, had to fall prostrate before him, and none\r\ndared to raise their eyes in his presence[896].\" The Zapotec language is\r\nstill spoken by about 260 natives in the State of Oajaca.\r\n\r\nFarther north the plains and uplands continued to be inhabited by a\r\nmultitude of wild tribes speaking an unknown number of stock languages,\r\nand thus presenting a chaos of ethnical and linguistic elements\r\ncomparable to that which prevails along the north-west coast. Of these\r\nrude populations one of the most widespread are the Otomi of the central\r\nregion, noted for the monosyllabic tendencies of their language, which\r\nNajera, a native grammarian, has on this ground compared with Chinese,\r\nfrom which, however, it is fundamentally distinct. Still more primitive\r\nare the Seri Indians of Tiburon island in the Gulf of California and the\r\nadjacent mainland, who were visited in 1895 by W. J. McGee, and found to\r\nbe probably more isolated and savage than any other tribe remaining on\r\nthe North American Continent. They hunt, fish, and collect vegetable\r\nfood, and most of their food is eaten raw, they have no domestic animals\r\nsave dogs, they are totally without agriculture, and their industrial\r\narts are few and rude. They use the bow and arrow but have no knife.\r\nTheir houses are flimsy huts. They make pottery and rafts of canes. The\r\nSeri are loosely organised in a number of exogamic, matrilineal, totemic\r\nclans. Mother-right obtains to a greater extent perhaps than in any\r\nother people. At marriage the husband becomes a privileged guest in the\r\nwife's mother's household, and it is only in the chase or on the\r\nwar-path that men take an important place. Polygyny prevails. The most\r\nconspicuous ceremony is the girls' puberty feast. The dead are buried in\r\na contracted position. \"The strongest tribal characteristic is\r\nimplacable animosity towards aliens.... In their estimation the\r\nbrightest virtue is the shedding of alien blood, while the blackest\r\ncrime in their calendar is alien conjugal union[897].\"\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that but few traces of such savagery have yet been\r\ndiscovered in Yucatan. The investigations of Henry Mercer[898] in this\r\nregion lend strong support to Foerstemann's views regarding the early\r\nHuaxtecan migrations and the general southward spread of Maya culture\r\nfrom the Mexican table-land. Nearly thirty caves examined by this\r\nexplorer failed to yield any remains either of the mastodon, mammoth,\r\nand horse, or of early man, elsewhere so often associated with these\r\nanimals. Hence Mercer infers that the Mayas reached Yucatan already in\r\nan advanced state of culture, which remained unchanged till the\r\nconquest. In the caves were found great quantities of good pottery,\r\ngenerally well baked and of symmetrical form, the oldest quite as good\r\nas the latest where they occur in stratified beds, showing no progress\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nThe caves of Loltun (Yucatan) and Copan (Honduras), examined by E. H.\r\nThompson and G. Byron-Gordon, yielded pre-Mayan debris from the deep\r\nstrata. Perhaps this very ancient population was of the same race as the\r\nlittle known tribes still living in the forests of Honduras and San\r\nSalvador[899].\r\n\r\nSince the conquest the Aztecs, and other cultured nations of Anahuac,\r\nhave yielded to European influences to a far greater extent than the\r\nMaya-Quiche of Yucatan and Guatemala. In the city of Mexico the Nahuatl\r\ntongue has almost died out, and this place has long been a leading\r\ncentre of Spanish arts and letters[900]; yet the Mexicans yearly\r\ncelebrate a feast in memory of their great ancestors who died in defence\r\nof their country[901]. But Merida, standing on the site of the ancient\r\nTi-hoo, has almost again become a Maya town, where the white settlers\r\nthemselves have been largely assimilated in speech and usages to the\r\nnatives. The very streets are still indicated by the carved images of\r\nthe hawk, flamingo, or other tutelar deities, while the houses of the\r\nsuburbs continue to be built in the old Maya style, two or three feet\r\nabove the street level, with a walled porch and stone bench running\r\nround the enclosure.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this remarkable contrast may be that the Nahua culture,\r\nas above seen, was to a great extent borrowed in relatively recent\r\ntimes, whereas the Maya civilisation is now shown to date from the epoch\r\nof the Tolan and Cholulan pyramid-builders. Hence the former yielded to\r\nthe first shock, while the latter still persists to some extent in\r\nYucatan. Here about 1000 A.D. the cities of Chichen-Itza, Uxmal and\r\nMayapan formed a confederacy in which each was to share equally in the\r\ngovernment of the country. Under the peaceful conditions of the next two\r\ncenturies followed the second and last great Maya epoch, the Age of\r\nArchitecture, as it has been termed, as opposed to the first epoch, the\r\nAge of Sculpture, from the second to the sixth century A.D. During this\r\nearlier epoch flourished the great cities of the south, Palenque,\r\nQuirigua, Copan, and others[902]. Despite their more gentle\r\ndisposition, as expressed in the softer and almost feminine lines of\r\ntheir features, the Mayas held out more valiantly than the Aztecs\r\nagainst the Spaniards, and a section of the nation occupying a strip of\r\nterritory between Yucatan and British Honduras, still maintains its\r\nindependence. The \"barbarians,\" as the inhabitants of this district are\r\ncalled, would appear to be scarcely less civilised than their\r\nneighbours, although they have forgotten the teachings of the padres,\r\nand transformed the Catholic churches to wayside inns. Even as it is the\r\ndescendants of the Spaniards have to a great extent forgotten their\r\nmother-tongue, and Maya-Quiche dialects are almost everywhere current\r\nexcept in the Campeachy district. Those also who call themselves\r\nCatholics preserve and practise many of the old rites. After burial the\r\ntrack from the grave to the house is carefully chalked, so that the soul\r\nof the departed may know the way back when the time comes to enter the\r\nbody of some new-born babe. The descendants of the national astrologers\r\neverywhere pursue their arts, determining events, forecasting the\r\nharvests and so on by the conjunctions of the stars, and every village\r\nhas its native \"Zadkiel\" who reads the future in the ubiquitous crystal\r\nglobe. Even certain priests continue to celebrate the \"Field Mass,\" at\r\nwhich a cock is sacrificed to the Mayan Aesculapius, with invocations to\r\nthe Trinity and their associates, the four genii of the rain and crops.\r\n\"These tutelar deities, however, have taken Christian names, the Red, or\r\nGod of the East, having become St Dominic; the White, or God of the\r\nNorth, St Gabriel; the Black, or God of the West, St James; and the\r\n'Yellow Goddess' of the South, Mary Magdalene[903].\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the observer passing from the northern to the southern division of\r\nthe New World no marked contrasts are at first perceptible, either in\r\nthe physical appearance, or in the social condition of the aborigines.\r\nThe substantial uniformity, which in these respects prevails from the\r\nArctic to the Austral waters, is in fact well illustrated by the\r\ncomparatively slight differences presented by the primitive populations\r\ndwelling north and south of the Isthmus of Panama.\r\n\r\nAt the discovery the West Indies were inhabited by two distinct\r\npeoples, both apparently of South American origin. The populations of\r\nthe Greater Antilles, Cuba, Jamaica, Santo Domingo and Porto Rico were\r\nof Arawak stock, as were also the Lucayans of the Bahamas. The Lesser\r\nAntilles were peopled by Caribs, whose culture had been somewhat\r\nmodified by the Arawaks who had preceded them. As regards influences\r\nfrom the north-west and west, Joyce considers that intercourse between\r\nYucatan and Western Cuba was confined to occasional trading voyages and\r\ndid not long antedate the arrival of the Spaniards. The same applies to\r\nFlorida where, however, Antillean influences may be traced, especially\r\nin pottery designs[904]. According to Beuchat, however, the Guacanabibes\r\nof Cuba are of common origin with the Tekestas of Florida. Other tribes\r\nfrom Florida spread to the Bahamas, Cuba[905], and perhaps Hayti, but\r\nwere checked by Arawaks from South America who mastered the whole of the\r\nWest Indies. Last came the more vigorous but less advanced Caribs, also\r\nfrom the southern mainland (of Arawak origin according to Joyce and\r\nBeuchat). The statement of Columbus that the Lucayans[906] were \"of good\r\nsize, with large eyes and broader foreheads than he had ever seen in any\r\nother race of men\" is fully borne out by the character of some old\r\nskulls from the Bahamas measured by W. K. Brooks, who regarded them as\r\nbelonging to \"a well-marked type of the North American Indian race which\r\nwas at that time distributed over the Bahama Islands, Hayti, and the\r\ngreater part of Cuba. As these islands are only a few miles from the\r\npeninsula of Florida, this race must at some time have inhabited at\r\nleast the south-eastern extremity of the continent, and it is therefore\r\nextremely interesting to note that the North American crania which\r\nexhibit the closest resemblance to those from the Bahama Islands have\r\nbeen obtained from Florida[907].\" This observer dwells on the solidity\r\nand massiveness of the Lucayan skulls, which bring them into direct\r\nrelation with the races both of the Mississippi plains and of the\r\nBrazilian and Venezuelan coast-lands, though the general ethnography of\r\nPanama and Costa Rica reveals no active influence exerted by tribes of\r\nColombia and Venezuela, except in eastern Panama[908].\r\n\r\nEqually close is the connection established between the surviving\r\nIsthmian and Colombian peoples of the Atrato and Magdalena basins. The\r\nChontal of Nicaragua are scarcely to be distinguished from some of the\r\nSanta Marta hillmen, while the Choco and perhaps the Cuna of Panama have\r\nbeen affiliated to the Choco of the Atrato and San Juan rivers. The\r\ncultural connection between the tribes of the Isthmus and of Colombia\r\nappears especially in the gold-work and pottery of the Chiriqui; at the\r\nChiriqui Lagoon, however, Nahuan influence is perceptible[909].\r\nAttempts, which however can hardly be regarded as successful, have even\r\nbeen made to establish linguistic relations between the Costa Rican\r\nGuatuso and the Timote of the Merida uplands of Venezuela, who are\r\nthemselves a branch of the formerly widespread Muyscan family.\r\n\r\nBut with these Muyscans we at once enter a new ethnical and cultural\r\ndomain, in which may be studied the resemblances due to the common\r\norigin of all the American aborigines, and the divergences due obviously\r\nto long isolation and independent local developments in the two\r\ncontinental divisions. In general the southern populations present more\r\nviolent contrasts than the northern in their social and intellectual\r\ndevelopments, so that while the wild tribes touch a lower depth of\r\nsavagery, some at least of the civilised peoples rise to a higher degree\r\nof excellence, if not in letters--where the inferiority is\r\nmanifest--certainly in the arts of engineering, architecture,\r\nagriculture, and political organisation. Thus we need not travel many\r\nmiles inland from the Isthmus without meeting the Catio, a wild tribe\r\nbetween the Atrato and the Cauca, more degraded even than the Seri of\r\nTiburon island, most debased of all North American hordes. These Catio,\r\na now nearly extinct branch of the Choco stock, were said to dwell like\r\nthe anthropoid apes, in the branches of trees; they mostly went naked,\r\nand were reported, like the Mangbattus and other Congo negroes, to\r\n\"fatten their captives for the table.\" Their Darien neighbours of the\r\nNore valley, who gave an alternative name to the Panama peninsula, were\r\naccustomed to steal the women of hostile tribes, cohabit with them, and\r\ncarefully bring up the children till their fourteenth year, when they\r\nwere eaten with much rejoicing, the mothers ultimately sharing the same\r\nfate[910]; and the Cocoma of the Maranon \"were in the habit of eating\r\ntheir own dead relations, and grinding their bones to drink in their\r\nfermented liquor. They said it was better to be inside a friend than to\r\nbe swallowed up by the cold earth[911].\" In fact of the Colombian\r\naborigines Herrera tells us that \"the living are the grave of the dead;\r\nfor the husband has been seen to eat his wife, the brother his brother\r\nor sister, the son his father; captives also are eaten roasted[912].\"\r\n\r\nThus is raised the question of cannibalism in the New World, where at\r\nthe discovery it was incomparably more prevalent south than north of the\r\nequator. Compare the Eskimo and the Fuegians at the two extremes, the\r\nformer practically exonerated of the charge, and in distress sparing\r\nwives and children and eating their dogs; the latter sparing their dogs\r\nbecause useful for catching otters, and smoking and eating their old\r\nwomen because useless for further purposes[913]. In the north the taste\r\nfor human flesh had declined, and the practice survived only as a\r\nceremonial rite, chiefly amongst the British Columbians and the Aztecs,\r\nexcept of course in case of famine, when even the highest races are\r\ncapable of devouring their fellows. But in the south cannibalism in some\r\nof its most repulsive forms was common enough almost everywhere. Killing\r\nand eating feeble and aged members of the tribe in kindness is still\r\ngeneral; but the Mayorunas of the Upper Amazon waters do not wait till\r\nthey have grown lean with years or wasted with disease[914]; and it was\r\na baptized member of the same tribe who complained on his death-bed that\r\nhe would not now provide a meal for his Christian friends, but must be\r\ndevoured by worms[915].\r\n\r\nIn the southern continent the social conditions illustrated by these\r\npractices prevailed everywhere, except on the elevated plateaus of the\r\nwestern Cordilleras, which for many ages before the discovery had been\r\nthe seats of several successive cultures, in some respects rivalling,\r\nbut in others much inferior to those of Central America. When the\r\nConquistadores reached this part of the New World, to which they were\r\nattracted by the not altogether groundless reports of fabulous wealth\r\nembodied in the legend of _El Dorado_, the \"Man of Gold,\" they found it\r\noccupied by a cultural zone which extended almost continuously from the\r\npresent republic of Colombia through Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia right\r\ninto Chili. In the north the dominant people were the semi-civilised\r\nChibcha, already mentioned under the name of Muysca[916], who had\r\ndeveloped an organised system of government on the Bogota table-land,\r\nand had succeeded in extending their somewhat more refined social\r\ninstitutions to some of the other aborigines of Colombia, though not to\r\nmany of the outlying members of their own race. As in Mexico many of the\r\nNahuatlan tribes remained little better than savages to the last, so in\r\nColombia the civilised Muyscans were surrounded by numerous kindred\r\ntribes--Coyaima, Natagaima, Tocaima and others, collectively known as\r\nPanches--who were real savages with scarcely any tribal organisation,\r\nwearing no clothes, and according to the early accounts still addicted\r\nto cannibalism.\r\n\r\nThe Muysca proper had a tradition that they owed their superiority to\r\ntheir culture-hero Bochica, who came from the east long ago, taught them\r\neverything, and was then placed with Chiminigagua, the creator, at the\r\nhead of their pantheon, and worshipped with solemn rites and even human\r\nsacrifices. Amongst the arts thus acquired was that of the goldsmith, in\r\nwhich they surpassed all other peoples of the New World. The precious\r\nmetal was even said to be minted in the shape of discs, which formed an\r\nalmost solitary instance of a true metal currency amongst the American\r\naborigines[917]. Brooches, pendants, and especially grotesque figurines\r\nof gold, often alloyed with silver and copper, have been found in great\r\nnumbers and still occasionally turn up on the plateau. These finds are\r\npartly accounted for by the practice of offering such objects in the\r\nopen air to the personified constellations and forces of nature, for the\r\nprimitive religion of all the Andean tribes consisted of nature-, in\r\nparticular sun-cults. Near Bogota was a temple of the Sun, where\r\nchildren were reared for sacrifice[918]. Any mysterious sound emanating\r\nfrom a forest, a rock, a mountain pass, or gloomy gorge, was accepted as\r\na manifestation of some divine presence; a shrine was raised to the\r\nembodied spirit, and so the whole land became literally crowded with\r\nlocal deities. This world itself was upborne on the shoulders of\r\nChibchacum, a national Atlas, who now and then eased himself by shifting\r\nthe burden, and thus caused earthquakes. In most lands subject to\r\nunderground disturbances analogous ideas prevail, and when their source\r\nis so obvious, it seems unreasonable to seek for explanations in racial\r\naffinities, contacts, foreign influences, and so forth.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked that at the advent of the whites the native\r\ncivilisations seemed generally stricken as if by the hand of death, so\r\nthat even if not suddenly arrested by the intruders they must sooner or\r\nlater have perished of themselves. Such speculations are seldom\r\nconvincing, because we never know what recuperative forces may be at\r\nwork to ward off the evil day. When the Spaniards arrived in Colombia\r\nthey found at one end of the scale naked and savage cannibals, at the\r\nother a people with a feudal form of government, whose political system\r\nwas progressive, who, though possessing no form of writing, had a system\r\nof measures and a calendar, and who were skilled in the arts of weaving,\r\npottery, and metallurgy[919]. The chiefs of the Chibcha were all\r\nabsolute monarchs and the appointment of priests rested with them.\r\nSuccession to the chieftainship was matrilineal, and installation in the\r\noffice was attended by much ceremony. A great gulf separated nobles and\r\ncommoners; slavery existed as an institution but slaves were well\r\ntreated. Polygyny was permitted, but relatives within certain degrees\r\nmight not marry[920]. This feebly organised political system broke to\r\npieces at the first shock from without, and so disheartened had the\r\npeople become under their half theocratic rulers, that they scarcely\r\nraised a hand in defence of a government which in their minds was\r\nassociated only with tyranny and oppression. The conquest was in any\r\ncase facilitated by the civil war at the time raging between the\r\nnorthern and southern kingdoms which with several other semi-independent\r\nstates constituted the Muyscan empire. This empire was almost\r\nconterminous southwards with that of the Incas. At least the numerous\r\nterms occurring in the dialects of the Paes, Coconucos, and other South\r\nColombian tribes, show that Peruvian influences had spread beyond the\r\npolitical frontiers far to the north, without, however, quite reaching\r\nthe confines of the Muyscan domain.\r\n\r\nBut for several centuries prior to the discovery the sway of the\r\nPeruvian Incas had been established throughout nearly the whole of the\r\nAndean lands, and the territory directly ruled by them extended from the\r\nQuito district about the equator for some 2500 miles southwards to the\r\nRio Maule in Chili, with an average breadth of 400 miles between the\r\nPacific and the eastern slopes of the Cordilleras. Their dominion thus\r\ncomprised a considerable part of the present republics of Ecuador, Peru,\r\nBolivia, Chili, and Argentina, with a roughly estimated area of\r\n1,000,000 square miles, and a population of over 10,000,000. Here the\r\nruling race were the Quichua, whose speech, called by themselves\r\n_ruma-simi_, \"the language of men,\" is still current in several\r\nwell-marked dialects throughout all the provinces of the old empire. In\r\nLima and all the seaports and inland towns Spanish prevails, but in the\r\nrural districts Quichuan remains the mother-tongue of over 2,000,000\r\nnatives, and has even become the _lingua franca_ of the western regions,\r\njust as Tupi-Guarani is the _lingoa geral_, \"general language,\" of the\r\neastern section of South America. The attempts to find affinities with\r\nAryan (especially Sanskrit), and other linguistic families of the\r\neastern hemisphere, have broken down before the application of sound\r\nphilological principles to these studies, and Quichuan is now recognised\r\nas a stock language of the usual American type, unconnected with any\r\nother except that of the Bolivian Aymaras. Even this connection is\r\nregarded by some students as verbal rather than structural, an\r\ninterchange of a considerable number of terms being easily explained by\r\nthe close contact in which the two peoples have long dwelt.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of the Incas we cannot do better than follow the views\r\nof Sir Clements Markham, who has made a careful study of the various\r\nearly authorities. His account (_The Incas of Peru,_ 1910) is based\r\nlargely on the works of Spanish military writers such as Ciezo de Leon\r\nand Pedro Pizarro (cousin of the conqueror), of priests like Molina,\r\nMontesinos, and the half-breed Blas Valera, and on those of the Inca\r\nGarcilasso de la Vega, son of a Spanish knight and an Inca princess. The\r\nmegalithic ruins of Tiahuanacu, at the southern end of Lake Titicaca,\r\nmark the earliest known centre of culture in southern Peru. They are\r\nsituated on a lofty plateau, over 13,000 feet above the sea, and are the\r\nremains of a great city built by highly skilled masons who used enormous\r\nstones. The placing of such monoliths, unrivalled except by those of\r\nancient Egypt, indicates a dense and well-organised population. The\r\nfamous monolithic doorway is elaborately carved, the central figure\r\napparently representing the deity, while on either side are figures,\r\nhuman- or bird-headed, kneeling in adoration (_op. cit._, pls. at pp.\r\n26, 28). Now it seems probable that the builders of this megalithic city\r\nwere the ancestors of the Incas, assuming that a substratum of truth\r\nunderlies the Paccari-tampu myth.\r\n\r\nThe end of the early civilisation is stated to have been caused by a\r\ngreat invasion from the south, when the king was killed in a battle in\r\nthe Collao, north of Lake Titicaca. A state of barbarism ensued. A\r\nremnant of the royal house took refuge in a district called Tampu-Tocco\r\n(\"Window Tavern\")[921] and there preserved a vestige of their ancient\r\ntraditions and civilisation. Elsewhere religion deteriorated to nature\r\nworship, here the kings declared themselves to be children of the sun.\r\nMontesinos' list of kings gives 27 names for this period of Tampu-Tocco,\r\nwhich may cover 650 years.\r\n\r\nThe myth, which is \"certainly the outcome of a real tradition, ... the\r\nfabulous version of a distant historical event,\" tells how Manco Ccapac\r\nand the three other Ayars, his brothers, the children of the sun, came\r\nforth with their wives from the central opening or window in the hill\r\nTampu-Tocco. They advanced slowly at the head of several _ayllus_\r\n(lineages). Ayar Manco took the lead, and he had with him a falcon-like\r\nbird revered as sacred, and a golden staff which he flung ahead; when it\r\nreached soil so fertile that the whole length sank in, there the final\r\nhalt was to be made. This happened in the fertile vale of Cuzco. The\r\ndate of these events would be about four centuries before the Spanish\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nFarther north at about 15 deg. S. lat. the Inca civilisation was preceded,\r\naccording to Uhle, by the very ancient one of Ica and Nazca, where dwelt\r\na people who made pottery but were ignorant of weaving. The same\r\nauthority has also discovered about Lima the remains of a tall people,\r\nwho made rude pottery, nets, and objects of bone[922].\r\n\r\nManco established himself in the Cuzco valley, his third successor\r\nfinally subjugating the tribes there. The early position of the Incas,\r\ncemented by judicious marriages, seems to have been one of priority in a\r\nvery loose confederacy. The rise of the Incas was due to the ambition of\r\nthe lady Siuyacu whose son, Inca Rocca, appears to have been the pioneer\r\nof empire; material prosperity began under him, schools were erected and\r\nirrigation works begun. Then from a strip of land 250 miles long between\r\nthe gorge of the Apurimac and the wide fertile valley of Vilcamayu, the\r\nempire was extended to form the Ttahua-ntin-suyu, \"the four provinces,\"\r\nof which the northern one, Chinchay-suyu, reached to Quito, and the\r\nsouthern, Colla-suyu, into Chili. This southward extension was due to\r\nthe efforts of Pachacuti who succeeded after hard fighting in annexing\r\nthe region around Lake Titicaca, and the new territory was named after\r\nthe Collas, the largest and most powerful tribe thereabouts. In order to\r\npacify the region permanently large numbers of Collas were sent as\r\n_mitimaes_, or colonists, as far as the borders of Quito, while their\r\nplaces were filled by loyal colonists from Inca districts. Among these\r\nwere a number of Aymaras from the Quichuan region of the Pachachaca, a\r\nleft bank tributary of the Apurimac, who were settled among the\r\nremaining Lupacas on the west shore of Lake Titicaca at Juli. Thither\r\ncame Jesuit fathers in 1572 and learnt the language of the Lupacas from\r\nthese Aymara colonists, who had been there three generations; the name\r\nAymara was given by the priests not only to the Lupaca language but to\r\nthose spoken by Collas and other Titicacan tribes. Thus the name Aymara\r\nis now generally but quite erroneously applied to the language and\r\npeople of this region; it was first so used in 1575. It must be pointed\r\nout, however, that other authorities regard the Aymara and Quichua as\r\nentirely distinct. A. Chervin[923] discusses the physical differences at\r\ngreat length and concludes that they are two separate brachycephalic\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvians were primarily agriculturists, maize and at higher\r\naltitudes the potato being their chief crops. Their aqueducts and\r\nirrigation systems moved the admiration of early chroniclers, as did\r\nalso their roads and suspension bridges[924]. The supreme deity and\r\ncreator was Uira-cocha, who was worshipped by the more intellectual and\r\nhad a temple at Cuzco. The popular religion was the worship of the\r\nfounder of each _ayllu_, or clan, and all joined in adoration of the sun\r\nas ancestor of the sovereign Incas. Sun-worship was attended by a\r\nmagnificent ritual, the high priest was an official of highest rank,\r\noften a brother of the sovereign, and there were over 3000 Virgins of\r\nthe Sun (_aclla_) connected with the cult at Cuzco. The peasants put\r\ntheir trust in _conopas_, or household gods, which controlled their\r\ncrops and their llamas. The calendar had been calculated with\r\nconsiderable ingenuity, and certain festivals took place annually and\r\nwere usually accompanied with much chicha-drinking. It is remarkable\r\nthat so advanced a people kept all their elaborate records by means of\r\n_quipus_ (coloured strings with knots).\r\n\r\nHere is not the place to enter into the details of the astonishing\r\narchitectural, engineering, and artistic remains, often assigned to the\r\nIncas, whose empire had absorbed in the north the old civilisation of\r\nthe _Chimu_, perhaps of the _Atacameno_, and other cultured peoples\r\nwhose very names have perished. The Yunga (Mochica or Chimu), conquered\r\nby the Inca Tupac Yupanqui, had a language radically distinct from\r\nQuichuan, but have long been assimilated to their conquerors.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Grand Chimu (modern Trujillo) cover a vast area, nearly 15\r\nmiles by 6, which is everywhere strewn with the remains of palaces,\r\nreservoirs, aqueducts, ramparts, and especially _huacas_, that is,\r\ntruncated pyramids not unlike those of Mexico, whence the theory that\r\nthe Chimus, of unknown origin, were \"Toltecs\" from Central America. One\r\nof these huacas is described by Squier as 150 feet high with a base 580\r\nfeet square, and an area of 8 acres, presenting from a distance the\r\nappearance of a huge crater[925]. Still larger is the so-called \"Temple\r\nof the Sun,\" 800 by 470 feet, 200 feet high, and covering an area of 7\r\nacres. An immense population of hundreds of thousands was assigned to\r\nthis place in pre-Inca times; but from some rough surveys made in 1897\r\nit would appear that much of the space within the enclosures consists of\r\nwaste lands, which had never been built over, and it is calculated that\r\nat no time could the number of inhabitants have greatly exceeded 50,000.\r\n\r\nWe need not stop to describe the peculiar civil and social institutions\r\nof the Peruvians, which are of common knowledge. Enough to say that here\r\neverything was planned in the interests of the theocratic and\r\nall-powerful Incas, who were more than obeyed, almost honoured with\r\ndivine worship by their much bethralled and priest-ridden subjects. \"The\r\ndespotic authority of the Incas was the basis of government; that\r\nauthority was founded on the religious respect yielded to the descendant\r\nof the sun, and supported by a skilfully combined hierarchy[926].\" From\r\nremote antiquity the peoples of this area were organised into _ayllus_\r\neach occupying part of a valley or a limited area. It was a patriarchal\r\nsystem, land belonging to the _ayllu_, which was a group of families.\r\nThe Incas systematised this institution, the _ayllu_ was made to\r\ncomprise 100 families under a village officer who annually allotted land\r\nto the heads of families. Each family was divided by the head into 10\r\nclasses based on age. Ten _ayllus_ (now termed _pachacas_) formed a\r\n_huaranca_. A valley with a varying number of _huarancas_ was termed a\r\n_hunu_; over four _hunus_ there was an imperial officer. \"This was\r\nindeed Socialism,\" Markham observes, \"existing under an inexorable\r\ndespotism\" (p. 169).\r\n\r\nBeyond the Maule, southernmost limits of all these effete civilisations,\r\nman reasserted himself in the \"South American Iroquois,\" as those\r\nChilian aborigines have been called who called themselves _Molu-che_,\r\n\"Warriors,\" but are better known by their Quichuan designation of\r\n_Aucaes_, \"Rebels,\" whence the Spanish Aucans (Araucan, Araucanian).\r\nThese \"Rebels,\" who have never hitherto been overcome by the arms of any\r\npeople, and whose heroic deeds in the long wars waged by the white\r\nintruders against their freedom form the topic of a noble Spanish epic\r\npoem[927], still maintain a measure of national autonomy as the friends\r\nand faithful allies of the Chilian republic. Individual freedom and\r\nequality were leading features of the social system which was in the\r\nmain patriarchal. The Araucanians were led by four independent chiefs,\r\neach supported by five _ulmen_, or district chiefs, whose office was\r\nhereditary but whose authority was little more than nominal. It was only\r\nin time of national warfare that the tribes united under a\r\nwar-chief[928]. Not only are all the tribes absolutely free, but the\r\nsame is true of every clan, sept, and family group. Needless to say,\r\nthere are no slaves or serfs. \"The law of retaliation was the only one\r\nunderstood, although the commercial spirit of the Araucano led him to\r\nforego personal revenge for its accruing profit. Thus every injury had\r\nits price[929].\"\r\n\r\nThe basis of their belief is a rude form of nature worship, the\r\nprincipal deities being malignant and requiring propitiation. The chief\r\ngod was Pillan, the thunder god. Spirits of the dead go west over the\r\nsea to a place of abundance where no evil spirits have entry[930]. And\r\nthis simple belief is almost the only substitute for the rewards and\r\npunishments which supply the motive for the observance of an artificial\r\nethical code in so many more developed religious systems.\r\n\r\nIn the sonorous Araucanian language, which is still spoken by about\r\n40,000 full-blood natives, the term _che_, meaning \"people,\" occurs as\r\nthe postfix of several ethnical groups, which, however, are not tribal\r\nbut purely territorial divisions. Thus, while _Molu-che_ is the\r\ncollective name of the whole nation, the _Picun-che_, _Huilli-che_, and\r\n_Puel-che_ are simply the North, South, and East men respectively. The\r\nCentral and most numerous division are the _Puen-che_, that is, people\r\nof the pine district, who are both the most typical and most intelligent\r\nof all the Araucanian family. Ehrenreich's remark that many of the\r\nAmerican aborigines resemble Europeans as much as or even more than the\r\nAsiatic Mongols, is certainly borne out by the facial expression of\r\nthese Puenche. The resemblance is even extended to the mental\r\ncharacters, as reflected in their oral literature. Amongst the specimens\r\nof the national folklore preserved in the Puenche dialect and edited\r\nwith Spanish translations by Rodolfo Lenz[931], is the story of a\r\ndeparted lover, who returns from the other world to demand his betrothed\r\nand carries her off to his grave. Although this might seem an adaptation\r\nof Buerger's \"Lenore,\" Lenz is of opinion that it is a genuine Araucanian\r\nlegend.\r\n\r\nOf the above-mentioned groups the Puelche are now included politically\r\nin Argentina. Their original home seems to have been north of the Rio\r\nNegro, but they raided westwards and some adopted the Araucanian\r\nlanguage[932] and to them also the Chilian affix _che_ has also been\r\nextended. Indeed the term Puelche, meaning simply \"Easterns,\" is applied\r\nnot only to the Argentine Moluche, whose territory stretches east of the\r\nCordilleras as far as Mendoza in Cuyo, but also to all the aborigines\r\ncommonly called _Pampeans_ (_Pampas Indians_) by the Europeans and\r\n_Penek_ by the Patagonians. Under the designation of Puelche would\r\ntherefore be comprised the now extinct _Ranqualche_ (Ranqueles), who\r\nformerly raided up to Buenos-Ayres and the other Spanish settlements on\r\nthe Plate River, the _Mapoche_ of the Lower Salado, and generally all\r\nthe nomads as far south as the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nThese aborigines are now best represented by the _Gauchos_, who are\r\nmostly Spaniards on the father's side and Indians on the mother's, and\r\nreflect this double descent in their half-nomadic, half-civilised life.\r\nThese Gauchos, who are now also disappearing before the encroachments\r\nof the \"Gringos[933],\" _i.e._ the white immigrants from almost every\r\ncountry in Europe, have been enveloped in an ill-deserved halo of\r\nromance, thanks mainly to their roving habits, splendid horsemanship,\r\nlove of finery, and genial disposition combined with that innate grace\r\nand courtesy which belongs to all of Spanish blood. But those who knew\r\nthem best described them as of sordid nature, cruel to their women-kind,\r\nreckless gamblers and libertines, ruthless political partisans, at times\r\neven religious fanatics without a spark of true religion, and at heart\r\nlittle better than bloodthirsty savages.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Rio Negro follow the gigantic Patagonians, that is, the\r\n_Tehuelche_ or _Chuelche_ of the Araucanians, who have no true\r\ncollective name unless it be _Tsoneca_, a word of uncertain use and\r\norigin. Most of the tribal groups--_Yacana_, _Pilma_, _Chao_ and\r\nothers--are broken up, and the former division between the Northern\r\nTehuelche (Tehuelhet), comprising the _Callilehet_ (Serranos or\r\nHighlanders) of the Upper Chupat, with the Calilan between the Rios\r\nChupat and Negro, and the Southern Tehuelche (Yacana, Sehuan, etc.),\r\nsouth to Fuegia, no longer holds good since the general displacement of\r\nall these fluctuating nomad hordes. A branch of the Tehuelche are\r\nunquestionably the _Ona_ of the eastern parts of Fuegia, the true\r\naborigines of which are the _Yahgans_ of the central and the _Alakalufs_\r\nof the western islands.\r\n\r\nHitherto to the question whence came these tall Patagonians, no answer\r\ncould be given beyond the suggestion that they may have been specialised\r\nin their present habitat, where nevertheless they seem to be obviously\r\nintruders. Now, however, one may perhaps venture to look for their\r\noriginal home amongst the _Bororo_ of Matto Grosso, a once powerful race\r\nwho held the region between the Rios Cuyaba and Paraguay. These Bororo,\r\nwho had been heard of by Martius, were visited by Ehrenreich[934] and by\r\nKarl von den Steinen[935], who found them to be a nomadic hunting people\r\nwith a remarkable social organisation centring in the men's club-house\r\n(_baito_). Their physical characters, as described by the former\r\nobserver, correspond closely with those of the Patagonians: \"An\r\nexceptionally tall race rivalling the South Sea Islanders, Patagonians,\r\nand Redskins; by far the tallest Indians hitherto discovered within the\r\ntropics,\" their stature ranging nearly up to 6 ft. 4 in., with very\r\nlarge and rounded heads (men 81.2; women 77.4). With this should be\r\ncompared the very large round old Patagonian skull from the Rio Negro,\r\nmeasured by Rudolf Martin[936]. The account reads like the description\r\nof some forerunner of a prehistoric Bororo irruption into the Patagonian\r\nsteppe lands.\r\n\r\nTo the perplexing use of the term Puelche above referred to is perhaps\r\ndue the difference of opinion still prevailing on the number of stock\r\nlanguages in this southern section of the Continent. D'Orbigny's\r\nemphatic statement[937] that the Puelche spoke a language fundamentally\r\ndistinct both from the Araucanian and the Patagonian has been questioned\r\non the strength of some Puelche words, which were collected by Hale at\r\nCarmen on the Rio Negro, and differ but slightly from Patagonian. But\r\nthe Rio Negro lies on the ethnical divide between the two races, which\r\nsufficiently accounts for the resemblances, while the words are too few\r\nto prove anything. Hale calls them \"Southern Puelche,\" but they were in\r\nfact Tehuelche (Patagonian), the true Pampean Puelche having disappeared\r\nfrom that region before Hale's time[938]. I have now the unimpeachable\r\nauthority of T. P. Schmid, for many years a missionary amongst these\r\naborigines, for asserting that d'Orbigny's statement is absolutely\r\ncorrect. His Puelche were the Pampeans, because he locates them in the\r\nregion between the Rios Negro and Colorado, that is, north of Patagonian\r\nand east of Araucanian territory, and Schmid assures me that all\r\nthree--Araucanian, Pampean, and Patagonian--are undoubtedly stock\r\nlanguages, distinct both in their vocabulary and structure, with nothing\r\nin common except their common polysynthetic form. In a list of 2000\r\nPatagonian and Araucanian words he found only two alike, _patac_ = 100,\r\nand _huarunc_ = 1000, numerals obviously borrowed by the rude Tehuelche\r\nfrom the more cultured Moluche. In Fuegia there is at least one\r\nradically distinct tongue, the Yahgan, studied by Bridges. Here the Ona\r\nis probably a Patagonian dialect, and Alakaluf perhaps remotely allied\r\nto Araucanian. Thus in the whole region south of the Plate River the\r\nstock languages are not known to exceed four: Araucanian; Pampean\r\n(Puelche); Patagonian (Tehuelche); and Yahgan.\r\n\r\nFew aboriginal peoples have been the subject of more glaringly\r\ndiscrepant statements than the Yahgans, to whom several lengthy\r\nmonographs have been devoted during the last few decades. How\r\ncontradictory are the statements of intelligent and even trained\r\nobservers, whose good faith is beyond suspicion and who have no cause to\r\nserve except the truth, will best be seen by placing in juxtaposition\r\nthe accounts of the family relations by G. Bove, a well-known Italian\r\nobserver, and P. Hyades of the French Cape Horn Expedition, both\r\nsummarised[939]:--\r\n\r\n    _Bove._\r\n\r\n    The women are treated as slaves. The greater the number of wives or\r\n    slaves a man has the easier he finds a living; hence polygamy is\r\n    deep-rooted and four wives common. Owing to rigid climate and bad\r\n    treatment the mortality of children under 10 years is excessive; the\r\n    mother's love lasts till the child is weaned, after which it rapidly\r\n    wanes, and is completely gone when the child attains the age of 7 or\r\n    8 years. The Fuegian's only lasting love is the love of self. As\r\n    there are no family ties, the word \"authority\" is devoid of meaning.\r\n\r\n    _Hyades._\r\n\r\n    The Fuegians are capable of great love which accounts for the\r\n    jealousy of the men over their wives and the coquetry sometimes\r\n    manifested by the women and girls.\r\n\r\n    Some men have two or more wives, but monogamy is the rule.\r\n\r\n    Children are tenderly cared for by their parents, who in return are\r\n    treated by them with affection and deference.\r\n\r\n    The Fuegians are of a generous disposition and like to share their\r\n    pleasures with others. The husbands exercise due control, and punish\r\n    severely any act of infidelity.\r\n\r\nThese seeming contradictions may be partly explained by the general\r\nimprovement in manners due to the beneficent action of the English\r\nmissionaries in recent years, and great progress has certainly been made\r\nsince the accounts of King, Fitz-Roy and Darwin[940].\r\n\r\nBut even in the more favoured regions of the Parana and Amazon basins\r\nmany tribes are met which yield little if at all to the Fuegians of the\r\nearly writers in sheer savagery and debasement. Thus the _Cashibo_ or\r\n_Carapache_ of the Ucayali, who are described as \"white as Germans, with\r\nlong beards[941],\" may be said to answer almost better than any other\r\nhuman group to the old saying, _homo homini lupus_. They roam the\r\nforests like wild beasts, living almost entirely upon game, in which is\r\nincluded man himself. \"When one of them is pursuing the chase in the\r\nwoods and hears another hunter imitating the cry of an animal, he\r\nimmediately makes the same cry to entice him nearer, and, if he is of\r\nanother tribe, he kills him if he can, and (as is alleged) eats him.\"\r\nHence they are naturally \"in a state of hostility with all their\r\nneighbours[942].\"\r\n\r\nThese Cashibo, _i.e._ \"Bats,\" are members of a widespread linguistic\r\nfamily which in ethnological writings bears the name of _Pano_, from the\r\nPano of the Huallaga and Maranon, who are now broken up or greatly\r\nreduced, but whose language is current amongst the Cashibo, the Conibo,\r\nthe Karipuna, the Setebo, the Sipivio (Shipibo) and others about the\r\nhead waters of the Amazons in Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil, as far east as\r\nthe Madeira. Amongst these, as amongst the Moxo and so many other\r\nriverine tribes in Amazonia, a slow transformation is in progress. Some\r\nhave been baptized, and while still occupying their old haunts and\r\nkeeping up the tribal organisation, have been induced to forego their\r\nsavage ways and turn to peaceful pursuits. They are beginning to wear\r\nclothes, usually cotton robes of some vivid colour, to till the soil,\r\ntake service with the white traders, or even trade themselves in their\r\ncanoes up and down the tributaries of the Amazons. Beyond the Rubber\r\nBelt, however, many tribes are quite untouched by outside influences.\r\nThe cannibal Boro and Witoto, living between the Issa and Japura, are\r\nignorant of any method of producing fire, and their women go entirely\r\nnude, though some of their arts and crafts exhibit considerable skill,\r\nnotably the plaitwork and blow-pipes of the Boro[943].\r\n\r\nIn this boundless Amazonian region of moist sunless woodlands fringed\r\nnorth and east by Atlantic coast ranges, diversified by the open\r\nVenezuelan llanos, and merging southwards in the vast alluvial plains\r\nof the Parana-Paraguay basin, much light has been brought to bear on the\r\nobscure ethnical relations by the recent explorations especially of Paul\r\nEhrenreich and Karl von den Steinen about the Xingu, Purus, Madeira and\r\nother southern affluents of the great artery[944]. These observers\r\ncomprise the countless Brazilian aborigines in four main linguistic\r\ndivisions, which in conformity with Powell's terminology may here be\r\nnamed the CARIBAN, ARAWAKAN, GESAN and TUPI-GUARANIAN families. There\r\nremain, however, numerous groups which cannot be so classified, such as\r\nthe Bororo and Karaya of Matto Grosso, while in the relatively small\r\narea between the Japura and the Waupes Koch-Gruenberg found two other\r\nlanguage groups, Betoya and Maku in addition to Carib and Arawak[945].\r\n\r\nHitherto the Caribs were commonly supposed to have had their original\r\nhomes far to the north, possibly in the Alleghany uplands, or in\r\nFlorida, where they have been doubtfully identified with the extinct\r\nTimuquanans, and whence they spread through the Antilles southwards to\r\nVenezuela, the Guianas, and north-east Brazil, beyond which they were\r\nnot known to have ranged anywhere south of the Amazons. But this view is\r\nnow shown to be untenable, and several Carib tribes, such as the Bakairi\r\nand Nahuqua[946] of the Upper Xingu, all speaking archaic forms of the\r\nCarib stock language, have been met by the German explorers in the very\r\nheart of Brazil; whence the inference that the cradle of this race is to\r\nbe sought rather in the centre of South America, perhaps on the Goyaz\r\nand Matto Grosso table-lands, from which region they moved northwards,\r\nif not to Florida, at least to the Caribbean Sea which is named from\r\nthem[947]. The wide diffusion of this stock is evidenced by the\r\nexistence of an unmistakably Carib tribe in the basin of the Rio\r\nMagdalena beyond the Andes[948].\r\n\r\nIn the north the chief groups are the Makirifare of Venezuela and the\r\nMacusi, Kalina, and Galibi of British, Dutch, and French Guiana[949]\r\nrespectively. In general all the Caribs present much the same physical\r\ncharacters, although the southerners are rather taller (5 ft. 4 in.)\r\nwith less round heads (index 79.6) than the Guiana Caribs (5 ft 2 in.,\r\nand 81.3).\r\n\r\nPerhaps even a greater extension has been given by the German explorers\r\nto the Arawakan family, which, like the Cariban, was hitherto supposed\r\nto be mainly confined to the region north of the Amazons, but is now\r\nknown to range as far south as the Upper Paraguay, about 20 deg. S. lat.\r\n(_Layana_, _Kwana_, etc.), east to the Amazons estuary (_Aruan_), and\r\nnorth-west to the Goajira peninsula. To this great family--which von den\r\nSteinen proposes to call _Nu-Aruak_ from the pronominal prefix _nu_ = I,\r\ncommon to most of the tribes--belong also the _Maypures_ of the Orinoco;\r\nthe _Atarais_ and _Vapisiana_ of British Guiana; the _Manao_ of the Rio\r\nNegro; the _Yumana_; the _Paumari_ and _Ipurina_ of the Ipuri basin; the\r\n_Moxo_ of the Upper Mamore, and the _Mehinaku_ and _Kustenau_ of the\r\nUpper Xingu.\r\n\r\nPhysically the Arawaks differ from the Caribs scarcely, if at all, more\r\nthan their Amazonian and Guiana sections differ from each other. In\r\nfact, but for their radically distinct speech it would be impossible to\r\nconstitute these two ethnical divisions, which are admittedly based on\r\nlinguistic grounds. But while the Caribs had their cradle in Central\r\nBrazil and migrated northwards, the Arawaks would appear to have\r\noriginated in eastern Bolivia, and spread thence east, north-east and\r\nsouth-east along the Amazons and Orinoco and into the Paraguay\r\nbasin[950].\r\n\r\nOur third great Brazilian division, the Gesan family, takes its name\r\nfrom the syllable ges which, like the Araucan _che_, forms the final\r\nelement of several tribal names in East Brazil. Of this the most\r\ncharacteristic are the _Aimores_ of the Serra dos Aimores coast range,\r\nwho are better known as Botocudo, and it was to the kindred tribes of\r\nthe province of Goyaz that the arbitrary collective name of \"Ges\" was\r\nfirst applied by Martius. A better general designation would perhaps\r\nhave been _Tapuya_, \"Strangers,\" \"Enemies,\" a term by which the Tupi\r\npeople called all other natives of that region who were not of their\r\nrace or speech, or rather who were not \"Tupi,\" that is, \"Allies\" or\r\n\"Associates.\" Tapuya had been adopted somewhat in this sense by the\r\nearly Portuguese writers, who however applied it rather loosely not only\r\nto the Aimores, but also to a large number of kindred and other tribes\r\nas far north as the Amazons estuary.\r\n\r\nTo the same connection belong several groups in Goyaz already described\r\nby Milliet and Martius, and more recently visited by Ehrenreich, von den\r\nSteinen and Krause. Such are the Kayapo or Suya, a large nation with\r\nseveral divisions between the Araguaya and Xingu rivers; and the Akua,\r\nbetter known as Cherentes, about the upper course of the Tocantins.\r\nIsolated Tapuyan tribes, such as the Kames or Kaingangs, wrongly called\r\n\"Coroados,\" and the Chogleng of Santa Catharina and Rio Grand do Sul,\r\nare scattered over the southern provinces of Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe Tapuya would thus appear to have formerly occupied the whole of East\r\nBrazil from the Amazons to the Plate River for an unknown distance\r\ninland. Here they must be regarded as the true aborigines, who were in\r\nremote times already encroached upon, and broken into isolated\r\nfragments, by tribes of the Tupi-Guarani stock spreading from the\r\ninterior seawards[951].\r\n\r\nBut in their physical characters and extremely low cultural state, or\r\nrather the almost total absence of anything that can be called\r\n\"culture,\" the Tapuya are the nearest representatives and probably the\r\ndirect descendants of the primitive race, whose osseous remains have\r\nbeen found in the Lagoa Santa caves, and the Santa Catharina\r\nshell-mounds (_sambaqui_). On anatomic grounds the Botocudo are allied\r\nboth to the Lagoa Santa fossil man and to the _sambaqui_ race by J. R.\r\nPeixoto, who describes the skull as marked by prominent glabella and\r\nsuperciliary arches, keel or roof-shaped vault, vertical lateral walls,\r\nsimple sutures, receding brow, deeply depressed nasal root, high\r\nprognathism, massive lower jaw, and long head (index 73.30) with\r\ncranial capacity 1480 c.c. for men, and 1212 for women[952]. It is also\r\nnoteworthy that some of the Botocudo[953] call themselves _Nacnanuk_,\r\n_Nac-poruc_, \"Sons of the Soil,\" and they have no traditions of ever\r\nhaving migrated from any other land. All their implements--spears, bow\r\nand arrows, mortars, water-vessels, bags--are of wood or vegetable\r\nfibre, so that they may be said not to have yet reached even the stone\r\nage. They are not, however, in the promiscuous state, as has been\r\nasserted, for the unions, though temporary, are jealously guarded while\r\nthey last, and, as amongst the Fuegians whom they resemble in so many\r\nrespects, the women are constantly subject to the most barbarous\r\ntreatment, beaten with clubs or hacked about with bamboo knives. One of\r\nthose in Ribeiro's party, who visited London in 1883, had her arms,\r\nlegs, and whole body covered with scars and gashes inflicted during\r\nmomentary fits of brutal rage by her ephemeral partner. Their dwellings\r\nare mere branches stuck in the ground, bound together with bast, and\r\nthough seldom over 4 ft. in height accommodating two or more families.\r\nThe Botocudo are pure nomads, roaming naked in the woods in quest of the\r\nroots, berries, honey, frogs, snakes, grubs, man, and other larger game\r\nwhich form their diet, and are eaten raw or else cooked in huge bamboo\r\ncanes. Formerly they had no hammocks, but slept without any covering,\r\neither on the ground strewn with bast, or in the ashes of the fire\r\nkindled for the evening meal. About their cannibalism, which has been\r\ndoubted, there is really no question. They wore the teeth of those they\r\nhad eaten strung together as necklaces, and ate not only the foe slain\r\nin battle, but members of kindred tribes, all but the heads, which were\r\nstuck as trophies on stakes and used as butts for the practice of\r\narchery.\r\n\r\nAt the graves of the dead, fires are kept up for some time to scare away\r\nthe bad spirits, from which custom the Botocudo might be credited with\r\nsome notions concerning the supernatural. All good influences are\r\nattributed by them to the \"day-fire\" (sun), all bad things to the\r\n\"night-fire\" (moon), which causes the thunderstorm, and is supposed\r\nitself at times to fall on the earth, crushing the hill-tops, flooding\r\nthe plains and destroying multitudes of people. During storms and\r\neclipses arrows are shot up to scare away the demons or devouring\r\ndragons, as amongst so many Indo-Chinese peoples. But beyond this there\r\nis no conception of a supreme being, or creative force, the terms\r\n_yanchong_, _tapan_, said to mean \"God,\" standing merely for spirit,\r\ndemon, thunder, or at most the thunder god.\r\n\r\nOwing to the choice made by the missionaries of the Tupi language as the\r\n_lingoa geral_, or common medium of intercourse amongst the\r\nmultitudinous populations of Brazil and Paraguay, a somewhat exaggerated\r\nidea has been formed of the range of the Tupi-Guarani family. Many of\r\nthe tribes about the stations, after being induced by the padres to\r\nlearn this convenient _lingua franca_, were apt in course of time to\r\nforget their own mother-tongue, and thus came to be accounted members of\r\nthis family. But allowing for such a source of error, there can be no\r\ndoubt that at the discovery the Tupi or Eastern, and the Guarani or\r\nWestern, section occupied jointly an immense area, which may perhaps be\r\nestimated at about one-fourth of the southern continent. Tupi tribes\r\nwere met as far west as Peru, where they were represented by the Omagua\r\n(\"Flatheads[954]\"), in French Guiana the Emerillons and the Oyampi\r\nbelong to this stock, as do the Kamayura and Auetoe on the Upper Xingu,\r\nand the Mundurucu of the middle Tapajoz.\r\n\r\nSome attention has been paid to the speech of the Ticuna of the Maranon,\r\nwhich appears to be a stock language with strong Pana and weak\r\nAymara[955] affinities. Although its numeral system stops at 2, it is\r\nstill in advance of a neighbouring _Chiquito_ tongue, which is said to\r\nhave no numerals at all, _etama_, supposed to be 1, really meaning\r\n\"alone.\"\r\n\r\nYet it would be a mistake to infer that these Bolivian Chiquito, who\r\noccupy the southernmost headstreams of the Madeira, are a particularly\r\nstupid people. On the contrary, the Naquinoneis, \"Men,\" as they call\r\nthemselves, are in some respects remarkably clever, and, strange to say,\r\ntheir otherwise rich and harmonious language (presumably the dominant\r\n_Moncoca_ dialect is meant) has terms to express such various\r\ndistinctions as the height of a tree, of a house, of a tower, and other\r\nsubtle shades of difference disregarded in more cultured tongues[956].\r\nBut it is to be considered that, _pace_ Max Mueller, the range of thought\r\nand of speech is not the same, and all peoples have no doubt many\r\nnotions for which they have no equivalents in their necessarily\r\ndefective languages. The Chiquito, _i.e._ \"Little Folks,\" were so named\r\nbecause, \"when the country was first invaded, the Indians fled to the\r\nforests; and the Spaniards came to their abandoned huts, where the\r\ndoorways were so exceedingly low that the Indians who had fled were\r\nsupposed to be dwarfs[957].\" They are a peaceful industrious nation, who\r\nply several trades, manufacture their own copper boilers for making\r\nsugar, weave ponchos and straw hats, and when they want blue trousers\r\nthey plant a row of indigo, and rows of white and yellow cotton when\r\nstriped trousers are in fashion. Hence the question arises, whether\r\nthese clever little people may not after all have originally possessed\r\nsome defective numeral system, which was merely superseded by the\r\nSpanish numbers.\r\n\r\nThe Gran Chaco is another area of considerable modification induced by\r\nEuropean influence, and there only remain hybridised descendants of many\r\nof the ancient peoples, for example, the Abipone of the Guaycuru family.\r\nPure survivals of this family are the Mataco and Toba of the Vermejo and\r\nPilcomayo rivers. These two tribes were visited by Ehrenreich, who\r\nnoticed their disproportionately short arms and legs, and excessive\r\ndevelopment of the thorax[958]. The daily life, customs, and beliefs of\r\nthese and other Chaco Indians have been admirably described and\r\nillustrated by Erland Nordenskioeld[959], who lived and travelled among\r\nthem. The Toba and Mataco frequently fall out with the neighbouring\r\nChoroti and Ashluslays of the Pilcomayo anent fishing rights and so on,\r\nbut the conflict consists in ambuscades and treachery rather than in\r\npitched battles. Weapons consist of bows and arrows and clubs, and\r\nlances are used on horseback. Enemies are scalped and these trophies are\r\ngreatly prized, being hung outside the victor's hut when fine and\r\nplaying a part on great occasions. On the conclusion of peace both sides\r\npay the blood-price for those slain by them in sheep, horses, etc.\r\nWithin the Choroti or Ashluslay village all are equal, and though\r\nproperty is held individually, the fortunate will always share with\r\nthose in want, so that theft is unknown. To kill old people or young\r\nchildren is regarded as no crime[960].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[873] Some Nahuas, whom the Spaniards called \"Mexicans\" or \"Chichimecs,\"\r\nwere met by Vasquez de Coronado even as far south as the Chiriqui\r\nlagoon, Panama. These Seguas, as they called themselves, have since\r\ndisappeared, and it is no longer possible to say how they strayed so far\r\nfrom their northern homes.\r\n\r\n[874] \"Recent Maya Investigations,\" _Bur.

In \"The Maya Year\"\r\n(1894) Cyrus Thomas shows that \"the year recorded in the Dresden codex\r\nconsisted of 18 months of 20 days each, with 5 supplemental days, or of\r\n365 days\" (_ib._). S. G. Morley points out (_Bur. Am. Eth. Bull._ 57,\r\npp. 44-5) that though the Maya doubtless knew that the true length of\r\nthe year exceeded 365 days by 6 hours, yet no interpolation of\r\nintercalary days was actually made, as this would have thrown the whole\r\ncalendar into confusion. The priests apparently corrected the calendar\r\nby additional calculations to show how far the recorded year was ahead\r\nof the true year. Those who have persistently appealed to these\r\nMaya-Aztec calendric systems as convincing proofs of Asiatic influences\r\nin the evolution of American cultures will now have to show where these\r\ninfluences come in. As a matter of fact the systems are fundamentally\r\ndistinct, the American showing the clearest indications of local\r\ndevelopment, as seen in the mere fact that the day characters of the\r\nMaya codices were phonetic, _i.e._ largely rebuses explicable only in\r\nthe Maya language, which has no affinities out of America. A careful\r\nstudy of the Maya calendric system based both on the codices and the\r\ninscriptions has been made by C. P. Bowditch, _The Numeration, Calendar\r\nSystems and Astronomical Knowledge of the Mayas_, Cambridge, Mass. 1910.\r\nThe Aztec month of 20 days is also clearly indicated by the 20\r\ncorresponding signs on the great Calendar Stone now fixed in the wall of\r\nthe Cathedral tower of Mexico. This basalt stone, which weighs 25 tons\r\nand has a diameter of 11 feet, is briefly described and figured by T. A.\r\nJoyce, _Mexican Archaeology_, 1914, pp. 73, 74; cf. Pl. VIII. fig. 1.\r\nSee also the account by Alfredo Chavero in the _Anales del Museo\r\nNacional de Mexico_, and an excellent reproduction of the Calendar Stone\r\nin T. U.

Cf. _The Civilization of Ancient Mexico_, 1912, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[889] \"Chiefly of the Nahuatl race\" (De Nadaillac, p. 279). It should,\r\nhowever be noted that this general name of Chichimec (meaning little\r\nmore than \"nomadic hunters\") comprised a large number of barbarous\r\ntribes--Pames, Pintos, etc.--who are described as wandering about naked\r\nor wearing only the skins of beasts, living in caves or rock-shelters,\r\narmed with bows, slings, and clubs, constantly at war amongst themselves\r\nor with the surrounding peoples, eating raw flesh, drinking the blood of\r\ntheir captives or treating them with unheard-of cruelty, altogether a\r\nhorror and terror to all the more civilised communities. \"Chichimec\r\nEmpire\" may therefore be taken merely as a euphemistic expression for\r\nthe reign of barbarism raised up on the ruins of the early Toltec\r\ncivilisation. Yet it had its dynasties and dates and legendary sequence\r\nof events, according to the native historian, Ixtlilxochitl, himself of\r\nroyal lineage, and he states that Xolotl, founder of the empire, had\r\nunder orders 3,202,000 men and women, that his decisive victory over the\r\nToltecs took place in 1015, that he assumed the title of \"Chichimecatl\r\nTecuhti,\" Great Chief of the Chichimecs, and that after a succession of\r\nrevolts, wars, conspiracies, and revolutions, Maxtla, last of the\r\ndynasty, was overthrown in 1431 by the Aztecs and their allies.\r\n\r\n[890] H. Beuchat, _Manuel d'Archeologie americaine_, pp. 262-6.\r\n\r\n[891] Named from the shadowy land of Aztlan away to the north, where\r\nthey long dwelt in the seven legendary caves of Chicomoztoc, whence they\r\nmigrated at some unknown period to the lacustrine region, where they\r\nfounded Tenochtitlan, seat of their empire.\r\n\r\n[892] \"The gods of the Mayas appear to have been less sanguinary than\r\nthose of the Nahuas. The immolation of a dog was with them enough for an\r\noccasion that would have been celebrated by the Nahuas with hecatombs of\r\nvictims. Human sacrifices did however take place\" (De Nadaillac, p.\r\n266), though they were as nothing compared with the countless victims\r\ndemanded by the Aztec gods. \"The dedication by Ahuizotl of the great\r\ntemple of Huitzilopochtli in 1487 is alleged to have been celebrated by\r\nthe butchery of 72,344 victims,\" and \"under Montezuma II. 12,000\r\ncaptives are said to have perished\" on one occasion (_ib._ p. 297); all\r\nno doubt gross exaggerations, but leaving a large margin for perhaps the\r\nmost terrible chapter of horrors in the records of natural religions.\r\nCf.

But they practically offered no\r\nresistance to the ruthless Conquistadores, and it was a Cuban chief who\r\neven under torture refused to be baptized, declaring that he would never\r\nenter the same heaven as the Spaniard.

Pre-Dravidian characters are\r\ncoarse hair, more or less wavy or curly, a narrow head, a very broad\r\nnose, dark brown skin and short stature.\r\n\r\nThe following may be taken as examples of the Pre-Dravidian jungle\r\ntribes of Southern India[961]. The _Kadir_ of the Anaimalai Hills and\r\nthe mountain ranges south into Travancore, are of short stature (1.577\r\nm. 5 ft. 2 in.), with a dark skin, dolichocephalic and platyrrhine. They\r\nchip their incisor teeth, as do the _Mala-Vadan_, and dilate the lobes\r\nof their ears, but do not tattoo. They wear bamboo combs similar to\r\nthose of the Sakai. They speak a Tamil patois. \"The Kadirs,\" according\r\nto Thurston, \"afford a typical example of happiness without culture\";\r\nthey are nomad hunters and collectors of jungle products, with scarcely\r\nany tillage; they do not possess land but have the right to collect all\r\nminor forest produce and sell it to the Government. They deal most\r\nextensively in wax and honey. They are polygynous. Their dead are buried\r\nin the jungle, the head is entirely covered with leaves and placed\r\ntowards the east; there are no monuments. Their religion is a crude\r\npolytheism with a vague worship of stone images or invisible gods; it is\r\n\"an ejaculatory religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Paniyan_, who live in Malabar, the Wynad and the Nilgiris, have\r\nthick and sometimes everted lips and the hair is in some a mass of short\r\ncurls, in others long wavy curls. They are dark skinned, dolichocephalic\r\n(index 74), platyrrhine and of short stature (1.574 m. 5 ft. 2 in.).\r\nThey sometimes tattoo, and the lobes of the ears are dilated. Fire is\r\nmade by the sawing method. They are agriculturalists and were\r\npractically serfs; they are bold and reckless and were formerly often\r\nemployed as thieves. They speak a debased Malayalam patois. Their dead\r\nare buried; they practise monogamy and have beliefs in various spirits.\r\n\r\nThe _Irula_ are the darkest of the Nilgiri tribes. They are\r\ndolichocephalic (index 75.8), platyrrhine and of low stature (1.598 m.\r\nnearly 5 ft. 3 in.). No tattooing is recorded, but they dilate the lobes\r\nof their ears. Their language is a corrupt form of Tamil. They are\r\nagriculturalists and eat all kinds of meat except that of buffaloes and\r\ncattle. They are as a rule monogamous. Their dead are buried in a\r\nsitting posture and the grave is marked by a stone. Professedly they are\r\nworshippers of Vishnu.\r\n\r\nThe jungle _Kurumba_ of the Nilgiris appear to be remnants of a great\r\nand widely spread people who erected dolmens. They have slightly broader\r\nheads (index 77) than allied tribes, but resemble them in their broad\r\nnose, dark skin and low stature (1.575 m. 5 ft. 2 in.). They cultivate\r\nthe ground a little, but are essentially woodcutters, hunters, and\r\ncollectors of jungle produce. There is said to be no marriage rite, and\r\nseveral brothers share a wife. Some bury their dead. After a death a\r\nlong waterworn stone is usually placed in one of the old dolmens which\r\nare scattered over the Nilgiri plateau, but occasionally a small dolmen\r\nis raised to mark the burial. They have a great reputation for magical\r\npowers. Some worship Siva, others worship Kuribattraya (Lord of many\r\nsheep), and the wife of Siva. They also worship a rough stone, setting\r\nit up in a cave or in a circle of stones to which they make _puja_ and\r\noffer cooked rice at the sowing time. The Kadu Kurumba of Mysore bury\r\nchildren but cremate adults; there is a separate house in each village\r\nfor unmarried girls and another at the end of the village for unmarried\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nThe _Vedda_ of Ceylon have long black coarse wavy or slightly curly\r\nhair. The cephalic index is 70.5, the nose is depressed at the root,\r\nalmost platyrrhine; the broad face is remarkably orthognathous and the\r\nforehead is slightly retreating with prominent brow arches; the lips are\r\nthin, and the skin is dark brown. The stature is extremely low, only\r\n1.533 m. (5 ft. 0-1/2 in.). The Coast and less pure Vedda average 43 mm.\r\n(1-3/4 in.) taller and have broader heads. The true Vedda are a grave\r\nbut happy people, quiet, upright, hospitable with a strong love of\r\nliberty. Lying and theft are unknown. They are timid and have a great\r\nfear of strangers. The bow and arrow are their only weapons and the\r\narrow tipped with iron obtained from the Sinhalese forms a universal\r\ntool. They speak a modified Sinhali, but employ only one numeral and\r\ncount with sticks. They live under rock shelters or in simple huts made\r\nof boughs. They are strictly monogamous and live in isolated families\r\nwith no chiefs and have no regular clan meetings. Each section of the\r\nVedda had in earlier days its own hunting grounds where fish, game,\r\nhoney, and yams constituted their sole food. The wild Vedda simply leave\r\ntheir dead in a cave, which is then deserted. The three things that loom\r\nlargest in the native mind are hunting, honey, and the cult of the\r\ndead. The last constitutes almost the whole of the religious life and\r\nmagical practices of the people; it is the _motif_ of almost every dance\r\nand may have been the source of all. After a death they perform certain\r\ndances and rites through a _shaman_ in connection with the recently\r\ndeparted ghost, _yaka_. They also propitiate powerful _yaku_, male and\r\nfemale, by sacrifices and ceremonial dances[962].\r\n\r\nThe _Sakai_ or _Senoi_ are jungle folk, some of whom have mixed with\r\nSemang and other peoples. Their skin is of a medium brown colour. Their\r\nhair is long, mainly wavy or loosely curly, and black with a reddish\r\ntinge. The average stature may be taken to be from 1.5 m. to 1.55 m. (59\r\nto 61 inches), the head index varies from about 77 to 81. The face is\r\nfairly broad, with prominent cheek-bones and brow ridges; the low broad\r\nnose has spreading alae and short concave ridge; the lips are thick but\r\nnot everted. They are largely nomadic, and their agriculture is of the\r\nmost primitive description, their usual implement being the digging\r\nstick. Their houses are built on the ground and as a rule are\r\nrectangular in plan though occasionally conical, and huts are sometimes\r\nbuilt in trees as refuges from wild beasts. A scanty garment of bark\r\ncloth was formerly worn, and, like the Semang, they make fringed girdles\r\nfrom a black thread-like fungus. Their distinctive weapon is the\r\nblow-pipe which they have brought to great perfection, and their food\r\nconsists in jungle produce, including many poisonous roots and tubers\r\nwhich they have learnt how to treat, so as to render them innocuous.\r\nThey do not make canoes and rarely use rafts. In the marriage ceremony\r\nthe man has to chase the girl round a mound of earth and catch her\r\nbefore she has encircled it a third time. The marriage tie is strictly\r\nobserved. Each village has a petty chief, whose influence is purely\r\npersonal. Individual property does not exist, only family property.\r\nCultivation is also communal. The inhabitants of the upper heaven\r\nconsist of Tuhan or Peng, the \"god\" of the Sakai and a giantess named\r\n\"Granny Long-breasts\" who washes sin-blackened human souls in hot water;\r\nthe good souls ultimately go to a cloud-land. There are numerous demons\r\nand whenever the Sakai have done wrong Tuhan gives the demons leave to\r\nattack them, and there is no contending against his decree. He is not\r\nprayed to, as his will is unalterable[963].\r\n\r\nThe _Toala_ of the south-west peninsula of the Celebes are at base,\r\naccording to the Sarasins[964], a Pre-Dravidian people, though some\r\nmixture with other races has taken place. The hair is very wavy and even\r\ncurly, the skin darkish brown, the head low brachycephalic (index 82)\r\nand the stature 1.575 m. (5 ft. 2 in.). The face is somewhat short with\r\nvery broad nose and thick lips. Possibly the _Ulu Ayar_ of west Borneo\r\nwho are related to the Land Dayaks may be partly of Pre-Dravidian origin\r\nand other traces of this race will probably be found in the East India\r\nArchipelago[965].\r\n\r\nAustralia resembles South Africa in the arid conditions characterising\r\nthe interior, the eastern range of mountains precipitating the warm\r\nmoisture-laden winds from the Pacific. As a result of the restricted\r\nrainfall there is no river system of importance except that of the\r\nMurray and its tributary the Darling. In the north and north-east, owing\r\nto heavier rainfall, there are numerous water-courses, but they do not\r\nopen up the interior of the country. The lack of uniformity in the water\r\nsupply has a far-reaching effect on all living beings. The arid\r\nconditions, the irregularity and short duration of the rainfall oblige\r\nthe natives to be continually migrating, and prevent these unsettled\r\nbands from ever attaining any size, indeed they are sometimes hard\r\npressed to obtain enough food to keep alive.\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed that the backwardness of the culture of the\r\nAustralians is due partly to the low state of culture of their ancestors\r\nwhen they arrived in the country, and partly to the peculiar character\r\nof the country as well as of its flora and fauna, since Australia has\r\nnever been stocked with wild animals dangerous to human life, or with\r\nany suitable for domestication. The relative isolation from other\r\npeoples has had a retarding effect and the Australian has developed\r\nlargely along his own lines without the impetus given by competition\r\nwith other peoples. Records of simple migration are rare. There have\r\nbeen no waves of aggression, and intertribal feuds are not very serious\r\naffairs. The Australians have never influenced any other peoples and\r\nthey are doomed gradually to disappear.\r\n\r\nBaldwin Spencer says \"In the matter of personal appearance while\r\nconforming generally to what is known as the Australian type, there is\r\nconsiderable variation. The man varies from, approximately, a maximum of\r\n6 ft. 3 in. to a minimum of 5 ft. 2 in.... As a general rule, few of\r\nthem are taller than 5 ft. 8 in. The women vary between 5 ft. 9 in. and\r\n4 ft. 9 in. Their average height is not more than 5 ft. 2 in. The brow\r\nridges are strongly marked, especially in the man, and the forehead\r\nslopes back. The nose is broad with the root deep set. In colour the\r\nnative is dark chocolate brown, not black. The hair ... may be almost\r\nstraight, decidedly wavy--its usual feature--or almost, but never\r\nreally, frizzly.... The beard also may be well developed or almost\r\nabsent[966].\" The skull is dolichocephalic with an average cranial index\r\nof 72, prognathous and platyrrhine.\r\n\r\nThere has been much speculation with regard to the origin of the present\r\nAustralian race. According to Baldwin Spencer \"There can be no doubt but\r\nthat in past times the whole of the continent, including Tasmania, was\r\noccupied by one race. This original, and probably Negritto[967]\r\npopulation, at an early period; was widely spread over Malayasia and\r\nAustralia including Tasmania, which at that time was not shut off by\r\nBass Strait. The Tasmanians had no boats capable of crossing the latter\r\nand [it is assumed that their ancestors] must have gone over on\r\nland[968].\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently when the land sank a remnant of the old ulotrichous\r\npopulation \"was thus left stranded in Tasmania, where _Homo tasmanianus_\r\nsurvived until he came in contact with Europeans and was exterminated.\"\r\nHe had frizzly hair. \"His weapons and implements were of the most\r\nprimitive kind; long pointed unbarbed spears, no spear thrower, no\r\nboomerang, simple throwing stick and only the crudest form of chipped\r\nstone axes, knives and scrapers that were never hafted. Unfortunately\r\nof his organisation, customs, and beliefs we know but little in\r\ndetail[969].\"\r\n\r\nIt is now generally held that at a later date an immigration of a people\r\nin a somewhat higher stage of culture took place; these are regarded by\r\nsome as belonging to the Dravidian, and by others, and with more\r\nprobability, to the Pre-Dravidian race. J. Mathew[970] suggests that\r\n\"the two races are represented by the two primary classes, or phratries,\r\nof Australian society, which were generally designated by names\r\nindicating a contrast of colour, such as eaglehawk and crow. The crow,\r\nblack cockatoo, etc., would represent the Tasmanian element; the\r\neaglehawk, white cockatoo, etc., the so-called Dravidian.\" Baldwin\r\nSpencer does not think that the moiety names lend any serious support to\r\nthe theory of the mixture of two races differing in colour. He goes on\r\nto say \"Mr Mathew also postulates a comparatively recent slight infusion\r\nof Malay blood in the northern half of Australia. There is, however,\r\npractically no evidence of Malay infusion. One of the most striking\r\nfeatures of the Malay is his long, lank hair, and yet it is just in\r\nthese north parts that the most frizzly hair is met with[971].\"\r\n\r\nAs concerns linguistics S. H. Ray says \"There is no evidence of an\r\nAfrican, Andaman, Papuan, or Malay connection with the Australian\r\nlanguages. There are reasons for regarding the Australian as in a\r\nsimilar morphological stage to the Dravidian, but there is no\r\ngenealogical relationship proved[972].\" No connection has yet been\r\nproved between the Australian languages and the Austronesian or Oceanic\r\nbranch of the Austric family of languages, first systematically\r\ndescribed by W. Schmidt[973]. The study of Australian languages is\r\nparticularly difficult owing to the very few serviceable grammars and\r\ndictionaries, and the large number of very incomplete vocabularies\r\nscattered about in inaccessible works and journals. The main conclusion\r\nto which Schmidt has arrived[974] is that the Australian languages are\r\nnot, as had been supposed, a mainly uniform group. Though over the\r\ngreater part of Australia languages possess strong common elements,\r\nNorth Australia has languages showing no similarities in vocabulary and\r\nvery few in grammar with that larger group or with each other. The area\r\nof the North Australian languages is included in a line from south of\r\nRoebuck Bay in the west to Cape Flattery in the east, with a southward\r\nbend to include Arunta (Aranda), interrupted by a branch of southern\r\nlanguages running up north down Flinders and Leichhardt rivers[975]. The\r\narea contains two or three linguistic groups, best distinguished by\r\ntheir terminations which consist respectively of vowels and consonants,\r\nthe oldest group; vowels alone, the latest group; and vowels and\r\nliquids, probably representing a transition between the two.\r\n\r\nIn South Australia, though differences occur, the languages possess\r\ncommon features both in grammar and vocabulary, having similar personal\r\npronouns, and certain words for parts of the body in common. Linguistic\r\ndifferences are associated with differences in social grouping, the area\r\nof purely vowel endings coinciding with the area of the 2-class system\r\nand matrilinear descent, while the area of liquid endings is partly\r\ncoterminous with the 4-class system and (often) patrilinear succession.\r\n\r\nSchmidt endeavours to trace the connection between the distribution of\r\nlanguages with that of types of social groupings, more particularly in\r\nconnection with the culture zones which Graebner[976] has traced\r\nthroughout the Pacific area, representing successive waves of migration.\r\nThe first immigration, corresponding with Graebner's _Ur-period_, is\r\nrepresented by languages with postposed genitive, the earliest stratum\r\nbeing pure only in Tasmania; remnants of the first stratum and a second\r\nstratum occur in Victoria, and remnants of the second stratum to the\r\nnorth and north-east. According to Schmidt this cultural stratum is\r\ncharacterised by absence of group or marriage totemism, and presence of\r\nsex patrons (\"sex-totemism\"). The second immigration is represented by\r\nlanguages with preposition of the genitive, initial _r_ and _l_, vowel\r\nand explosive endings, and is found fairly pure only in the extreme\r\nnorth-west and north, and in places in the north-east. The great\r\nmultiplicity of languages belonging to this stratum may be attributed to\r\nthe predominance of the strictly local type of totem-groups. These are\r\nthe languages of Graebner's \"totem-culture.\" The third immigration is\r\nrepresented by languages with preposition of the genitive, no initial\r\n_r_ and _l_, and purely vowel terminations. These are the languages of\r\nthe south central group of tribes with a 2-class system and matrilinear\r\ndescent. This uniform group has the largest area and has influenced the\r\nwhole mass of Australian languages, only North Australia and Tasmania\r\nremaining immune. Their sociological structure with no localisation of\r\ntotems and classes contributed to their power of expansion. The fourth\r\nimmigration is represented by languages of an intermediate type, with\r\nvowel and liquid endings but no initial _r_ and _l_. These are the\r\ntribes with 4-class and 8-class systems, universal father-right (proving\r\nthe strong influence of older totemic ideas), curious fertility rites,\r\nconception ideas and migration myths.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Schmidt's conclusions confute the evolutionary\r\ntheory developed by Frazer, Hartland, Howitt, Spencer and Gillen,\r\nDurkheim and (in part) Andrew Lang, that Australia was essentially\r\nhomogeneous in fundamental ideas which have developed differently on\r\naccount of geographic and climatic variation. Schmidt's view is that\r\nAustralia was entered successively by a number of entirely different\r\ntribes, so that the variation now met with is due to radical diversities\r\nand to the numerous intermixtures arising from migrations and\r\nstratifications of peoples. The linguistic data dispose of the idea that\r\nthe oldest tribes with mother-right, 2-class system, traces of\r\ngroup-marriage, and lack of moral and religious ideas live in the\r\ncentre, and that from thence advancement radiated towards the coast\r\nbringing about father-right, abandonment of class system and totemism,\r\nindividual marriage, and higher ethical and religious ideas. On the\r\ncontrary it would appear that the centre of the continent is the great\r\nchannel in which movements are still taking place; the older peoples are\r\ndriven out towards the margin and there preserve the old sociological,\r\nethical and religious conditions. In fact, the older the people, judging\r\nfrom their linguistic stratum, the less one finds among them what has\r\nbeen assumed to be the initial stage for Central Australia[977]. These\r\nare Schmidt's views and they confirm the cultural results established by\r\nGraebner. But as the whole question of the culture layers in the Pacific\r\nis still under discussion it is inadvisable at this stage of our\r\nknowledge to make any definite statements. It is worth noting, however,\r\nthat[978] the distribution of simple burial of the dead coincides in the\r\nmain with Schmidt's South Australian language area, and the area roughly\r\nenclosed on the east by long. 140 deg. E. and the north by lat. 20 deg. S.\r\nappears to form a technological province distinct from the rest of\r\nAustralia[979].\r\n\r\nRarely can the Australian depend on regular supplies of food. He feeds\r\non flesh, fish, grubs and insects, and wild vegetable food; probably\r\neverything that is edible is eaten. Cannibalism is widely spread, but\r\nhuman flesh is nowhere a regular article of food. Clothing, apart from\r\nornament, is rarely worn, but in the south, skin cloaks and fur aprons\r\nare fairly common. Scarification of the body is frequent and\r\nconspicuous. The men usually let their hair grow long, and the women\r\nkeep theirs short. Dwellings are of the simplest character, usually\r\nmerely breakwinds or slight huts, but where there is a large supply of\r\nvegetable food, huts are made of boughs covered with bark or grass and\r\nare sometimes coated with clay. Implements are made of shell, bone, wood\r\nand stone. Baldwin Spencer remarks \"It is not too much to say that at\r\nthe present time we can parallel amongst Australian stone weapons all\r\nthe types known in Europe under the names Chellean, Mousterian,\r\nAurignacian etc.... The terms Eolithic, Palaeolithic, and Neolithic do\r\nnot apply in Australia as indicating either time periods or levels of\r\nculture[980].\" Spears and wooden clubs are universal, and the use of the\r\nspear-thrower is generally distributed. The boomerang is found almost\r\nthroughout Australia; the variety that returns when it is thrown is as a\r\nrule only a plaything or for throwing at birds. The forms of the various\r\nimplements vary in different parts of the country and in some districts\r\ncertain implements may be entirely absent. For example the boomerang is\r\nnot found in the northern parts of Cape York peninsula or of the\r\nNorthern Territory, and the spear-thrower is absent from south-east\r\nQueensland. Bows and arrows are unknown and pottery making does not\r\noccur. Rafts are made of one or more logs, and the commonest form of\r\ncanoe is that made of a single sheet of bark. Dug-outs occur in a few\r\nplaces, and both single and double outriggers are found only on the\r\nQueensland coast. These sporadic occurrences give additional support to\r\nthe modern view that the racial and cultural history of Australia is by\r\nno means so simple as has till lately been assumed[981].\r\n\r\nStudents of Australian sociology have been so much impressed with\r\ncertain prominent features of social organisation that they have paid\r\ninsufficient attention to kinship and the family; the former has however\r\nrecently been investigated by A. R. Brown[982], while information\r\nconcerning the latter has been carefully sifted by B. Malinowski[983].\r\nThe main features of social groupings are the tribe, the local groups,\r\nthe classes, the totemic clans and the families. A tribe is composed of\r\na number of local groups and these are perpetuated in the same tracts by\r\nthe sons, who hunt over the grounds of their fathers; this is the \"local\r\norganisation.\" The local group is the only political unit, and\r\n_intra_-group justice has been extended to _inter_-group justice, where\r\nthe units of reference are not based on kinship; this may be regarded as\r\nthe earliest stage of what is known as International Law[984]. In the\r\nso-called \"social organisation,\" the tribe as a community is divided\r\ninto two parts (moieties or phratries), which are quite distinct from\r\nthe local groups, though rarely they may be coincident. Each moiety may\r\nbe subdivided into two or four exogamous sections which are generally\r\ncalled \"classes\" and are peculiar to Australia. Descent in the classes\r\nis as a rule indirect matrilineal or indirect patrilineal, that is to\r\nsay, while the child still belongs to its mother's or father's moiety\r\n(as the case may be) it is assigned to the class to which the mother or\r\nthe father does not belong; but the grandchildren belong to the class of\r\na grandmother or grandfather. In diagram I (below) _A_ and _C_ are\r\nclasses of one moiety, #B# and _D_ those of the other. Thus when _A_ man\r\nmarries _B_ woman the children are _D_. _B_ man marries _A_ woman and\r\nthe children are _C_ and so on. When there are four classes in each\r\nmoiety the diagram works out as follows (II)[985]:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nVery important in social life are the initiation ceremonies by means of\r\nwhich a youth is admitted to the status of tribal manhood. These\r\nceremonies vary greatly from tribe to tribe but they agree in certain\r\nfundamental points. \"(1) They begin at the age of puberty. (2) During\r\nthe initiation ceremonies the women play an important part. (3) At the\r\nclose of the first part of the ceremonies, such as that of tooth\r\nknocking out or circumcision, a definite performance is enacted\r\nemblematic of the fact that the youths have passed out of the control of\r\nthe women. (4) During the essential parts the women are typically absent\r\nand the youths are shown the bull-roarer, have the secret beliefs\r\nexplained to them and are instructed in the moral precepts and customs,\r\nincluding food restrictions, that they must henceforth observe under\r\nsevere penalties. (5) The last grade is not passed through until a man\r\nis quite mature[986].\"\r\n\r\nPractically universal is the existence of a grouping of individuals\r\nunder the names of plants, animals or various objects; these are termed\r\ntotems and the human groups are termed totem clans. The members of a\r\ntotem clan commonly believe themselves to be actually descended from or\r\nrelated to their totem, and all members of a clan, whatever tribe they\r\nmay belong to, are regarded as brethren, who have mutual duties,\r\nprohibitions and privileges. Thus a member of a totem clan must help and\r\nnever injure any fellow member. \"Speaking generally it may be said that\r\nevery totemic group has certain ceremonies associated with it and that\r\nthese refer to old totemic ancestors. In all tribes they form part of a\r\nsecret ritual in which only the initiated may take part. In most tribes\r\na certain number are shown to the youths during the early stages of\r\ninitiation, but at a later period he sees many more[987].\"\r\n\r\nIn several tribes, and probably it was very general, certain magical\r\nceremonies were performed to render the totem abundant or efficacious.\r\nThe sex patron (\"sex totem\"), when the women have one animal, such as\r\nthe owlet night-jar associated with them, and the men another, such as\r\nthe bat; and the guardian genius (mis-called \"individual totem\"),\r\nacquired by dreaming of some animal, are of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe individual family has been shown by Malinowski[988] to be \"a unit\r\nplaying an important part in the social life of the natives and well\r\ndefined by a number of moral, customary and legal norms; it is further\r\ndetermined by the sexual division of labour, the aboriginal mode of\r\nliving, and especially by the intimate relation between the parents and\r\nchildren. The individual relation between husband and wife (marriage) is\r\nrooted in the unity of the family ... and in the well-defined, though\r\nnot always exclusive, sexual right the husband acquires over his wife.\"\r\nAll sexual licence is regulated by and subject to strict rules. The\r\n_Pirrauru_ custom, by which individuals are allocated accessory spouses,\r\n\"proves that the relationship involved does not possess the character of\r\nmarriage. For it completely differs from marriage in nearly all the\r\nessential points by which marriage in Australia is defined. And above\r\nall the Pirrauru relation does not seem to involve the facts of family\r\nlife in its true sense\" (p. 298).\r\n\r\nA. R. Brown[989] asserts that so far as our information goes, the only\r\nmethod of regulating marriage is by means of the relationship system. In\r\nevery tribe there is a law to the effect that a man may only marry women\r\nwho stand to him in a certain relationship, and there is no evidence\r\nthat there is any other method of regulating marriage. The so-called\r\nclass rule by which a man of a special division or group is required to\r\nmarry a woman of another division is merely the law of relationship\r\nstated in a less exact form. It is the fact that a man may only marry a\r\nrelative of a certain kind that necessitates the marrying into a\r\nparticular relationship division. The rule of totemic exogamy, according\r\nto A. R. Brown, is equally seen to have no existence apart from the\r\nrelationship rule. Where a totemic group is a clan and consists of\r\nrelations all of one line of descent, a man is prohibited from marrying\r\na woman of his own group by the ordinary rule of relationship. On the\r\nother hand, where the totemic group is not a clan, but is a local group\r\n(as in the Burduna tribe) or a cult society (as in the Arunta tribe)\r\nthere is no rule prohibiting a man from marrying a woman of the same\r\ntotemic group as himself. The so-called rule of local exogamy in some\r\ntribes (perhaps in all) is merely a result of the fact that the local\r\ngroup is a clan, _i.e._ a group of persons related in one line of\r\ndescent only. Only two methods of regulating marriage are known to exist\r\nin the greater part of Australia[990]: Type I. A man marries the\r\ndaughter of one of the men he denotes by the same term as his mother's\r\nbrother. Type II. A man marries a woman who is the daughter's daughter\r\nof some man whom he denotes by the same term as his mother's mother's\r\nbrother. In either case he may not marry any other kind of relative. The\r\nexistence of two phratries or moieties or four named divisions\r\n(\"classes\") in a tribe conveys no information whatever as to the\r\nmarriage rule of the tribe. The term \"class\" and \"sub-class,\" according\r\nto A. R. Brown, had better be discarded as writers use them to denote\r\nseveral totally distinct kinds of divisions.\r\n\r\nThe tribe has collecting and hunting rights over an area with recognised\r\nlimits, smaller communities down to the family unit having similar\r\nrights within the tribal boundaries. In some cases a tribe which had no\r\nstone suitable for making stone implements within its own boundaries was\r\nallowed to send tribal messengers to a quarry to procure what was needed\r\nwithout molestation, though Howitt speaks of family ownership of\r\nquarries[991]. Implements are personal property. An extensive system of\r\nintertribal communication and exchange is carried on, apparently by\r\nrecognised middlemen, and tribes meet on certain occasions at\r\nestablished trade centres for a regulated barter.\r\n\r\nBeneficent and malevolent magic are universally practised and totemism\r\npossesses a religious besides a social aspect. An emotional relation\r\noften exists between the members of a totem clan and their totem, and\r\nthe latter are believed at times to warn or protect their human\r\nkinsmen. It may be noted that the widely spread and elaborate ceremonies\r\ndesigned to render the totem prolific or to ensure its abundance, though\r\nperformed solely by members of the totem clan concerned, are less for\r\ntheir own benefit than for that of the community[992]. Owing perhaps to\r\nthe difficulty of distinguishing between the purely social and the\r\nreligious institutions of primitive peoples great diversity of opinion\r\nprevails even amongst the best observers regarding the religious views\r\nof the Australian aborigines. The existence of a \"tribal All-Father\" is\r\nperhaps most clearly emphasised by A. W. Howitt[993], who finds this\r\nbelief widespread in the whole of Victoria and New South Wales, up to\r\nthe eastern boundaries of the tribes of the Darling River. Amongst those\r\nof New South Wales are the Euahlayi, whom K. Langloh Parker\r\ndescribes[994] as having a more advanced theology and a more developed\r\nworship (including prayers, pp. 79-80) than any other Australian tribe.\r\nThese now eat their hereditary totem without scruple--a sure sign that\r\nthe totemic system is dying out, although still outwardly in full force.\r\nAmongst the Arunta, Kaitish, and the other Central and Northern tribes\r\nstudied by Spencer and Gillen, totemism still survives, and totems are\r\neven assigned to the mysterious _Iruntarinia_ entities, vague and\r\ninvisible incarnations of the ghosts of ancestors who lived in the\r\n_Alcheringa_ time, the dim remote past at the beginning of everything.\r\nThese are far more powerful than living men, because their spirit part\r\nis associated with the so-called _churinga_, consisting of stones,\r\npieces of wood or any other objects which are deemed sacred as\r\npossessing a kind of _mana_ which makes the yams and grass to grow,\r\nenables a man to capture game, and so forth. \"That the _churinga_ are\r\nsimply objects endowed with _mana_ is the happy suggestion of Sidney\r\nHartland[995] whose explanation has dispelled the dense fog of\r\nmystification hitherto enveloping the strange beliefs and observances of\r\nthese Central and Northern tribes[996].\" N. W. Thomas[997] reviews the\r\nwhole question of Australian religion, and after describing Twanjiraka,\r\nMalbanga and Ulthaana, of the Arunta, Baiame or Byamee, famous in\r\nanthropological controversy[998], Daramulun of the Yuin, Mungan-ngaua\r\n(our father) of the Kurnai, Nurrundere of the Narrinyeri, Bunjil or\r\nPundjel, often called Mamingorak (our father) of Victoria, and others,\r\nhe concludes \"These are by no means the only gods known to Australian\r\ntribes; on the contrary it can hardly be definitely asserted that there\r\nis or was any tribe which had not some such belief[999].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[961] E.

Why this should be so is not at first sight\r\nquite apparent, though the phenomenon may perhaps be partly explained by\r\nthe consideration that the component parts are really of a more complex\r\ncharacter, and thus present more intricate problems for solution, than\r\nthose of any other division. But to some extent this would also seem to\r\nbe one of those cases in which we fail to see the wood for the trees. To\r\nput it plainly, few will venture to deny that the inherent difficulties\r\nof the subject have in recent times been rather increased than\r\ndiminished by the bold and often mutually destructive theories, and, in\r\nsome instances one might add, the really wild speculations put forward\r\nin the earnest desire to remove the endless obscurities in which the\r\nmore fundamental questions are undoubtedly still involved. Controversial\r\nmatter which seemed thrashed out has been reopened, several fresh\r\nfactors have been brought into play, and the warfare connected with such\r\nburning topics as Aryan origins, Ibero-Pelasgic relations, European\r\nround-heads and long-heads, has acquired renewed intensity amid the\r\nrival theories of eminent champions of new ideas.\r\n\r\nThe question is not made any simpler by the frequent attacks that have\r\nbeen directed from more than one quarter against the long-established\r\nCaucasic terminology, and well-supported objections are raised to the\r\nuse of such time-honoured names as \"Hamitic,\" \"Semitic,\" and even\r\n\"Caucasic\" itself. But no really satisfactory substitute for \"Caucasic\"\r\nhas yet been suggested, and it is doubtful if any name could be found\r\nsufficiently comprehensive to include all the races, long-headed and\r\nshort-headed, fair and dark, tall and short, that we are at present\r\ncontent to group under this non-committal heading. Undoubtedly the term\r\n\"Caucasic\" cannot be defended on ethnical grounds. \"Nowhere else in the\r\nworld probably is so heterogeneous a lot of people, languages and\r\nreligions gathered together in one place as along the chain of the\r\nCaucasus mountains[1000].\" But we are no more called upon to believe\r\nthat the \"Caucasic\" peoples originated in the Caucasus, than that the\r\nSemites are all descendants of Shem or Hamites of Ham. \"Caucasic\" has\r\none claim that can never be disputed, that of priority, and it would be\r\nwell if innovators in these matters were to take to heart the sober\r\nlanguage of Ehrenreich, who reminds us that the accepted names are, what\r\nthey ought to be, \"purely conventional,\" and \"historically justified,\"\r\nand \"should be held as valid until something better can be found to take\r\ntheir place[1001].\" It was considerations such as these, weighing so\r\nstrongly in favour of current usage, that induced me _stare per vias\r\nantiquas_ in the _Ethnology_, and consequently also in the present work.\r\nHence, here as there, the Caucasic Division retains its title, together\r\nwith those of its main subdivisions--Hamitic, Semitic, Keltic, Slavic,\r\nHellenic, Teutonic, Iranic, Galchic and so on.\r\n\r\nThe chief exception is \"Aryan,\" a linguistic expression forced by the\r\nphilologists into the domain of Ethnology, where it has no place or\r\nmeaning. There was of course a time when a community, or group of\r\ncommunities, existed probably in the steppe region between the\r\nCarpathians and the Hindu-Kush[1002], by whom the Aryan mother-tongue\r\nwas evolved, and who still for a time presented a certain uniformity in\r\ntheir physical characters, were, in fact, of Aryan speech and type. But\r\nwhile their Aryan speech persists in endlessly modified forms, they have\r\nthemselves long disappeared as a distinct race, merged in the countless\r\nother races on whom they, perhaps as conquerors, imposed their Aryan\r\nlanguage. Hence we can and must speak of Aryan tongues, and of an Aryan\r\nlinguistic family, which continues to flourish and spread over the\r\nglobe. But of an Aryan race there can be no further question since the\r\nabsorption of the original stock in a hundred other races in remote\r\nprehistoric times. Where comprehensive references have to be made, I\r\ntherefore substitute for Aryans and Aryan race the expression peoples of\r\nAryan speech, at least wherever the unqualified term Aryan might lead to\r\nmisunderstandings.\r\n\r\nThis way of looking at the question, which has now become more thorny\r\nthan ever, has the signal advantage of being indifferent to any\r\npreconceived theories regarding the physical characters of that long\r\nvanished proto-Aryan race. How great this advantage is may be judged\r\nfrom the mere statement that, while German anthropologists are still\r\nalmost to a man loyal to the traditional view that the first Aryans were\r\nbest represented by the tall, long-headed, tawny-haired, blue-eyed\r\nTeutonic barbarians of Tacitus--who, Virchow tells us, have completely\r\ndisappeared from sight in the present population--the Italian school, or\r\nat least its chief exponent, Sergi, was equally convinced that the\r\npicture was a myth, that such Aryans never existed, that \"the true\r\nprimitive Aryans were not long, but round-headed, not fair but dark, not\r\ntall but short, and are in fact to-day best represented by the\r\nround-headed Kelts, Slavs, and South Germans[1003].\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Aryan prototype has vanished as completely as has\r\nthe Aryan mother-tongue, and can be conjecturally restored only by\r\nprocesses analogous to those by which Schleicher and other philologists\r\nhave endeavoured with dubious success to restore the organic Aryan\r\nspeech as constituted before the dispersion.\r\n\r\nBut here arises the more important question, by what right are so many\r\nand such diverse peoples grouped together and ticketed \"Caucasians\"? Are\r\nthey to be really taken as objectively one, or are they merely\r\nartificial groupings, arbitrarily arranged abstractions? Certainly this\r\nCaucasic division consists apparently of the most heterogeneous\r\nelements, more so than perhaps any other. Hence it seems to require a\r\nstrong mental effort to sweep into a single category, however elastic,\r\nso many different peoples--Europeans, North Africans, West Asiatics,\r\nIranians and others all the way to the Indo-Gangetic plains and uplands,\r\nwhose complexion presents every shade of colour, except yellow, from\r\nwhite to the deepest brown or even black.\r\n\r\nBut they are grouped together in a single division, because of certain\r\ncommon characteristics, and because, as pointed out by Ehrenreich, who\r\nhimself emphasises these objections, their substantial uniformity speaks\r\nto the eye that sees below the surface. At the first glance, except\r\nperhaps in a few extreme cases for which it would be futile to create\r\nindependent categories, we recognise a common racial stamp in the facial\r\nexpression, the structure of the hair, partly also the bodily\r\nproportions, in all of which points they agree more with each other than\r\nwith the other main divisions. Even in the case of certain black or very\r\ndark races, such as the Beja, Somali, and a few other Eastern Hamites,\r\nwe are reminded instinctively more of Europeans or Berbers than of\r\nnegroes, thanks to their more regular features and brighter expression.\r\n\"Those who will accept nothing unless it can be measured, weighed, and\r\nnumbered, may think perhaps that according to modern notions this appeal\r\nto the outward expression is unscientific. Nevertheless nobody can deny\r\nthe evidence of the obvious physical differences between Caucasians,\r\nAfrican Negroes, Mongols, Australians and so on. After all, physical\r\nanthropology itself dates only from the moment when we became conscious\r\nof these differences, even before we were able to give them exact\r\nexpression by measurements. It was precisely the general picture that\r\nspoke powerfully and directly to the eye[1004].\" The argument need not\r\nhere be pursued farther, as it will receive abundant illustration in the\r\ndetails to follow.\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of the New and the Austral Worlds, the Caucasic\r\ndivision as represented by the chief European nations has received an\r\nenormous expansion. Here of course it is necessary to distinguish\r\nbetween political and ethnical conquests, as, for instance, those of\r\nIndia, held by military tenure, and of Australia by actual settlement.\r\nPolitically the whole world has become Caucasic with the exception of\r\nhalf-a-dozen states such as China, Turkey, Japan, Siam, Marocco, still\r\nenjoying a real or fictitious autonomy. But, from the ethnical\r\nstandpoint, those regions in which the Caucasic peoples can establish\r\nthemselves and perpetuate their race as colonists are alone to be\r\nregarded as fresh accessions to the original and later (historical)\r\nCaucasic domains. Such fresh accessions are however of vast extent,\r\nincluding the greater part of Siberia and adjoining regions, where Slav\r\nbranches of the Aryan-speaking peoples are now founding permanent new\r\nhomes; the whole of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand, which have\r\nbecome the inheritance of the Caucasic inhabitants of the British Isles;\r\nlarge tracts in South Africa, already occupied by settlers chiefly from\r\nHolland and Great Britain; lastly the New World, where most of the\r\nnorthern continent is settled by full-blood Europeans, mainly British,\r\nFrench and German, while in the rest (Central and South America) the\r\nCaucasic immigrants (chiefly from the Iberian peninsula) have formed new\r\nethnical groups by fusion with the aborigines. These new accessions, all\r\nacquired within the last 400 years, may be roughly estimated at about 28\r\nmillion square miles, which with some 12 millions held throughout the\r\nhistoric period (Africa north of Sudan, most of Europe, South-West and\r\nparts of Central and South Asia, Indonesia) gives an extent of 40\r\nmillion square miles to the present Caucasic domain, either actually\r\noccupied or in process of settlement. As the whole of the dry land\r\nscarcely exceeds 52 millions, this leaves not more than about 12\r\nmillions for the now reduced domains of all the other divisions, and\r\neven of this a great part (_e.g._ Tibetan table-land, Gobi, tundras,\r\nGreenland) is barely or not at all inhabitable. This, it may be\r\nincidentally remarked, is perhaps the best reply to those who have in\r\nlate years given expression to gloomy forebodings regarding the ultimate\r\nfate of the Caucasic races. The \"yellow scare\" may be dismissed with the\r\nreflection that the Caucasian populations, who have inherited or\r\nacquired nearly four-fifths of the earth's surface besides the absolute\r\ndominion of the high seas, is not destined to be submerged by any\r\nconceivable combination of all the other elements, still less by the\r\nMongol alone[1005].\r\n\r\nWhere have we to seek the primeval home of this most vigorous and\r\ndominant branch of the human family? Since no direct evidence can be\r\ncited, the answer necessarily takes the form of a hypothesis, and must\r\nrely mainly on the indirect evidence supplied by our vague knowledge of\r\ngeographical conditions in pleistocene times, on past and present\r\nzoological distributions, with here and there, the assistance of a hint\r\ngleaned from archaeological discoveries. We may deal first with the\r\narguments brought forward in favour of Africa north of Sudan. Here were\r\nfound in quaternary times all the physical elements which zoologists\r\ndemand for great specialisations--ample space, a favourable climate and\r\nabundance of food, besides continuous land connection at two or three\r\npoints across the Mediterranean, by which the pliocene and early\r\npleistocene faunas moved freely between the two continents.\r\n\r\nMany of the speculations on the subject failed to convince, largely\r\nbecause the writers took, so to say, the ground from under their own\r\nfeet, by submerging most of the land under a vast \"Quaternary Sahara\r\nSea,\" which had no existence, and which, moreover, reduced the whole of\r\nNorth Africa to a Mauretanian island, a mere \"appendix of Europe,\" as it\r\nis in one place expressly called. Then this inconvenient inland basin\r\nwas got rid of, not by an outflow--being on the same level as the\r\nAtlantic, of which it was, in fact figured as an inlet--but by\r\n\"evaporation,\" which process is however somehow confined to this inlet,\r\nand does not affect either the Mediterranean or the Atlantic itself. Nor\r\nis it explained how the oceanic waters were prevented from rushing in\r\naccording \"as the Sahara sea evaporated to become a desert.\" The attempt\r\nto evolve a \"Eurafrican race\" in such an impossible area necessarily\r\nbroke down, other endless perplexities being involved in the initial\r\ngeological misconception.\r\n\r\nNot only was the Sahara dry land in pleistocene times, but it stood then\r\nat a considerably higher altitude than at present, although its mean\r\nelevation is still estimated by Chavanne at 1500 feet above sea-level.\r\n\"Quaternary deposits cover wide areas, and were at one time supposed to\r\nbe of marine origin. It was even held that the great sand dunes must\r\nhave been formed under the sea; but at this date it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to discuss such a view. The advocates of a Quaternary Sahara\r\nSea argued chiefly from the discovery of marine shells at several points\r\nin the middle of the Sahara. But Tournouer has shown that to call in the\r\naid of a great ocean in order to explain the presence of one or two\r\nshells is a needless expenditure of energy[1006].\"\r\n\r\nAt an altitude of probably over 2000 feet the Sahara must have enjoyed\r\nan almost ideal climate during late pliocene and pleistocene times, when\r\nEurope was exposed to more than one glacial invasion, and to a large\r\nextent covered at long intervals by a succession of solid ice-caps. We\r\nnow know that these stony and sandy wastes were traversed in all\r\ndirections by great rivers, such as the Massarawa trending south to the\r\nNiger, or the Igharghar[1007] flowing north to the Mediterranean, and\r\nthat these now dry beds may still be traced for hundreds of miles by\r\nchains of pools or lakelets, by long eroded valleys and by other\r\nindications of the action of running waters.\r\n\r\nNor could there be any lack of vegetable or animal life in a favoured\r\nregion, which was thus abundantly supplied with natural irrigation\r\narteries, while the tropical heats were tempered by great elevation and\r\nat times by the refreshing breezes from sub-arctic Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom these well-watered and fertile lands, some of which continued even\r\nin Roman times to be the granary of the empire, came that succession of\r\nsouthern animals--hippopotamus, hyaena, rhinoceros, elephant,\r\ncave-lion--which made Europe seem like a \"zoological appendix of\r\nAfrica.\" In association with this fauna may have come man himself, for\r\nalthough North Africa has not yet yielded evidence of a widespread\r\nculture comparable to that of the Palaeolithic Age in Europe, yet the\r\nnegroid characters of the Grimaldi skeletons have been held to prove an\r\nearly connection between the opposite shores of the Mediterranean. The\r\nhypothesis of African origin is supported by archaeological evidence of\r\nthe presence of early man all over North Africa from the shores of the\r\nMediterranean through Egypt to Somaliland. Thus one of J. de Morgan's\r\nmomentous conclusions was that the existence of civilised men in Egypt\r\nmight be reckoned by thousands, and of the aborigines by myriads of\r\nyears. These aborigines he identified with the men of the Old Stone Age,\r\nof whom he believed four stations to have been discovered--Dahshur,\r\nAbydos, Tukh, and Thebes[1008].\r\n\r\nOf Tunisia Arsene Dumont declared that \"the immense period of time\r\nduring which man made use of stone implements is nowhere so strikingly\r\nshown.\" Here some of the flints were found in abundance under a thick\r\nbed of quaternary limestone deposited by the waters of a stream that has\r\ndisappeared. Hence \"the origin of man in Mauretania must be set back to\r\na remote age which deranges all chronology and confounds the very fables\r\nof the mythologies[1009].\"\r\n\r\nThe skeleton found in 1914 by Hans Reck at Oldoway (then German East\r\nAfrica) was claimed to be of Pleistocene Age, but according to A. Keith\r\n\"the evidence ... cannot be accepted as having finally proved this\r\ndegree of antiquity[1010].\"\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the specialisation of the dolichocephalic European types\r\nin Africa, before their migrations northwards, lies at the base of\r\nSergi's views regarding the African origin of those types. Arguing\r\nagainst the Asiatic origin of the Hamites, as held by Prichard, Virchow,\r\nSayce and others, he points out that this race, scarcely if at all\r\nrepresented in Asia, has an immense range in Africa, where its several\r\nsub-varieties must have been evolved before their dispersion over a\r\ngreat part of that continent and of Europe. Then, regarding Hamites and\r\nSemites as essentially one, he concludes that Africa is the cradle\r\nwhence this primitive stock \"spread northwards to Europe, where it still\r\npersists, especially in the Mediterranean and its three principal\r\npeninsulas, and eastwards to West Asia[1011].\"\r\n\r\nThe theory of an African cradle for the dolichocephalic Mediterranean\r\ntype does not lack supporters, but when, relying on the undeniable\r\npresence of brachycephals, some writers would derive the Alpine type\r\nfrom the same area, the larger aspect of continental migrations appears\r\nto be overlooked (see pp. 451-2 below). To constitute a distinct race,\r\nsays Zaborowski, a wide geographical area is needed, such as is\r\npresented by both shores of the Mediterranean \"with the whole of North\r\nAfrica including the Sahara, which was till lately still thickly\r\npeopled[1012].\" Then to the question by whom has this North African and\r\nMediterranean region been inhabited since quaternary times, he answers\r\n\"by the ancestors of our Libyans, Egyptians, Pelasgians, Iberians\"; and\r\nafter rejecting the Asiatic theory, he elsewhere arrives at \"the grand\r\ngeneralisation that the whole of North Africa, connected by land with\r\nEurope in the Quaternary epoch, formed part of the geographical area of\r\nthe ancient white race, of which the Egyptians, so far from being the\r\nparent stem, would appear to be merely a branch[1013].\"\r\n\r\nComing to details, Bertholon[1014], from the human remains found by\r\nCarton at Bulla-Regia, determined for Tunisia and surrounding lands two\r\nmain long-headed types, one like the Neandertal (occurring both in\r\nKhumeria, and in the stations abounding in palaeoliths), the other like\r\nthe later Cro-Magnon dolmen-builders, whom De Quatrefages had already\r\nidentified with the tall, long-headed, fair, and even blue-eyed Berbers\r\nstill met in various parts of Mauretania, and formerly represented in\r\nthe Canary Islands[1015]. Bertholon agrees with Collignon that the\r\nMauretanian megalith-builders are of the same race as those of Europe,\r\nand besides the two long-headed races describes (1) a short\r\nround-headed type in Gerba Island and East Tunisia[1016] representing\r\nthe Libyans proper, and (2) a blond type of the Sahel, Khumeria, and\r\nother parts, whom he identifies with the Mazices of Herodotus, with the\r\n\"Afri,\" whose name has been extended to the whole continent, and the\r\nblond Getulians of the Aures Mountains.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that, as established by de Lapouge and Ripley,\r\nthere are three distinct ethnical zones in Europe:--(1) Nordic: the\r\ntall, fair, long-headed northern type, commonly identified by the\r\nGermans with the race represented by the osseous remains from the\r\n\"Reihengraeber,\" _i.e._ the \"Germanic,\" which the French call Kymric or\r\nAryan, for which de Lapouge reserves Linne's _Homo europaeus_, and to\r\nwhich Ripley applies the term \"Teutonic,\" because the whole combination\r\nof characters \"accords exactly with the descriptions handed down to us\r\nby the ancients. Such were the Goths, Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Vandals,\r\nLombards, together with the Danes, Norsemen, Saxons.... History is thus\r\ncorroborated by natural science.\" (2) Mediterranean: the southern zone\r\nof short, dark, long-heads, _i.e._ the primitive element in Iberia,\r\nItaly, South France, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, and Greece, called\r\nIberians by the English, and identified by many with the Ligurians,\r\nPelasgians, and allied peoples, grouped together by Ripley as\r\nMediterraneans[1017]. (3) Alpine: the central zone of short,\r\nmedium-sized round-heads with light or chestnut hair, and gray or hazel\r\neye, de Lapouge's and Ripley's _Homo alpinus_, the Kelts or Kelto-Slavs\r\nof the French, the Ligurians or Arvernians of Beddoe and other English\r\nwriters. Here belong the tall Armenoids, the Armenians being descendants\r\nof the Hittites.\r\n\r\nThe question is, Can all these have come from North Africa? We have\r\nseen that this region has yielded the remains of one round-headed and\r\ntwo long-headed prehistoric types. Henri Malbot pointed out that, as far\r\nback as we can go, we meet the two quite distinct long-headed Berber\r\ntypes, and he holds that this racial duality is proved by the megalithic\r\ntombs (dolmens) of Roknia between Jemmapes and Guelma, possibly some\r\n4000 or 5000 years old. The remains here found by L. L. C. Faidherbe\r\nbelong to two different races, both dolichocephalic, but one tall, with\r\nprominent zygomatic arches and very strong nasal spine (it reads almost\r\nlike the description of a brawny Caledonian), the other short, with\r\nwell-balanced skull and small nasal spine[1018]. The earliest (Egyptian)\r\nrecords refer to brown and blond populations living in North Africa some\r\n5000 years ago, and it has been claimed that the raw materials, so to\r\nsay, were here to hand both of the fair northern and dark southern\r\nEuropean long-heads.\r\n\r\nThese different races were represented even amongst the extinct Guanches\r\nof the Canary Islands, as shown by a study of the 52 heads procured in\r\n1894 by H. Meyer from caves in the archipelago[1019]. Three distinct\r\ntypes are determined: (1) Guanche, akin to the Cro-Magnon, tall (5 ft. 8\r\nin. to 6 ft. 2 in.), robust, dolicho (78), low, broad face; large eyes,\r\nrather short nose; fair, reddish or light chestnut hair; skin and eyes\r\nlight; ranged throughout the islands, but centred chiefly in Tenerife;\r\n(2) \"_Semitic_,\" short (5 ft. 4 or 5 in.), slim, narrow mesocephalic\r\nhead (81), narrow, long face, black hair, light brown skin, dark eyes;\r\nrange, Grand Canary, Palma, and Hierro; (3) _Armenoid_, akin to von\r\nLuschan's pre-Semitic of Asia Minor; shorter than 1 and 2; very short,\r\nbroad, and high skull (hyperbrachy, 84); hair, skin and eyes very\r\nprobably of the West Asiatic brunette type; range, mainly in Gomera, but\r\nmet everywhere. Many of the skulls had been trepanned, and these are\r\nbrought into direct association with the full-blood Berbers of the\r\nAures Mts. in Algeria, who still practise trepanning for wounds,\r\nheadaches, and other reasons. This type is scarcely to be distinguished\r\nfrom Lapouge's short brown _Homo alpinus_, which dates from the Stone\r\nAges, and is found in densest masses in the Central Alpine regions, but\r\nthe true Armenoids are differentiated by their taller stature[1020].\r\n\r\nHow numerous were the inhabitants of France at that time may be inferred\r\nfrom the long list of no less than 4000 neolithic stations given for\r\nthat region by Ph. Salmon. Of the 688 skulls from those stations\r\nmeasured by him, 57.7 per cent. are classed as dolicho, 21.2 as\r\nbrachycephalic, and 21.1 as intermediate. This distinguished\r\npalethnologist regards the intermediates as the result of crossings\r\nbetween the two others, and of these he thinks the first arrivals were\r\nthe round-heads, who ranged over a vast area between Brittany, the\r\nChannel, the Pyrenees, and the Mediterranean, 60 per cent. of the graves\r\nhitherto studied containing skulls of this type[1021]. Belgium also,\r\nwhere a mixture of long- and round-heads is found amongst the men of\r\nFurfooz, must be included in this neolithic brachy domain, which can be\r\ntraced as far westward as the British Isles[1022]. Attempts have been\r\nmade, as indicated above, to derive these brachycephals, as well as the\r\ndolichocephals, from North Africa, in accordance with the view that the\r\nlatter region was the true centre of evolution and of dispersion for all\r\nthe main branches of the Caucasic family, but this theory has few\r\nsupporters at the present time. Sergi recognised the Asiatic origin of\r\nthe neolithic round-heads and regarded them as \"peaceful\r\ninfiltrations[1023],\" forerunners of the great invasions of the later\r\nMetal Ages. Verneau points out[1024] that when all the neolithic\r\nstations in which brachycephalic skulls have been discovered are plotted\r\nout on a map of Europe it is easy to recognise a current running almost\r\ndirectly from east to west. Moreover towards the west this current\r\ndivides, being clearly separated by zones of dolichocephaly.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the presence in early times of tall blond peoples in Africa,\r\nside by side with a short dark population, and of brachycephals together\r\nwith dolichocephals, proves that even in the Stone Age ethnic mixtures\r\nhad already taken place, and racial purity--if indeed it ever\r\nexisted--must be sought for in still remoter periods.\r\n\r\nWith Sergi's view which traces the neolithic inhabitants of the northern\r\nshores of the Mediterranean (Iberians, Ligurians, Messapians, Siculi and\r\nother Itali, Pelasgians), to North Africa, most anthropologists\r\nagree[1025]. Also that all or most of these were primarily of a dark\r\n(brown), short, dolicho type, which still persists both in South Europe\r\nand North Africa, and in fact is the race which Ripley properly calls\r\n\"Mediterranean,\" although in the west they almost certainly ranged into\r\nBrittany and the British Isles. But there are some who hold that the\r\nmigration was in the opposite direction, and derive the North African\r\nbranch from Europe, rather than the European branches from Africa.\r\n\"Anthropologists who have specially studied the question of the Berbers\r\nor Kabyles have concluded that they are descendants of prehistoric\r\nEuropean invaders who occupied the tracts that suited them best[1026].\"\r\nIn France the neolithic \"Mediterranean type\" has been regarded as\r\nlineally descended from palaeolithic predecessors _in situ_[1027]. Some\r\nwould even go further still, and claim Europe as the place of origin not\r\nonly of the Mediterranean but also of the Alpine and Northern branches.\r\n\"The so-called three races of Europe are in the main the result of\r\nvariation from a common European stock, a variation due to isolation and\r\nnatural selection[1028].\"\r\n\r\nWithout making any claim to finality the following perhaps best\r\nrepresents orthodox opinion at the present time. It may be assumed that\r\nman evolved somewhere in Southern Asia in pliocene times, and that the\r\nearly groups possessed a tendency to variability which was directed to\r\nsome extent by geographical conditions and became fixed by isolation.\r\nThe tall fair blue-eyed dolichocephals (Northern Race) and the short\r\ndark dolichocephals (Mediterranean Race) may be regarded as two\r\nvarieties of a common stock, the former having their area of\r\ncharacterisation in the steppes north of the plateaus of Eur-Asia, and\r\nmigrating eastwards and westwards as the country dried after the last\r\nglacial phase. The southern branch, entering East Africa from Southern\r\nAsia, spread all over North Africa; those in the east were the archaic\r\nEgyptians; to the west were the Libyans whose descendants are the\r\nBerbers; those who crossed the Mediterranean formed the European\r\nbranches of the Mediterranean race. With regard to the third type, while\r\nthe central plateaus of Asia were the centre of dispersal for the true\r\nMongols the western plateaus were the area of characterisation of a\r\nnon-Mongolian brachycephalic race, which includes short and tall\r\nvarieties. This is the Alpine race, which extends from the Hindu Kush to\r\nBrittany, and formerly spread further westwards into the British\r\nIsles[1029].\r\n\r\nThe problem of European origins has often in the past been obscured\r\nrather than enlightened by an appeal to linguistics, but linguistic\r\nfactors cannot altogether be ignored. No doubt the earliest populations\r\nof the Mediterranean shores during the Stone Age spoke non-Aryan\r\nlanguages, but it is only here and there that traces--mostly\r\nindecipherable--can be discovered. On the African side we have the\r\nBerber language still in its full vigour; and apparently little changed\r\nfor thousands of years. But in Europe the primitive tongues have\r\neverywhere been swept away by the Aryan (Hellenic, Italic, Keltic)\r\nexcept in the region of the Pyrenees. In Italy Etruscan is the only\r\nlanguage which can with safety be called non-Aryan[1030], though the\r\nplace of Ligurian is still under dispute[1031]. Of Pelasgian, nothing\r\nsurvives except the statement of Herodotus, a dangerous guide in this\r\nmatter, that it was a barbaric tongue like the peoples themselves[1032],\r\nbut Ridgeway considers it Indo-European[1033]. Further east, in Asia\r\nMinor, neither Karian inscriptions and glosses nor occasional\r\nLydian[1034] and Mysian glosses afford any safe basis for establishing\r\nrelationships[1035]; the fuller evidence of Lycian leaves its position\r\nindeterminate[1036] and the Cretan script is still undeciphered[1037].\r\n\r\nBut in Iberia besides the Iberian inscriptions, which, so far, remain\r\nindecipherable[1038], there survives the Basque of the western Pyrenees,\r\nwhich beyond question represents a form of speech which was current in\r\nthe peninsula in pre-Aryan times, and on the assumption of a common\r\norigin of the populations on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar might\r\nbe expected to show traces of kinship with Berber. In a posthumous work\r\non this subject[1039], the eminent philologist G. von der Gabelenz goes\r\nmuch further than mere traces, and claims to establish not only phonetic\r\nand verbal resemblances, but structural correspondences, so that his\r\neditor Graf von der Schulenberg was satisfied as to the relationship of\r\nthe two languages[1040]. This conclusion has not, however, met with\r\ngeneral acceptance[1041] and the affinities of Basque with Finno-Ugrian\r\ncannot be overlooked[1042]. A study of the physical features of the\r\nmodern Basques adds complexity to the problem. Most observers are agreed\r\nthat a distinct Basque type exists, and this physical and linguistic\r\nsingularity has led to various more or less fanciful theories\r\n\"connecting the Basques with every outlandish language and bankrupt\r\npeople under the sun[1043],\" while G. Herve[1044] would regard them as\r\nforming by themselves a separate ethnic group, \"a fourth European race.\"\r\nOn the other hand Feist[1045] has grounds for claiming that the Basques\r\nare not, in anthropological respects, essentially different from their\r\nSpanish or French neighbours (p. 357) and Jullian[1046] denies them more\r\nthan a superficial unity. These apparently conflicting opinions are\r\nreconciled by the conclusions of R. Collignon[1047], himself one of the\r\nbest authorities on the subject. \"The physical traits characteristic of\r\nthe Basques attach them unquestionably ('indiscutablement') to the great\r\nHamitic branch of the white races, that is to say, to the ancient\r\nEgyptians and to the various groups commonly comprised under the\r\ncollective name of Berbers. Their brachycephaly, slight as it is, cannot\r\noutweigh the aggregate of the other characters which they present.... It\r\nis therefore in this direction and not amongst Finns or Esthonians that\r\nis to be sought the parent stem of this paradoxical race. It is North\r\nAfrican or European, assuredly not Asiatic.\" Collignon's explanation of\r\nthe Basque type is that it is a sub-species of the Mediterranean stock\r\nevolved by long-continued and complete isolation, and in-and-in\r\nbreeding, primarily engendered by peculiarity of language. The effects\r\nof heredity, aided perhaps by artificial selection, have generated local\r\npeculiarities and have developed them to an extreme[1048].\r\n\r\n\"The Iberian question,\" says Rice Holmes, \"is the most complicated and\r\ndifficult of all the problems of Gallic ethnology[1049].\" From the\r\ntestimony of Greek and Roman authors, he draws the following\r\nconclusions. \"The name Iberian was probably applied, in the first\r\ninstance, only to the people who dwelt between the Ebro and the\r\nPyrenees. The Iberians once occupied the seaboard of Gaul between the\r\nRhone and the Pyrenees; but Ligurians encroached upon this part of their\r\nterritory. They also probably occupied the whole eastern region of the\r\nSpanish peninsula. But,\" he adds, \"we must bear in mind that the data\r\nare both insufficient and uncertain\" (p. 288). Later (p. 301), reviewing\r\nthe evidence collected by philologists and by craniologists, he\r\ncontinues, \"it seems to me probable that the Iberians comprised both\r\npeople who spoke, or whose ancestors had spoken, Basque, and people who\r\nspoke the language or languages[1050] of the 'Iberian' inscriptions;\r\nthat to observers who had not learned to measure skulls and knew nothing\r\nof scientific methods, they appeared to be homogeneous; that the\r\nprevailing type was that which is now called Iberian and is seen at its\r\npurest in Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily; but that a certain proportion of\r\nthe whole population may have been characterised by physical features\r\nmore or less closely resembling those which the modern Basques--French\r\nand Spanish--possess in common, and which, as MM. Broca and Collignon\r\ntell us, distinguish them from all other European peoples. Finally it\r\nseems probable that the true Iberians were the people who spoke the\r\nlanguages of the inscriptions, and that Basque was spoken by a people\r\nwho occupied Spain and Southern Gaul before the Iberians arrived. But\r\nunless and until the key to those appalling inscriptions is found, the\r\nproblem will never be solved.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ligurian question is still more complex than the Iberian. For while\r\nno facts can be brought forward in direct contradiction of the\r\nassumption that the Iberians were a short dark dolichocephalic\r\npopulation occupying the Iberian peninsula in the Stone Age, and\r\nspeaking a non-Indo-European language, no such generalisations with\r\nregard to race, physical type, culture, geographical distribution or\r\nlanguage are accepted for the Ligurians. Some, with Sergi[1051],\r\nconsider the Ligurians merely as another branch of the Mediterranean\r\nrace. Others, with Zaborowski[1052], tracing their presence among the\r\nmodern inhabitants of Liguria, regard them as representing the small,\r\ndark, brachycephalic race at its purest. While many who recognise the\r\nLigurians as belonging to the Mediterranean physical type deny their\r\naffinity with the Iberians. Meyer[1053] considers such a relationship\r\n\"not improbable,\" but Dechelette[1054] shows that it is absolutely\r\nuntenable on archaeological grounds. The geographical range is equally\r\nuncertain. C. Jullian[1055] distributes Ligurians not only over the\r\nwhole of Gaul, but also throughout Western Europe, and attributes to\r\nthem all the glories of neolithic civilisation; A. Bertrand[1056] thinks\r\nthat they played even in Gaul merely a secondary role; Dechelette[1057],\r\non archaeological evidence, proves that the Ligurian period was _par\r\nexcellence_ the Age of Bronze, and Ridgeway[1058] identifies it with the\r\nTerramare civilisation. Finally, if we follow Sergi, the Ligurians must\r\nhave spoken a non-Indo-European language; but the most eminent\r\nauthorities are in the main agreed that such traces of Ligurian as\r\nremain show affinities with Indo-European[1059]. With regard to their\r\nphysical type Sergi puts forward the view that the true Ligurians were\r\nlike the Iberians, a section of the long-headed Mediterranean\r\n(Afro-European) stock. From prehistoric stations in the valley of the Po\r\nhe collected 59 skulls, all of this type, and all Ligurian; history and\r\ntradition being of accord that before the arrival of the Kelts this\r\nregion belonged to the Ligurian domain. \"If it be true that prehistoric\r\nItaly was occupied by the Mediterranean race and by two\r\nbranches--Ligurian and Pelasgian--of that race, the ancient inhabitants\r\nof the Po valley, now exhumed in those 59 skulls, were Ligurian[1060].\"\r\n\r\nThese Ligurians have been traced from their homes on the Mediterranean\r\ninto Central Europe. From a study of the neolithic finds made in\r\nGermany, in the district between Neustadt and Worms, C. Mehlis[1061]\r\ninfers that here the first settlers were Ligurians, who had penetrated\r\nup the Rhone and Saone into Rhineland. In the Kircherian Museum in Rome\r\nhe was surprised to find a marked analogy between objects from the\r\nRiviera and from the Rhine; skulls (both dolicho), vases, stone\r\nimplements, mill-stones, etc., all alike. Such Ligurian objects, found\r\neverywhere in North Italy, occur in the Rhine lands chiefly along the\r\nleft bank of the main stream between Basel and Mainz, and farther north\r\nin the Rheingau at Wiesbaden, and in the Lahn valley.\r\n\r\nThe Ligurians may of course have reached the Riviera round the coast\r\nfrom Illiberis and Iberia; but the same race is found as the aboriginal\r\nelement also at the \"heel of the boot,\" and in fact throughout the whole\r\nof Italy and all the adjacent islands. This point is now firmly\r\nestablished, and not only Sergi, but several other leading Italian\r\nauthorities hold that the early inhabitants of the peninsula and islands\r\nwere Ligurians and Pelasgians, whom they look upon as of the same stock,\r\nall of whom came from North Africa, and that, despite subsequent\r\ninvasions and crossings, this Mediterranean stock still persists,\r\nespecially in the southern provinces and in the islands--Sicily,\r\nSardinia, and Corsica. Hence it seems more reasonable to bring this\r\naboriginal element straight from Africa by the stepping stones of\r\nPantellaria, Malta, and Gozzo (formerly more extensive than at present,\r\nand still strewn with megalithic remains comparable to those of both\r\ncontinents), than by the roundabout route of Iberia and Southern\r\nGaul[1062]. This is a simple solution of the problem, but it is a\r\nquestion if it is justifiable to extend the name Ligurian to all that\r\nbranch of the Mediterranean race which undoubtedly forms the substratum\r\nof population in Italy and parts of Gaul, ignoring the presence or\r\nabsence of \"Ligurian\" culture or traces of Ligurian language.\r\nDechelette[1063], relying chiefly upon archaeological and cultural\r\nevidence, sums up as follows: we must consider the Ligurians as\r\nIndo-European tribes, whose area of domination had its centre, during\r\nthe Bronze Age, in North Italy, and the left bank of the Rhone. They\r\nwere enterprising and energetic in agriculture and in commerce. Together\r\nwith neighbouring peoples of Illyrian stock they engaged in an indirect\r\nbut nevertheless regular trade with the northern regions where amber was\r\ncollected. Among the Ligurians, as among the Illyrians and Hyperboreans,\r\na form of heliolatry was prevalent, popularising the old solar myths in\r\nwhich the swan appears to have played an important role. Rice\r\nHolmes[1064] defines more closely their geographical range. \"Ligurians\r\nundoubtedly lived in South-eastern Gaul, where they were found at least\r\nas far north as Bellegarde in the department of the Ain; and, mingled\r\nmore or less with Iberians, in the departments of the Gard, Herault,\r\nAude and Pyrenees-Orientales. Most probably they had once occupied the\r\nwhole eastern region as far north as the Marne, but had been submerged\r\nby Celts: and perhaps they had also pushed westward as far as\r\nAquitania.\" He continues, \"Were it possible to regard the theory of MM.\r\nd'Arbois de Jubainville and Jullian as more than an interesting\r\nhypothesis, we should have to conclude that the Ligurians were simply\r\nthe long-headed and short-headed peoples who, reinforced perhaps from\r\ntime to time by hordes of immigrants, had inhabited the whole of Gaul\r\nsince the Neolithic Age, and of whom the former, or many of them, were\r\ndescended from palaeolithic hunters; in other words that they were the\r\nsame people who, after they had been conquered by, or had coalesced\r\nwith, the Celtic invaders, called themselves _Celtae_: but to say which\r\nof them were first known as Ligurians or introduced the Ligurian\r\nlanguage would be utterly hopeless. Finally the little evidence we\r\npossess tends to show that the people called Ligurians, when they became\r\nknown to the Greek writers who described them, were a medley of\r\ndifferent races.\"\r\n\r\nFor Sicily, with which may practically be included the south of Italy,\r\nwe have the conclusions of G. Patroni based on years of intelligent and\r\npatient labours[1065]. To Africa this archaeologist traces the\r\npalaeolithic men of the west coast of Sicily and of the caves near\r\nSyracuse explored by Von Adrian[1066]. \"We are forced to conclude that\r\nman arrived in Sicily from Africa at a time when the isthmus connecting\r\nthe island with that Continent still stood above sea-level. He made his\r\nappearance about the same time as the elephant, whose remains are\r\nassociated with human bones especially in the west. He followed the sea\r\ncoasts, the shells of which offered him sufficient food[1067].\" He was\r\nfollowed by the neolithic man, whose presence has been revealed by the\r\nresearches of Paolo Orsi at the station of Stentinello on the coast\r\nnorth of Syracuse.\r\n\r\nTo Orsi is also due the discovery of what he calls the \"Aeneolithic\r\nEpoch[1068],\" represented by the bronzes of the Girgenti district. Orsi\r\nassigns this culture to the _Siculi_, and divides it into three periods,\r\nwhile regarding the neolithic men of Stentinello as _pre-Siculi_. But\r\nPatroni holds that the aeneolithic peoples have a right to the historic\r\nname of _Sicani_, and that the true Siculi were those that arrived from\r\nItaly in Orsi's second period. It seems no longer possible to determine\r\nthe true relations of these two peoples, who stand out as distinct\r\nthroughout early historic times. They are by many[1069] regarded as of\r\none race, although both ([Greek: Sikanos, Sikelos]) are already\r\nmentioned in the Odyssey. But the evidence tends to show that the Sicani\r\nrepresent the oldest element which came direct from Africa in the Stone\r\nAge, while the Siculi were a branch of the Ligurians driven in the Metal\r\nAge from Italy to the island, which was already occupied by the Sicani,\r\nas related by Dionysius Halicarnassus[1070]. In fact this migration of\r\nthe Siculi may be regarded as almost an historical event, which\r\naccording to Thucydides took place \"about 300 years before the Hellenes\r\ncame to Sicily[1071].\" The Siculi bore this national name on the\r\nmainland, so that the modern expression \"Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\"\r\n(the late Kingdom of Naples) has its justification in the earliest\r\ntraditions of the people. Later, both races were merged in one, and the\r\npresent Sicilian nation was gradually constituted by further accessions\r\nof Phoenician (Carthaginian), Greek, Roman, Vandal, Arab, Norman, French\r\nand Spanish elements.\r\n\r\nVery remarkable is the contrast presented by the conditions prevailing\r\nin this ethnical microcosm and those of Sardinia, inhabited since the\r\nStone Ages by one of the most homogeneous groups in the world. From the\r\nstatistics embodied in R. Livi's _Antropologia Militare_[1072] the\r\nSards would almost seem to be cast all in one mould, the great bulk of\r\nthe natives having the shortest stature, the brownest eyes and hair, the\r\nlongest heads, the swarthiest complexion of all the Italian populations.\r\n\"They consequently form quite a distinct variety amongst the Italian\r\nraces, which is natural enough when we remember the seclusion in which\r\nthis island has remained for so many ages[1073].\" They seem to have been\r\npreserved as if in some natural museum to show us what the Ligurian\r\nbranch of the Mediterranean stock may have been in neolithic times. Yet\r\nthey were probably preceded by the microcephalous dwarfish race\r\ndescribed by Sergi as one of the early Mediterranean stocks. Their\r\npresence in Sardinia has now been determined by A. Niceforo and E. A.\r\nOnnis, who find that of about 130 skulls from old graves thirty have a\r\ncapacity of only 1150 c.c. or under, while several living persons range\r\nin height from 4 ft. 2 in. to 4 ft. 11 in. Niceforo agrees with Sergi in\r\nbringing this dwarfish race also from North Africa[1074].\r\n\r\nWith remarkable cranial uniformity, similar phenomena are presented by\r\nthe Corsicans who show \"the same exaggerated length of face and\r\nnarrowness of the forehead. The cephalic index drops from 87 and above\r\nin the Alps to about 75 all along the line. Coincidently the colour of\r\nhair and eyes becomes very dark, almost black. The figure is less amply\r\nproportioned, the people become light and rather agile. It is certain\r\nthat the stature at the same time falls to an exceedingly low level:\r\nfully 9 inches below the average for Teutonic Europe,\" although \"the\r\npeople of Northern Africa, pure Mediterranean Europeans, are of medium\r\nsize[1075].\"\r\n\r\nIn the Italian peninsula Sergi holds not only that the aborigines were\r\nexclusively of Ligurian, _i.e._ Mediterranean stock, but that this stock\r\nstill persists in the whole of the region south of the Tiber, although\r\nhere and there mixed with \"Aryan\" elements. North of that river these\r\nelements increase gradually up to the Italian Alps, and at present are\r\ndominant in the valley of the Po[1076]. In this way he would explain\r\nthe rising percentage of round-heads in that direction, the Ligurians\r\nbeing for him, as stated, long-headed, the \"Aryans\" round-headed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly Beddoe, commenting on Livi's statistics, showing predominance\r\nof tall stature, round heads, and fair complexion in North Italy, infers\r\n\"that a type, the one we usually call the Mediterranean, does really\r\npredominate in the south, and exists in a state of comparative purity in\r\nSardinia and Calabria; while in the north the broad-headed Alpine type\r\nis powerful, but is almost everywhere more or less modified by, or\r\ninterspersed with other types--Germanic, Slavic, or of doubtful\r\norigin--to which the variations of stature and complexion may probably\r\nbe, at least in part, attributed[1077].\"\r\n\r\nSimilar relations prevail in the Balkan peninsula, where the\r\nMediterranean stock is represented by the \"Pelasgic[1078]\" substratum.\r\nInvented, as has been said, for the purpose of confounding future\r\nethnologists, these Pelasgians certainly present an extremely difficult\r\nracial problem, the solution of which has hitherto resisted the combined\r\nattacks of ancient and modern students. When Dionysius tells us bluntly\r\nthat they were Greeks[1079], we fancy the question is settled off-hand,\r\nuntil we find Herodotus describing them a few hundred years earlier as\r\naliens, rude in speech and usages, distinctly not Greeks, and in his\r\ntime here and there (Thrace, Hellespont) still speaking apparently\r\nnon-Hellenic dialects[1080]. Then Homer several centuries still earlier,\r\nwith his epithet of [Greek: dioi], occurring both in the _Iliad_ and\r\nthe _Odyssey_[1081], exalts them almost above the level of the Greeks\r\nthemselves. It would seem, therefore, almost impossible to discover a\r\nkey to the puzzle, one which will also fit in both with Sergi's\r\nMediterranean theory, and with the results of recent archaeological\r\nresearches in the Aegean lands. The following hypothesis is supported by\r\na certain amount of evidence. If the pre-Mykenaean culture revealed by\r\nSchliemann and others in the Troad, Mykenae, Argos, Tiryns, by Evans and\r\nothers in Crete, by Cesnola in Cyprus, be ascribed to a pre-Hellenic\r\nrather than to a proto-Hellenic people, then the classical references\r\nwill explain themselves, while this pre-Hellenic race will be readily\r\nidentified with the Pelasgians, as this term is understood by Sergi.\r\n\r\nIt is, I suppose, universally allowed that Greece really was peopled\r\nbefore the arrival of the Hellenes, which term is here to be taken as\r\ncomprising all the invading tribes from the north, of which the Achaeans\r\nwere perhaps the earliest. On their arrival the Hellenes therefore found\r\nthe land not only inhabited, but inhabited by a cultured people more\r\ncivilised than themselves, who could thus be identified with Sergi's\r\nPelasgian branch of the Mediterranean or Afro-European stock, whom the\r\nproto-Hellenes naturally regarded as their superiors, and whom their\r\nfirst singers also naturally called [Greek: dioi Pelasgoi][1082]. But in\r\nthe course of a few centuries[1083] these Pelasgians became Hellenised,\r\nall but a few scattered groups, which lagging behind in the general\r\nsocial progress are now also looked upon as barbarians, speaking\r\nbarbaric tongues, and are so described by contemporary historians. Then\r\nthese few remnants of a glorious but forgotten past are also merged in\r\nthe Hellenic stream, and can no longer be distinguished from other\r\nGreeks by contemporary writers. Hence for Dionysius the Pelasgians are\r\nsimply Greeks, which in a sense may be true enough. All the\r\nheterogeneous elements have been fused in a single Hellenic nationality,\r\nbuilt upon a rough Pelasgic substratum, and adorned with all the graces\r\nof Hellenic culture.\r\n\r\nNow to make good this hypothesis, it is necessary to show, first, that\r\nthe Pelasgians were not an obscure tribe, a small people confined to\r\nsome remote corner of Hellas, but a widespread nation diffused over all\r\nthe land; secondly, that this nation, as far as can now be determined,\r\npresented mental and other characters answering to those of Sergi's\r\nMediterraneans, and also such as might be looked for in a race capable\r\nof developing the splendid Aegean culture of pre-Hellenic times.\r\n\r\nOn the first point it has been claimed that the Pelasgians were so\r\nwidely distributed[1084] that the difficulty rather is to discover a\r\ndistrict where their presence was unknown. They fill the background of\r\nHellenic origins, and even spread beyond the Hellenic horizon, to such\r\nan extent that there seems little room for any other people between the\r\nAdriatic and the Hellespont. Thus Ridgeway[1085] has brought together a\r\ngood many passages which clearly establish their universal range, as\r\nwell as their occupation especially of those places where have been\r\nfound objects of Mykenaean and pre-Mykenaean culture, such as engraved\r\ngems, pottery, implements, buildings, inscriptions in pictographic and\r\nsyllabic scripts. In Crete they had the \"great city of Knossos\" in\r\nHomer's time[1086]; not only was Mykenae theirs, but the whole of\r\nPeloponnesus took the name of Pelasgia; the kings of Tiryns were\r\nPelasgians, and Aeschylus calls Argos a Pelasgian city; an old wall at\r\nAthens was attributed to them, and the people of Attica had from all\r\ntime been Pelasgians[1087]. Orchomenus in Boeotia was founded by a\r\ncolony from Pelasgiotis in Thessaly; Lesbos also was called Pelasgia,\r\nand Homer knew of Pelasgians in the Troad. Their settlements are further\r\ntraced to Egypt, to Rhodes, Cyprus, Epirus--where Dodona was their\r\nancient shrine--and lastly to various parts of Italy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Pelasgians were traditionally the civilising element, who\r\ntaught people to make bread, to yoke the ox to the plough, and to\r\nmeasure land. It would appear from these and other allusions that there\r\nwere memories of still earlier aborigines, amongst whom the Pelasgians\r\nappear as a cultured people, introducing perhaps the arts and industries\r\nof the pre-Mykenaean Age. But the assumption, based on no known data, is\r\nunnecessary, and it seems more reasonable to look on this culture as\r\nlocally developed, to some extent under eastern (Egyptian, Babylonian,\r\nHittite?) influences[1088]. Here it is important to note that the\r\nPelasgians were credited with a knowledge of letters[1089], and all this\r\nhas been advanced as sufficient confirmation of our second postulate.\r\nNevertheless it must be acknowledged that the difficulties are not all\r\novercome by this hypothesis, and the further question of language\r\ndivides even its stanchest supporters into opposing groups, for while\r\nSergi's Mediterraneans necessarily speak a non-Indo-European\r\nlanguage[1090], Ridgeway's Pelasgians speak Aeolic Greek[1091].\r\n\r\nThe range and importance of the Pelasgians are most strictly limited by\r\nJ. L. Myres[1092], who thinks that the Alpine type may even be primitive\r\nin the Morea, Mediterranean man being an intruder from the south merely\r\nfringing the coast and never penetrating inland. The researches of von\r\nLuschan in Lycia support this view[1093], and Ripley's map of the\r\npresent inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula shows the \"Greek contingent\r\nclosely confined to the sea-coast[1094].\" Ripley, however, though\r\ncarefully avoiding any dragging of \"Pelasgians\" into the question,\r\nassumes a primitive substratum of Mediterranean type all over Greece.\r\n\"The testimony of these ancient Greek crania is perfectly harmonious.\r\nAll authorities agree that the ancient Hellenes were decidedly\r\nlong-headed, betraying in this respect their affinity to the\r\nMediterranean Race.... Whether from Attica, from Schliemann's successive\r\ncities excavated upon the site of Troy, or from the coast of Asia\r\nMinor[1095]; at all times from 400 B.C. to the third century of our era,\r\nit would seem proved that the Greeks were of this dolichocephalic\r\ntype.... Every characteristic of their modern descendants and every\r\nanalogy with the neighbouring populations, leads us to the conclusion\r\nthat the classical Hellenes were distinctly of the Mediterranean racial\r\ntype, little different from the Phoenicians, the Romans or the\r\nIberians[1096].\" Nevertheless Doerpfeld[1097] claims that there were,\r\nfrom the first, two races in Greece, a Southern, or Aegean, and a\r\nNorthern, who were the Aryan Achaeans of history, and recent\r\narchaeological discoveries certainly support this view.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt to solve the Pelasgian problem is that of E.\r\nMeyer[1098]. After enumerating the various areas said to have been\r\noccupied by the Pelasgians \"_ein grosses Urvolk_\" who ranged from Asia\r\nMinor to Italy, he pricks the bubble by saying that in reality there\r\nwere no Pelasgians save in Thessaly, in the fruitful plain of Peneus,\r\nhence called \"Pelasgic Argos[1099],\" and later Pelasgiotis. They, like\r\nthe Dorians, invaded Crete from Thessaly and at the beginning of the\r\nfirst millennium were defeated and enslaved by the incoming Thessalians.\r\nThese are the only true Pelasgians. The other so-called Pelasgians are\r\nthe descendants of an eponymous Pelasgos who in genealogical poetry\r\nbecomes the ancestor of mankind. Since the Arcadians were regarded as\r\nthe earliest of the indigenous peoples, Pelasgos was made the ancestor\r\nof the Arcadians. The name \"Pelasgic Argos\" was transferred from\r\nThessaly to the Peloponnesian city. Attic Pelasgians were derived from a\r\nmistake of Hecataeus[1100]. So the legend grew. The only real Pelasgian\r\nproblem, concludes Meyer, is whether the Thessalian Pelasgians were a\r\nGreek or pre-Greek people, and he is inclined to favour the latter view.\r\nThe identity of \"the most mysterious people of antiquity\" is further\r\nobscured by philology, for, as P. Giles points out, their name appears\r\nmerely to mean \"the people of the sea,\" so that \"they do not seem to be\r\nin all cases the same stock[1101].\"\r\n\r\nWhether we call them Pelasgians or no, there would seem to be little\r\ndoubt that the splendours of Aegean civilisation which have been and\r\nstill are being gradually revealed by the researches of British,\r\nItalian, American and German archaeologists are to be attributed to an\r\nindigenous people of Mediterranean type, occupying an area of which\r\nCrete was the centre, from the Stone Age, right through the Bronze Age,\r\ndown to the Northern invasions of the second millennium and the\r\nintroduction of iron. In range this culture included Greece with its\r\nislands, Cyprus, and Western Anatolia, and its influence extended\r\nwestwards to Sicily, Italy, Sardinia and Spain, and eastwards to Syria\r\nand Egypt. Its chief characteristics are (1) an indigenous script both\r\npictographic and linear, with possible affinities in Hittite, Cypriote\r\nand South-west Anatolian scripts, but hitherto indecipherable; (2) a\r\ncharacteristic art attempting \"to express an ideal in forms more and\r\nmore closely approaching to realities[1102],\" exhibited in frescoes,\r\npottery, reliefs, sculptures, jewelry etc.; (3) a distinctive\r\narchitectural style, and (4) type of tomb, which have no parallels\r\nelsewhere. Excavations at Cnossos go far towards establishing a\r\nchronology for the Aegean area. At the base is an immensely thick\r\nneolithic deposit, above which come pottery and other objects of Minoan\r\nPeriod I. 1, which are correlated by Petrie with objects found at\r\nAbydos, referred by him to the 1st Dynasty (4000 B.C.). Minoan Period\r\nII. 2 corresponds with the Egyptian XII Dynasty (2500 B.C.),\r\ncharacteristic Cretan pottery of this period being found in the Fayum.\r\nMinoan Period III. 1 and 2 synchronises with Dynasty XVIII (1600 to\r\n1400 B.C.). Iron begins to be used for weapons after Period III. 3, and\r\nis commonly attributed to incursions from the north, the Dorian invasion\r\nof the Greek authors, about 1000 B.C. which led to the destruction of\r\nthe palace of Cnossos and the substitution of \"Geometric\" for\r\n\"Mykenaean\" art.\r\n\r\nTurning to the African branch of the Mediterranean type, we find it\r\nforming not merely the substratum, but the great bulk of the inhabitants\r\nthroughout all recorded time from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, and from\r\nthe Mediterranean to Sudan, although since Muhammadan times largely\r\nintermingled with the kindred Semitic stock (mainly Arabs) in the north\r\nand west, and in the east (Abyssinia) with the same stock since\r\nprehistoric times. All are comprised by Sergi[1103] in two main\r\ndivisions:--\r\n\r\n1. EASTERN HAMITES, answering to the _Ethiopic Branch_ of some writers,\r\nof somewhat variable type, comprising the _Old_ and _Modern Egyptians_\r\nnow mixed with Semitic (Arab) elements; the _Nubians_, the _Bejas_, the\r\n_Abyssinians_, collective name of all the peoples between Khor Barka and\r\nShoa (with, in some places, a considerable infusion of Himyaritic or\r\nearly Semitic blood from South Arabia); the _Gallas_ (Gallas proper,\r\nSomals, and Afars or Danakils); the _Masai_ and _Ba-Hima_.\r\n\r\n2. NORTHERN HAMITES, the _Libyan Race_ or _Berber (Western) Branch_ of\r\nsome writers, comprising the _Mediterranean Berbers_ of Algeria, Tunis,\r\nand Tripoli; the _Atlantic Berbers_ (_Shluhs_ and others) of Morocco;\r\nthe _West Saharan Berbers_ commonly called _Tuaregs_; the _Tibus_ of the\r\nEast Sahara; the _Fulahs_, dispersed amongst the Sudanese Negroes; the\r\n_Guanches_ of the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nOf the Eastern Hamites he remarks generally that they do not form a\r\nhomogeneous division, but rather a number of different peoples either\r\ncrowded together in separate areas, or dispersed in the territories of\r\nother peoples. They agree more in their inner than in their outer\r\ncharacters, without constituting a single ethnical type. The cranial\r\nforms are variable, though converging, and evidently to be regarded as\r\nvery old varieties of an original stock. The features are also variable,\r\nconverging and characteristic, with straight or arched (aquiloid) nose\r\nquite different from the Negro; lips rather thick, but never everted as\r\nin the Negro; hair usually frizzled, not wavy; beard thin; skin very\r\nvariable, brown, red-brown, black-brown, ruddy black, chocolate and\r\ncoffee-brown, reddish or yellowish, these variations being due to\r\ncrossings and the outward physical conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this assumption Sergi is supported by the analogous case of the\r\nwestern Berbers between the Senegal and Morocco, to whom Collignon and\r\nDeniker[1104] restrict the term \"Moor,\" as an ethnical name. The chief\r\ngroups, which range from the Atlantic coast east to the camping grounds\r\nof the true Tuaregs[1105], are the Trarsas and Braknas of the Senegal\r\nriver, and farther north the Dwaish (Idoesh), Uled-Bella, Uled-Embark,\r\nand Uled-en-Nasur. From a study of four of these Moors, who visited\r\nParis in 1895, it appears that they are not an Arabo-Berber cross, as\r\ncommonly supposed, but true Hamites, with a distinct Negro strain, shown\r\nespecially in their frizzly hair, bronze colour, short broad nose, and\r\nthickish lips, their general appearance showing an astonishing likeness\r\nto the Bejas, Afars, Somals, Abyssinians, and other Eastern Hamites.\r\nThis is not due to direct descent, and it is more reasonable to suppose\r\n\"that at the two extremities of the continent the same causes have\r\nproduced the same effects, and that from the infusion of a certain\r\nproportion of black blood in the Egyptian [eastern] and Berber branches\r\nof the Hamites, there have sprung closely analogous mixed groups[1106].\"\r\nFrom the true Negro they are also distinguished by their grave and\r\ndignified bearing, and still more by their far greater intelligence.\r\n\r\nBoth divisions of the Hamites, continues Sergi, agree substantially in\r\ntheir bony structure, and thus form a single anthropological group with\r\nvariable skull--pentagonoid, ovoid, ellipsoid, sphenoid, etc., as\r\nexpressed in his terminology--but constant, that is, each variety\r\nrecurring in all the branches; face also variable (tetragonal,\r\nellipsoid, etc.), but similarly identical in all the branches; profile\r\nnon-prognathous; eyes dark, straight, not prominent; nose straight or\r\narched; hair smooth, curly, long, black or chestnut; beard full, also\r\nscant; lips thin or slightly tumid, never protruding; skin of various\r\nbrown shades; stature medium or tall.\r\n\r\nSuch is the great anthropological division, which was diffused\r\ncontinuously over the greater part of Africa, and round the northern\r\nshores of the Mediterranean. According to Stuhlmann[1107] it had its\r\norigin in South Arabia, if not further east, and entered Africa in the\r\nregion of Erythrea. He regards the Red Sea as offering no obstacle to\r\nmigrations, but suggests a possible land connection between the opposite\r\nshores.\r\n\r\nNothing is more astonishing than the strange persistence not merely of\r\nthe Berber type, but of the Berber temperament and nationality since the\r\nStone Ages, despite the successive invasions of foreign peoples during\r\nthe historic period. First came the Sidonian Phoenicians, founders of\r\nCarthage and Utica probably about 1500 B.C. The Greek occupation of\r\nCyrenaica (628 B.C.) was followed by the advent of the Romans on the\r\nruins of the Carthaginian empire. The Romans have certainly left\r\ndistinct traces of their presence, and some of the Aures highlanders\r\nstill proudly call themselves _Rumaniya_. These _Shawias_ (\"Pastors\")\r\nform a numerous group, all claiming Roman descent, and even still\r\nkeeping certain Roman and Christian feasts, such as _Bu Ini_, _i.e._\r\nChristmas; _Innar_ or _January_ (New Year's Day); Spring (Easter), etc.\r\nA few Latin words also survive such as _urtho_ = hortus; _kerrush_ =\r\nquercus (evergreen oak); _milli_ = milliarium (milestone).\r\n\r\nAfter the temporary Vandal occupation came the great Arab invasions of\r\nthe seventh and later centuries, and even these had been preceded by the\r\nkindred _Ruadites_, who had in pre-Moslem times already reached\r\nMauretania from Arabia. With the Jews, some of whom had also reached\r\nTripolitana before the New Era, a steady infiltration of Negroes from\r\nSudan, and the recent French, Spanish, Italian, and Maltese settlers, we\r\nhave all the elements that go to make up the cosmopolitan population of\r\nMauretania.\r\n\r\nBut amid them all the Berbers and the Arabs stand out as the immensely\r\npredominant factors, still distinct despite a probably common origin in\r\nthe far distant past and later interminglings. The Arab remains above\r\nall a nomad herdsman, dwelling in tents, without house or hamlet, a good\r\nstock-breeder, but a bad husbandman, and that only on compulsion. \"The\r\nploughshare and shame enter hand in hand into the family,\" says the\r\nnational proverb. To find space for his flocks and herds he continues\r\nthe destructive work of Carthaginian and Roman, who ages ago cleared\r\nvast wooded tracts for their fleets and commercial navies, and thus\r\nrendered large areas barren and desolate.\r\n\r\nThe Berber on the contrary loves the sheltering woodlands; he is\r\nessentially a highlander who carefully tills the forest glades, settles\r\nin permanent homes, and often develops flourishing industries. Arab\r\nsociety is feudal and theocratic, ruled by a despotic Sheikh, while the\r\nBerber with his _Jemaa_, or \"Witenagemot,\" and his _Kanun_ or unwritten\r\ncode, feels himself a freeman; and it may well have been this democratic\r\nspirit, inherited by his European descendants, that enabled the western\r\nnations to take the lead in the onward movement of humanity. The Arab\r\nagain is a fanatic, ever to be feared, because he blindly obeys the will\r\nof Allah proclaimed by his prophets, marabouts, and mahdis[1108]. But\r\nthe Berber, a born sceptic, looks askance at theological dogmas; an\r\nunconscious philosopher, he is far less of a fatalist than his Semitic\r\nneighbour, who associates with Allah countless demons and jins in the\r\ngovernment of the world.\r\n\r\nIn their physical characters the two races also present some striking\r\ncontrasts, the Arab having the regular oval brain-cap and face of the\r\ntrue Semite, whereas the Berber head is more angular, less finely\r\nmoulded, with more prominent cheekbones, shorter and less aquiline nose,\r\nwhich combined with a slight degree of sub-nasal prognathism, imparts\r\nto the features coarser and less harmonious outlines. He is at the same\r\ntime distinctly taller and more muscular, with less uniformity in the\r\ncolour of the eye and the hair, as might be expected from the numerous\r\nelements entering into the constitution of present Berber populations.\r\n\r\nIn the social conflict between the Arab and Berber races, the curious\r\nspectacle is presented of two nearly equal elements (same origin, same\r\nreligion, same government, same or analogous tribal groupings, at about\r\nthe same cultural development) refusing to amalgamate to any great\r\nextent, although living in the closest proximity for over a thousand\r\nyears. In this struggle the Arab seems so far to have had the advantage.\r\nInstances of Berberised Arabs occur, but are extremely rare, whereas the\r\nBerbers have not only everywhere accepted the Koran, but whole tribes\r\nhave become assimilated in speech, costume, and usages to the Semitic\r\nintruders. It might therefore seem as if the Arab must ultimately\r\nprevail. But we are assured by the French observers that in Algeria and\r\nTunisia appearances are fallacious, however the case may stand in\r\nMorocco and the Sahara. \"The Arab,\" writes Malbot, to whom I am indebted\r\nfor some of these details, \"an alien in Mauretania, transported to a\r\nsoil which does not always suit him, so far from thriving tends to\r\ndisappear, whereas the Berber, especially under the shield of France,\r\nbecomes more and more aggressive, and yearly increases in numbers. At\r\npresent he forms at least three-fifths of the population in Algeria, and\r\nin Morocco the proportion is greater. He is the race of the future as of\r\nthe past[1109].\"\r\n\r\nThis however would seem to apply only to the races, not to their\r\nlanguages, for we are elsewhere told that Arabic is encroaching steadily\r\non the somewhat ruder Berber dialects[1110]. Considering the enormous\r\nspace over which they are diffused, and the thousands of years that some\r\nof the groups have ceased to be in contact, these dialects show\r\nremarkably slight divergence from the long extinct speech from which all\r\nhave sprung. Whatever it be called--Kabyle, Zenatia, Shawia, Tamashek,\r\nShluh--the Berber language is still essentially one, and the likeness\r\nbetween the forms current in Morocco, Algeria, the Sahara, and the\r\nremote Siwah Oasis on the confines of Egypt, is much closer, for\r\ninstance, than between Norse and English in the sub-Aryan Teutonic\r\ngroup[1111].\r\n\r\nBut when we cross the conventional frontier between the contiguous\r\nTuareg and Tibu domains in the central Sahara the divergence is so great\r\nthat philologists are still doubtful whether the two languages are even\r\nremotely or are at all connected. Ever since the abandonment of the\r\ngeneralisation of Lepsius that Hamitic and Negro were the sole stock\r\nlanguages, the complexity of African linguistic problems has been\r\ngrowing more and more apparent, and Tibu is only one among many puzzles,\r\nconcerning which there is great discordance of opinion even among the\r\nmost recent and competent authorities[1112].\r\n\r\nThe Tibu themselves, apparently direct descendants of the ancient\r\nGaramantes, have their primeval home in the Tibesti range, _i.e._ the\r\n\"Rocky Mountains,\" whence they take their name[1113]. There are two\r\ndistinct sections, the Northern _Tedas_, a name recalling the\r\n_Tedamansii_, a branch of the Garamantes located by Ptolemy somewhere\r\nbetween Tripolitana and Phazania (Fezzan), and the Southern _Dazas_,\r\nthrough whom the Tibu merge gradually in the negroid populations of\r\ncentral Sudan. This intermingling with the blacks dates from remote\r\ntimes, whence Ptolemy's remark that the Garamantes seemed rather more\r\n\"Ethiopians\" than Libyans[1114]. But there can be no doubt that the\r\nfull-blood Tibu, as represented by the northern section, are mainly\r\nMediterranean, and although the type of the men is somewhat coarser than\r\nthat of their Tuareg neighbours, that of the women is almost the finest\r\nin Africa. \"Their women are charming while still in the bloom of youth,\r\nunrivalled amongst their sisters of North Africa for their physical\r\nbeauty; pliant and graceful figures[1115].\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice amongst these somewhat secluded Saharan\r\nnomads the slow growth of culture, and the curious survival of usages\r\nwhich have their explanation in primitive social conditions. \"The Tibu\r\nis always distrustful; hence, meeting a fellow-countryman in the desert\r\nhe is careful not to draw near without due precaution. At sight of each\r\nother both generally stop suddenly; then crouching and throwing the\r\nlitham over the lower part of the face in Tuareg fashion, they grasp the\r\ninseparable spear in their right and the shanger-mangor, or bill-hook,\r\nin their left. After these preliminaries they begin to interchange\r\ncompliments, inquiring after each other's health and family connections,\r\nreceiving every answer with expressions of thanksgiving to Allah. These\r\nformalities usually last some minutes[1116].\" Obviously all this means\r\nnothing more than a doffing of the hat or a shake-hands amongst more\r\nadvanced peoples; but it points to times when every stranger was a\r\n_hostis_, who later became the _hospes_ (host, guest).\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the Tibu domain, with the now absolutely\r\nimpassable Libyan desert[1117], almost completely separates the\r\nMediterranean branch from the Hamites proper. Continuity, however, is\r\naccorded, both on the north along the shores of the Mediterranean to the\r\nNile Delta (Lower Egypt), and on the south through Darfur and Kordofan\r\nto the White Nile, and thence down the main stream to Upper Egypt, and\r\nthrough Abyssinia, Galla and Somali lands to the Indian Ocean. Between\r\nthe Nile and the east coast the domain of the Hamites stretches from the\r\nequator northwards to Egypt and the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nIt appears therefore that Egypt, occupied for many thousands of years by\r\nan admittedly Hamitic people, might have been reached either from the\r\nwest by the Mediterranean route, or down the Nile, or, lastly, it maybe\r\nsuggested that the Hamites were specialised in the Nile valley itself.\r\nThe point is not easy to decide, because, when appeal is made to the\r\nevidence of the Stone Ages, we find nothing to choose between such\r\nwidely separated regions as Somaliland, Upper Egypt, and Mauretania, all\r\nof which have yielded superabundant proofs of the presence of man for\r\nincalculable ages, estimated by some palethnologists at several hundred\r\nthousand years. In Egypt the palaeoliths indicate not only extreme\r\nantiquity, but also that the course of civilisation was uninterrupted by\r\nany such crises as have afforded means of chronological classification\r\nin Western Europe. The differences in technique are local and\r\ngeographical, not historic. The Neolithic period tells the same tale,\r\nand the use of copper at the beginning of the historic period only\r\nslowly replaced the flint industry, which continued during the earlier\r\ndynasties down to the period of the Middle Empire and attained a degree\r\nof perfection nowhere surpassed. Prehistoric pottery strengthens the\r\nevidence of a slow, gradual development, the newer forms nowhere\r\njostling out the old, but co-existing side by side[1118].\r\n\r\nIt might seem therefore that the question of Egyptian origins was\r\nsettled by the mere statement of the case, and that there could be no\r\nhesitation in saying that the Egyptian Hamites were evolved on Egyptian\r\nsoil, consequently are the true autochthones in the Nile valley. Yet\r\nthere is no ethnological question more hotly discussed than this of\r\nEgyptian origins and culture, for the two seem inseparable. There are\r\nbroadly speaking two schools: the African, whose fundamental views are\r\nthus briefly set forth, and the Asiatic, which brings the Egyptians with\r\nall their works from the neighbouring continent. But, seeing that the\r\nEgyptians are now admitted to be Hamites, that there are no Hamites to\r\nspeak of (let it be frankly said, none at all) in Asia, and that they\r\nhave for untold ages occupied large tracts of Africa, there are several\r\nmembers of the Asiatic school who allow that, not the people themselves,\r\nbut their culture only came from western Asia (Mesopotamia). If so, this\r\nculture would presumably have its roots in the delta, which is first\r\nreached by the Isthmus of Suez from Asia, and spread thence, say, from\r\nMemphis up the Nile to Thebes and Upper Egypt, and here arises a\r\ndifficulty. For at that time there was no delta[1119], or at least it\r\nwas only in process of formation, a kind of debatable region between\r\nland and water, inhabitable mainly by crocodiles, and utterly unsuited\r\nto become the seat of a culture whose characteristic features are huge\r\nstone monuments, amongst the largest ever erected by man, and\r\nconsequently needing solid foundations on _terra firma_. It further\r\nappears that although Memphis is very old, Thebes is much older, in\r\nother words, that Egyptian culture began in Upper Egypt, and spread not\r\nup but down the Nile. On the other hand the Egyptians themselves looked\r\nupon the delta as the cradle of their civilisation, although no traces\r\nof material culture have survived, or could be expected to survive, in\r\nsuch a soil[1120]. Moreover it is not necessary to introduce Asiatic\r\ninvaders by way of Lower Egypt. F. Stuhlmann postulates a land\r\nconnection between Africa and Arabia, but even without this assumption\r\nhe regards the Red Sea as affording no hindrance to early\r\ninfiltrations[1121]. Flinders Petrie, while rejecting any considerable\r\nwater transport for the uncultured prehistoric Egyptians (whom he\r\nderives from Libya), detects a succession of subsequent invasions from\r\nAsia, the dynastic race crossing the Red Sea to the neighbourhood of\r\nKoptos, and Syrian invasions leading to the civilisation of the Twelfth\r\nDynasty, besides the later Hyksos invasions of Semito-Babylonian\r\nstock[1122].\r\n\r\nThe theory of Asiatic origins is clearly summed up by H. H.\r\nJohnston[1123]. He regards the earliest inhabitants of Egypt as a\r\ndwarfish Negro-like race, not unlike the Congo Pygmies of to-day (p.\r\n375), with possibly some trace of Bushman (p. 378), but this population\r\nwas displaced more than 15,000 years ago by Mediterranean man, who may\r\nhave penetrated as far as Abyssinia, and may have been linguistically\r\nparent of the Fulah[1124]. The Fulah type was displaced by the invasions\r\nof the Hamites and the Libyans or Berbers. \"The Hamites were no doubt\r\nof common origin, linguistically and racially, with the Semites, and\r\nperhaps originated in that great breeding ground of conquering peoples,\r\nSouth-west Asia. They preceded the Semites, and (we may suppose) after a\r\nlong stay and concentration in Mesopotamia invaded and colonised Arabia,\r\nSouthern Palestine, Egypt, Abyssinia, Somaliland and North Africa to its\r\nAtlantic shores. The Dynastic Egyptians were also Hamites in a sense,\r\nboth linguistically and physically; but they seem to have attained to a\r\nhigh civilisation in Western Arabia, to have crossed the Red Sea in\r\nvessels, and to have made their first base on the Egyptian coast near\r\nBerenice in the natural harbour formed by Ras Benas. From here a long,\r\nbroad wadi or valley--then no doubt fertile--led them to the Nile in the\r\nThebaid, the first seat of their kingly power[1125]. The ancestors of\r\nthe Dynastic Egyptians may have originated the great dams and irrigation\r\nworks in Western Arabia; and such long struggles with increasing drought\r\nmay have first broken them in to the arts of quarrying stone blocks and\r\nbuilding with stone. Over population and increasing drought may have\r\ncaused them to migrate across the Red Sea in search of another home; or\r\ntheir migration may have been partly impelled by the Semitic hordes from\r\nthe north, whom we can imagine at this period--some 9000 to 10,000 years\r\nago--pressing southwards into Arabia and conquering or fusing with the\r\npreceding Hamites; just as these latter, no doubt, at an earlier day,\r\nhad wrested Arabia from the domain of the Negroid and Dravidian\" (p.\r\n382).\r\n\r\nThat the founding of the First Dynasty was coincident with a physical\r\nchange in the population, is proved by the thousands of skeletons and\r\nmummies examined by Elliot Smith[1126], who regards the Pre-dynastic\r\nEgyptians as \"probably the nearest approximation to that anthropological\r\nabstraction, a pure race, that we know of (p. 83).\" He describes the\r\ntype as follows (Chap. IV.).\r\n\r\nThe Proto-Egyptian (_i.e._ Pre-dynastic) was a man of small stature, his\r\nmean height, estimated at a little under 5 ft. 5 in., in the flesh for\r\nmen, and almost 5 ft. in the case of women, being just about the\r\naverage for mankind in general, whereas the modern Egyptian _fellah_\r\naverages about 5 ft. 6 in. He was of very slender build with indications\r\nof poor muscular development. In fact there is a suggestion of\r\neffeminate grace and frailty about his bones, which is lacking in the\r\nmore rugged outlines of the skeletons of his more virile successors. The\r\nhair of the Proto-Egyptian was precisely similar to that of the brunet\r\nSouth European or Iberian people of the present day. It was a very dark\r\nbrown or black colour, wavy or almost straight and sometimes curly,\r\nnever \"woolly.\" There can be no doubt whatever that this dark hair was\r\nassociated with dark eyes and a bronzed complexion. Elliot Smith\r\nemphatically endorses Sergi's identification of the ancient Egyptian as\r\nbelonging to his Mediterranean Race. \"So striking is the family likeness\r\nbetween the Early Neolithic peoples of the British Isles and the\r\nMediterranean and the bulk of the population, both ancient and modern,\r\nof Egypt and East Africa, that a description of the bones of an early\r\nBriton might apply in all essential details to an inhabitant of\r\nSomaliland.\" But he points out also that there is an equally close\r\nrelationship linking the Proto-Egyptians with the populations to the\r\neast, from the Red Sea as far as India, including Semites as well as\r\nHamites. Rejecting the terms \"Mediterranean\" or \"Hamite\" as inadequate\r\nhe would classify his Mediterranean-Hamite-Semite group as the \"Brown\r\nRace[1127].\"\r\n\r\nA most fortunate combination of circumstances afforded Elliot Smith an\r\nopportunity for determining the ethnic affinities of the Egyptian\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe Hearst Expedition of the University of California, under the\r\ndirection of G. A. Reisner, was occupied from 1901 onwards with\r\nexcavations at Naga-ed-Der in the Thebaid, where a cemetery, excavated\r\nby A. M. Lythgoe, contained well-preserved bodies and skeletons of the\r\nearliest known Pre-dynastic period. Close by was a series of graves of\r\nthe First and Second Dynasties; a few hundred yards away tombs of the\r\nSecond to the Fifth Dynasties (examined by A. C. Mace), with a large\r\nnumber of tombs ranging from the time of the Sixth Dynasty to the\r\nTwelfth. \"Thus there was provided a chronologically unbroken series of\r\nhuman remains representing every epoch in the history of Upper Egypt\r\nfrom prehistoric times, roughly estimated at 4000 B.C., up till the\r\nclose of the Middle Empire, more than two thousand years later.\" To\r\ncomplete the story Coptic (Christian Egyptian) graves of the fifth and\r\nsixth centuries were discovered on the same site.\r\n\r\n\"The study of this extraordinarily complete series of human remains,\r\nproviding in a manner such as no other site has ever done the materials\r\nfor the reconstruction of the racial history of one spot during more\r\nthan forty-five centuries, made it abundantly clear that the people\r\nwhose remains were buried just before the introduction of Islam into\r\nEgypt were of the same flesh and blood as their forerunners in the same\r\nlocality before the dawn of history. And nine years' experience in the\r\nAnatomical Department of the School of Medicine in Cairo,\" continues\r\nElliot Smith, \"has left me in no doubt that the bulk of the present\r\npopulation in Egypt conforms to precisely the same racial type, which\r\nhas thus been dominant in the northern portion of the Valley of the Nile\r\nfor sixty centuries[1128].\"\r\n\r\nAs early as the Second Dynasty certain alien traits began to appear,\r\nwhich became comparatively common in the Sixth to Twelfth series. The\r\nnon-Egyptian characters are observable in remains from numerous sites\r\nexcavated by Flinders Petrie in Lower and Middle Egypt, and are\r\nparticularly marked in the cemetery round the Giza Pyramids (excavated\r\nby the Hearst Expedition, 1903), containing remains of more than five\r\nhundred individuals, who had lived at the time of the Pyramid-builders;\r\nthey are therefore referred to by Elliot Smith as \"Giza traits,\" and\r\nattributed to Armenoid influence. Soon after the amalgamation of the\r\nEgyptian kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt by Menes (Mena), consequent\r\nperhaps upon the discovery of copper and the invention of metal\r\nimplements[1129], expeditions were sent beyond the frontiers of the\r\nUnited Kingdom to obtain copper ore, wood and other objects. Even in the\r\ntimes of the First Dynasty the Egyptians began the exploitation of the\r\nmines in the Sinai Peninsula for copper ore. It is claimed by\r\nMeyer[1130] that Palestine and the Phoenician coast were Egyptian\r\ndependencies, and there is ample evidence that there was intimate\r\nintercourse between Egypt and Palestine as far north as the Lebanons\r\nbefore the end of the Third Dynasty. From this time forward the\r\nphysical characters of the people of Lower Egypt show the results of\r\nforeign admixture, and present marked features of contrast to the pure\r\ntype of Upper Egypt. The curious blending of characters suggests that\r\nthe process of racial admixture took place in Syria rather than in Egypt\r\nitself[1131]. The alien type is best shown in the Giza necropolis, and\r\nits representatives may be regarded as the builders and guardians of the\r\nPyramids. The stature is about the same as that of the Proto-Egyptians,\r\npossibly rather lower, but they were built on far sturdier lines, their\r\nbones being more massive, with well-developed muscular ridges and\r\nimpressions, and none of the effeminacy or infantilism of the\r\nprehistoric skeletons. The brain-case has greater capacity with no trace\r\nof the meagre ill-filled character exhibited by the latter.\r\nCharacteristic peculiarities were the \"Grecian profile\" and a jaw\r\nclosely resembling those of the round-headed Alpine races.\r\n\r\nThese \"Giza traits\" were not a local development, for they have been\r\nnoted in all parts of Palestine and Asia Minor, and abundantly in Persia\r\nand Afghanistan. They occur in the Punjab but are absent from India,\r\nhaving an area of greatest concentration in the neighbourhood of the\r\nPamirs; while in a westerly direction, besides being sporadically\r\nscattered over North Africa, they are recognised again in the extinct\r\nGuanches of the Canary Islands. From these considerations Elliot Smith\r\nshapes the following \"working hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Egyptians, Arabs and Sumerians may have been kinsmen of the Brown\r\nRace, each diversely specialized by long residence in its own domain;\r\nand in Pre-dynastic times, before the wider usefulness of copper as a\r\nmilitary instrument of tremendous power was realized, the Middle\r\nPre-dynastic phase of culture became diffused far and wide throughout\r\nArabia and Sumer. Then came the awakening to the knowledge of the\r\nsupremacy which the possession of metal weapons conferred upon those who\r\nwielded them in combat against those not so armed. Upper Egypt\r\nvanquished Lower Egypt in virtue of this knowledge and the possession of\r\nsuch weapons. The United Kingdom pushed its way into Syria to obtain\r\nwood and ore, and incidentally taught the Arabs the value of metal\r\nweapons. The Arabs thereby obtained the supremacy over the Armenoids of\r\nNorthern Syria, and the hybrid race of Semites formed from this blend\r\nwere able to descend the Euphrates and vanquish the more cultured\r\nSumerians, because the latter were without metal implements of war. The\r\nnon-Semitic Armenoids of Asia Minor carried the new knowledge into\r\nEurope[1132].\"\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis might explain some of the difficult problems connecting\r\nEgypt and Babylonia[1133]. The non-Asiatic origin of the Egyptian people\r\nappears to be indicated by recent excavations, but, as mentioned above,\r\nthere are still many who hold that Egyptian culture and civilisation\r\nwere derived mainly, if not wholly, from Asiatic (probably Sumerian)\r\nsources. The Semitic elements existing in the ancient Egyptian language,\r\ncertain resemblances between names of Sumerian and Egyptian gods, and\r\nthe similarity of hieroglyphic characters to the Sumerian system of\r\nwriting have been cited as proofs of the dependence of the one culture\r\nupon the other; while the introduction of the knowledge of metals,\r\nmetal-working and the crafts of brick-making and tomb construction have,\r\ntogether with the bulbous mace-head, cylinder-seal and domesticated\r\nanimals and plants[1134], been traced to Babylonia.\r\n\r\nBut the excavations of Reisner at Naga-ed-Der and those of Naville at\r\nAbydos (1909-10) appear to place the indigenous development of Egyptian\r\nculture beyond question. Reisner's conclusions[1135] are that there was\r\nno sudden break of continuity between the neolithic and early dynastic\r\ncultures of Egypt. No essential change took place in the Egyptian\r\nconception of life after death, or in the rites and practices\r\naccompanying interment. The most noticeable changes, in the character of\r\nthe pottery and household vessels, in the materials for tools and\r\nweapons and the introduction of writing, were all gradually introduced,\r\nand one period fades into another without any strongly marked line of\r\ndivision between them. Egypt no doubt had trading relations with\r\nsurrounding countries. Egyptians and Babylonians must have met in the\r\nmarkets of Syria, and in the tents of Bedouin chiefs. Still, as Meyer\r\npoints out, far from Egypt taking over a ready-made civilisation from\r\nBabylonia, Egypt, as regards cultural influence, was the giver not the\r\nreceiver[1136].\r\n\r\nOne more alien element in Egypt remains to be discussed. Most writers on\r\nEgyptian ethnology detect a Negro or at least Negroid element in the\r\nCaucasoid population, and although usually assigning priority to the\r\nNegro, assume the co-existence of the two races from time immemorial to\r\nthe present day. Measurements on more than 1000 individuals were made by\r\nC. S. Myers, and these are his conclusions. \"There is no anthropometric\r\n(despite the historic) evidence that the population of Egypt, past or\r\npresent, is composed of several different races. Our new anthropometric\r\ndata favour the view which regards the Egyptians always as a homogeneous\r\npeople, who have varied now towards Caucasian, now towards negroid\r\ncharacters (according to environment), showing such close anthropometric\r\naffinity to Libyan, Arabian and like neighbouring peoples, showing such\r\nvariability and possibly such power of absorption, that from the\r\nanthropometric standpoint no evidence is obtainable that the modern\r\nEgyptians have been appreciably affected by other than sporadic Sudanese\r\nadmixture[1137].\"\r\n\r\nIt was seen above (Chap. III.) that non-Negro elements are found\r\nthroughout the Sudan from Senegal nearly to Darfur, nowhere forming the\r\nwhole of the population, but nearly always the dominant native race.\r\nThese are the Fulah (Fula, Fulbe or Fulani), whose ethnic affinities\r\nhave given rise to an enormous amount of speculation. Their linguistic\r\npeculiarity had led many ethnologists to regard them as the descendants\r\nof the first white colonists of North Africa, \"Caucasoid invaders,\"\r\n15,000 years ago, prior to Hamitic intrusions from the east[1138]. Thus\r\nwould be explained the fact that their language betrays absolutely no\r\nstructural affinity with Semitic or Libyo-Hamitic groups, or with any\r\nother speech families outside Africa, though offering faint\r\nresemblances in structure with the Lesghian[1139] speech of the Caucasus\r\nand the Dravidian tongues of Baluchistan and India. Physically there\r\nseems to be nothing to differentiate them from other blends[1140] of\r\nHamite-Negro. The physical type of the pure-bred Fulah H. H. Johnston\r\ndescribes as follows: \"Tall of stature (but not gigantic, like the\r\nNilote and South-east Sudanese), olive-skinned or even a pale yellow;\r\nwell-proportioned, with delicate hands and feet, without steatopygy,\r\nwith long, oval face, big nose (in men), straight nose in women (nose\r\nfinely cut, like that of the Caucasian), eyes large and \"melting,\" with\r\nan Egyptian look about them, head-hair long, black, kinky or ringlety,\r\nnever quite straight[1141].\" They were at first a quiet people, herdsmen\r\nand shepherds with a high and intricate type of pagan religion which\r\nstill survives in parts of Nigeria. But large numbers of them became\r\nconverted to Islam from the twelfth century onwards and gained some\r\nknowledge of the world outside Africa by their pilgrimages to Mecca. At\r\nthe end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries\r\nan uprise of Muhammadan fanaticism and a proud consciousness of their\r\nracial superiority to the mere Negro armed them as an aristocracy to\r\nwrest political control of all Nigeria from the hands of Negro rulers or\r\nthe decaying power of Tuareg and Songhai. This race was all\r\nunconsciously carrying on the Caucasian invasion and penetration of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nA less controversial problem is presented by the Eastern Hamites, who\r\nform a continuous chain of dark Caucasic peoples from the Mediterranean\r\nto the equator, and whose ethnical unity is now established by Sergi on\r\nanatomical grounds[1142]. Bordering on Upper Egypt, and extending thence\r\nto the foot of the Abyssinian plateau, is the Beja section, whose chief\r\ndivisions--Ababdeh, Hadendoa, Bisharin, Beni Amer--have from the\r\nearliest times occupied the whole region between the Nile and the Red\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nC. G. Seligman has analysed the physical and cultural characters of the\r\nBeja tribes (_Bisharin_, _Hadendoa_ and _Beni Amer_), the _Barabra_,\r\nnomad Arabs (such as the _Kababish_ and _Kawahla_), Nilotes (_Shilluk,\r\nDinka, Nuer_) and half-Hamites (_Ba-Hima, Masai_), in an attempt by\r\neliminating the Negro and Semitic elements to deduce the main features\r\nwhich may be held to indicate Hamitic influence. He regards the _Beni\r\nAmer_ as approximating most closely to the original _Beja_ type which he\r\nthus describes. \"Summarizing their physical characteristics it may be\r\nsaid that they are moderately short, slightly built men, with\r\nreddish-brown or brown skins in which a greater or less tinge of black\r\nis present, while in some cases the skin is definitely darker and\r\npresents some shade of brown-black. The hair is usually curly, in some\r\ninstances it certainly might be described as wavy, but the method of\r\nhair dressing adopted tends to make difficult an exact description of\r\nits condition. Often, as is everywhere common amongst wearers of\r\nturbans, the head is shaved.... The face is usually long and oval, or\r\napproaching the oval in shape, the jaw is often lightly built, which\r\nwith the presence of a rather pointed chin may tend to make the upper\r\npart of the face appear disproportionately broad. The nose is well\r\nshaped and thoroughly Caucasian in type and form[1143].\" Among the\r\nHadendoa the \"Armenoid\" or so-called \"Jewish\" nose is not uncommon.\r\nSeligman draws attention to the close resemblance between the _Beja_\r\ntype and that of the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\nThrough the Afars (Danakil) of the arid coastlands between Abyssinia and\r\nthe sea, the Bejas are connected with the numerous Hamitic populations\r\nof the Somali and Galla lands. For the term \"Somal,\" which is quite\r\nrecent and of course unknown to the natives, H. M. Abud[1144] suggests\r\nan interesting and plausible explanation. Being a hospitable people, and\r\nmilk their staple food, \"the first word a stranger would hear on\r\nvisiting their kraals would be 'So mal,' _i.e._ 'Go and bring milk.'\"\r\nStrangers may have named them from this circumstance, and other tribal\r\nnames may certainly be traced to more improbable sources.\r\n\r\nThe natives hold that two races inhabit the land: (1) ASHA, true Somals,\r\nof whom there are two great divisions, _Darod_ and _Ishak_, both\r\nclaiming descent from certain noble Arab families, though no longer of\r\nArab speech; (2) HAWIYA, who are not counted by the others as true\r\nSomals, but only \"pagans,\" and also comprise two main branches, _Aysa_\r\nand _Gadabursi_. In the national genealogies collected by Abud and Cox,\r\nmany of the mythical heroes are buried at or near Meit, which may thus\r\nbe termed the cradle of the Somal race. From this point they spread in\r\nall directions, the Darods pushing south and driving the Galla beyond\r\nthe Webbe Shebel, and till lately raiding them as far as the Tana river.\r\nIt should be noticed that these genealogical tables are far from\r\ncomplete, for they exclude most of the southern sections, notably the\r\n_Rahanwin_ who have a very wide range on both sides of the Jub.\r\n\r\nIn the statements made by the natives about true Somals and \"pagans,\"\r\nrace and religion are confused, and the distinction between Asha and\r\nHawiya is merely one between Moslem and infidel. The latter are probably\r\nof much purer stock than the former, whose very genealogies testify to\r\ninterminglings of the Moslem Arab intruders with the heathen aborigines.\r\n\r\nDespite their dark colour C. Keller[1145] has no difficulty in regarding\r\nthe Somali as members of the \"Caucasic Race.\" The Semitic type crops out\r\ndecidedly in several groups, and they are generally speaking of fine\r\nphysique, well grown, with proud bearing and often with classic profile,\r\nthough the type is very variable owing to Arab and Negro grafts on the\r\nHamitic stock. The hair is never woolly, but, like that of the Beja,\r\nringlety and less thick than the Abyssinian and Galla, sometimes even\r\nquite straight. The forehead is finely rounded and prominent, eye\r\nmoderately large and rather deep-set, nose straight, but also snub and\r\naquiline, mouth regular, lips not too thick, head sub-dolichocephalic.\r\n\r\nGreat attention has been paid to all these Eastern Hamitic peoples by\r\nPh. Paulitschke[1146], who regards the Galla as both intellectually and\r\nmorally superior to the Somals and Afars, the chief reason being that\r\nthe baneful influences exercised by the Arabs and Abyssinians affect to\r\na far greater extent the two latter than the former group.\r\n\r\nThe Galla appear to have reached the African coast before the Danakil\r\nand Somali, but were driven south-east by pressure from the latter,\r\nleaving Galla remnants as serfs among the southern Somali, while the\r\npresence of servile negroid tribes among the Galla gives proof of an\r\nearlier population which they partially displaced. Subsequent pressure\r\nfrom the Masai on the south forced the Galla into contact with the\r\nDanakil, and a branch penetrating inland established themselves on the\r\nnorth and east of Victoria Nyanza, where they are known to-day as the\r\nBa-Hima, Wa-Tusi, Wa-Ruanda and kindred tribes, which have been\r\ndescribed on p. 91.\r\n\r\nThe Masai, the terror of their neighbours, are a mixture of Galla and\r\nNilotic Negro, producing what has been described as the finest type in\r\nAfrica. The build is slender and the height often over six feet, the\r\nface is well formed, with straight nose and finely cut nostrils, the\r\nhair is usually frizzly, and the skin dark or reddish brown. They are\r\npurely pastoral, possessing enormous herds of cattle in which they take\r\ngreat pride, but they are chiefly remarkable for their military\r\norganisation which was hardly surpassed by that of the Zulu. They have\r\neverywhere found in the agricultural peoples an easy prey, and until the\r\nreduction of their wealth by rinderpest (since 1891) and the restraining\r\ninfluence of the white man, the Masai were regarded as an ever-dreaded\r\nscourge by all the less warlike inhabitants of Eastern Africa[1147].\r\n\r\nAmongst the Abyssinian Hamites we find the strangest interminglings of\r\nprimitive and more advanced religious ideas. On a seething mass of\r\nAfrican heathendom, already in pre-historic times affected by early\r\nSemitic ideas introduced by the Himyarites from South Arabia, was\r\nsomewhat suddenly imposed an undeveloped form of Christianity by the\r\npreaching of Frumentius in the fourth century, with results that cannot\r\nbe called satisfactory. While the heterogeneous ethnical elements have\r\nbeen merged in a composite Abyssinian nationality, the discordant\r\nreligious ideas have never yet been fused in a consistent uniform\r\nsystem. Hence \"Abyssinian Christianity\" is a sort of by-word even\r\namongst the Eastern Churches, while the social institutions are marked\r\nby elementary notions of justice and paradoxical \"shamanistic\"\r\npractices, interspersed with a few sublime moral precepts. Many things\r\ncame as a surprise to the members of the Rennell Rodd Mission[1148], who\r\ncould not understand such a strange mixture of savagery and lofty\r\nnotions in a Christian community which, for instance, accounted\r\naccidental death as wilful murder. The case is mentioned of a man\r\nfalling from a tree on a friend below and killing him. \"He was adjudged\r\nto perish at the hands of the bereaved family, in the same manner as the\r\ncorpse. But the family refused to sacrifice a second member, so the\r\nculprit escaped.\" Dreams also are resorted to, as in the days of the\r\nPharaohs, for detecting crime. A priest is sent for, and if his prayers\r\nand curses fail, a small boy is drugged and told to dream. \"Whatever\r\nperson he dreams of is fixed on as the criminal; no further proof is\r\nneeded.... If the boy does not dream of the person whom the priest has\r\ndetermined on as the criminal, he is kept under drugs until he does what\r\nis required of him.\"\r\n\r\nTo outsiders society seems to be a strange jumble of an iron despotism,\r\nwhich forbids the selling of a horse for over L10 under severe\r\npenalties, and a personal freedom or licence, which allows the labourer\r\nto claim his wages after a week's work and forthwith decamp to spend\r\nthem, returning next day or next month as the humour takes him. Yet\r\nsomehow things hold together, and a few Semitic immigrants from South\r\nArabia have for over 2000 years contrived to maintain some kind of\r\ncontrol over the Hamitic aborigines who have always formed the bulk of\r\nthe population in Abyssinia[1149].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1000] _The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study_, W.

The result\r\nis a little confusing, \"Italic\" being now the accepted name of the\r\nItalian branch of the Aryan linguistic family, and also commonly applied\r\nto the Aryans of this Italic speech, although the word _Italia_ itself\r\nmay have been indigenous (Ligurian) and not introduced by the Aryans. It\r\nwould perhaps be better to regard \"Italia\" as a \"geographical\r\nexpression\" applicable to all its inhabitants, whatever their origin or\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n[1077] _Science Progress_, July, 1894. It will be noticed that the\r\nfacts, accepted by all, are differently interpreted by Beddoe and Sergi,\r\nthe latter taking the long-headed element in North Italy as the\r\naboriginal (Ligurian), modified by the later intrusion of round-headed\r\nAryan Slavs, Teutons, and especially Kelts, while Beddoe seems to regard\r\nthe broad-headed Alpine as the original, afterwards modified by\r\nintrusive long-headed types \"Germanic, Slavic, or of doubtful origin.\"\r\nEither view would no doubt account for the present relations; but\r\nSergi's study of the prehistoric remains (see above) seems to compel\r\nacceptance of his explanation.

Thus late into historic times memories\r\nstill survived that the delta was of relatively recent formation, and\r\nthat the _Retu_ (_Romitu_ of the Pyramid texts, later _Rotu_, _Romi_,\r\netc.) had already developed their social system before the Lower Nile\r\nvalley was inhabitable. Hence whether the Nile took 20,000 years\r\n(Schweinfurth) or over 70,000, as others hold, to fill in its estuary,\r\nthe beginning of the Egyptian prehistoric period must still be set back\r\nmany millenniums before the new era. \"Ce que nous savons du Sahara,\r\nlui-meme alors sillonne de rivieres, atteste qu'il [the delta] ne devait\r\npas etre habitable, pas etre constitue a l'epoque quaternaire\" (M.\r\nZaborowski, _Bul.

Should future research confirm the now generally received view\r\nthat Hamites and Semites are fundamentally of one stock, a view based\r\nboth on physical and linguistic data[1150], the cradle of the Semitic\r\nbranch will also probably be traced to South Arabia, and more\r\nparticularly to that south-western region known to the ancients as\r\nArabia Felix, _i.e._ the Yemen of the Arabs. While Asia and Africa were\r\nstill partly separated in the north by a broad marine inlet before the\r\nformation of the Nile delta, easy communication was afforded between the\r\ntwo continents farther south at the head of the Gulf of Aden, where they\r\nare still almost contiguous. By this route the primitive Hamito-Semitic\r\npopulations may have moved either westwards into Africa, or, as has also\r\nbeen suggested, eastwards into Asia, where in the course of ages the\r\nSemitic type became specialised.\r\n\r\nOn this assumption South Arabia would necessarily be the first home of\r\nthe Semites, who in later times spread thence north and east. They\r\nappear as _Babylonians_ and _Assyrians_ in Mesopotamia; as _Phoenicians_\r\non the Syrian coast; as _Arabs_ on the Nejd steppe; as _Canaanites_,\r\n_Moabites_ and others in and about Palestine; as _Amorites_ (_Aramaeans,\r\nSyrians_) in Syria and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThis is the common view of Semitic origins and early migrations, but as\r\npractically no systematic excavations have been possible in Arabia,\r\nowing to political conditions and the attitude of the inhabitants,\r\ndefinite archaeological or anthropological proofs are still lacking. The\r\nhypothesis would, however, seem to harmonise well with all the known\r\nconditions. In the first place is to be considered the very narrow area\r\noccupied by the Semites, both absolutely and relatively to the domains\r\nof the other fundamental ethnical groups. While the Mongols are found in\r\npossession of the greater part of Asia, and the Hamites with the\r\nMediterraneans are diffused over the whole of North Africa, South and\r\nWest Europe since the Stone Ages, the Semites, excluding later\r\nexpansions--Himyarites to Abyssinia, Phoenicians to the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, Moslem Arabs to Africa, Irania, and Transoxiana--have\r\nalways been confined to the south-west corner of Asia, comprising very\r\nlittle more than the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia, Syria, and\r\n(doubtfully) parts of Asia Minor. Moreover the whole mental outlook of\r\nthe Semites, their mode of thought, their religion and organisation,\r\nindicate their derivation from a desert people; while in Arabia are\r\nfound at the present time the purest examples not only of Semitic type,\r\nbut also of Semitic speech[1151]. Their early history, however, as\r\npointed out above, still awaits the spade of the archaeologist, and the\r\nearliest migrations that can be definitely traced are in the form of\r\ninvasions of already established states[1152].\r\n\r\nThe first great wave of Semitic migration from Arabia is placed in the\r\nfourth millennium B.C., 3500 to 2500 or earlier; it affected Babylonia\r\nand probably Syria and Palestine, judging from the Palestinian\r\nplace-names belonging to this \"Babylonian-Semitic\" period, and the close\r\nconnection between Palestine and Babylonia in culture and in religious\r\nideas, indicating prehistoric relationship[1153]. A second wave,\r\nWinckler's Canaanitic or Amoritic migration, followed in the third\r\nmillennium, covering Babylonia, laying the foundations of the Assyrian\r\nEmpire, invading Syria and Palestine (Phoenicians, Amorites) and\r\npossibly later Egypt (_Hyksos_). A third wave, the Aramaean, which\r\nspread over Babylonia, Mesopotamia and Syria in the second millennium,\r\nwas preceded by the swarming into Syria from the desert of the Khabiri\r\n(Habiru) or Hebrews (Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites and Israelites among\r\nothers). From the same area the Suti pressed into Babylonia about 1100,\r\nfollowed by another branch, the Chaldeans from Eastern Arabia.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the earlier waves of migration from the south of\r\nwhich traces can be detected in Western Asia. Of all invasions from the\r\nnorth, that of the Hittites is the most important and the most\r\nconfusing. The Hittites appear to have moved south from Cappadocia about\r\n2000 B.C., and they are found warring against Babylonia in the\r\neighteenth century. A Hittite dynasty flourished at Mittanni 1420-1411\r\nand in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries they conquered and\r\nlargely occupied Syria[1154]. Invasions of Phrygians and Philistines\r\nfrom the west followed the breaking up of the Hittite Empire. The last\r\ngreat Semitic migration was the most widespread of all. \"It issued, like\r\nits predecessors, along the whole margin of the desert, and in the\r\ncourse of a century had flooded not only Syria and Egypt, but all North\r\nAfrica and Spain; it had occupied Sicily, raided Constance, and in\r\nFrance was only checked at Poitiers in 732. Eastward it flooded Persia,\r\nfounded an empire in India, and carried war and commerce by sea past\r\nSingapore[1155].\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus Western Asia has been swept times and again, almost without\r\nnumber, by conquering hordes and the no less severe ethnical\r\ndisturbances of peaceful infiltrations converging from every point of\r\nthe compass in turn.... How, then, is it possible to learn anything\r\ntoday from the contents of this cauldron, filled with such an assortment\r\nof ingredients and still seething from the effects of the disturbance\r\nincidental to the harsh mixing of such incompatible elements[1156]?\"\r\nSome of the problems must for the present be regarded as insoluble, but\r\nwith the evidence provided by archaeologists and anthropologists an\r\nattempt may be made to read the ethnological history in these obscure\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Semitic wave was traceable in Babylonia, but, as seen\r\nabove, opinions differ as to its origin and date. \"At what period the\r\nSemites first invaded Babylonia, when and where they first attained\r\nsupremacy, are not yet matters of history. We find Semites in the land\r\nand in possession of considerable power almost as early as we can go\r\nback[1157].\" The characteristic Semitic features are clearly marked, and\r\nthe language is closely connected with Canaanitic and Assyrian[1158].\r\nFrom the monuments we learn that the Babylonian Semites had full beards\r\nand wore their hair long, contrasting sharply with the shaven Sumerians,\r\nand thus gaining the epithet \"the black-headed ones.\" In nose and lips,\r\nas in dress, they are clearly distinct from the Sumerian type[1159].\r\n\r\nWhen history commences, the inhabitants of Babylonia were already highly\r\ncivilised. They lived in towns, containing great temples, and were\r\norganised in distinct classes or occupations, and possessed much wealth\r\nin sheep and cattle, manufactured goods, gold, silver and copper.\r\nEngraving on metals and precious stones, statuary, architecture,\r\npottery, weaving and embroidery, all show a high level of workmanship.\r\nThey possessed an elaborate and efficient system of writing, extensively\r\nused and widely understood, consisting of a number of signs, obviously\r\ndescended from a form of picture writing, but conventionalised to an\r\nextent that usually precludes the recognition of the original pictures.\r\nThis writing was made by the impression of a stylus on blocks or cakes\r\nof fine clay while still quite soft. These \"tablets\" were sun-dried, but\r\noccasionally baked hard. This cuneiform writing was adopted by, or was\r\ncommon to, many neighbouring nations, being freely used in Elam,\r\nArmenia and Northern Mesopotamia as far as Cappadocia.\r\n\r\nAssyrian culture was founded upon that of Babylonia, but the Assyrians\r\nappear to have differed from the Babylonians in character, though not in\r\nphysical type[1160], while they were closely related in speech. \"The\r\nAssyrians differed markedly from the Babylonians in national character.\r\nThey were more robust, warlike, fierce, than the mild industrial people\r\nof the south. It is doubtful if they were much devoted to agriculture or\r\ndistinguished for manufactures, arts and crafts. They were essentially a\r\nmilitary folk. The king was a despot at home, but the general of the\r\narmy abroad. The whole organisation of the state was for war. The\r\nagriculture was left to serfs or slaves. The manufactures, weaving at\r\nany rate, were done by women. The guilds of workmen were probably\r\nforeigners, as the merchants mostly were. The great temples and palaces,\r\nwalls and moats, were constructed by captives.... For the greater part\r\nof its existence Assyria was the scourge of the nations and sucked the\r\nblood of other races. It lived on the tribute of subject states, and\r\nconquest ever meant added tribute in all necessaries and luxuries of\r\nlife, beside an annual demand for men and horses, cattle and sheep,\r\ngrain and wool to supply the needs of the army and the city[1161].\"\r\n\r\nThe early history of Syria and Palestine is by no means clear, although\r\nmuch light has been shed in recent years by the excavations of R. A. S.\r\nMacalister at Gezer[1162], where remains were found of a pre-Semitic\r\nrace, of Ernst Sellin at Tell Ta'anek and Jericho[1163], and the labours\r\nof the _Deutscher Palaestina-Verein_ and especially G. Schumacher at\r\nMegiddo[1164]. Caves apparently occupied by man in the Neolithic period\r\nwere discovered at Gezer, and are dated at about 3500 to 3000 B.C. from\r\ntheir position below layers in which Egyptian scarabs appear. Fragments\r\nof bones give indications of the physical type. None of the individuals\r\nexceeded 5 ft. 7 inches (1.702 m.) in height, and most were under 5 ft.\r\n4 inches (1.626 m.). They were muscular, with elongated crania and thick\r\nheavy skull-bones. From their physical characters it could be clearly\r\nseen that they did not belong to the Semitic race. They burned their\r\ndead, a non-Semitic custom, a cave being fitted up as a crematorium,\r\nwith a chimney cut up through the solid rock to secure a good\r\ndraught[1165].\r\n\r\nThe first great influx of Semitic nomads is conjectured to have reached\r\nBabylonia, not from the south, but from the north-west, after traversing\r\nthe Syrian coast lands. They left colonists behind them in this region,\r\nwho afterwards as the Amurru (Amorites) pressed on in their turn into\r\nBabylonia and established the earliest independent dynasty in\r\nBabylon[1166].\r\n\r\nThe second great wave of Semitic migration appears to have included the\r\nPhoenicians[1167], so called by the Greeks, though they called\r\nthemselves Canaanites and their land Canaan[1168], and are referred to\r\nin the Old Testament, as in inscriptions at Tyre, as \"Sidonians.\" They\r\nthemselves had a tradition that their early home was on the Persian\r\nGulf, a view held by Theodore Bent and others[1169], and recent\r\ndiscoveries emphasise the close cultural (not necessarily racial)\r\nconnection between Palestine and Babylonia[1170].\r\n\r\nThe weakening of Egyptian hold upon Palestine about the fourteenth\r\ncentury B.C. encouraged incursions of restless Habiru (Habiri) from the\r\nSyrian deserts, commonly identified with the Hebrews, and invasions of\r\nHittites from the north. In the thirteenth century Egypt recovered\r\nPalestine, leaving the Hittites in possession of Syria. About this time\r\nthe coast was invaded by Levantines, including the Purasati, in whom\r\nmay perhaps be recognised the Philistines, who gave their name to\r\nPalestine[1171].\r\n\r\nWith the Hebrew or Israelitish inhabitants of south Syria (Canaan,\r\nPalestine, \"Land of Promise\") we are here concerned only in so far as\r\nthey form a distinct branch of the Semitic family. The term\r\n\"Jews[1172],\" properly indicating the children of Judah, fourth son of\r\nJacob, has long been applied generally to the whole people, who since\r\nthe disappearance of the ten northern tribes have been mainly\r\nrepresented by the tribe of Judah, a remnant of Benjamin and a few\r\nLevites, _i.e._ the section of the nation which to the number of some\r\n50,000 returned to south Palestine (kingdom of Judaea) after the\r\nBabylonian captivity. These were doubtless later joined by some of the\r\ndispersed northern tribes, who from Jacob's alternative name were\r\ncommonly called the \"ten tribes of Israel.\" But all such Israelites had\r\nlost their separate nationality, and were consequently absorbed in the\r\nroyal tribe of Judah. Since the suppression of the various revolts under\r\nthe Empire, the Judaei themselves have been a dispersed nationality, and\r\neven before those events numerous settlements had been made in different\r\nparts of the Greek and Roman worlds, as far west as Tripolitana, and\r\nalso in Arabia and Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nBut most of the present communities probably descend from those of the\r\ngreat dispersion after the fall of Jerusalem (70 A.D.), increased by\r\nconsiderable accessions of converted \"Gentiles,\" for the assumption that\r\nthey have made few or no converts is no longer tenable. In exile they\r\nhave been far more a religious body than a broken nation, and as such\r\nthey could not fail under favourable conditions to spread their\r\nteachings, not only amongst their Christian slaves, but also amongst\r\npeoples, such as the Abyssinian Falashas, of lower culture than\r\nthemselves. In pre-Muhammadan times many Arabs of Yemen and other\r\ndistricts had conformed, and some of their Jewish kings (Asad Abu-Karib,\r\nDhu Nowas, and others) are still remembered. About the seventh century\r\nall the Khazars--a renowned Turki people of the Volga, the Crimea, and\r\nthe Caspian--accepted Judaism, though they later conformed to Russian\r\northodoxy. The Visigoth persecution of the Spanish Jews (fifth and sixth\r\ncenturies) was largely due to their proselytising zeal, against which,\r\nas well as against Jewish and Christian mixed marriages, numerous papal\r\ndecrees were issued in medieval times.\r\n\r\nTo this process of miscegenation is attributed the great variety of\r\nphysical features observed amongst the Jews of different\r\ncountries[1173], while the distinctly red type cropping out almost\r\neverywhere has been traced by Sayce and others to primordial\r\ninterminglings with the Amorites (\"Red People\"). \"Uniformity only exists\r\nin the books and not in reality. There are Jews with light and with dark\r\neyes, Jews with straight and with curly hair, Jews with high and narrow\r\nand Jews with short and broad, noses; their cephalic index oscillates\r\nbetween 65 and 98--as far as this index ever oscillates in the _genus\r\nhomo_[1174]!\" Nevertheless certain marked characteristics--large hooked\r\nnose, prominent watery eyes, thick pendulous and almost everted under\r\nlip, rough frizzly lustreless hair--are sufficiently general to be\r\nregarded as racial traits.\r\n\r\nThe race is richly endowed with the most varied qualities, as shown by\r\nthe whole tenour of their history. Originally pure nomads, they became\r\nexcellent agriculturists after the settlement in Canaan, and since then\r\nthey have given proof of the highest capacity for science, letters,\r\nerudition of all kinds, finance, music, and diplomacy. The reputation of\r\nthe medieval Arabs as restorers of learning is largely due to their wise\r\ntolerance of the enlightened Jewish communities in their midst, and on\r\nthe other hand Spain and Portugal have never recovered from the national\r\nloss sustained by the expulsion of the Jews in the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries. In late years the persecutions, especially in\r\nRussia, have caused a fresh exodus from the east of Europe, and by the\r\naid of philanthropic capitalists flourishing agricultural settlements\r\nhave been founded in Palestine and Argentina. From statistics taken in\r\nvarious places up to 1911 the Jewish communities are at present\r\nestimated at about 12,000,000, of whom three-fourths are in Europe,\r\n380,000 in Africa, 500,000 in Asia, the rest in America and\r\nAustralia[1175].\r\n\r\nIntimately associated with all these Aramaic Canaanitic Semites were a\r\nmysterious people who have been identified with the _Hittites_[1176] of\r\nScripture, and to whom this name has been extended by common consent.\r\nThey are also identified with the _Kheta_ of the Egyptian\r\nmonuments[1177], as well as with the _Khatti_ of the Assyrian cuneiform\r\ntexts. Indeed all these are, without any clear proof, assumed to be the\r\nsame people, and to them are ascribed a considerable number of stones,\r\ncylinders, and gems from time to time picked up at various points\r\nbetween the Middle Euphrates and the Mediterranean, engraved in a kind\r\nof hieroglyphic or rather pictorial script, which has been variously\r\ndeciphered according to the bias or fancy of epigraphists. This simply\r\nmeans that the \"Hittite texts\" have not yet been interpreted, and are\r\nlikely to remain unexplained, until a clue is found in some bilingual\r\ndocument, such as the Rosetta Stone, which surrendered the secret of the\r\nEgyptian hieroglyphs. L. Messerschmidt, editor of a number of Hittite\r\ntexts[1178], declared (in 1902) that only one sign in two hundred had\r\nbeen interpreted with any certainty[1179], and although the system of A.\r\nH. Sayce[1180] is based on a scientific plan, his decipherments must for\r\nthe present remain uncertain. The important tablets found by H. Winckler\r\nin 1907[1181] at Boghaz Keui in Cappadocia, identified with Khatti, the\r\nHittite capital, have thrown much light on Hittite history, and support\r\nmany of Sayce's conjectures. The records show that the Hittites were\r\none of the great nations of antiquity, with a power extending at its\r\nprime from the Asiatic coast of the Aegean to Mesopotamia, and from the\r\nBlack Sea to Kadesh on the Orontes, a power which neither Egypt nor\r\nAssyria could withstand. \"It is still not certain to which of the great\r\nfamilies of nations they belonged. The suggestion has been made that\r\ntheir language has certain Indo-European characteristics; but for the\r\npresent it is safer to regard them as an indigenous race of Asia Minor.\r\nTheir strongly-marked facial type, with long, straight nose and receding\r\nforehead and chin, is strikingly reproduced on all their monuments, and\r\nsuggests no comparison with Aryan or Semitic stocks[1182].\"\r\n\r\nF. von Luschan, however, is able to throw some light on the ethnological\r\nhistory of the Hittites. When investigating the early inhabitants of\r\nWestern Asia he was constantly struck by the appearance of a markedly\r\nnon-Semitic type, which he called \"Armenoid.\" The most typical were the\r\nTahtadji or woodcutters of Western Lycia living up in the mountains and\r\ntotally distinct in every way from their Mohammedan neighbours. \"Their\r\nsomatic characters are remarkably homogeneous; they have a tawny white\r\nskin, much hair on the face, straight hair, dark brown eyes, a narrow,\r\ngenerally aquiline nose, and a very short and high head. The cephalic\r\nindex varies only from 82 to 91, with a maximum frequency of 86[1183].\"\r\nSimilar types were found in the Bektash, who are town-dwellers in Lycia,\r\nand in the Ansariyeh in Northern Syria. In Upper Mesopotamia these\r\nfeatures occur again among the Kyzylbash, and in Western Kurdistan among\r\nthe Yezidi. \"We find a small minority of groups possessing a similarity\r\nof creed and a remarkable uniformity of type, scattered over a vast part\r\nof Western Asia. I see no other way to account for this fact than to\r\nassume that the members of all these sects are the remains of an old\r\nhomogeneous population, which have preserved their religion and have\r\ntherefore refrained from intermarriage with strangers and so preserved\r\ntheir old physical characteristics[1184].\" They all speak the languages\r\nof their orthodox neighbours, Turkish, Arabic and Kurdish, but are\r\nabsolutely homogeneous as to their somatic characters. Two other groups\r\nwith the same physical type are the Druses of the Lebanon and\r\nAntilebanos country, who speak Arabic and pass officially as\r\nMohammedans, though their secret creed contains many Christian, Jewish\r\nand pantheistic elements. To the north of the Druses are the Christian\r\nMaronites, said to be the descendants of a Monophysite sect, separated\r\nfrom the common Christian Church after the Council of Chalcedon in 451\r\nA.D. \"Partly through their isolation in the mountains, partly through\r\ntheir not intermarrying with their Mahometan or Druse neighbours, the\r\nMaronites of today have preserved an old type in almost marvellous\r\npurity. In no other Oriental group is there a greater number of men with\r\nextreme height of the skull and excessive flattening of the occipital\r\nregion than among the Maronites.... Very often their occiput is so steep\r\nthat one is again and again inclined to think of artificial\r\ndeformation.\" But \"no such possibility is found[1185].\"\r\n\r\nThese hypsibrachycephalic groups with high narrow noses, found also in\r\nPersia, among Turks, Greeks, and still more commonly among Armenians,\r\nwere first (1892) called by von Luschan \"Armenoid,\" but \"there can be no\r\ndoubt that they are all descended from tribes belonging to the great\r\nHittite Empire. So it is the type of the Hittites that has been\r\npreserved in all these groups for more than 3000 years[1186].\" As to\r\ntheir primordial home von Luschan connects them with the \"Alpine Race\"\r\nof Central Europe, but leaves it an open question whether the Hittites\r\ncame from Central Europe, or the Alpine Race from Western Asia, though\r\ninclining to the latter view. The high narrow nose (the essential\r\nsomatic difference between the Hittites and the other brachycephalic\r\nArabs) \"originated as a merely accidental mutation and was then locally\r\nfixed, either by a certain tendency of taste and fashion or by long,\r\nperhaps millennial in-breeding. The 'Hittite nose' has finally become a\r\ndominant characteristic in the Mendelian sense, and we see it, not only\r\nin the actual geographical province of the Alpine Race, but often enough\r\nalso here in England[1186].\"\r\n\r\nIn Arabia itself inscriptions point to the early existence of civilised\r\nkingdoms, among which those of the Sabaeans[1187] and the\r\nMinaeans[1188] stand out most clearly, though their dates and even their\r\nchronological order are much disputed. Possibly both lasted until the\r\nrise of the Himyarites at the beginning of the Christian era. All are\r\nagreed however that Arabian civilisation reached a very high level in\r\nthe centuries preceding the birth of the Prophet, before the increase in\r\nshipping led to the abandonment of the caravan trade.\r\n\r\nThe modern inhabitants are divided into the Southern Arabians, mainly\r\nsettled agriculturalists of Yemen, Hadramaut and Oman, who trace their\r\ndescent from Shem, and the Northern Arabians (Bedouin[1189]), pastoral\r\ntribes, who trace their descent from Ishmael. The two groups have even\r\nbeen considered ethnologically distinct, but, as von Luschan points out,\r\n\"peninsular Arabia is the least-known land in the world, and large\r\nregions of it are even now absolutely _terrae incognitae_, so great\r\ncaution is necessary in forming conclusions, from the measurements of a\r\nfew dozens of men, concerning the anthropology of a land more than five\r\ntimes as great as France[1190].\" His measurements of \"the only real\r\nSemites, the Bedawy,\" gave a cephalic index ranging from 68 to 78, while\r\nthe nose was short and fairly broad, very seldom of a \"Jewish type.\"\r\nRecently Seligman[1191] has shown that whereas the Semites of Northern\r\nArabia conform more or less to the type just mentioned those of Southern\r\nArabia are of low or median stature (1.62-1.65 m., 63-3/4-65 in.), and\r\nare predominantly brachycephalic, the cephalic index ranging from 71 to\r\n92, with an average of about 82.\r\n\r\nElsewhere--Iberia, Sicily, Malta[1192], Irania, Central Asia,\r\nMalaysia--the Arab invaders have failed to preserve either their speech\r\nor their racial individuality. In some places (Spain, Portugal, Sicily)\r\nthey have disappeared altogether, leaving nothing behind them beyond\r\nsome slight linguistic traces, and the monuments of their wonderful\r\narchitecture, crumbling Alhambras or stupendous mosques re-consecrated\r\nas Christian temples. But in the eastern lands their influence is still\r\nfelt by multitudes, who profess Islam and use the Arabic script in\r\nwriting their Persian, Turki, or Malay languages, because some centuries\r\nago those regions were swept by a tornado of rude Bedouin fanatics, or\r\nelse visited by peaceful traders and missionaries from the Arabian\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\nThe monotheism proclaimed by these zealous preachers is often spoken of\r\nas a special inheritance of the Semitic peoples, or at least already\r\npossessed by them at such an early period in their life-history as to\r\nseem inseparable from their very being. But it was not so. Before the\r\ntime of Allah or of Jahveh every hill-top had its tutelar deity; the\r\ncaves and rocks and the very atmosphere swarmed with \"jins\"; Assyrian\r\nand Phoenician pantheons, with their Baals, and Molochs, and Astartes\r\nand Adonais, were as thickly peopled as those of the Hellenes and\r\nHindus, and in this, as in all other natural systems of belief, the\r\nmonotheistic concept was gradually evolved by a slow process of\r\nelimination. Nor was the process perfected by all the Semitic\r\npeoples--Canaanites, Assyrians, Amorites, Phoenicians, and others having\r\nalways remained at the polytheistic stage--but only by the Hebrews and\r\nthe Arabs, the two more richly endowed members of the Semitic family.\r\nEven here a reservation has to be made, for we now know that there was\r\nreally but one evolution, that of Jahveh, the adoption of the idea\r\nembodied in Allah being historically traceable to the Jewish and\r\nChristian systems. As Jastrow points out, the higher religious and\r\nethical movement began with Moses, who invested the national Jahveh with\r\nethical traits, thus paving the way for the wider conceptions of the\r\nProphets. \"The point of departure in the Hebrew religion from that of\r\nthe Semitic in general did not come until the rise of a body of men who\r\nset up a new ideal of divine government of the universe, and with it as\r\na necessary corollary a new standard of religious conduct. Throwing\r\naside the barriers of tribal limitations to the jurisdiction of a deity,\r\nit was the Hebrew Prophets who first prominently and emphatically\r\nbrought forth the view of a divine power conceived in spiritual terms,\r\nwho, in presiding over the universe and in controlling the fates of\r\nnations and individuals, acts from self-imposed laws of righteousness\r\ntempered with mercy[1193].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1150] The divergent views of orientalists concerning Semitic\r\n(linguistic) origins are summarised by W.

As far as early Semitic migrations can be\r\ntraced he thinks they indicate a north to south direction, and he sees\r\nno cause for disputing the Biblical account (_Gen._ ii. 10 ff.) deriving\r\nthe descendants of Shem \"from the neighbourhood of Ararat, i.e.\r\nArmenia, across the Taurus to the North Syrian plain.\" \"Die Voelker\r\nAltpalaestinas,\" _Das Land der Bibel_, I. 2, 1914, p. 11.

As we have seen, in the\r\nNile valley, in Mesopotamia and in the Aegean area, remains\r\ncharacteristic of Bronze Age culture rest on a neolithic substratum, and\r\na transitional stage, when gold and copper were the only metals known,\r\noften connects the two. From the time of this dawning of the Age of\r\nMetals, the inhabitants of the Nile Valley, of Crete, of Cyprus and of\r\nthe mainland of Greece freely exchanged their products. Navigation was\r\nalready flourishing, and the sea united rather than divided the insular\r\nand coastal populations. Gradually Egeo-Mykenaean civilisation extended\r\nfrom Crete and the Greek lands to the west, influencing Sicily directly,\r\nand leaving distinct traces in Southern Italy, Sardinia and the Iberian\r\npeninsula, while Iberia in its turn contributed to the development of\r\nWestern Gaul and the British Isles. The knowledge of copper, and, soon\r\nafter, that of bronze, spread by the Atlantic route to Ireland, while\r\nCentral Europe was reached directly from the south. Thanks to the trade\r\nin amber, always in demand by the Mediterranean populations, there was a\r\ncontinuous trade route to Scandinavia, which thus had direct\r\ncommunication with Southern Europe. As civilisation developed, the lands\r\nof the north and west became exporters as well as importers, each\r\ndeveloping a distinct industry not always inferior to the more\r\nprecocious culture of the south[1194].\r\n\r\nWith trade communications thus stretching across Europe from south to\r\nnorth, and from east to extreme west, it would seem not improbable that\r\nmovements of peoples were equally unrestricted, and this would account\r\nfor the appearance on the threshold of history of various peoples\r\nformerly grouped together on account of their language, as \"Aryan.\"\r\nJ. L. Myres, however, is inclined to attribute \"the coming of the North\"\r\nto the same type of climatic impulse which induced the Semitic swarms\r\ndescribed above (p. 489). After referring to the earliest occurrence of\r\nIndo-European names[1195], he continues \"Before the time of the\r\nEighteenth Dynasty of Egypt there had been a very extensive raid of\r\nIndo-European-speaking folk by way of the Persian plateau, as far as the\r\nSyrian coastland and the interior of Asia Minor.\" These raids coincide\r\nwith a new cultural feature of great significance. \"It is of the first\r\nimportance to find that it is in the dark period which immediately\r\nprecedes the Eighteenth Dynasty revival--when Egypt was prostrate under\r\nmysterious 'Shepherd Kings,' and Babylon under Kassite invaders equally\r\nmysterious--that the civilized world first became acquainted with one of\r\nthe greatest blessings of civilisation, the domesticated horse. The\r\nperiod of Arabian drought, which drove forth the 'Canaanite' emigrants,\r\nmay have had its counterpart on the northern steppe, to provoke the\r\nmigration of these horsemen.\" He adds, however, \"our knowledge both of\r\nthe extent of these droughts and of the chronology of both these\r\nmigrations, is too vague for this to be taken as more than a provisional\r\nbasis for more exact enquiry[1196].\"\r\n\r\nThe attempt has often been made to locate the original home of the\r\nIndo-European people by an appeal to philology, and idyllic pictures\r\nhave been drawn up of the \"Aryan family\" consisting of the father the\r\nprotector, the mother the producer, and the children \"whose name implied\r\nthat they kept everything clean and neat[1197].\" They were regarded as\r\noriginally pastoral and later agricultural, ranging over a wide area\r\nwith Bactria for its centre. With advancing knowledge of what is\r\nprimitive in Indo-European this circumstantial picture crumbled to\r\npieces, and Feist[1198] reduces all inferences deducible from linguistic\r\npalaeontology to the sole \"argumentum ex silencio\" (which he regards as\r\ndistinctly untrustworthy in itself), that the \"Urheimat\" was a country\r\nin which in the middle of the third millennium B.C. such southern\r\nanimals as lion, elephant, and tiger, were unknown. It was commonly\r\nassumed that the \"Aryan cradle\" was in Asia, and the suggestion of R. G.\r\nLatham in 1851 that the original home was in Europe was scouted by one\r\nof the most eminent writers on the subject--Victor Hehn--as lunacy\r\npossible only to one who lived in a country of cranks[1197]. But\r\nsince this date, there has been a shifting of the \"Urheimat\" further and\r\nfurther west. O. Schrader[1199] places it in South Russia, G.\r\nKossinna[1200] and H. Hirt[1201] support the claims of Germany, while K.\r\nPenka and many others go still further north, deriving both language\r\nand tall fair dolichocephalic speakers (proto-Teutons) from\r\nScandinavia[1202].\r\n\r\nF. Kauffmann[1203], noting the contrast between the cultures associated\r\nwith pre-neolithic and with neolithic kitchen-middens, is prepared to\r\nattribute the former to aboriginal inhabitants, Ligurians, and, further\r\nnorth, Kvaens (Finns, Lapps), and the neolithic civilisation of Europe\r\nto Indo-Europeans. \"Thus the neolithic Indo-Europeans would already have\r\nadvanced as far as South Sweden in the Litorina period of the Baltic,\r\nduring the oak-period.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the discovery of Tocharish has inclined E. Meyer[1204]\r\nto reconsider an Asiatic origin, but the information as to this language\r\nis too fragmentary to be conclusive on this point. After reviewing the\r\nvarious theories Giles[1205] concludes \"in the great plain which extends\r\nacross Europe north of the Alps and Carpathians and across Asia north of\r\nthe Hindu Kush there are few geographical obstacles to prevent the rapid\r\nspread of peoples from any part of its area to any other, and, as we\r\nhave seen, the Celts and the Hungarians etc. have in the historical\r\nperiod demonstrated the rapidity with which such migrations could be\r\nmade. Such migrations may possibly account for the appearance of a\r\npeople using a _centum_ language so far east as Turkestan[1206].\"\r\n\r\nMore acrimonious than the discussion of the original home is the dispute\r\nas to the original physical type of the Indo-European-speaking people.\r\nIt was almost a matter of faith with Germans that the language was\r\nintroduced by tall fair dolichocephals of Nordic type. On the other hand\r\nthe Gallic school sought to identify the Alpine race as the only and\r\noriginal Aryans. The futility of the whole discussion is ably\r\ndemonstrated by W. Z. Ripley in his protest against the confusion of\r\nlanguage and race[1207]. Feist[1208] summarises our information as\r\nfollows. All that we can say about the physical type of the \"Urvolk\" is\r\nthat since the Indo-Europeans came from a northerly region[1209] (not\r\nyet identified) it is surmised that they belonged to the light-skinned\r\npeople. The observation that mountain folk of Indo-Germanic speech in\r\nsouthern areas, such as the Ossets of the Caucasus, the Kurds of the\r\nuplands of Armenia and Irania, and the Tajiks of the western Pamirs not\r\ninfrequently exhibit fair hair or blue eyes supports this view.\r\nNevertheless, as he points out, brachycephals are not hereby excluded.\r\nHis own conclusion, which naturally results from a review of the whole\r\nevidence, is that the \"Urvolk\" was not a pure race, but a mixture of\r\ndifferent types. Already in neolithic times races in Europe were no\r\nlonger pure, and in France \"formed an almost inextricable medley\" and\r\nFeist assumes with E. de Michelis[1210] that the Indo-Europeans were a\r\nconglomerate of peoples of different origins who in prehistoric times\r\nwere welded together into an ethnic unity, as the present English have\r\nbeen formed from pre-Indo-European Caledonians (Picts and Scots), Celts,\r\nRoman traders and soldiers and later Teutonic settlers[1211].\r\n\r\nThe evidence that Indo-Europeans were already in existence in\r\nMesopotamia, Syria and Irania about the middle of the second millennium\r\nB.C. has already been mentioned. About the same time the Vedic hymns\r\nbear witness to the appearance of the Aryans of Western India. The\r\nformation of an Aryan group with a common language, religion and culture\r\nis a process necessarily requiring considerable length of time, so that\r\ntheir swarming off from the Indo-European parent group must be pushed\r\nback to far into the third millennium. At this period there are\r\nindications of the settling of the Greeks in the southern promontories\r\nof the Balkan peninsula at latest about 2000 B.C., while Thracian and\r\nIllyrian peoples may have filled the mainland, though the Dorians\r\noccupied Epirus, Macedonia, and perhaps Southern Illyria. Indo-European\r\nstocks were already in occupation of Central Italy. It would appear\r\ntherefore that the period of the Indo-European community, before the\r\nmigrations, must be placed at the end of the Stone Ages, at the time\r\nwhen copper was first introduced. Thus it seems legitimate to infer\r\nthat the expansion of the Indo-Europeans began about 2500 B.C. and the\r\nfurthest advanced branches entered into the regions of the older\r\npopulations and cultures at latest after the beginning of the second\r\nmillennium[1212]. About 1000 B.C. we find three areas occupied by\r\nIndo-European-speaking peoples, all widely separated from each other and\r\napparently independent. These are (1) the Aryan groups in Asia; (2) the\r\nBalkan peninsula together with Central and Lower Italy, and the Mysians\r\nand Phrygians of Asia Minor (possibly the Thracians had already advanced\r\nacross the Danube); and (3) Teutons, Celts and Letto-Slavs over the\r\ngreater part of Germany and Scandinavia, perhaps also already in Eastern\r\nFrance and in Poland. The following centuries saw the advance of\r\nIranians to South Russia and further west, the pressing of the Phrygians\r\ninto Armenia, and lastly the Celtic migrations in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the linguistic and botanical evidence brought forward by the Polish\r\nbotanist Rostafinski[1213] the ancestors of the Celts, Germans and\r\nBalto-Slavs must have occupied a region north of the Carpathians, and\r\nwest of a line between Koenigsberg and Odessa (the beech and yew zone).\r\nThe Balto-Slavs subsequently lost the word for beech and transferred the\r\nword for yew to the sallow and black alder (both with red wood) but\r\ntheir possession of a word for hornbeam locates their original home in\r\nPolesie--the marshland traversed by the Pripet but not south or east of\r\nKiev.\r\n\r\nAlthough, owing to the absence of Teutonic inscriptions before the third\r\nor fourth century A.D. it is difficult to trace the Nordic peoples with\r\nany certainty during the Bronze or Early Iron Ages, yet the fairly\r\nwell-defined group of Bronze Age antiquities, covering the basin of the\r\nElbe, Mecklenburg, Holstein, Jutland, Southern Sweden and the islands of\r\nthe Belt have been conjectured with much probability to represent early\r\nTeutonic civilisation. \"Whether we are justified in speaking of a\r\nTeutonic race in the anthropological sense is at least doubtful, for the\r\nmost striking characteristics of these peoples [as deduced from\r\nprehistoric skeletons, descriptions of ancient writers and present day\r\nstatistics] occur also to a considerable extent among their eastern and\r\nwestern neighbours, where they can hardly be ascribed altogether to\r\nTeutonic admixture. The only result of anthropological investigation\r\nwhich so far can be regarded as definitely established is that the old\r\nTeutonic lands in Northern Germany, Denmark and Southern Sweden have\r\nbeen inhabited by people of the same type since the neolithic age if not\r\nearlier[1214].\" This type is characterised by tall stature, long narrow\r\nskull, light complexion with light hair and eyes[1215].\r\n\r\nDuring the age of national migrations, from the fourth to the sixth\r\ncentury, the territories of the Nordic peoples were vastly extended,\r\npartly by conquest, and partly by arrangement with the Romans. But these\r\nmovements had begun before the new era, for we hear of the _Cimbri_\r\ninvading Illyricum, Gaul and Italy in the second century B.C. probably\r\nfrom Jutland[1216], where they were apparently associated with the\r\n_Teutoni_. Still earlier, in the third century B.C., the _Bastarnae_,\r\nsaid by many ancient writers to have been Teutonic in origin, invaded\r\nand settled between the Carpathians and the Black Sea. Already mentioned\r\ndoubtfully by Strabo as separating the Germani from the Scythians\r\n(Tyragetes) about the Dniester and Dnieper, their movements may now be\r\nfollowed by authentic documents from the Baltic to the Euxine.\r\nFurtwaengler[1217] shows that the earliest known German figures are those\r\nof the Adamklissi monument, in the Dobruja, commemorating the victory of\r\nCrassus over the Bastarnae, Getae, and Thracians in 28 B.C. The\r\nBastarnae migrated before the Cimbri and Teutons through the Vistula\r\nvalley to the Lower Danube about 200 B.C. They had relations with the\r\nMacedonians, and the successes of Mithridates over the Romans were due\r\nto their aid. The account of their overthrow by Crassus in Dio Cassius\r\nis in striking accord with the scenes on the Adamklissi monument. Here\r\nthey appear dressed only in a kind of trowsers, with long pointed\r\nbeards, and defiant but noble features. The same type recurs both on the\r\ncolumn of Trajan, who engaged them as auxiliaries in his Dacian wars,\r\nand on the Arch of Marcus Aurelius, here however wearing a tunic, a sign\r\nperhaps of later Roman influences. And thus after 2000 years are\r\nanswered Strabo's doubts by modern archaeology.\r\n\r\nMuch later there followed along the same beaten track between the Baltic\r\nand Black Sea a section of the Goths, whom we find first settled in the\r\nBaltic lands in proximity to the Finns. The exodus from this region can\r\nscarcely have taken place before the second century of the new era, for\r\nthey are still unknown to Strabo, while Tacitus locates them on the\r\nBaltic between the Elbe and the Vistula. Later Cassiodorus and others\r\nbring them from Scandinavia to the Vistula, and up that river to the\r\nEuxine and Lower Danube. Although often regarded as legendary[1218],\r\nthis migration is supported by archaeological evidence. In 1837 a gold\r\ntorque with a Gothic inscription was found at Petroassa in Wallachia,\r\nand in 1858 an iron spear-head with a Gothic name in the same script,\r\nwhich dates from the first Iron Age, turned up near Kovel in Volhynia.\r\nThe spear-head is identical with one found in 1865 at Muenchenberg in\r\nBrandenburg, on which Wimmer remarks that \"of 15 Runic inscriptions in\r\nGermany the two earliest occur on iron pikes. There is no doubt that the\r\nrunes of the Kovel spear-head and of the ring came from Gothic\r\ntribes[1219].\" These Southern Goths, later called Moeso-Goths, because\r\nthey settled in Moesia (Bulgaria and Servia), had certain physical and\r\neven moral characters of the Old Teutons, as seen in the Emperor\r\nMaximinus, born in Thrace of a Goth by an Alan woman--very tall, strong,\r\nhandsome, with light hair and milk-white skin[1220], temperate in all\r\nthings and of great mental energy.\r\n\r\nBefore their absorption in the surrounding Bulgar and Slav populations\r\nthe Moeso-Goths were evangelised in the fourth century by their bishop\r\nUlfilas (\"Wolf\"), whose fragmentary translation of Scripture, preserved\r\nin the _Codex Argenteus_ of Upsala, is the most precious monument of\r\nearly Teutonic speech extant.\r\n\r\nTo find the pure Nordic type at the present day we must seek for it in\r\nScandinavia, which possesses one of the most highly individualised\r\npopulations in Europe. The Osterdal, and the neighbourhood of Vaage in\r\nUpper Gudbrandsdal in Norway, and the Dalarna district in Sweden contain\r\nperhaps the purest Teutonic type in all Europe, the cephalic index\r\nfalling well below 78. But along the Norwegian coasts there is a strong\r\ntendency to brachycephaly (the index rising to 82-3), combined with a\r\ndarkening of the hair and eye colour (the type occurs also in Denmark),\r\nindicating an outlying lodgement of the Alpine race from Central Europe.\r\nThe anthropological history of Scandinavia, according to Ripley, is as\r\nfollows: \"Norway has ... probably been peopled from two directions, one\r\nelement coming from Sweden and another from the south by way of Denmark.\r\nThe latter type, now found on the sea coast and especially along the\r\nleast attractive portion of it, has been closely hemmed in by the\r\nTeutonic immigration from Sweden[1221].\" Brachycephalic people already\r\noccupied parts of Denmark in the Stone Age[1222], and, according to the\r\nscanty information available, the present population is extremely mixed.\r\nOne-third of the children have light hair and light eyes, and tall\r\nstature coincides in the main with fair colouring, but in Bornholm where\r\nthe cephalic index is 80 there is a taller dark type and a shorter light\r\ntype, the latter perhaps akin to the Eastern variety of the Alpine\r\nrace[1223].\r\n\r\nThe original Nordic type is by no means universally represented among\r\nthe present Germanic peoples. From the examination made some years ago\r\nof 6,758,000 school children[1224], it would appear that about 31 per\r\ncent. of living Germans may be classed as blonds, 14 as brunettes, and\r\n55 as mixed; and further that of the blonds about 43 per cent. are\r\ncentred in North, 33 in Central and 24 in South Germany. The brunettes\r\nincrease, generally speaking, southwards, South Bavaria showing only\r\nabout 14 per cent. of blonds, and the same law holds good of the\r\nlong-heads and the round-heads respectively. To what cause is to be\r\nattributed this profound modification of this branch of the Nordic type\r\nin the direction of the south?\r\n\r\nThat the Teutons ranged in considerable numbers far beyond their\r\nnorthern seats is proved by the spread of the German language to the\r\ncentral highlands, and beyond them down the southern slopes, where a\r\nrude High German dialect lingered on in the so-called \"Seven Communes\"\r\nof the Veronese district far into the nineteenth century. But after\r\npassing the Main, which appears to have long formed the ethnical divide\r\nfor Central Europe, they entered the zone of the brown Alpine\r\nround-heads[1225], to whom they communicated their speech, but by whom\r\nthey were largely modified in physical appearance. The process has for\r\nlong ages been much the same everywhere--perennial streams of Teutonism\r\nsetting steadily from the north, all successively submerged in the great\r\nocean of dark round-headed humanity, which under many names has occupied\r\nthe central uplands and eastern plains since the Neolithic Age,\r\noverflowing also in later times into the Balkan Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThis absorption of what is assumed to be the superior in the inferior\r\ntype, may be due to the conditions of the general movement--warlike\r\nbands, accompanied by few women, appearing as conquerors in the midst of\r\nthe Alpines and merging with them in the great mass of brachycephalic\r\npeoples. Or is the transformation to be explained by de Lapouge's\r\ndoctrine, that cranial forms are not so much a question of race as of\r\nsocial conditions, and that, owing to the increasingly unfavourable\r\nnature of these conditions, there is a general tendency for the superior\r\nlong-heads to be absorbed in the inferior round-heads[1226].\r\n\r\nThe fact that dolichocephaly is more prevalent in cities and\r\nbrachycephaly in rural areas has been interpreted in various ways. De\r\nLapouge[1227] contended that in France the restless and more\r\nenterprising long-heads migrated from the rural districts in\r\ndisproportionate numbers to the towns, where they died out. For the\r\ndepartment of Aveyron he gives a table showing a steady rise of the\r\ncephalic index from 71.4 in prehistoric times to 86.5 in 1899, and\r\nattributes this to the dolichos gravitating chiefly to the large towns,\r\nas O. Ammon has also shown for Baden. L. Laloy summed up the results\r\nthus: France is being depopulated, and, what is worse, it is precisely\r\nthe best section of the inhabitants that disappears, the section most\r\nproductive in eminent men in all departments of learning, while the\r\nignorant and rude _pecus_ alone increase.\r\n\r\nThese views have met with favour even across the Atlantic, but are by no\r\nmeans universally accepted. The ground seems cut from the whole theory\r\nby A. Macalister, who read a paper at the Toronto Meeting of the British\r\nAssociation, 1897, on \"The Causes of Brachycephaly,\" showing that the\r\ninfantile and primitive skull is relatively long, and that there is a\r\ngradual change, phylogenetic (racial) as well as ontogenetic\r\n(individual) toward brachycephaly, which is certainly correlated with,\r\nand is apparently produced by, cerebral activity and growth; in the\r\nprocess of development in the individual and the race the frontal lobes\r\nof the brain grow the more rapidly and tend to fill out and broaden the\r\nskull[1228]. The tendency would thus have nothing to do with rustic and\r\nurban life, nor would the round be necessarily, if at all, inferior to\r\nthe long head. Some of de Lapouge's generalisations are also traversed\r\nby Livi[1229], Deniker[1230], Sergi[1231] and others, and the whole\r\nquestion is admirably summarised by W. Z. Ripley[1232].\r\n\r\nBut whatever be the cause, the fact must be accepted that _Homo\r\nEuropaeus_ (the Nordics) becomes merged southwards in _Homo Alpinus_\r\nwhose names, as stated, are many. Broca and many continental writers use\r\nthe name _Kelt_ or _Slavo-Kelt_, which has led to much confusion. But it\r\nmerely means for them the great mass of brachycephalic peoples in\r\nCentral Europe, where, at various times, Celtic and Slavonic languages\r\nhave prevailed.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that in the Alpine region, especially Tyrol, where the\r\nbrachy element comes to a focus, there is a peculiar form of round-head\r\nwhich has greatly puzzled de Lapouge, but may perhaps be accounted for\r\non the hypothesis of two brachy types here fused in one. To explain the\r\nexceedingly round Tyrolese head, which shows affinities on the one hand\r\nwith the Swiss, on the other with the Illyrian and Albanian, that is,\r\nwith the normal Alpine, a Mongol strain has been suggested, but is\r\nrightly rejected by Franz Tappeiner as inadmissible on many\r\ngrounds[1233]. De Ujfalvy[1234], a follower of de Lapouge, looks on the\r\nhyperbrachy Tyrolese as descendants of the ancient Rhaetians or Rasenes,\r\nwhom so many regard as the parent stock of the Etruscans.\r\n\r\nBut Montelius (with most other modern ethnologists) rejects the land\r\nroute from the north, and brings the Etruscans by the sea route direct\r\nfrom the Aegean and Lydia (Asia Minor). They are the Thessalian\r\nPelasgians whom Hellanikos of Lesbos brings to Campania, or the\r\nTyrrhenian Pelasgians transported by Antiklides from Asia Minor to\r\nEtruria, and he is \"quite sure that the archaeological facts in Central\r\nand North Italy ... prove the truth of this tradition[1235].\" Of course,\r\nuntil the affinities of the Etruscan language are determined, from which\r\nwe are still as far off as ever[1236], Etruscan origins must remain\r\nchiefly an archaeological question. Even the help afforded by the crania\r\nfrom the Etruscan tombs is but slight, both long and round heads being\r\nhere found in the closest association. Sergi, who also brings the\r\nEtruscans from the east, explains this by supposing that, being\r\nPelasgians, they were of the same dolicho Mediterranean stock as the\r\nItalians (Ligurians) themselves, and differed only from the brachy\r\nUmbrians of Aryan speech. Hence the skulls from the tombs are of two\r\ntypes, the intruding Aryan, and the Mediterranean, the latter, whether\r\nrepresenting native Ligurians or intruding Etruscans, being\r\nindistinguishable. \"I can show,\" he says, \"Etruscan crania, which differ\r\nin no respect from the Italian [Ligurian], from the oldest graves, as I\r\ncan also show heads from the Etruscan graves which do not differ from\r\nthose still found in Aryan lands, whether Slav, Keltic, or\r\nGermanic[1237].\" Perhaps the difficulty is best explained by Feist's\r\nsuggestion that the Etruscans were merely a highly civilised warlike\r\naristocracy, spreading thinly over the conquered population by which\r\nthey were ultimately absorbed[1238].\r\n\r\nThe migrations of the Celts preceded those of the Teutonic peoples to\r\nwhom they were probably closely related in race as in language[1239]. At\r\nthe beginning of the historical period Celts are found in the west of\r\nGermany in the region of the Rhine and the Weser. Possibly about 600\r\nB.C. they occupied Gaul and parts of the Iberian peninsula, subsequently\r\ncrossing over into the British Isles. In Italy they came into conflict\r\nwith the rising power of Rome, and, after the battle of the Allia (390\r\nB.C.) occupied Rome itself. Descents were also made into the Danube\r\nvalley and the Balkans, and later (280 B.C.) into Thessaly. At the\r\nheight of their power they extended from the north of Scotland to the\r\nsouthern shores of Spain and Portugal, and from the northern coasts of\r\nGermany to a little south of Senegaglia. To the west their boundary was\r\nthe Atlantic, to the east, the Black Sea[1240].\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the indiscriminate use of the term Celt has led to much\r\nconfusion. For historians and geographers the Celts are the people in\r\nthe centre and west of Europe referred to by writers of antiquity under\r\nthe names of _Keltoi_, _Celtae_, _Galli_ and _Galatae_. But many\r\nanthropologists, especially on the continent, regard Celts and Gauls as\r\nrepresenting two well-determined physical types, the former\r\nbrachycephalic, with short sturdy build and chestnut coloured hair\r\n(Alpine type), and the latter dolichocephalic with tall stature, fair\r\ncomplexion and light hair (Nordic type). Linguists, ignoring physical\r\ncharacters, class as Celts those people who speak an Indo-European\r\nlanguage characterised in particular by the loss of p and by the\r\nmodifications undergone by mutation of initial consonants, while for\r\nmany archaeologists the Celts were the people responsible for the spread\r\nof the civilisation of the Hallstatt and La Tene periods, that is of the\r\nearlier and later Iron Age[1241].\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising therefore that it has been proposed to drop the\r\nword Celt out of anthropological nomenclature, as having no ethnical\r\nsignificance. But this, says Rice Holmes[1242], \"is because writers on\r\nethnology have not kept their heads clear.\" And in particular one point\r\nhas been overlooked. \"Just as the French are called after one conquering\r\npeople, the Franks; just as the English are called after one conquering\r\npeople, the Angles; so the heterogeneous Celtae of Transalpine Gaul were\r\ncalled after one conquering people; and that people were the Celts, or\r\nrather a branch of the Celts in the true sense of the word. The Celts,\r\nin short, were the people who introduced the Celtic language into Gaul,\r\ninto Asia Minor, and into Britain; the people who included the victors\r\nof the Allia, the conquerors of Gallia Celtica, and the conquerors of\r\nGallia Bel['g]ica; the people whom Polybius called indifferently Gauls\r\nand Celts; the people who, as Pausanius said, were originally called\r\nCelts and afterwards called Gauls. If certain ancient writers confounded\r\nthe tall fair Celts who spoke Celtic with the tall fair Germans who\r\nspoke German the ancient writers who were better informed avoided such a\r\nmistake.... Let us therefore restore to the word 'Celt' the ethnical\r\nsignificance which of right belongs to it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not certain at what date the Celtic tribes effected settlements in\r\nGreat Britain, but it is held by many that the earliest invasions were\r\nnot prior to the sixth or possibly even the fifth century. At the time\r\nof the Roman conquest the Celts were divided into two linguistic groups,\r\n_Goidelic_, represented at the present day by Irish, Manx and Scotch\r\nGaelic, and _Brythonic_, including Welsh, Cornish and Breton. These\r\ngroups must have been virtually identical save in two particulars. In\r\nBrythonic the labial velar q became p (a change which apparently took\r\nplace before the time of Pytheas), whilst in Goidelic the sound remained\r\nunaltered. q is retained in the earlier ogham inscriptions, but by the\r\nend of the seventh century it had lost the labial element, appearing in\r\nOld Irish as c. Thus O. Irish _cenn_, head, as in Kenmare, Kintyre,\r\nKinsale, equates with Brythonic _pen_, as in Penryn (Cornwall), Penrhyn\r\n(Wales), Penkridge (Staffordshire), Penruddock, Penrith and many others.\r\nThe two groups are therefore distinguished as the Q Celts and the P\r\nCelts[1243]. From the fact that Goidelic retained the q it has been\r\ncommonly assumed that the Goidels were separated from the main Celtic\r\nstock at a time before the labialisation had taken place, but many\r\nscholars maintain that the parent Goidelic was evolved in Ireland, and\r\nwas carried from that island to Man and Scotland in the early centuries\r\nof our era[1244].\r\n\r\nFrom an anthropological point of view, the Picts are if possible more\r\ndifficult to identify than the Celts. But the question is not between\r\ntall fair long-heads and short dark round-heads, but between short dark\r\nlong-heads (neolithic aborigines) and Celts. The Pictish question is\r\nsummed up by Rice Holmes[1245] and the various theories have been more\r\nrecently reviewed by Windisch[1246] giving a valuable summary of earlier\r\nwritings. On the one hand it is maintained as \"the most tenable\r\nhypothesis that the Picts were non-Aryans, whom the first Celtic\r\nmigrations found already settled here ... descendants of the\r\nAborigines[1247].\" Windisch[1248] at the other extreme, regards them as\r\nlate comers into North Britain, when Scotland was already occupied by\r\nBrythonic tribes. But the geographical distribution of the Picts in\r\nhistorical times suggests rather a people driven into mountainous\r\nregions by successive conquerors, than the settlements of successful\r\ninvaders. Also it is not improbable that the language of the Bronze Age\r\nlingered in these wilder districts, and this would account for the fact\r\nthat St Columba had to employ an interpreter in his relations with the\r\nPicts; though this is explained by others on the assumption that Pictish\r\nwas Brythonic. The linguistic evidence is however extremely slight, only\r\na few words presumably Pictish having survived and these through Celtic\r\nwriters. \"The one absolutely certain conclusion to which the student of\r\nethnology can come is that the name of the Picts has not been proved to\r\nbe of pre-Aryan origin[1249].\" \"For me,\" continues Rice Holmes (p. 417),\r\n\"the Picts were a mixed people comprising descendants of the neolithic\r\naborigines, of the Round Barrow Race, and of the Celtic invaders--a\r\nmixed people who [or at least whose aristocracy] spoke a Celtic\r\ndialect.\"\r\n\r\nBefore attempting a survey of the ethnology of Britain it is necessary\r\nto ascertain what ethnic elements the area contained before the arrival\r\nof the Celts. The neolithic inhabitants, the short, dark dolichocephals\r\nof Mediterranean type have already been described (Ch. XIII.). Their\r\nremains are associated with the characteristic forms of sepulchral\r\nmonuments the dolmens and the long barrows. But towards the end of the\r\nStone Age a brachycephalic race was already penetrating into the\r\nislands. This appears to have been a peaceful infiltration, at any rate\r\nin certain districts, where remains of the two types are found side by\r\nside and there is evidence of racial intermixture. The brachycephals\r\nintroduced a new form of sepulture, making their burial mounds circular\r\ninstead of elongated, whence Thurnam's convenient formula, \"long barrow,\r\nlong skull; round barrow, round skull.\" But the earlier view that there\r\nwas a definite transition from long heads, neolithic culture and long\r\nbarrows, to round heads, bronze culture and round barrows can no longer\r\nbe maintained. \"It is often taken for granted that no round barrows were\r\nerected in Britain before the close of the Neolithic Age, and that the\r\nearliest of the brachycephalic invaders whose remains have been found in\r\nthem landed with bronze weapons in their hands[1250].\" But there is\r\nabundant evidence that the brachycephalic element preceded the knowledge\r\nof metals, and a number of round barrows in Yorkshire and further north\r\nshow no trace of bronze.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the majority of the round barrows belong to the Bronze Age,\r\nand the physical type of their builders is sufficiently well marked. The\r\nstature is remarkably tall, attaining a height of 1.763 m. or over 5 ft.\r\n9 ins. The skull is brachycephalic with an average index of about 80. It\r\nis also characterised by great strength and ruggedness of outline, with\r\n(often) a sloping forehead, prominent supraciliary ridges, and a certain\r\ndegree of prognathism.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rolleston's description \"The eyebrows must have given a\r\nbeetling and probably even formidable appearance to the upper part of\r\nthe face, whilst the boldly outstanding and heavy cheekbones must have\r\nproduced an impression of raw and rough strength. Overhung at its root,\r\nthe nose must have projected boldly forward.\" And Thurnam adds \"the\r\nprominence of the large incisor and canine teeth is so great as to give\r\nan almost bestial expression to the skull[1251].\"\r\n\r\nAlthough this type is conveniently called the Round Barrow type, or even\r\nthe Round Barrow Race, the round barrows also contain remains of a\r\ndifferent racial character. The skull form shows a more extreme\r\nbrachycephaly, with an index of 84 or 85, and exhibits none of the\r\nrugged features associated with the true Round Barrow type. On the\r\ncontrary, of the two typical groups, one from round barrows in\r\nGlamorganshire, and the other from short cists in Aberdeenshire not one\r\nof the skulls is prognathous, the supraciliary ridges are but slightly\r\ndeveloped, the cheek bones are not prominent, the face is both broad and\r\nshort and the lower jaw is small. But the greatest contrast is in the\r\nheight, which averages in the two groups, 1.664 m. and 1.6 m.\r\nrespectively, _i.e._ 5 ft. 5-3/4 ins. and 5 ft. 3 ins. All these\r\ncharacters connect this type closely with the Alpine type on the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThese round-headed peoples have been the subject of much discussion ably\r\nsummarised and criticised by Rice Holmes, whose conclusion perhaps best\r\nrepresents the view now taken of their affinities and origins.\r\n\r\n\"The great mistake that has been made in discussing the question is the\r\nnot uncommon assumption that the brachycephalic immigrants who buried\r\ntheir dead in round barrows arrived in Britain at one time, and came\r\nfrom one place. Some of them certainly appeared before the end of the\r\nNeolithic Age: others may have introduced bronze implements or\r\nornaments; others doubtless came, in successive hordes, during the\r\ncourse of the Bronze Age. Some of those who belonged to the Grenelle\r\nrace [Alpine type], who certainly came from Eastern Europe and possibly\r\nfrom Asia, and whose centre of dispersion was the Alpine region, may\r\nhave started from Gaul; others could have traced their origin to some\r\nRhenish tribe; and I am inclined to believe that those who belonged to\r\nthe characteristic rugged Round Barrow type crossed over, for the most\r\npart, from Denmark or the out-lying islands[1252].\"\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the Romans, who mingled little with the aborigines\r\nand made, perhaps, but slight impression on the speech or type of the\r\nBritish populations, a great transformation was effected in these\r\nrespects by the arrival of the historical Teutonic tribes. Hand in hand\r\nwith the Teutonic invasions went a lust for expansion on the part of the\r\npeoples in Ireland. Settlements were effected by them in South Wales and\r\nAnglesey, the Isle of Man and Argyll, probably also in North Devon and\r\nCornwall. For many generations the south and east of England were the\r\nscenes of fierce struggles, during which the Romano-British civilisation\r\nperished. Only in more inaccessible districts, such as the fen country,\r\nmay a British population have survived, though Celtic languages are not\r\nyet dislodged from their mountain strongholds in Wales and Scotland, and\r\nlingered for many centuries in Strathclyde and Cornwall. After the\r\nstrengthening of the Teutonic element by the arrival of the\r\nScandinavians and Normans, all very much of the same physical type, no\r\nserious accessions were made to this composite ethnical group, which on\r\nthe east side ranged uninterruptedly from the Channel to the Grampians.\r\nLater the expansion was continued northwards beyond the Grampians, and\r\nwestwards through Strathclyde to Ireland, while now the spread of\r\neducation and the development of the industries are already threatening\r\nto absorb the last strongholds of Celtic speech in Wales, the Highlands,\r\nand Ireland.\r\n\r\nThanks to its isolation in the extreme west, Ireland had been left\r\nuntouched by some of the above described ethnical movements. It is\r\ndoubtful whether Palaeolithic man ever reached this region, and but few\r\neven of the round-heads ranged so far west during the Bronze Age[1253].\r\nThe land oscillations during post-Glacial times appear to have been\r\npractically identical over an area including northern Ireland, the\r\nsouthern half of Scotland, and northern England. There was a period of\r\ndepression followed by one of elevation. The Larne beach-deposits prove\r\nthat Neolithic man was in existence from almost the beginning of the\r\ndeposition of that series until after its conclusion. The estuarine\r\nclays of Belfast Lough correspond to the depression, and the Neolithic\r\nperiod extended from at least near the top of the lower estuarine clay\r\nto the beach-deposit of yellow sand which overlies it, or possibly till\r\nlater. It is to this period of elevation that the Neolithic sites among\r\nthe sand dunes of North Ireland belong; those of Whitepark Bay and\r\nPortstewart, for example, extend to the maximum elevation. A slight\r\nmovement of subsidence of about five feet in recent times has left the\r\nsurface as we now find it. The implements found in the Larne gravels\r\ncorrespond to some extent with those of Danish kitchen-middens; this\r\nwas not a dwelling site but a quarry-shop or roughing-out place, the\r\nserviceable flakes being taken away for further manipulation; it thus\r\nbelongs to the earliest phase of neolithic times. The sandhill sites\r\nwere occupied, continuously and occasionally, during neolithic times,\r\nthrough the Bronze Age, and into the Iron and Christian periods[1254].\r\nNina F. Layard has recently studied the Larne raised beach and exposed a\r\nnew section. She states that \"Taken as a whole the flints certainly do\r\nnot correspond at all closely either to the Palaeoliths or Neoliths so\r\nfar found in England.... Some are strongly reminiscent of well-known\r\ndrift type.... Again, there are shapes that bear a closer resemblance to\r\nsome of the earliest Neolithic types[1255].\" She believes that, from\r\ntheir rolled condition, they were derived from another source.\r\n\r\nF. J. Bigger[1256] described some kitchen-middens at Portnafeadog, near\r\nRoundstone, Connemara, which yielded stone hammers but no worked flints,\r\npottery or metal-ware. The chief interest of this paper is due to the\r\nfact that it is the first record of the occurrence of vast quantities of\r\nthe shells of _Purpura lapillus_, all of which were broken in such a\r\nmanner that the animal could easily be extracted. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the purple dye was manufactured here in prehistoric times[1257]. W.\r\nJ. Knowles[1258] suggests from the close resemblance--in fact\r\nidentity--of a great number of neolithic objects in Ireland with\r\npalaeolithic forms in France (Saint-Acheul, Moustier, Solutre, La\r\nMadeleine types), that the Irish objects bridge over the gap between the\r\ntwo ages, and were worked by tribes from the continent following the\r\nmigration of the reindeer northwards. These peoples may have continued\r\nto make tools of palaeolithic types, while at the same time coming under\r\nthe influence of the neolithic culture gradually arriving from some\r\nsouthern region. The astonishing development of this neolithic culture\r\nin the remote island on the confines of the west, as illustrated in W.\r\nC. Borlase's sumptuous volumes[1259], is a perpetual wonder, but is\r\nrendered less inexplicable if we assume an immense duration of the New\r\nStone Age in the British Isles. The Irish dolmen-builders were\r\npresumably of the same long-headed stock as those of Britain[1260], and\r\nthey were followed by Celtic-speaking Goidels who may have come directly\r\nfrom the continent[1261], and there is evidence in Ptolemy and elsewhere\r\nof the presence of Brythonic tribes from Gaul in the east. Since these\r\nearly historic times the intruders have been almost exclusively of\r\nTeutonic race, and Viking invaders from Norway and Denmark founded the\r\nearliest towns such as Dublin, Waterford and Limerick. Now all alike,\r\nsave for an almost insignificant and rapidly dwindling minority, have\r\nassumed the speech of the English and Lowland Scotch intruders, who\r\nbegan to arrive late in the 12th century, and are now chiefly massed in\r\nUlster, Leinster, and all the large towns. The rich and highly poetic\r\nIrish language has a copious medieval literature of the utmost\r\nimportance to students of European origins.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland few ethnical changes or displacements have occurred since\r\nthe colonisation of portions of the west by Gaelic-speaking Scottic\r\ntribes from Ireland, and the English (Angle) occupation of the Lothians.\r\nThe Grampians have during historic times formed the main ethnical divide\r\nbetween the two elements, and brooklets which can be taken at a leap are\r\nshown where the opposite banks have for hundreds of years been\r\nrespectively held by formerly hostile, but now friendly communities of\r\nGaelic and broad Scotch speech. Here the chief intruders have been\r\nScandinavians, whose descendants may still be recognised in Caithness,\r\nthe Hebrides, and the Orkney and Shetland groups. Faint echoes of the\r\nold Norrena tongue are said still to linger amongst the sturdy\r\nShetlanders, whose assimilation to the dominant race began only after\r\ntheir transfer from Norway to the Crown of Scotland.\r\n\r\nSince 1901 the researches of Gray and Tocher[1262] on the pigmentation\r\nof some 500,000 school children of Scotland have increased our\r\ninformation as to racial distribution. The average percentage of boys\r\nwith fair hair is nearly 25 for the whole of the country, and when this\r\nis compared with 82 in Schleswig Holstein \"we are driven to the\r\nconclusion that the pure Norse or Anglo-Saxon element in our population\r\nis by no means predominant. There is evidently also a dark or brunette\r\nelement which is at least equal in amount and probably greater than that\r\nof the Norse element\" (p. 380). Pure blue eyes for the whole of Scotland\r\naverage 14.7 per cent., which may be compared with 42.9 in Prussia. The\r\ngreatest density for fair hair and eyes is to be found in the great\r\nriver valleys opening on to the German Ocean, and also in the Western\r\nIsles. The Tweed, Forth, Tay and Don all show indications of settlements\r\nof a blonde race \"probably due to Anglo-Saxon invasions,\" but the\r\nmaximum is to be found at the mouth of the Spey. The high percentage\r\nhere and in the Hebrides and opposite coasts, the authors trace to\r\nViking invasions. The percentage of dark hair for boys and girls is 25.2\r\nas compared with 1.3 in Prussian school children, the maximum density as\r\nwe should expect being in the west. Jet black hair (1.2%) has its\r\nmaximum density in the central highlands and wild west coast.\r\nBeddoe[1263] commenting on Gray and Tocher's results calculates an even\r\nhigher percentage of black hair (over 2%) \"either within or astride of\r\nthe Highland frontier. Except Paisley, there is not a single instance\r\nsouth of the Forth, nor one between the Spey and the Firth of Tay.\r\nSurely there is something 'racial' here.\" Beddoe's map, constructed from\r\nGray and Tocher's statistics, clearly indicates the distribution of\r\nracial types.\r\n\r\nThe work carried on in Wales for a number of years by H. J. Fleure and\r\nT. C. James[1264] has produced some extremely interesting results. The\r\nchief types (based on measurements and observations of head, face, nose,\r\nskin, hair and eye colour, stature, etc.) fall into the following\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n1. \"The fundamental type is certainly the long-headed brunet of the\r\nmoorlands and their inland valleys. He is universally recognised as\r\nbelonging to the Mediterranean race of Sergi and as dating back in this\r\ncountry to early Neolithic times.\" The cephalic index is about 78, with\r\nhigh colouring, dark hair and eyes, and stature rather below the\r\naverage. A possible mixture of earlier stocks is shown in a\r\nlonger-headed type (c.i. about 75), with well-marked occiput, very dark\r\nhair and eyes, swarthy complexion, and average stature (about 1690 mm. =\r\n5 ft. 6-1/2 ins.). Occasionally in North Wales the occurrence of lank\r\nblack hair, a sallow complexion and prominent cheekbones suggests a\r\n\"Mongoloid\" type; and a type with small stature, black, closely curled\r\nhair and a rather broad nose has negroid reminiscences. The Plynlymon\r\nmoorlands contain a \"nest\" of extreme dolichocephaly and an unusually\r\nhigh percentage of red hair.\r\n\r\n2. Nordic-Alpine type, with cephalic index mainly between 76 and 81.\r\nThis group includes (_a_) a \"local version of the Nordic type\" occurring\r\nat Newcastle Emlyn and in South and South-West Pembrokeshire with fair\r\nhair and eyes, usually tall stature and great strength of brow, jaw and\r\nchin; (_b_) a heavier variant on the Welsh border, often with cephalic\r\nindex above 80, and extremely tall stature; (_c_) the Borreby or\r\nBeaker-Maker type, broad-headed and short-faced with darker\r\npigmentation, probably a cross between Alpine and Nordic, characteristic\r\nof the long cleft from Corwen _via_ Bala to Tabyllyn and Towyn.\r\n\r\n3. Dark bullet-headed short thick-set men of the general type denoted by\r\nthe term Alpine or more exactly perhaps by the term Cevenole are found,\r\nthough not commonly, in North Montgomeryshire valleys.\r\n\r\n4. Powerfully built, often intensely dark, broad-headed, broad-faced,\r\nstrong and square jawed men are characteristic of the Ardudwy coast, the\r\nSouth Glamorgan coast, Newquay district (Cardiganshire) and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe authors observe that Type 1 with its variations contributes\r\n\"considerable numbers to the ministries of the various churches,\r\npossibly in part from inherent and racial leanings, but partly also\r\nbecause these are the people of the moorlands. The idealism of such\r\npeople usually expresses itself in music, poetry, literature and\r\nreligion rather than in architecture, painting and plastic arts\r\ngenerally. They rarely have a sufficiency of material resources for the\r\nlatter activities. These types also contribute a number of men to the\r\nmedical profession.... The successful commercial men, who have given the\r\nWelsh their extraordinarily prominent place in British trade (shipping\r\nfirms for example) usually belong to types 2 or 4, rather than to 1, as\r\nalso do the majority of Welsh members of Parliament, though there are\r\nexceptions of the first importance. The Nordic type is marked by\r\ningenuity and enterprise in striking out new lines. Type 2 (_c_) in\r\nWales is remarkable for governmental ability of the administrative kind\r\nas well as for independence of thought and critical power\" (p. 119).\r\n\r\nWe have now all the elements needed to unravel the ethnical tangle of\r\nthe present inhabitants of the British Isles. The astonishing prevalence\r\neverywhere of the moderately dolicho heads is at once explained by the\r\nabsence of brachy immigrants except in the Bronze period, and these\r\ncould do no more than raise the cephalic index from about 70 or 72 to\r\nthe present mean of about 78. With the other perhaps less stable\r\ncharacters the case is not always quite so simple. The brunettes,\r\nrepresenting the Mediterranean type, certainly increase, as we should\r\nexpect, from north-east to south-west, though even here there is a\r\nconsiderable dark patch, due to local causes, in the home shires about\r\nLondon[1265]. But the stature, almost everywhere a troublesome factor,\r\nseems to wander somewhat lawlessly over the land.\r\n\r\nAlthough a short stature more or less coincides with brunetteness in\r\nEngland and Wales, and the observations in Ireland are too few to be\r\nrelied on, no such parallelism can be traced in Scotland. The west\r\n(Inverness and Argyllshire), though as dark as South Wales, shows an\r\naverage stature of 1.73 m. to 1.74 m. (5 ft. 8 ins. to 5 ft. 8-1/2\r\nins.), which is higher than the average for the whole of Britain. And\r\nSouth-west Scotland, where the type is fairly dark, contains the tallest\r\npopulation in Europe, if not in the world. Ripley suggests either that\r\n\"some ethnic element of which no pure trace remains, served to increase\r\nthe stature of the western Highlanders without at the same time\r\nconducing to blondness; or else some local influences of natural\r\nselection or environment are responsible for it[1266]\"; and he hints\r\nalso that the linguistic distinction between Gaels and Brythons may\r\nhave been associated with physical variation.\r\n\r\nThe English tongue need not detain us long. Its qualities, illustrated\r\nin the noblest of all literatures, are patent to the world[1267], indeed\r\nhave earned for it from Jacob Grimm the title of _Welt-Sprache_, the\r\n\"World Speech.\" It belongs, as might be anticipated from the northern\r\norigin of the Teutonic element in Britain, to the Low German division of\r\nthe Teutonic branch of the Aryan family. Despite extreme pressure from\r\nNorman French, continued for over 200 years (1066-1300), it has remained\r\nfaithful to this connection in its inner structure, which reveals not a\r\ntrace of Neo-Latin influences. The phonetic system has undergone\r\nprofound changes, which can be only indirectly and to a small extent due\r\nto French action. What English owes to French and Latin is a very large\r\nnumber, many thousands, of words, some superadded to, some superseding\r\ntheir Saxon equivalents, but altogether immensely increasing its wealth\r\nof expression, while giving it a transitional position between the\r\nsomewhat sharply contrasted Germanic and Romance worlds.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Romance peoples, that is, the French, Spaniards, Portuguese,\r\nItalians, Rumanians, many Swiss and Belgians, who were entirely\r\nassimilated in speech and largely in their civil institutions to their\r\nRoman masters, the paramount position, a sort of international hegemony,\r\nhas been taken by the French nation since the decadence of Spain under\r\nthe feeble successors of Philip II. The constituent elements of these\r\nGallo-Romans, as they may be called, are much the same as those of the\r\nBritish peoples, but differ in their distribution and relative\r\nproportions. Thus the Iberians (Aquitani, Pictones, and later Vascones),\r\nwho may perhaps be identified with the neolithic long-heads[1268], do\r\nnot appear ever to have ranged much farther north than Brittany, and\r\nwere Aryanised in pre-Roman times by the P-speaking Celts everywhere\r\nnorth of the Garonne. The prehistoric Teutons again, who had advanced\r\nbeyond the Rhine at an early period (Caesar says _antiquitus_) into the\r\npresent Belgium, were mainly confined to the northern provinces. Even\r\nthe historic Teutons (chiefly Franks and Burgundians) penetrated little\r\nbeyond the Seine in the north and the present Burgundy in the east,\r\nwhile the Vandals, Visigoths and a few others passed rapidly through to\r\nIberia beyond the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nThus the greater part of the land, say from the Seine-Marne basin to the\r\nMediterranean, continued to be held by the Romanised mass of Alpine type\r\nthroughout all the central and most of the southern provinces, and\r\nelsewhere in the south by the Romanised long-headed Mediterranean type.\r\nThis great preponderance of the Romanised Alpine masses explains the\r\nrapid absorption of the Teutonic intruders, who were all, except the\r\nFleming section of the Belgae, completely assimilated to the\r\nGallo-Romans before the close of the tenth century. It also explains the\r\nperhaps still more remarkable fact that the Norsemen who settled (912)\r\nunder Rollo in Normandy were all practically Frenchmen when a few\r\ngenerations later they followed their Duke William to the conquest of\r\nSaxon England. Thus the only intractable groups have proved to be the\r\nBasques[1269] and the Bretons, both of whom to this day retain their\r\nspeech in isolated corners of the country. With these exceptions the\r\nwhole of France, save the debateable area of Alsace-Lorraine, presents\r\nin its speech a certain homogeneous character, the standard language\r\n(_langue d'oil_[1270]) being current throughout all the northern and\r\ncentral provinces, while it is steadily gaining upon the southern form\r\n(_langue d'oc_[1270]) still surviving in the rural districts of\r\nLimousin and Provence.\r\n\r\nBut pending a more thorough fusion of such tenacious elements as\r\nBasques, Bretons, Auvergnats, and Savoyards, we can scarcely yet speak\r\nof a common French type, but only of a common nationality. Tall stature,\r\nlong skulls, fair or light brown colour, grey or blue eyes, still\r\nprevail, as might be expected, in the north, these being traits common\r\nalike to the prehistoric Belgae, the Franks of the Merovingian and\r\nCarlovingian empires, and Rollo's Norsemen. With these contrast the\r\nsouthern peoples of short stature, olive-brown skin, round heads, dark\r\nbrown or black eyes and hair. The tendency towards uniformity has\r\nproceeded far more rapidly in the urban than in the rural districts.\r\nHence the citizens of Paris, Lyons, Bordeaux, Marseilles and other large\r\ntowns, present fewer and less striking contrasts than the natives of the\r\nold historical provinces, where are still distinguished the loquacious\r\nand mendacious Gascon, the pliant and versatile Basque, the slow and\r\nwary Norman, the dreamy and fanatical Breton, the quick and enterprising\r\nBurgundian, and the bright, intelligent, more even-tempered native of\r\nTouraine, a typical Frenchman occupying the heart of the land, and\r\nholding, as it were, the balance between all the surrounding elements.\r\n\r\nIn Spain and Portugal we have again the same ethnological elements, but\r\nalso again in different proportions and differently distributed, with\r\nothers superadded--proto-Phoenicians and later Phoenicians\r\n(Carthaginians), Romans, Visigoths, Vandals, and still later Berbers and\r\nArabs. Here the Celtic-speaking mixed peoples mingled in prehistoric\r\ntimes with the long-headed Mediterraneans, an ethnical fusion known to\r\nthe ancients, who labelled it \"Keltiberian[1271].\" But, as in Britain,\r\nthe other intruders were mostly long-heads, with the striking result\r\nthat the Peninsula presents to-day exactly the same uniform cranial type\r\nas the British Isles. Even the range (76 to 79) and the mean (78) of the\r\ncephalic index are the same, rising in Spain to 80 only in the Basque\r\ncorner. As Ripley states, \"the average cephalic index of 78 occurs\r\nnowhere else so uniformly distributed in Europe\" except in Norway, and\r\nthis uniformity \"is the concomitant and index of two relatively pure,\r\nalbeit widely different, ethnic types--Mediterranean in Spain, Teutonic\r\nin Norway[1272].\"\r\n\r\nIn other respects the social, one might almost say the national, groups\r\nare both more numerous and perhaps even more sharply discriminated in\r\nthe Peninsula than in France. Besides the Basques and Portuguese, the\r\nlatter with a considerable strain of negro blood[1273], we have such\r\nvery distinct populations as the haughty and punctilious Castilians, who\r\nunder an outward show of pride and honour, are capable of much meanness;\r\nthe sprightly and vainglorious Andalusians, who have been called the\r\nGascons of Spain, yet of graceful address and seductive manners; the\r\nmorose and impassive Murcians, indolent because fatalists; the gay\r\nValencians given to much dancing and revelry, but also to sudden fits of\r\nmurderous rage, holding life so cheap that they will hire themselves out\r\nas assassins, and cut their bread with the blood-stained knife of their\r\nlast victim; the dull and superstitious Aragonese, also given to\r\nbloodshed, and so obdurate that they are said to \"drive nails in with\r\ntheir heads\"; lastly the Catalans, noisy and quarrelsome, but brave,\r\nindustrious, and enterprising, on the whole the best element in this\r\nmotley aggregate of unbalanced temperaments. The various aspects of\r\nSpanish temperament are regarded by Havelock Ellis[1274] as\r\nmanifestations of an aboriginally primitive race, which, under the\r\nstress of a peculiarly stimulating and yet hardening environment, has\r\nretained through every stage of development an unusual degree of the\r\nendowment of fresh youth, of elemental savagery, with which it started.\r\nThis explains the fine qualities of Spain and her defects, the splendid\r\ninitiative, and lack of sustained ability to carry it out, the\r\nimportance of the point of honour and the glorification of the primitive\r\nvirtue of valour.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the past and present relations, as elucidated especially by\r\nLivi and Sergi, may be thus briefly stated. After the first Stone Age,\r\nof which there are fewer indications than might be expected[1275], the\r\nwhole land was thickly settled by dark long-headed Mediterranean peoples\r\nin neolithic times. These were later joined by Pelasgians of like type\r\nfrom Greece, and by Illyrians of doubtful affinity from the Balkan\r\nPeninsula. Indeed C. Penka[1276], who has so many paradoxical theories,\r\nmakes the Illyrians the first inhabitants of Italy, as shown by the\r\nstriking resemblance of the _terramara_ culture of Aemilia with that of\r\nthe Venetian and Laibach pile-dwellings. The recent finds in Bosnia\r\nalso[1277], besides the historically proved (?) migration of the Siculi\r\nfrom Upper Italy to Sicily, and their Illyrian origin, all point in the\r\nsame direction. But the facts are differently interpreted by\r\nSergi[1278], who holds that the whole land was occupied by the\r\nMediterraneans, because we find even in Switzerland pile-dwellers of the\r\nsame type[1279].\r\n\r\nThen came the peoples of Aryan speech, Celtic-speaking Alpines from the\r\nnorth-west and Slavs from the north-east, who raised the cephalic index\r\nin the north, where the brachy element, as already seen, still greatly\r\npredominates but diminishes steadily southwards[1280]. They occupied the\r\nwhole of Umbria, which at first stretched across the peninsula from the\r\nAdriatic to the Mediterranean, but was later encroached upon by the\r\nintruding Etruscans on the west side. Then also some of these Umbrians,\r\nmigrating southwards to Latium beyond the Tiber, intermingled, says\r\nSergi, with the Italic (Ligurian) aborigines, and became the founders of\r\nthe Roman state[1281]. With the spread of the Roman arms the Latin\r\nlanguage, which Sergi claims to be a kind of Aryanised Ligurian, but\r\nmust be regarded as a true member of the Aryan family, was diffused\r\nthroughout the whole of the peninsula and islands, sweeping away all\r\ntraces not only of the original Ligurian and other Mediterranean\r\ntongues, but also of Etruscan and its own sister languages, such as\r\nUmbrian, Oscan, and Sabellian.\r\n\r\nAt the fall of the empire the land was overrun by Ostrogoths, Heruli,\r\nand other Teutons, none of whom formed permanent settlements except the\r\nLongobards, who gave their name to the present Lombardy, but were\r\nthemselves rapidly assimilated in speech and general culture to the\r\nsurrounding populations, whom we may now call Italians in the modern\r\nsense of the term.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that the Aegean culture had spread to Italy at an\r\nearly date, that it was continued under Hellenic influences by Etruscans\r\nand Umbrians, that Greek arts and letters were planted on Italian soil\r\n(_Magna Graecia_) before the foundation of Rome, that all these\r\ncivilisations converged in Rome itself and were thence diffused\r\nthroughout the West, that the traditions of previous cultural epochs\r\nnever died out, acquired new life with the Renascence and were thus\r\nperpetuated to the present day, it may be claimed for the gifted Italian\r\npeople that they have been for a longer period than any others under the\r\nunbroken sway of general humanising influences.\r\n\r\nThese \"Latin Peoples,\" as they are called because they all speak\r\nlanguages of the Latin stock, are not confined to the West. To the\r\nItalian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, with the less known and ruder\r\nWalloon of Belgium and Romansch of Switzerland, Tyrol, and Friuli, must\r\nbe associated the _Rumanian_ current amongst some nine millions of\r\nso-called \"Daco-Rumanians\" in Moldavia and Wallachia, _i.e._ the modern\r\nkingdom of Rumania. The same Neo-Latin tongue is also spoken by the\r\n_Tsintsars_ or _Kutzo-Vlacks_[1282] of the Mount Pindus districts in the\r\nBalkan Peninsula, and by numerous Rumanians who have in later times\r\nmigrated into Hungary. They form a compact and vigorous nationality, who\r\nclaim direct descent from the Roman military colonists settled north of\r\nthe Lower Danube by Trajan after his conquest of the Dacians (107 A.D.).\r\nBut great difficulties attach to this theory, which is rejected by many\r\nethnologists, especially on the ground that, after Trajan's time, Dacia\r\nwas repeatedly swept clean by the Huns, the Finns, the Avars, Magyars\r\nand other rude Mongolo-Turki hordes, besides many almost ruder Slavic\r\npeoples during the many centuries when the eastern populations were in a\r\nstate of continual flux after the withdrawal of the Roman legionaries\r\nfrom the Lower Danube. Besides, it is shown by Roesler[1283] and others\r\nthat under Aurelian (257 A.D.) Trajan's colonists withdrew bodily\r\nsouthwards to and beyond the Hemus to the territory of the old Bessi\r\n(Thracians), _i.e._ the district still occupied by the Macedo-Rumanians.\r\nBut in the 13th century, during the break-up of the Byzantine empire,\r\nmost of these fugitives were again driven north to their former seats\r\nbeyond the Danube, where they have ever since held their ground, and\r\nconstituted themselves a distinct and far from feeble branch of the\r\nNeo-Latin community. The Pindus, therefore, rather than the Carpathians,\r\nis to be taken as the last area of dispersion of these valiant and\r\nintelligent descendants of the Daco-Romans. This seems the most rational\r\nsolution of what A. D. Xenopol calls \"an historic enigma,\" although he\r\nhimself rejects Roesler's conclusions in favour of the old view so dear\r\nto the national pride of the present Rumanian people[1284]. The\r\ncomposite character of the Rumanian language--fundamentally Neo-Latin or\r\nrather early Italian, with strong Illyrian (Albanian) and Slav\r\naffinities--would almost imply that Dacia had never been Romanised under\r\nthe empire, and that in fact this region was _for the first time_\r\noccupied by its present Romance speaking inhabitants in the 13th\r\ncentury[1285]. The nomadic life of the Rumanians is in itself, as\r\nPeisker points out[1286], a refutation of their descent from settled\r\nRoman colonists, and indicates a Central Asiatic origin. The mounted\r\nnomads grazed during the summer \"on most of the mountains of the Balkan\r\npeninsula, and took up their winter quarters on the sea-coasts among a\r\npeasant population speaking a different language. Thence they gradually\r\nspread, unnoticed by the chroniclers, along all the mountain ranges,\r\nover all the Carpathians of Transylvania, North Hungary, and South\r\nGalicia, to Moravia; towards the north-west from Montenegro onwards over\r\nHerzegovina, Bosnia, Istria, as far as South Styria; towards the south\r\nover Albania far into Greece.... And like the peasantry among which they\r\nwintered (and winter) long enough, they became (and become) after a\r\ntransitory bilingualism, Greeks, Albanians, Servians, Bulgarians,\r\nRuthenians, Poles, Slovaks, Chekhs, Slovenes, Croatians ... a mobile\r\nnomad stratum among a strange-tongued and more numerous peasant element,\r\nand not till later did they gradually take to agriculture and themselves\r\nbecome settled.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pelasgians and Minoan civilisation have been briefly discussed above\r\n(Ch. XIII.). Later problems in Greek ethnology are still under dispute.\r\nSergi, who regards the proto-Aryans as round-headed barbarians of\r\nCeltic, Slav, and Teutonic speech, makes no exception in favour of the\r\nHellenes. These also enter Greece not as civilisers, but rather as\r\ndestroyers of the flourishing Mykenaean culture developed here, as in\r\nItaly, by the Mediterranean aborigines. But in course of time the\r\nintruders become absorbed in the Pelasgic or eastern branch of the\r\nMediterraneans, and what we call Hellenism is really Pelasgianism\r\nrevived, and to some extent modified by the Aryan (Hellenic) element.\r\n\r\nIf it may be allowed that at their advent the Hellenes were less\r\ncivilised than the native Aegeans on whom they imposed their Aryan\r\nspeech, whence and when came they? By Penka[1287], for whom the Baltic\r\nlands would be the original home not merely of the Germanic branch but\r\nof all the Aryans, the Hellenic cradle is located in the Oder basin\r\nbetween the Elbe and the Vistula. As the Doric, doubtless the last Greek\r\nirruption into Hellas, is chronologically fixed at 1149 B.C., the\r\nbeginning of the Hellenic migrations may be dated back to the 13th\r\ncentury. When the Hellenes migrated from Central Europe to Greece, the\r\nperiod of the general ethnic dispersion was already closed, and the\r\nmigratory period which next followed began with the Hellenes, and was\r\ncontinued by the Itali, Gauls, Germans, etc. The difficulties created\r\nby this view are insurmountable. Thus we should have to suppose that\r\nfrom this relatively contracted Aryan cradle countless tribes swarmed\r\nover Europe since the 13th century B.C., speaking profoundly different\r\nlanguages (Greek, Celtic, Latin, etc.), all differentiated since that\r\ntime on the shores of the Baltic. The proto-Aryans with their already\r\nspecialised tongues had reached the shores of the Mediterranean long\r\nbefore that time and, according to Maspero[1288], were known to the\r\nEgyptians of the 5th dynasty (3990-3804 B.C.) if not earlier. Allowing\r\nthat these may have rather been pre-Hellenes (Pelasgians), we still know\r\nthat the Achaeans had traditionally arrived about 1250 B.C. and they\r\nwere already speaking the language of Homer.\r\n\r\n\"The indications of archaeology and of legend agree marvellously well\r\nwith those of the Egyptian records,\" says H. R. Hall[1289], \"in making\r\nthe Third Late Minoan period one of incessant disturbance.... The whole\r\nbasin of the Eastern Mediterranean seems to have been a seething turmoil\r\nof migrations, expulsions, wars and piracies, started first by the\r\nMycenaean (Achaian) conquest of Crete, and then intensified by the\r\nconstant impulse of the Northern iron-users into Greece.\" Herodotus\r\nspeaks of the great invasion of the Thesprotian tribes from beyond\r\nPindus, which took place probably in the 13th century B.C.[1290] As a\r\nresult \"an overwhelming Aryan and iron-using population was first\r\nbrought into Greece. The earlier Achaian (?) tribes of Aryans in\r\nThessaly, who had perhaps lived there from time immemorial, and had\r\nprobably already infiltrated southwards to form the mixed Ionian\r\npopulation about the Isthmus, were scattered, only a small portion of\r\nthe nation remaining in its original home, while of the rest part\r\nconquered the South and another part emigrated across the sea to the\r\nPhrygian coast. Of this emigration to Asia the first event must have\r\nbeen the war of Troy.... The Boeotian and Achaian invasion of the South\r\nscattered the Minyae, Pelasgians, and Ionians. The remnant of the Minyae\r\nemigrated to Lemnos, the Pelasgi and Ionians were concentrated in Attica\r\nand another body of Ionians in the later Achaia, while the Southern\r\nAchaeans pressed forward into the Peloponnese[1291].\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the national traditions that the proto-Greeks did not\r\narrive _en bloc_, but rather at intervals in separate and often hostile\r\nbands bearing different names. But all these groups--Achaeans, Danai,\r\nArgians, Dolopes, Myrmidons, Leleges and many others, some of which were\r\nalso found in Asia Minor--retained a strong sense of their common\r\norigin. The sentiment, which may be called racial rather than national,\r\nreceived ultimate expression when to all of them was extended the\r\ncollective name of Hellenes (Sellenes originally), that is, descendants\r\nof Deucalion's son Hellen, whose two sons Aeolus and Dorus, and grandson\r\nIon, were supposed to be the progenitors of the Aeolians, Dorians, and\r\nIonians. But such traditions are merely reminiscences of times when the\r\ntribal groupings still prevailed, and it may be taken for granted that\r\nthe three main branches of the Hellenic stock did not spring from a\r\nparticular family that rose to power in comparatively recent times in\r\nthe Thessalian district of Phthiotis. Whatever truth may lie behind the\r\nHellenic legend, it is highly probable that, at the time when Hellen is\r\nsaid to have flourished (about 1500 B.C.), the Aeolic-speaking\r\ncommunities of Thessaly, Arcadia, Boeotia, the closely-allied\r\nDorians[1292] of Phocaea, Argos, and Laconia, and the Ionians of Attica,\r\nhad already been clearly specialised, had in fact formed special groups\r\nbefore entering Greece. Later their dialects, after acquiring a certain\r\npolish and leaving some imperishable records of the many-sided Greek\r\ngenius, were gradually merged in the literary Neo-Ionic or Attic, which\r\nthus became the [Greek: koine dialektos], or current speech of the Greek\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAdmirable alike for its manifold aptitudes and surprising vitality, the\r\nlanguage of Aeschylus, Thucydides, and the other great Athenians\r\noutlived all the vicissitudes of the Byzantine empire, during which it\r\nwas for a time banished from Southern Greece, and even still survives,\r\nalthough in a somewhat degraded form, in the Romaic or Neo-Hellenic\r\ntongue of modern Hellas. Romaic, a name which recalls a time when the\r\nByzantines were known as \"Romans\" throughout the East, differs far less\r\nfrom the classical standard than do any of the Romance tongues from\r\nLatin. Since the restoration of Greek independence great efforts have\r\nbeen made to revive the old language in all its purity, and some modern\r\nwriters now compose in a style differing little from that of the classic\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nYet the Hellenic race itself has almost perished on the mainland. Traces\r\nof the old Greek type have been detected by Lenormant and others,\r\nespecially amongst the women of Patras and Missolonghi. But within\r\nliving memory Attica was still an Albanian land, and Fallmerayer has\r\nconclusively shown that the Peloponnesus and adjacent districts had\r\nbecome thoroughly Slavonised during the 6th and 7th centuries[1293].\r\n\"For many centuries,\" writes the careful Roesler, \"the Greek peninsula\r\nserved as a colonial domain for the Slavs, receiving the overflow of\r\ntheir population from the Sarmatian lowlands[1294].\" Their presence is\r\nbetrayed in numerous geographical terms, such as _Varsova_ in Arcadia,\r\n_Glogova_, _Tsilikhova_, etc. Nevertheless, since the revival of the\r\nHellenic sentiment there has been a steady flow of Greek immigration\r\nfrom the Archipelago and Anatolia; and the Albanian, Slav, Italian,\r\nTurkish, Rumanian, and Norman elements have in modern Greece already\r\nbecome almost completely Hellenised, at least in speech. Of the old\r\ndialects Doric alone appears to have survived in the Tsaconic of the\r\nLaconian hills. The Greek language has, however, disappeared from\r\nSouthern Italy, Sicily, Syria, and the greater part of Egypt and Asia\r\nMinor, where it was long dominant.\r\n\r\nTo understand the appearance of SLAVS in the Peloponnesus we must go\r\nback to the Eurasian steppe, the probable cradle of these multitudinous\r\npopulations. Here they have often been confused with the ancient\r\nSarmatae, who already before the dawn of history were in possession of\r\nthe South Russian plains between the Scythians towards the east and the\r\nproto-Germanic tribes before their migration to the Baltic lands. But\r\neven at that time, before the close of the Neolithic Age, there must\r\nhave been interminglings, if not with the western Teutons, almost\r\ncertainly with the eastern Scythians, which helps to explain the\r\ngenerally vague character of the references made by classical writers\r\nboth to the Sarmatians and the Scythians, who sometimes seem to be\r\nindistinguishable from savage Mongol hordes, and at others are\r\nrepresented as semi-cultured peoples, such as the Aryans of the Bronze\r\nperiod might have been round about the district of Olbia and the other\r\nearly Miletian settlements on the northern shores of the Euxine.\r\n\r\nOwing to these early crossings Andre Lefevre goes so far as to say that\r\n\"there is no Slav race[1295],\" but only nations of divers more or less\r\npure types, more or less crossed, speaking dialects of the same\r\nlanguage, who later received the name of Slavs, borne by a prehistoric\r\ntribe of _Sarmatians_, and meaning \"renowned,\" \"illustrious[1296].\" Both\r\ntheir language and mythologies, continues Lefevre, point to the vast\r\nregion near Irania as the primeval home of the Slav, as of the Celtic\r\nand Germanic populations. The Sauromatae or Sarmatae of Herodotus[1297],\r\nwho had given their name to the mass of Slav or Slavonised peoples,\r\nstill dwelt north of the Caucasus and south of the _Budini_ between the\r\nCaspian, the Don and Sea of Azov; \"after crossing the Tanais (Don) we\r\nare no longer in Scythia; we begin to enter the lands of the Sauromatae,\r\nwho, starting from the angle of the Palus Moeotis (Sea of Azov), occupy\r\na space of 15 days' march, where are neither trees, fruit-trees, nor\r\nsavages. Above the tract fallen to them the Budini occupy another\r\ndistrict, which is overgrown with all kinds of trees[1298].\" Then\r\nHerodotus seems to identify these Sarmatians with the Scythians, whence\r\nall the subsequent doubts and confusion. Both spoke the same language,\r\nof which seven distinct dialects are mentioned, yet a number of\r\npersonal names preserved by the Greeks have a certain Iranic look, so\r\nthat these Scythian tongues seem to have been really Aryan, forming a\r\ntransition between the Asiatic and the European branches of the family.\r\n\r\nThe probable explanation is that the Scythians[1299] were a horde which\r\ncame down from Upper Asia, conquered an Iranian-speaking people, and in\r\ntime adopted the speech of its subjects. E. H. Minns[1300] suggests that\r\nthe settled Scythians represent the remains of the Iranian population,\r\nand the nomads the conquering peoples. These were displaced later by the\r\nSarmatians, and Scythia becomes merely a geographical term. Skulls dug\r\nup in Scythic graves throw no light on racial affinities, some being\r\nlong, and some short, but in customs there is a close analogy with the\r\nMongols, though, as Minns points out, \"the natural conditions of\r\nsteppe-ranging dictated the greater part of them.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Slav and Germanic tribes had probably in remote times penetrated up\r\nthe Danube and the Volga, while some of the former under the name of\r\n_Wends_ (Venedi[1301]), appear to have reached the Carpathians and the\r\nBaltic shores down the Vistula. The movement was continued far into\r\nmedieval times, when great overlappings took place, and when numerous\r\nSlav tribes, some still known as Wends, others as _Sorbs_, _Croats_, or\r\n_Chekhs_, ranged over Central Europe to Pomerania and beyond the Upper\r\nElbe to Suabia. Most of these have long been Teutonised, but a few of\r\nthe _Polabs_[1302] survive as Wends in Prussian and Saxon Lausatz, while\r\nthe Chekhs and _Slovaks_ still hold their ground in Bohemia and Moravia,\r\nas the _Poles_ do in Posen and the Vistula valley, and the _Rusniaks_ or\r\n_Ruthenes_ with the closely allied \"Little Russians,\" in the\r\nCarpathians, Galicia, and Ukrania.\r\n\r\nIt was from the Carpathian[1303] lands that came those _Yugo-Slavs_\r\n(\"Southern Slavs\") who, under the collective name of Sorbs (Serbs,\r\nServians), moved southwards beyond the Danube, and overran a great part\r\nof the Balkan peninsula and nearly the whole of Greece in the 6th and\r\n7th centuries. They were the Khorvats[1304] or Khrobats[1304] from\r\nthe upland valleys of the Oder and Vistula, whom, after his Persian\r\nwars, Heraclius invited to settle in the wasted provinces south of the\r\nDanube, hoping, as Nadir Shah did later with the Kurds in Khorasan, to\r\nmake them a northern bulwark of the empire against the incursions of the\r\nAvars and other Mongolo-Turki hordes. Thus was formed the first\r\npermanent settlement of the Yugo-Slavs in Croatia, Istria, Dalmatia,\r\nBosnia, and the Nerenta valley in 680, under the five brothers Klukas,\r\nLobol, Kosentses, Mukl, and Khrobat, with their sisters Tuga and Buga.\r\nThese were followed by the kindred Srp (Sorb) tribes from the Elbe, who\r\nleft their homes in Misnia and Lusatia, and received as their patrimony\r\nthe whole region between Macedonia and Epirus, Dardania, Upper Moesia,\r\nthe Dacia of Aurelian, and Illyria, _i.e._ Bosnia and Servia. The lower\r\nDanube was at the same time occupied by the _Severenses_, \"Seven\r\nNations,\" also Slavs, who reached to the foot of the Hemus beyond the\r\npresent Varna. Nothing could stem this great Slav inundation, which soon\r\noverflowed into Macedonia (Rumelia), Thessaly, and Peloponnesus, so that\r\nfor a time nearly the whole of the Balkan lands, from the Danube to the\r\nMediterranean, became a Slav domain--parts of Illyria and Epirus\r\n(Albania) with the Greek districts about Constantinople alone excepted.\r\n\r\nHellas, as above seen, has recovered itself, and the _Albanians_[1305],\r\ndirect descendants of the ancient Illyrians, still hold their ground and\r\nkeep alive the last echoes of the old Illyrian language, which was\r\nalmost certainly a proto-Aryan form of speech probably intermediate, as\r\nabove-mentioned, between the Italic and Hellenic branches. They even\r\nretain the old tribal system, so that there are not only two main\r\nsections, the northern _Ghegs_ and the southern _Toshks_, but each\r\nsection is divided into a number of minor groups[1306], such as the\r\nMalliesors (Klementi, Pulati, Hoti, etc.) and Mirdites (Dibri, Fandi,\r\nMatia, etc.) in the north, and the Toxides (whence Toshk) and the\r\nYapides (Lapides) in the south. The southerners are mainly Orthodox\r\nGreeks, and in other respects half-Hellenised Epirotes, the northerners\r\npartly Moslem and partly Roman Catholics of the Latin rite. From this\r\nsection came chiefly those Albanians who, after the death (1467) of\r\ntheir valiant champion, George Castriota (_Scanderbeg_, \"Alexander the\r\nGreat\"), fled from Turkish oppression and formed numerous settlements,\r\nespecially in Calabria and Sicily, and still retain their national\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nIn their original homes, located by some between the Bug and the\r\nDnieper, the Slavs have not only recovered from the fierce Mongolo-Turki\r\nand Finn tornadoes, by which the eastern steppes were repeatedly swept\r\nfor over 1500 years after the building of the Great Wall, but have in\r\nrecent historic times displayed a prodigious power of expansion second\r\nonly to that of the British peoples. The _Russians_ (Great, Little, and\r\nWhite Russians), whose political empire now stretches continuously from\r\nthe Baltic to the Pacific, have already absorbed nearly all the Mongol\r\nelements in East Europe, have founded compact settlements in Caucasia\r\nand West Siberia, and have thrown off numerous pioneer groups of\r\ncolonists along all the highways of trade and migration, and down the\r\ngreat fluvial arteries between the Ob and the Amur estuary. They number\r\ncollectively over 100 millions, with a domain of some nine million\r\nsquare miles. The majority belong to Deniker's Eastern race[1307] (a\r\nvariety of the Alpine type), being blond, sub-brachycephalic and short,\r\n1.64 m. (5 ft. 4-1/2 ins.). The Little Russians in the South on the\r\nBlack Mould belt are more brachycephalic and have darker colouring and\r\ntaller stature. The White Russians in the West between Poland and\r\nLithuania are the fairest of all.\r\n\r\nWe need not be detained by the controversy carried on between Sergi and\r\nZaborowski regarding a prehistoric spread of the Mediterranean race to\r\nRussia[1308]. The skulls from several of the old Kurgans, identified by\r\nSergi with his Mediterranean type, have not been sufficiently determined\r\nas to date or cultural periods to decide the question, while their\r\ndolicho shape is common both to the Mediterraneans and to the\r\nproto-Aryans of the North European type[1309]. To this stock the\r\nproto-Slavs are affiliated by Zaborowski and many others[1310], although\r\nthe present Slavs are all distinctly round-headed. Ripley asks, almost\r\nin despair, what is to be done with the present Slav element, and\r\ndecides to apply \"the term _Homo Alpinus_ to this broad-headed group\r\nwherever it occurs, whether on mountains or plains, in the west or in\r\nthe east[1311].\"\r\n\r\nWe are beset by the same difficulties as we pass with the _Ossets_ of\r\nthe Caucasus into the Iranian and Indian domains of the proto-Aryan\r\npeoples. These Ossets, who are the only aborigines of Aryan speech in\r\nCaucasia, are by Zaborowski[1312] identified with the Alans, who are\r\nalready mentioned in the 1st century A.D. and were Scythians of Iranian\r\nspeech, blonds, mixed with Medes, and perhaps descendants of the\r\nMassagetae. We know from history that the Goths and Alans became closely\r\nunited, and it may be from the Goths that the Osset descendants of the\r\nAlans (some still call themselves Alans) learned to brew beer.\r\nElsewhere[1313] Zaborowski represents the Ossets as of European origin,\r\ntill lately for the most part blonds, though now showing many Scythian\r\ntraits. But they are not physically Iranians \"despite the Iranian and\r\nAsiatic origin of their language,\" as shown by Max Kowalewsky[1314]. On\r\nthe whole, therefore, the Ossets may be taken as originally blond\r\nEuropeans, closely blended with Scythians, and later with the other\r\nmodern Caucasus peoples, who are mostly brown brachys. But Ernest\r\nChantre[1315] allies these groups to their brown and brachy Tatar\r\nneighbours, and denies that the Ossets are the last remnants of Germanic\r\nimmigrants into Caucasia.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore in the Caucasus a very curious and puzzling\r\nphenomenon--several somewhat distinct groups of aborigines, mainly of de\r\nLapouge's Alpine type, but all except the Ossets speaking an amazing\r\nnumber of non-Aryan stock languages. Philologists have been for some\r\ntime hard at work in this linguistic wilderness, the \"Mountain of\r\nLanguages\" of the early Arabo-Persian writers, without greatly reducing\r\nthe number of independent groups, while many idioms traceable to a\r\nsingle stem still differ so profoundly from each other that they are\r\npractically so many stocks. Of the really distinct families the more\r\nimportant are:--the _Kartweli_ of the southern slopes, comprising the\r\nhistorical Georgian, cultivated since the 5th century, the Mingrelian,\r\nImeritian, Laz of Lazistan, and many others; the _Cherkess_\r\n(Circassian), the _Abkhasian_ and _Kabard_ of the Western and Central\r\nCaucasus; the _Chechenz_ and _Lesghian_, the _Andi_, the _Ude_, the\r\n_Kubachi_ and _Duodez_ of Daghestan, _i.e._ the Eastern Caucasus. Where\r\ndid this babel of tongues come from? We know that 2500 years ago the\r\nrelations were much the same as at present, because the Greeks speak of\r\nscores of languages current in the port of Dioscurias in their time. If\r\ntherefore the aborigines are the \"sweepings of the plains,\" they must\r\nhave been swept up long before the historic period. Did they bring their\r\ndifferent languages with them, or were these specialised in their new\r\nupland homes? The consideration that an open environment makes for\r\nuniformity, secluded upland valleys for diversity, seems greatly to\r\nfavour the latter assumption, which is further strengthened by the now\r\nestablished fact that, although there are few traces of the Palaeolithic\r\nepoch, the Caucasus was somewhat thickly inhabited in the New Stone Age.\r\n\r\nCrossing into Irania we are at once confronted with totally different\r\nconditions. For the ethnologist this region comprises, besides the\r\ntableland between the Tigris and Indus, both slopes of the Hindu-Kush,\r\nand the Pamir, with the uplands bounded south and north by the upper\r\ncourses of the Oxus and the Sir-darya. Overlooking later Mongolo-Turki\r\nencroachments, a general survey will, I think, show that from the\r\nearliest times the whole of this region has formed part of the Caucasic\r\ndomain; that the bulk of the indigenous populations must have belonged\r\nto the dark, round-headed Alpine type; that these, still found in\r\ncompact masses in many places, were apparently conquered, but certainly\r\nAryanised in speech, in very remote prehistoric times by long-headed\r\nblond Aryans of the IRANIC and GALCHIC branches, who arrived in large\r\nnumbers from the contiguous Eurasian steppe, mingled generally with the\r\nbrachy aborigines, but also kept aloof in several districts, where they\r\nstill survive with more or less modified proto-Aryan features. Thus we\r\nare at once struck by the remarkable fact that absolute uniformity of\r\nspeech, always apart from late Mongol intrusions, has prevailed during\r\nthe historic period throughout Irania, which has been in this respect as\r\ncompletely Aryanised as Europe itself; and further, that all current\r\nAryan tongues, with perhaps one trifling exception[1316], are members\r\neither of the Iranic or the Galchic branch of the family. Both Iranic\r\nand Galchic are thus rather linguistic than ethnic terms, and so true is\r\nthis that a philologist always knows what is meant by an Iranic\r\nlanguage, while the anthropologist is unable to define or form any clear\r\nconception of an Iranian, who may be either of long-headed Nordic or\r\nround-headed Alpine type. Here confusion may be avoided by reserving the\r\nhistoric name of PERSIAN[1317] for the former, and comprising all the\r\nAlpines under the also time-honoured though less known name of TAJIKS.\r\n\r\nKhanikoff has shown that these Tajiks constitute the primitive element\r\nin ancient Iran. To the true Persians of the west, as well as to the\r\nkindred Afghans in the east, both of dolicho type, the term is rarely\r\napplied. But almost everywhere the sedentary and agricultural aborigines\r\nare called Tajiks, and are spoken of as _Parsivan_, that is,\r\n_Parsizaban_[1318], \"of Persian speech,\" or else _Dihkan_[1318], that\r\nis, \"Peasants,\" all being mainly husbandmen \"of Persian race and\r\ntongue[1319].\" They form endless tribal, or at least social, groups, who\r\nkeep somewhat aloof from their proto-Aryan conquerors, so that, in the\r\neast especially, the ethnic fusion is far from complete, the various\r\nsections of the community being still rather juxtaposed than fused in a\r\nsingle nationality. When to these primeval differences is added the\r\ntribal system still surviving in full vigour amongst the intruding\r\nAfghans themselves, we see how impossible it is yet to speak of an\r\nAfghan nation, but only of heterogeneous masses loosely held together by\r\nthe paramount tribe--at present the _Durani_ of Kabul.\r\n\r\nThe Tajiks are first mentioned by Herodotus, whose _Dadikes_[1320] are\r\nidentified by Hammer and Khanikoff with them[1321]. They are now\r\ncommonly divided into Lowland, and Highland or Hill Tajiks, of whom the\r\nformer were always Parsivan, whereas the Hill Tajiks did not originally\r\nspeak Persian at all, but, as many still do, an independent sister\r\nlanguage called Galchic, current in the Pamir, Zerafshan and Sir-darya\r\nuplands, and holding a somewhat intermediate position between the Iranic\r\nand Indic branches.\r\n\r\nThis term Galcha, although new to science, has long been applied to the\r\nAryans of the Pamir valleys, being identified with the _Calcienses\r\npopuli_ of the lay Jesuit Benedict Goez, who crossed the Pamir in 1603,\r\nand describes them as \"of light hair and beard like the Belgians.\"\r\nMeyendorff also calls those of Zerafshan \"Eastern Persians, Galchi,\r\nGalchas.\" The word has been explained to mean \"the hungry raven who has\r\nwithdrawn to the mountains,\" probably in reference to those Lowland\r\nTajiks who took refuge in the uplands from the predatory Turki hordes.\r\nBut it is no doubt the Persian _galcha_, a peasant or clown, then a\r\nvagabond, etc., whence _galchagi_, rudeness.\r\n\r\nAs shown by J. Biddulph[1322], the tribes of Galchic speech range over\r\nboth slopes of the Hindu-Kush, comprising the natives of Sarakol,\r\nWakhan, Shignan, Munjan (with the Yidoks of the Upper Lud-kho or Chitral\r\nriver), Sanglich, and Ishkashim. To these he is inclined to add the\r\nPakhpus and the Shakshus of the Upper Yarkand-darya, as well as those of\r\nthe Kocha valley, with whom must now be included the Zerafshan Galchas\r\n(Maghians, Kshtuts, Falghars, Machas and Fans), but not the Yagnobis.\r\nAll these form also one ethnic group of Alpine type, with whom on\r\nlinguistic grounds Biddulph also includes two other groups, the Khos of\r\nChitral with the Siah Posh of Kafiristan, and the Shins (Dards), Gors,\r\nChilasi and other small tribes of the Upper Indus and side valleys, all\r\nthese apparently being long-heads of the blond Aryan type. Keeping this\r\ndistinction in view, Biddulph's valuable treatise on the Hindu-Kush\r\npopulations may be followed with safety. He traces the Galcha idioms\r\ngenerally to the old Baktrian (East Persia, so-called \"Zend Avesta\"),\r\nthe Shin however leaning closely to Sanskrit, while Khowar, the speech\r\nof the Chitrali (Khos), is intermediate between Baktrian and Sanskrit.\r\nBut differences prevail on these details, which will give occupation to\r\nphilologists for some time to come.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, all the Galchas of the northern slopes (most of\r\nBiddulph's first group) are physically connected with all the other\r\nLowland and Hill Tajiks, with whom should also probably be included\r\nElphinstone's[1323] southern Tajiks dwelling south of the Hindu-Kush\r\n(Kohistani, Berraki, Purmuli or Fermuli, Sirdehi, Sistani, and others\r\nscattered over Afghanistan and northern Baluchistan). Their type is\r\npronouncedly Alpine, so much so that they have been spoken of by French\r\nanthropologists as \"those belated Savoyards of Kohistan[1324].\" De\r\nUjfalvy, who has studied them carefully, describes them as tall, brown\r\nor bronzed and even white, with ruddy cheeks recalling the Englishman,\r\nblack or chestnut hair, sometimes red and even light, smooth, wavy or\r\ncurly, full beard, brown, ruddy or blond (he met two brothers near\r\nPenjakend with hair \"blanc comme du lin\"); brown, blue, or grey eyes,\r\nnever oblique, long, shapely nose slightly curved, thin, straight lips,\r\noval face, stout, vigorous frame, and round heads with cephalic index as\r\nhigh as 86.50. This description, which is confirmed by Bonvalot and\r\nother recent observers, applies to the Darwazi, Wakhi, Badakhshi, and in\r\nfact all the groups, so that we have beyond all doubt an eastern\r\nextension of the Alpine brachycephalic zone through Armenia and the\r\nBakhtiari uplands to the Central Asiatic highlands, a conclusion\r\nconfirmed by the explorations of M. A. Stein in Chinese Turkestan and\r\nthe Pamirs (1900-8)[1325]. Indeed this Asiatic extension of the Alpine\r\ntype inclines v. Luschan[1326] to regard the European branch as one\r\noffshoot, and the high and narrow (\"Hittite\") nosed type as another, or\r\nrather as a specialised group, of which the Armenians, Persians, Druses,\r\nand other sectarian groups of Syria and Asia Minor represent the purest\r\nexamples. According to his summary of this complicated region \"All\r\nWestern Asia was originally inhabited by a homogeneous melanochroic\r\nrace, with extreme hypsi-brachycephaly and with a 'Hittite' nose. About\r\n4000 B.C. began a Semitic invasion from the south-east, probably from\r\nArabia, by people looking like the modern Bedawy. Two thousand years\r\nlater commenced a second invasion, this time from the north-west, by\r\nxanthrochroous and long-headed tribes like the modern Kurds, half\r\nsavage, and in some way or other, perhaps, connected with the historic\r\nHarri, Amorites, Tamehu and Galatians[1327].\"\r\n\r\nBut the eventful drama is not yet closed. Arrested perhaps for a time by\r\nthe barrier of the Hindu-Kush and Suliman ranges, proto-Aryan conquerors\r\nburst at last, probably through the Kabul river gorges, on to the plains\r\nof India, and thereby added another world to the Caucasic domain. Here\r\nthey were brought face to face with new conditions, which gave rise to\r\nfresh changes and adaptations resulting in the present ethnical\r\nrelations in the peninsula. There is good reason to think that in this\r\nregion the leavening Aryan element never was numerous, while even on\r\ntheir first arrival the Aryan invaders found the land already somewhat\r\nthickly peopled by the aborigines[1328].\r\n\r\nThe marked linguistic and ethnical differences between Eastern and\r\nWestern Hindustan have given rise to the theory of two separate streams\r\nof immigration, perhaps continued over many centuries[1329]. The\r\nearlier entered from the north-west, bringing their herds and families\r\nwith them, whose descendants are the homogeneous and handsome\r\npopulations of the Punjab and Rajputana. Later swarms entered by way of\r\nthe difficult passes of Gilgit and Chitral, a route which made it\r\nimpossible for their women to accompany them. \"Here they came in contact\r\nwith the Dravidians; here by the stress of that contact caste was\r\nevolved; here the Vedas were composed and the whole fantastic structure\r\nof orthodox ritual and usage was built up.... The men of the stronger\r\nrace took to themselves women of the weaker, and from these unions was\r\nevolved the mixed type which we find in Hindustan and Bihar[1330].\"\r\n\r\nAn attempt to analyse the complicated ethnic elements contained in the\r\nvast area of India was made by H. H. Risley[1331], who recognised seven\r\ntypes, his classification being based on theories of origin.\r\n\r\n1. The TURKO-IRANIAN type, including the _Baloch_, _Brahui_, and\r\n_Afghans_ of Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier Provinces, all\r\nMuhammadans, with broad head, long prominent nose, abundant hair, fair\r\ncomplexion and tall stature.\r\n\r\n2. INDO-ARYAN type in the Punjab, Rajputana and Kashmir, with its most\r\nconspicuous members the _Rajputs_, _Khatri_ and _Jats_ in all but colour\r\nclosely resembling the European type and showing little difference\r\nbetween upper and lower social strata. Their characteristics are tall\r\nstature, fair complexion, plentiful hair on face, long head, and narrow\r\nprominent nose.\r\n\r\n3. ARYO-DRAVIDIAN or Hindustani type in the United Provinces, parts of\r\nRajputana, Bihar, and Ceylon, with lower stature, variable complexion,\r\nlongish head, and a nose index exactly corresponding to social station.\r\n\r\n4. SCYTHO-DRAVIDIAN of Western India, including the _Maratha Brahmans_,\r\n_Kunbi_, and _Coorgs_, of medium stature, fair complexion, broad head\r\nwith scanty hair on the face, and a fine nose.\r\n\r\n5. DRAVIDIAN, generally regarded as representing the indigenous element.\r\nThe characteristics are fairly uniform from Ceylon to the Ganges valley\r\nthroughout Madras, Hyderabad, the Central Provinces, Central India and\r\nChota Nagpur, and the name is now used to include the mass of the\r\npopulation unaffected by foreign (Aryan, Scythian, Mongoloid)\r\nimmigration. The _Nairs_ of Malabar and the _Santal_ of Chota Nagpur are\r\ntypical representatives. The stature is short, complexion very dark,\r\nalmost black, hair plentiful with a tendency to curl, head long and nose\r\nvery broad[1332].\r\n\r\n6. MONGOLO-DRAVIDIAN or Bengali type of Bengal and Orissa, showing\r\nfusion with Tibeto-Burman elements. The stature is medium, complexion\r\ndark, and head conspicuously broad, nose variable.\r\n\r\n7. MONGOLOID of the Himalayas, Nepal, Assam, and Burma, represented by\r\nthe _Kanet_ of Lahoul and Kulu, the _Lepcha_ of Darjiling, the _Limbu_,\r\n_Murmi_ and _Gurung_ of Nepal, the _Bodo_ of Assam and the _Burmese_.\r\nThe stature is short, the complexion dark with a yellowish tinge, the\r\nhair on the face scanty. The head is broad with characteristic flat face\r\nand frequently oblique eyes.\r\n\r\nThis classification while more or less generally adopted in outline is\r\nnot allowed to pass unchallenged, especially with regard to the theories\r\nof origin implied. Concerning the brachycephalic element of Western\r\nIndia Risley's belief that it was the result of so-called \"Scythian\"\r\ninvasions is not supported by sufficient evidence. \"The foreign element\r\nis certainly Alpine, not Mongolian, and it may be due to a migration of\r\nwhich the history has not been written[1333].\" Ramaprasad Chanda[1334]\r\ngoes further and traces the broad-headed elements in both\r\n\"Scytho-Dravidians\" (Gujaratis, Marathas and Coorgs) and\r\n\"Mongolo-Dravidians\" (Bengalis and Oriyas) to one common source, \"the\r\n_Homo alpinus_ of the Pamirs and Chinese Turkestan,\" and attempts to\r\nreconstruct the history of the migration of the Alpine invaders from\r\nCentral Asia over Gujarat, Deccan, Bihar and Bengal. His conclusions are\r\nsupported by the reports of Sir Aurel Stein of the _Homo Alpinus_ type\r\ndiscovered in the region of Lob Nor, dating from the first centuries\r\nA.D. This type \"still supplies the prevalent element in the racial\r\nconstitution of the indigenous population of Chinese Turkestan, and is\r\nseen in its purest form in the Iranian-speaking tribes near the\r\nPamirs[1335].\"\r\n\r\nBut any scheme of classification must be merely tentative, subject to\r\nmodification as statistics of the vast area are gradually collected. And\r\nW. Crooke[1336], while acknowledging the value of Risley's scheme[1337]\r\npoints out the need of caution in accepting measurements of skull and\r\nnose forms applied to the mixed races and half-breeds which form the\r\nmajority of the people. \"The race migrations are all prehistoric, and\r\nthe amalgamation of the races has continued for ages among a people to\r\nwhom moral restraints are irksome and unfamiliar. The existing castes\r\nare quite a modern creation, dating only from the later Buddhist age.\"\r\n\"The present population thus represents the flotsam and jetsam collected\r\nfrom many streams of ethnical movement, and any attempt to sort out the\r\nexisting races into a set of pigeon-holes, each representing a defined\r\ntype of race, is, in the present state of our knowledge,\r\nimpossible[1338].\"\r\n\r\nIn features, says Dalton, the Kols[1339] show \"much variety, and I think\r\nin a great many families there is a considerable admixture of Aryan\r\nblood. Many have high noses and oval faces, and young girls are at\r\ntimes met with who have delicate and regular features, finely-chiselled\r\nstraight noses, and perfectly formed mouths and chins. The eyes,\r\nhowever, are seldom so large, so bright, and gazelle-like as those of\r\npure Hindu maidens, and I have met strongly marked Mongolian features.\r\nIn colour they vary greatly, the copper tints being about the most\r\ncommon [though the Mirzapur Kols are very dark]. Eyes dark brown, hair\r\nblack, straight or wavy [as all over India]. Both men and women are\r\nnoticeable for their fine, erect carriage and long, free stride[1340].\"\r\n\r\nThe same variations are found among the Dravidians, where, as should be\r\nexpected, there are many aberrant groups showing divergences in all\r\ndirections, as amongst the _Kurumba_ and _Toda_ of the Nilgiris, the\r\nformer approximating to the Mongol, the latter to the Aryan standard. W.\r\nSikemeier, who lived amongst them for years, notes that \"many of the\r\nKurumbas have decided Mongoloid face and stature, and appear to be the\r\naborigines of that region[1341].\" The same correspondent adds that much\r\nnonsense has been written about the Todas, who have become the trump\r\ncard of popular ethnographists. \"Being ransacked by European visitors\r\nthey invent all kinds of traditions, which they found out their\r\nquestioners liked to get, and for which they were paid.\" Still the type\r\nis remarkable and strikingly European, \"well proportioned and stalwart,\r\nwith straight nose, regular features and perfect teeth,\" the chief\r\ncharacteristic being the development of the hairy system, less however\r\nthan amongst the Ainu, whom they so closely resemble[1342]. From the\r\nillustrations given in Thurston's valuable series one might be tempted\r\nto infer that a group of proto-Aryans had reached this extreme limit of\r\ntheir Asiatic domain, and although W. H. R. Rivers has cleared away the\r\nmystery and established links between the Todas and tribes of Malabar\r\nand Travancore, the problem of their origin is not yet entirely\r\nsolved[1343].\r\n\r\nThe Dravidians occupy the greater part of the Deccan, where they are\r\nconstituted in a few great nations--Telugus (Telingas), Tamils (numbers\r\nof whom have crossed into Ceylon and occupied the northern and central\r\nparts of that island, working in the coffee districts), Kanarese, and\r\nthe Malayalim of the west coast. These with some others were brought at\r\nan early date under Aryan (Hindu) influences, but have preserved their\r\nhighly agglutinating Dravidian speech, which has no known affinities\r\nelsewhere, unless perhaps with the language of the Brahuis, who are\r\nregarded by many as belated Dravidians left behind in East Baluchistan.\r\n\r\nBut for this very old, but highly cultivated Dravidian language, which\r\nis still spoken by about 54 millions between the Ganges and Ceylon, it\r\nwould no longer be possible to distinguish these southern Hindus from\r\nthose of Aryan speech who occupy all the rest of the peninsula together\r\nwith the southern slopes of the Hindu-Kush and parts of the western\r\nHimalayas. Their main divisions are the Kashmiri, many of whom might be\r\ncalled typical Aryans; the Punjabis with several sub-groups, amongst\r\nwhich are the Sikhs, religious sectaries half Moslem half Hindu, also of\r\nmagnificent physique; the Gujaratis, Mahratis, Hindis, Bengalis,\r\nAssamis, and Oraons of Orissa, all speaking Neo-Sanskritic idioms, which\r\ncollectively constitute the Indic branch of the Aryan family. Hindustani\r\nor Urdu, a simplified form of Hindi current especially in the Doab, or\r\n\"Two waters,\" the region between the Ganges and Jumna above Allahabad,\r\nhas become a sort of _lingua franca_, the chief medium of intercourse\r\nthroughout the peninsula, and is understood by certainly over 100\r\nmillions, while all the population of Neo-Sanskritic speech numbered in\r\n1898 considerably over 200 millions.\r\n\r\nClassification derives little help from the consideration of caste,\r\nwhatever view be taken of the origin of this institution. The rather\r\nobvious theory that it was introduced by the handful of Aryan conquerors\r\nto prevent the submergence of the race in the great ocean of black or\r\ndark aborigines, is now rejected by many investigators, who hold that\r\nits origin is occupational, a question rather of social or industrial\r\npursuits becoming hereditary in family groups than of race distinctions\r\nsanctioned by religion. They point out that the commentator's\r\ninterpretation of the _Pancha Ksitaya_, \"Five Classes,\" as _Brahmans_\r\n(priests), _Kshatriyas_ (fighters), _Vaisya_ (traders), _Sudra_\r\n(peasants and craftsmen of all kinds), and _Nishada_ (savages or\r\noutcasts) is recent, and conveys only the current sentiment of the age.\r\nIt never had any substantial base, and even in the comparatively late\r\nInstitutes of Manu \"the rules of food, connubium and intercourse\r\nbetween the various castes are very different from what we find at\r\npresent\"; also that, far from being eternal and changeless, caste has\r\nbeen subject to endless modifications throughout the whole range of\r\nHindu myth and history. Nor is it an institution peculiar to India,\r\nwhile even here the stereotyped four or five divisions neither accord\r\nwith existing facts, nor correspond to so many distinct ethnical groups.\r\n\r\nAll this is perfectly true, and it is also true that for generations the\r\nrecognised castes, say, social pursuits, have been in a state of\r\nconstant flux, incessantly undergoing processes of segmentation, so that\r\ntheir number is at present past counting. Nevertheless, the system may\r\nhave been, and probably was, first inspired by racial motives, an\r\ninstinctive sense of self-preservation, which expressed itself in an\r\ninformal way by local class distinctions which were afterwards\r\nsanctioned by religion, but eventually broke down or degenerated into\r\nthe present relations under the outward pressure of imperious social\r\nnecessities[1344].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeyond the mainland and Ceylon no Caucasic peoples of Aryan speech are\r\nknown to have ranged in neolithic or prehistoric times. But we have\r\nalready followed the migrations of a kindred[1345], though mixed race,\r\nhere called INDONESIANS, into Malaysia, the Philippines, Formosa, and\r\nthe Japanese Archipelago, which they must have occupied in the New Stone\r\nAge. Here there occurs a great break, for they are not again met till we\r\nreach Micronesia and the still more remote insular groups beyond\r\nMelanesia. In Micronesia the relations are extremely confused, because,\r\nas it seems, this group had already been occupied by the Papuans from\r\nNew Guinea before the arrival of the Indonesians, while after their\r\narrival they were followed at intervals by Malays perhaps from the\r\nPhilippines and Formosa, and still later by Japanese, if not also by\r\nChinese from the mainland. Hence the types are here as varied as the\r\ncolour, which appears, going eastwards, to shade off from the dark brown\r\nof the Pelew and Caroline Islanders to the light brown of the Marshall\r\nand Gilbert groups, where we already touch upon the skirts of the true\r\nIndonesian domain[1346].\r\n\r\nA line drawn athwart the Pacific from New Zealand through Fiji to Hawaii\r\nwill roughly cut off this domain from the rest of the Oceanic world,\r\nwhere all to the west is Melanesian, Papuan or mixed, while all to the\r\nright--_Maori_, some of the eastern _Fijians_, _Tongans_, _Samoans_,\r\n_Tahitians_, _Marquesans_, _Hawaiians_ and _Easter Islanders_--is\r\ngrouped under the name POLYNESIAN, a type produced by a mixture of\r\nProto-Malayan and Indonesian. Dolichocephaly and mesaticephaly prevail\r\nthroughout the region, but there are brachycephalic centres in Tonga,\r\nthe Marquesas and Hawaiian Islands. The hair is mostly black and\r\nstraight, but also wavy, though never frizzly or even kinky. The colour\r\nalso is of a light brown compared to cinnamon or cafe-au-lait, and\r\nsometimes approaching an almost white shade, while the tall stature\r\naverages 1.72 m. (5 ft. 7-3/4 ins.).\r\n\r\nMigrating at an unknown date eastwards from the East Indian\r\narchipelago[1347], the first permanent settlements appear to have been\r\nformed in Samoa, and more particularly in the island of _Savaii_,\r\noriginally _Savaiki_, which name under divers forms and still more\r\ndivers meanings accompanied all their subsequent migrations over the\r\nPacific waters. Thus we have in Tahiti _Havaii_[1348], the \"universe,\"\r\nand the old capital of Raiatea; in Rarotonga _Avaiki_, \"the land under\r\nthe wind\"; in New Zealand _Hawaiki_, \"the land whence came the Maori\";\r\nin the Marquesas _Havaiki_, \"the lower regions of the dead,\" as in _to\r\nfenua Havaiki_, \"return to the land of thy forefathers,\" the words with\r\nwhich the victims in human sacrifices were speeded to the other world;\r\nlastly in _Hawaii_, the name of the chief island of the Sandwich group.\r\n\r\nThe Polynesians are cheerful, dignified, polite, imaginative and\r\nintelligent, varying in temperament between the wild and energetic and\r\npolitically capable Maori to his indolent and politically sterile\r\nkinsmen to the north, who have been unnerved by the unvarying\r\nuniformity of temperature. Wherever possible, they are agriculturalists,\r\ngrowing yams, sweet potatoes and taro. Coconuts, bread-fruit and bananas\r\nform the staple food in many islands. Scantily endowed with fertile soil\r\nand edible plants the Polynesians have gained command over the sea which\r\neverywhere surrounds them, and have developed into the best seamen among\r\nprimitive races. Large sailing double canoes were formerly in use, and\r\nsingle canoes with an outrigger are still made. Native costume for men\r\nis made of bark cloth, and for women ample petticoats of split and\r\nplaited leaves. Ornaments, with the exception of flowers, are sparingly\r\nworn. The bow and arrow are unknown, short spears, clubs and slings are\r\nused, but no shields. The arts of writing, pottery making, loom-weaving\r\nand the use of metals were, with few exceptions, unknown, but\r\nmat-making, basketry and the making of _tapa_ were carried to a high\r\npitch, and Polynesian bark-cloth is the finest in the world.\r\n\r\nThroughout Polynesia the community is divided into nobles or chiefs,\r\nfreemen and slaves, which divisions are, by reason of _tabu_, as sharp\r\nas those of caste. They fall into those which participate in the divine,\r\nand those which are wholly excluded from it. Women have a high position,\r\nand men do their fair share of work. Polygyny is universal, being\r\nlimited only by the wealth of the husband, or the numerical\r\npreponderance of the men. Priests have considerable influence, there are\r\nnumerous gods, sometimes worshipped in the outward form of idols, and\r\nancestors are deified.\r\n\r\nPolynesian culture has been analysed by W. H. R. Rivers[1349], and the\r\nfollowing briefly summarises his results. At first sight the culture\r\nappears very simple, especially as regards language and social\r\nstructure, while there is a considerable degree of uniformity in\r\nreligious belief. Everywhere we find the same kind of higher being or\r\ngod and the resemblance extends even to the name, usually some form of\r\nthe word _atua_. In material culture also there are striking\r\nsimilarities, though here the variations are more definite and obvious,\r\nand the apparent uniformity is probably due to the attention given to\r\nthe customs of chiefs, overlooking the culture of the ordinary people\r\nwhere more diversity is discoverable.\r\n\r\nThere is much that points to the twofold nature of Polynesian culture.\r\nThe evidence from the study of the ritual indicates the presence of two\r\npeoples, an earlier who interred their dead in a sitting posture like\r\nthe dual people of Melanesia[1350], and a later, who became chiefs and\r\nbelieved in the need for the preservation of the dead among the living.\r\nAll the evidence available, physical and cultural, points to the\r\nconjecture that the early stratum of the population of Polynesia was\r\nformed by an immigrant people who also found their way to Melanesia.\r\n\r\nThe later stream of settlers can be identified with the\r\nkava-people[1350]. Kava was drunk especially by the chiefs, and the\r\naccompanying ceremonial shows its connection with the higher ranks of\r\nthe people. The close association of the _Areoi_ (secret society) of\r\neastern Polynesia with the chiefs is further proof. Thus both in\r\nMelanesia and in Polynesia the chiefs who preserved their dead are\r\nidentified with the founders of secret societies--organisations which\r\ncame into being through the desire of an immigrant people to practise\r\ntheir religious rites in secret. Burial in the extended position occurs\r\nin Tikopia, Tonga and Samoa--perhaps it may have been the custom of some\r\nspecial group of the kava-people. Chiefs were placed in vaults\r\nconstructed of large stones--a feature unknown elsewhere in Oceania. It\r\nis safe also to ascribe the human design which has undergone\r\nconventionalisation in Polynesia to the kava-people. The geometric art\r\nthrough which the conventionalisation was produced belonged to the\r\nearlier inhabitants who interred their dead in the sitting position.\r\n\r\nMoney, if it exists at all, occupies a very unimportant place in the\r\nculture of the people. There is no evidence of the use of any object in\r\nPolynesia with the definite scale of values which is possessed by\r\nseveral kinds of money in Melanesia. The Polynesians are largely\r\ncommunistic, probably more so than the Melanesians, and afford one of\r\nthe best examples of communism in property with which we are acquainted.\r\nThis feature may be ascribed to the earlier settlers. The suggestion\r\nthat the kava-people never formed independent communities in Polynesia,\r\nbut were accepted at once as chiefs of those among whom they settled\r\nwould account for the absence of money (for which there was no need),\r\nand the failure to disturb in any great measure the communism of the\r\nearlier inhabitants. Communism in property was associated with sexual\r\ncommunism. There is evidence that Polynesian chiefs rarely had more than\r\none wife, while the licentiousness which probably stood in a definite\r\nrelation to the communism of the people is said to have been more\r\npronounced among the lower strata of the community. Both communism and\r\nlicentiousness appear to have been much less marked in the Samoan and\r\nTongan islands, and here there is no evidence of interment in the\r\nsitting position. These and other facts support the view that the\r\ninfluence of the kava-people was greater here than in the more eastern\r\nislands: probably it was greatest in Tikopia, which in many respects\r\ndiffers from other parts of Polynesia.\r\n\r\nMagic is altogether absent from the culture of Tikopia and it probably\r\ntook a relatively unimportant place throughout Polynesia. In Tikopia the\r\nghosts of dead ancestors and relatives as well as animals are _atua_ and\r\nthis connotation of the word appears to be general in other parts of\r\nPolynesia. These may be regarded as the representatives of the ghosts\r\nand spirits of Melanesia. The _vui_ of Melanesia may be represented by\r\nthe _tii_ of Tahiti, beings not greatly respected, who had to some\r\nextent a local character. This comparison suggests that the ancestral\r\nghosts belong to the culture of the kava-people, and that the local\r\nspirits are derived from the culture of the people who interred their\r\ndead in the sitting position, from which people the dual people of\r\nMelanesia derived their beliefs and practices.\r\n\r\nTo sum up. Polynesian culture is made up of at least two elements, an\r\nearlier, associated with the practice of interring the dead in a sitting\r\nposition, communism, geometric art, local spirits and magical rites, and\r\na later, which practised preservation of the dead. These latter may be\r\nidentified with the kava-people while the earlier Polynesian stratum is\r\nthat which entered into the composition of the dual-people of Melanesia\r\nat a still earlier date, and introduced the Austronesian language into\r\nOceania[1351].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1194] Cf.

(p. 5)\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the first few pages of this book were in print an important memoir\r\non the \"Phylogeny of Recent and Extinct Anthropoids with Special\r\nReference to the Origin of Man\" has been published by W. K. Gregory\r\n(_Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist._ Vol. XXXV., Article XIX, pp. 258 ff., New\r\nYork, 1916). As Gregory's lucid statement of the problems involved is\r\nbased on a prolonged examination of very varied and abundant material we\r\nhave considered it advisable to present his summary. The chief\r\nconclusions, which appear to be of a conservative character, are as\r\nfollows (p. 341).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of Man._\r\n\r\n1. Comparative anatomical (including embryological) evidence alone has\r\nshown that man and the anthropoids have been derived from a primitive\r\nanthropoid stock and that man's existing relatives are the chimpanzee\r\nand the gorilla.\r\n\r\n2. The chimpanzee and gorilla have retained, with only minor changes,\r\nthe ancestral habits and habitus in brain, dentition, skull and limbs,\r\nwhile the forerunners of the Hominidae, through a profound change in\r\nfunction, lost the primitive anthropoid habitus, gave up arboreal\r\nfrugivorous adaptations and early became terrestrial, bipedal and\r\npredatory, using crude flints to cut up and smash the varied food.\r\n\r\n3. The ancestral chimpanzee-gorilla-man stock appears to be represented\r\nby the Upper Miocene genera _Sivapithecus_ and _Dryopithecus_, the\r\nformer more closely allied to, or directly ancestral to, the Hominidae,\r\nthe latter to the chimpanzee and gorilla.\r\n\r\n4. Many of the differences that separate man from anthropoids of the\r\n_Sivapithecus_ type are retrogressive changes, following the profound\r\nchange in food habits above noted. Here belong the retraction of the\r\nface and dental arch, the reduction in size of the canines, the\r\nreduction of the jaw muscles, the loss of the prehensile character of\r\nthe hallux. Many other differences are secondary adjustments in relative\r\nproportions, connected with the change from semi-arboreal, semi-erect\r\nand semi-quadrupedal progression to fully terrestrial bipedal\r\nprogression. The earliest anthropoids being of small size doubtless had\r\nslender limbs; later semi-terrestrial semi-erect forms were probably not\r\nunlike a very young gorilla, with fairly short legs and not excessively\r\nelongate arms. The long legs and short arms of man are due, I believe,\r\nto a secondary readjustment of proportions. The very short legs and very\r\nlong arms of old male gorillas may well be a specialization.\r\n\r\n5. At present I know no good evidence for believing that the separation\r\nof the Hominidae from the Simiidae took place any earlier than the\r\nMiocene, and probably the Upper Miocene. The change in structure during\r\nthis vast interval (two or more million years) is much greater in the\r\nHominidae than in the conservative anthropoids, but it is not unlikely\r\nthat during a profound change of life habits evolution sometimes\r\nproceeds more rapidly than in the more familiar cases where\r\nuninterrupted adaptations proceed in a single direction.\r\n\r\n6. _Homo heidelbergensis_ appears to be directly ancestral to all the\r\nlater Hominidae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the evolution of human food habits._\r\n\r\nWhile all the great apes are prevailingly frugivorous, and even their\r\nforerunners in the Lower Oligocene have the teeth well adapted for\r\npiercing the tough rinds of fruits and for chewing vegetable food, yet\r\nthey also appear to have at least a latent capacity for a mixed diet.\r\nThe digestive tract, especially of the chimpanzee and gorilla, is\r\nessentially similar to that of man and at least some captive chimpanzees\r\nthrive upon a mixed diet including large quantities of fruits,\r\nvegetables and bread and small quantities of meat[1352]. Mr R. L.\r\nGarner, who has spent many years in studying the African anthropoids in\r\ntheir wild state, states[1353] that \"their foods are mainly vegetable,\r\nbut that flesh is an essential part of their diet.\" Other observers\r\nstate[1354] that the gorilla and chimpanzee greedily devour young birds\r\nas well as eggs, vermin and small rodents.\r\n\r\nEven the existing anthropoids, although highly conservative both in\r\nbrain development and general habits, show the beginning of the use of\r\nthe hands, and trained anthropoids can perform quite elaborate acts. At\r\na time when tough-rined tubers and fruits were still the main element of\r\nthe diet the nascent Hominidae may have sought out the lairs and nesting\r\nplaces of many animals for the purpose of stealing the young and thus\r\nthey may have learned to fight with and kill the enraged parents. They\r\nhad also learned to fight in protecting their own nesting places and\r\nyoung. And possibly they killed both by biting, as in carnivores, and by\r\nstrangling, or, in the case of a small animal, by dashing it violently\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nWe may conceive that the Upper Tertiary ape-men, in the course of their\r\ndispersal from a south central Asiatic centre[1355], entered regions\r\nwhere flint-bearing formations were abundant. In some way they learned\r\nperhaps that these \"Eolith\" flints could be used to smash open the head\r\nof a small strangled animal, to crack open tough vegetables, or to mash\r\nsubstances into an edible condition. Much later, after the mental\r\nassociation of hand and flint had been well established, they may have\r\nstruck at intruders with the flints with which they were preparing their\r\nfood and in this way they may have learned to use the heavier flints as\r\nhand axes and daggers. At a very early date they learned to throw down\r\nheavy stones upon an object to smash it, and this led finally to the\r\nhurling of flints at men and small game. Very early also they had\r\nlearned to swing a heavy piece of wood or a heavy bone as a weapon. For\r\nall such purposes shorter and stockier arms are more advantageous than\r\nthe long slender arms of a semi-quadrupedal ancestral stage and I have\r\nargued above (p. 333) that a secondary shortening and thickening of the\r\narms ensued.\r\n\r\nOne of the first medium-sized animals that the nascent Hominidae would be\r\nsuccessful in killing was the wild boar, which in the Pleistocene had a\r\nwide Palaearctic distribution.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first the ape-men were more or less social in habits and\r\nlearned to hunt in packs. Whether the art of hunting began in south\r\ncentral Asia or in Europe, perhaps one of the first large animals that\r\nmen learned to kill after they had invaded the open country was the\r\nhorse, because, when a pack of men had surrounded a horse, a single good\r\nstroke with a coup-de-poing upon the brain-case might be sufficient to\r\nkill it.\r\n\r\nI have argued above (p. 321) that the retraction of the dental arch and\r\nthe reduction of the canines is not consistent with the use of meat as\r\nfood, because men learned to use rough flints, in place of their teeth,\r\nto tear the flesh and to puncture the bones, and because the erect\r\nincisors, short canines and bicuspids were highly effective in securing\r\na powerful hold upon the tough hide and connective tissue. It must be\r\nremembered that with a given muscular power small teeth are more easily\r\nforced into meat than large teeth.\r\n\r\nAfter every feast there would be a residuum of hide and bones which\r\nwould gradually assume economic value. The hides of animals were at\r\nfirst rudely stripped off simply to get at the meat. Small sharp-edged\r\nnatural flints could be used for this purpose as well as to cut the\r\nsinews and flesh. After a time it was found that the furry sides of\r\nthese hides were useful to cover the body at night or during a storm.\r\nThus the initial stage in the making of clothes may have been a\r\nbyproduct of the hunting habit.\r\n\r\nDr Matthew (_loc. cit._ pp. 211, 212) has well suggested that man may\r\nhave learned to cover the body with the skins of animals in a cool\r\ntemperate climate (such as that on the northern slopes of the Himalayas)\r\nand that afterward they were able to invade colder regions. The use of\r\nrough skins to cover the body must have caused exposure to new sources\r\nof annoyance and infection, but we cannot affirm that natural selection\r\nwas the cause of the reduction of hair on the body and of the many\r\ncorrelated modifications of glandular activity. We can only affirm that\r\na naked race of mammals must surely have had hairy ancestors and that\r\nthe loss of hair on the body was probably subsequent to the adoption of\r\npredatory habits.\r\n\r\nThe food habits of the early Hominidae, and thus indirectly the jaws and\r\nteeth, were later modified through the use of fire for softening the\r\nfood. Men had early learned to huddle round the dying embers of forest\r\nfires that had been started by lightning, to feed the fire-monster with\r\nbranches, and to carry about firebrands. They learned eventually that\r\nfrozen meat could be softened by exposing it to the fire. Thus the\r\nbroiling and roasting of meat and vegetables might be learned even\r\nbefore the ways of kindling fire through percussion and friction had\r\nbeen discovered. But the full art of cooking and the subsequent stages\r\nin the reduction of the jaws and teeth in the higher races probably had\r\nto await the development of vessels for holding hot water, perhaps in\r\nneolithic times.\r\n\r\nThis account of the evolution of the food habits of the Hominidae will\r\nprobably be condemned by experimentalists, who have adduced strong\r\nevidence for the doctrine that \"acquired characters\" cannot be\r\ninherited. But, whatever the explanation may be, it is a fact that\r\nprogressive changes in food-habits and correlated changes in structure\r\nhave occurred in thousands of phyla, the history of which is more or\r\nless fully known. Nobody with a practical knowledge of the mechanical\r\ninteractions of the upper and lower teeth of mammals, or of the\r\nprogressive changes in the evolution of shearing and grinding teeth, can\r\ndoubt that the dentition has evolved _pari passu_ with changes in food\r\nhabits. Whether, as commonly supposed, the food habits changed before\r\nthe dentition, or _vice versa_, the evidence appears to show that the\r\nHominidae passed through the following stages of evolution:\r\n\r\n1. A chiefly frugivorous stage, with large canines and parallel rows of\r\ncheek teeth (cf. _Sivapithecus_).\r\n\r\n2. A predatory, omnivorous stage, with reduced canines and convergent\r\ntooth rows (cf. _Homo heidelbergensis_).\r\n\r\n3. A stage in which the food is softened by cooking and the dentition is\r\nmore or less reduced in size and retrograde in character, as in\r\nmodernized types of _H. sapiens_.\r\n\r\nThe following is an abbreviation of Gregory's arrangement of the\r\nPrimates (pp. 266, 267).\r\n\r\n  Order Primates\r\n    Suborder Lemuroidea\r\n    Suborder Anthropoidea\r\n      Series Platyrrhinae [New World monkeys]\r\n        Fam.

Most authorities place the chimpanzee and the gorilla in\r\n    the genus Anthropopithecus.\r\n\r\n    _Hylobatinae_, the sub-family containing the gibbons.\r\n\r\n    _Palaeopithecus_, _Dryopithecus_, _Palaeosimia_, and _Sivapithecus_\r\n    are extinct simians.\r\n\r\n    _Pan vetus_ is the name suggested by Miller[1356] for the supposed\r\n    chimpanzee whose jaw was found associated with the Piltdown cranium.\r\n    He says \"The Piltdown remains include parts of a brain-case showing\r\n    fundamental characters not hitherto known except in members of the\r\n    genus _Homo_, and a mandible, two molars, and an upper canine\r\n    showing equally diagnostic features hitherto unknown, except in\r\n    members of the genus _Pan_ [_Anthropopithecus_]. On the evidence\r\n    furnished by these characters the fossils must be supposed to\r\n    represent either a single individual belonging to an otherwise\r\n    unknown extinct genus (_Eoanthropus_) or to two individuals\r\n    belonging to two now-existing families (_Hominidae_ and _Pongidae_).\"\r\n    He argues that the jaw was actually that of a chimpanzee and that\r\n    the cranium was that of a true man, whom he terms _Homo Dawsoni_.\r\n    Gregory accepts this hypothesis. W. P. Pycraft[1357] has submitted\r\n    Miller's data and conclusions to searching criticism and bases his\r\n    deductions on far more ample material than that at the disposal of\r\n    Miller. He says \"That the Piltdown jaw does present many points of\r\n    striking resemblance to that of the chimpanzee is beyond dispute. Dr\r\n    Smith Woodward pointed out these resemblances long ago, in his\r\n    original description of the jaw. But Mr Miller contends that because\r\n    of these resemblances therefore it _is_ the jaw of a chimpanzee\"\r\n    (_loc. cit._ p. 408). Pycraft points out that there is more\r\n    variability in the jaws of chimpanzees than Miller was aware of, and\r\n    that most of the features of the Piltdown jaw are well within the\r\n    limits of human variation; in discussing the conformation of the\r\n    inner surface of the body of the jaw he says \"Between the two\r\n    extremes seen in the jaws of chimpanzees every gradation will be\r\n    found, but in no case would there be any possibility of confusing\r\n    the Piltdown fragment, or any similar fragment of a modern human\r\n    jaw, with similar fragments of chimpanzee jaws\" (p. 407).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1352] A.
