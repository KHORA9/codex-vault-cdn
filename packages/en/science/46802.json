S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople having only casual interest in insects usually express amazement\r\nwhen they learn how much is known about this most numerous group of\r\nanimals. However, while entomologists have good reason to take pride in\r\nthe accomplishments of their contemporaries and predecessors, they are\r\nmore likely to be appalled by how much remains to be learned. We are\r\nindeed ignorant of even the identity of fully half and probably much\r\nmore than half the total number of insect species. Of those that have\r\nbeen described, we have reasonably complete information about the\r\nbehavior and basic environmental relationships for only a comparative\r\nfew. The great majority of the remainder are known only from specimens\r\nfound in museum collections. Such information as we have about these\r\nspecies usually amounts to no more than date and locality of collection.\r\n\r\nThis is true of the cockroaches, which now include approximately 3,500\r\ndescribed species. Conservative estimates based on partially studied\r\nmuseum collections and the percent of new species found in recent\r\nacquisitions, particularly from tropical and subtropical countries,\r\nindicate that at least 4,000 species remain unnamed. Although the group\r\nis well known in general terms to nearly all entomologists, there is an\r\nalmost complete void of information about all except the few domestic\r\nspecies and, to a progressively diminishing degree, some 400 others.\r\nMany details about the lives of even those that share man's habitations\r\nare not fully understood. This then is a rough measure of how little is\r\nknown about cockroaches.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of mosquitoes and a few other comparatively small\r\ngroups of insects on which work has been concentrated, it is doubtful if\r\nany other comparable segment of the world's insect fauna is better\r\nknown. Already an estimated 800,000 kinds of insects have been\r\ndescribed, and since this figure is generally regarded as less than half\r\nthe actual total, think what this means in terms of knowledge yet to be\r\nassembled. No wonder entomology is a growing science with a promising\r\nfuture, but the magnitude of the task also presents a serious obstacle\r\nto progress. Progress can continue only if the scattered literature\r\nresulting from the diversified labors of hundreds of contributors is\r\nbrought together and summarized in thorough and well-organized\r\ncompilations that can serve as a solid basis for future research.\r\n\r\nThe present work is such a compilation, for it assembles what has been\r\ngleaned from approximately 1,700 sources, including correspondence with\r\na large number of other workers. Original observations during some eight\r\nyears of concentrated effort in U. S. Army Quartermaster research\r\nlaboratories are a valuable supplement to what others have done, and\r\nwith this background of experience the authors are especially well\r\nqualified to appraise previous work. Seldom has a compilation been done\r\nso thoroughly or a single large group of insects been the subject of\r\nsuch uninterrupted effort.\r\n\r\nThe contents gives the categories of subject matter treated and the\r\nintroduction discusses the value of this assembled information and\r\noffers suggestions for future study. No longer are cockroaches regarded\r\nonly as disagreeable pests; many species appear to be important,\r\nactually or potentially, as carriers of disease. Recognition of this\r\nimportance has grown considerably, even in the period since World War\r\nII. Consequently, anything that increases our knowledge of the basic\r\nbionomics of cockroaches will be consulted widely for factual\r\ninformation and for clues to new approaches.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this extensive compilation, the limitations of present\r\ninformation about cockroach bionomics must be kept in mind. The cited\r\nobservations of many writers were fragmentary, or their conclusions\r\ndisagreed. But it is fundamental to scientific inquiry that we should\r\nknow and attempt to evaluate the results of previous study, and that is\r\nwhat Drs. Roth and Willis have done. Fortunately, their review is\r\nreadily available. Sometimes, a piece of work fails to be of maximum\r\nvalue because the results are not generally accessible to later\r\nstudents. For this reason I am especially glad that the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, by disseminating the results of the authors' labors, has\r\nthis opportunity to exercise one of its traditional functions--that of\r\ndiffusing knowledge.\r\n\r\nThroughout the period of research by Drs. Roth and Willis at Natick, I\r\nwas in frequent correspondence with them, and I admire their many\r\naccomplishments. Our warmest commendations should go not only to them\r\npersonally but also to those in administration who encouraged their\r\nfundamental research and who aided in the financial support of this\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n                                       ASHLEY B.

INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently we brought together much of the literature linking cockroaches\r\nwith the transmission of certain organisms that cause disease in man and\r\nother vertebrates. In that paper (1957a) we concluded that cockroaches,\r\nbeing potential vectors of pathogenic agents, should not be regarded\r\nsimply as minor annoyances. Obviously the associations of cockroaches\r\nwith agents of vertebrate diseases are of more immediate importance than\r\ntheir relations with pathogens of lower animals or with nonpathogens. On\r\nthe other hand, cockroaches are of general economic as well as medical\r\nimportance, and their control is sought by many who are unaware of their\r\nmedical significance. That the control of domiciliary cockroaches is far\r\nfrom satisfactory may be inferred from current entomological and\r\npest-control journals in which new insecticides are continually\r\nadvocated to replace others found to be inadequate. Possibly new\r\napproaches to the control of cockroaches are needed. Whether these lie\r\nin the direction of increased use of parasites and predators for the\r\nbiological control of these insects remains to be seen. In any event,\r\nthe more we know about any insect, especially its ecology, the greater\r\nthe likelihood of achieving satisfactory control. In order to advance\r\nknowledge in any field of science, new research should proceed from the\r\nresults of prior investigations when these exist. We hope that the\r\nobservations and experiments cited herein may suggest areas for future\r\nresearch and exploitation.\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge no previous publication has brought\r\ntogether the vast literature on the parasites, predators, commensals,\r\nand other symbiotic associates of the Blattaria. For this reason, we\r\nhave tried to assemble observations on all such known associations.\r\nUndoubtedly we have overlooked some records, as, for example, those\r\nburied in papers dealing with other phases of cockroach biology. We hope\r\nthat such inadvertent omissions will not seriously impair the usefulness\r\nof this compilation. Whatever its defects, this review should be a\r\nunified source of information for all who are interested in the biotic\r\nassociates of cockroaches.\r\n\r\nIn addition to previously published information, this monograph also\r\ncontains original records and observations on the associations of\r\ncockroaches that are reported here for the first time. Although some of\r\nthe observations were made by us, others were made by colleagues who\r\nhave graciously made their knowledge available to us in private\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL\r\n\r\nChopard (1938) in his book _La Biologie des Orthoptères_ reviewed much\r\nof the literature on cockroaches, but of the many biotic associations\r\nthat exist he discussed only the commensal cockroaches, gregariousness,\r\nand familial associations. Asano (1937), who reviewed the natural\r\nenemies of cockroaches, mentioned about 10 groups of animals that attack\r\ncockroaches. Thompson (1951) in his _Parasite Host Catalogue_, which was\r\nbased mainly on papers abstracted or noted in the Review of Applied\r\nEntomology, listed only 19 insect parasites of cockroaches. Eighteen of\r\nthese were Hymenoptera which attack only cockroach eggs; the single\r\ndipteron listed (_Sarcophaga lambens_ Wiedemann, supposedly parasitic on\r\n_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_) is not a parasite in this case, but deposits\r\nits eggs on the dead insects (see p. 229). Cameron (1955) listed as\r\nparasites and predators of the cockroach 24 species of hymenopterous egg\r\nparasites, 7 species of _Ampulex_ which hunt nymphs and adults, 17\r\nProtozoa, 13 nematodes, 5 bacteria, 2 mites, and a few other\r\nmiscellaneous predators. In his classified list of the protozoan\r\nparasites of the Orthoptera of the world, Semans (1943) listed about 26\r\nspecies from cockroaches. Linstow (1878, 1889) recorded 14 species of\r\nhelminths from cockroaches. Van Zwaluwenburg (1928) listed 33 names of\r\nroundworms which are commensals or secondary parasites of cockroaches,\r\nbut some of these names are synonyms. La Rivers (1949) extended this\r\nlist with 13 additional species. Chitwood (1932) recognized 24 species\r\nof nematodes which are primary parasites (probably commensals) of\r\nblattids. Steinhaus (1946) gave many instances of biological\r\nrelationships between cockroaches and bacteria, fungi, and yeasts, but\r\nthe cockroaches were not discussed as an entity and the information is\r\nscattered throughout the book.\r\n\r\nIn surveying the literature on this subject we have collected a far more\r\nextensive list of animals and plants associated with cockroaches than\r\none might have expected from an examination of any one of the previous\r\npapers on this subject. In our review of the medically important\r\norganisms associated with the Blattaria, we pointed out that in addition\r\nto many experimental associations cockroaches have been found to harbor,\r\nnaturally, 4 strains of poliomyelitis virus, about 40 species of\r\npathogenic bacteria, the eggs of 7 species of pathogenic helminths, and\r\nto serve as intermediate hosts of 12 other species of helminths\r\npathogenic for vertebrates; cockroaches have also been found to carry,\r\non occasion, 3 species of Protozoa that are pathogenic to man and 2\r\nspecies of fungi which are sometimes found associated with pathological\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above organisms of medical importance, we have\r\ncompiled records of other organisms, nonpathogenic to vertebrates, which\r\nare naturally associated in some way with cockroaches. None of the\r\nfollowing numbers can be considered absolute because some names may be\r\nsynonyms. However, we believe that these figures are very close to the\r\nactual numbers of species that have been isolated because we have\r\nattempted to refer all obvious synonyms to the currently accepted name\r\nfor each organism. On this basis there are about 45 species of bacteria,\r\n40 fungi, 6 yeasts, 90 Protozoa, and 45 helminths that have been found\r\nassociated naturally with cockroaches. Of the arthropods there are about\r\n2 species of scorpions, 4 spiders, 15 mites, 4 centipedes, and 90\r\ninsects. Of vertebrates there are 4 species of fish, 16 amphibians, 12\r\nreptiles, 20 birds, and 27 mammals. Besides these there are many records\r\nof experimental associations that have been contrived in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the increase in our knowledge of the biotic associations of\r\ncockroaches, during the last 70 years, may be gathered from a comparison\r\nof the above figures with those of Miall and Denny (1886) who presented\r\n\"...a long list of parasites which infest the Cockroach.\" This list\r\nincluded 2 bacteria, 6 Protozoa (some of the names are synonyms), 7\r\nnematodes (some of these names are also synonyms), 1 mite, 1 wasp, and\r\n1 beetle. In addition, they mentioned as other foes of the cockroach:\r\nmonkeys, hedgehogs, polecats, cats, rats, birds, chameleons, and frogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\n\r\nWe have listed the organisms known to be associated with cockroaches\r\nsystematically by phylum, class, order, and family. Within each family\r\nthe organisms are listed alphabetically by genus and species. Under each\r\norganism the associated cockroaches are listed as natural or\r\nexperimental hosts, vectors, or prey. Identified cockroaches are listed\r\nby the currently accepted name. Unidentified cockroaches are indicated\r\nby the word \"Cockroaches.\" The name of each cockroach is followed by the\r\ncountry in which the observation was made, the authority for the record,\r\nand with a few exceptions[3] pertinent biological information, where\r\nthis is known. Question marks following the names of organisms or\r\ncountries indicate tentative or questionable identifications.\r\n\r\nRecords of predators capturing and feeding on cockroaches in zoos and on\r\nshipboard we consider natural, even though it is very likely that these\r\nparticular predators would not normally have access to this prey in\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nExperimental prey are cockroaches that were fed to predators in the\r\nlaboratory. Although these predators may have little, if any, access to\r\nthese cockroaches in nature, we have included such records to indicate\r\nthe relative acceptability of cockroaches as food by a wide variety of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nRecords of presumed or known cockroach associates that give no\r\ninformation about an associated cockroach are not included in this\r\nreview, even though certain of these (e.g., species of _Ampulex_,\r\n_Evania_, _Podium_) probably prey upon or parasitize cockroaches\r\nexclusively.\r\n\r\nThe validity of a host-parasite or predator-prey record is dependent\r\nupon the accuracy and knowledge of the observer. In assembling these\r\nrecords we have had to accept, in most instances, the identifications of\r\nspecies made by the original authors. However, as a result of our\r\nstudies on the biology of various species of cockroaches, including some\r\nwork on their hymenopterous parasites, we have questioned certain\r\nrecords in the literature. Other dubious records which have been\r\nperpetuated from one publication to the next, but which apparently were\r\nnot based on fact, have also been questioned or have been clarified with\r\nthe aid of specialists in particular groups.\r\n\r\nBecause the records cover a period of many years, the names of many of\r\nthe organisms as well as the names of some of the cockroaches have been\r\nchanged. Although it would have been comparatively simple to list the\r\nnames as they appeared in the original references, this would have\r\nresulted in misleading redundancy with the same organism being\r\ncatalogued under several synonyms. We have attempted to list each\r\norganism by its currently accepted name. However, no attempt was made to\r\nprepare complete taxonomic synonymies; the only synonyms given are those\r\nthat identify the organisms by the names used by the authors of the\r\npapers cited. The synonyms under which the cockroaches may have been\r\ncited originally are listed in section II. The synonyms of associated\r\norganisms are listed with each organism. Although authorities for the\r\nname changes of the cockroaches are given, these workers are not\r\nnecessarily those who were initially responsible for the synonymies.\r\nVarious sections have been checked by specialists in the particular\r\ngroups. Although we have accepted name changes suggested by these\r\nreviewers, we assume full responsibility for the names.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUTURE WORK\r\n\r\nAfter having examined thousands of references on cockroaches, we are\r\nimpressed by how little is known about the biology of most species. As a\r\nconservative estimate there are 3,500 described species of Blattaria (J.\r\nW. H. Rehn, 1951). In our literature survey we found records of biotic\r\nassociations for about 400 species. Unfortunately, many of these records\r\ncontain only a sentence or two of biological information. Our detailed\r\nknowledge of cockroaches is based on studies of the few domiciliary\r\npests that man attempts to eradicate. Comparable studies of the\r\nbionomics of the less-well-known species should add much valuable\r\ninformation to our knowledge of this ancient group.\r\n\r\nOur understanding of most predator-prey and parasite-host relationships\r\nhas barely progressed beyond the taxonomic stage. The total effect of\r\npredators and parasites in limiting natural populations of cockroaches\r\nremains to be determined. It is still not known how, for example,\r\npredatory or parasitic wasps select specific cockroaches from among all\r\nother insects. Secretions produced by certain cockroaches (e.g.,\r\n2-hexenal by _Eurycotis floridana_) will ward off certain predators. The\r\nidentities and biological activities of most cockroach secretions are\r\nunknown, but the use of protective chemicals against predators may be\r\nwidespread among cockroaches. If so, how effective are these repellents\r\nin protecting the individual or the species? It is not known whether\r\ncockroaches are protected by apparent mimetic resemblances to other\r\narthropods. There is no experimental proof that insect parasites can\r\nsuccessfully attack the eggs of cockroaches that incubate their eggs\r\nwhile they are being carried by the female.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that biological control of cockroaches might be\r\nachieved in limited areas such as man-made structures or sewers, but\r\nthis possibility has not been thoroughly explored. It would be\r\ninformative to know what effects, if any, organisms such as bacteria,\r\nProtozoa (e.g., gregarines), intestinal nematodes, or other helminths\r\nhave on cockroaches. Possibly pathogenic microorganisms can be used for\r\nbiological control of cockroaches; this approach seems to have been\r\nlittle explored.\r\n\r\nAssociations of colonial cockroaches (e.g., _Cryptocercus_ spp.) may be\r\ntruly familial or they may merely result from gregariousness. Newly\r\nhatched nymphs of species that carry their oöthecae until the eggs hatch\r\ncluster near the mother. This may be a response to the mother as such, a\r\nsearch for shelter beneath the nearest object (thigmotaxis? or negative\r\nphototaxis?), or there may well be yet another explanation. Tepper in\r\n1893 stated that the native cockroaches of Australia are almost wholly\r\ncarnivorous; little supporting evidence for this claim has been brought\r\nforward since that time. The apparent supersedure of one species of\r\ndomiciliary cockroach by another may result from antagonism between\r\ndifferent species, or it may result from more rapid breeding and more\r\neffective utilization of available food and space; but which? Several\r\nspecies of cockroaches are frequently found associated with certain\r\nplants (e.g., bromeliads and bananas); the ecological relations in these\r\nassociations remain to be determined. Many of the obscure associations\r\nbetween cockroaches and other insects, spiders, birds, and burrowing\r\nanimals have never been adequately defined. The factors influencing\r\ncannibalism have never been thoroughly investigated experimentally.\r\nThese are only a few ideas for future work that have occurred to us\r\nduring the preparation of this review. We hope that these suggestions as\r\nwell as other questions that may occur to readers will stimulate further\r\nresearch in areas where it is obviously needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise credited, the illustrations were prepared from\r\nphotographs taken by the authors. Except where otherwise stated, all\r\nphotographs were taken of unposed living specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SPECIES OF COCKROACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cockroaches referred to in this paper are listed below. The\r\ncurrently accepted name for each species is given alphabetically by\r\ngenus and species irrespective of its taxonomic affinities. Synonyms\r\nused by certain authors whose work we have quoted are given in brackets\r\nunder the respective species; the synonymy is supported by the reference\r\ncitation that follows each synonym. References to illustrations of\r\ncertain species (e.g., _Blaberus craniifer_) that appear in the paper\r\nfollow the names of the describers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Agis orientalis_ Chopard\r\n\r\n  _Aglaopteryx absimilis_ Gurney _diaphana_ (Fabricius) [_Ceratinoptera\r\n      diaphana_ Fabricius; Rehn and Hebard (1927)]\r\n    _facies_ (Walker) [_Aglaopteryx devia_ Rehn; Princis (1929).\r\n        _A. diaphana_ (Fabricius) in records from Puerto Rico only;\r\n        Rehn (1932b); Gurney (1937)]\r\n    _gemma_ Hebard [In Florida records = _Ceratinoptera diaphana_ R. and\r\n        H.; Hebard (1917)]\r\n    _vegeta_ Rehn\r\n    _ypsilon_ Princis\r\n\r\n  _Allacta similis_ (Saussure) [_Phyllodromia obtusata_ Brunner;\r\n      Zimmerman (1948)]\r\n\r\n  _Alluaudellina cavernicola_ (Shelford) [_Alluaudella cavernicola_\r\n      Shelford; Chopard (1932)]\r\n\r\n  _Amazonina emarginata_ Princis\r\n\r\n  _Anaplecta asema_ Hebard\r\n    _azteca_ Saussure\r\n    _decipiens_ Saussure and Zehntner\r\n    _fallax_ Saussure\r\n    _hemiscotia_ Hebard\r\n    _lateralis_ Burmeister\r\n    _mexicana_ Saussure\r\n\r\n  _Aneurina tahuata_ Hebard\r\n    _viridis_ Hebard\r\n\r\n  _Apotrogia angolensis_ Kirby [_Acanthogyna deplanata_ Chopard;\r\n      Princis (1957)]\r\n\r\n  _Aptera fusca_ (Thunberg) [_Aptera cingulata_ (Burmeister);\r\n      Gurney (personal communication, 1957)]\r\n\r\n  _Apteroblatta perplexa_ Shelford\r\n\r\n  _Archiblatta hoevenii_ Vollenhoven\r\n\r\n  _Archimandrita marmorata_ (Stoll)\r\n    _tessellata_ Rehn\r\n\r\n  _Arenivaga apacha_ (Saussure)\r\n    _bolliana_ (Saussure)\r\n    _erratica_ (Rehn)\r\n    _floridensis_ Caudell\r\n    _grata_ Hebard\r\n    _roseni_ (Brancsik) [_Heterogamodes roseni_; Bei-Bienko (1950).\r\n        _\"Polygamia\" roseni_ is undoubtedly an erroneous citation of\r\n        _Polyphaga roseni_, as there is no genus _Polygamia_ (Gurney,\r\n        personal communication, 1957)].\r\n    _tonkawa_ Hebard\r\n\r\n  _Aristiger histrio_ (Burmeister) [_Plumiger histrio_ (Burm.);\r\n      Bruijning (1948). _Hemithyrsocera histrio_ Burm.; Hebard (1929)]\r\n\r\n  _Aspiduchus boriquen_ J.

ECOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ecology of extinct cockroaches is necessarily a highly speculative\r\nsubject. From the coexistence of fossil cockroaches and fossil plants in\r\nthe same geological stratum, one might conclude that there had been\r\nintimate associations between them during prehistoric life. Heer (1864)\r\nand Goldenberg (1877) suggested that Carboniferous cockroaches fed on\r\nthe plants with which they have been found as fossils. Scudder (1879)\r\nconcurred with this hypothesis. However, Bolton (1911), remarking on the\r\nnoticeable associations of blattoid wings with vegetable remains,\r\nsuggested that the cockroaches may have been partly carnivorous, feeding\r\non the snails _Spirorbis pusillus_, which were attached to the leaves of\r\n_Cordaites_. Yet the proximity of fossil insects and plants in the same\r\ngeological formation is hardly proof of a similar association during\r\nlife. In fact, Sellards (1903), Bolton (1921), and Laurentiaux (1951)\r\nhave all pointed out that the cockroach remains, particularly the more\r\nresistant wings, may have been washed into streams by heavy rains and\r\ntransported with drifting plant material to places where permanent\r\ndeposits were accumulating.\r\n\r\nSome species of fossil cockroaches have long, well-developed\r\novipositors, very unlike present-day cockroaches whose ovipositors are\r\nsmall and nonprotruding. Brongniart (1889) and Zalesskii (1939, 1953)\r\nhave suggested that certain Permian and Carboniferous cockroaches with\r\nlong ovipositors may have inserted their eggs singly into trees and\r\nother plants, rather than protecting the eggs with an oötheca. However,\r\nLaurentiaux (1951), although conceding the possibility of egg laying in\r\nvegetable material, suggested that oviposition into the earth is more\r\nprobable because of the unbending nature of the ovipositor.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ecological associations of modern cockroaches should be\r\nwell known from direct observation, actually most species are still\r\nlittle more than names on museum specimens, and our knowledge of them is\r\nfragmentary. All too frequently ecological observations have been only\r\nincidental to taxonomic or faunistic studies; yet the biological\r\ninformation that is contained in such papers is all that we know of many\r\nspecies. For this reason we have cited these observations in some\r\ndetail, especially when they were brief; longer accounts of cockroach\r\nbionomics, of necessity, have been abstracted.\r\n\r\nVery few exclusively ecological studies of insects have included\r\ncockroaches. The native woodroaches (_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, _P.\r\nuhleriana_, and _P. virginica_) of the northern United States were\r\nincluded in ecological studies of the Orthoptera by Hubbell (1922),\r\nStrohecker (1937), and Cantrall (1943). Fifteen species of cockroaches\r\nwere included in an ecological study of the Orthoptera of northern\r\nFlorida by Friauf (1953). The original papers should be consulted for\r\ndetailed descriptions of the habitats and accounts of the associated\r\nplants and other Orthoptera.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter the cockroaches are grouped into those that have been\r\nfound in man-made structures and those that occur in other habitats.\r\nCertain species may appear in several categories because they live both\r\nindoors and out. The structural pests are divided into cockroaches that\r\noccur in land-based structures, those on ships, and those in aircraft.\r\nThe nonstructural cockroaches are divided into those that occur in quite\r\nspecific habitats (caves, water, and deserts) and those that occur\r\ngenerally out of doors. Nests of various arthropods serve as\r\nmicrohabitats of commensal cockroaches; these latter associations are\r\ndiscussed on pages 310-318.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter our discussion is limited to the physical environment\r\nand specific habitats of cockroaches, and only very general references\r\nare made to associated organisms. The relationships of cockroaches to\r\nthe biota are examined in detail in subsequent chapters. To show the\r\nfull extent of the associations, the associates, from bacteroids to\r\nvertebrates, are arranged phyletically. These associate-centered\r\nclassifications serve admirably to relate various species of cockroaches\r\nwithin common bounds, but fail to give an integrated account of the\r\ntotal biotic relationships in the ecology of each species. Although\r\nphysically separated in this monograph, the many associates of each\r\nspecies of cockroach should all be considered in appraising the ecology\r\nof that species. To assist the reader to achieve this end, we have\r\nincluded a checklist (p. 290) which serves as a convenient index to\r\ncertain organisms associated with particular species of cockroaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVE HABITATS\r\n\r\nCaves, mines, and animal burrows are somewhat similar habitats that\r\nprovide many species of cockroaches with shelter and frequently with\r\nfood. The microclimates of these cockroach habitats have not been\r\ndescribed in detail in the papers cited, but it seems rather obvious\r\nthat natural caves, man-made caves (mines), and burrows offer relatively\r\nstable temperatures and humidities and protection from adverse climatic\r\nconditions. Although such cavernicolous animals as birds and bats\r\nperiodically leave caves to search for food, cockroaches find the\r\naccumulated guano and animal and plant detritus an entirely adequate\r\ndietary (Chopard, 1938). Cockroaches in mines presumably subsist on the\r\nfood and feces dropped by man and mine animals (e.g., pit ponies). Food\r\nstored in their nests by burrowing animals is undoubtedly utilized by\r\nthe associated cockroaches.\r\n\r\nCavernicolous cockroaches show varying degrees of dependence on and\r\nadaptation to these specialized habitats. Some of the common domiciliary\r\nspecies (_Blatta orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_, and _Periplaneta\r\namericana_) may have accompanied man into caves and remained there after\r\nhe left (Chopard, 1929a, 1936, 1938). Other species, from the paucity of\r\nrecords noting their occurrence in caves, are undoubtedly accidental\r\ninhabitants that may never become established. Besides these, however,\r\nmany other species of cockroaches have established large breeding\r\ncolonies in caves. Although some of the latter species show very\r\npronounced morphological adaptations to a cave life, many others\r\nresemble their noncavernicolous relatives. The possible origin of\r\ncavernicolous Orthoptera has been discussed by Chopard (1938).\r\n\r\nCavernicolous cockroaches have been segregated into four groups\r\naccording to their ability to adapt to their environment and the degree\r\nof their specialized evolution (Chopard, 1936, 1938): (1) =Trogloxenes=:\r\nCockroaches that occur in caves in a sporadic fashion (the domiciliary\r\ncockroaches and accidentals such as _Ectobius_ and _Heterogamodes_). (2)\r\n=Troglophiles=: Cockroaches found habitually in caves (_Symploce_,\r\n_Periplaneta cavernicola_). (3) =Guanobies=: Cockroaches that live in\r\nthe guano of cavernicolous vertebrates (_Gyna_, _Acanthogyna_,\r\n_Dyscologamia_, _Pycnoscelus_). (4) =Troglobies=: Cockroaches that\r\napparently cannot live outside of caves and which show very marked\r\nadaptive characters (_Alluaudellina_, _Nocticola_, _Spelaeoblatta_,\r\n_Typhloblatta_). For complete discussions of these groups including\r\ndescriptions of the adaptive characters shown by certain genera, the\r\noriginal sources should be consulted.\r\n\r\nAlthough we know very little of the ethology of most of the\r\ncavernicolous cockroaches, it is intriguing that three of the six known\r\nspecies of _Nocticola_ are cave dwellers, two are inhabitants of termite\r\nnests (p. 315), and one (_N. bolivari_) was found under stones and\r\ncement blocks (Chopard, 1950b). In the rather extensive list of\r\ncavernicolous cockroaches only two (_Arenivaga grata_ and _Parcoblatta_\r\nsp.) were taken from caves in North America north of Yucatan. All other\r\nrecords are from Africa, Asia, Central America, Europe, West Indies,\r\nEast Indies, and the Philippine Islands. This we find puzzling. Packard\r\n(1888) in his extensive study of the cave fauna of North America listed\r\nno cockroaches. Dearolf (1941) found only the above-mentioned\r\n_Parcoblatta_ in one of 37 caves in Pennsylvania. Kohls and Jellison\r\n(1948) listed no cockroaches among the arthropods from six bat caves in\r\nTexas. We would expect _Periplaneta americana_ to inhabit mines in North\r\nAmerica, but we have found no such records. Have cockroaches been\r\nignored in fauna collections from North American caves, or has our cave\r\nfauna been less extensively studied than that of other parts of the\r\nworld?\r\n\r\nThe two species of cockroaches found in mines (_Blattella germanica_ and\r\n_Periplaneta americana_) are also found in caves. For this reason we\r\nhave included them in the list headed Cavernicolous Cockroaches. On the\r\nother hand, the cockroaches found in animal burrows are generally\r\ndifferent species from those found in caves, so we have grouped these\r\ntogether in a second list.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVERNICOLOUS COCKROACHES\r\n\r\n=Alluaudellina cavernicola=\r\n\r\n_Tanganyika._--From Kulumusi caves, near Tanga.

Its principal\r\nhabitat is rodent burrows in loess dust, where it is not infrequently\r\nfound in the food stores of the host (Vlasov and Miram, 1937).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pycnoscelus surinamensis=\r\n\r\n_Texas._--In the nests of wood rats, _Neotoma_ sp. (Hebard, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERT HABITATS\r\n\r\nThere is relatively little ecological information about cockroaches that\r\nlive in deserts, even though certain species, notably _Polyphaga\r\naegyptiaca_, have long been known to inhabit arid zones. In fact, so\r\nlittle is known about the ecology of arid-zone insects in general that\r\nit is more a subject for research than for review (Pradhan, 1957). In\r\ntheir account of the cockroaches of Northern Kenya and Jubaland, Kevan\r\nand Chopard (1954) describe in some detail the vegetational areas of\r\nthis arid desert or semidesert country, which averages only about 10\r\ninches of rain per year. The other sources that are cited below contain\r\nvery little more biological information than the abstracted material\r\nthat is given under each species.\r\n\r\nNearly all the Polyphaginae are said to be marked xerophiles whose\r\ndistribution coincides with that of the deserts (Bei-Bienko, 1950). With\r\nthe exception of _Arenivaga floridana_, the species of Polyphaginae in\r\nthe United States all occur in the Southwest, where they are (with a few\r\nexceptions) the only cockroaches that inhabit the desert regions proper\r\n(Hebard, 1917). The Polyphaginae reach their greatest diversity in the\r\ndeserts of Northern Africa and Anterior and South-Central Asia\r\n(Bei-Bienko, 1950). Some of the desert-inhabiting species have also been\r\nfound under nondesert conditions. This only further exemplifies the\r\nplasticity of cockroaches in adapting to different environments.\r\n\r\nThe ability of desert insects to live under what appear to be extremely\r\nunfavorable conditions has been abundantly illustrated by Pradhan\r\n(1957). Uvarov (1954) has pointed out that a desert \"covers a great\r\nvariety of landscapes, which provide desert animals with a wide range of\r\nhabitats, some of them offering very favorable conditions for life.\"\r\nPradhan (1957) stated that many desert animals avoid the extremes of\r\ndesert climates by choosing suitable microclimates for diurnal resting\r\nplaces, that a permanent or temporary underground existence is very\r\ncommon among insects in arid zones, and that many nocturnal Orthoptera\r\nburrow into the soil or hide under stones where temperatures are lower.\r\nFor example, the type of _Parcoblatta desertae_ was found under a\r\nboulder on the bare desert (Rehn and Hebard, 1909).\r\n\r\nSymbiosis with burrowing animals is another solution to the problem of\r\nexistence in the desert; in fact, symbiosis is a mode of life adopted by\r\nnearly half of the desert cockroaches about which we have any\r\ninformation. Vlasov and Miram (1937) found _Polyphaga indica_,\r\n_Polyphaga saussurei_, and _Arenivaga roseni_ in the burrows of rodents\r\nand desert turtles. In the desert regions of Arizona, females of\r\n_Arenivaga erratica_ were found commonly in burrows of the kangaroo rat\r\n(Vorhies and Taylor, 1922) and in dens of wood rats and ground squirrels\r\n(Ball et al., 1942). _Arenivaga apacha_ and _Arenivaga bolliana_ have\r\nalso been found inhabiting the nests of wood rats (Hebard, 1917; 1943a).\r\nBei-Bienko (1950) has suggested that the adaptation of desert-inhabiting\r\ncockroaches to rodent burrows might enable these insects to survive in\r\nthe severe climatic conditions of deserts in summer.\r\n\r\nUnder desert conditions in southern Arizona, the relative humidity\r\noutside of the burrows of the kangaroo rat is 1 to 15 percent during the\r\nday and 15 to 40 percent at night; but inside the burrows the relative\r\nhumidity is 30 to 50 percent, and the temperature, even during the day,\r\nis below 30° C. (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1949). Thus by living in rodent\r\nburrows during the day and going outside at night, the desert\r\ncockroaches could avail themselves of the most favorable microclimates\r\nobtainable. Presumably whatever food these insects eat provides them\r\nwith sufficient water to enable them to survive under desert conditions.\r\nBodenheimer (1953) has suggested that the extent of utilization of dew,\r\nwhich is sometimes heavy in the desert, should be investigated; he\r\nstated that tenebrionid beetles have been seen in the early morning\r\neating dry [dead?] herbs that were still wet with dew. It is obvious\r\nthat there is a need for additional detailed information without which\r\nwe can only guess about the ecology of desert cockroaches.\r\n\r\nIn the following list we have cited only those species that were stated\r\nto have been found under desert conditions. Undoubtedly, related species\r\nthat have been taken in similar localities are also desert-inhabiting\r\nforms, as, for example, other species of _Arenivaga_ that were collected\r\nin Texas by Hebard (1943a). In the absence of specific information\r\nlinking such other species with deserts, we have arbitrarily relegated\r\nthose forms to the section on outdoor habitats. In addition to the\r\nspecies listed below, desert cockroaches are said to be found in the\r\nfollowing genera: _Anisogamia_, _Mononychoblatta_, and _Nymphytria_\r\n(Chopard, 1938).\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERT COCKROACHES\r\n\r\n\r\n=Agis orientalis=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--In desert-grass and thorn-bush country; scattered,\r\ndry tufts of grasses interspersed among acacia bush and scattered trees\r\n(Kevan and Chopard, 1954).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Arenivaga apacha=\r\n\r\n_U.S.A._--Inhabits desert regions of the Southwest, has been found in\r\nnests of wood rats (Hebard, 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Arenivaga bolliana=\r\n\r\n_U.S.A._--On gravelly hillocks, in scattered scrub, and in the nests of\r\nwood rats in Texas.

Two small\r\ngroups of males were observed in the midst of the sandy desert north of\r\nYuma, Ariz.; these insects alternately flew and ran over the sand in the\r\nhot sun while headed in a southwesterly direction (Wheeler, 1911).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Euandroblatta palpalis=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--In desert-grass and thorn-bush country (Kevan and\r\nChopard, 1954).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heterogamodes rugosa=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--\"All from desert grass and thorn bush (on sand).\" It\r\nwas stated (under discussion of _Tivia fulva_) that _Heterogamodes_\r\nfemales live more or less buried in the sand (Kevan and Chopard, 1954).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Namablatta bitaeniata=\r\n\r\n_Southwestern Africa._--Limited in distribution to the more arid\r\nportions, being peculiar to extreme desert conditions (Rehn, 1937).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nauphoeta punctipennis=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--In desert grass and thorn bush; \"probably the\r\ncommonest of all the medium-sized cockroaches occurring in the area\r\nunder discussion, coming very freely to light\" (Kevan and Chopard,\r\n1954).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parcoblatta desertae=\r\n\r\n_U.S.A._--In the desert and semidesert mountainous areas of the\r\nSouthwest; it is rarely found on the desert floor (Hebard, 1917).

Uvarov (_in_ Chopard, 1929b) indicated that\r\nfemales of this genus are found in various desert localities,\r\nparticularly where vegetative debris occurs, but they are not strictly\r\nattached to sandy terrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Polyphaga indica=\r\n\r\n_Turkmen S.S.R._--This species prefers sandy soils where the nymphs,\r\nalate males, and wingless females \"swim\" readily through the sand; they\r\ncan also be found in the burrows of desert animals (Vlasov and Miram,\r\n1937).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Polyphaga saussurei=\r\n\r\n_Turkmen S.S.R._--Its principal habitats are rodent burrows in loess\r\ndust and burrows of the desert turtle (Vlasov and Miram, 1937).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Supella hottentotta=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--Taken in bushes by dry river bed and in desert-grass\r\nand thorn-bush country at several stations (Kevan and Chopard, 1954).\r\n\"...taken with light at night running on bark of a large acacia tree\"\r\n(Rehn, 1947).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Symploce kevani=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--In desert grass and thorn-bush country (Kevan and\r\nChopard, 1954).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Theganopteryx straminea=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--Taken at three stations in desert grass and thorn\r\nbush (Kevan and Chopard, 1954).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tivia brunnea=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--In open sandy, riverine bush (scanty ground cover\r\namong acacia trees and doum palms) (Kevan and Chopard, 1954).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tivia fulva=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--In desert grass and thorn bush; distributed in\r\nsemidesert areas south of Sahara; the apterous females probably live\r\nburied in sand (Kevan and Chopard, 1954).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tivia obscura=\r\n\r\n_Northern Kenya._--In desert grass and thorn bush (Kevan and Chopard,\r\n1954).\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUATIC HABITATS\r\n\r\nThe so-called aquatic or amphibious cockroaches are all members of the\r\nsubfamily Epilamprinae (Chopard, 1938). These forms are not nearly as\r\naquatic as water beetles or aquatic Hemiptera, but in their relations to\r\nwater they behave differently from nonamphibious cockroaches, which tend\r\nto avoid water except for drinking. There are apparently no special\r\nmorphological characteristics that distinguish amphibious cockroaches\r\n(Shelford, 1907, 1909a; Chopard, 1938), although Takahashi (1926) listed\r\nseveral characters that he considered made _Opisthoplatia maculata_\r\nadapted for an aquatic life: (1) Back of body easily wetted; (2) long\r\nhairs on underside of thorax trap air; (3) terminal abdominal spiracles\r\nopen into tubes that extend rearward; (4) long hairs on ventral surfaces\r\nof cerci \"protect\" terminal abdominal spiracles. Annandale (1906) also\r\nsuggested that the position of the posterior abdominal spiracles, at the\r\nbase of tubes that project rearward from beneath the seventh tergite,\r\nare an adaptation to an aquatic life. However, as Shelford (1907) and\r\nChopard (1938) have pointed out, this same feature may be observed in\r\nmany terrestrial cockroaches. The legs of amphibious cockroaches are\r\nsimilar to those of nonaquatic species and are not modified for swimming\r\n(Shelford, 1909a; Takahashi, 1926).\r\n\r\nBiological observations have been made on relatively few species, but\r\nrepresentatives of at least six genera occur in quasi-aquatic habitats.\r\nStrictly speaking, these cockroaches live on land at the edges of\r\nstreams or pools and spend relatively brief periods in the water. A few\r\nspecies are found in water-filled bromeliads. The behavior of the known\r\namphibious species of cockroaches in relation to their habitats is\r\ndiscussed below.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHIBIOUS COCKROACHES\r\n\r\n\r\n=Audreia bromeliadarum=\r\n\r\n_Panama._--These insects when disturbed would dive into the water that\r\nhad collected in the base of the bromeliad; they would disappear beneath\r\nthe surface and remain submerged for some considerable time (Caudell,\r\n1914).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dryadoblatta scotti=\r\n\r\n_Trinidad._--This species was taken from the leaf bases of _Tillandsia_\r\nsp. at 3,100 feet; water had collected between the leaves and the insect\r\nwas presumed to be more or less amphibious (Scott, 1912). Subaquatic in\r\nthe bromeliad _Glomeropitcairnia erectiflora_: \"This large and handsome\r\nspecies [_D. scotti_] is very common in the larger, water-filled,\r\nepiphytic bromeliads of the rain forest. Within these plants it is\r\nusually to be found, often in considerable numbers, just above the\r\nsurface of the water or partly immersed in it. The cockroaches will\r\ndescend rapidly into the water when alarmed and probably obtain their\r\nnourishment from the accumulated organic matter in the water. Floating\r\nmaterial is probably taken and it seems less likely that they feed below\r\nthe surface. They appear to be ovoviviparous.\" (Princis and Kevan,\r\n1955.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Epilampra abdomen-nigrum=\r\n\r\n_Puerto Rico._--Abundant in wet \"malojillo\" meadows. The nymphs swim\r\neasily and remain under water for long periods, as do the adults (Seín,\r\n1923; Wolcott, 1950).\r\n\r\n_Panama._--A swimming nymph, captured in a dipper with mosquito larvae\r\nin a lagoon of the Rio Chilibre, was kept under observations in an\r\naquarium. If disturbed, the insect dived into the water from floating\r\nvegetation and swam rapidly below the surface for a minute or two.\r\nFinally becoming quiescent, the cockroach would then cling to submerged\r\nroots; twice it remained still for 15 minutes before climbing to the\r\nsurface, where it remained for five or more minutes before emerging\r\ncompletely (Crowell, 1946).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Epilampra annandalei=\r\n\r\n_Lower Burma._--One male and three nymphs were collected in the Dawna\r\nHills by Annandale who made the following observations: \"The wingless\r\nspecimens were under stones in a jungle stream and behaved just as the\r\none I obtained in Chota, Nagpur, did [Annandale, 1906]. The winged\r\nspecimen was under a stone at the edge of the stream, but swam readily.\r\nIt did not seem so much at home in the water, however, and apparently\r\ncould not, owing to the wings, raise the tip of its abdomen above the\r\nsurface.\" (Shelford, 1909a.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Epilampra= sp.\r\n\r\n_Siamese Malay States._--Wingless females rested on floating logs from\r\nwhich they would dive into the water upon the least disturbance; they\r\nremained under water for several minutes, then surfaced beneath the\r\nshelter of the log. In the jungle all females were taken either in the\r\nwater or among matted roots on the sides of the stream. Winged males\r\nwere seen rising from the surface of the water (Annandale, 1900).\r\n\r\n_Sarawak._--All specimens were immature; they swam and dived well, but\r\nwere soon drowned if prevented from rising to the surface to breathe.\r\n\"When at rest the body of the cockroach is almost entirely submerged,\r\nthe tip of the abdomen alone projecting above the surface of the water;\r\nthe abdomen moves gently up and down and every 30-40 seconds a bubble of\r\nair issues from the prothoracic spiracle on each side.\" (Shelford, 1901,\r\n1916.)\r\n\r\n_India._--A nymphal female, found in a jungle stream at Chota Nagpur,\r\ncould swim with belly or back upward. When held under water it drowned\r\nin a few minutes. The tip of the abdomen was held out of water\r\n(Annandale, 1906).\r\n\r\nShelford (1907) has suggested that the immature stages of terrestrial\r\nspecies of _Epilampra_ may well be amphibious. This is an area that\r\ncould profit by more field observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Opisthoplatia maculata=\r\n\r\n_Formosa._--Invariably found under or between rocks near mountain\r\nstreams. The wingless adult and the nymph have similar habits. Normally\r\nthe cockroach lives on land, and when it goes into the water it returns\r\nto land within a few minutes. This cockroach rarely swims, but when it\r\ndoes, it maintains its body in a horizontal position just below the\r\nsurface of the water. Ordinarily, it walks on the river bottom or on\r\nwater-covered rocks. This insect feeds on decayed leaves and, according\r\nto Shikano, it will eat human feces. (Takahashi, 1926.)\r\n\r\nThis species has a large number of long hydrophobic hairs on the ventral\r\nsides of the thorax and anterior abdominal segments. When the insect\r\nsubmerges, air is trapped in these hairs. The thoracic and one pair of\r\nabdominal spiracles open into the bubble of trapped air. However, the\r\ninsect apparently does not use this plastron of air to replenish its\r\ntracheal air supply, but, like _Rhicnoda natatrix_ (see below), it\r\ninspires air while at the surface through its posterior abdominal\r\nspiracles and expires air into the bubble under the thorax. While the\r\ninsect is submerged, the air bubble increases in volume until part of it\r\nbreaks away and floats to the surface. (Takahashi, 1926.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Opisthoplatia orientalis=\r\n\r\n_Formosa._--Lives on or in swampy ground (Takahashi, 1924).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rhicnoda natatrix=\r\n\r\n_Sarawak._--Immature cockroaches were found in sodden leaves at the edge\r\nof a pool, where they rested for hours at a time. Generally the fore\r\npart of the body was in the water but the tip of the abdomen was always\r\nin air. When disturbed the insects dived into the water and hid under\r\nsticks and stones on the bottom. Air is inspired through the posterior\r\nabdominal spiracles, when they projected above the water surface, and\r\nexpired through the thoracic spiracles. In experiments in which the\r\ninsects' abdomens were held immersed in water, with the thorax exposed,\r\nthe insects died in 6 to 12 hours or less. (Shelford, 1907.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stictolampra buqueti concinula=\r\n\r\n_Westsumba._--Found under moist fallen leaves on gravelly shore of\r\nMelolo River. The nymphs distinguished themselves through their\r\namphibious mode of life and were often good swimmers (Princis, 1957a).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Unidentified epilamprines=\r\n\r\n_Brazil._--These cockroaches were found under stones at the side of a\r\nrocky stream at Ouro Preto. When disturbed they ran down under the\r\nsurface of the water and hid under stones at the bottom. When thrown on\r\nthe water surface, they were helpless, and to get beneath the water\r\nsurface they had to walk down some object. When they had penetrated the\r\nsurface film they could swim freely. Specimens kept in jars lived\r\nseveral days with only a portion of their abdomens exposed to the air.\r\n(Bristowe, 1925.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTDOOR HABITATS\r\n\r\nThis category is a catchall for all cockroaches that are not limited to\r\nthe more circumscribed habitats that have been previously considered.\r\nSome cockroaches in this section select specific microhabitats (e.g.,\r\n_Cryptocercus_ spp., which live exclusively in rotten logs; and\r\n_Neoblattella dryas_, _N. eurydice_, and _N. grossbecki_ in bromeliads).\r\nOthers are found in a wide variety of habitats (e.g., _Ischnoptera\r\nderopeltiformis_ and _Parcoblatta_ spp.). But some species are so little\r\nknown that their actual habitats are barely suggested in the collection\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nWilliams (1941) made an ecological study of the floor fauna of the\r\nPanama rain forest. He found Orthoptera (nearly all were unidentified\r\nnymphal cockroaches) in the litter of dead leaves, twigs, and other\r\nplant products in over 90 percent of the quadrats he examined. These\r\ninsects represented about 0.25 percent of the total animal population.\r\n\r\nDelamare Deboutteville (1948) made a quantitative study of the animal\r\npopulation in suspended soil that had accumulated between the roots of\r\nforest epiphytes of the lower Ivory Coast. He analyzed 2 dm.^3 samples\r\nof soil from an epiphyte located 45 meters above ground on a main branch\r\nof _Parinarium_, with these results: _Horizon A._--Superficial zone of\r\nlarge rootlets, 6 cm. deep: 2 cockroaches, 4 arachnids, and 4 beetles.\r\n_Horizon B._--Zone of fine rootlets, 6 cm. deep: 6 cockroaches and\r\nnumerous other arthropods. _Horizon C._--Humid zone, 8 cm. deep: 7\r\ncockroaches and numerous other arthropods. Plants, such as _Palissota_,\r\nwere also living in this very original biotype.\r\n\r\nThe species of cockroaches listed below have been found in the following\r\nkinds of outdoor microhabitats: In jungle, forest, and woodlands they\r\nhave been found in rotten wood; under bark of living, dead, and fallen\r\ntrees; in decay cavities in trees; burrowing in living bark; on foliage\r\nof trees, shrubs, bushes, and low herbage; on vines and in bromeliads\r\nand epiphytic ferns; under signs on trees and stumps; in piles of logs\r\nand firewood; under dead leaves and debris; in and under decaying fruit\r\non the ground. Cockroaches have been found between the leaves and under\r\nleaf sheaths of sugarcane, corn, and other grasses; under dry fibers and\r\nfronds of coconut trees; in hollow stems and bases of tree-fern fronds;\r\nunder bracts of banana blossoms and in bunches of bananas (p. 146).\r\nCockroaches also inhabit abandoned cocoons and larval tents, wasp nests,\r\nant nests, termite nests, bird nests, rat nests, and burrows of other\r\nrodents (pp. 23-25, 310-319). Cockroaches have been found in rock\r\ncrevices and under rocks; under boards and other objects on ground;\r\nunder seaweed, drift, and other debris on beaches; burrowing in soil and\r\nunder clods of earth; in marshes and swamps; in dumps and rubbish\r\nheaps.\r\n\r\nThe above list does not exhaust the available outdoor microhabitats that\r\ncockroaches find suitable for their continued existence, but it is\r\nfairly representative. Although we have no measurements to substantiate\r\nthis conclusion, we suggest that the microhabitats cited above have a\r\nmore constant temperature and a relatively higher humidity than is\r\nprovided by the surrounding macrohabitats. We would expect insects such\r\nas cockroaches, whose water balance is dependent on a continuous supply\r\nof fluid water or moist food, to seek moist environments or to avoid\r\nsituations in which their transpiration might increase. Deviations,\r\npresumably brief, from this expected behavior must occur to account for\r\nthe cockroaches that are found under relatively unfavorable\r\nenvironmental conditions. Despite the apparent preference for cryptic\r\nhabitats, some cockroaches are found in hot sunlight (_Ellipsidion_\r\nspp.; Tepper, 1893); Rehn (1945) has stated that many kinds are diurnal\r\nrather than nocturnal. Movement of cockroaches between habitats may be\r\nassumed to occur; but movement from an unfavorable environment to a more\r\nfavorable one, following a shift in water balance, has not been observed\r\nin nature; however, laboratory experiments suggest that the mechanism\r\nfor mediating such behavior is present in some species of cockroaches\r\n(Gunn and Cosway, 1938; Roth and Willis, 1952a). Obviously, additional\r\nresearch is needed on the bionomics of all species. Further conclusions\r\nbased on current limited knowledge can only be speculative and possibly\r\nmisleading.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCKROACHES FROM OUTDOOR HABITATS\r\n\r\n(Except Amphibious, Desert, and Cavernicolous Forms)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aglaopteryx absimilis=\r\n\r\n_Puerto Rico._--Living in rotten, wooden fence; living between leaves of\r\n_Samanea saman_ and in abandoned cocoons of _Megalopyge krugii_ on\r\nbucare trees (Wolcott, 1950).\r\n\r\n_Leeward Islands._--On coconut tree (Princis and Kevan, 1955).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aglaopteryx facies=\r\n\r\n_Puerto Rico._--As _diaphana_, in dead branch 10 feet above the ground\r\non Mona Island (Hebard, 1917).

Occasional specimens are, however, sometimes\r\nbeaten from bushes. Individuals are decidedly active and are usually to\r\nbe found in the greatest numbers in sandy situations\" (Hebard, 1917).\r\n\r\n_Florida._--Throughout winter and spring they are frequent beneath\r\nleaves and other debris on ground, especially in dry, sandy locations\r\n(Blatchley, 1920).

This cockroach not only lives in rotten, dead logs but also in\r\nsound logs that have been down only a few years. In Virginia it is found\r\nmore often in chestnut and hemlock. \"It occurs fairly often in oak, and\r\nhas been found in pine, spruce, and arbor vitae.... There is little\r\nevidence that they ever leave the log and enter the ground\" (Cleveland\r\net al., 1934).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cryptocercus relictus=\r\n\r\n_Eastern Manchuria._--In great numbers under rotting fallen trees and in\r\nrotten dead wood (Bei-Bienko, 1950).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cutilia soror=\r\n\r\n_Marquesas Islands._--Males under stones and dead log (Hebard, 1933a).\r\n\r\n_Hawaii._--In soil about roots of pineapple (Illingworth, 1927).

Williams also\r\nlists the following as food plants: _Cryptomeria_, algaroba, lime trees,\r\nripening mangoes, papayas, and oranges. However, Bianchi (personal\r\ncommunication, 1954) doubted that any of the above are the main dietary,\r\nbecause the largest populations he had seen \"were found in the fairly\r\ndry litter of Star Jasmine (_Jasminum pubescens_ Willd.), well removed\r\nfrom any of the plants mentioned by Williams.\"\r\n\r\n_Raiatea, Society Islands._--Beaten out of bracken (Cheesman, 1927).\r\n\r\n_Uahuka, Marquesas Islands._--Under bark (Hebard, 1933a).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dryadoblatta scotti=\r\n\r\n_Trinidad._--Very common in water-filled, epiphytic bromeliads in the\r\nrain forest (see p. 31) (Princis and Kevan, 1955).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ectobius africanus=\r\n\r\n_Belgian Congo._--Females in forest margin and in forest undergrowth\r\n(Rehn, 1931).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ectobius albicinctus=\r\n\r\n_South France._--Females and young beneath stones (Blair, 1922).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ectobius duskei=\r\n\r\n_U.S.S.R._--In the steppe belt, it is a very characteristic member of\r\nfeather-grass steppes, where it is found in associations of typically\r\nsteppe vegetation, with feather grasses at the head (_Stipa lessingiana_\r\nand others), and on rocky slopes; it occurs frequently in cultivated\r\nfields of young crops and also in young geological strata in sections\r\nwith virgin soil. The populations of this steppe cockroach average 6 to\r\n8 individuals per square meter from the middle to the end of July. By\r\nthe end of summer most individuals were observed at the bases of straw\r\nstacks with a canopy, having their south sides sheltered. This is the\r\nonly species of _Ectobius_ adapted to a purely steppe biocenose.\r\n(Bei-Bienko, 1950.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ectobius lapponicus=\r\n\r\n_Southeastern Europe._--Numerous under stones on Trebovic (Burr, 1898).\r\n\r\n_U.S.S.R._--Found in wooded communities and peat bogs (in northern part\r\nof its range); males occur predominantly on herbaceous plants and\r\nbushes, but females hide under fallen leaves, moss, etc. (Bei-Bienko,\r\n1950).

We have collected this\r\nspecies for several summers in a fairly dense, wooded area near\r\ndwellings, among fallen leaves and climbing on the erect stems and\r\nundersides of the leaves of periwinkle. Oöthecae were found on the\r\nground under leaves and debris.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ectobius panzeri=\r\n\r\n_England._--Abundant on sandhills along shoreline among roots of grass\r\n(Burr, 1908). Under dead seaweed and other rubbish a few yards from\r\nshore on ground that would be washed by the sea (Lucas, 1896). Nymphs\r\nfound among marram grass (Buxton, 1914).

A\r\nnonexhaustive list of such structures would include dwellings,\r\nrestaurants, mess halls, barracks, groceries, markets, bakeries,\r\ndairies, drug stores, department stores, hotels, hospitals, warehouses,\r\nmills, factories, packing houses, animal houses, breweries,\r\nincinerators, privies, sewers, sewage treatment plants, ships, aircraft,\r\netc. Although dwellings are only one of the many kinds of structures\r\nthat are colonized by cockroaches, the several species that have adopted\r\nthis mode of life are generally referred to as domiciliary cockroaches.\r\nThis term is adequate only if we remember that these cockroaches are not\r\nrestricted to domiciles but are pests in other structures as well.\r\n\r\nAssociations between man and certain species of cockroaches possibly\r\nstarted as casually as the short-lived association that Beebe (1953)\r\nobserved when he discovered three cockroaches in the newly built couch\r\nof an orang-utan. Obviously, when man came down from the trees, his\r\nfellow travelers found his cave dwellings and other abodes particularly\r\nfavorable habitats. From such primitive beginnings, domiciliary\r\ncockroaches have spread into every kind of structure that man has since\r\ndevised. We predict that when man develops a suitable vehicle,\r\ncockroaches will someday accompany him into space. Yet despite the\r\napparent predilection of certain species of cockroaches for man, man is\r\nonly incidental to these associations. Only the shelter and food that\r\nman unwittingly provides for these unwelcome guests attract cockroaches\r\nto him; man's physical presence is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nMost, if not all, of the common domiciliary cockroaches apparently\r\noriginated in the Tropics or sub-Tropics from whence they have spread,\r\nthrough normal commercial channels, into most of the inhabited world. At\r\nleast eight domiciliary cockroaches originated in Africa (Rehn, 1945):\r\n_Blatta orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_, _Leucophaea maderae_,\r\n_Nauphoeta cinerea_, _Oxyhaloa buprestoides_, _Periplaneta americana_,\r\n_P. australasiae_, and _Supella supellectilium_; and, perhaps,\r\n_Periplaneta brunnea_ as well; _Neostylopyga rhombifolia_ was probably\r\nof Indo-Malayan origin; _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ was of oriental\r\norigin; and _Leurolestes pallidus_ was endemic in the West Indies (Rehn,\r\n1945). Princis (1954a) rejected Africa as the original home of _Blatta\r\norientalis_ and advanced reasons for placing its origin in Central Asia.\r\n\r\nSeveral domiciliary species have become well established in temperate\r\nzones and some even in the Arctic. Bei-Bienko (1950) listed the\r\nfollowing 10 species as sinanthropes in the Palearctic zone: _Blatta\r\nlateralis_, _B. orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_, _Leucophaea\r\nmaderae_, _Periplaneta americana_, _P. australasiae_, _Polyphaga\r\nsaussurei_, _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, and _Supella supellectilium_. In\r\nthe warmer parts of the temperate regions, as in their native Tropics,\r\ncertain domiciliary species breed outdoors as well as indoors. In the\r\nless temperate extensions of their ranges most domiciliary species are\r\nnearly always found indoors. In regions with low winter temperatures\r\nthese cockroaches do not survive in unheated structures; but in heated\r\nbuildings _Blattella germanica_, for example, has been able to withstand\r\nthe rigorous climate of Alaska, where it has caused severe infestations\r\n(Chamberlin, 1949).\r\n\r\nThe limiting factors that determine whether man-made structures will\r\nprovide suitable habitats for cockroaches are favorable temperature and\r\navailability of water and food. The range of temperatures that man\r\nprovides for his own comfort and protection fosters the rapid increase\r\nof cockroach populations indoors. Gunn (1934, 1935) has demonstrated\r\nthat the preferred temperature range (zone of indifference) of _Blatta\r\norientalis_ is 20-29° C. The upper limit of the preferred temperature of\r\n_Blattella germanica_ and _Periplaneta americana_ is 33° C. (Gunn,\r\n1935). The lower limits of temperature tolerance were not sharply\r\ndefined in Gunn's work. However, less than optimum temperatures, if they\r\nlast for only short periods, are not necessarily lethal. The 24-hour\r\nmortality for _P. americana_ that had been held for one hour at 0° C.\r\nwas only 2±2 percent (Knipling and Sullivan, 1957). Gunn (1934) observed\r\nthat _Blatta orientalis_ would not settle at temperatures above 33° C.\r\nand would react violently against higher temperatures (e.g., 39° C.) by\r\nrunning away; thus the thermotactic behavior of cockroaches might be\r\npresumed to bring them into favorable environments within structures.\r\nThermal death points have been determined for the above three species by\r\nGunn and Notley (1936).\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge among those who rear cockroaches experimentally\r\nthat, unless the water content of the food is high, fluid water is\r\nessential in the insects' dietary. Ten species of domiciliary\r\ncockroaches have been shown to be unable to survive as long on dry food\r\nalone as they could on food and water at 36-40 percent relative\r\nhumidity (Willis and Lewis, 1957). _Blatta orientalis_, when in a state\r\nof normal water balance, usually spent more time in the drier part of a\r\nhumidity gradient; but desiccated insects tended to become hygropositive\r\n(Gunn and Cosway, 1938). We presume that other domiciliary species\r\nbehave similarly. If water is available nearby, it may be presumed that\r\npartially desiccated cockroaches could locate a source through the\r\nmediation of a humidity sense. Hygroreceptors have been demonstrated on\r\nthe antennae of _Blattella germanica_ (Roth and Willis, 1952a) and\r\nsuggested for _Blatta orientalis_ (Gunn and Cosway, 1938).\r\n\r\nDrinking water is available to cockroaches in the traps of sinks, wash\r\nbasins, tubs, and toilet bowls; in flush tanks; as condensation on cold\r\npipes, flush tanks, and windows; around leaking pipes and faucets; as\r\nspillage; in miscellaneous water-filled containers, such as pet drinking\r\ndishes, aquaria, vases; empty beverage bottles; and drainage from ice\r\nboxes. Soft, juicy fruits and vegetables can provide both moisture and\r\nfood. There seems to be a tendency for certain species (_Blatta\r\norientalis_ and _Blattella germanica_) to become established in the more\r\nhumid parts of structures, such as basements, around sinks, and in\r\nbathrooms. Whether this is a reaction to a preferred humidity or merely\r\na fortuitous aggregation near sources of drinking water and food has\r\nnever been clearly demonstrated. The rather widespread dissemination of\r\nthese species into zones of low as well as high humidity suggests that\r\ndetailed studies of the microclimatic conditions of structural\r\nmicrohabitats will be needed before meaningful conclusions can be drawn\r\nabout the stratification of cockroaches within structures according to\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all structures infested by cockroaches, food of some kind is\r\navailable, either in the structure itself or nearby. This may be the\r\nfood stored by man for his own use or the use of kept animals; it may be\r\ncrumbs, food spillage, garbage, or excreta; glues and pastes on cartons,\r\nboxes, stamps, envelopes, labels, and wall paper; sizing on cloth and\r\nbook covers; various dried animal and plant products; dead insects;\r\nliving plants; etc. In fact, it is almost impossible, despite good\r\nhousekeeping, to keep any structure used by man free of all food\r\nsuitable for cockroaches.\r\n\r\nThat the requisite temperature, water, and food are provided, more or\r\nless adequately, by a variety of structures is attested by the\r\ninnumerable infestations of cockroaches that develop when control\r\nmeasures are relaxed. Within structures the accessibility of certain\r\nharborages to cockroaches probably depends on the habits of the species\r\nand to some extent on their size. Similar types of harborages in\r\ndifferent structures may be used by the same species, although there\r\nseems to be some overlapping by different species into the same kinds of\r\ndaytime shelters. The comparative ecology of domiciliary cockroaches has\r\nnot been thoroughly investigated, so any interpretation of observational\r\ndata is necessarily speculative and inconclusive at this time. Our\r\ndiscussion on pages 324 to 343 is also pertinent to this section.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND-BASED STRUCTURES\r\n\r\nDwellings provide a variety of microhabitats that are acceptable to\r\ncockroaches. It has been stated that old houses, or houses that have\r\nmany cracks and crevices, or have basement kitchens that are not kept\r\nclean and in good repair are particularly liable to invasion by\r\ncockroaches (Laing, 1946; British Museum [Nat. Hist.], 1951). Although\r\nthis statement is undoubtedly true, it has been our personal experience,\r\nas well as the experience of others, that new, clean, and well-planned\r\nhouses and apartments are also easily and sometimes quickly invaded by\r\ncockroaches. Mallis (1954) has cited the following places that are\r\nfrequently infested by cockroaches in homes. In the kitchen, cockroaches\r\nare found in and around sinks, in cupboards above and below sinks, under\r\ntables and chairs, in stoves, around breadboards, in utility cabinets,\r\nin kitchen closets, under linoleum, behind, under, and inside\r\nrefrigerators and iceboxes. In living rooms cockroaches are found in\r\nfurniture, studio couches, sewing machines, closets, and bookshelves;\r\nbehind picture frames, pennants, calendars, and other wall ornaments. In\r\nbathrooms cockroaches are found in and behind utility cabinets and\r\ntoilets; they may be found in wicker clothes hampers, in brooms and\r\nmops, and in door hinges. Ordinarily, cockroaches are not found in\r\nbedrooms unless they are abundant elsewhere in the dwelling. Additional\r\nharborages are cited under specific cockroaches in the list below.\r\n\r\nIn markets DeLong (1948) found the German cockroach in bags of potatoes\r\nand onions, in crates of citrus fruits, in pads and shredded papers in\r\nbanana boxes, and in cases of bottled beverages. The insects were\r\nattracted by coffee and crawled into the folds of coffee bags. They were\r\nfound in cartons of canned goods; in bread and baked goods; in cartons\r\nof packaged cookies, cakes, and crackers. Packaged cereals were\r\nattractive, and cockroaches were sometimes found in packages of\r\ncigarettes. The insects occurred in scales (by the hundreds) and in cash\r\nregisters. Rather heavy infestations were found under stainless-steel\r\ncappings that covered wooden arms on the fish cleaning stand. The\r\ninsects were numerous in display cases where they were warm and\r\nsheltered. They were also found behind mirrors above produce racks, in\r\nelectrical switch boxes and conduits, and in telephone boxes, as well as\r\ngenerally in cracks and behind loose moldings or loose wall boards.\r\nEnclosed boxlike tables were frequently heavily infested.\r\n\r\nIn restaurants cockroaches may be found in the following places:\r\nCrevices in wood, plaster, concrete, and metal; in the bar; in the\r\nkitchen and in the associated equipment; in cupboards, lavatories, and\r\ngarbage storage areas; and on the undersides of chairs and tables\r\n(Mallis, 1954).\r\n\r\nIn drug stores Frings (1948) found cockroaches behind the mirror and\r\nbetween the sink and the cooler. Thousands were found in hollow\r\nornamental shelf edging. The hollow bases of malted-milk dispensers and\r\ndrink mixers were cockroach havens.\r\n\r\nIn a hospital Frings (1948) found cockroaches in decorative trim around\r\ndoorways, by the thousands in wicker laundry baskets, and in incubators\r\nfor premature babies. In military hospitals we have seen cockroaches\r\n(_Blattella germanica_) in kitchens and dining halls in the usual hiding\r\nplaces mentioned above and on the undersides of stainless-steel serving\r\ntables.\r\n\r\nIn department stores cockroaches have been found in food departments,\r\nbeauty salons, rest rooms, dressing rooms, linen departments, and\r\nstationery departments (Anonymous, 1952). The infestation in the linen\r\ndepartment was traced to clean towels which, when returned from the\r\nlaundry, contained at least 500 cockroaches per bundle. The insects were\r\ncarried into the rest rooms and beauty salon when the towels were\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nThe microhabitats of cockroaches in privies and sewers have not been\r\nstudied. These habitats are particularly important in view of the\r\ndemonstrated migrations of cockroaches from sewers into dwellings and\r\nthe possible dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms from feces to\r\nfood. The reader is referred to our 1957(a) paper for a summary of the\r\nknown information on cockroach dispersal from sewers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCKROACHES ASSOCIATED WITH LAND-BASED STRUCTURES\r\n\r\nMost of the cockroaches listed below are either known domiciliary\r\nspecies or they have been found one or more times in houses or other\r\nman-made structures. The known structural pests breed within the\r\nbuilding. Certain other species, which have been observed only\r\ninfrequently in structures and are not known to breed there, may\r\npossibly be incipient pests; these latter species may attain future\r\neconomic importance if they establish breeding colonies within a\r\nstructure. A few species have undoubtedly wandered indoors by accident.\r\nIt is difficult to decide whether a particular species was an accidental\r\ninvader or whether it was attracted indoors in response to some\r\nstimulus. Only additional information will provide the desired answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aglaopteryx ypsilon=\r\n\r\n_Trinidad._--Male found indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Allacta similis=\r\n\r\n_Hawaii._--Found only indoors at Nauhi. Otherwise this is apparently an\r\noutdoor species (Swezey and Williams, 1932).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blaberus craniifer=\r\n\r\n_Cuba._--Household pest (Deschapelles, 1939). Particularly abundant in\r\nhouses in Santiago and Havana (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).\r\n\r\n_Florida._--Under boards in woodshed (Rehn and Hebard, 1912, 1914).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blaberus discoidalis=\r\n\r\n_Ecuador._--In eating places (Campos R., 1926).\r\n\r\n_Hispaniola._--In houses (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).\r\n\r\n_New Jersey._--In greenhouse (Weiss, 1917).\r\n\r\n_Puerto Rico._--In homes (Seín, 1923). In fruit stores (Wolcott, 1950).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blatta lateralis=\r\n\r\n_Central Asia._--Household pest, often found in homes with clay floors\r\n(Bei-Bienko, 1950).\r\n\r\n_Turkmen S.S.R._--Males and females occurred in dwellings (Vlasov,\r\n1929).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blatta orientalis=\r\n\r\nThis species is a cosmopolitan domiciliary pest (Hebard, 1917; Rehn,\r\n1945). It is reported to occur particularly in basements and crawl\r\nspaces under basementless houses (Mallis, 1954). In damp basements where\r\nfood is available large colonies are not unusual, but it also may infest\r\noffices and apartments several floors off the ground (Gould and Deay,\r\n1940). The number encountered on upper floors is seldom large, but the\r\nfrequency of occurrence may reach 30 percent of the observations (Spear\r\net al., _in_ Shuyler, 1956). In supermarkets this species hides during\r\nthe day inside concrete blocks or cracks in the foundation, under\r\nfurniture, or behind cartons; it is conspicuous on the floors of the\r\nmarkets at night (De Long, 1948). In Great Britain the kitchen is\r\npreferred by this pest (and by _Blattella germanica_); they shelter\r\nbeneath steam radiators and gas stoves, behind hot-water pipes,\r\nunderneath furniture and floor coverings, sinks and baths; basements and\r\nunderground kitchens are especially likely to be infested (Laing, 1946;\r\nBritish Museum [Nat. Hist.], 1951). Goodliffe (1958) noted that _B.\r\norientalis_ may travel long distances to find food.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blattella germanica=\r\n\r\nThis species is a cosmopolitan domiciliary pest (Hebard, 1917; Rehn,\r\n1945). It is one of the commonest insects in homes and restaurants\r\n(Gould and Deay, 1940). It is found in kitchens, larders, bathrooms,\r\nfurnace rooms, and storage rooms of bakeries, breweries, hospitals,\r\nbarracks, as well as dwellings, where, during daylight, it hides behind\r\ncupboards, furniture, hanging pictures, panels and skirting boards, in\r\ncracks around drains, water pipes, electric wires, and hot-water and\r\nsteam heating units (Wille, 1920). The German cockroach may be found in\r\ncracks around baseboards, pipes, conduits, sinks, and drawers; behind\r\ncabinets; inside switch boxes and refrigerators; on under surfaces of\r\ntables, chairs, and shelves; between stacks of stored goods, and in\r\nalmost every place that is not readily observed (Kruse, 1948). We have\r\nalso seen this species packed in electric-clock cases and loud-speaker\r\nbaffles, in cash registers, and clinging to the undersurface of\r\nstainless-steel steam tables. The infestation of markets by this species\r\nhas been described above. Very narrow cracks provide refuges for the\r\nGerman cockroach. Wille (1920) found first-instar nymphs in cracks 0.5\r\nmm. wide and adult males and females without oöthecae in cracks 1.6 mm.\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nShuyler (1956) has observed extensions into relatively new structural\r\nhabitats by _Blattella germanica_ in the north-central area of the\r\nUnited States. A few German cockroaches are now being encountered in\r\nliving rooms, bedrooms, clothes closets, bedroom furniture, lobbies,\r\nentrance halls, checkrooms, nonfood storerooms, nonfood warehouses, and\r\ncoin-vending machine repair shops. In these situations this species is\r\nbehaving much like the brown-banded cockroach, _Supella supellectilium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blattella schubotzi=\r\n\r\n_Cameroon._--Five specimens in a house (Princis, 1955).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blattella vaga=\r\n\r\n_U.S.A._--Although this is mostly an outdoor species, during dry seasons\r\nit may temporarily enter houses in great numbers, occasionally breeding\r\nindoors in Arizona (Flock, 1941a). Two adults were collected indoors in\r\nTexas (Riherd, 1953).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chromatonotus notatus=\r\n\r\n_Trinidad._--A male was found indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cutilia soror=\r\n\r\n_Hawaii._--Almost as common in houses as _Neostylopyga rhombifolia_\r\n(Hebard, 1922).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ectobius duskei=\r\n\r\n_U.S.S.R._--Frequently occurs in living apartments in farming localities\r\nas an accidental inhabitant (Bei-Bienko, 1950).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ectobius pallidus=\r\n\r\n_Massachusetts._--A summertime pest in houses along coast (Gurney, 1953;\r\nE. R. Willis, personal observation). Generally an outdoor species.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Epilampra abdomen-nigrum=\r\n\r\n_Trinidad._--Male, indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955). An outdoor species\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ergaula capensis=\r\n\r\n_Cameroon._--A male taken in a house (Princis, 1955).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eublaberus posticus=\r\n\r\n_Trinidad._--Indoors, feeding on bat feces (Princis and Kevan, 1955).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eurycotis floridana=\r\n\r\n_Florida._--Occasionally found in homes (Creighton, 1954; Roth and\r\nWillis, 1954a).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Euthyrrhapha pacifica=\r\n\r\n_Hawaii._--Found outdoors and indoors where it breeds in neglected\r\ncupboards and in rubbish (Fullaway and Krauss, 1945).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Holocompsa azteca=\r\n\r\n_Mexico._--Household pest (Ball et al., 1942).\r\n\r\n=Holocompsa cyanea=\r\n\r\n_Costa Rica._--One specimen in house (Rehn, 1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Holocompsa nitidula=\r\n\r\nApparently domiciliary in American Tropics (Hebard, 1917). In houses\r\nunder chests, etc., Cuba (Gundlach, 1890-1891); Puerto Rico (Gundlach,\r\n1887). In folds of burlap bag, Florida (Rehn and Hebard, 1914).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ischnoptera rufa occidentalis=\r\n\r\n_Panama._--Thrives about human habitations under litter, though not\r\ndomiciliary (Hebard, 1920).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ischnoptera rufa rufa=\r\n\r\n_Jamaica._--In hotel. \"While hardly a domiciliary form it would seem to\r\nfrequent environments where man has considerably disturbed natural\r\nconditions, as under debris, docks, under logs and stones in cultivated\r\nareas\" (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leucophaea maderae=\r\n\r\n_West Indies._--In habitations, warehouses, and other structures; \"At\r\ntimes it is a very abundant and serious pest\" (Rehn, 1945). In Puerto\r\nRico it was also found in fruit stores, markets, and inns (Seín, 1923;\r\nWolcott, 1950).\r\n\r\nReported as a domiciliary pest in Madeira (Heer, 1864); Windward Islands\r\n(Marshall, 1878); Tropics and sub-Tropics (Rehn, 1937); Philippine\r\nIslands (Uichanco, 1953); New York City (Anonymous, 1953; Gurney, 1953);\r\nTrinidad (Princis and Kevan, 1955). This species is also established in\r\ncoastal Brazil, Central America, all the Greater Antilles, several other\r\ntropical islands, and tropical Africa, where it probably originated\r\n(Rehn, 1945).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leurolestes circumvagans=\r\n\r\n_Hispaniola, Grenada._--Largely domiciliary (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leurolestes pallidus=\r\n\r\n_Cuba._--All over island, in houses, under lockers, etc. (Rehn, 1945;\r\nGundlach, 1890-1891).\r\n\r\n_Florida._--Rehn and Hebard (1914).\r\n\r\nThis species has been recorded from various islands in the West Indies,\r\nfrom Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil (Rehn, 1945).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Methana marginalis=\r\n\r\n_Australia._--Reported entering houses (Pope, 1953a).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nauphoeta cinerea=\r\n\r\n_Australia._--In hospital (Mackerras and Mackerras, 1948). In dwellings,\r\ngrain stores, and fowl-feeding pens (Pope, 1953).\r\n\r\n_Sudan._--Domiciliary in huts of the Shilluk natives; fairly widely\r\ndistributed in eastern Africa (Rehn, 1945).\r\n\r\n_Hawaii._--In feed rooms of poultry plants (Illingworth, 1942).\r\n\r\n_Florida._--Established in feed mills around Tampa (Gresham, 1952;\r\nGurney, 1953).\r\n\r\nThe wide distribution of this species from East Africa, where it\r\noriginated, to the Orient and the New World was undoubtedly mediated by\r\nshipping (Rehn, 1945).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Neoblattella= sp.\r\n\r\n_Puerto Rico._--Observed [as _Blatta caraibea_, Rehn and Hebard (1927)]\r\nin houses (Gundlach, 1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Neostylopyga rhombifolia=\r\n\r\nDomiciliary in Indo-Malaya and New World Tropics (Rehn, 1945);\r\nPhilippine Islands (Uichanco, 1953); and Hawaii (Hebard, 1922).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oxyhaloa buprestoides=\r\n\r\nPresumably to some extent domiciliary, as it evidently spread from\r\nAfrica to the New World via slave ships (Rehn and Hebard, 1927; Rehn,\r\n1945).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Panchlora nivea=\r\n\r\n_Colombia._--A male and a female taken in a dwelling (Princis, 1946).\r\nThis is primarily an outdoor species which is frequently taken indoors\r\nas an adventive on bananas (see p. 150 for references).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parcoblatta fulvescens=\r\n\r\n_Florida._--Males found in laboratory and dormitory buildings,\r\nostensibly attracted by lights (Friauf, 1953).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parcoblatta lata=\r\n\r\n_Connecticut._--Domiciliary pest (Moore, 1957). Generally an outdoor\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parcoblatta notha=\r\n\r\n_Arizona._--It may occasionally be a nuisance in houses (Ball et al.,\r\n1942).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parcoblatta pensylvanica=\r\n\r\n_U.S.A._--Country houses often badly infested, Indiana (Blatchley,\r\n1920). Frequently taken in houses in wooded areas, Michigan (Hubbell,\r\n1922). Infestation by males, females, and nymphs on fourth floor of\r\nbuilding, South Dakota (Severin, 1952). Houses in wooded areas infested\r\nby nymphs and occasionally by adults (Gould and Deay, 1940).\r\n\r\n_Canada._--Pest in summer cottages in Ontario (Walker, 1912).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Periplaneta americana=\r\n\r\nThis is a cosmopolitan domiciliary pest (Hebard, 1917; Rehn, 1945). It\r\nis common in restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and where food is\r\nprepared or stored; it was trapped regularly in the basement and upper\r\nfloors of store buildings, and it was also found in all heated parts of\r\nan old meat-packing plant (Gould and Deay, 1938). _P. americana_ was\r\nnumerous in latrines in Iran (Bei-Bienko, 1950) and in privies in Texas\r\n(Dow, 1955) and Georgia (Haines and Palmer, 1955). Large numbers of this\r\nspecies also occur in sewers adjacent to human habitations (Roth and\r\nWillis, 1957a).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Periplaneta australasiae=\r\n\r\nGenerally domiciliary, but also occurs outdoors in the West Indies (Rehn\r\nand Hebard, 1927). It is a very abundant domiciliary pest in tropical\r\nAfrica and tropical America (Rehn, 1945); Ecuador (Campos R., 1926);\r\nPuerto Rico (Sein, 1923); Philippine Islands (Uichanco, 1953); Australia\r\n(Pope, 1953).\r\n\r\nAlso occurs as a pest in greenhouses in Pennsylvania (Thilow and Riley,\r\n1891); France (Giard, 1900); Italy (Boettger, 1930); Great Britain\r\n(Laing, 1946; British Museum [Nat. Hist.], 1951).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Periplaneta brunnea=\r\n\r\nCircumtropical domiciliary pest which is apparently more nearly peculiar\r\nto the Tropics and adjacent regions than _P. americana_ (Hebard, 1917).\r\nThis species has been trapped in significant numbers in privies and\r\ndwellings in Georgia (Haines and Palmer, 1955). It is the species of\r\n_Periplaneta_ present in homes in San Antonio, Texas (Mallis, 1954).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Periplaneta fuliginosa=\r\n\r\n_U.S.A._--Frequently encountered out of doors, but has been reported\r\ncommon after dark about a hotel in Alabama and was captured in a house\r\nin Louisiana; it was also extremely abundant on the wharves at night in\r\nJacksonville, Florida (Hebard, 1917). As a domiciliary pest it was, next\r\nto _Blattella germanica_, the most common cockroach inside homes in\r\nsouthwest Georgia, where it was also the most common cockroach in\r\nprivies (Haines and Palmer, 1955). This species has become a very common\r\ndomiciliary pest in Texas (Eads, personal communication, 1955). It\r\ninfested a greenhouse for five years in Indiana (Gould and Deay, 1940).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Periplaneta ignota=\r\n\r\n_Australia._--It occurs in dwellings occasionally (Pope, 1953).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Phaetalia pallida=\r\n\r\n_Colombia._--Three specimens from three dwellings (Princis, 1946).\r\n\r\n_Trinidad._--Male indoors; male and female at light (Princis and Kevan,\r\n1955).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plectoptera dorsalis=\r\n\r\n_Puerto Rico._--According to Gundlach (1887) it enters houses at night\r\nattracted by light (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Polyphaga aegyptiaca=\r\n\r\n_Iraq._--Common in houses (Weber, 1954).\r\n\r\n_Caucasus._--Winged male in kitchen (Burr, 1913).\r\n\r\n_U.S.S.R._--Listed as a sinanthrope (Bei-Bienko, 1950).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Polyphaga saussurei=\r\n\r\n_South-central Asia._--One of the commonest domiciliary species\r\n(Bei-Bienko, 1950).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pseudophoraspis nebulosa=\r\n\r\n_East Indies._--This species is sometimes difficult indoors (Karny,\r\n1925).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pycnoscelus surinamensis=\r\n\r\nA household pest in the East Indies (Karny, 1925); Philippine Islands\r\n(Uichanco, 1953); Tanganyika (Smith, 1955); Trinidad, eight records\r\nindoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955). It is also a greenhouse pest (Hebard,\r\n1917; Zappe, 1918; Doucette and Smith, 1926; Saupe, 1928; Roeser,\r\n1940). Common in or around chicken batteries and yards in Hawaii\r\n(Schwabe, 1949).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Supella supellectilium=\r\n\r\nDomiciliary wherever distributed (Rehn, 1945), this species is\r\nespecially difficult to control because of its apparently nonselective\r\ndispersal throughout dwellings. For example, Mallis (1954) observed in\r\nTexas that it was widely distributed throughout the apartment and was\r\nprobably the most common cockroach seen in the bedroom; its favorite\r\nharborages were beneath and behind corner braces on kitchen chairs,\r\nunderneath tables, behind pictures and other objects on walls, and in\r\nshower stalls; its oöthecae were commonly fastened on walls and ceilings\r\nthroughout the house. Gould and Deay (1940) reported that this species\r\nprefers high locations, such as shelves in closets, behind pictures, and\r\npicture molding; oöthecae were found about kitchen sink, desks, tables,\r\nand other furniture, and even in bedding. Hafez and Afifi (1956) stated\r\nthat the adult wanders in nearly all rooms of the house and only visits\r\nthe kitchen when searching for food; it hides in cupboards, pantries,\r\nclosets, bookshelves, drawers, and behind picture frames; the nymphs\r\nnormally hide in the corners of drawers, behind frames, and in similar\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Symploce bicolor=\r\n\r\n_Puerto Rico._--In houses, Sardinera Beach, Mona Island (Ramos, 1946).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Symploce hospes=\r\n\r\n_North American Tropics._--Domiciliary, but not exclusively so, and\r\napparently widely distributed (Hebard, 1917). In Florida, as\r\n_Ischnoptera rufescens_, found in a greasy cupboard (Rehn and Hebard,\r\n1914).\r\n\r\n_Hawaii._--Illingworth (1915).\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPS\r\n\r\nSailing ships have long been notorious for their unwelcome hordes of\r\ncockroaches, and it was by ship that at least 11 domiciliary species\r\nmigrated from their centers of origin to other parts of the world (Rehn,\r\n1945). Over 40 nondomiciliary species have been carried by ship from the\r\nAmerican Tropics to other parts of the world in cargoes of bananas (p.\r\n146). In addition to these, other adventive cockroaches appear from time\r\nto time in ports to which they have been carried by ships. Yet by far\r\nthe most numerous cockroaches on shipboard are the breeding populations\r\nof a few common domiciliary pests. Except in the most rigorously\r\ndisinsectized ships, this commerce in cockroaches has continued to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nCockroaches undoubtedly infested the first ships that sailed the\r\nMediterranean; of these we have no records. The earliest recognizable\r\nrecord of cockroaches on shipboard is Moffett's (1634) statement that\r\nwhen Drake captured the ship _Philip_, he found it overrun with\r\ncockroaches [_Blattarum alatarum_]. Bligh (1792) described disinfesting\r\nH.M.S. _Bounty_ with boiling water to kill cockroaches. Chamisso (1829)\r\nreported that he had seen ships casks, in which rice or grain had been\r\nstored, that were found to be filled with _Blattella germanica_ when\r\nopened. During a voyage from England to Van Diemen's Land, Lewis (1836)\r\nwas greatly annoyed by hundreds of cockroaches flying about his cabin at\r\nnight; the most numerous resembled _Periplaneta americana_ and another\r\nwas similar to _Ectobius lapponicus_. This latter was undoubtedly _B.\r\ngermanica_, which is the only ship-infesting species that resembles the\r\nferal _E. lapponicus_. Lewis continued, _P. americana_ \"were in immense\r\nprofusion, and had communication with every part of the ship, between\r\nthe timbers or skin. The ravages they committed on everything edible\r\nwere very extensive; not a biscuit but was more or less polluted by\r\nthem, and amongst the cargo 300 cases of cheeses, which had holes in\r\nthem to prevent their sweating, were considerably damaged, some of them\r\nbeing half devoured and not one without some marks of their residence.\"\r\n\r\nKingsley (1870), Kellogg (1908), Gates (1912), Heiser (1936), and\r\nBronson (1943) have all reported that cockroaches were so numerous on\r\nships that they gnawed the skin and nails of the men on board. These are\r\nall independent observations of what may well have been a common\r\noccurrence on ships. We have discussed in detail the subject of\r\ncockroaches biting man in our 1957(a) paper.\r\n\r\nMosely (1892) reported, \"At the time that England was left the ship\r\n[H.M.S. _Challenger_] seemed nearly free of animals, other than men,\r\ndogs, and livestock required for food. The first cockroaches apparently\r\ncame on board at St. Vincent, Cape Verdes.... Cockroaches soon became\r\nplentiful on board, and showed themselves whenever the ship was in a\r\nwarm climate.\r\n\r\n\"At one period of the voyage, a number of these insects established\r\nthemselves in my cabin, and devoured parts of my boots, nibbling off all\r\nthe margins of leather projecting beyond the seams on the upper\r\nleathers.\"\r\n\r\nSir Edmund Freemantle (1904) recalled some of his experiences in the\r\nBritish Navy. \"Cockroaches in the tropics were also terrible scourges.\r\nOne saw little of them in fine, dry weather, but in damp, wet weather\r\nthey seemed to come from every hidden corner ... our remedy in the\r\n'Spartan' was to make the boys catch them--on pain of being caned....\r\nOne brig, the 'Lily,' was so overrun by cockroaches that the officers'\r\nclothes smelt of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe quotation from Sonan (1924) on page 348 describes similar conditions\r\nin the Japanese Navy.\r\n\r\nOn modern cargo ships cockroaches are reported to be extremely numerous\r\nin the galley, the crew's quarters, and sometimes in the holds; they\r\ndwell in hot, humid environments such as the casing around steam pipes\r\n(Monro, 1951). Williams (1931) reported that _Blattella germanica_ was\r\nthe most important cockroach pest on ships seen at New York. Although\r\noften numerous in the holds, the cockroaches as a rule congregated in\r\nliving quarters. They were also frequently found between tarpaulins\r\ncovering the hatches. It was not unusual to kill 20,000 to 50,000 in the\r\nforecastle, and more than 20,000 have been taken from a single\r\nstateroom. Simanton (1946) inspected the S.S. _William Kieth_ when it\r\nberthed at San Francisco from a 10-month voyage to the South Pacific.\r\nThe holds were infested with thousands of _Periplaneta americana_, but\r\nin the crew's quarters, mess halls, and storerooms _B. germanica_\r\npredominated. After insecticidal treatment about 2,000 _P. americana_\r\nwere seen in each hold and as many as 24 _B. germanica_ in each cabin.\r\nRichardson (1947) reported that in Army transports inspected between\r\n1943 and 1946 at New York, _P. americana_ was found in the galleys and\r\nmesses, and occasionally heavy infestations were found deep in the\r\nholds; _B. germanica_ was found in the galleys and messes; _Blatta\r\norientalis_ was found only in the hold.\r\n\r\nAdditional references indicating the presence of _Blattella germanica_\r\non ships may be found in the account of its parasite _Ripidius\r\npectinicornis_ (p. 232). Although Rice (1925) and Williams (1931) cite\r\n_B. germanica_ as the most numerous cockroach on ships, Brooke (1920)\r\nstated that the great majority of ship cockroaches were _Periplaneta\r\namericana_. In addition to citing cockroach infestations on ships, the\r\nfollowing authors reported various methods for disinfecting ships:\r\nCanalis (1916), Pryor (1918), Brooke (1920), Rice (1925), Williams\r\n(1931), Simanton (1946), Richardson (1947), and Anonymous (1951, 1954).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCKROACHES ASSOCIATED WITH SHIPS\r\n\r\nIn the following list we include some previously unpublished data on\r\ncockroaches that were recovered from ships at the Miami, Fla.,\r\nQuarantine Station for the periods November 1945 through May 1946; May,\r\nJune, August, and September 1950; and 17 July 1957 (Porter, personal\r\ncommunication, 1958). These data were lumped, without breakdown to\r\nspecies, under the entry Orthoptera in Porter (1958).\r\n\r\nCertain of the species listed below occur only accidentally on shipboard\r\nand will probably never establish breeding colonies on ships or become\r\npests on shipboard or elsewhere; some were merely passengers between one\r\nland-based colony and another.

However, Dethier (1945) found no cockroaches in dismantled\r\nor wrecked wing and tail structures of metal aircraft in central Africa.\r\nIn fact, all-metal aircraft would seem to provide little in the way of\r\nfood or water for stowaway cockroaches.\r\n\r\nLaird (1951, 1952, 1956a) found living specimens of _Blattella\r\ngermanica_, _Periplaneta americana_, and _Periplaneta australasiae_ in\r\nbaggage compartments and/or kitchens in aircraft.

CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAsano (1937) classified the natural enemies of cockroaches into two\r\ntypes as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. Enemies that feed mainly on cockroaches (certain ripiphorid\r\n        beetles and certain chalcid, evaniid, and ampulicid wasps).\r\n\r\n     2. Organisms which, in their search for food, devour cockroaches\r\n        that may be encountered (certain species of scorpions, spiders,\r\n        ticks, centipedes, Strepsiptera, ants, birds, rats, and\r\n        \"parasitic bacteria\").\r\n\r\nCameron (1955) arranged the associates of cockroaches in two groups as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Group A. Parasites and predators.\r\n\r\n       1. Parasites: Hymenoptera (Evaniidae, Eulophidae, Eupelmidae,\r\n            Encyrtidae, Pteromalidae, Cleonymidae) and Coleoptera\r\n            (Ripiphoridae).\r\n\r\n       2. Predators: Hymenoptera (Ampulicidae), Hemiptera (Reduviidae),\r\n            Coleoptera (Dermestidae), Arachnida (Araneae, Acarina).\r\n\r\n     Group B. Parasites and symbionts.\r\n\r\n       1. Protozoa (including examples of both parasites and\r\n            commensals).\r\n\r\n       2. Nematoda (including both primary \"parasites\" and secondary\r\n            parasites).\r\n\r\n       3. Bacteria (including the mutualistic bacteroids).\r\n\r\n       4. Algae [_Arthromitis_ (= _Hygrocrocis_) _intestinalis_; see p.\r\n            124].\r\n\r\nAsano's arrangement, although essentially true, is limited; Cameron's\r\nsystem is divided into arthropods (group A) and lower forms (group B),\r\nbut does not include higher animals. Both attempts at classification\r\nneed amplification; this we have endeavored to do below.\r\n\r\nIn classifying the biotic associates of cockroaches, we were immediately\r\nconfronted with a problem in semantics. The concepts parasitism,\r\npredatism, and symbiosis have all been used with various shades of\r\nmeaning by different authors. The problem is not solved merely by\r\naccepting as authoritative specific definitions, however apt they seem\r\nto be, because, unfortunately, these concepts are not mutually\r\nexclusive. For example, among the entomophagous insects, as Sweetman\r\n(1936) has pointed out, there can be no definite line of separation\r\nbetween parasitism and predatism: the two intergrade, only the extremes\r\nbeing quite distinct. In fact, Andrewartha and Birch (1954) generalized\r\nthese relationships by calling both categories predatism. These authors\r\ndivided natural populations of associated organisms into nonpredators\r\nand predators. Although this simplifies their presentation of the\r\ngeneral principles of ecology, for our purpose more narrowly defined\r\nterms have proved useful.\r\n\r\nIn the main we have followed Sweetman (1936) and Allee et al. (1949) in\r\narriving at the following definitions:\r\n\r\n=Symbiosis= is the living together in more or less intimate association\r\nof organisms of different species; it includes virtually all\r\nrelationships between cockroaches and other organisms, such as\r\nparasitism, predatism, commensalism, and mutualism. Allee et al. (1949)\r\napparently do not include predatism in symbiosis.\r\n\r\n=Mutualism= is symbiosis in which both members benefit by the\r\nassociation. The smaller partner has commonly been called a symbiont or\r\nsymbiote by authors.\r\n\r\n=Commensalism= includes associations in which neither party appears to\r\nbenefit or be harmed. One partner may live on the surplus food or wastes\r\nof the other; shelter and transport may be involved.\r\n\r\n=Parasitism= is the state of symbiosis in which one of the members feeds\r\nupon the other during the whole of either the immature or mature feeding\r\nstage; the host is harmed in some way and may be killed.\r\n\r\n=Predatism= is an association in which one member attacks and feeds\r\nupon, or stores as food for its progeny, one or more other organisms;\r\nthe predator spends less than the immature or mature feeding period on\r\nthe prey. This category includes a few invertebrates and all the\r\nvertebrates that capture, kill, and feed on cockroaches. This\r\nassociation may be divided into interspecies predatism, in which the\r\npredator preys upon a different species, and intraspecies predatism\r\n(cannibalism) in which the predator preys upon its own species.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have attempted to adhere to these definitions throughout\r\nthis discussion, we realize that in doing so we may have tended to\r\noversimplify complex relations. Some questionable interpretations stem\r\nfrom insufficient knowledge of the basic relationships between\r\ncockroaches and their associates. Only further study will clarify these\r\nrelationships. Some of the problems are discussed below.\r\n\r\nProbably many of the so-called parasites (e.g., Protozoa like\r\n_Nyctotherus_, and intestinal nematodes of the family Thelastomatidae),\r\nwhich do not invade the host's tissues and seem to have no effect on the\r\nactivity and vitality of the host, are commensals. Although we consider\r\nthese forms to be commensals, we realize that they might actually affect\r\nthe host in some way even though this has not been shown. It is possible\r\nthat Rothschild and Clay's (1957) statement about bird parasites may\r\nwell apply to the apparently harmless organisms found in the cockroach.\r\nThese authors wrote, \"It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the\r\neffect of all types of parasites on the host is detrimental. If we find\r\nthat a bird seems little, if at all, inconvenienced by the presence of\r\nProtozoa or worms or lice, or a cuckoo in the nest, we can nevertheless\r\nassume that it would be better off without them.... Small effects such\r\nas lack of vitality, loss of voice, excessive blinking, or perverted\r\nhabits like dirt eating are extremely difficult to gauge. Nevertheless,\r\nit is only a question of degree. Potentially all parasites are harmful.\"\r\nIt should also be pointed out that some workers would consider certain\r\nof our commensals of cockroaches to be parasites. Thus Faust (1955)\r\nstated that \"A truly successful parasite is one which has developed a\r\nstate of equilibrium with its host, so that no detectable damage is\r\nproduced which endangers the health or life of the host. In a suitable\r\nhost the parasite may obtain food and shelter without any evidence of\r\ntrauma or toxicity. The damage produced may be so slight that repair and\r\nfunctional readjustment keep pace with the injury.\" Faust's successful\r\nparasite would be indistinguishable from a commensal, but there is\r\nundeniably a difference between an organism causing slight, and\r\nundetectable, damage to a host and one causing none. Certain of the\r\norganisms we list as commensals may eventually be shown to be parasites.\r\n\r\nCertain organisms which live in cockroaches appear to have no effect on\r\nthe vitality of the host even though the tissues of the host are\r\ninvaded. Gregarines may penetrate the intestinal wall of the cockroach\r\nwithout seeming to injure the host. Fungi of the genus _Herpomyces_\r\ninvade the cuticle of cockroaches producing pathological changes; yet\r\nthe insects' behavior is apparently unaffected (see p. 129). We consider\r\nthese organisms to be parasites because the host's tissues are invaded\r\nand, as far as we know, no benefit to the host results.\r\n\r\nIn the literature certain insects have been considered to be either\r\nparasites or predators or both. Among these are the ensign wasps\r\n(Evaniidae), whose larvae feed on the eggs of cockroaches within the\r\noötheca, and the ampulicid wasps, which capture, paralyze, and store in\r\ntheir nests (as food for their larvae) nymphs and adults of cockroaches.\r\nClausen (1940) claimed that the evaniid _Zeuxevania splendidula_ is a\r\ntrue egg parasite when it destroys the first egg in a cockroach oötheca;\r\nbut after the wasp larva molts and proceeds to devour the other eggs, he\r\nconsidered it to be a predator. Clausen's definition of an entomophagous\r\nparasite is an insect that in its larval stage develops either\r\ninternally or externally upon a _single_ host which is eventually\r\nkilled; with few exceptions the adults are free-living and their food is\r\nusually different from that of the larvae. A predatory insect, by\r\nClausen's definition, is principally free-living in the larval as well\r\nas adult stage, kills the host immediately by direct attack, and\r\nrequires a number of victims to reach maturity; the predator is of\r\ngreater size than the prey, and the food sources of the adults and\r\nimmature stages are frequently the same.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, as Clausen and other writers have pointed out, that\r\nthere are instances of a particular species showing characteristics\r\nwhich fit both the definitions for predator and parasite. Thus, among\r\nthe evaniids one wasp larva destroys all the eggs in an oötheca, but in\r\nspite of this the larva has more of the characteristics of a parasite\r\nthan of a predator; the adult wasp does not utilize the same food as the\r\nlarva (adults have been taken on flowers and on honeydew from scale\r\ninsects). It is questionable whether the evaniid larva kills the\r\ncockroach egg outright. The wasp larva, being restricted to the inside\r\nof the oötheca, is not free-living. Probably the only criterion by which\r\nthe evaniid could be judged to be a predator, by Clausen's definition,\r\nis that more than a single egg is devoured by the maturing wasp larva.\r\n\r\nAmong the other wasp parasites (Encyrtidae, Eulophidae, Eupelmidae) of\r\ncockroach eggs many individuals develop in a single oötheca. When a\r\nhundred or more wasps emerge from an oötheca which contained less than\r\n20 eggs, it is obvious that a single cockroach egg supported more than\r\none wasp, yet it is possible that one particular wasp larva may have fed\r\nupon more than one cockroach egg before becoming an adult. We consider\r\nall entomophagous wasps that develop in cockroach oöthecae to be\r\nparasites rather than predators.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, even though _Anastatus floridanus_, _A. tenuipes_,\r\nand _Tetrastichus hagenowii_ are egg parasites as larvae, the adult\r\nfemales are, in a sense, predators when they sometimes eat part of the\r\ncockroach egg that oozes through the oviposition puncture (Roth and\r\nWillis, 1954a, 1954b). Williams (1929) has seen the female of _Ampulex\r\ncanaliculata_ imbibe blood that oozed from the cut ends of the\r\ncockroach's antennae after she had clipped them off before leading the\r\nprey to her nest. Yet despite this evident predatism on the part of the\r\nadult, the larva feeds as a parasite on the stored cockroaches in\r\naccordance with Sweetman's (1936) (though not Clausen's 1940) definition\r\nof parasitism, which is \"that form of symbiosis in which one symbiont\r\nlives in or on the host organism and feeds at its expense during the\r\nwhole of either the immature or mature feeding stage.\" The ampulicid\r\nlarva, as the evaniid, is not free-living and does not kill the host\r\nimmediately by direct attack, even though it may require more than one\r\nvictim to reach maturity. Thus, within one individual both parasitic and\r\npredatory behavior are operant during different stages of its life\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWith the above discussion in mind we have summarized below the various\r\nbiotic associations of cockroaches. Only a few examples are given for\r\neach section, but all organisms with similar habits presumably would be\r\nclassified in the same categories.\r\n\r\n  Class A. Associations in which cockroaches serve as hosts, vectors,\r\n           or prey for other organisms.\r\n\r\n    Type I. Obligate associates. Animals and plants that normally\r\n            develop only on or in the cockroach; in general, these\r\n            organisms depend entirely upon the cockroach for survival.\r\n\r\n      Group 1.

MUTUALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTEROIDS\r\n\r\nBlochmann (1887, 1888) discovered intracellular particles (the\r\nbacteroids or symbiotes of authors) that resembled bacteria in the fat\r\nbody of males and females of _Blatta orientalis_ and _Blattella\r\ngermanica_ (pl. 26), in the ova of these insects, and in their embryos.\r\nBacteroids have since been found in at least 25 species and 19 genera of\r\ncockroaches. Presumably such microorganisms are universally distributed\r\nthroughout the Blattaria. General reviews of the bacteroids of\r\ncockroaches and other insects have been published by Glaser (1930b),\r\nSchwartz (1935), Steinhaus (1946, 1949), Buchner (1952, 1953), Brooks\r\n(1954), and Richards and Brooks (1958). The reader is referred to these\r\npapers, and those of authors cited in the list at the end of this\r\nsection, for discussions of the morphology of the bacteroids, their\r\ndistribution within the host, and attempts to culture them in vitro.\r\n\r\nIt has long been assumed, without proof, that cockroaches and their\r\nbacteroids form a mutually beneficial association. As it has not been\r\npossible to cultivate bacteroids apart from their cockroach hosts, it\r\nmay be assumed that the host is essential to the continued existence of\r\nthe microorganism, which also derives from the association other obvious\r\nbenefits as well. Experiments to show that the host also benefits from\r\nthe association have centered around rendering cockroaches bacteroid\r\nfree. Starvation, parasites, electromagnetic radiation, heat or cold, or\r\nchemicals have all been used in attempts to eliminate the bacteroids. Of\r\nthese, only chemical treatment has provided a satisfactory technique.\r\n\r\nFew chemicals other than antibiotics have proved to be useful in the\r\nelimination or reduction of bacteroids. Yetwin (1932) injected various\r\ndilutions of 22 compounds into _Blattella germanica_. He observed\r\ndecreases in the bacteroids of the fat body only following injection of\r\nmethylene blue, but did not pursue this lead further. Gier (_in_\r\nSteinhaus, 1946) observed reduction in the numbers of bacteroids after\r\ncockroaches were injected with crystal violet, hexylresorcinol, or\r\nmetaphen. Bode (1936) reported that injection of irritants such as\r\nlithium salts or quinine hydrochloride had no apparent effect on the\r\nsymbiotes.\r\n\r\nBrooks (1957) reared _Blattella germanica_ on diets containing different\r\nconcentrations of inorganic ions. On a manganese-deficient diet the\r\ncockroaches grew poorly and some of their progeny lacked normal\r\nbacteroids; about 10 percent of the aposymbiotic generation grew and\r\nreproduced on a diet fortified with yeast. Varying the concentrations of\r\nother salts in the diets gave results in which the progeny were either\r\naposymbiotic or the fat body was abnormal but the mycetocytes were\r\nabundant; all these cockroaches soon died even on fortified diets.\r\n\r\nThe administration of certain antibiotic drugs has produced cockroaches\r\nvery nearly free of bacteroids. Brues and Dunn (1945) found that\r\nalthough sulfa drugs had no effect on the bacteroids, penicillin in\r\nlarge doses reduced the number of bacteroids in _Blaberus craniifer_,\r\nbut the cockroaches died within a few days. Death was attributed to lack\r\nof bacteroids rather than effect of the drug; this is perhaps an\r\nunwarranted conclusion in view of the survival of aposymbiotic\r\ncockroaches that have been produced by other drugs (Brooks, 1954; Brooks\r\nand Richards, 1955). Glaser (1946) found that the bacteroids of\r\n_Periplaneta americana_ could be adversely affected or destroyed by\r\nsulfathiazole, or sodium or calcium penicillin. Fraenkel (1952)\r\nquestioned the conclusions of Brues and Dunn (1945) and of Glaser (1946)\r\nbecause of the high mortality in their experiments, and he suggested\r\nthat the described phenomena \"were due rather to direct toxic effects on\r\nthe host than to loss of the symbionts.\" Noland (_in_ Brooks, 1954;\r\nBrooks and Richards, 1955) confirmed Glaser's results with penicillin\r\nand extended sulfa treatments to include _Blattella germanica_. Every\r\nfemale whose bacteroids were reduced to the vanishing point resorbed her\r\novaries and was incapable of reproduction. Brooks (1954; Brooks and\r\nRichards, 1955) found that administration of several antibiotics did not\r\neliminate the bacteroids from the fat body of _B. germanica_ unless the\r\ndose was so high that it caused excessive mortality. Frank (1955, 1956)\r\nwas able to eliminate bacteroids from _Blatta orientalis_ by injecting\r\nor feeding chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, or penicillin; survival\r\nof treated insects was not good and reproduction was poor; the\r\naposymbiotic individuals were smaller than normal. As Richards and\r\nBrooks (1958) have pointed out, it is uncertain how much of this\r\ndifference was the result of loss of bacteroids and how much the effect\r\nof the drug. It is obvious that in all these experiments the action of\r\nthe drugs on the bacteroids was accompanied by equivocal side effects\r\nwhich confused interpretation of the results. The effect on the\r\ncockroach of a loss of bacteroids cannot be separated from a possible\r\ntoxic effect of the drug.\r\n\r\nFortunately Brooks (1954; Brooks and Richards, 1955) obtained completely\r\naposymbiotic offspring from _Blattella germanica_ that had been reared\r\non aureomycin. These bacteroid-free nymphs were practically incapable of\r\ngrowth on a natural diet that was adequate for nymphs with symbiotes.\r\nHowever, the addition of large amounts of dried yeast to the diet\r\nenabled aposymbiotic nymphs to mature in two to three times the period\r\nrequired by normal nymphs. Final proof of the function of the bacteroids\r\nwas obtained by reestablishing them in aposymbiotic cockroaches. The\r\ninsects that received implants of normal fat body of _B. germanica_\r\nshowed a slow, steady gain in weight over the controls (Brooks, 1954;\r\nBrooks and Richards, 1956). Obviously, the intracellular symbiotes\r\nsubserve the normal nutrition of the cockroach. Whether the bacteroids\r\nproduce only vitaminlike substances, as suggested by Keller (1950), or\r\nfunction in some other way is still to be determined. Brooks (1954)\r\nconcluded that the amount of vitamin-containing food required for\r\nincreased growth by aposymbiotic cockroaches is much greater than the\r\nknown vitamin requirements; hence the factor(s) needed is unknown and\r\npresent in low concentration, or it serves as a precursor of a second\r\nfactor(s) whose synthesis is aided by the bacteroids. Brooks (_in_\r\nRichards and Brooks, 1958) has since found that the bacteroids of\r\n_Blattella germanica_ \"can supply the insect with B vitamins, amino\r\nacids and some larger protein fragment.\"\r\n\r\nGier (1947) stated that the symbiotes of cockroaches are generically all\r\nthe same. However, as the symbiotes are presumed to have been associated\r\nwith cockroaches for over 300,000,000 years (Buchner, 1952) they may be\r\nassumed to have developed specific differences that link them\r\ninseparably to their respective hosts. Ries (1932) transplanted\r\nsymbiote-containing fat body from _Blatta orientalis_ into the mealworm\r\nand larva of _Ephestia kühniella_, and from _Blattella germanica_ and\r\n_Stegobium paniceum_ (=_Sitodrepa panicea_) into _B. orientalis_. The\r\nimplants did not become established in the new host, although most of\r\nthe transplantations were successful in that the hosts survived and the\r\nimplants remained intact for some time before they were encapsulated by\r\nhost tissue. Brooks (1954; Brooks and Richards, 1956) transplanted fat\r\nbody of _Periplaneta americana_ and _B. orientalis_ into aposymbiotic\r\n_B. germanica_. The growth of the cockroaches injected with foreign\r\ntissue was not different from that of aposymbiotic controls. Sections of\r\nhost insects did not contain mycetocytes and no bacteroids were found.\r\nHaller (1955a) injected bacteroids or implanted mycetocytes of _B.\r\ngermanica_ into gryllids, acridids, and locustids. These implants and\r\ninnoculations were rapidly destroyed by the hosts. But as Richards and\r\nBrooks (1958) have pointed out, none of these experiments provide\r\ninformation about the specificity of the bacteroids themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCKROACHES IN WHICH BACTEROIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND\r\n\r\n     _Bantua stigmosa._ Fraenkel (1921)\r\n\r\n     _Blaberus craniifer._ Brooks (1954); Brues and Dunn (1945); Hoover\r\n       (1945).\r\n\r\n     _Blaberus giganteus._ Blochmann (1892).\r\n\r\n     _Blatta orientalis._ Blochmann (1887, 1888, 1892); Bode (1936);\r\n       Brooks (1954); Buchner (1912); Cuénot (1896); Fraenkel (1921);\r\n       Frank (1955, 1956); Gier (1936, 1947); Glaser (1920);\r\n       Gropengiesser (1925); Gubler (1948); Heymons (1895); Hollande\r\n       and Favre (1931); Hoover (1945); Hovasse (1930); Javelly (1914);\r\n       Keller (1950); Koch (1949); Menel (1907)?; Mercier (1906a, 1907,\r\n       1907b, 1907c); Ries (1932); Ronzoni (1949); Tacchini (1946); Wolf\r\n       (1924, 1924a).\r\n\r\n     _Blattella germanica._ Blochmann (1887, 1888, 1892); Bode (1936);\r\n       Borghese (1946, 1948, 1948a); Brooks (1954); Brooks and Richards\r\n       (1954, 1955, 1955a, 1956); Fraenkel (1921); Gier (1936, 1947);\r\n       Glaser (1920, 1930a); Gropengiesser (1925); Haller (1955, 1955a);\r\n       Heymons (1892, 1895); Hoover (1945); Koch (1949); Lwoff (1923);\r\n       Milovidov (1928); Neukomm (1927, 1927a, 1932); Pérez Silva (1954,\r\n       1954a); Ries (1932); Rizki (1954); Ronzoni (1949); Tacchini\r\n       (1946); Wollman (1926); Yetwin (1932, 1953).\r\n\r\n     _Cryptocercus punctulatus._ Gier (1936, 1947); Hoover (1945).\r\n\r\n     _Derocalymma cruralis._ Fraenkel (1921).\r\n\r\n     _Ectobius lapponicus._ Heymons (1892); Cuénot (1896); Koch (1949).\r\n\r\n     _Ectobius pallidus._ Heymons (1892, 1895); Cuénot (1896).\r\n\r\n     _Epilampra grisea._ Fraenkel (1921).\r\n\r\n     _Eurycotis floridana._ Gier (1936, 1947).\r\n\r\n     _Loboptera decipiens._ Buchner (1930).\r\n\r\n     _Nauphoeta cinerea._ Fraenkel (1921).\r\n\r\n     _Nyctibora noctivaga._ Gier (1947).\r\n\r\n     _Parcoblatta lata._ Gier (1936, 1947).\r\n\r\n     _Parcoblatta pensylvanica._ Brooks (1954); Gier (1936, 1947).\r\n\r\n     _Parcoblatta uhleriana._ Gier (1936, 1947); Hoover (1945).\r\n\r\n     _Parcoblatta virginica._ Glaser (1920); Gier (1947).\r\n\r\n     _Periplaneta americana._ Baudisch (1956); Bode (1936); Cuénot\r\n       (1896); Gier (1936, 1937, 1947); Glaser (1920, 1930, 1946);\r\n       Gubler (1948); Hertig (1921); Hoover (1945); Ketchel and\r\n       Williams (1953).\r\n\r\n     _Periplaneta australasiae._ Gier (1936, 1947); Koch (1949).\r\n\r\n     _Platyzosteria armata._ Fraenkel (1921).\r\n\r\n     _Polyphaga aegyptiaca._ Fraenkel (1921).\r\n\r\n     _Pseudoderopeltis aethiopica._ Fraenkel (1921).\r\n\r\n     _Pycnoscelus surinamensis._ Bode (1936); Koch (1949).\r\n\r\n     _Supella supellectilium._ Brooks (1954).\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIA\r\n\r\nEvidence showing that intestinal bacteria contribute to the nutrition of\r\ncockroaches is meager. Cleveland et al. (1934) isolated a bacterial\r\norganism from the foregut of the wood-feeding cockroach _Panesthia\r\nangustipennis_. The bacterium digested cellulose rapidly in vitro and\r\nthese workers believe that this cockroach and other related wood-feeding\r\nspecies are dependent on symbiotic bacteria for the digestion of their\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nMencl (1907) described cell nuclei in \"symbiotic,\" not closely defined\r\ntypes of bacilli that he found in abundance in the digestive tract of\r\nthe Küchenschabe, _Periplaneta_ (presumably _Blatta orientalis_).\r\nUnfortunately, he was more concerned about the morphology of the\r\nbacteria than the stated mutualistic relationship, so nothing is known\r\nof their physiology.\r\n\r\nThe growth rates of _Periplaneta americana_ and _Blattella germanica_\r\nwere retarded when the insects were reared aseptically, which suggests\r\nthat microorganisms normally found in the digestive tract supply certain\r\nnecessary dietary constituents (Gier, 1947a; House, 1949). Noland et al.\r\n(1949) suggested that microorganisms in the digestive tract of _B.\r\ngermanica_ synthesized riboflavin since the nymphs reared on a low\r\nriboflavin diet accumulated more of the vitamin than could have been\r\ningested in the diet. However, Metcalf and Patton (1942) found little or\r\nno bacterial synthesis of riboflavin in _P. americana_. Noland and\r\nBaumann (1951) suggested that methionine, one of the amino acids\r\nessential for rapid growth of _B. germanica_, was synthesized by\r\nintestinal microorganisms in the insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTOZOA\r\n\r\nIt is probable that with few exceptions protozoa found in the digestive\r\ntract are not necessary for survival of the cockroach. However, very few\r\nexperiments have been performed to determine the importance, if any, of\r\nthese microorganisms to the host. Cleveland (1925) removed the protozoa\r\nfrom the cockroach (possibly _Periplaneta americana_) by oxygenation at\r\n3.5 atmospheres. The ciliates _Nyctotherus_ and _Balantidium_,\r\nflagellates _Lophomonas_ and _Polymastix_, the amoeba _Endamoeba\r\nblattae_, and three unidentified protozoa were killed by this treatment,\r\nyet the insects lived normally after defaunation.\r\n\r\nArmer (1944) studied the effects of high-carbohydrate, high-fat, and\r\nhigh-protein diets, as well as starvation, on the intestinal protozoa\r\n(_Nyctotherus ovalis_, _Endamoeba blattae_, _Endolimax blattae_,\r\n_Lophomonas striata_, and _Lophomonas blattarum_) in _Periplaneta\r\namericana_. Starvation of the host lowered the incidence or eliminated\r\nmost of the protozoa, but a high-carbohydrate diet maintained them at a\r\nrelatively high level. _Lophomonas blattarum_ was eliminated by a\r\nhigh-protein diet, and practically eliminated by a high-fat diet.\r\n_Lophomonas striata_ was eliminated from some hosts that were kept on\r\nhigh-fat and high-protein diets. _Endamoeba blattae_ showed a decrease\r\nin infection rate when the cockroaches were maintained on high-fat and\r\nhigh-protein diets. The effects of diets on _Endolimax blattae_ were not\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by Cleveland (1930, 1948) and Cleveland et al. (1931,\r\n1934) that the wood-feeding cockroach _Cryptocercus punctulatus_ depends\r\nupon certain intestinal protozoa for survival; these protozoa utilize as\r\nfood the wood ingested by this cockroach. The wood is broken down into\r\ncompounds the cockroach can utilize by the protozoa which elaborate a\r\ncellulase and possibly a cellobiase (Trager, 1932). Only molting nymphs\r\nof _Cryptocercus_ can pass the protozoa on to the newly hatched young,\r\nso that molting and hatching must happen concurrently each year or the\r\nyoung die.\r\n\r\nThe sexual cycles in species of protozoa in the genera _Trichonympha_,\r\n_Saccinobaculus_, _Oxymonas_, _Monocercomonoides_, _Hexamita_,\r\n_Eucomonympha_, _Leptospironympha_, _Urinympha_, _Rhynchonympha_,\r\n_Macrospironympha_, and _Barbulanympha_ (fig. 3, B) are induced by\r\nhormones produced by _Cryptocercus_ only during its molting period\r\n(Cleveland, 1931, 1947, 1947a, 1949-1956a). Perhaps the prothoracic\r\ngland hormone of the host may be responsible for initiation of the\r\nflagellate sexual cycles (Cleveland and Nutting, 1955). The protozoan\r\nsexual cycles may be used as indicators of the onset of molting in\r\n_Cryptocercus_; thus different species of protozoa begin their sexual\r\ncycles from 35 days before to 2 days after molting of the cockroach\r\n(Cleveland and Nutting, 1954). Hollande (1952) and Grassé (1952) have\r\nreviewed the roles and the evolution of the flagellates in\r\n_Cryptocercus_ and in termites.\r\n\r\nThe protozoa of cockroaches and termites are clues to the relationship\r\nbetween these two groups of insects. Kirby (1927) pointed out\r\nsimilarities between _Endamoeba blattae_ of _Periplaneta_ and the\r\namoebae of the termite _Mirotermes_, suggesting that these protozoans\r\nwere probably derived from an amoeba in an ancestor common to both\r\nblattid and termite. Kirby (1932, _in_ Kidder, 1937) found a species of\r\n_Nyctotherus_ in _Amitermes_ that resembles _Nyctotherus ovalis_ from\r\ndomestic cockroaches. The belief that the termites and cockroaches had a\r\ncommon origin is also strengthened by the similarities between the\r\nhypermastigotes of both _Cryptocercus_ and termites (Cleveland et al.,\r\n1934).\r\n\r\nThe cockroaches _Cryptocercus_ and _Panesthia_ both feed on wood, but\r\nthe protozoa found in _Panesthia_ resemble more closely the species in\r\ndomestic cockroaches than those in _Cryptocercus_. The Clevelandellidae\r\n(from _Panesthia_) are closely related to _Nyctotherus_ and have\r\nprobably evolved from common ancestors. However, the separation of the\r\nClevelandellidae from _Nyctotherus_ must have taken place at a later\r\ndate than the divergence of their hosts, otherwise representatives of\r\nthat family would probably also be found in _Periplaneta_ and _Blatta_\r\n(Kidder, 1937).\r\n\r\nThe protozoa of _Cryptocercus_ can be transferred from one individual to\r\nanother (Nutting and Cleveland, 1954). They can also be transferred to\r\nthe termite _Zootermopsis_ where they survive only until the host molts;\r\nthe reverse is also true, _Zootermopsis_ Protozoa can survive in\r\n_Cryptocercus_ until the cockroach molts (Nutting and Cleveland, 1954a).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.

(Fischer and\r\nSyverton, 1951a, 1957): Recently Fischer and Syverton (1957) found that\r\nafter feeding a single meal of Coxsackie virus to _Periplaneta\r\namericana_, the gastrointestinal tracts of the insects, which were\r\nremoved at 5-day intervals up to 20 days, contained sufficient virus to\r\nparalyze and kill test mice. Cockroach salivary glands, removed 5 days\r\nafter the insects had fed, contained the virus which caused paralysis\r\nand death in test mice; mice were also infected by virus obtained from\r\nsalivary glands removed from the insects 10 and 20 days after the\r\ncockroaches had fed once on the virus. The virus was also isolated from\r\nthe cockroaches' feces and rarely from the fat bodies and reproductive\r\norgans. Fischer and Syverton concluded that it is possible that\r\ncockroaches could acquire the virus, by feeding on mammalian excreta,\r\nmaintain it for a period of time, and transmit it by contamination of\r\nfood. The virus could also be transmitted through the feces of wild mice\r\nif the mice happened to feed on virus-infected cockroaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n* =Mouse encephalomyelitis virus=\r\n\r\n_Experimental vectors._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A.

These microorganisms were never found together in\r\nthe same insect and caused loss of appetite, sluggishness, irregular\r\nrespiratory movements, and paralysis in the cockroach; in the final\r\nstages of the disease the legs were folded under the body, the head was\r\ntucked beneath the forelegs, the whole insect became arched and\r\nmaintained this position until death. In some cockroaches infected with\r\nthe rod pathogen, conjunctival folds, particularly those between the\r\ndorsal abdominal sclerites, and the joints of the metathoracic legs\r\nruptured liberating thick white hemolymph filled with bacteria. Tauber\r\nsuggested that the infection might be spread by contact, especially to\r\nnewly molted individuals or by actual ingestion of the bacteria by the\r\ncockroaches feeding on dead or dying individuals. All the roaches died\r\nafter successful inoculation with the _Micrococcus_. The bacterial\r\ninfection was associated with high total hemocyte counts and high\r\npercentages of mitotically dividing hemolymph cells (Tauber, 1940);\r\nthese responses of the insect were interpreted as a mechanism whereby\r\nthe number of hemocytes increases resulting in an increase in the number\r\nof phagocytes for combating the bacteria (Tauber and Griffiths, 1942).\r\n\r\n\r\n* =Micrococcus pyogenes= var. =aureus= (Rosenbach) Zopf\r\n\r\n_Natural vectors._--_Blaberus craniifer_, U.S.A.

FUNGI AND YEASTS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest number of fungi known to be associated with\r\ncockroaches belong to the Laboulbeniaceae, genus _Herpomyces_, the\r\nspecies of which are restricted to parasitizing cockroaches (Thaxter,\r\n1908). Most species are hyaline, small and inconspicuous (Thaxter, 1931)\r\nand are usually, but not exclusively, found on the insects' antennae.\r\nSpecies of _Herpomyces_ are highly, but not completely, host specific\r\n(Richards and Smith, 1954). While attached to the host, these fungi\r\nappear like minute dark-colored, yellow, or white (e.g., _H. arietinus_)\r\nbristles or bushy hairs (pl. 27, A).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Diagram illustrating the relationship between a\r\n  mature plant of _Herpomyces stylopygae_ and the integument of _Blatta\r\n  orientalis_. (Reproduced from Richards and Smith [1956], through the\r\n  courtesy of Dr. A. G. Richards.)]\r\n\r\nRichards and Smith (1955, 1955a) have studied the life history of\r\n_Herpomyces stylopygae_ on the oriental cockroach. The plants grow only\r\non living cockroaches, and the infection is disseminated by contact. The\r\nmature plants are found mostly on the antennae (pl. 27, B), either on\r\nsetae or on hard or soft cuticle. Spores are ejected from perithecia\r\nsingly or in groups of 2 to 4 spores, although groups as large as 12\r\nspores have been found. The presence of single, paired, or multiple\r\nspore groups on the surface of the host was correlated with the presence\r\nof single, paired, or multiple plants on infected cockroaches.\r\nDevelopment from spore to mature perithecia takes about two weeks. The\r\nplant obtains nutriment from the host by means of a tubular haustorium\r\nthat extends through the cockroach's cuticle and expands into a large\r\nbulb in the underlying epidermal cells (fig. 1). Infections on nymphs\r\nare lost when the nymph moults, but infections on adults persist\r\nthroughout life. However, nymphs which have lost the fungus upon\r\nmoulting are readily reinfected. Collart's (1947) statement that nymphs\r\nare never infected with _Herpomyces_ is not true.\r\n\r\nRichards and Smith (1956) concluded that there is no evidence of\r\npathogenicity in _Herpomyces_ infections because heavily infected\r\ncockroaches appear fully active in laboratory colonies; they can run at\r\nthe same speed as uninfected cockroaches; they reproduce normally and do\r\nnot appear to die prematurely. These workers stated that the infections\r\ncause a dermatitis which is neither pathogenic nor debilitant. So far as\r\nwe know there are no comparative data on longevity and reproductive\r\nperformance of fungus-infected versus normal cockroaches. However, Gunn\r\nand Cosway (1938) have shown that the presence of these fungi\r\n(identified as _Stigmatomyces_ sp.; see p. 138) on the antennae seemed\r\nto interfere with the humidity reactions of _Blatta orientalis_.\r\nAlthough Richards and Smith (1956) admit that humidity receptors and\r\nother sense organs on the antennae may be destroyed by the fungus, they\r\nstate that \"insects possess such a large number of sensilla that the\r\nresult may well be more distressing to the sensory physiologist than to\r\nthe insect.\" Yet it seems to us that the loss of sense organs from\r\nfungal infection and concomitant shortening of the antennae (pl. 27, A)\r\nmight be considerably more of a handicap to free-living cockroaches than\r\nthose in laboratory colonies.\r\n\r\nBode (1936) studied the flora of _Periplaneta americana_ and cultured\r\nAspergillaceae and Mucorinae from the insect's body surface and\r\nintestinal contents; he also found nonsporulating yeasts in _P.\r\namericana_. To prevent fungal growth on oöthecae of _P. americana_,\r\nGriffiths and Tauber (1942a) autoclaved their rearing containers and\r\ndipped the oöthecae in 70-percent alcohol for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nMercier (1906) isolated and cultured a pathogenic yeastlike parasite\r\nwhich had invaded the fat body and blood of _Blatta orientalis_. The\r\nabdomens of the infected insects became swollen, distended, and soft.\r\nMcShan (unpublished MS., 1953) consistently isolated Saccharomycetes\r\nfrom the feces of _Periplaneta americana_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH COCKROACHES\r\n\r\nThe use of the asterisk (*) is explained in footnote 3, page 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhylum THALLOPHYTA\r\n\r\nClass FUNGI IMPERFECTI\r\n\r\nOrder MONILIALES\r\n\r\nFamily PSEUDOSACCHAROMYCETACEAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Candida zeylanoides= (Castellani) Langeron and Guerra\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--Oötheca of _Blatta orientalis_, Italy (Ronzoni, 1949).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Torulopsis= sp.\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--Oötheca of _Blatta orientalis_, Italy (Ronzoni, 1949).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily MONILIACEAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spicaria prasina= (Maublanc) Sawada\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Ischnoptera rufa rufa_, Puerto Rico (Wolcott, 1950): A\r\ndead specimen of this cockroach was found stuck to a leaf and covered\r\nwith this fungus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aspergillus flavus= Link\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--Oöthecae of _Blattella germanica_ and _Eurycotis\r\nfloridana_, U.S.A., Pennsylvania (Roth and Willis, unpublished data,\r\n1952): On outer surface.

However, Richards and Smith (1954) concluded\r\nthat _H. stylopygae_ would not grow on _P. americana_ under their\r\nlaboratory conditions although _H. periplanetae_ would grow on _B.\r\norientalis_. This indicated a strain or species difference between the\r\ntwo fungi.

Undoubtedly many associations are\r\necological, but lack of adequate supporting evidence makes this\r\nconclusion somewhat tentative. The ecological aspects are covered in\r\nSection III (p. 14). Other associations may be accidental (e.g., certain\r\nunique observations that have never again been confirmed). In the\r\nabsence of contrary evidence, most associations are presumed to be\r\nbenign; exceptions to this conclusion are found among the cockroaches\r\nthat feed on living plants (p. 162) and those allegedly captured as prey\r\nby the carnivorous pitcher plants (_Sarracenia_ and _Nepenthes_). In all\r\nthe records cited below the cockroaches were stated to have been on, in,\r\nor feeding on the plant.\r\n\r\nThe plants are listed below by family according to the taxonomic\r\narrangement of Lawrence (1951). Botanical nomenclature follows Bailey\r\n(1925), Fernald (1950), or Dr. R. A. Howard (personal communications,\r\n1958, 1959).

Although many of the species associated with bananas are\r\nindigenous to the banana-growing areas of the American Tropics, most of\r\nthe specimens cited below were captured elsewhere as adventitious\r\ninsects that had been imported with the fruit. It is obvious that many\r\nof these insects must have been closely associated with bananas on the\r\nplantations, where, undoubtedly, the growing plants provided attractive\r\necological niches. Bunting (1956) deduced, from the presence of healthy\r\ncockroaches on bananas allegedly sprayed with copper arsenate, that the\r\ninsects did not feed on stems or fruit but hid among the bananas and\r\nforaged elsewhere; however, certain reports are of cockroaches actually\r\nfeeding on bananas. Some of the records cited by Hebard (1917) were\r\ncompiled from earlier reports not all of which we have seen. Numbers in\r\nparentheses following certain citations indicate the number of times the\r\nassociation had been observed. Known or suspected adventive material is\r\nso indicated.\r\n\r\n_Aglaopteryx diaphana_, Jamaica (Rehn and Hebard, 1927): Found in bracts\r\nof banana blossoms.

Among the\r\ndepredations attributed to cockroaches in text books, damage to plants\r\nis seldom emphasized. This is surprising in view of the many records\r\ncited below.\r\n\r\nCapt. William Bligh (1792), while collecting breadfruit trees in Tahiti\r\nto take to the West Indies, wrote in his log during January 1789: \"This\r\nmorning, I ordered all the chests to be taken on shore, and the inside\r\nof the ship to be washed with boiling water, to kill the cockroaches. We\r\nwere constantly obliged to be at great pains to keep the ship clear of\r\nvermin, on account of the plants.\"\r\n\r\nWestwood (1869) stated that _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ was very\r\ndestructive in orchid houses feeding on buds and young shoots. Later\r\nWestwood (1876) exhibited the bulb of an orchid from Ecuador which\r\ncontained six species of cockroaches: _Blatta orientalis_,\r\n[_Periplaneta_?] _americana_, [_Nauphoeta_?] _cinerea_, [_Leucophaea_?]\r\n_maderae_, and two others unknown to him. Fullaway (1938) stated that\r\ncockroaches damage root tips, buds, and flowers of orchids. _Periplaneta\r\namericana_ has been said to eat the root tips and blossoms of orchids\r\n(Taschenberg, 1884) and to devour the open flower petals of _Cattleya_\r\norchids as well as the aerial roots and flower spikes of _Vanda_ orchids\r\n(Rau, 1940a). Wainwright (1898) stated that _Periplaneta australasiae_\r\nhad been observed in an orchid house in Perthshire where over a period\r\nof three years it had caused a good deal of damage. Skinner (1905)\r\nreported that _P. australasiae_ in greenhouses in Pennsylvania showed no\r\npreference for any one plant but ate both plants and flowers of orchids,\r\nroses, and carnations. Lucas (1918) received specimens of _P.\r\naustralasiae_ which had played havoc with orchids especially _Cattleya_\r\nand _Vanda_. Morse (1920) reported that both _P. australasiae_ and\r\n_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ were obnoxious in a conservatory in\r\nMassachusetts where they gnawed the tips of the aerial roots of orchids.\r\nSwezey (1945) in Hawaii stated that the following cockroaches have been\r\nreported as occasional minor pests on orchids: _Blatta orientalis_,\r\n_Blaberus discoidalis_, _P. americana_, and _P. surinamensis_; he\r\nfurther stated that _Graptoblatta notulata_ had been intercepted at\r\nHonolulu on orchids from India.\r\n\r\nWatson (1907) stated that _Blatta orientalis_, _Periplaneta americana_,\r\nand _Periplaneta australasiae_ were injurious in the tropical plant\r\nhouses at Kew: \"at night they come out and run or fly about among the\r\nplants, devouring flowers and leaves like rabbits. Such plants as\r\n_Eucharis_, _Crinum_ and _Alpinia_, when in flower, have little chance\r\nin the palm house, where the cockroaches are most abundant; they also\r\nfind out the ripening bananas and soon devour them.\" Raffill (1910)\r\nstated that in plant houses in England _B. orientalis_, _P. americana_,\r\nand _P. australasiae_ commonly, and _Nauphoeta cinerea_, _Nauphoeta\r\nflexivitta_, and _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ more rarely, are extremely\r\ndestructive to plants. Flowers having a strong perfume, such as orchids,\r\n_Eucharis_, _Crinum_, and _Hedychium_, were often attacked while other\r\nflowers nearby were left uninjured.\r\n\r\nPlank and Winters (1949) reported that in Puerto Rico the species of\r\nOrthoptera most injurious under greenhouse conditions was _Periplaneta\r\namericana_. Large nymphs destroyed 25 to 30 percent of freshly planted\r\nseed of _Cinchona pubescens_. In Hawaii the host plants of _P.\r\namericana_ are blossoms of _Canna_ and _Tribulus_, and the host plants\r\nof _Periplaneta australasiae_ are _Pritchardia_ and _Sida_ (Zimmerman,\r\n1948). On St. Kitts, B.W.I., young cotton plants were severely attacked\r\nby _P. australasiae_; this caused loss of the stand on a considerable\r\narea and necessitated replanting (Ballou, 1916). _P. australasiae_ was\r\nreported damaging the _Polystichum aristatum_ Presl [=_Lastrea aristata\r\nvariegata_] in a greenhouse (Thilow and Riley, 1891). Laing (1946;\r\nBritish Museum [Natural History], 1951) stated that _P. australasiae_\r\nabounds in greenhouses and forcing pits where it may do considerable\r\ndamage to the plants. _Periplaneta fuliginosa_ is also troublesome in\r\ngreenhouses because of its tendency to feed on seedlings and succulent\r\nplants (Dodge and Rickett, 1943).\r\n\r\n_Ectobius lapponicus_ has been observed feeding in galleries in the\r\nthick skin of young aspen in 25 percent of the trees examined (Stark\r\n_in_ Bei-Bienko, 1950). The aquatic cockroach _Epilampra abdomen nigrum_\r\nfed on the leaves of _Jussiaea natans_ in an aquarium (Crowell, 1946).\r\n_Ischnoptera deropeltiformis_ has been taken while it was feeding on a\r\nfleshy fungus (_Agaricus_ sp.) in dense woods in Indiana (Blatchley,\r\n1920).\r\n\r\n_Diploptera punctata_, the cypress roach or beetle roach, has been found\r\nin Hawaii feeding on ripening mangoes and papayas, oranges on the tree,\r\nand the outer covering of the pods of _Acacia farnesiana_ (Bridwell and\r\nSwezey, 1915). Pemberton (1934) stated that _D. punctata_ \"disfigures\r\nour cypress trees by eating the bark from the young branches, often\r\ngiving them a dead appearance over much of their leaf area.\" Fullaway\r\nand Krauss (1945) added, \"This injury [to cypress] is so severe that\r\nsometimes areas of leaves die and turn brown. The Japanese cedar,\r\nironwood, citrus and algaroba (kiawe) trees are attacked in a similar\r\nmanner.\" Similar injury to cypress was described by Hebard (1922). In\r\naddition to girdling _Cupressus_, _D. punctata_ injures _Cryptomeria_ in\r\nthe same fashion and also attacks algaroba, lime, and other plants\r\n(Pemberton and Williams, 1938). Zimmerman (1948) cited the following\r\nhost plants for _D. punctata_ in Hawaii: \"_Cupressus macrocarpa_,\r\n_Casuarina_, _Cryptomeria_, _Citrus_, geraniums, _Acacia farnesiana_\r\npods, mango fruits, orange fruits, papaya fruits.\"\r\n\r\nIn the reports of damage to plants by cockroaches, _Pycnoscelus\r\nsurinamensis_ has been implicated most often. This species is\r\nundoubtedly one of the economically most important cockroaches, being\r\nthe vector of the chicken eyeworm as well as feeding on plants. In\r\naddition to the few reports of damage caused by this species that have\r\nalready been mentioned, _P. surinamensis_ has been reported to be very\r\ndestructive in New Orleans to palms and ferns, attacking large\r\nalsophilas avidly, eating out the hearts (Anonymous, 1893). Zappe (1918)\r\nin Connecticut reported damage in a greenhouse to roses valued, at that\r\ntime, at several hundred dollars; _P. surinamensis_ had girdled the rose\r\nbushes, done much damage to Easter lilies, and in another greenhouse had\r\neaten the bark from the stems of poinsettias. In Germany this species\r\nbit off the tips of the aerial roots and ate the petals of orchids\r\n(Zacher, 1920). Lucas (1923) reported damage to cucumber plants in a\r\ngreenhouse in Surrey. Damage by _P. surinamensis_ to the stems of rose\r\nbushes has been reported in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania; the canes\r\nwere attacked both under and above ground (Caudell, 1925). Doucette and\r\nSmith (1926) reported a heavy infestation of _P. surinamensis_ in a\r\nrange of greenhouses in Philadelphia: \"The roaches were present\r\nliterally by the millions.... Although the roaches had been observed in\r\ncabinets and trash barrels for several months, it was not until the\r\nmanager had occasion to go through the house one evening that he\r\ndiscovered that roaches were the cause of the troubles previously\r\nattributed to soil condition, watering, fungus, and other agencies....\r\nAbout 30,000 to 35,000 rose plants from a total of 200,000 in the three\r\nmore heavily infested houses were so badly injured by the gnawing off of\r\nthe bark, young buds, and shoots of the main stems, that they were not\r\nin condition to be kept in the beds for another season.\"\r\n\r\nIn Haiti _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ damaged the tubers of growing\r\npotatoes (Hoffman, 1927). Illingworth (1927, 1929) reported that in\r\nHawaii _P. surinamensis_ was a minor pest of pineapples, feeding on the\r\nroots. This species was very plentiful in a propagating pit in England\r\nwhere it did much damage to various seeds and seedlings (Lucas, 1930).\r\nRoeser (1940) summarized some of the above-mentioned damage caused by\r\n_P. surinamensis_ and added damage to chrysanthemums in Hawaii and\r\ntobacco in Sumatra where this cockroach destroyed 300,000 plants in a\r\nfew days. Roeser was of the opinion that living plants were eaten only\r\nas a substitute when the earth became poor in food material. Zimmerman\r\n(1948) listed as host plants of _P. surinamensis_ in Hawaii: \"blossoms\r\nof _Tribulus_; reported feeding at roots of pineapples, and unconfirmed\r\nreports of damage to underground parts of some other plants.\" Goodliffe\r\n(1958) reported damage by this species to banana plants in a\r\nconservatory in northern England. Cohic (1956) implied that in New\r\nCaledonia \"Racines de légumes\" were attacked by _P. surinamensis_ and\r\nthat _Zea mays_ Linnaeus was attacked by _Supella supellectilium_.\r\nWolcott (1924a) reported that _P. surinamensis_ damaged transplanted\r\ntobacco plants in Puerto Rico by eating the interior of the stalks.\r\nTobacco planters in Cuba consider _P. surinamensis_ injurious to the\r\nroots of tobacco plants (Bruner and Scaramuzza, 1936); this belief was\r\nconfirmed in the laboratory, where adults and nymphs destroyed the roots\r\nand stems of tobacco plants two inches high and ate into the edges of\r\nthe leaves. Dammerman (1929) reported that in Malaya this species often\r\nappeared in large numbers in gardens where it gnawed at the underground\r\nparts of vegetables and ornamental plants. Lever (1947) listed it as a\r\npest on the leaves of pineapple.\r\n\r\n_Blattella vaga_ may occasionally damage seedlings in the laboratory\r\n(Flock, 1941a), but no damage has been reported in the field (Ball et\r\nal., 1942). Heer (1864) reported receiving a shipment of cycads from\r\nCuba with all stages of _Periplaneta americana_ living in holes in the\r\nbranches, apparently subsisting on the starchy tissues. Goldenberg\r\n(1877) stated that sago trees provide cockroaches with their favorite\r\nnourishment. Scudder (1879) found _Eurycotis floridana_ living in the\r\ntops of the cabbage palmetto, on which he presumed it fed. _Parcoblatta\r\namericana_ has been observed feeding on an apple 6 feet above ground\r\n(Fulton, 1930).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.

HELMINTHS\r\n\r\n\r\nIntestinal nematodes of the family Thelastomatidae have no apparent\r\npathological effect on their cockroach hosts. Galeb (1878) has shown\r\nexperimentally that oxyurids eat the same food as the host insect and\r\nthat if one starves them, by withholding food from the host, the\r\noxyurids die and disappear. In other words, these worms are not\r\nparasites, in the sense that we use the term in this paper, but\r\ncommensals. Dobrovolny and Ackert (1934) stated that \"all observations\r\nseemed to indicate that the health, fertility and activity of the\r\nheavily infested cockroaches were comparable with those of the\r\nnon-parasitised specimens.\"\r\n\r\nVery few papers have dealt with the ecology of the oxyurid parasites of\r\ncockroaches. According to Galeb (1878), usually one species of nematode\r\nis found in a single cockroach, but sometimes two species live together\r\nin the same host (e.g., in _Blatta orientalis_ and _Polyphaga\r\naegyptiaca_) where they compete for food. Galeb claimed that\r\n_Hammerschmidtiella diesingi_ would replace _Leidynema appendiculata_;\r\nhe observed that _H. diesingi_ surpassed _L. appendiculata_ in numbers\r\nand the latter became uncommon in the intestines of the cockroaches. On\r\nthe other hand, Sobolev (1937) found that 48 percent of his oriental\r\ncockroaches were infected with both of the above species of nematodes.\r\nThe average number of both species was 7.5, and the maximum number was\r\n97; the mean number of _H. diesingi_ was 5.1 and the maximum 64; the\r\nmean number of _L. appendiculata_ was 2.4 and the maximum 33. More than\r\n40 nematodes were found in each cockroach of 1.3 percent of those\r\nexamined. These results apparently contradict Galeb's conclusions\r\ninasmuch as the number of each species in mixed infections was\r\nessentially the same as the number found in cockroaches infected by only\r\none species (see pp. 195 and 197). Dobrovolny and Ackert (1934) found\r\nthat 29 percent of 222 _Periplaneta americana_ contained both of the\r\nabove species of nematodes; whereas 40 percent contained _L.\r\nappendiculata_ only, and 21 percent contained _H. diesingi_ only. The\r\ninfestation ranged from 1 to 36 worms per cockroach with averages of 3.8\r\nper male, 5.1 per female, and 2.7 per nymph.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of some helminths pass unharmed through the guts of cockroaches\r\nthat serve as vectors of these ova and have no effect on the insect.\r\nHowever, helminths that are secondary parasites in cockroaches damage\r\nthe insect to varying degrees depending upon the extent of the\r\ninfection. Thus the larvae of _Moniliformis moniliformis_ pass through\r\nthe gut wall and some may become embedded in the fat tissue (Moore,\r\n1946). First stage larvae of _Oxyspirura mansoni_ also burrow through\r\nthe midgut wall into the fat body; Sanders (1929) believed that\r\n_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ could be killed if at one time a sufficient\r\nnumber of migrating larvae of _O. mansoni_ penetrated the cockroach's\r\nintestinal wall. _Gongylonema neoplasticum_ migrates through the\r\ndigestive tract and encysts in the muscles of the thorax and legs of the\r\nhost (Fibiger and Ditlevsen, 1914). Infective larvae of _Protospirura\r\nmuricola_, after hatching from ingested eggs, pass through the\r\ncockroach's gut wall and encyst mainly in the thorax, around the crop,\r\nand at the bases of the large muscles of the prothoracic legs (Foster\r\nand Johnson, 1939). It is probably generally true that nematodes which\r\nare secondary parasites in cockroaches do some damage to the host's\r\nintestinal tract at least, and they probably also damage other organs in\r\nwhich they may encyst.\r\n\r\nCockroach tissues may react defensively to infections by parasitic\r\nnematodes. For example, encysted third-stage larvae of _Physaloptera\r\nturgida_ have been found enclosed in a thin, brown, chitinous substance\r\nthat was undoubtedly deposited by the tissue of the cockroach (Alicata,\r\n1937). Cysts of similar appearance have been found in cockroaches\r\ninfected with _Physaloptera rara_, _P. maxillaris_, _P. hispida_ (Petri,\r\n1950; Hobmaier, 1941; Schell, 1952), and _Gongylonema pulchrum_\r\n(Schell, 1952a); in the latter species the deposit eventually completely\r\nsurrounded the nematode larva which was killed and \"chitinized.\"\r\nApparently these pigmented cysts surround unhealthy or dead larvae and\r\nare secreted as a defensive mechanism by the host (Schell, 1952a).\r\nOswald (1958) has reported finding similar pigmented cysts in _Blatta\r\norientalis_ and _Periplaneta americana_ that were experimentally\r\ninfected with _Rictularia coloradensis_.\r\n\r\nOur classification of the helminths follows Hyman (1951, 1951a).\r\n\r\n\r\nHELMINTHS FOR WHICH COCKROACHES SERVE AS PRIMARY HOSTS\r\n\r\nPhylum ASCHELMINTHES\r\n\r\nClass NEMATODA\r\n\r\nOrder MERMITHOIDEA\r\n\r\nFamily MERMITHIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Undetermined mermithids=\r\n\r\n_Natural Hosts._--_Ectobius pallidus_, U.S.A., Plymouth, Massachusetts\r\n(Roth and Willis, 1957): This mermithid lies coiled in the body cavity\r\nof the host and one end may extend into the thorax.

It is frequently\r\nfound in adults and seldom in the nymphs. There were seldom more than 5\r\nto 10 worms in one cockroach and female worms were found more frequently\r\nthan males; the male worms were found only in winter and spring while\r\nthe females were present at all times of the year. Bütschli (1871)\r\nstated that all stages from those just hatching to mature males and\r\nfemales are found.\r\n\r\nYakimov and Miller (1922) found _H. diesingi_ in 50.8 percent of 124 _B.\r\norientalis_ collected in Petrograd. Sobolev (1937) found 96 percent of\r\n_B. orientalis_ infected with _H. diesingi_ with a mean number of 5.6\r\nand maximum number of 22 in one cockroach. Groschaft (1956) found 18 in\r\none specimen of _B. orientalis_. Dobrovolny and Ackert (1934) found\r\nabout 50 percent of 222 _P. americana_ infected with _H. diesingi_.\r\nSondak (1935) found about 36 percent of 412 _B. orientalis_ infected\r\nwith either or both _H. diesingi_ and _Leidynema appendiculata_.\r\n\r\nTwo molts occur during development of the eggs; the first takes place\r\noutside the host resulting in a resting or infective stage. After the\r\negg in the infective stage is eaten by the host, the second molt occurs\r\nbefore the egg hatches. Completion of the second molt and hatching\r\nperhaps are connected with ammonia present in the digestive tract; the\r\nammonia seems to arise from the bacteria present in the gut. There\r\nappears to be a relationship between the intestinal bacteria of the\r\ncockroach and development and hatching of nematode eggs (Todd, 1944).\r\n\r\nAt the time of oviposition the nematode eggs are in the very earliest\r\nstages of cleavage. In 36 hours a motile, tadpole-like stage is reached\r\nand in a few days the embryo becomes quiescent and nonmotile. This\r\nnonmotile stage is infective whereas the motile embryonic stage is not.\r\nFeeding experiments proved that transmission of the nematode is direct.\r\nThe worm reaches sexual maturity in 20 or 30 days after being ingested\r\nby the cockroach (Dobrovolny, 1933).\r\n\r\nThe bacterium _Streptomyces leidynematis_ Hoffman grows on the cuticle\r\nof _H. diesingi_ (Hoffman, 1953). The bacterium apparently is only\r\nanchored to the nematode and probably obtains its food from the\r\nintestinal contents of the cockroach.

He\r\nconcluded that the scorpion detected the cockroach by means of the\r\npectines. However, Cloudsley-Thompson (1955) has demonstrated that the\r\nmain function of the pectines is probably the detection of ground\r\nvibrations. He accounted for Pocock's observation by the presence of\r\nsensory spines (presumably tactile) which project from beneath the\r\npectines. In a house in Arizona, Lyon (1951) observed over 60 scorpions\r\nliving in a kitchen cabinet that enclosed a sink. They were apparently\r\nthriving on a heavy infestation of cockroaches. Stahnke (1953) stated\r\nthat he used _Periplaneta americana_ as the principal food for scorpions\r\nat the Poisonous Animals Research Laboratory of Arizona State College.\r\nCloudsley-Thompson (1955a) cited cockroaches as one of the arthropods\r\nthat scorpions feed upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily BUTHIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Buthus australis= (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Androctonus australis_ [Crabill, personal communication,\r\n1957].\r\n\r\n_Experimental prey._--Cockroaches, England (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1955a):\r\nThis African species ate at least one cockroach per week during the\r\nsummer months.

The scorpion ate all the soft parts and most of the\r\nsclerotized exoskeleton.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder ARANEIDA\r\n\r\nMany observations of spiders feeding on cockroaches are quite general,\r\nand many observers have failed to identify either the spider or its\r\nprey. Belt (1874) stated that \"the cockroaches that infest houses in the\r\ntropics ... have numerous enemies--birds, rats, scorpions, and spiders.\"\r\nWhen Belt tried to drive a cockroach toward a large cockroach-eating\r\nspider, the insect rushed away from him until it came within a foot of\r\nthe spider when it would double back, never advancing nearer.\r\n\r\nBeebe (1925) watched a giant \"wood roach,\" which was in the grasp of a\r\n2-inch ctenid spider, fly through the window of his British Guiana\r\nlaboratory. While the spider ate the cockroach, the insect gave birth to\r\n51 nymphs. Sonan (1924) reported that large gray spiders devour nymphs\r\nand adults of _Periplaneta americana_ and _P. australasiae_ in Formosa;\r\nthis spider also occurs on Hiyakejima Island and Okinawa. Passmore\r\n(1936), who has produced some excellent photographs of tarantulas,\r\nstated that they destroy cockroaches. Rau (1940) stated that American\r\nand oriental cockroaches were the principal item of diet of a friend's\r\npet tarantula for several years. Kaston (personal communication, 1953)\r\nsuccessfully fed a tarantula with _Periplaneta americana_.\r\n\r\nBristowe (1941) found that the British species of _Ectobius_ are readily\r\naccepted by _Xysticus_, _Clubiona_, _Drassodes_, _Zelotes_, _Tarantula_,\r\nand the web-builders _Ciniflo_ and _Aranea_. The British domestic\r\ncockroaches were accepted by _Tegenaria_ and _Ciniflo_, spiders large\r\nenough to overpower them, and were useful as food for tropical\r\navicularids, ctenids, and sparassids in captivity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily THERAPHOSIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Avicularia avicularia= (Linnaeus) and =Avicularia= sp.?\r\n\r\n_Common name._--Bird-eating spider.\r\n\r\n_Natural prey._--_Periplaneta americana_, Trinidad (Main, 1924, 1930):\r\nThe remains of the host were compressed into globular form by the spider\r\nafter it had extracted the nutritive parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Phormictopus cancerides= (Latreille)\r\n\r\n_Experimental prey._--Cockroach, West Indies (Wolcott, 1953).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily SPARASSIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heteropoda venatoria= (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Heteropoda regia_ Fabricius.\r\n\r\n_Common names._--Banana spider (Comstock, 1912); huntsman spider\r\n(Gertsch, 1949); big brown house spider (Bryan, 1915).\r\n\r\n_Natural and experimental prey._--Cockroaches, Bermuda (Verrill, 1902);\r\nPuerto Rico (Sein, 1923; Wolcott, 1924a; Petrunkevitch, 1930a); Hawaii\r\n(Bryan, 1915, Williams et al., 1931); British Guiana (Moore _in_\r\nWilliams et al., 1931); Panama (Gertsch, 1949); New Zealand (adventive)\r\n(Parrott, 1952); England (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1953); Comstock (1912);\r\nHawaii (Pemberton, 1917).\r\n\r\nThis (pl. 30, A) is a tropical species frequently imported into northern\r\nlocalities with bunches of bananas (Comstock, 1912; Cloudsley-Thompson,\r\n1953). Adults measure 3 to 4 inches across with bodies over an inch\r\nlong. They seldom leave their resting places during the day, but are\r\nactive at night and search for food. The female does not spin a web\r\n(Bryan, 1915; Gertsch, 1949). The spider turns the cockroach over onto\r\nits back at the instant of seizure and holds it firmly against the\r\nsubstrate. The cockroach dies in 10 minutes and is gradually rolled up\r\nby the spider as it sucks out the nutriment (Moore _in_ Williams et al.,\r\n1931). The spider does not attempt to bite when captured, but if it\r\ndoes, its bite is said to be painful but not dangerous\r\n(Cloudsley-Thompson, 1953). Zimmerman (1948) found scores of\r\n_Periplaneta australasiae_ breeding in rock piles in Hawaii; also\r\npresent were large numbers of these spiders and centipedes which\r\npresumably preyed upon the cockroaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily THERIDIIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Latrodectus indistinctus= Pickard-Cambridge\r\n\r\n_Common name._--Button spider.\r\n\r\n_Natural prey._--_Karnyia discoidalis_, South Africa, Western Cape\r\nProvince (Hesse, 1942): The nest is constructed on the ground among\r\ngrass stems or other vegetation. Preferred sites are slight hollows,\r\nhoof imprints, etc. Nests are roughly tubular. The remains of insects\r\nare entangled in the walls of the nest where they form dense\r\naccumulations. Predatory activities of the spider are limited to an area\r\nclose to the tubular entrance to the nest and do not extend beyond the\r\ntrapping strands near the entrance. Capture is dependent upon accidental\r\ncontact of the insect with sticky threads surrounding the entrance. This\r\nspider apparently attacks any insect or arachnid that becomes entangled\r\nin the nest. In an examination of 40 nests, remains of 6 _K.\r\ndiscoidalis_ were found.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Latrodectus mactans= (Fabricius)\r\n\r\n_Common names._--Black widow, hourglass, or shoe-button spider.\r\n\r\n_Natural prey._--Cockroaches, Puerto Rico (Petrunkevitch, 1930).

Camin (personal\r\ncommunication, 1955) this is a new genus and new species in the\r\nsubfamily Diplogyniinae, and is most closely related to the genus\r\n_Lobogynioides_. Mites of this family live as ectoparasites and\r\ncommensals on beetles and possibly other insects (Baker and Wharton,\r\n1952).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily ANOETIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Histiostoma feroniarum= (Dufour)\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, Germany (Roeser, 1940):\r\nThough not parasitic, the mites at times became so numerous that the\r\ninsects were hindered in their movement, were unable to feed, and died.\r\nThe mites were introduced with soil and leaves and had originally been\r\nattached to millipedes, waterfleas, and sowbugs.\r\n\r\nThe deutonymphs, hypopial forms, or travelers are found on insects; the\r\nother stages are found in decaying organic matter (Baker and Wharton,\r\n1952).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily ACARIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Caloglyphus spinitarsus= (Hermann)\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, Germany (Roeser, 1940): See\r\nnotes following _Histiostoma feroniarum_ above.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Caloglyphus= sp.\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Blattella germanica_ and _Periplaneta americana_,\r\nU.S.A.

Although this mite was found on the cockroach, it\r\nis a known pest in stored foods (Baker and Wharton, 1952) and probably\r\nwas brought into the culture with food. Rau (1924) reported that the\r\nfood of _Blatta orientalis_ often became infested with this species, but\r\nit did not affect the health or mortality of the cockroaches in his\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tyrophagus noxius= A.

Mites were found in the oöthecal cavity of a\r\nfemale cockroach that had been isolated for her entire adult life. The\r\nmites were in a closely packed mass behind a plug of what appeared to be\r\nfeces, disintegrated eggs, and dried blood; none of the mites were\r\nvisible until this plug was removed. Baker (personal communication,\r\n1953) stated that the mite is probably not parasitic and that species of\r\nthe genus feed on organic matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rhizoglyphus tarsalus= Banks\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A.

W. Baker (personal communication, 1954). The mites cluster thickly on\r\nintersegmental membranes, particularly around the coxae and neck.\r\nDespite a heavy infestation, the colony of _Nauphoeta_ thrived for\r\nseveral years. This mite was found first on _N. cinerea_ and possibly\r\ntransferred to _D. punctata_ when the latter was brought into the\r\nlaboratory from Hawaii.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily IOLINIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Iolina nana= Pritchard\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Blaberus craniifer_ (originally from a culture at\r\nHarvard University) and _Diploptera punctata_ (originally from Hawaii),\r\nU.S.A., Pennsylvania (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1953;\r\nPritchard, 1956): The mites usually attached near the wing bases of the\r\ninsects. Morphologically, the species is intermediate between certain\r\npredaceous and phytophagous mites (Pritchard, 1956).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily PTERYGOSOMIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pimeliaphilus podapolipophagus= Trägårdh\r\n\r\n_Common name._--Cockroach mite.\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Parcoblatta_ sp., U.S.A.

(Cunliffe, 1952).\r\n\r\nEggs of this mite (fig. 4) are usually laid indiscriminately in the\r\nrearing cages, rarely on the host. Eggs are coated with a sticky\r\nsecretion which enables those laid on the host to adhere. Hatching\r\noccurs in 6-11 days at 90-95° F., and in 9-11 days at 80° F. The newly\r\nhatched larva starts to feed immediately on the cockroach. Larval stage\r\nlasts 4-6 days, rests 2-3 days, and molts. During the single nymphal\r\ninstar, the mite feeds on the host and moves about for 6-7 days. The\r\nmite then rests 3-4 days before molting. Entire life cycle covers a\r\nperiod of 28-32 days. Adult mite lives 2-3 weeks, during which time it\r\ncan produce 2-3 batches of from 1 to 20 eggs; the usual batch is about\r\n12 eggs. The mites are unable to live on cockroach feces, cast skins, or\r\ndead cockroaches. Mites died within 4-5 days unless live cockroaches\r\nwere supplied. Parasitism was proved by detecting radioactivity in mites\r\nthat had fed on cockroaches which had been previously fed radioactive\r\nNaCl (Cunliffe, 1952).\r\n\r\nThe mites can destroy laboratory cultures of cockroaches (Piquett and\r\nFales, 1952; Edmunds, 1953a). A cockroach attacked by 25 mites succumbed\r\nafter about an hour, falling on its back; it died after 5 hours\r\n(Cunliffe, 1952).\r\n\r\nWhen found in homes and offices, these mites are an indication of the\r\npresence of cockroaches; the mite has been twice accused of biting\r\npeople (Baker et al., 1956).\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORDS OF UNIDENTIFIED MITES\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Aglaopteryx facies_, Puerto Rico (Seín, 1923): Four\r\nred \"tick\" nymphs found under wings of female.\r\n\r\n_Blaberus craniifer_, U.S.A., Florida (Hebard, 1917): \"A number of lice\r\n[mites] are present on many of these specimens [28[F][F]].\"\r\n\r\n_Blaberus discoidalis_, adventive from West Indies, taken in Scotland\r\n(Stewart, 1925): A considerable number of mites were all over the body\r\nand hind wings.\r\n\r\n_Blatta orientalis_, Germany (Cornelius, 1853): Ex sexual organs of\r\nmale.\r\n\r\n_Blattella germanica_, U.S.A., in laboratory (Parker, 1939): Under\r\nconditions of high humidity, the cockroaches became heavily infested\r\nwith mites. In cages where the infestation was heavy, an abnormally\r\nlarge number of females dropped their oöthecae, and the percentage of\r\neggs hatching was low.\r\n\r\n_Parcoblatta uhleriana_, U.S.A., North Carolina (Hatcher, 1939): Hypopi\r\nof mites were found deeply embedded in the fat body of two individuals.\r\n\r\nMites in the hypopial stage attach to insects by which they are\r\ndispersed. Hypopi have been found in the gill chambers of a mollusk and\r\nin the gonads of a millipede (Baker and Wharton, 1952).\r\n\r\n_Periplaneta americana_, U.S.A., in laboratory (Fisk, 1951): The insects\r\nwere sluggish and molted with difficulty. Gold Coast Colony (Macfie,\r\n1922): Larvae of a tarsonemid mite were found in the feces.\r\n\r\n_Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, Hawaii (Illingworth, 1915): During the\r\nsummer the soil was literally swarming with young of various stages.\r\nEarly in September most of the adults were dead and all were covered\r\nwith mites.

(Ealand, 1915): Cockroaches may carry the hypopial\r\nstage of the cheese mite.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROL OF MITES IN COCKROACH COLONIES\r\n\r\nFisk (1951) eliminated the mites [possibly _Pimeliaphilus\r\npodapolipophagus_ (Baker et al., 1956)] in his cockroach colony by using\r\na 5-percent spray and a 5-percent dust of p-chlorophenyl,\r\np-chlorobenzene sulfonate. The exterior of the cockroach containers were\r\nsprayed with the solution and the interior, including the insects, were\r\ndusted. Within a month the mites had disappeared and the vigor of the\r\ncockroach colony improved. Piquett and Fales (1952) used flowers of\r\nsulfur and general sanitary procedures for eliminating the mites in\r\nlaboratory colonies of _Blatta orientalis_; they cleaned the dishes\r\nevery few days and applied grease around the edges of the containers to\r\nprevent new mite invasions. Qadri (1938) employed similar control\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass CHILOPODA\r\n\r\nLarge centipedes which entered houses in India probably sought out\r\ncockroaches (Maxwell-Lefroy, 1909). In Puerto Rico, centipedes entered\r\nhomes to which they were attracted by cockroaches (Seín, 1923). In\r\nHawaii, centipedes preyed on insects generally but especially on\r\ncockroaches (Bryan, 1915). Sonan (1924) reported that in Formosa and\r\nOkinawa Islands a species of centipede 5 to 6 inches long comes into the\r\nhouses and devours both adults and nymphs of _Periplaneta americana_ or\r\n_P. australasiae_. Zimmerman (1948) found _P. australasiae_ breeding by\r\nscores in rock piles in Hawaii accompanied by large numbers of\r\n_Scolopendra_ and large spiders that probably preyed upon the\r\ncockroaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder SCUTIGEROMORPHA\r\n\r\nFamily SCUTIGERIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scutigera coleoptrata= (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Scutigera forceps_ Rafinesque [Crabill, 1952].\r\n\r\n_Common name._--House centipede.\r\n\r\n_Natural prey._--Cockroaches, U.S.A.

Before it had finished its meal, it caught and held two other\r\nnymphs with its legs while it continued to feed on the first. The body\r\nof this centipede reaches a maximum length of 27 mm. and it is usually\r\nfound in basements, dark corners, or in spaces in the walls (Auerbach,\r\n1951).

The predator continued to hold the prey with its fangs while its\r\nmouth parts prodded the victim's body. After feeding on an adult\r\ncockroach, the centipede is not inclined to kill another for 2-3 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scolopendra subspinipes= Leach\r\n\r\n_Natural prey._--Cockroaches, Hawaii (Williams et al., 1931): This is a\r\ncommon species with a body length of 6 or more inches.

All the mantids initially rejected _N. rhombifolia_ after\r\ngrasping and making a brief attempt to chew the cockroaches. However, if\r\nspecimens of _N. rhombifolia_ were left in the jars with the mantids,\r\nthe cockroaches were usually eaten within the next 24 hours. _N.\r\nrhombifolia_ ejects an odorous substance when seized and the mantids\r\nprobably ate these insects after most of this secretion had been\r\ndepleted. It is highly probable that the secretion of _N. rhombifolia_\r\nmay deter the mantid's attack, but it should be pointed out that, with\r\nthe possible exception of _N. cinerea_, all the other species fed to\r\nthese mantids give off odorous substances when seized or disturbed.\r\nApparently, certain naturally repellent compounds will deter this\r\nmantid, whereas others that are presumed to be repellent will not;\r\nhowever, the nutritional state of the mantid is undoubtedly a factor\r\nwhich may limit the effectiveness of certain repellent secretions\r\nagainst this predator.\r\n\r\n_Byrsotria fumigata_, teneral males, and _Periplaneta australasiae_,\r\nnymphs, U.S.A.

[Selander, 1957].\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Platyzosteria castanea_, Australia Capital Territory\r\n(Riek, 1955).\r\n\r\n_Biology of Australian Ripidiini._--The Australian species of Ripidiini\r\nare parasites of apparently endemic, ground-dwelling species of\r\ncockroaches. There is some correlation between host subfamily and\r\nparasite genus: _Riekella_ spp. [= _Nephrites_] have only been bred from\r\nBlattinae. _Rhipidioides_ spp. occur only in the closely related\r\nEctobiinae and Pseudomopinae. _Neonephrites_ and _Neorhipidius_ also\r\noccur in the Pseudomopinae. _Paranephrites_ occurs in the Panchlorinae.\r\nThere is some evidence that the parasitized cockroaches migrate onto\r\ntrees when the larval parasite is mature, as pupae have only been found\r\non the trunks of eucalyptus trees. In all species the larva leaves the\r\nhost dorsally through an intersegmental membrane. The host continues to\r\nlive for a few days after the parasite emerges. The larva attaches\r\nitself to bark on the tree trunk by a few strands of silk before\r\npupating. The larviform, wingless female remains near the pupal skin and\r\nis sought out by the winged male. The eggs are laid in a mass around the\r\npupal skin (Riek, 1955).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ripidius[5] boissyi= Abeille\r\n\r\nBalduf (1935) lists _Ripidius boissyi_ as parasitic on nymphs of\r\n_Ectobius pallidus_ giving Abeille de Perrin (1909) as a source for\r\nthis information. However, Abeille de Perrin simply presumed that _R.\r\nboissyi_ parasitized _E. pallidus_ because he collected this cockroach\r\nin the same habitat as the beetle. Abeille de Perrin suggested that the\r\nspecies of the genus _Ripidius_ lived in the bodies of cockroaches, but\r\nthere are no rearing records, as far as we know, of _R. boissyi_ from\r\ncockroach hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ripidius denisi= Chobaut\r\n\r\nChobaut (1919), in France, collected both _R. denisi_ and _Ectobius\r\npallidus_ when beating an oak tree. Because of the known association of\r\nother species of _Ripidius_ with cockroaches, he presumed that this\r\nbeetle was parasitic on _E. pallidus_, a cockroach common in this\r\nbeetle's habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ripidius pectinicornis= Thunberg\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Symbius blattarum_ Sundevall [Leng, 1920].\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Blattella germanica_, on shipboard (Sundevall, 1831);\r\nGermany (Aclogue and Fowler, _in_ Burr, 1899a); on steamship \"Samui\"\r\n(Stamm, 1936); on cruiser \"Duguay-Trouin\" (Barbier, 1947); Hawaii\r\n(Williams, 1946a): This last record was based on a specimen dissected\r\nfrom an adult German cockroach collected on an airplane from the South\r\nPacific. The parasite was reported as _Ripidius_ sp. by Williams, but\r\nWeber (1948) made the specific identification.\r\n\r\n_Ectobius pallidus_? Abeille de Perrin (1909) stated that _R.\r\npectinicornis_ was first described by Sunders [sic] as _blattarum_\r\nbecause it had been captured in the body of _Ectobia livida_. We presume\r\nthat Abeille de Perrin was referring to Sundevall's work in which the\r\nhost was given as _Blattella germanica_.\r\n\r\n_Periplaneta americana_, on shipboard (Sundevall, 1831): One nymph only.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the single nymph of _P. americana_, _R.\r\npectinicornis_ apparently attacks only adult females and nymphs of _B.\r\ngermanica_. Barbier (1947) found only _B. germanica_ parasitized,\r\nalthough both _Blatta orientalis_ and _Supella supellectilium_ were\r\nprevalent on board the ship. Primary larvae of the parasite failed to\r\nparasitize _Supella_.\r\n\r\n_Adult behavior._--The winged male is relatively active compared to the\r\napterous female; it runs around, flies well, and jumps on the female\r\nwhen in her vicinity. The female remains stationary and lays eggs around\r\nher by bending her long ovipositor (Sundevall, 1831). The eggs (50-100)\r\nare laid among a network of silk fibers secreted by the female. The\r\nfemale dies after completing oviposition (Barbier, 1947).\r\n\r\n_Development._--The eggs hatch after 14 days, and the primary\r\n(triungulin) larvae ascend the host's legs to its body; the larvae then\r\ncut the intersegmental membrane between the metasternum and first\r\nabdominal segment of the cockroach, in order to enter the host's abdomen\r\n(Barbier, 1947). Chobaut (1892) first suggested this method of attack by\r\nthe ripiphorid larva. As the parasites develop, the abdomen of the host\r\nbecomes swollen. Developing larvae apparently eat the host's fat body,\r\nleaving the vital organs until the last. Parasitized female hosts were\r\nsterile and the eggs, when formed, never hatched. Development of the\r\noötheca was also inhibited. There were usually two larval parasites per\r\nhost, but three or four were found several times (Barbier, 1947).\r\nSundevall (1831) found only one larva per cockroach except one host\r\nwhich, when crushed, yielded five. Stamm (1936) found three hosts\r\ninfested with five larvae each. In a little over 100 cockroaches, Stamm\r\nfound 10 that were parasitized.\r\n\r\nThe day before the parasite leaves the host, the cockroach shows an\r\nabrupt uneasiness and runs about, finally falling over on its back. The\r\nparasite larva emerges from the host through an opening it makes in the\r\nmembrane between penultimate and last tergite. The host dies a few hours\r\nafter the larva has left. The larva seeks a sheltered area and pupates\r\nwithin 48 hours. Adults emerge in 9 days (females) and 13 days (males)\r\n(Barbier, 1947).\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--Adult males have been collected in light traps in\r\nHawaii (Van Zwaluenburg, 1946), and the first female was reported by\r\nWeber (1948); the parasite is now established in the islands around\r\nPearl Harbor (Dr. F. X. Williams, personal communication, 1953). The U.\r\nS. National Museum has specimens of _R. pectinicornis_ from England,\r\nGuatemala, Hawaii, Panama, and from Florida and Georgia in the U. S.\r\n(Dr. E. A. Chapin, personal communication, 1953). Kono (_in_ Asano,\r\n1937) reported two species in Japan. It is noteworthy that all these\r\nrecords are from localities adjacent to oceans and on ships; none are\r\nfrom interiors of continents. The only biological data were obtained\r\nfrom parasites found on board ships. Sundevall (1831) believed that the\r\nparasites boarded his ship with their hosts during loading in Calcutta,\r\nsince before that not any were seen on board. Barbier (1947) suggested\r\nthat the parasite must be spread very easily in ports between\r\nneighboring ships by parasitized cockroaches in baskets or sacks of\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ripidius scutellaris= Heller\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--Blattidae, Philippine Islands (Schultze, 1925).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily DERMESTIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dermestes ater= De Geer\r\n\r\n_Common name._--Black larder beetle.\r\n\r\n_Natural prey._--_Blatta orientalis_, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis,\r\nunpublished data, 1953): _Dermestes ater_ is generally a scavenger, but\r\nwe have seen adult beetles, which had developed in our cockroach colony,\r\nclinging to and feeding on living oriental cockroaches, eventually\r\nkilling them; the beetles probably attack only the weakened or injured\r\ncockroaches in a culture. This was a natural infestation of a laboratory\r\nculture by a predator.\r\n\r\n_Experimental prey._--_Blattella germanica_, oöthecae, U.S.A. (Roth and\r\nWillis, 1950): The beetle larvae can penetrate unhatched oöthecae of the\r\nGerman but not those of the American or oriental cockroaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dermestes= sp.\r\n\r\n_Natural prey._--_Blatta orientalis_, oöthecae, U.S.A., Missouri: Rau\r\n(1924) stated that _Dermestes_ larvae often infest the egg cases of this\r\ncockroach; it is probable that Rau was referring to cockroaches in\r\nlaboratory cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder STREPSIPTERA\r\n\r\nPierce (1909) predicted that the Blattoidea and the Grylloidea would be\r\nthe only groups of the Orthoptera which would be parasitized by\r\nStrepsiptera. Essig (1926) made the statement that certain cockroaches\r\nare among the hosts of Strepsiptera. E. F. Riek (personal communication,\r\n1952) found a strepsipteron in a late nymph of _Cutilia_ sp. from\r\nWaroona, Western Australia; he wrote us, \"The female parasite is\r\nextruded between a pair of sternites towards the base of the abdomen and\r\nappears to belong to the family Halictophagidae.\" This is the only\r\nrecord that we have been able to find of a strepsipteron parasitizing\r\ncockroaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder HYMENOPTERA\r\n\r\n\r\nPREDATORS AND PARASITES OF COCKROACH EGGS\r\n\r\nWasps from at least six families of Hymenoptera have been recorded as\r\ndeveloping on cockroach eggs. All the Evaniidae are presumed to be\r\nparasitic in the egg capsules of cockroaches (Clausen, 1940; Townes,\r\n1951), although hosts for many of the described species have yet to be\r\ndiscovered. The presence of evaniids in dwellings indicates the presence\r\nof cockroaches (Gross, 1950). At times these wasps may become a\r\nnuisance; a family in Worthington, Ohio, complained of the evaniid wasps\r\nthat they found on the windows and in other areas of their home, but\r\nthey were apparently not annoyed by the oriental cockroaches in the\r\nbasement (Edmunds, 1953).\r\n\r\nThe known parasites of cockroach eggs are listed below with summaries of\r\ntheir biology.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily EVANIIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Acanthinevania princeps= (Westwood)\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Evania princeps_ [Dr. H.

Great Britain (Blair, 1952): This is\r\na presumptive record. The wasp was collected at Niton and Headon Hill,\r\nIsle of Wight, an area in which this variety of _E. panzeri_ was the\r\nonly species of cockroach known to occur.\r\n\r\n_Ectobius_ sp., England (Cameron, 1955, 1957): Natural History Museum\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nAdult wasps have been collected on _Asparagus officinalis_ Linnaeus\r\n(Schmiedeknecht _in_ Schletterer, 1889; Crosskey, 1951). Thompson's\r\n(1951) citation of records of _B. minutus_ and _Evania appendigaster_\r\nfrom _Blatta orientalis_ and _Blattella germanica_, and Cameron's (1957)\r\ncitation of these records and one from _Ectobius lapponicus_, all\r\nattributed to Kadocsa (1921), are almost certainly in error. Kadocsa\r\n(1921, p. 33) listed these wasps as egg parasites of cockroaches but not\r\nnecessarily in Hungary and did not name specific cockroach hosts.\r\n\r\nThe present writers have found no information, other than host reports,\r\non the biology of _Brachygaster minutus_. The records of this wasp\r\nparasitizing _B. germanica_ may trace back to Schletterer, but his\r\nlisting may not have been an original observation. Since the female of\r\n_B. germanica_ carries its oötheca attached to the abdomen until or just\r\nbefore the eggs hatch, it would seem that the female of _B. minutus_ (if\r\nthe host records are valid) must oviposit into the oötheca of this\r\nspecies while it is still being carried by the female; this would not\r\nnecessarily be true for the other hosts which drop the egg case long\r\nbefore the eggs hatch.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--Europe: Sweden, Russia, England, France, Germany,\r\nAustria, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy (Kieffer, 1920).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Evania appendigaster= (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Evania desjardinsii_ Bordage, _Evania laevigata_ Latreille\r\n[Dalla Torre, 1901-1902].\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Blatta_, \"exotic species\" (Westwood, 1854, 1954a).\r\n\r\n_Blatta orientalis_, Europe?

Later, after\r\nfinding that _L. maderae_ is ovoviviparous, Bordage (1913) admitted\r\nhaving misidentified a parasitized oötheca from some other species; he\r\nconcluded that the developing eggs of this species are protected against\r\negg parasites because they are carried within the female. Clausen\r\n(1940), in classifying the placement of parasitic wasp eggs in relation\r\nto the host, erected the category: Egg placed in the embryo while the\r\nlatter is still within the parent. He stated that although this behavior\r\nwas not definitely known to occur, it probably could occur.

(Haber, 1920).\r\n\r\nRelatively little detailed information was known about this wasp (fig.\r\n5), one of the earliest parasites of cockroach eggs to be discovered,\r\nuntil Cameron (1957) studied its biology. Arnold (Kirby and Spence,\r\n1826) discovered that the genus _Evania_ parasitized _Blatta_, but did\r\nnot know whether the wasp developed on the cockroach eggs or in the\r\nnymphs. MacLeay (Westwood, 1843) determined that _Evania_ developed\r\nwithin the oöthecae of cockroaches. Westwood (1854a) found the larvae,\r\npupae, and adults of _E. appendigaster_ in egg cases of an unidentified\r\nspecies of cockroach found on orchids received from Calcutta.\r\n\r\n_Adult behavior._--Adult wasps visited flowers of parsley, _Petroselium\r\ncrispum_, and fennel, _Foeniculum vulgare_ (Margretti _in_ Schletterer,\r\n1886; Crosskey, 1951). In Hawaii the adult wasps have been seen resting\r\non leaves coated with honey dew (Williams et al., 1931); _Evania_ sp.\r\nwere attracted to the honey dew secreted by a diaspine scale insect\r\n(Williams, 1931). Adults lived two to three weeks in captivity with\r\nample food and water (Cameron, 1957).\r\n\r\n_Oviposition._--Shelford (1912, 1916) erroneously supposed that\r\n_Evania_, by means of her cleaverlike abdomen, opened the oötheca at the\r\ncrista and then deposited her egg or eggs on the eggs of the cockroach.\r\nHaber (1920) observed and described oviposition. The female wasp\r\ncrawled over the surface of the oötheca, actively vibrating her\r\nantennae, and settled with the axis of her body parallel to the axis of\r\nthe egg case as it lay upon its right side. Lying on her right side, the\r\nwasp extended her ovipositor and punctured the oötheca in the fifth cell\r\non the left side; she remained in this position for about 15 minutes.\r\nCameron (1957) described similar oviposition behavior that lasted about\r\nhalf an hour. Kieffer (1912) and Crosskey (1951) stated that the female\r\ndeposits her eggs before the walls of the oötheca harden.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--_Evania appendigaster._ Left, dorsal view, × 8.\r\n  Right, side view, × 5. (Reproduced with permission. British Museum\r\n  [Natural History], 1951, figs. 1A and 1B.)]\r\n\r\n_Development._--Kieffer (1912) stated that the larvae in this family eat\r\nthe cockroach eggs and pupate in the oötheca without forming a cocoon.\r\nSmith (1945) stated that the larva feeds on one cockroach egg after\r\nanother until all are destroyed; by that time it is full grown and it\r\npupates within the oötheca. Cameron (1957) found that there are five\r\nlarval instars and that in material from Saudi Arabia there are three or\r\npossibly four generations a year.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--Tropical and subtropical parts of the world as far\r\nnorth as New York City, and all of Europe except the northern part\r\n(Kieffer, 1920; Townes, 1949). The wide distribution of _Evania_ has\r\nbeen attributed to the abundance of host cockroaches on ships between\r\nthe Tropics (Haldeman, 1847). Kieffer (1903) appears to have shown some\r\ncorrelation between the numbers of species of cockroaches found in\r\nvarious geographical regions and the numbers of species of evaniids\r\nfound in similar regions. However, the number of blattids he listed is\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Evania dimidiata= Fabricius\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Evania abyssinica_ Westwood [Schletterer, 1889].\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Blatta orientalis_, Egypt?

Townes, (personal communication, 1956) believes that\r\nthis wasp was probably either _H. reticulata_, _H. harpyoides_, or _H.\r\nthoracica_; it is not possible to tell which without reexamining\r\nAshmead's specimens; these apparently have been lost.\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, U.S.A., Mississippi\r\n(Ashmead, 1900).\r\n\r\n=Hyptia harpyoides= Bradley\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Parcoblatta virginica_, U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds, 1952a,\r\n1953a, 1954).\r\n\r\n_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, U.S.A.

The keel region of the oötheca of _P. uhleriana_ (pl.\r\n18, B) is different from that of any other species of _Parcoblatta_\r\n(Hebard, 1917; Lawson, 1954) so there can be no doubt as to the species\r\nof cockroach parasitized by this wasp.\r\n\r\n_Development._--The last instar larva overwinters inside the cockroach\r\noötheca (Edmunds, 1954). Five oöthecae yielded one parasite each\r\n(Edmunds, 1953a).\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--Canada, Ontario. U.S.A.: New Hampshire and Minnesota to\r\nSouth Carolina, Mississippi, Texas, and Kansas.

The insects were attracted to and fed on the flowers (Edmunds,\r\n1954).\r\n\r\n_Development._--Entire contents of oötheca are eaten by the single\r\nlarva. Last instar larva overwinters inside the oötheca. Emergence in\r\nOhio was around the middle of June. The emergence hole made by this\r\ngenus was about 2 mm. in diameter. The hole was made at the top side of\r\nthe oötheca near one end. Adult took about 65 minutes to emerge from the\r\ntime its mandibles first broke through the oöthecal wall.

Europe? (Girault 1907, 1914); Europe (Fahringer,\r\n1922). [The records on this host are extremely doubtful. Girault\r\nerroneously cited Marlatt (1902) as the source of this record; see\r\nfootnote 6, page 236. Fahringer, however, claimed that he obtained\r\nseven female parasites from oöthecae of _Blattella germanica_. He placed\r\nfemale parasites with adults of _B. germanica_ in a glass cage. As soon\r\nas oöthecae could be seen between folds of a woolen rag, he removed all\r\nthe larger cockroaches and held the oöthecae until the parasites\r\nemerged. Fahringer may have been dealing with a different species of\r\ncockroach, because placing oöthecae in crevices (or between folds of\r\nrag) is a habit foreign to _B. germanica_, the female of which usually\r\ncarries her oötheca until hatching or until about a day before. Edmunds\r\n(1953b) could not induce this wasp to parasitize eggs of _B.\r\ngermanica_.]\r\n\r\n_Periplaneta americana_, Istrian Peninsula (Fahringer, 1922); Palestine\r\n(Bodenheimer, 1930); U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds, 1952, 1953b, 1954).\r\n\r\n_Adult behavior._--The wasps (pl. 33, A) are very active; they walk\r\nabout a great deal and fly short distances. They are often found in\r\nabundance in buildings infested with the larger domiciliary cockroaches\r\nwhere they may reproduce for many generations without leaving the\r\npremises. Specimens have also been collected outdoors. (Edmunds, 1953,\r\n1954.) As the adult walks about, the laterally compressed abdomen moves\r\nup and down like a waving flag; because of this behavior, these insects\r\nare commonly known as ensign-flies. Cros (1942) maintained adults 17\r\ndays without food. Edmunds (1954) fed adults on unidentified flowers in\r\nthe laboratory. He also maintained them for 20 days after capture on a\r\n5-percent honey solution.\r\n\r\n_Oviposition._--A female _P. punctata_ selected oöthecae of _P.\r\namericana_ for oviposition and ignored those of _B. orientalis_ and\r\n_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ in the same cage. Oviposition was\r\naccomplished as described for _Evania appendigaster_. One oötheca was\r\nturned over onto its right side by the wasp before she oviposited.\r\n(Edmunds, 1952.) Although there seemed to be a \"preferred\" position for\r\noviposition, it was not obligatory. The usual position was for the\r\nfemale to face the keel of the oötheca, but she also oviposited from the\r\nopposite side or, rarely, directly down into the side of the oötheca.\r\nThe average time spent by females in 10 ovipositions was 29 minutes\r\n(range 16-62 minutes). The wasp apparently could not determine whether\r\nthe eggs had been previously parasitized. The wasp laid her egg between\r\nthe cockroach eggs rather than in them and she oviposited into oöthecae\r\nthat had just been dropped and those two weeks old or older. On three\r\noccasions nymphal cockroaches emerged within a few hours after the wasp\r\nhad oviposited. (Edmunds, 1954.) Apparently, for successful\r\nparasitization the wasp must oviposit before the cockroaches have\r\nreached the final stages of preemergence development. Edmunds (1954)\r\nplaced females of _Periplaneta americana_ that were carrying oöthecae,\r\ninto cages with _Prosevania_; some of the female wasps showed\r\nconsiderable interest in the attached oöthecae, but he observed\r\noviposition only into egg cases that had been dropped by the\r\ncockroaches.\r\n\r\nCros (1942) described an interesting reaction that he called\r\n\"instinctive hostility\" of the oriental cockroach toward _Prosevania_. A\r\nwasp was placed in a jar in which a cockroach had just deposited its\r\noötheca. The wasp tried to oviposit into the egg case but was upset and\r\npursued by the cockroach. The cockroach placed herself over the oötheca,\r\nstanding high on her legs, and remained there motionless. The wasp then\r\napproached from the rear, slipped under the cockroach, and, unnoticed by\r\nthe cockroach, climbed on the oötheca and oviposited successfully.\r\n\r\n_Development._--In _Blatta orientalis_: The developmental period was\r\ncompleted in 40-57 days in summer and fall (Cros, 1942). Time from\r\noviposition to emergence of adult varied from 45-177 days; three\r\nparthenotes from an oviposition by an unfertilized female wasp developed\r\nin 45-53 days (Edmunds, 1954). In _Blattella germanica_: Almost 4 weeks\r\nspent in development (Fahringer, 1922). In _Periplaneta americana_:\r\nThree wasps developed in 127 days (Edmunds, 1952). Only one parasite\r\ndevelops in each oötheca. There were three generations a year in Ohio.\r\n(Edmunds, 1954.) In Algeria there were two to three generations per\r\nyear. The adult emerged from the oötheca through a hole 4 mm. in\r\ndiameter. (Cros, 1942.) Parthenogenesis exists; the unfertilized eggs\r\nproduced only males (Edmunds, 1954).\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--Eastern U.S.A., from New York and Ohio south to Georgia\r\n(Townes, 1949).

Some oöthecae had four oviposition scars but\r\nnever contained more than two parasite eggs. _Development._--Larva\r\ncommences development in July or August. Only one larva completes\r\ndevelopment, but it eats all the eggs in the oötheca. The wasp passes\r\nthe winter as a last instar larva and pupates in the spring; the adult\r\nemerges during the spring or in June. _Hyperparasitism._--About 10\r\npercent of the oöthecae of _Loboptera decipiens_ that were parasitized\r\nby _Z. splendidula_ were also hyperparasitized by an eulophid (see\r\n_Syntomosphyrum ischnopterae_, p. 249).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily CLEONYMIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Agamerion metallica= Girault\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Ellipsidion australe_, Australia, Queensland (Dodd,\r\n1917): \"the parasite when ready to emerge fully occupies the whole space\r\nof the destroyed eggs.\"\r\n\r\nCockroach, Australia, New South Wales (Dr. B.

However,\r\nin the body of the paper, he states that the _supposed_ origin of the\r\nparasite was the oötheca of _B. germanica_. Burks (personal\r\ncommunication, 1956) does not believe that this wasp parasitizes the\r\neggs of _B. germanica_. We (unpublished data, 1957) exposed six oöthecae\r\nof _B. germanica_ to _C. merceti_. In order to retard water loss the\r\noöthecae were removed from the females by cutting the insects in two so\r\nthat each oötheca remained attached to the posterior part of the\r\nabdomen. No wasps developed in these oöthecae.\r\n\r\n_Supella supellectilium_, U.S.A., Kansas (Lawson, 1954a); Hawaii\r\n(Zimmerman, 1944; Compere, 1946; Keck, 1951).\r\n\r\n_Adult behavior._--Males and nonovipositing females showed a flea-like\r\njumping tendency. Adults were attracted to light and were found near\r\nwindows. Both sexes pursued an erratic course in walking and continually\r\ntouched the surface with their antennae. (Lawson, 1954a.)\r\n\r\n_Oviposition._--The wasp (pl. 34, B) selected a site on an oötheca with\r\nthe sheath of her ovipositor; it was uncertain whether there was a\r\ndefinite preference for oviposition sites. Wasp tended to choose a\r\nnearly horizontal position for oviposition. She preferred to oviposit\r\ninto eggs about 2 weeks old, although she would place eggs in oöthecae\r\nless than a week old and in embryos in the green band stage. There were\r\n1-50 oviposition punctures per oötheca. (Lawson, 1954a.)\r\n\r\n_Development._--If enough wasp larvae were present, they ate all eggs in\r\nan oötheca. Occasionally wasps developed in one end of an oötheca while\r\ncockroaches developed in the other; when this occurred, the cockroach\r\nnymphs always emerged last. The developmental period was 30-41 days at\r\nroom temperature. There were 5-25 parasites per oötheca. The single exit\r\nhole in the oötheca varied from 0.6 to 0.9 mm. in diameter. (Lawson,\r\n1954a.)\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--U.S.A.: New Jersey south to Florida, west to Illinois,\r\nKansas, and Arizona.

(Roth and Willis, 1954a).\r\n\r\n_Adult behavior._--Female wasps are sexually receptive almost\r\nimmediately on leaving the oötheca. Mating takes 3-4 seconds. Males mate\r\nrepeatedly and may fertilize several females; females may also mate more\r\nthan once. At about 80° F. the female wasps lived 2-4 days, males one\r\nday.\r\n\r\n_Oviposition._--The female wasp first probes the oötheca with her\r\nsheathed ovipositor until she finds an acceptable spot; she then drills\r\nthrough the wall of the oötheca with her ovipositor. One female\r\noviposited for 5 hours, but briefer periods were more usual. We have\r\nseen six or more females ovipositing simultaneously into an oötheca of\r\n_Eurycotis floridana_. One female was seen to feed on material that\r\noozed from the oviposition puncture. The wasp (pl. 34, A) may oviposit\r\ninto the oötheca of _E. floridana_ while it is still being carried by\r\nthe female, as well as in oöthecae that have been dropped and which have\r\nhard walls. Eggs 36 days old were successfully parasitized.\r\n\r\n_Development._--In _Eurycotis floridana_: In the laboratory, development\r\nwas completed in 34-36 days at about 85° F. This time was regulated to\r\nsome extent by the number of parasites in the oötheca.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that larvae eat unhatched wasp eggs or other larvae.\r\nIn 34 oöthecae exposed to many female wasps, the maximum number of\r\nparasites to emerge was 306; yet an average of 601 wasp larvae were\r\ndissected from four oöthecae that had each been exposed to 50 female\r\nwasps one week earlier. The larvae usually eat all the host eggs.\r\nCockroach eggs that were not eaten by the wasp larvae sometimes\r\ndeveloped but usually failed to hatch. Adult wasps made one to six\r\nemergence holes in the oötheca; the average number in 42 oöthecae was\r\ntwo holes.\r\n\r\n_Number of parasites per oötheca._--In _Blatta orientalis_: One of 111\r\noöthecae exposed to female wasps yielded 48 parasites. In _Eurycotis\r\nfloridana_: One oötheca parasitized in the field yielded 68 parasites; 8\r\noöthecae exposed to single wasps for their entire lifespan yielded an\r\naverage of 50 ± 6 parasites (range 23-81); 34 oöthecae exposed to many\r\nwasps for their entire lifespan yielded an average of 198 ± 8 parasites\r\n(range 93-306). In _Periplaneta americana_: Nine oöthecae of 152 exposed\r\nto the wasps were found to be parasitized when dissected; 11 adults\r\nemerged from one oötheca; no parasites emerged from the other 8\r\noöthecae.\r\n\r\n_Sex ratio._--4 [F][F]:1 [M] from ovipositions by isolated females. In\r\nthe one oötheca collected in the field, the ratio was 21.6 [F][F]:1 [M].\r\nParthenogenesis exists; the unfertilized eggs produced only males.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Anastatus tenuipes= Bolívar y Pieltain\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Anastatus blattidarum_ Ferrière. Dr. C. Ferrière (personal\r\ncommunication, 1957) is of the opinion that his _A. blattidarum_ is a\r\nsynonym of _A. tenuipes_. He stated \"I have never been able to see the\r\nunique type of _A. tenuipes_ B. y P., which is in Madrid, but the\r\ndescription agrees with _A. blattidarum_. I had not yet knowledge of\r\nBolívar's description, when describing my species. The parasite of\r\ncockroaches eggs [_Supella supellectilium_] should be called _A.\r\ntenuipes_ Bol.\" Mani (1938) synonymized _Solindenia blattiphagus_ Mani\r\nwith _Anastatus blattidarum_.\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Supella supellectilium_, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan\r\n(Ferrière, 1930, 1935); U.S.A., Arizona (Flock, 1941); Egypt (Alfieri,\r\n_in_ Hafez and Afifi, 1956).

The female licks up the drop of\r\nfluid that oozes from the oviposition puncture. Females die in a few\r\ndays, but if fed honey and water may live two weeks. _Oviposition._--The\r\nfemale selects an oötheca by feeling with her antennae. Flock stated,\r\nwithout citing experimental evidence, that the age of the egg case was\r\napparently the chief factor determining choice. The wasp took 15-45\r\nminutes to oviposit. Three females oviposited simultaneously into a\r\nsingle oötheca; a single female repeatedly oviposited into one oötheca\r\nat intervals. _Development._--Completed in an average of 32.6 days at a\r\nconstant temperature of 82° F.\r\n\r\n_Number of parasites per oötheca._--Average about 10.7 (range 4-16)\r\n(Flock, 1941); 15 (Ferrière, 1935).\r\n\r\n_Sex ratio._--4 [F][F]:1 [M] (Ferrière, 1935); average of 6 [F][F]:1 [M]\r\n(Flock, 1941).

[This host is undoubtedly an error. Sells stated that the oötheca\r\nwhich contained 96 unidentified chalcids had 16 dentations at the edge;\r\nthe description fits the oötheca of an oviparous cockroach and not that\r\nof _L. maderae_ (see Roth and Willis, 1954). Westwood (1839, footnote p.\r\n423) stated that at the meeting of the Entomological Society in 1838 Mr.\r\nSells exhibited 94 specimens of a small _Pteromalus_ (apparently\r\nidentified by Westwood) obtained from one cockroach oötheca.

(Roth and Willis, 1954b): We have\r\nmaintained _T. hagenowii_ for over two years through more than 30\r\ngenerations on eggs of both _B. orientalis_ and _P. americana_.\r\n\r\n_Periplaneta fuliginosa_, U.S.A., Pennsylvania (Roth and Willis, 1954b);\r\nMassachusetts (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1957).\r\n\r\nSchmidt (1937) deduced that _T. hagenowii_ was a primary parasite of\r\neggs of _P. americana_ because the parasitized oötheca was obtained from\r\na cage covered with screen too fine to permit entry of a larger\r\nparasite, such as an evaniid. As noted above, we have reared _T.\r\nhagenowii_ for more than 30 generations on cockroach eggs, none of which\r\nwas ever exposed to parasitization by an evaniid. If _T. hagenowii_ were\r\never hyperparasitic on _Evania_, this relationship would be accidental,\r\nthe eulophid happening to oviposit into an oötheca already containing an\r\nevaniid, or vice versa.\r\n\r\n_Adult behavior._--The male mates soon after becoming adult; he mounts\r\nthe female from behind, grasps her antennae with his own antennae, and\r\nvibrates his wings during copulation. Mating is accomplished in from\r\n\"several\" to 20 seconds (Takahashi, 1924; Edmunds, 1955). The adults are\r\npositively phototactic and are capable of hopping for some distance\r\n(Edmunds, 1955). The females feed on material that oozes through the\r\noviposition puncture (Roth and Willis, 1954b). Females lived 10 days\r\n(Seín, 1923). Without food, females lived 7.8 days and males 3.4 days,\r\nbut when fed dilute honey females lived 12.5 days (Usman, 1949). Females\r\nlived 5-11 days (Roth and Willis, 1954b). Fed water and sugar, the wasps\r\nlived 2-6 weeks at 65°F. (Cameron, 1955). Without food, 9 females lived\r\nan average of 3.5 days and 9 males an average of 1.7 days, but when fed\r\non raisins, 9 females lived an average of 25 days and 9 males 15 days\r\n(Edmunds, 1955). In Formosa there were six generations from April to\r\nDecember (Maki, 1937).\r\n\r\nIn Hawaii, Severin and Severin (1915) caught 571 _T. hagenowii_ in 10\r\nkerosene traps that were set up to sample populations of Mediterranean\r\nfruitfly. Apparently the parasite is attracted by the odor of kerosene.\r\n\r\n_Oviposition._--The female wasp explores the surface of the oötheca with\r\nvibrating antennae (Edmunds, 1955). She bends her abdomen ventrad and\r\nrepeatedly touches the surface of the oötheca with her valvae; when she\r\nfinds an acceptable oviposition site, the wasp unsheathes her ovipositor\r\nand bores through the wall of the oötheca (Roth and Willis, 1954b). The\r\nwasp deposited her eggs in 2-5 minutes (Edmunds, 1955). Wasps oviposited\r\n(pl. 34, C) into young or old eggs of _P. americana_ (Roth and Willis,\r\n1954b). A single wasp parasitized more than one oötheca and more than\r\none wasp oviposited into the same oötheca (Roth and Willis, 1954b;\r\nEdmunds, 1955). We found freshly laid wasp eggs in 34 empty but\r\npreviously parasitized oöthecae from which the wasps had emerged (Roth\r\nand Willis, 1954b).\r\n\r\n_Development._--In _Periplaneta americana_: Development is completed in\r\nan average of 36 days (range 29-58 days) (Maki, 1937); 29-40 days\r\n(Lever, 1943); average of 23.6 days (range 22-26 days) at 62°-85° F.\r\n(Usman, 1949); about 3 months at 60°-65° F. (Cameron, 1955); 31-60 days\r\nat 70°-80° F. (Edmunds, 1955). We found that the wasps completed\r\ndevelopment in 23-56 days at about 85° F., but the period depended on\r\nthe number of wasps in the oötheca; the larger the number of wasps (up\r\nto an average of about 70 wasps per oötheca), the shorter the time\r\nrequired to complete development. Wasps in oöthecae containing 70 or\r\nmore parasites developed in an average of about 32 days (Roth and\r\nWillis, 1954b). Wasp larvae eat the contents of the cockroach egg in\r\nwhich they start development, then rupture the chorion and attack\r\nadjoining eggs (Cameron, 1955; Edmunds, 1955). All eggs are consumed\r\nwhen the parasite density is high, but if too few larvae develop per\r\noötheca, some cockroach eggs survive and the embryos complete\r\ndevelopment (Roth and Willis, 1954b). However, a certain number of\r\ncockroach nymphs must complete development to enable the survivors to\r\nforce open the crista and emerge from the oötheca; fewer than this\r\nnumber of surviving nymphs will be trapped and killed as effectively as\r\nif they had been eaten by the parasite. The adult parasites emerge from\r\none to three holes cut through the wall of the oötheca (Usman, 1949;\r\nRoth and Willis, 1954b).\r\n\r\n_Number of offspring per female._--In _Blatta orientalis_: In the\r\nlaboratory, 5 oöthecae were left with each of 25 female wasps for their\r\nentire lifespans; of the 125 oöthecae, 32 were parasitized. The average\r\nnumber of offspring per female was 66 (range 5-164) (Roth and Willis,\r\n1954b). In _Periplaneta americana_: Each of 206 oöthecae was exposed to\r\na single female wasp for 24 hours; the average number of offspring per\r\nfemale was 103 (range 50-139). Five oöthecae were left with each of 38\r\nfemales for their entire lifespans; of the 190 oöthecae, 81 were\r\nparasitized. The average number of offspring per female was 94 (range\r\n45-168 [from original data]) (Roth and Willis, 1954b).\r\n\r\n_Number of parasites per oötheca._--In _Eurycotis floridana_: In the\r\nlaboratory, 3 oöthecae that had been exposed to 20 female wasps yielded\r\nan average of 648 parasites (range 606 [from original data] to 685)\r\n(Roth and Willis, 1954b). In _Neostylopyga rhombifolia_: One oötheca\r\nyielded 73 parasites (Pemberton, 1941). In _Parcoblatta_ sp.: Two\r\noöthecae yielded an average of 100 parasites (Edmunds, 1953a). In\r\n_Periplaneta americana_: 100 parasites per oötheca (Seín, 1923); 140\r\n(Schmidt, 1937); 25 (Rau, 1940a); 7-38, average 33 (Usman, 1949); 71\r\n(Wolcott, 1951); 4 oöthecae exposed to 20 female wasps yielded an\r\naverage of 204 wasps (range 164 [from original data] to 261) (Roth and\r\nWillis, 1954b); average of 30-40 (Cameron, 1955); 39 oöthecae yielded an\r\naverage of 93 parasites (range 12-187) (Edmunds, 1955). In _Periplaneta\r\naustralasiae_: Oöthecae yielded an average of 40-50 adult parasites\r\n(Cameron, 1955); about 50 (Shaw, 1925).\r\n\r\n_Sex ratio._--3 [F][F]:1 [M] (Usman, 1949); 4 [F][F]:1 [M] (Cameron,\r\n1955); 2-8 [F][F]:1 [M] (Roth and Willis, 1954b); 1.2 [F][F]:1 [M]\r\n(Edmunds, 1955). Parthenogenesis exists; the unfertilized eggs produced\r\nonly males (Roth and Willis, 1954b; Edmunds, 1955).\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--Probably worldwide.

II\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--Because of the war, Cros (1942) could not determine this\r\ninsect specifically. He designated it provisionally and with reserve\r\nunder the name _Eulophus_ sp. However, Burks (p. c., 1956) stated that\r\nthe species is most certainly a _Tetrastichus_ from the description\r\ngiven; but, it is apparently not _T. hagenowii_ because of its brilliant\r\nsteel-blue color.\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Blatta orientalis_, Algeria (Cros, 1942): _Adult\r\nbehavior._--Mating began as soon as wasps emerged from an oötheca. Males\r\nmated repeatedly. Adults lived up to 5 days in summer and up to 12 days\r\nin fall. There were up to four generations per year in the laboratory.\r\n_Oviposition._--Wasps oviposited into oöthecae 6, 22, 40, and 43 days\r\nold, and the parasites developed successfully. More than one female\r\noviposited into the same oötheca. Oviposition was of long duration.\r\n_Development._--From egg to eclosion took an average of 34 days in\r\nsummer (range: 30-38 days, 5 oöthecae), and an average of 67 days in\r\nfall (range: 58-73 days, 3 oöthecae). An average of 55 parasites\r\ndeveloped per oötheca (range 21-105, 5 oöthecae); over 130 wasps emerged\r\nfrom a sixth oötheca. _Sex ratio._--10-20 [F][F]:1 [M].\r\n\r\n\r\nHOST SELECTION BY EGG PARASITES\r\n\r\nThe nature of the oviposition stimulus(i) for the wasp parasites of\r\ncockroach eggs is unknown. Edmunds (1954) noted that _Prosevania\r\npunctata_ showed more interest in oöthecae that had been cemented to the\r\nsubstrate than in clean oöthecae that had simply been dropped. Cros\r\n(1942) experimented with two females of _P. punctata_ to see if the\r\nwasps could find oöthecae that had been buried in sand by the oriental\r\ncockroach. After prospecting the sand with their antennae, the wasps dug\r\ndeep excavations with their front legs but always mistook the location\r\nof the oöthecae. Cros suggested that the wasps were misled by the odor\r\nleft in the jar by the cockroaches. It is quite possible that odor helps\r\nthe wasp find the host oötheca.\r\n\r\nThe extent of host selection varies among these parasites; some species\r\nwill oviposit into the eggs of more than one species of cockroach, but\r\nothers show some degree of host specificity. Positive selection of\r\nspecific hosts by certain parasites appears in correlative data from\r\ndifferent investigators on pages 235 to 254. There is a small body of\r\ndata that shows nonacceptance of certain hosts by some of these wasps.\r\nFor example, _Comperia merceti_ would not parasitize eggs of _Blatta\r\norientalis_ or _Periplaneta americana_ in the laboratory (Lawson,\r\n1954a). We (unpublished data, 1957) exposed a soft oötheca, recently\r\nremoved from _Eurycotis floridana_, to _C. merceti_; no wasps developed;\r\nwe had similar negative results with _C. merceti_ and oöthecae of _B.\r\ngermanica_. We (1954b) could not induce _Tetrastichus hagenowii_ to\r\nparasitize eggs of _Blattella germanica_, _B. vaga_, or _Parcoblatta\r\nvirginica_ in the laboratory. In our experiments, _T. hagenowii_\r\noviposited into eggs of _Supella supellectilium_, but the wasp eggs\r\neither failed to hatch, or if they hatched, the larvae died before\r\ncompleting development. Neither would _T. hagenowii_ parasitize eggs of\r\n_N. rhombifolia_ (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1957). _Anastatus\r\ntenuipes_ would not parasitize the eggs of _Latiblattella lucifrons_\r\nHebard, _Periplaneta americana_, _B. germanica_, or _B. vaga_ (Flock,\r\n1941). _Anastatus floridanus_ would not oviposit into eggs of _S.\r\nsupellectilium_ and only rarely into eggs of _P. americana_ or _B.\r\norientalis_ (Roth and Willis, 1954a); in the laboratory, this wasp could\r\nnot be maintained beyond one generation on the eggs of _P. americana_.\r\nEdmunds (1953b) could not induce _Prosevania punctata_ to parasitize\r\neggs of _B. germanica_. Cros (1942) induced _P. punctata_ to oviposit\r\ninto a mantid oötheca, but neither mantids nor parasite developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCKROACH-HUNTING WASPS\r\n\r\nA number of wasps of the families Ampulicidae, Sphecidae, and a very few\r\nspecies of Pompilidae have been found to provision their nests with\r\nnymphal or adult cockroaches. This habit of preying on cockroaches is\r\nprimitive (Leclercq, 1954); Leclercq (personal communication, 1955)\r\nstated that this habit is always associated with the conservation of a\r\nnumber of structures considered as archaic from a purely morphological\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nThe records of wasps of the genus _Astata_ capturing cockroaches (e.g.,\r\nSickmann, 1893; St. Fargeau _in_ Sharp, 1899) \"all trace back to a\r\nquestionable record by Lepeletier (1841) which probably was a\r\nmisidentification of the predator\" (K. V. Krombein, personal\r\ncommunication, 1956). Marshall (1866) suggested that the braconid\r\n_Paxylomma buccata_ Bréb., which he found frequenting cockroach runs in\r\nPembrokeshire, was parasitic on _Ectobius nigripes_ Stephens; however,\r\nthis wasp is undoubtedly parasitic on ants, probably on ant larvae\r\n(Donisthorpe and Wilkinson, 1930).\r\n\r\nThe wasps that are known to capture cockroaches, and summaries of their\r\nbiology, are listed below.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASPS THAT PROVISION THEIR NESTS WITH COCKROACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily POMPILIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pompilus bracatus= Bingham\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, India (Bingham, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pompilus= sp.\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--Cockroach, Nyasaland (Lamborn _in_ Poulton, 1926): The\r\nwasp was collected leading a nymph of the cockroach by its antenna.

Although many species of _Ampulex_ have been\r\ndescribed, the prey of only a small number of species have been\r\ndiscovered, but the known prey are all cockroaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ampulex amoena= Stål\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Ampulex novarae_ Saussure [Krombein, personal\r\ncommunication, 1957].\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Periplaneta americana_ and _Periplaneta\r\naustralasiae_, both as small nymphs, Formosa (Sonan, 1924, 1927): The\r\nwasp stings a nymph about one inch long and carries it to a suitable\r\nplace, such as bamboo pipes, folds of newspaper, or books (in houses),\r\nfor oviposition.\r\n\r\n_Periplaneta picea_, Japan (Kamo, 1957; Kohriba, 1957).\r\n\r\n_Experimental hosts._--_Periplaneta picea_, Japan (Kamo, 1957; Kohriba,\r\n1957).\r\n\r\nKamo (1957) observed that in the field both males and females sucked\r\njuices from wounds they made in the stems of _Clerodendron_\r\n_trichotomum_ Thunberg or _Ilex rotunda_ Thunberg. Kohriba (1957), on\r\nthe other hand, found both sexes sucking sap of _Abies_ sp. and other\r\ntrees from points injured by the rostrum of cicadas. Kamo (1957)\r\nobserved that the female wasp grasped the cockroach by a tergum and\r\nstung it several times in the thorax. The wasp always amputated the\r\nantennae of the prey and sucked up the fluid oozing from the cut\r\nantennae. The wasp egg was placed on the mesocoxa of the cockroach. In\r\nthe laboratory as many as three cockroaches, each with a wasp egg, were\r\nstored in artificial nests per day. Kohriba (1957) observed similar\r\nbehavior in the laboratory and made these additional notes. The\r\nparalyzed cockroach could move its legs and was led to the nest by the\r\nwasp which seized its antennae. The egg hatched in 2 days, and after\r\nsucking up body fluid for 2 days the larva began to devour the prey.\r\nThree days later the larva spun its cocoon, and about one month after\r\nspinning a female wasp emerged.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ampulex assimilis= Kohl\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Blatta lateralis_, wingless females, Iraq (Hingston,\r\n1925): Nesting sites are holes in palm trees, galleries of beetles, or\r\ntunnels in ground. The wasp first seizes a cockroach by the edge of its\r\nthorax and stings it in the thoracic region, then seizes the cockroach\r\nby an antenna and pulls and leads it to the nest. The wasp deposits her\r\negg on the outer surface of the femur of the cockroach's midleg. The\r\nnest is closed with debris; later the cockroach recovers from the sting.\r\nThe wasp larva first feeds externally, then bores into the cockroach and\r\ndevours the internal organs. Pupation occurs inside the exoskeleton of\r\nthe cockroach.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ampulex canaliculata= (Say)\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Rhinopsis caniculatus._\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Ischnoptera_ sp., U.S.A.

MacNay (1954) referred to a rare sphecoid\r\nwasp in eastern Canada which provisioned its nest with nymphs and adults\r\nof _P. pensylvanica_. Dr. W. R. M. Mason (personal communication, 1957)\r\nwrote us that although this wasp was _Ampulex canaliculata_, it was not\r\nreared from the cockroach but was swept from a pine tree. There are no\r\npositive records linking _A. canaliculata_ with _P. pensylvanica_.\r\n\r\n_Experimental host._--_Parcoblatta virginica_, females, U.S.A., Missouri\r\n(Williams, 1928a, 1929): figure 6.\r\n\r\nNesting sites are in twigs (Krombein, 1951). The adult behavior is\r\nsimilar to that of _A. compressa_; the female wasp imbibes blood that\r\noozes from the amputated antennae of the cockroach; the egg hatches in\r\n2-3 days, and the development of one male was completed in 33 days\r\n(Williams, 1929).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  FIG. 6. _Ampulex canaliculata_ attacking _Parcoblatta virginica_.

Zimmerman's (1948) listings probably were taken from Williams.\r\n\r\n_Nesting sites._--Holes in walls; holes in banyan and fig trees; in\r\nhouses in drawers and cartons. _Behavior._--Similar to that of _A.\r\nassimilis_. Bordage (1912) gives a complete description of capture of\r\nprey. The female wasp cuts off part of the cockroach's antennae, legs,\r\nand wings; she sticks her egg onto the host's mesothoracic coxa. The\r\nwasp frequents houses in search of prey. Five [F][F], supplied with a\r\ncockroach per day, stored an average of 57±14 cockroaches; 8 [F][F]\r\nstored an average of 45±3 cockroaches; these latter wasps were not\r\nsupplied with a cockroach per day throughout (mean values computed from\r\nWilliams, 1942). This wasp will not attack _Nauphoeta cinerea_\r\n(Williams, 1942a) or _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ (Schwabe, 1950b). On one\r\noccasion, _A. compressa_ stung _Diploptera punctata_, but did not\r\noviposit (Williams, 1942a). _Development._--Minimum 34 days, maximum 140\r\ndays (Williams, 1942). About 6 weeks (Swezey, 1944). _Longevity of\r\nadults._--13 [F][F] lived an average of 110±11 days (minimum 31, maximum\r\n159); several [M][M] lived 2 months (Williams, 1942).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ampulex fasciata= Jurine\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Ectobius pallidus_, France (Picard, 1911, 1919):\r\nNesting sites are in brier or bramble stems, or in crevices in fig\r\ntrees; the female possibly uses old nests of leaf-cutter bees. The\r\nfeeding of the wasp larva is similar to that of other _Ampulex_. Adult\r\nwasp emerges by cutting open a passage through its cocoon and through\r\nthe anus of the cockroach.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ampulex ruficornis= (Cameron)\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, Oriental region (Rothney _in_ Sharp,\r\n1899): Nesting sites are in crevices in bark. The female grasps the\r\ncockroach by an antenna to drag it to her nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ampulex sibirica= Fabricius\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--Perkins referred to this species as _Ampulex sibirica_.\r\nWilliams (1942a), referring to Perkins's observations, mentions the\r\nspecies as \"_A. compressiventris_ Guérin (=_A. siberica_ Sauss.).\"\r\nKrombein (personal communication, 1956) has commented upon this synonymy\r\nas follows: _Ampulex siberica_ Sauss. is apparently a misidentification\r\nby Saussure of _sibirica_ Fab. Kohl (1893) in his revision of the genus\r\n_Ampulex_ considered _A. compressiventris_ Guérin to be the correct name\r\nfor this common African species and that _sibirica_, described from\r\nSiberia, must be another species. However, Turner (1912) stated that he\r\nhad seen Fabricius's type specimen and that it was identical with what\r\nhad been called _compressiventris_; he considered the Siberian locality\r\ngiven by Fabricius as an error. Krombein suggested that Williams's use\r\nof the combination _siberica_ Sauss. was a lapsus and that the valid\r\nname, if Turner is correct, is _sibirica_ Fab.\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--Cockroaches, West Africa (Perkins _in_ Sharp, 1899):\r\nNesting sites are keyholes. Enters apartments in search of cockroaches.\r\nWasp cocoon protrudes from dead body of cockroach.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ampulex sonnerati= Kohl\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--\"La mouche bleue\" of Sonnerat (Kohl, 1893).\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--\"Kakkerlac,\" Philippine Islands (Sonnerat, 1776):\r\nNesting sites are readymade crevices. The wasp seizes the cockroach by\r\nan antenna and stings the host many times in the \"abdomen.\" She drags\r\nthe cockroach by an antenna to the nest, and, after depositing her egg,\r\nplugs the opening with moistened earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dolichurus bicolor= Lepeletier\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--Schulz (1912) considered this to be _Dolichurus\r\ncorniculus_. Berland (1925) stated that this is possibly a color variety\r\nof _D. corniculus_. Soyer (1947), from a study of the behavior of the\r\nwasps, believed that both _D. bicolor_ and _D. haemorrhous_ are\r\nvarieties of _D. corniculus_. Krombein (personal communication, 1956)\r\nstated that _D. corniculus_ and _D. bicolor_ differ in characters other\r\nthan color alone and that _D. bicolor_ is considered a valid species\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--Cockroach, France (Benoist, 1927): The wasp was\r\nobserved closing the entrance to its burrow. Its egg was attached to the\r\ncoxa of the midleg of the cockroach.\r\n\r\nManeval (1932) stated that _D. bicolor_ is found at the edge of dry\r\nwoods along with _D. corniculus_ and that the wasp will also accept the\r\nprey of _D. corniculus_ if presented to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dolichurus corniculus= (Spinola)\r\n\r\n_Synonymy._--_Dolichurus haemorrhous_ Costa [Schulz, 1912].

The\r\nwasp cuts off about two-thirds of the cockroach's antennae prior to\r\nputting its prey in its nest (Adlerz, 1903; Bouwman, 1914; Soyer, 1947).\r\nOne cockroach is placed in the nest and the wasp's egg is attached to\r\nthe midcoxa (Ferton, 1894). Oviposition takes 5 to 6 minutes (Maneval,\r\n1939). Wasp fills and seals its nest with bits of earth and stones\r\n(Ferton, 1894; Grandi, 1954). The wasp larva feeds externally and\r\ndevours the entire cockroach, including its exoskeleton (Ferton, 1894).\r\n\r\n_Development._--Hatching occurs in 3 to 4 days (Ferton, 1894) or longer\r\nduring cooler weather (Maneval, 1939).

Deleurance observed the wasp close its nest with small\r\npebbles, balls of earth, and small dead branches. The wasp egg was\r\nplaced on the femur of the midleg. The prey in the nest is alert when\r\ndisturbed. Deleurance believed the wasp was a variety of _D.\r\ncorniculus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trirhogma caerulea= Westwood\r\n\r\n_Natural hosts._--_Periplaneta americana_ and _Periplaneta\r\naustralasiae_, Formosa (Sonan, 1924): The wasp stings a nymph about one\r\ninch long and carries it to a suitable place (bamboo pipe) for\r\noviposition.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  FIG. 7.--Cockroach-hunting wasps.

Grandi (1928)\r\nstated that the entrance to the nest descended obliquely for 5 to 6 cm.\r\nand ended 4 cm. below the surface of the ground. _Behavior._--Two\r\ncockroaches, either sex, adults or nymphs, were stored in the cell\r\n(Adlerz, 1903; Grandi, 1928). The wasp laid her egg on the first prey\r\nbrought, attaching it behind the front coxa. The cockroaches were not\r\nexcitable and their antennae had not been injured. Grandi (1928) stated\r\nthat the claws of the hind tarsi of the victims may be amputated.

The nest is sealed with mud. The larva\r\nfeeds on most of the cockroach and leaves only some heavily sclerotized\r\nportions in the cell. In 153 nests examined, there was an average of 2.2\r\n± 0.08 [standard error computed from cited data] cockroaches per cell;\r\nfour nests contained five cockroaches apiece. Of the 331 cockroaches in\r\nthe nests, only 6 percent were adults. _Development._--Egg hatches in\r\nabout 2 days; larva feeds about 4 days and pupates about 2 weeks later;\r\nadult emerges about 10-12 days later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Podium haematogastrum= Spinola\r\n\r\n_Natural host._--_Epilampra_ sp., Brazil, Pará (Williams, 1928): The\r\nfemale wasp (fig. 7, B) burrows into the surface of termite mounds, in\r\nbanks, and in level ground.

Hotchkiss (1874) observed\r\nants kill cockroaches on shipboard. Cockroaches attracted to sugar in\r\nthe pantry were killed and carried off by the ants. The destruction of\r\ncockroaches by army ants has been recorded by Bates (1863), Wallace\r\n(1891), Beebe (1917, 1919), Howes (1919), and others. Dead and mutilated\r\nspecimens of _Ischnoptera_ sp.

CHECKLIST OF COCKROACHES AND SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATES\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly naturally occurring associations are included in this list.\r\nCommensal cockroaches are listed on page 315. Bacteroids are not listed\r\nbecause they undoubtedly occur in all species. The higher plants were\r\nexcluded because most of the associations may be too casual to\r\nconstitute symbiosis; however, many of the plant associations were\r\nincluded in the chapter on ecology. The cockroaches and the associates\r\nwithin each category are arranged alphabetically by genus and species.\r\nPage references are to citations in the classified sections where\r\ndetails of the

COCKROACHES AS COMMENSALS\r\n\r\n     These particular associations may well have been accidental and due\r\n     to a predilection for the same type of nesting site. But this fact\r\n     in no way detracts from the interest of such records. Chance must\r\n     play a very considerable part in first bringing symbiotic or\r\n     commensal partners together. Once such a partnership between\r\n     species has been firmly established, it is on the whole, fairly\r\n     obvious, ... On the other hand, in the early stages before the\r\n     relationship has become fixed as a specific habit, individual cases\r\n     are generally dismissed as coincidences. It is, however, unwise to\r\n     disregard such isolated observations or dismiss them lightly.\r\n\r\n                                              ROTHSCHILD AND CLAY (1957)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following social insects have been found harboring cockroaches in a\r\nstate of commensalism in which the cockroaches presumably benefit by\r\nacquiring food from their hosts. Benefits accruing to the hosts are not\r\napparent. Unfortunately, biological details are not always sufficient to\r\nsubstantiate the suspected association. However, it seems significant\r\nthat the cockroach commensals of the insects listed below have been\r\nfound only in association with their hosts and, so far as we know, have\r\nnever been found apart from them. Chopard (1938) has pointed out that\r\nthe myrmecophilous cockroaches are all small, being only a very few\r\nmillimeters long; they are apterous or subapterous; their eyes are\r\nreduced; and they are all of American origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSTS OF COMMENSAL COCKROACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder ISOPTERA\r\n\r\nFamily RHINOTERMITIDAE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coptotermes ceylonicus= Holmgren\r\n\r\n_Commensal._--_Sphecophila ravana_, Ceylon (Fernando, 1957): Six\r\nfemales, 50 males, and nymphs of both sexes were found among decaying\r\ntimber in the ground in association with a colony of this termite.

Although\r\nWheeler (1910) stated that this is probably accidental or unintentional,\r\nit is peculiar that Bolívar (1905) noticed the same invariable\r\nmutilation of the antennae of _Attaphila bergi_. Wheeler (1900) had\r\noriginally suggested that the antennae were probably clipped off by the\r\nants which are continuously trimming the fungus hyphae. Louisiana\r\n(Moser, personal communication, 1959): Numerous specimens were\r\nencountered in some nests of _A. texana_.

This is particularly\r\ntrue of cockroaches that normally are found unassociated with other\r\nanimals or that merely occupy the same habitat with the other animals\r\nbecause of similar microclimatic requirements (see Chopard, 1924c).\r\n\r\nMcCook (1877) excavated in February a nest of _Formica rufa_ in\r\nPennsylvania. A hundred or more lively cockroaches occupied a part of\r\nthe nest that contained few ants. Near the cockroaches McCook also found\r\na colony of _Termes flavipes_. _Ischnoptera deropeltiformis_ has been\r\nfound in the company of ants, but it is probably not myrmecophilous\r\n(Donisthorpe, 1900). Mann (1911) found an \"_Ischnoptera_\" sp. (probably\r\na species of _Parcoblatta_) abundant in the nests of, and tolerated by,\r\n_Camponotus maccooki_ Forel in California. Dead and mutilated specimens\r\nof this cockroach were common in the nests of \"Formicas.\"\r\n\"_Ischnoptera_\" sp. was also common in the nests of _Veromessor andrei_\r\n(Mayr) [= _Stenamma andrei_]. Hebard (1917) reported that W. M. Wheeler\r\ncollected _Eremoblatta subdiaphana_ in Arizona as an ant guest. Rehn\r\n(1906a; Rehn and Hebard, 1927) reported that _Pholadoblatta inusitata_\r\nhad also been taken by Wheeler from the galleries of a jumping ant,\r\n_Odontomachus clarus_ Roger [= _O. haematodes insularis_ Guérin var.\r\n_pallens_ Wheeler; Brown (personal communication, 1958)], on Andros\r\nIsland, Bahamas; Rehn and Hebard (1927) stated that \"This genus and\r\nspecies is the only blattid, which is presumably a myrmecophile, known\r\nfrom the West Indies.\" Rehn (1932a) reported _Dendroblatta sobrina_ as\r\ntaken in an ant nest in a tree in the Amazon Basin. _Tivia australica_\r\nwas taken in an ant nest in Australia (Princis, 1954). The male of\r\n_Compsodes schwarzi_ was taken in an ant nest in the Santa Rita\r\nMountains of Arizona (Ball et al., 1942). A male and female of\r\n_Stilpnoblatta minuta_ were taken in a migrating column of the ant\r\n_Myrmicaria natalensis_ Sm. subsp. _eumenoides_ Gerst. in Nyasaland\r\n(Princis, 1949). Princis cautioned that it is premature to derive any\r\ninference from this, possibly accidental, association. Four females of\r\n_Parcoblatta desertae_ were taken about a nest of an ant, _Ischnomyrmex_\r\nsp. (Hebard, 1943a). A nymph of _Parcoblatta virginica_ was found in a\r\nnest of _Formica_ sp. (Hauke, 1949).\r\n\r\n_Chorisoneura texensis_ has been found in nests of webworm in Florida\r\n(Rehn and Hebard, 1916). Karny (1924) in Malaya found an oötheca of\r\n_Aristiger histrio_ (sp.?) between leaves (_Costus_ sp.) that had been\r\nstuck together by a thysanopteron, _Anaphothrips_ sp. He pointed out\r\nthat the oötheca would not adhere to leaves that were not stuck together\r\nbut would fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nSeín (_in_ Rehn and Hebard, 1927) in Puerto Rico found _Aglaopteryx\r\nfacies_ in abandoned cocoons of _Megalopyge krugii_ (Dewitz) and in\r\nleaves webbed together by caterpillars and in abandoned spiders nests.\r\nWolcott (1950; and _in_ Rehn and Hebard, 1927) also found _A. facies_ in\r\nthe empty cocoons of _M. krugii_ and in the larval tents of _Tetralopha\r\nscabridella_ Ragonot on _Inga vera_ (coffee shade tree); and \"Where\r\nthere are no butterfly-nests, it lives in abandoned spider-nests on the\r\nleaves of other forest trees.\" Cotton (_in_ Wolcott, 1950) found the\r\ntype of _Aglaopteryx absimilis_ also living in the abandoned cocoon of\r\n_M. krugii_ on bucare trees in Puerto Rico. Wolcott (1950) reported that\r\n_Plectoptera dorsalis_, _Plectoptera infulata_, and _Plectoptera\r\nrhabdota_ have been found living in trees between leaves or in\r\n\"butterfly-nests\" of _Tetralopha scabridella_ in leaves of _Inga vera_,\r\nor nests of _Pilocrocis secernalis_ (Möschler) in the leaves of _Petitia\r\ndomingensis_ in the mountains of Puerto Rico. Seín (_in_ Rehn and\r\nHebard, 1927) had collected _P. rhabdota_ in the nest of larvae of _T.\r\nscabridella_.\r\n\r\nWolcott (1950) reported that _Nyctibora lutzi_ had been found in a large\r\nrotten stump associating with \"'comején' termites [_Nasutitermes\r\ncostalis_ (Holmgren)], yellow wood-ants and rhinoceros beetle grubs.\"\r\nRehn and Hebard (1927) found _Simblerastes jamaicanus_ in numbers in the\r\ndebris of an abandoned termites' nest in Jamaica: \"To what extent the\r\nspecies is dependent upon the protection of the termite or other\r\nstructures remains to be determined.\"\r\n\r\nIn Virginia _Cryptocercus punctulatus_ has been found living in the same\r\ngalleries with _Reticulitermes_ sp., and on the Pacific Coast it has\r\nbeen found occupying the same log with _Termopsis_ sp. (Cleveland et\r\nal., 1934).\r\n\r\nShelford (1909) found one male and one female of _Balta platysoma_ in a\r\nnest of a spider of the genus _Phryganoporus_ and assumed a symbiotic\r\nassociation. Chopard (1924) recorded _Mareta acutiventris_ from empty\r\nnests of spiders on Barkuda Island, India; nothing is known of the\r\nrelationships, if any, between these cockroaches and spiders.\r\n\r\nChopard (1924c) found _Margattea_ sp. in the nest of the ant _Acropyga\r\nacutiventris_ Roger; he also found _Margattea_ sp., _Periplaneta_ sp.,\r\n_Polyphaga indica_, and _Temnopteryx obliquetruncata_ in deserted\r\ntermite mounds in India. However, he believed that none of these species\r\nwere more than accidental associates of the host insects; he considered\r\nthem hygrophilous cockroaches which had found a retreat in the nests.\r\n\r\nMcClure (1936) obtained a large nest of _Vespula maculata_ (Linnaeus)\r\n[= _Vespa maculata_] in March in Illinois. In it were living 65 nymphs of\r\n_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_, 3 spiders (_Philodromus pernix_ Blackwall),\r\n2 immature spiders (_Drassus_ sp.), and 6 mites. Balduf (1936) observed\r\nfour individuals of _Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ in a nest of _Vespula\r\nmaculata_; he suggested that they probably fed on dead bodies and\r\norganic wastes of the wasps. However, Rau (1940) has observed this\r\ncockroach devour a _Polistes_ larva in its cell. Although we do not\r\nimply that a commensal relationship exists between _Parcoblatta_ and the\r\nwasp, it is well to recall a statement by Rothschild and Clay (1957): \"A\r\ncommensal relationship is potentially even more dangerous than a merely\r\nsocial tie, for by nature it is more intimate. The closer the\r\nassociation, the more easily is the balance upset. One partner can then\r\nsuddenly take a mean advantage of the other.\"\r\n\r\nCockroach nymphs may enter bees' nests where, according to Imamura (_in_\r\nSonan, 1924), they do not feed on honey or pollen but presumably feed on\r\nexcreta of bees or anything scattered by bees in their nest; the bees\r\nare not disturbed by the cockroaches.\r\n\r\nCockroaches that have been found in the burrows of vertebrates are\r\nlisted on pages 23-25.\r\n\r\nPaulian (1950) found immature cockroaches in the nests of birds\r\n(Ploceinae) in Madagascar and Ivory Coast. All nests of _Fondia_ sp.\r\nexamined in Madagascar contained many cockroaches, and Paulian believed\r\nthat the blattid was a species peculiar to the nests of birds. Three\r\nnests of _Ploceus_ sp. in Ivory Coast yielded one or two cockroaches\r\neach in association with more numerous mites, Psocoptera, Heteroptera,\r\nbeetles, and lepidopterous larvae (Delamare, Deboutteville and Paulian,\r\n1952). These last cited workers also found four cockroaches in a nest of\r\n_Estrildine_ sp., and two in a nest of an undetermined bird, all in\r\nassociation with other arthropods. Moulton (1912) observed large numbers\r\nof _Symploce cavernicola_ and _Periplaneta australasiae_ swarming in\r\nsoft bird guano on the floor of caves in Borneo. Abdulali (1942) found\r\nin India many _Periplaneta americana_ in caves containing the\r\nedible-nest swift; there was no indication of association of the\r\ncockroaches with the birds. Danforth (_in_ Wolcott, 1950) reported\r\nfinding large numbers of _Aglaopteryx facies_ \"in the nests of the grey\r\nkingbird, in the region of the Cartagena Lagoon [Puerto Rico], 'living\r\namong the twigs.'\" In Trinidad, Kevan found a male of _Blaberus\r\ndiscoidalis_ in a bird's nest (Princis and Kevan, 1955).\r\n\r\nDavis (_in_ Rehn and Hebard, 1914a) stated that \"At Punta Gorda\r\n[Florida] there was a vacant house at the end of the town frequented at\r\nnight by a Nanny and Billy goat, and on warm evenings many _Periplaneta\r\naustralasiae_ would run about on the piazza floor and on the sides of\r\nthe house. They were seen feeding on the excrement of the goats and were\r\nno doubt to a great degree dependent upon them.\" This is another example\r\nof a coprophagous insect that has taken advantage of a particular\r\nsituation favorable to its survival. Similar associations exist in which\r\nmany of the domiciliary cockroaches feed on the feces of man and\r\ndomestic and other animals (Roth and Willis, 1957a).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. COCKROACHES AS PREDATORS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERSPECIES PREDATION\r\n\r\nTepper (1893) made the broad statement that the majority of Australian\r\nand Polynesian cockroaches appear to be wholly carnivorous, eating other\r\ninsects, eggs, and larvae. He stated that, because of their voracity and\r\ncannibalistic tendencies, the carnivorous species lead more or less\r\nsolitary lives so that one rarely meets several in close proximity; they\r\nare never very numerous at any time because the stronger devour the\r\nweaker in the absence of other prey. Tepper stated that Australian\r\nspecies of _Ischnoptera_ hunt for their prey among the foliage of\r\nshrubs, and that Australian species of _Cutilia_ [= _Drymaplaneta_,\r\nHebard (1943)] run about actively on the surface, or ascend shrubs and\r\ntrees in quest of living insects and therefore are highly beneficial.\r\nTepper (1894) also stated that _Geoscapheus robustus_ ate earthworms,\r\ngrubs, and caterpillars. Froggatt (1906) and Marlatt (1915) attributed\r\nto Tepper the statement that cockroaches, like _Epilampra notabilis_,\r\nwhich are found out-of-doors in Australia, are carnivorous and feed on\r\ncaterpillars and other soft-bodied insects; but Froggatt (1907) believed\r\nthat this alleged behavior needed confirmation.\r\n\r\nA number of observations have been recorded which indicate that\r\nsometimes cockroaches may be predatory. According to Ealand (1915),\r\nnymphs of the cockroach _Pseudomops cincta_ fed on the Argentine ant\r\n_Iridomyrmex humilis_. In the laboratory, _Eurycotis floridana_ has been\r\nobserved to catch and devour the wasp _Anastatus floridanus_ which\r\nparasitizes the eggs of _Eurycotis_ (Roth and Willis, 1954a).\r\n_Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ was observed devouring a larva of _Polistes_\r\nsp. in its cell in a deserted wasps' nest (Rau, 1940). Brigham (1866)\r\nsaw a cockroach kill and eat a centipede four or five inches long.\r\nAnnandale (1910) described the destruction in Calcutta of termites by\r\n_Periplaneta americana_. During a heavy rain storm many termites flew\r\ninto the dining room and were set upon by the cockroaches which seized\r\nthem with their mandibles and began to gnaw their abdomens. If\r\ndisturbed, the cockroaches carried the termites away in their mandibles\r\nwithout using their legs to seize, hold, or carry the prey. Sometimes\r\nonly the abdomen, but other times the whole body with the exception of\r\nthe wings, was devoured. Perhaps this observation led Allyn (Anonymous,\r\n1937) to theorize that, first, cockroaches could eradicate termites from\r\nhouses, and then the blattids in turn could be eliminated. Falls (1938)\r\nhas pointed out the unfeasibility of this idea. _Blattella vaga_ has\r\nshown some tendency to eat plant lice (Flock, 1941a). Certain small\r\ncockroaches found beneath cane leaf-sheaths, in the Philippine Islands,\r\npreyed in part upon leafhoppers (Uichanco, _in_ Williams et al., 1931).\r\n\r\nTakahashi (1924) stated that the American cockroach will eat the eggs of\r\nthe hemipteron _Cantao ocellatus_ (Thunberg). Cunliffe (1952) observed\r\nmite-infested cockroaches (_Blatta orientalis_, _Blattella germanica_,\r\nand/or _Periplaneta americana_) dislodge and eat the mite _Pimeliaphilus\r\npodapolipophagus_. Sonan (1924) reported that cockroaches (_P.\r\namericana_ and _P. australasiae_) devoured the egg clusters and first\r\ninstar larvae of _Prodenia litula_ and the first instar larvae of\r\n_Attacus atlas_ which were being reared in the laboratory. Lederer\r\n(1952) stated that _Periplaneta americana_ ate reptile eggs in the\r\naquarium at Frankfurt am Main. Pettit (1940) stated that cockroaches\r\n\"are said to have destroyed a large colony of dermestids used to\r\nskeletonize carcasses at the University of Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nDeFraula (1780) believed that his silent \"gryllon\" [obviously _Blatta\r\norientalis_ from his drawings; see Willemet (1784)] was the enemy of the\r\nchirping species of cricket, because after the cockroach became\r\nestablished in his home he no longer heard crickets chirping. Gilbert\r\nWhite (1905 ed.), writing in England in the late 18th century, stated\r\nthat \"Poda says that these [_Blatta orientalis_] and house crickets will\r\nnot associate together; but he is mistaken in that assertion\"; however,\r\nin August 1792 White noted that \"Since the _blattae_ have been so much\r\nkept under, the crickets have greatly increased in number.\" For several\r\nyears Jolivet (1950) had observed changes in a mixed population of\r\n_Blatta orientalis_ and _Acheta domesticus_ in an old kitchen in France.\r\nHe suggested that the cyclical fluctuations in the relative abundance of\r\nthe cockroaches and crickets might be caused by reciprocal predatism\r\nwith one species more susceptible than the other at certain stages.\r\nMallis (1954) has stated that crickets prey on other insects as well as\r\non one another. Lhéritier (1951) had also observed crickets becoming\r\nrare in bakeries in France, having been superseded everywhere by _B.\r\norientalis_; however, he doubted that Jolivet's hypothesis was the\r\ncorrect explanation and suggested that the higher optimum temperature\r\nrequirements of crickets might be the regulating factor. Lederer (1952)\r\nstated that the number of crickets decreased in the aquarium buildings\r\nat Frankfurt am Main as the population of American cockroaches\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n_Platyzosteria novae seelandiae_ was found under the bark of trees in\r\nNew Zealand devouring bugs (Walker _in_ Shelford, 1909b).\r\n\r\nFor years it has been believed that cockroaches feed on bedbugs (_Cimex\r\nlectularius_ L.) and this statement has been repeated in many reference\r\nworks and articles. Ealand (1915) stated that cockroaches devour bedbugs\r\nwith avidity. Even today similar statements are to be found in the\r\nliterature. \"In the old sailing ship days, they [cockroaches] were often\r\nwelcomed by crews because of the belief that they would eradicate a\r\npopulation of bedbugs. This belief was based on scientific fact, as\r\ncockroaches are known as predators of bedbugs\" (Monro, 1951).\r\nCockroaches will often \"help rid a house of bedbugs by devouring all the\r\nlittle parasites they can capture\" (Gaul, 1953). The basis for this\r\nbelief may have originated with a statement by Webster (1834) who wrote\r\nthat bedbugs disappeared aboard \"H.M. Sloop Chanticleer\" when\r\ncockroaches made their appearance. Newman (1855) reported the\r\nobservations of a friend who claimed to have seen a cockroach seize a\r\nbedbug in an infested boardinghouse in London. In 1920 Purdy\r\nreintroduced cockroaches into a house from which they had been\r\nexterminated, in order to control the bedbugs which had become\r\nestablished. According to a popular account by Lillingston (1934)\r\nAfrican natives are said to ask sailors for a cockroach or two to be\r\nused to hunt bedbugs.\r\n\r\nIn Siberia, Burr (1926, 1939) found _Blattella germanica_ and bedbugs\r\ninhabiting the same room. Mellanby (1939) studied the populations of an\r\nanimal house in which bedbugs and cockroaches occurred in large numbers;\r\nthe bugs apparently were not attacked and their numbers increased\r\ngreatly over a period of a few weeks (Johnson and Mellanby, 1939). Wille\r\n(1920) placed starved _B. germanica_ with bedbugs for 20 days, but the\r\ncockroaches failed to attack the bugs. In India, captive adults and\r\nnymphs of two species of house cockroaches would not touch living\r\nbedbugs or their eggs (Cornwall, 1916). In laboratory experiments Gulati\r\n(1930) found that _Periplaneta americana_ ate young bedbugs which had\r\nsoft, blood-filled abdomens; adult bedbugs with harder exoskeletons\r\nsometimes were rejected. The maximum number of bedbugs eaten by a\r\ncockroach was 3 out of 12 during a period of 48 hours. Johnson and\r\nMellanby (1939), also in laboratory experiments, were unable to show\r\nthat bedbugs can be controlled by _Blatta orientalis_ or that bedbugs\r\nare eaten to any extent by them. The existing evidence indicates that\r\nthere is little basis for the often repeated statement that cockroaches\r\ndestroy bedbugs in nature. As Lorando (1929) pointed out, assassin bugs,\r\ncockroaches, and red ants can hardly be considered as practical factors\r\nin bedbug control, though he did recommend the use of spiders.\r\n\r\nAccording to Martini (1952), cockroaches prey on mosquitoes and sand\r\nflies but we have been unable to find any original sources for these\r\nstatements; the only reference we have found in which cockroaches and\r\n_Phlebotomus_ are mentioned together is a paper by Whittingham and Rook\r\n(1923); they fed ground-up cockroaches to larvae of _Phlebotomus\r\npapatasii_. Wharton (1951) reported that cockroaches and other predators\r\nattacked mosquitoes knocked down by insecticides and affected the number\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nCockroaches will on occasion attack and bite animals other than insects.\r\nIn an earlier paper (1957a) we discussed about 20 reports of cockroaches\r\nbiting man. The injury is usually confined to abrasion of the callused\r\nportions of hands and feet but may result in small wounds in the softer\r\nskin of the face and neck. We failed to include the following reference\r\nin the above-mentioned paper. Sonan (1924) had his toes and breast\r\nnibbled by cockroaches on Hiyakejima Island during sleep. He had\r\npreviously learned from a policeman that _Periplaneta americana_ and _P.\r\naustralasiae_ nibbled people on that island, but he had hardly believed\r\nit before he experienced the biting himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRASPECIES PREDATION\r\n\r\nThose who have reared cockroaches in the laboratory have undoubtedly\r\nseen cannibalism occur in the cultures. Cannibalism has been observed\r\namong the common domiciliary species of cockroaches as well as\r\nlaboratory colonies of _Leucophaea maderae_ (Scharrer, 1953), and\r\n_Blaberus craniifer_[12] (Saupe, 1928). Edmunds (1957)\r\n\r\nreported that cannibalism was common in a laboratory colony of\r\n_Periplaneta brunnea_ and that egg capsules deposited by a female were\r\noften eaten by the other cockroaches.\r\n\r\n_Periplaneta americana_ occasionally ate other cockroaches and their\r\noöthecae and also attacked members of their own species (Lederer, 1952).\r\nGriffiths and Tauber (1942) recorded the killing of male American\r\ncockroaches by females of the species: \"One female was especially\r\nvicious and attacked each new male as he was introduced into the\r\ncontainer. Most of such males had molted less than 2 days previously.\r\nOlder males were more capable of defending themselves against attacks of\r\nthese cannibalistic females.\" Even though adequate food may be present,\r\nfemales of _Periplaneta americana_ may eat their own eggs (Klein, 1933).\r\nSome females may regularly eat their oöthecae as soon as they are\r\ndropped (Griffiths and Tauber, 1942). To be completely eaten an oötheca\r\ngenerally must be attacked before it has hardened. If a hole is eaten in\r\none side of the capsule, the cockroach may devour the eggs and leave a\r\nportion of the oötheca. Frequently only the keel or a part of the keel\r\nis eaten and when this occurs the eggs fail to hatch and usually do not\r\ncomplete development because of the rapid loss of water (Roth and\r\nWillis, 1955). When adults of _P. americana_ and _P. australasiae_ were\r\ndeprived of food, both males and females ate newly deposited eggs and,\r\nfinally, the females ate the males (Sonan, 1924).\r\n\r\n_Parcoblatta virginica_ in laboratory cultures also may eat part of its\r\noöthecae; in this species only the soft end of the recently deposited\r\noötheca was eaten (Roth, unpublished data, 1957).\r\n\r\nCros (1942) observed oöthecae-bearing females of _Blatta orientalis_\r\nattack and kill males of the same species which were attempting to mate;\r\nthese males were then eaten by the females. Cros also observed injured\r\nand recently molted nymphs of _B. orientalis_ to be eaten by others of\r\nthe same species.\r\n\r\nPettit (1940) noted that cannibalism in his culture of _Blattella\r\ngermanica_ occurred only when the insects were molting. Adult insects\r\nattacked the molting cockroaches more often than did the nymphs.\r\nHowever, nymphs after the fourth instar occasionally set upon other\r\nmolting nymphs. First-to third-instar nymphs rarely victimized their\r\nmates. The victims were all older than third instar; the later stadia\r\nwere progressively more subject to attack, and molting adults suffered\r\nthe greatest mortality. No direct correlation was noted between\r\npopulation density and cannibalism.\r\n\r\nGerman cockroaches may attack newly molted nymphs of their own kind and\r\ncause them to deflate (Gould and Deay, 1938). Lhéritier (1951) has\r\nobserved the hatching nymphs of _B. germanica_ being devoured by their\r\ncongeners even before they have left the oötheca.\r\n\r\n_Nauphoeta cinerea_ in laboratory cultures will eat newly hatched young\r\nof the same species (Roth and Willis, 1954; Willis et al., 1958). In\r\nHawaii, in nature, _N. cinerea_ may kill and eat the cypress cockroach,\r\n_Diploptera punctata_ (Illingworth, 1942; Fullaway and Krauss, 1945).\r\n\r\nBunting (1956) stated that species of _Neoblattella_ are omnivorous with\r\ncarnivorous and cannibalistic tendencies. An adult female _Panchlora_\r\nsp. was killed and eaten by _Neoblattella_ sp. in captivity. A male,\r\nprovisionally identified as _N. celeripes_, was killed and partly eaten\r\nby two other males of the same species.\r\n\r\nThe factors influencing the extent of cannibalism among cockroaches are\r\nnot completely known. According to Wille (1920) hunger was not the cause\r\nof cannibalism in _Blattella germanica_. Wille claimed that the tendency\r\ntoward cannibalism increased at high temperatures and decreased at low\r\ntemperatures. Pettit (1940) also noted this effect. Gould and Deay\r\n(1938) stated that under crowded laboratory conditions, when there was a\r\nscarcity of food, cannibalism among _Periplaneta americana_ was common.\r\nThe injured cockroaches and those unable to molt were often eaten. Adair\r\n(1923) made similar observations. Undoubtedly, conditions of crowding,\r\navailability of food, temperature and other factors all influence\r\ncannibalism, but practically no experimental work has been done on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, in comparison with the above positive examples of\r\ncannibalism, that both Saupe (1928) and Roeser (1940) observed no\r\ncannibalism during extensive studies with _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_. In\r\nfact, Roeser stated that there was never a case of cannibalism in spite\r\nof long hunger periods imposed on both nymphal and adult insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. ASSOCIATIONS AMONG COCKROACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides preying on their own species or on other blattids, cockroaches\r\nexhibit additional symbiotic relationships among themselves. These\r\nrelationships are (1) the familial associations of parent and offspring,\r\n(2) gregariousness, (3) intraspecies fighting, (4) interspecies\r\ncompatibility, and (5) interspecies antagonism. There are some\r\ninconsistencies between observations made on the same species by\r\ndifferent workers, which only further observation and experimentation\r\nwill explain. Some of the reported observations are unique; this is\r\nespecially true for the feral species. Because of the paucity of\r\ninformation, it is impossible at this time to make valid generalizations\r\nabout some of these interesting relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILIAL ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\nThe females of many species of cockroaches insure varying degrees of\r\nprotection to the developing young in their ways of disposing of the\r\noötheca after it has been formed. The extent of this association between\r\nthe mother and her developing progeny varies from the minimum amount of\r\ntime spent by oviparous females in concealing their oöthecae, to the\r\nduration of embryogenesis in the so-called viviparous species, a period\r\nof over a month or more.\r\n\r\nHaber (1920a) observed a female of _Periplaneta americana_ chew a groove\r\nin a piece of pasteboard into which she attempted to deposit her\r\noötheca. The oötheca failed to adhere to the shallow hole and fell to\r\nthe floor. After several futile attempts to replace the oötheca in the\r\nhole, the female finally left the egg case on the floor of the cage and\r\ncoated it with an oral secretion to which she attached bits of trash.\r\nDuring this operation she chased other females away when they ventured\r\nnear the site. Qadri (1938) described the behavior of the female of\r\n_Blatta orientalis_ in concealing her oötheca in a hole that she dug in\r\nsand; she deposited the egg case in the hole, coated it with saliva and\r\nsand, and then refilled the pit. Rau (1943) described in detail how\r\nfemales of _P. americana_ and _B. orientalis_ covered their oöthecae\r\nwith wood dust or sand in holes they had prepared in the substrate. Both\r\nspecies placed a sticky oral secretion in the holes and then deposited\r\ntheir oöthecae therein. After coating the oöthecae with more sticky\r\nsecretion, the females adjusted the oöthecae so that the keels were\r\nuppermost and then carefully concealed the oöthecae with the excavated\r\ndebris. Both females spent over an hour in the act. Rau (1924)\r\npreviously reported that of 90 oöthecae deposited by _B. orientalis_ in\r\njars containing earth and trash, 36 were placed in crevices or excavated\r\nholes, and 38 were hidden by being covered with dirt stuck to them with\r\nsaliva; only 16 were left uncovered.\r\n\r\nEdmunds (1957) described oviposition by _Periplaneta brunnea_. Some\r\nfemales spent from 30 to 40 minutes secreting from the mouth a frothy\r\nsubstance that was smeared on the substrate; the egg capsule was\r\ndeposited in the secretion and covered with additional froth, which\r\nhardened into a very strong cement. Some females spent as long as two\r\nhours coating the capsule after it was deposited. It was not stated\r\nwhether the oötheca was otherwise concealed. The female remained with\r\nher body over the oötheca for several hours and drove away other\r\ncockroaches which approached.\r\n\r\nSonan (1924) observed that _Periplaneta americana_ and _Periplaneta\r\naustralasiae_ spent from 40 minutes to an hour covering their oöthecae,\r\nand that if the females were frightened away from this activity, they\r\nreturned again to complete it. As well as excavating holes in the\r\nsubstrate in which to deposit its oöthecae, _P. americana_ also avails\r\nitself of readymade crevices of appropriate size (Ehrlich, 1943).\r\nSpecies of _Epilampra_ in Malaya were said by Annandale (1900) to\r\ndeposit their oöthecae in crevices in floating logs just above the water\r\nline. However, Shelford (1906) stated that four genera (including\r\n_Epilampra_) of the subfamily Epilamprinae are \"viviparous,\" in which\r\nevent the females would carry their oöthecae within their bodies during\r\nembryogenesis and would not place the oöthecae in crevices in logs.\r\n\r\nThe female of _Cryptocercus punctulatus_ was observed to make a groove\r\nin a piece of wood, then carry her oötheca 6 inches from where she had\r\ndropped it and place it in the groove; she covered the oötheca so that\r\nonly a portion was visible (Cleveland _in_ Cleveland et al., 1934). Dr.\r\nW. L. Nutting (personal communication, 1954) collected a number of\r\noöthecae of _C. punctulatus_ in the field and found each one almost\r\ncompletely sealed off with bits of wood in a deep groove in the roof of\r\na chamber in a log. The keel of the oötheca was visible but the rest was\r\nwell camouflaged. He stated that \"The adult pair usually frequents the\r\nchamber at this time, while their broods of previous years occupy\r\nneighboring galleries.\"\r\n\r\nBerland (1924) observed a female of _Loboptera decipiens_ filling a hole\r\n(the abandoned nest of a hymenopteron) with earth that she carried in\r\nher mouth; he later found her oötheca behind the earthen barricade which\r\nshe had erected.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the following species of oviparous cockroaches have been\r\nobserved concealing their oöthecae (only those references not previously\r\ncited are given): _Blatta orientalis_; _Cryptocercus punctulatus_;\r\n_Ectobius sylvester_ (Harz, 1956, 1957); _Epilampra_ sp.; _Eurycotis\r\nfloridana_ (Roth and Willis, 1954a); _Loboptera decipiens_; _Balta\r\nscripta_, _Methana curvigera_, _Methana marginalis_, and _Methana\r\ncaneae_ (Pope, 1953a); _Pelmatosilpha marginalis_, _Pelmatosilpha\r\npurpurascens_, and _Nauclidas nigra_ (Bunting, 1956); _Periplaneta\r\namericana_ (Haber, 1919; Adair, 1923; Seín, 1923; Nigam, 1933; Gould and\r\nDeay, 1938; Rau, 1940a); _Periplaneta australasiae_ (Girault, 1915b;\r\nSpencer, 1943; Pope, 1953); _Periplaneta brunnea_ (Roth and Willis,\r\nunpublished data, 1958); _Periplaneta fuliginosa_ (Gould and Deay,\r\n1940); _Periplaneta ignota_ (Pope, 1953); _Supella supellectilium_\r\n(Flock, 1941). Undoubtedly other oviparous species that drop their\r\noöthecae long before the eggs hatch also make some attempt to conceal\r\nthe oöthecae by placing them in crevices or covering them with debris.\r\n\r\nSometimes the oöthecae are deposited but not concealed. Hafez and Afifi\r\n(1956) reported that in Egypt _Supella supellectilium_ attaches its\r\noötheca to a suitable substrate with a gummy oral secretion but leaves\r\nthe egg capsule otherwise exposed. We (1954) have noticed similar\r\nbehavior in laboratory colonies of this species and of _Blatta\r\norientalis_, as have Gould and Deay (1940). Cornelius (1853) stated that\r\nthe female of _B. orientalis_ takes care of the safety of her offspring\r\nto the extent of usually dropping her oöthecae in places which are dry\r\nand raised above the ground, although rarely one also may find some\r\noöthecae scattered on the ground. For lack of suitable material females\r\nof _Periplaneta americana_ sometimes did not conceal their oöthecae\r\n(Nigam, 1933). Frequently in laboratory colonies _P. americana_ merely\r\ndrops the oöthecae loosely in sand or food \"in contrast to _P.\r\naustralasiae_, which almost always went to considerable trouble to\r\nfasten their eggs securely and to conceal them with debris\" (Pope,\r\n1953). If conditions under which _Nauclidas nigra_ is kept are not\r\nsuitable, the female will drop her oötheca anywhere (Bunting, 1956). Rau\r\n(1940) stated that the female of _Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ does not\r\nconceal her oötheca. However, Gould and Deay (1940) stated that this\r\nspecies deposits its oöthecae loosely behind bark. _Ellipsidion affine_\r\nand _Ellipsidion australe_ attach their oöthecae to bark or the\r\nunderside of leaves but apparently make no attempt to conceal them\r\n(Pope, 1953a).\r\n\r\nThe females of most of the above species have no further familial\r\nassociation with their offspring. The eggs hatch with no attention from\r\nthe mother who is probably not even in the vicinity at that time. The\r\nyoung apparently do not react to the presence of the parent, as such,\r\nafter hatching. This is not unexpected, as several additional oöthecae\r\nmay have been deposited by these oviparous females before the eggs of\r\nthe first oöthecae hatch. However, a different behavior is encountered\r\namong species that do not form a second oötheca until after the eggs of\r\nthe first have hatched (see below) and in the so-called colonial\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nShaw (1925) reported that in Australia both _Panesthia australis_ and\r\n_Panesthia laevicollis_ appear to live in families, and that one usually\r\nfinds a pair of adults associated with from 12 to 20 nymphs in\r\ndifferent stages of development; he continued, \"it is only where the\r\nmolts are very abundant that one loses sight of this familial habit.\"\r\nTillyard (1926) also stated that the Australian species of _Panesthia_\r\nlive in burrows in soil in strict family communities of a pair of adults\r\nand 10 to 20 nymphs. A related colonial species, _Cryptocercus\r\npunctulatus_, lives in both sound and rotten logs in colonies consisting\r\nof a pair of adults and 15 or 20 nymphs, probably representing two or\r\nthree broods (Cleveland et al., 1934; Cleveland, 1948). Chopard (1938)\r\nhas cited this association as an example of gregariousness, which it may\r\nwell be; however, the presence of only one pair of adults in each colony\r\nsuggests a more intimate relationship.\r\n\r\nAmong species of _Blattella_ and certain other genera with similar\r\nreproductive habits the female carries her oötheca clasped in her\r\ngenital cavity with the posterior portion projecting behind her. Each\r\nnormal oötheca is carried for approximately the duration of\r\nembryogenesis and is not dropped until, or shortly before, hatching. We\r\nhave seen (1954, fig. 65) newly hatched nymphs of _Blattella vaga_ crawl\r\nover the body of the mother who stood quietly near the dropped oötheca;\r\nthis female raised her wings and some of the nymphs crawled under them\r\nonto the dorsal surface of her abdomen. The nymphs seemed to feed on the\r\ngrease covering the mother's body. The association was short-lived,\r\nhowever, and soon the nymphs scattered. Pettit (1940) stated that when\r\nhatching of _Blattella germanica_ occurs in the open (on a table top),\r\nthe nymphs may remain near the capsule only a few minutes. Ledoux (1945)\r\nfound that newly hatched nymphs of _B. germanica_ remained together\r\nwithout shelter in a single, sparse group. If the nymphs were separated\r\nby blowing on them, the group quickly reassembled, usually in the same\r\nspot. Ledoux showed that this gregarious grouping of first-instar nymphs\r\nwas not necessarily a familial association by placing nymphs from two\r\noöthecae together. In groups of 8 to 12 nymphs there was a perfect\r\nintermingling of the offspring from the two different females.\r\n\r\nIt is among the so-called viviparous cockroaches that the greatest\r\nnumber of observations have been made of postparturient associations\r\nbetween female cockroaches and their offspring. The females of these\r\nspecies carry their oöthecae in brood sacs within their bodies until\r\nembryogenesis has been completed. This behavior ensures protection of\r\nthe young from desiccation and attack by parasites (Roth and Willis,\r\n1955a). (See Roth and Willis, 1958a, for an analysis of oviparity and\r\nviviparity in the Blattaria.) Shelford (1906, 1916) reported that he had\r\ncaptured a female of _Pseudophoraspis nebulosa_ in Borneo with numerous\r\nyoung nymphs clinging to the undersurface of her abdomen. He also\r\nrecalled that there was in the Hope Museum (Oxford) a female of\r\n_Phlebonotus pallens_ to which the following label was attached:\r\n\"'Ceylon ... carries its young beneath its wing covers. 1878.'\" Pruthi\r\n(1933) found in South India another female of _P. pallens_ which was\r\ncarrying over a dozen young nymphs on her back beneath her wings. In his\r\npaper Pruthi reproduced a photograph of this specimen with the\r\nlight-colored nymphs in place on the back of the female. Hanitsch (1933)\r\nreported having seen a museum specimen from Luzon, Philippine Islands,\r\nof the apterous female of _Perisphaerus glomeriformis_ with nymphs still\r\nclinging to her undersurface; he also reported having seen a museum\r\nspecimen of a female of _Ellipsidion variegatum_ from Australia with\r\nfour young clinging to the upper side of the apex of her tegmina and six\r\nto the oötheca which projected beyond her body. Presumably this specimen\r\nwas giving birth when captured. Gurney (1954; personal communication,\r\n1958) stated that specimens of _Perisphaerus_ sp. from Mindanao and\r\nLuzon have been found with young nymphs clinging to the middle and hind\r\ncoxae. The first-instar nymph has an elongate face and specialized\r\ngaleae. Karny (1925) also observed that at the slightest alarm the young\r\nof some species of Phoraspidinae creep under the dome-shaped front wings\r\nof the mother.\r\n\r\nThe newly hatched young of _Leucophaea maderae_ have also been seen\r\ncongregated under the mother on several occasions. Seín (1923) stated\r\nthat after being born, the nymphs of this species gather under the\r\nmother and accompany her at night in her excursions in search of food.\r\nPessôa and Corrêa (1928) reported that \"During the first days the free\r\nlarvae hide under the adult cockroach which becomes restless and active\r\nin contrast to its usual slow gait.\" Wolcott (1950) stated that \"They\r\nare not only gregarious, but the mother broods over her young, and\r\ntogether they sally forth at night in search for food, until they are of\r\nsuch a size as to mingle with their elders.\"\r\n\r\nThe African mountain cockroach _Aptera fusca_ has been observed during\r\nlate summer and early winter in familial groups beneath loose bark,\r\nunder stones, and in dead leaves (Skaife, 1954): \"Each party consists of\r\na number of black young ones, together with one, two or more adult\r\nfemales and perhaps a winged male or two. Later on they scatter and live\r\nmore or less solitary lives.\" In Malaya Karny (1924) often found\r\nphoraspidine females between leaves surrounded by about 20 young nymphs.\r\nHe stated that one also often found females of _Perisphaerus armadillo_\r\nsurrounded by pale, yellowish-white young; similarly he had observed\r\nthat _Archiblatta hoevenii_ was found mostly in colonies made up of\r\nmothers and their young. The duration of these associations is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nSaupe (1928) noticed that the newly hatched nymphs of _Blaberus\r\ncraniifer_ (see footnote II, p. 322) collected together under the body\r\nof their mother and stated that this is as pronounced a case of brood\r\ncare as Zacher had observed with _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_. Nutting\r\n(1953) stated that \"A degree of maternal solicitude is exhibited by this\r\nroach [_B. craniifer_], for many times I have observed the female to\r\nremain motionless for an hour or more with her unpigmented brood\r\nclustered around and beneath her body.\" We, too, have observed similar\r\nbehavior in laboratory colonies of _B. craniifer_ and _Leucophaea\r\nmaderae_.\r\n\r\nChopard (1950) noted that after hatching the young of _Gromphadorhina\r\nlaevigata_ remained grouped around the female for some time; the mother\r\nstood motionless, high on her legs, with her thorax curved up to make\r\nroom for the brood which hid under her body. We (unpublished data, 1958)\r\nhave seen young nymphs of _Gromphadorhina portentosa_ also stay near\r\ntheir mother for some time after birth; the mother at this time produced\r\na characteristic hissing sound when she was only slightly disturbed by\r\nthe movement of our hand near her and her brood. The sound is produced\r\nas air is expelled through the second abdominal spiracle. We have seen\r\nrecently hatched nymphs of _Nauphoeta cinerea_ crawl beneath the mother,\r\neven under her wings, where they remained about an hour (Willis et al.,\r\n1958). Bunting (1956) observed a female of _Blaberus discoidalis_\r\ncollect a mound of debris into which she inserted the tip of her\r\nabdomen; he found young in the mound later the same day. This female\r\nshowed no maternal care for the young after birth. Whole families of\r\ncockroaches may be found in bromeliads in Brazil (Ohaus, 1900). Hebard\r\n(1920) observed a colony of adults and young of _Dendroblatta sobrina_\r\non a tree trunk in the Panama Canal Zone.\r\n\r\nWhether any of the above associations exemplify maternal care for the\r\nnewly hatched young is questionable. The behavior of the mother, beyond\r\nplacing her eggs in a suitable location, seems to be entirely passive.\r\nThe first-instar nymphs are the active partners in these associations,\r\nand they may merely be seeking shelter under the nearest convenient\r\nobject rather than under the mother as such. More extensive studies of\r\nsome of these relationships will be needed before claims for maternal\r\ncare, as suggested by Scott (1929), can be substantiated.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGARIOUSNESS\r\n\r\nCasual statements that cockroaches are gregarious are often encountered\r\nin the literature. There has been some argument to the effect that\r\nlarge numbers of these insects seeking the same environment in a limited\r\nspace would appear to be gregarious, whereas there is probably no true\r\nsocial tendency (Rau, 1924). Reactions of cockroaches to certain stimuli\r\nin the environment undoubtedly do result in aggregations of individuals.\r\nHowever, as Chopard (1938) has pointed out, it is difficult to assign\r\nthe respective parts played in assembling by the attraction of the\r\nmilieu and by gregarious instincts. Chopard (1938) also stated that\r\nOrthoptera with a gregarious tendency are found rarely isolated; one\r\nfinds them, on the contrary nearly always collected in the same\r\nshelters, close together, as if conscious of a need for contact between\r\nthemselves. He continued further that one can be tempted to attribute\r\nthe assembling to taxes but that interattraction equally plays an\r\nimportant role; for example, if one places a large number of cockroaches\r\nin a container and offers them similar shelters composed of cardboard\r\ntubes, one finds that nearly all the individuals will assemble in one of\r\nthe tubes, ignoring the others. Pettit (1940) claimed that in _Blattella\r\ngermanica_ gregariousness seemed to depend on the mutual attractiveness\r\nof body secretions as well as a thigmopositive behavior and love of\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nLedoux (1945) has studied experimentally gregariousness and social\r\ninterattraction in _Blatta orientalis_ and _Blattella germanica_. He\r\nalso found that the cockroaches tended to collect in shelters containing\r\nother cockroaches. He concluded that group formation is not the result\r\nof chance, but is a social phenomenon, and that interattraction is\r\nmainly olfactory, conditioned by (1) positive chemotaxis to odors\r\nemitted by the cockroaches themselves, (2) positive hygrotaxis, and (3)\r\nthigmotaxis. He found also that large groups are not stable and tend to\r\nbreak into smaller groups.\r\n\r\nGregariousness in the Orthoptera varies in intensity according to the\r\nspecies and within a species according to the age or physiological state\r\nof the insects (Chopard, 1938). This is well exemplified by several of\r\nthe blattid species discussed below.\r\n\r\nGregarious groupings of cockroaches have been observed most frequently\r\namong the domiciliary species. A few examples will suffice. Gal'kov\r\n(1926) observed heavy infestations of undetermined cockroaches in\r\nworkers' living quarters in the Ural region: \"In the corners near the\r\nstove, the cockroaches covered the walls in a dense carpet.\" After\r\nfumigating he collected about 135,000 dead cockroaches from one barracks\r\nand about 475,000 from another. We have reviewed a few other examples of\r\nheavy infestations in our 1957(a) paper.\r\n\r\n_Periplaneta americana_ was observed by Gould and Deay (1938) in an old\r\nmeat-packing building in Indiana. Adult cockroaches were present in\r\nlarge numbers between closely placed beams, but the nymphs were more\r\ncommon in cracks between bricks. Clusters of several hundred cockroaches\r\nwere seen on the open walls of the cold, dark hide room. Gould and Deay\r\nstated \"American roaches of all sizes live together in perfect harmony.\r\nYoung nymphs have been noted in clusters underneath adults and crawling\r\nover the adults as they wander about in rearing jars.\" In the monkey\r\nhouse of the Hamburg zoo, _P. americana_ spent most of the day in the\r\ncellars resting on the walls in groups of about 200 individuals\r\n(Brecher, 1929). Lederer (1952) noted that in closed, dark, heated\r\nspaces under the aquarium at Frankfurt am Main, _P. americana_ rested in\r\ngroups of 20 to 30 individuals; he stated that it was remarkable that\r\nthe \"herd\" divided itself into groups each of which usually contained\r\ninsects of the same age or stage of development. Eads (1954) found _P.\r\namericana_ in 40 percent of 762 sewer manholes in Tyler, Tex.; 13\r\npercent of 670 of these manholes were heavily infested with 100 or more\r\ncockroaches in each. Other heavy sewer infestations have been reviewed\r\nin our 1957(a) paper.\r\n\r\nEhrlich (1943) has stated that _Periplaneta americana_ exhibits social\r\nbehavior. For instance, cockroaches of various ages inhabit a fairly\r\nlarge space jointly; the adults and older nymphs sense approaches with\r\ntheir antennae and warn and protect the young by a beating of wings and\r\nby body movements. There is complete utilization of the available living\r\nspace; the imagos drive older nymphs from their resting places, and the\r\nolder nymphs drive out the younger ones, until all cracks, depending on\r\ntheir size, are occupied by various age groups of different sizes. In\r\nhis experiments Ehrlich observed that in cages with no hiding places the\r\ncockroaches would group together; when given a choice of small and large\r\nshelters, _P. americana_ hid only under the larger ones that could\r\nshelter more insects. Finally, the cockroaches ceased to bite and fight\r\neach other when they crowded together in the face of danger.\r\n\r\nOf _Blatta orientalis_ Marlatt (1915) stated \"This species is notably\r\ngregarious in habit, individuals living together in colonies in the most\r\namicable way, the small ones being allowed by the larger ones to sit on\r\nthem, run over them, and nestle beneath them without any resentment\r\nbeing shown.\" Haber (1919) also observed that this species is often\r\nnoticed \"huddled together, the younger ones crawling over, around, and\r\nbeneath the older ones.\"\r\n\r\nWille (1920) observed that nymphs of _Blattella germanica_ remained\r\nalmost constantly in groups during the first and second instars, but\r\nless so during the third instar. He believed that the aggregations of\r\nyoung occurred because they could occupy narrow crevices where the\r\nlarger insects could not penetrate. At usual room temperatures the older\r\nnymphs and adults lived completely isolated, but at certain temperatures\r\nthey gathered together in large, tightly pressed groups.\r\n\r\n_Supella supellectilium_ is said to be gregarious (Gould and Deay,\r\n1940). The smaller nymphs aggregate in small groups in rearing\r\ncontainers, but the older ones remain separate from one another (Hafez\r\nand Afifi, 1956). _Leucophaea maderae_ is sociable and rarely found\r\nalone; in their favorite hiding places, hills of these cockroaches can\r\nbe seen hanging together (Seín, 1923). Wolcott (1950) also stated that\r\n_L. maderae_ is gregarious. Annandale (1900) observed that in the\r\n\"Siamese Malay States\" large colonies of _Periplaneta australasiae_\r\nconceal themselves in hollows of bamboo logs from which houses are\r\nbuilt. Moulton (1912) stated that he was astonished at the large numbers\r\nof _P. australasiae_ and _Symploce cavernicola_ that he saw swarming on\r\nthe sides of caves of Mt. Jibong, Borneo.\r\n\r\nRehn and Hebard (1905) stated that in Key West, Fla., _Eurycotis\r\nfloridana_ fairly swarmed under the coquina boulders in the woods, in\r\ngroups of a dozen containing both young and adults; _Pycnoscelus\r\nsurinamensis_ was very abundant in the same type of habitat. Caudell\r\n(1905) also found the young of _E. floridana_ with the mature\r\nindividuals. Hebard (1917) in his discussion of _Lattiblattella rehni_\r\nagain mentioned finding frequent colonies of _E. floridana_ in Florida.\r\nHe also found many specimens of _Blaberus craniifer_ under boards on the\r\nground at Key West. He found _Parcoblatta lata_ numerous under bark of\r\ndead pine trees in Alabama. However, Dowdy (1955), in an ecological\r\nstudy of oak-hickory forest in Missouri, stated that \"_Parcoblatta_\r\n[sp.] were never recorded as being gregarious, in fact they were mostly\r\nsolitary. However, in some cases two were found together.\" Yet Blatchley\r\n(1895) stated of _Parcoblatta pensylvanica_ that in the winter in\r\nIndiana \"One cannot pull the loose bark from an old log without\r\ndislodging a colony of from ten to a hundred of the nymphs of various\r\nsizes.\" Males of _Parcoblatta virginica_ were said to be often\r\ngregarious beneath loose bark and under chunks and rubbish (Blatchley,\r\n1920).\r\n\r\nRehn and Hebard (1927) quoted observations made earlier by Hebard on\r\n_Byrsotria fumigata_ in Cuba: \"I found the specimens under flat stones,\r\nsometimes in colonies of 3 or 4 mature specimens and numbers of immature\r\nindividuals in all stages of development.\" These observers also reported\r\nthat _Aspiduchus borinquen_ was found in Puerto Rico in a limestone\r\ncavern by thousands in the grass and on the walls. J. W. H. Rehn (1951a)\r\nstated that a related species, apparently _Aspiduchus cavernicola_, was\r\nseen in great numbers on the side walls and roof of a cave in Puerto\r\nRico, but it was not possible to collect any of these and, we infer,\r\nconfirm the species. Rehn and Hebard (1927) in their account of\r\n_Simblerastes jamaicanus_ reported finding it in numbers in a termite\r\nnest. Pemberton and Williams (1938) stated that _Diploptera punctata_ is\r\nof gregarious habits in Hawaii. Saupe (1928) observed a strong \"herd\r\ninstinct\" in all age groups of _Blaberus craniifer_. Bunting (personal\r\ncommunication, 1956) stated that large nymphs and adults of _Blaberus\r\ndiscoidalis_ \"congregate in narrow cracks or on the underside of some\r\nlow object. The younger nymphs keep in close communities of\r\napproximately the same age.\" Sonan (1924) stated that in Formosa(?)\r\n_Salganea morio_ is usually found in groups of six or seven in decayed\r\ntrees. Species of the genus _Litopeltis_ may be found in small groups as\r\nthey are somewhat gregarious (Rehn, 1928).\r\n\r\nThe physiological or psychological effects of gregariousness, or lack of\r\nit, are interesting aspects of the basic phenomenon. Landowski (1937)\r\nstudied in _Blatta orientalis_ the effect on development and growth of\r\nthe transition from life in complete isolation to life in groups. He\r\nkept nymphs in groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 in jars of identical size\r\nand shape. Landowski found that (1) mortality increased with the size of\r\nthe group and with age, as each animal occupied more of the available\r\nspace. [Presumably these factors are less detrimental in nature where\r\nthe group is unconfined.] He further found that (2) life in complete\r\nisolation extended the time required to produce an adult insect; and (3)\r\nthe mean weight of the adult insect was, generally, in inverse\r\nproportion to the number of nymphs raised together; isolated insects\r\nusually attained the greatest adult weight.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Griffiths and Tauber (1942a) found that isolation extended\r\nthe period of nymphal development in _Periplaneta americana_. As most of\r\ntheir isolates died before reaching maturity, these workers concluded\r\nthat the American cockroach does not thrive when individually isolated\r\nand that several individuals must be together for optimum development to\r\noccur. Pettit (1940, 1940a) observed that isolated nymphs of _Blattella\r\ngermanica_ take longer to mature than those reared in groups. Wallick\r\n(1954) found indications in _B. germanica_ that there is an inverse\r\nrelationship between population density and individual weight; as the\r\npopulation decreased the weight increased. He also noted an inverse\r\nrelationship between population density and life expectancy in this\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nWe (Willis et al., 1958) have confirmed the above observations that\r\n_Blattella germanica_, _Blatta orientalis_, and _Periplaneta americana_\r\ncomplete nymphal development in less time when reared in groups rather\r\nthan individually. We (loc. cit.) also found that nymphs of the\r\nfollowing additional species matured more quickly when reared in groups:\r\n_Eurycotis floridana_, _Periplaneta fuliginosa_, _Supella\r\nsupellectilium_, _Nauphoeta cinerea_, and _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_;\r\nonly a very slight decrease in the average length of the developmental\r\nperiod was found in grouped nymphs of _Leucophaea maderae_.\r\n\r\nWharton et al. (1954) observed that virgin adult males of _Periplaneta\r\namericana_ that had been individually isolated upon emergence were\r\nalmost wholly unresponsive to the sexually stimulating, female odor for\r\na test period of four weeks. Similar males of comparable age that were\r\nkept in groups reacted strongly from the sixth day on. Removal of\r\nreactive males from the group inhibited the reaction in these isolates,\r\nbut the response returned when the insects were regrouped. We (1952) had\r\nsimilarly observed that no isolated male of _Blattella germanica_ was\r\never seen to give a courting response without having received some form\r\nof external stimulation. Yet when numbers of males were kept together\r\nisolated from females, on several occasions the males became active and\r\na few individuals gave a courting response. As the sexual stimulus is\r\nreceived by the male of _B. germanica_ through contact rather than odor,\r\nas in _P. americana_, presumably it was mutual contact between the\r\ngrouped males that released the courting activity.\r\n\r\nCloudsley-Thompson (1953a), in his studies of diurnal rhythms in\r\n_Periplaneta americana_, observed a steady decline in total activity in\r\nsuccessive 24-hour cycles: \"When two cockroaches, even of different\r\nspecies (_P. americana_ and _P. australasiae_) were kept together, this\r\ndepression did not appear to set in so readily.\" The associates\r\napparently kept each other active.\r\n\r\nIsolated females of _Periplaneta americana_ can be conditioned to run a\r\nsimple maze with less time and fewer errors per trial than when paired\r\nor when a member of a group of three (Gates and Allee, 1933). There was\r\nless activity, and accordingly fewer errors per minute, among\r\ncockroaches tested as pairs and groups of three than as isolated\r\nindividuals. This observation should not be contrasted with that of\r\nCloudsley-Thompson (1953a), cited above, because the intervals during\r\nwhich activity was observed were quite different.\r\n\r\nIn the above account we have presumed that aggregations of some species\r\nare indications of gregariousness. However, until gregariousness has\r\nbeen proved experimentally for each species, we concede that reactions\r\nto environmental stimuli might be sufficient to bring about some of the\r\nobserved groupings without any interaction between individuals.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this section we note that Tepper (1893) stated that\r\ncarnivorous cockroaches in Australia lead more or less solitary lives,\r\nand that one rarely meets several together in close proximity. Takahashi\r\n(1940) observed that in Formosa _Blattella humbertiana_ does not have a\r\ntendency to throng together. Rau (1947) stated that the adults of\r\n_Ischnoptera deropeltiformis_ showed no tendency toward gregariousness,\r\nbut in the laboratory newly hatched young lived close together under\r\nbark and remained together throughout the nymphal stages. We wonder\r\nwhether this gregariousness was not imposed by the restricted quarters\r\nof the cage. As mentioned above, Dowdy (1955) did not find _Parcoblatta_\r\nsp. to be gregarious in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRASPECIES FIGHTING\r\n\r\nFighting occurs among cockroaches of the same species over food or\r\nshelter or between males. Saupe (1928) observed late-instar nymphs of\r\n_Blaberus craniifer_ attack each other and even adults. Additional\r\nrecords cited in the section on intraspecies predation (p. 322) imply\r\nfighting within a species. Rau (1924) saw a male of _Blatta orientalis_\r\nattack another male in copula and bite away a large portion of its wing.\r\nTwo other males in the container had their wings badly torn overnight,\r\npresumably as a result of fighting.\r\n\r\nEhrlich (1943) stated that individuals of _Periplaneta americana_ that\r\nare feeding will ward off intruders by spreading their wings and pushing\r\nwith their hind legs. However, the intruder will approach again and\r\nagain biting the feeder in the legs and wings. Frequently the odor of\r\napproaching food was sufficient to cause the cockroaches to fight and\r\nbite each other. Biting and fighting also occurred when individuals of\r\nthis species defended their daytime hiding places. A position of attack\r\nis assumed when two antagonistic individuals of _P. americana_ meet\r\n(Ehrlich, 1943, fig. 14). The insects raise their bodies slightly above\r\nthe ground, by extending their legs, and they stretch their heads\r\nforward horizontally so that their mouth parts protrude; when the\r\ninsects jump at each other, they may wound each other severely in the\r\nsoft parts of the body. Fighting between sexually excited males resulted\r\nin injury to their legs, wings, cerci, and other parts of the body.\r\nFrequently an insect that could no longer defend itself was killed.\r\nLederer (1952) also made similar but less extensive observations on\r\nfighting in this species.\r\n\r\nPettit (1940) quoted Woodruff as stating that nymphs of _Blattella\r\ngermanica_, apparently healthy and perfectly normal, would do battle for\r\nno apparent cause other than a chance meeting, and that occasionally the\r\nfight was to the finish, the loser being eaten. Pettit could not\r\nsubstantiate such voracious attacks, although he saw nymphs engage in\r\nfights lasting about two seconds during which one would be driven off by\r\nvigorous bites on legs or cerci. Small nymphs of _B. germanica_ tended\r\nto ignore each other, but third-and later-instar nymphs would engage in\r\n\"quarrels\" of short duration when two met. Pettit noted that males of\r\n_B. germanica_ that were crowded together quickly set upon, but did not\r\nalways kill, other cockroaches introduced into their cage. When he\r\nisolated a dozen males in a small cage, they became quarrelsome and\r\nthree of the group were killed and partly eaten. After several days the\r\nsurviving males had taken positions so that each was equidistant from\r\nhis neighbors. Some of these males attacked other males and a female\r\nthat were introduced, by biting their legs and cerci. Females under\r\nsimilar conditions were much less aggressive, although Pettit saw some\r\nfemales that roved about biting all large members of the group that were\r\nwithin easy reach.\r\n\r\nWe have frequently observed aggressive behavior between males of\r\n_Nauphoeta cinerea_, which resulted in torn wings. The males would\r\nwrestle with each other rolling over and over.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERSPECIES COMPATIBILITY\r\n\r\nWe agree in essence with Chopard (1938) who stated that it is improper\r\nto speak of associations apropos of the ecological distribution of\r\nOrthoptera. He continued that it is clearly evident that different\r\nspecies of Orthoptera, which are found grouped on a territory more or\r\nless narrowly limited, have no interdependence among them. Their\r\ngrouping results uniquely from almost similar reactions to the different\r\nfactors which characterize this limited milieu. There is neither\r\ninterdependence nor interaction; the grouping is a false biocoenose,\r\nborn under the action of the environment, and does not survive a\r\nmodification of this milieu.\r\n\r\nHowever, as there are numerous examples of mutual toleration between\r\ndifferent species as well as examples of incompatibility, the subject\r\nhas more than academic interest even if no true ecological significance.\r\nOn the other hand, further study may show that certain of these\r\nassociations are definitely ecological, particularly among the feral\r\nspecies. As might be expected, most of the following examples pertain to\r\ndomiciliary cockroaches.\r\n\r\nDozier (1920) occasionally found _Periplaneta americana_ with _Eurycotis\r\nfloridana_ in decaying stumps, beneath loose bark of decayed trees, and\r\nbeneath corded wood. Adair (1923) stated that in his house in Egypt\r\n_Periplaneta americana_, _Blatta orientalis_, and _Blattella germanica_\r\nwere found together in a cupboard. Sambon (1925) found _B. orientalis_\r\nand _B. germanica_ side by side but not fraternizing in a home in Italy.\r\nGould and Deay (1938) observed that apartments over stores were infested\r\nwith both _B. germanica_ and _P. americana_, but did not indicate\r\nwhether these occupied the same microhabitat. Gould and Deay (1940)\r\nobserved that in the Purdue University greenhouse _Periplaneta\r\nfuliginosa_ was found \"under benches, boxes, pots and other objects in\r\nassociation with the American roach.\" Dr. L. A. Hetrick (personal\r\ncommunication, 1954) wrote us that several summers before he had had a\r\nmixed infestation of cockroaches, which included _Periplaneta\r\naustralasiae_, _Periplaneta fuliginosa_, and _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_,\r\nin his chicken shed.\r\n\r\nEads (personal communication, 1955), in response to our inquiry about\r\nthe mixed populations of cockroaches that he had reported infesting\r\nsewers in Texas (Eads et al., 1954), stated that \"Each of the ten\r\ncolonies of _B. orientalis_ found in Tyler manholes were associated with\r\nlarger colonies of _P. americana_. True breeding colonies of _B.\r\norientalis_ appeared to be present since all the developmental stages\r\nwere taken. The same situation existed with the _P. fuliginosa_ and the\r\ntwo species of _Parcoblatta_. Larger colonies of _P. americana_ were\r\nassociated with the other species in each case. From our limited\r\nobservations the two species always appeared to be perfectly\r\ncompatible.\" Eads et al. (1954) had found _Periplaneta fuliginosa_ in\r\nthree manholes, _Parcoblatta bolliana_ in one manhole and _Parcoblatta\r\npensylvanica_ in one manhole. We assume that the groups of each species\r\nwere spacially discrete so that they were recognizable as colonies. Dr.\r\nT. A. Olson (personal communication, 1958) has observed two or more\r\nspecies of cockroaches in a single structure but never in mixed\r\ncolonies. Each species was separated physically from the others. Olson\r\nconcluded that cockroaches of different species do not mingle freely\r\nunless forced to do so by some special environmental condition. Pettit\r\n(1940) found _B. germanica_ and _P. americana_ similarly separated in\r\nthe same building or even in the same basement laboratory.\r\n\r\nPerkins (1899) found _Lobopterella dimidiatipes_ generally living in\r\ncompany with the young of _Periplaneta australasiae_ in Hawaii. Rehn and\r\nHebard (1914) in Florida found _P. australasiae_ abundant with\r\n_Periplaneta americana_ on a quarter-boat. They also noted that the\r\nforficulid _Marava_ [= _Prolabia_] _arachidis_ (Yersin) appeared in\r\nnumbers in a kitchen after dark accompanied by swarms of _P. americana_.\r\nThese workers also found _Leurolestes pallidus_ in a fruit store in Key\r\nWest \"where the species was common in a pile of old burlap bags and in\r\ncracks under the stands which it shared with one fairly large colony of\r\n_Blattella germanica_, occasional specimens of _Holocompsa nitidula_, a\r\nfew specimens of _Periplaneta americana_, and one specimen of _Supella\r\nsupellectilium_.\" They also found _H. nitidula_ with _Blaberus\r\ncraniifer_ \"between old boards in a woodshed, where nymphs were more\r\nnumerous than adults.\"\r\n\r\nRehn and Hebard (1914) stated of _Supella supellectilium_ in Florida\r\nthat \"The females were all taken in cupboards where _Blattella\r\ngermanica_ was found in swarms.\" The association in human habitations of\r\n_S. supellectilium_ and _B. germanica_ has been reported also by Sein\r\n(1923), Puerto Rico; Shaw (1924), Australia; Mallis (1954): \"German and\r\nbrown-banded roaches were often found in the same crevice.\"; Anonymous\r\n(1958), Texas; and Anonymous (1958a), Georgia. Gould and Deay (1940)\r\nstated that other species of cockroaches, especially _B. germanica_, may\r\nbe found with _S. supellectilium_ in the same part of a building. Yet\r\nShaw (1925) stated that \"when _Supella supellectilium_ Serv. invades\r\nplaces already occupied by _Blattella germanica_ L., it tends to oust\r\nthe latter.\"\r\n\r\n_Blaberus discoidalis_ has been found in homes or in fruit debris in\r\nPuerto Rico in company with the more common, domiciliary species\r\n_Leucophaea maderae_, but never in abundance (Sein, 1923; Wolcott,\r\n1950). Illingworth (1915) in Hawaii found _Symploce hospes_ associated\r\nwith _Nauphoeta cinerea_, _Graptoblatta notulata_, and _Diploptera\r\npunctata_.\r\n\r\nHebard (1917) found _Aglaopteryx diaphana_ in a bromeliad on a forest\r\ntree in Jamaica together with _Nyctibora laevigata_ and numerous\r\n_Cariblatta insularis_. He also found numerous _Aglaopteryx gemma_ under\r\nsigns on longleaf pines in Alabama with occasional specimens of\r\n_Parcoblatta lata_. In Virginia he found _Parcoblatta uhleriana_ in a\r\ndecaying chestnut log with _Cryptocercus punctulalus_. In Florida he\r\nfound _Latiblattella rehni_ with _Eurycotis floridana_ and, more rarely,\r\nwith _Periplaneta australasiae_ under bark of pine trees. In Key West he\r\nfound _Symploce hospes_ in the cupboard of a hotel with swarms of\r\n_Blattella germanica_ and a few _Supella supellectilium_.\r\n\r\nRehn and Hebard (1927) in their study of West Indian blattids reported\r\nfinding _Neoblattella proserpina_ in epiphytic bromeliads in Jamaica in\r\ncompany with _Neoblattella eurydice_ and _Neoblattella dryas_. They also\r\nlist most of the associations cited by Hebard (1917).\r\n\r\nRamme (1923) reported that he found in Germany four species of\r\n_Ectobius_ (_lapponicus_, _lucidus_, _pallidus_, and _sylvester_) living\r\ntogether in an area about 50 m. by 200 m. Although he had stated that\r\nhis specimens of _E. lucidus_ were a distinct species in 1923, Ramme\r\n(1951) later decided that they were a form of _E. sylvester_, _E.\r\nsylvester_ f. _lucidus_.\r\n\r\nDow (1955) reported trapping _Blattella germanica_, _Periplaneta\r\namericana_, and _Periplaneta brunnea_ in houses and privies in south\r\nTexas. At our request Dr. Dow (personal communication, 1958) analyzed\r\nhis records to determine whether there were indications of associations\r\nbetween these species, with the following results:\r\n\r\n     As stated in my published note, the roaches were at first\r\n     classified to genus only. The 83 _Periplaneta_ subsequently\r\n     identified to species represented 28 different collections, 11 from\r\n     houses and 17 from privies, all in Pharr, Texas. Tabulation of the\r\n     data shows first that _P. americana_ was taken only once in a house\r\n     and that _P. brunnea_ was taken only 4 times in privies. Of course\r\n     this distribution greatly reduces the probability that they would\r\n     be caught together, and it is not surprising that _P. americana_\r\n     was trapped alone in the single house collection. _P. brunnea_,\r\n     however, was trapped with _P. americana_ 2 of the 4 times it\r\n     occurred in privy collections.\r\n\r\n     To investigate the occurrence of _Periplaneta_ with and without\r\n     _Blattella_, an analysis has been made of 560 trap collections\r\n     taken in 40 houses and 40 associated privies in Pharr, Texas, in\r\n     weekly intervals (from May 14 to June 23 [1948]). In the houses,\r\n     _Periplaneta_ and _Blattella_ were caught in the same jar 26\r\n     times, _Periplaneta_ alone 12 times, _Blattella_ alone 83 times,\r\n     and neither genus 159 times. In a fourfold table, the value of\r\n     chi-square (14.7) is significant and indicates that the\r\n     frequencies are not proportional. The number of times\r\n     _Periplaneta_ and _Blattella_ actually occurred together (26) is,\r\n     however, much larger than the expected number calculated from the\r\n     row and column frequencies (14.8). In the privies, _Periplaneta_\r\n     and _Blattella_ were caught in the same jar 9 times, _Periplaneta_\r\n     alone 50 times, _Blattella_ alone 18 times, and neither genus 203\r\n     times. In a fourfold table, the value of chi-square (1.95) is not\r\n     significant but the same type of disproportion is evident and the\r\n     expected frequency of both genera in one trap is 5.7, lower than\r\n     the actual frequency of 9. Both immature and adult roaches are\r\n     included in this analysis.\r\n\r\n     The above evidence would be more satisfactory if based on more\r\n     extensive data. There is also a possible objection in that the\r\n     traps were operated for at least overnight, during which time one\r\n     species could theoretically supplant another. Of course, it is\r\n     doubtful that there is anything involved here like territory (in\r\n     the ornithologists' sense). On the other hand, it is well to\r\n     consider that _Periplaneta_ and _Blattella_ are both likely to be\r\n     more abundant in the same type of favorable location and that this\r\n     factor might offset in part some direct antagonism between the\r\n     species.\r\n\r\nThe only known specimen of _Ischnoptera podoces_ was captured in company\r\nwith the type series of _Cariblatta nebulicola_, in dead leaf litter in\r\nJamaica (Rehn and Hebard, 1927). In Florida _Periplaneta australasiae_\r\nwas often taken in company with _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ and\r\n_Eurycotis floridana_ (Blatchley, 1920).\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERSPECIES ANTAGONISM\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the presumably amicable associations mentioned above,\r\nother observations in the literature seem to indicate that some species\r\nof cockroaches are incompatible when they attempt to occupy the same\r\nhabitat niche. Marlatt (1915) stated \"Rarely do two of the domestic\r\nspecies occur together in the same house. Often, also, of two\r\nneighboring districts one may be infested with one species, while in the\r\nother a distinct species is the commoner one. The different species are\r\nthus seemingly somewhat antagonistic, and it is even supposed that they\r\nmay prey upon one another, the less numerous species being often driven\r\nout.\" Phelps (1924) stated \"Roaches of different species are rarely\r\nfound together, although roaches of the same species live together on\r\nvery amicable terms.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Darwin (1887) stated that \"In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach\r\n[_Blattella germanica?_] has everywhere driven before it its great\r\ncongener [_Blatta orientalis?_].\" Yet in France Girard (1877) suggested\r\nthat the oriental cockroach be introduced into a restaurant infested\r\nwith the German cockroach as the best way to expel the latter, because\r\nthe more robust species drives away cockroaches of smaller size. Wille\r\n(1920) in Germany found usually only one species of cockroach in a\r\nhouse. Yet when he placed _B. orientalis_ and _B. germanica_ together,\r\nthere were no reciprocal attacks even by hungry individuals. Wille\r\nconcluded that because of their greater speed, smaller size, greater\r\nnumber of eggs, and faster development, the German cockroaches eat the\r\navailable food and so make the environment unfavorable for the oriental.\r\nHowever, he noted that cases may be seen in which the opposite is also\r\npossible. Laing (1946; British Museum [Natural History], 1951) observed\r\nthat in the British Isles _B. orientalis_ seems to have lost its\r\ndominant position to _B. germanica_ in recent years; it was stated that\r\nthese species are not as a rule found together and that the greater\r\nrapidity of breeding and ability to climb of _B. germanica_, as well as\r\nthe layout of modern buildings, are some of the factors that favor the\r\nspread of _B. germanica_. Ledoux (1945) found that first-instar nymphs\r\nof _B. germanica_ and fourth-instar nymphs of _B. orientalis_, adults of\r\n_B. germanica_ and sixth-instar nymphs of _B. orientalis_, as well as\r\nadults of both species, did not form mixed groups. However, when he\r\ncombined fifth-and sixth-instar nymphs of _B. germanica_ with\r\nfourth-and fifth-instar nymphs of _B. orientalis_, which are all\r\npractically of equal size, sometimes he would find mixed groups, but\r\ngenerally the groups were distinct. Lucas (1912) stated that Burr had\r\nfound _B. germanica_ and _B. orientalis_ swarming within a rubbish heap\r\nin England; presumably both colonies were breeding and multiplying and\r\none species was not detrimental to the presence of the other.\r\n\r\nShaw (1925) claimed that _Supella supellectilium_ tended to oust\r\n_Blattella germanica_, but Pope (1953) thought it doubtful in\r\nQueensland. Wolcott (1950) stated that \"The larger and more powerful\r\ndomestic cockroaches, _Periplaneta americana_ (L.), _P. australasiae_\r\n(F.) and _P. brunnea_ Burmeister have very definitely fallen behind in\r\nPuerto Rico in competition with the little German roach.\" Pessôa and\r\nCorêa (1928) observed that other species of cockroaches were rare in\r\nBrazil in houses that were infested with _Leucophaea maderae_. Lederer\r\n(1952) noticed that in the reptile house of the aquarium at Frankfort am\r\nMain _Blatta orientalis_ was obviously kept down by _Blattella\r\ngermanica_, even before the appearance of _P. americana_. However, _B.\r\ngermanica_ was not driven out of the reptile house by _P. americana_\r\nalthough the populations of each fluctuated for about 22 years after the\r\nAmerican cockroach had settled there; both species occupied separate\r\nresting places. Lederer further observed that within four years of the\r\nintroduction of _P. americana_ into the crocodile house, none of the\r\noriginal infestation of _B. orientalis_ could be found; a small colony\r\nof _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ in the reptile house was apparently also\r\ndriven out by _P. americana_. Chopard (1932, 1938) stated that the\r\noriental cockroach does not exist in company with _P. americana_ which\r\nvery probably destroys it. Pettit (1940) kept _B. germanica_ and _P.\r\namericana_ together in a cage for several weeks but neither species gave\r\nany indication of feeding on the other.\r\n\r\nFroggatt (1906) stated that \"It is probable that the advent of the\r\nlarger and more formidable American cockroach into Australia has led to\r\nthe retirement or destruction of our indigenous species\" [presumably\r\n_Periplaneta australasiae_]. Tillyard (1926) noted that this statement\r\nis incorrect as neither species is native to Australia. Yet Shaw (1925)\r\nstated that in Australia \"When both species live together in the same\r\nplaces, _australasiae_ Fabr. will probably be found gradually to\r\ndisplace _americana_ L.\" Local fluctuations in the relative abundance of\r\nthese species could be a basis for such dissimilar observations.\r\nHowever, MacDougall (1925) observed that in the plant houses of the\r\nRoyal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh, the Australian cockroach seemed to\r\nhave overcome the American which had been more numerous in former years.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we emphasize that many of the above observations are\r\nmerely tentative impressions gathered by workers who have watched many\r\nspecies of cockroaches in nature. Obviously, additional observations\r\ncoupled with appropriate experimentation will be needed to disclose the\r\ntrue structure of each presumed association and to resolve apparent\r\ndiscrepancies. Although we are greatly indebted to the cited authors for\r\ntheir contributions to the known information, we anticipate that future\r\nresults of cleverly designed laboratory experiments will do much to\r\ndispel the uncertainty that still surrounds our knowledge of the\r\nrelations of the Blattaria to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. DEFENSE OF COCKROACHES AGAINST PREDATORS\r\n\r\n     Irritating or repellent secretions provide many animals belonging\r\n     to widely unrelated groups with a more or less potent means of\r\n     defence....\r\n\r\n     It will be seen that this method of defence does not rest merely\r\n     upon a passive unpalatable attribute, but upon an active emission\r\n     of the unpalatable substance which, since it occurs when the\r\n     animal is seized or threatened by an enemy, enforces its\r\n     effectiveness. In its highest development we find different forms\r\n     whose specialized habits and modified structure enables them to\r\n     _project_ secretion at the enemy, and thus to discourage attack.\r\n\r\n                                                           COTT (1940)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are very few records indicating that cockroaches are unaccepted as\r\nfood by other animals. Hutson (1943) found that the duck, guinea fowl,\r\nand pigeon would not normally eat _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_, and in his\r\nexperiments with the chicken eye worm he had to force-feed his birds\r\nwith infected cockroaches. Lederer (1952) found that insectivorous birds\r\nin the Zoological Garden, Frankfurt am Main, either refused hardened (as\r\nopposed to teneral) American cockroaches or ate them unwillingly.\r\nCarpenter (1925) reported that a monkey (_Cercopithecus_) failed to feed\r\non cockroaches and suggested that the insects' odor made them repugnant;\r\nhowever, there are a number of positive records of monkeys feeding on\r\ncockroaches (see pp. 284-286).\r\n\r\nCockroaches may escape capture by predators through evasive behavior,\r\nconcealment, protective coloration, mimicry, or secretion of malodorous\r\nmaterials. Nocturnal cockroaches may avoid predators that are active\r\nduring the day (Crawford, 1934), but nocturnal predators are apparently\r\nquite successful in capturing cockroaches. Some cockroaches may be\r\nprotected by their swiftness, others by their resemblance to vegetation\r\n(Williams, 1928). The habit of squeezing into narrow cracks may afford\r\ncockroaches some protection.\r\n\r\nBurrowing forms such as _Pycnoscelus_ may spend much time in underground\r\ncells (Roeser, 1940). Polyphagids rapidly burrow into sand (Fausek,\r\n1906), where they may be protected from predators. Tepper (1893)\r\ndiscovered that a very large Australian cockroach, _Geoscapheus\r\nrobustus_, had its fore legs, especially the tibiae, adapted for\r\ndigging. He observed this species in captivity and in 1894 reported that\r\nit appeared to sink into the soil without raising any considerable\r\namount above the surface and that it did not form an unobstructed\r\ntunnel. Another large Australian cockroach, _Macropanesthia rhinocerus_,\r\nburrows about two feet below the surface of sandy soil; it also makes\r\nnests among pine roots and the nymphs rarely appear above ground (Henson\r\n_in_ Day, 1950). Tepper (1893) observed that Australian cockroaches of\r\nthe genera _Epilampra_ and _Oniscosoma_ buried themselves in loose soil\r\nand dust. Baker (_in_ Rehn, 1930) observed that _Styphon bakeri_ is\r\nfound in humus and rubble in the Dutch West Indies where \"It is sluggish\r\nin the open, but wedges into the humus quite quickly.\"\r\n\r\n_Therea nuptialis_, found in India, conceals itself at the roots of fig\r\ntrees, etc. The small hairs on its elytra retain sufficient dust to\r\nconceal it, or at any rate to render it inconspicuous, when not on the\r\nwing (Annandale, _in_ Chopard, 1924c). Rehn and Hebard (1914) observed\r\nthat the nymphs of _Blaberus craniifer_[13] at Key West, Fla., \"were\r\nusually found half buried in loose damp earth under boards, where they\r\nremained motionless, looking much like lumps of earth (with which they\r\nwere usually much dusted) until disturbed.\" Hebard (1917) reported of\r\n_Monastria biguttata_ from Brazil that \"All of the juveniles are heavily\r\ncoated with foreign particles\" which adhere \"to a multitude of closely\r\nplaced, minute and usually curved spines, which cover the dorsal surface\r\nand marginal portions of the ventral surface.\"\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the numbers of predators reported herein that many\r\nanimals are not deterred by the odorous secretions of cockroaches; these\r\nsecretions, because they may seem repugnant to man, are often claimed to\r\nbe repellent to predators. However, Cott (1940) points out that \"There\r\nare many instances in which protective devices and associated warning\r\ncolours are known to be ineffectual against certain enemies. But this\r\ndoes not necessarily imply that they are not on the whole beneficial to\r\nthe species attacked.\" Certain cockroach secretions may well be\r\nrepellent to many predators, but as this is a purely negative aspect of\r\nthe predator-prey relationship little thus far has been observed or\r\npublished. Potential prey that successfully defends itself against\r\nattack is never found in a predator's stomach.\r\n\r\nCockroaches have a variety of glands which secrete odorous materials.\r\nCertain secretions, produced by tergal or dorsal glands in males, are\r\ninvolved in sexual behavior; the females feed on the secretion from\r\nthese glands prior to copulating (Roth and Willis, 1954). However, other\r\nsecretions which are produced by both sexes are ejected or given off\r\nwhen the insect is disturbed; undoubtedly these are defensive weapons\r\nthat are used against predators. Very few experiments or observations\r\nare on record to show how effective these secretions may be in\r\nprotecting the cockroach. Although the morphology of some of the glands\r\nhas been described, relatively little is known about the chemistry of\r\ntheir secretions.\r\n\r\nMany species of Australian cockroaches have been reported to emit\r\n\"disgusting\" odors, though the glands producing these secretions have\r\nnot been described, nor is the chemistry of the compounds known.\r\n_Cosmozosteria lateralis_ exposed two orange-red spots on the abdomen\r\nwhile emitting a pungent odor which deterred a collector from capturing\r\nit (Shelford, 1912). Another Australian species, _Platyzosteria\r\ncastanea_, when disturbed on barren ground tilts forward on the vertex\r\nand straddles out the posterior legs, supporting itself in a vertical\r\nposition on the head and tarsi; in assuming this attitude it will squirt\r\na foetid fluid as a fine spray for a distance of 6 or 7 inches (Shaw,\r\n1914). Spencer (1892) mentions the pungent odor given off by a cockroach\r\nwhich had been accidentally cut in two. Rageau (1956) stated that in the\r\nNew Hebrides and New Caledonia _Cutilia nitida_ emits, when disturbed, a\r\ncorrosive liquid with an extremely disagreeable odor.\r\n\r\nThe adults of _Eurycotis floridana_ emit an odorous fluid when seized\r\n(Rehn and Hebard, 1905). The fluid, which may irritate sensitive skin\r\nareas, may be ejected as a spray for a distance of several inches. This\r\nsecretion has been identified as 2-hexenal (Roth et al., 1956), and the\r\nventral abdominal glands which produce it have been described (Stay,\r\n1957). Eisner (personal communication, 1958) has found that the toad\r\n_Bufo marinus_ and the frog _Rana pipiens_ invariably spit out adults of\r\n_E. floridana_ which they have seized. The odor of 2-hexenal was\r\nstrongly apparent after these attacks, and the insect was never damaged.\r\nHowever, the lizard _Anolis equestris_ seized and crushed _E.\r\nfloridana_ before releasing its hold and dropping the insect 5 to 10\r\nminutes later. The blue jay _Cyanocitta cristata_ readily attacked\r\nadults of _E. floridana_ and killed them but did not eat the insects\r\nuntil after the odor had dissipated; however, the bird carried nymphs of\r\n_E. floridana_ to its perch and ate them. Nymphs of this species do not\r\nsecrete 2-hexenal (Roth et al., 1956). Recently, 2-hexenal has been\r\ntested for its antibacterial activity and has been found to be active\r\nagainst seven species of pathogenic bacteria (Valcurone and Baggini,\r\n1957). _Eurycotis decipiens_ from Trinidad also ejects a fluid which may\r\nproduce toxic symptoms such as vertigo and nausea (Bunting _in_ Roth and\r\nWillis, 1957a).\r\n\r\nLarge reservoirs of glands similar in appearance and position to those\r\nof _Eurycotis floridana_ are present in the adults of both sexes of\r\n_Neostylopyga rhombifolia_ and _Platyzosteria novae seelandiae_. Walker\r\n(1904) and Longstaff (_in_ Shelford, 1912) noted that the latter species\r\nhad a strong odor. Roth (unpublished data, 1957) found that the\r\nsecretion of _P. novae seelandiae_ when ejected is grayish or milky in\r\ncolor. In the reservoirs of the ventral gland of this insect the\r\nsecretion is a milky liquid containing floating greenish globules. Both\r\ninfrared and mass spectrographic analyses show that the secretion is a\r\nmixture containing 2-hexenal, the aldehyde that is found in _E.\r\nfloridana_. Eisner (personal communication, 1958) observed that the\r\nlizard _Anolis carolinensis_ immediately released _Neostylopyga\r\nrhombifolia_ without injury, but that _Bufo marinus_, _Anolis\r\nequistris_, and _Cyanocitta cristata_ ate the insect despite the\r\nsecretion; several unidentified spiders and the ant _Pogonomyrmex\r\nbadius_ were not repelled by the secretion of _N. rhombifolia_.\r\n\r\nDorsal and ventral glands have been found in both sexes of _Blatta\r\norientalis_ and _Periplaneta americana_ (Minchin, 1888, 1890; Kul'vets,\r\n1898; Oettinger, 1906; Harrison, 1906; Liang, 1956). The ventral glands\r\nare found in the same general region as those of _Eurycotis_. We have\r\nalso found similar ventrally located glands in both _Periplaneta\r\naustralasiae_, and _P. brunnea_. The reservoirs which store the\r\nsecretion of the ventral glands are smaller in _Blatta_ and\r\n_Periplaneta_ spp. than those found in _Eurycotis_, _Neostylopyga_, or\r\n_Platyzosteria_.\r\n\r\nIn _Blatta orientalis_ the dorsal glands can be everted by pressure on\r\nthe abdomen; the secretion in these glands, according to Haase (1889),\r\nhas the typical oriental cockroach odor. Although the dorsal glands of\r\nthe oriental cockroach are usually given a defensive role (Haase, 1889,\r\n1889a; Kul'vets, 1898; Oettinger, 1906; Konček, 1924), the functions of\r\nsecretions of these nonepigamic dorsal glands and the ventral glands are\r\nstill open to question. It is possible that some of the odors produced\r\nby cockroaches have functions other than defense or sex attraction. For\r\nexample, Ledoux (1945) showed that the species odor is largely\r\nresponsible for the gregarious behavior shown by _Blatta orientalis_ and\r\n_Blattella germanica_. The olfactory stimulus acts over a short distance\r\nonly, and the source of this odor in the insect is unknown. By washing\r\n_Blattella germanica_ in warm chloroform Dusham (1918) extracted a wax\r\nwhich had the odor of the German cockroach. However, there is no\r\nevidence to show that cockroaches respond to the same cockroach odors\r\nthat are detected by man.\r\n\r\nCertain cockroaches have recently been found to have odorous secretions\r\nwhich are produced in tracheal glands. In _Diploptera punctata_ the\r\ntracheae leading to the second abdominal spiracles of nymphs and adults\r\nare modified into odoriferous glands which produce a mixture of\r\n2-ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone; 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone; and _para_\r\nbenzoquinone; this material is ejected as a means of defense. The\r\noffensive odor emitted by adults and nymphs of _Leucophaea maderae_ also\r\nissues from the second abdominal spiracles (Roth and Stay, 1958).\r\n\r\n_Diploptera_ is capable of ejecting its quinones from either its right\r\nor left tracheal gland according to which side of the insect is attacked\r\n(pl. 36, A-B). Eisner (1958) found that the secretion repelled the ant\r\n_Pogonomyrmex badius_ (Latreille) (pl. 36, C) and the beetle _Galerita\r\njanus_ Fabricius when they attacked the cockroach. The spider _Lycosa\r\nhelluo_ Walckenaer was repelled by large nymphs and adults of _D.\r\npunctata_ but young nymphs were usually eaten promptly (Eisner, 1958).\r\n\r\nBordas (1901, 1908) believed that the \"conglobate\" gland (Miall and\r\nDenny, 1886), found in males of _Periplaneta americana_ and _Blatta\r\norientalis_, was an odoriferous gland used for defense, but Gupta (1947)\r\nhas shown that in all probability this gland (the phallic gland)\r\nsecretes the outermost covering of the spermatophore.\r\n\r\nWhat appears to be mimicry occurs in some species of Blattaria. The\r\nnymphs of many Panchlorini and Blaberinae vaguely resemble sow bugs\r\n(Chopard, 1938). Certain members of the Perisphaerini (e.g.,\r\n_Perisphaerus glomeriformis_) from the Malayan region which resemble sow\r\nbugs (Annandale, 1900; Hanitsch, 1915) can roll themselves up into a\r\nball thus hiding their antennae and legs (Lucas, 1862). Although these\r\ncockroaches are found among dead leaves or under stones, in places in\r\nwhich sow bugs are also found, the benefit to either or both forms is\r\nquestionable; Annandale (1900) believed that the crustacean and the\r\ncockroach, living under similar conditions, developed the same general\r\nbody shape. Rolling up into a ball is nothing more than an exaggeration\r\nof a reflex common to many young cockroaches, that is, an arched\r\nposition which these insects assume when they immobilize themselves in\r\nresponse to certain stimuli (Chopard, 1938).\r\n\r\nThere are cockroaches that resemble various Coleoptera and Hemiptera\r\n(Belt, 1874; Shelford, 1912; Hanitsch, 1915). Some look like\r\ncerambycids, lampyrids, coccinellids, pentatomids, etc. Perhaps the most\r\nstriking examples are the resemblances of cockroaches in the genus\r\n_Prosoplecta_ of the Epilamprinae to beetles of the family\r\nCoccinellidae; Shelford (1912) has figured a number of species of\r\n_Prosoplecta_ together with the species of beetles which they seem to\r\nhave taken for models. Williams (1928) mentioned diurnal cockroaches\r\nwhich by a combination of markings, shape, posture, and active flight\r\nabout vegetation suggest certain wasps.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, practically nothing is known about the behavior of these\r\nso-called mimics and models or their relationships with predators in the\r\nfield. For the most part, the examples are based on a comparison of\r\npinned insects from museum collections (Burr, 1899); for this reason\r\nChopard (1938) believed that not much value should be placed on\r\nsuperficial resemblances of this kind. However, we believe that a lack\r\nof knowledge of cockroach mimicry is not a valid reason for rejecting\r\nthe idea that mimicry, if it occurs, may be of some benefit in the\r\nsurvival of mimetic species. Certainly Cott's (1940) voluminous\r\ncompilation of the literature on adaptive coloration should make the\r\nmost skeptic hesitate to conclude dogmatically that these instances of\r\nmimicry are merely accidental and meaningless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF COCKROACHES\r\n\r\n     In the Navy [Japanese] a seaman who has captured 300 cockroaches\r\n     will be granted one day special shore leave. They call it \"shore\r\n     leave for cockroaches.\" The purpose is to promote extermination of\r\n     cockroaches in a warship because, on the one hand, any warship\r\n     suffers from numerous cockroaches, and, on the other hand, any\r\n     seaman likes shore leave.... The formalities for a shore leave for\r\n     cockroaches are as follows. A seaman keeps cockroaches which he\r\n     captured (mainly _B. germanica_, because _P. americana_ and _P.\r\n     australasiae_ are seldom found in Japan) in a bottle or in a bag\r\n     until the number reaches 300. Then he brings them to the deck\r\n     officer to get the confirmation that he has actually captured more\r\n     than 300 cockroaches. If the deck officer confirms it, the seaman\r\n     goes to a cabin where a petty officer reports that the deck\r\n     officer confirmed the number of cockroaches. The petty officer\r\n     signs the seaman's name, name of division, rank, and date to be on\r\n     shore leave in the log book for cockroach shore leaves. The petty\r\n     officer brings the log book again to the deck officer to get his\r\n     approval and then goes to the commander for the final approval. In\r\n     the Navy, they have another special shore leave for rats. In this\r\n     system, a seaman gets one day shore leave for one rat. The\r\n     formalities for the latter are the same as for the former, and\r\n     there is a log book for the rat shore leave in the petty officer's\r\n     quarters. The author took advantage of these systems frequently.\r\n\r\n                                                           SONAN (1924)\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the effects of predatism and parasitism on natural\r\npopulations of cockroaches. Many statements in the literature are very\r\ngeneral; yet there are a few data on egg parasites (e.g., _Tetrastichus\r\nhagenowii_) which suggest that, in the absence of parasites, populations\r\nof domestic cockroaches might be much larger than they are in certain\r\nareas. We have summarized the literature on natural control and also\r\nthat on the use by man of predators and parasites in the biological\r\ncontrol of cockroaches. However, because of the paucity of information,\r\nwe have been unable to evaluate the effectiveness of biological control\r\nin reducing the numbers of pest cockroaches. This is an area that might\r\nreward further investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVERTEBRATES\r\n\r\n_Scorpions._--In Puerto Rico, cockroaches are probably the principal\r\nfood of the scorpions which live in old houses, on tree trunks, etc.\r\n(Seín, 1923). The staple diet of scorpions in Arizona is the small\r\ncockroach commonly known as the water bug (Stahnke, 1949); in the part\r\nof Arizona where he resides, Stahnke (personal communication, 1953) says\r\nthat the \"water-bug\" is most generally _Supella supellectilium_ although\r\n_Blattella germanica_ is also found, but less abundantly.\r\n\r\n_Spiders._--Jefferys (1760) mentioned a large spider which was protected\r\nin the Antilles and especially on Guadeloupe because it hunted down and\r\nfed on cockroaches; the spider was reputed to be common in every house.\r\nSir Hans Sloane (1725, _in_ Cowan, 1865) reported that residents of\r\nJamaica kept spiders in their houses to destroy cockroaches. Takahashi\r\n(1924) reported that, in the Taihoku area of Formosa, human habitations\r\ncontained large numbers of spiders which caught and ate cockroaches.\r\nSmith (_in_ Marlatt, 1915) reported that Brazilians encourage large\r\nhouse spiders because they tend to rid the house of \"other insect\r\npests.\" In British Guiana tarantulas were kept in a bungalow to control\r\n_Periplaneta_ and _Pycnoscelus_ (Beebe, 1925a).\r\n\r\n_Ants._--A Madam Merian noticed that ants cleared houses of cockroaches\r\n(Kirby and Spence, 1822). A small reddish-yellow ant, called Pucchuçiçi\r\nby Peruvian Indians, pursued and destroyed a cockroach called Chilicabra\r\nwhich was a pest in native huts (Tschudi, 1847). Schwabe (1950b) found\r\nswarms of ants attacking living _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_ and stated\r\nthat ants are probably the chief enemy of this cockroach in Hawaii.\r\nWallace (1891) stated that in Africa a band of driver ants may enter a\r\nhouse and clear it of cockroaches and other arthropods. In British\r\nGuiana, Beebe, (1925) found that several times a year army ants cleared\r\nthe laboratory of all cockroaches and tarantulas.\r\n\r\n_Wasp egg parasites._--Matsumura (1917, _in_ Asano, 1937) proposed that\r\nparasitic wasps such as _Evania_ and _Brachygaster_ be protected in\r\nJapan as the natural enemies of cockroaches. In one area in France, 20\r\npercent of the oöthecae of _Loboptera decipiens_ were parasitized by\r\n_Zeuxevania splendidula_ (Genieys, 1924). Edmunds (1952a) found that 12\r\npercent of 459 oöthecae of _Parcoblatta_ collected during December\r\nthrough April of 1950-51 in Ohio were parasitized; evaniids accounted\r\nfor about 7 percent of the parasitization. Additional collection data in\r\n1951-52 Edmunds (1953a) showed that 8.7 percent of 320 wood-cockroach\r\noöthecae were parasitized; 2.8 percent of these parasites were evaniids;\r\nalmost 13 percent of the egg capsules collected showed evidence of\r\nprevious parasite emergence. Cameron (1957) reported that oöthecae of\r\n_Periplaneta americana_ collected in Saudi Arabia were 29 percent\r\nparasitized in March and 25 percent parasitized in October by _Evania\r\nappendigaster_. Sonan (1924) found 1 of 65 oöthecae of _P. americana_\r\nand _P. australasiae_ parasitized by _E. appendigaster_ in Formosa.\r\n\r\nCottam (1922) stated that the increase of _Supella supellectilium_ in\r\nKhartoum was checked by a wasp egg-parasite that was later identified as\r\n_Anastatus tenuipes_ (see p. 246) (Ferrière, 1930, 1935). In this\r\ncountry, this wasp seemed to be effective in decreasing the numbers of\r\n_Supella_ in certain areas in Arizona (Flock, 1941).\r\n\r\nIn Formosa, _Tetrastichus hagenowii_ was an important parasite of\r\ncockroach eggs (Maki, 1937). Sonan (1924) reported 30 percent\r\nparasitization of 65 oöthecae of _Periplaneta americana_ and _P.\r\naustralasiae_ collected in Formosa. In Bangalore, India, the natural\r\nparasitization of randomly collected oöthecae of _P. americana_ varied\r\nfrom 21 percent (of 495 oöthecae), July 1947-June 1948, and 43 percent\r\n(of 288 oöthecae), July-December 1948, to 57 percent (of 178 oöthecae),\r\nJuly-October 1949 (Usman, 1949). Cameron (1955) obtained _T. hagenowii_\r\nfrom oöthecae collected in Trinidad, B.W.I., and Saudi Arabia; some 15\r\npercent of the oöthecae of _P. americana_ and _P. australasiae_\r\ncollected in October in Trinidad were parasitized; a later collection\r\n(March) was 34 percent parasitized; a small sample of _P. americana_\r\noöthecae was 65 percent parasitized. The oöthecae collected in Saudi\r\nArabia in March were 20 percent parasitized. Plank (1947) found that the\r\neggs of the American cockroach in Puerto Rico (probably in laboratory\r\ncultures) were so heavily parasitized by _T. hagenowii_ that he had to\r\nuse _P. australasiae_ for experimental purposes; in 1950 Plank stated\r\nthat more than 50 percent of American cockroach oöthecae were\r\nparasitized.\r\n\r\nFahringer (1922) stated that _Prosevania punctata_ could be used to\r\neradicate cockroaches, but he did not test his hypothesis. Marlatt\r\n(1902) felt that the usefulness of _Evania appendigaster_ in biological\r\ncontrol was impaired by _Tetrastichus_ acting as a hyperparasite (see\r\nfootnote 6, p. 236). However, Wolcott (1951) stated that in Puerto Rico\r\n_E. appendigaster_ is quite abundant and is a factor of considerable\r\nimportance in controlling cockroaches. Kadocsa (1921) stated that\r\n_Brachygaster minutus_ and _Evania appendigaster_ were not important in\r\nthe biological control of cockroaches. These general statements are not\r\nsupported by experimental evidence.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that the smaller wasp egg parasites are more effective than\r\nthe evaniids in controlling cockroaches. Only one evaniid develops in a\r\nparasitized oötheca, but many individuals of the other wasps develop in\r\none oötheca and the number of females that emerge is usually large.\r\nHowever, Cameron (1957) concluded that, with a parasitism rate of 25 to\r\n29 percent and three to four generations a year, against one or less for\r\nthe host, _Evania appendigaster_ in the areas where it is established is\r\na valuable control agent.\r\n\r\nThe use of specific egg parasites to control cockroaches has not been\r\nattempted extensively. Cros (1942) liberated a species of _Tetrastichus_\r\n(=_Eulophus_ sp.; see p. 254) in his home in Algeria to control the\r\noriental cockroach; as far as we know, he did not report the parasite's\r\neffectiveness in reducing the cockroach population. According to\r\nZimmerman (1948) _Comperia merceti_, when accidentally imported,\r\npractically wiped out _Supella supellectilium_ in parts of Hawaii; he\r\nclaimed to have controlled the brown-banded cockroach in a store\r\nbuilding with this parasite. In some parts of Honolulu, almost 100\r\npercent of the oöthecae of this cockroach were parasitized (Zimmerman,\r\n1944). We (1954b) ran some simulated field tests in which we liberated\r\n_Tetrastichus hagenowii_ in rooms artificially seeded with oöthecae;\r\nfrom 28 to 83 percent of American cockroach oöthecae and 56 percent of\r\noriental cockroach oöthecae were parasitized during these tests.\r\n\r\n_Evania appendigaster_ was introduced from Hawaii into Canton Island in\r\n1940 against _Periplaneta americana_, and it has become established\r\n(Dumbleton, 1957). This parasite was also successfully introduced into\r\nSamoa (Dumbleton, 1957).\r\n\r\n_Cockroach-hunting wasps._--An earnest attempt has been made to\r\nestablish in Hawaii wasps that prey on cockroaches. Just how effective\r\nthese wasps are in controlling cockroaches is still unknown. _Dolichurus\r\nstantoni_ was introduced from the Philippines in 1917 and spread to\r\nseveral of the Islands (Swezey, 1920, 1921; Williams, 1944). Bridwell\r\n(1920) stated that as a result of this introduction there was a great\r\ndecrease in cockroaches of the genus \"_Phyllodromia_.\" A number of\r\n_Podium haematogastrum_ from Brazil were liberated in Honolulu\r\n(Williams, 1925) but did not become established (Williams, 1928). The\r\neffectiveness of _Podium_ was questioned by Williams (1928) who observed\r\nthat _Podium_ \"destroyed innumerable Blattidae, which nonetheless\r\nswarmed in their neighborhood, and I must confess from my observations\r\non the various cockroach-hunting wasps that the blattid more than holds\r\nits own alongside its enemy.\"\r\n\r\nIntroductions of _Ampulex_ have proved more successful. _Ampulex\r\ncanaliculata_ was introduced into Hawaii from the United States\r\n(Williams, 1928a, 1929). Williams also introduced _A. compressa_ into\r\nHawaii in 1940, and the species was reared in large numbers for\r\ndistribution (Pemberton, 1942). _A. compressa_ has since become\r\nestablished on most of the Islands (Pemberton, 1945a, 1947; Williams,\r\n1946; Van Zwaluwenburg, 1950). The thousand of _A. compressa_ now found\r\nin the Hawaiian Islands are all descendants of three wasps captured in\r\nNoumea, New Caledonia (Williams, 1944). According to Williams (1941),\r\nthe number of cockroaches was noticeably reduced at the University of\r\nHawaii poultry farm, where some _A. compressa_ were released. Pemberton\r\n(1953) believed that this wasp has become sufficiently abundant to be of\r\ndefinite value. Simmonds (1941) recommended importing _A. compressa_\r\ninto Fiji for cockroach control. _A. compressa_ was introduced from\r\nHawaii into Guam in 1954 against _Periplaneta americana_ and into the\r\nCook Islands in 1955 against _Periplaneta_ spp.; it is not yet known\r\nwhether the parasite became established in either place (Dumbleton,\r\n1957).\r\n\r\n\r\nVERTEBRATES\r\n\r\n     ... on conserve avec soin les crapauds dans les maisons, et que les\r\n     dames les tolèrent, même sous leurs robes, en raison de leurs\r\n     continuels services, car ils se promènent sans cesse à la recherche\r\n     des Kakerlacs.\r\n\r\n                                                          GIRARD (1877)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Toads._--_Bufo marinus_ was first introduced into Puerto Rico from\r\nBarbados in 1920 to reduce several major insect pests including\r\ncockroaches (Leonard, 1933). It was introduced from Puerto Rico into\r\nHawaii by C. E. Pemberton in 1932 where it rapidly became established;\r\nit has since been distributed throughout the Pacific area. _B. marinus_\r\nis one of the world's largest toads; it attains a body length (exclusive\r\nof the hind legs) of 7 to 9 inches (Oliver, 1949) and has been kept\r\nalive for more than 11 years in captivity (Pemberton, 1945). Alicata\r\n(1938) placed giant toads in a fenced area in Hawaii containing an\r\ninfestation of _Pycnoscelus surinamensis_; after 24 hours the toads were\r\ndissected and each was found to have eaten from 11 to 25 cockroaches.\r\nIllingworth (1941) found that 40 to 90 percent of 53 stools of this toad\r\nin Hawaii contained remains of _P. surinamensis_. Alicata (1947)\r\nrecommended the maintenance of _B. marinus_ in poultry yards to reduce\r\nthe population of _P. surinamensis_, the vector of the chicken eye worm.\r\n\r\nToads have also been recommended for controlling cockroaches in houses\r\n(Meech, 1889; Sweetman, 1936). Girard (1877) cited a note in a French\r\nnewspaper which stated that toads were kept in houses in Cuba to control\r\nthe American cockroach.\r\n\r\n_Tree frogs._--Tree frogs enclosed in a room overnight were said to\r\neffectively clear it of cockroaches (Marlatt, 1915); on sugar\r\nplantations in Australia, these amphibians were encouraged in houses and\r\nkept as pets because they hunted and devoured large brown cockroaches\r\n(Froggatt, 1906).\r\n\r\n_Birds._--In Guadeloupe, Dutertre (1654) claimed that all the fowls of\r\nthe country were fond of small cockroaches and lived on practically\r\nnothing else. In Hawaii (Zimmerman, 1948) and in the Lesser Antilles\r\n(Ballou, 1912) cockroaches are eaten by poultry whenever the birds can\r\nfind them. In Puerto Rico, Wetmore (1916) stated that owls kept in\r\nhouses feed extensively on cockroaches; the stomach of one owl which had\r\nbeen kept in a native house was filled entirely with cockroaches. In\r\nBritish Guiana, Beebe (1925) found that cockroaches were eaten by 27\r\nspecies of birds.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--H. (1800) claimed that two lizards cleared his house of the\r\n\"true brown cockroach\" and suggested that lizards be used for cockroach\r\ncontrol because the reptiles are docile and harmless. On Arno Atoll\r\ngeckos and night-feeding skinks eat large numbers of cockroaches\r\n(Usinger and La Rivers, 1953). According to Wolcott (1924) the number of\r\ncockroaches eaten by lizards is surprisingly large considering the\r\nnocturnal habits of these insects. Beebe (1925a) kept geckos in a\r\nbungalow to help control _Periplaneta_ and _Pycnoscelus_.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--Cowan (1865) stated that in England hedgehogs were often\r\nkept domesticated in kitchens to destroy cockroaches. This writer also\r\nstated that a lemur was kept on board ship to destroy cockroaches.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of the American and Australian cockroaches were eaten by\r\nthe mongoose in Hawaii (Perkins, 1913).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would have been unable to complete this review without the help of\r\nmany people who have generously given us their time and the benefit of\r\ntheir special experience.

Institute of Biological Sciences), and by the Quartermaster\r\nResearch and Engineering Center, Department of the Army.\r\n\r\n[2] Present address of both authors, Central Research\r\nLaboratories, United Fruit Co., Upland Road, Norwood, Mass.\r\n\r\n[3] Names of organisms preceded by an asterisk (*) are known or\r\nsuspected pathogens of vertebrates. These records were presented with\r\nannotations in our 1957a paper on the medical and veterinary importance\r\nof cockroaches. For that reason the annotations have not been repeated\r\nherein, although the records have been included to make the listing of\r\nthe biotic associates of cockroaches substantially complete.\r\n\r\n[4] The following helminths also have been stated in the\r\nliterature to pass their intermediate stages in cockroaches:\r\n_Hymenolepis diminuta_ (Rudolphi, 1819) [Blanchard (1891)];\r\n_Inermicapsifer madagascariensis_ (Davaine in Grenet, 1870) [Baer\r\n(1956)]; _Spirocerca sanguinolenta_ (Rudolphi, 1819) [Seurat (1913)].\r\nThese doubtful records are discussed in Roth and Willis (1957a).\r\n\r\n[5] Barber (1939) has shown that the correct spelling of the\r\nname of the type genus is _Ripidius_ and not _Rhipidius_, as it is\r\nfrequently written, and that, consequently, the family should be\r\nRipiphoridae and not Rhipiphoridae.\r\n\r\n[6] Page 11 of Marlatt (1902) has been cited erroneously so\r\nmany times in support of host records for _T. hagenowii_ and _Evania\r\nappendigaster_ that we are quoting the pertinent section below. In the\r\nsection preceding the quoted material Marlatt discusses the American,\r\nAustralian, oriental, and German cockroaches. There is nothing in the\r\npaper to connect any of these cockroaches specifically with the\r\nparasites mentioned below:\r\n\r\n                      NATURAL ENEMIES AND PARASITES\r\n\r\n  \"In Europe the egg capsules of the cockroach are often parasitized\r\n  by an ichneumon fly (_Evania appendigaster_). This insect has become\r\n  widely distributed over the world following its host insect, and has\r\n  been redescribed under a great many different names. It was found in\r\n  Cuba as early as 1829, and has been several times collected in the\r\n  United States. Unfortunately, its usefulness as a means of keeping the\r\n  roach in check by destroying the egg capsules is greatly impaired by\r\n  the occurrence of another ichneumon fly (_Entedon hagenowi_), which\r\n  is parasitic upon the first. This is also a European species which\r\n  has been brought over with its host parasite. If the true egg capsule\r\n  parasite of the roach could have been introduced into this country\r\n  without this secondary parasite, its usefulness would doubtless have\r\n  been very much greater. The secondary parasite, however, seems to have\r\n  been introduced early, and has been found in Cuba and Florida, and\r\n  probably occurs as widely as its host and prevents the latter from\r\n  multiplying very greatly.\"\r\n\r\n[7] Brues et al. (1954) include this family in the Encyrtidae.\r\n\r\n[8] archy (Marquis, 1931) was living in a dream world when he\r\ntyped:\r\n\r\n    \"there is always\r\n    something to be thankful\r\n    for you would not\r\n    think that a cockroach\r\n    had much ground\r\n    for optimism\r\n    but as the fishing season\r\n    opens up i grow\r\n    more and more\r\n    cheerful at the thought\r\n    that nobody ever got\r\n    the notion of using\r\n    cockroaches for bait\"\r\n\r\n[9] Classification of Amphibia and Reptilia follows Hegner (1936).\r\n\r\n[10] Classification of Amphibia and Reptilia follows Hegner (1936).\r\n\r\n[11] Classification of Mammalia follows Simpson (1945).\r\n\r\n[12] The West Indian \"_Blabera fusca_ Brunner\" of Saupe (1928)\r\nis obviously _Blaberus craniifer_ as can readily be seen from a\r\ncomparison of Saupe's figures of the pronotal shields of his species\r\nwith the descriptions by Hebard (1917) of _B. craniifer_ and _Blaberus\r\natropos_ (Stoll). The Chilean _B. fusca_ Brunner is a junior synonym of\r\n_B. atropos_ (Stoll), a South American insect (Hebard, 1917).\r\n\r\n[13] The species was recorded by these authors as _Blaberus\r\natropos_.
