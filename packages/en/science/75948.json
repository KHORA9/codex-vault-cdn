A\r\ngreat book just grows, as has this Book of Wonders.\r\n\r\nIt began with the attempt of a father to answer the natural questions\r\nof the active mind of a growing boy. It developed into a nightly search\r\nfor plain, understandable answers to such questions as “What makes\r\nit night?” “Where does the wind begin?” “Why is the sky blue?” “Why\r\ndoes it hurt when I cut my finger?” “Why doesn’t it hurt when I cut my\r\nhair?” “Why does wood float?” “Why does iron sink?” “Why doesn’t an\r\niron ship sink?” on through the maze of thousands of puzzling questions\r\nwhich occur to the child’s mind. It has grown until the answers to\r\nthe mere questions cover practically the entire range of every-day\r\nknowledge, and has been arranged in such a form that any child may now\r\nfind the answer to his own inquiries.\r\n\r\nAs the mind of the child matures, the questions naturally drift toward\r\nthe things which the genius of man has provided for his comfort and\r\npleasure. We have become so accustomed to the use and benefits of these\r\nwonders produced by man that we generally leave out of our books the\r\nstories of our great industries, and yet the mind of the child wonders\r\nand inquires about them. We have so long worn clothes made of wool or\r\ncotton, that we have forgotten the wonder there is in making a bolt\r\nof cloth. Every industry has a fascinating story equal to that of the\r\nsilkworm, which moves its head sixty-five times a minute while spinning\r\nhis thousand yards of silk.\r\n\r\nCan you tell What happens when we telephone? How a telegram gets\r\nthere? What makes an automobile go? How man learned to tell time? How\r\na moving-picture is made? How a camera takes a picture? How rope is\r\nmade? How the light gets into the electric bulb? How glass is made?\r\nHow the music gets into the piano? and hundreds of others that embrace\r\nthe captivating tales of how man has made use of the wonders of nature\r\nand turned them to his advantage and comfort? The Book of Wonders does\r\nthis with illuminating pictures which stimulate the mind and give a\r\nbird’s-eye view of each subject step by step.\r\n\r\nWhere shall such a book begin? Shall it begin with the Story of How\r\nMan Learned to Light a Fire--he could not cook his food, see at night,\r\nor keep warm without a fire; or should it begin with How Man Learned to\r\nShoot--he could not protect himself against the beasts of the forest,\r\nand, therefore, could not move about, till the soil or obtain food to\r\ncook until he knew how to shoot or destroy.\r\n\r\nWhat was the vital thing for man to know before he could really become\r\ncivilized? Some means, of course, by which the things he learned--the\r\nknowledge he had acquired--could be handed down to those who came after\r\nhim so that they might go on with the intelligence handed down to them.\r\nThis required some means of recording his knowledge. Man had to learn\r\nto write. Without writing there could be no Book of Wonders, and the\r\nbook, then, begins naturally with the Story of Mow Man Learned to Write.\r\n\r\n  THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRITING BY MEXICAN INDIANS THOUGHT TO BE MORE THAN TEN\r\nTHOUSAND YEARS OLD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Man Learned to Write\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a long time between the day of the cave-dwellers, with their\r\ninstruments of chipped stone, and the present day of the pen. Yet wide\r\napart as are these points of time, the trend of development can with\r\nbut few obstacles be traced.\r\n\r\nThe story of the pen is a natural sequence of ideas between the first\r\npiece of rock scratched upon rock by prehistoric man, and the bit of\r\nmetal which now so smoothly records our thoughts.\r\n\r\nThere was a time in the unwritten history of man when necessity\r\nprompted the invention of weapons, and the minds of these primitive men\r\nwere concentrated upon this point. But the arts of war did not take up\r\ntheir entire time; some time must have been given to other pursuits.\r\nAs the mind developed, and as an aid to memory, we find them carving,\r\nengraving, incising upon the rocks their hieroglyphics, which took the\r\nform of figures of men, habitations, weapons, and the animals of their\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STYLUS]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did Writing First Come About?\r\n\r\nAn apparently difficult question to answer, since without writing there\r\ncan be no record of its origin, and without records no facts; yet the\r\ndeduction is so clear that the answer is simple. Somewhere far, far\r\nback in the dawn of the world, back in the beginning of human history,\r\nin the epoch which we have now named the Quaternary Period, man lived\r\nin a dense wilderness surrounded by the wildest and most ferocious\r\nbeasts. His home was a cave, exposed to the dangers incidental to that\r\ntime and his surroundings, and he was of necessity compelled to look\r\nabout for means of defense. With this idea in mind, he found that by\r\nstriking one stone against another he knocked off chips, which chips\r\ncould be used as arrow-heads, spears and axes. Following along these\r\nlines he discovered that by rubbing one of these chips against another\r\nthere was left a mark, which was the first imitation of writing; that\r\nthe sharper the edge of the chip, the deeper was the scratch, and\r\nconsequently the more distinct the mark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLIEST WAYS OF WRITING\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST IMITATION OF WRITING]\r\n\r\nNext it was discovered that certain stones, such as flint, serpentine\r\nand chalcedony, marked more readily than others; that the elongated\r\nchip was handled with more facility; that by rubbing one stone against\r\nanother the finest possible points and edges might be obtained. Thus in\r\nthe Age of Stone was the long, tapering instrument of stone, the first\r\npen, the Stylus, originated.\r\n\r\nThen came the time, known as the Bronze Age, when men learned to\r\nhammer metal into shapes, and metal having many advantages over stone,\r\nthe stylus of stone gave way to one of iron. So we find that in the\r\ntime of the Egyptians, about fourteen or fifteen centuries B.C., an\r\niron stylus was in use for marking on soapstone, limestone and waxed\r\nsurfaces. An improvement in this metal stylus was that the blunt end\r\nwas convex and smooth, the purpose of which was to erase and smooth\r\nover irregularities. In some cases it was pointed with diamonds, which\r\ngave it greater cutting properties. The iron stylus was also used by\r\nthe Egyptians of that period, as well as in later times, with a mallet,\r\nafter the manner of the modern chisel (which indeed it resembled) for\r\ncutting out inscriptions on their monuments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRUSH]\r\n\r\n~WRITING FLUIDS HELPED DEVELOPMENT~\r\n\r\nIn course of time a marking fluid was discovered, and this made\r\nnecessary a writing instrument which could spread characters on\r\nparchment, tree-bark, etc. Thus it was found that by putting together\r\na small bunch of hairs, arranging them in the shape of an acute cone,\r\nand fastening them together in some manner, an instrument could be\r\nmade which would carry fluid in its path, and thus make a mark of the\r\ndesired shape. The hair best adapted for the purpose was found to be\r\ncamel’s hair, while that of the badger and sable was also used. A tube\r\ncut from a stalk of grass answered for a holder. The hairs were held\r\ntogether by a piece of thread which was then drawn through the tube,\r\nthus making the first writing instrument to be used in conjunction with\r\nink, the Brush.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE CHINESE IMPROVED METHODS]\r\n\r\nJust when the Brush came into existence is not definitely known, but\r\nwith this instrument the great Chinese philosopher Confucius wrote his\r\nmarvelous philosophy. The Brush as a writing instrument is generally\r\nassociated with the Chinese, because the Chinese use this instrument\r\neven to the present day, it being especially adapted to their letters\r\nand mode of writing. We have now a pen (brush), as well as an ink, but\r\nthe material upon which the people of that age wrote, in lieu of paper,\r\nwas still very crude, parchment and tree-bark being most commonly used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUILL]\r\n\r\n~THE EARLIEST FORMS OF PAPER~\r\n\r\nJust as the discovery of an ink wrought a change from the Stylus to\r\nthe Brush, so the advent of papyrus, a paper made from the papyrus\r\nplant, which was much finer and more economical than parchment, brought\r\nwith it a pen better adapted for this material. It was found that\r\nthe Reed, or Calamo, as it was called, which grew on the marshes on\r\nthe shores of Egypt, Armenia and the Persian Gulf, if cut into short\r\nlengths and trimmed down to a point, made an admirable pen for this\r\nnewly discovered paper. This was the true ancient representative and\r\nprecursor of the modern pen. The use of the Reed can be traced to a\r\nremote antiquity among the civilized nations of the East, where Reeds\r\nare in use now as instruments for writing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE MONKS DID THEIR WRITING]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a finer paper rendered necessary a finer instrument\r\nof writing, and the quill of the goose, swan, and, for very fine\r\nwriting, of the crow, was found to be well adapted. Immense flocks of\r\ngeese were raised, chiefly for their quills. The earliest specific\r\nallusion to the quill occurs in the writings of St. Isadore de Seville,\r\nseventh century, although it is believed to have been in use at an\r\nearlier period. The quill was used for many centuries. Most of the\r\nwriting during its reign was done in the monasteries by the monks, and\r\nin the eighteenth century, when quill-making became quite an art,\r\nevery monk and every teacher was expected to be proficient in the art\r\nof making a pen from a quill. The preliminary process of preparing the\r\nquills was first to sort them according to their quality, dry in the\r\nhot sand, then clean them of the outer skin, and harden by dipping in\r\na boiling solution of alum and diluted nitric acid. During the last\r\ncentury many efforts were made to improve the quill, its great defect\r\nbeing speedy injury from use. Ruby points were fitted to the nib, but\r\nthis was found impracticable on account of the delicacy of the work.\r\nJoseph Bramah devised, in 1809, a machine for cutting the quill into\r\nseparate nibs for use in holders, thus making several pens from one\r\nquill and anticipating the form of the modern pen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STEEL TUBE PEN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST STEEL PEN]\r\n\r\nThe quill held sway as writing instrument for many years, and with\r\nit the greatest masterpieces in literature have been written. Many\r\nattempts, however, had been made to supersede the quill by a pen not so\r\neasily injured by use, but it was not until about 1780 that, after much\r\nexperimenting and numerous failures, Mr. Samuel Harrison introduced the\r\nfirst metallic pen.\r\n\r\n~THE INVENTION OF THE PEN~\r\n\r\nThis pen was made as follows:\r\n\r\nA sheet of steel was rolled in the form of a tube. One end was cut and\r\ntrimmed to a point after the manner of the quill, the seam where both\r\nedges of the tube met forming the slit of the pen. This was soon after\r\nimproved upon by cutting a rough blank out of a thin sheet of steel,\r\nwhich blank was filed into form about the nib, rounded, and with a\r\nsharp chisel marked inside where the slit was to be in the finished\r\npen. After tempering, the nib was ground and shaped to a point\r\nsuitable for fine or broad writing, as required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MODERN STEEL PEN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MODERN WRITING PEN]\r\n\r\nOnce started, the steel pen made rapid strides in improvement. Mr.\r\nJames Perry, in 1824, started in England the manufacture of pens on a\r\nlarge scale, and to him as well as Gillott is due the many improvements\r\nwhich followed.\r\n\r\nPerry was the first to manufacture “slip” steel pens, up to this time\r\nthe pen and holder being one piece.\r\n\r\n    “In times of yore, when each man cut his quill\r\n    With little Perryian skill;\r\n    What horrid, awkward, bungling tools of trade\r\n    Appeared the writing instruments, home made!”\r\n\r\n~THE MODERN WAY OF WRITING~\r\n\r\nThe steel pen of the present day has reached the pinnacle of\r\nperfection, and the method of manufacture of this little but mighty\r\ninstrument of writing, though of extreme interest, is practically\r\nunknown by the general public. To explain in detail the development\r\nfrom the rough steel to the finished pen would needs make a book\r\nin itself. And as it has been our intention to dwell, not upon the\r\nmanufacture of the pen, but to trace its history and development from\r\nits most crude form, the Stylus, to the perfect and smooth-writing\r\nsteel pen of to-day, we will close our story with the well-worn epigram\r\nof old, grim Cardinal Richelieu:\r\n\r\n    “Beneath the rule of men entirely great,\r\n    The Pen is mightier than the Sword!”\r\n\r\n\r\nHow a Steel Pen is Made\r\n\r\n  In the picture on the following page, we see the various processes\r\n  required in making a steel pen, together with a description of each\r\n  process:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW A STEEL PEN IS MADE\r\n\r\n  N^o. 1.

SCHOOL PEN.\r\n  (FINISHED PENS.)\r\n  COLORING AND VARNISHING.\r\n\r\n  The pictures herewith printed are by the courtesy of the Spencerian\r\n  Pen Company\r\n\r\n  _Raw Material._--The sheet steel is cut into strips of a convenient\r\n  length and width, and then rolled cold to the exact gauge necessary,\r\n  according to the pen to be manufactured.\r\n\r\n  _Cutting the Blank._--This is a mechanical operation, and is effected\r\n  with the aid of a screw press, in which a pair of tools corresponding\r\n  with the shape of the pen has been fixed. On pulling a lever the\r\n  screw descends, driving the punch into the bed, which cuts a blank\r\n  with a scissors-like action, from the strip of steel.\r\n\r\n  _Marking the Name._--This is done by means of a punch fixed in\r\n  the hammer of a stamp, worked by the foot. The blanks are rapidly\r\n  introduced between guides fixed on the bed of the stamp, and as\r\n  soon as the hammer has fallen the blank is thrown out and a new one\r\n  introduced.\r\n\r\n  _Piercing._--The tools for this operation are of a delicate\r\n  character. The blanks are fed by hand, as above explained, and the\r\n  hole punched by a screw press. This is a most important process; the\r\n  pierce hole and slide slits determine the elasticity and regulate the\r\n  flow of the ink on the pen.\r\n\r\n  _Annealing or Softening._--The blanks are still moderately hard and\r\n  before raising, it is necessary to soften them by heating to a dull\r\n  red, and allowing them to gradually cool.\r\n\r\n  _Raising._--The operator places one of the soft blanks on a die to\r\n  which guides are affixed to keep it in position; then by moving the\r\n  handle of the press, the screw descends, forcing a die which rounds\r\n  the blank into the form of a pen.\r\n\r\n  _Hardening._--The pen is now too soft, and is hardened by heating and\r\n  the immersing in oil while hot, after which it is thoroughly cleansed\r\n  from all grease.\r\n\r\n  _Tempering._--The pens are now hard but very brittle, and in order\r\n  to correct this defect they are placed in an iron cylinder, and kept\r\n  revolving over a gas or charcoal fire until they acquire a proper\r\n  temper.\r\n\r\n  _Scouring._--After soaking in diluted sulphuric acid, the pens are\r\n  placed in iron cylinders containing fine stone and water, or fine\r\n  sand, and revolved for several hours. When taken from these cylinders\r\n  they are bright and smooth.\r\n\r\n  _Grinding._--This is a process performed by hand on a “bob,” or\r\n  wooden wheel covered with leather and dressed with emory, revolving\r\n  at high speed. A light touch on the emory wheel grinds off the\r\n  surface between the pierce hole and the point, to obtain proper\r\n  action and to assist the flow of ink.\r\n\r\n  _Slitting._--This is a hand process performed with a press, the\r\n  cutters being as sharp as razors. The pen is placed in position by\r\n  means of guides, and must be cut with utmost precision from the\r\n  pierce hole to the point, the point must be divided exactly in the\r\n  middle, the least variation making the pen defective.\r\n\r\n  _Coloring and Varnishing._--The pens having been polished to a bright\r\n  silver color are placed in an iron cylinder and kept revolving over\r\n  a gas or charcoal fire until the tint required is produced. They are\r\n  then immersed in a bath of shellac varnish, and afterwards dried in\r\n  an oven.\r\n\r\n  _Examination._--Every steel pen passing through the factory is most\r\n  carefully examined before being boxed, and should the least fault be\r\n  found, it is at once rejected.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Pencil Write?\r\n\r\nYou can use a pencil to write with or to make marks, because the pencil\r\nwears off if you are scratching it on a surface that is rough enough\r\nto make it do so. Writing, you know, is only a way of making marks in\r\nsuch a manner as to make them mean something. You cannot write with a\r\npencil on a pane of glass, because the glass is so smooth that when\r\nyou move the pencil over its surface, the pencil will not wear off. To\r\nprove to yourself that the tip of the pencil constantly wears off when\r\nyou write, you have only to recall that when you write with it a pencil\r\nkeeps getting shorter and shorter. A slate-pencil will wear down short\r\nby merely writing with it, but a lead-pencil must be sharpened--that\r\nis, you must keep cutting away the wood in order to get at the lead\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can’t I Write on Paper With a Slate-pencil?\r\n\r\nYou cannot do so, because it takes something with a rougher surface\r\nthan paper to wear off the point of a slate-pencil. A slate is used to\r\nwrite on with slate-pencils, because slate wears off the end of the\r\npencil easily, and also because you can rub out the writing on a slate\r\nwith water. Lead-pencils are used for writing on paper, but you must\r\nhave a rough surface on the paper to write on even with a lead-pencil.\r\nSome kinds of papers have such a smooth surface that you cannot write\r\non them with a lead-pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does a Pen Write?\r\n\r\nWriting with a pen, however, is quite different from writing with any\r\nkind of pencil, because in writing with ink we do not wear off the end\r\nof the pen, but have the ink flow from the pen. For this purpose we\r\nmust have a surface that will absorb the ink from the pen, and draw\r\nthe ink down off the pen and make it flow. A slate has no power of\r\nabsorption and therefore cannot draw the ink. A piece of blotting paper\r\nis the best kind of paper for absorbing ink, but it is too much so for\r\nwriting purposes. For writing with ink we need a comparatively hard\r\nsurfaced paper that has absorbent qualities, but not too absorbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does a Blotter Take Up the Ink of a Blot?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is because the blotter has a very excellent ability to absorb some\r\nliquids. The thinner the liquid the more easily the blotter will absorb\r\nit. Ink is thin--being mostly water--the blotter is of a loose texture\r\nand has a rough surface. This gives the blotter the ability to pick up\r\nthe ink, just as a sponge would do. A sponge has what is called the\r\npower of capillary attraction and so has the blotter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Chalk Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nDeposits of chalk are found on some shores of the sea. A piece of chalk\r\nsuch as the teacher uses to illustrate something on the blackboard\r\nat school consists of the remains of thousands of tiny creatures\r\nthat at one time lived in the sea. All of their bodies excepting the\r\nchalk--called carbonate of lime in scientific language--has disappeared\r\nand the chalk that was left was piled up where it fell at the bottom\r\nof the ocean, each particle pressing against the other with the water\r\npressing over it all until it became almost solid. It took thousands of\r\nyears to make these chalk deposits of the thickness in which they are\r\nfound. Later on, through changes in the earth’s surface, the mountain\r\nof chalk was raised until it stood out of the water and thus became\r\naccessible to man and school teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did Men Learn to Talk?\r\n\r\n\r\nTalking and the words used came into being through the desire of men\r\nto communicate with each other. Before words became known and used\r\nman talked to those about him by the use of signs, gestures and other\r\nmovements of the body. Even to-day when men meet who cannot talk the\r\nsame language they will be seen trying to come to an understanding by\r\nthe use of signs and gestures and generally with fair results. The\r\nneed of more signs and gestures to express a constantly increasing\r\nnumber of objects and thoughts led to the introduction of sounds or\r\ncombination of sounds made with the vocal cords to accompany certain\r\nsigns and gestures. In this way man eventually developed a very\r\nconsiderable faculty for expressing himself. Sign by sign, gesture\r\nby gesture and sound by sound language was slowly developed. A man\r\nwould be trying to explain something to another by sign or gesture\r\nand to make it more clear would make a sound or combination of sounds\r\nto put more expression into his efforts. Finally the other man would\r\nunderstand what was meant and he would tell some one else, using the\r\nsame signs, gestures and sounds. Later on it would develop that to\r\nexpress thus any certain thought, act or the name of a thing, all of\r\nthe people in the community would make this same combination of sounds,\r\nsigns and gestures to express the same thing. Finally the gestures\r\nand signs would be dropped and it was found that people understood\r\nperfectly what was meant when only the sound or combination of sounds\r\nwas produced. That made a word. All the other words were made in the\r\nsame way, one at a time, until we had enough words to express all the\r\nordinary things and the combination of words became a language. The\r\nchildren learned the language by hearing their parents talk it, and\r\nthat is how men learned to talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did Shaking the Head Come to Mean “No”?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of this method of indicating “No” is found in the result of\r\nthe mother’s efforts in the animal kingdom of trying to feed her young.\r\nA mother animal would be trying to get her young to accept the food she\r\nbrought them and tried to put it in their mouths. Perhaps, however, the\r\nyoung animal had had sufficient food or did not fancy the kind of food\r\noffered. The natural thing to do under the circumstances would be to\r\nclose the mouth tight and shake the head from side to side to prevent\r\nthe mother from forcing the food into the mouth. Thus we get the closed\r\nlips and the shaking the head from side to side to mean “No.” In other\r\nwords, that kind of a way of saying “No” came from an effort to say “I\r\ndon’t want any.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did a Nod Come to Mean “Yes”?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of nodding to mean “Yes” comes from the opposite of the action\r\nwhich, as just described, indicates a “No.”\r\n\r\nWhen the young animal was anxious to accept the offered food, it made\r\nan effort to get at the food quickly. Hence, the pushing forward of the\r\nhead and the open mouth (always more or less opened when you nod to\r\nindicate “Yes”) and an expression of gladness. You will notice if you\r\nsee anyone nod the head to indicate “Yes” that the lips are open rather\r\nthan closed, and that there is always a smile or an indication of a\r\nsmile to accompany it. In other words, the nod to mean “Yes” is only\r\nanother way of saying “I shall be pleased.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Count in Tens?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen man even in his uncivilized state found it necessary to count, the\r\nonly implements at hand were his fingers and toes, and as he had ten\r\ntoes and ten fingers, he naturally began counting in tens, and has been\r\ndoing so ever since.\r\n\r\nWhen we to-day count on our fingers we confine ourselves to our fingers\r\nleaving our toes stay in our shoes, where they naturally belong. But\r\nthe first men who counted used both fingers and toes, and so he was\r\nable to count twenty before he had to begin over again, while little\r\nchildren to-day, when they count with their fingers, must begin where\r\nthey started after they reach ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Does Man Mean by Counting Himself?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expression “counting himself” was originated by the first man who\r\ncounted. Such a man would count all of his fingers and toes and the\r\nresult would be twenty. Then, so that he would remember the number of\r\ntimes he had counted himself, he made a mark some place each time he\r\nreached twenty. The mark he made was a mere scratch in the dirt or on a\r\nhoe or something else. To make a scratch you merely, of course, score\r\nthe surface of whatever you happen to be scratching on, and that is how\r\nit happened that the word “score” in our language to-day means as a\r\nterm in counting, twenty.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great effort made to change our system of counting in\r\ntens to one where you count in twelves. That would fit in very well\r\nwith our system of measuring which is based on the foot of twelve\r\ninches, and of our calendar for recording the passage of time which has\r\ntwelve months. There are many arguments in favor of this change, among\r\nthe principal of which is the fact that it would make our problems of\r\ndivision much easier, for our ten can be evenly divided by but two of\r\nour single figures, two and five, whereas twelve can be evenly divided\r\nby four of our single figures, viz., two, three, four and six. It is\r\nbelieved that sooner or later the system of counting by twelve instead\r\nof ten will be adopted by the entire world for counting everything. As\r\nit is now we do part of our counting by one system and part of it by\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Did All the Names of People Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no scientific plan by which people get their names. There is\r\nnot much except curious interest to be gleaned from the study of how\r\npeople got their names.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days of the world, or at least as soon as men had\r\nlearned to speak by sounds, all known persons, places and groups of\r\nhuman beings must have had names by which they could be spoken of or\r\nto, and by which they were recognized. The study of these names and\r\nof their survival in civilization enables us in certain instances to\r\ntell what tribes inhabited certain parts of the earth now peopled\r\nby descendants of an entirely different race and of another speech\r\naltogether. We learn such things from the names of mountains and other\r\nthings, for instance, which still cling to them.\r\n\r\nThe story of personal names is very complex, but comes from very simple\r\nbeginnings. The oldest personal names were those which indicated a\r\ngroup of people rather than individuals who may have been actually\r\nrelated to each other or even bound together for reasons of protection\r\nor other convenience. In the races of Asia, Africa, Australia and\r\nAmerica examination shows that groups of people who considered\r\nthemselves to be of the same relationship, attached to themselves the\r\nname of some animal or other object, whether animate or inanimate, from\r\nwhich they claimed to be descended. This animal or object was called\r\nthe “totem,” and thus the earliest and most widely spread class and\r\nfamily names are totemistic. Such groups called themselves by names\r\nfrom wolves, turtles, bears, suns, moons, birds, and other objects, and\r\nthese people wore badges with pictures of the animal or object from\r\nwhich they took their names to identify them to other people.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, we come to investigate the giving of personal names among\r\nthe tribes, we see that most uncivilized races gave a name to each\r\nnew-born infant derived from some object or incident. So a new-born\r\nmember of the “Sun” tribe would be named “Dawn,” and would be known\r\nas “Dawn” of the “Sun” tribe; or perhaps a new-born son of the tribe\r\nof “Wolf” would be called “Hungry,” and be known as “Hungry Wolf.” A\r\nmember of the “Cloud” tribe would be named “Morning,” because he was\r\nborn in the morning. He would always be known as “Morning Cloud.”\r\n\r\nLater, as society became more established and paternity became\r\nrecognized, we find the totem name give way to a gentile name.\r\nAmong the Greeks and Romans the system was early adopted and proved\r\nsatisfactory. Thus we have Caius Julius Caesar. Caius indicates that\r\nhe is Roman; Julius is the gentile name given him and the Caesar a sort\r\nof hereditary nickname. On the other hand, the early Greeks began the\r\nsystem of introducing a local name instead of the gentile name. Thus\r\nThucydides (obtained from the grandfather), the son of Olorus, of the\r\nDeme (township) of Halimusia.\r\n\r\n~HOW DIFFERENT NAMES ORIGINATED~\r\n\r\nThis was all right and suited the purposes of the Greeks and Romans,\r\nwho had plenty of time to give full explanations in this way. But\r\nin Europe, for instance, civilization demanded more speed, and the\r\nincrease of population demanded more names, so that nicknames and names\r\nindicating personal descriptions and peculiarities came into use. Such\r\nnames as Long, Short, Small, Brown, White, Green and others of the\r\nsame kind came from this source, and as families grew these surnames\r\nstuck to the family and parents gave their children Christian names\r\nto further distinguish them as individuals. Other surnames such as\r\nFowler, Sadler, Smith, Farmer, etc., became attached to people because\r\nof the occupations in which they were engaged, and yet other names\r\nwere derived from places. The owner of an extensive estate would be\r\ndesignated by a Christian name which might be George (after his King)\r\nand then to indicate his landownership, von (meaning of) Wood, making\r\nthe combination of George von Wood, meaning George, the owner of the\r\nplace called Wood. On the other hand, he might have working for him a\r\nlaborer who lived at the place and, if his name was Hiram, they would,\r\nto indicate where he belonged, put the Wood after the Hiram; but, lest\r\nthere be confusion as to his class, they would put an At before the\r\nWood and make him Hiram Atwood, indicating his Christian name, where he\r\nworked and the fact that he was not a landowner.\r\n\r\nMany other names were invented in similar manner. When Adams became so\r\ncommon that there would likely be confusion on account of there being\r\nso many of them, a son of one of the Adams family would add to the name\r\nthe fact that he was a son by writing his name Adamson, and thus start\r\na new family name. Thus, in the same way also came Willson, Clarkson,\r\nand other names of that kind.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the Jews had only one word for a name, such as Isaac,\r\nJacob, Moses, etc. They became so numerous that it was impossible to\r\ndistinguish them, and so a commission was named to give surnames to\r\nall the Jews in addition to their other names. As the race was then,\r\nas now, held in derision by the rulers of many nations into which the\r\ntribe had become scattered, the people who had charge of the naming of\r\nthe Jews took advantage of the opportunity to make sport of them, and\r\ngave them such names as\r\n\r\nRosenstock (Rose bush),\r\n\r\nRosenszweig (Rose twig),\r\n\r\nRosenbaum (Rose tree),\r\n\r\nBlumenstock (Flower bush),\r\n\r\nBlumenthal (Flower valley),\r\n\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nOur Christian names are from similar sources, and while many of them\r\nare well selected because of their beautiful meanings, there are many\r\nof them which mean nothing as words as they were only invented for the\r\npurpose of giving a new name to a new child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can You Blow Out a Candle?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you light a candle it burns, because the lighted wick heats the\r\nwax sufficiently to turn it into gases, which mix with the oxygen in\r\nthe air and produce fire in the form of light. You know it is not easy\r\nto light a candle quickly. You must hold the lighted match to the wick\r\nuntil the wax begins to melt and change to gases. As long as the wax\r\ncontinues hot enough to melt and turn to gas the candle will burn until\r\nall burned up; but if there is a break in the continuous process of\r\nchanging the wax to gas, the light will go out. Now, when you blow at\r\nthe lighted candle, you blow the gases which feed the flame away from\r\nthe lighted wick, and this makes a break in the continuous flow of gas\r\nfrom the wax to taper, and the light goes out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Photograph\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does a Camera Take a Picture?\r\n\r\nWhen we look upon the surface of a mirror we see the image of ourself\r\nand our surroundings. The extent of the view depends upon the size of\r\nthe mirror and the distance we are standing from it.\r\n\r\nIf we hold the mirror close to our face we see only the face, or\r\nperhaps but a portion of it, and the farther away we are the more\r\nthe mirror will reflect, only, of course, the various images will be\r\nsmaller. The mirror reflecting exactly what the eye sees, without doubt\r\nhad a great influence in inducing the experiments that resulted in the\r\nprocess we call photography.\r\n\r\nThe taking of a photograph with a camera may in a way be compared\r\nwith the action of your eyes, when you gaze upon your reflection in a\r\nmirror, or look at any object or view. Any object in a light strong\r\nenough to render it visible will reflect rays of light from every point.\r\n\r\nNow, the eye contains a lens very similar in form to that used in a\r\ncamera. This lens collects the rays of light reflected from the object\r\nlooked at and brings them to a focus in the back of the eye, forming an\r\nimage or picture of whatever we see, just as the mirror collects the\r\nrays of light and reflects them back through the lens of the eye.\r\n\r\nCertain nerves transmit the impression of the image so focused in the\r\nback of the eye to the brain and we experience the sensation of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Eye of the Camera?\r\n\r\nThe lens is the eye of the camera, and the process we call photography\r\nis the method employed to make permanent the image the eye or lens of\r\nthe camera presents to a sensitive surface within the camera.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows a simple form of camera, it being merely a light tight box\r\nwith a lens fitted to the front, and a means for holding a sensitive\r\nplate at the back, the plate being placed at just the right distance to\r\nfocus the rays of light admitted through the lens in exactly the same\r\nmanner as the rays of light pass through the lens of the eye and come\r\nto a focus in the back part of the eye.\r\n\r\nNow, if we could look inside the camera we would note that the image\r\nwas inverted, or upside down.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 will explain this.\r\n\r\nThe rays of light from “A” pass in a straight line through the lens\r\n“B” until they are interrupted by “C,” upon which they strike, forming\r\nan upside down image of the object “A.” But, you exclaim, “we do not\r\nsee things upside down.” No, we do not, because some mental process\r\nreadjusts this during the passing of the impression from the eye to our\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose we have our camera loaded with its sensitive plate or\r\nfilm. We select some object or view we wish to photograph, uncover\r\nthe lens for an instant, and let the light impress the image upon the\r\nsensitive surface of the plate or film. Now, how are we going to make\r\nthis image permanent?\r\n\r\nIf we were to examine the creamy yellow strip of film upon which the\r\npicture was taken there would seemingly be no difference between its\r\npresent appearance and before the snapshot was made.\r\n\r\nNow let us suppose that this strip of film is a little trundle bed, and\r\nin it tucked securely away from the light are many hundreds of little\r\nchaps called silver bromides, little roly-poly fellows lying just as\r\nclose together as possible, and protected by a coverlet of pure white\r\ngelatine.\r\n\r\n~HOW A PHOTOGRAPH IS DEVELOPED~\r\n\r\nUntil the sudden flash of light in their faces when the picture was\r\ntaken, they have been content to lie still and sleep soundly. Now\r\nthey are seized with a strange unrest, and each little atom is eager\r\nto do his part in showing your picture to the world. Alone they are\r\npowerless, but they have, all unbeknown to them, some powerful chemical\r\nfriends, who, organized and aided by the photographer, will bring\r\nabout their transformation. These chemicals, with the help of the\r\nphotographer, form themselves into a society called the developer.\r\n\r\nThe photographer takes just so many of the tiny feathery crystals of\r\npyro, just so many of the clear little atoms of sulphite of soda, and\r\njust so many little crystals of carbonate of soda, and tumbles them\r\nall into a beaker of clear cold water. Unaided by each other, any one\r\nof these chemicals would be powerless to help their little bromide\r\nof silver friends. The first of these chemicals to go to work is the\r\ncarbonate of soda.\r\n\r\nHe tiptoes softly over to the trundle bed and gently begins turning\r\nback the gelatine covers over the little bromide of silver chaps, so\r\nthat Pyro can find them in the dark.\r\n\r\nIt is Pyro’s mission to transform the little silver bromides into\r\nsilver metal, but he is rather an impulsive chap, so he is accompanied\r\nby sulphite of soda, who warns him not to be too rough, and whose sole\r\nmission is to strain his eagerness to help his friends.\r\n\r\n“Go slow now,” says Sulphite, “don’t frighten the little silver\r\nbromides, or else you’ll make them cuddle up in heaps, and the picture\r\nwon’t be as nice as if you wake them up gently and each little bromide\r\nstayed just where he belonged.”\r\n\r\nAfter all the little silver bromides that the light shone on have been\r\ntransformed into metallic silver by the developer, another chemical\r\nfriend has to step in and carry away all the little bromides that were\r\nnot awakened by the flash of light.\r\n\r\nThis friend’s name is “Hypo,” and in a few minutes he has carried away\r\nall the little bromides that are still sleeping, so that the trundle\r\nbed with the now awakened and transformed silver bromides will, after\r\nwashing and drying, be called a negative, and ready to print your\r\npictures from.\r\n\r\nIf we take this negative, as it is called, and hold it up to the\r\nlight, we will see that everything is reversed, not only from right to\r\nleft, but also that whatever is white or light in color is dark in the\r\nnegative, and that what would correspond to the darker parts of our\r\npicture are the lightest in the negative, and it is from these facts\r\nthat we give it the name negative.\r\n\r\nNow, to get our picture as it should be, we must place this negative in\r\ncontact with a sheet of coated paper that is also sensitive to light.\r\n\r\nSo we place the negative and the sheet of sensitive paper in what is\r\ncalled a printing frame, with the negative uppermost, so that the light\r\nmay shine through the negative, and impress the image upon the sheet of\r\nsensitive paper. Now, it stands to reason that if the lightest parts of\r\nour picture are the darkest in the negative that less light can pass\r\nthrough such portions of the negative in a given time, so that with the\r\nproper exposure to light the image upon the sheet of sensitive paper\r\nwill be a correct picture of whatever the lens saw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The swiftest thing that the human race has ever put into\r\nmotion is the steel projectile of a twelve-inch gun. No human eye can\r\nfollow its flight. Released at a pressure of forty thousand pounds to\r\nthe square inch--in a heat at which diamonds melt and carbon boils--it\r\nhurls through the air at the rate of twenty-five miles a minute, and\r\nreaches the mark _ahead of its own sound_! (Pictures and story by\r\ncourtesy of McClure’s Magazine.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY-FIVE MILES A MINUTE\r\n\r\nAN EXCLUSIVE STORY, ILLUSTRATED WITH A SERIES OF REMARKABLE PHOTOGRAPHS\r\nTAKEN WITH THE FASTEST CAMERA IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nBY CLEVELAND MOFFETT\r\n\r\n~HOW SHOOTING SHELLS ARE PHOTOGRAPHED~\r\n\r\nOne of the most progressive branches of our military service is the\r\nDepartment of Coast Defenses, which, under the far-seeing guidance of\r\nGeneral E. M. Weaver, holds our shores and harbors in a state of alert\r\npreparedness against foreign aggression. At Hampton Roads sits the\r\nCoast Artillery Board, composed of officers and consulting engineers\r\nto whom are referred all problems relating to coast artillery, and who\r\nhave the responsibility of testing all new instruments proposed for\r\nartillery use. The purpose of this article is to describe one among\r\nseveral notable achievements of the Hampton Roads Coast Artillery\r\nSchool, this particular work having been done by Captain F. J. Behr of\r\nthe Coast Artillery Corps, who, after years of effort, has recently\r\ndeveloped a system that makes it possible to take pictures of the\r\nswiftest moving bodies, the great steel projectiles of our biggest\r\nguns--to seize them with the camera’s eye as they hurl through the air\r\nat enormous velocities or at the very moment of their emergence from\r\nthe gun muzzles, and to preserve these images, never seen before, for\r\nmilitary study and comparison. Captain Behr was ably assisted in this\r\nwork by Engineer J. A. Wilson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FASTEST CAMERA IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\n  The big gun, equipped with the fastest camera shutter in the world,\r\n  about to be fired and the shell photographed.\r\n\r\nFor years a young officer of the Coast Artillery has been trying to\r\ndevise a camera so incredibly swift that it will record every stage of\r\nthis lightning flight from the gun-barrel to the target. At last he has\r\nsucceeded. His photographs--some of them taken one hundred thousandth\r\nof a second apart--have revealed remarkable and unsuspected facts to\r\nthe military world. The story of his invention had never before been\r\ntold.]\r\n\r\n\r\nReckoning in Millionths of a Second.\r\n\r\nSome of the increments and decrements of time involved in the series of\r\nphotographs herewith published (several of them for the first time) are\r\nas small as one ten-thousandth part of a second. And Captain Behr has\r\ndevised a method of taking photographs of projectiles as they arrive at\r\na steel target and penetrate the target, inch by inch, that involves\r\nincrements or decrements of time as small as the one hundred-thousandth\r\npart of a second. To the uninitiated it seems incredible that such\r\ninfinitesimal divisions of time can be used in practical calculations;\r\nbut every trained physicist knows that in wireless work scientists of\r\nto-day speak casually of experiments that take account of _two-tenths\r\nor one-tenth of a millionth part of a second_!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROJECTILE EMERGING FROM MORTAR\r\n\r\nIn this photograph--the first of a remarkable series showing five\r\nstages of a moving projectile--the half-ton projectile seems to be\r\nstanding still, but really it is traveling at the rate of 900 miles an\r\nhour. The gunners here work in concrete pits 34 feet high. Underneath\r\nthe mounts are the powder magazines. Each pit has four mortars usually\r\nserved by an entire Coast Artillery Company. The projectiles are the\r\nsame as those used in the twelve-inch guns, but less powder is required\r\nbecause mortar projectiles are hurled high in the air, not straight at\r\na vessel, and deliver their destructive blows downward from a great\r\nheight.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SMOKE RINGS WHICH APPEAR\r\n\r\nThis second photograph shows the projectile almost entirely out of the\r\nmortar. Its sharp nose may be seen above the “gas-ring” forming at its\r\nupper end. These “gas-rings,” or “smoke-rings,” come without warning,\r\nand only occasionally, perhaps once in eight or ten shots. They rise\r\nswiftly to the height of fifty or a hundred feet, growing larger\r\nand larger, and giving forth a weird, shrieking sound like a second\r\nprojectile. Some insist that these “smoke-rings” are as hard as steel,\r\nowing to the enormous compression of their composing gases, and the\r\nstory is told of a bird caught in the path of one of them and torn to\r\npieces.]\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the projectile after it leaves the gun, or after\r\nthe discharge of the gun, and before the projectile has had time to\r\nissue from the gun-barrel? What is the action at the muzzle of gases\r\ngenerated? What shape do these gases assume as they leave the gun? What\r\ncauses the much-discussed “gas-rings” that sometimes form when a mortar\r\nis fired, and oftener do not form? What phenomena attend the arrival\r\nof the projectile at a solid steel target? Is the steel actually fused\r\nby the heat of impact? Is it vaporized? Or what? These are some of\r\nthe questions that Captain Behr set himself to solve, or to help in\r\nsolving, as he worked out his methods of rapid photography. His aims\r\nwere strictly military, but his results make fascinating appeal to the\r\ngeneral imagination. Fancy doing anything in the one hundred-thousandth\r\npart of a second!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROJECTILE HIDDEN BY THE SMOKE CONE\r\n\r\nIn the third photograph the smoke-cone is almost perfect and gives the\r\nfamous “powder-puff” effect. It still hides the projectile, although\r\nthe latter is traveling at a velocity that would take it from New York\r\nto Chicago in one hour. At night the “gas-rings” present a startling\r\nand fascinating appearance, burning with a reddish orange glow, and\r\nwhirling with a complicated double motion, strange opalescent balls,\r\nlike rings of Saturn. A study of these photographs--the first record\r\never made of the “gas-rings”--has led some experts to the conclusion\r\nthat the cause of the rings is defective ramming of the projectile.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROJECTILE EMERGING FROM SMOKE CONE\r\n\r\nThe fourth photograph shows the projectile emerging from the smoke-cone\r\nabout thirty feet above the muzzle of the mortar. The men who fire\r\nthese mortars from the mortar-pits never see the distant target or\r\nvessel they are firing at, but point their mortars according to\r\ndirections transmitted to them (usually by telephone) from observers at\r\ndistant stations. And so great a degree of precision has been attained\r\nthat, on certain practice occasions at Hampton Roads, a record of nine\r\nhits out of ten shots has been scored on a moving target five miles out\r\nin the ocean. This picture shows the smoke-cone as first seen by the\r\nhuman eye.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Behr’s general idea was to utilize some phenomena connected\r\nwith the discharge to actuate, by electrical connections, a mechanism\r\nthat would work a rapid shutter in a properly placed camera. The\r\nphenomenon of concussion was tried first--the smash of air against a\r\nlittle swinging door; but this was much too slow. The projectile was\r\nhundreds of yards away before the camera had registered its picture.\r\nAnd that chance was gone!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROJECTILE HIGH IN THE AIR\r\n\r\nIn the fifth photograph the projectile is seen entirely clear of the\r\nsmoke-cone and well started on its long flight. Climbing into the sky\r\nat this steep angle, it will reach a height of from three to six miles\r\nbefore it begins to descend. There are harbors on our coasts guarded by\r\nso many guns and mortars that if these were fired simultaneously they\r\ncould hurl against a given small area a converging rain of projectiles\r\naggregating more than fifty tons in their combined mass. A minute later\r\nthey could hurl another fifty tons against the same small area; and so\r\non as long as the ammunition lasted.]\r\n\r\nIn the next trial, several months later, Captain Behr arranged to\r\nhave the electrical connections made or broken by the movement of the\r\ngun-carriage itself in recoiling; but the result was unsatisfactory.\r\nNor was he more fortunate at the succeeding target practice, when,\r\nhaving placed the apparatus farther forward on the parapet, he had the\r\ncamera demolished by the force of the concussion and several blades of\r\nthe rapid shutter broken. He was satisfied, now, that his effort to\r\nactuate the camera mechanism from the gun-carriage would never give the\r\nrequisite precision in results, and he saw that he must work with a\r\ndevice functioning more reliably.\r\n\r\nIn the months that followed before the next target practice, the\r\nCaptain did some experimenting, and finally determined making the\r\nprojectile itself displace a length of piano-wire fixed across the\r\nmuzzle of the gun, and thus actuate the electrical system and operate\r\nthe shutter. In this way he eliminated troublesome variables of\r\nrecoil, elasticity of the carriage, etc., leaving to determine only\r\nthe time element of the electrical system to function. This result was\r\nadmirable, and, after taking several similar pictures, the captain\r\nfound that he could now operate with great precision--that is, he could\r\nget the same phase of the discharge with almost identical shapes of\r\ngas-cone and smoke-cloud, and he could get these every time.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1912 Captain Behr succeeded in obtaining a series of\r\nextremely rapid photographs showing a twelve-inch mortar battery in\r\naction. In taking these pictures the camera was placed on an elevation\r\nabout ten feet above the concrete floor and about sixty feet back of\r\nthe mortars. The electrical device for working the shutter was actuated\r\nby the mortar itself in its recoil. These pictures were taken in about\r\none five-thousandth of a second--which is the more remarkable as the\r\nlast two were taken in the shade after 4.30 A.M. The first three were\r\ntaken about noon, in the sunshine, as the shadows show.\r\n\r\nSo great was the precision of the electrical device as to render\r\npossible the photographic recording of these mortar projectiles,\r\nmoving at great velocities, in almost any desired position after the\r\ndischarge, say two feet away from the muzzle, or six feet away, or\r\ntwenty feet away, or right at the muzzle, as shown in the first mortar\r\npicture, where the great projectile has been caught in its flight half\r\nway out of the mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\nPictures Never Seen By the Human Eye.\r\n\r\n~A CAMERA THAT IS FASTER THAN THE EYE~\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that of these five mortar pictures,\r\nrepresenting five phases of the firing, only the last two are ever\r\nseen by the human eye. The far swifter camera, acting in about one\r\nfive-thousandth of a second, has caught all these phases as reproduced\r\nhere; but, to the ordinary observer standing by, the first visible\r\nimpression after firing is that of the smoke-cone as developed in\r\nNumber Four. The strange “powder-puff” effect shown in Number Three is\r\nnever seen; nor the earlier effects in Numbers One and Two. Nor is any\r\nsound heard by an observer or by the gun crew until the third or fourth\r\nphase has been reached. This is a matter of simple calculation.\r\n\r\nSound travels through the air very slowly as compared with light, and\r\nin Numbers One, Two, and Three, although the crashing explosion has\r\ntaken place and the projectile is already started on its long journey,\r\nthe men (even the lanyard man, who is nearest), have heard nothing,\r\nsince the sound-waves have not yet had time to reach their ears. Nor\r\nhas the mortar itself had time to recoil, as it does presently, down\r\ninto the well in the floor of the pit.\r\n\r\nThe men aboard the towing vessels that drag the floating targets during\r\ngun and mortar practice would seem to be in a dangerous position, since\r\nthe tow-line is not more than two hundred yards long for guns and\r\nfive hundred yards long for mortars, and a very slight error in aim\r\nor adjustment might cause a deviation of several hundred yards when\r\nthe range is eight or ten thousand yards. As a matter of fact, such\r\nerrors do not occur, and a gun-pointer who would make a right or left\r\ndeviation from the target of ten yards, or at the most fifteen yards\r\nat a distance of five miles, would be considered unfit for his job.\r\nIn one or two rare instances a towing vessel has been struck when a\r\nprojectile has fallen short and then ricochetted to the right, as it\r\ninvariably does owing to its rotation in that direction. The rifling of\r\nthe gun-barrel causes this rotation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This shows one of Captain Behr’s earliest efforts to\r\nphotograph the projectile from a twelve-inch gun. The man on the\r\nplatform has been adjusting the electrical connections that actuate\r\nthe camera mechanism. The halo effect at the muzzle of the gun is due\r\nto compressed air caused by the forward rush of the projectile. The\r\nprojectile has not yet emerged from the muzzle of the gun. On the right\r\nis the place where the “Merrimac” and the “Monitor” had their famous\r\nfight.]\r\n\r\nSometimes these great projectiles ricochet several times, and go\r\nbounding over the water as a pebble skips along the surface of a\r\nmill-pond, only there may be the distance of a mile or more between\r\nthese giant leaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Projectile Travels Faster Than the Sound It Makes.\r\n\r\nA strange phenomenon is witnessed by the observer on a towing vessel as\r\nhe looks, rather uneasily perhaps, toward the distant shore battery,\r\nthat seems to be firing straight at him. First there is a flash and\r\na puff of smoke; then nothing for a period of seconds, while the\r\nprojectile is on its way; then suddenly a great splash as the mass of\r\niron strikes the water. Up to this moment there has been no sound of\r\nthe discharge, no sound of the projectile, since it travels faster than\r\nthe sound-waves; but now, _after_ it has buried itself in the ocean, is\r\nheard its own unmistakable voice, a low, buzzing _um-m-m-m_ approaching\r\nfrom the shore. The projectile itself has arrived _before_ the sound\r\nthat it makes in transit, and the sound arrives afterward. Last of all\r\nis heard the boom of the discharge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GUN THAT PHOTOGRAPHED ITS OWN SHOT\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful picture the hurling projectile was itself the\r\nphotographer: that is, in passing out of the gun-barrel, it broke a\r\nlength of piano-wire stretched across the muzzle and thus automatically\r\nclosed an electrical circuit that actuated the camera mechanism. And so\r\nrapid was the shutter that the great shot hurled forth in the discharge\r\nphotographed here has not yet had time to issue from the smoke-cone,\r\nwhere it is still hidden.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the great velocity of gun projectiles, it is almost impossible\r\nfor an observer near the target to see them as they approach; but a\r\ntrained eye can discern the slower moving mortar projectiles as they\r\ndrop out of the sky, shrieking as they come, curving downward from a\r\nheight of four or five miles, half a ton falling from a height of four\r\nor five miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPLODING A SUBMARINE MINE\r\n\r\nThis photograph illustrates another important form of coast\r\ndefense--the submarine mine. A target about 5 by 5 feet, with a red\r\nflag at its apex, is towed across the mine-field, the mines being\r\nexploded electrically from a shore station several miles away. The\r\nmethods of laying and exploding these mines are carefully kept secrets.\r\nIn this case a charge of five hundred pounds of the newest explosive\r\nwas used. Fragments of the shattered target and mine-buoy are seen at\r\nthe right of the picture. Tons of water are hurled into the air by\r\nthese explosions, and hundreds of fish are killed or stunned.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to realize what an enormous force is released when one\r\nof these twelve-inch guns is discharged. The pressure inside of the\r\ngun behind the projectile is between thirty-five and forty thousand\r\npounds to the square inch. No engine or machine made by man produces\r\nanything like this pressure. The boiler pressure in steam-engines,\r\nor in big turbines driven by superheated steam, does not exceed two\r\nhundred or three hundred pounds to the square inch. The huge hydraulic\r\npresses that would crumple up a steel girder do not exert a pressure\r\nof more than one thousand pounds to the square inch. The only reason\r\na gun-barrel can resist this pressure (forty thousand pounds to the\r\nsquare inch) is that it is built up in a series of concentric steel\r\nhoops or tubes shrunk one over the other until there is a resistance\r\ncapacity of from seventy thousand to ninety thousand pounds to the\r\nsquare inch. Even at rest, the barrels of these great guns are under\r\nsuch enormous compression, from being thus squeezed within these outer\r\nsteel coverings, that, if the retaining steel jackets were suddenly\r\ncut, the tubes would blow themselves into pieces from the violent\r\nreaction of release.\r\n\r\nNot only does this smokeless powder, burning inside these guns,\r\nproduce enormous pressure, but it generates inconceivably great heat.\r\nWater boils at 100° Centigrade; iron melts at 1400°; platinum and\r\nthe most resistant metals at 2900°; while the hottest thing on earth\r\nis the temperature of the electric arc, in which carbon boils. This\r\ntemperature is between 3000° and 4000° Centigrade, and is believed to\r\nbe the same as that of these great powder chambers when the gun is\r\nfired. Thus a diamond, the hardest substance known, would melt in the\r\nbarrel of a twelve-inch gun at the moment of discharge. The consequence\r\nis that at each discharge of a big gun a thin skin of metal inside\r\nthe barrel is literally fused, and this leads to rapid erosion of\r\nthe softened surfaces under the tearing pressure of gases generated.\r\nThe rifling is worn away; the band over the projectile becomes\r\nloose-fitting; and soon the huge gun, that has cost such a great sum,\r\nis rendered unfit for service. The life of a twelve-inch gun is only\r\n450 rounds, that is, the gun would be worn out if fired every three\r\nminutes for a single day. After that a new life may be given it by\r\nboring out the inner tube and putting in a new steel lining.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Secret for Which Foreign Governments Would Pay Millions.\r\n\r\nA few words may be added about the formidable smokeless powder used in\r\nthese great guns. This powder, in spite of its terrible power, is of\r\ninnocent appearance, and a small stick of it may be held safely in the\r\nhand while it burns with a vivid yellowish flame. There is no danger\r\nof its exploding or detonating like gun-cotton, and yet it is made\r\nfrom gun-cotton, treated by a colloiding process that is one of our\r\njealously guarded military secrets. There are foreign governments that\r\nwould give millions to know exactly how this powder is made and how it\r\nis preserved for years without deterioration. The recent destruction of\r\ntwo ships of the French navy was due, it is believed, to deterioration\r\nof their smokeless powder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Some Eyes In a Picture Seem to Follow Us?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a person’s picture is taken with the eyes of the person looking\r\ndirectly into the lens or opening of the camera, then the eyes in\r\nthe picture will always be directly on and appear to follow whoever\r\nis looking at it. This is also true of paintings. If a subject being\r\npainted is posed so as to look directly at the painter, and the artist\r\npaints the picture with the eyes so pointed, then the eyes of the\r\npicture will follow you. When you are looking at a picture of a person\r\nand the eyes do not follow you, you will know at once that he was not\r\nlooking at the camera or artist when the picture was being taken or\r\npainted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does a Light Go When It Goes Out?\r\n\r\n\r\n~WHY YOU CAN BLOW OUT A CANDLE~\r\n\r\nTo understand the answer to this question fully you will first have to\r\nlearn what light is, and particularly that it is not the flame from\r\nthe gas jet or of the lamp or candle that is actually the light, but\r\nthat light consists of rays or waves in the ether, which is constantly\r\nin all space and even in our bodies, coming from the something that\r\nis burning. This in the instance above mentioned would be the gas\r\nburning as it comes out of the gas jet, the oil in the lamp as it comes\r\nup through the wick or the flame of the candle. We are apt to call\r\na lighted gas jet a lamp, or a candle, light, because it is steady.\r\nReally, however, there is no such thing as keeping light in a room in\r\nan actual sense, for rays of light travel from the substance which\r\nproduces them faster than anything else we know of in the world. The\r\nfirst thing a light wave does when it is once created is to go some\r\nplace, and it does this at the rate of 186,000 miles per second. If it\r\ncannot penetrate the walls of the room it is either reflected back in\r\nthe direction from which it came or transformed by the objects which it\r\nstrikes into some other kind of energy.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the rays coming from a gas jet, you do not see one ray\r\nfor more than, say the millionth part of a second, but because these\r\nrays of light come so fast one after the other from the burning jet and\r\nspread in all directions, they seem to be continuous.\r\n\r\nSo you see that the rays of light are going away as fast as they are\r\ncoming from the gas jet. They either go on as light or, as said above,\r\nare changed into other forms of energy when they strike things they\r\ncannot penetrate in the form of light, or rather one thing, which is\r\nheat. A large part of it goes into the air in the room in the form of\r\nheat, as you well know, now that it is called to your attention. Some\r\nof it goes into the furniture and some of it is changed into another\r\nform of heat, which, combining with the chemicals in other things it\r\nmixes with, changes their appearance and usefulness. As, for instance,\r\nthe carpets and hangings in the room, the colors of which become faded\r\nwhen exposed to light rays too much. The heat from the light rays is\r\nresponsible for the fading of colors in our garments as well.\r\n\r\nWhen you “put out the light,” as we say, or turn off the gas, you cut\r\noff the source of light. Really, then, our expression that “the light\r\ngoes out” is only true while the gas is lighted, for from the flaming\r\ngas jet the light is going out all the time, whereas when the gas is\r\nturned off no light is being produced, and when you turn off the gas\r\nyou do not turn out the light, but only that which makes light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Fire Go Out?\r\n\r\n\r\nFire will go out naturally when there is nothing left to burn, or it\r\nwill go out if it cannot secure enough oxygen out of the air to keep it\r\ngoing. In the first case it dies what we might call a “natural death,”\r\nand in the latter case the fire practically suffocates. The fire in\r\nthe open fireplace, if it has plenty of air, will burn up everything\r\nburnable that it can reach. The stones of the fireplace or other parts\r\nof a stove will not burn, because they have already been burned, and\r\nyou cannot burn anything a second time, if all of the oxygen in it was\r\nburned out of it the first time.\r\n\r\nNow, then, to burn up a thing, you must first start a fire under it,\r\nand then keep a constant draft of air playing on it from beneath, or\r\nthe fire will die out. The more difficult a thing is to burn, the more\r\nimportant it is that you have plenty of draft. If the ashes accumulate\r\nunder the fire the air cannot go through them in sufficient quantity\r\nand the fire will go out. Other things which prevent the current of air\r\nfrom going up through the fire will cause it to go out. That is why we\r\nclose the lower door of the furnace, to keep the fire from burning out.\r\nWhen we shut off the draft of air from below, the fire in the furnace\r\nburns slowly, i. e., it just hangs on, so to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Lamp Give a Better Light With the Chimney On?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a lamp is burning without a chimney it generally smokes. That\r\nis because the oil which is coming up through the wick is being only\r\npartially burned. The carbon, which is about one-half of what the oil\r\ncontains, is not being burned at all, and goes off into the air in\r\nlittle black specks with the gases which are thrown off. The reason\r\nthe carbon is not burned when the chimney is off is that there is not\r\nsufficient oxygen from the air combining with it, as it is separated\r\nfrom the oil in the partial combustion that is going on. To make the\r\ncarbon in the oil burn you must mix it with plenty of oxygen at a\r\ncertain temperature, and this can only be done by forcing sufficient\r\noxygen through the flame to bring the heat of the flame to the point\r\nwhere the carbon will combine with it and burn. When you put the\r\nchimney on the lamp you create a draft which forces more oxygen through\r\nthe flame, brings the heat up to the proper temperature and enables the\r\ncarbon to combine with it and burn. When you take the chimney off again\r\nthe heat goes down, when the draft is shut off and the lamp smokes\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe chimney also protects the flame of the lamp from drafts from the\r\nsides and above, and helps to make a brighter light, because a steady\r\nlight is brighter than a flickering one.\r\n\r\nThe draft created by the chimney also forces the gases produced by the\r\nburning oil up and away from the flame. Some of these gases have a\r\ntendency to put out a light or a fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Light Weigh Anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get at the answer to this question we must go back to the definition\r\nof light. Light is a wave in the ether and contains no particles of\r\nmatter. It, therefore, does not weigh anything at all.\r\n\r\nWhen men had studied light thoroughly, however, they came to the\r\nconclusion that it must have the power of pressure, which, from the\r\nstandpoint of results, would amount to the same thing as having weight.\r\nThey reasoned that if you had a perfect balance and let sunlight shine\r\ndown on one of the sides of the balance, that side should go down under\r\nthe pressure of light. In their first experiments along this line men\r\nfailed to show that under such conditions the side of the balance on\r\nwhich the light shone did go down, but by continuous experiments it was\r\nproved finally that the light did exert a sufficient pressure to cause\r\nthe scales to go down, and in effect this is the same as having weight;\r\nbut this has been found to be a common property of rays of various\r\nkinds, including heat, and we, therefore, do not speak of this quality\r\nas weight, but as the power of radiating pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Stick Seem to Bend When Put in Water?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen light passes from one medium to another, as for example from glass\r\nor water to air, or from air or glass to water, the rays of light\r\nchange their course, thus making them seem to be bent or broken. The\r\nrays of light from the part of the stick in the water take a different\r\ndirection from the rays from the part which is out of the water, giving\r\nthe appearance of breaking or bending at the place where the air and\r\nwater meet. It is, of course, the light rays which are bent and not the\r\nobject itself.\r\n\r\nThis bending or changing of the path of light rays is called\r\nrefraction. If you place a coin in a glass of water so that it may be\r\nviewed obliquely, you can apparently see two coins, a small one through\r\nthe surface of the water and another apparently magnified through the\r\nside of the glass.\r\n\r\nThis is due only to the absolute principle that rays of light change\r\ntheir direction in passing from one thing to another, and on this\r\nprinciple of the rays of light our optical instruments, including the\r\nmicroscope, the telescope, the camera and eyeglasses are based.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Stars Twinkle?\r\n\r\n\r\nI might tell you, just to show how clever I am, that stars do not\r\ntwinkle at all, and leave you with that for an answer. But since they\r\nreally do seem to twinkle, and that is what causes your question,\r\nI will tell you. As we have already learned in our talks about the\r\nstars and the sky in general, the stars are suns which are constantly\r\nthrowing off light, just as our sun gives us light, and when this light\r\nstrikes the air which surrounds the earth it meets many objects--little\r\nparticles of dust and other things always floating about in it. The\r\nlight comes to us in the form of rays from the stars and some of\r\nthese rays strike particles of various kinds in the air and are thus\r\ninterfered with. If you are looking at a lighted window some distance\r\naway and there are a lot of boys and girls or men and women running\r\npast the window, one after the other, rapidly, it will make the\r\nlight in the window appear to twinkle. The twinkling is due to the\r\ninterference which the rays of light encounter while traveling toward\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does an Onion Make the Tears Come?\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is nature’s way of protecting the eyes from the smarting which the\r\nonion would cause in your eyes if the tears did not come quickly and\r\novercome the bad effect so produced. Tears are provided for washing the\r\nball of your eyes. Every time you wink a little tear is released from\r\nunder the eyelid, and the wink spreads it all over the eyeball. This\r\nwashes down the front of the eyeball and cleanses it of all dust and\r\nother things that fly at the eye from the air. Then the tear runs along\r\na little channel, much like a trough, at the lower part of the eye,\r\nand out through a little hole in the eye, and in this case the tear is\r\nreally only an eye-wash. Many things, but more often sadness or injured\r\nfeelings, start the tears coming so fast from under the eyelid that the\r\nlittle trough at the bottom and the hole in the corner of the eye are\r\ntoo small to hold them or carry them off, so they roll over the edge of\r\nthe lower eyelid and down the face. These are what we call tears. Among\r\nother things that will cause tear-glands to cause an over-supply of\r\neye-wash to come down, are onions. What they give off is very trying to\r\nthe eyes, and so, just as soon as the something which an onion throws\r\noff hits the eyeball, the nerves of the eye telegraph the brain to turn\r\non the tears quickly, and they come in a little deluge and counteract\r\nthe bad effect of the onion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME REMARKABLE PICTURES WITH A FAST CAMERA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAVE MAN OF PREHISTORIC TIMES WHO UNCONSCIOUSLY\r\nINVENTED AMMUNITION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Missile\r\n\r\n\r\n~HOW MAN LEARNED TO SHOOT~\r\n\r\nA naked savage found himself in the greatest danger. A wild beast,\r\nhungry and fierce was about to attack him. Escape was impossible.\r\nRetreat was cut off. He must fight for his life--but how?\r\n\r\nShould he bite, scratch or kick? Should he strike with his fist? These\r\nwere the natural defences of his body, but what were they against the\r\nteeth, the claws and the tremendous muscles of his enemy? Should he\r\nwrench a dead branch from a tree and use it for a club? That would\r\nbring him within striking distance to be torn to pieces before he could\r\ndeal a second blow.\r\n\r\nThere was but a moment in which to act. Swiftly he seized a jagged\r\nfragment of rock from the ground and hurled it with all his force at\r\nthe blazing eyes before him; then another, and another, until the\r\nbeast, dazed and bleeding from the unexpected blows, fell back and gave\r\nhim a chance to escape. He knew that he had saved his life, but there\r\nwas something else which his dull brain failed to realize.\r\n\r\nHe had invented arms and ammunition!\r\n\r\nIn other words, he had needed to strike a harder blow than the blow of\r\nhis fist, at a greater distance than the length of his arm, and his\r\nbrain showed him how to do it. After all, what is a modern rifle but a\r\ndevice which man has made with his brain permitting him to strike an\r\nenormously hard blow at a wonderful distance? Firearms are really but a\r\nmore perfect form of stone-throwing, and this early Cave Man took the\r\nfirst step that has led down the ages.\r\n\r\nThis strange story of a development has been taking place slowly\r\nthrough thousands and thousands of years, so that today you are able to\r\ntake a swift shot at distant game instead of merely throwing stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SLING MAN IN ACTION\r\n\r\nPRACTICE DEVELOPED SOME WONDERFUL MARKSMEN AMONG THE USERS OF THIS\r\nPRIMITIVE WEAPON]\r\n\r\nWe do not know the name of the man who invented the sling. Possibly\r\nhe did not even have a name, but in some way he hit upon a scheme\r\nfor throwing stones farther, harder, and straighter than any of his\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nThe men and women in the Cave Colony suddenly found that one\r\nbright-eyed young fellow, with a little straighter forehead than the\r\nothers, was beating them all at hunting. During weeks he had been going\r\naway mysteriously, for hours each day. Now, whenever he left the camp\r\nhe was sure to bring home game, while the other men would straggle back\r\nfor the most part empty-handed.\r\n\r\nWas it witchcraft? They decided to investigate.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, one morning several of them followed at a careful distance\r\nas he sought the shore of a stream where water-fowl might be found.\r\nParting the leaves, they saw him pick up a pebble from the bank and\r\nthen to their surprise, take off his girdle of skin and place the stone\r\nin its center, holding both ends with his right hand.\r\n\r\nStranger still, he whirled the girdle twice around his head, then\r\nreleased one end so that the leather strip flew out and the stone shot\r\nstraight at a bird in the water.\r\n\r\nThe mystery was solved. They had seen the first slingman in action.\r\n\r\nThe new plan worked with great success, and a little practice made\r\nexpert marksmen. We know that most of the early races used it for\r\nhunting and in war. We find it shown in pictures made many thousands of\r\nyears ago in ancient Egypt and Assyria. We find it in the Roman Army\r\nwhere the slingman was called a “funditor.”\r\n\r\nSurely, too, you remember the story of David and Goliath when the young\r\nshepherd “prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone.”\r\n\r\nYet slings had their drawbacks. A stone slung might kill a bird or even\r\na man, but it was not very effective against big game.\r\n\r\nWhat was wanted was a missile to pierce a thick hide.\r\n\r\nMan had begun to make spears for use in a pinch, but would you like\r\nto tackle a husky bear or a well-horned stag with only a spear for a\r\nweapon?\r\n\r\nNo more did our undressed ancestors. The invention of the greatly\r\ndesired arm probably came about in a most curious way.\r\n\r\nLong ages ago man had learned to make fire by patiently rubbing two\r\nsticks together, or by twirling a round one between his hands with its\r\npoint resting upon a flat piece of wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “LONG BOW” IN SHERWOOD FOREST\r\n\r\nONE OF ROBIN HOOD’S FAMOUS BAND ENCOUNTERS A SAVAGE TUSKER AT CLOSE\r\nRANGE]\r\n\r\nIn this way it could be made to smoke, and finally set fire to a tuft\r\nof dried moss, from which he might get a flame for cooking. This was\r\nsuch hard work that he bethought him to twist a string of sinew about\r\nthe upright spindle and cause it to twirl by pulling alternately at\r\nthe two string ends, as some savage races still do. From this it was\r\na simple step to fasten the ends of the two strings to a bent piece\r\nof wood, another great advantage since now but one hand was needed to\r\ntwirl the spindle, and the other could hold it in place. This was the\r\n“bow-drill” which also is used to this day.\r\n\r\nBut bent wood is apt to be springy. Suppose that while one were\r\nbearing on pretty hard with a well-tightened string, in order to bring\r\nfire quickly, the point of the spindle should slip from its block.\r\nNaturally, it would fly away with some force if the position were just\r\nright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEER STALKING WITH THE CROSSBOW\r\n\r\nTHIS COMPACT ARM WITH ITS SMALL BOLT AND GREAT POWER WAS POPULAR WITH\r\nMANY SPORTSMEN]\r\n\r\nThere was one man who stopped short when he lost his spindle, for a\r\nred-hot idea shot suddenly through his brain.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice he chuckled to himself softly. Thereupon he arose and\r\nbegan to experiment. He chose a longer, springier piece of wood, bent\r\nit into a bow, and strung it with a longer thong. He placed the end of\r\na straight stick against the thong, drew it strongly back, and released\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe shaft whizzed away with force enough to delight him, and lo, there\r\nwas the first Bow-and-Arrow!\r\n\r\nArmed with his bow-and-arrow, man now was lord of creation. No longer\r\nwas it necessary for him to huddle with his fellows in some cave to\r\navoid being eaten by prowling beasts. Instead he went where he would\r\nand boldly hunted the fiercest of them. In other words, his brain was\r\nbeginning to tell, for though his body was still no match for the lion\r\nand the bear, he had thought out a way to conquer them.\r\n\r\nAlso he was better fed with a greater variety of game. And now, free\r\nto come and go wherever he might find it, he was able to spread into\r\nvarious lands and so to organize the tribes and nations which at last\r\ngave us civilization and history.\r\n\r\nA new weapon now came about through warfare. Man has been a savage\r\nfighting animal through pretty much all his history, but while he tried\r\nto kill the other fellow, he objected to being killed himself.\r\n\r\nTherefore he took to wearing armor. During the Middle Ages he piled on\r\nmore and more, until at last one of the knights could hardly walk, and\r\nit took a strong horse to carry him. When such a one fell, he went over\r\nwith a crash like a tin-peddler’s wagon, and had to be picked up again\r\nby some of his men. Such armor would turn most of the arrows. Hence\r\ninvention got at work again and produced the Crossbow and its bolt. We\r\nhave already learned how the tough skin of animals brought about the\r\nbow; now we see that man’s artificial iron skin caused the invention of\r\nthe crossbow.\r\n\r\nWhat was the Crossbow? It was the first real hand-shooting machine. It\r\nwas another big step toward the day of the rifle. The idea was simple\r\nenough. Wooden bows had already been made as strong as the strongest\r\nman could pull, and they wished for still stronger ones--steel ones.\r\nHow could they pull them? At first they mounted them upon a wooden\r\nframe and rested one end on the shoulder for a brace. Then they took to\r\npressing the other end against the ground, and using both hands. Next,\r\nit was a bright idea to put a stirrup on this end, in order to hold it\r\nwith the foot.\r\n\r\nStill they were not satisfied. “Stronger, stronger!” they clamored;\r\n“give us bows which will kill the enemy farther away than he can shoot\r\nat us! If we cannot set such bows with both arms let us try our backs!”\r\nSo they fastened “belt-claws” to their stout girdles and tugged the bow\r\nstrings into place with their back and leg muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho First Discovered the Power of Gunpowder?\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the Chinese, although all authorities do not agree. Strange,\r\nis it not, that a race still using crossbows in its army should have\r\nknown of explosives long before the Christian Era, and perhaps as far\r\nback as the time of Moses? Here is a passage from their ancient Gentoo\r\nCode of Laws: “The magistrate shall not make war with any deceitful\r\nmachine, or with poisoned weapons, or with cannons or guns, or any kind\r\nof firearms.” But China might as well have been Mars before the age of\r\ntravel. Our civilization had to work out the problem for itself.\r\n\r\nIt all began through playing with fire. It was desired to throw fire on\r\nan enemy’s buildings, or his ships, and so destroy them.\r\n\r\nBurning torches were thrown by machines, made of cords and springs,\r\nover a city wall, and it became a great study to find the best burning\r\ncompound with which to cover these torches. One was needed which would\r\nblaze with a great flame and was hard to put out.\r\n\r\nHence the early chemists made all possible mixtures of pitch, resin,\r\nnaphtha, sulphur, saltpeter, etc.; “Greek fire” was one of the most\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nMany of these were made in the monasteries. The monks were pretty much\r\nthe only people in those days with time for study, and two of these\r\nshaven-headed scientists now had a chance to enter history. Roger Bacon\r\nwas the first. One night he was working his diabolical mixture in the\r\nstone-walled laboratory, and watched, by the flickering lights, the\r\nprogress of a certain interesting combination for which he had used\r\npure instead of impure saltpeter.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was an explosion, shattering the chemical apparatus and\r\nprobably alarming the whole building. That explosion proved the new\r\ncombination was not fitted for use as a thrown fire; it also showed the\r\nexistence of terrible forces far beyond the power of all bow-springs,\r\neven those made of steel.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon thus discovered what was practically gunpowder, as far\r\nback as the thirteenth century, and left writings in which he\r\nrecorded mixing 11.2 parts of the saltpeter, 29.4 of charcoal, and\r\n29 of sulphur. This was the formula developed as the result of his\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nBerthold Schwartz, a monk of Freiburg, studied Bacon’s works and\r\ncarried on dangerous experiments of his own, so that he is ranked with\r\nBacon for the honor. He was also the first one to rouse the interest of\r\nEurope in the great discovery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “KENTUCKY RIFLE” WITH ITS FLINT-LOCK WAS ACCURATE\r\nBUT MUST BE MUZZLE-CHARGED]\r\n\r\n~THE FIRST REAL FIRE ARMS~\r\n\r\nAnd then began the first crude, clumsy efforts at gunmaking. Firearms\r\nwere born.\r\n\r\nHand bombards and culverins were among the early types. Some of these\r\nwere so heavy that a forked support had to be driven into the ground,\r\nand two men were needed, one to hold and aim, the other to prime and\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nImprovements kept coming, however. Guns were lightened and bettered in\r\nshape. Somebody thought of putting a flash pan, for the powder, by the\r\nside of the touch-hole, and now it was decided to fasten the slow-match\r\nin a movable cock upon the barrel, and ignite it with a trigger. These\r\nmatches were fuses of some slow-burning fiber, like tow, which would\r\nkeep a spark for a considerable time. Formerly they had to be carried\r\nseparately, but the new arrangement was a great convenience and made\r\nthe match-lock. The cock, being curved like a snake, was called the\r\n“serpentine.”\r\n\r\nAbout the time sportsmen were through wondering at the convenience\r\nof the match-lock, they began to realize its inconvenience. They\r\nfound that they burned up a great deal of fuse, and were hard to keep\r\nlighted. Both statements were true, so inventors racked their brains\r\nagain for something better. They all knew you could bring sparks with\r\nflint and steel, and that seemed an idea worth working on. A Nuremberg\r\ninventor, in 1515, hit on the wheel-lock. In this a notched steel\r\nwheel was wound up with a key like a clock. Flint or pyrite was held\r\nagainst the jagged edge of the wheel by the pressure of the serpentine.\r\nYou pulled the trigger, then “whirr,” the wheel revolved, a stream of\r\nsparks flew off into the flash-pan, and the gun was discharged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEEL-LOCK RIFLE]\r\n\r\nThis gun worked beautifully, but it was expensive. Wealthy sportsmen\r\ncould afford them, and so for the first time firearms began to be used\r\nfor hunting. Some of these sixteenth and seventeenth century nabobs had\r\nsuch guns of beautiful workmanship, so wrought and carved and inlaid,\r\nthat they must have cost a small fortune. You will find them in many\r\nlarge museums to this day.\r\n\r\nBut now the robbers had their turn. There are two stories of the\r\ninvention of the flint-lock. Both deal with robbers, both have good\r\nauthority, and both may be true, for inventions sometimes are made\r\nindependently in different places.\r\n\r\nOne story runs that the flint-lock which was often styled “Lock à la\r\nMiquelet,” from the Spanish word, “Miquelitos”--marauders--told its\r\norigin in its name. The other is, that the flint-lock was invented in\r\nHolland by gangs of thieves, whose principal business was to steal\r\npoultry.\r\n\r\nIn either case the explanation is easy. The match-lock showed its fire\r\nat night and wouldn’t do for thieves, the wheel-lock was too expensive,\r\nso again necessity became the mother of a far-reaching invention.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows what the flint-lock was like. You simply fastened a\r\nflake of flint in the cock and snapped it against a steel plate. This\r\nstruck off sparks which fell into the flash-pan and fired the charge.\r\n\r\nIt was so practical that it became the form of gun for all uses; thus\r\ngunmaking began to be a big industry. Invented early in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, it was used by the hunters and soldiers of the next two\r\nhundred years. Old people remember when flint-locks were plentiful\r\neverywhere. In fact, they are still being manufactured and are sold\r\nin some parts of Africa and the Orient. One factory in Birmingham,\r\nEngland, is said to produce about twelve hundred weekly, and Belgium\r\nshares in their manufacture. Some of the Arabs use them to this day in\r\nthe form of strange-looking guns with long, slender muzzles and very\r\nlight, curved stocks.\r\n\r\nThere were freak inventors in the flint-lock period just as there are\r\nto-day. Some of them wrestled with the problem of repeating guns,\r\nand put together a number of barrels, even seven in the case of one\r\ncarbine. Others tried revolving chambers, like our revolvers, and still\r\nothers, magazine stocks. Pistols came into use in many interesting\r\nshapes, but these were too practical to be considered freaks.\r\n\r\n~WHY WE CALL THEM PISTOLS~\r\n\r\nPistols, by the way, are named from the town of Pistola, Italy, where\r\nthey are said to have been invented and first used.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that rifling was invented about the time that the\r\nwheel-lock appeared, and had a great deal to do with the improvement\r\nof shooting. Austrians claim its invention for Casper Zollner, of\r\nVienna, who cut straight grooves in the barrel’s bore. His gun is said\r\nto have been used for the first time in 1498, but the Italians seem\r\nto have still better warrant as these significant words appear in old\r\nLatin Italian, under date of July 28th, 1476, in the inventory of the\r\nfortress of Guastalla: “Also one iron gun made with a twist like a\r\nsnail shell.” The rifling made the bullet spin like a top as it flew\r\nthrough the air, thus greatly improving its precision.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1807 the Rev. Alexander John Forsythe, LL.D., got his\r\npatent papers for something far better than even the steady old flint.\r\nHe had invented the percussion system. In some form this has been used\r\never since. Which is to say that when the hammer of your gun falls, it\r\ndoesn’t explode the powder, although it seems to. Instead it sets off a\r\ntiny portion of a very sensitive chemical compound called the “primer,”\r\nand the explosion of this “primer” makes the powder go off. Of course,\r\nthe two explosions come so swiftly that your ear hears only a single\r\nbang.\r\n\r\nPrimers were tried in different forms called “detonators,” but the\r\nfamiliar little copper cap was the most popular. No need to describe\r\nthem. Millions are still made to be used on old-fashioned nipple guns,\r\neven in this day of fixed ammunition.\r\n\r\nBut now we come to another great development, the Breech-loader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MODERN AUTOMATIC RIFLE\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN SPORTSMAN WITH HIS AUTOMATIC RIFLE IS PREPARED FOR ALL\r\nEMERGENCIES]\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have had to handle an old muzzle-loader. It was all right\r\nso long as you knew of nothing better, but think of it now that you\r\nhave your beautiful breech-loader. Do you remember how sometimes you\r\noverloaded, and the kick made your shoulder lame for a week? Or how,\r\nwhen you were excited you shot away your ramrod? The gun fouled too,\r\nand was hard to clean, the nipples broke off, the caps split, and the\r\nbreeches rusted so that you had to take them to a gunsmith. Yes, in\r\nspite of the game it got, it was a lot of trouble, now you come to\r\nthink of it. How different it all is now!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSEMBLING REPEATING SHOTGUNS AND RIFLES]\r\n\r\nBreech-loaders were hardly new. King Henry VIII of England, he of the\r\nmany wives, had a match-lock arquebus of this type dated 1537. Henry IV\r\nof France even invented one for his army, and others worked a little\r\non the idea from time to time. But it wasn’t until fixed ammunition\r\ncame into use that the breech-loader really came to stay--and that\r\nwas only the other day. You remember that the Civil War began with\r\nmuzzle-loaders and ended with breech-loaders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSEMBLING AUTO SHOTGUNS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME OF THE SHOOTING TESTS]\r\n\r\nHouiller, the French gunsmith, hit on the great idea of the cartridge.\r\nIf you were going to use powder, ball and percussion primer to get your\r\ngame, why not put them all into a neat, handy, gas-tight case?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST AMERICAN MADE GUNS\r\n\r\n~HOW THE FIRST AMERICAN GUN WAS MADE~\r\n\r\nTwo men, a smith and his son, both named Eliphalet Remington, in\r\n1816, were working busily one day at their forge in beautiful Ilion\r\nGorge, when, so tradition says, the son asked his father for money to\r\nbuy a rifle, and met with a refusal. The request was natural for the\r\nsurrounding hills were full of game. The father must have had his own\r\nreasons for refusing, but it started the manufacture of guns in America.\r\n\r\nEliphalet, Jr., closed his firm jaws tightly, and began collecting\r\nscrap iron on his own account. This he welded skillfully into a\r\ngun-barrel, walked fifteen miles to Utica to have it rifled, and\r\nfinally had a weapon of which he might well be proud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPES OF CARTRIDGES]\r\n\r\nIn reality, it was such a very good gun that soon the neighbors ordered\r\nothers like it, and before long the Remington forge found itself hard\r\nat work to meet the increasing demand. Several times each week the\r\nstalwart young manufacturer packed a load of gun-barrels upon his back,\r\nand tramped all the way to Utica where a gunsmith rifled and finished\r\nthem. At this time there were no real gun-factories in America,\r\nalthough gunsmiths were located in most of the larger towns. All\r\ngun-barrels were imported from England or Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO A CARTRIDGE FACTORY\r\n\r\n~HOW AMMUNITION IS MADE~\r\n\r\nOne of the first shocks you get when you start your visit through a\r\ncartridge factory is the matter-of-fact way in which the operatives,\r\ngirls in many cases, handle the most terrible compounds. We stop, for\r\nexample, where they are making primers to go in the head of your loaded\r\nshell, in order that it may not miss fire when the bunch of quail\r\nwhirrs suddenly into the air from the sheltering grasses. That grayish\r\npasty mass is wet fulminate of mercury. Suppose it should dry a trifle\r\ntoo rapidly. It would be the last thing you ever did suppose, for there\r\nis force enough in that double handful to blow its surroundings into\r\nfragments. You edge away a little, and no wonder, but the girl who\r\nhandles it shows no fear as she deftly but carefully presses it into\r\nmoulds which separate it into the proper sizes for primers. She knows\r\nthat in its present moist condition it cannot explode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSPECTING METALLIC SHELLS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXAMINING PAPER SHELLS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEIGHING BULLETS]\r\n\r\nOr, perhaps, we may be watching one of the many loading machines.\r\nThere is a certain suggestiveness in the way the machines are separated\r\nby partitions. The man in charge takes a small carrier of powder from a\r\ncase in the outside wall and shuts the door, then carefully empties it\r\ninto the reservoir of his machine, and watches alertly while it packs\r\nthe proper portions into the waiting shells. He looks like a careful\r\nman, and needs to be. You do not stand too close.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOOTING ROOM OF BALLISTICS DEPARTMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRONOGRAPH FOR MEASURING]\r\n\r\nThe empty carrier then passes through a little door at the side of the\r\nbuilding, and drops into the yawning mouth of an automatic tube. In the\r\ntwinkling of an eye it appears in front of the operator in one of the\r\ndistributing stations, where it is refilled, and returned to its proper\r\nloading machine, in order to keep the machine going at a perfectly\r\nuniform rate; while at the same time it allows but a minimum amount\r\nof powder to remain in the building at any moment. Each machine has\r\nbut just sufficient powder in its hopper to run until a new supply can\r\nreach it. Greater precaution than this cannot be imagined, illustrating\r\nas it does that no effort has been spared to protect the lives of the\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUTTING METAL HEADS ON PAPER SHOT SHELLS]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, in an output of something like four million per\r\nday, every cartridge is perfect.\r\n\r\nSuch things are not accidental. The secret is, inspection.\r\n\r\n~TESTING MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS~\r\n\r\nLet us see what that means. It means laboratory tests to start with.\r\nHere are brought many samples of the body paper, wad paper, metals,\r\nwaterproofing mixture, fulminate of mercury, sulphur, chlorate of\r\npotash, antimony sulphide, powder, wax, and other ingredients, and\r\neven the operating materials such as coal, grease, oil, and soaps.\r\nIn the laboratory we see expert chemists and metallurgists with\r\ntheir test-tubes, scales, Bunsen burners, retorts, tensile machines,\r\nmicroscopes, and other scientific looking apparatus, busily hunting\r\nfor defects.\r\n\r\nFor example, one marker is examining a supply of cupro-nickel, such as\r\nis used in jacketing certain bullets. A corner of each strip is first\r\nbent over at right angles, then back in the other direction until it\r\nis doubled, then straightened. It does not show the slightest sign of\r\nbreaking or cracking, in spite of the severe treatment, therefore it is\r\nperfect. Let but the least flaw appear, and the shipment is rejected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT A SHOT TOWER LOOKS LIKE\r\n\r\n  SHOT TOWER--TALLEST BUILDING IN CONNECTICUT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LARGEST CARTRIDGE EQUALS MORE\r\n  THAN 1,000,000 OF SMALLEST\r\n  (HELD ON HAND)]\r\n\r\nTwo large iron cylinders descend in the center, coming down through the\r\nceiling from above; we are invited to look through an open port in one\r\nof these.\r\n\r\nWe see nothing but the whitened opposite wall, against which a light\r\nburns.\r\n\r\nIt appears absolutely empty, though within it is raining such a swift\r\nshower of invisible metal that if we were to stretch our hands into the\r\napparently vacant space they would be torn from our arms.\r\n\r\nA large water tank below is churned into foam with the impact of the\r\nfalling shot, and as we look downward we make out finally the haze of\r\nmotion. It is so interesting that we take the elevator and rise ten\r\nstories to the source of the shower.\r\n\r\nHere high in the air are the large caldrons where many pigs of lead,\r\nwith the proper alloy, are melted into a sort of metallic soup. This\r\nis fed into small compartments containing sieves or screens, through\r\nthe meshes of which the shining drops appear and then plunge swiftly\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nBut this only begins the process. Taken from the water tanks and\r\nhoisted up again, the shot pellets, in a second journey down, through\r\ncomplicated devices, are sorted, tumbled, polished, graded, coated with\r\ngraphite, and finally stored.\r\n\r\n  The pictures shown in this story were prepared especially to\r\n  illustrate this story of “How Man Learned to Shoot” by the\r\n  Searchlight Library for the Remington Arms Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORGING A MONSTER GUN\r\n\r\n  Photo by Bethlehem Steel Co.\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows gun ingots after being “stripped” and “cored.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo by Bethlehem Steel Co.\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows a gun ingot in the process of being forged under\r\nforging press.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo by Bethlehem Steel Co.\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows a gun being fired at the Proving Grounds for\r\ntest.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Parts of a Big Gun\r\n\r\n\r\n~THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT A BIG GUN~\r\n\r\nBefore going into a description of the manufacture of a big gun it\r\nwould be well to understand the following definitions:\r\n\r\nThe “breech” of a gun is its rear-end, or that end into which the\r\nprojectile and powder charge are loaded.\r\n\r\nThe “muzzle” of a gun is its forward end.\r\n\r\nBy “calibre” is meant the inside diameter of the gun in inches. A\r\n5-inch gun is one of “minor calibre,” and one of 14-inches a gun of\r\n“major calibre.”\r\n\r\nThe length of a gun is never expressed in inches or feet, but in the\r\n_number of times_ that its calibre is divisible into its length; thus,\r\nwhen we say a 12-inch 50-calibre gun, we mean a gun of 12 inches in\r\ndiameter, and 12 times 50, or 600 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe “bore” is the hole extending through the center of the gun, from\r\nthe rear face of the liner to its forward end.\r\n\r\nThe “powder chamber” is the rear part of the bore, and extends from the\r\nface of the breech plug when closed to the point where the “rifling”\r\nbegins. The powder chamber is slightly larger in diameter than the rest\r\nof the bore.\r\n\r\nThe “rifling” is the name given to the spiral grooves which are cut\r\ninto the surface of the bore of the gun, and give to the projectile its\r\nrotary motion when the gun is fired.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of “iron-clads” and heavily armored fortresses, it\r\nbecame necessary to increase the power of the guns in use, until to-day\r\na 14-inch gun of 45 calibres fires a projectile weighing 1400 pounds,\r\nwith an initial velocity of 2600 feet per second. An idea of this\r\ninitial velocity may be better obtained by comparison when you realize\r\nthat a train going sixty miles an hour is only traveling at the rate\r\nof 88 feet per second. Now, in order to produce such wonderful power in\r\na gun, great pressure must be generated in the bore, and it was soon\r\nfound that a one-piece gun, whether cast or forged, could not withstand\r\nsuch pressures.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we may consider this one-piece gun, or any gun, as a\r\ntube which must withstand a great pressure from within, so that when\r\na gun is designed care must be taken to see that the material from\r\nwhich it is constructed is strong enough to withstand this pressure.\r\nAnd not only must the gun be sufficiently strong, but it must not\r\nbe too heavy, so that you see you cannot go on forever increasing\r\nthe thickness of the walls of this tube. Besides, it is generally\r\nacknowledged that a simple tube or cylinder cannot be made with walls\r\nof sufficient thickness to withstand from within a _continued_ pressure\r\nper square inch greater than the tenacity of a square-inch bar of the\r\nsame material; in other words, if the tensile strength of a metal is\r\nonly twelve tons per square inch, no gun of that metal, however thick\r\nits walls, could withstand a pressure of twenty tons per square inch,\r\nand the modern big guns are tested at that great a pressure. And if we\r\nlook further into this matter of pressures we find that when a gun is\r\nfired the pressure exerts itself in two ways; it tends to burst the gun\r\nlongitudinally or down the middle, and it tends to pull the gun apart\r\nin the direction of its length. Of course, some method of strengthening\r\nthis one-piece gun was sought after, with the result that to-day guns\r\nare either “_built-up_” or “_wire-wound_.”\r\n\r\nA “built-up” gun is one made of several layers, each layer being\r\nseparately constructed and then assembled together. The order of\r\nassemblage differs somewhat with the different calibres, but the method\r\nof assemblage is essentially the same, that is, the outside layers are\r\nheated and shrunk on the inner ones. This question will be treated at\r\ngreater length later on.\r\n\r\nA “wire-wound” gun is one in which the necessary additional strength\r\nis obtained by winding wire around an inner tube of steel, each layer\r\nbeing wound with a different tension of the wire; this type of gun\r\nhas found great favor with foreign manufacturers. In this country,\r\nhowever, the “built-up” system is used almost exclusively, and so this\r\ndescription will deal with the manufacture of a “built-up” gun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW A BIG GUN WOULD LOOK IF YOU WERE TO CUT IT IN TWO\r\n\r\nSketch Showing Construction of a Modern “Built-up” Gun.\r\n\r\n_A_, HOOP; _B_, HOOP; _C_, JACKET; _D_, TUBE; _E_, LINER; _F_, HOOP.]\r\n\r\nA modern “built-up” gun is composed of a _liner_, a _tube_, a _jacket_\r\nand _hoops_.\r\n\r\nThe _liner_ is in one piece and extends the entire length of the bore\r\nand carries the “rifling” and the powder chamber.\r\n\r\nThe _tube_ is in one piece and envelops the liner for its entire\r\nlength. Formerly the _tube_ carried the “rifling” and powder chamber,\r\nbut due to the wearing out of the “rifling” with constant firing, a\r\nliner was decided on, so that now when the “rifling” becomes worn, the\r\nliner can be removed and a new one substituted.\r\n\r\nThe _jacket_ is usually in two pieces and is shrunk on the tube; it\r\nextends the entire length, and its rear end is threaded in the inside\r\nfor the attachment of the “breech bushing.”\r\n\r\n_Hoops_ are shrunk on over the jacket and in a big gun are sometimes as\r\nmany as six or seven in number.\r\n\r\nThe liner, tube, jacket and hoops are made of the finest quality of\r\nopen hearth steel, and the steel must conform to specifications set by\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo by Bethlehem Steel Co.\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows a mould for a gun ingot under hydraulic press for\r\nfluid compression.]\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition having been determined, the necessary elements\r\nare weighed out and the whole charged into an open hearth furnace. When\r\nthe furnace is ready to be tapped the molten metal is run into a large\r\nladle, which in turn is taken by a crane to the casting pit, where the\r\nmould is filled. The ingots for the large calibre guns run from 42-inch\r\nto 48-inch in diameter, and after being poured they are immediately\r\nrun under a hydraulic press, where they are subjected to a pressure\r\nof about six tons per square inch to drive out the gases, and then\r\nlowered to about 1500 pounds pressure per square inch for a certain\r\nlength of time during the cooling. This pressure tends to make the\r\ningot solid, by expelling the gases, which would cause blow-holes, and\r\nby preventing “piping” and “segregation.” When a metal cools, the top\r\nand sides cool first, and this outer layer shrinks and pulls away from\r\nthe centre, with the result that a cavity or “pipe” would be formed,\r\nbut the hydraulic pressure forces fluid metal into this cavity and\r\nso prevents the “pipe.” The cooling also causes the various elements\r\nto solidify separately, and they tend to break away from the mass\r\nand collect at the centre; this is called “segregation,” and is also\r\npartially prevented by fluid compression. A solid ingot, however, is\r\nobtained, and this is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter the ingot has cooled sufficiently it is “_stripped_,” that is,\r\nit is removed from the mould, and then it is sent to the shop to have\r\nthe “discard,” or extra length, cut off. When the ingot is cast, an\r\nextra amount of metal is poured into the mould to permit this discard,\r\nthe theory being that the poorer metal, together with gases and other\r\nimpurities, rise to the top. The government specifications require that\r\nthere shall be a 20% discard from the upper end and a 3% discard from\r\nthe lower end. The discard having been cut off, the ingot is “cored,”\r\nthat is, its centre is bored out, the diameter of the hole depending on\r\nthe size of the ingot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKING THE BORE OF A BIG GUN\r\n\r\n  Photo by Bethlehem Steel Co.\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows gun ingot in boring mill being cored.]\r\n\r\nThe ingot is now ready for the “forge,” and on its receipt in the forge\r\nshop it is placed in a furnace to be heated; and here great care must\r\nbe exercised to prevent setting up any additional strains in the ingot.\r\nWhen the ingot was cooling just after casting the metal tended to flow\r\nfrom the centre; the interior is still in a condition of strain, and if\r\nthe cold ingot is now placed in a hot furnace, cracks are apt to form\r\nin the centre, causing the forging to later break in service.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ingot having been properly heated, it is ready for either\r\nthe forging hammer or the press. The present-day practice, though, is\r\nto forge the ingot under a press forge, as the working of the metal\r\ncauses a certain flow, and as a certain amount of time is necessary\r\nfor this flow, the continued pressure and slow motion of the press\r\nallows the molecules of the metal to adjust themselves more easily,\r\nand a better and more homogeneous forged ingot is produced than if the\r\nforging had been done with a hammer.\r\n\r\nWhen forging a hollow ingot, a mandrel, merely a cylindrical steel\r\nshaft, is placed through the hole in the ingot and the ingot forged\r\non the mandrel, thereby not only is the outside diameter of the ingot\r\ndecreased, but the length of the ingot is increased. The usual practice\r\nis to continue the forging until the original thickness of the walls\r\nof the ingot is decreased one-half and until the ingot is within two\r\ninches of the required finished diameters. The ingot is now known as a\r\n“forging,” and the lower end of each ingot as cast will be the breech\r\nend of the forging that is made from it.\r\n\r\nThe next process is that of “annealing.” This consists in heating the\r\nforging to a red heat and then allowing it to cool very slowly, and\r\nis usually done by hauling the fires in the furnace after the correct\r\ntemperature has been attained and permitting both to cool off together.\r\nThis process is to relieve the strains set up in the metal during\r\nforging, and further, it alters the molecular condition of the steel,\r\nmaking a finer and more homogeneous forging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE GUN TUBE IS TEMPERED\r\n\r\n  Photo by Bethlehem Steel Co.\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows a gun tube ready to be lowered into oil bath for\r\n“oil tempering.”]\r\n\r\nAfter annealing, the forging is ready to go to the machine shop to\r\nbe rough bored and turned. The forging is set in a lathe, the breech\r\nend being held by jaws on the face-plate and the muzzle end by a\r\n“pot-centre,” a large iron ring having several radial arms screwed\r\nthrough it. The lathe can now be turned and the forging centered by\r\nscrewing in or out on the jaws of the face-plate or the radial arms of\r\nthe “pot-centre.” When centered, several surfaces are turned on the\r\nforging for “steady rests” and then all is in readiness for the turning\r\nand boring.\r\n\r\nIn both operations of “turning” and “boring,” the work revolves while\r\nthe cutting tools are fed along. Turning is very simple and usually\r\nseveral tools are cutting at the same time, but boring is a more\r\ndelicate operation, because the workman cannot see what he is doing.\r\nAnd in boring, either a “hog bit” or a “packed bit” is used; a “hog\r\nbit” is a half cylinder of cast iron fitted with one cutting tool and\r\nused for rough cuts, while a “packed bit” is a full cylinder of wood\r\nwith metal framing and carrying two tools 180° apart and used for\r\nfinishing cuts.\r\n\r\nThe forging, having been rough machined, is now ready to receive its\r\nheat treatment in order to give to the steel its required physical\r\ncharacteristics. Every piece of steel used in gun manufacture must\r\nconform to certain specifications as regard both its physical and\r\nchemical characteristics. The chemical analysis was made at the time\r\nthe ingot was cast; now for the treatment of the forging, prior to the\r\nphysical test as to its tensile strength, elastic limit, elongation and\r\ncontraction.\r\n\r\nThe “tensile strength” of a metal is the unit-stress required to break\r\nthat metal into parts. If a round bar ten inches in cross-section area\r\nwill fracture under a strain of 120 tons, its tensile strength is 120 ÷\r\n10 or 12 tons per square inch. Tensile strength is usually expressed in\r\npounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nThe “elastic limit” of a metal is the unit-stress required to first\r\nproduce a permanent deformation of the metal. If a bar of metal be\r\nsubjected to an increasing strain, up to a certain point that metal\r\nwill be perfectly elastic, resuming its normal shape when the strain\r\nis removed; at the first permanent set or deformation, however,\r\nthe elastic limit of that metal has been reached. Elastic limit is\r\nexpressed in pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nBy “elongation” is meant the increase in length in a bar when its\r\ntensile strength is reached. If a bar 10 inches long after rupture\r\nmeasures 11.8 inches, its elongation is 18%.\r\n\r\nBy “contraction” is meant the decrease in cross-section area in a bar\r\nwhen its tensile strength is reached. If a bar 1 square inch in area\r\nafter rupture is only .75 of a square inch in area, its contraction is\r\n25%.\r\n\r\nThese definitions being understood, a brief description of the heat\r\ntreatment can be taken up, because it is after this treatment that\r\nstandard bars are taken from the forgings to undergo the physical\r\ntests. The first step consists in “tempering” or hardening the metal.\r\nThe piece to be tempered is placed in an upright position in a high\r\nfurnace and uniformly heated to the required temperature. It is then\r\nlifted from the furnace through an opening in the top and carried by a\r\ncrane to an oil tank of suitable depth and plunged into the oil. This\r\nrapid cooling or “tempering in oil” is facilitated by having the oil\r\ntank surrounded by a water bath, so arranged that a supply of cold\r\nwater is constantly in circulation to carry the heat from the mass\r\nas quickly as possible. This operation produces exceeding toughness,\r\nincreases the tensile strength and raises the elastic limit of the\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nNow the forging is again annealed, so as to relieve any strains set\r\nup by tempering and to soften up the metal to the degree required by\r\nthe specifications. It also increases materially the elongation and\r\ncontraction. Great care must be exercised in the heat treatment, as the\r\nacceptance or rejection of the forging depends upon whether or not the\r\ntest bars pass the required specifications.\r\n\r\nThe forging is now submitted for test and the test bars taken. In the\r\nmanufacture of a big gun, four test bars are taken from the breech\r\nend and four from the muzzle end of each forging and these bars\r\nsent to the physical laboratory. Quite an elaborate testing machine\r\nis provided, and if the bars pass the required tests the forging is\r\naccepted and is sent to the machine shop for finish-boring and turning.\r\n\r\n~SEARCHING FOR POSSIBLE DEFECTS~\r\n\r\nFrequently during finish-boring the work is examined to see that the\r\nbit is running true, and great care must be exercised to prevent its\r\nrunning out of alignment.\r\n\r\nAfter finish-boring every forging is “bore-searched,” that is, the bore\r\nis carefully examined for any cracks, flaws, streaks or discoloration.\r\nA special instrument called a “bore-searcher” is used and consists of\r\na long wooden handle which has a mirror inclined at 45° at one end,\r\ntogether with a light to illuminate the bore, and so shielded as to\r\nobscure the light from the observer. (See sketch.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe bore is also inspected by the foreman after each boring, but the\r\nfinal “bore-searching” is done by an inspector.\r\n\r\nNow to measure accurately the inside diameters of long cylinders,\r\nsuch as are used in gun work, a special measuring device called a\r\n“star-gauge” is used. Its name is derived from the fact that it has\r\nthree measuring points set at 120° apart and two measurements are\r\ntaken, one [Illustration] and the other [Illustration], making a star\r\n[Illustration]. Every forging is “star-gauged” after being finish-bored\r\nand also the liner of the _gun_ after each assemblage operation.\r\n\r\n~PUTTING THE PARTS OF A “BUILT-UP” GUN TOGETHER~\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the assembling of the different parts, the tube is\r\nthe forging to be finished. It is bored and turned to exact dimensions\r\nand carefully “bore-searched” and “star-gauged.” With the data at hand\r\na sketch is made showing the external diameters of the liner under the\r\ntube, due allowance being made for the shrinkage when assembling.\r\n\r\nThe liner is next bored to within .35 of an inch of the finished\r\ndiameter, and turned to the dimensions required by the sketch above.\r\nThis extra metal in the bore is left until the gun is completely\r\nassembled and is removed in the finish-boring. The liner is then\r\ncarefully “bore-searched” and “star-gauged” and liner and tube are\r\nready for assembling.\r\n\r\nThe liner is now taken to the shrinking pit and carefully aligned in an\r\nupright position with the breech end down.\r\n\r\nThe shrinking pit is merely a well of square section with room enough\r\nto permit workmen to move freely about the gun when it is in position,\r\nand equipped with a movable table at its bottom upon which the gun\r\nrests. In the meantime the tube, with breech end down, is being heated\r\nin a hot-air furnace. This furnace is a vertical cylinder built of\r\nfire-brick and asbestos and so constructed that air which has been\r\npassed in pipes over petroleum burners can enter at the bottom, pass\r\naround and through the tube and out through the top to be reheated.\r\nThis service permits a uniform heat to be transmitted to the tube and\r\nwhen the desired temperature has been attained the tube is lifted from\r\nthe furnace by a crane, carried to the shrinking pit and carefully\r\nlowered over the liner. Great care must be exercised in this operation\r\nto prevent the tube from sticking while being lowered into place.\r\nShould it happen, the tube should be hoisted off at once, allowed to\r\ncool, any roughing of the liner be smoothed off, the tube reheated and\r\na second trial made. When the tube is properly in place a cold spray\r\nmay be turned upon any particular section where it is desired the tube\r\nshould first grip the liner. The tube is then left to cool by itself,\r\nbut cold water is constantly circulating through the liner.\r\n\r\nWhen the gun is sufficiently cool for handling purposes, it is hoisted\r\nout of the shrinking pit and taken to the shop for careful measurement,\r\nthe liner being “star-gauged” to note the compression due to the\r\nshrinking on of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe same procedure is followed in the case of the jackets and hoops,\r\nuntil the entire gun is assembled. The gun is considered completely\r\n“built-up” when the last hoop has been shrunk on and is now ready to be\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nThe gun is now finish-bored, as .35 of an inch of metal was left in the\r\nliner in the first boring. “Packed bits” are used and the greatest care\r\nis exercised to keep the bit properly centered and running true. After\r\nthis step the gun is finish-turned and the powder chamber is bored.\r\n\r\nFollowing this operation the gun is “bore-searched” for any defects\r\nthat may have shown up in the finish-boring and chambering, and then\r\ncarefully “star-gauged.” The gun is then ready to be “rifled.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIFLING A BIG GUN\r\n\r\n  Photo by Bethlehem Steel Co.\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows a gun in the Rifling Machine in the process of\r\nbeing rifled.]\r\n\r\nThe “rifling” of a gun consists in cutting spiral grooves in the\r\nsurface of the bore from the powder chamber to the muzzle end, and is\r\ndone from the muzzle end. Rifling is a very difficult operation, and\r\ngreat care must be exercised that the cutting is uniform. The grooves\r\nare separated by raised portions called “lands,” and after “rifling,”\r\nthese grooves and “lands” are carefully smoothed up to remove the rough\r\nedges or burrs caused by the cutting tools of the “rifling” machine.\r\n\r\nThe necessary holes are now drilled for fitting the breech mechanism\r\nand the breech block fitted. This operation usually takes some little\r\ntime, as quite a bit of hand work is necessary to insure a perfect fit.\r\nThe “yoke,” really another “hoop,” is now put on at the breech end and\r\nthe gun is complete.\r\n\r\nThe centre of gravity of gun and breech mechanism is now determined\r\nby balancing on knife edges and the whole then weighed. The breech\r\nmechanism is also weighed and the two weights marked on the rear faces\r\nof the gun and breech mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe gun is now fitted in its “slide,” that part of the mount which\r\ncarries the trunnions and through which the gun recoils when it\r\nis fired, and after it is adjusted, all is in readiness for the\r\n“proof-firing” or testing of the gun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Motion?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are practically but two things we see when we use our eyes.\r\nOne of them is matter, which is a term we apply to the things we\r\nsee, speaking of them as objects only, and the other is motion which\r\nwe observe some of the matter to possess. Some of the things we see\r\nconfuse us, if we bear in mind that everything is either matter or\r\nmotion. For instance, we see light and know it is not matter and are\r\nconfused until we understand that light is a movement of the ether\r\nwhich surrounds us and is in and outside of everything. In the same way\r\nwe feel heat and may think it is matter thrown off by the fire, when it\r\nis only another kind of motion of this same ether. When we understand\r\nthese things we see that motion is a very important and real part of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nWhen a motion is started it will keep on going forever unless some\r\nother force which is able to overcome the motion stops it. When a ball\r\nis thrown in the air it would go on forever were it not for the law of\r\ngravitation which pulls it to the earth and the friction of the air on\r\nthe ball as it goes through the air. When you stop a thrown ball you\r\nsometimes realize that motion is a real thing because it stings your\r\nhands. We do wonderful things with motion. Many things when you add\r\nmotion to them acquire qualities which they did not possess before. For\r\ninstance, an ordinary icicle thrown against a wooden door will break,\r\nbut if you put it into a gun and give it sufficient motion, it will go\r\nright through the door. There is a story of how a man killed another\r\nby using an icicle as a bullet. The icicle entered the man’s body and\r\nkilled him. Then, of course, the ice melted and no one could tell how\r\nthe man received his wound, for no trace of anything like a bullet\r\ncould be found. A piece of paper has no cutting qualities, but if you\r\narrange a circular or square piece of paper with a rod or stick through\r\nthe center and revolve it fast enough, you can cut many things while it\r\nis whirling. The motion gives it the cutting qualities. You can take a\r\npiece of strong rope and, by tying the ends together, making a circle\r\nof it, you can make it roll down the street like a steel hoop if you\r\ncatch it just the right way and set it spinning fast enough before\r\nstarting it on its way. A steam engine has no power to pull the train\r\nof cars until the wheels are set in motion. So we see that motion is a\r\nvery important thing in the world.\r\n\r\nMotion is the cause of movements of all kinds, the power which takes\r\nthings from one place to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Perpetual Motion Possible?\r\n\r\n\r\nPerpetual motion will never be possible unless some one discovers a\r\nway to overcome the law of gravitation and also the certainty that\r\nmaterials will eventually wear out. Many men have tried to make a\r\nmachine that would keep on moving forever without the application of\r\nany power, the consumption of fuel within itself, the fall of weights\r\nor the unwinding of a spring; such a machine would be absolutely\r\nimpossible, although many people have been fooled into investing money\r\nin machines that appeared to have this power within themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Can an Explosion Break Windows That Are at a Distance?\r\n\r\n\r\nAn explosion is a sudden expansion of a substance like gunpowder or\r\nsome elastic fluid or other substance that has the power to explode\r\nunder certain conditions with force, and usually a loud report. Some\r\nexplosions are comparatively mild and accompanied by a very mild noise,\r\nwhile others are very powerful and accompanied by a very loud noise.\r\nWhen an explosion occurs, the air and everything surrounding the thing\r\nthat explodes is very much disturbed. The air surrounding the thing\r\nthat explodes is thrown back in air waves which are powerful in the\r\nexact proportion in which the explosion is powerful. These air waves\r\ncan be so suddenly thrown back against the objects in the vicinity that\r\nnot only the windows in the buildings are broken, but often the entire\r\nbuilding blown away. The explosion acts in all directions at once\r\nwith equal force. A great hole may be torn in the earth beneath the\r\nexplosion. If there is anything over the explosion, that is blown away\r\nunless its power of resistance is sufficient to withstand the power of\r\nthe explosion. Then, also, the air surrounding on all sides is forced\r\nback against everything in its path.\r\n\r\nVery often this air which is suddenly forced back by the power of the\r\nexplosion is thrown against houses at a distance. These houses may\r\nbe so strongly built as to be able to withstand the effect of the\r\nexplosion, but still certain parts of them, such as the windows and\r\nthe bricks of the chimney, may not be able to withstand this sudden\r\npressure of air against them and they are forced in. The wind from such\r\nan explosion acts on the outside of the windows just the same as though\r\nyou stood on the outside with your hands against the windows and pushed\r\nthem in. Anything that is thrown against a window with more force than\r\nthe window glass can resist will break the window, and even slight\r\nexplosions may be so powerful as to throw the air back and away from\r\nthem with such force as to break windows at a great distance--even a\r\nmile or more away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Some Things Bend and Others Break?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an outside force is applied to some objects, some of them will\r\nbend and others break. It is due to the fact that in some things the\r\nparticles have the faculty of sticking together or hanging on to each\r\nother, and it is very difficult to break them away from each other. In\r\nsuch instances, as in the case of a wire, the article will bend when\r\nwe apply the power to it and it will not break, because the particles\r\nwhich make up the wire have the faculty of hanging on to each other. A\r\npiece of glass, however, can be broken right in two by the application\r\nof no more force than was used to bend the wire, because the particles\r\nwhich make up the glass haven’t the faculty to hang on to each other.\r\nIf you continue to bend a wire back and forth, however, at the same\r\npoint, it will finally break apart, because you eventually overcome the\r\nability of the particles in the wire to hang on to each other.\r\n\r\nIt all depends upon the hanging-on ability. Sometimes in undergoing\r\ndifferent processes an article which will ordinarily only bend will\r\nbecome very brittle or breakable. A steel wire may bend but if you make\r\na steel wire very hard it becomes brittle. On the other hand, glass is\r\nvery brittle ordinarily, but if you make it very hot, you can bend it\r\ninto any shape you wish, and thus the glass-worker makes different\r\nshapes to various dishes; lamp chimneys, bottles, etc., by heating\r\nglass and then bending it. When it becomes cool again, it also becomes\r\nbrittle or breakable as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Ball Bounce?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you throw a ball against the floor in order to make it bounce the\r\nball gets out of shape as soon as it comes in contact with the floor.\r\nAs much of it as strikes the floor becomes perfectly flat, and because\r\nthe ball has a quality known as elasticity, which means the ability to\r\nreturn to its proper shape, it returns to its shape immediately and in\r\ndoing so forces itself back into the air and that is the bounce.\r\n\r\nOf course, the first thing we think of when we consider something\r\nthat bounces is a ball, and in most cases a rubber ball. We are more\r\nfamiliar with the bouncing qualities of a rubber ball. Other balls,\r\nlike standard baseballs, are not so elastic as a rubber ball filled\r\nwith air, but a solid-rubber ball is more elastic and some golf balls\r\nare much more elastic than a solid-rubber ball. The principle is the\r\nsame, when you drive a golf ball, excepting that when you bounce a ball\r\non the floor the floor does the flattening and when you drive a golf\r\nball, the golf club does the flattening. A baseball flies away from the\r\nbat for the same reason. When you meet a fast-pitched ball squarely on\r\nthe nose with a good swing, it goes farther and faster than when you\r\nhit a slow-pitched ball with an equal swing, because in the case of the\r\nfast-pitched ball you flatten the ball out more, and it has so much\r\nmore to do to recover its proper shape that it bounces away from the\r\nbat at much greater speed and goes much further unless caught than a\r\nslow-pitched ball under the same circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes a Ball Stop Bouncing?\r\n\r\n\r\nA bouncing ball, when you first throw it against the wall bounces back\r\nat you about as fast as you throw it, but if you do not catch it on the\r\nrebound, it goes to the floor again, because the law of gravitation\r\nwhich is the pulling power of the earth, pulls it down again. When it\r\nstrikes the floor it is again flattened to a certain extent and bounces\r\nup again, but does not come back so high. It goes on striking the floor\r\nand bouncing back into the air again each time a shorter distance,\r\nuntil the force of gravity has actually overcome its tendency to bounce\r\nback.\r\n\r\nWhen you bounce a ball on the floor and it bounces up again, the motion\r\nof the ball through the air is affected by the friction that the\r\ncontact with the air produces and this friction of the air overcomes\r\npart of the bouncing ability in the ball also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes a Cold Glass Crack if We Put Hot Water Into It?\r\n\r\n\r\nHot water will not always cause a cold glass to crack, but is very apt\r\nto, especially a thick glass. The very thin glasses will not crack. The\r\ntest tubes used by chemists are made of very thin glass, and will not\r\ncrack when hot liquids are poured into them.\r\n\r\nWhen a glass cracks after you have poured a hot liquid into it, it does\r\nso because, as soon as the hot liquid is put in, the particles of glass\r\nwhich form the inside of the glass become heated and expand. They begin\r\nto do this before the particles which form the outside of the glass\r\nbecome heated, and in their efforts to expand the inside particles of\r\nglass literally break away from the particles which form the outside,\r\ncausing the crack. The same thing happens if you put cold water into a\r\nhot glass, excepting in this instance the inside particles of the glass\r\ncontract before the particles which form the outside of the glass have\r\nhad time to become cool and do likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes the Gurgle When I Pour Water from a Bottle?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air trying to get in causes the gurgle. Air has one strong\r\ncharacteristic which stands out above everything else. It wants to go\r\nsome place else all the time. When it learns of a place where there\r\nis no air it wants to go there above all things, and goes at it with a\r\nrush.\r\n\r\nNow, when you turn a bottle full of water upside down, the water comes\r\nout if the cork is out, of course, and as soon as the water starts out\r\nthe air strives to get in, and every time you hear a gurgle you know\r\nthe air is getting in. Every gurgle is a battle between the water and\r\nthe air. Sometimes the air comes and pushes the water back enough to\r\nlet it slide into the bottle; sometimes the water pushes the air back,\r\nand thus they fight back and forth. The water always gets out and the\r\nair always gets in. In doing so they make the gurgle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does the Part of a Stocking Go That Was Where the Hole Comes?\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a foolish question, but many boys and girls have been\r\npuzzled for an answer to it. When you put your stockings on they have\r\nno holes in the feet, and at night, when you take them off, there are\r\noften quite large holes in them. The answer is the same as in the case\r\nof the lead in the lead-pencil. The lead in the pencil wears away. You\r\ncan see it wear away because that is what makes the marks.\r\n\r\nWhen a hole is coming into your stocking, the stocking on your foot\r\nis being rubbed between your foot and something else (probably some\r\npart of your shoe) and this constant rubbing will wear through the\r\nyarns with which the stocking is knitted. Of course, the yarns in\r\nthe stocking are stretched somewhat when it is on your foot and the\r\nrubbing finally cuts through the threads and releases the tension of\r\nthe threads of yarn, so that not always is as much stocking lost as\r\nthe size of the hole. But, if you were to look carefully at your foot\r\nand inside your shoe, when you first take the stocking off and see the\r\nhole, you would find little particles of yarn all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Coats Have Buttons On the Sleeves?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of putting buttons on coat sleeves, which serve no useful\r\npurpose at all and do not add to the beauty of the coat, is a relic of\r\nvery old days.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when people did not use handkerchiefs, and it was\r\ncommon practice for men to wipe their noses on their sleeves. They had\r\ncoats also in those days, but they did not have buttons on the sleeves.\r\nOne of the old kings finally developed the idea of dressing his\r\nsoldiers in fancy uniforms and, as he sat in his palace and reviewed\r\nhis troops, he noticed many of them using the sleeves of their coats as\r\nhandkerchiefs. He immediately issued a decree that all sleeves should\r\nhave a row of buttons sewed on them, but at a point directly opposite\r\nto where they are now on the sleeves. This was done to remind the\r\nsoldiers that the sleeves of their beautiful uniforms were not to be\r\nused as handkerchiefs, and those who attempted to draw their sleeves in\r\nfront of the nose were quickly reminded of the decree by the buttons\r\nwhich scratched them. And so the buttons really had a quite useful\r\npurpose at one time, and so also all sleeves had buttons sewed on to\r\nthem at this place. Later on, however, when the unsightly practice had\r\nbeen cured and people had learned to use handkerchiefs, the buttons\r\nremained as a decoration, but their former purpose was lost sight of.\r\nThen some tailor or leader of fashion had the buttons set on the under\r\nside of the sleeves for a change, and it became the fashion to have\r\nthem there, and the tailors have been sewing them there ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Has a Long Coat Buttons on the Back?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe buttons on the back of a long coat, i. e., one with skirts, had a\r\nmore sensible reason originally. At one time the skirts of such coats\r\nwere made very long, and when the wearer moved quickly the tails of\r\nthe coat flapped about the legs and interfered with progress. So an\r\ningenious gentleman had buttons sewed on to the back and buttonholes\r\nmade in the corner of his coat-tails. Then when he was in a hurry he\r\nsimply buttoned up his skirts and went his way comfortably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TELEPHONE DISPLAY BOARD\r\n\r\nShowing in outline the apparatus necessary to complete the simplest\r\nkind of a telephone call--to a number in the same exchange]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in the Telephone\r\n\r\n\r\n~WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TELEPHONE~\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith, at “Subscriber’s Station No. 1,” desires to telephone\r\nto Mrs. Jones at “Subscriber’s Station No. 2.” When she lifts her\r\nreceiver, the movement causes a tiny white light to appear instantly on\r\nthe switchboard at the Central Office. Directly beneath this light is\r\nanother and larger lamp, which glows in a way to attract the operator’s\r\nattention immediately.\r\n\r\nThe operator inserts a “plug” in a little hole on the switchboard\r\ncalled a “jack,” directly above the tiny light which appeared when Mrs.\r\nSmith lifted the receiver. This connects her to Mrs. Smith’s line. Then\r\nshe pushes a listening key on the board, connecting her telephone set\r\nto the line. “Number, please?” she calls.\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith gives the number; the operator repeats it to be sure there\r\nis no mistake, places another “plug” in a “jack” corresponding to the\r\nnumber of Mrs. Jones’ telephone and makes the connection.\r\n\r\nEach subscriber’s telephone has a particular signal on the switchboard\r\nto which it is connected by a pair of wires. Mrs. Smith’s wires run\r\nfrom her instrument to the nearest “cable terminal,” a gathering point\r\nfor the wires of various telephones in her neighborhood. Here they form\r\npart of a group of wires going to the Central Office. These groups,\r\ncalled cables, are made up of from 50 to 600 pairs of wires, according\r\nto the telephone needs of the district the “terminal” serves.\r\n\r\nWhen the wires reach the Central Office they pass through the “cable\r\nvault” to the “main distributing frame,” which is the Central Office\r\nterminal of the cable.\r\n\r\nWhen the wires come to this frame they are in numbered order in the\r\ncable. Subscribers living next door to Mrs. Smith may have entirely\r\ndifferent call numbers and yet use consecutive wires. It is the task\r\nof the main frame to redistribute these wires, so that they will be\r\narranged according to their call numbers and to make it possible to\r\nconnect Mrs. Smith’s line with the line of any other subscriber with\r\nthe least possible delay. This frame has two parts: the “vertical\r\nside” and the “horizontal side.” Before the wires are redistributed\r\nthey are taken to pairs of springs equipped with devices for protecting\r\nthe lines against outside currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASKING FOR A NUMBER]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the main frame they are taken to the “intermediate\r\ndistributing frame,” the central connecting point for various branches\r\nof the lines going to the switchboard, signaling and other apparatus.\r\nFrom the “horizontal side” of this frame, wires go to the switchboard,\r\nwhere they terminate in little holes known as “multiple jacks.” They\r\nalso connect with the line and position message registers, where the\r\ncalls from each Line and the calls handled at each operator’s position\r\nat the switchboard are recorded. The “multiple jacks” are additional\r\nterminals placed at necessary intervals throughout the switchboard,\r\nwhere they can be used by operators to make connections with any other\r\nline on the board.\r\n\r\nFrom the “vertical side” of the intermediate frame Mrs. Smith’s wires\r\nreach the “line and cut-off relay,” an electrically controlled switch\r\nwhich turns on the light signal that appears on the switchboard\r\nwhen she lifts the receiver from the hook. This “line relay” also\r\nextinguishes the light when the operator makes the connection, or when\r\nMrs. Smith returns the receiver to the hook.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TYPICAL POLE LINE, WITH CROSS ARMS, IN THE COUNTRY]\r\n\r\nThe swift moving electric current that was set in motion when Mrs.\r\nSmith began the call, instantaneously passes through all these devices\r\nfor safeguarding and protecting the subscriber’s telephone service. The\r\nlight announcing Mrs. Smith’s desire to make a call is called the “line\r\nlamp,” and is flashing on the switchboard. Directly beneath it is the\r\n“pilot lamp,” which glows whenever any “line lamp” lights. With the\r\n“line lamp” is a “jack” or terminal, where connection can be made with\r\nMrs. Smith’s line. This is the “answering jack.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CABLE VAULT INTO WHICH THE CABLES PASS WHEN THEY\r\nENTER THE EXCHANGE AND FROM WHICH THEY ARE LED UPWARD TO THE MAIN\r\nDISTRIBUTING FRAME]\r\n\r\nWhen the operator sees the flashing signal of Mrs. Smith’s “line lamp,”\r\nshe inserts one end of a pair of “connecting cords,” which are on\r\nthe board before her, in the “answering jack” for Mrs. Smith’s line.\r\nThese “connecting cords” are flexible conductors that put the wires\r\nof subscribers in electrical connection. Then she pushes forward the\r\n“operator’s key” directly in front of her and is connected with Mrs.\r\nSmith’s line.\r\n\r\nThe operator ascertains the number wanted and places the other\r\n“connecting cord” in the “jack” corresponding to Mrs. Jones’ line. If\r\nshe finds she cannot herself connect with Mrs. Jones’ “jack,” because\r\nit is on another part of the board out of her reach, she makes a\r\nconnection with another operator who can reach Mrs. Jones’ line. The\r\nsecond operator then makes the connection with Mrs. Jones’ “multiple\r\njack” and places her line in connection with Mrs. Smith’s line at the\r\nfirst operator’s position. At the same time the first operator pushes\r\nthe operator’s key back, thus ringing Mrs. Jones’ bell.\r\n\r\n“Supervisory lamps” on the board before her, connected with the\r\n“connecting cords,” tell the operator when Mrs. Jones answers the\r\nsummons. They flash when the connection is made and one goes out just\r\nas soon as Mrs. Jones takes the receiver from the hook to answer.\r\nIf one of these lamps flashes and dies out alternately it tells the\r\noperator that either Mrs. Smith or Mrs. Jones is trying to attract her\r\nattention and she connects herself and ascertains the party’s wishes.\r\nWhen both subscribers “hang up,” both lights flash to indicate the\r\nend of the conversation. The operator then disconnects the cords from\r\nthe subscribers’ “jacks” and presses the “message register” button\r\nrecording the call against Mrs. Smith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUTINE OF A TELEPHONE CALL\r\n\r\nThe subscriber, after looking up in the directory the desired number,\r\ntakes the telephone off the hook, which causes a tiny electric light to\r\nglow in front of the operator assigned to answer his calls.

WATSON IN 1874]\r\n\r\nThe story of Professor Alexander Graham Bell’s wonderful invention is\r\nfull of romantic interest and the early days of its exploitation were\r\nreplete with dramatic incidents.\r\n\r\n~THE MEN WHO MADE THE TELEPHONE~\r\n\r\nYoung Bell had come to America in 1870 in search of health, the family\r\nsettling at Brantford, Canada. He numbered among his forebears many\r\ndistinguished professional men. For three generations the Bells had\r\ntaught the laws of speech in the universities of Edinburgh, Dublin and\r\nLondon. He himself was an accomplished elocutionist and an expert in\r\nvocal physiology.\r\n\r\nDuring the year spent in Canada in regaining his health, Bell taught\r\nhis father’s method of visible speech to a tribe of Mohawk Indians and\r\nbegan to think about the “harmonic telegraph.”\r\n\r\nIn 1871 young Alexander Bell accepted an offer from the Boston Board\r\nof Education to teach the “visible speech” method in a school for deaf\r\nmutes in that city.\r\n\r\nFor two years he devoted himself to the work with great success. He was\r\nappointed a professor in the Boston University and opened a school of\r\n“Vocal Physiology” which was at once successful.\r\n\r\nHe might have continued his career as a teacher had it not been that\r\nhis active brain still clung to the “harmonic telegraph” idea and his\r\ninventive genius demanded an outlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROF. BELL’S VIBRATING REED]\r\n\r\nSo we find him in 1874 working out his idea of the “harmonic\r\ntelegraph,” the perfection of which meant a fortune to the young\r\ninventor. That he never realized his goal was due to the fact that\r\nwhile experimenting, he made a discovery which led to a far greater\r\ninvention and one that was fraught with more benefit to mankind than\r\nthe “harmonic telegraph” could ever have been.\r\n\r\nIt was while working with his faithful man Friday, Thomas A. Watson,\r\nin the dingy little workrooms on Court Street, Boston, that Bell got\r\nthe inspiration which made him turn from the “harmonic telegraph” to\r\ndevote himself to the invention which was destined to make his name\r\nfamous--the speaking telephone.\r\n\r\n~THE FIRST SOUND OVER A WIRE~\r\n\r\nMr. Watson has dramatically described the incident as follows:\r\n\r\n“On the afternoon of June 2, 1875, we were hard at work on the same\r\nold job, testing some modification of the instruments. Things were\r\nbadly out of tune that afternoon in that hot garret, not only the\r\ninstruments, but, I fancy, my enthusiasm and my temper, though Bell\r\nwas as energetic as ever. I had charge of the transmitters, as usual,\r\nsetting them squealing one after the other, while Bell was retuning\r\nthe receiver springs one by one, pressing them against his ear as I\r\nhave described. One of the transmitter springs I was attending to\r\nstopped vibrating and I plucked it to start it again. It didn’t start\r\nand I kept on plucking it, when suddenly I heard a shout from Bell in\r\nthe next room, and then out he came with a rush, demanding, ‘What did\r\nyou do then? Don’t change anything. Let me see!’ I showed him. It was\r\nvery simple. The make-and-break points of the transmitter spring I was\r\ntrying to start had become welded together, so that when I snapped the\r\nspring the circuit had remained unbroken while that strip of magnetized\r\nsteel by its vibration over the pole of its magnet, was generating that\r\nmarvelous conception of Bell’s--a current of electricity that varied in\r\nintensity precisely as the air was varying in density within hearing\r\ndistance of that spring. That undulatory current had passed through\r\nthe connecting wire to the distant receiver which, fortunately, was\r\na mechanism that could transform that current back into an extremely\r\nfaint echo of the sound of the vibrating spring that had generated it,\r\nbut what was still more fortunate, the right man had that mechanism\r\nat his ear during that fleeting moment, and instantly recognized\r\nthe transcendent importance of that faint sound thus electrically\r\ntransmitted. The shout I heard and his excited rush into my room were\r\nthe result of that recognition. The speaking telephone was born at\r\nthat moment. Bell knew perfectly well that the mechanism that could\r\ntransmit all the complex vibrations of one sound could do the same for\r\nany sound, even that of speech. That experiment showed him that the\r\ncomplex apparatus he had thought would be needed to accomplish that\r\nlong-dreamed result was not at all necessary, for here was an extremely\r\nsimple mechanism operating in a perfectly obvious way, that could do\r\nit perfectly. All the experimenting that followed that discovery, up\r\nto the time the telephone was put into practical use, was largely a\r\nmatter of working out the details. We spent a few hours verifying the\r\ndiscovery, repeating it with all the differently tuned springs we had,\r\nand before we parted that night Bell gave me directions for making the\r\nfirst electric speaking telephone. I was to mount a small drumhead\r\nof gold-beater’s skin over one of the receivers, join the center of\r\nthe drumhead to the free end of the receiving spring and arrange a\r\nmouthpiece over the drumhead to talk into. His idea was to force the\r\nsteel spring to follow the vocal vibrations and generate a current of\r\nelectricity that would vary in intensity as the air varies in density\r\nduring the utterance of speech sounds. I followed these directions and\r\nhad the instrument ready for its trial the very next day. I rushed it,\r\nfor Bell’s excitement and enthusiasm over the discovery had aroused\r\nmine again, which had been sadly dampened during those last few weeks\r\nby the meagre results of the harmonic experiments. I made every part of\r\nthat first telephone myself, but I didn’t realize while I was working\r\non it what a tremendously important piece of work I was doing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT THE FIRST TELEPHONE LOOKED LIKE\r\n\r\nALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL’S FIRST TELEPHONE]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Telephone Line.\r\n\r\n“The two rooms in the attic were too near together for the test, as\r\nour voices would be heard through the air, so I ran a wire especially\r\nfor the trial from one of the rooms in the attic down two flights to\r\nthe third floor where Williams’ main shop was, ending it near my work\r\nbench at the back of the building. That was the first telephone line.\r\nYou can well imagine that both our hearts were beating above the normal\r\nrate while we were getting ready for the trial of the new instrument\r\nthat evening. I got more satisfaction from the experiment than Mr. Bell\r\ndid, for shout my best I could not make him hear me, but I could hear\r\nhis voice and almost catch the words. I rushed upstairs and told him\r\nwhat I had heard. It was enough to show him that he was on the right\r\ntrack, and before he left that night he gave me directions for several\r\nimprovements in the telephones I was to have ready for the next trial.”\r\n\r\nThen followed many heart-breaking months of experimenting and it was\r\nnot until the following March that the telephone was able to transmit\r\na complete, intelligible sentence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TELEPHONE APPARATUS PATENTED IN 1876 BY PROF. BELL,\r\nPHOTOGRAPHED FROM THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE PATENT OFFICE AT\r\nWASHINGTON]\r\n\r\nOn February 14, 1876, Professor Bell filed at Washington his\r\napplication for patents covering the telephone which he described as\r\n“an improvement in telegraphy” and on March 3, of the same year, the\r\npatent was allowed.\r\n\r\nThat was the year of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia and\r\nProfessor Bell had a working model of the telephone on exhibition.\r\nTucked away in an obscure corner it had attracted but little attention,\r\nuntil on June 25th an incident occurred which had a tremendous effect\r\nin giving to the new invention just the sort of publicity it needed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bell himself describes the incident in the following\r\ninteresting manner:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Saunders, who were financially interested in the\r\ntelephone, wanted this instrument to be exhibited at the Centennial\r\nExhibition. In those days--and I must say even up to the present time\r\nI am afraid to say it is true--I was not very much alive to commercial\r\nmatters, not being a business man myself. I had a school for vocal\r\nphysiology in Boston. I was right in the midst of examinations.\r\n\r\n“I went down to Philadelphia, growling all the time at this\r\ninterruption to my professional work, and I appeared in Philadelphia\r\non Sunday, the 25th. I was an unknown man and looked around upon the\r\ncelebrities who were judges there, and trotted around after the judges\r\nat the exhibition while they examined this exhibit and that exhibit. My\r\nexhibit came last. Before they got to that it was announced that the\r\njudges were too tired to make any further examinations that day and\r\nthat the exhibit could be examined another day. That meant that the\r\ntelephone would not be seen, for I was not going to come back another\r\nday. I was going right back to Boston.\r\n\r\n~HOW AN EMPEROR SAVED THE TELEPHONE~\r\n\r\n“And that was the way the matter stood--when suddenly there was one man\r\namong the judges who happened to remember me by sight. That was no less\r\na person than His Majesty Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil. I had shown\r\nhim what we had been doing in teaching speech to the deaf in Boston,\r\nhad taken him around to the City School for the Deaf and shown him the\r\nmeans of teaching speech, and when he saw me there he remembered me\r\nand came over and shook hands and said: ‘Mr. Bell, how are the deaf\r\nmutes of Boston?’ I said they were very well and told him that the next\r\nexhibit on the program was my exhibit. ‘Come along,’ he said, and he\r\ntook my arm and walked off with me--and, of course, where an Emperor\r\nled the way the other judges followed. And the telephone exhibit was\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST TELEPHONE SWITCHBOARD USED. EIGHT SUBSCRIBERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Emperor Wonders.\r\n\r\n“Well, I cannot tell very much about that exhibit, although it was\r\nthe pivotal point on which the whole telephone turned in those days.\r\nIf I had not had that exhibition there it is very doubtful what the\r\ncondition of the telephone would be today. But the Emperor of Brazil\r\nwas the first one to bring that situation about at that time. I went\r\noff to my transmitting instrument in another part of the building, and\r\na little iron box receiver was placed at the ear of the Emperor. I told\r\nhim to hold it to his ear, and then I heard afterward what happened. I\r\nwas not present at that end of the line. I went to the other end and\r\nwas reciting, ‘To be or not to be, that is the question,’ and so on,\r\nkeeping up a continuous talk.”\r\n\r\n“I heard afterward from my friend, Mr. William Hubbard, that the\r\nEmperor held it up in a very indifferent way to his ear, and then\r\nsuddenly started and said, ‘My God! it speaks!’ And he put it down; and\r\nthen Sir William Thomson took it up and one after another in the crowd\r\ntook it up and listened. I was in another part of the building shouting\r\naway to the membrane telephone that was the transmitter. Suddenly I\r\nheard a noise of people stamping along very heavily, approaching, and\r\nthere was Dom Pedro, rushing along at a very un-Emperor-like gait,\r\nfollowed by Sir William Thomson and a number of others, to see what I\r\nwas doing at the other end. They were very much interested. But I had\r\nto go back to Boston and couldn’t wait any longer. I went that very\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“Now, it so happened there, that, although the judges had heard speech\r\nemitted by the steel disc armature of this receiving instrument, they\r\nwere not quite convinced that it was electrically produced. Some one\r\nhad whispered a suspicion that it was simply the case of the thread\r\ntelegraph, the lovers’ telegraph, as it was known in those days, and\r\nthat the sound had been mechanically transmitted along the line from\r\none instrument to the other. Of course, I did not know about it at that\r\ntime; but when the judges asked permission to remove the apparatus\r\nfrom that location I said, ‘Certainly, do anything you like with it.’\r\nBut I could not remain to look after it; they had to look after it\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\n“My friend, Mr. William Hubbard, who had kindly come up from Boston\r\nto help me on this celebrated Sunday, June 25, said he would do his\r\nbest to help them out, although he was not an electrician. He knew\r\nnothing whatever about the apparatus, beyond being in my laboratory\r\noccasionally, knowing me well. But he undertook to remove this\r\napparatus and set up the line under the direction of the judges\r\nthemselves. So they had an opportunity finally of satisfying themselves\r\nthat speech had really been electrically reproduced.”\r\n\r\n“Sir William Thomson’s announcement was made to the world in England,\r\nbefore the British Association, and the world believed--and from that\r\ntime dates the popular interest in the telephone.”\r\n\r\nIn October, 1876, the first outdoor demonstration, in which\r\nconversation was carried on over a private telegraph wire, borrowed for\r\nthe occasion, took place between Boston and Cambridge, a distance of\r\ntwo miles.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1877, the first telephone line was installed between Boston\r\nand Somerville.\r\n\r\nA month later an enterprising Boston man put up a crude switchboard\r\nin his office and connected up five banks, using the system for\r\ntelephoning in the day-time and as a protection against burglars at\r\nnight. This was the beginning of the exchange system, all previous\r\ntelephoning having been between two parties on the same circuit.\r\n\r\n~NINE MILLION TELEPHONES IN U. S.~\r\n\r\nSoon after exchanges sprang up in several cities, and by August of that\r\nyear there were 778 Bell telephones in use. From this modest beginning\r\nthe telephone has grown until on January 1, 1914, there were 13,500,000\r\ntelephones in the world, nearly 9,000,000, or over 64 per cent being in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN DISTRIBUTING FRAME\r\n\r\nWhen the wires come to this frame they are in numbered order in the\r\ncable. The main frame redistributes these wires so that they are\r\narranged according to their call numbers, making it possible to connect\r\nany wire with any other wire anywhere that telephone service is\r\ninstalled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE WIRES ARE PUT UNDERGROUND\r\n\r\nBreaking Up the Asphalt Pavement.

Enough to string around Lake Erie--8,000,000,\r\nwhich, with equipment, cost at the factory $45,000,000.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIRE.

Enough to build a stockade around\r\nCalifornia--12,480,000 of them, worth in the lumber yard about\r\n$40,000,000.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWITCHBOARDS. In a line would extend thirty-six\r\nmiles--55,000 of them, which cost, unassembled, $90,000,000.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUILDINGS. Sufficient to house a city of 150,000--more\r\nthan a thousand buildings, which, unfurnished, and without land, cost\r\n$44,000,000.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEOPLE. Equal in numbers to the entire population of\r\nWyoming--150,000 employes, not including those of connecting companies.]\r\n\r\nThe poles are set all over this country, and strung with wires and\r\ncables; the conduits are buried under the great cities; the telephones\r\nare installed in separate homes and offices; the switchboards housed,\r\nconnected and supplemented with other machinery, and the whole system\r\nkept in running order so that each subscriber may talk at any time,\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Sound Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nSomebody or something causes every sound we hear. Sounds are the result\r\nof disturbances in the air. Sound is produced by waves in the air. The\r\nbuzz of the bumble-bee is caused by the quick movement of his wings\r\nin the air. The wings themselves do not make the sound, but their\r\nmotion causes waves or vibrations in the air which produce the sound\r\nof buzzing. Every motion made by anybody or anything produces waves in\r\nthe air just like the waves you see in the water--a big movement makes\r\na big wave and a tiny movement a tiny wave. When you clap your hands\r\nyou make a disturbance in the air which causes a sound--the harder you\r\nclap the louder the sound. You can hear this sound and anybody else\r\nnear can hear it. If there were no air about us, however, we would hear\r\nno sound, even if we could live in such a condition of things, for it\r\nis the air waves produced striking against the drum of our ears that\r\nenable us to discern sounds. When we talk we make air waves also and\r\nthus produce sound. If you were deaf, and talked, you could not hear\r\nany sound, because even when there are air waves they must still strike\r\nagainst a sounding board in order to be recognized as sound--and the\r\ndrum of our ear is our sounding board for hearing sounds.\r\n\r\nWhen the air waves produced are regular we call the sound musical, and\r\nwhen they are irregular we call it noise. Some people can make musical\r\nsounds when they sing, while others cannot.\r\n\r\nIf you take a piece of thin wire and stretch it tightly, fastening it\r\nat both ends, and then pull it with your finger and let go, you will\r\nhear a musical sound, because the vibrations produced will be regular\r\nand will continue for some time. If you shorten the distance on the\r\nwire where it is fastened at both ends and pull it as before, the\r\nsound produced will be in a higher key. If you take a guitar and snap\r\nthe big G string you will produce the bass note of G. If the other\r\nG string (the smaller one) is in tune (if you watch the smaller one\r\nclosely while you strike the larger one) you will notice the smaller\r\none vibrate also. Sound waves of the same tone, although in different\r\noctaves, produce the same sounds, although in different keys.\r\n\r\nThis is the principle on which the piano is made to produce music.\r\nInside the piano are wires of different lengths and the keys of the\r\npiano are arranged to operate certain little hammers, each of which\r\nstrikes a certain wire. Every time you strike a piano key you cause one\r\nof the little hammers to hit its wire--the wire then makes vibrations\r\nwhich cause air waves. The air waves strike against the sounding board\r\nwhich is located behind the wires, and being thrown back into the air,\r\nstrike against the drum of our ears, and we can hear the note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can We Make Sounds With Our Throats?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sounds we make when we talk are produced in exactly the same way\r\nwith the exception of the little hammers. In our throats are two cords\r\nwhich we call our vocal cords. When we talk we cause these cords to\r\nvibrate and thus we make the sounds of our voices. The most wonderful\r\npart of this voice of ours is that with only two vocal cords or wires,\r\nwe can produce practically all the notes that can be made with a piano,\r\nwhich has a wire or cord for every note, excepting that we cannot make\r\nso many at one time. The human throat is so wonderfully constructed\r\nthat we can lengthen or shorten our vocal cords at will and produce,\r\nwith two strings, in our throats as many notes as it takes the piano\r\nmany more strings to produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does the Sound Stop When We Touch a Gong that Has Been Sounded?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we touch the gong we stop the sound waves which the gong gives\r\noff when it is struck. These sound waves continue after the gong has\r\nbeen struck in continuous vibrations until something stops them. When\r\nyou touch the vibrating gong, you stop its vibrating. If you only\r\ntouch your finger to the vibrating gong you can feel the vibrations\r\nwhich cause a little tickling sensation. Naturally when you stop these\r\nvibrations you stop the air waves which the vibrations cause, and thus\r\nalso the sound of these air waves striking your ear are stopped and the\r\nsound ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Can Sound Come Through a Thick Wall?\r\n\r\n\r\nA sound will come through a thick or thin wall only if the wall is a\r\ngood conductor of sound. Some things are good conductors of sound and\r\nothers are not, just as some things are good conductors of electricity\r\nand others are not. If a wall is built of materials all of which are\r\ngood conductors of sound, the sound will come through it no matter how\r\nthick. Wood is an especially good conductor of sound. It is even better\r\nthan air. You can stand at one end of a long log and have another\r\nperson at the other end hold up his watch in the air, and you cannot\r\nhear the watch tick, but if the watch is “going” as we say, and you ask\r\nthe person holding it to put the watch against his end of the log, and\r\nyou then put your ear to the other end, you can hear the watch ticking\r\nalmost as well as if you had it to your own ear. In like manner you can\r\nhear the scratching of a pin at the other end of the log. When you put\r\nyour ear against a telegraph pole you can hear the hum of the wires\r\nwhile you cannot hear it through the air. All sound is produced by\r\nsound waves and many solids are better conductors of sound waves than\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nSound waves, however, will sometimes not be heard as plainly through a\r\nwall, because of the fact that the wall may be made of materials which\r\nare not equally good conductors of sound. When a sound wave strikes a\r\npoor conductor it loses some of its power and the sound, although it\r\nmay be heard through the wall, will be fainter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Meant by Deadening a Floor or a Wall?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy deadening a floor, for instance, we mean inserting between the\r\nceiling of the room below and the floor above, or in the instance of a\r\ndeadened wall, between the two sides of the wall, some substance like\r\nfelt, paper or other non-conductor of sound, which will prevent the\r\nsound waves from passing through. This deadens them to the passing of\r\nsound or makes them sound-proof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Sounds Like Waves in a Sea Shell?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sounds we hear when we hold a sea shell to the ear are not really\r\nthe sound of the sea waves. We have come to imagine that they are\r\nbecause they sound like the waves of the sea, and knowledge that the\r\nshell originally came from the sea helps us to this conclusion very\r\neasily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are the Sounds We Hear in a Shell?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sounds we hear in the sea shell are really air waves or sounds made\r\nby air waves, because all sounds are produced by air waves.\r\n\r\nThe reason you can hear these sounds in a sea shell is because the\r\nshell is so constructed that it forms a natural sounding box. The\r\nwooden part of a guitar, zither or violin is a sounding box. They have\r\nthe faculty of picking up sounds and making them stronger. We call them\r\n“resonators,” because they make sounds resound. The construction of a\r\nsea shell makes an almost perfect resonator. A perfect resonator will\r\npick up sounds which the human ear cannot hear at all and magnify them\r\nso that if you hold a resonator to the ear you can hear sounds you\r\ncould not otherwise hear. Ear trumpets for the deaf are built upon this\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nSometimes when you, with your ear alone, think something is absolutely\r\nquiet, you can pick up a sea shell and hear sounds in it. But the sea\r\nshell will magnify any sound that reaches it.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible, of course, to take a sea shell to a place where\r\nit would be absolutely quiet and then there would be no sounds.\r\n\r\nThere are such places, but very few of them. A room can be built which\r\nis absolutely sound proof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIBERIAN LAMBS IN SOUTH DAKOTA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Suit of Clothes\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Wool Come From?\r\n\r\nWe could not write the story of a suit of clothes without dealing\r\nlargely with the sheep, for it is only from the wool of the sheep\r\nthat the best, warmest and most lasting garment can be made. In order\r\nthat we may properly understand the development of the great wool and\r\nclothing industry in America we must supply a brief history of our\r\nsheep industry, for the sheep must always come before the clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Brought the First Sheep to America?\r\n\r\nThe sheep is not a native of America, but it came here with the first\r\nwhite men. History records that Columbus on his way to this country\r\nstopped at the Canary Islands to take on stores. Among other things\r\nhe loaded a number of sheep, some of which were later landed on the\r\nnew continent. What became of this early importation history does not\r\nrecord, but it is probable that most, if not all, of them perished from\r\nthe attack of wild animals or at the hands of the natives. However,\r\nwhen settlers began pouring into the new world many of them brought\r\nalong their sheep, so that from the earliest colonial days the sheep\r\nconstituted our most numerous domestic animals. This, indeed, was\r\nnecessary, for if the colonist was to survive the rigor of our climate\r\nhe must have an abundant supply of woolen clothing. In those days\r\nclothing materials were limited to wool, flax and the skins of animals,\r\nand, as may be supposed, wools were in very great demand. England and\r\nmost European countries prohibited the exportation of wool, in order to\r\nincrease the demand for the clothing which she manufactured. However,\r\nas our new colonist had ample time and but little money, he desired\r\nto make his own clothing rather than send such funds as he had to the\r\nmother country. Therefore, the new settler, as a matter of necessity,\r\nwas forced to increase the domestic supply of wools.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Started to Make Clothing from Wool in America?\r\n\r\nEarly records reveal that shortly after the year 1600 many of the\r\ncolonies passed laws for the purpose of encouraging the sheep industry.\r\nIn fact, some of them went so far as to prohibit the transportation\r\nof sheep or wool from one colony to another. However, our new sheep\r\nindustry prospered, and well it should, for it had the backing of every\r\nprominent patriot of the early days. Washington, Jefferson, Madison,\r\nand Franklin all were enthusiastic advocates of sheep husbandry, for\r\nthey knew that unless a people had a large domestic supply of wool they\r\ncould not long remain independent or hope to gain independence from\r\nforeign countries. In fact, at one time Washington owned as many as one\r\nthousand sheep, and if he lived in the present day he would be regarded\r\nas a sheep baron. Wool, next to food, is the most vital necessity of a\r\npeople, for when wars come wool becomes a contraband, and all foreign\r\nsupplies are shut off. Thus, in stimulating a domestic wool supply the\r\ngreat wisdom of our early patriots was vindicated with the coming of\r\nthe Revolutionary War. When that great struggle came our foreign wool\r\nsupply was shut off, but on account of the foresight of these patriots\r\nin encouraging home production, our colonists had a supply ample for\r\nmost of their needs.\r\n\r\nWe not only had the wool, but the housewife had learned the art of\r\nmanufacturing wool into clothing by means of the spinning wheel, so\r\nthat when our soldiers went forth in that great struggle, which was to\r\nbring to us independence, they were clad in garments made of American\r\ngrown wool and manufactured by the good housewife during her hours of\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nWhen affairs became tranquil, following the close of the Revolution,\r\nsettlement, which had largely been confined to the Atlantic coast,\r\npushed westward farther and farther into the wilderness. Each of\r\nthese settlers took with him his supply of sheep, for the purpose of\r\nfurnishing wool for clothing and meat for food. In the early days\r\nwool was not grown for the purpose of sale, but to be used entirely\r\nby the family of the producer. However, when settlement reached the\r\nMississippi River, conditions changed. Wool manufacturing had then been\r\nestablished in the land, and it became customary to raise wool to sell\r\nto these manufacturers, who had located along the Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does the Sheep Precede the Plow in Civilizing a Country?\r\n\r\nIn all countries the sheep has been the pioneer of civilization. They\r\nhave settled and developed practically all new lands. In fact, so\r\nfirmly established has been this rule that it seems almost necessary\r\nthat the sheep should precede the plow, and thus prepare land for\r\nagriculture. The reason for this is that the sheep is a tractable\r\nanimal and depends on man to guide its every step. It can endure\r\nhardships that would destroy other forms of animal life. However, the\r\nmaintenance of a sheep industry requires an abundance of labor, and in\r\nthis way settlement always follows the sheep. So has it been in foreign\r\ncountries, and so was it in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Most of Our Wool Come From?\r\n\r\nSheep came into our western states early in the seventies, at a time\r\nwhen these states were thinly settled, but following the sheep came the\r\nlabor incident to its care, and thus the railroads, stores, cities and\r\nschoolhouses found their way into the land. Originally all of our sheep\r\nindustry was east of the Mississippi River. Then for a time it was east\r\nof the Missouri River. To-day west of the Missouri River we have about\r\n23,000,000 aged sheep, or more than one-half of the total in the United\r\nStates. In the pioneer days the western sheep skirmished on the range\r\nfor most of the food that it obtained. To-day conditions are different,\r\nand, while the sheep is on the range for a short time each year, it\r\nspends its summer in the National Forest, for which grazing a fee is\r\npaid to the Federal Government. Its winters are spent largely around\r\nthe hay-stack of the farmer, and about fifty to sixty cents’ worth of\r\nhay is fed to each sheep in the West each winter. With the coming of\r\nspring the western sheep are divided into bands of about 1500, and each\r\ntwo bands are placed in care of three caretakers, who care for and\r\nprotect the sheep either on the deeded land of the owner or on the land\r\nrented from the Federal Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP COMING OUT OF FOREST]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much Wool Does America Produce Yearly?\r\n\r\nSo much for the history of our sheep. A few words now about wool. The\r\ntotal wool crop of the United States is approximately 300,000,000\r\npounds per year. The value of this crop is around $60,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do We Get the Wool Off the Sheep?\r\n\r\nWith the coming of spring our sheep are driven to large central plants,\r\nwhere they are shorn by the use of machines driven by electricity or\r\nsteam power. One man shears about one hundred and fifty sheep per day.\r\nFor this he receives eight cents per head. When the wool is taken off\r\nthe sheep it is gathered up and carefully tied with string made of\r\npaper. The tied fleece is then dropped into an elevator, and is carried\r\nup about ten feet, where it is dropped into a large sack about three\r\nfeet in diameter and seven feet long. In this sack there is always a\r\nwool tramper, who keeps tramping the fleeces down, so that about forty\r\nfleeces are finally put into each sack, making the weight of the sack\r\napproximately three hundred pounds. As these sacks are filled they are\r\ncarefully stored in a dry shed, and, when shearing is completed, are\r\nhauled to the railroad station and shipped to the great wool centers of\r\nBoston or Philadelphia. While the bulk of the wool in the United States\r\nis produced west of the Missouri River, that territory manufactures\r\nvery little wool. So the western sheepman, who is thus forced to grow\r\nhis wool in the western states, pays about two cents a pound freight on\r\nit back to the eastern market, where it is sold and later manufactured\r\ninto cloth. A part of this same clothing is then shipped west, to be\r\nsold to the very man, in some instances, who produced the wool out of\r\nwhich it is made.\r\n\r\nAmerican wool, taken as a whole, is the best wool grown in the world.\r\nIt is not as soft as some Australian wool, but all of it possesses\r\na greater strength than foreign wools, and it has long since been\r\ndetermined that clothing made of American wool will give better service\r\nthan that made of foreign wool. Of the wool used in the United States\r\nfor the manufacturing of clothing we produce about 70 per cent and\r\nimport about 30 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much Does the Wool In a Suit of Clothes Cost?\r\n\r\nIt is customary for the person who buys clothing made of wool to\r\nbelieve that the value of the wool in the cloth is what makes the\r\nclothing seem expensive. However, if we take a man’s suit made of\r\nmedium-weight cloth, such as is worn in November, we find that it\r\nrequires about nine pounds of average wool to make the suit. For this\r\nwool the sheepman receives an average of seventeen cents per pound, so\r\nthat out of the entire suit the man who produces the material out of\r\nwhich the suit is made receives a total of $1.53. A suit such as is\r\nhere described would be of all wool and free from shoddy or any wool\r\nsubstitute. It would be a suit that would be sold by the storekeeper\r\nat $25.00, and if you had it made by the tailor he would charge you\r\n$35.00. Yet the wool-grower furnished all the material out of which\r\nthe suit was made, and received as his share but $1.53. Thus it will\r\nbe clear to the person who buys clothing and reads these lines that no\r\nlonger can the blame for the high cost of clothing be laid at the door\r\nof the wool-grower.\r\n\r\nWhile the wool-using population of the world is increasing very\r\nrapidly, the number of wool-producing sheep in the world is decreasing.\r\nOrdinarily this would mean that a point would be reached where the\r\nsupply of wool would be totally inadequate to meet the needs of the\r\npublic. However, this unfortunate possibility is being averted by the\r\nenergy and thrift of the sheepmen in breeding sheep that produce more\r\nand better wool than was the case in the past. The sheep which Columbus\r\nbrought to this country, and, in fact, all the sheep of the world in\r\nthat day, produced wool of very coarse, inferior quality, and but very\r\nlittle of it. One hundred years ago our sheep did not average three\r\npounds of wool per head, but by careful breeding and better feeding we\r\nhave brought the average fleece up to slightly more than seven pounds.\r\nOf course, some sheep produce decidedly more wool than this, but the\r\nfact that in one hundred years we have more than doubled the amount of\r\nwool that a sheep produces and increased its quality very materially\r\nspeaks well for the ingenuity and determination of our sheep producers.\r\nProbably as time goes on the average fleece may be still further\r\nincreased, so that in the next twenty-five years it is not too much to\r\nhope that our sheep will produce on an average of one pound more wool\r\nthan they now do.\r\n\r\nOf course, as wool comes from the sheep, it naturally contains much\r\ndirt. The sheep have run on the range or in the open pasture during\r\nmuch of the year, and dust and dirt has settled into the wool. Then,\r\nbesides producing wool, the sheep excrete into the wool a fatty\r\nsubstance known as wool fat. When the fleece is taken from the sheep\r\nand sent to the market the first thing that the manufacturer does with\r\nthe fleece is to wash out all this foreign matter. The foreign matter\r\nis of a considerable quantity, for 60 per cent of wool as it comes from\r\nthe sheep is dirt and grease, so that only 40 per cent of the sheep’s\r\nfleece represents wool fibres.\r\n\r\nThis wool fibre is a very delicate affair, being made up of thousands\r\nof little cells, one laid on top of the other. On the surface of the\r\nfibre are a lot of scales arranged something like the scales on a fish.\r\nIn the process of manufacturing the scales on one fibre lock with\r\nscales on another fibre, and in that way the fibres are held together\r\nin the piece of cloth.\r\n\r\nWhen wool is received at the factory it is in fleeces, and each fleece\r\ncontains different kinds of fibres--long and short--coarse and fine,\r\nand it is necessary that these should be sorted into different kinds\r\nor grades, as may be desired--perhaps six or eight different kinds,\r\naccording to the particular uses to which the different qualities are\r\nto be put.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nWOOL SORTING]\r\n\r\nThe fleece is spread out on a table, the center of which is covered\r\nwith wire netting, and through this netting part of the dust and other\r\nmatter from the wool falls while the sorting is going on. Sorters tear\r\nwith the hands the different parts of the fleece from each other and\r\nseparate them into piles, according to their different qualities.\r\n\r\nAll unwashed wool contains a fatty or greasy matter called yolk, which\r\nis a secretion from the skin of the sheep. The effect of this yolk is\r\nto prevent the fibres of the wool from matting, except at the ends,\r\nwhere, of course, it collects dust, and, forming a sort of a coating,\r\nreally serves as a protection to the rest of the fleece while on the\r\nsheep’s back.\r\n\r\nAfter the wool is sorted it is next cleansed or scoured, in order to\r\nremove all this yolk, dirt and foreign matter, and this is accomplished\r\nby passing the wool, by means of automatic rakes, through a washing\r\nmachine, consisting of a set of three or four vats or bowls, which\r\ncontain a cleansing solution of warm, soapy water, until all the grease\r\nand dirt have been removed.\r\n\r\nEach bowl has its set of rollers, which squeezes out the water from\r\nthe wool before it passes into the next bowl. Having passed through\r\nthe last bowl and set of rollers the wool is carried on an apron made\r\nof slats on chains, to the drying chamber, called the dryer, where is\r\ntaken out most of the moisture.\r\n\r\nThe wool is now blown through pipes or carried on trucks to the carding\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n~DIFFERENCE IN WOOLENS AND WORSTEDS~\r\n\r\nFrom this point the wool follows one of two different processes of\r\nmanufacture--that of making into worsteds or that of making into\r\nwoolens.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in a general way, worsted fabrics are made of yarns in which\r\nthe fibres all lie parallel, and woolens are made of yarns in which\r\nthe fibres cross or are mixed. Ordinarily, worsteds are made from long\r\nstaple wools, and woolens from short staple wools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nWOOL SCOURING]\r\n\r\nBy means of the comb the fibre is still further straightened out, the\r\nshort stock and noil, or nibs, are removed, and when the sliver comes\r\nfrom the combs most of the fibres are parallel to each other. A number\r\nof the slivers taken from the comb are then put through two further\r\noperations of gilling, and wound into a large ball, which is called a\r\nfinished top.\r\n\r\nThe next process in the manufacture of worsteds is carding. In this\r\nprocess the wool is passed between cylinders and rollers, from\r\nwhich project the ends of many small wires. These cylinders revolve\r\nin opposite directions. The result is the opening, separating and\r\nstraightening of the fibres; and the wool is delivered in soft strands,\r\nwhich are taken off by the doffer comb and wound upon a wooden roll\r\ninto the shape of a large ball, known as a card-ball or card-sliver, or\r\nput into a revolving can. The sliver from a number of these balls or\r\ncans is now taken and put through what is known as the gilling machine,\r\nwhich to a degree straightens the fibres.\r\n\r\nFrom the gilling machine the wool comes off in soft strands. Four\r\nstrands are then taken to the balling machine, where is made a large\r\nball, ready for the combing. It takes eighteen of these balls to make a\r\nset or fill up the comb.\r\n\r\nThe dyeing is done in three ways--in the top, in the thread or skein\r\nafter being spun, or in the piece after it is woven. If the wool is to\r\nbe stock dyed--that is, dyed in the top--it is sent to the dyehouse to\r\nbe dyed the shade required, and afterwards returned to be gilled and\r\nrecombed ready for the drawing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nWORSTED CARDING]\r\n\r\nUp to this point there has been no twist given to the wool, nor any\r\nappearance of a thread. The top, the soft untwisted end, is now run\r\nthrough the drawing machine, the process sometimes consisting of nine\r\ndistinct operations, and is drawn and redrawn until reduced to the size\r\nrequired for its special purpose; and the stock is then delivered to\r\nthe spinning room on spools, and is called roving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nGILLING AFTER CARDING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nCOMBING]\r\n\r\nIn the spinning the process of drawing continues until the twisted\r\nthread is reduced to the size required, which, either singly or twisted\r\ntogether in two, three or four strands, is to be used for weaving.\r\n\r\nThe yarn is then very carefully inspected, and all imperfections which\r\nwould show in the finished goods are removed, and, if it is to be dyed\r\nin the skein, the yarn is taken to a reel, where the skeins are made\r\nready for the dyehouse.\r\n\r\n~HOW CLOTH IS MADE FROM WOOL~\r\n\r\nThe threads must now be prepared for the loom, in order that the actual\r\nweaving may be done. The thread is used in two ways in weaving--as\r\nwarp, which is the thread which runs lengthwise of the cloth, and as\r\nfilling, or woof, which runs across the cloth from side to side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nGILLING AND MAKING TOP AFTER COMBING]\r\n\r\nThe warp threads--the threads which run lengthwise of the cloth--are\r\nsized and wound upon large reels, and from these transferred to a large\r\nwooden roll called the warp beam, which holds all the warp threads,\r\nusually several thousands.\r\n\r\nThe filling threads are put on shuttle bobbins and placed in the\r\nshuttles to be refilled by the operatives as required, and as the\r\nweaving progresses.\r\n\r\nThe warp beam is then taken to the drawing-in room, where these several\r\nthousand threads are drawn through wire heddles in a frame called the\r\nharness, then drawn through a wire reed. The completed warp beam is now\r\nready for the loom.\r\n\r\nThe harnesses are placed in the loom, and by means of what is called\r\nthe “head-motion,” part of the threads are raised and part are lowered.\r\nThis allows the filling shuttles to pass above some threads and below\r\nothers, filling out the pattern required.\r\n\r\nThe cloth, having been made in such length as is desired, is taken from\r\nthe loom, and, by what is known as burling and mending, any knots or\r\nthreads woven in wrongly are removed, and any imperfections which have\r\nbeen discovered through a careful examination are corrected.\r\n\r\nThe web or cloth is scoured or washed and the oil and any foreign\r\nmatter removed.\r\n\r\nUndressed fabrics would now be fulled. This consists of running cloth\r\nthrough a fulling machine, where, moistened with a specially prepared\r\nsoap, it is subjected to a great pressure and pounding, which aids in\r\ngiving the required finish.\r\n\r\nThere are different kinds of finishes which require different\r\ntreatments, and it would be impracticable for us to dwell in detail\r\nupon this matter here.\r\n\r\nIf dyed in the piece, the web or cloth is taken to the dyehouse and\r\ndyed. It is thoroughly rinsed, all moisture is extracted from it, and\r\nit is dried.\r\n\r\nAfter drying the cloth is run through a machine by which it is brushed\r\nand sheared, the brushing lifting the long fibres, and the shearing\r\ncutting them off at even length. The cloth is put through the press,\r\nwhich irons it out, giving it the lustre or the finish that is desired.\r\nIt is examined again for further imperfections, and if such have\r\noccurred they are corrected.\r\n\r\nMeasuring, weighing, rolling and tagging follow, and the cloth is\r\npacked and ready for the market.\r\n\r\nWoolens are made from short staple wools, known as clothing wools, and\r\nin the finished woolens the fibres of the yarns cross or are mingled\r\ntogether. In the case of woolens, after the scouring, it is frequently\r\nnecessary to remove burrs or other vegetable matter from the wool. To\r\naccomplish this the wool is dipped in a bath of chloride of aluminum or\r\nsulphuric acid solution, then the moisture is extracted and the wool\r\nis put through a drier, where the temperature must be at least 212\r\ndegrees. This heat carbonizes the foreign substance, but has little\r\neffect on the animal fibres of the wool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FINISHING BOX\r\n\r\nENGLISH DRAWING\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nGILLING\r\n\r\nENGLISH DRAWING\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company]\r\n\r\nNext, an ingenious machine called the burr picker removes the burr.\r\n\r\nSometimes there is to be a blend of the wool with other stocks, and in\r\nthat case the several different wools are mixed together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GILLING, FIRST OPERATION\r\n\r\nENGLISH DRAWING\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nREDUCER\r\n\r\nENGLISH DRAWING\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company]\r\n\r\n~HOW WOOLEN CLOTH IS DYED~\r\n\r\nDyeing of woolens is done in three ways--in the wool, in the thread\r\nafter it is spun, or in the piece after it is woven. If the wool is\r\nto be “dyed in the wool” it is now conveyed to the dyehouse, dyed the\r\nshade required, then returned to the mixing room.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of scouring, when the yolk was removed, a large part\r\nof the natural oil of the wool was also eliminated, and, in order to\r\nrestore this lubricant, the wool is sprinkled with an oil emulsion, and\r\nthe mixing picker thoroughly blends the wools.\r\n\r\nFrom here the wool goes to the cardroom, and by means of the carding\r\nmachine the fibres are carded and drawn and delivered to the finisher\r\nin a broad, flat sheet. By means of the condenser it is divided into\r\nnarrow bands, and the wool--free as yet from twist--comes out in soft\r\nstrands. These strands or threads are called roping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENDING ROOM\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nBURLING RAISING KNOTS\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nMENDING PERCHING\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAWING IN WARP THREADS\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Co.\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Co.\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Co.\r\n\r\nWEAVING AND SCOURING]\r\n\r\nNow comes the mule spinning. The roping passes through rolls by which\r\nit is drawn and twisted to the size required, and wound on paper cop\r\ntubes or bobbins. Such of the yarn as is to be used for warp is then\r\nspooled from the bobbins to dresser spools. It is sized and wound upon\r\nlarge reels: from these transferred to the warp beam, as in the case of\r\nworsteds.\r\n\r\nThe processes of drawing-in, preparation for weaving, burling and\r\nmending are practically the same as in the case of worsteds.\r\n\r\n~HOW THE CLOTH IS MADE PERFECT~\r\n\r\nThe finishing processes of woolens, like the finishing processes of\r\nworsteds, vary with different fabrics, some fabrics being scoured and\r\ncleansed in the washers before fulling, others going to the fulling\r\nmill without cleansing. After fulling, the cloth is again washed\r\nand rinsed, and if necessary to remove any vegetable fibres it is\r\ncarbonized.\r\n\r\nNapping or gigging raises the fibres to the nap desired. Gigging is\r\ndone by means of a wire napping machine or teasel gig, which raises\r\nthe ends of the fibres on the face of the cloth. The teasel is a\r\nvegetable product about the shape of a pine cone, and it is interesting\r\nto note that no mechanical contrivance has ever been invented to equal\r\nit for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINNING THE WOOL\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nENGLISH CAP SPINNING]\r\n\r\nThe napping which has been raised by the teasel is sheared or cut to a\r\nproper length by machine. The cloth is pressed, and, if it is desired\r\nto finish it with lustre, it is wound upon copper cylinders and steam\r\nis forced through it at a high pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nRING TWISTING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nBEAMING--YARN INSPECTING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nWOOLEN MULE SPINNING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nFINISHER WOOLEN CARDING]\r\n\r\nNext the cloth is dyed, if it is to be piece-dyed--that is, dyed in\r\nthe piece. If the cloth is a mixture, the wool was dyed immediately\r\nafter the scouring. In worsteds the dyeing is done either just after it\r\nhas been subjected to the first combing processes, or the yarn is dyed\r\nin the skein or hank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Co.\r\n\r\nPIECE DYEING\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Co.\r\n\r\nFULLING CLOTH\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nFINISH PERCHING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright American Woolen Company\r\n\r\nFINISHED CLOTH, READY FOR THE TAILOR]\r\n\r\nIn the dry finishing the cloth is finished with various kinds of\r\nfinishes desired, and it is steamed, brushed, sheared and pressed.\r\nAnother examination for any imperfections or defects follows; the cloth\r\nis measured, packed and tagged and is ready for the market.\r\n\r\nThe difference between worsteds and woolens is principally that in the\r\nthreads or yarns from which worsteds are made the fibres of the wool\r\nlie parallel, one to another, being made from combed wool, from which\r\nthe short fibres have been removed; and woolens are made from yarns in\r\nwhich the fibres cross and are matted and intermixed. When finished\r\nthe effect of worsteds and woolens is materially different. Upon\r\nexamination it will be found that the worsted thread resembles a wire\r\nin evenness, while the woolen thread is uneven and irregular.\r\n\r\nA worsted fabric when finished has a clear, bright, well defined\r\npattern, seems close and firmly woven, and is of a pronounced dressy\r\neffect; while woolen cloths are softer, they are more elastic, the\r\ncolors are more blended, the threads are not so easily distinguishable\r\nand the general effect is duller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can’t We See in the Dark?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot see in the dark because there is no light to see by. To\r\nunderstand this we must first understand that when we see a thing, as\r\nwe generally say, we do not actually see the thing itself, but only the\r\nlight coming from it. But we have become so used to saying that we see\r\nthe thing itself that for all practical purposes we can accept that as\r\ntrue, although it is not scientifically exact. Scientifically speaking,\r\nwe see that part of the sunlight or other light which is shining upon\r\nit, which the object is able to reflect.\r\n\r\nIf there were no air about us we could not hear any sounds, no matter\r\nhow much disturbance people or things created, because it requires air\r\nto cause the sound waves which produce sound, and air also to carry\r\nthe sound waves to our ears. In the same way, if there is no light\r\nto produce light rays from any given object to our eyes, we can see\r\nnothing. It requires light waves to produce the reflections of objects\r\nto our eyes. Without light our eyes and their delicate organs are\r\nuseless. You cannot see yourself in a mirror when the quicksilver which\r\nwas once on the back of the glass has been removed, because there is\r\nthen nothing to reflect the light. We can only see things when there is\r\nlight enough about to reflect things to our eyes. When it is dark there\r\nis no light, and that is the reason we cannot see anything in the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can Cats and Some Other Animals See in the Dark?\r\n\r\n\r\nThey cannot see in the real dark any more than human beings. These\r\nanimals can find their way in the dark and can see more than a human\r\nbeing, because of one distinct difference in their eyes, which may for\r\nthem be considered an advantage. The pupils of their eyes can be made\r\nmuch larger, and they can, therefore, let more light into their eyes\r\nthan people. The result is that when it is so dark that you cannot\r\nsee a thing and you decide it is really dark, the cat can still see,\r\nbecause there is always a little more light left and she can open the\r\npupils of her eyes and make them larger, thus letting in more light,\r\nand the little bit of light there is still left gets into her eyes and\r\nshe is able to see. But in a really dark room a cat could see no more\r\nthan you can. You see, our eyes open and shut more or less just like\r\nthose of the cat, according to the intensity of the light. When you go\r\nout of the dark and shaded room into the bright sunlight and look at\r\nthe sun, you naturally squint your eyes without deliberately intending\r\nto do so. This is nature’s way of preventing too much light getting\r\ninto your eyes at one time. Gradually the pupils of your eyes contract\r\nand get smaller, until you can see, without squinting, anything in\r\nthe sunlight. If, then, you were to go right back into a dark or\r\nshaded room, you would have to wait a moment or two before you could\r\nsee things distinctly in the room--until the pupils of your eyes had\r\ndilated (become larger), so as to let in enough light to enable you to\r\nsee normally. The eye automatically enlarges and contracts the pupil of\r\nthe eye, to enable us to see distinctly in either light or less light\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is It Difficult to Walk Straight with My Eyes Closed?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason we cannot do this always is because when we walk naturally\r\nthe steps taken by our right and left feet are not of equal length.\r\nThis difference in the length of the steps is due to the fact that our\r\nlegs are never exactly the same length. We think of them generally as\r\nof the same length, but they are not, and this will be proven if you\r\nmeasure them accurately. Now, then, the longer of the legs will always\r\ntake a longer step than the shorter one, and so, if our eyes are shut,\r\nwe walk in circles, unless we have something to guide us. When we\r\nwalk with our eyes open, we are able to overcome the tendency to walk\r\nin circles, because our eyes help the brain to direct the legs on a\r\nstraight course. Another reason which affects the matter is that our\r\neyes are very necessary in keeping our bodies balanced on our feet, and\r\nit is very difficult to learn to keep the body balanced with the eyes\r\nclosed. Now, when your eyes are closed and you attempt to walk in a\r\nstraight line your body balances from one side to the other, and this\r\nfact, coupled with the first reason given, makes your course irregular.\r\nBut, say you, the man on the tight-rope has his eyes bandaged and he\r\nwalks a very straight line. Yes; but remember that he has a straight\r\ntight-rope to guide him, and all he needs is to maintain his balance.\r\nOne can learn to walk in a straight line with the eyes closed, but it\r\ntakes a good deal of practice, as you will learn if you try.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can’t We Sleep with Our Eyes Open?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot sleep with our eyes open, because to be asleep involves\r\nlosing control of most of the functions of the body. When we sleep\r\nthe brain sleeps also. Perhaps it would be stated more clearly to say\r\nthat we cannot sleep while the part of the brain which controls our\r\nactivities is awake. There is a part of the brain which has the power\r\nto open our eyes, i. e., lift the eyelids, and when that portion of the\r\nbrain ceases to exercise its power to keep the eyes open, they go shut.\r\nEven when we are awake that part of our brain cannot keep our eyes\r\nfrom winking, because there is another part of the brain which sees to\r\nit that our eyes wink every so often. This is done for the purpose of\r\nwashing the eye-ball, and is the answer to another of your questions\r\nwhich is given in another place in this book. When the engineer at the\r\nelectric light plant shuts off the power all the lights go out, and\r\nwhen you go to sleep you automatically shut off the power that opens\r\nyour eyes, and the eyes are shut. The brain is asleep also, and if it\r\nis not completely asleep, you are restless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Our Eyes Sparkle When We Are Merry?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you should watch very closely the eyes of a merry person when you\r\nsee them sparkle you would probably notice that the eyelids move up and\r\ndown more often under such conditions than ordinarily, and if you know\r\nwhat moving the eyelids up and down in front of the pupil of the eye\r\ndoes, you will have your answer.\r\n\r\nEvery time the eyelid comes down it releases a little tear, which\r\nspreads over the eyeball and washes it clean and bright. It does this\r\nevery time the eyelid comes down. Now, there is something about being\r\nmerry which has the effect of making the eyelids dance up and down,\r\nand thus, every time the lid comes down, the ball of the eye is washed\r\nclean and bright, and gives it the appearance of sparkling, as we say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Laugh When Glad?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe laugh when glad because the things which make us laugh combine\r\ntogether to rouse those parts of the body which are involved in a\r\ngood laugh to act in a certain harmony, and when this combination is\r\narranged in a certain way it produces a laugh. Certain things in the\r\nworld, whether they are funny, ludicrous, or other things that produce\r\nthe laughing effect, cause the brain to work certain muscles and\r\nnerves in a combination that produces a laugh. The impression which\r\nreaches the brain causes these muscles and nerves to act involuntarily\r\nand the laugh comes. It works just like the keys of the piano. Some\r\ncombinations of notes produce sad sounds and other combinations produce\r\nglad sounds, but the combination when once touched will always produce\r\nthe same sound. It is the impressions made on the brain which start the\r\nproper combination, and it does this instantly. Just as a pin prick in\r\nthe arm will at once send a “hurt” message to the brain and cause the\r\nbrain to jerk the arm away, so a laugh-producing combination of sounds,\r\nor things we see, or feel, sends an impression to the brain which at\r\nonce sends out the “laugh” order. Some things make some people laugh\r\nwhile they do not affect others at all. That is because our brains are\r\nnot always the same in regard to recording impressions. Some things\r\nimpress some brains one way and others entirely in a different way or\r\nnot at all. You do not laugh so heartily the second time you hear a\r\nfunny story, because the impression the brain receives when the story\r\nis told the second time is not so vivid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do I Laugh When Tickled?\r\n\r\n\r\nPractically the same things happen when we are tickled, and explains\r\nwhy you laugh when tickled. When some one tickles the bottom of your\r\nfeet or your ribs or another part of your body it produces, in most\r\ncases, the same effect on the brain as the laugh-producing sound or\r\nsight, and arouses the same combination of muscles and nerves to\r\nactivity. It is just like pushing the button of an electric bell. When\r\nyou push the button the contact produces the spark which sets the\r\nmachinery of the bell in motion and the bell rings and will continue\r\nto ring as long as you keep your finger on the button, or until the\r\nspark-producing power of the battery is gone. Then, as in the case\r\nof the bell, you cease to laugh, because the spark that produced the\r\nlaugh combination is gone. That is why some things tickle some people\r\nvery much and do not affect others. Some are not so sensitive to the\r\nlaugh-producing combination as others. After the thing that tickles you\r\nhas been going on for some time you are not tickled into laughter any\r\nmore, because the impression on the brain ceases to be as strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Don’t I Laugh When I Tickle Myself?\r\n\r\n\r\nYour mind tells you there is no need to laugh when you tickle yourself.\r\nYour mind will not respond to the tickling sensation when it is aware\r\nthat the cause of the tickle is yourself. The reflex action of the mind\r\nwhich causes laughter and squirming when some one else tickles you only\r\nacts when it is not conscious of the cause.\r\n\r\nThe whole purpose of the sensitive organization of our skins is to\r\ngive us information and cause action which will enable us to protect\r\nourselves when any outside influence touches us. An injurious touch\r\ncauses shock and pain, and the harmless tickle arouses the laughing and\r\nsquirming sensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens When We Laugh?\r\n\r\n\r\nLaughter is what we call a reflex action. When something occurs to\r\nmake us laugh, whether it is something we see, or feel, or hear, it is\r\nbecause certain sensory nerves receive an impression in one of three\r\nways, carry it to the nerve centre and the nerve centre then sends\r\nthe same impression along certain efferent nerves, which connect with\r\ncertain muscles or glands, and excite them to activity. The action is\r\npractically the same as when you hold a light before a mirror. The\r\nrays from the light strike the surface of the mirror and are reflected\r\nback from the surface, lighting perhaps corners of the room, which the\r\ndirect rays from the light could not reach, all depending upon the\r\nangle of reflection. Light will always reflect from a mirror that is\r\nexposed to it.\r\n\r\nNow, then, when you see, hear or feel anything that makes you laugh,\r\nthe sensory nerves have only to receive the impression to bring on\r\nthe explosion of laughter. Something touched the laugh nerves or the\r\nlaugh trigger that caused it to go off. You can prove that it is a\r\nmatter of impression entirely by noting that some people can listen\r\nto a perfectly funny story, even when told by a clever performer, and\r\nnever crack a smile, while others burst into uncontrollable laughter,\r\nand he who does not even smile may be listening even more intently than\r\nthe other--he may even be looking for a laugh. It all depends upon the\r\nimpression that is made upon the nerves. The muscles have the power\r\nto express the state of gladness which is indicated by laughter when\r\ncertain impressions pass along the nerves which operate them, just as\r\nthey can be made to do other things when the proper cause for action is\r\nshown them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Cry When Hurt?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cry when we are hurt for the same reason that we laugh when we\r\nare glad. The muscles and nerves, under the direction of the brain,\r\nproduce the cry just as the muscles and nerves produce laughter,\r\nalthough they are probably, but not necessarily, a different set of\r\nmuscles and nerves.\r\n\r\nWhen we are hurt in any part of our body or feelings the impression\r\ndoes not affect us until it reaches the brain. Then instantly, of\r\ncourse, the body and brain go to work to destroy the pain. The first\r\nthing, of course, is to give a warning to other parts of the body that\r\nthere is a hurt, and our crying is a warning to other people that we\r\nare hurt. That is probably the only good that crying does. It does not\r\nremove the hurt--it only tells others of our troubles. We cry with the\r\nlower part of the brain--the only portion of the brain which is active\r\nin a little baby. This is why even a tiny baby can cry. Crying is the\r\nonly thing a baby can do to give warning of its distress or discomfort.\r\nLater in life the upper part of the brain develops. This is the master\r\nof the lower part. Therefore, we do not always cry when hurt as we grow\r\nolder, because the master brain sometimes tells the lower brain that to\r\ncry will not help matters in the least, even though we are inclined to\r\ncry. Sometimes the hurt or shock to older people is so great or sudden\r\nthat we cry out before the controlling part of the brain has had time\r\nto get in its work of preventing the outcry, but we are able to stop\r\ncrying when the master brain again secures control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Do Tears Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nTears are not made only when we cry. They seem to come only when you\r\ncry, because it is then that they spill over. A little part of you\r\nis making tears all the time, and your eyes are constantly washing\r\nthemselves in them. You have often noticed how you wink every few\r\nseconds? You have often tried to keep from winking--to see how long\r\nyou could keep from winking. Boys and girls often do that, and when\r\nyou keep from winking what seems a long time, you notice how your eyes\r\nache and feel very dry just before you have to let them wink, in spite\r\nof how hard you try not to, and just when you think you are not going\r\nto. I will tell you just what winking does for the eyes. All of the\r\ntime your eyes are open the front, or the part you see things with, is\r\nexposed to the dust and dirt that fills the air at all times, although\r\nwe cannot always see the dust. The wind, too, is constantly making them\r\ndry. But have you ever noticed that although you never wash the inside\r\nof the front of the eye, or pupil, it is always clean? Well, it is\r\nbecause your eye washes itself every time you wink. I will tell you how\r\nthis is done. Up above each eye, inside, of course, there is a little\r\ngland called the tear-gland. This gland is busy all the time you are\r\nawake making tears. As soon as the front of your eye becomes dry, or\r\nif a particle of dust or anything else strikes it, the nerves you have\r\nthere tell the brain, and almost at once the eyelid comes down with a\r\ntear inside of it, and so washes the front of your eye clean again. It\r\ndoes its work perfectly and as often as necessary. There is always a\r\ntear ready to be used in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Do the Tears Go?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me show you. Look right down here at the inner corner of my eyelid,\r\nwhere you will see a little hole. That is where the tears get out of\r\nthe eye, when they have washed your eyeball clean. Where do they go\r\nthen? Did you ever notice how soon after you cry you have to blow your\r\nnose? The reason for that is that when the tears go through the little\r\nhole they run down into the nose. This making of tears and winking\r\ngoes on all the time while you are awake, and after they wash your eye\r\noff they go on out through this little hole. But when you cry you make\r\nmore tears come than you need, so many, in fact, that they cannot all\r\nget away through this little hole, and as there is no place else for\r\nthem to go, and as there is no place to keep them inside the eye, they\r\nsimply spill themselves right over the edge of your lower eyelid and\r\nrun down your cheek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStory in a Barrel of Cement\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Cement?\r\n\r\nThe dictionary tells us that cement is “any adhesive substance which\r\nmakes two bodies cohere.” Thus any material performing this function\r\nmay be called cement, such, for example, as the cement used in mending\r\nbroken china. Glue also is a form of cement. This story has to do with\r\nPortland cement, which is a structural or building material used in\r\ncountless ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is Cement Called Portland Cement?\r\n\r\nAfter being wet with water it hardens into stone, and it was given the\r\nname “Portland” because, when first manufactured in England, and mixed\r\nwith sand and stone, it resembled a celebrated building stone called\r\nPortland, which was obtained from the Isle of Portland. Compared with\r\nother American industries, the manufacture of Portland cement is of\r\nrecent origin. Formerly all Portland cement was brought from foreign\r\ncountries. After successful manufacture became established in this\r\ncountry, however, the industry advanced with great rapidity. A few\r\nyears ago the entire United States did not use as much cement as is\r\nnow used in any one of our large cities. At the time these facts were\r\nwritten (1914) the manufacturers were making more than 90 millions of\r\nbarrels a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Cement Made Of?\r\n\r\nPortland cement is composed chiefly of lime, alumina and silica. It\r\nis manufactured from rocks, marl, clay and shale containing these\r\ningredients. If any one of them is lacking in the raw material as it\r\nis taken from the earth, it is supplied during process of manufacture.\r\nThe greatest cement district in America is in Pennsylvania, and is\r\nknown as the “Lehigh District.” A rock containing proper constituents\r\nfor making Portland cement was found there in vast quantities, and for\r\na number of years the Lehigh District was the center of the industry.\r\nIn time it was found that certain clays, marls and shale could also be\r\nmanufactured into Portland cement, and thus mills have been erected\r\nin all sections of the United States. One of the largest companies\r\nin the United States found that cement could be manufactured from a\r\ncombination of blast-furnace slag and limestone, and this is now made\r\nby the company in large quantities, the product being a true Portland\r\ncement.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Concrete?\r\n\r\nPortland cement is the strongest and most lasting of all modern mortars\r\nor binding materials. When mixed with sand and stone the resulting\r\nmixture is called concrete. Being a plastic material when first mixed,\r\nit cannot be used as we use brick or stone, but must be poured into\r\nmolds or forms, which hold it in place until it hardens into rock. It\r\nmay be cast in any form or shape, and thus it is useful for a vast\r\nnumber of purposes. It will harden under water, and time and exposure\r\nto the elements merely increase its strength. The most common form in\r\nwhich it is used, one familiar to everybody, is in the construction\r\nof sidewalks. It is used in all great engineering projects, such as\r\nthe building of dams, bridges, retaining walls, sewers, subways and\r\ntunnels. Being fireproof, large quantities of it are used in buildings\r\nand likewise on our farms, where it is extremely valuable as an\r\nenduring and sanitary material.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Cement Used For?\r\n\r\nIt has been said that concrete is a plastic material, meaning that\r\nit is soft and pliable in the sense that clay or putty are plastic.\r\nFor this reason it is cast in forms or molds. Sometimes it is used in\r\nthe form of plain concrete, and on other occasions it is reinforced,\r\nmeaning that iron rods, steel bars or woven wire mesh are imbedded\r\nin the concrete. When we speak of a “reinforced” concrete building,\r\nimagine a huge wire bird cage encrusted within and without with\r\nconcrete. Place a block, beam or column of concrete upon the ground and\r\nit will bear a tremendous load, meaning that it has great strength in\r\ncompression. On the other hand, if we were to place a long beam upon\r\nsupports at either end, leaving the greater length of it suspended and\r\nwithout support, it would carry but a small load compared with concrete\r\nin compression. Therefore, in making concrete beams or girders in a\r\nbuilding, strong steel bars are embedded in the concrete to take up\r\nwhat are termed the tensile strains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT A CEMENT MILL LOOKS LIKE\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of a cement mill. Millions of dollars are invested in\r\nthese great mills, which are now located in practically all sections of\r\nthe country. Material is brought from the quarry to the mills, where it\r\npasses through various stages, such as grinding, burning and bagging.\r\nExpert chemists are employed to see that the cement is made exactly\r\nright. It is a very scientific matter to make a thoroughly good cement.\r\nThere must be no guess work. Some mills are very large, the plant\r\ncomprising a number of buildings, and some companies operate several\r\nmills in different localities. A single company supplied all of the\r\ncement used in the Panama Canal, which great project required more than\r\nsix million barrels.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This picture shows a quarry in the famous Lehigh cement\r\ndistrict. The giant steam shovel or excavator burrows into the hill\r\nlike some great animal, and when the bucket is full it is dumped into\r\nthe cars shown on the track, which convey the rock or the raw material\r\nto the mill.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE THE MATERIAL IS OBTAINED\r\n\r\nThis is an illustration of a method of excavating and loading marl\r\nand clay to be manufactured into Portland cement. The large bucket\r\nsuspended over the cars does not gouge into the hillside as shown in\r\nthe preceding picture, but descends like a huge steel hand, the metal\r\nparts opening and closing like fingers. The long derrick elevates the\r\nbucket and swings it over the train of cars.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is a view of a powerful rock crusher, which is\r\noperated by the electric motor shown at the right. The cement rock is\r\nbrought from the quarry and dumped into the machine, from which it\r\nissues in broken fragments, as shown in the illustration, this being\r\nthe first or preliminary crushing process.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HUGE ROCK GRINDERS\r\n\r\nThis is a view of the electric motors operating the grinding machines\r\nwhich reduce the raw material to a very fine powder. There are various\r\ntypes of mills or grinders, to which the material comes after going\r\nthrough the rock crusher. They grind it in preparation for the kilns.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The kiln is a very important feature of the cement\r\nplant. The finely ground raw material must be calcined or burned before\r\nit becomes Portland cement. These kilns range from 60 to 240 feet in\r\nlength. They are slightly inclined and revolve upon rollers. The finely\r\nground material enters the kiln at the upper end and travels throughout\r\nits length as the kiln slowly revolves. Powdered coal dust is fed into\r\nthe kiln at the lower end, where it is ignited and generates intense\r\nheat. When the finely ground raw material comes into contact with the\r\nheat, which reaches 2800 degrees F., it is transformed into what is\r\nknown as clinker, which issues from the lower end of the kiln and is\r\npassed on to other machinery, which grinds it into impalpable powder or\r\nPortland cement.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW CONCRETE IS MIXED\r\n\r\nThis is an ingenious machine which bags and weighs the cement. The\r\nbags are suspended as shown, and when filled and weighed by the\r\nmachine are placed in barrels and shipped to their destination. Every\r\ndevice of this kind that will save time and labor cheapens the cost of\r\nmanufacture.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In mixing cement, sand and stone together in order that\r\nconcrete may be obtained, it is customary to use, if the operation\r\nis a large one, what are known as mechanical mixers. These are large\r\niron cylinders into which the three materials are put and water added.\r\nThe cylinder or iron drum revolves until the contents are thoroughly\r\nmixed, when they issue from the mixer through a chute or spout. A mixer\r\nof this type is shown on a succeeding page describing the making of a\r\nconcrete road. This picture shows mixing concrete by hand. The sand and\r\ncement are first thoroughly mixed in the dry state and subsequently the\r\nstone and water are added. Concrete should be thoroughly mixed in order\r\nthat every grain of sand may be entirely coated with cement, and then\r\nthese two combined make a rich mortar, which should surround entirely\r\nevery piece of stone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW CONCRETE BUILDINGS ARE MADE\r\n\r\nThis picture shows how concrete houses or walls are built through the\r\nuse of what are known as forms. In building a wall we have an inside\r\nand outside form, as shown in the picture, between which the concrete\r\nis placed. After it hardens the forms are removed. In some operations,\r\nsuch as the construction of a large factory building or great bridge,\r\nthere is such a vast array of timber construction as to make the scene\r\nquite impressive, especially when bridge arches of great span and\r\nheight are under construction.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is a view of an arch built of concrete during the\r\nJamestown Exposition. It is a striking illustration of how concrete\r\nmay be used for both ornamental and practical purposes. In no field\r\nhas concrete proved to be of more value and economy than in the\r\nconstruction of bridges, whether large or small. Some of the largest\r\nbridges in the world are built of concrete, and in many cases iron\r\nbridges are incased in concrete to keep them from rusting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONCRETE HOUSES CANNOT BURN\r\n\r\nThis is a curious example of concrete construction. It is a coal\r\npocket, from which locomotives are supplied with fuel. Railroad\r\ncompanies have adopted it because of its great strength and durability.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Just as mammoth structures are created with poured\r\nconcrete, so we may produce the most delicate and ornamental patterns.\r\nThese are usually cast in plaster molds and often in molds of wood or\r\niron. Where undercut work is required, such as in the sun-dial shown, a\r\nwood or metal mold could not be removed without injury to the concrete,\r\nand so sculptors have invented the pliable glue mold, which can be\r\neasily removed and which will spring back to its original shape if\r\nnecessary to use it a second time.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Concrete in dwelling construction means the elimination\r\nof fire danger and also cost of painting and repairs. This picture\r\nshows a solid concrete house, parts of which have been encrusted with\r\nbeautiful tiles. Concrete has been successfully used in all types of\r\ndwellings, from the humble abode of the workingman to the palace of\r\nthe multimillionaire. An entire house may be made of concrete, even to\r\nthe roof and stairways, and where a dwelling is constructed of this\r\nmaterial throughout, it is proof against fire and decay.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE FARMER USES CONCRETE\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting example of concrete construction. It is a\r\nlarge water tower which will never warp, rust or decay. In this field\r\nconcrete has been of great service, whether reservoirs are constructed\r\nin the form of towers or tanks. As already stated, water does not\r\naffect the life or strength of concrete, except to improve it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is a concrete silo. A silo made of concrete is\r\nmerely a huge stone jar in which green food for cattle is preserved.\r\nThe crop is gathered and placed in the silo, thus insuring abundance\r\nof green and wholesome food throughout dry seasons and during the\r\nwinter. The contents of the silo is known as silage or ensilage, and is\r\nmerely corn fodder cut when green. Concrete silos are both storm- and\r\nfire-proof.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It is usual to consider concrete in connection with\r\ngreat engineering enterprises, but nevertheless many millions of\r\nbarrels are used each year by the farmers of the United States. This\r\npicture shows a clean, sanitary and durable concrete stable. In\r\nbuildings of this character concrete is rapidly supplanting wood, which\r\nsoon goes to decay, to say nothing of accumulation of filth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW CONCRETE ROADS ARE BUILT\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL CEMENT MIXER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CONCRETE ROAD\r\n\r\nOur two last pictures relate to an exceedingly important and rapidly\r\nincreasing use of cement. It is the construction of concrete roads.\r\nThe first picture shows a concrete road in course of construction.\r\nThe mechanical mixer referred to above is shown in this picture. It\r\nis a self-propelling machine and mixes the concrete very rapidly. As\r\nit comes from the mixer in a wet and mushy mass it is placed between\r\nrigidly staked side forms, where it hardens into imperishable rock.\r\nThe road is brought to its shape by working to and fro a long plank\r\ncalled a template, after which the surface of the road is troweled with\r\nwooden floats, giving it a texture which prevents horses and cars from\r\nslipping. The last picture shows a narrow concrete road in the state of\r\nMaryland. Wherever these roads have been built they mean much to the\r\nwomen and children of the community. They never grind up into mud or\r\ndust, and are as pleasant to walk upon as the sidewalks of the city.\r\nChildren, especially, delight in them. In Wayne county, Mich., where\r\nthey have the most celebrated concrete roads in the world, the children\r\ngo to and from school on roller skates, and various games are played on\r\nthe concrete road.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Don’t We Make Roads Perfectly Level?\r\n\r\n\r\nRoads are made with a curving upper surface, i. e., higher in the\r\nmiddle, in order that the rain will drain away from the road into the\r\ngutters or ditches which you find at the sides. You see water has the\r\nfaculty of running only in one direction, and that is downward. If it\r\ncannot go down on one side or the other, it will collect in puddles\r\nand make the road impassable. For this reason we build our roads so\r\nthey are higher in the middle than at the sides--not much higher; only\r\nabout six inches or so--giving them just the gentle slope toward each\r\nside that is necessary to allow the water to run off gradually, but\r\nsufficiently sloping to keep the water from collecting in puddles in\r\nthe road. Thus after the dust has been settled by the first rain that\r\nfalls, most of the surplus rain that falls on the roads finally runs\r\ninto the ditches at the side of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Some Roads Called Turnpikes?\r\n\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the name turnpike as applied to some roads arose from the\r\nfact that pikes or gates were set across the roads by the keeper or\r\ntoll-collector. In addition to collecting tolls, it was a part of the\r\ntoll-keeper’s business to keep the road in repair. His wages and other\r\nexpenses for doing this were received from the tolls collected from the\r\npeople who used the road to ride on in carriages, wagons, etc. In the\r\nearly days the toll-collector was armed with a pike, a long-handled\r\nweapon with a sharp iron head, which he used to prevent people who\r\ntravelled his road from going by without giving up their toll. Later on\r\na swinging gate was built across the road, which made it unnecessary to\r\nuse the pike, though the name was retained, for no one could pass while\r\nthe gate barred the way. When the passerby had paid his tolls, the\r\ntoll-collector opened the gate and let him pass. If he did not pay the\r\ngate remained closed and the driver had to turn back or decide to pay.\r\nHence comes the name turnpike. In some parts of the country they call\r\nthese toll roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Dust?\r\n\r\n\r\nA large part of the dust we see in the roadway when the horses kick it\r\nup, or when an automobile passes, is made up of the pulverized dirt of\r\nthe roadway. It becomes mixed with other things, such as the street\r\ndeposits of animals, particles of carbon, etc. Particles of this dust\r\nget into our throats, and as there are many germs in it, they are very\r\nliable to cause sickness, especially the colds from which we suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Becomes of the Dust?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dust of the roadway is generally blown away by the wind, to come\r\ndown to earth again wherever the wind happens to carry it--on the\r\nlawns, the doorsteps or back to the road, perhaps. In any event, the\r\nrain which is certain to come sooner or later, washes this dust back\r\ninto the soil, or into the sewers. Part of it mixes with the soil. The\r\norganic matter in dust helps to fertilize the soil, and is therefore\r\nuseful. Other parts of the dust are oxidized and consumed by the\r\nair, through the heat of the sun. So you see the dust is continually\r\nchanging from one thing to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre Stones Alive?\r\n\r\n\r\nReal stones are not alive. They do not become stones until they have\r\nbeen burned out--until they have become what is known as dead matter.\r\nThis is meant entirely in the sense that we commonly think of the\r\nmeaning of the word “alive,” which is to be able to breathe and grow.\r\nStones can neither breathe nor grow. They belong to the inanimate\r\nkingdom of things on the earth. Particles of this dead matter, found in\r\nstones, etc., are in many cases taken up by things that are actually\r\nalive, and help to form the bodies of living things.\r\n\r\nThe most common thing to be found in rocks and stones is what is\r\ncalled “silicon,” and we find this silicon in the straws of the wheat,\r\noats and corn, and in many other things, but not in a way that can be\r\ndetected except by chemical analysis. A great many of the things found\r\nin stones are found in living things, but rocks and stones are not\r\nalive in any sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat and Why Is Smoke?\r\n\r\n\r\nSmoke is produced only when something which is being burned is burning\r\nimperfectly. If we were to put anything burnable into the fire and\r\nestablish just the right amount of draft, and knew how to build our\r\nfires properly, there would be no smoke and very little ashes.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the black coal smoke which we think of mostly when\r\nwe think of smoke at all, the black portion is principally little\r\nunburned particles of coal which pass up the chimney with the gases\r\nwhich are thrown off when the coal is being burned. These gases would\r\nbe invisible--they really are invisible--if it were not for the little\r\nparticles of coal which are drawn up the chimney with them. If you look\r\nat the chimney from which a wood fire expels the gases you find the\r\nsmoke very light in color--showing that not so much unburned matter is\r\nbeing thrown off. A charcoal fire makes no smoke, because the charcoal\r\nhas had the unburnable things taken out of it beforehand, and the\r\ncharcoal stove is almost perfect in construction from the standpoint of\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nOf course, the thickness of the smoke from a coal fire is often\r\nincreased by the fact that there are unburnable things mixed in with\r\nthe coal, some of which also pass off through the chimney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can’t We Burn Stones?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot burn anything that has already been burned, and a stone has\r\nalready been burned. To understand how this is we must first find out\r\nwhat takes place when a thing is burned. When a thing is burning it\r\nmeans merely that that particular thing is taking into its system all\r\nof the oxygen of the air that it can combine with. When it has done\r\nthis it cannot be burned any more. Of course, in doing this the thing\r\noriginally burned changes its character. The elements in a candle when\r\nlighted mix with the oxygen in the air and disappear in the form of\r\ngases. The elements in coal mix when fired with oxygen and change into\r\nashes, gases and smoke. A stone, however, is the result of a burning\r\nthat has already taken place. The original element of most of the rocks\r\nand stones we see was silicon, and when that combines with oxygen,\r\nthe result is some form of rock, which you may be able to break up or\r\nthrow, but which you cannot burn again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Fog?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fog which we generally think of when we speak this word is the\r\nfog at or on the sea or other body of water--the one that makes the\r\nships stand by and blow their fog horns. A fog of this kind is nothing\r\nmore nor less than a cloud, come right down to earth and spread out a\r\nlittle more. People who have gone up into the air in balloons and other\r\nairships through the clouds, say that the clouds are only fogs, and\r\nthat above them it is as clear as it is on a sunshiny day on the water\r\nwhen there is no fog.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of fog which settles down over the land,\r\nespecially in the cities. It is a damp mist which combines with the\r\nsmoke and other impurities in the air and forms a black and dirty cloud\r\nabout everything. This occurs when the upper air prevents the smoke\r\nwhich rises from a city with all its people and fires in the furnaces\r\nfrom passing up and away. The upper air acts like a blanket and keeps\r\nthe misty, smoky air down, until the wind comes along and blows it away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Becomes of the Smoke?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a number of things in smoke, and when we know what they are,\r\nwe will find a natural answer to this question. First, there are, of\r\ncourse, the little unburned particles of fuel which get carried up\r\nthe chimney by its drawing power. These naturally fall to the ground\r\nof their own weight, once they get beyond the drawing power of the\r\nchimney and out of the current of air so formed. Some of the gases\r\nare already quite burned out when they pass up the chimney. There is\r\na lot of carbonic acid gas which, of course, mixes with the air and\r\neventually becomes food for the plants. Then there are some gases which\r\nare not entirely burned, and the air burns them still more until they,\r\ntoo, become carbonic acid gas, or water which is also thrown off by a\r\nburning fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does an Apple Turn Brown When Cut?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason is that when you cut an apple, the exposure to the air of\r\nthe inside of the apple causes a chemical change to take place, due to\r\nthe effect the oxygen in the air has on what is scientifically known as\r\nthe enzymes in the apple, or what are commonly called the “ferments.”\r\nWhen the peel is unbroken it protects the inside of the apple against\r\nthis action by the oxygen. The brown color happens to be due to the\r\nchemical action. The action is similar to the action of the air on wet\r\nor damp iron or steel, in which case we call it rust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Piece of Wood Float in Water?\r\n\r\n\r\nA piece of wood will float in water because it is lighter than the\r\nsame amount of water. We do not mean that a piece of wood weighing one\r\npound, for instance, would weigh any more than a pound of water, of\r\ncourse, but if you took the measurements of each you will find that\r\nit took less bulk to make a pound of water than of wood. If you had a\r\npiece of wood so shaped that it just filled a glass completely, and\r\nthen took another glass and filled it with water, you would find that\r\nthe glass containing the water weighed the most. Another name to give\r\nto this difference would be to say that the water was more dense than\r\nthe wood. By the law of gravitation the denser thing will always go\r\nto the bottom, and as wood is less dense than water, it will stay at\r\nthe top if put in water. The piece of wood has more air in it than the\r\nwater. If you could expel the air from the piece of wood and then put\r\nit in water, it would sink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Iron Sink In Water?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe explanation in regard to the piece of wood floating in water is the\r\nbeginning of the answer to this question. A piece of iron is heavier\r\nthan an equal bulk of water, and will therefore go to the bottom, as\r\nwill all things which are more dense than water. A piece of iron has no\r\nair in it. The particles of a piece of iron are so close together that\r\nthere is no room for air in it and it will therefore sink in water. A\r\npiece of wood from which all of the air had been expelled would also\r\nsink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Doesn’t an Iron Ship Sink?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a very natural question for you to ask right after you were\r\ntold why iron sinks in water. The explanation is that by making an\r\niron ship in the way we do, we fix it so that it holds a lot of air in\r\nbetween the bottom and sides, making the combination of the two--the\r\niron ship and the air in it--lighter than the water on which it sails.\r\nMen thought at one time that a ship would sink if made of iron, and\r\ntherefore built all of their ships of wood. Finally one inventor made a\r\nship of iron and it was one of the wonders of the world. When we found\r\nthat iron ships would float if they were built to retain sufficient air\r\nto keep them from sinking, we made the hulls of most ships of iron for\r\na time. Now, however, the best ships are made of steel, which is even\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nIf you bore a hole in the bottom of a ship, the water will run in if\r\nthe ship is in the water, and the ship will sink, because the water\r\ncoming in drives out the air; and when the ship is full of water,\r\nthe water in it, with the ship itself, are heavier than the water on\r\nwhich it sails, and the ship will go down. Filling a ship with water\r\nmakes the iron part of the ship just like a bar of iron, so far as its\r\nsinking qualities are concerned.\r\n\r\nOf course, an iron ship must be made long enough and broad enough so\r\nthat when it is completed there will be sufficient air contained within\r\nthe hull to make the combination lighter than water. Always, therefore,\r\nwhen a ship is to be built, competent engineers must go over the plans\r\nof the vessel and calculate the air capacity, so as to make sure she\r\nwill float.\r\n\r\nNowadays it would be difficult to sink a modern vessel by boring one\r\nsmall hole in the bottom, because the bottom and sides are lined with\r\nenclosed steel air-chambers, and a ship will keep afloat even if one\r\nor a number of holes are made. The reason is, of course, that when you\r\nbore a hole into one of these air-chambers the water rushing in will\r\nfill that air-chamber with water, but as there is no connection from\r\nthe inside with the rest of the ship, the water can get no further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Poker Get Hot at Both Ends if Left in the Fire?\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth ends of the poker become heated because the poker is made of iron,\r\nand iron is a particularly good conductor of heat. To understand this\r\nwe must look into the question of what a good conductor of heat is.\r\nIn this case the particles of iron, which combined form the poker,\r\nare so close together that when those at the end of the poker which\r\nis in the fire get hot, the particles at that end hand the heat on to\r\nthe particles next to them, and so on until the whole poker is hot.\r\nThe difference between a thing which is a good conductor of heat and\r\na thing which is not a good conductor, lies in the ability of the\r\ndifferent particles which compose it to hand the heat on to the others.\r\nDid you ever notice that the handle of a solid silver spoon will\r\nbecome hot if the spoon is left in hot coffee? Solid silver is a good\r\nconductor of heat. A plated spoon is not a good conductor, however, and\r\nwill not become hot if left in the cup of hot coffee as a solid silver\r\nspoon will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould a Wooden Spoon Get Hot?\r\n\r\n\r\nA wooden spoon would not get hot, because wood is not a good conductor\r\nof heat. The atoms which compose the wood have not the power to\r\ntransmit the heat to each other. This is strange, too, when we think\r\nthat a poker is a good conductor of heat, but will not burn, while\r\nwood is not a good conductor, but will burn readily. Perhaps you have\r\nalready discovered this in connection with a wood fire. One end of a\r\nstick of wood may be burning fiercely, and yet you can pick it up by\r\nthe other end and find it is not even warm. This proves to you that\r\nwood is not a good conductor of heat, and explains why the handle of a\r\nwooden spoon in a bowl of hot soup will not get hot while the handle of\r\na silver spoon will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Iron Turn Red When Red Hot?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer is that the piece of iron has been heated to the point where\r\nit gives off light of its own. The red you see is only one stage in\r\nthe development of iron to the point where it makes its own light. If\r\nyou heat it still more it will make a white light. You know that it\r\nproduces the light itself, because if you take a piece of iron into a\r\nperfectly dark room and heat it to a white heat it will show better\r\nthan where there is other light. If you continue the process the iron\r\nwill melt and change in form. Therefore, the “red hot” name for a piece\r\nof iron in that state is a perfect name. It is a warning that the iron\r\nis coming to a point where if the heating process is continued, it will\r\nchange its form and in this state, when treated according to known\r\nmethods, the iron is turned into steel, which has many characteristics\r\nthat iron does not possess. Now, I can, of course, hear you ask why\r\ndoesn’t an iron kettle get red hot? and I can answer that easily. If\r\nyou treat the kettle the same way as you do the piece of iron, it\r\nwill get red hot. The difference is that you are thinking of an iron\r\nkettle with water in it. As long as there is any water in the kettle,\r\nthat keeps it from getting hot. The water inside keeps the kettle from\r\nbecoming red hot. If you took a hollow rod of iron and filled it with\r\nwater, it would not become red hot as long as any water remained in the\r\nhollow portion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did the Sand Get on the Seashore?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sand on the seashore is nothing more or less than ground-up\r\nsandstone. In dealing with the inanimate things in the world we find\r\nthat a very important element of all of them has been given the name\r\nsilicon. When the crust of the earth, which is the part we call the\r\nland and rocks, and includes the part under the sea, was a molten mass,\r\nthis silicon was burned, combining with the oxygen which surrounded\r\neverything, and produced what is known as silica. Silica is the name\r\ngiven to the thing which is left after you burn silicon. A very large\r\npart of this silica was deposited in parts of the earth, and when the\r\ncrust of the earth cooled off it was sand. By pressure and contact with\r\nother substances it became stuck together, just as you can take wet\r\nsand at the seashore to-day and make bricks and houses and tunnels,\r\nexcepting that in the case we speak of it was something besides water\r\nthat pressed and stuck the little particles of sand together. They\r\nstuck together more permanently. Then when the oceans were formed, as\r\nshown in another part of this book, much of the sandstone was found to\r\nbe at the bottom and on the shores of the oceans. The action of the\r\nwater continually washing against the sandstone gradually broke the\r\nsandstone up into the tiny particles of sand again, and this is what\r\nmakes the sand on the seashore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes a Soap Bubble?\r\n\r\n\r\nA bubble is merely a hollow ball of water with air inside. The air\r\nin coming up through the water in trying to rise out of the water is\r\ncaught in the water in such a way as to form the bubble, and since the\r\nability of the air inside of the bubble to rise is greater than that of\r\nthe water which forms the bubble, and which has a tendency to pull it\r\ndown, the bubble rises into the air. The water ball is very thin and\r\nkeeps running down to the bottom of the ball, where you see it form\r\ninto drops, and soon this makes the walls of the water bubble so thin\r\nthat the air bursts through the ball of water, and that is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Bubble Explode?\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes we blow soap bubbles. We mix soap in the water and that makes\r\nthe walls of the water ball which we produce a little tougher, and it\r\nrequires a great deal more effort for the air to escape from it, as the\r\nsoap keeps the water in the walls of the bubble from running down to\r\nthe bottom for quite some time, and, therefore, soap bubbles will often\r\ntravel in the air for some distance. The colors we see on soap bubbles\r\nare produced by the rays of sunlight, which strike the bubble and\r\nreflect them back to us in colors very similar to those of the rainbow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Bubbles Round?\r\n\r\n\r\nBubbles are round because the air which forms the inside of the bubble\r\nexerts an equal pressure in all directions. It presses equally against\r\nall sides of the bubble at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Yard of Silk\r\n\r\n\r\nGod’s Creation and Man’s Invention.\r\n\r\n~WHERE DOES SILK COME FROM?~\r\n\r\nSilk in its finished state is an ideal product. It is at once durable,\r\nmagnificent to the eye, tender to the touch, and its rustle is soft\r\nmusic to the ear. Hence it is easy to understand why the silkworm,\r\nfrom the earliest times, has been an object of much consideration and\r\nconcern from a commercial and industrial point of view. In this country\r\nalone, we annually expend as much for silk goods as we do for public\r\neducation and thirty times as much as we do for foreign missions. Such\r\nan indomitable producer of wealth is the silkworm, and a producer of\r\nwealth it has been from an age as remote as when Joseph was down in old\r\nEgypt, interpreting the dreams of King Pharaoh’s butler and baker and\r\nlater that of the King himself.\r\n\r\nTo-day we speak of twenty centuries, and our minds can hardly\r\ncomprehend such a lapse of time. What shall we think of the silkworm,\r\nthat for twice twenty centuries has furnished practically all the\r\nraw material for the world’s silk supply? Because man’s ingenuity is\r\nat present actively engaged in the attempt to displace it by cheaper\r\nsubstitutes, the thought has come to us that, without going too\r\nminutely into mechanical processes, a good opportunity is presented\r\nto give some interesting information in regard to the silkworm as\r\nthe creation of the Divine Hand, in contrast to the silkworm as the\r\ncreation of man.\r\n\r\nAccording to Chinese authority, the use of silk dates from 2650 B.C.,\r\nand it is generally conceded that, in point of age, it stands midway\r\namong the great textiles, wool and cotton having preceded it, while\r\nflax, hemp and other fibrous plants followed shortly in its train.\r\n\r\nThe first patron of the silkworm was Hoang-Ti, Third Emperor of China,\r\nand his Empress, Si-Ling-Chi, was the first practical silkworm breeder\r\nand silk reeler. It is related of her that she was once walking in the\r\npalace gardens when she discovered a strange and repulsive looking\r\nworm. It was small, of a pale green color, and was feeding greedily on\r\na mulberry leaf. She interested the Emperor in this strange creature,\r\nand, at the Emperor’s suggestion, took the fine silken web which the\r\nworm finally spun, and was the first to successfully reel the new\r\nfilament and weave it into cloth. So beneficial to the nation was her\r\nwork considered that her gratified subjects bestowed upon her the\r\ndivine title of “Goddess of the Silkworms,” and to this day the Chinese\r\ncelebrate in her honor the “Con-Con Feast,” which takes place during\r\nthe season in which the silkworm eggs are hatched.\r\n\r\nIn accounting for the presence of silkworms in the garden of this\r\nearly empress, we can rightly conclude that certain parts of China\r\nhave always abounded in forests of mulberry trees, and that the worms\r\nthemselves had existed in great numbers in a wild state and attached\r\ntheir cocoons to the trees for ages before any use was discovered\r\nfor their web. In fact, such wild silkworms not only abound in China\r\nto-day, but have also been found in Southern and Eastern Asia,\r\ninhabiting the jungles of India, Pegu, Siam and Cochin China, but the\r\ncocoons of these worms are, naturally, of a very inferior quality, and\r\nare only used for the crudest kind of work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Illustration by courtesy The Brainerd & Armstrong Silk Co.\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF SILK INTO EUROPE\r\n\r\nPilgrims brought silkworm eggs in their staffs, together with the\r\nbranches of mulberry trees, from China to the Court of Justinian at\r\nByzantine, A.D. 555. The penalty for taking silkworm eggs out of China\r\nwas death.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration is a reproduction of a mural painting\r\non rep in the Royal Textile Museum at Crefeld, Germany, one of the\r\ngreat silk textile centers of the world. The artist shows the pilgrims\r\npresenting the silkworm eggs and the mulberry branches to Justinian,\r\nbeside whom, just in the act of rising, is his famous queen Theodora.]\r\n\r\nSilk culture from the time of Hoang-Ti became one of the cherished\r\nsecrets of China. The headquarters of the industry was in the Province\r\nof Chen Tong, where was produced the silk for the royal family. In\r\ntime the silk and stuffs of China became articles of export to various\r\nportions of Asia. Long journeys were made by caravans, occupying\r\ntwo-thirds of a year in going from the cities of China to those of\r\nSyria, but the price obtained there exceeded the expense of the\r\njourney, and thus left a large margin of profit to the merchants. In\r\nthis manner, for one thousand years, the Chinese sent their silk to the\r\nPersians who, without knowing how or from what it was made, carried it\r\nto the Western nations.\r\n\r\nSo carefully did the Orientals guard their secret, that there is reason\r\nto believe that Aristotle was the first person in the occidental world\r\nto learn the true origin of the wrought silk from Persia. In commenting\r\non the silk which was brought from that country on the return of\r\nAlexander’s victorious army, he described the silkworm as a “horned\r\ninsect,” passing through several transformations, which produced\r\n“bomby-kia,” as he called the silk. But the classics must convince one\r\nthat Aristotle’s discovery did not at once become matter of current\r\nknowledge. In fact, for five hundred years after Aristotle’s time the\r\ncommon theory of the origin of silk among the Greeks and Romans was\r\nthat it was either “a fleece which grew upon a tree” (thus confounding\r\nit with cotton), or a fibre obtained from the inner bark of a tree; and\r\nsome, deceived by the glossy and silky fibres of the seed vessels of\r\nthe plant that corresponds to our milk or silk weed, believed it to be\r\nthe product of some plant or flower. So Virgil, in speaking of silk,\r\nsays, “the Seres comb the delicate fleecings from the leaves.”\r\n\r\nIn the Sixth Century, A.D., all the raw silk was still being imported\r\nfrom China by way of Persia, when the Emperor Justinian, having engaged\r\nin war with Persia, found his supply of raw silk cut off and the\r\nmanufacturers in great distress. His foolish legislation did not help\r\nthe situation, and a crisis was averted only by two Nestorian monks,\r\nwho came from China with seed of the mulberry tree and a knowledge\r\nof the Chinese method of rearing worms. No one, on pain of death,\r\nwas allowed to export the silkworm eggs from China, but Justinian\r\nbribed the monks to return to that country, and in 555 they came\r\nback, bringing with them a quantity of silkworm eggs concealed in\r\ntheir pilgrim’s staffs. And here let us say that there has only once\r\nsince been an important importation of eggs from Asia. That was about\r\n1860, when Dr. Pasteur was making a study of a germ disease which was\r\nthreatening the industry. Consequently, it can truly be said that\r\npractically all the silkworms of the Western world are descended from\r\nthose brought in the eggs by the monks to Constantinople. Justinian\r\ngave the control of the silk industry to his own treasurer. Weavers,\r\nbrought from Tyre and Berytus, were employed to manufacture the silk,\r\nand the whole production was a monopoly of the emperor, he fixing its\r\nprices. Under his management, the cost of silk became eight times as\r\ngreat as before, and the Royal Purple was twenty-four times its former\r\nprice. But this monopoly was not of long duration and, at the death of\r\nJustinian in 565, the monopoly ceased, and the spread of the industry\r\ncommenced in new and diverse directions.\r\n\r\nWhile every detail of the growth of the industry has an unusual\r\ninterest, as showing how such an insignificant thing as a worm may\r\nbecome a potent factor in Nature’s economy, the scope of this article\r\nwill hardly allow us to more than sketch some of the other more salient\r\npoints of the history of the silkworm.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 910, the silkworms made their appearance in Cordova,\r\nSpain, being brought there by the Moors. From Spain silk culture soon\r\nextended to Greece and Italy.\r\n\r\n~WHEN SILK CULTURE WAS INTRODUCED IN AMERICA~\r\n\r\nSilk was introduced on this continent through the Spanish Conquest of\r\nMexico, and the first silkworm eggs sold for $60.00 an ounce.\r\n\r\nA century later royal orders were issued requiring mulberry trees to\r\nbe planted in the Colony of Virginia, and a fine of twenty pounds of\r\ntobacco was imposed for neglect, and fifty pounds of tobacco was given\r\nas a bounty for every pound of reeled silk produced.\r\n\r\nSilk culture spread rapidly in the other Colonies, and to-day the story\r\nof the ineffectual attempts to profitably rear the silkworm in this\r\ncountry is as voluminous as it is interesting. Suffice it to say, as\r\na sop to our inherent Yankee pride, that silk culture was introduced\r\ninto Connecticut as early as 1737, the first coat and stockings made\r\nfrom New England silk being worn by Governor Law in 1747, and the first\r\nsilk dress by his daughter, in 1750. This State, for the eighty-four\r\nyears following, led all the others in the amount of raw silk produced.\r\nIn Connecticut also, was built the first silk mill to be erected on\r\nthis continent for the special purpose of manufacturing silk goods.\r\nThis building was constructed in 1810 by Rodney and Horatio Hanks, at\r\nMansfield, and is still standing as an heirloom which has come to us\r\nfrom the infant days of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe silkworm has become domesticated, since, during the long centuries\r\nin which it has been cultivated, it has acquired many useful\r\npeculiarities. Man has striven to increase its silk producing power,\r\nand in this he has succeeded, for, by comparing the cocoon of the\r\nsilkworm of to-day with its wild relations, the cocoon is found to be\r\nmuch larger, even in proportion to the size of the worm that makes\r\nit or the moth that issues from it. The moth’s loss of the power of\r\nflight and the white color of the species are probably the results of\r\ndomestication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPAN THE NATURAL HOME OF THE SILK WORM\r\n\r\nGATHERING MULBERRY BRANCHES.[1]\r\n\r\nThis picture shows a grove of mulberry trees from which branches\r\nare being gathered as food for the worms. This is often done by the\r\nchildren.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEMALE MOTHS DEPOSITING EGGS.[1]\r\n\r\nThe moths are placed upon pieces of cardboard, upon which they deposit\r\ntheir eggs.\r\n\r\nThe cards with the eggs are kept in a cool place until the season for\r\nhatching arrives.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING COCOONING BEDS.[1]\r\n\r\nThis picture shows two boys preparing a bed of twigs or branches upon\r\nwhich the worms may spin their cocoons.]\r\n\r\n  [1] Illustrations by courtesy The Brainerd & Armstrong Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE SILKWORMS ARE CARED FOR\r\n\r\nHATCHING THE EGGS.\r\n\r\nAs the eggs hatch on the cards, the young worms are removed to other\r\ncards or trays, where they are fed and cared for.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMOVING SILKWORMS FROM CARDS WHERE THEY WERE HATCHED.\r\n\r\nEvery few days the young worms are changed to new and clean cards.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METHOD OF REELING RAW SILK.\r\n\r\nThe cocoons are soaked in hot water in the basins shown in the front\r\nto loosen the gum. The silk threads then pass through the hands of the\r\noperators and are reeled on swifts in the cabinet shown in the rear.\r\n\r\nA more modern appliance for reeling the silk is shown on one of the\r\nfollowing pages.]\r\n\r\n  The foregoing pages and pictures by courtesy of Brainerd & Armstrong\r\n  Silk Company, from their book entitled, “Silk, the Real versus the\r\n  Imitation.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULL GROWN LARVA--SHOWING POSITION IN MOLTING.[2]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALE MOTH.[2]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEMALE MOTH.[2]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE VIEW OF CHRYSALIS.[2]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOTTOM VIEW OF CHRYSALIS.[2]]\r\n\r\n  [2] The cuts on this page and balance of cuts in the story of silk\r\n  copyright by the Corticelli Silk Mills.\r\n\r\nThe silk moth exists in four states--egg, larva, chrysalis, and adult.\r\nThe egg of the moth is nearly round, slightly flattened, and closely\r\nresembles a turnip seed. When first laid it is yellow, soon turning\r\na gray or slate color if impregnated. It has a small spot on one end\r\ncalled the micropyle, and when the worm hatches, which in our climate\r\nis about the first of June, it gnaws a hole through this spot. Black\r\nin color, scarcely an eighth of an inch in length, covered with long\r\nhair, with a shiny nose, and sixteen small legs, the baby worm is born,\r\nleaving the shell of the egg white and transparent.\r\n\r\n~THE SILKWORM—HOW HE DOES HIS WORK~\r\n\r\nSmall and tender leaves of the white mulberry or osage orange are fed\r\nthe young worm which simply pierces them and sucks the sap. Soon the\r\nworm becomes large enough to eat the tender portions between the veins\r\nof the leaf. In eating they hold the leaves by the six forward feet,\r\nand then cut off semi-circular slices from the leaf’s edge by the\r\nsharp upper portion of the mouth. The jaws move sidewise, and several\r\nthousand worms eating make a noise like falling rain.\r\n\r\nThe worms are kept on trays made of matting, that are placed on racks\r\nfor convenience in handling. The leaves are placed beside the worms,\r\nor upon a slatted or perforated tray placed above them, and those that\r\ncrawl off are retained, while the weak ones are removed with the old\r\nleaves. The worms breathe through spiracles, small holes which look\r\nlike black spots, one row of nine down each side of the body. They have\r\nno eyes, but are quite sensitive to a jar, and if you hit the rack\r\nthey stop eating and throw their heads to one side. They are velvety,\r\nsmooth, and cold to the touch, and the flesh is firm, almost hard. The\r\npulsation of the blood may be traced on the back of the worm, running\r\ntowards the head.\r\n\r\nThe worm has four molting seasons, at each of which it sheds its old\r\nskin for a new one, since in the very rapid growth of the worm the old\r\nskin cannot keep pace with the growth of the body. The periods between\r\nthese different molts are called “ages,” there being five, the first\r\nextending from the time of hatching to the end of the first molt, and\r\nthe last from the end of the fourth molt to the transformation of the\r\ninsect into a chrysalis. The time between the four “molts” will be\r\nfound to vary, depending upon the species of worm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE SILKWORMS ARE REARED.[2]]\r\n\r\nWhen the worm molts it ceases eating, grows slightly lighter in color,\r\nfastens itself firmly by the ten prolegs, and especially by the last\r\ntwo, to some object, and holding up its head and the fore part of its\r\nbody remains in a torpid state for nearly two days.\r\n\r\nBy each successive molt the worm grows lighter, finally becoming a\r\nslate or cream white color, and the hair, which was long at first,\r\ngradually disappears. The gummy liquid which combines the two strands\r\nhardens immediately on exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nThe worm works incessantly, forcing the silk out by the contraction\r\nof its body. The thin, gauze-like network which soon surrounds it\r\ngradually thickens, until, twenty-four hours after beginning to spin,\r\nthe worm is nearly hidden from view. However, the cocoon is not\r\ncompleted for about three days.\r\n\r\n~SIXTY-FIVE MOTIONS OF HIS HEAD A MINUTE~\r\n\r\nThe cocoon is tough, strong, and compact, composed of a firm,\r\ncontinuous thread, which is, however, not wound in concentric circles,\r\nbut irregularly in short figure eight loops, first in one place and\r\nthen in another. In doing this the worm makes sixty-five elliptical\r\nmotions of his head a minute or a total of 300,000 in an average\r\ncocoon. The motion of the worm’s head when starting the cocoon is very\r\nrapid, and nine to twelve inches of silk flow from the spinneret in\r\na minute, but later the average would be about half this amount per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILKWORM EATING.[2]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILKWORM—ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST WORKERS\r\n\r\nSILKWORM PREPARING TO FORM ITS COCOON.]\r\n\r\nHaving attained full growth, the worm is ready to spin its cocoon. It\r\nloses its appetite, shrinks nearly an inch in length, grows nearly\r\ntransparent, often acquiring a pinkish hue, becomes restless, seeks\r\na quiet place or corner, and moves its head from side to side in an\r\neffort to find objects on which to attach its guy lines within which\r\nto build its cocoon. The silk is elaborated in a semi-fluid condition\r\nin two long, convoluted vessels or glands between the prolegs and\r\nhead, one upon each side of the alimentary canal. As these vessels\r\napproach the head they grow more slender, and finally unite within the\r\nspinneret, a small double orifice below the mouth, from which the silk\r\nissues in a glutinous state and apparently in a single thread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOON BEGUN--SILKWORM CAN STILL BE SEEN.]\r\n\r\nThe color of the worm’s prolegs before spinning indicates the color the\r\ncocoon will be. This varies in different species, and may be a silvery\r\nwhite, cream, yellow, lemon, or green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETED COCOON.]\r\n\r\n~WHEN THE SILKWORM’S WORK IS DONE~\r\n\r\nWhen the worm has finished spinning, it is one and a quarter inches\r\nlong. Two days later, by a final molt, its dried-up skin breaks at the\r\nnose and is crowded back off the body, revealing the chrysalis, an oval\r\ncone one inch in length. It is a light yellow in color, and immediately\r\nafter molting is soft to the touch. The ten prolegs of the worm have\r\ndisappeared, the four wings of the future moth are folded over the\r\nbreast, together with the six legs and two feelers, or antennæ. It soon\r\nturns brown, and the skin hardens into a tough shell. Nature provides\r\nthe cocoon to protect the worm from the elements while it is being\r\ntransformed into a chrysalis, and thence into the moth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOTHS EMERGING FROM COCOONS.]\r\n\r\nWith no jaws, and confined within the narrow space of the cocoon, the\r\nmoth has some difficulty in escaping. After two or three weeks the\r\nshell of the chrysalis bursts, and the moth ejects against the end of\r\nthe cocoon a strongly alkaline liquid which moistens and dissolves\r\nthe hard, gummy lining. Pushing aside some of the silken threads and\r\nbreaking others, with crimped and damp wings the moth emerges; and the\r\nexit once effected, the wings soon expand and dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOONS FROM WHICH THE MOTHS HAVE EMERGED.]\r\n\r\nThe escape of the moth, however, breaks so many threads that the\r\ncocoons are ruined for reeling, and consequently, when ten days old,\r\nall those not intended for seed are placed in a steam heater to stifle\r\nthe chrysalis, and the silk may then be reeled at any future time.\r\n\r\nThe moths are cream white in color. They have no mouths, but do have\r\neyes, which is just the reverse of the case of the worm. From the time\r\nit begins to spin until the moth dies, the insect takes no nourishment.\r\nThe six forward legs of the worm become the legs of the moth. Soon\r\nafter mating the eggs are laid.\r\n\r\nThe male has broader feelers than the female, is smaller in size, and\r\nquite active. The female lays half her eggs, rests a few hours, and\r\nthen lays the remainder. Her two or three days’ life is spent within a\r\nspace occupying less than six inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nOne moth lays from three to four hundred eggs, depositing them over an\r\neven surface. In some species a gummy liquid sticks the eggs to the\r\nobject upon which they are laid. In the large cocoon varieties there\r\nare full thirty thousand eggs in a single ounce avoirdupois. It takes\r\nfrom twenty-five hundred to three thousand cocoons to make a pound of\r\nreeled silk. Do you wonder that, centuries ago, silk was valued at its\r\nweight in gold?\r\n\r\nGrowers of silk in the United States, by working early and late every\r\nday during the season, which lasts from six to eight weeks, could\r\nscarcely average fifteen cents for a day’s labor of ten hours. Silk,\r\nonce regarded as a luxury, is now considered a necessity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE COCOON IS UNWOUND\r\n\r\nREELING THE SILK FROM COCOONS BY FOOT POWER, CALLED “RE-REEL” SILK.\r\n\r\nThe cocoons are first assorted, those of the same color being placed\r\nby themselves, and those of fine and coarse texture likewise. The\r\noutside loose silk is then removed, as this cannot be reeled, after\r\nwhich the cocoons are plunged into warm water to soften the “gum” which\r\nsticks the threads together. The operator brushes the cocoons with a\r\nsmall broom, to the straws of which their fibers become attached, and\r\nthen carefully unwinds the loose silk until each cocoon shows but one\r\nthread. These three operations are called “soaking,” “brushing,” and\r\n“cleansing.”\r\n\r\nInto one or two compartments in a basin of warm water below the reel\r\nare placed four or more cocoons, according to the size of the thread\r\ndesired. The threads from the cocoons in each compartment are gathered\r\ntogether and, after passing through two separate perforated agates a\r\nfew inches above the surface of the water, are brought together and\r\ntwisted around each other several times, then separated and passed\r\nupward over the traverse guide-eyes to the reel. The traverse moves\r\nto and fro horizontally, distributing the thread in a broad band over\r\nthe surface of the reel. The rapid crossing of the thread from side to\r\nside of the skein in reeling facilitates handling and unwinding without\r\ntangling, the natural gum of the silk sticking the threads to each\r\nother on the arms of the reel, thus securing the traverse. Silk reeled\r\nby hand or foot power is known as “Re-reel” silk, while silk reeled by\r\npower machinery is called “Filature.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FILATURE--REELING THE SILK FROM COCOONS BY POWER\r\nMACHINERY.[2]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING SKEINS OF SILK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SILK IS WOUND ON SPOOLS\r\n\r\nWINDING FRAMES--WINDING THE SILK ON BOBBINS.]\r\n\r\n~WHERE MAN’S WORK ON THE SILK BEGINS~\r\n\r\nThe raw silk is first assorted, according to the size of the fiber, as\r\nfine, medium, and coarse. The skeins are put into canvas bags and then\r\nsoaked over night in warm soapsuds. This is necessary to soften the\r\nnatural gum in the silk, which had stuck the threads together on the\r\narms of the reel. Following the soaking, the skeins are straightened\r\nout and hung across poles in a steam-heated room, as shown in the\r\naccompanying photograph. When the skeins are dry, they are ready for\r\nthe first process of manufacturing. The room we now step into is filled\r\nwith “winding frames,” each containing two long rows of “swifts,”\r\nfrom which the silk is wound on to bobbins. The bobbins are large\r\nspools about three inches long. The bobbins filled with silk, as wound\r\nfrom the skeins, are next placed on pins of the “doubling frames”;\r\nthe thread from several bobbins, according to the size of the silk\r\ndesired, is passed upward through drop wires on to another bobbin.\r\nShould one of the threads break, the “drop wire” falls, which action\r\nstops the bobbin. By this ingenious device absolute uniformity in the\r\nsize of silk is secured. The “doubling frame” is shown in one of the\r\nphotographs herewith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLING FRAMES--THE SILK THREAD IS MADE UNIFORM.]\r\n\r\nThe bobbins taken from the “doubling frame” are next placed on a\r\n“spinner.” Driven by an endless belt at the rate of over six thousand\r\nturns a minute, the bobbins revolve, the silk from them being drawn\r\nupward on to another bobbin. This spins the several strands brought\r\ntogether by the “doubling process” into one thread, the number of turns\r\ndepending on the kind of silk--Filo silk being spun quite slack, and\r\nMachine Twist just the reverse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINNING SILK.[2]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWISTING SILK.[2]]\r\n\r\nA transferring machine combines two or three of these strands; two for\r\nsewing silk and three for machine twist; and the bobbin next goes on\r\nto the “twisting machine”--a machine that is similar to a “spinner,”\r\nbut the silk is twisted in the opposite direction from the spinning. To\r\nstand before these machines and watch how rapidly and how accurately\r\nthey do the work assigned them is a revelation. No one realizes how\r\nnicely the parts are adjusted. If but one tiny strand breaks that\r\npart of the machinery is stopped by an automatic device which works\r\ninstantaneously. After twisting, the silk is stretched by an ingenious\r\nmachine called a “water-stretcher.” This smooths and consolidates the\r\nconstituent fibers, giving an evenness to the silk not to be obtained\r\nby any other known process. The bobbins are placed in water and the\r\nsilk is wound on to the lower of the two copper rolls. From the lower\r\nroll it passes upward to the upper roll, which turns faster than the\r\nlower one, thereby stretching the silk. From the upper roll it passes\r\nagain on to a bobbin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILK THREADS READY FOR THE WEAVER\r\n\r\nWATER STRETCHER--MAKING THE SILK THREAD SMOOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe dyeing process is a very important one, and upon its success\r\ndepends the permanency of the various colors.\r\n\r\nVast tubs, tanks, and kettles surround you on every side, and the\r\nhissing steam seems to spring from all quarters. The “gum” of the silk\r\nis first boiled out by immersion in strong soapsuds for about four\r\nhours. The attendants, standing in heavy “clogs” (big shoes with wooden\r\nsoles two inches thick), turn the silk on the sticks at intervals\r\nuntil the gum is removed. After the silk is dyed it is put into a\r\n“steam finisher,” a device looking like a long, narrow box with a\r\ncover opening on the side, set upright on top of an iron cylinder. The\r\nhanks of silk are placed upon two pins in the steam chest, the cover\r\nfastened, and the live steam rushes in around the silk. This brightens\r\nthe silk, giving it the lustrous, glossy appearance.\r\n\r\n  The editors are indebted to the Corticelli Silk Mills, Florence,\r\n  Mass., for this story of how silk is made, as well as for permission\r\n  to use their splendid life-like copyrighted photographs of the\r\n  silkworm. Many teachers will be glad to know that they can obtain\r\n  from the Corticelli Silk Mills, at slight expense, specimen cocoons\r\n  and other helps for object lesson teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Animal Can Leap the Greatest Distance?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe galago, or flying lemur. This singular animal is a native of\r\nthe Indian Archipelago. It is from 2 ft. to 3 ft. in length, and is\r\nfurnished with a sort of membrane on each side of its body connecting\r\nits limbs with each other; this is extended and acts as a parachute\r\nwhile taking its long leaps, which measure about 300 ft. in an inclined\r\nplane. The kangaroo can leap with ease a distance of between 60 ft. and\r\n70 ft. and can spring clean over a horse and take fences from 12 ft. to\r\n14 ft. in height. The animals that can leap the greatest distance in\r\nproportion to their size are the flea and the grasshopper, the former\r\nbeing able to leap over an obstacle five hundred times its own height,\r\nwhile the grasshopper can leap for a distance measuring 200 times its\r\nown length. The springbok will clear from 30 ft. to 40 ft. at a single\r\nbound. The flying squirrel, in leaping from tree to tree often clears\r\n50 ft. in a leap. This animal also has a broad fold of skin or membrane\r\nconnecting its fore and hind legs. A steeplechase horse, called The\r\nChandler, is reported to have covered 39 ft. in a single leap at\r\nWarwick some years ago. Some species of antelopes can make a leap 36\r\nft. in length and 10 ft. in height. A lion and a tiger each clear from\r\n18 ft. to over 20 ft. at a bound while springing on their prey. A\r\nsalmon often leaps 15 ft. out of the water in ascending the falls of\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Call Voting Balloting?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term covers all forms of secret voting, as in early times such\r\nvotes were determined by balls of different colors deposited in the\r\nsame box, or balls of one color placed in various boxes. The Greeks\r\nused shells (ostrakon), whence we derive the term ostracism. In 139\r\nB.C. the Romans voted by tickets. The ballot was first used in America\r\nin 1629, when the Salem Church thus chose a pastor. It was employed in\r\nthe Netherlands in the same year, but was not established in England\r\nuntil 1872, although in Scotland it was used in cases of ostracism in\r\nthe 17th century. In 1634 the governor of Massachusetts was elected by\r\nballot, and the constitutions of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and North\r\nCarolina adopted in 1776, made this method of voting obligatory. The\r\nballot progressed slowly in the Southern States, Kentucky retaining the\r\nviva voce method until a comparatively recent date. In certain states,\r\nthe constitutions stipulate that the legislature shall vote viva voce,\r\ni. e., cast their votes orally. Since 1875 all congressmen have been\r\nelected by ballot. In 1888 the Australian ballot system, which requires\r\nthe names of all the candidates for the various offices to be placed\r\non one large sheet of paper, commonly known as a “blanket” ticket, was\r\nadopted in Louisville, Ky., and some sections of Massachusetts. It is\r\nnow in very general use in this country. The voter, in the privacy of\r\nan individual booth, indicates his preference by making a mark opposite\r\na party emblem or a candidate’s name. This system originated in 1851\r\nwith Francis S. Dutton, of South Australia, and Henry George, in a\r\npamphlet, “English Elections,” published in 1882, was the first to\r\nadvocate it in the United States. The first bill enacting it into a law\r\nhere was introduced in the Michigan legislature in 1887, but it did not\r\npass until 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Call a Cab a Hansom?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term is applied usually to a public vehicle, known in England as\r\na “two-wheeler,” or “Hansom” (from the name of the inventor), and\r\ndrawn by one horse. In a hansom cab, the passenger or hirer of the\r\nvehicle sits immediately in rear of the dashboard, the driver sitting\r\non an elevated perch behind, the reins being passed over the top. The\r\nterm cab is sometimes also applied to a four-seated, closed or open\r\ncarriage, drawn by one or two horses, the driver sitting in front. The\r\nterm is also applied to the covered part of a locomotive, in which the\r\nengineer and fireman have their stations. The word cab is derived from\r\nthe cabriolet, a light one-horse carriage, with two seats and a calash\r\ntop. In London, England, the cab or hansom was called the “gondola” of\r\nthe British metropolis by Disraeli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Did the Name Calico Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nA fabric of cotton cloth, the name being derived from the city of\r\nCalicut, in Madras, where it was first manufactured, and in 1631\r\nbrought to England by the East India Company. Calico-printing, an\r\nancient Indian and Chinese art, has become a great industry in this\r\ncountry and in Britain, as well as in Holland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Made the First Postage Stamp?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stick on postage stamps so generally used today was invented by\r\nan Englishman James Chalmers in 1834. The English Government passed a\r\nbill calling for uniform postage of One Penny in 1840 and furnished\r\nenvelopes bearing stamps printed on them. The people did not like them,\r\nhowever, and the adhesive stamp invented by Chalmers was substituted.\r\nThe first stamps used in America were introduced in 1847. People have,\r\nit seems, always preferred to lick their postage stamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many Languages Are There?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that there are more than 3,400 languages, including\r\ndialects, in the world. Most of them belong, of course, to savage\r\nor uncivilized people. There are said to be more than 900 languages\r\nused in Asia, almost 600 in Europe, 275 in Africa and more than 1,600\r\nlanguages and dialects which are American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Deepest Mine In the World?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mine that goes farther down than any other in the world is the rock\r\nsalt mine near Berlin, Germany which is 4,175 feet. It is not, however,\r\nstraight down but somewhat slanting. The Calumet Copper Mine near Lake\r\nSuperior is at a depth in some places of 3,900 feet.\r\n\r\nThe deepest boring in the world is an artesian well at Potsdam,\r\nMissouri, which is 5,500 feet deep or more than one mile straight down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Color?\r\n\r\n\r\n~WHAT PRODUCES THE COLORS WE SEE?~\r\n\r\nWhat is termed the color-sense is the power or ability to distinguish\r\nkinds or varieties of light and their distinctive tints. We owe the\r\nfaculty of doing this to the structure of the eye and its elaborate\r\nconnecting nerve machinery. The eye in man is specially sensitive to\r\nlight, and the sensations we feel through it enables us to distinguish\r\nthe different colors. Over 1,000 monochromatic tints are said to\r\nbe distinguishable by the retina of the eye, though these numerous\r\ntints are, in the main, merely blendings or combinations of the three\r\nprimary color-sensations, the sense of red, of green and of violet.\r\nEach of these colors, it has been demonstrated, is produced by light\r\nof a varying wave length, while white light is only light in which the\r\nprimary colors are combined in proper proportion. Colored light, on the\r\nother hand, as Newton proved, may be produced from white light in one\r\nof three ways: First, by refraction in a prism or lens, as observed in\r\nthe rainbow; second, by diffraction, as in the blue color of the sky,\r\nor in the tints seen in mother-of-pearl; and third, by absorption,\r\nas in the red color of a brick wall, or in the green of grass--the\r\nwhite light which falls upon the wall being wholly absorbed, save by\r\nthe red, and all that falls upon the grass being absorbed except the\r\ngreen. In art, color means that combination or modification of tints\r\nwhich is specially suited to produce a particular or desired effect in\r\npainting; in music, the term denotes a particular interpretation which\r\nillustrates the physical analogy between sound and color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Did the Term Dixie Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term was applied originally to New York City when slavery existed\r\nthere. According to a myth or legend, a person named Dixie owned a\r\ntract of land on Manhattan Island and had a large number of slaves. As\r\nDixie’s slaves increased beyond the requirements of the plantation,\r\nmany were sent to distant parts. Naturally the deported negroes looked\r\nupon their early home as a place of real and abiding happiness, as did\r\nthose from the “Ole Virginny” of later days. Hence “Dixie” became the\r\nsynonym for a locality where the negroes were happy and contented. In\r\nthe South, Dixie is taken to mean the Southern States. There the word\r\nis supposed to have been derived from Mason and Dixon’s line, formerly\r\ndividing the free states from the slave states. It is said to have\r\nfirst come into use there when Texas joined the Union, and the negroes\r\nsang of it as Dixie. It has been the theme of several popular songs,\r\nnotably that of Albert Pike, “Southrons, Hear Your Country Call”; that\r\nof T. M. Cooley, “Away Down South where Grows the Cotton,” and that\r\nof Dan Emmett, the refrain usually containing the word “Dixie” or the\r\nwords “Dixie’s Land.” During the Civil War, the tune of “Dixie” was to\r\nthe Southern people what “Yankee Doodle” had always been to the people\r\nof the whole Union and what it continued, in war times, to be to the\r\nNorthern people, the comic national air. The tune is “catchy” to the\r\npopular ear and it was played by the bands in the Union army during\r\nthe war as freely as by those on the other side. During the rejoicing\r\nin Washington over the surrender of Lee at Appomattox, a band played\r\n“Dixie” in front of the White House. President Lincoln began a short\r\nspeech, immediately afterward, with the remark, “That tune fairly\r\nbelongs to us now; we’ve captured it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Big Is the Earth?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third planet in order of distance from the sun, Mercury and Venus\r\nbeing nearer to it. It is in shape a sphere slightly flattened at the\r\npoles and bulged at the equator, hence it is called an oblate spheroid.\r\nThe equatorial diameter or axis measures 7,926 miles and 1.041 yds.,\r\nand the polar diameter is 7,899 miles and 1.023 yds. The earth revolves\r\nupon its axis, completing its diurnal or daily revolution in a sidereal\r\nday, which is 3 minutes and 55.9 seconds shorter than a mean solar day.\r\nIt revolves around the sun in one sidereal year, which is 365 days, 6\r\nhours, 9 minutes, and 9 seconds. Its orbit or path around the sun is an\r\nellipse, having the sun in one of the foci. The earth’s mean distance\r\nfrom the sun is 93,000,000 miles. Its axis is inclined to the plane\r\nof its orbit at an angle of 23° 27′ 12.68″. The circumference at the\r\nequator measures 24,899 miles. The total surface is 196,900,278 sq.\r\nmiles, and the solid contents is 260,000,000,000 cubic miles. As we\r\ndescend into the earth the temperature rises at the rate of 1° Fahr.\r\nfor every 50 ft. At the depth of 10 or 12 miles the earth is red-hot,\r\nand at a depth of 100 miles the temperature is such that at the surface\r\nof the earth it would liquefy all solid matter in the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes Hail?\r\n\r\n\r\nHail is the name given to the small masses of ice which fall in\r\nshowers, and which are called hailstones. When a hailstone is examined\r\nit is found usually to consist of a central nucleus of compact snow,\r\nsurrounded by successive layers of ice and snow. Hail falls chiefly in\r\nSpring and Summer, and often accompanies a thunderstorm. Hailstones\r\nare formed by the gradual rise and fall, through different degrees of\r\ntemperature (by the action of windstorms), and they then take on a\r\ncovering of ice or frozen snow, according as they are carried through a\r\nregion of rain or snow.\r\n\r\nWith regard to rain, it may be said, in popular language, that under\r\nthe influence of solar heat, water is constantly rising into the air by\r\nevaporation from the surface of the sea, lakes, rivers, and the moist\r\nsurface of the ground. Of the vapors thus formed the greater part is\r\nreturned to the earth as rain. The moisture, originally invisible,\r\nfirst makes its appearance as cloud, mist or fog; and under certain\r\natmospheric conditions the condensation proceeds still further until\r\nthe moisture falls to the earth as rain. Simply and briefly, then, rain\r\nis caused by the cooling of the air charged with moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Human Being Have To Learn to Swim?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is strange, isn’t it, that almost every animal, excepting man and\r\npossibly the monkey, knows how to swim naturally; others such as birds,\r\nhorses, dogs, cows, elephants, can swim as soon as they can move about\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with man in this connection is that his natural motion is\r\nclimbing. He has been a climber ever since he was developed from the\r\nmonkey, and when you throw him into the water before he has learned to\r\nswim, he naturally starts to climb and as a climbing motion won’t do,\r\nfor swimming, the man will drown.\r\n\r\nThis climbing motion is as much of an instinct in man and monkeys as\r\nthe instinct in dogs which causes him to turn round once or twice\r\nbefore he lies down just as his forefathers used to do ages ago when,\r\nas wild dogs, they first had to trample the grass before they could lie\r\ndown comfortably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do I Get Cold in a Warm Room?\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose you mean the instances when you get cold while in a warm room\r\neven when you are perfectly well. This will happen often when all of\r\nthe moisture in the room outside of what is in your body, is evaporated\r\nby the heat in the room. The remedy is, of course, to keep a pan of\r\nwater some place in the room as the air has become too dry.\r\n\r\nWhile heat is necessary to evaporate water, the process of evaporation\r\nproduces cold. The quicker the evaporation the sharper the cold feeling\r\nproduced. Now your body is continually evaporating the water from your\r\nbody which comes out in the form of perspiration through the pores of\r\nthe skin. This is one of nature’s ways of taking the impurities and\r\nwaste out of the body. You know, of course, don’t you, that more than\r\none-half the waste material which the body expels from the system comes\r\nout through the pores of the skin rather than through the canals.\r\n\r\nWhen the air in the room becomes too dry, the evaporation on the\r\noutside of the body proceeds faster and makes you cold. By keeping\r\nwater in some vessel in the room you keep the air of the room from\r\nbecoming too dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do They Call Them Wisdom Teeth?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wisdom teeth are the two last molar teeth to grow. They come one\r\non each side of the jaw and arrive somewhere between the ages of\r\ntwenty and twenty-five years. The name is given them because it is\r\nsupposed that when a person has developed physically and mentally to\r\nthe point where he has secured these last two teeth he has also arrived\r\nat the age of discretion. It does not necessarily mean that one who\r\nhas cut his wisdom teeth is wise, but that having lived long enough\r\nto grow these, which complete the full set of teeth, the person has\r\npassed sufficient actual years that, if he has done what he should to\r\nfit himself for life, he should have come by that time at the age of\r\ndiscretion or wisdom. As a matter of fact these teeth grow at about the\r\nsame age in people whether they are wise or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Freckles Come?\r\n\r\n\r\nFreckles are generally caused by the exposure of unprotected parts of\r\nthe body to the sun, but this will not cause freckles on all people.\r\nOnly people with certain kinds of sensitive skins freckle. What happens\r\nwhen freckles are produced in this way is this: The sunlight shining on\r\nthe face, neck or arms of anyone who has a tendency to freckle, has a\r\npeculiar action on certain cells of the skin which produces a yellowish\r\nbrown coloring pigment, which remains for a time.\r\n\r\nThen again the skins of some people are so peculiarly sensitive the\r\ncells develop this kind of coloring matter in almost any kind of light\r\nand such people are, so to speak, apt to be freckled for life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First successful power-driven aeroplane. The Langley\r\nmonoplane with steam engine, which flew over the Potomac River in 1896.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flying Boat\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Did Man First Try to Fly?\r\n\r\n~HOW MAN LEARNED TO FLY~\r\n\r\nMan’s desire to conquer the air is older than recorded history. When a\r\nkite was flown for the first time the principle of aviation, or dynamic\r\nflight, was uncovered. For centuries man has sought the mechanical\r\nequivalents for the things that keep a kite flying steadily in the\r\nair,--the power that lies in the cord that keeps a kite headed into the\r\nwind; an equivalent for the wind’s own power; an equivalent for the\r\ntail which controls the kite’s lateral and longitudinal balance.\r\n\r\nEach separate part of the modern flying machine, or aeroplane, was\r\nworked out long ago, with the exception of the gas engine light enough\r\nand reliable enough to be used for this work. The present generation\r\nknows dynamic flight as a commonplace thing, not because we are so much\r\nmore clever than previous generations in designing flying machines,\r\nbut because of the development of the modern gasoline or internal\r\ncombustion engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Invented Flying?\r\n\r\nNo one invented flying, nor did any one man invent all the separate\r\nparts of the flying machine. They are the result of evolution,--of the\r\ncombined work and thought of hundreds of men, many of whose names are\r\nunrecorded. To attempt to find the true beginning of the modern flying\r\nmachine would be as difficult as attempting to discover who planted\r\nthe seed of the tree from which one has gathered a rose. But the tree\r\nfrom which all the flying machines, or aeroplanes, of today have sprung\r\nundoubtedly is Dr. Samuel Pierpont Langley, third secretary of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the Men Who Helped.\r\n\r\nTaking the most conspicuous names of scientists who worked out various\r\ndetails of the aeroplane during the past century we find that a century\r\nago Sir George Cayley built a machine on lines very similar to those\r\naccepted today, and he went so far as to foretell the necessity of\r\ndeveloping the internal combustion engine before dynamic flight could\r\nbe a success. Mr. F. H. Wenham, in 1866, also built a flying machine\r\nalong conventional lines and tried to fly it with a steam engine, which\r\nof course, proved too heavy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of Dr. Langley’s first models; a biplane with\r\nflexible wing-tips and twin propellers. 1889.]\r\n\r\n~EARLY TYPES OF FLYING MACHINES~\r\n\r\nM. A. Penaud, a Frenchman, in experimenting with models, seems to have\r\nbeen the first to discover the necessity of vertical and horizontal\r\nrudders in maintaining balance. Mr. Horatio Phillips, an Englishman,\r\ndiscovered, and patented, the use of curved instead of flat surfaces\r\nfor the planes. Otto and Gustav Lilienthal are said to have been the\r\nfirst to attempt to balance aeroplanes by flexing or bending the wings.\r\nVarious others, including Messrs. Richard Harte, Boulton, Mouillard,\r\nworked out ideas for balancing machines by the use of auxiliary planes\r\nwhich could be set at different angles with regard to the line of\r\nflight, thus forcing the machines to different positions by the force\r\nof the air rushing against them.\r\n\r\nDr. Langley, trained in scientific investigation, conducted an\r\nelaborate series of experiments covering many years and costing\r\nthousands of dollars to test and prove the value of the claims of\r\nthe earlier investigators. Some things which he thought he was\r\nthe first to discover,--such as the effect of the vertical and\r\nhorizontal rudders,--he later found had already been proven by others.\r\nIndependently he covered the entire field of experiment and after\r\nbuilding hundreds of small models he succeeded, in 1896, in making a\r\nmachine weighing several pounds equipped with a very light steam engine\r\nwhich flew safely as long as the fuel lasted. For his early experiments\r\nDr. Langley was afforded financial assistance by Mr. William Thaw of\r\nPittsburg. After the success of his small machines Dr. Langley was\r\nasked to undertake the construction of a large, man-carrying machine,\r\nand Congress voted him $50,000 to carry on the work. A large share of\r\nthis was spent on the development of a very light gasoline engine. The\r\nmachine finally was completed, but was twice broken through defective\r\nlaunching apparatus. Congress and Dr. Langley were so ridiculed by the\r\npublic press that the machine was temporarily abandoned. Not, however,\r\nuntil after Dr. Langley had successfully flown a steam driven machine\r\nmuch larger than many of the racing aeroplanes of today.\r\n\r\nBut eight years after Dr. Langley’s death, which is said to have been\r\ndue to the heart-breaking disappointment he suffered in trying to\r\ndemonstrate the large machine, Glenn H. Curtiss, at the request of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, rebuilt the old Langley machine and succeeded\r\nin making a flight with it at Hammondsport, N. Y., on May 28, 1914.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST MAN-CARRYING AEROPLANE\r\n\r\nFirst successful man-carrying aeroplane. Designed by Dr. Langley in\r\n1898; flown by Glenn H. Curtiss at Hammondsport, N. Y., 1914.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Front view of big Langley machine in 1914.]\r\n\r\nWhile longer flights probably will be made with this machine none\r\nwill attain greater importance, because this first flight with it was\r\nsufficient to establish for all time the fact that Dr. Langley built\r\nthe first man-carrying machine equipped with a gasoline engine and able\r\nto fly and raise itself with its own power. This was considerably\r\nmore than was accomplished by other machines for some time after Dr.\r\nLangley’s death. The Langley machine not only lifted the weight it was\r\ndesigned to fly with, but also carried pontoon and other fittings,\r\nadded by Mr. Curtiss to make flight from the water possible, which\r\nadded 340 pounds to the original weight of the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MACHINE WITH WHICH BLERIOT FLEW IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nCopy of early Langley model with which Bleriot made first circular\r\nflight in Europe.]\r\n\r\nThe connection between Dr. Langley’s work and present machines is now\r\nvery easy to trace, though not obvious until 1911, when the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution published memoirs written by Dr. Langley in 1897, and\r\nsome memoirs of Mr. Octave Chanute, a French engineer who resided in\r\nChicago, and who forms one of the main connecting links. The chain\r\nis practically completed by notes left by the late Lieut. Thomas\r\nSelfridge, U. S. A., America’s first martyr to aviation.\r\n\r\nDr. Langley’s knowledge is represented in modern aviation by three\r\ndistinct lines. The central and most direct line is through Dr.\r\nAlexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, to the Aerial\r\nExperiment Association, and thence to Mr. Glenn H. Curtiss, and finds\r\nits expression in what is known as the Curtiss type of machines.\r\n\r\nAnother line is that carried by a Mr. A. M. Herring to Mr. Chanute and\r\nby him transmitted to Mr. Wilbur Wright, finding expression in the\r\nWright type of biplane.\r\n\r\nThe third line is that leading to the modern monoplane school; M.\r\nBleriot having first copied in toto the tandem monoplane form,\r\ngenerally known as the Langley type, and later, with the development of\r\nbetter gasoline engines, developing into the monoplane as known today.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of M. Bleriot it is doubtful if the others fully\r\nrealized the source of their inspiration,--not to call it information.\r\n\r\nDr. Bell was interested in Dr. Langley’s work for more than ten years\r\nbefore Dr. Langley gave up. He observed many of the trials, and his\r\nreports of the first successful flights are incorporated in the\r\nofficial publications of the Smithsonian Institution. Dr. Bell began\r\nsome independent experiments, but following Dr. Langley’s death he\r\nformed the Aerial Experiment Association, to carry on the work left by\r\nDr. Langley. The members of this organization were, Mr. Curtiss, at\r\nthat time the most successful builder of light motors; Lieut. Thomas\r\nH. Selfridge, U. S. A.; Mr. J. A. D. McCurdy and Mr. F. W. Baldwin, two\r\nyoung Canadian engineers. Mrs. Bell financed the project, furnishing\r\nthe sum of $35,000 for the experiments.\r\n\r\n~WHAT TWO BROTHERS ACCOMPLISHED FOR FLYING~\r\n\r\nThe Wright Brothers, for Wilbur Wright was joined by his brother\r\nOrville in the experiments, were the first to reap success from the\r\nseeds of Dr. Langley’s sowing. Mr. Chanute had been experimenting\r\nwith a biplane form of motorless glider with little success, because\r\nof lack of means for balancing the machines in the air, until he was\r\njoined by a former employe of Dr. Langley. He appears to have imparted\r\nto Mr. Chanute the secret of the stabilizing effect of the Penaud\r\ntail, or combination of vertical and horizontal rudders. Thereafter\r\nhundreds of successful gliding flights were made with the Chanute\r\nbiplane, though Chanute seems not to have grasped the full significance\r\nof the rudders,--though it was well understood by Dr. Langley. To\r\nthe Chanute machine, as described to him, Mr. Wright added first the\r\nidea of flexing or warping the wings, after the fashion set by the\r\nLilienthals. He found, however, as Dr. Langley had found years before,\r\nthat in attempting to correct lateral balance in this way caused the\r\naeroplane to swerve to such an extent that the fixed vertical rudder,\r\nas originally employed, did not correct the upsetting tendency that was\r\ndeveloped. Mr. Wright then arranged his rudder in such a way that when\r\nthe wing was warped the rudder turned in a way to offset the swerve.\r\nThis combination was patented all over the world and has resulted in\r\nmuch complicated litigation.\r\n\r\nTo this machine the Wright Brothers added a gasoline motor in December,\r\n1903, and with it made numerous flights during 1904-5. Their claims\r\nwere not generally credited however until a later date for their\r\nexperiments had been conducted with considerable secrecy, and during\r\n1906, 1907 and until late in 1908 they did no more flying.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime M. Bleriot had made a copy of one of the early Langley\r\ntandem monoplane models and made some fairly successful flights with it\r\nin Europe. Later, as gasoline motors developed in power for weight, he\r\nreduced the rear surface until the modern monoplane evolved.\r\n\r\nWhile Bleriot was working in Europe, Dr. Bell’s Aerial Experiment\r\nAssociation in America was evolving still another type of machine, and\r\nthe members of the association made the first successful public flights\r\nin America. Mr. Curtiss won the Scientific American Trophy for the\r\nfirst time on July 4th, 1908, by a straightaway flight of more than a\r\nkilometer. The balancing system employed by the A. E. A. differed from\r\nthat employed by the Wrights and by Bleriot in that small auxiliary\r\nplanes took the place of warping planes for righting the machine. This\r\nthey claimed to be a superior method, first, because it eliminated the\r\nuse of the rudder as being absolutely essential to the balance of the\r\nmachine; second, because it enabled them to make the main planes rigid\r\nthroughout, and consequently stronger than the flexible planes.\r\n\r\nThere are several other names that must be mentioned in connection\r\nwith the early history of successful flight; these are the Frenchmen,\r\nMessrs. Henri Farman, Maurice Farman, the brothers Voisin, and Santos\r\nDumont. These produced some of the first notably successful aeroplanes\r\nin Europe but seem to have discovered nothing which has had any marked\r\neffect upon the later development of flying machines. M. Farman adopted\r\nthe auxiliary planes used by the A. E. A. and modified them to suit his\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n~WONDERFUL RECORDS OF AEROPLANES~\r\n\r\nVolumes could be, in fact, have been written about the exploits of\r\nthe first demonstrators of the practical heavier-than-air flying\r\nmachines,--of the crossing of the English Channel by Bleriot, of the\r\nflights by Wilbur Wright at Rheims, France; of Mr. Curtiss’ winning of\r\nthe first Gordon Bennet International speed trophy and his flight down\r\nthe Hudson from Albany to New York; of Orville Wright’s flight at Fort\r\nMeyer, and the death of Lieut. Selfridge who was flying with him. The\r\nbarest record of these interesting accomplishments would fill volumes.\r\nOf the aeroplane proper it is enough to say here that since 1908 its\r\ndevelopment has been too rapid for accurate recording. In strength, in\r\nspeed, in reliability, in size and carrying capacity, it has developed\r\nat a remarkable rate. At this writing the speed record is about 130\r\nmiles per hour; the duration record is more than 24 hours, non-stop;\r\nthe distance record is some 1,300 miles in one day; the altitude record\r\nsome 26,000 feet. New records succeed the old ones with such rapidity\r\nthat probably before this can be printed all these present records will\r\nhave been greatly eclipsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AEROPLANE “RED WING” HAMMONDSPORT, N.Y.\r\n\r\n  FIRST AMERICAN PUBLIC FLIGHT, MAR 12 1908]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The biplane in which G. H. Curtiss flew from Albany to\r\nNew York in 1910.]\r\n\r\nMeantime the aeroplane has developed greatly in other directions. In\r\nflying over land with the early types of machines many fatal accidents\r\noccurred, particularly to the fliers who gave exhibitions everywhere\r\nduring 1909, 1910 and 1911. A majority of these accidents were\r\nindirectly due to the fact that a very smooth surface is required for\r\nlanding a fragile machine running at high speed. The obvious expedient\r\nwas to develop machines capable of rising from and alighting upon the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME FAMOUS FOREIGN MONOPLANES\r\n\r\nA modern German monoplane.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The machine in which Bleriot crossed the English Channel\r\nin 1909. A modified Langley type.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rolland Garros and monoplane in which he flew across the\r\nMediterranean Sea in 1914.]\r\n\r\n~THE WONDERFUL FLYING BOAT~\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1910 and 1911 Mr. Curtiss, who had continued\r\nindependent experiments upon the disbandment of the Aerial Experiment\r\nAssociation, succeeded in producing the first machine to safely leave\r\nand return to the water. For the development and demonstration of\r\nthis type of flying machine he was awarded the Aero Club of America\r\nTrophy, and when during 1912 he produced still another type of water\r\nflying machine, the Curtiss Flying Boat, he was again awarded the Aero\r\nClub Trophy and also voted a Langley Medal by the directors of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Different views of flying boat.]\r\n\r\nNot until the development of the flying boat did the general public\r\nbegin to take a participative interest in aviation, but as soon as the\r\ncomparative safety of this type of machine became apparent the new\r\nsport began to be taken up rapidly both in this country and in Europe.\r\nThe experiences of naval fliers and amateurs alike went to show that\r\nwater flying offered not only the fastest and most comfortable mode\r\nof rapid travel, but also the safest, for during 1913 several hundred\r\nthousand miles were flown by navy aviators and amateur enthusiasts in\r\nCurtiss water flying machines without a single serious accident.\r\n\r\nWhat aviation will mean to future generations,--even to this generation\r\nin the course of a few years,--it would be foolhardy to try to guess.\r\nMr. Rodman Wanamaker already has agreed to furnish the financial\r\nsupport for Mr. Curtiss’ attempt to build a machine to fly across the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, from America to Europe. If the venture is successful it\r\nis expected the crossing will be made in a fraction of the time taken\r\nby the fastest Transatlantic liners. The discovery of new metals and\r\nnew manufacturing methods will certainly result in the development of\r\nlight motors that may be relied upon to run for days without stopping,\r\nand automatically stable aeroplanes seem to be not far away. This will\r\nresult in overland flight as safe and sure as we now enjoy over water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSIDE OF A MODERN FLYING BOAT\r\n\r\nInterior arrangement of modern flying boat, showing fuel tank and\r\ninstrument board.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Six-passenger flying boat hull. This machine will fly\r\n1,000 miles without stopping for fuel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FUN IN A FLYING BOAT\r\n\r\nFlying at speed of a mile a minute.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monoplane flying boat, built for R. V. Morris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In a flying boat on pleasure bent.]\r\n\r\n~GREATEST PRESENT VALUE OF AEROPLANE~\r\n\r\nAt present the greatest value of the aeroplane seems to be for\r\nmilitary reconnaissance and all the great powers are striving their\r\nutmost to secure supremacy in the air. France, Germany, Russia and\r\nEngland have to date spent millions in developing aeroplane fleets.\r\nOnly the government of the United States has failed as yet to\r\nappreciate the military significance of the flying machine. If the\r\nrelative aeronautical strength of the world’s nations were represented\r\nalphabetically the U. S. would naturally scarce have to change its\r\ninitial, U being slightly in advance of Z which would stand for\r\nZululand. But even with its modest equipment the navy fliers of the\r\nUnited States proved the great worth of the aeroplane and the flying\r\nboat, when during the recent trouble in Mexico the air scouts gathered\r\nin a few minutes information that could only have been secured by days\r\nof cavalry scouting before the advent of the flying machine. Indeed,\r\nthe name of Lieut. P. N. L. Bellinger, the most able of the naval\r\nfliers at Vera Cruz, has figured more prominently in the despatches\r\nfrom the front than that of any other officer connected with the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nFlying seems certain in the very near future to take its place as the\r\nfastest, safest and most comfortable mode of conveyance. The flying\r\nboat will render quickly accessible the vast country lying along the\r\ngreat rivers of South America, Africa, and Australia; it will bridge\r\nthe great lakes and the oceans; bring near together the islands of the\r\nPacific and Indian oceans. It will make imperative, because of the\r\nspeed with which distances will be traversed, of a language common\r\nto all peoples; and treble man’s life without extending his years by\r\nmaking it possible to see and do three times as much in the same length\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n~TEN YEARS OF FLYING~\r\n\r\nTen years ago on that day, December 17, 1913, Wilbur and Orville Wright\r\nmade four flights on the coast of North Carolina near Roanoke Island,\r\na spot historic in America’s history as the site of the first English\r\nsettlement in the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flying over military post in Curtiss biplane.]\r\n\r\nThe first flight started from level ground against a 27-mile wind.\r\nAfter a run of 40 feet on a monorail track, the machine lifted and\r\ncovered a distance of 120 feet over the ground in 12 seconds. It had\r\na speed through the air of a little over 45 feet per second, and the\r\nflight, if made in calm air, would have covered a distance of over 540\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAltogether four flights were made on the 17th. The first and third by\r\nOrville Wright, the second and fourth by Wilbur Wright. The last flight\r\nwas the longest, covering a distance of 852 feet over the ground in 59\r\nseconds. After the fourth flight, a gust of wind struck the machine\r\nstanding on the ground and rolled it over, injuring it to an extent\r\nthat made further flights with it impossible for that year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1900\r\n\r\n  1901\r\n\r\n  1902\r\n\r\n  1905\r\n  1904\r\n\r\n  1903]\r\n\r\nThe gliding experiments of Lilienthal in 1896 led the Wright Brothers\r\nto become interested in flight. The next four years were spent in\r\nreading and theorizing. In the Fall of 1900 practical experiments were\r\nbegun with a man-carrying glider. These experiments were carried on\r\nfrom the sand hills near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The first glider\r\nwas without a tail, the lateral equilibrium and the right and left\r\nsteering were obtained by warping of the main surfaces. A flexible\r\nforward elevator was used. This machine was flown as a kite with and\r\nwithout operator, and several glides were made with it.\r\n\r\nA second machine was designed of larger size, and many glides were\r\nmade with it in 1901. This machine was similar to the one of 1900 but\r\nhad slightly deeper curved surfaces. Experiments with this machine\r\ndemonstrated the inaccuracy of all the recognized tables of air\r\npressures, upon which its design had been based.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 a third glider was constructed, based upon tables of air\r\npressures made by the Wright Brothers themselves. The lateral control\r\nwas maintained by warping surfaces, and a vertical rear rudder operated\r\nin conjunction with the surfaces. Nearly a thousand gliding flights\r\nwere made with this machine.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, the Wright Brothers designed a machine to be driven with a\r\nmotor. They also designed and built their own motor. This had four\r\nhorizontal cylinders, 4 in. by 4 in., and developed 12 h.p. Two\r\npropellers, turning in opposite directions, were driven by chains from\r\nthe engine. After many delays the machine was finally ready and was\r\nflown on the 17th of December, 1903, as related above.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1904, power flights were continued near Dayton with a\r\nmachine similar to the one flown in 1903, but slightly heavier.\r\n\r\nThe first complete circle was accomplished on the 20th of September,\r\n1904, in a flight covering a distance of about one mile. Altogether 105\r\nflights were attempted during the year, the longest of which were two\r\nof five minutes each, covering a distance of about three miles. All of\r\nthe flights were started from a monorail.\r\n\r\nAfter September a derrick and a falling weight were used to assist in\r\nlaunching the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1908-9\r\n\r\n  1910\r\n\r\n  1910\r\n\r\n  MODEL R, 1910]\r\n\r\n~INTERESTING GOVERNMENTS IN FLYING MACHINES~\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1908 that the Wright Brothers found purchasers for\r\ntheir invention. In that year they made a contract to furnish one\r\nmachine to the Signal Corps of the United States Army and to sell the\r\nrights to their invention in France to a French company. In both cases\r\nthey agreed to carry a passenger in addition to the operator, fuel\r\nsufficient for a flight of 100 miles, and to make a speed of 40 miles\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nAfter making some preliminary practice flights at their old experiment\r\ngrounds near Kitty Hawk in May, 1908, Wilbur Wright went to France to\r\ngive demonstrations before the French Syndicate and Orville Wright to\r\nWashington to deliver the machine to the United States Signal Corps.\r\nThe machines used by Wilbur Wright had been standing in bond in the\r\nwarehouse at Havre since August of the year before. Owing to damage\r\ndone to the machine in shipment, it was not ready for the official\r\ndemonstrations until late in the year.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Orville Wright in September, 1908, started demonstrations\r\nof the machine contracted for by the United States Government. On the\r\n9th he made two flights, one of 57 minutes, and the other one hour\r\nand 2 minutes, world’s records. On the 10th and 11th, these records\r\nwere increased and on the 12th a flight of 1 hour and 15 minutes was\r\nmade. On the 17th, the tests were terminated by an accident in which\r\nLieutenant Selfridge met his death and Mr. Wright was severely injured,\r\nso that he was not able to complete the tests until the following year.\r\n\r\nFour days after the accident, on the 21st of September, Wilbur Wright\r\nmade a flight of 1 hour and 31 minutes at Le Mans, France, which record\r\nhe improved several times during the following months, and on the 31st\r\nof December, won the Michelin Trophy by a flight, in which he remained\r\nin the air 2 hours and 24 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Is the Wind When It Is Not Blowing?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer is, of course, that there isn’t any wind then. To understand\r\nthis perfectly we must study a little and find out what wind is. In\r\nplain words it is nothing more than moving air.\r\n\r\nIf you make a hole in the bottom of a pail of water the water will run\r\nout slowly. If you knock the whole bottom out of the pail filled with\r\nwater, the water will rush out before you know it.\r\n\r\nThat is about what happens to make the wind. The air is constantly\r\nfull of air currents, like the currents you can see in a river. Down\r\nthe middle of the river you may notice a softly-flowing current going\r\nstraight. Along the shores there will be little side currents going\r\nin all directions, and you may find some little whirlpools. That is\r\nexactly what we should see in the air if we could see air currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does the Wind Begin?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movement of these currents of air leaves many pockets of space\r\nwhere there is no air, and when one of these is uncovered the air\r\nrushes in and creates a wind in doing so. These air currents are\r\ncontinually pressing against each other to get some place else. They\r\nchange their direction according to the pressure that is being applied\r\nto them. Sometimes the pressure will be very light in one part of the\r\nair, many miles away perhaps, and then the air in another part, which\r\nis under great pressure, will rush with great force into the part where\r\nthe pressure is light, and thus form a big wind. When the pressure\r\nstops the wind stops.\r\n\r\nWe have probably felt the wind which comes out of the valve of the\r\nautomobile tire when the cap is taken off to pump up the tire. It is a\r\nreal wind that comes out. The reason is that the air in the tube of the\r\ntire is under great pressure, and when the opportunity is given to get\r\nwhere the pressure is light it starts for that place with a rush and\r\ncomes out of the valve a real wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes the Wind’s Whistle?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whistle of the wind is caused very much like the whistle you make\r\nwith your mouth or the noise made by the steam escaping through the\r\nspout of the kettle. You do not hear the wind whistle when you are\r\nout in it. You can hear it when you are in the house and the wind is\r\nblowing hard. When the wind blows against the house it tries to get\r\nin through all the crevices, under the cracks of the doors, down the\r\nchimneys, wherever it finds an opening. And whenever it starts through\r\nan opening that is too small for it, it makes a noise like the steam\r\ncoming out of the spout of the kettle, provided the opening is of a\r\ncertain shape.\r\n\r\nNot all the noises made by the wind, however, are made in this way. The\r\nwind in blowing against things makes them vibrate like the strings of a\r\npiano or violin, and when things vibrate, as we have already seen, they\r\nproduce sound waves, which, when they strike our ears, produce sounds\r\nof various kinds. The wind even on ordinary days makes the telegraph\r\nand telephone wires hum, as you can prove to yourself by placing your\r\near against a telegraph or telephone pole, and whenever the wind makes\r\nanything vibrate, a great many queer sounds are produced, which often\r\nfrighten us more than they should.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does the Air Never Get Used Up?\r\n\r\n\r\nSimply because it is constantly being replenished. The three gases,\r\noxygen, nitrogen and carbonic acid gas, which are found in the air\r\nabout us, are constantly being used up. All living animal creatures are\r\nat all times taking oxygen out of the air to live on. Certain microbes\r\nare using up quantities of the nitrogen all the time, and the plants\r\nlive on the carbonic acid gas. But while these different kinds of life\r\nbetween them use up the air, they give back something also. The plants\r\ngive off oxygen. The bodies of the animals and plants when they die\r\ndecompose, and as they are full of nitrogen, that is given back to the\r\nair in that way, and then all living creatures are always throwing off\r\ncarbonic acid gas through their lungs, and thus everything that is\r\ntaken out of the air is put back again. The plants live on carbonic\r\nacid gas, and give us back oxygen. The living creatures live on oxygen\r\nand give off carbonic acid gas, and when they die their bodies put\r\nback in the air the nitrogen which the microbes take out, and so,\r\nconsumption and production are about equal all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can’t We See Air?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot see air because it has no color and is perfectly transparent.\r\nIf at times it appears that there is color in the air it is not the\r\nair you see, but some little particles of various substances in it.\r\nSometimes you think when you look off toward a range of mountains or\r\nhills, for instance, that the air is blue. You know the grass and trees\r\non the mountains are green, so it cannot be they that have turned blue,\r\nand so you think the air is blue. But it is only the sunlight reflected\r\nto your eyes from the little particles of dirt and other substances\r\nwhich fill the air at all times which makes the blue that you see, and\r\nnot the air.\r\n\r\nPure air is a mixture of gases without any color and is perfectly\r\ntransparent. Air is nearly entirely composed of a gas called\r\nnitrogen--the remainder being oxygen with a little water and carbonic\r\nacid gas, which latter is thrown off in breathing. This is, however,\r\nbut a very small percentage.\r\n\r\nAir has been and still can be reduced to a liquid state, and with\r\nthe use of it in this form many seemingly wonderful things can be\r\ndone, which are interesting to look at, but have not as yet become\r\ncommercially practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Thunder Always Come After the Lightning?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis occurs simply because lightning or light travels so much more\r\nquickly than sound. Light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per\r\nsecond, and sound travels only at the rate of 1090 feet per second when\r\nthe temperature is at 32 degrees. Now, the thunder and lightning come\r\nat the same time and place in the air, but the light travels so much\r\nfaster that you see the lightning often quite some seconds before you\r\nhear the thunder. In fact, you can tell quite accurately how far away\r\nfrom you the flash of lightning and clap of thunder are by taking a\r\nwatch and noting the number of seconds which elapse between the flash\r\nof the lightning and the time when you hear the roll of the thunder.\r\nIf as much as five seconds elapse you can figure that it was about a\r\nmile away from you, since sound travels only about 1100 feet per second\r\nand there are 5280 feet in a mile. When the thunder and lightning come\r\nclose together you may know that it is near by, and when they come at\r\nthe same time you may be sure it is very close. When, therefore, you\r\nsee the lightning and then have to wait several seconds for the noise\r\nof the thunder, you may rest easy about the lightning hurting you,\r\nbecause you know then it is too far away to harm you, and when it is so\r\nclose that the lightning and thunder come simultaneously, there is no\r\nuse being afraid, because if you were to be struck you would have been\r\nstruck at the same instant or before you would have had time to notice\r\nthat the lightning and thunder come together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Big Is the Sun?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to gain a clear idea of how very large the sun\r\nreally is. We know from the scientists who have measured it with their\r\naccurate measuring instruments that it is 865,000 miles through it, and\r\nthat at its largest part it is 2,722,000 miles around. Now, you can\r\nsee why I said it is very difficult to get a clear conception of the\r\nsun’s size. A mile is quite a long distance to walk on a hot day. Now,\r\nthe earth is 8000 miles through. If there were a tunnel right through\r\nthe earth, like the subway, and you started to walk it, it would take\r\nyou 83¹⁄₃ days if you walked day and night without stopping to rest or\r\neat, if you kept going at the rate of four miles every hour. This would\r\nbe a long, hot walk, for, of course, the inside of the earth is hot,\r\nas we have already learned. It would take an automobile, going at the\r\nrate of 40 miles an hour night and day, about nine days to make the\r\ntrip through such a subway from one side of the earth to the other.\r\nThat makes it look like a pretty big old earth, doesn’t it? But let us\r\nsee what would happen if we started to do the same thing on the sun.\r\nThe sun is 865,000 miles through. If you were to walk through a similar\r\ntunnel on the sun at four miles per hour it would take you 20 years,\r\nnot counting the stops, and an automobile going 40 miles an hour day\r\nand night would take two years and a half to make the trip one way.\r\n\r\nThe sun is ninety million miles from the earth and an automobile\r\ntravelling at the rate of forty miles per hour day and night on a\r\nstraight road, without stopping, would be 257 years in getting there.\r\n\r\nWhen we stop to think of how big the bulk of the sun is it is\r\naltogether beyond us. We have a general idea that our earth is a pretty\r\nlarge affair as worlds go, and yet we cannot conceive how much the\r\nbulk of the earth amounts to. Still, the sun is so large that it could\r\ncontain a million worlds like our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Hot Is the Sun?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe think the sun is pretty hot in summer when the thermometer goes\r\nup to 90 degrees in the shade or out. We begin to get sunburned long\r\nbefore it reaches that high. But right on the sun’s surface it is\r\nbetween 10,000 and 15,000 degrees hot. That is, of course, a degree\r\nof heat which we cannot conceive. How much hotter still it is on the\r\ninside of the sun we don’t as yet know. It must be awfully hot there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is It Warm in Summer?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is warm in summer because at that season of the year the heat rays\r\nof the sun strike our part of the earth through less air. The blanket\r\nof air which surrounds the earth is very much in comparison as to\r\nthickness like the peeling of an orange and surrounds the earth in\r\njust the same way. If you stick a pin straight into an unpeeled orange\r\nyou only have to stick it in a little way before you reach the juicy\r\npart of the orange, but if you stick the pin in at an angle the pin\r\nwill travel a much longer ways through pure peeling before it strikes\r\nthe juicy part. Now, then, in summer the rays of the sun come down\r\nto us straight through the peeling of air, and less of the heat is\r\nlost by contact with the air, and that makes it warmer in summer. The\r\nexplanation also accounts for your next question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is It Cold in Winter?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn winter the heat rays of the sun strike at our part of the earth at\r\nthe angle at which you stick the pin into the orange when you wish to\r\nmake it travel through the most peeling. In winter the rays strike\r\nthe earth at such an angle that a great deal of the heat is lost in\r\ntravelling through the air, because they have to come through so much\r\nmore of the air. Of course, the sun’s rays strike some part of the\r\nearth straight down through the peeling of air at all times, and at the\r\nequator this occurs all the year round, so it is always summer there,\r\nwhile at the North and South Poles the rays always strike the earth at\r\nthe greatest possible angle, and it is always very cold winter there.\r\nIn between, when it is neither hot nor cold, we have spring and fall,\r\ndue to the fact that the rays come down at an angle, but not so great\r\nan angle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Have We Five Fingers on Each Hand and Five Toes on Each Foot?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll animals, it seems, from a study of nature were started with ten\r\nfingers and ten toes, the fingers originally having been the toes of\r\nthe fore legs. In a good many cases the environment in which animals\r\nhave lived has caused a change in the formation of the ends of the\r\nlimbs as well as in the limbs themselves. The horse, for instance, has\r\ndeveloped into a one toe or one finger animal, while a cow is a two\r\nfinger animal. The hen has only three toes on each foot and a part of\r\nanother. But if we go back into the history and examine how the horses’\r\nfoot used to look we will find that he originally had five toes. The\r\nsame is true of the cow and also the hen. Something happened to cause\r\nthe change, for the rule of five fingers and five toes on the end of\r\neach limb has been universal. If you examine a chicken in a shell just\r\nbefore it is ready to come out, you can distinctly count five toes on\r\neach foot and at the ends of the wings you will see five little points,\r\nwhich under other conditions would develop into fingers, perhaps.\r\nSome of these toes of the new-born chicken do not develop. It can be\r\naccepted as a rule that creatures were intended in the original plan to\r\nhave five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot, making our\r\ncount of tens, which is the world’s basis for counting, and has always\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Have Finger Nails?\r\n\r\n\r\nFinger nails and toe nails are only another phase of the development\r\nof man from the animal that originally walked on four feet. Animals\r\nthat walk on all fours use the finger and toe coverings which in man\r\nis the nail, to scratch in the ground, to attack enemies, and to climb\r\nwith, and our nails of the present day are what the development of man\r\ninto a civilized being has changed them to. At that, there are still\r\nuses for finger nails and toe nails, or man in his changing to a higher\r\nplane would have found a way to develop away from them. They are useful\r\nto-day in making our fingers and toes firm at the end, and enable us\r\nto pick up things more easily. The time may come when man will have\r\nneither finger nails nor toe nails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Our Fingers of Different Lengths?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no known reason why our fingers should be of different lengths\r\nto-day; in fact, it is thought by some people that the hand would\r\nbe stronger if the fingers were all of the same length. Certainly,\r\nhowever, the hands would not then be so beautiful, and it might not be\r\nso useful. The human hand to-day is perhaps the most versatile thing\r\nin the world. You can do more things with the hand than with any other\r\nthing in the world. The probability is that the shape of the hand\r\nto-day and the length of the fingers are the result of the different\r\nthings the human being has called upon the hand to do during man’s\r\ndevelopment up to the present time.\r\n\r\nWe must go back to the time, however, when man walked on fours, for\r\nthat is probably the real explanation. Originally man’s fingers were\r\nof different lengths because all four-footed animals had the same\r\npeculiarities. The shape and length of the toes and their arrangement\r\nwere the ideal arrangement for giving the proper balance and support\r\nto the body, and in moving about and in climbing produced the best toe\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does It Hurt When I Cut My Finger?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt hurts when you cut your finger, or, rather, where you cut it,\r\nbecause the place you have cut is exposed to the oxygen in the air, and\r\nas soon as it is so exposed a chemical action begins to take place,\r\njust as when you cut an apple and lay it aside you come back and find\r\nthe cut surface all turned brown. If the apple could feel it would\r\nhurt also, because the chemical action is much the same. The apple has\r\na skin which protects its inside from the oxygen in the air, and you\r\nhave also a skin which protects you from the oxygen as long as it is\r\nunbroken.\r\n\r\nWhat happens, of course, is this: When you cut your finger you sever\r\nthe tiny little veins and nerves which are in your finger. They are\r\nspread all over your body like a net-work under the skin, close to the\r\nsurface in most places. The nerves when cut send a quick message to the\r\nbrain, with which they are connected, telling that they are damaged,\r\nand the brain calls on the heart and other functions to get busy and\r\nrepair the damage along the line. There may be some hurt while this\r\nprocess of repairing is going on, but the principal part of your hurt,\r\noutside of what we call your feelings, is due to the fact that the\r\ninside of you is thus exposed to the chemical action of the air. Then I\r\ncan hear you say next:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Don’t My Hair Hurt When It Is Being Cut?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not hurt to cut anything that has no nerves. There are no\r\nnerves in the hair which the barber cuts. If he pulls out a hair it\r\nhurts, because the root of the hair has nerves, which telegraph notice\r\nof the damage to the brain. When a dentist takes out or kills the nerve\r\nin your tooth you cannot have any more toothache in that tooth, because\r\nthere is no nerve there to send the message to the brain. You can cut\r\nyour finger nails without feeling pain, because they have no nerves at\r\nthe ends, but underneath, where they join the skin of the finger, there\r\nare a great many nerves, and it hurts very much to bruise the nails at\r\nthat location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf What Use Is My Hair?\r\n\r\n\r\n~WHY WE HAVE HAIR~\r\n\r\nYour hair is a relic of the days when the entire body was covered with\r\nhair, just like some animals to-day, to protect the body from the heat,\r\ncold and wet. Man has, however, for so long a time worn clothes over\r\nmost of his body that the need of the hair to protect him from these\r\nelements has all but disappeared, and so also has the hair, excepting\r\nin such places as the top of the head and face and other exposed\r\nparts. If you were to go out into the woods without clothes and live\r\na long time your body would probably again become covered with hairs.\r\nThe time is coming, however, it is believed, when human beings will\r\nhave no hair at all on their bodies. You have hair on your head, but\r\nif you were to wear a hat or cap all the time you would soon be bald.\r\nHair is of no use to us to-day excepting to adorn our bodies and add\r\nto our appearance. This it seems to do to-day, probably because we\r\nare accustomed to seeing it, and will make no difference in our looks\r\nrelatively if the time comes when we have no hair at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does My Hair Stand On End When I Am Frightened?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does this under certain conditions, because there is a little\r\nmuscle down at the root of each hair that will make each hair stand\r\nup straight when this muscle pulls a certain way. It is difficult to\r\nsay just how these muscles are caused to act in this way when we are\r\nfrightened. We know that when thoroughly frightened our hair will\r\nsometimes stand straight up, and we know that it is this muscle at the\r\nroot of each hair that makes it possible, but why it is that a big\r\nscare will make this muscle act this way we do not as yet know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Some People Bald?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of baldness is the lack of care of the hair. It is as\r\nnecessary for the roots of the hair to have a free circulation of\r\nthe blood and that the hair itself should have plenty of air as it is\r\nnecessary for the brain to have a good circulation. A great many men\r\nbecome bald through wearing their hats most of the time. The hat pulled\r\ndown tight over the head presses against the scalp and interferes with\r\nthe circulation of the blood in the scalp. Then, also, many hats do\r\nnot have any means of ventilation, and that keeps the pure air away\r\nfrom the hair. The hair then becomes sick and dies, just as flowers\r\nwilt if you keep them away from the air. You will notice that women\r\ndo not become bald so easily. One reason is that even when the women\r\nwear large hats, as they often do, there is plenty of room for the air\r\nto circulate through the hair, even when the hat is on, and women’s\r\nhats are not pulled down tightly on the scalp. Therefore, they do not\r\npress on the arteries and veins in the scalp and interfere with the\r\ncirculation of the blood. Another reason why women do not become bald\r\nis that the hair of women has long been their “crowning glory”; a man\r\nlikes to see a fine head of hair on a woman, and as women have long\r\ntried to please men in every possible way, they take better care of\r\ntheir hair than men do, because they like to have the men consider it\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Some Things in the Same Room Colder than Others?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objects in a room which has been kept at a given even temperature\r\nof heat will be all the same temperature, because heat spreads from one\r\nthing to another equally.\r\n\r\nStill, if you put your hands on various objects in such a room some\r\nof them will feel colder than others. You touch the tiling of the\r\nfireplace and that will feel cool to you. On the other hand, the\r\nupholstered furniture will feel quite warm. The piano keys feel cool,\r\nwhile the wood of the piano and case is warm. The difference is due to\r\nthe fact that heat or cold will run through some objects more quickly\r\nthan through others. It will run through the tiling on the hearth\r\nand the piano keys more quickly than through the upholstering on the\r\nfurniture or the wood of the piano case. When you touch a thing with\r\nyour finger you supply some of the heat of your body to the object\r\nthrough your finger. If the object is the tiling on the hearth or\r\nthe keys of the piano the heat runs through it quickly and you get a\r\ncold impression in your finger. On the other hand, if you touch the\r\nupholstery on the furniture, through which the heat runs slowly, you\r\nget a warm feeling for the very same reason. Thus, anything which\r\ncarries the heat away from our contact quickly we call a cold feeling\r\nobject, and if the object touched does not carry the heat away so\r\nquickly we call it a warm feeling object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does the Hair Grow After the Body Stops Growing?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hair on our bodies is one of the things that is continually wearing\r\nor falling away, and since, like the skin, it is necessary to protect\r\ncertain portions of the body, the hair keeps on growing long after the\r\ngrown up period has arrived. The skin is a very necessary protection\r\nof the whole body, but is constantly being worn away, and is all the\r\ntime being replaced. Your hair falls out when it is not healthy. Unless\r\nproper care is given to it, it will fall out and not grow in again, and\r\nthen we become bald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill People All Be Bald Sometime?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a theory that before many years have passed human beings\r\nwill lose all of the hairs which now grow on different parts of their\r\nbodies, due to the fact that we wear so much clothing and keep so much\r\nof our bodies away from the sunlight. If that time comes we shall have\r\na hairless race of men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY IN A LUMP OF SUGAR\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING THE GROUND.--PLOWING AND HARROWING WITH A\r\nCATERPILLAR ENGINE.\r\n\r\nSugar beets require deep plowing, ten to fourteen inches, or twice the\r\nusual depth. When using horses, farmers are inclined not to plow deeply\r\nenough to secure maximum results, and some of the factories have put\r\nin power plows which turn six furrows and harrow the land at the same\r\ntime. They plow and harrow the land of beet farmers for $2.50 per acre,\r\nwhich is about one-half of what it costs the farmers to plow equally\r\ndeep with horses. The traction engines also are used for hauling train\r\nwagon loads of beets to the factory. In some localities farmers are\r\nbanding together and purchasing engines for plowing and hauling beets.\r\nThe outfit illustrated above costs about $4,500.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRILLING THE SEED.\r\n\r\nBeets are drilled in rows, usually eighteen inches apart, 18 to 25\r\npounds of seed being drilled to each acre. Practically all the beet\r\nseed used in America is grown in Europe, principally in Germany, but it\r\nhas been demonstrated that superior seed can be produced in the United\r\nStates. Sugar-beet seed growing requires five years of the utmost\r\nskill, care and patience, from the planting of the original seed to\r\nthe maturing of the commercial crop which is sold to the trade. The\r\nfactories contract for their seed for three to five years in advance,\r\nsell it to farmers at cost price, and deduct the amount from the\r\npayment for beets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE BEETS ARE GROWN\r\n\r\nBLOCKING AND THINNING.\r\n\r\nWhen the beets are up and show the third leaf they should be “thinned.”\r\nUnless thinned at the proper time the pulling up of the superfluous\r\nbeetlets injures the roots of the remaining ones. Scientific\r\nexperiments in Germany, where all other conditions were identical,\r\nshowed that one acre thinned at the proper time yielded 15 tons; the\r\nnext acre, thinned a week later, yielded 13¹⁄₂ tons; the third acre,\r\nthinned still a week later, yielded 10¹⁄₂ tons; and the fourth acre,\r\nthinned three weeks after the first, yielded 7¹⁄₂ tons.\r\n\r\nThe men in the foreground are “blocking” the beets, leaving a bunch of\r\nthem every eight inches. Those in the rear are “thinning,” or pulling\r\nup the superfluous beetlets, leaving one in a place, eight inches\r\napart.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: READY FOR THE HARVEST.\r\n\r\nThis field of beets yielded 20 tons to the acre. Ex-Secretary of\r\nAgriculture James Wilson is convinced that when American farmers become\r\nexpert in beet culture they will average to produce more than 20 tons\r\nper acre because of the superiority of our soils. The ideal factory\r\nbeet weighs about two pounds, and a perfect “stand” of such beets, one\r\nevery eight inches, in rows eighteen inches apart, would yield 43¹⁄₃\r\ntons per acre. The present average yield in the United States is about\r\n10 tons per acre, while the hitherto “worn-out soils” of Germany yield\r\n14 tons per acre, or 40% more than is secured from our “virgin soils.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUGE BINS TO HOLD THE BEETS AT FACTORY\r\n\r\nTOPPING THE BEETS.\r\n\r\nAfter the beets are plowed out they are topped or cut off by hand and\r\nthe tops are fed to stock, for which purpose they are worth $3.00 per\r\nacre. They are topped just below the crown and the factories require\r\nthat they be so topped as to remove any portion which grew above the\r\nground, as such portion of the beet contains but a small percentage of\r\nsugar. The beet will grow in length, and, if as a result of shallow\r\nplowing or coming in contact with a rock it cannot grow downward, it\r\nwill grow upward and out of the ground, thus necessitating a deeper\r\ntopping and consequent loss to the farmer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUMPING CARS AT FACTORY WITH HYDRAULIC JACK.\r\n\r\nBeets arriving at the factory by rail from receiving stations either\r\nare stored in bins until needed or are floated directly to the beet\r\nwashers. If to be used at once, they are dumped, as shown above, and\r\nslide directly into a cement flume filled with warm water, which has\r\nbeen pumped to its upper end, and is flowing in the direction of the\r\nbeet end of the factory. In whatever manner they may be received, they\r\nfirst are weighed, and as they are dumped, a basket is held under them\r\nto catch a fair sample of both beets and the loose dirt, which the\r\ncar or wagon contains. These samples, properly tagged, are conveyed\r\nto the beet laboratory, where they are washed, and trimmed if not\r\nproperly topped, and the difference in the weight of the sample beets\r\nas received and their weight when washed is called the “tare.” Whatever\r\npercentage this amounts to is applied to and deducted from the weight\r\nof the car or wagon load. A sample of these beets then is tested by the\r\npolariscope for its sugar content and its purity; farmers often being\r\npaid a stipulated price per ton for a beet of a given sugar content and\r\n25 to 33¹⁄₃ cents per ton additional for each extra degree of sugar\r\nwhich they contain. The tare rooms and the beet-testing laboratories\r\nare open to any one, and in some localities the farmers’ associations\r\nemploy experts to tare and analyze each sample of beets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILLIONS OF BUSHELS OF BEETS\r\n\r\nFACTORY BEET BINS FILLED TO CAPACITY.\r\n\r\nAs they arrive by rail from receiving stations, or by team, or traction\r\nengines from the farm, beets are stored in bins or sheds, the capacity\r\nof which ranges from 6000 to 35,000 tons per factory, depending upon\r\nlocation and general climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe bins are V shaped, about 3 feet wide at the bottom, 20 to 30 feet\r\nat the top, and they are 20 to 30 feet high. As beets are needed,\r\nbeginning at one end of the bin the loose three-foot planks at the\r\nbottom are removed one at a time, and with hooks attached to long poles\r\nthe beets are rolled into the flume or cement channel below, in which\r\nthey are floated into the factory. This is not only to save labor,\r\nbut to loosen up the dirt which attaches to the beets, thus partially\r\nwashing them. The water which is used in the flumes is warm water from\r\nthe factory.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL AMERICAN BEET SUGAR FACTORY.\r\n\r\nThese factories cost from half a million to three million dollars.\r\nThey consume from 500 to 3,000 tons of beets per day, and during the\r\n“campaign,” which usually lasts about three months, will produce from\r\n12 to 75 million pounds of granulated sugar. There are 73 of these\r\nfactories, located in 16 States, from Ohio to California. During the\r\noperating season they give employment to from 400 to 1000 men each.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHING THE SUGAR BEETS\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL LABORATORY.\r\n\r\nIn a beet-sugar factory each set of apparatus for performing a given\r\nprocess is termed a “station.” In the chemical laboratory the juices\r\nand products from each station are tested hourly to check up the\r\ncorrectness of the work and to determine the losses of sugar in each\r\nprocess in the factory.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CIRCULAR DIFFUSION BATTERY.\r\n\r\nAfter being floated in from the sheds the beets are elevated from the\r\nflume to a washer, where they are given an additional washing before\r\nbeing sliced. From the washer they are elevated and dropped into an\r\nautomatic scale of a capacity of 700 to 1500 pounds. From the scale\r\nthey pass to the slicers, where with triangular knives they are cut\r\ninto long, slender slices, which look something like “shoestring”\r\npotatoes. These slices drop through the upright chute seen at the right\r\nside of the picture, and are packed tightly into cylindrical vessels\r\nholding from two to six tons each; the battery consisting of eight to\r\ntwelve vessels arranged either in a straight line or in circular form.\r\nWarm water is run into these slices, and coaxes out the sugar as it\r\npasses from one vessel to the succeeding ones. After passing through\r\nthe entire series of vessels the water has become rich in sugar, of\r\nwhich it contains from 12 to 15 per cent, depending upon the richness\r\nof the beets. It then is drawn off and is called diffusion juice or\r\nraw juice. This is carefully measured into tanks and recorded. As this\r\njuice is drawn off the vessel over which the water started is emptied\r\nof the slices from the bottom, the exhaust slices containing in the\r\nneighborhood of ¹⁄₄ to ¹⁄₃ per cent of sugar. These slices are carried\r\nout from the factory in the form of pulp and fed to stock, as explained\r\nlater.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE SUGAR IS TAKEN FROM THE BEET\r\n\r\nCARBONATATION AND SULPHUR STATION.\r\n\r\nWarm raw juice is drawn into the carbonatation tanks and treated with\r\nabout 10 per cent milk of lime--about like ordinary whitewash. This\r\nlime throws out impurities, sterilizes the juice and removes coloring\r\nmatter. Carbonic acid gas from the lime kiln is forced through the\r\nlime juice in the tank, throwing out the excess of lime, converting it\r\ninto a carbonate of lime or chalk. Tests are taken here by the station\r\noperator to show when the process is finished.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILTER PRESSES.\r\n\r\nFrom the carbonatation tanks the juice is pumped or forced through\r\nfilter presses consisting of iron frames so covered with cloth that the\r\njuice passes through the cloth as a clear liquid, leaving the lime and\r\nimpurities precipitated by it, in the frame, in the form of a cake.\r\nThis cake, after washing, is dropped from the presses and conveyed out\r\nof the factory. It contains from one to two per cent of its weight\r\nin sugar, which constitutes one of the large losses of the process.\r\nIt also contains organic matter, phosphate and potash, besides the\r\ncarbonate of lime, which makes it an excellent fertilizer, all of which\r\nis used in Europe on the farm, but so far to too small an extent in\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EVAPORATING THE WATER FROM THE SUGAR\r\n\r\nEVAPORATORS.\r\n\r\nAfter a second, and sometimes a third carbonatation and filtration, the\r\njuice is carried to the evaporators, commonly called the “effects,”\r\nusually four (4) large air-tight vessels furnished with heating tubes\r\nrunning from 3000 to 7000 square feet in each vessel. A partial vacuum\r\nis maintained in these evaporators which makes the juice boil out at a\r\nlow temperature, thus preventing discoloration, and to a large degree\r\nthe destruction of sugar which will come about by high temperature.\r\nThere always is, however, some unavoidable loss of sugar in this\r\napparatus. The juice passes along copper pipes from first to last\r\nvessel, becoming thicker as it does so. It comes into the first vessel\r\nat 10% to 12% sugar and is pumped out of the last one so thick that it\r\ncontains about 50% of sugar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VACUUM PANS.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful filtration, the juice that comes from the evaporators,\r\nand is called thick juice, is pumped to large tanks high up in the\r\nbuilding, and from these is drawn into vacuum pans. These are large\r\ncylindrical vessels from 10 to 15 feet in diameter and from 15 to 25\r\nfeet high, with conical top and bottom, built air-tight. Around the\r\ninner circumference they are furnished with 4- to 6-inch copper coils,\r\nwhich have a heating surface of 800 to 2000 square feet. Exhaust steam\r\nis used in the evaporators, live steam in the pans, the juice in both\r\nbeing boiled in a vacuum to prevent discoloration and reduce losses.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable thickening by this evaporation, minute crystals\r\nbegin to form. When sufficient of these have formed, fresh juice is\r\ndrawn in and the crystals grow, the operator governing the size of\r\nthe crystals to suit the trade. If small crystals be desired, a large\r\nquantity of juice is admitted at the outset, while if large crystals\r\nare desired, a small quantity of juice first is admitted, and, as it\r\nboils to crystals, fresh juice gradually is added to the pan, and the\r\ncrystals are built up to the desired size. The operator of this pan,\r\nknown as the “sugar boiler,” is one of the must important men in the\r\nfactory. The water furnished the condensers of these vacuum pans and\r\nthe evaporator goes to the beet sheds and is used for floating in the\r\nbeets. It amounts to from 3,000,000 to 8,000,000 gallons every 24\r\nhours, depending upon the size of the factory, and must be very pure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW SUGAR IS GRANULATED\r\n\r\nFRONT VIEW OF CENTRIFUGAL MACHINES.\r\n\r\nThe mass of crystals with syrup around them and containing about 8 per\r\ncent to 10 per cent of water is let out of the vacuum pan into a large\r\nopen vessel called a mixer, beneath which are the centrifugal machines.\r\nThese are suspended brass drums perforated with holes and lined with a\r\nfine screen. They are made to revolve about 1000 times to a minute, and\r\nthe crystal mass of sugar rises up the side like water in a whirling\r\nbucket. The centrifugals force the syrup out through the screen holes,\r\nleaving the white crystals of sugar in a thick layer on the inner\r\nsurface. These are washed with a spray of pure warm water and then are\r\nready for the dryer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR GRANULATOR OR DRYER.\r\n\r\nThe damp white crystals from the centrifugal machine are conveyed\r\nto horizontal revolving drums about 25 feet long by 5 to 6 feet\r\nin diameter. These drums are furnished with paddles on the inside\r\ncircumference, the paddles picking the sugar up and dropping it in\r\nshowers as the drum revolves. Warm dry air is drawn through and takes\r\nthe moisture out of the sugar, which now is ready to be put in bags or\r\nbarrels for the market.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BY-PRODUCTS OF THE SUGAR BEET\r\n\r\nCRYSTALLIZERS.\r\n\r\nThe syrup that was thrown off from the crystals in the centrifugal\r\nmachines is taken back to the vacuum pan, evaporated in the same\r\nmanner as previously described, and from the vacuum pan goes into the\r\ncrystallizers to carry the process of crystallization as far as it will\r\ngo. These contain from 1000 to 1600 cubic feet of the crystallized\r\nmass which remains in them from 36 to 72 hours, during which time it\r\nis kept in constant motion by a set of slowly revolving paddles, or\r\narms, to facilitate further crystallization. From the crystallizers it\r\ngoes to the centrifugal machines, where the syrup is separated from the\r\ncrystals as before. The crystals are remelted and go in with the thick\r\njuice for white sugar. The syrup, still containing a large amount of\r\nsugar, goes out to be sold as cattle feed or to an Osmose or Steffens\r\nprocess, where a portion of the remaining sugar may be recovered. This\r\nlost syrup constitutes the largest loss in the entire process. It\r\ncontains all the impurities of the beet juice not removed by the lime.\r\nThese impurities prevent more than one and one-half times their weight\r\nof sugar from crystalizing, and make what is called molasses.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SEA OF BEET PULP.\r\n\r\nFor a century the high feeding value of sugar-beet pulp has been\r\nrecognized in Europe, but until a few years ago millions of tons of\r\nthis valuable by-product rotted about American beet-sugar factories, as\r\nshown above, because American farmers could not be made to believe it\r\npossessed sufficient value to pay for hauling it back to the farm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINE THAT FILLS, WEIGHS AND SEWS THE BAGS OF SUGAR\r\n\r\nSACKING ROOM.--SHOWING AUTOMATIC SCALES AND SEWING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nAfter the moisture has been thoroughly removed in the granulators\r\nor dryers, the sugar drops directly to the sacking room through\r\na chute, at the lower end of which the top of the double bag is\r\nattached. The sugar flows directly into the sack, the flow being cut\r\noff automatically with each 100 pounds, when an endless belt conveyor\r\npasses the upright sack past the sewing machine at the proper speed and\r\nthe product is sealed ready for storage or shipment.\r\n\r\nWhile it requires from 400 to 1000 men to man a factory, not a human\r\nhand has touched either beets or product since the beets were topped in\r\nthe field, and at no stage of the operation could flies or vermin or\r\nfilth come in contact with the product, which from the beginning has\r\nbeen subjected to continuous high temperatures.]\r\n\r\n  Pictures herewith by courtesy of United States Beet Sugar Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Can We Smell Things?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou do not need to be told what organ of the body we use in exercising\r\nthe sense of smell. You can prove that easily to yourself by getting\r\nthe nose within range of a distasteful smell.\r\n\r\nWe do not use all of the nose to smell with, and the nose is useful to\r\nus in other ways besides this. We use the nose a great deal in the act\r\nof respiration or breathing, and it is also useful in helping us to\r\nmake sounds, form words, and, though you may not have known it, helps\r\nour sense of taste.\r\n\r\nWe smell things by means of the olfactory nerves which are located\r\nwithin the nose. The entire interior surface of the nose is covered\r\nwith a membrane. The ends of olfactory nerves, or the nerves which give\r\nus the sensation of smell, are in this membrane, and the air, which is\r\nfilled with the odor of things we smell, passes over this membrane, and\r\nthus the ends of the nerves feel the odor and cause sensation of smell\r\nin the brain. The nerves of smell do not, however, go all through this\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nThere are other nerves in the nose, however, besides those which give\r\nus the sensation of smell. These are also very sensitive and serve to\r\nmake the nose exercise other functions when the inside of the nose is\r\nhurt or tickled. When a foreign substance, one of the many smaller\r\nparticles which are constantly floating in the air, gets into the\r\nmembrane in the nose, it irritates these nerves and often causes us\r\nto sneeze, which is only nature’s effort to drive out this foreign\r\nsubstance and clean out the nose. Smell is one of the lesser of the\r\nfive senses which we possess. It is one of what has been called the\r\nchemical senses. The sense of smell does not act at any great distance.\r\nThis sense could be made of more value to us if we developed it. Some\r\npeople have a more highly developed sense of smell than others. The\r\nlower animals have a much keener sense of smell than people. A great\r\nmany of them can follow a trail for miles merely by the smell of the\r\nfoot-prints, and it is said that a deer will note the presence of man\r\nor any other animal that may subject him to danger even when miles\r\naway, the odor being carried to him through the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do We Taste Things?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sense of taste is closely associated with the sense of smell. In\r\nfact we do a good deal of what we think is tasting by using our sense\r\nof smell. A cold in the nose will sometimes destroy almost altogether\r\nthe taste of food, so that there is a very close connection between the\r\nsense of taste and the sense of smell.\r\n\r\nThe sense of taste comes to us through the tongue, which is the\r\nprincipal organ of taste. The remainder of our sense of taste lies in\r\nthe surface of the palate and in the throat. As in the case of the\r\nother senses, the sensation of taste is given us through nerves, the\r\nends of which are all through those parts of the tongue, the palate\r\nand the throat, which contribute to this sense. More nerves of taste\r\nare located in the back part of the tongue than on the front, and it\r\nis said that when you have to swallow a bad dose of medicine it won’t\r\ntaste so much if you put it on the front part of your tongue and then\r\nswallow, because there are so few tasting nerves there. The extreme tip\r\nof the tongue, however, is very thickly covered with the ends of the\r\ntaste nerves. In like manner one could have the front end of the tongue\r\ncut off and still retain most of the sense of taste.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to produce the sensation of taste, the substance to be\r\ntasted must come in contact with something which mixes with it and\r\ncauses the sensation of taste. This is what happens when we taste\r\nanything. The juices or liquids which are caused to flow when anything\r\nis put into the mouth act on the substances which enter and give the\r\ntaste nerves a chance to taste them. Really the nerves of taste are so\r\nplaced in the mouth as to be regular guards or inspectors of what shall\r\ngo into the stomach. You can see how well they are arranged. In the tip\r\nof the tongue quite a few of them; in the back part of the tongue a\r\ngreat many nerves, for from there the food goes into the throat, which\r\ndelivers it to the stomach; then those in the palate and in the throat.\r\nThey are arranged so that the taste nerves have ample opportunity to\r\ntest what comes in and to give warning to the brain of what is being\r\nsent to the stomach. Sometimes the things that come into the mouth\r\nare so distasteful to the nerves of taste that they refuse to hand it\r\nover to the stomach, but instead cause the distasteful substance to be\r\nthrown out again immediately.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a good rule to follow in eating would be to swallow\r\nonly such things as are pleasing to the sense of taste. On this\r\nprinciple many children would decide to eat nothing but candy, but do\r\nyou know, if you tried that, the continuous tasting of sweets by our\r\nsense of taste nerves would cause them to repel further insertion of\r\ncandy after a while. You know that too much of a good thing is bad for\r\nyou, and that is what makes you feel badly when you have eaten too much\r\nof one thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens When We See?\r\n\r\n\r\n~HOW WE SEE THINGS~\r\n\r\nOf course, it is the eyes with which we see things. When we think of\r\nthe things with which we see, we think only of eyes, which give us our\r\nsense of vision, but there are certain forms of animal life which have\r\nno eyes but which have what are called eye spots or eye points, which\r\nare sensitive to light and which are merely spots. These eye spots\r\nmay be located in any part of the body, and are often found in great\r\nnumbers on the same body. These rude eyes are, however, not real eyes.\r\nThey are, as has already been said, sensitive to light, but are found\r\nonly in some of the very low forms of animal life which live in the\r\nwater. A real eye is an organ in which the parts are so arranged that\r\noptical images may be formed.\r\n\r\nAs animal life becomes developed to a higher scale, the parts which\r\ncontain the making of real eyes become more distinct although, of\r\ncourse, the eyes themselves are not so highly developed as in man. One\r\nof the first kinds of life which has eyes with a definite structural\r\ncharacter are the worms, snails, etc., though their sense of vision is\r\nmore or less dim.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the family of mollusks, however, low down in the scale\r\nof life though they are, we find them to possess eyes which enable them\r\nto see almost as well as animals which have a backbone, although this\r\nkind of eyes is constructed in a very different manner than the eyes\r\nof vertebrate animals referred to. As we ascend the scale of animal\r\nlife in the study of eyes, we come next to the crustaceous, which is an\r\nimportant division of animal life that embraces the crabs and lobsters,\r\nshrimps, crawfish, and insects such as sand-hoppers, beach-fleas,\r\nwood-lice, fish-lice, barnacles. The eyes of such animals are quite\r\ndeveloped, but the number that each will have varies. Some have only a\r\nsingle eye and others two, four, six or eight, but only certain kinds\r\nof this class of life have more than two eyes. The spiders generally\r\nhave the most.\r\n\r\nIn vertebrates, which is the class of animal life to which we belong,\r\nthe number of eyes is almost always two and no more. The eyes are\r\nformed in special sockets in the skull, which are called eye sockets\r\nor orbits. This arrangement of placing them in a socket is of great\r\nadvantage because the eye is thus protected from chance of injury\r\nexcept from one direction--the front. These animals have also eyelids,\r\neyebrows and eyelashes, which serve as a further protection to the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe principal parts of the eye are arranged in a globe-like ball called\r\nthe eyeball. This eyeball is movable in the socket under control of\r\nvarious muscles. The eyeball is almost surrounded by a membrane which\r\nis opaque in most parts, but very transparent at the front. This\r\ntransparent portion of the surrounding membrane is called the cornea,\r\nand is quite hard. This is the outside coat of the eye. The second\r\ncoat of membrane consists of parts of various names and contains the\r\niris. The third coat is the retina, which is the end of the optic nerve\r\nentering the eye full from behind and expanded into a membrane which\r\nspreads out over the second coat.\r\n\r\nThe retina or optic nerve receives optical impressions focused upon it\r\nby the crystalline lens. These impressions are carried along the optic\r\nnerve to the brain, and the brain then receives the sensation of seeing\r\nthe image. The eyeball is hollow, and its three surrounding coats\r\nform what is practically the same as the interior of a camera. The\r\ncrystalline lens of the eye acts the same as the lens in the camera.\r\nThis crystalline lens is suspended within the eyeball right in front of\r\nthe transparent opening in the front of the eyeball, and when the rays\r\nof light strike this lens it focuses them on the retina, which is the\r\nsame as the film in your camera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can We Hear?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can hear because nature has provided us with a very wonderful organ\r\ncalled the ear and which catches the sound waves that come through the\r\nair into the ear and make a part of the ear vibrate.\r\n\r\nIn man and mammals the ear is generally found on the outside of the\r\nbody, but the principal part of the ear is located within the skull.\r\nWhat we call ears are only the funnel-shaped extensions on the outside\r\nof the head which are not so very important so far as hearing is\r\nconcerned, because they only help the real ear to hear more easily. The\r\noutside of the ear gathers in the sound waves and, because it is much\r\nlarger than the little hole which takes the sounds in to the real ear,\r\nwe can detect more sounds by having this funnel-shaped arrangement on\r\nthe outside.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the ear contains an eardrum or tympanum which is\r\nseparated from the outside part of the ear by a membrane. Behind this\r\neardrum is the real hearing part of the ear in a labyrinth containing\r\nthe nerves of hearing.\r\n\r\nNow, when a sound wave strikes the membrane which hangs over the\r\nopening before the eardrum, the membrane vibrates and transmits the\r\nsound wave through the eardrum into the inner ear which contains the\r\nends of the nerves by which we hear. These nerves, on receiving the\r\nsensation, transmit it to the brain which thus records the impression\r\nof sounds.\r\n\r\nAs we descend the scale of animal life from the mammals downward, the\r\near becomes a more and more simple organ. In the vertebrates which\r\nare not mammals, there is no external ear at all, and we find great\r\nsimplifications of the ear the lower down in the scale we go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is a Totem Pole For?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore people had individual names, the savage people who lived in\r\nclans or tribes referred to themselves in the name of some natural\r\nobject, usually an animal which they assumed as the name or emblem\r\nof the clan or tribe. These names never applied to one individual\r\nmore than another, but only to the clan or tribe, so that everyone\r\nin a tribe which had taken the “wolf” for its emblem was known as\r\n“Wolf.” Later on they began to distinguish individuals by giving them\r\nadditional names characteristic of the individual, such as “Lonely\r\nWolf,” “Growling Wolf,” or other names. The name of this animal was\r\nthen the emblem of one tribe. They, therefore, placed this emblem upon\r\ntheir bodies, their clothes, utensils, etc. Through this, these emblems\r\nalso became at times idols of worship and so they erected poles upon\r\nwhich their emblems were engraved. The word totem is a North American\r\nIndian word meaning “family token.” The tribes called themselves after\r\nanimals from which they believed themselves descended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does a Flower Get Its Perfume?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perfume or smell of the flower comes from within the plant itself.\r\nThe perfume arises from an oil which the plant makes, and just as there\r\nare many kinds of flowers, so almost every flower has a different\r\nsmell. Of course, flowers belonging to the same family or species are\r\nlikely to develop different smells. The oils produced are what are\r\nknown as the volatile oils, which means “flying oils,” because, if\r\nextracted from the flower and placed in a bottle and the cork left out,\r\nthey will vanish into the air. Without this quality we could not, of\r\ncourse, smell them at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Flowers Have Perfumes?\r\n\r\n\r\nMan uses these oils to provide himself with perfumes, but the plant or\r\nflower has another purpose than this. The perfume is not made for man’s\r\nuse, but for the use of the plant itself. In the plant and flower world\r\nthe smell of the plant which is in the flower is a part of the scheme\r\nwhereby plants reproduce themselves.\r\n\r\nEvery plant in order to reproduce itself must produce a seed. The\r\nflowers are in most cases the advance agent of the coming seed. Each\r\nflower produces within itself a little powder called the pollen, but as\r\nplants are like people--also male and female--they are dependent upon\r\neach other for the production of a perfect seed. Some of the pollen\r\nfrom the male plant must be mixed with the pollen of the female plant\r\nbefore a perfect seed results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do Flowers Produce Seeds?\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturally, the nearest male plant to a female plant may be quite some\r\ndistance off. How, then, is the pollen from the male plant to mix with\r\nthe pollen of the female plant? In some cases it is the wind which\r\nblows the pollen powder from one to the other, and this thus leaves the\r\ndevelopment of a perfect seed from a perfect flower open to chance. In\r\nthe case of perfumed flowers, however, which are mostly low-growing\r\nplants, the wind cannot be depended upon. So nature gives to such\r\nplants the power to make the perfumed oil and the busy bee does the\r\nrest. The perfume being a flying oil rises up into the air and attracts\r\nthe bee. He is gathering honey and visits in turn all the flowers to\r\nwhich he is attracted. He lights on a male flower and gathers in his\r\nhoney, and incidentally acquires on his legs, without intending to do\r\nso, some of the pollen of the male flower. Then he flies about to the\r\nnext flower, and to others, and sooner or later he will come across a\r\nfemale flower of the same kind as that from which he secured the pollen\r\non his legs. When he thus enters the female flower, the pollen on his\r\nlegs mixes with the pollen of the same kind of the female flower, and\r\nquite unintentionally the bee helps thus to make the perfect seed. It\r\nis not a part of a bee’s business to do this carrying. It only happens\r\nthat he does this in connection with his regular business of gathering\r\nhoney. It is a wonderful thing which may be noted here that the pollen\r\nfrom a male of any flower will not mix with the pollen of the female of\r\nany other kind of flower, but that the same kinds only have attractions\r\nfor each other. Flowers are given these attractive perfumes in order\r\nthat they may attract the bees and other insects in this way. The\r\nplants or flowers which grow closest to the ground have generally the\r\nstrongest and most far-reaching smells. This is so that they will not\r\nbe overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Leaves Not All the Same Shape?\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaves are of different shapes because they belong to different\r\nfamilies of plants or trees. They are a good deal like people in this\r\nrespect. Hardly two people in the world look exactly alike, but there\r\nis a distinct family resemblance in members of the same family. It is\r\ndifficult to say just what happens inside the tree to determine the\r\nshape of the leaf and that causes them to possess different shapes\r\nfrom others. The shape of the leaf is a mark of identification of the\r\nfamily to which the tree or plant belongs, just as you can tell from a\r\ndog’s ears and from other characteristics what his breeding has been.\r\nIn the case of plants and trees however it is quite probable that the\r\nshape and texture of the leaves has been developed as the result of\r\nthe conditions under which the plant grows. A plant or tree throws\r\noff oxygen and takes in carbonic acid gas through the surface of the\r\nleaves. To thrive and be healthy it must secure just the proper amount\r\nof this food and as the quantity of food taken in depends upon the\r\namount of surface exposed through the leaves, each particular tree or\r\nplant has developed in its own direction in this respect until this\r\nfeature of their structures has been adjusted properly to their needs.\r\nIt is a good deal like the radiation of heat in your home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Some Radiators Longer Than Others?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the plumber gets ready to put in the radiators in the home he\r\nfigures the cubic measurements of the room and then puts in a radiator,\r\nthe outside surface of whose pipes, is in the right proportion to throw\r\noff sufficient heat to fill the room or heat all the air in the room.\r\nIt requires a certain number of square inches of radiator surface to\r\nheat each cubic foot of air space and a good plumber can figure this\r\nto a nicety. If he puts in a radiator however that has not sufficient\r\nnumber of square inches on the outside of the pipes, the room will\r\nnot be heated properly. In the same way, the trees, require that\r\ntheir leaves have a certain amount of square inches of surface space\r\nin proportion to the size of the tree, to enable them to do what is\r\nrequired of them and this is arranged by nature so that the trees grow\r\nnaturally, and no doubt the shape of the leaves has something to do\r\nwith this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Roses Red?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll roses are not red. Some are white and others pink or of still\r\nanother color. The color of the rose, and in fact the color of all\r\nflowers is due to the way they absorb and reflect the sunlight. In the\r\ncase of the red rose, the something in the plant that determines the\r\ncolor, absorbs all the other colors in the sunlight and reflects the\r\npure red rays and that makes the color of the red rose. You cannot see\r\nthe color of any flower when it is perfectly dark. That is because they\r\nhave no color of their own, but only the colors which they reflect when\r\nin the sunlight or some other light. The question of colors is more\r\nfully explained in another part of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Plants and Trees Grow Up Instead of Down?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact plants and trees do grow downward as well as up.\r\nThere is a part of each called the root whose business it is to grow\r\ndown and take certain things necessary to the life of the tree out of\r\nthe ground. But the part we see above the ground and which is the part\r\nwe generally think of only when we think of plants or trees.\r\n\r\nThe tree or plant, in order to grow properly, and eventually produce\r\nflowers and perfect seeds, must have sunshine and carbonic acid gas,\r\nand it is the business of the leaves and other parts above the ground\r\nto get these out of the air for the good of the plant or tree. So they\r\nstart to grow toward the sun. It is easy to prove how a plant will turn\r\ntoward the light. Take notice of the plants in the flower pots at home.\r\nSet one of them on the window sill inside the window where the sun can\r\nshine on it and notice how quickly the leaves and branches will be bent\r\nover against the window pane. Turn it completely around then so that\r\nthe plant leans away from the sunlight and watch it for a day or two.\r\nBefore long you will find that it has not only straightened itself\r\ncompletely out but started to lean toward the window glass again so\r\nas to get as near the sun as possible. Most plants, if kept where the\r\nsunlight cannot touch them, will die. The sunlight is a necessary part\r\nof their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Becomes of the Plants and Flowers in Winter?\r\n\r\n\r\nA great many, in fact the large percentage of plants, live only during\r\none season. This kind of plant actually dies completely after, in the\r\nnatural course of growth and flowering, it has produced its seed which\r\nis the method by which such plants are reproduced. Other plants only\r\nappear to die in the winter. Parts of them, such as the leaves and\r\nflowers actually die, but the roots and stalks of such plants do not\r\ndie in winter. The part that represents the life in them goes to sleep\r\nand lies dormant until the light and warmth of summer bring forth the\r\nleaves and flowers again.\r\n\r\nThe flowers, however, always die and the same flowers never appear\r\nagain but others just like them appear in their places.\r\n\r\nEven in hot countries where there is no winter, the plants must go\r\nthrough a period of rest or sleep, although this change is not so\r\nmarked in plants which grow in these hot countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Can Some Plants Climb a Smooth Wall?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get at the answer to this question, we should pick out one kind\r\nof plant like the creeping ivy vine. If we examine same as it climbs\r\na brick wall, we find that it sends out little shoots which attach\r\nthemselves around the little rough places in the bricks of the wall\r\nwhich, if examined under a microscope are quite large apparently--at\r\nleast they are large enough for the tiny creepers of the ivy to hold on\r\nto. Of course, if there were only one little “shoot” to reach out and\r\ntake hold of the rough spots in the wall, the vine could not cling to\r\nthe wall, but the vine puts out a great many of these shoots--which it\r\nwould perhaps be best to call “clingers” and as each helps a little to\r\nhold on, the great number all holding on together enable a quite heavy\r\nvine to hang on to an apparently smooth wall.\r\n\r\nSome vines have actually the ability to send out little suckers which\r\nare made on the same principle as the boys’ sucker (a circular piece of\r\nleather with string attached to the middle with which a boy can pick up\r\nstones) and such plants can cling to and climb up an almost perfectly\r\nsmooth wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are the Thorns on Roses and Other Plants Good For?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thorns of roses and other plants which have thorns originally grew\r\nfor the purpose of enabling the plants to fasten themselves on to\r\nother things thus helping them to climb. Many plants with thorns are\r\npermitted to grow now in places where they can use their thorns for\r\nclimbing but many others with thorns are cut down by the gardener to\r\nmake the plants shapely and to make them produce more flowers and less\r\nbranches, but they keep on growing their thorns just the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Plants Breathe?\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, plants do breathe. To breathe is just as important to the\r\nlife of a plant as it is to a boy or girl. Plants do not have lungs\r\nlike boys and girls and grown up people, but they find it necessary to\r\nbreathe. You know, of course, that fishes breathe, but they haven’t any\r\nlungs either, even though they belong to the animal kingdom. Fishes\r\ndo not, however, breathe the air in the same form as we do because\r\nthey must use the air which they find in the water. That is why we say\r\nfishes drown when on the land. They cannot breathe air in the form in\r\nwhich we are able to use it any more than people can breathe the air in\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nBreathing, however, is necessary to all living things and the gas which\r\nwe take in when breathing is oxygen. There is oxygen in the water as\r\nwell as in the air. Things which live in the air take their oxygen out\r\nof the air and things which live in the water get their oxygen out of\r\nthe water. For this purpose it is necessary for plants and animals that\r\nlive under the water to have a breathing apparatus especially adapted\r\nfor getting oxygen out of the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens When Breathing Occurs?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe act of breathing consists really of two actions. Taking something\r\ninto the body and expelling something. Every living thing inhales and\r\nexpels in breathing. We take in oxygen and expel it again but when it\r\ncomes out it has added something to it and the combination or result is\r\ncarbonic acid gas--so we take in oxygen and expel carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do Plants Breathe?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lungs of a plant, or what the plant breathes with corresponding to\r\nour lungs, are located in the leaves of the plant. Under a magnifying\r\nglass we can see the lungs of the leaf quite clearly. In addition to\r\nthis we know that plants breathe, because if we put them in a vacuum\r\nwhere there is no air they die very quickly. The plant needs air or\r\nit will suffocate just as any animal will suffocate under similar\r\nconditions. Plants, however, do not make use of the oxygen as they\r\nfind it in the air. They live on the carbon which they find in the\r\nair mixed with oxygen. What happens then is this. The plants take in\r\nthrough their lungs in the leaves carbonic acid gas from which they\r\ntake the carbon and use it as food, and throw off the oxygen which\r\nthey cannot use. Human beings and other animals take the oxygen into\r\ntheir lungs and use it and expel carbonic acid gas. The result is that\r\neach kind of life is dependent upon the other. If it were not for the\r\nplant life, men and other animals would find it difficult perhaps to\r\nfind sufficient oxygen in the air to keep them alive, and if it were\r\nnot for the carbonic acid gas which the animals throw off, plants and\r\nother vegetable life would have great difficulty in finding sufficient\r\ncarbonic acid gas to go around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Plants Need Sunlight?\r\n\r\n\r\nMost plants, if placed where no light from the sun can reach them, will\r\ndie very quickly. To prove that a plant needs the sunlight we have\r\nonly to place it in a dark corner of the cellar and notice how soon it\r\ndies. In fact if it were not for sunlight there would be no life on\r\nearth at all. The plant or tree drinks in sunlight through the surface\r\nof the leaves. In fact the ability to take in sunlight constitutes the\r\nreal life of the tree or plant. Leaves grow thin and flat in order\r\nthat as much surface as possible may be exposed to the sunlight. If\r\na leaf were curled up like a hoop only a part of the outside surface\r\nwould be exposed to the sunlight and the amount of life that a leaf\r\ncould supply to the rest of the tree would be much less. The leaf is so\r\nconstructed that when the sunlight strikes down upon its green surface,\r\nit changes the carbonic acid gas which it drinks in, into its elements,\r\ni.e., it takes out the carbon which goes into the body of the plant and\r\ncombining with other food and water supplied by the roots causes the\r\nplant or tree to grow and then returns the oxygen part of the carbonic\r\nacid gas to the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Milk Turn Sour?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe milk turns sour because a little microbe, known as the milk microbe\r\ngets into it, and being very fond of the sugar which is in the milk,\r\nturns this sugar into an acid.\r\n\r\nIf we could keep milk entirely away from the air after the cow is\r\nmilked, it would not turn sour, but as soon as it is exposed to the air\r\nthese microbes which are constantly in the air, drop into the milk.\r\nThey are alive, although invisible to the naked eye. If when they drop\r\ninto the milk it is warm enough for them to get in their work so to\r\nspeak, they fall upon the sugar in the milk and turn it into the acid.\r\nTheir attempt to sour the milk can be overcome by keeping the milk at a\r\nlow temperature in the refrigerator, but as soon as the milk is taken\r\nout of the refrigerator and left out long enough to become warm, the\r\nmicrobe begins to work and the milk cannot be made sweet again. If the\r\nmilk is boiled as soon or shortly after the cow is milked, the sugar in\r\nthe milk is changed in such a way that the microbe cannot feed upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PERSIAN RUG WEAVER AT WORK.[3]]\r\n\r\n  [3] Pictures and descriptions by courtesy of Hartford Carpet Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Rug\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are Carpets and Rugs Made Of?\r\n\r\nThe choicest wool of the world is used in the manufacture of carpet.\r\nIn order to give satisfactory service carpet must be made of wool that\r\nis of a tough quality and has a long fiber. Such wool is not produced\r\nin America, and the markets of the distant lands that supply it are\r\npractically exhausted to supply the American manufacturers. Most of the\r\nwool used comes from Northern Russia, Siberia and China. It is shipped\r\nin bales. When it arrives at the mill there is much to be done before\r\nthe wool is ready for any process of manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Long Have People Used Carpets?\r\n\r\nThe art of weaving stands foremost among the ancient industries. It\r\ncame into being in the sunrise lands of the East where color has\r\nendless charm and variety and where figure is made to serve the purpose\r\nof fact and fancy. The art of weaving rugs is older than Egyptian\r\ncivilization. Stone carvings made when Egypt was yet unborn were\r\nreproduced in rugs.\r\n\r\nAt what period the loom was first used is impossible to tell. An\r\nancient Jewish legend claims that Naamah, daughter of Tubal-Cain, was\r\nthe inventor of the process of weaving threads into cloth. There are\r\nother indications that the ancient Hebrews were the first weavers.\r\nMythology also tells of beautiful maidens weaving exquisite patterns\r\nfor the gods. Most of us are familiar with the story of Jason who set\r\nsail on the Argo in search of the Golden Fleece, arrived at the kingdom\r\nof Aeetes, won the hand of Medea, the daughter of Aeetes, who eloped\r\nwith him after he had secured the coveted fleece.\r\n\r\nThe first hands busy at the weaving craft undoubtedly were those of\r\nwomen. Chaldean gossip, repeated in history relates that Sardanphulees,\r\nan ancient Greek king, was often seen in woman’s garb carding purple\r\nwool from which his wives wrought rugs for floor coverings for the\r\npalace. Homer shows Helen of Troy setting the tale of her people’s\r\nwar in the woof of her web, and also tells with Virgil of rugs that\r\nwere laid under the thrones of kings or upon chariot horses. Ancient\r\nHindu hymns show that these people made their textile fabrics studies\r\nof great beauty. The woman in the Proverbs of Solomon says: “I have\r\nwoven my bed with cords; I have covered it with painted tapestry from\r\nEgypt.” One learns from the writings of Pliny of the large money value\r\nof rugs in ancient times. He wrote at length of a vast rug displayed at\r\na banquet of Ptolemy Philadelphius, the value of which was placed at a\r\nfabulous sum.\r\n\r\nA later writer tells of the love of Cleopatra for rich rugs and\r\ntapestries that were woven in her palace or in the countries to the\r\nEast. On the occasions of her meeting with Cæsar and Antony, the\r\nEgyptian queen enveloped herself in a superb rug which she had woven\r\nespecially for the purpose of showing her renowned beauty to the best\r\nadvantage. Akhar, emperor of Hindostan, spread a knowledge of the art\r\nof weaving throughout India.\r\n\r\nThe earlier phases of the art of weaving may be traced through the\r\nland of the Pharaohs to Northern Africa, Southwestern Asia, and\r\nfinally into the dawn of the Aryan civilization. The loom has not been\r\nmaterially changed, and it may be seen to-day as it was in the time\r\nwhen the priests of Heliopolis decorated the shrines of their gods with\r\nmagnificent carpets and when Delilah wove the hair of Samson with her\r\nweb and fastened it with a wooden pin. The ancient weavers attained\r\nhigh artistic standards in their fabrics. Pliny tells of Babylonian\r\ncouch covers that had all the beauty of paintings and sold for great\r\nfortunes to the ancient Asiatic kings.\r\n\r\nIn all ages fine rugs have been used for religious purposes. Early\r\nwritings describe the use of rugs on the holy cars of pilgrimage to\r\nMecca, at the tomb of the prophet at Medinah and throughout the mosques\r\nof the Orient. The abbot Egelric gave to the church at Croyland, before\r\nthe year 892, two large rugs to be laid before the high altar on great\r\nfestivals. At later periods rugs were used for similar purposes in the\r\ncathedrals of Southern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental people ever have been devoted to symbols and naturally\r\nwove them into their fabrics. Their textiles were made to reproduce\r\nmythological stories in which the fauna and flora of a country figured\r\nprominently. There was the symbolism of form, color and animal life,\r\nof trees and flowers, of faith, and earthly and heavenly existence.\r\nThe symbols were made to illustrate the conflict between light and\r\ndarkness, the evolution of life, the decay of death and the immortality\r\nthat awaits the blessed in paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Do the Designs in Rugs Mean?\r\n\r\nSince many of the figures of ancient rug-weaving are retained in modern\r\nrug designs, the following list of meanings of ancient Oriental symbols\r\nused in rug-weaving may be interesting as a key to the stories that are\r\nsaid to appear in many rugs of Oriental design:\r\n\r\n  Asp--intelligence\r\n  Bat--duration\r\n  Bee--immortality\r\n  Beetle--earthly life\r\n  Blossom--life\r\n  Boat--serene spirit\r\n  Butterfly--soil\r\n  Crescent--celestial virgin\r\n  Crocodile--deity\r\n  Dove--love\r\n  Eagle--creation\r\n  Egg--life\r\n  Feather--truth\r\n  Goose--child\r\n  Lizard--wisdom\r\n  Palm tree--immortality\r\n  Sail of vessel--breath\r\n  Wheel--deity\r\n  Lion--power\r\n  Ass--humility\r\n  Butterfly--beneficence of summer\r\n  Jug--knowledge\r\n  Ox--patience\r\n  Hawk--power\r\n  Lotus--the sun\r\n  Pine-cone--fire\r\n  Zigzag--water\r\n  Leopard--fame\r\n  Sword--force\r\n  Serpent--desire\r\n  Bird--spirit\r\n  Owl--wisdom\r\n  Pig--kindness\r\n\r\nSuch are the traditions that the makers of modern rugs must live up to.\r\nThe art of the centuries has been revealed in the rugs of many nations,\r\nand the rug-maker of to-day must uphold the standards of an art that\r\nundoubtedly takes rank with the great arts. Where a valuable painting\r\ngoes into the home of one millionaire, thousands of rugs made from\r\nan original design of unquestioned art and beauty go into homes the\r\ncountry over to give warmth, comfort and beauty, delighting housewives\r\nand imparting a sense of coziness and elegance.\r\n\r\nAccording to students of the art of weaving, the perfection of this\r\nart was attained about the sixteenth century, after many centuries of\r\nslow growth. Since then weaving as an art has been broadened and given\r\na wider scope by means of processes invented for a cheaper production\r\nof rugs in all the beauty of their original designs. But there also has\r\ndeveloped a modern school of rug and carpet designing that in itself\r\nrepresents no mean standard of art. Many of the less expensive grades\r\nof American rugs and carpets, for example, are of designs created by\r\nartists of this modern school of weaving designs whose work is of a\r\nhigh degree of artistic excellence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW OUR GRANDMOTHERS MADE RAG CARPETS\r\n\r\nMAKING THE OLD RAG CARPET.]\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago many homes had rugs woven by the housewives\r\nwith their spinning-wheels, or no floor coverings, except crude\r\ncloths made of rags. These homes, of course, were those of families\r\nin moderate circumstances, which to-day can have their attractive and\r\ncomfort-giving rugs of the less expensive grades of tapestry carpet,\r\nAxminster or of the various other grades of carpet manufactured at a\r\nrange of prices within the financial reach of people of modest means.\r\n\r\nIt is only a step from the ancient weaving of rugs, with all the color,\r\nglamor and romance that attached to rug-weaving in the ancient days, to\r\nthe manufacture of rugs in America to-day. There is no romance attached\r\nto the making of rugs and carpets in America, except the romance of\r\nindustrial achievement; but the American rug-maker is as careful of the\r\nquality and beauty of his product as was the ancient weaver, and the\r\nbest standards of ancient weaving have been realized in the manufacture\r\nof rugs and carpets in America to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Did the Ancients Make Rugs?\r\n\r\nIt is only a rug, several yards of woven threads, a design that few\r\ncan understand--a simple thing, to be sure; yet what a lot of history\r\nand memories and traditions it carries! Merely a strip of carpet, with\r\nstrange figures, beautiful though meaningless, a product of modern\r\ninvention like many another, some may think. But the story of a rug may\r\ngo back through many centuries to ancient times of opulent splendor,\r\nwhen wars were waged and kingdoms created and shattered for the beauty\r\nof a woman; when gorgeous palaces were raised and great spectacles of\r\nart were shown to inspire the world for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nOnly a rug, but a relic of a rich and glowing past! For in those\r\ndistant days of war and pageantry, an era more classic than our own,\r\nhistory and romance were woven into the rug. The patterns and designs\r\ntold great stories of wars and loves that swept nations away and\r\ncreated great new empires and related vivid accounts of intrigue and\r\ntragedy that determined history and inspired the immortal works of\r\npoets and dramatists. The rug in the ancient times was also used for\r\nreligious symbolism, and sacred doctrines were inscribed in the woven\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nOf all the arts none has been as close to the lives and history of the\r\npeoples of the earth as the art of weaving. Songs and stories of these\r\npeoples and their national achievements have been immortalized through\r\ntheir woven fabrics. Generations have learned of the great deeds of\r\ntheir forefathers through the historical accounts woven into rugs. And\r\nin the days of the early Greeks, Hebrews and Egyptians and on through\r\nthe succeeding centuries until the middle ages the rug was used as a\r\nsymbolical part of state, religious and romantic ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Some Rugs so Valuable?\r\n\r\nThe reason many rugs are valued at so high a price in money is largely\r\ndue to the skill of the artist or designer, just as a painting becomes\r\nvaluable because the artist who painted it has succeeded in producing a\r\nremarkable result. The question of rarity also enters largely into the\r\nvalue of rugs. The great artist weavers of the past who worked for love\r\nof their art rather than for the money they might secure by disposing\r\nof their masterpieces, are dead, and they have had no successors.\r\nThen, also, the rug becomes valuable by reason of the amount of time\r\nand labor put into it. Many valuable rugs take years to produce,\r\nbecause the artist must do all his work by hand practically and tie his\r\ndifferent colored yarns together just so, or the pattern will not come\r\nright. These knots may occur every inch or sometimes even less than an\r\ninch, and there will be thousands of hand knots in one rug.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING TURKISH RUGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLDER THEY ARE THE MORE HIGHLY PRIZED\r\n\r\nThe above is a typical Chinese rug, containing symbolical emblems.\r\n\r\nThis is an antique and is of a class that sells sometimes as high as\r\n$5,000, its rarity of design, beauty in colors, and scarcity enhances\r\nits value.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is an American machine-made interpretation of a\r\nChinese rug.

The general effect is handsome, although the design is crude.\r\nThe ground is of a deep rich red, and top colors of dark blue and ecru.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable Persian rugs come from Kurdistan, Khurasan, Peraghan\r\nand Karman. The most highly prized come from Kurdistan. The pattern\r\ndoes not show a uniform ground of flowers or other objects, but\r\nlooks more like a field of wild flowers in the spring, which is very\r\nappropriate as a design for anything that is to be walked upon. It\r\nis astonishing what wonderful artistic ability is displayed by some\r\nof the members of these wild nomadic Persian people. The carpets and\r\nrugs are woven on a simple frame on which the warp is stretched. The\r\nwoof, or cross threads, consist of short threads woven into the warp\r\nwith the fingers and without the use of a shuttle. Then a sort of comb\r\nis pressed against the loose row of cross threads to tighten it. The\r\nweaver sits with the back of the rug towards him, so that he depends\r\nentirely on his memory to produce a perfect pattern.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This rug is an American copy of a typical Kurdistan.

The design is\r\nvery interesting on account of the symbolical figures which cover the\r\nground.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOOL-PICKING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Making of Carpets\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are Modern Rugs and Carpets Made?\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn of this is for us to take a brief visit to one\r\nof the largest carpet factories, where we will assume we have already\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nThere is a sharp whistle, then an outlet of steam, the clang of a bell\r\nand a locomotive rolls around the curve of the spur-track into the\r\nfactory yard. Attached to it are several freight cars that only the\r\nday before received their cargoes at the New York docks fresh from\r\nsteamships coming from foreign lands. Inside the yard, the engine comes\r\nto a stop alongside a warehouse. Sturdy men unlock the doors of the\r\ncars and begin pulling out bales of the imported wool.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step in the evolution of a rug. Between the arrival\r\nof the rough wool at the warehouse and the placing in the stock room\r\nof the finished rug, splendidly woven after an artistic design shown\r\nin attractive colors, many interesting processes are followed. It is\r\nsufficient to state that few people looking at rugs of the Saxony,\r\nor Axminster or Tapestry type realize the high degree of mechanical\r\nscience and artistic perception that have been brought to bear in the\r\nmanufacture of these rugs.\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of the wool there are many steps to be taken until\r\nthe skeins of yarn receive their coloring treatment in the dye-house\r\nand, at the bidding of the great machine, assemble themselves in the\r\nbeautiful designs that the artists have created. Though there are\r\nmany details of work in the development of a rug, they have been so\r\nwell mastered that the employes in charge of every stage of the rug’s\r\nevolution give to their work a nicety of attention in little time that\r\ncareful training and scientific understanding alone can supply.\r\n\r\nThe travel-stained covers of the bales are removed. The heavy bulk is\r\nbroken and the tightly-compressed bales loosened. Then the wool is fed\r\ninto the washing-machine, and after that goes into the picking-machine.\r\nThe process of cleansing the wool is an elaborate one, for it is so\r\nfull of dirt and grease that several waters and several operations are\r\nnecessary to its final appearance in a white and fleecy condition.\r\nAfter the last washing the wool is lifted to a drying-room, where the\r\nheat from steam-coils is forced through it by means of blowers.\r\n\r\nThe wool now passes to the sorting-room, where the blends are carefully\r\nmade before it goes to the machine which tears the wool fibers apart,\r\nand gets them in shape for the carding and combing processes. Next\r\nthe wool is blown into a spinning mill. The wool is now ready to be\r\nconverted into yarn. It passes through a picking-machine, which blends\r\nthe different grades of the raw material, selecting the strands as to\r\nfiber and color. Then it is refined and purified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARDING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nThrough tubes the wool is forced to the carding-room by means of air\r\npressure. In passing through the cards it is carefully weighed to\r\nsecure evenness in the yarn. Leaving the carding machine, the wool\r\nis taken to the floor above, where the big spools of yarn reach the\r\ncombing machine for the next process. This machine separates the long\r\nfrom the short fibers. The strands of wool are still thick and must go\r\nthrough another process before they are ready to be made into yarn.\r\nThey are finally united and given sufficient strength to stand the\r\nweaving process. As the visitor sees the strands of yarn first appear\r\non the machine they resemble rolls of smoke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYEING THE YARN]\r\n\r\n~HOW THE YARN FOR CARPETS IS DYED~\r\n\r\nThe yarn next appears on rows of spindles in the mule-room, six hundred\r\nfeet long, where the yarn is twisted and brought to its final stage.\r\nThe yarn now is ready for the dye-house. Here the atmosphere is very\r\ndense. Clouds of steam rise from the many vats of boiling dyes. The\r\nyarn receives the coloring for which it is intended, or is bleached\r\nin an adjoining department, and then is transferred on poles to the\r\ndrying-room, after passing through a steaming process which sets the\r\ncolor. Next it passes on an electric conveyor to the weave-shop.\r\n\r\nConsiderable skill is required in the weaving process. The assembling\r\nof the yarns and matching of colors require expert attention. The\r\nskeins of yarn are wound on spools, which are put in sets back of the\r\nlooms, each color or set representing one “frame” of color in the rug.\r\nBy the famous Jacquard motion of cards each color wanted in the surface\r\nof the rug is pulled up in its proper place, the other frame color\r\nlaying in the back of the rug. The mechanical process is a remarkable\r\nsight. As the pattern forms itself from the mechanical devices, the\r\nonlooker is struck with the wonder of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW A CARPET IS WOVEN BY MACHINERY\r\n\r\nWEAVING A RUG BY MACHINERY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10,000,000 YARDS OF CARPET PER YEAR FROM ONE FACTORY\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the plant of one of the largest carpet factories in\r\nthe United States at Thompsonville, Conn. From the looms of these mills\r\nare annually produced ten-million yards of the twenty-five different\r\ngrades of carpet manufactured by this concern.\r\n\r\nImagine a strip of carpet across the United States at its widest\r\npart, the Forty-second latitude--a strip of “Hartford Saxony”, say,\r\nstretching from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific coast; and then\r\nanother carpet strip the length of the United States, where this\r\ncountry is the longest--i. e., from the Northern boundary of the\r\nstate of Minnesota to the Southern boundary of the state of Texas;\r\nthen imagine one more strip stretching from Chicago to New Orleans,\r\nand finally a connection between the two latter strips at about the\r\nvicinity of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nWith a mental picture of this vast country thus stripped with carpet,\r\nyou wonder if there is that much carpet in the world. It seems\r\nincredible that this great sweep of land could be measured with\r\ncarpet--and yet enough material comes every year from the looms of one\r\ncarpet factory alone in this country to strip the United States East\r\nand West, and North and South as indicated above.]\r\n\r\nThe weave is now completed; the rug comes out. But it is rough and\r\nhas to be finished. It is passed through a machine that removes the\r\nroughness of the face as a lawn-mower cuts away the top-grass. The ends\r\nare finished, and the carpet is complete.\r\n\r\n~SOME DESIGNS STAMPED ON YARN BEFORE WEAVING~\r\n\r\nThe pattern of tapestry carpet is obtained by printing the colors\r\nto appear in the design on the yarn which forms the face before the\r\nweaving is started, by means of large drums. After all rugs leave the\r\nweave-shop a force of skilled women examine them carefully to make sure\r\nthat there are no defects. Every yard of the annual output of carpet\r\nand rugs is inspected five times before it leaves the factory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXAMINING AND REPAIRING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACKING FOR SHIPMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do I Yawn?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you yawn, you do so because you have not been breathing quite\r\nproperly and for some reason or other your blood supply has not been\r\ngetting sufficient oxygen through the air which has been taken into\r\nyour lungs. Nature’s way, in this instance, is to call for a big intake\r\nof air all at one time, and since it is important at such times that a\r\nlarge quantity of air should be supplied to the lungs at once, nature\r\nhas so arranged matters that certain muscles shall cause you to open\r\nyour mouth wide and take in as much air as you can at one time, and\r\nalso has arranged so that it is almost impossible to keep from yawning\r\nwhen the demand for it is once made. The yawn is controlled by a part\r\nof our nerve structure which looks after the breathing apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction we feel after a wholesome yawn is due to the fact that\r\nhaving replied to nature’s demand that we bring in more air, our blood\r\nsecures the oxygen which it needs and we feel the effect of better\r\nblood in our arteries at once.\r\n\r\nA peculiar thing about the process of yawning is that one person in\r\na room yawning will quite likely set all or nearly all the others to\r\nyawning also. There seems to be no explanation of this excepting that\r\nwhen a number of people are in one room and one of them begins to\r\nyawn, the others do so, not because they perceive the first yawn so\r\nmuch as the probable fact that the air in the room has become so poor\r\nthat there is not enough good air for all the people in it, breathing\r\nnormally, and many of them are forced to yawn at about the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Do Living Things Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a big subject, but a very interesting one. To understand it\r\nfully we must begin at the very beginning of the world.\r\n\r\nGod made first of all the rocks, the mountains, the sun, the moon, the\r\nstars, the soil, and put the water in the lakes, rivers and oceans.\r\nThis took a long time, but they had to be there before the living\r\nthings could begin to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Inorganic Matter?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis thing we have spoken of is called inorganic matter, which means\r\n“without life,” and everything in the world which has no life is called\r\ninorganic matter. These things do not die, and for that reason do not\r\nhave to be replaced. The form and appearance of inorganic matter and\r\nits location is often changed by man or other causes, but even when man\r\nburns the coal which he has dug up out of the ground in the furnace, no\r\npart of it is destroyed. Some of it is turned into smoke and gas and\r\nsome of it is turned into ashes, while every other particle which went\r\nto make up the coal originally is still in existence. It remains as\r\ninorganic matter in some form or other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Did Life Begin on Earth?\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the inorganic things had been made and the earth was ready for\r\nlife, the different kinds of living things which we find on the earth\r\nbegan to exist. These are called organic objects, which means objects\r\n“with life.” The first living things to appear were the bushes, the\r\ngrass, the garden vegetables, the flowers, trees, and all the kinds of\r\nlife which we ordinarily think of as growing things.\r\n\r\nThis division of living things makes up what we call the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and in a general way of classing it is the kind of life\r\nwhich cannot move about from place to place and which has not a sense\r\nof feeling, or any of the other senses, seeing, hearing, tasting or\r\nsmelling.\r\n\r\nAfter this division of life had been established the world was ready\r\nfor the other and more important form of life--the fishes, the birds,\r\ncats, dogs, horses, cows, with others that we call domestic animals,\r\nand also the lions, tigers, elephants and others which constitute the\r\ndivision of wild animals.\r\n\r\nThis kind of life was given some or all of the five senses, but not\r\nall classes of animal life possess all these senses. Some of the lower\r\nforms of animal life, like the oysters, clams, in the fish family,\r\ncannot see, hear, smell or taste. They can only feel; others are able\r\nto do more of these things, and many have all of the five senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Did Man Begin to Live?\r\n\r\n\r\nMan was not created until all the other living things on earth had been\r\nstarted, and he was given additional powers so that he might become the\r\nruler of all the other living things, principally because he was given\r\na brain with power to think, reason and originate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Must Life Be Reproduced?\r\n\r\n\r\nLife must be reproduced because living things die. They have power to\r\nlive only for a certain length of time. The other life in the world is\r\nused to provide food for man, and if there were no way of reproducing\r\nlife it would not be long before man had eaten all the vegetables and\r\nthe animals too, and would himself then starve to death.\r\n\r\nTo avoid such a calamity God put into each living thing, both\r\nvegetables and animals, a power to cause other things of the same kind\r\nas itself to grow. This is called the power of reproduction. With this\r\npower each kind of living thing can bring other specimens of the same\r\nkind into the world and each kind of living thing can do this without\r\naid from any other kind of life.\r\n\r\nThe trees, the flowers, and other kinds of vegetable life would\r\nreproduce themselves without the aid of man, as would also the fishes\r\nand other kinds of animal life. Man, however, just to have things\r\nconveniently at hand, uses his power over other life to cause his\r\nvegetables to grow near where he lives, and keep the animals which he\r\nwishes to use as food in some place where he doesn’t have to hunt for\r\nthem every time he wishes meat for his table. This, however, he does\r\nonly with the animals which he has domesticated or tamed. When he wants\r\nmeat from the animals which are still wild he must hunt for them as he\r\nused to do.\r\n\r\nEach kind of life has the power, however, to reproduce only its own\r\nkind. If you plant a peach stone you will sooner or later have a peach\r\ntree which will bear peaches, and these peaches from the young tree\r\nwill look and taste just like the peach whose pit or stone you planted.\r\nThere may be other kinds of fruit trees all about, and also trees which\r\ndo not bear fruit. All of the trees secure the food upon which they\r\nlive and grow from the same soil. Even the grass under your peach tree\r\neats the same things as your peach tree, but it remains always true\r\nthat things in the vegetable kingdom will grow only to be like the\r\nthing from which it came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave Plants Fathers and Mothers?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little trees grow up to be exactly like their fathers and mothers\r\n(for they have fathers and mothers), which is something all living\r\nthings must have. These are not the same kind of fathers, or mothers\r\neither, that a boy or girl has, exactly, but they are parents just the\r\nsame. So far as the trees, flowers and plants are concerned we call the\r\nparents father and mother natures, which is a term used merely to keep\r\nyou from confusing vegetable life fathers and mothers with the regular\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom you cannot always see these father and mother\r\nnatures, which enable them to reproduce their kind of life, but\r\neverything in the vegetable and also in the animal kingdom has them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do Plants Reproduce Life?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring we put seeds into the ground and later on plants grow up\r\nwhere the seeds were planted, and later the flowers come. The seeds\r\ncontain the baby plants, which come to life, and after bursting the\r\ncovering of the seed, unfold and grow up into plants if placed in the\r\nground, where they can obtain the proper amount of warmth and moisture\r\nto give them a start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Plants Have Seeds?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get at this subject in the best manner we must study first how\r\nplants produce seeds and what happens. The power in a plant to make\r\nanother plant like it grow comes from the flower. Ordinarily we think\r\nof the flowers as beautiful to look at and delightful to smell, but\r\nthe flowers do not grow for the mere purpose of being beautiful, but\r\nare for a more useful purpose--to develop a seed which, when planted,\r\nwill produce another plant. The machinery for producing a perfect\r\nseed is in the flower or blossom. Every flower has a definite plan of\r\nconstruction. The leaves and colors vary, but the plan for a perfect\r\nflower is always there. The petals which are generally colored are\r\ncalled the _crown_. When you pluck off the petals you see a number\r\nof green leaves at the bottom where the petals were attached. These\r\nform what is called the _calyx_, and help to hold the petals in place.\r\nInside the flower are little stems which grow to the petals. These are\r\ncalled _stamens_. Every one of these little stems is hollow, and if\r\nyou split one open you will discover a _fine powder_. This powder is\r\ncalled _pollen_, and is the “father” nature of the plant. In the calyx,\r\nthe part we had left after we plucked off the petals, is the “mother”\r\nnature of the plant. The main part of the mother nature is the stem of\r\nthe flower called the _ovary_, and this is where the seeds grow. These\r\nseeds in the ovary, however, will not become perfect seeds unless some\r\nof the pollen from the “father” nature of the plant touches them and\r\nfertilizes them.\r\n\r\nAt the proper age of the flower some of this pollen powder passes into\r\nthe ovary and fertilizes the seeds and makes them good seeds. This is\r\nonly one kind of flower, however. In this kind the father and mother\r\nnatures are in the same flower. In other kinds of plants the father and\r\nmother natures are found on different parts of the same plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does an Ear of Corn Have Silk?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe corn plant is one of this kind. You know what it looks like--a tall\r\nplant, generally six or seven feet high. The ears of corn grow out of\r\nthe side of the corn stalk. The ear is covered with husks and out of\r\nthe end of the ear hangs a bunch of brown silk threads which we term\r\ncorn silk. Up at the top of the plant you will see the tassel, but\r\nyou may not have known that this is the flower of the corn plant. The\r\ntassel or flower in this case contains the “father nature” of the corn\r\nplant, and the ear of corn contains the “mother nature.” The husks on\r\nthe outside of the ear of corn protect the grains of corn on the ear\r\ninside and keep them tender. The ear of corn is really the ovary of\r\nthe corn plant, because that is where the seeds grow. You will guess,\r\nof course, that the grains of corn on the ear are but seeds of the\r\nplant. Were you to examine one of these ears of corn on the plant when\r\nit had just started to form you would find no kernels on the cob, but\r\nonly little marks which indicated where the grains of corn are expected\r\nto grow, but if you want to know, then, how many grains of corn were\r\nexpected to grow on the ear, you could easily tell by counting the\r\nlittle silk threads which you see on the cob and which stick out over\r\nthe end. There will be a thread of silk for each grain of corn that is\r\nexpected to grow.\r\n\r\nEvery grain of corn must receive some of the pollen powder from the\r\ntassel or father nature at the top of the corn plant or it will not\r\ndevelop into a nice large, juicy kernel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does the Pollen Touch the Grain of Corn?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the kernels of corn grow the tassel is in bloom. The wind blows\r\nand shakes the pollen powder off of the tassel and the powder falls\r\non the ends of the silk which stick out of the little ear of corn to\r\nbe. Each thread of silk then carries a little of the powder down to\r\nthe spot on the ear where it is attached and thus the grain of corn\r\nreceives the fertilizing necessary to develop it into a ripe seed.\r\nIf you leave the ear of corn alone the kernel will eventually become\r\nyellow and hard and can then be planted and will produce other corn\r\nplants. Man, however, finds the ear of corn a delightful food, if taken\r\nat a time when the seeds are fully grown but not yet ripened into\r\nperfect seeds. At this stage the grains of corn would not grow up again\r\nif planted, because they have not yet become perfect seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Father and Mother Plants Always Live Together?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the kinds of plants on which the “father” and “mother”\r\nnatures are on different plants of the same kind. At times they will\r\ngrow side by side, at other times they will be in the same field, but\r\nvery often they grow at quite a distance from each other. In some\r\ninstances the nearest father tree will be even miles away from the\r\nmother tree of the same kind. But in any event the pollen from the\r\nfather nature must reach the mother nature of the plant or tree before\r\na perfect seed can be produced. In cases of this kind the father nature\r\nwill be on one tree or plant and the ovary or mother nature on another.\r\nThe wind helps out nature in some of these cases by blowing the pollen\r\nof the father plant to the ovary of the mother plant. In many other\r\ninstances the bees and insects help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Flowers Have Smells?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the bees do this it is because the bee has been visiting the\r\nflowers in his search for honey. They do not fly from flower to flower\r\nfor the purpose of uniting the mother and father natures of plants, but\r\nthey help the flowers incidentally while getting the honey for which\r\nthey are searching. In gathering his honey the busy bee will go all\r\nover the father flower and get his legs all covered with pollen powder.\r\nSooner or later he comes to a mother flower of the same kind of plant\r\nor tree from which he has father pollen on his legs, and, still bent on\r\ngathering honey, he incidentally rubs the pollen powder on to the ovary\r\nof the mother flower and the fertilization takes place. The wonderful\r\nthing about this is that the father pollen of one kind of a plant will\r\nnot fertilize the mother nature of another kind of plant. To illustrate\r\nthis, if a bee carrying pollen on his legs from a walnut blossom visits\r\nthe mother blossom of a hickory tree the pollen of the walnut would not\r\naffect the hickory blossom, but would still have the proper effect on\r\nthe first walnut mother blossom he visited.\r\n\r\nThis is how life in general is reproduced among the plants and trees.\r\nLife in the vegetable kingdom has no sense of feeling or any of the\r\nother senses, but this kind of life is still true to its own nature\r\nand is a wise thing in the plan of creation, because, since all seed\r\nwill produce only plants like those from which the seed came, man can\r\ncontrol the growth of the vegetables and fruits he needs as food. He\r\nknows when he plants corn that he will get corn in return, because\r\nperfect seed never makes a mistake. It would mix things up terribly for\r\nman if this were not so, because man might then plant one thing and\r\nfind another thing growing. It would be a sad thing to plant wheat and\r\nfind thistles growing.\r\n\r\nIn order that seeds may grow they must be planted under conditions that\r\nsuit the kind of vegetable life in the seed. Man has to study and learn\r\nwhat these conditions are.\r\n\r\nIf a seed is planted too deeply the sun may not have a chance to warm\r\nthe ground to that depth, and if it is planted too near the surface it\r\nmay become too warm and be killed by the sun. When planted under the\r\nproper conditions the seed soon begins to grow. It grows upward toward\r\nthe sun to get light and air, and it sends roots down into the ground\r\nto get food and moisture.\r\n\r\nThe life in the vegetable kingdom is soon able to take care of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are Fishes Born?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next step in the study of the reproduction of life brings us to\r\nthe animal kingdom. The first thing we discover in this section is\r\nthat in the animal kingdom father and mother natures are almost always\r\nseparated. In plants and trees these parent natures are sometimes in\r\nthe same flower, often separated, but on the same plant, and in other\r\ninstances on different plants miles apart. What we must remember, then,\r\nis that in the case of plants it is given more or less to the chance of\r\nwind or other circumstances to bring the parent natures together.\r\n\r\nIn the animal kingdom there are a few cases where the mother and father\r\nnatures are found in the same living object, as in the oyster and\r\nclam families, one of the lowest forms of animal life. These have but\r\none of the five senses--that of feeling. This class of animals--the\r\ncold-blooded animals--includes the fishes, and in most members of this\r\nclass the father and mother natures are separated and in different\r\nbodies. Step by step from now on we enter higher forms of animal life,\r\nand through each step we find a greater difference between the father\r\nand mother natures, and in the animal kingdom we speak of the father\r\nand mother natures as “_male_ and _female_.” In the animal kingdom,\r\ntoo, what we have previously called the seed is known as the _egg_.\r\nSeeds and eggs are the same so far as their usefulness is concerned,\r\nbut we say eggs in the animal kingdom to distinguish from seeds in the\r\nvegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nFish have eggs, then, and it is from the eggs that little fish are born\r\ninto the world and grow to be of eatable size. You recognize the eggs\r\nof the fish in the “roe,” which is eaten as food. Not all fish eggs are\r\nused as food, however.\r\n\r\nIn the fish world the eggs are developed in the body of the female\r\nfish. Each little round speck in a “shad roe” is one egg, and there\r\nare many thousands in a single “roe.” Each egg will produce a little\r\nfish, under favorable conditions. These eggs develop in the body of\r\nthe female fish in winter. In the spring, which is the time in which\r\nmost living things are born, and, therefore, the time for hatching out\r\nfish eggs, all of the fish swim from the deep water where they live in\r\nwinter to the places where the water is shallow and warm, and in these\r\nshallow waters the female fish expels the eggs from her body where the\r\nsun can get at them and hatch them by warming them. After the female\r\nfish has thus laid the eggs, the male fish swims over the eggs as they\r\nlay in the water, and expels from his body over them a fluid which is\r\nwhite in appearance and which fertilizes the fish eggs. If any of this\r\nfluid fails to reach some of the eggs it is not possible for the sun to\r\nbring them to life.\r\n\r\nWhen the eggs are laid and fertilized the mother and father fishes swim\r\naway and they never see their children or recognize them as such, even\r\nif they meet them later in life. The parent fish do not act like other\r\nfathers and mothers, and they do not need to, because as soon as a baby\r\nfish is born he is able to find his own food and needs no help from\r\nfather or mother to teach him how to find it or enable him to grow into\r\na real fish.\r\n\r\nOf course, many of the tiny fish are eaten by other fish and not all\r\nthe eggs which the mother fishes lay hatch into live fish, because, if\r\nthey did, the waters would be so crowded with fish that there would not\r\nbe any room for the water. A single female fish will lay millions of\r\neggs in a year, and if each egg developed into a fish there would be\r\nfar too many.\r\n\r\nThis order of animals, which includes turtles, frogs, etc., is the\r\ncold-blooded class of animal life. They have only part of the five\r\nsenses. They all can feel and some of the fishes can see and hear, but\r\na great many of them, particularly those kinds which live on the bottom\r\nof the ocean, cannot either see or hear, and some members of the fish\r\nfamily cannot even swim.\r\n\r\nThe thing to remember about fishes in connection with the reproduction\r\nof life is that the mother fish must select a place which is favorable\r\nto deposit the eggs, but after that her responsibility ceases. The\r\nfather merely fertilizes the eggs, and then his responsibility ceases.\r\nThe little fish look out for themselves as soon as they are born and\r\nnever know what it is to have a father or mother to look after them.\r\n\r\nWhen we study the next higher form of animal life we find that the\r\nyoung ones have to be looked after, and that this becomes more\r\nnecessary as we ascend the scale of animal life until we reach man, the\r\nmost intelligent of all animals and yet the most helpless of all at\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Birds Are Taught to Fly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next step brings us to the birds. Before they can look after\r\nthemselves the little birds must learn how to search for food and the\r\nkinds of food good for them. They have to learn the habits of their\r\nkind of life. The higher you go in the study of animal life the greater\r\nseem to be the dangers which surround the young animals and the longer\r\nit takes to teach them how to look after themselves and what to do for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe bird family includes not only the robins, larks, sparrows and\r\npigeons, but also the ducks, geese, and chickens, etc. We are all more\r\nor less familiar with birds’ eggs, and if not we know what a hen’s egg\r\nlooks like. The eggs of the bird family are laid in nests, which is the\r\nfirst sign of home building in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe birds are the first of the large class of warm-blooded animals.\r\nThe egg here represents again the reproductive power. The eggs, too,\r\nform in the body of the female bird, but are laid in a nest which the\r\nparent birds build together. Now this is the first step away from the\r\nfish family. The fish looks for a suitable place to lay the eggs and\r\nthen goes off and leaves them. The birds, however, have to make a\r\nnest in which to deposit the eggs. The fish, as you remember, depended\r\nupon the warm sun shining on the shallow water to hatch out the eggs,\r\nthus depending on an outside force to supply the necessary warmth. In\r\nthe bird family the mother bird must cover the eggs with her own body\r\nand keep them warm until they hatch out. Then, too, the father and\r\nmother birds feed the young until they are strong enough to fly and\r\nfind food for themselves, and so the mother and father birds look after\r\ntheir babies until they are old enough to look after themselves. When\r\nthis time arrives the old birds cease to bother about the young ones\r\naltogether. The fishes never act like parents after the baby fishes\r\nare born, because the little fish are able to look after themselves\r\nright away. The parent birds are a good deal like fathers and mothers\r\nfor a time, but only so long as it takes them to teach their little\r\nbird children to look out for themselves. Then they forget the children\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nIt requires but a few days and no parental care to hatch out a family\r\nof baby fishes and no attention at all after birth. It requires several\r\nweeks and much patience for the parent birds to hatch out their eggs,\r\nand it involves care and attention for several weeks to teach baby\r\nbirds to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nThis being a father or mother in the animal kingdom becomes a greater\r\nresponsibility in every step as we get closer to man, and when we reach\r\nman we find him to be the most helpless offspring of all at birth, and\r\nthat it takes more time, care and attention to bring up a human child\r\nto maturity than any other animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Hollow Place at One End of a Boiled Egg?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis hollow place on the end of the boiled egg (sometimes it shows on\r\nthe side) is the air which is put inside of the egg when it is formed\r\nso that the little chicken will have air to breathe from the time it\r\ncomes to life within the egg until it becomes strong enough to break\r\nthe shell and go out into the world. There is also food in the egg for\r\nhim. When you boil the egg this pocket of air within the shell, which\r\nwould have been used up by the chick if the egg had been set to hatch\r\ninstead of being cooked for breakfast, begins to fight for its space\r\nand pushes the boiling egg back and forms the hollow place.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the air in the egg is a good thing to remember when we\r\ncome to study the higher forms of animal life from the standpoint of\r\nhow they reproduce themselves.\r\n\r\nThe mammals are the next higher form of animals. The babies of this\r\nclass of animals must be fed for several weeks or months before they\r\nare ready to come into the world.\r\n\r\nA little chicken is ready to come out of the egg almost as soon as it\r\ncomes to life, and, therefore, needs only a little air and food before\r\nit is strong enough to peck its way out, but the babies of mammals\r\nbegin to live months before they are ready to come into the world, and\r\nthey need a great deal of air and food during this time. This class\r\nincludes the dogs, horses, cows, cats and all other animals in the\r\nZoo and in the woods. The name mammals means the same as “mamma,” and\r\nindicates an animal which must be fed from the body of a female mammal\r\neven after it is born.\r\n\r\nIn this class the eggs are retained within the body of the female\r\nanimal instead of being laid in a nest or some other place, as in\r\nanimals of lower classes, after being fertilized by the male animal,\r\nso that the baby animal may secure its food and air from within the\r\nmother’s body after the life within the egg is begun.\r\n\r\nThe mother’s body supplies the necessary warmth to develop the life\r\nof the little animal in the egg, just as the birds supplied this with\r\ntheir bodies. In the bird class it only takes a few hours to give\r\nthe little bird sufficient strength to peek his way out, but in the\r\nmammal class it is a long time before the baby animal is strong enough\r\nto come out into the world, and even after it is born the babies of\r\nmammals require a great deal of care and attention before they are able\r\nto look out for themselves. During this period the animal secures all\r\nof its food from the breast of the mother animal.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why the eggs of mammals are retained within the bodies\r\nof the females is the need for protecting the young animals from\r\nenemies. In the animal kingdom each kind of animal preys upon another\r\nkind. They attack and devour each other and are constantly in danger.\r\nIf, then, mammals laid eggs in nests and sat upon them to hatch them\r\nout, the mother animals sitting on the nests would be continually in\r\ndanger of attack from their enemies. They would either have to flee\r\nand subject the nest and its contents to the danger of destruction or\r\nelse stay and fight, and perhaps be destroyed. But by carrying her egg\r\nwithin her body the mother mammal is able to move about from place to\r\nplace and protect her baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Man an Animal?\r\n\r\n\r\nMen, women and children belong to the “mammal” class of animals. The\r\noffspring of the human family is the most helpless of all animals at\r\nbirth. The young of most kinds of mammals can stand on their legs\r\nshortly after being born, but the human baby requires months before it\r\ncan stand up. A baby horse can also walk within a few hours, but human\r\nchildren do not begin to walk until they are more than a year old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Cannot Babies Walk as Soon as Born?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human baby has a great many more things to learn than a horse baby\r\nbefore it is safe for him to go about alone. It takes time for the\r\nbrain to develop, and if a baby could walk before the brain had even\r\npartially developed it would only get into trouble.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is what we have learned about the reproduction of life\r\nand the reasons for its being different in different classes of life.\r\nFirst, we had the division of organic life into the vegetable and\r\nanimal kingdoms. Life in the vegetable kingdom has none of the five\r\nsenses, for plants cannot see, hear, feel, smell or taste. They cannot\r\nmove from place to place, but remain where they grow until destroyed\r\nor removed. On the other hand, all animal life has at least one of\r\nthe five senses--feeling. The oysters and clams belong to this class.\r\nStarting with this level of life in the animal kingdom we find that as\r\nwe go on up through the different classes we find each class able to\r\ndo things which make it superior to the class below it, until we reach\r\nthe human mammal, who can do most of all. And, further, that since each\r\nclass as we go up in the scale of life has greater ability to do things\r\nthan the class beneath it, so in each case the task of the parents\r\nin preparing their offspring for their kind of life becomes greater,\r\nand the period during which the offspring is learning becomes longer\r\nand longer until we reach the human family, in which we find that\r\nparents have the greatest responsibility, and the children are the most\r\nhelpless of all animals, but that in the final result man has a right,\r\non account of his superior qualities, to be the ruler of the other\r\ncreatures of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are Ball Bearings?\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago a gentleman in trying to find some way to reduce the\r\nfriction, which is constantly developed to a certain extent, even when\r\nthe axle is oiled, discovered that if between the axle and the inside\r\nof the hub a circle of steel balls were arranged, so that the hub of\r\nthe wheel did not touch the axle at all, but rested on the little balls\r\nwhich in their turn touched the axle, that a great deal of the friction\r\nwas eliminated. This proved to be a wonderful invention, and when this\r\ncombination is arranged and oiled, there is hardly any friction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy a Gasoline Engine Goes\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nAs you know, gasoline is a very inflammable fluid, and will explode if\r\nplaced too close to fire.\r\n\r\nThis explosive quality is the basic principle of the gasoline engine.\r\nBy admitting a small quantity of gasoline vapor into an enclosed\r\ncylinder, and exploding it by means of an electric spark, repeating\r\nthis operation continuously, the engine is given a regular rotary\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nLook at Fig. 1. Starting from the gasoline tank, the fluid is fed\r\ninto the ‘carburetor’, which is a sort of atomizer. Here the gasoline\r\nis mixed with air, and broken up into a very fine spray, in which\r\ncondition it will explode readily.\r\n\r\nThe engine will not start of itself. Its fly-wheel must first be turned\r\nby hand, or by some other outside force, until the first explosion\r\ntakes place. After this its action is automatic.\r\n\r\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the fly-wheel is being turned, and is drawing the\r\npiston down the cylinder, which in turn sucks gasoline vapor, (shown by\r\nlittle arrows) through the ‘intake valve’. This ‘intake valve’, and the\r\n‘exhaust valve’ on the opposite side of the cylinder, are opened and\r\nclosed at the proper time through the action of the gears shown in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nPassing to Fig. 2, the fly-wheel in turning has drawn the piston to\r\nits lowest point, and is now shown forcing it up the cylinder. This\r\ncompresses the gasoline vapor in the cylinder to a density at which its\r\nexplosion produces the greatest amount of power. The intake and exhaust\r\nvalves are both closed.\r\n\r\n~WHAT CAUSES THE EXPLOSION IN A GAS ENGINE~\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows the explosion. The cylinder has been filled with\r\ncompressed gas, and the piston has again started on its downward\r\ntravel. The spark plug, set in the top of the cylinder, makes a spark\r\nevery time an electrical current passes through it. A switch on the\r\nengine permits the current to pass to the spark plug only when the\r\nengine is at this position in its action. (Fig. 3.) The consequent\r\nexplosion drives the piston downward with great force, turning the\r\nfly-wheel, which by its weight continues the rotary motion after the\r\ndownward impulse of the piston has been expended.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 shows the fly-wheel, still turning, forcing the piston up and\r\nthus expelling the burned gases from the cylinder through the exhaust\r\nvalve, held open for this purpose. From this position the engine\r\ngoes again to that of Fig. 1, and through 2, 3, and 4, continuously,\r\nexploding every second revolution, and giving a regular rotary motion\r\nto the fly-wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrations show a one-cylinder motor, but these engines can be\r\nbuilt with two or more cylinders, arranged to explode at different\r\ntimes, thus giving very smooth action to the fly-wheel and main shaft.\r\n\r\nAeroplanes, almost all automobiles, various pumps and other machinery\r\nare driven by gasoline engines. The rotary motion can readily be\r\ntransmitted by chains or gears to the propellor of an aeroplane or\r\nmotor boat, or the wheels of an automobile. It is only in the past few\r\nyears that the gasoline engine has reached its present high state of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEGINNING OF AN AUTOMOBILE\r\n\r\nCRANKCASE SHOWING BEARINGS.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the automobile is the engine. It is built around the\r\ncrankcase, which is its foundation or base.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRANKCASE WITH CRANKSHAFT AND FLY-WHEEL ADDED.\r\n\r\nThe crankshaft serves the same purpose in an automobile as the pedals\r\ndo on a bicycle.\r\n\r\nThe fly-wheel on the end helps it to keep turning at an even speed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gasoline vapor is exploded in the cylinders. This pushes\r\nthe piston down, and as the piston is connected to the crankshaft it\r\nstarts the crankshaft turning.\r\n\r\nThe piston and the rod that connect it to the crankshaft are just like\r\nthe feet and limbs of any one riding a bicycle.\r\n\r\nCylinders showing piston in place and connected to crankshaft.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The gears or “cog-wheels” are for running the fan, the\r\npump and other parts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HEART OF THE AUTOMOBILE\r\n\r\nCylinder added to crankcase.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders are next bolted down to the crankcase, the pistons and\r\ncrankshaft having been connected, as shown in Fig. 3. A cover is placed\r\nover the gears to keep them clean.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An oil pan or reservoir is attached to the bottom of the\r\ncrankcase to hold oil for the engine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The carburetor furnishes the gasoline vapor for the\r\ncylinders. It is connected to the engine by a crooked pipe called the\r\nintake manifold.\r\n\r\nAfter the gasoline has been exploded a valve opens and allows the\r\nburned gases to escape through another pipe, called the exhaust\r\nmanifold.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oil is poured in the spout which is at the left of the\r\ncarburetor. It runs down into the reservoir and is pumped up through\r\nthe engine a little at a time.\r\n\r\nOil pump and filler added to motor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POWER PLANT OF AN AUTOMOBILE\r\n\r\nThe electric generator makes electricity to be used for starting the\r\nengine and lighting the car.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The magneto gives an electric spark, which explodes the\r\ngasoline in the cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe water pump keeps water flowing around the cylinders to prevent them\r\nfrom getting too hot.

The tire pump on up-to-date cars is run by the\r\nengine. It does not pump except when the gears, which are shown in the\r\npicture, are pulled together.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An electric motor starts the engine by turning the\r\nfly-wheel.

It consists of a complete Haynes\r\nsix-cylinder unit power plant, and has been given a position at the\r\nside of the original Haynes “horseless carriage,” where the striking\r\ncontrast shows the remarkable improvement that has been made in motor\r\ndesign and construction during the past twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nThe most important features of the power plant are shown clearly and\r\ncomprehensively by having sections cut away from the various parts, so\r\nthat the visitors to the Institute are enabled to see the mechanical\r\nconstruction, and the relation of the component devices.\r\n\r\nOn the right side of the engine, the intake and exhaust manifolds\r\nare shown in their natural position. A full vertical section of the\r\nStromberg carburetor gives a good idea of how the gasoline is mixed\r\nwith the air and supplied to the cylinders. The Leece-Neville generator\r\nhas its casing cut away to give a view of the windings and cores.\r\nNumerous windows have been cut into the crankcase to disclose the\r\ncrankshaft construction and the oil reservoir. The transmission gears\r\nare also shown in this manner.\r\n\r\nMost of the electrical equipment is shown clearly on the left side of\r\nthe motor. Here an interesting feature is the full vertical section\r\nof the American Simms high-tension dual magneto. A half section has\r\nbeen removed from the rear cylinder, and the piston as well, to\r\ngive a glimpse of the interior construction. A large portion of the\r\nLeece-Neville starting motor casing has been cut away. The cover-plate\r\non the switch controlling the starting motor has been replaced with a\r\nglass cover to display the method of completing the circuit from the\r\nbattery to the motor. A skeleton selector switch is mounted at the rear\r\nof the transmission case, instead of its usual position on the steering\r\nwheel. The electric gear-shifting mechanism is made visible by using a\r\nglass plate for the top cover-plate on the transmission.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does the Heart Beat When the Brain Is Asleep?\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary conditions the heart beats are controlled by certain\r\nnerve cells which are located within the heart itself, and these cause\r\nthe heart to beat even while the brain is asleep. This explains why\r\nthe heart beats when the brain is asleep, and the fact that the brain\r\nwhen asleep does not exercise its functions, shows how necessary this\r\narrangement and the control of ordinary heart beats is. If this were\r\nnot so, we should not be able to live while asleep. It is just like\r\nthe management of a great business in this sense. The general manager\r\nof a great business has control of the entire works, but there are\r\noccasions when he must be thinking of only one thing in connection with\r\nthe business, and so he must have his organization so complete, that\r\nthe parts which he cannot be thinking about at the time will do their\r\nwork just the same. So he surrounds himself with competent assistants,\r\nwho look after certain departments while he is busy or away or asleep,\r\nand if anything goes wrong while he is away, he calls on special forces\r\nto set things right. Now, the brain is the general manager of the whole\r\nbody and has these nerve cells in the heart as a sort of assistant\r\nmanager to look after the heart beats in ordinary conditions, and to\r\nkeep the heart going while he is asleep. But, by reason of his office\r\nas general manager, the brain has a special way of sending orders to\r\nthe heart through special nerves which run from the brain down each\r\nside of the neck to the heart. There are two pairs of these special\r\nnerves. One pair, if set in motion, will make the heart beat faster,\r\nand the other pair will make the heart beat more slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Our Hearts Beat Faster When We Are Running?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you start running, the brain knows at once that your legs and\r\nother parts of the body will need more blood to keep them going, and\r\nso the brain sends down orders through his special nerves which make\r\nthe heart beat faster, to get busy, and they do. Then when you stop\r\nrunning, your heart is beating faster than necessary--there is really\r\nan oversupply of blood being pumped through your system for the time\r\nbeing, and that makes you uncomfortable, until the brain sends word\r\nthrough the other set of nerves to the heart to slow down the heart\r\nbeat. It is better to stop running gradually, to give the heart a\r\nchance to get back to its normal beat gradually also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do I Get Out of Breath When Running?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is also caused by your brain in its efforts to keep up your supply\r\nof good blood. We breathe to take air into the lungs, where the blood\r\nwhich has once been through the arteries and comes back on its return\r\ntrip to the heart, is exposed to the air in the lungs, before going\r\nback into the heart. The air which we take into our lungs purifies the\r\nonce used blood and makes it into good blood again. When you run the\r\nheart pumps blood into your arteries faster to enable you to run. Thus\r\nalso, the arteries send much more blood back to the heart through the\r\nveins, and this must be purified by the lungs before going back into\r\nthe heart. To attend to purifying this extra amount of spoiled blood\r\nthe lungs need more air, and thus you are made to breathe in more air\r\nfor the purpose. Unless you are in good training--your wind in good\r\ncondition as we say--it is almost impossible for you to supply the\r\nlungs with enough air for the purpose, but whether you can do it or\r\nnot, the lungs call upon you for more air, and cause you to try to get\r\nit, and that is what makes you get out of breath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does My Heart Beat Faster When I Am Scared?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural tendency of a scared creature is to run or fly. The effect\r\nof being scared has the same effect on the brain that your starting\r\nto run has. The brain is always as quick as you are, and knowing that\r\nwhen you are scared your actual or natural inclination is to run, it is\r\nmerely getting you in shape so that you can move or run fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Cold Make Our Hands Blue?\r\n\r\n\r\nYour hands appear blue when cold because the veins which are near the\r\nsurface are filled with impure blood which is purplish in color. Your\r\nhands become cold because there is not sufficient circulation of warm\r\nred blood going on to keep them warm. The blood in circulating through\r\nyour body sends warm red blood through the arteries, and this is\r\nreturned to the heart through the lungs by way of the veins. The veins\r\ncarry only used-up blood or what is left of the good red blood when the\r\narteries are through with it. Its color is a purplish blue.\r\n\r\nWhen your hands are blue it means that circulation of good red blood\r\nhas practically stopped--the red blood is not flowing from the heart\r\nthrough the arteries in sufficient quantity and there is no color in\r\nthe arteries, as the blood from the arteries has practically all gone\r\ninto the veins. The veins are full to purplish blue blood, and this\r\nmakes the hands look blue, because there are a great many veins in the\r\nhands close to the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do I Get Red in the Face?\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, when you rub your cold blue hands together, you start the\r\ncirculation going again, and that brings the red blood into the\r\narteries, giving you the healthy red color again. When you run hard to\r\nget red in the face because you are causing an unusual amount of red\r\nblood to flow through your whole body by your violent exercise. Some\r\npeople with an extraordinary amount of circulation are red in the face\r\nall the time. This is because of the presence of a great deal of blood\r\nin the arteries, or because the walls of their arteries are so much\r\nthinner than others that the red blood shows through more easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Yawning Infectious?\r\n\r\n\r\nYawning is infectious to the extent that other habits are. The desire\r\nto yawn which comes to us when we see some one else does so comes under\r\nthe heading of suggestion. The power of suggestion is greater than many\r\nof us realize. We are great imitators of each other. When one of us is\r\ndownhearted, we are apt to become happy and glad simply by being with\r\nother people who are happy and glad. If enough people one at a time\r\ntell a perfectly well man that he looks sick, he will actually feel\r\nill, provided he does not suspect a game is being played on him. So a\r\ngood actor carries his audience with him. He can make them laugh or cry\r\nalmost at will, and if he yawns, his audience will begin yawning.\r\n\r\nOften, however, there is no acting connected with the yawning of the\r\nfirst person. Then the yawn is caused because the person is not sending\r\nenough good air into the lungs for purifying the blood, and the yawn is\r\nonly nature’s way of making us take an exceptionally deep breath of air\r\nin at one time. This lack of sufficient good air in the lungs may not\r\nbe due to the poor breathing, but to the amount of bad air in the room.\r\nIn such cases it is quite likely that other people in the room yawn\r\nwhen one of them starts it because they all begin to feel the need of\r\nmore good air at about the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Me Want to Stretch?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessity or desire to stretch comes to us because certain parts of\r\nthe body are not receiving the proper amount of blood circulation and\r\nit is these parts that we stretch at such times. If you have ever been\r\nto a ball game, you know, of course, that it has become customary for\r\nthe crowd, no matter how large, to stretch its legs and arms during the\r\nlast half of the seventh inning. In fact, that has come to be a fixture\r\nat ball games and is universally known as the “stretch inning.” Now,\r\nit is not so much the result of a desire to encourage the home team as\r\nthe natural following out of nature’s laws that originally started this\r\npractice. The end of the seventh inning at a ball game generally means\r\nthat the crowd has been sitting quite still for the greater part of an\r\nhour and a half, just long enough for the circulation to become poor\r\nin parts of the body, and the custom of stretching at a ball game thus\r\ncomes from the necessity of getting a little more speed into the action\r\nof the heart to increase the blood supply.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the stretching constitutes a mild form of exercise. You\r\nwill notice the ball players themselves do not stretch themselves in\r\nthe last half of the seventh inning. They are getting enough exercise\r\nwithout that.\r\n\r\nIt is natural, however, for us to stretch as we wake up from sleep\r\nafter having lain quietly in one position for one or more hours. It is\r\nnature’s way of causing the heart to work faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens When I Stretch?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happens is simply this. When you stretch your arms and legs, you\r\nsqueeze the arteries and veins which are a part of your arms and legs,\r\nmuch as happens when you pull on a piece of rubber tubing. The tubing\r\nbecomes flat instead of perfectly round, and it is not so easy to send\r\nwater through a flat tube as through a round one. Just so with the\r\nheart. It is the heart’s business to send blood through the arteries\r\nat all times, and when you make them flat the heart’s job becomes just\r\na little harder, and it goes to work beating just a little faster to\r\novercome this extra difficulty. By that time you are through stretching\r\nand the heart is busy pumping blood a little faster than ordinarily,\r\nand that is what makes you feel so good after you have stretched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can We Think of Only One Thing at a Time?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are asking the question intelligently, you must know that to\r\nthink means to concentrate, and in that sense we can only think of one\r\nthing at a time, because it takes all of that part of the brain which\r\nis used for thinking for just one thing. To give close attention to any\r\none subject means to turn the entire brain force practically in one\r\ndirection. To let other things pass through the mind at the same time\r\nmay appear not to interfere with the one thought, but they do, and our\r\nconclusions suffer accordingly.\r\n\r\nYou can be doing something with one part of your body, while engaged\r\nin thinking of one thing, but only such things as are more or less\r\nmechanical as the result of habit, such as walking, or moving the\r\narms--things which the parts have done so often that actual attention\r\nby the brain is not absolutely essential. Take for instance, the fact\r\nthat a man in deep thought on one subject will sometimes walk up and\r\ndown the room or along the sidewalk. He can do this walking and still\r\nthink concentratedly, but if he stubs his toe on the leg of a chair or\r\non a rough place in the walk, his thought is broken, because the brain\r\nimmediately takes itself out of the thought and pays its attention to\r\nthe toe that was stubbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do I Turn White When Scared?\r\n\r\n\r\nSimply because, when you are scared or frightened, the blood almost\r\nleaves your face entirely. Under normal conditions, the red blood which\r\nis flowing through the arteries of your face, gives the face a reddish\r\ntinge, and your face becomes white when you are frightened, because\r\nthen the blood leaves the face. It is quite singular, but when you are\r\nreally frightened, whatever the cause may be, the human system receives\r\nsuch a shock that the heart just about stops beating all together. When\r\nyour heart stops beating of course the flow of the blood from the heart\r\nstops and then there is no supply of fresh red blood coming through the\r\narteries under the skin of your face. Therefore you look white--the\r\ncolor your face would be if no blood ever flowed through your arteries\r\nand veins. Some people have faces so white they look as though they\r\nwere scared all the time. This is not because they have no blood\r\nflowing through the veins and arteries in their faces, but because\r\ntheir supply of blood is less than other peoples, and sometimes because\r\nthe walls of their arteries and veins are much thicker than the average\r\nthat the color of the blood does not show through. There are also many\r\npeople who have so much blood in their systems all the time, and the\r\nwalls of whose arteries are so thin, that they look at all times as\r\nthough they might be blushing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Me Blush?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything that will make your heart send an extra supply of blood into\r\nthe arteries and veins which supply your face with blood, will make you\r\nblush. Embarrassment will do this. So will anger generally, although\r\nsometimes people get so angry that the blood is driven out of their\r\nfaces. In this case they are so angry that their heart has stopped\r\nbeating, practically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Occurs When We Think?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we think the mind is acting on sensations; it is receiving, in\r\nconjunction with memories of sensations it has previously received.\r\nSensations as they reach the mind arouse the mind to activity and, as\r\nsoon as the sensation is received, the mind begins to compare the new\r\nsensation with sensations received at previous times, and by putting\r\nthings together reaches a conclusion.\r\n\r\nWhen you are thinking you are really trying to call upon memory to\r\nhelp you. You know the thought of one thing calls up another, and this\r\nleads to something else. This association of ideas is the faculty which\r\nenables us to think consecutively and accurately. It is the business of\r\nthe mind to receive the sensations that enter it and arrange them in\r\ntheir proper places. That memory of past sensations is the important\r\npart of thinking, is proven by the fact that when we have forgotten a\r\nthing we are unable to think what it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Animals Think?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this reason if animals have memory they should be able to think. It\r\nis now believed that many animals have to a certain extent the power to\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nA dog will recognize his master even though he has not seen him for\r\nyears. We might think he does this by his highly developed power of\r\nsmell, but if his master has come from a direction opposite to that\r\nfrom which the dog first sees him, he could not have tracked him by his\r\nsmell. A dog will recognize his master from quite a distance, so he\r\nmust have to a certain extent the ability to remember or the power of\r\nassociation of ideas, which amounts to the same thing. Again, a horse\r\nthat once belonged to the fire department, even though now hitched to a\r\nmilk wagon, will have the impulse to run to the fire when he hears the\r\nfire gong. And an old war horse will prick up his ears as he used to\r\nwhen he hears the bugle call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do I Sneeze?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou sneeze sometimes when you look up at the sun or at a bright light.\r\nThere does not seem to be any real good explanation of why looking at a\r\nbright light should make you sneeze. It is due to the connection there\r\nis between the nerves of the eyes and the nose. You generally blink if\r\nyou look at a bright light suddenly, and the blinking process stirs the\r\nnerves inside of the nose to make you sneeze.\r\n\r\nYou know, of course, that the start of the sneeze is inside of your\r\nnose. The nose is, besides being the organ of smell, the channel\r\nthrough which we take air into the lungs, when we breathe properly.\r\nThe nose is lined with membranes, back of which are a net of very\r\nsmall nerves which are extremely sensitive. The membranes are placed\r\nthere to catch and hold the impure particles of matter which come into\r\nthe nose when we take in a breath of air, and sneezing is only one\r\neffective way of cleaning out the nose. It is brought on only when some\r\nparticularly difficult job of nose-cleaning has to be done. Pepper up\r\nthe nose will make you sneeze quickly, because pepper produces a very\r\ngreat irritation inside the nose, and the nose goes to work at once to\r\nget rid of it in the quickest possible manner as soon as the pepper\r\ncomes in. Other things have the same effect. Sometimes a cold in the\r\nhead causes you to sneeze. The sneeze in that event is merely nature’s\r\neffort to clean out the nose when other efforts have failed.\r\n\r\nThere are many suggestions for stopping a sneeze before it takes place,\r\nafter you feel it coming on, such as putting the finger on each side of\r\nthe nose, and many others. But a half sneeze does not remove the cause\r\nof the sneeze, so it is much better to sneeze it out, and many people\r\nenjoy the after effects of sneezing so much that they take snuff into\r\nthe nose to produce it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens When I Swallow?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe muscles of your throat act in the form of a ring when food passes\r\ninto your throat. The food does not drop directly into your stomach. In\r\nother words, the action is not quite the same as when you drop a stone\r\nout of the window. When you do the latter, the stone hits the sidewalk\r\nor whatever is below at the time, with a smash. It would hardly do to\r\nhave our food drop into the stomach, so the muscles of the throat are\r\narranged to contract in rings which push or squeeze the food downward,\r\nand the food is passed from one ring of muscles to the other. It is\r\njust like pushing a ball down into the foot of a stocking that is\r\napparently too small for it to drop down. You put the ball in the top\r\nof the stocking and then by making a ring of your fingers around the\r\nstocking you can push the ball down. When you swallow, you start the\r\nmuscles of your throat to making these rings. The upper ring squeezes\r\nthe food on to the ring below it and so on down to the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Lump Come In My Throat When I Cry?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “lump” which comes up into your throat when you cry is caused\r\nby a sort of paralysis of the rings of muscles in your throat. The\r\nmuscles of your throat can make these rings or waves upward also, but\r\nit is more difficult upward than downward--probably because of lack\r\nof practice, as we say. When you have put something into your stomach\r\nthat makes you sick and causes you to vomit, the throat muscles take\r\nthe matter from your stomach and bring it back to the mouth in the same\r\nway, except, of course, that this action begins at the bottom.\r\n\r\nSometimes when you cry, or lose control of yourself in some other\r\nway (you know, of course, that in crying you always lose control of\r\nyourself, don’t you) practically the same effect is produced as when\r\nyou have something in your stomach that should come out. Crying, or the\r\nthing that happens sometimes when we cry, makes the throat muscles act\r\njust as if we were vomiting, and as the action is an unnatural one,\r\nwhen the ring or wave reaches the top of the throat, we feel the lump\r\nor ball as we call it. We feel the lump because the throat has been\r\nmade to go through the motion of eliminating something in an unnatural\r\nway, just as your arm will hurt if you pretend to have a ball or a\r\nstone in it, and in throwing the imaginary ball or stone, you put the\r\nsame force into your movements as you would if you had an actual ball\r\nor stone in your hand and were seeing how far you could throw it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Stop Growing?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe eventually stop growing because certain of the cells of the body\r\nlose their ability of increasing in size and producing other cells. It\r\nis one of the marvels of the construction of the human body that this\r\nis so and one of the wisest provisions also. At first the cells of the\r\nbody crave lots of food and increase in size, divide and then the parts\r\ngo on growing until they become of a certain size, when they again\r\ndivide and each part goes on growing, etc., and thus we grow. A growing\r\nboy needs more fond than a mature man, because he needs some of it to\r\ngrow with, while the man only has to keep what growth he has going, i.\r\ne., alive.\r\n\r\nWe say this limit of growth is a wise provision of nature because if\r\nthere were no limit to the size we might become, we would not know how\r\nlarge to build houses, barns, etc., or else we would have to build them\r\nso large to start with that we would be lost in them for a long time.\r\nWe would constantly be forced to change these things and there would\r\nbe no basis to reckon from. Dogs might be as big as elephants and then\r\nthey would be of no use to us, or of what use would a dog as big as an\r\nelephant be to a boy of five years. You see it would not do at all to\r\nhave this rule changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Grow Aged?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe age directly in accordance with the lives we lead. You can bend\r\na wire back and forth a number of times at the same point without\r\nbreaking it, but eventually it will break. Just so with the human body.\r\nYou can use each part of it for its own purposes a number of times, but\r\neventually the break will come. Or, you can fail to make a part of it\r\nperform its regular functions, and it will die--the break will come.\r\nThe human body is the most wonderful machine in the world, but even it\r\nwill eventually wear out. Every time you move your arm, leg or some\r\nother part of your body, you destroy some tissues. The body replenishes\r\nand builds up those tissues again for a certain time. When you bend a\r\njoint in your body, the body oils the joint naturally, but as you grow\r\nolder, or rather, as you use the different parts of your body more and\r\nmore, it brings nearer always the time, when the body cannot, of its\r\nown accord, build up again the tissues you have destroyed. That is why\r\nsome people become very old at forty and others are still comparatively\r\nyoung at seventy. It requires a great deal of care and attention and\r\nthe elimination of all abuse of the body to keep us young when we\r\nare old. The use of drink, lack of sufficient sleep and other abuses\r\nprevent the body from restoring the tissues which have been destroyed.\r\nWorry and sorrow age us very rapidly, because these things affect the\r\nnerves. If the nerves are not quiet we cannot get any rest and without\r\nrest we grow old very rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes Wrinkles?\r\n\r\n\r\nWrinkles come to us in several ways. An easy way to cause wrinkles is\r\nto scowl and frown and get into the habit of doing this. When you scowl\r\nor frown you pucker up the skin on your forehead into wrinkles and if\r\nyou continue the habit the skin on your forehead makes the wrinkles\r\npermanent. You have given your skin the wrinkle habit. This acts just\r\nthe same way as your arm would, if you tied it up in a sling and held\r\nit close to your side for a very long time--a number of weeks. When you\r\ntook the sling off you would find your arm useless--a dead arm. It had\r\ndeveloped the habit of doing nothing.\r\n\r\nIn old people, however, wrinkles come more naturally. There it is the\r\ncase of the skin not receiving the proper nourishment and attention to\r\nkeep the circulation of the blood right. When people become old they\r\nare apt to lose the fat which has accumulated under their skins. If\r\nthey had taken just the right amount of exercise all of their lives and\r\nkept their circulation perfect in all parts of the body, there would\r\nhave been no fat there. But when the fat accumulates, it makes the\r\nskin grow larger, and then when the fat disappears and people get thin\r\nagain, the skin is too large and makes the wrinkles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Thunder Sour Milk?\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk will sour in any kind of warm and moist temperature and, because\r\njust before and during a thunderstorm the air is generally quite warm\r\nand moist, it is only natural that it should turn sour. It is wrong,\r\nhowever, to say or think that thunder makes milk sour. Thunder is only\r\na noise and noise cannot do anything but make itself heard. The fact\r\nthat it is generally warm and moist, however, when it thunders, coupled\r\nwith the fact that these conditions of the air sour milk very rapidly,\r\nhave led people to connect the two in their minds and caused them to\r\nfall into the error of believing that the thunder is responsible for\r\nthe change in the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Rings in the Water When I Throw a Stone Into It?\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery movement has a beginning. When a movement on the earth is once\r\nstarted it keeps on going until something stops it. If nothing stops it\r\nit will go on forever.\r\n\r\nWhen you shout you start air waves going in every direction, which\r\nkeeps on going until stopped by something which has the power to break\r\nup their waves.\r\n\r\nWhen you throw a stone into the ocean you start a series of ripples\r\nor waves which spread out in every direction and if you dropped your\r\nstone into the exact middle of the ocean--half way from each side--in\r\na perfectly calm sea undisturbed by other forces, your ring of ripples\r\nwould go on getting larger until it landed on the beach or shore on\r\neach side of the ocean at the exactly the same time and there the beach\r\nor shore would stop it.\r\n\r\nThe original ring of ripples is caused by the fact that when you drop\r\na stone into the water it disturbs the water where it goes in and\r\nthe water moves away from the stone to the sides, and as the stone\r\ngoes down, over and up above it, and the whole body of the water is\r\ndisturbed in such a way that makes the ripple appear on the surface and\r\nspread out in every direction. As the stone goes down into the water\r\nfurther and further the disturbance is repeated and ring after ring\r\nappears on the surface.\r\n\r\nOf course there are many disturbances in the water at all times. Many\r\nthings may happen to break up your little ring of ripples before they\r\ntouch the sides of the ocean--a ship--a fish--the wind--or one of many\r\nother things, and because this is true you would have difficulty in\r\nsending the waves made by your little pebble across the ocean, but you\r\ncan take a dishpan from the kitchen and after filling it with water\r\ndrop pebbles into it as nearly the middle as possible, and you will see\r\nthe ripples or waves your pebble makes spread out from the point where\r\nthe pebble entered the water in all directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are There Many Languages?\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent languages developed in different parts of the world\r\nbecause there was no inter-communication between people in different\r\ncommunities, and each was really developing a language for itself.\r\nIn doing so they developed their language without knowing that other\r\ncommunities were working out the same problems for themselves. So\r\nthey first developed their own sign and gesture language and later\r\non their word or sound language and kept on using it. While they may\r\nthus have developed the use of some of the same signs and sounds or\r\ncombination of sounds to express one thing perfectly understandable to\r\nthemselves, these sounds or combinations of sounds might mean something\r\nentirely different to another community, where that particular sound or\r\ncombination of sounds may have been hit upon to mean something entirely\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nOf course, not all languages were developed in this way. There are,\r\nyou know, a great many languages used in the world. Some of them are\r\noffshoots of others, where part of a community moved to another part of\r\nthe world, taking their language with them, but developing it further\r\nalong new lines, and using new combinations of sounds for new words.\r\nThen also, there are many words which mean the same thing in different\r\nlanguages and are spoken with practically the same sounds. This is due\r\nto the movement of people from one nation to another and bringing their\r\nown words with them, so to speak. In many instances a stranger would\r\ncome to another nation, and use his own word for expressing a certain\r\nthing and that would eventually be taken up and used as a better word,\r\nand the old word dropped. It is strange that this should be true, but\r\nthis accounts for the fact that many words are the same in sound and\r\nmeaning in numerous languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes a Match Light When We Strike It?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe match lights when we rub it along a rough substance, because the\r\nrubbing produces sufficient heat on the end of the match to set fire\r\nto the head, as we call it, which is made of chemicals that light more\r\neasily than the stick of wood, which is the rest of the match. The fire\r\nthus started is hot enough and burns long enough to set fire to the\r\nwooden part of the match.\r\n\r\nTo explain this more fully, let me say this. Rub your finger quickly\r\nalong your coat sleeve or along the seat of your trousers, long a\r\nfavorite place for men to strike matches, pretending that your finger\r\nis a match. You find the end of your finger becomes warm, don’t you?\r\nNot warm enough to set your finger on fire, of course, but if you had\r\nthe same combination of chemicals on the end of your finger that there\r\nis on the match, you would set the chemicals afire and this would burn\r\nyour finger, just as it sets fire to the wooden part of the match.\r\n\r\nIt took a great many years to discover the combination of chemicals of\r\nwhich the head of the match is made. Before that discovery was made it\r\nwas far from easy to light the light in the evening as it is now. It\r\nmust have been a serious thing to let the fire go out in the furnace in\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Kettle Whistle?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kettle whistles only when the water boils and the steam or gas\r\nwhich is the form the water turns into when boiling is trying to\r\nescape through the spout of the kettle. You see, when the water starts\r\nboiling, the inside of the kettle is at once filled with steam and more\r\nis coming out of the water all the time. This steam must get out some\r\nway, so it rushes for the spout of the kettle, and because so much of\r\nit is trying to get out of a comparatively small opening at once there\r\nis quite a pressure and this results in making the whistle out of the\r\nspout of the kettle. It is just the same process as when you whistle\r\nyourself. To whistle you fill your mouth with air and force it out\r\nthrough your lips, which you have closed excepting for a small opening,\r\nby the pressure you can bring to bear with the roof and sides of your\r\nmouth, and if you have learned to make your lips into the proper shape\r\nand apply the pressure steadily you can sound a very long note and make\r\ndifferent notes by making the opening in your lips large or small. The\r\nkettle spout has only one size of opening so the sound is practically\r\nthe same at all times though louder at sometimes than at others. This\r\nis caused by the varying pressure at which the steam in the kettle is\r\nbeing forced out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Water From a Fountain Shoot Into the Air?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe water from the fountain shoots into the air because water anywhere\r\nwill run down if given a chance. To produce a fountain you must have\r\na source of water supply for the fountain which is higher than the\r\nopenings of the fountain out of which the water shoots. The water comes\r\nout of the holes in the fountain for the same reason that it comes out\r\nof the faucet in the kitchen or bath room. In the latter case the water\r\ncomes from the waterworks reservoir in which the level of the water is\r\nmuch higher than the opening in the faucet in your home. Being higher\r\nthe water in the reservoir is trying to get away through the pipes all\r\nthe time and all the pipes leading from the reservoir are full of this\r\nwater trying to get away. Just as soon as you turn the valve in the\r\nfaucet the water comes out and runs down into the bowl.\r\n\r\nIf you were to turn the opening of the faucet up instead of down as\r\nit is, the water would shoot up instead of down. Not very much, it\r\nis true, but it would act much like the water from the fountain. The\r\nreason it does not shoot up high in the air like a fountain is because\r\nthe opening in the faucet is the same size as the opening in the\r\nlittle pipe which leads the water from the street into the house. If\r\nyou would turn the opening of the faucet up and attach to it a pipe\r\nwhich made the opening much smaller (the size of the opening in the\r\nfountains), you would see the water shoot into the air just as it does\r\nfrom the fountain. When you reduce the size of the opening you increase\r\nthe pressure of the water coming from the pipes in proportion to the\r\nreduction you have made in the size of the opening.\r\n\r\nWater from the fountain will not, however, shoot as high as the level\r\nof the water in the reservoir because, as soon as it leaves the pipes,\r\nit encounters the pressure of the air outside the pipes and the law of\r\ngravitation which pulls all things toward the center of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is not natural for water to shoot into the air as it does in a\r\nfountain. The only way water can go naturally is down, and it only goes\r\nup a little way from a fountain because of the pressure of the water in\r\nthe pipes behind the openings in the pipes in the fountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Keeps a Balloon Up?\r\n\r\n\r\nA balloon stays up in the air, because of the air in it, together with\r\nthe weight of the balloon, is less than an equal bulk of the air in\r\nwhich it floats.\r\n\r\nIn former days of ballooning the balloons were filled with hot air and\r\nwere then found to rise and stay up until the air inside of the balloon\r\nbecame of the same temperature as that in which it floated. When this\r\nstage was reached, the balloon itself would fall because the material\r\nof which it was made was denser than air.\r\n\r\nToday balloonists fill their balloons with gas which is lighter than\r\nair, even when as cool as the air in which they rise and are thus able\r\nto stay up a long time.\r\n\r\nYou, of course, have seen many of the red, white and blue paper\r\nballoons which are sent up on the Fourth of July. You will remember\r\nthat father, or whoever it is that is sending them up, lights the\r\noil-soaked knot of cloth that is attached to the balloon immediately\r\nbelow the opening at the bottom. He first lights this and then holds\r\nthe balloon for a time with his hands.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, you will remember that the balloon starts upward with\r\nfather still holding it. This is because the air inside the balloon\r\nis becoming heated. You will notice also that at first he has to hold\r\nout the sides of the top of the balloon with his hands or has some\r\none help him do this, but that even so the balloon does not stand out\r\nround and full as it should. When the balloon starts to rise, however,\r\nyou will notice that it is round and full. This is because the air in\r\nthe balloon has become heated and is expanding. Soon the balloon is\r\ntugging to get away and father lets go and it rises and sails away with\r\nthe wind. As long as the fire below it burns, and if the wind does not\r\nupset it so as to make the paper part catch fire, the balloon will stay\r\nup; but, when the fire burns out, the balloon will come down.\r\n\r\nThe balloon merely rises because the air inside, and held there by the\r\ncovering of the balloon, is warmer air and lighter than the air on the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Did People of Long Ago Live Longer Than We Do Now?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen reading of people who lived long years ago and especially when\r\nreading about the length of their lives, we are told that in the old\r\ndays people lived longer than they do now. Some of the early historical\r\nrecords speak of single individuals who lived hundreds of years. There\r\nis great doubt as to whether these statements are founded on fact. In\r\nthinking about this we must first take into consideration that these\r\nrecords of long ages were recorded at a time when man had no accurate\r\nideas of the actual passage of long periods of time such as a year.\r\nThey did not have our calendar as a basis for figuring at all. Learned\r\nmen now tell us that the actual age of men who lived at the time these\r\nrecords of great ages were recorded probably lived shorter lives\r\nthan we do now, and that what they record as a period of one year was\r\nprobably a much shorter period than one year.\r\n\r\nIt is true beyond the question of a doubt that the people of today live\r\nlonger on the average than people who lived ten, twenty or more years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the average period of life has increased steadily.\r\nThis is due to the fact that we have taken great care of our bodies;\r\nhave improved the conditions in which we live, and made them more\r\nsanitary; have learned to fight and check and eradicate diseases, which\r\nonly a few years ago we could not prevent people dying of when they\r\nonce contracted them, and we know from the records which we keep that\r\nactually people live longer on the average today than only a few years\r\nago, and it is safe to say that they live longer now on the average\r\nthan at any time in the world’s history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs There a Reason for Everything?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world is so constructed that there must be a reason or cause for\r\neverything. There are so many forces in the world that man has not yet\r\nbeen able to locate the original cause of every one of them. Concerning\r\nother things, he sees the effects without having any knowledge of the\r\nforces which are their cause. Other things he has never even bothered\r\nto inquire about, but simply takes them for granted. But every force,\r\nwhich means, of course, everything in the world, must have had a\r\nbeginning and therefore something or a combination of things must have\r\ncaused it to begin, and the thing or things that caused it to be is the\r\nreason for its being. Every little while someone makes a discovery of\r\nsome new force, and then we suddenly realize that this force has been\r\nin existence all the time although not known to man, and we discover\r\nthrough this the reason for many other things being as they are.\r\n\r\nThe other thing or side of the question is also true. We cannot have\r\na cause without an effect. You cannot do anything without causing\r\nsomething to happen and producing an effect on one or more other\r\nobjects either animate or inanimate. You cannot move your hand without\r\ncreating some disturbance in the air. When you make a noise, low or\r\nloud, you produce sound waves. When you burn a stick of wood, you\r\ncreate smoke, ashes and gases of various kinds. You change the whole\r\nnature of what was the piece of wood, and yet no particle of what made\r\nthe stick of wood is ever destroyed or lost, but appears in some other\r\nthing in the air or on or in the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes an Echo?\r\n\r\n\r\nAn echo is caused when the waves of air which you create when you shout\r\nare thrown back again when they are stopped by something they encounter\r\nand are turned back without changing their shape. Any kind of a sound\r\nwave will make an echo in this way.\r\n\r\nYou see, you can have no sound of any kind without sound waves. You\r\ncould not make a sound if there were no air. Now, when you shout, you\r\nstart a series of sound waves that go out from you in every direction\r\nand they spread away from you in circles just like the rings of ripples\r\nthat are caused when you drop a stone into a pool of water. You can\r\nprove this to yourself easily by having one, two, three or more of your\r\nfriends stand around you in a large circle. You can place them as far\r\naway from you as your shout can be heard if you wish. When you shout,\r\neach of your friends will hear the shout at the same time, provided, of\r\ncourse, they are at equal distances from you.\r\n\r\nSometimes these sound waves as they go away from you in circles strike\r\nobjects that turn the waves back unbroken just as they came to them.\r\nThe waves will bounce back just like a rubber ball from a wall against\r\nwhich it has been thrown and this is the echo. However, some things\r\nthat the sound waves strike break up these waves entirely and others\r\npartially.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you have sometimes noticed when you shout you hear a distinct\r\necho and that at other times, standing in the same place, you cannot\r\nhear any echo, although you shout in the same way. This is explained by\r\nthe fact that at times conditions of the air are such that no echo is\r\nproduced while at other times a perfect echo results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Whispering Gallery?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of an echo have to be taken into account by the\r\narchitects and builders of all public buildings, such as theaters,\r\nhalls and churches, where anyone is to speak or entertain others.\r\nUnless they are very careful the walls and ceilings may be so arranged\r\nthat when any one sings or speaks in the room, there is such an echo\r\nthat it interferes with the music or speaking. It sometimes happens\r\nalso that through some peculiarity in which the walls and ceiling of\r\na building are constructed there will be certain places in the room\r\nwhere an echo can be heard, even a whisper, and which cannot be heard\r\nin other parts of the room at all. This is likely to occur in rooms\r\nwhere there is a dome-shaped ceiling. There will be certain spots in\r\nthe room hundreds of feet apart, where if you stand on one spot and\r\nanother person is on another definite spot clear across the room, the\r\ntiniest whisper can be heard, while the people in between cannot hear\r\nat all. This is called a whispering gallery. Of course, loud talking\r\nwould produce the same effect. A whispering gallery is a gallery with\r\nan echo which can be heard from certain positions. There are a number\r\nof famous whispering galleries of the world. In the room beneath the\r\ngreat dome of our Capitol at Washington is an almost perfect whispering\r\ngallery. There are quite a number of points at which you can stand and\r\nhear the whispers across the room which is more than a hundred feet.\r\nThese whispering galleries come accidentally, of course. It would be\r\ndifficult to deliberately construct a building in such a way as to\r\nproduce a whispering gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Get a Bump Instead of a Dent When We Knock Our Heads?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you knock your head against a sharp corner, or if some one hits\r\nyou on the head with anything with a sharp edge, you do receive a dent\r\nin your head, but it does not last. In other words, the head has one of\r\nthe qualities of a rubber ball. You can press your finger against the\r\nsides of the rubber ball and push it in, but when you take your finger\r\noff the ball resumes its shape. Just so with your head--it resumes its\r\nshape after a blow.\r\n\r\nAfter doing this, however, a bump or lump is formed. I will endeavor to\r\ntell you how the bump is formed or rather what causes it to form. You\r\ncannot knock your head against anything that is harder than your head\r\nwithout causing some injury to the parts which received the bump. Now,\r\nwhat happens then is just what happens to any other part of your body\r\nwhen it is injured whether as a result of a bump, a cut or a bee or\r\nmosquito sting.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the injury occurs the brain starts the “repair crew” to\r\nwork. The result is that first a great supply of blood is rushed to the\r\ninjured part with the result that the blood vessels are filled up and\r\nextended with blood. Certain parts of the blood cells find their way\r\nthrough the walls of the blood vessels at the part of the injury and\r\nother fluids from the body are piled up there, so to speak, to form a\r\ncongestion. This “piling up or congestion” distends the skin and raises\r\nthe bump. On the head where the layer of muscular structure is thinner\r\nand where there is less space between the bones of the skull and the\r\noutside skin, the bump will be larger and more noticeable, because a\r\ngood deal of blood and other fluids are piled up in a comparatively\r\nsmall space, and so the skin gets pushed out further to accommodate\r\nthis great congestion, whereas in other parts of the body the bump may\r\nbe quite as large but not so noticeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW MEN GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA\r\n\r\nPUTTING ON THE SUIT.\r\n\r\nSocks, trousers and shirt in one, and a copper breastplate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUTTING ON THE IRON-SOLED SHOES.\r\n\r\nThey are purposely made heavy, to help the diver sink.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Deep Sea Diver\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Does the Bottom of the Sea Look Like?\r\n\r\nIt looks very much like the land on which we live. There are mountains\r\nand valleys, rocks and crags, trees and grass, just the same as we see\r\non land, except, of course, that there are no human beings to be seen.\r\nInstead of birds flitting about the tree-tops, fish swim about them,\r\nand where the squirrel and rabbit bound through the woods on land, the\r\ngreat king crab and sea turtle drag their unwieldy forms on the ocean’s\r\nbottom. Some of the scenes at the bottom of the sea are like fairyland,\r\nand in tropical waters are often as beautiful and spectacular as those\r\nwe see in theatrical pantomimes. Delicately tinted sea-shells, great\r\ntrees of snow-white coral, sea foliage of every tint and shape, and\r\ndeep dark caverns, in which lurk the devil-fish and other odd looking\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diver’s Outfit.\r\n\r\nThe armor of to-day consists of a rubber and canvas suit, socks,\r\ntrousers and shirt in one, a copper breastplate or collar, a copper\r\nhelmet, iron-soled shoes, and a belt of leaden weights to sink the\r\ndiver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADJUSTING THE TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\nThis enables the diver to talk at all times to those above him.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUTTING ON THE HELMET.\r\n\r\nIt is made of tinned copper, with three glass-covered openings, to\r\nenable the diver to look out.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TELEPHONING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN\r\n\r\nTESTING THE TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\nEvery precaution is taken to see that everything is in order before the\r\ndiver goes down.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FINAL TEST.\r\n\r\nThe least error in the adjustment may mean death to the diver.]\r\n\r\nThe helmet is made of tinned copper, with three circular glasses, one\r\nin front and one on either side, with guards to protect them. The\r\nfront eye-piece is made to unscrew and enable the diver to receive\r\nor give instructions without removing the helmet. One or more outlet\r\nvalves are placed at the back or side of the helmet to allow the\r\nvitiated air to escape. These valves only open outwards by working\r\nagainst a spiral spring, so that no water can enter. The inlet valve\r\nis at the back of the helmet, and the air on entry is directed by\r\nthree channels running along the top of the helmet to points above the\r\neye-pieces, enabling the diver to always inhale fresh air. The helmet\r\nis secured to the breastplate below by a segmental screw-bayonet joint,\r\nsecuring attachment by one-eighth of a turn. The junction between the\r\nwater-proof dress and the breastplate is made watertight by means of\r\nstuds, brass plates and wing-nuts.\r\n\r\nA life or signal-line and also a modern telephone enables the diver to\r\ncommunicate at all times with those above him.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a complete diving outfit ranges from $750.00 to $1,000.00.\r\nThe weight of the armor and attachments worn by the diver is 256\r\npounds, divided as follows: Helmet and breastplate, 58 pounds; belt of\r\nlead weights, 122 pounds; rubber suit, 19 pounds; iron-soled shoes, 27\r\npounds each.\r\n\r\nThe air which sustains the diver’s life below the surface is pumped\r\nfrom above by a powerful pump, which must be kept constantly at work\r\nwhile the diver is down. A stoppage of the pump a single instant while\r\nthe diver is in deep water would result almost in his instant death\r\nfrom the pressure of the water outside.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth reached by any diver was 204 feet, at which depth\r\nthere was a pressure of 88¹⁄₂ pounds per square inch on his body. The\r\narea exposed of the average diver in armor is 720 inches, which would\r\nhave made the diver at that depth sustain a pressure of 66,960 pounds,\r\nor over 33 tons.\r\n\r\nThe water pressure on a diver is as follows:\r\n\r\n   20 feet         8¹⁄₂ lbs.\r\n   30 feet        12³⁄₄ lbs.\r\n   40 feet        17¹⁄₄ lbs.\r\n   50 feet        21³⁄₄ lbs.\r\n   60 feet        26¹⁄₄ lbs.\r\n   70 feet        30¹⁄₂ lbs.\r\n   80 feet        34³⁄₄ lbs.\r\n   90 feet        39    lbs.\r\n  100 feet        43¹⁄₂ lbs.\r\n  120 feet        52¹⁄₄ lbs.\r\n  130 feet        56¹⁄₂ lbs.\r\n  140 feet        60³⁄₄ lbs.\r\n  150 feet        65¹⁄₄ lbs.\r\n  160 feet        69³⁄₄ lbs.\r\n  170 feet        74    lbs.\r\n  180 feet        78    lbs.\r\n  190 feet        82¹⁄₄ lbs.\r\n  204 feet        88¹⁄₂ lbs.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of diving are manifold, and so risky is the calling that\r\nthere are comparatively few divers in the United States. The cheapest\r\nof them command $10.00 a day for four or five hours’ work, and many of\r\nthem get $50.00 and $60.00 for the same term of labor under water.\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger that besets the diver is the risk he runs every\r\ntime he dives of rupturing a blood-vessel by the excessively compressed\r\nair he is compelled to breathe. He is also subject to attacks from\r\nsharks, sword-fish, devil-fish, and other voracious monsters of\r\nthe ocean’s depths. To defend himself against them, he carries a\r\ndouble-edged knife as sharp as a razor. It is the diver’s sole weapon\r\nof defense.\r\n\r\nJust how far back the art of submarine diving dates is a matter of\r\nconjecture, but until the invention of the present armor and helmet,\r\nin 1839, work and exploration under water was, at best, imperfect, and\r\ncould only be pursued in a very limited degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeats of Divers.\r\n\r\n~THE GREATEST DIVING FEAT~\r\n\r\nMillions of dollars’ worth of property has been recovered from the\r\nocean’s depth by divers. One of the greatest achievements in this line\r\nwas by the famous English diver, Lambert, who recovered vast treasure\r\nfrom the “Alfonso XII,” a Spanish mail steamer belonging to the Lopez\r\nLine, which sank off Point Gando, Grand Canary, in 26¹⁄₂ fathoms of\r\nwater. The salvage party was dispatched by the underwriters in May,\r\n1885, the vessel having £100,000 in specie on board. For nearly six\r\nmonths the operations were persevered in before the divers could reach\r\nthe treasure-room beneath the three decks. Two divers lost their lives\r\nin the vain attempt, the pressure of water being fatal. The diver\r\nrecovered £90,000 from the wreck, and got £4,500 for doing it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult operations ever performed by a diver was the\r\nrecovering of the treasure sunk in the steamship “Malabar,” off Galle.\r\nOn this occasion the large iron plates, half an inch thick, had to be\r\ncut away from the mail-room, and then the diver had to work through\r\nnine feet of sand. The whole of the specie on board this vessel--upward\r\nof $1,500,000--was saved, as much as $80,000 having been gotten out in\r\none day.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that from time to time expeditions have been\r\nfitted out, and companies formed, with the sole intention of searching\r\nfor buried treasure beneath the sea. Again and again have expeditions\r\nleft New York or San Francisco in the certainty of recovering tons of\r\nbullion sunk off the Brazilian coast, or lying undisturbed in the mud\r\nof the Rio de la Plata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The last look just before going down.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coming up after a successful trip.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1885, the large steamer Imbus, belonging to the P. & O.\r\nCo., sank off Trincomalee, having on board a very valuable East-India\r\ncargo, together with a large amount of specie. This was another case\r\nof a fortune found in the sea, for a very large amount of treasure was\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nAnother wreck from which a large sum of gold coin and bullion was\r\nrecovered by divers, was that of the French ship “L’Orient.” She\r\nis stated to have had on board specie to the value of no less than\r\n$3,000,000, besides other treasure.\r\n\r\nA parallel case to “L’Orient” is that of the “Lutine,” a warship of\r\nthirty-two guns, wrecked off the coast of Holland. This vessel sailed\r\nfrom the Yarmouth Roads with an immense quantity of treasure for the\r\nTexel. In the course of the day it came on to blow a heavy gale; the\r\nvessel was lost and went to pieces. Salvage operations by divers,\r\nduring eighteen months, resulted in the recovery of £400,000 in specie.\r\n\r\nHumorous scenes do not play much of a part on the ocean’s bottom, and\r\nthe sublime and awe-inspiring are far more in evidence there than the\r\nludicrous, yet even beneath the waves there are laughable scenes at\r\ntimes. A diver had been engaged to inspect a sunken vessel off the\r\ncoast of Cuba. Arriving on the scene he discovered a number of native\r\nsponge-divers, who descend to considerable depths, diving down from\r\ntheir canoes to the sunken vessel trying to pick up something of value.\r\nThey paid little attention to the arrival of the wrecking outfit, and\r\ndid not notice the diver descend, until suddenly what seemed to them to\r\nbe a horrible human-shaped monster, with an immense head of glistening\r\ncopper and three big, round, glassy eyes, came walking around the\r\nvessel’s bow and made a big salaam to them. That was enough. They shot\r\nsurfaceward like sky-rockets, climbed frantically into their canoes and\r\nhurriedly rowed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens When Anything Explodes?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy explosives are meant substances that can be made to give off a large\r\nquantity of gas in an exceedingly short time, and the shorter the time\r\nrequired for the production of the gas the greater will be the violence\r\nof the explosion. Many substances that ordinarily have no explosive\r\nqualities may be made to act as explosives under certain circumstances.\r\nWater, for example, has caused very destructive boiler explosions when\r\na quantity of it has been allowed to enter an empty boiler that had\r\nbecome red hot. Particles of dust in the air have occasioned explosions\r\nin saw mills, where the air always contains large quantities of dust.\r\nA flame introduced into air that is heavily laden with dust may cause\r\na sudden burning of the particles near it, and from these the fire may\r\nbe conveyed so rapidly to the others that the heat will cause the air\r\nto expand suddenly, and this, together with the formation of gases from\r\nthe burning, will cause an explosion.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that fine sawdust or water would\r\nordinarily be classed as explosives. The term is generally applied only\r\nto those substances that may be very easily caused to explode.\r\n\r\nThe oldest, and most widely known, explosive that we possess is\r\ngunpowder, the invention of which is generally credited to the Chinese.\r\nIt is a mixture of potassium nitrate, or saltpeter, with powdered\r\ncharcoal and sulphur. The proportions in which these substances are\r\nmixed vary in different kinds of powder, but they usually do not differ\r\nmuch from the following:\r\n\r\n  Sulphur        10 per cent.\r\n  Charcoal       16 per cent.\r\n  Saltpeter      74 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe explosive quality of gunpowder is due to the fact that it will burn\r\nwith great rapidity without contact with the air, and that in burning\r\nit liberates large volumes of gas. When a spark is introduced into it,\r\nthe carbon, charcoal, and sulphur combine with a portion of the oxygen\r\ncontained in the saltpeter to form carbonic acid gas and sulphurous\r\nacid gas, and at the same time the nitrogen contained in the saltpeter\r\nis set free in the gaseous form. This action takes place very suddenly,\r\nand the volume of gas set free is so much greater than that of the\r\npowder that an explosion follows.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of gunpowder all that is absolutely necessary is to\r\nmix the three ingredients thoroughly and in the proper proportions.\r\nBut to fit the powder for use in firing small arms and cannon it is\r\nmade into grains of various sizes, the small sizes being used for the\r\nsmall arms with short barrels, and the large sizes for cannon. The\r\nreason for this is that if the powder is made in very small grains it\r\nall burns at once, and the explosion takes place so suddenly that an\r\nexceedingly strong gun is required to withstand the explosion, while if\r\nlarger grains are employed the burning is slower and continues until\r\nthe projectile has traveled to the muzzle of the gun. In this way the\r\nprojectile is fired from the gun with as much force as if the explosion\r\nhad taken place at once, but there is less strain on the gun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes the Smoke When a Gun Goes Off?\r\n\r\n\r\nPowder of this latter kind always produces a considerable quantity of\r\nsmoke when it is fired, because there is a quantity of fine particles\r\nformed from the breaking up of the saltpeter and from some of the\r\ncharcoal which is not completely burned. This smoke forms a cloud that\r\ntakes some time to clear away, which is a very objectionable feature.\r\nIn order to get rid of it, efforts were made to produce a substance\r\nthat would explode without leaving any solid residue, and that could be\r\nused in guns. These efforts were finally successful, and there are now\r\nseveral brands of smokeless powder in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Smokeless Powder Made Of?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory forms of smokeless powder are all made from\r\nguncotton or nitrocellulose. This substance, which is made by treating\r\ncotton with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, is a chemical\r\ncompound, not a mixture like gunpowder; and when it is exploded it is\r\nall converted into gases, of which the chief ones are carbonic acid\r\ngas, nitrogen, and water-vapor. To cause the explosion of guncotton it\r\nis not necessary to burn it, but a mere shock or jar will cause it to\r\ndecompose with explosive violence. Of course, such a violent explosive\r\nas this could not be used either in small arms or in cannon, but\r\nguncotton can be converted into less explosive forms which are suitable\r\nfor use in guns, and the majority, of smokeless powders are made in\r\nthis way. The methods used in producing the smokeless powders are kept\r\nsecret by the various countries that use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Nitroglycerine?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother very powerful explosive, which is closely related to guncotton,\r\nis nitroglycerine. This compound is made by treating glycerine with the\r\nsame sort of acid mixture that is used in making guncotton. It explodes\r\nin the same way that guncotton does and yields the same products. It is\r\nan oily liquid of yellow color, and on account of its liquid form it is\r\ndifficult to handle and use. The difficulty in handling nitroglycerine\r\nled to the plan of mixing it with a quantity of very fine sand called\r\ninfusorial earth. When mixed with this a solid mass called dynamite is\r\nformed, which is easier to handle and more difficult to explode, but\r\nwhich has almost as much explosive force as nitroglycerine.\r\n\r\nA more powerful explosive than either nitroglycerine or guncotton is\r\nobtained by mixing them together. When this is done the guncotton\r\nswells up by absorbing the nitroglycerine and becomes a brownish,\r\njelly-like substance that is known as blasting gelatin. This is\r\ngenerally considered the most powerful explosive obtainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Nitroglycerine and Guncotton Explode So Readily?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now consider for the moment what it is that makes guncotton,\r\nnitroglycerine, and blasting gelatin explode so readily. The\r\nexplanation is found in the presence in them of nitrogen. As you\r\nremember from what you learned about air, nitrogen is an extremely\r\ninactive element. It has no strong tendency to combine with other\r\nelements, and when it does enter into combination with them the\r\ncompounds formed are almost always easily decomposed. In the compounds\r\nthat have just been described a shock causes a loosening of the bonds\r\nthat hold the nitrogen, and the whole compound goes to pieces just as\r\nan arch falls when the keystone is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Silver?\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the earliest time recorded in history, silver has been the\r\nmost used of the precious metals, both in the arts and as a medium\r\nof exchange. Even in the prehistoric times silver mines were worked\r\nand the metal was employed in the ornamental and useful arts. It was\r\nnot so early used as money, and when it began to be adopted for this\r\npurpose, it was made into bars or rings and sold by weight. The first\r\nregular coinage of either gold or silver was in Phrygia, or Lydia,\r\nin Asia Minor. Silver was used in the arts by the Athenians, the\r\nPhœnicians, the Vikings, the Aztecs, the Peruvians, and in fact by all\r\nthe civilized and semi-civilized nations of antiquity. It is found\r\nin almost every part of the globe, usually in combination with other\r\nmetals. The mines in South America, Mexico, and the United States are\r\nespecially rich. Silver is sometimes found in huge nuggets. A mass\r\nweighing 800 pounds was found in Peru, and it is claimed that one of\r\n2,700 pounds was extracted in Mexico. The ratio of the value of silver\r\nand gold has varied greatly. At the Christian era it was 9 to 1; 500\r\nA.D. it was 18 to 1; but in 1100 A.D. it was only 8 to 1. In 1893\r\nit was as high as 2,577 to 1. The subject has entered largely into\r\nAmerican politics as a disturbing element, and in 1896 the Democratic\r\nparty, in its national convention, declared for the free coinage of the\r\nmetals at 16 to 1. The Republican party adhered to the gold standard\r\nand declared against the free coinage of silver. Each party reaffirmed\r\nin 1900 this plank in its platform. In both years the Democrats were\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Worry?\r\n\r\n\r\nWorry is a feeling of fear, but is never of the present. It is always\r\nabout something that may happen or that has happened. It is generally\r\nin the future, sometimes in the past, but never in the present.\r\n\r\nAn animal that knows neither future nor past cannot worry. Babies,\r\nliving only as they do in the present, cannot worry. All creatures,\r\nexcepting human beings, live only in the present and therefore they do\r\nnot worry, for such creatures cannot remember what happened in the past\r\nor guess what is going to happen.\r\n\r\nA human being after arriving at a certain age is given such powers\r\nthat his mind can go back to the past and cast itself forward into the\r\nfuture as he thinks it will be, because he has imagination. As a matter\r\nof fact we live less in the present than in the past or future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Worry?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe worry because we are able through a power called self-consciousness\r\nto place ourselves through our minds for the time being. Either--back\r\nsomewhere in the past without carrying our physical bodies with us; for\r\nif we could take our bodies with us, we would be in the present again,\r\nand then worry is impossible; or, we use our imagination and project\r\nthe future entirely apart from our bodies, for we cannot project our\r\nbodies into the future, and if we could we would again be in the\r\npresent. We worry over going to have an operation performed which may\r\nor not be dangerous, but quite necessary. We may still think we worry\r\nwhen the operation begins, but as soon as that occurs the time becomes\r\nthe present, and though we may fear, we cannot worry in the present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Back View of Shield_\r\n\r\n  _Longitudinal Section through Shield & Tunnel_\r\n\r\n  _Diagram showing method of tunnel construction by shield and\r\n  compressed air._\r\n\r\n  _Scale; ¹⁄₈ inch · 1 foot_\r\n\r\n  _Jacobs & Davies Inc. 30 Church St. N.Y._\r\n\r\n  _Oct. 15. 1910._\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Tunnel\r\n\r\n\r\nHow a Tunnel Is Dug Under Water.\r\n\r\nFig. 1. On the left is a cross section showing, in diagram, the back\r\nview of a shield. The heavy black circle is the “tail” or “skin.”\r\nThe small circles within the tail are the hydraulic rams which at a\r\npressure of 5,000 pounds to the square inch force the shield forward.\r\nThe square compartments within the shield are the openings through\r\nwhich the men pass to dig away the ground. In the middle of the shield\r\nis shown the swinging “erector” which picks up the iron lining plates\r\nand puts them in position.\r\n\r\nThe view on the right is a longitudinal section of the tunnel showing\r\nthe shield and the bulkhead wall across the tunnel with the air locks\r\nbuilt into it. The front of the shield ahead of the doors is made with\r\na sharp edge called the “cutting edge” and this makes it easier for the\r\nshield to advance in case all the ground in front has not been removed.\r\nThis view shows how the tail overlaps the last portion of the iron\r\nlining.\r\n\r\nSome distance behind the shield comes the concrete bulkhead wall with\r\nthe air locks contained in it. There are two shown in the view. The\r\nupper one is the emergency air lock, always kept ready so that in case\r\nof an accident the men have a means of escape even though the lower\r\npart of the tunnel is filled with rushing water or mud. The lower air\r\nlock is for the passage of men and materials during ordinary working.\r\nThis view also shows that all the tunnel ahead of the bulkhead wall\r\nis under compressed air while the finished tunnel behind the bulkhead\r\nwall is under the ordinary or normal air pressure. When the tunnel is\r\nfinished the air locks and bulkhead walls are removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONT VIEW OF A DRIVING SHIELD\r\n\r\nThis shows the front of one of the shields used on the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad tunnels crossing the North River at New York. The cutting edge\r\nis clearly seen and the various compartments, each with its door, which\r\ndivide up the front of the shield. These shields weighed about 200 tons\r\neach.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TUNNELS ARE BUILT.\r\n\r\nThese notes describe very generally the way in which tunnels are built\r\nthrough mud and gravel under parts of the sea or large rivers in such\r\na way that the men who build them are protected and as safe as the\r\ncarpenter who is building a house.\r\n\r\nThe way these tunnels are built is called the “shield” way because\r\nthe machine used is called a shield. It is given this name because it\r\nshields the tunnel builders from the water and the mud which are ready\r\nat every moment to overwhelm them and kill them.\r\n\r\nThe shield was invented in 1818 by a great Engineer, Marc Isambard\r\nBrunel, who was a Frenchman living in England. The idea of the shield\r\ncame to him as he saw how the sea worm which attacks the wooden piles\r\nof docks along the shore bores the holes it makes in the wood. The head\r\nof this worm is very hard and can bite its way through the hardest\r\nwoods. As it goes through the wood its body makes a hard shelly coating\r\nwhich lines the holes which its head has made and prevents the hole\r\nfrom getting filled up. This is the general idea of a tunnel built by a\r\nshield.\r\n\r\nThe first shield was used by Mr. Brunel to make a tunnel across the\r\nThames River at London, England. This is still the biggest tunnel\r\never built by a shield, although not the longest, and is still\r\nused by railroad trains. This tunnel was begun in 1825 and was\r\nfinished in 1843, and provides a history of almost unexampled and\r\nnot-to-be-excelled courage in attacking difficulties and skill in\r\ndefeating them.\r\n\r\nSince the days of Brunel many great improvements have been made in the\r\nshield and in the way of working it but the same idea is still there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE SHIELD IS PUSHED FORWARD\r\n\r\nThis shows the rear end or tail end of one of the smaller shields, used\r\non the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad tunnels under the North or Hudson\r\nRiver at New York. It shows the skin, the hydraulic jacks within the\r\nskin and the piping and valves for working them. It also shows the\r\ndoors leading to the front or “face.” The erector is not shown, but the\r\ncircular hole in the middle shows where it would be attached.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This shows one side of an air lock bulkhead wall with\r\nthe air lock in place. The boiler-like appearance of the lock is\r\nclearly visible, as well as the door and the pressure gauge to tell the\r\nair pressure inside the lock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is a rear view of one of the Pennsylvania Tunnel\r\nshields, taken after a length of tunnel had been completed. All the\r\ndetails of construction are shown, but in this case the erector is\r\nclearly seen also. The valves which control the erector and the rams\r\nwhich push the shield forward are seen near the top of the shield. The\r\nrods across the tunnel are turn-buckles used to keep the iron lining\r\nfrom getting out of shape in the soft mud. These are removed later. The\r\nfloor and tracks in the bottom are temporary and are used for bringing\r\nmaterials to and from the shield.]\r\n\r\nAfter the days of Brunel’s shield another great help was given to\r\ntunnel builders by the invention of the use of compressed air to hold\r\nback the water which saturates the ground in which the tunnel is being\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\n~WHO INVENTED THE COMPRESSED AIR METHOD~\r\n\r\nThe first real invention of compressed air for this purpose was made\r\nby Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane who, in 1830, took out a patent for the\r\nuse of compressed air to expel the water from the ground in shafts and\r\ntunnels and, by this means, to convert the ground from a condition of\r\nquicksand to one of firmness. This patent covers all the essential\r\nfeatures of compressed air working.\r\n\r\nAs suggested above, the thing which compressed air does in a tunnel\r\nis to push the water out from all the spaces which it fills in the\r\nground, so that the men who are digging away the ground for the tunnel\r\nare working in firm dry ground instead of a mixture of earth and water\r\nwhich will run into and fill the hole they dig as soon as it is dug.\r\n\r\nWhenever a tunnel is being built below a body of water through ground\r\nwhich is porous, or in other words through any ground except solid\r\nrock or dense clay, the water fills every crevice and space in the\r\nground and is exerting a pressure of about half a pound per square inch\r\nabove the ordinary pressure of the air, (which is 15 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch) for every foot of depth below the surface of the water;\r\nso that supposing the tunnel is 40 feet below the water the water has\r\na pressure of nearly 20 pounds per square inch on every square inch\r\nof the surface of the tunnel. This pressure causes the water to flow\r\nviolently into any hole or opening that is made in the ground, and,\r\nunless the water is prevented from moving by some means or other, the\r\nopening made would be very quickly filled with water and also with\r\nground as the rush of water will carry the sand, gravel or mud with it.\r\n\r\nBy Cochrane’s invention the whole tunnel is filled with air under\r\na pressure equal to the pressure of the water. This compressed air\r\ntherefore balances the pressure of the water and holds it back from\r\nmoving, and if the pressure of the air is made slightly greater than\r\nthat of the water the water is driven back from the tunnels for a short\r\ndistance so that when the tunnel is being dug the ground instead of\r\nbeing wet is quite dry.\r\n\r\nThis explains the principles of the shield and compressed air way of\r\nmaking a tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe following describes very shortly how these principles are put to\r\nactual use.\r\n\r\nMost tunnels which are built by shield and compressed air under rivers\r\nor arms of the sea are lined with cast iron plates to protect the\r\nrailway or roadway which is in the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel is a circular tube, or shell, and the plates have flanges\r\non all sides which are bolted together. This shell is put into place,\r\nplate by plate, by means of the shield which not only protects the\r\nworkmen and the work under construction, but which helps to build the\r\niron shell. In fact it corresponds to the sea worm which bores through\r\nthe wood and lines the hole with a shell. In the case of the tunnel\r\nthe shell is made of iron. The shield itself consists of a steel tube\r\nor cylinder slightly bigger in diameter than the tube or tunnel it\r\nis intended to build. The front edge of this shield is made up of a\r\nring of sharp edged castings which form what is called the “cutting\r\nedge.” Just behind the cutting edge is a bulkhead or wall of steel, in\r\nwhich are openings which may be opened or closed at will. Behind this\r\nbulkhead are placed a number of hydraulic jacks or presses arranged\r\naround the shield and within it, so that by thrusting against the last\r\nerected ring of iron lining the whole shield is pushed forward. The\r\nrear end of the shield is a continuation of the cylinder which forms\r\nthe front end, and this part, called the “tail,” always overlaps the\r\nlast few feet of the built up iron shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is a photograph of a model of the Pennsylvania\r\nTunnels to New York City, made for the Jamestown Tercentenary\r\nExposition of 1907. It is given because it illustrates, as no\r\nphotograph of actual work could do, the relationship between the\r\nshield, the tunnel itself and the air lock. This view shows the rear\r\npart of the shield on the extreme left, with the erector picking up an\r\niron plate. It shows a man bringing a car with two of the iron plates\r\nup to the shield. Behind this man comes the bulkhead wall with the\r\nemergency air lock in the top and the ordinary air lock for passing\r\nin and out at the bottom. It also shows the upper platform to the\r\nemergency lock along which the men can get to the emergency lock in\r\ncase of an accident.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is another view of the same model, but showing the\r\nfront view of the shield. The doors on the air locks are clearly shown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is a photograph taken in one of the Pennsylvania\r\ntunnels under the Hudson River. It shows the soft mud, through which\r\nthe tunnel is being built, flowing in a thick stream through one of\r\nthe doors of the shield. The mud under the Hudson, where these tunnels\r\nare, is so soft that often the shield was pushed through the mud with\r\nall the doors shut, so that no mud came into the tunnel and no digging\r\nhad to be done, but the shield pushed its way bodily through the mud,\r\nthe rings of iron lining being built up behind as usual. Generally,\r\nhowever, a certain amount of mud was brought in and had to be removed.\r\nThis photograph shows how it looked.]\r\n\r\n~HOW THE SHIELD CUTS THROUGH THE GROUND~\r\n\r\nThe diagram, Fig. 1, shows more clearly what is meant. From an\r\ninspection of Figure 1 it is clear that, when the openings in the\r\nshield bulkhead are closed, the tunnel is protected from an inrush\r\nof either water or earth; the openings in the bulkhead may be so\r\nregulated that control is maintained over the material passed through.\r\nAfter a ring of iron lining has been erected within the tail of the\r\nshield, the shield doors are opened and men go through them and dig\r\nout enough earth for the shield to go ahead. The rams are then thrust\r\nout thus pushing the shield ahead. Another ring of iron is built up\r\nwithin the tail for which purpose an hydraulic swinging arm, called the\r\n“erector,” is mounted on the shield face. This erector picks up the\r\nplates and puts them into position, one by one, while the men bolt them\r\ntogether. Excavation is then carried on again and the whole round of\r\nwork repeated, gaining every time the jacks are rammed or thrust out\r\na length equal to the length of one ring of iron lining. In carrying\r\nout this work in ground charged with water the shield is assisted by\r\nintroducing compressed air as described before. To use the compressed\r\nair thick bulkhead walls of masonry are built across the tunnel behind\r\nthe shield and into the space between the shield and the bulkhead wall\r\nair is pumped, compressed to the same pressure as that of the water in\r\nthe ground, or in other words the pressure of the air in pounds per\r\nsquare inch is about half the number of feet the tunnel is below the\r\nwater surface. This dries the ground and simplifies enormously the\r\ndifficulty of working in it. The diagram, (Fig. 1) shows a bulkhead\r\nwall across the tunnel. In order to pass from the ordinary air outside\r\nthe bulkhead into the compressed air inside it, all the men and the\r\nmaterials have to pass through the “air locks” which are built into\r\nthe wall. They are called air locks because they are like the locks on\r\na canal which raise the water from a lower to a higher level or lower\r\nit from a higher to a lower level as the case may be. The difference\r\nis that an air lock enables one to pass from air at a low pressure to\r\none of a higher, or vice versa. An air lock is made like a large boiler\r\nwith a door at each end. If we wish to enter the compressed air we\r\nenter the lock from the outside. The door at the end has been tightly\r\nclosed to prevent the compressed air from rushing out. We close the\r\ndoor behind us and are now tightly shut in the boiler-like lock. We now\r\nopen a valve and compressed air begins to flow quickly into the air\r\nlock and the air gets hotter and hotter, due to the compression of the\r\nair. Very likely an intense pain begins to make itself felt in the ears\r\nbut by swallowing hard and blowing the nose it may be relieved. It is\r\ncaused by the air pressure being greater on the outside of the ear drum\r\nthan on the inside. If the delicate ear passages are choked, because\r\nof a cold or some such reason, it is unsafe to go further or the ear\r\ndrum may burst. When the pressure in the air lock has reached that in\r\nthe working chamber, the door leading to the shield may be opened and\r\nwe can pass to the working space and note the work going on. There is\r\nno especial bodily sensation to be felt except a slight exhilaration\r\nand it is curious to find that one cannot whistle. On leaving the\r\ncompressed air we enter the air lock by the door we left; a valve is\r\nturned and the air begins to escape and the pressure in the air lock\r\nbegins to go down. As it does so the air becomes colder and colder\r\nand the whole lock is filled with a wet fog due to the chilling by\r\nexpansion of the air. The air has to be allowed to escape very slowly,\r\nas bubbles of air and gas otherwise form in the blood vessels and\r\ntissues of the body giving rise to the very painful complaint known to\r\ntunnel builders as “the bends,” and in very serious cases to paralysis\r\nand even death. The higher the air pressure the more slowly must one\r\ncome out into the ordinary air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING THE JOINTS WATER TIGHT\r\n\r\nThis shows the erector building up the iron lining in one of the\r\nPennsylvania tunnels at New York. It shows clearly how the iron plates\r\nare bolted together to make the rings of iron lining.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The last, or closing, plate of each iron ring is called\r\nthe “key,” and is much shorter than the others. This photograph shows\r\nthe shield erector on one of the Pennsylvania tunnels picking up and\r\nputting into place a key plate. This picture gives an idea of the mud\r\nand dirt and wet in which the men who work in tunnels have to do their\r\nwork.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wherever possible, every space and crevice outside the\r\niron lining is filled with cement forced, in a liquid state, through\r\nthe iron lining by compressed air. This photograph shows the operation\r\nof “grouting,” as it is called. The man at the left is in control of\r\nthe grouting. He has the hose, through which the grout is forced,\r\nscrewed to a pipe which passes through a hole made for the purpose in\r\nthe iron lining plates and called a “grout hole.” The two men in the\r\nmiddle of the picture are attending to the “grouting machine” by which\r\nthe work is done. Water and cement are fed into the small boiler-like\r\ntank, the tank closed and compressed air admitted thus blowing the\r\nliquid cement through the hose and behind the iron lining. When no\r\nmore grout can be forced behind the iron lining all the space has been\r\nfilled. The man on the right is the engineers’ inspector taking note of\r\nhow much grouting is done, and seeing that the work is properly carried\r\nout.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This shows the process by which the iron lining is made\r\nperfectly water-tight, so that, when the compressed air is taken off,\r\nno water at all can get into the tunnel. Two operations are shown here.\r\nOne is called “grommetting the bolts,” the other is called “caulking\r\nthe joints.” The two men on the left, hanging on to the wrench, are\r\ntightening up the bolts as tight as they can after having put on,\r\nunderneath the washers at the head and nut of each bolt, a ring of\r\nspun yarn dipped in red lead and oil or tar or some such water-proof\r\nmaterial. A few of these “grommets” may be seen at the feet of the\r\nthird man from the left. The other four men are caulking the joints\r\nbetween the iron plates by driving into the joints a mixture of sal\r\nammoniac and iron borings. This sets as hard as iron and if properly\r\ndone makes a perfectly water-tight joint.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REMARKABLE ACCURACY OF ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nUsually when crossing, with a tunnel, a wide river or estuary the\r\ntunnel is started from each shore and the shields are pushed through\r\nthe ground until they meet somewhere about the middle of the river.\r\nThis shows two of the Pennsylvania tunnel shields which have met far\r\nbelow the Hudson River. The white arrow shows where each shield ends.\r\nThe platform of one shield on which the man stands corresponds exactly\r\nwith the platform of the other shield. As may be imagined, it takes\r\nvery careful and skillful engineering and surveying work, both before\r\nthe work is begun and while it is being carried out, to enable tunnel\r\nshields to meet like this. This part of the art of tunnelling would\r\ntake an article to itself.]\r\n\r\nWhen the shield has been pushed across the entire length of the water\r\nway which has to be tunnelled, and the whole of the iron tube or shell\r\nis in place, a thick lining of concrete is placed inside the iron shell\r\nto protect it and make the tunnel stronger. As an added safeguard\r\nwherever the tunnel is in rock, gravel, strong clay or other ground\r\nwhich is not so soft that it does not close tightly in on the outside\r\nof the tube, liquid cement is forced by compressed air through holes\r\nmade in the iron plates for this purpose. This liquid cement enters\r\nevery pore or crevice in the surrounding ground and when it has set\r\nhard it still further protects the iron with a coating of cement.\r\nPieces have been cut out of the iron lining of a tunnel built under the\r\nriver Thames at London, England, in 1869, which showed that the iron\r\nat all places was as good as the day it was first put in forty years\r\nbefore, and iron put in the lining of the Hudson River Tunnel about\r\n1878 when removed after thirty years was in perfect condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIELD AT END OF JOURNEY\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, shields are not driven to meet one another, but end\r\ntheir journey at some shaft or in some other tunnel previously built,\r\nafter having gone through thousands of feet of all kinds of ground,\r\nfrom the hardest rock, which had to be blasted out foot by foot before\r\nthe shield could advance, through hard pan, gravel, boulders, piles,\r\nrip-rap, made ground and mud so soft that it flows like melted butter.\r\nNaturally, after an experience like this a shield does not look as\r\nspick and span as when it started in life. This photograph shows one\r\nof the shields of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad in New York just\r\nreaching the end of its journey, battered and bent but still in the\r\nring.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This shows a piece of curved tunnel near Morton Street,\r\non the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, and is given because of the clear\r\nshowing it gives of the iron lining. The track and floor are only the\r\ntemporary roads for use during construction.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sometimes it is necessary to make borings of the ground\r\nbelow the tunnels. In some of these bore holes vast quantities of water\r\nare found at a much higher pressure than the tunnel compressed air.\r\nThis picture shows a spouting bore hole in one of the Pennsylvania\r\ntunnels during construction.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The last thing to do before laying the track is to put\r\nthe concrete inside the iron lining. This picture shows this work going\r\non and the wooden forms or ribs for holding up the concrete while it is\r\nsetting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAND END OF A GREAT TUNNEL UNDER THE HUDSON\r\n\r\nThis view is given to show how complicated an underground structure\r\nmay have to be made to take care of the requirements of traffic. This\r\nview shows the three great reinforced concrete caissons sunk through\r\nthe earth at Jersey City in order to contain the switches and crossings\r\nrequired to form the New Jersey connections of the uptown and downtown\r\ntunnels of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad.\r\n\r\nThese caissons were sunk under air pressure by excavating below them\r\njust as though they were tunnels turned up on end. In sinking these\r\ncaissons the material passed through was water-logged made ground, and\r\nthe hulls of two sunken canal boats were encountered and had to be cut\r\ninto pieces small enough to be taken out through the locks.\r\n\r\nThe usual passenger rushing at high speed in the trains between Jersey\r\nCity and Newark and New York has little idea of the very complicated\r\nstructure necessary to allow of his doing so.\r\n\r\nThe information in this article was supplied by Jacobs & Davies, Inc.,\r\nConsulting Engineers, 30 Church Street, New York, the Engineers for the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, Hudson River Tunnels, the Hudson and Manhattan\r\nRailroad, and many other tunnels in various parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations were kindly supplied by the Pennsylvania Railroad and\r\nthe Hudson and Manhattan Railroad.]\r\n\r\n~DANGERS OF TUNNEL BUILDING~\r\n\r\nThis account of tunnelling by shield and compressed air is very\r\nshort and gives no more than a bare statement of the principles and\r\nchief methods of such work. Nothing has been said of the engineering\r\ndifficulties involved in the design of such work, nor of the delicate\r\nsurveying work necessary if one should hope to start two shields a\r\nmile or two apart and have them meet as shown in Fig. 13 like two\r\ngreat glass tumblers placed rim to rim after having travelled through\r\nthousands of feet of every kind of ground. Nothing has been said of the\r\nmen who work on this most arduous form of subterranean navigation, how\r\nthey cheerfully face the dark and the water ever threatening above them\r\nand the unseen but not less deadly ally, and yet foe, the compressed\r\nair, with its dreaded result, the bends, or the men on the surface\r\nwho keep the air compressors running without pause or stop day in and\r\nday out until the work is done so that their comrades below may work\r\nin safety. Nothing has been said of the curious accidents that are\r\nliable to occur as when the air pressure in the tunnel gets too high,\r\noverbalances the water pressure and blows a hole through the river-bed\r\nand forms a geyser in the river above. It gives no account of the\r\nspecial difficulties which arise when special conditions are found;\r\nfor example, when the lower part of the tunnel is in rock and the\r\nupper part is in soft material. In fact it is nothing more than a bare\r\noutline but it hoped that some, who may not be clear in their minds as\r\nto how tunnels are built, may learn some of the first principles of\r\nthis most romantic kind of work from this bald narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do My Teeth Chatter?\r\n\r\n\r\nYour teeth chatter because when you are cold in a way that makes your\r\nteeth chatter the little muscles which close the jaw act in a series of\r\nquick little contractions which pull the jaw up, and then let it fall\r\nby its own weight. This is repeated many times and, as the action is\r\nquick, the chattering occurs. It is a peculiar thing that this occurs\r\nin spite of the will or brain, when, as a matter of fact, these muscles\r\nwhich operate the jaws are especially under the control of the brain.\r\nThe chattering is really a spasm caused by the cold, and all spasms act\r\nindependent of the will. Cold seems to act on the jaw muscles a good\r\ndeal like some poisons which cause spasms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Did All the Water in the Oceans Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, it did not come from the rivers which empty themselves into the\r\noceans, because the oceans were there before the rivers existed. Part\r\nof it comes from the rivers now, but only a little in comparison to all\r\nthe water there is in the ocean. I will try to tell you simply how all\r\nthe water got into the ocean.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when there was no water on the earth at all. That was\r\nwhen the earth was red hot, just as it is to-day on the inside, and at\r\nthat time all the water we have to-day was up in the air in the form of\r\ngases. Strange as it may seem to you, if you take two gases, one called\r\nhydrogen and the other oxygen, and mix them the right way, they will\r\nturn into water, and if you had the right kind of chemical apparatus\r\nyou could take water and turn it into these gases again. When, then,\r\nthe earth was still all red hot, all of our water was up in the air in\r\nthe form of these two gases. Then, later on, when the amount of heat on\r\nthe earth was just right to make these gases mix together, the water\r\ncame down out of the air in great quantities, and there was so much of\r\nit that it completely covered the whole earth and no land was visible.\r\nLater on, for various reasons, mountains were thrown up on the earth’s\r\nsurface by great earthquakes, and every time a mountain or a high place\r\nwas formed there had to be a hole or low place some place else, and the\r\nwater ran into these low places and stayed there, and that uncovered\r\nmore of the land, because there wasn’t enough water to fill all the\r\nholes and cover the land too, and that is what makes our continents\r\nand islands and all of the land we see. There is now about three times\r\nas much earth covered with water as there is land. Of course, the sun\r\nis always picking up water through what is called evaporation, which\r\nmeans that it is taken into the air in the form of gases. Later it\r\ncomes down again in the form of rain and falls into the oceans or on\r\nthe land, where it sinks in, finally finding a stream or river, and\r\nsooner or later gets back into the ocean again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Don’t the Water in the Ocean Sink In?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that there is a kind of substance at the\r\nbottom of the ocean which the water cannot penetrate, in spite of the\r\ntremendous pressure which the great body of deep water exerts. In all\r\nplaces where the bottom of the ocean has a covering which water can\r\nsink into it does so, but there are such a few places where this is\r\npossible, by comparison, that the amount that gets out that way is not\r\nnoticeable. This water, if it can keep on going, will eventually reach\r\nthe inside of the earth, where it is red hot, and is turned into steam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does the Water in the Ocean Go at Low Tide?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get to the answer of this you must know something about the tides.\r\nThe tide is caused by the pull of the moon on the waters in the ocean.\r\nThe moon revolves about the earth once each day and has the ability to\r\ndraw up the waters in the ocean toward it, as we have seen in our study\r\nof the tides.\r\n\r\nNow, when it is high tide in one place it is low tide in another. The\r\nmoon does not make more water, but only pulls it toward it from side to\r\nside. When it is low tide where we are the water has simply moved as a\r\nbody toward the place where it is high tide.\r\n\r\nThe tides act a good deal like a see-saw, except that they move from\r\nside to side instead of up and down. When one end of the see-saw goes\r\nup the other end goes down, and when the “down” end comes up the other\r\nend goes down. So the answer to your question really is that at low\r\ntide the water which made it high tide a few hours before has gone to\r\nsome place where it is at that moment high tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does the Ocean Look Blue at Times and at Other Times Green?\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes when we look at the ocean from the pavilion or while on the\r\nsand of our favorite bathing beach the water in the ocean looks very\r\nbeautifully blue, and on other days will look dark green from the same\r\npoint. Why is it? If you will stop to think that at night when there is\r\nno moon or other light the water in the ocean looks black, I think you\r\nwill soon be on the right track to answer the question yourself.\r\n\r\nWhen the sky is blue--the kind of blue we like to see in the sky when\r\nwe are at the beach--the water in the ocean is blue, because the sea\r\nreflects the color of the sky, and when the sky is overcast and gray\r\nthe color reflected by the sea will be gray also.\r\n\r\nBut, say you, sometimes the water in the ocean is dark green, and yet\r\nthe sky is never green. Quite true, and I will try to tell you what\r\nproduces the green color. This happens sometimes where the water is\r\nshallow, either near the shore or out further where there is a sandbar\r\nor other shallow place. Sometimes at such points the sunlight strikes\r\nthe water at such an angle that the rays go clear to the bottom and are\r\nreflected from that point--the bottom--to our eyes. In such a case the\r\nlight will be changed through a combination of the color of the bottom\r\nat that point and the color of the sky itself at the time to make the\r\ncolor green as it is reflected to our eyes from the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Water Run?\r\n\r\n\r\nWater runs because it has not enough of anything in it to make it stick\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn school language we call this sticking-together-thing “cohesion.”\r\nThe principle of cohesion makes all the difference there is, so to\r\nspeak, between solids, liquids and gases. A brick, a stone, a stick\r\nof wood, or a piece of iron and all other solid substances have a\r\ncertain amount of this property of cohesion, and the particles stick\r\ntogether, enabling us to build buildings and other things which become\r\npermanent structures. These solid substances are either naturally\r\ncohesive or else man, as in the case of the brick, has brought together\r\ncertain things with little or no cohesion and made them stick together\r\npermanently. In the case of the brick, he takes a quantity of clay,\r\nwhich is cohesive only to a certain degree, bakes it in an oven and\r\nit becomes hard enough--more cohesive--so that he can pile one on top\r\nof the other and make a building. Then he puts sand, mixed with other\r\nthings--lime and water--between the bricks to hold the bricks together,\r\nand makes a structure that will last. Two bricks have no natural\r\ncohesion for each other and, therefore, they can only be held together\r\nby something that has cohesion within itself and also for the bricks.\r\nThe lime, sand and water make mortar which is cohesive when properly\r\nmixed, while in themselves neither lime nor sand have much cohesive\r\nproperty, and water has none at all.\r\n\r\nLiquids have little or no cohesion. Water has none, or very little.\r\nSyrup has a good deal more, but will run over the edge of a piece of\r\nbread and butter if you are not careful.\r\n\r\nGases have no cohesive properties at all and, therefore, fly all over\r\nthe place, through any opening they can find, either at the top of the\r\nroom or under the crack of the door. They are always trying to get to\r\nsome place else and will keep moving as long as not confined. Gases can\r\nmove in any direction.\r\n\r\nLiquids, however, while they are inclined to be constantly on the move,\r\ncan only go in one direction--down hill, and they go down fast or slow\r\nif there is a chance, in proportion to the amount of stick-together\r\nproperties they have. Liquids can never go up of their own accord,\r\nexcepting in the process of evaporation, and then only when changed\r\ninto gases. A lake of water will dry up completely by evaporation\r\nunless fed by streams of water constantly flowing in, because\r\nevaporation is constantly taking place wherever water is exposed to the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Water Boil?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we call boiling in the water we see when water is put over a hot\r\nfire long enough to make it boil, is the changing of the water from\r\nwhat we generally regard it--a liquid--into gases. Water consists of\r\ntwo gases--hydrogen and oxygen--in fact, two parts of hydrogen gas and\r\none part of oxygen gas when mixed will always make pure water. Now,\r\nthen, if liquid water is heated to a certain point or temperature it\r\nturns into the two gases, oxygen and hydrogen, and comes to the top of\r\nthe water, which still remains in liquid form, in the form of a bubble\r\nand explodes into the air--not a very loud explosion, but still an\r\nexplosion. The process of turning liquid water into gases is a gradual\r\none, and that is why the water does not all turn into one large bubble\r\nat once and explode away. If you keep the fire going long enough, all\r\nthe water in the vessel will explode away into the air, a few bubbles\r\nat a time. If you hold a cold plate over the vessel as the bubble\r\nexplodes you can catch some of these gases in the form of bubbles on\r\nthe under side of the plate, which are again liquid water. When the\r\nwater becomes hot enough it turns into bubbles and as bubbles rise\r\nthat is what makes the boiling you see. When the same gases then come\r\ntogether again in a certain proportion under proper temperature they\r\nturn into liquid water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt What Point of Heat Does Water Boil?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boiling point of water is the temperature at which it begins to\r\npass into the form of gases. This varies in different altitudes. At\r\nthe sea level the boiling point is at 212° Fahrenheit. On the top of\r\nmountains, for instance, water would boil at a much lower temperature.\r\nIt would be possible to go high enough in a balloon so that the water\r\nwould fly from the pan in the form of gas without making the water hot.\r\nAlso, a mile below the level of the sea it would take many more degrees\r\nof heat to make the water boil. It is said that high up in a balloon\r\nyou could not boil an egg hard in a pan of boiling water if you kept it\r\nin the boiling water for an hour or more, whereas we know that an egg\r\nwill be hard-boiled if we keep it in boiling water down where we live\r\nfor more than five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe degree of heat at which water passes away into the form of gases\r\nis regulated by the pressure of the air on the water and other things\r\nabout us. At the average level in the United States where people\r\nlive the pressure of the air on everything is fifteen pounds to the\r\nsquare inch, and at this pressure water boils only after it reaches a\r\ntemperature of 212° Fahrenheit. As we go up the mountains the pressure\r\nbecomes less and less as we go up. At the top of Mount Blanc, which is\r\n15,781 feet high, water boils at 185° Fahrenheit. If we took a balloon\r\nfrom the top of the mountain we would come to a height where there was\r\nno air pressure at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Do We Mean by Fahrenheit?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Fahrenheit is used to distinguish the kind of scale most\r\ncommonly used on thermometers in Great Britain and the United States.\r\nGabriel Daniel Fahrenheit, a native of Dantzic, made the first\r\nthermometer on which this scale was used, and it is named after him. In\r\nthis scale for thermometers the space between the freezing point and\r\nthe boiling point is divided into 180 degrees--the point for freezing\r\nbeing marked 32 degrees and the boiling point 212 degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can’t We Swim as Easily in Fresh Water as in Salt Water?\r\n\r\n\r\nOur bodies are heavier than fresh water, i. e., a bulk of fresh water\r\nequal to the size of our body would weigh less than our body, so that\r\nthe first tendency is to sink to the bottom if we find ourselves in\r\nfresh water. If man had not learned to swim that is what he would\r\nalways do, sink to the bottom; but having learned how to keep from\r\nsinking, he is able to swim in fresh water. However, we find that an\r\namount of salt water equal to the bulk of a man in size is heavier than\r\nan equal amount of fresh water, although such a bulk of ordinary salt\r\nsea water will still weigh less than the man. A man will sink in salt\r\nwater also if he has not learned to swim or float, but he can keep up\r\nwith less effort in salt water, and also swim in it more easily. In\r\na nutshell, then, the answer to this question is that salt water is\r\nheavier than fresh water. You can make salt water so full of salt that\r\nit becomes heavier than a man. Great Salt Lake in Utah is so salty that\r\none cannot sink in it for this reason. You could drown yourself in it,\r\nof course, by keeping your head under water, but whether in shallow\r\nwater or deep water you would not sink in Great Salt Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Say Some Water Is Hard and Other Water Soft?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we call hard water contains certain salts which soft water does\r\nnot contain. This salt in hard water is lime or some other salts which\r\nthe water has picked up out of the ground as it passed through either\r\ncoming up or going down. On the other hand, we can guess after having\r\nbeen told this much that if we can find any water that has not passed\r\nthrough the ground, and, therefore, not had a chance to pick up any\r\nsalts, we will have soft water. From that point it is easy to guess,\r\nthen, that rain water must be soft water, and so it is. The water in\r\nthe cisterns, which is rain water, is soft water, and the kind we get\r\nout of the wells is hard water.\r\n\r\nWe do not like to wash either our faces or our clothes in hard water,\r\nespecially when it is necessary to use soap, because when we use soap\r\nwith hard water the soap undergoes chemical change which prevents its\r\ndissolving in the water. Therefore, you cannot easily do a good job\r\nof washing in hard water. On the other hand it is easy to dissolve\r\nthe soap in pure rain water or soft water and that is the kind we,\r\ntherefore, prefer for washing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does Water Put a Fire Out?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is at first a puzzling question, because back in your mind is the\r\nthought that since hydrogen and oxygen are necessary to make a fire\r\nburn, it seems strange that water, which is composed of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, will also put it out.\r\n\r\nA burning fire throws off heat, but if too much of the heat is taken\r\nfrom the fire suddenly the temperature of the fire is sent down so far\r\nbelow the point at which the oxygen of the air will combine with it\r\nthat the fire cannot burn. We speak commonly as though water thrown on\r\na fire drowns it. That is practically what happens. Scientifically what\r\nhappens is that the water thrown upon the fire absorbs so much of the\r\nheat to itself that the temperature of the fire is reduced below the\r\npoint where oxygen will combine with the carbon in the burning material\r\nand the fire goes out.\r\n\r\nTo answer the unasked part of your question at the same time I will\r\nsay that hydrogen and oxygen when combined as water will put the fire\r\nout rather than make it burn, more because when these gases take the\r\nform of water they are already once burned, and you know that anything,\r\nsubstance or gas, which has already been burned cannot be burned again.\r\nIt required great heat to make oxygen and hydrogen combine and form\r\nwater, and it also takes great heat to separate them again. So they are\r\nreally burned once before they become water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does the Rain Go?\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually almost all of the rain that falls runs into the rivers\r\nand lakes and later finds its way into the ocean, where it is again\r\ntaken up into the air by the sun’s rays. But many other things happen\r\nto parts of the rain which do not find their way into the ocean. In\r\nthe paved street, of course, where the water cannot sink in, it flows\r\ninto the gutter and thence into the sewer and on down to the river or\r\nwherever it is that the sewers are emptied. You see, it depends very\r\nmuch on what the earth’s surface is covered with at the place where\r\nthe rain falls. When it strikes where there is vegetation a great deal\r\nof it stays in the soil at a depth of comparatively few feet. If it is\r\nsoil where trees and other plants grow a great deal of it is sucked up\r\nfrom the ground by this vegetation and given back into the air through\r\nthe leaves and flowers. Some of the rain keeps sinking on down into the\r\nearth until it strikes some substance like rock or clay, through which\r\nit cannot sink, and then it follows along this until it finds something\r\nit can get through and collects in a pool and forms an underground\r\nlake, and may cause a spring to flow. Then there are also worms and\r\nother forms of animal life in the earth which use up some of the water.\r\nBut it all gets back into the air eventually to come down some time\r\nagain in the form of rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Rain Make the Air Fresh?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main answer to this question must be that the rain in coming down\r\nthrough the air drives the dust and other impurities which are in the\r\nair before it, and so cleans the air and makes it absolutely clean.\r\nIn addition to this it is now stated that since very often rain is\r\nproduced by electrical changes in the air, and that these electrical\r\nchanges produce a gas called ozone, which has a delightfully fresh\r\nsmell, it is this ozone that makes us say the air has become fresh.\r\n\r\nThe air above our cities is almost constantly filled with smoke,\r\ncontaining various poisonous gases, and these are driven away by the\r\nfalling rain.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there is always a greater or less accumulation of dirt,\r\ngarbage and other things in the cities which give off offensive smells\r\nconstantly, but which we do not notice always because we become used to\r\nthem. When the rain comes down it washes the streets and destroys these\r\nsmells, and that makes the air fresh and delightful to take into the\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nIn the country the air is more nearly pure all the time, because the\r\nthings which spoil the air in the city are not present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs a Train Harder to Stop Than to Start?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer is yes. It is harder to stop a train than to start it, or\r\nrather it takes more power. The speed of a train depends upon the\r\nmotive power. When a train is stopped and you wish to start it, you\r\nmust apply enough motive power to start it going. There must be enough\r\npower to move the weight of the train and overcome the friction of the\r\nwheels on the track. It is, of course, easier to move a thing that\r\nweighs less than a heavier one. If you throw a ball ten feet into the\r\nair, it will perhaps not sting your hand when you catch it on its\r\nreturn; but, if you throw it one hundred feet into the air, it will\r\nsting your hands when you catch it. Besides, it will come down faster\r\nthe last ten feet of the way than the ball which you threw only ten\r\nfeet into the air. This is because when movement is applied to anything\r\nyou add power to it. The ball which comes down from one hundred feet\r\nin the air acquires more power in falling and it takes more power to\r\nstop it. A train in motion has not only the power of the weight of the\r\ntrain behind it, but also the additional weight which the movement of\r\nthe train has given it. Therefore, it takes more power to stop it than\r\nto start it. To stop a train you must apply the same amount of power as\r\nis in the moving train because the power to stop any moving thing must\r\nalways be at least as great as the power which is moving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Knots In Boards?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find knots in the boards which we notice in a lumber pile or in any\r\nother place where boards happen to be, because the smaller limbs which\r\ngrow away from the larger limbs of trees grow from the inside as well\r\nas the outside of the tree.\r\n\r\nWhen you see a knot in a board it means that before the tree was cut\r\ndown and the log sawed up into boards, a limb was growing out from the\r\ninside of the tree at the spot where the knot occurs.\r\n\r\nYou will also find that the wood in the knot is harder generally than\r\nthe rest of the board. This is because more strength is required at the\r\nbase of a limb and in the part of the limb which grew inside the tree\r\nthan in other parts, for the limb must be strong enough to support not\r\nonly the limb itself, but also the smaller limbs which grow out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many Stars Are There?\r\n\r\n\r\nMan may never know how many stars there are. The best we can do is\r\nto figure on the number that can be seen with the largest telescopes\r\nwhich have been invented, for, of course, you know there must be many\r\nmillions of them which to us are invisible. We have counted the stars\r\nso far as we can see them; or, rather, so far as we can photograph\r\nthem. Astronomers have found that a photographic plate exposed to the\r\nstars will show more of them than can be seen by the naked eye. This\r\nis because the materials on a photographic plate are more sensitive\r\nto the light of the stars than the human eye. By this method man has\r\nbeen able in a way to count the stars he can see. It adds up to more\r\nthan a hundred million of them. Astronomers found this out by taking\r\nphotographs of the heavens at night, devoting one picture to each\r\nsection, until the entire heavens had been covered, and then counting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE PAINT COMES FROM\r\n\r\nMAKING LEAD BUCKLES--THE FIRST STEP IN PAINT MAKING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Can of Paint\r\n\r\n\r\nPaint such as is most frequently used is the material used for painting\r\nbuildings, such as houses, barns, stores, and many others which we need\r\nnot mention here. This paint is used on these buildings mostly for two\r\nvery important reasons--one being to beautify the buildings, the other\r\nbeing to protect them from the ravages of the weather, much in the same\r\nway that your clothes protect you from the weather.\r\n\r\nPaint such as we mention here may be regarded as the most simple\r\nand useful form. You have no doubt frequently seen the painter-man\r\nspreading paint on some building, or perchance, you have seen your\r\nfather doing it, and have noticed that paint is a fluid substance\r\nlooking something like cream, which is applied to the surface to be\r\npainted with a suitable brush and is brushed out smoothly. After the\r\nfirst coat is dry, other coats are put on in the same way until enough\r\npaint has been put on to thoroughly hide the unevenness of the lumber\r\nand making it of a uniform color.\r\n\r\nThis paint is made by simply mixing together dry powder, which is\r\nusually called pigment, with a thin, yellowish liquid which is called\r\nlinseed oil. In the earlier days, the painter-man mixed this paint\r\nhimself whenever he desired to use it. In these more modern times, he\r\nusually buys this paint already prepared.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a little history of the preparation of the package of a can of\r\npaint which he buys may be interesting to you.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine that the can of paint is white. In this case, the\r\npigment which is used is a white powder and is made of either metallic\r\nlead or metallic zinc. The preparation of this fine white powder is\r\nvery interesting and requires considerable time to perfect.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the pigment known as white lead first. This is produced\r\nby causing metallic lead, which is of a bluish-gray color and very\r\nheavy, to change from its original form by a process which is known\r\nas “corrosion.” This corrosion is brought about by first taking the\r\nmetallic lead, which at this stage exists in large pieces known as\r\n“pigs.” These pigs of lead are melted in a furnace and then molded into\r\nsmall, thin shapes which are buckles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW WHITE LEAD IS MADE\r\n\r\nFILLING THE STACK WITH LEAD BUCKLES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAD BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE STACKS.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to take an earthenware vessel, which resembles an\r\nordinary stone crock, and first pour into it a small quantity of acetic\r\nacid, which is about the same as table vinegar. Then the crock or pot\r\nis filled up with the lead buckles.\r\n\r\nWhere this white lead is made in a large way many thousands of these\r\npots are placed in a building, the sides of which are walled up tight,\r\nthe spaces between the crocks being filled in with tan bark. After\r\nthe floor has been covered with a layer of these crocks, the layer is\r\ncovered with boards, in order to provide a foundation for setting in\r\nthe next layer of crocks and tan bark. The layer of boards also serves\r\nas a floor to keep the tan bark from falling into the open crocks on\r\nthe tier below. This procedure is followed with tier after tier until\r\nthe building is completely filled.\r\n\r\nCorrosion of the metallic lead in the pots now begins, because the tan\r\nbark generates some heat, becoming finally quite warm. This heat causes\r\nthe acetic acid or vinegar to throw off vapor or steam, which attacks\r\nthe metallic lead, causing it to decompose or corrode. This process\r\ngoes on for many weeks (sometimes as much as fifteen or sixteen weeks),\r\nuntil those buckles of metallic lead have become a mass of white powder\r\nand nearly all trace of the original metallic lead has disappeared.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LEAD BUCKLE AFTER CORROSION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LEAD BUCKLE BEFORE CORROSION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW OXIDE OF ZINC IS OBTAINED\r\n\r\nWASHING THE LEAD. SCREENS COVERED WITH CLOTH REMOVE ALL FOREIGN MATTER.\r\n\r\nAfter these many weeks have passed, the pots containing the white\r\npowder of carbonate of lead, as it is called, is taken out of the\r\nbuilding where corrosion took place, and the white deposit is put\r\nthrough an elaborate system of refining, which is called “washing,”\r\nand, in fact, is really washed in water, and is then dried in very\r\nlarge copper pans. After being dried it is in the form of large white\r\ncakes, resembling pieces of chalk. These cakes are then passed through\r\na mill, which grinds them to very fine powder, which is packed in\r\nbarrels ready to be shipped and used by the paint-maker.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FURNACE WHERE THE SULPHUR IS ROASTED OUT OF THE ORE.\r\n\r\nNow that we have followed through the process of making the white-lead\r\npowder, or pigment, let us take a little time to study the preparation\r\nof the other white powder, known to the paint trade as “oxide of zinc.”\r\nThis is prepared in a manner quite different from that of the white\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nFirst the ore which is mined from the earth containing the metallic\r\nzinc is carefully selected by expert workmen and placed in a special\r\nkind of furnace, being mixed with hard coal, such as we use in our\r\nheating stoves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ZINC SMELTER--THE MEN KEEP THEIR MOUTHS COVERED SO AS\r\nNOT TO INHALE THE VAPOR, WHICH IS POISONOUS\r\n\r\nThe burning of the coal causes an intensely high temperature, sometimes\r\nbeing several thousand degrees. This causes the zinc ore to be consumed\r\nas it were or to pass into a form of vapor. This vapor is carried\r\nthrough huge pipes which are several feet in diameter and extend for\r\na long distance. While these vapors are passing through these pipes\r\nit becomes cooled. After becoming cooled it takes on the form of very\r\nfine white powder, coming from the pipes in much the same way that\r\nsnow falls from the sky in the winter. This is collected and placed in\r\nbarrels, after which it is ready for the paint-maker without further\r\npreparation.]\r\n\r\n~WHERE LINSEED OIL COMES FROM~\r\n\r\nSince we have followed the preparation of the two important white\r\npigments used in making our can of paint, it is now important that\r\nwe devote a little thought to the liquid which is to be used. This\r\nis called “Linseed Oil.” Linseed oil is of a golden yellow color,\r\nresembling the appearance of thin syrup which we sometimes have on the\r\ntable. This oil is taken from the seed of the flax plant. It might\r\nbetter be called “Flaxseed Oil,” yet it is not commonly known by that\r\nname, but is nearly always referred to as “Linseed Oil.” Flax is grown\r\nin many parts of the world, the most important places being the United\r\nStates of America, Dominion of Canada, Ireland, India and the Argentine\r\nRepublic. In the United States, the seed is sown early in spring, much\r\nthe same as is done with other crops, and ripens and is harvested early\r\nin the fall of the year. The harvesting and separation of the seed from\r\nthe plant or straw is done very much in the same way that other crops,\r\nsuch as wheat and oats, are harvested. The seed is then taken to market\r\nand is ready for the extraction of the oil, which is done by men who\r\nare known as “oil crushers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESSING OIL OUT OF FLAXSEED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMOVING OIL CAKE FROM PRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe oil is extracted from the seed by a very simple process. Usually\r\nthe seeds are heated by steaming them, after which they pass through\r\na mill, being ground to a coarse mass, which is then placed in very\r\npowerful machines called “Hydraulic Oil Presses,” which squeeze the oil\r\nfrom the seed, leaving the remainder in the form of large cakes which\r\nare then ground to a mealy-like powder which is used as food for cattle\r\nand is very much prized.\r\n\r\nThe oil which has been extracted by this process is put into large\r\ntanks where it is clarified and is then ready for the paint-maker.\r\nThis oil is often referred to as “Vegetable Oil” and it has one very\r\npeculiar and very important characteristic which makes it useful and\r\nnecessary for use in paint. This property is that of drying or becoming\r\nsolid, losing all tendency to stickiness after it has been spread out\r\nthinly and exposed to the air for a short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE LEAD IS GROUND IN OIL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE PAINTS ARE MIXED.]\r\n\r\nNow that we have given attention to the preparation of the most\r\nimportant things used in the making of our can of paint, let us look a\r\nlittle to the manner in which they are put together, and the result.\r\n\r\nThe oil is necessary in making paint in order to make it fluid, so that\r\nthe paint may be brushed on to the wood or other surface, and also so\r\nthat the pigment or powdered material which has been put into the paint\r\nwill have something to hold it to the surface. The oil or other liquid\r\nwhich may be used is usually called “Binder” by the paint man because\r\nit binds the pigment in the paint and to the surface on which it has\r\nbeen spread or applied.\r\n\r\nIn a large paint factory, the two white pigments, lead and zinc, are\r\nmixed with linseed oil in large machines known as “Mixers” into a\r\nsmooth paste which is then run through other machines called “Mills,”\r\nwhere the paste is ground very fine into large tubes where the paint\r\nis finished by mixing in enough more oil to make it of the proper\r\nthickness or consistency for brushing. In this state it can be used,\r\nbut would not be entirely satisfactory because it would dry very\r\nslowly. For that reason, the paint-maker adds in a small amount of what\r\nis known as “Drier,” which causes the paint to dry much more rapidly\r\nafter it is spread out on any surface.\r\n\r\nThe paint-maker may also add in a small amount of thin liquid called\r\n“Turpentine,” which also aids in the drying and the working of the\r\npaint. Turpentine is a very thin liquid which looks like water, and it\r\nis derived from the sap of one species of pine which grows abundantly\r\nin the southern portion of the United States. The sap is taken from the\r\ntree by tapping the tree or making an incision called a box, at certain\r\nseasons. After the sap is collected it is put through a heating process\r\ncalled “distilling,” which separates the water-white liquid, called\r\nturpentine, leaving a large mass of heavy material which is commonly\r\nknown as “Rosin.” This turpentine is very useful to the paint-maker and\r\nthe painter. It is also used for many other purposes.\r\n\r\n~WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENT COLORS OF PAINT~\r\n\r\nThe paint which we have described is the most simple kind and is white.\r\nThere are many other kinds of paint used, being of many different\r\ncolors. All of these different kinds require different treatment and\r\npreparation and would require many large books to explain even in a\r\nbrief way.\r\n\r\nThe white paint which we have described may be colored or tinted to\r\nmany different hues by adding suitable color pigments. These color\r\npigments are of many kinds and are derived from many different\r\nsources. The vegetable kingdom is represented as well as the mineral\r\nand animal kingdoms. The linseed oil which we have already mentioned,\r\nis derived from the vegetable kingdom. This also applies to some few\r\nof the pigments. A very important instance which we might mention\r\nis a beautiful rich brown called “Vandyke Brown.” This is made from\r\ndecayed vegetation which is found in swampy districts. There are many\r\npigments derived from the mineral kingdom. White lead and zinc oxide\r\nhave already been described as useful. Among colored pigments coming\r\nfrom this kingdom, we might mention yellow ochre, sienna, umber, cobalt\r\nblue, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe animal kingdom supplies quite a number, one of which is a beautiful\r\nred known as “Carmine.” This is taken from a small insect or fly which\r\nis found in certain tropical climates. The production of carmine is\r\nvery expensive and the product is highly prized.\r\n\r\nAnother important development of the animal world is what is called\r\n“Bone Black.” This is made by taking ordinary animal bones, putting\r\nthem into a suitable furnace and burning them, which really produces\r\nbone charcoal, which is refined by powdering and washing, and finally\r\nproduces a beautiful black, such as used for painting fine coaches and\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Dog Turn Round and Round Before He Lies Down?\r\n\r\n\r\nAway back in the history of the animal kingdom, when the ancestors of\r\nour domestic dog were wild, they slept in the woods or open. When they\r\nwere ready to lie down, they first had to trample the grass about them\r\nflat to make a place to lie down. This became a habit and one of the\r\ninstincts of the animal which has been transmitted to the dogs of today\r\nwho keep it up. It is an inherited habit quite useless to the dogs of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Is Light Produced?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou already learned that a substance called ether is found in all\r\nsubstances, filling the spaces between the molecules. When the\r\nmolecules are made to vibrate, the ether naturally also vibrates. As\r\nsoon as the vibrations become sufficiently rapid, they produce the\r\nsensation of light. These vibrations also produce heat. In heated\r\nbodies the molecules are always found to be in vibration, and a body\r\nmay become so hot that it gives off light. We notice this when iron\r\nbecomes red hot. Heat and light are found together in bodies in many\r\ninstances. In fact, most of the light we have comes from bodies which\r\nare hot. The sun is so hot, that it is surrounded by the gases of many\r\nsubstances that exist as solids on earth.\r\n\r\nWe have some bodies which produce light which is not accompanied by\r\nmuch heat. The glow-worm, or firefly, seems to make light with little\r\nor no heat; but we do not yet know how this is done. Almost all\r\nsources of artificial light require that heat be produced before light\r\nobtained. Only such vibrations of the ether which are sufficiently\r\nrapid produce enough light to enable us to see. For this reason,\r\na piece of red hot iron, which is made luminous by heat and whose\r\nparticles vibrate less rapidly produce little light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Rays of Light?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever the ether is made to vibrate rapidly enough at any point,\r\nthe vibrations go in straight lines from the source of light in all\r\ndirections. A single line of vibrating particles in the ether, is known\r\nas a ray. A number of rays, that issue from one point, are said to form\r\na pencil. A pencil of light may be produced by holding near a candle a\r\nscreen, with a hole in it. Sometimes rays of light are brought together\r\nin a point, as may be done by means of a burning glass, and one of\r\nthese bundles of rays is known as a convergent pencil.\r\n\r\nA bundle of rays that lie parallel to each other forms a beam. The rays\r\nthat come to us from the sun are practically parallel and are called\r\nsunbeams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Nail Get Hot When I Hammer It?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we are in the sunshine, or standing before a fire, we feel hot;\r\nwhen we take snow or ice in our hands, they feel cold. The thing which\r\nproduces these sensations is called heat. When we feel heat, it is\r\nbecause heat is absorbed by our bodies, and when we feel cold, it is\r\nbeing thrown off by them.\r\n\r\nTo answer this question, we must see how heat may be produced. If we\r\ndraw a cord rapidly through our fingers, they feel hot, and if we rub\r\na coin briskly with a cloth or our hands, it becomes warm; if we take\r\na nail and hammer it on a hard substance, it becomes too warm for us\r\nto hold. In these instances heat is produced by retarding or checking\r\nthe motion of a body. When we draw a cord through our fingers, it moves\r\nless easily; we retard its motion by gripping it and this is what makes\r\nthe heat we feel. When we strike the nail with a hammer, the motion of\r\nthe hammer is checked by the nail, and the faster we pound with the\r\nhammer, the hotter the nail becomes. From these experiments we learn\r\nthat whenever the motion of a substance is checked, or retarded, heat\r\nis generated, and the substance made hot.\r\n\r\nIn explaining this method of producing heat, it was at one time thought\r\nthat all bodies contained a substance which produced the heat and that,\r\nwhen rubbed or hammered, this substance was thrown off. About the\r\nend of the 18th century, however, it was shown by Benjamin Thompson\r\n(Count Rumford), that substances when rubbed give off heat. From this\r\nwe learned that heat is not a substance, because the quantity of\r\nany substance, present in a body, cannot be limitless. If it were a\r\nsubstance which produced the heat, the supply would sooner or later be\r\nexhausted, and rubbing could no longer produce heat.\r\n\r\nHeat produced by rubbing, or by striking substances together, is\r\ncaused as follows: If two substances are struck upon each other,\r\nthe whole of those substances are checked, but the molecules of the\r\nsubstances are made to vibrate very rapidly, and these vibrations\r\nproduce the heat we feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do We Obtain Heat?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe get most of our heat from the sun. If the heat from the sun did\r\nnot reach us, no living thing would exist on the earth. No plants or\r\nanimals could live; the oceans and rivers would be solid ice.\r\n\r\nAnother important source of heat, is chemical action. Chemical action\r\nis what causes fire. Even when it does not cause fire, it produces a\r\ngreat deal of heat. When we breathe to keep our bodies warm, it is\r\na chemical action that occurs. Fire is the most important form of\r\nchemical action, as a source of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Glow-Worm Glow?\r\n\r\n\r\nA glow-worm is a kind of beetle which may be found in the yards and\r\nhedges in the summer time. The name applies only to the female of\r\nthe species which is wingless and whose body resembles that of a\r\ncaterpillar somewhat and emits a shining green light from the end of\r\nthe abdomen. The male of this species has wings but does not show any\r\nlight as does the female and resembles an ordinary beetle. The male\r\nflies about in the evenings looking for the female and she makes her\r\nlight glow in order that the male may find her. Glow-worms are found\r\nmostly in England. There are, however, some members of the same species\r\nof beetle common to the United States. We speak of them as fireflies\r\nor lightning bugs. The female of these also is the only one carrying a\r\nlight, although unlike the glow-worm she has wings and can fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do They Call It Pin Money?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis expression originally came from the allowance which a husband gave\r\nhis wife to purchase pins. At one time pins were dreadfully expensive\r\nso that only wealthy people could afford them and they were saved\r\nso carefully that in those days you could not have looked along the\r\npavement and found a pin which you happened to be in need of as you can\r\nand often do today.\r\n\r\nBy a curious law the manufacturers of pins were only allowed to sell\r\nthem on January 1st and 2nd each year and so when those days came\r\naround the women whose husbands could afford it, secured pin money from\r\nthem and went out and got their pins.\r\n\r\nPins have become so very cheap in these days that we are rather\r\ncareless with them, but the expression has continued to live although\r\ntoday when used, it means any allowance of money which a husband gives\r\na wife for her personal expenses.\r\n\r\nPins were known and used as long ago as 1347 A. D. They were introduced\r\ninto England in 1540. In 1824 an American named Might invented a\r\nmachine for making pins which enabled them to be manufactured cheaply.\r\nAbout 1,500 tons of iron and brass are made into pins every year in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do People Shake Hands With the Right Hand?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days of very long ago when all men were prepared to fight at any\r\nand all times because one could not know whether another approaching\r\nwas a friend or an enemy, all men went armed. This was before the day\r\nof guns when the sword was the great weapon of defense.\r\n\r\nUpon occasion when one man approached another, each had to decide\r\nwhether the other came on a peaceful mission or not.\r\n\r\nPeople in those days were mostly right handed as they are now and when\r\nfighting carried their swords in their right hands.\r\n\r\nIf, then, a man wished to speak with a stranger or, as might easily\r\nbe necessary, to one who may even be known to be unfriendly, he put\r\nout his right hand upon approaching to show that he had no deadly or\r\ndangerous weapon in it. The other man could see this and knew from the\r\nextended open hand that no harm was intended and that the approach was\r\npeaceful. If, then, he was willing to meet the other, he also extended\r\nhis right arm with the hand open to show him who was approaching that\r\nhis fighting hand was empty also; and when they met each would grasp\r\nthe hand of the other so that neither one could change his mind and\r\nassume a fighting attitude without the other having an equal warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did the Custom of Clinking Glasses When Drinking Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Roman gladiators, before a duel with swords, it\r\nbecame the custom of each of the participants to drink a glass of wine\r\nbefore fighting. Just before the fighting commenced two glasses of wine\r\nwere brought and the gladiators drank. These two glasses of wine were\r\nprovided by the friends of either one or the other of the gladiators.\r\nTo guard against treachery, through some over zealous friend of the\r\nfighters furnishing poisoned wine was necessary. So before drinking and\r\nto show there was no treachery, the gladiators came close together and\r\npoured wine from one glass into the other back and forth until the wine\r\nin the glasses was thoroughly mixed. If the wine in one glass then had\r\nbeen poisoned, the poisoned wine would thus be in both glasses, and if\r\nthere had been any treachery, both gladiators would be poisoned if they\r\ndrank. The wine was poured from one glass to the other to show that\r\nthere was no treachery.\r\n\r\nThis custom continued in use for a long time until the idea of\r\ndrinking before a fight was abandoned. The custom, however, of showing\r\nfriendliness in this way while drinking continued for a long time.\r\nLater it became a mere custom, however, to show a friendly spirit\r\ntoward the one who was drinking with you, and when the danger of\r\npoisoned wine was past, the actual act of pouring the wine from one\r\nglass to another was changed to merely touching the glasses together.\r\nThus today we have the friendly custom of touching glasses together\r\nlong after the necessity of guarding against treachery while drinking\r\nhas passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Cannot Fishes Live In the Air?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing isn’t it that if a boy falls into the water, he\r\nwill drown if he cannot swim or someone does not help him out, and that\r\nif a fish falls out of the water onto the land, he will drown also,\r\neven though he knows how to swim, better than anything else he does. A\r\nboy cannot secure the air which he needs to live on if he is under the\r\nwater, because there is not enough air for him there and a fish cannot\r\nsecure enough air for him to live on when he is on land where the air\r\nis plentiful, because, the boy takes his air from the air itself and\r\nthe fish gets his air out of the water.\r\n\r\nTo live by breathing the air we find on or above the land, it is\r\nnecessary to have lungs and fishes do not have lungs. In the case of\r\nthe boy under the water he would have to have gills to enable him to\r\nmake use of the air which is in the water to live by and he has no\r\ngills.\r\n\r\nA fish can only live a little while out of the water, but even so he\r\ncan live longer out of the water than a boy can under the water.\r\n\r\nLest you read sometime of the flying fish and think they must be able\r\nto live out of the water, I will tell you before you ask the question\r\nthat the flying fish never stays out of the water for more than a few\r\nseconds at a time. His flying leaps amount to little more than long\r\nleaps from wave to wave. He swims along very fast in the water, coming\r\nright up to the surface and out into the air and the speed at which he\r\nhas been swimming regulates the distance he will go when he shoots into\r\nthe air, as he has no means of propelling himself through the air, but\r\nonly into it. He has, however, wing-like fins, which he spreads out\r\nwhen in the air and which enables him to glide through the air and thus\r\nremain in the air longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes a Fish Move in Swimming?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a puzzling question, I am sure. Of course, you at once cause\r\nseveral other questions as soon as you ask this one such as the\r\nfollowing: Does the water in front of him move out of the way and then\r\nclose in behind him? If so, where does it go in the meantime? Does the\r\nfish move the water forward or up or down or what does he do?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, of course, in the movements of the fish’s tail. The fish\r\nin swimming is surrounded with water, top, bottom and all sides of him.\r\nThe pressure of the water on the fish is the same at all points so that\r\nany motion made by him would have a tendency to make him move. As a\r\nmatter of fact the tail in moving from side to side creates a current\r\nin the water from the head to the tail, or rather would produce an\r\nactual current if the fish remained perfectly still. Instead of making\r\nan actual current of water, the body of the fish is moved forward.\r\n\r\nAs to whether the water ahead of him opens up first and then the water\r\nbehind him is a more difficult question to answer. To the appearance it\r\nwould seem as if the water moved at both ends and sides at once, but\r\naccording to scientific theory, the water at the head of the fish is\r\ndisplaced first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Birds’ Eggs of Different Colors?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a wise provision of nature to help the mother birds hide her\r\neggs away from the eyes of her enemies. In the animal kingdom every\r\nkind of life is the natural prey of some other kind of animal. A bird\r\nwill have enemies which try to catch her as food. A bird cannot fight\r\nback, so must fly away when danger threatens, in order to save her\r\nlife. This means that she must leave the eggs in the nest for the\r\ntime being. At certain times she must also leave her nest and search\r\nfor food for herself. In order that the eggs so left alone may have a\r\nbetter chance of not being discovered, nature has arranged matters so\r\nthat the eggs take the color very much of the surroundings in which\r\nthey are laid. Eggs of some birds are spotted or look like pebbles,\r\nbecause the mother bird lays them in the sand. Some of them are green,\r\nalmost the color of the materials from which the bird builds the nest,\r\nand so the colors have a real, and to the birds, a valuable purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Hen Cackle After Laying an Egg?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hen cackles because she is glad. She is glad because she has just\r\naccomplished something, which she was put on earth to do. If you study\r\nthe life on the earth carefully with this in mind, you will discover\r\nthat all kinds of life give expression in some form of gladness, when\r\nthey have performed the things they are on earth for. It’s the hen’s\r\nway of expressing herself and letting the chicken world know. The dog\r\nwags his tail when he is pleased; boys and girls jump up and down when\r\nthey are pleased, whether they have been doing anything commendable or\r\nnot. No doubt also the actual laying of the egg causes some discomfort\r\nto the hen and the corresponding feeling of gladness would come\r\nnaturally after the discomfort disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Will Water Run Off a Duck’s Back?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason that water runs of a duck’s back, is that the feathers of\r\nducks are oily and, as water and oil will not mix, the water runs off\r\ninstead of soaking in. The feathers on a duck are so thick on the body\r\nof the duck, top and bottom, that even if it were not for the oil which\r\nis on the feathers the water would have some difficulty in soaking\r\nthrough the feathers. But the main reason why the feathers on a duck’s\r\nback cause water striking them to run off is that the duck has an oil\r\ngland which is constantly producing grease or oil and which the duck\r\nuses in giving his feathers a thin coating of oil to make them slick\r\nwith oil and when any water strikes the duck it runs off. Other birds\r\nwhich live in the water a great deal have this oil gland for the same\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY IN A STEEL RAIL\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Blast Furnace.\r\n\r\nMolten iron is brought from the blast furnaces to the open-hearth\r\nfurnaces, and dumped into a receptacle called a mixer, the capacity of\r\nwhich ranges from 400 tons to 1000 tons, depending upon the number of\r\nfurnaces to be served.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One-thousand-ton Mixer.]\r\n\r\n  Pictures in this story by courtesy of Bethlehem Steel Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSIDE OF OPEN HEARTH FURNACE\r\n\r\nCharging Side of an Open-hearth Furnace.\r\n\r\nAn open-hearth furnace consists of a long, shallow hearth, suitably\r\nenclosed in fire-brick, and bound together with steel binding. The\r\nfurnace is heated by burning gas and air, which have previously been\r\npreheated, so that a temperature is obtained in the furnace ranging\r\nfrom 2900 to 3050 degrees Fahrenheit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pouring Side of an Open-Hearth Furnace.\r\n\r\nThe open-hearth process consists of the purification of iron by\r\noxidizing out the impurities and burning out the carbon of the iron\r\nuntil a tough and ductile steel is produced, which can be made of any\r\ndesired composition by the addition of the necessary quantities of\r\nalloys just previous to tapping and pouring. The impurities in the iron\r\nare oxidized by the slag lying on top of the metal, and the burning\r\nout of the carbon, which is a very slow operation, is hastened by the\r\naddition of iron ore, the oxygen of which combines with the carbon of\r\nthe iron and passes off is a gas going up the stack.\r\n\r\nWhen an open-hearth furnace is ready for a charge, a variable amount\r\nof scrap, say 30 per cent of the total weight of material used for\r\nthe heat, is charged into the furnace. With this scrap is charged\r\nsufficient lime or limestone to make the slag, as well as some iron ore\r\nto assist in reducing the carbon of the iron. In about two or three\r\nhours the required amount of molten iron is brought from the mixer in\r\nladles, and poured into the furnace on top of the scrap, lime and ore.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOLTEN STEEL BEING POURED LIKE WATER\r\n\r\nMolten Steel Being Poured Into Ladle.\r\n\r\nWhen the scrap has all been melted, a test is taken to determine the\r\namount of carbon remaining in the bath. Iron ore is added from time\r\nto time until the carbon in the bath has been reduced to the desired\r\npoint, and the metal is sufficiently hot to pour. At this point\r\n“recarburizers” (consisting of Ferro-Manganese, Ferro-Silicon, and\r\npig-iron, or coal) are added to get the required composition. The tap\r\nhole at the back of the furnace is opened, and the steel is allowed to\r\nrun out into a ladle, the slag coming last and forming a blanket over\r\nthe steel in the ladle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crane Carrying Ingot and Soaking Pit Furnaces.\r\n\r\nThe ladle is picked up by an electric crane and carried over cast-iron\r\nmoulds, which are set on cars, the steel being poured into the moulds,\r\nresulting in steel ingots. A sufficient amount of time is allowed for\r\nthe steel to become chilled or set, when the cars are pushed under an\r\nelectric stripper, where the moulds are removed from the ingots. After\r\nthe ingots leave the stripper they are taken to the scales and weighed,\r\nand after weighing are put into the soaking pits. The pits get their\r\nname from the part they play in the heating of the steel for rolling.\r\nWhen the steel ingot is stripped the outside of the ingot is cool\r\nenough to hold the inside, which is still in a liquid state, and the\r\nsteel is put into the soaking pits to allow the inside to settle into a\r\nsolid mass, after which the ingot is reheated for rolling. The length\r\nof time in the soaking pits depends upon the size of the ingot, as the\r\nlarger the ingot, the greater length of time is required to set.\r\n\r\nWhen the steel is ready for rolling it is taken from the pits by\r\noverhead electric cranes, and placed into a dump buggy at the end of a\r\nroller line, which leads to the blooming mill. The dump buggy derives\r\nits name from the fact that when the ingot is placed into same in\r\nan upright position, the buggy, in order to place the ingot into a\r\nhorizontal position on the roller line, dumps over, in the same way as\r\nif one were to rock too far forward in a rocking-chair, the dump buggy\r\noperating on the same principle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GETTING READY TO MAKE A RAIL\r\n\r\nBlooming Mill and Engine.\r\n\r\nThe ingot travels down the movable-roller line to the blooming-mill\r\nrolls, which roll it down from a piece 19 inches by 23 inches to what\r\nis known as an 8 inch by 8 inch bloom, which is the size usually used\r\nin the manufacture of rails. The blooming mill derives its name from\r\nthe fact that after an ingot is rolled in same it is no longer called\r\nan ingot, but a bloom.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the blooming mill the bloom travels along another roller\r\nline to the shears, where it is cut into two or three pieces, the\r\nnumber of pieces depending on the size of the rail which is to be\r\nrolled. The blooms are then lifted over the roller line at the shears\r\nby a transfer crane, and placed on a traveling roller line which\r\nconnects with the rear of the reheating furnace. This furnace is about\r\n35 feet long, and is so constructed that when the bloom is pushed in\r\nat the rear of the furnace, another bloom drops from the front or\r\ndischarge end of the furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INGOT BECOMES A RAIL\r\n\r\nThe Ingot Becomes a Rail.\r\n\r\nThe bloom dropping out, being sufficiently hot to roll into rails,\r\ntravels along another roller line to the roughing or first set of\r\nrolls. Here the bloom is given five passes in the rolls, and is then\r\ntransferred to the strand or second set of rolls, where it receives\r\nfive additional passes; after this operation it is transferred to\r\nthe finishing or third set of rolls, in which it is given one pass.\r\nThe bloom has now been converted into a rail, and the rail travels\r\non another roller line to the hot saw, where it is cut into 33-foot\r\nlengths, this being the standard length in this country for all rails.\r\nThe rails when hot are cut by the hot saw to lengths of about 33 feet\r\n6¹⁄₂ inches, the allowance of inches being made for shrinkage in\r\ncooling. It is difficult to believe that steel shrinks to this extent,\r\nbut this is a fact, and while the rails are cooling on the hotbeds\r\nthey have the appearance of being animated, as they move first one way\r\nand then the other. After the rails are on the hotbed a sufficient\r\nlength of time to cool, they are taken from the hotbed and placed\r\non a traveling roller line, which takes them to an endless chain\r\nconveyor. The statement that rails are put on hotbeds for cooling seems\r\nparadoxical, but the hotbeds are so called because the rails are placed\r\non them while hot, and are left there until they have cooled.\r\n\r\nThe endless-chain conveyor places the rails on another bed, from\r\nwhich they are picked up by an electric crane and distributed to the\r\nstraightening presses, where all burrs (which have been caused by the\r\nhot-sawing operation) are removed before the rails are straightened.\r\nAfter straightening they are transferred to drill presses, where they\r\nhave holes drilled into them for the accommodation of the splice bar,\r\nafter which they are placed on the loading docks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After being carefully examined by the railroad\r\ncompany’s inspectors they are picked up from the loading docks by\r\nelectric magnets attached to a crane, and are placed in cars ready for\r\nshipment.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Made the First Felt Hat?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe felt hat is as old as Homer. The Greeks made them in skull-caps,\r\nconical, truncated, narrow- or broad-brimmed. The Phrygian bonnet was\r\nan elevated cap without a brim, the apex turned over in front. It is\r\nknown as the “cap of liberty.” An ancient figure of Liberty in the\r\ntimes of Antonius Livius, A.D. 115, holds the cap in the right hand.\r\nThe Persians wore soft caps; plumed hats were the headdress of the\r\nSyrian corps of Xerxes; the broad-brim was worn by the Macedonian\r\nkings. Castor means a beaver. The Armenian captive wore a plug hat.\r\nThe merchants of the fourteenth century wore a Flanders beaver.\r\nCharles VII, in 1469, wore a felt hat lined with red, and plumed.\r\nThe English men and women in 1510 wore close woolen or knitted caps;\r\ntwo centuries ago hats were worn in the house. Pepys, in his diary,\r\nwrote: “September, 1664, got a severe cold because I took off my hat at\r\ndinner”; and again, in January, 1665, he got another cold by sitting\r\ntoo long with his head bare, to allow his wife’s maid to comb his hair\r\nand wash his ears; and Lord Clarendon, in his essay, speaking of the\r\ndecay of respect due the aged, says “that in his younger days he never\r\nkept his hat on before those older than himself, except at dinner.”\r\nIn the thirteenth century Pope Innocent IV allowed the cardinals the\r\nuse of the scarlet cloth hat. The hats now in use are the cloth hat,\r\nleather hat, paper hat, silk hat, opera hat, spring-brim hat, and straw\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Hottest Spot on Earth?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hottest regions on earth is said to be along the Persian Gulf,\r\nwhere little or no rain falls. At Bahrein the arid shore has no fresh\r\nwater, yet a comparatively numerous population contrive to live there,\r\nthanks to the copious springs which break forth from the bottom of the\r\nsea. The fresh water is got by diving. The diver, sitting in his boat,\r\nwinds a great goat-skin bag around his left arm, the hand grasping\r\nits mouth; then he takes in his right hand a heavy stone, to which is\r\nattached a strong line, and thus equipped he plunges in, and quickly\r\nreaches the bottom. Instantly opening the bag over the strong jet of\r\nfresh water, he springs up the ascending current, at the same time\r\nclosing the bag, and is helped aboard. The stone is then hauled up, and\r\nthe diver, after taking breath, plunges in again. The source of the\r\ncopious submarine springs is thought to be in the green hills of Osman,\r\nsome 500 or 600 miles distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Do We Get Ivory?\r\n\r\n\r\nIvory is a hard substance, not unlike bone, of which the teeth of\r\nmost mammals chiefly consist, the dentine or tooth-substance which in\r\ntransverse sections shows lines of different color running in circular\r\narcs. It is used extensively for industrial purposes and is derived\r\nfrom the elephant, walrus, hippopotamus, narwhal, and some other\r\nanimals. The ivory of the tusks of the African elephant is held in the\r\nhighest estimation by manufacturers; the tusks vary in size, ranging\r\nfrom a few ounces in weight to 170 pounds. Holtzapffel states that\r\nhe saw fossil tusks on the banks of rivers of Northern Siberia which\r\nweighed 186 pounds each. Ivory is simply tooth-substance of exceptional\r\nhardness, toughness, and elasticity, due to the firmness and regularity\r\nof the dentinal tubules which radiate from the axial pulp-cavity to the\r\nperiphery of the tooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did Trial by Jury Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\n~WHY JURIES HAVE TWELVE MEN~\r\n\r\nA jury consists of a certain number of men selected according to law\r\nand sworn to inquire into and determine facts concerning a cause or\r\nan accusation submitted to them, and to declare the truth according\r\nto the evidence. The custom of trying accused persons before a jury,\r\nas practised in this country and England, is the natural outgrowth of\r\nrudimentary forms of trial in vogue among our Anglo-Saxon ancestors.\r\nThe present system of trial by jury is the result of a gradual growth\r\nunder the English Common Law. There is no special reason why twelve is\r\nthe usual number chosen for a complete jury except the necessity for\r\nlimiting the number. In a grand jury the number according to law must\r\nnot be less than twelve nor more than twenty-three, and twelve votes\r\nare necessary to find an indictment. The ancient Romans also had a form\r\nof trial before a presiding judge and a body of judices. The right of\r\ntrial by jury is guaranteed by the United States Constitution in all\r\ncriminal cases, and in civil cases where the amount in dispute exceeds\r\n$20. A petit or trial jury consists of twelve men, selected by lot\r\nfrom among the citizens residing within the jurisdiction of the court.\r\nTheir duty is to determine questions of fact in accordance with the\r\nweight of testimony presented and report their finding to the presiding\r\njudge. An impartial jury is assured by drawing by lot and then giving\r\nthe accused, in a criminal case, the right to dismiss a certain number\r\nwithout reason and certain others for good cause. Each of the jurymen\r\nmust meet certain legal requirements as to capacity in general and\r\nfitness for the particular case upon which he is to sit, and must take\r\nan oath to decide without prejudice and according to the testimony.\r\nA coroner’s jury or jury of inquest is usually composed of from six\r\nto fifteen persons, summoned to inquire into the cause of sudden or\r\nunexplained deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Animals Foretell the Weather?\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain movements on the part of the animal creation before a change of\r\nweather appear to indicate a reasoning faculty. Such seems to be the\r\ncase with the common garden spider, which, on the approach of rainy or\r\nwindy weather, will be found to shorten and strengthen the guys of his\r\nweb, lengthening the same when the storm is over. There is a popular\r\nsuperstition that it is unlucky for an angler to meet a single magpie,\r\nbut two of the birds together are a good omen. The reason is that the\r\nbirds foretell the coming of cold or stormy weather, and at such times,\r\ninstead of searching for food for their young in pairs, one will always\r\nremain on the nest. Sea-gulls predict storms by assembling on the land,\r\nas they know that the rain will bring earthworms and larvæ to the\r\nsurface. This, however, is merely a search for food, and is due to the\r\nsame instinct which teaches the swallow to fly high in fine weather,\r\nand skim along the ground when foul is coming. They simply follow\r\nthe flies and gnats, which remain in the warm strata of the air. The\r\ndifferent tribes of wading birds always migrate before rain, likewise\r\nto hunt for food. Many birds foretell rain by warning cries and uneasy\r\nactions, and swine will carry hay and straw to hiding-places, oxen will\r\nlick themselves the wrong way of the hair, sheep will bleat and skip\r\nabout, hogs turned out in the woods will come grunting and squealing,\r\ncolts will rub their backs against the ground, crows will gather in\r\ncrowds, crickets will sing more loudly, flies come into the house,\r\nfrogs croak and change color to a dingier hue, dogs eat grass, and\r\nrooks soar like hawks. It is probable that many of these actions are\r\ndue to actual uneasiness, similar to that which all who are troubled\r\nwith corns or rheumatism experience before a storm, and are caused\r\nboth by the variation in barometric pressure and the changes in the\r\nelectrical condition of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNearest Approach Ever Made to Perpetual Motion in Mechanics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn inventor has patented a double electric battery which seems to\r\ncome exceedingly near to perpetual motion. Instead of using the zinc\r\nbattery, he professes to have hit upon a solution which makes a battery\r\nseven times as powerful as the zinc battery, with absolutely no waste\r\nof material. The power of the battery grows gradually less in a few\r\nhours of use, but returns to its original unit when allowed to rest a\r\nfew hours. He has two batteries so arranged that the power is shifted\r\nfrom one to the other every three hours. A little machine has been\r\nrunning for some years in the patent office at New York. Certain parts\r\nof the mechanism are constructed of different expansive capacities, and\r\nthe machine is worked by the expansion and contraction of these under\r\nthe usual variations of temperature. In the Bodleian Library at Oxford\r\nthere is an apparatus which has chimed two little bells continuously\r\nfor forty years, by the energy of an apparently inexhaustible\r\n“dry-pile” of very low electrical energy. A church clock in Brussels is\r\nwound up by atmospheric expansion induced by the heat of the sun. As\r\nlong as the sun shines this clock will go till its works wear out. Mr.\r\nD. L. Goff, a wealthy American, has in his hall an old-fashioned clock,\r\nwhich, so long as the house is occupied, never runs down. Whenever the\r\nfront door is opened or closed, the winding arrangements of the clock,\r\nwhich are connected with the door by a rod with gearing attachments,\r\nare given a turn, so that the persons leaving and entering the house\r\nkeep the clock constantly wound up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Plants Breathe?\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants, like animals, breathe the air; plants breathe through their\r\nleaves and stems just as animals do by means of their respiratory\r\norgans. When a young plant is analyzed it is found to consist chiefly\r\nof water, which is all removed from the soil; there is about 75 per\r\ncent or more of this fluid present, and the rest is solid material.\r\nOf this latter by far the most abundant constituent is carbon, almost\r\nevery atom of which is removed from the atmosphere by the vital\r\naction of minute bodies contained in the green leaves. The carbon is\r\ntaken into the plant as carbonic acid gas. Plants also absorb oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, and nitrogen from the atmosphere in different quantities\r\nthrough their leaves, and also by means of their roots. These new\r\nproducts stored are in turn used in building up the different organs\r\nof the plant. Plants give off used-up moisture through their leaves,\r\njust as animals perspire through the pores of their skins. Calculations\r\nhave been made as to the amount of water thus perspired by plants. The\r\nsunflower, only 3¹⁄₂ ft. high, with 5,616 square inches of surface\r\nexposed to the air, gives off as much moisture as a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Depth of Snow Is Equivalent to an Inch of Rain?\r\n\r\n\r\nNewly fallen snow having a depth of about 11¹⁄₃ inches is equivalent to\r\none inch of rain. A cubic foot of newly fallen snow weighs 5¹⁄₂ pounds\r\nand a cubic foot of fresh or rain water weighs 62¹⁄₂ pounds or 1,000\r\nounces. An inch of rain means a gallon of water spread over every two\r\nsquare feet, or about a hundred tons to every acre. The density of\r\nsnow naturally varies a good deal according to the speed with which\r\nit falls. Temperature, also, has much to do with its bulk. In cold,\r\ncrisp weather, when the thermometer registers several degrees of frost,\r\nsnow comes down light and dry; but in moist, cold weather, when the\r\ntemperature is only just below thirty-two degrees, the snow falls in\r\nlarge, partially thawed flakes, and occupies much less space where it\r\nfalls than that which reaches the earth during the prevalence of a\r\ngreater degree of cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are the Stars Counted?\r\n\r\n\r\nStars are counted by means of the telescope and photography. The\r\nAstronomer-Royal for Ireland, Sir Robert S. Ball, in one of his\r\nlectures mentioned a photograph which had been obtained by Mr. Isaac\r\nRoberts representing a small part of the constellation of the Swan.\r\nThe picture is about as large as the page of a copy-book, and it\r\nis so crowded with stars that it would puzzle most people to count\r\nthem; but they have been counted by a patient person, and the number\r\nis about 16,000. Many of these stars are too faint ever to be seen\r\nin the greatest of telescopes yet erected. Attempts are now being\r\nmade to obtain a number of similar photographs which shall cover\r\nthe whole extent of the heavens. The task is indeed an immense one.\r\nAssuming the plates used to be the same size as that above mentioned,\r\nit would require at least 10,000 of them to represent the entire\r\nsky. The counting of stars by the telescope was first reduced to a\r\nsystem by the Herschels, who introduced “star-gauges,” which were\r\nsimply a calculation by averages. A telescope of 18 in. aperture, 20\r\nft. focus, and a magnifying power of 180, giving a field of view 15\r\nin. in diameter, was used for the purpose. The process consisted in\r\ndirecting this instrument to a part of the sky and counting the stars\r\nin the field. This, repeated hundreds of times, gave a fair idea of the\r\naverage number of stars in a circle of 15 in. diameter in all parts of\r\nthe sky. From this as a basis it is possible to reckon the number of\r\nstars in any known area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Is the Volume of Sound Measured?\r\n\r\n\r\nSound arises from vibrations giving a wave-like motion to the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere, the wave gradually enlarging as it leaves the\r\nsource of disturbance, while at the same time the motion of the air\r\nparticles becomes less and less. The simplest method of determining the\r\nnumber of vibrations of a sound is by means of Savart’s apparatus. This\r\nconsists of two wheels--a toothed or cog-wheel and a driving-wheel.\r\nThey are so adjusted that the cog-wheel is made to revolve with great\r\nrapidity, its teeth hitting upon a card fixed near it. The number of\r\nrevolutions is indicated by a counter attached to the axis of the\r\ncog-wheel. Suppose that sound is traveling in the air at the rate\r\nof 1,000 ft. per second, and that Savart’s wheel is giving a sound\r\nproduced by 200 taps on the card per second, it follows that in 1,000\r\nft. there will be 200 waves or vibrations, and if there be 200 waves in\r\n1,000 ft. each wave or vibration must be 5 ft. in length. The velocity\r\nof sound through air varies with the temperature of the latter, but is\r\nusually reckoned at 1,130 ft. per second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt What Rate Does Thought Travel?\r\n\r\n\r\nThought travels 111 feet per second, or about a mile and a quarter per\r\nminute. Elaborate experiments have been made by Professors Heimholtz,\r\nHersch, and Donders, to ascertain the facts on this question, the\r\nresult of which was that they found the process of thought varied in\r\nrapidity in different individuals, children and old persons thinking\r\nmore slowly than people of middle age, and ignorant people more slowly\r\nthan the educated. It takes about two-fifths of a second to call\r\nto mind the country in which a well-known town is situated, or the\r\nlanguage in which a familiar author wrote. We can think of the name\r\nof the next month in half the time we need to think of the name of\r\nthe last month. It takes on the average one-third of a second to add\r\nnumbers containing one digit and half a second to multiply them. Those\r\nused to reckoning can add two to three in less time than others; those\r\nfamiliar with literature can remember more quickly than others that\r\nShakespeare wrote “Hamlet.” It takes longer to mention a month when a\r\nseason has been given than to say to what season a month belongs. The\r\ntime taken up in choosing a motion, the “will time,” can be measured as\r\nwell as the time taken up in perceiving. If it is not known which of\r\ntwo colored lights is to be presented, and you offer to lift your right\r\nhand if it be red and your left if it be blue, about one-thirteenth of\r\na second is necessary to initiate the correct motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Largest Tree In the World?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn San Francisco, encircled by a circus tent of ample dimensions, is a\r\nsection of the largest tree in the world--exceeding the diameter of the\r\nfamous tree of Calaveras by five feet. This monster of the vegetable\r\nkingdom was discovered in 1874, on Tule River, Tulare County, about\r\nseventy-five miles from Visalia. At some remote period its top had\r\nbeen broken off by the elements, or some unknown forces, yet when it\r\nwas discovered it had an elevation of 240 feet. The trunk of the tree\r\nwas 111 feet in circumference, with a diameter of 35 feet 4 inches.\r\nThe section on exhibition is hollowed out, leaving about a foot of\r\nbark and several inches of the wood. The interior is 100 feet in\r\ncircumference and 30 feet in diameter, and it has a seating capacity\r\nof about 200. It was cut off from the tree about twelve feet above the\r\nbase, and required the labor of four men for nine days to chop it down.\r\nIn the center of the tree, and extending through its whole length,\r\nwas a rotten core about two feet in diameter, partially filled with a\r\nsoggy, decayed vegetation that had fallen into it from the top. In the\r\ncenter of this cavity was found the trunk of a little tree of the same\r\nspecies, having perfect bark on it, and showing regular growth. It was\r\nof uniform diameter, an inch and a half all the way; and when the tree\r\nfell and split open, this curious stem was traced for nearly 100 feet.\r\nThe rings in this monarch of the forest show its age to have been 4,840\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Did the Term Yankees Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a word said to be a corruption of Yengees, the Indian\r\npronunciation of English, or of the French “Anglais,” when referring\r\nto the English Colonists. It was first applied to the New Englanders\r\nby the British soldiers as a term of reproach, later by the English to\r\nAmericans generally, and still later to the people of the North by the\r\nSoutherners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Far Does the Air Extend?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, generally known that enveloping the earth is a layer\r\nof air fifty or more miles in thickness. Just how thick this layer is\r\nwe do not know, but we do know that it extends many miles from the\r\nearth. You may assure yourselves of this in a very simple manner by\r\nwatching the shooting stars that may be seen on any clear night. These\r\nare nothing but masses of rocks that give off light only when they\r\nhave been made red-hot by friction with the air in their rapid flight.\r\nThe fact that we often see these stars while they are still many miles\r\nfrom the earth proves to us that the air through which they are passing\r\nextends to that height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Us Feel Hungry?\r\n\r\n\r\nHunger is a peculiar craving which we are accustomed to say comes\r\nfrom the stomach. It is the business of the stomach to change such\r\nfood as we take into it in such a way that the rest of the organs of\r\nthe body which we have for the purpose can make blood out of it. When\r\nyou feel the sensation of hunger, it means that the blood-producing\r\nsystem is calling on the stomach to furnish more blood-making material.\r\nThe stomach prepares the food for blood production by mixing with it\r\ncertain juices which the stomach is able to supply. As soon as the\r\nstomach is then called upon to supply more blood-making material, it\r\ngoes to work on what is in the stomach and begins mixing things. If,\r\nhowever, there is nothing in the stomach, the craving which we call\r\nhunger is produced. It is, therefore, then not altogether the stomach\r\nwhich makes us hungry, but the parts of our body which actually turn\r\nthe food into blood after the stomach has prepared it.\r\n\r\nTo prove this it is only necessary to say that the sensation of hunger\r\nwill stop if food which is easily absorbed and, therefore, does not\r\nneed the preparation which the stomach generally gives, is introduced\r\ninto the system through other parts of the body, as, for instance, by\r\ninjecting it into the large intestine, which is a part of the body, the\r\nfood passes through after it leaves the stomach ordinarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Us Thirsty?\r\n\r\n\r\nThirst is a sensation of dryness and heat which is generally\r\ncommunicated to us through the tongue and throat. The sensation of\r\nthirst can be artificially produced by passing a current of air\r\nover the membranes which cover the tongue and throat, but thirst is\r\nnaturally due to a shortage of water in the body. The human body\r\nrequires a great deal of water to keep it in condition, and when the\r\nsupply becomes low a warning is given to us by making the membranes of\r\nthe tongue and throat dry.\r\n\r\nIn connection with thirst, however, as in the case of hunger, where\r\nthe warning is given by the stomach, thirst will be appeased by the\r\nintroduction of water, either into the blood, the stomach or the large\r\nintestine, without having touched either the tongue or throat, which\r\nproves that it is not our tongue or throat that is thirsty, but the\r\nbody itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Pain and Why Does It Hurt?\r\n\r\n\r\nPain is the result of an injury to some part of our bodies, or a\r\ndisturbed condition--a change from the normal condition. Pain is caused\r\nby nerves in the body. The network of nerves coming in big nerves from\r\nthe back bone or spinal chord branches out in all directions, and near\r\nthe surface of the skin they spread out like the tiny twigs of a tree,\r\ncovering every point of the body. Some parts of our bodies are more\r\nsensitive than others. That is because the nerves are then nearer the\r\nsurface or else there are more nerves in that part. The heel is perhaps\r\nthe least sensitive part of the body, as the nerves do not lie so near\r\nthe surface there.\r\n\r\nPain is not a thing which you can make a picture of or describe in\r\nwords. Pain is a sensation of the brain caused by a disturbance of\r\nconditions in some part of the body. If you cut your finger, you cut\r\ncertain veins or arteries and also the tiny nerves in the finger.\r\nThe nerves immediately let the brain know that they are injured, and\r\nthe brain sets to work to have the damage repaired. But there is a\r\ncongestion right where the cut is. The veins being cut, the blood which\r\nwould ordinarily flow through them back to the heart, pours out into\r\nthe cut and the inside of your finger is thus exposed to the oxygen of\r\nthe air, and the action of the air on the exposed part helps to make\r\nthe pain. It is not your finger, however, that hurts. It is the shock\r\nthat your brain gets when you cut your finger that hurts.\r\n\r\nA pain in your stomach is a pain caused by something else than a cut.\r\nIf the stomach could always digest everything or any amount of stuff\r\nyou put in it, you would not have a stomach pain. But sometimes you\r\nput things into your stomach through your mouth, of course, that the\r\nstomach cannot handle. Or, it may be a combination of a number of\r\nthings that cause this unusual condition in your stomach. The stomach\r\nmakes a special effort to get rid of this troublesome substance and\r\ngenerally succeeds eventually, but while the fight is going on, it\r\npains or hurts you.\r\n\r\nPain is the result of a disturbance of the nerves. It is just the\r\nopposite of gladness. We sometimes are so glad we feel good all over.\r\nPain is just the opposite. You can prove that pain is not a real thing\r\nbut only a sensation. Perhaps you have had toothache. You go to the\r\ndentist and he kills the nerve or takes it out. After that you cannot\r\nhave the toothache in that tooth again, because there is no nerve there\r\nto telegraph to the brain, even though the cause of the hurt still\r\nexists. You cannot feel pain unless the brain knows about the injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Horizon?\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course you know what the horizon is. It is easiest to see the\r\nhorizon at sea when out of sight of land. There, when you look in\r\nany direction from the ship to the place where the sea and the sky\r\nmeet you see a line which, if you follow with your eye as you turn\r\ncompletely around, makes a perfect circle. It looks as though it marked\r\nthe boundary of the earth. On land it is not easy to see as much of\r\nthe horizon at one time, because of buildings and trees and hills in\r\nthe woods and elsewhere, but if the land were perfectly smooth like\r\nthe sea and there were no trees or buildings or hills in the way, you\r\ncould see just as perfect a circle on land as on sea. This proves that\r\nthe horizon is a movable circle. On land it is where the earth and sky\r\nappear to meet, and on water it is where sky and water appear to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Far Away Is the Horizon?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actual distance of the horizon away from us depends altogether upon\r\nthe height above the sea level from which we are looking as far as we\r\ncan. The horizon is always as far away as we can see. At the seashore,\r\nwhere we are practically on a level with the water, we cannot see so\r\nfar as when we are up on a bluff or hill overlooking the sea. The\r\nhigher we go up straight from a given point the greater the distance\r\nwe can see up to a certain point and the farther away the horizon will\r\nappear. The height of the person looking, of course, figures in this,\r\nbecause when you are at sea level it is only your feet really that are\r\nat sea level (if you are standing up straight) and the distance of the\r\nhorizon is measured from the eye of the person looking. A boy or girl\r\nof ten would be, say, a little over four feet high, and the eyes of\r\nsuch a person would be about four feet above the level of the sea. At\r\nthat height the horizon would be about two and a half miles away. If\r\nthe eyes are six feet above sea level the distance of the horizon will\r\nbe about three miles, so that practically every one sees a different\r\nhorizon, that is, one that appears at a different distance. A hundred\r\nfeet above the level of the sea the horizon will be more than thirteen\r\nmiles away, while at 1000 feet altitude it would be 42 miles away, and\r\nif you could go a mile into the air the horizon would appear 96 miles\r\nfrom where you are. The higher you go the farther away the circle which\r\napparently marks the joining of the earth and sky appears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can We See Farther When We Are Up High?\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember that the earth is round and you will probably be able to\r\nanswer the question yourself. This one, like most questions boys and\r\ngirls ask, only requires a little thought. The earth, of course, as we\r\nhave learned long ago, is a globe. When you look out on the land or the\r\nsea from a high place you can see more of the earth’s round surface\r\nbefore the curve of the earth’s surface takes things beyond the range\r\nof vision. If you are on a bluff 100 feet high at the seashore and\r\nlooking toward a point where a ship is coming toward shore, you will be\r\nable to see the ship much sooner than if you were at the sea level. In\r\nexact words, you actually see more of the earth’s surface the higher\r\nup you are, because, as you go up your position in relation to the\r\ncurvature of the earth’s surface changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Lobsters Turn Red?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a lobster is taken out of the lobster trap with which the\r\nfisherman traps him, he is green, but when he comes to the table as a\r\nchoice morsel of food his shell is red. We know that he has been boiled\r\nand we know that he goes into the boiling water green and comes out\r\nred. This change in the color of the shell of the lobster is the result\r\nof the effect of boiling water on the coloring material in the shell.\r\nWhen the lobster is put in the boiling water the process of boiling\r\nproduces a chemical change in the color material in the lobster’s\r\nshell. There is no particular reason why the lobster should turn red,\r\nexcepting that that is the effect boiling water has on the coloring\r\nmatter in the shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Have to Die?\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath must come to all things that have life. All matter in the world\r\nis either living (animate) or dead (inanimate). Inanimate things do not\r\nchange. They remain always the same. We can change the form and size of\r\ninanimate things, and particles of them even help to make up the bodies\r\nof the living things, but what they are made of always remains what it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nDeath is one of the things that must occur if we are to continue to\r\nhave more life. The whole plan of living things includes the ability to\r\nreproduce themselves. Every kind of life has the power to produce life\r\nlike itself and this process of reproduction is continuous. If there\r\nwere no death, then the world would soon be crowded with living things\r\nto the point where there would be neither room nor food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE WINDOW GLASS COMES FROM]\r\n\r\n  Pictures herewith by courtesy of Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking Plate Glass\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Difference Between Plate Glass and Window Glass?\r\n\r\nHow is plate glass made? These questions are asked very frequently. The\r\ntwo products are wholly unlike each other; and we wish to show wherein\r\nlies the difference. We shall tell how plate glass is made; and we hope\r\nto make it clear that great care, time and expense are involved in its\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nThe raw materials may be said to be virtually the same in plate glass\r\nas in window glass; the main difference being that in plate glass\r\ngreater care is exercised in selecting and purifying the ingredients.\r\nWindow glass is made with a blow-pipe. The work requires skill on the\r\npart of the operator; but the process is quite simple and rapid. And\r\nthe result is, naturally, a comparatively ordinary and indifferent\r\nproduct. On the other hand, the superb quality of plate glass is owing\r\nto the elaborate method of producing it.\r\n\r\nCommercial plate glass was first made in France somewhat more than two\r\nhundred years ago; although glass in one form or another has been in\r\nuse for many centuries. Apparently glass was known in Egypt fully four\r\nthousand years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINING SILICA]\r\n\r\nThe materials used are silica (white sand), carbonate of soda (soda\r\nash), and lime. Other materials, as arsenic and charcoal, are used in\r\nsmall proportions, but the main ingredients are the first three named.\r\n\r\nProbably it is little imagined that in the production of plate glass,\r\nmining is involved in two or more forms (namely silica and coal), also\r\nthe quarrying of limestone, the chemical manufacture of soda ash on\r\na large scale, the reduction and treatment of fire clay to its right\r\nconsistency, an elaborate and expensive system of pot making; and the\r\nmelting, casting, rolling, annealing, grinding and polishing of the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nIn special uses, as in beveled plates and mirrors, two more elaborate\r\nprocesses must be added--beveling and silvering--all of which are\r\nperformed under the direction of experts aided by a large amount of\r\nlabor and expensive machinery.\r\n\r\nPots of fire clay take so important a part in the successful\r\nmanufacture of plate glass that the subject deserves especial notice.\r\nThe different clays after being mined are exposed to the weather for\r\nsome time to bring about disintegration.\r\n\r\n~THE CLAY MUST BE TRAMPLED WITH BARE FEET~\r\n\r\nAt the proper stage finely sifted raw clay is mixed with coarse, burned\r\nclay and water. This reduces liability of shrinkage and cracking. It\r\nis then “pugged,” or kneaded in a mill; kept a long time (sometimes\r\na year) in storage bins to ripen; and afterwards goes through the\r\nlaborious process of “treading.” Nothing has thus far been found in\r\nmachinery by which the right kind of plasticity can be developed as\r\ndoes this primitive treading by the bare feet of men. The clay must be\r\ntreaded, not once or twice, but many times. The building of pots is a\r\nslow, tedious and time-killing affair; but this is most essential.\r\n\r\n~HOW MELTING POTS ARE MADE~\r\n\r\nWithout extreme care, some elements used in the making of the pots\r\nmight be fused into glass while undergoing the intense heat of the\r\nfurnace; or they might break in the handling. The average pot must hold\r\nabout a ton of molten glass, and the average furnace heat necessary is\r\nabout 3,000° Fahrenheit. The work is not continuous. Each workman has\r\nseveral pots in hand at a time, and passes from one to another adding\r\nonly a few inches a day to each pot, so that a proper interval for\r\nseasoning be given. After completion, comes the proper drying out of\r\nthe pots; and this is another feature in which the greatest scientific\r\ncare is required. No pot may be used until it has been left to season\r\nfor at least three months, and even a year is desirable. And after all\r\nthis trouble, the pot has but 25 days of usefulness. The pots form one\r\nof the heavy items of expense in plate glass manufacture; and upon\r\ntheir safety great things depend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POT MAKING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIXING THE CLAY.\r\n\r\nTRAMPLING THE CLAY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKIMMING THE POT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTING PLATE GLASS.]\r\n\r\n~HOW THE HUGE PLATES OF GLASS ARE CAST~\r\n\r\nThe pot, having been first brought to the necessary high temperature,\r\nis filled heaping full with its mixed “batch” of ground silica, soda,\r\nlime, etc. Melting reduces the bulk so much that the pot is filled\r\nthree times before it contains a sufficient charge of metal. When the\r\nproper molten stage is reached the pot is lifted out of the furnace\r\nby a crane; is first carefully skimmed to remove surface impurities,\r\nand then carried overhead by an electric tramway to the casting table.\r\nThis is a large, massive, flat table of iron, having as an attachment\r\na heavy iron roller which covers the full width, and arranged so as\r\nto roll the entire length of the table. The sides of the table are\r\nfitted with adjustable strips which permit the producing of plates of\r\ndifferent thicknesses. The pasty, or half-fluid glass metal is now\r\npoured upon the table from the melting pot, and the roller quickly\r\npasses over it, leaving a layer of uniform thickness. The heavy roller\r\nis now moved out of the way, and then by means of a stowing tool the\r\nred hot plate is shoved into an annealing oven. All of these stages\r\nof the work have to be performed with remarkable speed, and by men of\r\nlong training and experience. The plates remain for several days in\r\nthe annealing oven, where the temperature is gradually reduced from an\r\nintense heat at first, until at the end of the required period it is\r\nno hotter than an ordinary room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING THE GRINDING TABLE.]\r\n\r\nWhen the plate is taken from the annealing oven it has a rough, opaque,\r\nalmost undulating appearance on the surfaces. It is only the surface,\r\nhowever, for within it is as clear as crystal. First, it is submitted\r\nfor careful inspection, so that bubbles or other defects may be marked\r\nfor cutting out. It then goes to the cutter who takes off the rough\r\nedges and squares it into the right dimensions; and thence to the\r\ngrinding room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE GLASS PLATES ARE GROUND\r\n\r\nGRINDING THE PLATES]\r\n\r\nThe grinding table is a large flat revolving platform made of iron,\r\ntwenty-five feet or more in diameter. The plate must be carried from\r\nthe annealing oven to the grinding machines, and thence to the racks,\r\nby men skilled in the art. Twenty men are required to carry the larger\r\nplates of glass, ten on each side, using leather straps and stepping\r\ntogether in perfect time. The lock-step is absolutely essential to\r\nprevent accident. The grinding table is prepared by being flooded with\r\nplaster of Paris and water; then the glass is carefully lowered, and a\r\nnumber of men mount upon the plate and tramp it into place until it is\r\nset. After this, greater security is obtained by pegging with prepared\r\nwooden pins; and then the table is set in motion. The grinding is done\r\nby revolving runners. Sharp sand is fed upon the table, and a stream of\r\nwater constantly flows over it. After the first cutting by the sand,\r\nemery is used in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThe plates are inspected after leaving the grinding room, and if any\r\nscratches or defects of any kind are found they are marked. Some of\r\nthese can be rubbed down by hand. There are also, not infrequently,\r\nnicks and fractures found at this stage; and in such case the plate\r\nmust again be cut and squared. Afterward comes the polishing, which\r\nis done on another special table. The polishing material is rouge, or\r\niron peroxide, applied with water, and the rubbing is done by blocks\r\nof felt. Reciprocating machinery is so arranged that every part of the\r\nplate is brought underneath the rubbing surface.\r\n\r\nThe grinding and polishing has taken away from the original plate half\r\nof its thickness, sometimes more. There is no saving of the material;\r\nit has all been washed away. When to this waste is added the fact that\r\nfully half of the original weight of lime and soda has been released\r\nby the heat of the furnace, escaping into the atmosphere in fumes and\r\nacids, one may begin to understand something of the cost of converting\r\nthe rough materials of sand, limestone and soda into beautiful plate\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n~HOW MIRRORS ARE MADE~\r\n\r\nIn preparing plate glass for mirrors great care must be exercised in\r\nthe selection of the plates. This selection bears reference not only to\r\nsurface defects, but to the quality in general; defects which cannot\r\nordinarily be seen are magnified many fold after the glass has received\r\na covering of silver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEVELING PLATES]\r\n\r\nIn the process of beveling, the plate passes through the hands of\r\nskilled workmen of five different divisions, namely: roughers,\r\nemeriers, smoothers, white-wheelers and buffers; and different abrasive\r\nmaterials are used in the order indicated by the titles. These\r\nmaterials are sand, emery, natural sandstone imported from England,\r\npumice and rouge.\r\n\r\nThe roughing mill is a circular cast-iron disk about 28 inches in\r\ndiameter, constructed so that the face or top of the mill revolves upon\r\na horizontal plane at a speed of about 250 revolutions per minute. The\r\nsand is conveyed to the mill from above through a hopper simultaneously\r\nwith a stream of water which is played upon the sand to carry it to\r\nthe mill. The rougher places the edge of the plate upon the rapidly\r\nrevolving mill, and the cutting of the bevel is done by the passage\r\nof the sand between the mill and the plate of glass. A bevel of any\r\ndesired width may be produced. Pattern plates containing incurves,\r\nmitres, etc., require a practiced eye and great skill upon the part of\r\nthe operator.\r\n\r\nWhen the plate leaves the rougher’s hands the surface of the bevel has\r\nbeen ground so deep by the coarse sand that polishing at this stage is\r\nimpossible. Consequently, in order to produce a surface fine enough\r\nto render it susceptible of a high and brilliant polish it must go\r\nthrough the various treatments we have mentioned. The emerier uses a\r\nfine grade of emery on a mill similar in construction to a roughing\r\nmill, which takes away considerable of the coarse surface given by the\r\nfirst cutting. Then it goes to the smoother, who reduces the roughness\r\nslowly by using a fine sandstone from England; then it goes to the\r\nwhite-wheeler who operates an upright poplar-wood wheel using powdered\r\npumice stone as an abrasive; and then, as a last stage it reaches the\r\nbuffer, whose method of operation is shown in the illustration. The\r\nbuffer brings a high polish to the bevel by the use of rouge applied to\r\nthick felt which covers his wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVERING MIRROR PLATES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The two photographs here are of the same building taken\r\nunder contrasting conditions. The first picture was taken through a\r\nwindow glazed with common window glass. It is an extreme example, to\r\nbe sure, but of a sort not infrequently seen. The second view shows\r\nthe same building taken through a window of polished, flawless plate\r\nglass. An observing person can see this startling contrast any day as\r\nhe walks along a residence street. At intervals a front window will\r\nbe seen which gives a twisted, distorted reflection of the houses or\r\ntrees on the opposite side: this is window glass. The other kind--the\r\nwindow that gives a sharp brilliant reflection--is _plate glass_. It\r\nis practically impossible to obtain superior reflecting quality from\r\nwindow glass. It can only be had from surfaces which have been ground\r\nand polished.]\r\n\r\nThe plate, after leaving the beveling room, is again carefully examined\r\nfor surface defects. These defects may consist of scratches caused\r\ninadvertently by permitting the surface of the plate to come into\r\ncontact with the abrasive material. These scratches are removed by hand\r\npolishing, which must be skillfully done; otherwise the reflection will\r\nbecome distorted through over-polishing in a given area or spot. The\r\nplate is then taken to a wash table where the surface to be silvered\r\nis thoroughly washed with distilled water; after which it is taken\r\nto a table that is covered with blankets, and which is heated to a\r\ntemperature of from 90° to 110°. The blanketing is to protect the plate\r\nfrom being scratched, and also to catch all of the silver waste. The\r\nsilvering solution is nitrate of silver liquefied by a certain formula,\r\nand is poured over the plate; the fluid having an appearance which to\r\nthe ordinary observer looks like nothing other than pure distilled\r\nwater. Within a few minutes the silver, aided by a reactory, added\r\nprior to pouring, begins to precipitate upon the glass; the liquids\r\nremaining above, and thus preventing air and impurities from coming\r\ninto contact with the silver. Such contact would produce oxidation.\r\nAfter the silver is precipitated the plate is thoroughly dried,\r\nshellacked and painted; after which it is ready for commercial use.\r\n\r\nUntil about 25 years ago, practically all mirrors were silvered with\r\nmercury. There have been two reasons for discouraging the use of\r\nmercury for silvering; one being its injuriousness to the health of\r\nthe workmen. In some European countries stringent laws were enacted,\r\nstipulating that men should work only a certain number of hours.\r\n\r\nOther hygienic stipulations, added to the fact that the use of mercury\r\nwas already very expensive, have tended to replace that process by the\r\nuse of nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is the Sky Blue?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis question puzzled every one who thought of it for a long time.\r\nEven astronomers, the men who make a business of studying the skies,\r\nand other learned men, puzzled their brains about it and searched for\r\nthe answer long ago, until finally, as always happens when a lot of\r\npeople study a subject, Professor John Tyndall, a noted scientist of\r\nthe last century, discovered the answer. The explanation follows: All\r\nthe light we have is sunlight, which is pure white light. This white\r\nlight is made up of rays of light of different colors. These rays are\r\nred, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. It takes all of\r\nthese different rays of light to make our white sunlight, and when\r\nyou separate sunlight into its original rays you always produce the\r\nrays of light in the above colors and in the same order. This is only\r\ntrue, however, when the sunlight is passed through an object which does\r\nnot absorb any of its rays. This is the arrangement of the different\r\ncolors of light found in the rainbow. The rainbow is formed by sunlight\r\npassing into raindrops or vapor in such a way as to divide the sunlight\r\ninto the different colored rays of light. When the rainbow is formed\r\nnone of the rays are absorbed by raindrops or vapor through which the\r\nsunlight passes. Some of these rays of light are known as short rays\r\nand others as long rays. But when sunlight meets other things besides\r\nthose which make a pure rainbow, these other objects have the ability\r\nto absorb some of the rays of colored light, and they throw off the\r\nremainder. When these rays have been thrown off those which have been\r\nabsorbed make many different combinations, and thus are produced all of\r\nthe different colors we know, the various tints and shades of color,\r\naccording to composition and size.\r\n\r\nNow, then, to get back to the color of the sky, which is blue as we\r\nknow. The sky or air which surrounds the earth is filled with countless\r\ntiny specks of what we may call dust--particles of solid things hanging\r\nor floating in the air. These specks are of just the size and quality\r\nthat they catch and absorb part of the rays of light which form our\r\nsunlight and throw off the rest of the rays, and the part which has\r\nbeen absorbed forms the combination of color which makes our sky so\r\nbeautifully blue. Sometimes you notice, of course, that the sky is a\r\nlighter or darker blue than at other times. This difference is due\r\nto the kind and condition of tiny specks in the air at the time, and\r\nto the direction or angle at which the sunlight strikes these tiny\r\nparticles. This fact brings up a question which you have not asked, but\r\nwhich would come naturally as the result of your first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Colors of the Sunset?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe direction of the sun’s rays when they meet these large and small\r\nparticles in the air has a great deal to do with the combination of\r\ncolors that result as these objects absorb part of the rays and throw\r\noff others. The sky is the most beautiful blue when the sun is high in\r\nthe sky. But when the sun is setting the light has a greater distance\r\nto travel through the belt of air which surrounds the earth than\r\nwhen it is high up over our heads. You know that if you stick a pin\r\nstraight down into an orange it won’t go in very far before it is clear\r\nthrough the peel, but if you stick the pin into an orange along the\r\nedge it will go through a great deal more of the peel than the other\r\nway. That is the way it is with the sunset colors. The peel of the\r\norange is a good representation of the belt of air which surrounds the\r\nearth. At sunset the light instead of coming straight down through the\r\nbelt of air, thus meeting the eye through the shortest possible amount\r\nof air, strikes the air on a slant, and, therefore, travels through\r\na great deal more air and closer to the earth to reach it, with the\r\nresults that it meets a great many more of these little specks, besides\r\nall the smoke and other things that hang in the air near the ground,\r\nand we thus get many more colors, because some of the things in the air\r\nabsorb some of the rays and others absorb very different rays when the\r\nlight comes in this slanting way, and that is what makes the different\r\ncolors in the sunset. For this reason sunsets are often richer and more\r\nbeautiful in color when the air is not so pure, but has much dirt and\r\nother matter floating about in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre There Two Sides to the Rainbow?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, there is only one side to the rainbow. The rainbow is made by\r\nreflection of the rays of sunlight through drops of water in the air,\r\nbut you can never see a rainbow unless you are between it and the sun.\r\nYou could never see a rainbow if you were looking at the sun, and so\r\nif you are looking at a rainbow you can be certain that anyone on\r\nthe other side of it could not see it, because they would have to be\r\nlooking right at the sun. The rainbow is always opposite to the sun and\r\nthere can never be two sides to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo the Ends of the Rainbow Rest on Land?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ends of the rainbow do not rest on anything. You see, the rainbow\r\nis only the reflection of the sun’s rays thrown back to us by the\r\ninside of the back of the raindrops, which are still in the sky after\r\nthe rain. Of course, if any of the drops of water touched the ground\r\nthey would cease to be raindrops and, therefore, could not reflect the\r\nrays of the sunlight. So, what we think of as the ends of the rainbow\r\ndo not really exist at all. The rainbow is only a reflection of the\r\nrays of sunlight from countless drops of water in the air, which the\r\nsun’s rays must strike at a certain angle in order to reflect back the\r\nlight so we can see it. Where the sun’s rays do not strike the drops of\r\nwater at the right angle no light is reflected, and there is the end of\r\nthe rainbow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes the Different Colors of the Rainbow?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colors of the rainbow, which are always the same, and are shown in\r\nthis order--red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet--are sunlight\r\nbroken up into its original colors. It takes all of these colors in the\r\nproportions in which they are mixed in the rainbow to make the pure\r\nsunlight. These are known as the prismatic colors. As shown in another\r\nanswer to one of your puzzling questions, the rainbow is caused by the\r\nrays of the sun passing into drops of water in the air and reflected\r\nback to us with one part of the drop of water acting on it in such a\r\nway as to break up the pure sunlight into these prismatic colors. When\r\na rainbow appears at a time when there is a great deal of sunlight, you\r\nwill generally see two rainbows. The inner rainbow is formed by the\r\nrays of the sun that enter the upper part of the falling raindrops, and\r\nthe outer rainbow is formed by the rays that enter the under part of\r\nthe raindrops. In the inner or primary bow, as it is called, the colors\r\nbeginning at the outside ring of color are red, orange, yellow, green,\r\nblue and violet, and being exactly reversed in the outer or secondary\r\nbow. The secondary bow is also fainter. You may sometimes see smaller\r\nrainbows, even if it has not been raining, when looking at a fountain\r\nor waterfall. These are caused in exactly the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Hills Look Blue Sometimes?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that when the hills look blue you are looking\r\nat them at a distance, and there is a long stretch of air between you\r\nand the hills. This air is filled with countless particles of dust\r\nand other things, and what you see is not really blue hills, but the\r\nreflection of the sun’s rays from the little particles in the air\r\nstriking your eye. The color is due to the angle at which the light\r\nfrom the sun strikes these particles, and is reflected back to your eye\r\nand partially due to the character of the particles in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo the Stars Really Shoot Down?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer is “No.” We have come to use the expression “shooting stars”\r\ncommonly, but we should probably be more correct if we said “shooting\r\nrocks,” for the things we refer to commonly as “shooting stars” are\r\nmore like rocks than anything else. If any of the real stars were to\r\nfall into the air surrounding the earth we should all be burned up by\r\nthe great heat developed long before it actually hit the earth, which\r\nit would undoubtedly destroy.\r\n\r\nThe things that fall and leave a streak of light are really only\r\npebbles, stones, rocks or pieces of iron and other substances that fall\r\nfrom some place into the earth’s air belt. When they strike the air\r\nat the speed at which they are falling the friction of the air makes\r\na heat that causes them to become luminous, and by far the greater\r\npart of them is burned up before they get very near the earth. We call\r\nthem meteorites. Sometimes, though rarely, one will manage to strike\r\nthe earth, coming at such great speed and being so large that the air\r\nhas not been able to burn it up completely, and it will strike the\r\nearth and sink deep down into the soil. In most museums can be seen\r\nsuch meteorites that have been dug up after striking the earth. These\r\nare constantly falling into the air surrounding the earth, but in the\r\nday-time their light is not strong enough to be seen while the sun is\r\nshining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill the Sky Ever Fall Down?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, the sky can never fall down, because it is not made of the kind of\r\nthings that fall. We have become used to thinking of it as the roof\r\nof the earth, a great dome-shaped roof, because in our little way of\r\nlooking at things we compared the earth and what is above it with the\r\nhouses in which we live. The sky is just space in which the heavenly\r\nbodies revolve in their orbits. We cannot really ever see sky. We see\r\nonly the sun’s light reflected by the air belt which surrounds the\r\nearth. In this air belt are the clouds which do come closer to the\r\nland at times than at others, and this is apt to aid in giving us an\r\nincorrect impression of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Milky Way?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Galaxy,” or “Milky Way,” as it is popularly called, is a luminous\r\ncircle extending completely around the heavens. It is produced by\r\nmyriads of stars, as can be seen when you look at it through a\r\ntelescope. It divides into two great branches at one point, which\r\ntravel for some distance separately and then reunite. It has also\r\nseveral branches. At one point it spreads out very widely into a\r\nfanlike shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do They Call It the Milky Way?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars in the group are so numerous that they present to the naked\r\neye a whiteness like a stream of milk. To produce this effect there are\r\nnot hundreds of stars, nor thousands of them, but actually millions of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen you stop to think that each one of these stars in the Milky Way\r\nis a sun like our own--some of them smaller, of course, but many of\r\nthem much larger--you begin to realize how impossible it is for man to\r\nform any real idea of the magnitude and wonders of the earth. Here in\r\nthe Milky Way are so many suns like our own sun that they together as\r\nwe look at them form the particles of a path which makes the circle of\r\nthe heavens, and yet are so far away that to the naked eye each of them\r\nlooks to us like only one of countless drops of milk in a very large\r\nstream of milk that goes around the whole sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Don’t the Stars Shine in the Day-time?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars do shine in the day-time. If you will go down into a deep\r\nwell or the open shaft of a deep mine and look up at the sky, of which\r\nyou can see a circular patch at the top of the well, you will be able\r\nto see the stars in the day-time. The moon also shines in the day-time,\r\non some part of the earth. At certain times during the month you can\r\nnotice that the moon rises before the sun sets, and sometimes in the\r\nmorning you can still see the moon in the sky after the sun is up.\r\nUsually you cannot see either the moon or the stars in the day-time,\r\nbecause the light from the sun is so bright and strong that the light\r\nof the stars and moon are lost in the brightness of the sun’s rays.\r\nWhen the moon is visible before the sun sets or after the sun has risen\r\nit is because the light of the sun is not so bright and strong at the\r\nbeginning or close of daylight. If you are fortunate enough some time\r\nto witness a total eclipse of the sun you will be able to see the stars\r\nin day-time without having to go down into a deep well or mine shaft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Far Does Space Reach?\r\n\r\n\r\nSpace surrounds all earths, planets, suns, and extends for an infinite\r\ndistance beyond each of them in all directions. It is impossible to\r\nmeasure in terms of human knowledge how far space extends. It is one\r\nof the things beyond the comprehension of the human mind, and for that\r\nreason man can never know in miles or the number of millions of miles\r\nhow far it extends. Man has been able to measure the distance from\r\nthe earth of some of the stars, and some of the nearest of them are\r\nmillions of miles from the earth. Most of them are hundreds and even\r\nthousands of million miles away, and when we stop to think that space\r\nextends at least as far on the other sides of the stars as it does on\r\nthis side, and even beyond that, we can readily understand that it is\r\nnot only impossible to measure space, but also impossible to give in\r\nwords any conception of what its limits might be.\r\n\r\nThere is one word--infinite--which we are forced to use in speaking of\r\nthe extent of space. Infinite means “without end,” unbounded, and so\r\nman has come to use the word “infinite” in describing the extent of\r\nspace, and that is as near as any one can describe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Does Horse Power Mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term “horse power” is used in describing the amount of power\r\nproduced by an engine or motor. When man made the first engines he\r\nneeded some term to use in describing the amount of power his engine\r\ncould develop. Up to that time man had used the horse for turning the\r\nwheels of his machinery and the horse to him naturally represented the\r\nmost powerful animal working for man. When engines came into use they\r\nreplaced the horses because they were capable of developing many times\r\nthe power of the horse. In finding an expression which would accurately\r\nconvey to the mind of another the power of a particular engine, it\r\nwas natural to say that this engine would do the work of five, ten or\r\nmore horses, and as this described it accurately and in a way that was\r\nentirely clear, it became customary to describe the power of an engine\r\nas so many times the power of one horse.\r\n\r\nTo-day we still cling to the term “horse power” in describing the\r\nstrength of the engine, although the horse-power unit used to-day is\r\ngreater than the power of an average horse. To speak of an engine of\r\none horse power to-day means an engine that has the power to lift\r\n30,000 pounds one foot in one minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE OUR COAL COMES FROM\r\n\r\nA COAL BREAKER.\r\n\r\nCoal is brought in mine cars from several mine shafts and slopes,\r\ndumped onto a conveyor that runs on the inclined framework shown at\r\nthe right of the picture. At the top it is broken in rolls, sorted and\r\nsized as it slides through the different screens, pickers, etc., and is\r\nfinally delivered into railroad cars.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Lump of Coal\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did the Coal Get Into the Coal Mines?\r\n\r\nThe heavy black mineral called coal, which we burn in our stoves\r\nand furnaces, and use to heat the boilers of our engines was formed\r\nfrom trees and plants of various sorts. Most of the coal was formed\r\nthousands of years ago at a time when the atmosphere that envelopes the\r\nearth contained a much larger proportion of carbonic acid gas than it\r\ndoes now, and the climate of all regions of the earth was much warmer\r\nthan it now is. This period was known as the carboniferous age, that\r\nis, the coal-making age, and its atmospheric conditions, favored the\r\ngrowth of plants, so that the earth was covered with great forests,\r\nof trees, giant ferns, and other plants, many of which are no longer\r\nfound on the earth. In the warm, moist, and carbon-laden atmosphere of\r\nthat period the growth of all kinds of plants was rapid and luxuriant,\r\nand as fast as old trees fell and partially decayed, others grew up in\r\ntheir places. In this way, thick layers of vegetable matter were formed\r\nover the soil in which the plants grew. In many places, where these\r\nbeds were formed, the surface of the earth became depressed and the\r\nwater of the sea flowed over the beds of vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nSediment of various kinds was deposited over the vegetable matter, and\r\nin the course of centuries the sediment was transformed into rock.\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of the covering of sediment, the decay of the\r\nvegetable matter was checked, but a slow change of another kind was\r\nbrought about by the pressure of the sedimentary deposits and the heat\r\nto which the plant remains were subjected. The hydrogen and oxygen\r\nwhich constituted the greater part of the plant substance was driven\r\noff and the carbon left behind. This change took place very gradually,\r\nthrough periods so long that we can only guess at their duration, but\r\nwe know that many beds of coal were formed from layers of vegetable\r\nmatter that were covered up many thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINE WORKERS THAT NEVER SEE DAYLIGHT\r\n\r\nUnderground stable constructed of concrete and iron, with natural rock\r\nroof to avoid danger of fire. Mules are only taken to surface when\r\nmines are idle.]\r\n\r\nThe coal first formed and submitted longest to pressure is known as\r\nhard coal, or anthracite. It is pure black, or has a bluish metallic\r\nluster. Its specific gravity is 1.46; which is about the same as that\r\nof hard wood. Anthracite contains from 90 to 94 per cent. of carbon,\r\nthe remainder being composed of hydrogen, oxygen, and ash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Mules and their drivers.--An important part of the\r\nhaulage system. Mules are kept in stables on surface at this mine and\r\ndriven in every day through slope or drift.]\r\n\r\nHard coal may be called the ideal fuel and is especially adapted to\r\ndomestic heating purposes. It burns without smoke and produces great\r\nheat. There is no soot deposit upon the walls of chimneys, and in good\r\nstoves or furnaces the small amount of gas given off by it is consumed.\r\nAnthracite is the least abundant of all the varieties of coal and is\r\nmuch more costly than the other varieties. For this reason it is not\r\nmuch used in manufacturing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE SLATE PICKERS WORK\r\n\r\nBoy slate pickers. Coal slides down the chutes. Boys pick out the slate\r\nand rock and throw into chute alongside.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spiral slate pickers do work of many boys. Coal and rock\r\nstart together at the top in the small inner spiral. The coal being\r\nlighter slides faster, and in going around is carried over the edge\r\ninto the outer spiral, while the rock continues in the bottom.]\r\n\r\nThe coal formed later is very different in composition and is called\r\nbituminous or soft coal. Its name is derived from the fact that it\r\ncontains a soft substance called bitumen, which oozes out of the coal\r\nwhen heat is applied to it. Soft coal contains from 75 to 85 per cent.\r\nof carbon, some traces of sulphur, and a larger percentage of oxygen\r\nand hydrogen than anthracite. When soft coal is heated in a closed\r\nvessel or retort, the hydrogen and oxygen, in combination with some\r\ncarbon, are driven off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW A COAL MINE LOOKS INSIDE\r\n\r\nShaft gate. One of the two cages in the shaft has just brought the men\r\nto the surface; the other is at the bottom. Safety gate resting on top\r\nof cage covers top of shaft when cage is down, as shown at right.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section showing Anthracite Seams. Coal is shown black;\r\nrock and dirt lighter; shaft tunnels and workings, white. Upper part of\r\n“Mammoth” seam is stripped and quarried.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lignite mine in Texas. Loaded mine cars ready to go to\r\nsurface.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE MINERS LOOSEN THE COAL\r\n\r\nUndercutting with pick. The man lying on his side cuts under the coal.\r\nA light charge of powder exploded in a drill hole near the roof breaks\r\nthe coal down in large pieces.]\r\n\r\nSoft coal is black, and upon smooth surfaces it is glossy. It lacks the\r\nbluish luster sometimes seen in hard coal and is much softer and more\r\neasily broken. When handled it blackens the hands more than hard coal\r\ndoes. In this kind of coal are frequently seen the outlines of leaves\r\nand stems of plants that enter into its formation. Occasionally, trunks\r\nof trees with roots extending down into the clay below the bed of coal\r\nhave been found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Undercutting in seam. A compressed air driven machine\r\nundercuts deeper and faster than the man with a pick.]\r\n\r\nSoft coal has a specific gravity of 1.27. It burns with a yellow flame\r\nwhich is larger than the flame from hard coal, but it does not emit so\r\nhigh a degree of heat. Combustion, generally imperfect, gives rise to\r\noffensive gases and to black smoke that concentrates in the air and\r\nfalls to the ground as soot, which blackens buildings, and, in winter,\r\nnoticeably discolors the snow.\r\n\r\nThe formation of lignite has been observed in the timbers of some\r\nold mines in Europe. In some of these mines wooden pillars have been\r\nsupporting the rocks above for four hundred years or longer, and in\r\nthat time the pressure of the rocks and other influences acting upon\r\nthe wood of the pillars have caused it to become transformed into a\r\nbrown substance resembling lignite. This fact tends to confirm the\r\ntheory of coal formation stated at the beginning of this article. The\r\nproportion of carbon in lignite is never above 70 per cent., and the\r\nash indicates the presence of considerable earthy matter. It is chiefly\r\nused in those forms of manufacture where a hot fire is not required. In\r\nEurope it is used, to some extent, in heating the houses of the poorer\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nPeat is regarded as the latest of the coal formations. In it, the\r\nchange in the vegetable matter has not extended beyond merely covering\r\nit, and subjecting it to slight pressure.\r\n\r\nPeat is formed in marshy soils where there is a considerable growth\r\nof plants that are constantly undergoing partial decay and becoming\r\ncovered by water. It consists of the roots and stems of the plants\r\nmatted together and mingled with some earthy material. When freshly\r\ndug out of the bog or marsh in which it was formed there is always a\r\nquantity of water in it, the amount being greatest in the peat found\r\nnearest the surface and least in that at the bottom of the bed, where\r\nthe peat is not very different in appearance from lignite.\r\n\r\nPeat is used for fuel where wood is scarce and coal is high in price.\r\nRecent experiments in saturating peat with petroleum, have shown that\r\nin this way a form of fuel may be produced for which considerable value\r\nis claimed. Its manufacture is confined to Southern Russia, where peat\r\nis plentiful and petroleum is cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Firedamp Explode in a Safety Lamp Without Producing an\r\nExplosion of the Gas With Which the Lamp Is Surrounded?\r\n\r\nThe passing of the flame from the lamp to the outside air is prevented\r\nby the gauze. This splits the burning gas into little streamlets (784\r\nto each square inch of gauze), which are cooled below the point of\r\nignition, that is, are extinguished by coming in contact with the metal\r\nof the gauze, so that the flame does not pass outside the lamp. In some\r\ncases the explosion may be so great as to force the flame through the\r\ngauze and thus ignite the gas outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre There Any Conditions Under Which it Would Not Be Safe to Use a\r\nSafety Lamp?\r\n\r\n~THE DANGERS TO THE MINERS~\r\n\r\nThe underground conditions affecting the safety of the lamp are\r\nexposure in air-currents of high velocity by reason of which the flame\r\nmay be blown through or against the gauze, or exposure for too great\r\na time to mixtures of air and gas which will burn within the lamp and\r\nthus heat the gauze. The dangerous velocity of air-currents begins at\r\nabout 500 feet a minute, but varies with the type of lamp, some being\r\nmuch less sensitive to air-currents of high velocity than others. Other\r\nconditions under which the lamp is not safe concern the lamp itself or\r\nthe one using it. The lamp is dangerous in the hands of inexperienced\r\npersons or when the gauze is dirty or broken. If the gauze is dirty,\r\nthat portion absorbs the heat and may become hot enough to ignite the\r\noutside gas; naturally any holes in the gauze will pass the flame.\r\n\r\nThe safety lamp when left too long in air containing much explosive gas\r\nmay cause an explosion, and it is extinguished by certain unbreathable\r\ngases. The electric lamp burns safely regardless of the atmosphere,\r\nbut gives no warning of poisonous or explosive gases. It is often used\r\nby rescue men wearing oxygen helmets to enter mines full of poisonous\r\ngases after explosions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAMP WHICH SAVES MANY LIVES\r\n\r\nThe safety lamp. The sheet iron bonnet or covering of the upper part\r\nprotects the gauze within from strong currents of air, while the glass\r\npermits the light to be diffused. The above is a modern lamp similar to\r\na bonnetted Clanny lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe safety lamp is dangerous when there is a hole in the gauze that\r\nwill permit the passage of flame to the outside, or when the gauze\r\nis dirty, so that any particular spot may be overheated, or when the\r\nvelocity of the air is so great that the flame is blown through the\r\ngauze, or (generally) when in the hands of an inexperienced person. The\r\nunbonneted Davy lamp is not safe where the velocity of the air exceeds\r\n360 feet per minute. The velocity with which the air strikes a lamp\r\ncarried against it is increased by the amount equal to the rate at\r\nwhich the fireboss travels. If he walks at the rate of, say, 4 miles an\r\nhour or 352 feet a minute (on the gangways he will usually have to move\r\nfaster than this to make his rounds on time) he will create by his own\r\nmotion (and in still air) a velocity practically the same as that at\r\nwhich the unbonneted Davy is considered unsafe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Open oil lamp commonly worn on hat. Wick is inverted in\r\nspout.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Acetylene or carbide lamp for cap or hand.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of the Safety Lamp.\r\n\r\nThe safety lamp, the miner’s faithful and indispensable companion at\r\nhis dangerous work, has been, heretofore, considered as the invention\r\nof the famous English scientist, Humphrey Davy, though the name of\r\nGeorge Stephenson, of locomotive fame, has also been mentioned in\r\nthis connection. Both came out with their inventions about the same\r\ntime, but neither of them is the real inventor of the safety lamp; for\r\nthere was, as proven by Wilhelm Nieman, a safety lamp in existence two\r\nyears before Davy’s invention became known. It was not inferior to the\r\nlatter, but rather surpassed it in illuminating power. Previous to\r\nthis, all the precaution employed for the prevention of the threatening\r\ndangers of firedamp had been quite incomplete. One tried to thoroughly\r\nventilate the mines by fastening a burning torch to a large pole, which\r\nwas pushed ahead and exploded the gases. This was extremely dangerous\r\nwork which, in the Middle Ages, was generally done by a criminal,\r\nin order that he might atone for his crimes, or by a penitent for\r\nthe benefit of mankind. The attempt to substitute for the open light\r\nphosphorescent substances, encased in glass, was not much of a success.\r\nAn improvement was the so-called steel mill, invented about 1750 by\r\nCarlyle Spedding, manager of a mine. This steel mill consisted of a\r\nsteel wheel which was put into rapid motion by means of a crank. By\r\npressing a firestone against the fast revolving wheel, an incessant\r\nshower of sparks was produced giving a fairly good and absolutely safe\r\nillumination. However, the running expenses of his apparatus, which\r\nnecessitated the continual services of one man, were very high; for\r\ninstance, the expenditure for light in a coal mine near Newcastle in\r\nthe year 1816 amounted to about $200 per week. Nevertheless, the steel\r\nmill was very much appreciated and in use for a long time, only to be\r\nslowly supplanted by the safety lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC CAP LAMP AND BATTERY.\r\n\r\nThe safety lamp when left too long in air containing much explosive gas\r\nmay cause an explosion, and it is extinguished by certain unbreathable\r\ngases. The electric lamp burns safely regardless of the atmosphere,\r\nbut gives no warning of poisonous or explosive gases. It is often used\r\nby rescue men wearing oxygen helmets to enter mines full of poisonous\r\ngases after explosions.]\r\n\r\n~THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE SAFETY LAMP~\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century the existing coal mines\r\nwere worked to the limit and the catastrophies, caused by firedamp,\r\nincreased in an alarming manner. In fact the distress was so great that\r\nin 1812 a society for the prevention of mine disasters was formed at\r\nSutherland, and the origin of the safety lamp can be traced back to\r\nthe efforts and labors of this organization. Dr. William Reid Clanny,\r\na retired ship’s surgeon, was probably the first to undertake the task\r\n(in the year 1808), which he successfully finished with energy and\r\nskill. He concentrated his efforts at first on the separation of the\r\nflames from the surrounding atmosphere, but he did not succeed till the\r\nlatter part of 1812, when he constructed a lamp that seemed to meet\r\nall requirements. The report of this invention was submitted to the\r\nRoyal Society of London, May 20, 1813, and was printed in the minutes\r\nof that academy. The casing of this original safety lamp was closed\r\nat the top and bottom by two open water tanks; the air was pumped in\r\nby means of bellows and, passing in and out, had to go through both\r\nthese reservoirs which acted as valves, so to speak. The lamp proved to\r\nbe absolutely safe and was successfully introduced by the management\r\nof Herrington Mill pit mine. The clumsy parts of this apparatus were\r\neliminated by its inventor by various improvements. The so-called steam\r\nsafety lamp was completed in December, 1815, and installed in several\r\nmines. In the meanwhile, two competitors made their appearance. George\r\nStephenson had finished his lamp October 21, 1815, and Davy published\r\nhis first experiments November 9, 1815, in the Transactions of the\r\nRoyal Society of London. Clanny’s lamp, nevertheless, stood the test in\r\nthe face of this competition, through its much superior illuminating\r\npower, and more particularly as it still continued to burn when the\r\nDavy and Stephenson lamps had gone out. To Clanny, therefore, belongs\r\nthe distinction, in the history of invention, of having constructed the\r\nfirst reliable safety lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is a Metal?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oldest known metals in the world are gold and silver, copper, iron,\r\ntin and lead. They are to-day still the most useful and widely-used\r\nmetals. Some of the properties by which we distinguish metals are the\r\nfollowing: They are solid and not transparent; they have luster and\r\nare heavy. Mercury is an exception to the rule; it is a liquid, though\r\nyet a metal, and there is another, sodium, which is solid, though very\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Most Valuable Metal?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were guessing you would naturally say that gold is, of course,\r\nthe most valuable of the metals. But you would be wrong. The proper\r\nanswer to this is iron. We do not mean the pound for pound value, for\r\nyou could get much more for a pound of gold than for a pound of iron.\r\nWe mean in useful value--iron is in that sense the most valuable metal\r\nknown to man. This is true because iron is of such great service to man\r\nin so many ways, and it is very fortunate that there is such a great\r\namount of it available for man’s purposes. Iron is not generally found\r\nin a pure state in the mines. It is generally found compounded with\r\ncarbon and other substances, and we obtain pure iron by burning these\r\nother substances out of the compound.\r\n\r\nIron is put upon the market in three forms, which differ very much in\r\ntheir properties. First, there is cast-iron. Iron in this form is hard,\r\neasily fusible and quite brittle, as you will know if you ever broke a\r\nlid on the kitchen range. In the form of cast-iron it cannot be forged\r\nor welded.\r\n\r\nNext comes wrought-iron, which is quite soft, can be hammered out flat\r\nor drawn out in the form of a wire and can be welded, but fusible only\r\nat a high temperature. Third comes steel, the most wonderful thing we\r\nproduce with iron. It is also malleable, which means that it is capable\r\nof being hammered out flat and can easily be welded, and this is the\r\ngreat property of steel--it acquires when tempered a very high degree\r\nof hardness, so that a sharp edge can be put on it, and when in that\r\nshape it will easily cut wrought-iron. Ordinarily we make wrought-iron\r\nand steel from iron that has been changed from its original state to\r\ncast-iron.\r\n\r\nThe term cast-iron is generally given to iron which has been melted and\r\ncast in any form desired for use. Stoves are made in this way. The iron\r\nis melted and then poured into a mold; while the product out of which\r\nwrought-iron and steel are made is technically cast-iron, the term\r\npig-iron is used in speaking of iron which is cast for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe process by which pig-iron is changed into wrought-iron is called\r\n_puddling_. The object of puddling, which is done in what is called a\r\nreverberatory furnace (which is a furnace that reflects or drives back\r\nthe flame or heat) is to remove the carbon which is in the pig-iron.\r\nThis is done partly by the action of the oxygen of the air at high\r\ntemperature and partly by the action of the cinder formed by the\r\nburning furnace. When this has been done the iron is made into balls of\r\na size convenient for handling. These are “shingled” by squeezing or\r\nhammering and passed between rolls by which the iron is made to assume\r\nany desired form.\r\n\r\nNow we come to steel, the most wonderful product or form in which we\r\ntake advantage of the value of iron. Steel was formerly made from\r\nwrought-iron, so that you first had to get cast-iron, from which\r\nyou made wrought-iron, and eventually got steel by changing the\r\nwrought-iron. Now we make steel direct from pig-iron. This is known as\r\nthe Bessemer process.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable feature in the chemical composition of the\r\ndifferent grades of iron and steel is found in the percentages of\r\ncarbon they contain. Pig-iron contains the most carbon; steel the next\r\nlowest, and wrought-iron the least.\r\n\r\nIron has been known to men from early historical times. The smelting\r\nof iron ores is not any indication of advanced civilization either.\r\nSavage tribes in many parts of the world practiced the art of smelting,\r\neven before they could have learned it from people who had become\r\ncivilized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is Gold Called Precious?\r\n\r\n\r\nGold is called one of the precious metals because of its beautiful\r\ncolor, its luster, and the fact that it does not rust or tarnish when\r\nexposed to the air. It is the most ductile (can be stretched out into\r\nthe thinnest wire), and is also the most malleable (can be hammered\r\nout into the thinnest sheet). It can be hammered into leaves so thin\r\nthat light will pass through them. Pure gold is so soft that it cannot\r\nbe used in that form in making gold coins or in making jewelry. Other\r\nsubstances, generally copper, are added to it to make the gold coins\r\nand jewelry hard. Sometimes silver is also added to the gold with\r\ncopper. The gold coins of the United States are made of nine parts of\r\ngold to one of copper. The coins of France are the same, while the\r\ncoins of England are made of eleven parts of gold to one of copper.\r\nThe gold used for jewels and watch-cases varies from eight or nine to\r\neighteen carats fine.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why gold is called a precious metal is that it is very\r\ndifficult to dissolve it. None of the acids alone will dissolve gold,\r\nand only two of them when mixed together will do so. These are nitric\r\nacid and hydrochloric acid. When these two acids are mixed and gold put\r\ninto the mixture the gold will disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Do We Mean By 18-Carat Fine?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe often hear people in speaking of their watches say, “It is an\r\n18-carat case.” Others speak of 14-carat watches or 22-carat or\r\nsolid-gold rings.\r\n\r\nWhen you see the marks on a watch-case or the inside of a gold ring\r\nthey read 18 K or 14 K, or whatever number of carats the maker wishes\r\nto indicate. A piece of gold jewelry marked 18 K or 18 carats means\r\nthat it is three-fourths pure gold. In arranging this basis of marking\r\nthings made of gold, absolutely pure gold is called 24 carats. Then if\r\ntwo, six or ten twenty-fourths of alloy has been added, the amount of\r\nthe alloy is deducted from twenty-four, and the result is either 22, 18\r\nor 14 carats fine, and so on. On ordinary articles made by jewelers the\r\namount of pure gold used is seldom over 18 carats, or three-fourths.\r\nWeddings rings (and these are considered solid gold) are generally made\r\n22 carats fine, that is, there are only two twenty-fourth parts of\r\nalloy in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Silver Tarnish?\r\n\r\n\r\nSilver is a remarkably white metal, which is associated with gold as\r\none of the precious metals. It is harder than gold and will not rust,\r\nalthough it will tarnish, which gold will not, when exposed to certain\r\nkinds of air.\r\n\r\nThe silver tarnishes when it is exposed to any kind of air that has\r\nsulphur mixed in it. It ranks below gold as a precious metal for use in\r\nmaking ornaments and is not so costly, because there is a great deal\r\nmore of it to be found in the world.\r\n\r\nWhile silver is somewhat harder than gold, it is still not sufficiently\r\nhard to use pure for making coins, so, as in the case of the gold\r\ncoins, it is mixed with something else--copper--to harden it. Otherwise\r\nour dimes and quarters would wear out too rapidly. Our silver coins are\r\nmade of nine parts of silver to one of copper. The coins of France are\r\nin the same proportion, while the silver coins of England are made of\r\n92¹⁄₂ parts of silver to 7¹⁄₂ parts of copper. German silver coins are\r\nmade of three parts of silver and one of copper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Use Copper Telegraph Wires?\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristics which distinguishes copper is its color--a\r\npeculiar red. It stands next to gold and silver in ductility and\r\nmalleability, and comes next to iron and steel in tenacity--which\r\nmeans the ability of its tiny particles to hang on to each other.\r\nThat is why copper wire bends instead of breaking when you twist\r\nit. But that is not the only reason, although an important part of\r\nthe reason, why we use copper for telegraph wires. Copper is an\r\nextremely good conductor of electricity when it is pure. So are gold\r\nand silver, but we cannot afford to buy gold and silver wires for the\r\ntelegraph, telephone and other wires, and if we used such wires the\r\ncost of the equipment would be so great that we could not afford to\r\nhave telephones in our homes. But there is a great deal of copper in\r\nthe world and it is very cheap, and so it makes an ideal element for\r\nuse in things through which electricity is to pass. When you compound\r\nit with other substances it loses some of its conductivity. Copper\r\nis used extensively in many ways in the world. This book is printed,\r\nfor instance, from copper electrotype plates. The whole business of\r\nelectrotyping is based on the use of copper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is Lead So Heavy?\r\n\r\n\r\nLead is a white metal and is noted for its softness and durability. It\r\nhas a luster when freshly cut, but becomes dull quite soon after the\r\nfreshly-cut surface is exposed to the air. Lead is the softest metal in\r\ngeneral use. It can be cut with an ordinary knife. It can be rolled out\r\ninto thin sheets, but cannot be drawn out into wire.\r\n\r\nLead is a very dense metal, that is, its particles are very compact\r\nand there is no room for air to circulate in between these particles.\r\nA piece of wood is lighter than a piece of lead of exactly equal bulk,\r\nbecause the little particles which make up the piece of wood are not\r\nvery close together, and there is a lot of air in the ordinary piece of\r\nwood, while this is not true of the lead.\r\n\r\nA great deal of lead is used in making pipes for plumbing. This is\r\nbecause lead pipe is comparatively cheap, although you might not think\r\nso when you think of the general conclusions we have been brought to\r\nform about plumbers and everything connected with them. Lead pipe is\r\neasily bent in any direction also, and is particularly good for use in\r\nplumbing for that reason.\r\n\r\nAnother wide use of lead is in making paints--white lead being the base\r\nused in making oil paints. The process of making white lead for paint\r\nis quite interesting and pictures of it are shown in “The Story In a\r\nCan of Paint” in another part of “The Book of Wonders.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Cooking Utensils Made of Tin?\r\n\r\n\r\nTin is the least important of the six useful metals. It is also\r\ninferior in many ways to the others in this group of elements, but is\r\ntougher than lead and will make a better wire, though not a really good\r\none. It has a whiteness and a luster that are not tarnished by ordinary\r\ntemperature and is cheap. That is why it is used in making cooking\r\nutensils, pans, etc., and for roofs. But the pans, roofs, etc., are not\r\npure tin. They are thin sheets of iron coated with tin. Pure tin would\r\nnot be strong enough for these purposes, so a sheet of iron is first\r\ntaken to supply the strength and then covered with tin to improve the\r\nappearance of the tin pans and keep them from rusting rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Gravitation?\r\n\r\n\r\nGravitation is the result of the attraction which every body, no matter\r\nwhat its size, has for every other body. It is a strange force and\r\ndifficult to explain in plain words. It is what keeps the heavenly\r\nbodies in their paths. Every one of the planets is held in its path\r\nby gravitation and every object on each of the planets is kept on the\r\nplanet by gravitation. We can come nearer understanding gravitation by\r\nstudying the effect of the attraction of gravitation on our own earth\r\nand the objects on it. When you throw a ball or a stone into the air\r\nit is the attraction of gravitation that causes it to come back. If\r\nthis were not so the stone would go on up and up and would keep on\r\ngoing forever. If it were not for this wonderful force you could jump\r\ninto the air and just keep on going up with nothing to bring you back.\r\nThe reason you do not pull the earth toward you is because the body or\r\nmass with the greater bulk has always the greater pulling power.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful force. It cannot be produced nor can it be\r\ndestroyed or lessened. It just is. It acts between all pairs of\r\nbodies. If other bodies come between any pair of bodies the attraction\r\nof gravity between the two outside bodies is neither lessened or\r\nincreased, and yet each of the outside bodies will have an independent\r\nattraction or pull on the body which is in between.\r\n\r\nNo particle of time is spent by the transmission of the force of\r\ngravity from one body to another, no matter how far apart they may be.\r\nThe only effect that distance has on the attraction of gravitation is\r\nto lessen its force. Any body which is being pulled through gravity\r\ntoward another body would fall toward the center of the attracting body\r\nif all the force of attraction from all other bodies were removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Specific Gravity?\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity is the ratio of weight of a given bulk of any\r\nsubstance to that of a standard substance. The substances taken as\r\nthe standard for solids and liquids is water, and air or hydrogen for\r\ngases. Since the weights of different bodies are in proportion to their\r\nmasses, it follows that the specific gravity of any body is the same\r\nas its density, and we now generally use the term “density” instead of\r\nspecific gravity.\r\n\r\nTo find, for instance, the specific gravity of a given bulk of silver,\r\nwe must take an equal bulk of water and weigh it. Then we also weigh\r\nthe silver. We find that the silver weighs ten and a half times as much\r\nas the water, and so the specific gravity of silver is 10.5. If you\r\nwill bear in mind that water is the standard used for measuring the\r\nspecific gravity of solids and liquids, and that air or hydrogen are\r\nused as standards for the gases, you will always know what the figures\r\nafter the words specific gravity mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We See Stars When Hit On the Eye?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not really see stars, of course, when we are hit on the eye or\r\nwhen we fall in such a way as to bump the front of our heads. What we\r\ndo see, or think we see, is light.\r\n\r\nTo understand this we must go back to the explanation of the five\r\nsenses--sight, hearing, feeling, tasting and touching. Now, each of\r\nthese senses has a special set of nerves through which the sensations\r\nreceived by each of the senses is communicated to the brain and, as\r\na rule, these special nerves receive no sensations excepting those\r\nwhich occur in their own particular field of usefulness. The eye then\r\nhas nerves of vision; the nose, nerves of smell; the ear, nerves of\r\nhearing; the mouth, nerves of taste, and the entire body nerves of\r\ntouch. As we have seen then, these special nerves are susceptible of\r\nreceiving impressions or sensations only in their particular field.\r\nBut, if you should be able to rouse the nerves of smell in an entirely\r\nartificial way and give them a sensation, they might easily act very\r\nmuch as though they smelled something. We find this often in the nerves\r\nof touch when we think we feel something when we do not.\r\n\r\nNow, when some one hits you in the eye, the nerves of vision are\r\ndisturbed in such a way as to produce upon the brain the sensation of\r\nseeing light. In other words, you cannot affect the eye nerves without\r\ncausing the sensation of light, and that is just what happens when some\r\none hits you in the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “ARGONAUT, JUNIOR.”\r\n\r\nExperimental Boat, 1894.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “ARGONAUT THE FIRST.”\r\n\r\nBuilt 1896-1897.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Submarine Boat\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Can a Ship Sail Under Water?\r\n\r\nUp to a few years ago the stories we could tell about the ships that\r\nsail beneath the water were the creations of the minds of writers of\r\nfiction, like the author of “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,”\r\nbut to-day we can read of many actual trips beneath the water by the\r\nbrave men who man our submarines. We never dreamed that the great story\r\nof Jules Verne would be realized in the little but very destructive\r\nships of war which can be seen to-day in the naval ports of the nations\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nWe might have had these submarines long ago but for the fact that the\r\nmen who were trying to invent them would not give up the secrets which\r\nthey had discovered. Many men in different parts of the world worked on\r\nthis problem and each discovered one or more things which were valuable\r\nin working out a solution, and if they had all gotten together and\r\ncompared notes between them they could have produced a submarine boat\r\nalmost as good as those we have to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does the Submarine Get Down Under the Surface?\r\n\r\nThe first essential in a vessel to enable it to navigate below the\r\nsurface of the water is that it be made sufficiently strong to\r\nwithstand the surrounding pressure of water, which increases at the\r\nrate of .43 of a pound for each foot of submergence.\r\n\r\nA boat navigating at a depth of 100 feet would therefore have 43 pounds\r\npressure per square inch of surface, or 6192 pounds for every square\r\nfoot of surface. It will readily be seen, therefore, that the first\r\nessential is great strength. Therefore, the submarine boats are usually\r\nbuilt circular in cross section with steel plating riveted to heavy\r\nframing, as that is the best form to resist external pressure. These\r\nboats are built for surface navigation as well, therefore they have a\r\ncertain amount of buoyancy when navigating on the surface, the same as\r\nan ordinary surface vessel. When it is desired to submerge the vessel\r\nthis buoyancy must be destroyed, so that the vessel will sink under the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nNow, the submerged displacement of a submarine vessel is its total\r\nvolume, and, theoretically, a vessel may be put in equilibrium with the\r\nwater which it displaces by admitting water ballast into compartments\r\ncontained within the hull of the vessel, therefore, if a vessel whose\r\ntotal displacement submerged was 100 tons, the vessel and contents must\r\nweigh also 100 tons. If it weighed one ounce more than 100 tons it\r\nwould sink to the bottom. If it weighed one ounce less than 100 tons it\r\nwould float on the surface with a buoyancy of one ounce. If it weighed\r\nexactly 100 tons it would be in what submarine designers specify as\r\nbeing “in perfect equilibrium.”\r\n\r\nIt is possible to give a vessel a slight negative buoyancy to cause\r\nher to sink to, say, a depth of 50 feet and then pump out sufficient\r\nwater to give her a perfect equilibrium, and thus cause her to remain\r\nat a fixed depth while at rest. In practice, however, this is seldom\r\ndone. Most submarine boats navigate under the water with a positive\r\nbuoyancy of from 200 to 1000 pounds and are either steered at the depth\r\ndesired by a horizontal rudder placed in the stern of the vessel, or\r\nare held to the depth by hydroplanes, which hydroplanes correspond to\r\nthe fins of a fish. They are flat, plane surfaces, extending out from\r\neither side of the vessel, and when the vessel has headway, if the\r\nforward ends of these planes are inclined downward, the resistance of\r\nthe water acting upon the planes is sufficient to overcome the reserve\r\nof buoyancy and holds the vessel to the desired depth. If the vessel’s\r\npropeller is stopped, the boat, having positive buoyancy, will come to\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nBy manipulating either the stern rudders or the hydroplanes, the vessel\r\nmay be readily caused to either come nearer to the surface or go to\r\na greater depth, as the change of angle will give a greater or less\r\ndownpull to overcome the reserve of buoyancy.\r\n\r\nThe above description applies to navigating a vessel when between the\r\nsurface of the water and the bottom.\r\n\r\nAnother type of vessel which is used for searching the bottom in\r\nlocating wrecks, obtaining pearls, sponges, or shellfish, is provided\r\nwith wheels. In this type of vessel the boat is given a slight negative\r\nbuoyancy, sufficient to keep it on the bottom, and it is then propelled\r\nover the water bed on wheels, the same as an automobile is propelled\r\nabout the streets. This type of vessel is also provided with a diver’s\r\ncompartment, which is a compartment with a door opening outward from\r\nthe bottom. If the operators in the boat wish to inspect the bottom,\r\nthey go into this compartment and turn compressed air into the\r\ncompartment until the air pressure equals the water pressure outside\r\nof the boat; i. e., if they were submerged at a depth of 100 feet they\r\nwould introduce an air pressure of 43 pounds per square inch into the\r\ndiving compartment. The door could then be opened and no water could\r\ncome into the compartment, as the diving compartment would be virtually\r\na diving bell. Divers can then readily leave the boat by putting on a\r\ndiving suit and stepping out upon the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE FIRST PRACTICAL SUBMARINES\r\n\r\n“PROTECTOR.” BUILT 1901-1902, BRIDGEPORT, CONN.\r\n\r\nThis was the pioneer Submarine Torpedo Boat of the level-keel type, and\r\nwas built in Bridgeport in 1901-1902.

The steersman is\r\nshown just forward of the commanding officer and steers the vessel by\r\ncompass under the direction of the commanding officer, the same as when\r\nnavigating above the surface. In the larger type boats the steersman\r\nalso has a periscope which enables him to see what is going on above\r\nthe surface. Below decks two of the crew are shown loading a torpedo\r\ninto the torpedo tube; each torpedo is charged with gun-cotton and\r\nwill run under its own power over a mile and will explode on striking\r\nthe enemy. The crew live in the compartment aft of the torpedo room.\r\nAft of this is the engine room, in which are located powerful internal\r\ncombustion engines for running on the surface and electric motors for\r\nrunning submerged. The electric motors are driven by storage batteries\r\nlocated under the living quarters. Wheels are shown housed in the keel,\r\nwhich may be lowered for navigating on the bottom in shallow water.\r\nA diving compartment in the bow permits divers to leave the vessel\r\nwhen on the bottom, to search for and cut or repair cables or to plant\r\nmines.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SUBMARINE SAILING CLOSE TO THE SURFACE\r\n\r\nA submarine running partly submerged with the conning tower hatch\r\nopen, showing the remarkable steadiness of this type of boat in\r\na semi-submerged condition, a thing no other craft could safely\r\naccomplish.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Another submarine running entirely submerged, periscope\r\nonly showing. The flag is attached to top of periscope to show her\r\nposition in maneuvers when periscope goes entirely under water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN WITH THE PERISCOPE UNIVERSAL LENS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ALL-SEEING EYE FOR THE SUBMARINE\r\n\r\nVision under water is limited to but a few yards at best, and hence\r\na submarine boat, when submerged, would be as blind as a ship in a\r\ndense fog and would have to grope its way along guided only by chart\r\nand compass, were it not for a device known as a periscope, that\r\nreaches upward and projects out of the water, enabling the steersman\r\nto view his surroundings from the surface. Of course the height of the\r\nperiscope limits the depth at which the craft may be safely sailed. Nor\r\ncan the periscope tube be extended indefinitely, because the submarine\r\nmust be capable of diving under a vessel when occasion demands. But\r\nwhen operating just under the surface, where it can see without being\r\nseen, the craft is in far greater danger of collision than vessels\r\non the surface, because it must depend upon its own alertness and\r\nagility to keep out of the way of other boats. The latter can hardly be\r\nexpected to notice the inconspicuous periscope tube projecting from the\r\nwater in time to turn their great bulks out of the danger course.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing article describes the type of periscope now in common\r\nuse on submarines and one of the engravings on this page clearly\r\nillustrates the principles of the instrument. A serious defect of this\r\ntype of instrument is that the field of vision is too limited. The man\r\nat the wheel is able to see under normal conditions only that which\r\nlies immediately before the boat. It is true that he can turn the\r\nperiscope about so as to look in other directions, but this, of course,\r\ninvolves considerable inconvenience. On at least two occasions has a\r\nsubmarine boat been run down by a vessel coming up behind it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n~SEEING IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE~\r\n\r\nAs long as the submarine has but a single eye it would seem quite\r\nessential to make this eye all-seeing; and since the two lamentable\r\naccidents just referred to, an inventor in England has devised a\r\nperiscope which provides a view in all directions at the same time.\r\nThis has been attempted before, but it has been found very difficult\r\nto obtain an annular lens mirror which would project the image down\r\nthe periscope tube without distortion. The accompanying illustrations\r\nshow how this difficulty has now been overcome. While we will not\r\nattempt to enter into a mathematical explanation of the precise form\r\nof the mirror lens, it will suffice to state that it is an annular\r\nprism. The prism is a zonal section of a sphere with a conoidal central\r\nopening and a slightly concave base. All the surfaces, however, are\r\ngenerated by arcs of circles owing to the mechanical inconvenience\r\nof producing truly hyperboloidal surfaces. The lens mirror is shown\r\nin section at _A_ in Fig. 1. The arrows indicate roughly the course\r\nof the rays into the lens and their reflection from the surface _B_,\r\nwhich is preferably silvered. The tube is provided with two objectives\r\n_C_ and _D_ (Fig. 3) between which a condenser _E_ is interposed at\r\nthe image plane of the lens _C_. At the bottom of the periscope tube\r\nthe rays are reflected by means of a prism _F_ into the eyepiece. Two\r\neyepieces are employed. One of lower power, _G_, is a Kelner eyepiece,\r\nthe purpose of which is to permit inspection of the whole image, while\r\na high-powered eccentrically placed Huyghenian eyepiece, _H_, enables\r\none to inspect portions of the image. The two eyepieces are mounted in\r\na rectilinear chamber, _I_, which may be rotated about the prism at\r\nthe end of the periscope, thus bringing one or other of the eyepieces\r\ninto active position. The plan view, Fig. 4, shows in full lines the\r\nhigh-powered eyepiece in operative position, while the dotted lines\r\nindicate the parts moved about to bring the low-powered eyepiece into\r\nuse. A small catch, _J_, shown in Fig. 2, serves to hold the chamber in\r\neither of these two positions. The high-powered eyepiece is mounted on\r\na plate, _K_, which may be rotated to bring the eyepiece into position\r\nfor inspecting any desired portions of the annular image. The parts\r\nare so arranged that when the eyepiece is in its uppermost position,\r\nas indicated by full lines in Fig. 2, the observer can see that which\r\nis directly in front of the submarine, and when the eyepiece is in its\r\nlow position, as indicated by dotted lines, he sees objects to the\r\nrear of the submarine. With the eyepiece at the right or at the left\r\nhe sees objects at the right or left, respectively, of the submarine.\r\nThe high-powered eyepiece is slightly inclined, so that the image may\r\nbe viewed normally and to equal advantage in all parts. Mounted above\r\na plain unsilvered portion of the mirror is a scale of degrees which\r\nappears just outside of the annular image. A scale is also engraved on\r\nthe plate _K_ with a fixed pointer on the chamber, making it possible\r\nto locate the position of any object and rotate the plate _K_ so as\r\nto bring the eyepiece _H_ on it. The scale also makes it possible to\r\nlocate the object with respect to the boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW WE LOOK THROUGH A PERISCOPE\r\n\r\nTHE PERISCOPE TOP.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERISCOPE IN GENERAL USE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNIVERSAL OBSERVATION LENS.]\r\n\r\nThis improved periscope is applicable not only to submarine boats but\r\nfor other purposes as well, such as photographic land surface work, in\r\nwhich the entire surroundings may be recorded in a single photograph.\r\nThe accompanying photograph, taken through a periscope of this type,\r\nshows the advantages of this arrangement and gives an idea of its value\r\nto the submarine observer when using the low-powered eyepiece. Of\r\ncourse, by using the other eyepiece any particular part of the view may\r\nbe enlarged and examined in detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSIDE OF A MINE-PLANTING SUBMARINE\r\n\r\nMINE-PLANTING SUBMERSIBLE.\r\n\r\nA Lake type vessel designed for planting contact mines. In naval\r\nwarfare it is sometimes of advantage to plant mines, either to defend\r\nharbors, or in some cases the mines are planted in the course of the\r\napproaching enemy. This is a vessel designed for that purpose. The\r\nenemy is seen approaching, and the mine-planting submarine runs in\r\nahead of them in a submerged condition and drops a number of contact\r\nmines on their course; the enemy strikes the mine and is blown up. A\r\nnumber of vessels were blown up by contact mines of this type in the\r\nRussian-Japanese war.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidents and Their Causes.\r\n\r\nThe accidents which submarine vessels must guard against are as\r\nfollows: collision, foundering, explosions and asphyxiation. The\r\nfirst danger is, however, no greater than those to which vessels that\r\nrun entirely on the surface of the water are exposed. The eye of the\r\nsubmarine places the commander on a practical level with the commander\r\nof other vessels, so that if a collision occurs it is due to the same\r\nlack of watchfulness which causes collisions on the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe submarine boat is less liable to founder than an ordinary vessel,\r\nbecause she is built to withstand a greater pressure of water than\r\nother kinds of vessels. Of course, if a submarine springs a leak, she\r\nis in grave danger of sinking to the bottom, and there is less chance\r\nof the crew being rescued from a submarine, because no one but those on\r\nboard know of the danger if the boat is under the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Explosions May Occur.\r\n\r\nIn submarine vessels explosions may occur either through a collection\r\nof gases from the batteries or by reason of leaks in the pipes or\r\ntanks of the fuel supply system, or through the bursting of the air\r\nflasks belonging to the boat, or the air reservoirs in the automobile\r\ntorpedoes. The greatest danger is from explosive gases and have been\r\nthe cause of all explosions in modern submarine craft, and the greatest\r\ndanger in this connection is the liability of a leak in the gasolene\r\npipes or tanks. This gas is a heavy gas and so goes to the bottom of\r\nthe vessel, where it is not so easily detected as a gas which rises.\r\nThere is no certain way of guarding against leaks of gasolene. A leak\r\nmay occur at any time in a pipe or tank of gasolene through some cause\r\nor other no matter how carefully inspected, and the gas from this is\r\nso active that it will go through the tiniest hole imaginable--even\r\nthrough a hole which water will not penetrate. The crew of a submarine\r\nis always subject to this danger unless the tanks are built outside the\r\nhull of the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the Air May Become Poisoned.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant danger of asphyxiation to the men in the submarine.\r\nA very small leakage of gas or the exhaust from an internal combustion\r\nengine may make the air so impure that those aboard will be overcome. A\r\ngreat deal of care must be taken to keep the air pure and to warn the\r\ncrew at the first sign of danger from this.\r\n\r\nWhen submarines first came into practical use, it was found a good idea\r\nto take a number of little white mice down with the vessel to warn all\r\nif the air began to become impure. As soon as this occurred, the mice\r\nbecame distressed and squealed as loudly as they could, thus warning\r\nthose aboard the ship of danger. The mice felt the impurity of the air\r\nquicker than the men, not because they had any special gift to discover\r\nwhen the air was bad, but because they breathe much more quickly than\r\nman--take shorter and many more breaths.\r\n\r\nNow, however, a chemical device has been invented which is affected in\r\nsuch a way as to ring a loud bell, if the air in the vessel becomes\r\nimpure to such an extent that there is any danger.\r\n\r\nBreathing the same air over and over may fill the vessel with carbonic\r\nacid gas. There should be no great danger from this, however, as\r\nsubmarines are now built sufficiently large to provide enough actually\r\npure air for each man aboard for forty-eight hours, and it is hardly\r\nconceivable that a submarine need be submerged more than half that\r\nlength of time under any conditions.\r\n\r\nOf course, then, too, there is the danger of accident due to\r\ncarelessness or ignorance. In other words, it is just as difficult to\r\nmake a fool-proof submarine as a fool-proof anything else. Wherever\r\nanything is constantly dependent upon the continuous careful attention\r\nof human beings, there is constant danger of accident, whether it be on\r\nboard a submarine, a railroad train, steamship or in connection with\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SUBMARINE UNDER THE ICE\r\n\r\nUNDER-ICE SUBMARINE TORPEDO BOAT.\r\n\r\nSubmarine designed to navigate submerged under the ice, in ice-bound\r\ncountries. Vessels of this type could enter harbors and destroy the\r\nenemy’s shipping at will. A vessel of this type would also be of value\r\nin transporting mails, passengers and cargoes between ice-bound ports\r\nwhere navigation by surface vessels is closed for several months in the\r\nyear.]\r\n\r\n\r\nStory of How the Submarine Has Been Developed.\r\n\r\nIt is only within the past twenty years that man has been able to\r\nsuccessfully navigate under the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n~WHO MADE THE FIRST SUBMARINE BOAT?~\r\n\r\nIt has been a dream of inventors and engineers for the past three\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of King James I. a crude submarine vessel was built of\r\nwood, and was designed to be propelled by oars extending out through\r\nholes in the side of the vessel, the water being prevented from coming\r\nin through the openings by goat skins tied about the oars and nailed\r\nto the sides of the boat, which made a water-tight joint, but at the\r\nsame time gave flexibility to the oars, so that by feathering them on\r\nthe return stroke they could be manipulated to give head motion. Very\r\nlittle, if any, success could have attended this effort.\r\n\r\nNearly a hundred years later a man by the name of Day built a submarine\r\nand made a wager that he could descend to 100 yards and remain there\r\n24 hours. He built a boat and submerged it in a place where there was\r\na depth of 100 yards. He succeeded in remaining the 24 hours, and\r\naccording to latest advices is still there, as he never returned to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThere is very little information as to the construction of these early\r\ncraft. The first really serious attempt at submarine navigation was\r\nmade by a Connecticut man, a Dr. David Bushnell, who lived at Saybrook\r\nduring the Revolutionary War. He built a small submarine vessel which\r\nhe called the “American Turtle,” and with it he expected to destroy the\r\nBritish fleet, anchored off New York during its occupation by General\r\nWashington and the Continental Army.\r\n\r\nThatcher’s Military Journal gives a description of this vessel and\r\ndescribes an attempt to sink the British frigate “Eagle” of 64 guns\r\nby attaching a torpedo to the bottom of the ship by means of a screw\r\nmanipulated from the interior of this submarine vessel.\r\n\r\nA sergeant who operated the “Turtle” succeeded in getting under the\r\nBritish vessel, but the screw which was to hold the torpedo in place\r\ncame in contact with an iron scrap, refused to enter, and the implement\r\nof destruction floated down stream, where its clockwork mechanism\r\nfinally caused it to explode, throwing a column of water high in the\r\nair and creating consternation among the shipping in the harbor.\r\nSkippers were so badly frightened that they slipped their cables and\r\nwent down to Sandy Hook. General Washington complimented Dr. Bushnell\r\non having so nearly accomplished the destruction of the frigate.\r\n\r\nIf the performance of Bushnell’s “Turtle” was such as described, it\r\nseems strange that our new government did not immediately take up\r\nhis ideas and make an appropriation for further experiments in the\r\nsame line. When the attack was made on the “Eagle,” Dr. Bushnell’s\r\nbrother, who was to have manned the craft, was sick, and a sergeant who\r\nundertook the task was not sufficiently acquainted with the operation\r\nto succeed in attaching the torpedo to the bottom of the frigate. Had\r\nhe succeeded the “Eagle” would undoubtedly have been destroyed and the\r\nevent would have added the name of another “hero” to history and might\r\nthen have changed the entire art of naval warfare. Instead of Bushnell\r\nbeing encouraged in his plans, however, they were bitterly opposed by\r\nthe naval authorities. His treatment was such as finally to compel him\r\nto leave the country, but he returned after some years of wandering,\r\nand under an assumed name, settled in Georgia, where he spent his\r\nremaining days practicing his profession.\r\n\r\nRobert Fulton, the man whose genius made steam navigation a success,\r\nwas the next to turn his attention to submarine boats, and submarine\r\nwarfare by submerged mines. A large part of his life was devoted to\r\nthe solution of this problem. He went to France with his project and\r\ninterested Napoleon Bonaparte, who became his patron and who was the\r\nmeans of securing sufficient funds to build a boat which was called\r\nthe “Nautilus.” With this vessel Fulton made numerous descents, and\r\nit is reported that he covered 500 yards in a submerged run of seven\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n~HOW SUBMARINES WERE DEVELOPED~\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1801 he took the “Nautilus” to Brest, and experimented\r\nwith her for some time. He and three companions descended in the harbor\r\nto a depth of 25 feet and remained one hour, but he found the hull\r\nwould not stand the pressure of a greater depth. They were in total\r\ndarkness during the whole time, but afterward he fitted his craft with\r\na glass window 1¹⁄₂ inches in diameter, through which he could see to\r\ncount the minutes on his watch. He also discovered during his trials\r\nthat the mariner’s compass pointed equally as true under water as above\r\nit. His experiments led him to believe that he could build a submarine\r\nvessel with which he could swim under the surface and destroy any\r\nman-of-war afloat. When he came before the French Admiralty, however,\r\nhe was met with blunt refusal, one bluff old French admiral saying:\r\n“Thank God, France still fights her battles on the surface, not beneath\r\nit,” a sentiment which apparently has changed since those days, as\r\nFrance now has a large fleet of submarines. After several years of\r\nunsuccessful efforts in France to get his plans adopted, Fulton finally\r\nwent over to England and interested William Pitt, then chancellor,\r\nin his schemes. He built a boat there, and succeeded in attaching a\r\ntorpedo beneath a condemned brig provided for the purpose, blowing her\r\nup in the presence of an immense throng. Pitt induced Fulton to sell\r\nhis boat to the English government and not bring it to the attention of\r\nany other nation, thus recognizing the fact that if this type of vessel\r\nshould be made entirely successful, England would lose her supremacy as\r\nthe “Mistress of the Seas.”\r\n\r\nFulton consented to do so, but would not pledge himself regarding his\r\nown country, stating that if his country should become engaged in war,\r\nno pledge could be given that would prevent him from offering his\r\nservices in any way which would be for its benefit.\r\n\r\nThe English Government paid him $75,000 for this concession. Fulton\r\nthen returned to New York and built the “Clermont” and other\r\nsteamboats, but did not entirely give up his ideas of submarine\r\nnavigation, and at the time of his death was at work on plans for a\r\nmuch larger boat.\r\n\r\nFulton had a true conception of the result of submarine warfare, and in\r\na letter he says: “Gunpowder has within the last three hundred years\r\ntotally changed the art of war, and all my reflections have led me to\r\nbelieve that this application of it will, in a few years, put a stop\r\nto maritime wars, give that liberty on the seas which has been long\r\nand anxiously desired by every good man, and secure to Americans that\r\nliberty of commerce, tranquillity, and independence which will enable\r\ncitizens to apply their mental and corporeal facilities to useful and\r\nhumane pursuits, to the improvement of our country and the happiness of\r\nthe whole people.”\r\n\r\nAfter Fulton’s death spasmodic attempts were made by various inventors\r\nlooking to the solving of the difficult problem, but no very serious\r\nefforts were put forth until the period of the Civil War, and then a\r\nnumber of submarine boats were built by the Confederates. These boats\r\nwere commonly called “Davids,” and it was one of them that sank the\r\nUnited States steamship “Housatonic” in Charleston Harbor on the night\r\nof the 17th of February, 1864. This submarine vessel drowned four\r\ndifferent crews, a total of thirty men, during her brief career. At the\r\ntime she sank the “Housatonic” her attack was anticipated, and sharp\r\nlookout was kept at all times; but, notwithstanding their vigilance,\r\nshe succeeded in getting sufficiently close to plant a torpedo on the\r\nend of a spar, and sink this fine, new ship of 1400 tons displacement.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above description that these vessels, while\r\nable to go under water, were not controllable.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War several other inventors took up the problem of\r\ntrying to design a submarine vessel that could be controlled as to\r\nmaintenance of depth and direction under water.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Gustave Zede, Goubet and Drzwiezki, and in this country Mr.\r\nBaker and Mr. John P. Holland, built experimental vessels.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Mr. Holland built a small boat which was called the “Fenian\r\nRam.” It is stated that this vessel was built with capital furnished by\r\nthe “Clan-na-Gael,” with the idea of using it against the British fleet\r\nin an attempt to free Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhile some slight success was met with by these inventors, it was not\r\nuntil about 1897 that any real progress was made.\r\n\r\n~THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL SUBMARINE WITH HYDROPLANES~\r\n\r\nIn 1893, Simon Lake, an American inventor, submitted plans to the\r\nUnited States Naval authorities at Washington for a submarine boat that\r\nwould navigate between the surface and the bottom by the use of what\r\nhe called “hydroplanes,” which were designed to cause the vessel to\r\nsubmerge on an even keel. Mr. Lake’s design of vessel was also provided\r\nwith wheels to enable it to navigate on the water bed. It was also\r\nprovided with a diving compartment to enable the crew to don diving\r\nsuits and leave the vessel, in working on wrecks, cutting cables,\r\nplanting mines, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 and 1905 he built a small vessel to demonstrate his principles\r\nand succeeded in successfully navigating the vessel on the bottom\r\nof New York Bay. He then built a larger vessel of about 50 tons\r\ndisplacement for further experimental purposes. This vessel was called\r\nthe “Argonaut,” and was built in Baltimore in 1906 and 1907. This boat\r\nwas successful from the start and covered thousands of miles in the\r\nChesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic Coast, New York Bay and Long\r\nIsland Sound, and was the first successful submarine boat to navigate\r\nin the open sea and on the water bed of the ocean.\r\n\r\nMr. Holland had, in 1894, received a contract for a submarine vessel\r\nfor the United States Navy, and her construction was started in 1895.\r\nThis vessel was called the “Plunger.” This was the first official\r\nrecognition given to a submarine boat in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Government of France had also given an order for a submarine boat\r\nwhich was under construction at this period.\r\n\r\nThe “Plunger” was never submerged, her construction covering a period\r\nof several years, and she was finally abandoned. Mr. Holland had,\r\nhowever, in the meantime prepared the designs of another vessel which\r\nhe called “The Holland.” This vessel was accepted by the United States\r\nGovernment in 1900, and a number of other vessels of this type were\r\nbuilt. These vessels were known as submarines of the diving type. They\r\nwere controlled by means of a horizontal and vertical rudder placed at\r\nthe stern of the vessel and the boat was, by means of these rudders,\r\ninclined down by the bow, and driven under the water by the force of\r\ntheir screw propeller.\r\n\r\nEngland also built a number of submarines of the diving type.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Mr. Lake brought out a larger vessel of his type, which was\r\ncontrolled by hydroplanes, which vessel was sold to the Russian\r\nGovernment, was shipped across the Atlantic to Kronstadt, and from\r\nthere by rail to Vladivostok, and was in commission off Vladivostok\r\njust before the close of the Russian-Japanese War.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake then received orders from the Russian and other Governments\r\nfor a number of additional boats of the even keel type, to be\r\ncontrolled by hydroplanes.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake’s principles of control have been now generally adopted by all\r\nGovernments, as providing the safest and most reliable means of control\r\nof the vessel when navigating under the surface.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government has recently adopted this type to be\r\nbuilt in their Navy Yards, and most other builders have adopted the\r\nhydroplanes as the means of maintaining depth when running beneath the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLEARING A CHANNEL OF BUOYANT MINES\r\n\r\nThis is one of the services to which submarine boats of this type lend\r\nthemselves with peculiar fitness. It is possible for them to carry on\r\nthis work with deliberation and to success, under the very guns and\r\nsearchlights of a vigilant foe, without the slightest danger of being\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nThis would be accomplished preferably by the co-operation of two boats.\r\nThey would take opposite sides in the channel, with a connecting rope\r\nextending out through the diving compartment. It is obvious that as\r\nthey move along the rope will sweep the whole mine-field and gather in\r\nthe connecting cables. This would be indicated at once to the operators\r\nin the diving compartment by the load upon the sweeping line. A grapple\r\nmay then be attached to the rope and sent out of one boat and hauled\r\ninto the other, and thus drag the mine so near that a diver could go\r\nout and destroy its electrical connections or cut it adrift. Should\r\nthe latter operation be the aim, the grapple may be so fashioned as\r\nto accomplish this without the diver leaving the compartment. This\r\nlatter method is one strongly recommended by some of the most prominent\r\nmilitary authorities on submarine defense.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This picture indicates the manner in which the boats\r\nhave traveled many miles over all kinds of bottom. In the present\r\ninstance the boat is shown systematically searching the bottom with\r\nher diving door open and strong lights being used to facilitate a more\r\nperfect examination.\r\n\r\nThere is no trim or equilibrium to maintain. When the propelling\r\nmachinery stops the boat comes to rest. A cyclometer attached to\r\nthese wheels gives a fairly reliable reading of the distance traveled\r\nunder normal circumstances. As the currents do not carry her out of\r\nher course, and as her gauges give an absolute record of changing\r\ndepths, it is possible to so navigate upon the bottom with remarkable\r\nprecision. In shallow waters this method has many advantages.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MACHINE WHICH MAKES THE DIVER’S TASK EASY\r\n\r\nSHOWING TUBE HANDLING CARGO IN SUNKEN SHIP.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovering Cargo or Submerged Objects Without the Aid of Divers.\r\n\r\nThe operating tube is here shown within the body of a hulk and\r\nco-operating with the lifting derrick on the surface craft in the\r\nremoval of the submerged cargo. A grab-dredge bucket of well-known\r\nconstruction is used, the jaws of which, when being lowered by one\r\nrope, open, and when strain is brought on the lifting rope, the\r\njaws close. The working end of the tube is placed in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of the cargo to be lifted and, as the grab is being\r\nlowered from the boat above, the operator in the compartment controls\r\nthe grab by means of the guide line shown attached to the small derrick\r\nboom, and leads it directly over the cargo to be lifted. The grab is\r\nthen dropped and the signal sent to the vessel above to hoist. The\r\nmoment the lifting line tautens the bucket grasps a load and fills\r\nitself with material in the manner common to this type of dredge. This\r\nmethod of directing intelligently and deliberately the dredge bucket\r\nmay be applied as well to the removal of rock or any other obstruction\r\nor to any of those various services of kindred character familiar\r\nto submarine engineers. The great and prime advantage of the system\r\nis the fact that no divers are required, and the work is under the\r\nperfect control of an operator subject only to atmospheric pressure. In\r\nconsequence, therefore, the only limit to the effective operating of\r\nthis apparatus is the length of the tube, and, as has been said, this\r\ncan be made long enough to reach depths denied to the diver simply by\r\ninterposing additional sections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIFE ABOARD A SUBMARINE\r\n\r\nLIVING QUARTERS ABOARD A SUBMARINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Do Sponges Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil within comparatively recent years, the sponge was regarded as\r\na plant; it is now known to belong to the animal kingdom, and to the\r\norder spongida of the class of rhizopoda. Sponge is an elastic, porous\r\nsubstance, formed of interlaced horny fibers, which produce by their\r\nnumerous inosculations, a rude sort of network, with meshes or pores\r\nof unequal sizes, and usually of a square or angulated shape. Besides\r\nthese pores there are some circular holes of large size scattered\r\nover the surface of most sponges, which lead into sinuous canals that\r\npermeate their interior in every direction. The oscula, canals, and\r\npores, communicate freely together. The characteristic property of the\r\nsponge is the facility with which it absorbs a large quantity of any\r\nfluid, more especially of water, which is retained amid the meshes\r\nuntil forced out again by a sufficient degree of compression, when the\r\nsponge returns to its former bulk. From this peculiarity, combined with\r\nits pleasant softness, arises the value of the sponge for the purposes\r\nto which it is applied. In domestic economy and in surgical practice,\r\nthere is no other product that can be satisfactorily substituted for it.\r\n\r\nSponge is an aquatic production, indigenous to almost every sea and\r\nshore. It is abundant and varied between the tropics, but becomes\r\nless so in temperate latitudes and continues to diminish in quantity,\r\nvariety, and size, as it is traced into European and colder seas, until\r\nit almost disappears in the vicinity of the polar circles. Some sponges\r\nare known to be hermaphrodite, but that the individual at one period\r\nproduces chiefly male elements, and later, chiefly female elements.\r\nFertilization takes place in the body of the mother, and the egg here\r\nundergoes its early development. The embryo eventually bursts the\r\nmaternal tissue and, passing into one of the canals, is caught by the\r\ncurrent sweeping through the canal system and is discharged into the\r\nsurrounding water through one of the large apertures on the surface\r\nof the sponge. In the Bahama Islands and along the coast of Florida,\r\nthe breeding time of many sponges covers the period from mid-summer on\r\nthrough early Autumn.\r\n\r\nThere is propagation sometimes by ciliated gemmules, yellowish and\r\noval, arising from the sarcode mass, and carried out by the currents.\r\nThese are mostly formed in the spring, and after swimming freely about\r\nfor a time, become fixed and grow. In its natural state, the sponge\r\nis a very different looking object from the article of commerce. The\r\nentire surface is covered with a thin, slimy skin, usually of a dark\r\ncolor, and perforated to correspond with the apertures of the canals.\r\nThe sponge of commerce is in reality only the home or the skeleton of\r\nthe sponge.\r\n\r\nThere are a few sponges that inhabit ponds and sluggish rivers; the\r\nothers are marine. Of these, many of the calcareous and siliceous kinds\r\ninhabit the shores between tide-marks, preferring a site near the low\r\nebb, where, nevertheless, they are daily alternately submerged, and\r\nleft exposed to the atmosphere. The figured sponges with a fibrous\r\ntexture, to whatever genus they belong, are denizens of deeper water,\r\nand are never left uncovered. They grow usually in groups, on rock\r\nshells, shellfish, corallines, and seaweeds, and either have no power\r\nof selection, or the quality of the site is indifferent to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do Sponges Grow?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their growth, some sponges assume a determinate figure or at least\r\none whose variations are confined within certain limits. The greater\r\nnumber are irregular and variable, their shape depending in a great\r\nmeasure upon the peculiarities of their state, to which they easily\r\naccommodate themselves. They will incrust a shell, or a crab, a rock,\r\nor seaweed, following every projection and sinuosity. The offshoots\r\nwill spring up with a more luxuriant growth in the deeper sheltered\r\nplaces until the original shape of the foundation they grow upon is\r\nlost to sight.\r\n\r\nSponges are unmoving and inirritable. They never remain rooted to the\r\nplaces of the germination, and are incapable either of contracting or\r\ndilating themselves or even of moving any fiber or portion of their\r\nmass. The functions which distinguish them as living beings are few,\r\nand faintly imaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do Sponges Eat?\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough sponges lack the power of motion possessed by most animals,\r\nbeing nearly always attached, in one position or another, to some\r\nobject, the study of their habits in captivity brings out many of their\r\nanimal characteristics in a striking manner. Small specimens taken\r\nfrom the sea and placed in dishes of salt water may be kept alive for\r\nseveral hours if well cared for; and by using finely powdered coloring\r\nmatter, such as carmine or indigo, the manner of their feeding may be\r\nreadily observed. Sponges are more active in fresh sea water than in\r\nstale; they cannot be kept alive out of water and soon die if exposed\r\nto the air. Being unable to go in search of food, as a natural result,\r\nthey can grow only in places where there is always an abundance of\r\nfood suited to their wants. The great sponging grounds of the world\r\nare wholly confined within waters having a relatively high temperature\r\nduring the entire year. The Old World sponges grow principally in\r\nthe Mediterranean and the Red seas; the New World sponges are found\r\nabout the Bahamas, southern and western Florida, and parts of the West\r\nIndies. The finest sponges come from the East, but one of the American\r\nspecies, the so-called “sheep’s wool,” stands high in favor.\r\n\r\nThe commercial sponges are separated into six species, three of which\r\nare European and three American. They are all referred to a single\r\ngenus called spongia, and though having much in common as regards\r\nstructure, their texture varies to such an extent as to make them of\r\nvery unequal value for domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Old World species may be arranged as follows, in order of their\r\ngrade of excellence, beginning with the best quality: The Turkey cup\r\nsponge, Levant toilet sponge, the horse, honey comb, or bath sponge,\r\nand the Zimoca sponge. The American species include the sheep’s wool\r\nsponge, the yellow glove, violet, and grass, sponges. A very close\r\nrelationship exists between the species of the two continents.\r\n\r\nAll known regions in which useful specimens abound contribute to the\r\nworld’s supply. The trade is extensive. The demands upon the fisheries\r\nare great. In the Mediterranean, the fishing is carried on in some\r\nplaces at a depth of forty fathoms. Divers, naked, or in armor, go down\r\nto the bottom and tear off the sponges from their places of growth. In\r\nsome places drag dredges are employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are Sponges Caught?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past quarter-century the sponge-fishery of the Florida coast has\r\ngrown remarkably. Its headquarters is at Key West and several hundred\r\nsailing vessels are engaged in the industry. The fishing appliances\r\nconsist of a small boat, a long hook, and a waterglass. The hook is\r\nin reality a three-pronged spear attached to a pole thirty-five feet\r\nlong. In searching for sponge the fishers row about in the small\r\nboat. By holding the glass on the surface of the water the bottom is\r\nplainly seen and small objects are readily discerned. When a sponge is\r\nsighted the pole with the hook attached is shot down and the product\r\ndeftly gathered. The boat-load is brought to the deck of the schooner,\r\nallowed to remain there a few hours, and then is carried down into the\r\nhold. On Friday nights, the fishing generally ends for the week, and\r\nthe vessel sails for some spot on the neighboring coast where there\r\nare established crawls, or places for curing the catch. These crawls\r\nare about 8 x 10 feet square, their purpose being to hold the sponges\r\nwhile maceration and decomposition take place. The resulting refuse is\r\ncarried off by the tide.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen go away for another catch and the sponges are left in the\r\ncrawls until the end of the following week when a new cargo is brought\r\nin. The returning fishermen beat the decomposed sponges with clubs,\r\nremoving the impurities. The water is squeezed out, then the sponges\r\nare allowed to dry on the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter drying, the hold of the large vessel is loaded to the utmost\r\nwith the product and the voyage to Key West is made. Buyers from New\r\nYork look over the sponges, and make offers for entire cargoes. The\r\nfishermen dispose of their goods rapidly and sail away for more. The\r\nbuyers store the sponges in some dry building, and cause them to be\r\nbleached by lime. A popular manner of bleaching is to wash the sponges\r\nthoroughly in water, and then to immerse them in diluted hydrochloric\r\nacid to dissolve any of the calcareous substance. Having again been\r\nwashed they are placed in another bath of dilute hydrochloric acid to\r\nwhich six per cent. of hyposulphite of soda, dissolved in a little warm\r\nwater, has been added. In this bath the sponges remain for twenty-four\r\nhours, or until the bleaching process is completed. After bleaching,\r\nthe sponges are pressed until their bulk is greatly reduced; they are\r\nthen baled, and shipped to New York, which is the distributing point\r\nfor the entire Florida product.\r\n\r\nSponges are by far the most important fishery products of Florida,\r\nrepresenting about one-third of the annual value of the fishing\r\nindustry. In 1899, the yield was over 350,000 pounds of sponges of\r\nwhich the first value was nearly $400,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Yeast Make Bread Rise?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of sugar in the dough from which bread is made. Sugar\r\ncontains three things--carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. When sugar is\r\nfermented it amounts practically to burning it. To make good bread\r\nfrom the dough it is necessary to ferment the sugar which is in the\r\ningredients from which it is made. Yeast, which is a simple living\r\nplant, has the power to ferment sugar. When sugar ferments, two things\r\nare produced. One thing is the formation of carbonic acid gas. A great\r\ndeal of this carbonic acid gas is caught in the dough in the form of\r\nlarge or small bubbles and some of it escapes into the air. The other\r\npart tries to escape into the air also but cannot, and causes the dough\r\nto rise, which makes the bread light, as we say. The holes you see in\r\nthe bread after it is baked are the little pockets where the carbonic\r\nacid gas was retained in the dough. These bubbles of gas all through\r\nthe dough act like a lot of little balloons and lift the dough up with\r\nthemselves as they try to get to the top and escape into the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Yeast?\r\n\r\n\r\nYeast is a living plant that is used for the purpose of causing\r\nfermentation. The yeast we use in baking bread is an artificial\r\nyeast--really a dough made of flour and a little common yeast and made\r\ninto small cakes and dried. If kept free from moisture it retains the\r\npower of causing fermentation for some time. The flour and other matter\r\nin a cake of yeast are only used to keep the yeast in a form where it\r\ncan be preserved. It is necessary to add water to start fermentation\r\nand that is why we add hot water when we stir in the yeast for a baking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs a Moth Attracted By a Light?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a strange contradiction of the nature of living things\r\nthat a moth should fly deliberately into a light or dash itself to\r\ndeath against the glass surrounding a strong light. This is contrary\r\nto the usual law of nature which gives the living thing an instinct to\r\nprotect itself against enemies.\r\n\r\nFor a long time we thought that moths did not deliberately burn\r\nthemselves up by flying right into a light, but our naturalists\r\nhave proven that not only moths but certain birds, bees, flies and\r\nbutterflies, burn themselves up by flying into the flame of a light or\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW MAN LEARNED TO MAKE A FIRE\r\n\r\nSAWING\r\n\r\nThis was probably man’s first method of producing fire. By rubbing two\r\nsticks together in this way sufficient heat was produced to set fire to\r\neasily burnable material such as dried grass, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRILLING\r\n\r\nAn improvement came when man learned that by twirling a dry stick in\r\na hole in another piece of dry wood the fire could be started more\r\nquickly.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Man Discovered Fire\r\n\r\n\r\nFire was probably one of man’s first, if not the first, great\r\ndiscoveries, and has been one of his greatest servants as well as\r\none of his greatest dangers. We do not know who discovered fire, or\r\nwhat nation first used it. It is, however, one of the signs that\r\ndistinguishes man from the other animals. Not any of the lower animals\r\nwas acquainted with the use of fire, while probably the earliest races\r\nof mankind seem to have been acquainted with it.\r\n\r\nMythology tells us wonderful stories of the origin of fire: according\r\nto these tales it was stolen from the sun, or the gods, and given to\r\nman; and Pandora, the first woman, was sent down to earth to punish man\r\nfor his theft.\r\n\r\nThe most popular of these stories is the legend of Prometheus.\r\nAccording to this legend, fire, in the early days, was under the\r\nexclusive control of the gods. Prometheus, brother of Atlas, the god\r\nwho supported the world on his shoulders, determined that the use of\r\nfire should be given to the people. He decided by some means to send\r\na spark of fire to the earth, believing that one spark caught by man\r\nwould start a burning flame that would never go out.\r\n\r\nWith this idea in mind, Prometheus visited Zeus, the great ruler, to\r\ncarry out his purpose, for Zeus controlled fire. While Zeus was not\r\nlooking, Prometheus “stole some brands of fire from the hearth, which\r\nhe hid in the stalk of a fennel and sent it down to the earth.” Through\r\nthis Prometheus gave to man his first knowledge of fire.\r\n\r\nBut while this story of fire may or may not be true, the use of fire\r\nrests entirely with man and his ingenuity. Through his ingenuity man\r\nwas able to subject fire to his will; making it perform certain of his\r\nlabors; and to a certain extent making it his servant; although it\r\nalways did and always will get beyond his control at times.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors were not satisfied with preserving the fire which the\r\ngods gave them; they tried and succeeded in producing it. One day one\r\nof them discovered that by rubbing two sticks together rapidly, the\r\nfriction would create a fire. It was a most useful discovery. Before\r\nlong the whole of mankind had learned this trick; others improved on\r\nthis crude method until step by step men learned that by striking two\r\npieces of flint or other hard mineral together, quicker action was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRILLING WITH BOW STRING\r\n\r\nMan’s ingenuity soon taught him that if he tied one end of a string to\r\nsomething and wrapped it around his drilling stick, one end of which\r\nwas in a hole as in the first drilling picture, he could increase the\r\nrapidity of making fire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRILLING WITH HELP\r\n\r\nWith some other to hold the drilling stick while he operated the string\r\nhe was able to produce fire more quickly than he had ever done before.]\r\n\r\nAll kinds of methods were devised to increase knowledge of producing\r\nfire. The early Greeks found out how to catch the rays of the sun on a\r\nburning-glass and produce fire; the Romans achieved the same results\r\nthrough the use of mirrors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLOWING\r\n\r\nThis is another method man used for rubbing two pieces of wood\r\ntogether. In following this plan he usually used one stick of bamboo\r\nand rubbed it back and forth in a slot he had made in another piece of\r\nbamboo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLINT AND PYRITES\r\n\r\nIn some places it was discovered that if you struck a piece of hard\r\nstone, like flint, against another, a spark was produced which could be\r\ncaught on a bunch of dry grass or moss and so start a fire.]\r\n\r\nIn about A.D. 900, an Arab, named Bechel, discovered phosphorus, but it\r\ntook almost 800 years more for Haukwitz to learn that when phosphorus\r\nwas brought into friction with sulphur, fire would result. In another\r\nhundred years the world was benefited by the invention of the friction\r\nmatch--and since that time about one-half the people have been carrying\r\nmatches about with them, able thus to start a fire easily any time.\r\n\r\n~FIRE A MARK OF CIVILIZATION~\r\n\r\nFire and man’s knowledge of it have had much to do with man’s progress\r\nin civilization. Before man had fire, his life and movements were much\r\nlike those of other animals. When man had learned to make a fire he was\r\nfree to move and live anywhere and, therefore, people began to cover\r\nmore territory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLINT AND STEEL METHOD OF MAKING FIRE\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF THE FLINT AND STEEL METHOD\r\n\r\nBecause fire was so important to him, man kept on trying to make this\r\ntask easier. He finally contrived a tinder box when iron and steel\r\nbecame known. The tinder box is where he kept his flint and the piece\r\nof steel which he struck upon the flint. He also kept in the box pieces\r\nof cloth or paper on which he caught the sparks so produced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PISTOL TINDER BOX\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of a tinder box in the form of a pistol. It enabled\r\nman to produce sparks in greater numbers and more rapidly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRODUCING SPARK WITH FLINT AND STEEL\r\n\r\nThis shows the method for striking the piece of steel against the flint\r\nto make the sparks fall on the cloth or paper in the box.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COMPLETE TINDER BOX SET\r\n\r\nThis picture shows a very complete tinder box set used by the wealthy\r\npeople in the old days. A man carried this outfit with him just as\r\ntoday he carries matches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This tinder box set is very neat and compact. It is said\r\nstill to be used among the Himalayan tribes where it was discovered.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST MATCHES\r\n\r\nTHE OXYMURIATE MATCH\r\n\r\nThis match, the first, was introduced in 1505. It was a slip of wood\r\ntipped with a chemical mixture. To light it it was necessary to stick\r\nits head into a bottle containing acid.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROMETHEAN MATCH\r\n\r\nThis was a paper cigarette dipped in a mixture of sugar and potash.\r\nRolled within the paper was a tiny glass bulb filled with sulphuric\r\nacid. To light the match you pressed the bulb with pincers hard enough\r\nto break the bulb. This released the acid which set fire to the paper.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Would We Do Without Matches?\r\n\r\nIf one were to ask the man in the street what invention of the\r\nnineteenth century is his most constant and invaluable ally he might be\r\nmystified for the moment, but the undoubted answer would surely come\r\nin the single word “Matches.” These familiar objects, apart from their\r\nluxurious use by smokers, are the indispensable servants of mankind\r\nfrom the moment of rising in the morning till the household is wrapped\r\nin sleep, and it is to them we turn when disturbed in the hours of\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST LUCIFER MATCH\r\n\r\nInvented by John Walker in 1827. It consisted of a stick of wood tipped\r\nwith sulphur and then with a chlorate mixture. To ignite it the match\r\nwas drawn rapidly through a folded piece of sandpaper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN SAFETY MATCH\r\n\r\nThe first practical match was made less than a century ago.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt “familiarity breeds contempt,” and it is difficult to imagine\r\nhow man would fare, bereft of his box of matches. It might help the\r\nworld to realize how much it owes to the inventors of the Lucifer\r\nMatch, were it possible to cut off the supply of these magic fire\r\nproducers for only one brief day. It requires no very vivid imagination\r\nto picture the consternation and confusion that such a step would\r\nproduce, and there is a grim humor in wondering how the primitive\r\nmethods of obtaining a light would serve the public convenience in\r\nthese days of strenuous hustle.\r\n\r\nSeeing that fire has been employed by man since prehistoric days, one\r\nwould expect that easy means of obtaining it would have been devised\r\nin the early ages. We find, however, that until the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century nothing in the nature of a match was available, and\r\nthe crudest methods were still in use. We know from Virgil that in the\r\nreign of the Emperor Titus fire was obtained by rubbing decayed wood\r\nwith a roll of sulphur between two stones, but it is not till Saxon\r\ntimes that we have evidence of the use of the tinder box with its flint\r\nand steel. That this latter was still regarded as something remarkable,\r\nas late as the fifteenth century, is proved by its representation in\r\nthe collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, which was founded in\r\n1429. Burning glasses had, of course, been employed from the most\r\nprimitive times, but one can imagine the despair of an early Briton who\r\nhad to wait for a sunny day before he could boil his kettle.\r\n\r\nIncredible as it may seem, it was not a time well within the memory\r\nof many people living to-day that matches in anything approaching\r\nthe form now familiar were offered to the public. The way for their\r\nmanufacture had been prepared by two discoveries; one by a German who\r\nisolated phosphorus in 1669; the other by a Frenchman who produced\r\nchlorate of potash in 1786. From this latter date the production of\r\nfire was much facilitated, and a few years before Queen Victoria came\r\nto the throne, John Walker--a chemist of Stockton-on-Tees--produced the\r\nfirst friction matches of which there is any certain record. These,\r\ncalled “Congreves,” were sold in boxes of fifty for 2/6, and their\r\nsuccess soon led others to experiment in match manufacture, so that\r\nimprovements were rapidly invented and factories sprang up in all parts\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nIt would be a difficult task to compute accurately the value to the\r\nhuman race of the introduction to general use of this little article.\r\nAt the present writing, in America the consumption of matches amounts\r\nto over a billion of matches a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Matches Are Made.\r\n\r\nTo-day matches are in such demand that the ingenuity of man has devised\r\na machine which makes complete matches without the help of the human\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAt the very start of operations a man feeds blocks of wood into the\r\njaws of the machine, and thenceforth the mechanical monster does its\r\nown work. Seizing the block from the man’s hand, the machine grips it\r\nbetween rollers and forces it against rows of keen-edged cutters, which\r\nare so arranged that there is little or no waste. Each of these cutters\r\n(and there are usually forty-eight in a machine) severs a piece of wood\r\nof exact size and shape. At the same moment a plate rises from beneath,\r\nwhich thrusts these little pieces of wood into a moving flexible\r\ncast-iron band, or rather into small holes in this band, from which the\r\nembryo matches project like bristles. This traveling band is about 700\r\nfeet in length, and follows a serpentine course in its journey, which\r\noccupies about an hour from start to finish, the speed being regulated\r\naccording to temperature so that the matches may be quite dry when they\r\nreach the boxes.\r\n\r\nWhen the band arrives at the finishing point, a steel bar punches out\r\nthe matches stuck in its surface and they fall into the inside boxes\r\nplaced ready to catch them. These boxes are kept continually shaking,\r\nto that no spaces are left and the matches fill them completely. As the\r\ninside boxes fill, a steel arm presses them forward into their covers,\r\nand they are passed along a trough in dozens, quickly wrapped in paper\r\nand sealed by a machine. Quick-fingered girls then wrap twelve of these\r\ndozen packages and we have the gross packages of boxes so familiar in\r\nthe stores. It will be seen, that in spite of the marvellous machines\r\nwhich do so much, there is still plenty of work for human hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Match Boxes Are Made.\r\n\r\nThe machines for making the wooden box which contain the matches are\r\nin themselves wonderful. First, a section of the trunk of an aspen\r\ntree, about 30 inches in length, is made to revolve in what is known\r\nas a peeling machine. After a few revolutions the rough outer surface\r\nis removed, and thin rolls of smooth-surfaced wood are peeled off\r\nor veneered. The machine at the same time scores the wood ready for\r\nfolding by the boxmaking machine. Cut into skillets, i. e., into pieces\r\nof the size required for box covers or insides, the ends are next\r\ndipped in pink dye to cover the edge of the wood which is not covered\r\nby the label. The skillets then go to the box machines, which fold and\r\nlabel them, and after half an hour in a cleverly devised drying chamber\r\nthey are ready for use. In one room alone sixty machines are labelling\r\nand folding the skillets to the number of several thousand gross a day.\r\nTo see these machines take a strip of wood, push it forward to receive\r\nthe pasted label, fold it, fasten the joint, wipe off the superfluous\r\npaste, and, finally, toss the finished “outside” into a receiving\r\nbasket, is as fascinating an example of mechanical ingenuity as the\r\nindustrial world can afford.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre Matches Poisonous?\r\n\r\nA non-poisonous “strike anywhere” safety match, made from selected,\r\nclear, strong cork pine is now made in this country, and is the first\r\nsatisfactory non-poisonous match. It is also the first match to be\r\nendorsed by the country’s recognized leaders and authorities in fire\r\nprevention and the conservation of human life and property.\r\n\r\nThe Hughes-Esch Anti-White Phosphorus Match Bill, which became a\r\nlaw during the administration of President Taft, was drafted by the\r\nattorneys of the American Association of Labor Legislation, and is\r\nthe most drastic that our National Constitution will permit. It would\r\nbe unconstitutional to absolutely prohibit the manufacture of white\r\nphosphorus matches, but the Hughes-Esch bill obtains the same result,\r\nviz.: absolute prohibition by means of excessive taxation. No match\r\nmanufacturer in these days of keen competition can afford to pay a tax\r\nof ten cents on each box of white phosphorus matches made, and place\r\nhis factory under government surveillance, for this tax of ten cents is\r\nover three times as much as his present selling price to the wholesale\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nAs soon as man learned to make fire and light, he began to appreciate\r\nhow much more comfortable he could be if he could keep his lights\r\nburning and to have his light independent of his fire, because it was\r\nat times very uncomfortable to sit by a fire on a hot night simply\r\nbecause he wished to use the light which it made. The first schemes\r\ndevised for lighting purposes merely were the camp-fire torch and the\r\nrushlight. With these as a basis, man was enabled to fashion more\r\nconvenient forms of lighting. He invented the candle and the lamp, and\r\ngrown “enlightened,” boxed his light in iron and in other metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid Candles Come Before Lamps?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe candle is in appearance a primitive affair, yet there is little\r\ndoubt that its predecessor was the lamp. Those old Egyptian tombs,\r\nwhich have unlocked many mysteries, held lamps, and through them\r\nevidence of ancient burial customs. Lamps played a part in the solemn\r\nfeasts of the Egyptians, who on such occasions placed them before their\r\nhouses, burning them throughout the night. Herodotus, in one of his\r\nnumerous references to Xerxes, alludes to the hour of lamp-lighting,\r\nand evidences abound regarding the use of lamps among the ancient\r\nGreeks. Lamps, indeed, are pictured upon some of their oldest vases,\r\nindicating the symbolic significance which attached to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A French watch tower of the fifteenth century in time\r\nof siege. The tower is lighted by means of beacons and is protected by\r\ndogs. Ruins of such a tower can still be seen at Godesberger on the\r\nRhine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Were the Earliest Lamps?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the earliest lamps were nothing more than\r\nconvenient vessels, filled with oil and fired by means of rushes. Among\r\nthe Romans pine splinters, the torch and the flambeau, supplied light\r\nuntil the fifth century before Christ, and even when the Roman began to\r\nuse the lamp, it was by no means common, finding a place only in the\r\nhomes of the rich, or on special festival days.\r\n\r\nThe custom of burning funeral lights beside the dead before interment\r\nis a very old one. Gregory, interpreting its significance for the\r\nChristian, says that departed souls, having walked here as the children\r\nof light, now walk with God in the light of the living. The Roman,\r\nPliny, refers to the use of the pith of brittle rushes in making\r\nfuneral lights and watch-candles, which were probably the ancient\r\nprototype of the old rushlight of England. Again, in speaking of flax,\r\nPliny states that the part of the reed that is nearest to the outer\r\nskin is called tow, and is good for nothing but to make lamp-matches or\r\ncandlewicks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Were the Lamps of the Wise and Foolish Maidens Made Of?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen lamps had come into general favor, better attention was given\r\nto their form and construction. The first seem to have been made of\r\nbaked clay, moulded by hand into elongated vessels to contain the oil,\r\nand provided at one end with a lip to admit the wick. These are the\r\nlamps which artists have pictured in the hands of the wise and foolish\r\nvirgins, though in the opinion of some scholars they were merely rods\r\nof porcelain and iron, covered with cloth and steeped in oil. Another\r\nearly type, which was less common, presents a simple disc with an\r\naperture in the centre for the oil, and a hole for the wick, at one or\r\nboth of the sides.\r\n\r\nUnder the Empire, when the light of the lamp had become general, the\r\nbetter ones were made of bronze, ornamented with heads, animals, and\r\nother decorations, attached to the handles, while as life in Rome\r\npartook more of luxury and extravagance, gold, silver, or Corinthian\r\nbrass were the materials, the designs being more elaborate and\r\ncomplicated. Many and beautiful examples of these ancient lamps have\r\nbeen unearthed from the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Were Street Lamps First Used?\r\n\r\n\r\nDark must have been the lives of those people who, until comparatively\r\nrecent times, lived, in the absence of sunlight, by the feeble,\r\nuncertain light of the primitive illuminants borne by these lamps. And\r\nas for street lighting--that was a luxury but seldom indulged in, and\r\nthen, not for public benefit, but to enhance the glory of a potentate,\r\nor grace the obsequies of some great man. Even Rome, at the height of\r\nher luxury and beauty, rarely exhibited more than one or two lanterns\r\nin her streets. These were suspended over the baths and places of\r\npublic resort. Occasionally, however, the streets were illuminated\r\nduring festivals and other public occasions, while the Forum was\r\nsometimes lighted for a midnight exhibition. With these glittering\r\nexceptions, and that memorable one when, to satisfy the homicidal\r\nimpulses of a bad emperor, the bodies of Christians were made living\r\ntorches, Rome was a city of darkness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST STREET LIGHT IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nThe first street light in America. Early in 1795 several large cressets\r\nwere placed on the corners of Boston’s most frequented street.\r\nPine-knots were placed in these fire baskets by the night watchman.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Were Candles Introduced?\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical records indicate the prevalent use of candles in the\r\nearliest days of Rome, but these candles were of the simplest\r\nsort--mere string or rope which had been smeared with pitch or wax.\r\nIn the early Christian centuries it was the custom to dip rushes in\r\npitch and coat them with wax, a method of candle-making that was long\r\ncontinued, for it was not until the fourteenth century that dipped\r\ntallow candles were introduced. In the Middle Ages wax candles provided\r\nthe usual means of illumination, and these were made, not by common\r\ncraftsmen, but by monks, or by the servants of the rich. Until the\r\nfifteenth century their use was confined to churches, monasteries and\r\nthe houses of nobles, but the demand for them had become so great that\r\nthe chandlers of London obtained an act of incorporation. As late as\r\nthe eighteenth century the candles were made by dipping the wicks\r\ninto melted wax or tallow, but about this time an ingenious Frenchman\r\nconceived the idea of casting them in metal moulds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A part of the “Amende Honorable” of Jacques Coeur before\r\nCharles VII of France.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A pagan votive lamp of bronze, now in the museum at\r\nNaples.]\r\n\r\nIt is only within a modern period that the state or city has assumed\r\nresponsibility in the matter of public lighting, which for the most\r\npart had been left to the good will and public spirit of citizens.\r\nBut in England a proclamation was issued to the effect that every\r\nindividual should place a candle in each of the lower windows of his\r\nhouse, and keep it burning from nightfall until midnight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST OIL LANTERN\r\n\r\nThe first “Réverbère”--oil lantern--with a metal reflector, used\r\nto light the streets of Paris. It was invented by Bourgeois de\r\nChâteaublanc in 1765, and used until the introduction of gas.]\r\n\r\nParis was the first city to improve upon this method of street\r\nlighting, and in 1658 huge, vase-like contrivances, filled with resin\r\nand pitch, were set up in the principal thoroughfares. The improvement\r\nproving, as may readily be seen, both dangerous and expensive, the\r\nfalct, so-called, were replaced by the lantern. This was at first\r\nsimply a rude frame, covered with horn or leather, within which a\r\ncandle burned. For more than one hundred years this was the extent of\r\nthe illumination which the authorities could provide. But of course\r\nit was understood that no honest man would venture abroad without his\r\ntorch or flambeau, and as London, Berlin, Vienna, and all leading\r\ncities of Europe, were in like case, the darkness of Paris could be\r\nborne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Argand got his first suggestion for his burner--invented\r\nin 1780--from this style of alcohol lamp, then in general use\r\nthroughout France.]\r\n\r\nBut progress had been made, and early in the eighteenth century the\r\nCorporation of London entered into contract with a certain individual\r\nto set up public lights, giving him permission to exact a sum of six\r\nshillings from every householder whose actual rent exceeded ten pounds.\r\nIn the middle of the same century the Lord Mayor and Common Council\r\napplied to Parliament for power to light the streets of London better.\r\nFrom the granting of this permission dates improvement in public\r\nlighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Did the Word “Gas” Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\nA Belgium chemist, Van Helmont, coined the word “gas” in the first half\r\nof the seventeenth century. The Dutch word “geest,” signifying “ghost,”\r\nsuggested the term to him, and his superstitious neighbors hounded him\r\ninto obscurity for talking of ghosts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hanging lamp from Nushagak in Southern Alaska. It is\r\nsuspended from the framework of the tent by cords. Oils and fats from\r\nnorthern animals give a clear and steady light, and Eskimo lamps are\r\nfrequently praised by travelers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT THE BIG TANK NEAR THE GASWORKS IS FOR\r\n\r\nSIX MILLION CUBIC FOOT GAS HOLDER.\r\n\r\nAlmost every boy and girl has seen the big tank near the gas works, and\r\nmost of them have wondered what was in it and what it is for. This big\r\ntank is a “holder” in which the gas is stored after it is manufactured.\r\n\r\nThe giant holders are reservoirs from which gas is constantly being\r\ntaken and the quantity on storage constantly replenished, as the\r\nordinary gas plant never ceases manufacturing its product.\r\n\r\nThere is little or no danger of an interruption of the supply by reason\r\nof accident, as gas plants are always equipped with duplicate apparatus\r\nfor emergencies.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Illuminating Gas Was Discovered.\r\n\r\nThe first practical demonstration of the value of gas made from\r\ncoal for lighting was made by a Scotchman--Robert Murdock--who in\r\n1797, after some years of experimenting, fitted up an apparatus in\r\nthe workshop of Boulton and Watt, in Birmingham, England, which\r\nsuccessfully lighted a portion of that establishment. The advantages\r\nof this kind of lighting were so apparent that its use was rapidly\r\nextended, although in many instances the people were afraid of it. For\r\na time this kind of lighting was confined to street lights. One of the\r\nfirst great structures to be lighted by gas was Westminster Bridge in\r\nLondon, and great crowds gathered to watch the burning jets nightly. It\r\nwas difficult to remove from the minds of the people the belief that\r\nthe gas-pipes were filled with fire and the jets were only openings\r\nthrough which the flame in the pipes escaped. People sometimes touched\r\nthe pipes expecting to find them hot, and when the pipes were put in\r\nbuildings they made sure that they were placed several feet from the\r\nwalls lest the fire in them set fire to the buildings.\r\n\r\nThe use of illuminating gas for lighting private houses developed quite\r\nslowly because of this fear of the fire in the gas-pipes. This was not\r\nentirely unwarranted, however, because at first the plumbers did not\r\nknow, as they do now, how to prevent leakage of gas from the pipes.\r\nThe methods of joining the pipes were oftentimes imperfect and, not\r\nrealizing the dangers which would follow leaks, causing explosions, the\r\nworkmen were often careless in installing the pipes.\r\n\r\nThe first American house in which gas was used for lighting was the\r\nhome of David Mellville at Newport, R. I. Baltimore, Maryland, was the\r\nfirst American city to use gas for lighting. It was introduced there in\r\n1817.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does Gas Get Into the Gas Jet?\r\n\r\nIf you hold a cool drinking glass over a burning gas jet for a moment,\r\na film of moisture will form on the inside of the glass and remain\r\nuntil the tumbler becomes warm, and then disappear. Now, then, you will\r\nremember that water is a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, and that when\r\nhydrogen is burned in the air, water is formed. It is also true that\r\nwhenever water is formed by burning anything, hydrogen is present in\r\nit. You see, therefore, that the gas used for lighting purposes must\r\ncontain hydrogen.\r\n\r\nLet us now learn something more about what gas is made of. Wet a piece\r\nof glass with a little fresh lime water and hold this over the lighted\r\ngas jet. In a few moments a change takes place in the water. The water\r\nturns somewhat milky. This indicates the presence of carbonic acid gas,\r\nand the formation of carbonic acid gas, when burning is going on, means\r\nthe presence of carbon.\r\n\r\nFrom these two experiments we gather that the gas in the jet contains\r\nhydrogen and carbon. All kinds of illuminating gas contain these two\r\nsubstances. Sometimes there are small quantities of other substances\r\npresent, but the value of gas for lighting depends on hydrogen and\r\ncarbon.\r\n\r\nWe have already learned about hydrogen, but it would be well to\r\nre-learn about carbon.\r\n\r\nCarbon is an element, and an extremely important one, for a large part\r\nof the composition of every living thing is carbon. It is found in\r\nmore compounds than any other element. Almost pure carbon can easily\r\nbe obtained by heating a piece of wood, in a covered utensil, until it\r\nis turned into charcoal. Charcoal, which is black, is composed almost\r\nentirely of carbon. It is a very interesting product in all ways; in\r\nconnection with gas we are particularly interested in the fact that\r\ncarbon will burn when heated in the air or in oxygen.\r\n\r\nCharcoal is very much like hard coal, both being formed in practically\r\nthe same way. Ages of years ago many large forests of trees were buried\r\nunder a layer of soil and rocks, during changes that occurred in the\r\nearth’s surface, and the hot inside earth slowly heated the wood, until\r\nalmost nothing was left but the carbon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE THE GAS IS TAKEN FROM THE COAL\r\n\r\nGENERATOR HOUSE AND 175-FT. STACK.\r\n\r\nIn the process of gas making, coal is placed in the generator and\r\nheated to an incandescent state, then from the top or bottom steam is\r\nadmitted and forced through the heated coal, producing a crude water\r\ngas which is passed on to the carbureter. In this shell enriching oil\r\nis produced, but as the oil and the water gas do not effectually unite,\r\nthey are passed on to the superheater, where, as its name implies, they\r\nare subjected to a high temperature which thoroughly gasifies them into\r\na permanent gas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INTERIOR VIEW OF GENERATOR HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n* Pictures on Gas Manufacture by courtesy of the Consolidated Gas,\r\nElectric Light and Power Co. of Baltimore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUMINATING GAS MUST BE SCRUBBED\r\n\r\nSHAVING SCRUBBERS.\r\n\r\nAfter passing into the scrubbers the gas is cooled, passed into the\r\nscrubbers, and by contact with wooden slat trays, made up like screens;\r\na large portion of the tar is removed from the gas, the tar passing off\r\nto large receptacles.]\r\n\r\nSoft coal was formed in much the same manner, but the process was not\r\nso completely finished. Mixed with the carbon in soft coal we find\r\nquite a good deal of other substances, of which hydrogen forms the\r\nprincipal part. This is what makes soft coal valuable in the making of\r\nilluminating gas.\r\n\r\nWhen soft coal is heated in a closed receptacle a gas is formed which\r\nwill burn. To show this we have only to take an ordinary clay pipe,\r\nput a little piece of coal in the bowl, close the top with wet clay,\r\nand put the bowl part of the pipe in the fire. When it is quite hot, a\r\ngas will be found coming out of the stem of the pipe, which will, when\r\nlighted, burn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story In a Gas Jet.\r\n\r\n~HOW ILLUMINATING GAS IS MADE~\r\n\r\nSoft coal is heated in large tubes of fire clay called retorts, and the\r\ngas that is formed is then collected in a large tank and sent through\r\npipes to our homes after being purified. The part of the coal that is\r\nleft consists largely of carbon and is what we call coke.\r\n\r\nWhile the gas that comes directly from coal will burn if lighted, it is\r\nnot a desirable gas to burn in our homes, because it contains a number\r\nof substances that should be eliminated before it is used for lighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the Gas Is Purified.\r\n\r\nFrom the clay retorts the gas passes through horizontal pipes\r\ncontaining water. This cools it and takes out of it most of the tar\r\nand water vapor that are driven off with the gas when formed. These\r\nsubstances settle in the water. The gas then goes through a series\r\nof curved pipes, which are air cooled. These pipes constitute what\r\nis known as an atmospheric condenser. From these the gas goes into\r\na series of receptacles containing wooden slat trays, made up like\r\nscreens. These receptacles are called the scrubbers, and they take out\r\nof the gas the last traces of tar and some of the other compounds found\r\npresent. The removal of the sulphur is very important, for burning\r\nsulphur gives off a gas which is not only extremely impure to breathe,\r\nbut also injurious to the health.\r\n\r\nFrom the scrubbers the gas goes on through pipes to the purifiers--boxes\r\nwhich contain wood shavings coated with iron rust upon which the sulphur\r\nis deposited by chemical action. At the same time the lime absorbs a\r\nsmall quantity of carbonic acid gas, which is formed with the other\r\ngases. From the purifiers the gas passes into the great iron tanks, in\r\nwhich it is stored until needed.\r\n\r\nThe gas in the tanks consists chiefly of hydrogen, a number of\r\ncompounds of hydrogen and carbon, and a small amount of a compound\r\nof carbon and oxygen containing less oxygen than carbonic acid gas,\r\nknown as carbon monoxide. The hydrogen and carbon monoxide burn with\r\na very pale flame, which gives but little light and much heat. The\r\nlight-giving quality of the gas is found in the compounds of carbon and\r\nhydrogen. When these burn, the particles of carbon are heated white hot\r\nand glow very brightly, making a luminous flame.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, some impurities in the purified gas. These are\r\ncompounds containing sulphur and ammonia. The quantities of these\r\nsubstances, however, are so small that they are harmless; but the\r\ncompounds taken out in the process of purifying the gas are saved, as\r\nconsiderable use is made of them. The water used for washing the gas is\r\nheavily charged with ammonia and is, in fact, the chief source of the\r\nammonia sold by druggists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE IMPURITIES ARE TAKEN FROM THE GAS\r\n\r\nPURIFYING BOXES.\r\n\r\nThe principal impurity to be removed is sulphur, and this is\r\naccomplished by passing the gas through large iron rectangular boxes\r\nfilled with wood shavings coated with iron rust upon which the sulphur\r\nis deposited by chemical action.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATION METER HOUSE, SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF TWO NEW\r\n13-FT. METERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE METER MEASURES THE GAS\r\n\r\nFig 1\r\n\r\nFig 3\r\n\r\nFig. 2.\r\n\r\nFig 4\r\n\r\nGas first enters inlet pipe _A_ (Fig. 3) passing along _A1_ into\r\ncovered valve chamber _B_ up through orifice _O_. It then passes down\r\nthrough two of the valve ports at the same time, ports _C_ and _D1_\r\n(Fig. 2). Before _C1_ (Fig. 3) has gotten to its extreme opening, the\r\nvalve on the opposite side has moved to allow gas to pass down port\r\n_D_. On every quarter turn of tangent _P_, one port is opening to\r\nreceive gas which passes down through the valve ports into the chambers\r\nbelow (see arrows on Fig. 2), which shows the gas passing into chamber\r\n_F_. The pressure being greater on the outside of the diaphragm, forces\r\nthe diaphragm inward and expels the gas from the inside of _D2_ through\r\n_D_ and passes over the cross-bar into the fork channel (see Fig.\r\n1). On the other side gas is passing down through port _D1_ (Fig. 2)\r\nentering diaphragm _D3_, the pressure being greater on the inside of\r\n_D3_ therefore forces the diaphragm outward and expels the gas from\r\nthe outside of diaphragm _D3_; out through port _C1_ into fork channel\r\nsame as shown in (Fig. 1). All exhaust gas from the chambers below\r\nis checked from entering the chamber _B_ by the slide valve _G_ and\r\n_G1_ (Fig. 2). Instead of passing into chamber _B_ it passes over the\r\ncross-bars between _D1E1_ and _C1E1_ into the fork channels, then to\r\noutlet pipe _N_ (Fig. 3) to house pipe.\r\n\r\nNOTE: All gas registered must pass through outlet _N_.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to coal gas made in the way just described, there is\r\nanother form of illuminating gas, in the manufacture of which coal is\r\nindirectly employed. This gas, known as water gas, because it is formed\r\nby the decomposition of water, is produced by passing steam over red\r\nhot carbon, in the form of hard coal or coke. When this is done, the\r\nhydrogen in the steam is set free and the oxygen combines chemically\r\nwith the carbon, to form the carbon monoxide, that was mentioned as\r\nbeing present, in small proportions, in ordinary coal gas. This carbon\r\nmonoxide is poisonous, if much of it is breathed, and as it has no\r\nodor it is difficult to detect when escaping. A number of deaths have\r\nresulted from water gas for this reason, and in some states the laws\r\nforbid its use for lighting purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen water gas is used it must be enriched with some other substances\r\nbefore it will yield much light. You have already learned that neither\r\nhydrogen nor carbon monoxide burns with a bright flame, and you will\r\nsee that water gas must have something added to it to fit it for\r\nlighting purposes. The substance usually added is the vapor of some\r\nlight, volatile oil, like gasoline. This vapor is composed of compounds\r\nof carbon and hydrogen, and when it is mixed with the water gas it\r\nforms a gas that yields a very satisfactory light; and that may be\r\nproduced more cheaply than common coal gas.\r\n\r\nThere remains one more form of illuminating gas which has been the\r\nsubject of much discussion in recent years, namely, acetylene. This is\r\na compound of carbon and hydrogen, in which there is twelve times as\r\nmuch carbon as hydrogen. It has not been discovered recently, for it\r\nwas known early in the nineteenth century, but its possible use for\r\nlighting purposes was not considered then.\r\n\r\nAttention was directed to it a few years ago by the discovery of a\r\nsubstance called calcium carbide. This is a compound of carbon and the\r\nmetal calcium, formed by heating to a very high temperature a mixture\r\nof coal and lime. It has the peculiar property of decomposing, when\r\ntreated with water. The calcium present combines with the oxygen and\r\nhalf the hydrogen of the water, to form common slacked lime or calcium\r\nhydrate, while the carbon and the remainder of the hydrogen combine to\r\nform acetylene gas.\r\n\r\nThe gas formed in this way needs no purifications before burning; it\r\ncan be produced in small generators, and the production can be checked\r\nat any time. When burned in the proper form of burner it yields the\r\nbrightest of all gas flames. For these reasons it is adapted for use in\r\nsmall villages and for lighting single houses. It is also frequently\r\nused in magic lanterns, where a strong and steady light is necessary.\r\nBut the cost of producing acetylene in large quantities is greater than\r\nthat of coal gas, and it seems extremely unlikely that it will ever be\r\nmuch used for lighting large cities and towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the Light Gets Into the Electric Light Bulb.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incandescent lamp was invented in 1879 and the patents were granted\r\nto Thomas A. Edison. There were, however, a number of electrical men\r\nwho were working on the idea at this time who deserve a great deal of\r\ncredit for developing the lamp.\r\n\r\nThe incandescent lamp, which is used chiefly for house lighting,\r\nconsists of a glass bulb from which the air has been exhausted by\r\npumps and chemical processes--in which there is a thin filament of\r\ntungsten metal wound on what is called an arbor (as shown in Fig. 4).\r\nThis filament opposes high resistance to the passage of the current\r\nof electricity, and, consequently, is heated to incandescence when\r\na current passes through it. The removal of the air from the bulb\r\nprevents the tungsten metal from burning up, as it would do if oxygen\r\nwere present.\r\n\r\nThe filaments of the first lamps were made of vegetable fibre. The next\r\ndevelopment was the cellulose process, which is still used in carbon\r\nand metallized lamps, although a number of processes are used now which\r\nimprove the filament considerably.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that tungsten metal could be used in incandescent lamps\r\nwas made in 1906. The first tungsten lamp manufactured in America was\r\nmade in 1907.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVELOPMENT OF INCANDESCENT LAMPS\r\n\r\nEdison’s first lamp with a filament of bamboo fibre.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The carbon lamp--the oldest form of incandescent lamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Standard Mazda lamp--the highest development of the\r\nincandescent lamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Tantalum lamp developed just before the Mazda lamp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Improved Mazda lamp for lighting large areas--the most\r\nefficient lamp ever made.]\r\n\r\nThe filaments of the first tungsten lamps were composed of two or\r\nthree short pieces of wire. In 1910, however, a lamp with a continuous\r\ntungsten filament was invented which increased the strength of the lamp\r\nwonderfully.\r\n\r\nMazda is a trade name given to all metal filament lamps made by the\r\nprominent American lamp manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the Mazda lamp is so much more efficient than the\r\ncarbon filament lamp is because the tungsten filament can be burned at\r\na much higher temperature than the present carbon filament, without\r\nseriously blackening the bulb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does an Arc Light Burn?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the arc light a current of electricity is made to leap across from\r\nthe tip of one rod of carbon to the tip of another that is held a short\r\ndistance from the first. In passing across the current does not follow\r\na straight path, but makes a curve, or arc, whence comes the name “arc\r\nlight.”\r\n\r\nIn this form of light the carbons are not enclosed in a space from\r\nwhich air is excluded, consequently there is some destruction of the\r\ncarbon. The light is due to the fact that the air between the tips of\r\nthe carbon rods opposes a high degree of resistance to the current, so\r\nthat the rods become intensely hot at their tips. The high degree of\r\nheat causes a slow burning of the carbon at the tips, and the small\r\nparticles that burn are heated white hot before they are consumed, thus\r\nproducing light.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the light from an arc light uniform in strength, it is\r\nnecessary to keep the tips of the carbon rods always the same distance\r\napart. This is practically impossible, and, as a result, the arc light\r\ndoes not produce light that is well adapted for reading or for other\r\npurposes that require constant use of the eyes. The light produced by\r\nthe arc light is very powerful, however, and for that reason it is much\r\nused for street lighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are X-Rays?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was discovered by Professor Conrad Roentgen in 1895, that if a\r\ncurrent of electricity be passed through a certain form of glass\r\nbulb, from which most of the air has been exhausted, a disturbance\r\nis produced in the ether that bears some resemblance to light waves.\r\nFor want of a better name to give to a disturbance which was not well\r\nunderstood, Roentgen called his discovery the X-Ray, but it is now\r\nfrequently called in his honor the Roentgen ray. The nature of this\r\ndisturbance is not yet known, but as it does not affect the eye it\r\nis not light. These rays are produced with a glass vacuum tube and a\r\nbattery from which a current of electricity is sent through the tube.\r\nThe wires of the battery are connected with two electrodes, one of\r\nwhich consists of a concave disk of aluminum, and the latter of a\r\nflat disk of platinum. The X-rays are discharged in straight lines as\r\nshown in the figure. The most striking properties of the X-ray is its\r\npower to penetrate many substances that are impermeable to light. All\r\nvegetable substances, and the flesh of animals, are penetrated by it\r\nvery readily. Glass, metals, bones, and mineral substances generally\r\nare opaque to it. Consequently, when a limb, or even the body of an\r\nanimal, is exposed to X-rays they pass through the fleshy parts,\r\nbut are stopped by the bones. Certain substances have the property\r\nof glowing, or becoming fluorescent, when exposed to the X-ray, and\r\nwhen screens of paper are coated with these substances they form a\r\nconvenient means of detecting the presence of X-rays. By holding the\r\nhand between a tube that is giving off X-rays and a screen of this\r\nkind, the bones of the hand will be outlined in shadow on the screen,\r\nand the rest of the surface will glow with a greenish light. If a\r\nbullet or other piece of metal has become imbedded in the body, it may\r\neasily be located, if it is not in a bone, and the extent of an injury\r\nto a bone or a joint may be plainly shown. For this reason the X-ray is\r\nnow widely used by surgeons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Man Learned to Fight Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you see the modern fire engine racing through the streets, gongs\r\nringing, with the firemen hanging on and the police clearing the track,\r\nyou should remember that it has taken man a long time to learn as much\r\nas he has about fighting fire.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did man learn to make fire than he found it necessary to\r\nlearn how to put it out.\r\n\r\nThe first fire apparatus of record is found in Rome. The Gauls burned\r\nthe city in 390 B. C., each citizen was ordered to keep in his house a\r\n“machine for extinguishing fire.” This consisted of a syringe.\r\n\r\nThe first record of an actual machine for putting out fire is by Hero\r\nof Alexandria. This contrivance, a “siphon used in conflagrations,” was\r\nused in Egypt about a hundred and fifty years before Christ.\r\n\r\nThe first record of what we would call a fire department is also found\r\nin Rome. A disastrous fire, occurring in the reign of Augustus called\r\nhis attention to the benefit of a regular fire brigade would bring. So\r\nhe organized a fire department. It consisted of seven companies of a\r\nthousand men each.\r\n\r\nThe first real fire engines were used in 1633 at a big fire on London\r\nBridge. The first fire hose was invented by the two Van der Heydes in\r\n1672. One of the earliest engines used consisted of a tank drawn by two\r\nhorses, which threw a stream an inch in diameter to a height of eighty\r\nfeet. An improved engine was invented in 1721 by Newsham, of London,\r\nand the first engine used in the United States was made by Newsham. The\r\nfirst steam fire engine was invented by John Braithwaite, of London, in\r\n1829.\r\n\r\nFire alarms came into use in medieval times. It was the custom, in many\r\nof the towns to have a watchman stationed on a high building whose duty\r\nit was to look for fires. As soon as he saw one, he gave warning by\r\nblowing a horn, firing a gun, or ringing a bell.\r\n\r\nThe first London fire department consisted of ten men of each ward.\r\n\r\nThe first municipal American fire department was created in Boston in\r\n1678. The fire engine was a hand pump bought in England.\r\n\r\nThe first leather fire hose was made in America in 1808 in\r\nPhiladelphia. Rubber hose was first made in England at about 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did Man Learn to Cook His Food?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primitive man lived on raw food--raw flesh, roots, fruits and nuts.\r\nThere must have been a time when he lived thus because there was a time\r\nwhen he had no fires and no knowledge of how to make a fire. There are\r\nno records, however, to show when man learned that cooked food was best.\r\n\r\nIt must have come about almost simultaneously with his knowledge of\r\nfire, for the art of cooking goes back to the first knowledge of fire.\r\nWe do not know either how man learned to make a fire. The earliest\r\nnations of which we have any record seem to have been acquainted with\r\nfire and certain methods for producing it. Not only one but all early\r\nnations seem to have been possessed of this knowledge. Occasionally\r\ntravellers have reported that people have been found who were\r\nunacquainted with either fire or cooking, but investigation has always\r\nproven these reports unauthentic. Cookery has always been found in\r\npractice where people knew about fire.\r\n\r\nIt is strange how man has lost track of the beginning of his knowledge\r\nof fire and cookery, because fire represents the beginning of man’s\r\nculture and cookery goes hand in hand with it.\r\n\r\nThere are many legendary accounts of how man learned the value of\r\ncooked food, all of which are based upon the accidental burning or\r\nroasting of animals or birds. Perhaps, therefore, Charles Lamb’s “Roast\r\nPig” story, which we read with much laughter in our school readers, was\r\nquite accurate from a historical standpoint. According to the story\r\na man’s house burned and he cried more over the fate of his pet pig\r\nthan about the loss of his house. He kept his pig in the house you will\r\nremember and as soon as the fire died away he rushed into the debris\r\nto look for his pet pig, hoping still to rescue him. He found him in a\r\ncorner and made haste to pick him up and carry him into the open air.\r\nBut the poor pig had been roasted to a turn and was still hot. The\r\nman’s fingers went right into the well done roast pig and were burned.\r\nWith a cry he withdrew his fingers and put them into his mouth to blow\r\non them and thus he secured his first taste of roast pig, which he\r\nfound so much to his taste that he repeated the operation of licking\r\nhis fingers.\r\n\r\nWhile this is but a story, it is quite likely historically correct as\r\nto this discovery of the value of cooked food to some of the early\r\nnations. No doubt Fire and Cookery were developed together.\r\n\r\nWhen man had learned to make fire, he found that it often got beyond\r\nhis control. Here and there he would set the woods on fire quite\r\nwithout intention perhaps, but with damaging results. He would watch\r\nthe conflagration and, when it was passed, he would find the baked\r\nbodies of deer or other animals which had been overcome by the fire\r\nand learned that baked meats were good to the taste and more easily\r\ndigestible than raw meats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Sponge Hold Water?\r\n\r\n\r\nA sponge will hold water because it has, on account of the plan on\r\nwhich it is grown the power of capillary attraction. The sponge is made\r\nup of little hair like tubes. If you take a glass tube, open at both\r\nends and immerse one end in a vessel of water, you will find that the\r\nwater will rise in the tube to a level higher than the surface of the\r\nwater in the vessel. The smaller the hole through the glass tube, the\r\nhigher the water will rise. This is caused by the cohesion of the water\r\nagainst the inside surface of the hole in the tube and causes a pull\r\nupward. The water is pulled up into the tube because the surface of the\r\ntube has a greater cohesive attraction for the water than for the air\r\nwhich was in it and the air is forced out partly. Some liquids, such\r\nas mercury will not rise in the same way, but is depressed in a glass\r\ntube, since it cannot adhere to glass. Mercury however will run or rise\r\nin a tin tube, just as water in a glass tube, because it adheres to the\r\ntin.\r\n\r\nNow a sponge is merely a lot of capillary tubes which have the same\r\npower of pulling up the water as the glass tube. The tubes in a sponge\r\nare so fine that the water will rise to the entire length of the tubes.\r\nIn addition, this adhesive quality of water to the inside of the tubes\r\nin the sponge is so strong, that the sponge can be taken entirely out\r\nof the water and the water will remain in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is the Right Hand Stronger Than the Left?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right hand is stronger than the left only in case you are\r\nright-handed. If you have the habit of being left-handed, your left\r\nhand becomes stronger. If you are truly ambidextrous, your strength\r\nwill be the same in both hands.\r\n\r\nWe get our strength by moving the various parts of the body, i. e., by\r\nusing them. When a little baby stretches his arms and legs and kicks,\r\nhe is only exercising naturally, making the blood circulate.\r\n\r\nYou can prove that the fact that your right hand is stronger than your\r\nleft because of the greater use or exercise you give it, by tying your\r\nright arm close to your side and keeping it in that condition without\r\nusing it for several weeks. When you remove the bands which held it\r\ntight, you will find your arm has lost its strength and that now your\r\nleft hand is stronger. If, however, you are left-handed and tie that\r\nhand down for the same length of time, your right hand would be the\r\nstronger. This shows that the strength we have in our arms and legs,\r\nand other parts of the body, is developed by using them and giving them\r\nrational exercise. Of course, it is possible to over-use a part of\r\nthe body, but you will notice that nature always gives us a warning by\r\nmaking us tired before we come to the point where further use of that\r\nparticular part of the body would cause injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do My Muscles Get Sore When I Play Ball In the Spring?\r\n\r\n\r\nThey do this because you have probably not been exercising the\r\nparticular muscles which you employ in throwing a ball enough in the\r\nwinter to keep you in good condition. Muscles which have been developed\r\nthrough use or work need more work to keep them in condition. In a\r\nsense certain of the muscles which you employ in playing ball have\r\nbeen treated during the winter very much as if you had tied them down,\r\nas we suggested you might do with your arm. You have not been using\r\nthem--they have not been doing enough work, and they begin to lose\r\ntheir strength when for any period they have not been used enough. The\r\nsoreness that you feel is the natural condition that arises when you\r\nbegin to use a muscle that has been idle for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Barber’s Pole Have Stripes?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn early years the barber not only cut hair and shaved people, but he\r\nwas also a surgeon. He was a surgeon to the extent that he bled people.\r\nIn early times our knowledge of surgery was practically limited to\r\nblood letting. A great many of the ailments were attributed to too much\r\nblood in the body, and when anything got wrong with a man or woman, the\r\nfirst thing they thought of was to reduce the amount of blood in the\r\nbody by taking some of it out.\r\n\r\nThe town barber was the man who did this for people and his pole\r\nrepresented the sign of his business.\r\n\r\nThe round ball at the top which was generally gilded represents the\r\nbarbering end of the business. It stood for the brass basin which the\r\nbarber used to prepare lather for shaving customers.\r\n\r\nThe pole itself represents the staff which people who were having blood\r\ntaken out of their bodies held during the operation. The two spiral\r\nribbons, one red and one white, which are painted spirally on the pole,\r\nrepresented the bandages. The white one stood for the bandage which was\r\nput on before the blood was taken out and the red one the bandage which\r\nwas used for binding up the wound when the operation was completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Was the Flag Made?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design of our flag was outlined in a congressional resolution\r\npassed on June 14, 1777, which stated “that the flag of the thirteen\r\nUnited States be thirteen alternate stripes red and white; that the\r\nunion be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing the new\r\nconstellation.” After Vermont and Kentucky had been admitted to the\r\nUnion, Congress made a decree in 1794 that after May 1, 1795, “the flag\r\nof the United States be fifteen stripes alternate red and white and\r\nthat the Union be fifteen stars white on a blue field.” This made the\r\nstars and stripes again equal and it was the plan to add a new stripe\r\nand a new star for each new state admitted to the Union. Very soon,\r\nhowever, it was realized that the flag would be too large if we kept on\r\nadding one stripe for each new state admitted to the Union, so on April\r\n4, 1818, Congress passed a resolution reducing the number of stripes to\r\nthirteen once more to represent the original colonies, and to add only\r\na new star to the field when a new state was admitted to the Union. At\r\nthis time there were twenty states in the Union. Since that time none\r\nof the flags of the United States have more than thirteen stripes while\r\na new star has been added for each state until now we have forty-eight\r\nstars, representing the forty-eight states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Some Guns Called Gatling Guns?\r\n\r\n\r\nA gatling gun is a kind of gun invented by Richard Jordan Gatling\r\nin 1861 and 1862 and so it receives its name from its inventor. The\r\noriginal gatling gun had ten parallel barrels and was capable of firing\r\n1,000 shots per minute when operated by hand power. It was discharged\r\nby turning a crank and would shoot in proportion to the rapidity with\r\nwhich the crank was turned. It was at first not a huge success but has\r\nfrom time to time been improved so that the crank is now turned by\r\nelectric power and about fifteen hundred shots per minute can be fired\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did Hobson’s Choice Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs used today, this expression means a choice with only one thing to\r\nchoose. Tobias Hobson was a livery stable keeper at Cambridge, England,\r\nduring the reign of King Charles I. He kept a stable of forty horses\r\nwhich he hired out by the hour or day, and was famous in his day so far\r\nas a livery stable keeper could be.\r\n\r\nWhen you went to Hobson to hire a horse, you had the privilege of\r\nlooking over all the horses in the stable to decide which one you would\r\nlike to drive, but he always made you take the one in the stall nearest\r\nthe door. In this way all the horses in the stable were worked in turn\r\nand while you might pretend to choose your own horse, you really had no\r\nchoice--you had to take the one nearest the door or none. As soon as a\r\nhorse was hired, the other horses in the stable were moved up, each one\r\nto the stall next towards the door so there was always a horse in the\r\nstall nearest the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do They Call It a Honeymoon?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word Honeymoon which is commonly used to describe the first\r\nfew weeks after marriage, has always meant the first month or moon\r\nafter marriage, but does not have any reference to the month or moon\r\nexcepting as that describes a certain period of time.\r\n\r\nThe word originated in an old custom quite common among newly married\r\ncouples among the ancient Teutons of drinking a kind of wine made from\r\nhoney during the first thirty days after being married.\r\n\r\nIn these days newly married couples generally take a trip away from\r\nhome for a short or longer period after their wedding day and this is\r\ncalled the honeymoon whether it is but a few days or three months or\r\nmore. The custom of drinking wine made from honey has been abandoned so\r\nthat the word is now used in an entirely different sense than formerly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is a Horseshoe Said to Bring Good Luck?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe luck of the horseshoe comes from three lucky things always\r\nconnected with horseshoes. These consist of the following facts: It is\r\nthe shape of a crescent; it is a portion of a horse; it is made of iron.\r\n\r\nEach of these has from time immemorial been considered lucky. Anything\r\nin the shape of a crescent was always considered a thing to bring luck.\r\nFrom the earliest times, too, at least since the world knew something\r\nof the qualities of iron, iron has been regarded as a thing to give\r\nprotection and incidentally that would involve good luck. And lastly\r\nthe horse, since the days of English mythology, has been regarded as\r\na luck animal. When, then, we had a combination of the three--the\r\ncrescent, the iron and the horse in one object, it became a true lucky\r\nsign in the eyes of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Wonders of the Human Body.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are said to be more than two million little openings in the skins\r\nof our bodies to serve as outlets for an equal number of sweat glands.\r\nThe body contains more than two hundred bones. It is said that as much\r\nblood as is in the entire body passes through the heart every minute,\r\ni.e., all the blood in the body goes in and out of the heart once every\r\nminute. The lung capacity of the average person is about 325 cubic\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nWith every breath you inhale about two-thirds of a pint of fresh air\r\nand exhale an equal amount if you breathe normally.\r\n\r\nThe stomach of the average adult person has a capacity of about five\r\npints and manufactures about nine pounds of gastric juice daily.\r\n\r\nThere are over five hundred muscles in the body all of which should be\r\nexercised daily to keep you in the best condition. The average adult\r\nhuman heart weighs from eight to twelve ounces and it beats about\r\n100,000 times every twenty-four hours. The perspiration system in the\r\nbody has only very small ducts or pipes, but there are about nine miles\r\nof them. The average person takes about one ton of food and drink each\r\nyear. We breathe about eighteen times a minute, which amounts to about\r\n3,000 cubic feet an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Did the Expression “Kick the Bucket” Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expression originally came from the method used in stringing a\r\nhog after killing it. The pig after being slaughtered was hung by the\r\nhind legs. A piece of bent wood was passed in behind the tendons of\r\neach of the hind legs and the pig hung up by this stick of wood much\r\nlike we hang up clothes with a clothes hanger today. The piece of wood\r\nwas called a bucket. The “bucket” part of the expression does not,\r\ntherefore, refer to a bucket at all but to this bent piece of wood. All\r\nare not agreed on this explanation, however, as it does not explain\r\nwhere the “kick” comes in. Many investigators hold to the belief that\r\na man named Bolsover was the first to “kick the bucket” literally and\r\nthat the expression came from the manner of his death. He stood on a\r\npail or bucket while arranging to hang himself by tying a rope around\r\nhis neck and to a beam which he could not reach without standing on the\r\nbucket. When ready he kicked the bucket out from under his feet and\r\nso succeeded in carrying out his own wishes and in so doing coined a\r\nfamous expression which still means “to die.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did the Word “News” Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word “News” which was created to describe what newspapers are\r\nsupposed to print, came from the four letters which have for ages\r\nbeen used as abbreviations of the directions of the compass. In this\r\nN stands for North, E for East, S for South and W for West, and in\r\nillustrating the points of the compass the following diagram has long\r\nbeen used:\r\n\r\n     N\r\n     |\r\n  W--+--E\r\n     |\r\n     S\r\n\r\nThe earliest newspapers always printed this sign on the front pages of\r\ntheir papers in every issue. This was done to indicate that the paper\r\nprinted all the happenings from four quarters of the globe.\r\n\r\nLater on some enterprising newspaper man who may have forgotten the\r\noriginal significance of the letter in the diagram, arranged the\r\nletters N. E. W. S. in a straight line at the head of the paper and\r\nthat is how what we read in the papers came to be known as news.\r\n\r\nAlmost one-half the whole number of newspapers published in the world\r\nare published in the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Made the First Umbrella?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one knows who made the first umbrella but we know that Jonas Hanway\r\nof London was the first man to carry one over his head to keep off the\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nUmbrellas seem to have been known as far back as the days of Ninevah\r\nand Persepolis, for representations of them appear frequently in the\r\nsculptures of those early days. The women of ancient Rome and Greece\r\ncarried them but the men never did.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanway is said to be the first man who walked in the streets of\r\nLondon with an open umbrella over his head to keep off the rain. He is\r\nsaid to have used it for thirty years before they came into general use\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW MAN LEARNED TO TELL TIME\r\n\r\nThe first picture shows what was probably man’s first method of telling\r\ntime. The principle was the same as that of the sun-dial. It provides\r\nto-day an accurate method of telling time.\r\n\r\nOf course, man in the early days needed to find some other means of\r\nnoting the passing of time at night, for then the sun cast no shadow\r\nfor him. His ingenuity taught him to make a candle which was light and\r\ndark in alternate rings, and as each section burned he made a mark to\r\nrecord the passing of a certain length of time. Before candles were\r\ninvented he used a rope in which he tied knots at equal spaces apart\r\nand which he burned as shown in the third picture.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Time Piece\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Time?\r\n\r\nTime, as a separate entity, has not yet been defined in language.\r\nDefinitions will be found to be merely explanations of the sense in\r\nwhich we use the word in matters of practical life. No human being can\r\ntell how long a minute is; only that it is longer than a second and\r\nshorter than an hour. In some sense we can think of a longer or shorter\r\nperiod of time, but this is merely comparative. The difference between\r\n50 and 75 steps a minute in marching is clear to us, but note that we\r\nintroduce motion and space before we can get a conception of time as a\r\nsuccession of events, but time, in itself, remains elusive.\r\n\r\nIn time measures we strive for a uniform motion of something and this\r\nimplies equal spaces in equal times; so we here assume just what we\r\ncannot explain, for space is as difficult to define as time. Time\r\ncannot be “squared” or used as a multiplier or divisor. Only numbers\r\ncan be so used; so when we speak of “the square of the time” we mean\r\nsome number which we have arbitrarily assumed to represent it. This\r\nbecomes plain when we state that in calculations relating to pendulums,\r\nfor example, we may use seconds and inches--minutes and feet--or\r\nseconds and meters--and the answer will come out right in the units\r\nwhich we have assumed. Still more, numbers themselves have no meaning\r\ntill they are applied to something, and here we are applying them to\r\ntime, space and motion; so we are trying to explain three abstractions\r\nby a fourth! But, happily, the results of these assumptions and\r\ncalculations are borne out in practical human life, and we are not\r\ncompelled to settle the deep question as to whether fundamental\r\nknowledge is possible to the human mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Was Man’s First Division of Time?\r\n\r\nEvidently, man began by considering the day as a unit and did not\r\ninclude the night in his time-keeping for a long period. “And the\r\nevening and the morning were the first day,” Gen. i, 5; “Evening and\r\nmorning and at noonday,” Ps. lv, 17, divides the day (“sun up”) in two\r\nparts. “Fourth part of a day,” Neh. ix, 3, shows another advance. Then\r\ncomes, “are there not twelve hours in a day,” John xi, 9. The “eleventh\r\nhour,” Matt. xx, 1 to 12, shows clearly that sunset was 12 o’clock. A\r\nmost remarkable feature of this 12-hour day, in the New Testament, is\r\nthat the writers generally speak of the third, sixth and ninth hours,\r\nActs ii, 15; iii, 1; x, 9. This is extremely interesting, as it shows\r\nthat the writers still thought in quarter days (Neh. ix, 3) and had\r\nnot yet acquired the 12-hour conception given to them by the Romans.\r\nThey thought in quarter days even when using the 12-hour numerals!\r\nNote, further, that references are to “hours”; so it is evident that\r\nin New Testament times they did not need smaller subdivisions. “About\r\nthe third hour” shows the mental attitude. That they had no conception\r\nof our minutes, seconds and fifth-seconds becomes quite plain when\r\nwe notice that they jumped down from the hour to nowhere, in such\r\nexpressions as “in an instant--in the twinkling of an eye.”\r\n\r\nBefore this the night had been divided into three watches (Judges vii,\r\n19). Poetry to this day uses the “hours” and the “watches” as symbols.\r\n\r\nThis twelve hours of daylight gave very variable hours in latitudes\r\nsome distance from the equator, being long in summer and short in\r\nwinter. The amount of human ingenuity expended on time measures so as\r\nto divide the time from sunrise to sunset into twelve equal parts is\r\nalmost beyond belief. In Constantinople, to-day, this is used, but in a\r\nrather imperfect manner, for the clocks are modern and run twenty-four\r\nhours uniformly; so the best they can do is to set them to mark twelve\r\nat sunset. This necessitates setting to the varying length of the days,\r\nso that the clocks appear to be sometimes more and sometimes less\r\nthan six hours ahead of ours. A clock on the tower at the Sultan’s\r\nprivate mosque gives the impression of being out of order and about six\r\nhours ahead, but it is running correctly to their system. Hotels in\r\nConstantinople often show two clocks, one of them to our twelve o’clock\r\nnoon system. Evidently the Jewish method of ending a day at sunset is\r\nthe same and explains the command, “let not the sun go down upon thy\r\nwrath,” which we might read, “do not carry your anger over to another\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nThis simple line of steps in dividing the day and night is taken\r\nprincipally from the Bible because every one can easily look up the\r\npassages quoted and many more, while quotations from books not in\r\ngeneral use would not be so clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did Man Begin to Measure Time?\r\n\r\nNow, as to the methods of measuring time, we must use circumstantial\r\nevidence for the prehistoric period. The rising and the going down of\r\nthe sun--the lengthening shadows, etc., must come first, and we are on\r\nsafe ground here, for savages still use primitive methods like setting\r\nup a stick and marking its shadow so that a party trailing behind can\r\nestimate the distance the leaders are ahead by the changed position of\r\nthe shadow. Men notice their shortening and lengthening shadows to this\r\nday. When the shadow of a man shortens more and more slowly till it\r\nappears to be fixed, the observer knows it is noon, and when it shows\r\nthe least observable lengthening then it is just past noon. Now, it is\r\na remarkable fact that this crude method of determining noon is just\r\nthe same as “taking the sun” to determine noon at sea. Noon is the time\r\nat which the sun reaches his highest point on any given day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sun-dial is only an improvement on the stick which\r\ncast a shadow which enabled man to tell the time of day at any hour.\r\nThe shadow moves around the dial, falling on the numbers on the circle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Is the Time Calculated at Sea?\r\n\r\nAt sea this is determined generally by a sextant, which simply measures\r\nthe angle between the horizon and the sun. The instrument is applied a\r\nlittle before noon and the observer sees the sun creeping upward slower\r\nand slower till a little tremor or hesitation appears, indicating that\r\nthe sun has reached his height--noon. Oh! you wish to know if the\r\nobserver is likely to make a mistake? Yes, and when accurate local time\r\nis important, several officers on a large ship will take the meridian\r\npassage at the same time and average their readings, so as to reduce\r\nthe “personal error.” All of which is merely a greater degree of\r\naccuracy than that of the man who observes his shadow.\r\n\r\nThe gradual development of the primitive shadow methods culminated in\r\nthe modern sun-dial. The “dial of Ahas” (Isa. xxxviii, 8), on which\r\nthe sun went back ten “degrees,” is often referred to, but in one of\r\nthe revised editions of the Bible the sun went back ten “steps.” This\r\nbecomes extremely interesting when we find that in India there still\r\nremains an immense dial built with steps instead of hour lines.\r\n\r\nIn a restored flower garden, within one of the large houses in the\r\nruins of Pompeii, may be seen a sun-dial of the Armillary type,\r\npresumably in its original position. It looks as if the plane of the\r\nequator and the position of the earth’s axis must have been known to\r\nthe maker.\r\n\r\nBoth these dials were in use before the beginning of our era and were\r\ncovered by the great eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D., which destroyed\r\nPompeii and Herculaneum.\r\n\r\n~THREE GREAT STEPS IN MEASURING TIME~\r\n\r\nModern sun-dials differ only in being more accurately made and a few\r\n“curiosity” dials added. The necessity for time during the night, as\r\nman’s life became a little more complicated, necessitated the invention\r\nof time machines. The “clepsydra,” or water-clock, was probably the\r\nfirst. A French writer has dug up some old records putting it back\r\nto Hoang-ti 2679 B.C., but it appears to have been certainly in use\r\nin China in 1100 B.C., so we will be satisfied with that date. In\r\npresenting a subject to the young student it is sometimes advisable to\r\nuse round numbers to give a simple comprehension and then leave him to\r\nfind the overlapping of dates and methods as he advances. Keeping this\r\nin mind, the following table may be used to give an elementary hint of\r\nthe three great steps in time measuring.\r\n\r\nShadow time, 2000 to 1000 B.C.\r\n\r\nDials and water-clocks, 1000 B.C. to 1000 A.D.\r\n\r\nClocks and watches, 1000 to 2000 A.D.\r\n\r\nGear-wheel clocks and watches have here been pushed forward to 2000\r\nA.D., as they may last to that time, but no doubt we will supersede\r\nthem. At the present time science is just about ready to say that a\r\ntime measurer consisting of wheels and pinions--a driving power and a\r\nregulator in the form of a pendulum or balance, is a clumsy contrivance\r\nand that we ought to do better very soon.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how few are aware that the simplest form of sun-dial\r\nis the best, and that, as a regulator of our present clocks, it is\r\ngood within one or two minutes. No one need be without a “noon-mark”\r\nsun-dial; that is, every one may have the best of all dials. Take a\r\npost or any straight object standing “plumb,” or best of all the corner\r\nof a building. In the case of the post, or tree trunk, a stone (shown\r\nin solid black) may be set in the ground; but for the building a line\r\nmay often be cut across a flagstone of the footpath. Many methods may\r\nbe employed to get this noon mark, which is simply a north and south\r\nline: Viewing the pole star, using a compass (if the local variation\r\nis known) or the old method of finding the time at which the shadow of\r\na pole is shortest. But the best practical way in this day is to use a\r\nwatch set to local time and make the mark at 12 o’clock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Drawing by James Arthur.\r\n\r\nA form of Sun-dial that is as good to-day as any dial for determining\r\nnoon.]\r\n\r\nOn four days of the year the sun is right and your mark may be set at\r\n12 on these days, but you may use an almanac and look in the column\r\nmarked “mean time at noon” or “sun on meridian.” For example, suppose\r\non the bright day when you are ready to place your noon mark you read\r\nin this column 11.50, then when your watch shows 11.50 make your noon\r\nmark to the shadow and it will be right for all time to come. Owing\r\nto the fact that there are not an even number of days in a year, it\r\nfollows that on any given yearly date at noon the earth is not at the\r\nsame place in its elliptical orbit, and the correction of this by the\r\nleap years causes the equation table to vary in periods of four years.\r\nThe centennial leap years cause another variation of 400 years, etc.,\r\nbut these variations are less than the error in reading a dial.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did Men Tell Time When the Sun Cast No Shadows?\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo by James Arthur.\r\n\r\nWATER CLOCKS FOR TELLING TIME\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the hour-glass or sand-glass. It is really a type of\r\nwater-clock, being based on the same principle. The upper glass bulb\r\nwas filled with sand and this sand fell through a little hole between\r\nthe two bulbs. When the sand had all gone through, the glass was turned\r\nupside down and the operation repeated.\r\n\r\nTIME-BOY OF INDIA.--WATER-CLOCK.\r\n\r\nThe Water-clock consisted of a large vessel filled with water, on the\r\nsurface of which was placed a smaller vessel, really a gong, with a\r\nhole in the bottom. The water gradually filled the smaller vessel, and\r\nit sank. The Time-boy sat beside the Water-clock and as soon as the\r\nvessel sank he fished it out, emptied it, struck the gong one or more\r\ntimes and set it on the water again.]\r\n\r\nDuring the night and also in cloudy weather the sun-dial was useless,\r\nand we read that the priests of the temples and monks of more modern\r\ntimes “went out to observe the stars” to make a guess at the time\r\nof night. The most prominent type after the shadow devices was the\r\n“water-clock” or “clepsydra,” but many other methods were used, such as\r\ncandles, oil lamps, and in comparatively late times, the sand-glass.\r\nThe fundamental principle of all water-clocks is the escape of water\r\nfrom a vessel through a small hole. It is evident that such a vessel\r\nwould empty itself each time it is filled in very nearly the same\r\ntime. The reverse of this has been used, as shown in the picture of\r\nthe Time-boy of India. He sat in front of a large vessel of water and\r\nfloated a bronze cup having a small hole in its bottom in this large\r\nvessel, and as the water ran in through the hole the cup sank. The boy\r\nthen fished it up and struck one or more blows on it as a gong. This he\r\ncontinued and a rude division of time was obtained--while the boy kept\r\nawake!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drawing from description by James Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe “Hon-woo-et-low,” Canton, China. Copper jars dropping water.]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of all water-clocks was undoubtedly the “copper\r\njars dropping water,” in Canton, China, where it can still be seen.\r\nReferring to the picture herewith and reading the four Chinese\r\ncharacters downwards the translation is “Canton City.” To the left and\r\nstill downwards, “Hon-woo-et-low,” which is, “Copper jars dropping\r\nwater.” Educated Chinamen inform me that it is over 3000 years old.\r\nThe little open building or tower in which it stands is higher than\r\nsurrounding buildings. It is, therefore, reasonably safe to state that\r\nthe Chinese had a weather and time station over 1000 years before our\r\nera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo by James Arthur.\r\n\r\nTOWER OF THE WINDS.\r\n\r\nThis tower is located at Athens, Greece. It was built about 50 B.C.\r\nIt is octagonal in shape and had at one time sun-dials on each of its\r\neight sides. On top was a bronze weather vane from which it derived its\r\nname.]\r\n\r\n~A PRIMITIVE TWELVE-HOUR CLOCK~\r\n\r\nIt is a 12-hour clock, consisting of four copper jars partially built\r\nin masonry forming a stair-like structure. Commencing at the top jar\r\neach one drops into the next downward until the water reaches the solid\r\nbottom jar. In this lowest one a float, “the bamboo stick,” is placed\r\nand indicates the height of the water, and thus in a rude way gives the\r\ntime. It is said to be set morning and evening by dipping the water\r\nfrom jar 4 to jar 1, so it runs 12 hours of our time. What are the\r\nuses of jars 2 and 3, since the water simply enters them and drips out\r\nagain? No information could be obtained, but I venture an explanation\r\nand hope the reader can do better, as we are all of a family and\r\nthere is no jealousy. When the top jar is filled for a 12-hour run\r\nit would drip out too fast during the first six hours and too slow\r\nduring the second six hours, on account of the varying “head” of water.\r\nNow, the spigot of jar 2 could be set so that it would gain water\r\nduring the first six hours, and lose during the second six hours, and\r\nthus equalize a little by splitting the error of jar 1 in two parts.\r\nSimilarly, these two errors of jar 2 could be again split by jar 3\r\nmaking four small variations in lowest jar, instead of one large error\r\nin the flow of jar 1. This could be extended to a greater number of\r\njars, another jar making eight smaller errors.\r\n\r\nThe best thing the young student could do at this point would be to\r\ngrasp the remarkable fact that the clock is not an old machine, since\r\nis covers only the comparatively short period from 1364 to the present\r\nday. Compared with the period of man’s history and inventions it is\r\nof yesterday. Strictly speaking, as we use the word clock, its age\r\nfrom De Vick to the modern astronomical is only about 540 years. If we\r\ntake the year 1660, we find that it represents the center of modern\r\nimprovements in clocks, a few years before and after that date includes\r\nthe pendulum, the anchor and dead beat escapements, the minute and\r\nsecond hands, the circular balance and the hair spring, along with\r\nminor improvements. Since the end of that period, which we may make\r\n1700, no fundamental invention has been added to clocks and watches.\r\nThis becomes impressive when we remember that the last 200 years have\r\nproduced more inventions than all previous known history--but only\r\nminor improvements in clocks! The application of electricity for\r\nwinding, driving, or regulating clocks is not fundamental, for the\r\ntime-keeping is done by the master clock with its pendulum and wheels,\r\njust as by any grandfather’s clock 200 years old. This broad survey of\r\ntime measuring does not permit us to go into minute mechanical details.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST MODERN CLOCK\r\n\r\n  Drawing by James Arthur.\r\n\r\nModern clocks commence with De Vick’s of 1364, which is the first\r\nunquestioned clock consisting of toothed wheels and containing the\r\nfundamental features of our present clocks. References are often quoted\r\nback to about 1000 A.D., but the words translated “clocks” were used\r\nfor bells and dials at that date; so we are forced to consider the De\r\nVick clock as the first till more evidence is obtained. It has been\r\npointed out, however, that this clock could hardly have been invented\r\nall at once; and therefore it is probable that many inventions leading\r\nup to it have been lost to history. That part of a clock which does the\r\nticking is called the “escapement,” and the oldest form known is the\r\n“Verge.”]\r\n\r\n~EARLIEST CLOCKS HAD NO DIALS OR HANDS~\r\n\r\nScattered references in old writings make it reasonably certain that\r\nfrom about 1000 A.D. to 1300 A.D. bells were struck by machines\r\nregulated with this verge escapement, thus showing that the striking\r\npart of a clock is older than the clock itself. It seems strange to us\r\nto say that many of the earlier clocks were strikers only, and had no\r\ndials or hands, just as if you turned the face of your clock to the\r\nwall and depended on the striking for the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo by James Arthur.\r\n\r\nENGLISH BLACKSMITH’S CLOCK.]\r\n\r\nA good idea of the old church clocks may be obtained from the picture\r\nherewith. Tradition has followed it down as the “English Blacksmith’s\r\nClock.” It has the very earliest application of the pendulum. The\r\npendulum is less than 3 inches long and is hung on the verge, or pallet\r\naxle, and beats 222 per minute. This clock may be safely put at 250\r\nyears old, and contains nothing invented since that date. Wheels are\r\ncast brass and all teeth laboriously filed out by hand. Pinions are\r\nsolid with the axles, or “staffs,” and also filed out by hand. It is\r\nput together, generally by mortise, tenon and cotter, but it has four\r\noriginal screws all made by hand with the file. How did he thread the\r\nholes for these screws? Probably made a tap by hand as he made the\r\nscrews. But the most remarkable feature is the fact that no lathe was\r\nused in forming any part--all staffs, pinions and pivots being filed by\r\nhand. This is simply extraordinary when it is pointed out that a little\r\ndead center lathe is the simplest machine in the world, and he could\r\nhave made one in less than a day and saved himself weeks of hard labor.\r\nIt is probable that he had great skill in hand work and that learning\r\nto use a lathe would have been a great and tedious effort for him. So\r\nwe have a complete striking clock made by a man so poor that he had\r\nonly his anvil, hammer and file. The weights are hung on cords as thick\r\nas an ordinary lead-pencil and pass over pulleys having spikes set\r\naround them to prevent the cords from slipping. The weights descend 7\r\nfeet in 12 hours, so they must be pulled up--not wound up--twice a day.\r\nThe single hour hand is a work of art and is cut through like lace.\r\nPublic clocks may still be seen in Europe with only one hand. Many have\r\nbeen puzzled by finding that old, rudely made clocks often have fine\r\ndials, but this is not remarkable when we state that art and engraving\r\nhad reached a high level before the days of clocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LARGEST CLOCK IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\n  Courtesy of Colgate and Company.\r\n\r\nTHE HANDS OF THE LARGEST CLOCK IN THE WORLD--ON THE ROOF OF THE COLGATE\r\nFACTORY.\r\n\r\nThis big clock faces the giant office buildings of down-town New York.\r\nIts dial is 38 feet in diameter and can be read easily at a distance\r\nof three miles, so that passengers on the incoming liners pick out the\r\nclock as one of their first sights of New York.\r\n\r\nThe next largest clock (on the Metropolitan Tower) is 26¹⁄₂ feet in\r\ndiameter; the Westminster clock of London, 22¹⁄₂ feet.\r\n\r\nThe great clock weighs approximately 6 tons. The minute hand, 20 feet\r\nlong, travels at its point 23 inches every minute; more than one-half\r\nmile each day.\r\n\r\nThe bed of this clock is 4 feet in length, the wheels and gears being\r\nmade of bronze and pinions of hardened steel. The time train occupies\r\nabout one-third of the bedplate, and has a main time wheel measuring\r\n18¹⁄₃ inches in diameter. This train is equipped with Dennison’s double\r\nthree-legged gravity escapement, which was invented by Sir Edmund\r\nBecket, chiefly for use on the famous Westminster clock, installed\r\nin the Parliament Buildings, in London, England. The use of this\r\nescapement is most advantageous for a gigantic clock of this kind as it\r\nallows the impulse given the pendulum rod to be always constant, and\r\ntherefore does not permit any change of power or driving force of the\r\nclock to affect its time-keeping qualities.\r\n\r\nIt requires about 600 pounds of cast-iron to propel this time train,\r\nand the clock is arranged to run eight days without winding. The\r\ngravity arms of the escapement are fastened at a point very near the\r\nsuspension spring, and the arms are fitted with bronze roller beat pins.\r\n\r\nThe dial contains 1134 square feet, or about one thirty-fifth of an\r\nacre. The numerals consist of heavy black strokes, 5 feet 6 inches\r\nlong and 30 inches wide at the outer end, tapering to a point at the\r\ninner end. The circumference of the dial is approximately 120 feet. The\r\ndistance from center to center of numerals is 10 feet, and the minute\r\nspaces are 2 feet.\r\n\r\nThe background on dial is painted white, and in the daytime the black\r\nnumerals show up distinctly. At night the numerals, or hour marks,\r\nare designated by a row of incandescent bulbs placed in a trough 5\r\ninches wide and 5 inches deep. The hands at night are outlined with\r\nincandescent electric lights, there being 27 lamps on the hour hand and\r\n42 lamps on the minute hand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MACHINERY WHICH RUNS A BIG CLOCK]\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the machinery necessary to operate a large modern\r\ntower clock.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism is held in place and confined entirely within a cast-iron\r\nstructure which is firmly bolted to the floor. The wheels are composed\r\nof bronze, the pinions of steel (hardened) and the gears are machine\r\ncut. At the front of the clock is a small dial which enables one to\r\ntell exactly the position of the hands on the outside dials, and there\r\nis also a second hand to permit of very close regulation and adjustment.\r\n\r\nThree ways are provided for the regulation. First by a knurled screw\r\nat the top of bed frame. Second by a revolving disc at the bottom of\r\nthe pendulum ball. Very often by either of these two methods it is\r\nimpossible to bring the clock to fractional seconds, and in order to\r\npermit of a nicety of adjustment there is a cup fitted at the top of\r\nthe ball so that by inserting or taking out lead pellets, the rating\r\ncan be brought to absolute time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLOCK IN INDEPENDENCE HALL\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE HALL, PHILADELPHIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW YORK CITY HALL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does the Day Begin?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand this subject we must first appreciate that a day as we\r\nthink of it is a division of time made by man for the purpose of his\r\nown reckoning. So far as the beginning of day is concerned, it begins\r\nat a different place in the world every hour; yes, every minute and\r\nevery second in the day. As, however, the distance in feet where the\r\nday begins from one minute to another is so short that we can hardly\r\nnotice it in such short measurements of time, we will look at the\r\nanswer to the question from hour to hour. When you understand the\r\nsubject from that point you can yourself see that the day actually\r\nbegins at a different point of the earth every minute and every second\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much of the Earth Does the Sun Shine on at One Time?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun is shining on some part of the earth all the time and the\r\nshining of the sun makes the difference between day and night. Wherever\r\nthe sun is shining it is day-time, and where the sun is not shining it\r\nis night-time.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate we will make use of an ordinary orange and a lighted gas\r\njet. Let us take a long hat-pin and stick it through the orange from\r\nstem to stem. Now hold the orange by the ends of the hat-pin up before\r\nthe lighted gas jet. You will notice that one-half of the orange is\r\nlighted, while the other half is dark. Of course, it is the half of the\r\norange away from the light that is dark. Now, revolve the orange slowly\r\non the hat-pin axis toward the light. When you have turned the orange\r\nhalf way round the part that was formerly dark is now lighted up and\r\nthe other part is now dark.\r\n\r\nNow examine closely and you will see that just one-half of the orange\r\nis lighted at one time and the other half is dark. You revolve the\r\norange in front of the light slowly and a portion of the surface of the\r\norange is always coming into the light, while a corresponding portion\r\nof it on the opposite side is constantly going into the dark. In other\r\nwords, whatever the speed at which you revolve the orange toward the\r\nlight, one-half of it is always light and the other half is always dark.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what happens in the relation of the earth to the sun\r\nevery day. One-half of the earth, which is continually revolving on\r\nits axis, is facing the sun, and is, therefore, in the daylight, while\r\nthe other half of the earth’s surface is in darkness, because the\r\nlight from the sun does not strike any portion of it. If the earth\r\ndid not revolve one-half of it would always be in day-time, while the\r\nother half would be continually having night-time. As the earth is\r\nalways moving or revolving the half where it is day-time is constantly\r\nchanging, so that the day is beginning on one-half of the earth’s\r\nsurface every second of the day. Actually, of course, then, if you live\r\non the east side of town day begins with you a little sooner than with\r\nyour chum who lives on the west side of town. We have come to measure\r\nthe beginning of day as sunrise and the beginning of night as sunset,\r\nwherever we happen to be.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in setting clocks and in measuring time we do not take\r\ninto consideration these very slight differences in the rising and\r\nsetting of the sun, but set our clocks all alike in different parts\r\nof the same town or city to avoid confusion. In fact, in order to\r\novercome the difficulties and confusions arising in reckoning the time\r\nof the clock in different localities, and still keep the beginning of\r\nwhat we call day-time constant with the hands of the clock, we have\r\nagreed upon what we call standard time. We agreed upon this system\r\nof fixing standard time because the actual sun time by which people\r\nset their clocks up to a few years ago led to so many mistakes in\r\ncatching trains, keeping engagements and other misunderstandings where\r\nthe question of time was involved. Then when this system of standard\r\ntime was adopted the confusion became even worse, and the mistakes and\r\nmisses more numerous, because some people insisted on setting their\r\nclocks to standard time and others insisted on sticking to the old sun\r\ntime schedule. So you could never tell by looking at the clock what\r\ntime it really was unless they put a sign on the clock saying what kind\r\nof time they were going by. Finally, however, most of the people came\r\nto appreciate that it would be a good idea to use one uniform system of\r\nsetting the clocks and of having them in harmony in a sense with the\r\nother clocks in the world, and the adoption of the standard time plan\r\nbecame universal. To make this system practical and effective, certain\r\npoints about equally distant from each other were selected, at which\r\npoint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Is the Hour Changed?\r\n\r\n\r\nthe hour would change for all points within that zone. Under this\r\nsystem all timepieces in any one zone point to the same hour. So the\r\nclock time changes only as you go east or west. All points on a north\r\nand south line have the same time as the zone in which it is located.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in adjusting the time in America the country was\r\ndivided into four east and west zones. The first zone takes in\r\neverything on a straight north and south line east of Pittsburg, and is\r\ncalled Eastern time. The second zone extends from Pittsburg to Chicago,\r\nand is called Central time; the third zone extends from Chicago to\r\nDenver, and is called Mountain time; while the fourth zone extends\r\nfrom Denver to the Pacific Ocean. These selections were made because\r\nthe sun actually rises about one hour later in Pittsburg than in New\r\nYork; one hour later in Chicago than in Pittsburg; one hour later in\r\nDenver than in Chicago, and one hour later on the Pacific Coast than in\r\nDenver. Under this plan when it is nine o’clock in New York it is only\r\neight o’clock at Pittsburg and all points in the Central zone; seven\r\no’clock in all points in the Mountain zone; six o’clock in Denver and\r\nfive o’clock in San Francisco. As you keep travelling westward you drop\r\none hour of the clock time in every zone, and as under this system the\r\nearth’s east to west distance is divided into twenty-four such zones,\r\nif you went west entirely around the world you would lose a whole day\r\nof clock time.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you went around the world from west to east in the same\r\nmanner you would gain a whole day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does the Day Change?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis system of agreeing on fixed places where the hour changes made it\r\nnecessary to also fix a point where for the purposes of the calendar\r\nthe day also changes. This imaginary north and south line is fixed\r\nupon at 180 degrees west longitude, which would cut the Pacific Ocean\r\nin two. This line makes it possible for a person to travel all day\r\nbefore approaching this line and then find himself after crossing it\r\ntravelling all the next day with the same name for the day of the week.\r\nThus he could spend all of Sunday travelling toward the International\r\nDay Line, as this is called, and after crossing it spend another\r\nSunday, which would be the next day, going away from it. This would\r\ngive him the novel experience of having two Sundays on successive days.\r\nThe same thing would happen if he were travelling to the Day Line on\r\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday. He would live\r\nthrough two succeeding days of the same name in the same week, one\r\nright after the other. This would be in going westward.\r\n\r\nIf you were traveling eastward and crossed the International Day Line\r\non Sunday at midnight you would lose a day completely out of the week,\r\nfor when you woke up the next morning it would be Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Cook the Things We Eat?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have several reasons for doing this. The first and most important\r\nreason to us is that the application of heat to food makes it more\r\neasy to digest. Other reasons are that when cooked our food is more\r\npalatable; the process of cooking kills all microbes, which, if taken\r\ninto our bodies alive, would give us diseases, and also it is easier\r\nfor us to chew food that has been cooked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WONDERS PERFORMED BY ELECTRIC LIFT MAGNET\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the construction of a successful electric lift\r\nmagnet. This device, by means of magnetic attraction, fastens itself\r\nto practically all kinds of iron and steel without the aid of slings,\r\ncables or chains.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Magnet\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes an Electro Magnet Lift Things?\r\n\r\nThe working parts of an electric lift magnet are as follows:\r\n\r\n_A Shell._--This is a steel casting heavily ribbed on the top for\r\nstrength, and also to assist in radiating the heating effect from the\r\ncoil.\r\n\r\nIt is usually made circular in shape, the outside rim forming one pole,\r\nwhile the lug in the center forms the other. The coil fits in between\r\nthese poles, thus making a magnet similar to the ordinary horseshoe\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n_A Bottom Plate._--The under side of the magnet is closed by a very\r\ntough and hard non-magnetic steel plate, in order to protect the coil.\r\n\r\nAs well as being non-magnetic, this plate also has sufficient strength\r\nto resist the severe wear to which a magnet is necessarily subjected.\r\n\r\n_A Terminal Box._--A one-piece heavily-constructed steel casting bolted\r\nto the top of the shell, containing and protecting the brass sockets\r\ninto which the wires from the coil terminate, forms the Terminal Box.\r\n\r\nThe sockets are made to receive plugs placed on the end of the\r\nconductor wire, by which the magnet is connected with the generator.\r\n\r\n_A Coil._--This consists of a round insulated wire which is passed,\r\nwhile being wound, through a cement-like substance, heavily coating\r\neach individual strand.\r\n\r\nA low voltage of current is then passed through the coil, a sufficient\r\nlength of time, to thoroughly dry out and bake the coating. This\r\nrenders the magnet absolutely fireproof, eliminating all danger of\r\nshort circuiting of the coil.\r\n\r\nWhen finished it is well taped to protect the outside wire from\r\nbecoming chafed.\r\n\r\nThe coil is made slightly smaller than the inside dimensions of the\r\nshell and the remaining space is filled with an impregnating compound,\r\nwhich hardens to the consistency of pitch.\r\n\r\nThis renders the coil thoroughly waterproof; also forms a cushion to\r\nprevent injury from the severe jars and shocks, received when dropping\r\na magnet on its load.\r\n\r\n_A Controller._--The rapidity with which it is necessary to turn\r\ncurrent on and off while operating a magnet, creates what is called a\r\n“back kick.” Unless this is dissipated quickly it is very destructive\r\nto the coil.\r\n\r\nA special controller dissipates this back kick through a set of\r\nresistance coils placed in the controller. By means of an automatic\r\narrangement, connection with these coils is made instantly upon\r\nbreaking the current between the magnet and generator.\r\n\r\nA system of control used prevents undue heating of the coil. This\r\nenables the magnet to lift as large a load after a long steady run as\r\nat the start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is a Lodestone?\r\n\r\n\r\nA lodestone is a variety of the mineral named magnetite which is a\r\nnatural magnet. The name magnet comes from the name of the mineral\r\nmagnetite and this in turn derived its name from the fact that it was\r\nfirst discovered in Magnesia. The word magnet really means the “Stone\r\nof Magnesia.”\r\n\r\nA lodestone is one of the mysteries of nature. Its properties can\r\nmore nearly be understood if we examine an artificial magnet, which\r\nis generally made in the form of either a straight bar or a shoe.\r\nAn artificial magnet is made of iron. If you drop a bar magnet into\r\na box of iron filings, the filings attach themselves to the bar. If\r\nyou examine it closely you observe that most of the filings attach\r\nthemselves to the ends of the bar. Therefore we call the ends of the\r\nbar the poles of the magnet.\r\n\r\nIf you suspend a magnetic needle at its center of gravity so that it\r\nis absolutely free to turn, you will soon find one end of the needle\r\npointing north and the other south of course. The end which is pointed\r\ntoward the north is called the north pole and the other the south pole.\r\nIf you have a horse-shoe magnet, you can demonstrate this for yourself.\r\nRub the end of your magnet over a sewing needle and oil the needle so\r\nthat when you lay it on the surface of a glass of water it will float.\r\nThen look at it closely. You will see the needle slowly turn until\r\nfinally it becomes quite still. If you have a compass at hand so that\r\nyou know surely which is north and which is south, you will find one\r\nend of the needle pointing north and the other south. You can then\r\nplace the end of your magnet against the outside of the glass and draw\r\nthe needle toward your magnet. Your horse-shoe magnet has its north and\r\nsouth poles close together.\r\n\r\nIf you have a bar magnet and the end of the needle with the eye in it\r\nis pointing north, you can drive the needle on the surface of the water\r\naway from you by touching the outside of the glass opposite that end of\r\nthe needle with the north pole of your magnet. On the other hand, if\r\nyou reverse the experiment and place the south pole of your magnet to\r\nthe side of the glass, the needle will come toward the magnet. In other\r\nwords then the like poles of a magnet repel each other and the unlike\r\npoles attract each other.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting way to show this is to take two lodestones or two\r\nmagnets and let a lot of iron filings attach themselves to the ends\r\nof them. Then when you have done this, point the two north poles of\r\nthe magnets or lodestones at each other close together. You will be\r\nintensely interested in seeing how quickly the mysterious something\r\nthat is in the magnets makes the filings on the two ends of the magnet\r\ntry to get away from each other. On the other hand when you put a north\r\nand south pole together, they form a union of the iron filings.\r\n\r\nAnother strange thing about a magnet is that if you break it in two,\r\neach half will be a complete magnet in itself with a north and south\r\npole also, and this is true no matter how many times you break it\r\ninto pieces. From this we learn that each tiny particle or molecule\r\nthroughout the bar is a magnet by itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT A LODESTONE IS\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of a complete electro magnet. The magnet is attached\r\nto the arm of a crane by the loop in the center and when the magnet\r\nthen comes in contact with any kind of iron or steel it lifts it as\r\nsoon as the current is turned on. By making the electric current\r\nstronger, greater weight can be lifted. Many tons of material can be\r\nlifted at one time. An electro magnet will do the work of many men at\r\nmuch less cost.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In this picture we see the magnet lifting a great weight\r\nof miscellaneous pieces of scrap iron. As many as twenty tons can be\r\nlifted and transferred from one place to another at one time.]\r\n\r\nSome things can be magnetized while others cannot. Many substances have\r\nnot the property of magnetizing other substances when they have once\r\nbeen attracted by a magnet. These are called magnetic substances. They\r\nremain magnetized only as long as they are in touch with the magnet;\r\nother substances when once magnetized become permanent magnets. Steel\r\nand lodestone have this faculty. A compass needle is an artificial\r\nmagnet which becomes a permanent magnet when rubbed with a magnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Electricity?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you pass a hard rubber comb through your hair, in frosty weather, a\r\ncrackling sound is produced, and the individual hairs show a tendency\r\nto stick to the comb. After being drawn through your hair a few times,\r\nyou may notice that the comb has become charged with electricity. This\r\nelectricity is produced by friction. Not only rubber but many other\r\nsubstances become electrified by friction, such as a bar of sealing\r\nwax rubbed with flannel, or a glass rod rubbed with silk, will show\r\nthe same qualities, and these simple experiments teach us many of the\r\nfundamental facts about electricity.\r\n\r\nSome simple experiments will be found instructive and interesting. Rub\r\nwith flannel a stick of sealing wax until it is electrified and then\r\nbring it close to a pith ball which should be hung by a silk thread.\r\nThe pith ball will at once be attracted to the sealing wax, and, if\r\nbrought quite close, the ball will adhere to the wax for a few moments,\r\nand then fly away from it. The ball will now be repelled by the sealing\r\nwax instead of being drawn toward it. Now take a glass rod, rub it with\r\na silk cloth after drying it thoroughly. When the pith ball is brought\r\nclose to the glass rod it also will at first be attracted toward the\r\nglass and, if brought in contact with the glass, the pith ball will\r\nadhere as before. It will also then fly away in the same way it did\r\nfrom the sealing wax. Repeat these experiments with the sealing wax now\r\nand you will find the ball will be attached, as it was at first, but if\r\nit touches the wax it will again adhere for a moment and then fly away.\r\nBy using the sealing wax and glass rod alternately and bringing them\r\ninto contact with the pith ball, you discover that when it is attracted\r\nby one, it is repelled by the other, and that, after it has been in\r\ncontact with either for a few moments it is no longer attracted by it.\r\n\r\nWe learn thus that the electricity in the glass and the sealing wax\r\nare not the same. To distinguish the two kinds of attraction, we say\r\nthe glass is charged with positive, or vitreous electricity, while the\r\ncharge on the sealing wax is called negative, or resinous electricity.\r\n\r\nWhen the pith ball was touched with the sealing wax, it became filled\r\nwith negative electricity, and was then no longer attracted by the\r\nwax, but was repelled by it and attracted by the glass rod; but when\r\nthe ball had been filled with positive electricity, it was repelled by\r\nthe glass and attracted by the wax. We conclude from these facts that\r\nbodies filled with the same kind of electricity repel each other, while\r\nbodies filled with opposite kinds of electricity attract each other.\r\n\r\nWhen two substances are charged, as we say, with electricity of\r\nopposite kinds and are brought into contact, and left so for some time,\r\nthe two charges disappear, one appearing to neutralize the other. From\r\nthis, we conclude, and rightly, that any substance not electrified,\r\ncontains equal amounts both positive and negative electricity. When,\r\ntherefore, we rub a piece of glass with silk, we are not creating\r\nelectricity, but only separating the different kinds. The positive\r\nelectricity adheres to the glass, and the negative remains behind,\r\non the silk. In the same manner, when we electrify sealing wax with\r\nflannel the negative kind remains in the sealing wax and the flannel\r\nbecomes charged with the positive. Whenever a body is electrified by\r\nfriction, both kinds of electricity are produced; it is impossible to\r\nproduce one kind without the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT ELECTRICITY IS\r\n\r\nMagnets are particularly valuable in lifting raw material in a steel\r\nmill. The red-hot pig-iron, from which steel is made, can be handled\r\neasily in this way, whereas it would be impossible to handle same by\r\nhand. Sometimes great quantities of iron are broken up by the magnet. A\r\nweight of many tons is lifted by the magnet and allowed to fall on the\r\nmaterial to be broken up. The weight falls as soon as the current is\r\nturned off.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Weight of wheel, 8160 lbs.\r\n\r\nPieces of machinery which cannot be lifted by men on account of their\r\ngreat weight and shape are handled easily.]\r\n\r\nYou must rub the entire glass rod or bar of sealing wax to electrify\r\nthe whole of it. If only a part of the glass rod or sealing wax is\r\nrubbed, only that part becomes electrified, as may be shown by trying\r\nto attract a pith ball with the part that has not been rubbed.\r\n\r\n~WHAT GOOD AND BAD CONDUCTORS OF ELECTRICITY ARE~\r\n\r\nIf, however, the charged part of the sealing wax is brought into\r\ncontact with a metal rod resting on, say, a drinking glass, the rod\r\nbecomes charged, not only where it is brought into contact, but all\r\nover its surface. Substances over which electricity flows readily\r\nare called conductors of electricity. All metals are of this kind.\r\nThings like glass and sealing wax over which electricity does not flow\r\nreadily, are called non-conductors, or insulators. Water, the human\r\nbody, and the earth are good conductors and rubber, porcelain, most\r\nresins, and dry air are non-conductors.\r\n\r\nYou have already learned that substances charged with opposite kinds of\r\nelectricity attract each other, and substances charged with the same\r\nkind repel each other. We will try to discover why substances charged\r\nwith either kind of electricity attract small light objects, such as\r\npith balls, when these latter are not charged with electricity. As we\r\nhave discovered, all substances which have remained undisturbed have\r\nboth kinds of electricity present in them, in equal amounts. Now, when\r\nan uncharged body is brought near a charged body, the two kinds of\r\nelectricity in the uncharged body have a tendency to separate. The kind\r\nopposite in character, to that on the charged body, is attracted toward\r\nthe charged body, and the other kind is repelled. Thus, if our bar of\r\nsealing wax, charged with, let us say, negative electricity, is brought\r\nnear a pith ball, the positive electricity in the ball is attracted\r\nto the side nearest the scaling wax, and the negative electricity\r\nis repelled to the farther side. As the positive electricity on the\r\npith is nearer to the scaling wax than the negative, its attraction\r\nfor the negative charge, on the sealing wax, is stronger than the\r\nrepulsion between the negative electricities of the two objects, and\r\nconsequently, the ball is attracted to the sealing wax. If the charged\r\nsealing wax is brought near a good conductor, which is supported on\r\nsome non-conducting substance, such as glass, silk, or rubber, over\r\nwhich electricity will not flow, a much more complete separation of the\r\ntwo kinds of electricity occurs on the conductor than on the pith ball.\r\nIf the charged sealing wax is brought near one end of a metal rod so\r\nplaced, the charge of negative electricity upon the sealing wax will\r\nattract the positive electricity on the metal, to that end, and will\r\nrepel the negative electricity to the other end. When a pith ball, hung\r\nby the silk thread, is brought close to either end of the metal rod,\r\nwhen the charged sealing wax is near the other end, the pith ball will\r\nbe attracted toward the rod; but will not be attracted if placed close\r\nto the middle of the rod. This proves that the metal rod is electrified\r\nonly in the parts nearest to and farthest away from the charged body.\r\nThe two kinds of electricity neutralize each other at the parts in\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\nIf now we take two conductors and place them end to end, we have\r\nfor all practical purposes, a single conductor. It has the decided\r\nadvantage, however, of being easily separated into two parts. When an\r\nelectrified substance is brought close to one end of such a conductor,\r\na charge of one kind is attracted to the near portion of the conductor,\r\nand a charge of the opposite kind is repelled to the farther part. By\r\nseparating the two parts of the conductor, we learn that one of the\r\nends, which have been in contact, is charged with positive and the\r\nother with negative electricity.\r\n\r\nThis act of separating the two kinds of electricity upon a conductor by\r\nmeans of a charge upon another body which is not permitted to come into\r\ncontact with the conductor, is called induction, and two charges of\r\nelectricity produced in this way are known as induced charges.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways in which a charge of electricity may be induced\r\nupon a conductor. One end of the conductor may be connected with the\r\nearth by means of some good conducting material, and the charged\r\nsubstance brought close to the other end. A charge, opposite in\r\ncharacter to the initial charge, is attracted to the end of the\r\nconductor that is near the charged body, and the electricity of the\r\nopposite kind is repelled, through the conductor to the earth. By\r\nsecuring the connection with the earth, while the charged body is\r\nnear the conductor, a charge is obtained upon the conductor, that is\r\nopposite in character to the initial charge. This method of charging\r\nconductors, by induction, is practically the same as the one first\r\ndescribed, for the earth is a conductor of electricity, and corresponds\r\nto the more distant part of the two-piece conductor.\r\n\r\nAn instrument, known as the electrophorus, is especially designed for\r\nthe production of electric charges by induction in the manner just\r\ndescribed. This instrument consists of a brass plate, on an insulating\r\nhandle of glass, and a disk of sealing wax, fitted into a brass dish,\r\nwhose edges rise somewhat higher than the surface of the wax. In using\r\nthe electrophorus the brass dish, or sole, is placed upon some support\r\nthat will conduct electricity, and the sealing wax disk is then rubbed\r\nvigorously with a piece of flannel, or catskin, which electrifies the\r\nsealing wax, with negative electricity. The brass plate is then taken\r\nby the glass handle and brought close to the charged sealing wax. The\r\ncharge of negative electricity on the wax attracts a charge of positive\r\nelectricity to the under surface of the plate and repels a negative\r\ncharge to its upper surface. If the charged plate is now brought into\r\ncontact with the edge of the brass dish the negative charge, on the\r\nback of the plate, flows away, through the legs of the dish, to the\r\nearth, but the positive charge remains on the under surface, where\r\nit is bound, by the attraction of the negative charge on the disk of\r\nsealing wax. If the brass plate is now removed, it will be found to be\r\ncharged with positive electricity.\r\n\r\nThe negative charge upon the sealing wax is not reduced or diminished\r\nby its action in charging the brass plate, and it is possible to charge\r\nthe plate an indefinite number of times by means of one charge on the\r\nsealing wax.\r\n\r\nThe charges of electricity, produced in any of the ways that have been\r\ndescribed, are necessarily small, and the disturbance produced, when\r\nthey are destroyed by bringing oppositely charged conductors together,\r\nis very slight, merely a little snapping noise and, perhaps, a small\r\nspark, that seems to leap from the positively charged conductor to\r\nthe negatively charged one, when they come very close together. By\r\nthe use of electrical machines of various kinds, in some of which\r\nthe electricity is produced by friction, and in others by induction,\r\nconductors may be charged with much larger quantities of electricity,\r\nand the disturbance produced by their discharge is greatly increased.\r\nThe noise produced is louder and the spark much brighter, and leaps\r\nfrom one conductor to the other, while they are much farther apart.\r\nIt is possible to produce still larger charges of electricity upon\r\nconductors if they are arranged so as to form what are called\r\ncondensers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is a Leyden Jar?\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest forms of condenser is the Leyden jar, which is so\r\nnamed because it was invented at Leyden, in Holland. This is a glass\r\njar, upon the outside of which is fastened a coating of tinfoil, that\r\ncovers the bottom of the jar and extends two-thirds of the way up\r\nthe sides. Inside the jar there is a similar coating of tinfoil, and\r\nthrough the top of the jar, which is usually made of wood, extends a\r\nmetal rod. On the upper end of the rod, there is a metal ball, and, at\r\nthe lower end, is attached a chain which runs down to the bottom of the\r\njar and rests upon the inner tinfoil coating.\r\n\r\nIn using the Leyden jar, the ball on the metal rod that runs through\r\nthe top of the jar is connected with an electrical machine, and the jar\r\nis supported upon some conducting material, through which electricity\r\nmay be conveyed from the outer coating of tinfoil to the earth. If the\r\ninner coating of tinfoil is now charged with positive electricity, by\r\nmeans of the electrical machine, it induces, upon the outer coating\r\nof foil, a charge of negative electricity, which is bound by the\r\nattraction of the positive charge on the inside of the jar. At the\r\nsame time, the positive electricity, on the outer coating of foil, is\r\nrepelled, through the conducting support, to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe charge that can be communicated to the coating of the foil, inside\r\nthe Leyden jar, is greatly increased by the presence of a charge of the\r\nopposite kind of electricity, on the coating on the outside of the jar.\r\nEach of these charges attracts the other, through the glass of the jar,\r\nand serves to bind or hold it. If either coating of foil is removed,\r\nthe charge on the other coating tends to fly off the tinfoil, and will\r\nimmediately do so, if a conductor is brought near. It is because the\r\nnegative effects of the initial charge, inside the jar, and of the\r\ninduced charge outside the jar, make it possible to communicate, to\r\neach coating of foil, a larger charge than it could otherwise be made\r\nto receive, that a Leyden jar is called a condenser.\r\n\r\nWhen a Leyden jar is disconnected from the electrical machine, two\r\nopposite charges of electricity are present on it, one inside and the\r\nother on the outside. If the two coats of tinfoil are now connected, by\r\nmeans of a condenser, they will at once neutralize each other, and the\r\njar will be discharged. A jar may be discharged, by simply taking hold\r\nof the tinfoil on the outside of the jar, with one hand, and touching\r\nthe metal rod, running through the top of the jar, with the other.\r\nIf you do this, there will be a sudden flow of electricity through\r\nyour body, your muscles will give a sudden jerk, and you will feel a\r\npeculiar tingling sensation. In other words, you will have received a\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, for the hand that does not grasp the jar, actually\r\nto touch the rod that runs through the top. If the hand is brought\r\ntoward the rod, rather slowly, you will see a spark leap across the\r\nspace between the rod and your hand, while your hand is still some\r\ndistance from the rod. The greater the distance, across which the spark\r\nleaps, the brighter will be the spark, and the stronger the shock\r\nproduced. This distance is sometimes spoken of as the length of the\r\nspark, and it indicates the size of the charges on the tinfoil coatings\r\nof the jar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Discovered Electricity?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may seem difficult to believe, that the tiny spark and weak snapping\r\nnoise that are produced when a Leyden jar is discharged, are, in many\r\nrespects, the same as lightning and thunder, but it is nevertheless\r\ntrue. This was proved by Benjamin Franklin, about the middle of the\r\n18th century, in the following way. One afternoon, when a thunder\r\nshower was approaching, he sent up a kite, to the string of which he\r\nfastened a large metal key; and to the key, a ribbon of non-conducting\r\nsilk, which he held in his hand. When the rain had been falling long\r\nenough to wet the string thoroughly, it become a good conductor of\r\nelectricity, and Franklin found that the key had become charged with\r\nelectricity transmitted from the clouds, along the wet kite string.\r\nThe non-conducting silk ribbon, that formed the continuation of the\r\nkite string, from the key to his hand, was employed to prevent him from\r\nreceiving shocks from the passage of the electricity, through his body,\r\nto the earth.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, your attention has been directed in charges of\r\nelectricity. You have been told how they may be produced, what some of\r\ntheir leading properties are, and what effects they produce, when they\r\nare discharged. The subject that will now be explained to you is that\r\nof electric currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is an Electric Current?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy an electric current, is meant a flow of electricity along a\r\nconductor. The flow of electricity, through your body, when you receive\r\nan electric shock, is a current, but it lasts only for an instant, and\r\nit is difficult to learn much about its nature. By the use of various\r\ndevices, it is possible to produce currents, that will continue as long\r\nas we want them, so that we are enabled to study their properties quite\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest and simplest forms of apparatus, for producing\r\nelectric currents, is that which is known as the voltaic cell. This\r\nform of apparatus may very easily be constructed. Pour some water into\r\na glass jar, and add a little sulphuric acid. Now place in the water a\r\nstrip of clean zinc and one of clean copper. Do not let the strips of\r\nmetal touch in the water, but connect them outside the water by means\r\nof a piece of wire. When this has been done, a current of electricity\r\nwill be sent up along the wire and through the water between the two\r\nstrips of zinc and copper. This current is said to flow along the wire\r\nfrom the copper, which is called the positive pole of the cell, to the\r\nzinc, which is called the negative pole. In the liquid in the cell\r\n(i.e., the jar), the current travels from the zinc to the copper, thus\r\ncompleting what is called the electric circuit. Whenever the circuit it\r\nbroken, that is, whenever there is a gap made in the wire connecting\r\nthe poles, or anything else is done to destroy the completeness\r\nof the path, along which the current travels, the current ceases;\r\nconsequently, when it is desirable to stop the current, all that is\r\nnecessary is to cut the wire connecting the two strips of copper and\r\nzinc.\r\n\r\nThe production of a current of electricity, by means of an apparatus of\r\nthis sort, depends upon the chemical action of the acid in the water\r\nupon the strip of zinc. As long as the acid continues to act upon\r\nthe zinc, the current is produced, and when the acid ceases to act\r\nupon the zinc, the current ceases to flow. If the zinc is clean, the\r\nchemical action of the acid ceases, whenever the circuit is broken, and\r\nconsequently, when the cell is not being used to produce a current,\r\nthe zinc is not destroyed by the acid. But if the zinc is not clean,\r\nsmall electric currents are set up, within the liquid, between the\r\nzinc and the impurities on its surface, and around the points where\r\nthese impurities lie the acid acts upon the zinc and dissolves it. This\r\naction of the acid upon the zinc, when the circuit is broken, is known\r\nas local action, and it is very desirable to prevent it, as far as\r\npossible. For this purpose the zinc is often rubbed with mercury, which\r\nsoaks into the zinc and forms a film on its surface, upon which the\r\nimpurities float. This treatment of the zinc is known as amalgamation,\r\nand it serves to prevent almost all the local action, due to impurities\r\nof the zinc.\r\n\r\nMany other substances, besides zinc and copper, have been found capable\r\nof yielding an electric current, when placed in a suitable liquid, and\r\nmany other fluids, besides water that contains a little sulphuric acid,\r\nhave been employed to act upon the zinc and copper, or the substances\r\nused in their stead. Numerous cells of different kinds have, therefore,\r\nbeen devised, but, in all of them, the current is produced by chemical\r\naction. Most of them contain a liquid of some sort, which is called the\r\nexciting fluid, and two solid substances, which are called the elements\r\nof the cell. One of these elements is always much more susceptible to\r\nthe chemical action of the exciting fluid, than the other, and this one\r\nis known as the positive element. The other element, upon which the\r\nexciting fluid may have no action, is called the negative element. In\r\ncells in which the elements are zinc and copper, the zinc is always the\r\npositive element. This may seem strange to you, for you have already\r\nlearned that the zinc is the negative pole of the cell, but, to avoid\r\nconfusion, you must fix well in your mind the fact that the zinc is\r\nnot the positive element of a voltaic cell, but its negative pole,\r\nand that the copper, which forms the negative element is the positive\r\npole of the cell. The currents produced by the various forms of voltaic\r\ncells, vary considerably in strength, but none of them are very strong.\r\nIn order to obtain a stronger current, a number of cells must be used\r\ntogether. Such a collection of cells forms a voltaic battery, and in\r\nsome instances, as many as fifty thousand cells have been used in a\r\nsingle battery.\r\n\r\nWe have already learned in our study of water that it may be separated\r\ninto its elementary gases by sending an electric current through it.\r\nThe effect is a chemical one. Water, however, is not the only substance\r\nthat is decomposed by electricity; almost all chemical compounds may be\r\ndecomposed by the passage of a current through them, provided a current\r\nof sufficient strength is used.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of the current is its heating effect. It has been found\r\nthat the passage of an electric current, through any body, is always\r\nproductive of a certain amount of heat. The amount of heat produced\r\ndepends upon the strength of the current of electricity, and the\r\nresistance to its passage that is offered by the body through which it\r\ntravels. This amount is increased by increasing either the strength of\r\nthe current or the resistance of the conductor along which it travels.\r\nWe have already learned, that some substances allow electricity to\r\npass over them very readily, and are therefore called conductors,\r\nwhile substances through which electricity does not flow readily are\r\nknown as non-conductors. No substance is a perfect non-conductor, for\r\nelectricity can be made to pass through any substance, if the current\r\nis sufficiently powerful. Neither is any substance a perfect conductor,\r\nfor all substances offer some resistance to the passage of an electric\r\ncurrent. Those substances that are ordinarily considered good\r\nconductors offer varying degrees of resistance to electric currents.\r\nFor example, a copper wire offers less resistance than an iron wire of\r\nthe same length and diameter.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of a body depends not only upon its material, but also\r\nupon its length and size. In conductors of the same material, the\r\nresistance is directly proportional to the length of the conductor,\r\nand inversely proportional to the square of its diameter. This is not\r\nsurprising, for an electric current bears a strong resemblance to a\r\ncurrent of water, in many of its properties, and you know that it is\r\nharder to force water through long, narrow pipes, than through short,\r\nwide ones.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated about resistance, you may see, that a current\r\nwill produce more heat, in passing through a long fine wire, than\r\nthrough a shorter and thicker one, and that, of two conductors of the\r\nsame length and size, but of different material, one may be heated much\r\nmore by a current than will another.\r\n\r\n~HOW MAGNETS ARE MADE~\r\n\r\nA third effect of the electric current, which has not previously been\r\nmentioned is its magnetizing effect. It is upon this, that some of the\r\nmost important effects of electricity depend.\r\n\r\nBy coiling a wire around a bar of iron or steel, and then sending an\r\nelectric current through it, the piece of iron, or steel, is made to\r\nshow magnetic properties. By this is meant, as you doubtless know, that\r\nthe iron will now attract other pieces of iron, or steel, to it. The\r\nstrength of this attraction depends upon the strength of the current,\r\nand upon the number of turns of wire around the bar. By increasing\r\neither the strength of the current, or the number of turns in the\r\ncoil of wire, around the bar of iron, the strength of its magnetic\r\nattraction is increased. When the current is stopped, the magnetic\r\nproperties of the iron disappear almost completely. A magnet, that\r\ndepends upon a current of electricity for its magnetic power, is called\r\nan electro-magnet.\r\n\r\nBesides electro-magnets there are others, which are called permanent\r\nmagnets. Electro-magnets are composed of soft iron, the softer the\r\nbetter, and, as soon as the current of electricity ceases to flow\r\naround them, their magnetic properties disappear. Permanent magnets,\r\non the contrary, are made of steel, and their magnetism is independent\r\nof the action of a current of electricity. No coil of wire is wound\r\naround them, and no current is employed to maintain their magnetic\r\nproperties. A piece of steel may be made to become a permanent magnet,\r\nby passing a current of electricity, for a considerable time, through\r\na coil of wire wound around it, or by allowing a piece of steel to\r\nremain for some time in contact with a strong magnet. When a current of\r\nelectricity passes through a coil of wire, wound around a bar of steel,\r\nit takes longer to magnetize the steel than it would to magnetize iron,\r\nbut, when the current ceases, the magnetism does not all disappear from\r\nthe steel. A portion of it remains, and the steel becomes permanently\r\nmagnetic.\r\n\r\nIf a thin bar of steel is magnetized, and is then suspended by its\r\nmiddle, so that it can spring freely, it will be found that one end\r\ntends to point toward the north, and the other toward the south.\r\nWhenever the bar is swung out of this position, it swings back to it,\r\nand if the north end is turned entirely around to the south, it does\r\nnot remain, but swings back to its former position. This shows that\r\nthere is a difference in the magnetism at the two ends of the magnet.\r\nTo indicate this difference, the north-seeking end of a magnet is\r\ncalled the positive pole of the magnet, and the south-seeking end is\r\nknown as the negative pole.\r\n\r\nBy suspending two bar magnets, in the manner described, it can be shown\r\nthat the positive and negative poles of the magnets act like positive\r\nand negative charges of electricity. Poles of the same kind repel, and\r\npoles of opposite kinds attract, each other.\r\n\r\nPermanent magnets are usually made in two forms, either straight\r\nor horseshoe shaped. A compass needle, as has been shown, is an\r\nexample of a straight magnet. The horseshoe variety, which has a\r\nlittle bar of iron, called the keeper, laid across the poles is a\r\ncommon toy. Electro-magnets are seldom seen, except in electrical\r\ninstruments or machinery. The pictures shown on the following pages\r\ngive us a bird’s-eye view of some of the wonders performed by these\r\nelectro-magnets. Tons and tons of material are picked up and held\r\nsecurely by one of these magnets as easily as you can hold on to an\r\napple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does a Bee Have a Sting?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bee’s sting is given him as a weapon of defence. Primarily it is\r\nfor the sole purpose of enabling him to help defend the hive from his\r\nenemies. Sometimes when he is attacked away from the hive he uses his\r\nsting to defend himself. When he does so, he injects a little quantity\r\nof poison through the sting and that is what causes the inflammation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does a Honey Bee Live?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bee lives in swarms of from 10,000 to 50,000 in one house. In the\r\nwild state the house or hive is located in a hollow tree generally.\r\nThese swarms contain three classes of bees, the perfect females or\r\nqueen bees, the males or drones, and the imperfectly developed females,\r\nor working bees. In each hive or swarm there is only one perfect female\r\nor queen whose sole mission is to propagate the species. The queen is\r\nmuch larger than the other bees. When she dies a young working bee\r\nthree days old is selected as the new queen. Her cell is enlarged by\r\nbreaking down the partitions, her food is changed to “royal jelly\r\nor paste” and she grows into a queen bee. The queen lays 2,000 eggs\r\nper day. The drones do not work and after performing their duty as\r\nmales are killed by the working bees. The female bees do the work of\r\ngathering the honey. They collect the honey from the flowers, they\r\nbuild the wax cells, and feed the young bees. When a colony becomes\r\noverstocked, a new colony is sent out to establish a new hive under the\r\ndirection of a queen bee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF A STEAMSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Probably no form of construction is so interesting to\r\neveryone as the construction of a huge steamer, a wonderful “city”\r\nafloat, with its thousands of passengers, its thousand officers and\r\ncrew, the tremendous stores of provisions and water, and the precision\r\nwith which the great ship plows its way from one shore to the other.\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the first work in building a modern steamer, laying\r\nthe keel and center plate, upon which the massive hull is constructed.\r\nThe rivets are driven by hydraulic power, noiselessly but firmly. In\r\nthe new “Britannic”--largest of all British steamers and the newest\r\n(1915) modern leviathan--over 270 tons of rivets--nearly three million\r\nin all--were required to give staunchness to the steel-plated hull.

As many decks are necessary to provide the\r\nrequired space for state-rooms, public apartments, promenades, etc.,\r\nseveral passenger elevators have been installed, which are a great\r\nconvenience for those who find the use of stairs irksome. There is\r\na fully equipped Gymnasium, a children’s Play Room for the younger\r\npassengers, a Squash Racquet Court, a Swimming Pool with sea-water, and\r\nthe Turkish Bath establishment.\r\n\r\nThere are accommodations for over 2500 passengers as well as a crew of\r\n950. The view shows how the ship is divided into numerous water-tight\r\ncompartments, so that should several of these sections become flooded\r\nthe rest of the ship would remain intact.\r\n\r\nThe lifeboats, of which there are sufficient to carry all on board, are\r\nhandled by a new device, by means of which the boats can be launched,\r\nwhen filled, with greater ease and safety than hitherto. Each of the\r\ngreat davits can handle several boats and they are long enough to carry\r\nthe boats clear of the side of the ship, should any accident cause her\r\nto list to one side.\r\n\r\nThe “Britannic” is nearly 900 feet in length, and with her gross\r\ntonnage of 50,000 is the largest British steamer in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Water Made Of?\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery kind of substance in the world is made up of tiny portions, each\r\nof which is distinctly just what the whole mass is, but which are so\r\nsmall you cannot see them. A pile of sand, or a cupful of sugar or salt\r\nconsists of a great many small grains. A cup of water too is made up of\r\nwhat we would call small grains of water, or what we would call grains\r\nof water if we could think of them in the same way as we do sugar or\r\nsalt or sand. These particles are so small that they could not be seen\r\nseparately, even if the particles did not have the ability to stick so\r\nclose together that we could not distinguish them even if they were\r\nlarge enough to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe word used in describing these tiny particles in any substance,\r\nwater, sugar, sand, salt or anything else is molecule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is a Molecule?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word molecule means “smallest mass,” which indicates the very\r\nsmallest division that can be made of any substance without destroying\r\nits identity. Every substance is made up of molecules, and in many\r\ncases the molecules of one substance will mix with those of another\r\nsubstance, while in other cases they will not. When you dissolve sugar\r\nin water or melt lead or change water into steam, the physical body of\r\nthe substance is changed, but the molecules remain as they were. They\r\nare only changed in so far as their relations to each other and to\r\nthose of another substance are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do We Know a Thing Is Solid, Liquid or Gas?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relations of the molecules in any substance to each other is what\r\ndetermines whether a substance is a solid, a liquid or a gas. A gas is\r\na substance in which the molecules are constantly moving rapidly about\r\namong each other, but always in straight lines. A liquid substance is\r\none in which the molecules are also constantly moving about but which\r\ndo not move in straight lines. Solids are substances in which the\r\nmolecules stick together in one position by the power of cohesion which\r\nthey have. Cohesion means the power of sticking together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Big Is a Molecule?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not as yet know all there is to be learned about molecules. We\r\nknow through the wonders of chemistry that small as a molecule is, it\r\nis still made up of smaller particles called atoms. An atom is the\r\nsmallest division of anything that can be imagined. We have found by\r\nchemistry that even a molecule is capable of being divided, i.e., it\r\nis made up of still smaller particles, but molecules are small enough.\r\nAn eminent scientist, Sir William Thomson, has given us probably the\r\nnearest approach to a correct way of saying something of the size of a\r\nmolecule. “If a drop of water were magnified to the size of the earth,\r\nthe molecules would each occupy spaces greater than those filled by\r\nsmall shot and smaller than those occupied by cricket balls.”\r\n\r\nTo get at what water is made of we must separate it through chemistry\r\ninto its parts or atoms. When we do this we find that a molecule of\r\nwater is made of three atoms or parts. Two of these are exactly alike\r\nand consist of a gas called hydrogen, and the other part is another\r\ngas called oxygen, concerning which gases we have already learned\r\nmuch in the answers to other questions in this book. In other words,\r\nwhen we separate water, which is a liquid, into its parts, we change\r\nthe relations of the molecules in the water which move in irregular\r\nlines, into parts which move in straight lines and, when the molecules\r\nof a substance, as we have already seen, move in straight lines, the\r\nsubstance becomes a gas. On the other hand, when you freeze water, it\r\nbecomes a solid (ice), and in doing that you fix the molecules in the\r\nwater so that they stick to each other.\r\n\r\nMen thought for a long time that water was an element like oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, i. e., that its molecules could not be separated in its\r\nparts and was, therefore, considered one of the things which could not\r\nbe divided up, but this was due to the fact that it requires a great\r\namount of power to break up the molecules of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is an Element?\r\n\r\n\r\nAn element is any substance whose molecules cannot be broken up and\r\nmade to form other substances. You can take one or more elements and\r\nmake a compound, which is what water is. A compound is a substance in\r\nwhich the molecules are made up of at least two kinds of elements or\r\nelementary substances.\r\n\r\n~THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ELEMENTS AND COMPOUNDS~\r\n\r\nThe things we find in the world are known as either compounds or\r\nelements. An element, as we have already learned, is something in\r\nwhich the molecules cannot be broken up. A compound is, therefore, a\r\nsubstance in which the molecules are made of molecules of one or more\r\nelements and is either gas, liquid or solid, according to the relations\r\nwhich these molecules have to each other. We have so far discovered\r\nless than eighty real elements in the world, although since we find\r\na new one every little while, there are probably many more as yet\r\nundiscovered.\r\n\r\nNot all elements are gases, of course. Solids like copper, gold,\r\niron, lead and a number of others are elements. Among liquids we have\r\nmercury, and of the gases we find hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen,\r\nwhich are the three wonderful gases about which we are about to learn\r\nsomething, and these three are also the world’s most important gases.\r\nAmmonia is an element, but, while we think of it as a liquid, the real\r\nammonia is really a gas. Our household ammonia is really a compound of\r\nammonia with something else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Hydrogen Gas?\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrogen is one of the elementary substances in the form of a gas. It\r\nhas no color or taste or odor, so we can neither see, smell nor taste\r\nit. It is the lightest substance known to the world. We have by the aid\r\nof chemistry been able to catch and retain it in sufficient quantities\r\nto weigh it and have found it to be lighter than anything else in\r\nthe world. It is soluble in water and some other liquids, but only\r\nslightly so. It refracts light very strongly and will absorb in a very\r\nremarkable manner with some metals when they are heated. It burns with\r\na beautiful blue flame and very great heat. When burned it combines\r\nwith oxygen in the air and forms water. Hydrogen is not poisonous but,\r\nif inhaled, it prevents the blood from securing oxygen, and so the\r\ninhaling of hydrogen will cause death. Hydrogen is not found free in\r\nthe air except in small quantities like oxygen and nitrogen and is,\r\ntherefore, secured by separating compounds by known methods. It can be\r\nsecured by the action which diluted sulphuric acid has on zinc or iron,\r\nby passing steam through a red-hot tube filled with iron trimmings, by\r\npassing an electric current through water and in other ways. Hydrogen\r\nis absolutely necessary to every form of animal or vegetable structure.\r\nIt is found in all acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Oxygen?\r\n\r\n\r\nOxygen was discovered in 1774. It is an elementary substance in\r\nthe form of a gas which is found free in the air. It is colorless,\r\ntasteless and odorless and, like hydrogen, cannot therefore be seen,\r\ntasted or smelled. It is soluble in water and combines very readily\r\nwith most of the elements. In most cases when oxygen combines with\r\nother things the process of combining is so rapid that light and\r\nheat are produced--this combination is called combustion. Where the\r\nprocess of combining with other substances acts slowly the heat and\r\nlight produced at one time are not enough to be noticed. Where metals\r\ntarnish or rust or animal or vegetable substances decay, the same\r\nthing chemically is taking place as when you light a fire and produce\r\nlight or heat--you are making the oxygen combine with the substance\r\nin the material which is burning. When iron is rusting or vegetables\r\ndecaying, the action is so slow that no heat or light is produced, but\r\nthe result is the same if some outside force does not stop the action.\r\nThe fire will burn until everything burnable which it can reach is\r\nburned out, and in the case of the piece of iron rusting, the action\r\nwill go on slowly until the whole piece of iron is destroyed--or burned\r\nout. Like hydrogen, no vegetable or animal life can live without oxygen\r\ncontinually given it. Oxygen will destroy life and will sustain it.\r\n\r\nAll of our body heat and muscular energy are produced by slow\r\ncombustion going on in all parts of the body, of oxygen carried in\r\nthe blood after it enters the lungs. In sunlight oxygen is exhaled by\r\ngrowing plants.\r\n\r\nOxygen is the most widely distributed and abundant element in nature.\r\nIt amounts to about one-fifth of the volume of the air belt of the\r\nearth; about ninety per cent of all the weight of water is oxygen. The\r\nrocks of the earth contain about fifty per cent of oxygen and it is\r\nfound in most animal and vegetable products and in acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Nitrogen?\r\n\r\n\r\nNitrogen is the third of the world’s wonderful and important gases.\r\nIt is also without color, taste or smell. It will not burn or help\r\nother substances to burn and it will not combine easily with any other\r\nelement. It will unite at a very high degree of heat with magnesium,\r\nsilica, and other metals. About 7.7 per cent of the weight of the air\r\nis nitrogen, so that it is a very important part of the air we breathe\r\nand it is absolutely necessary in making all animal and vegetable\r\ntissues. When united with hydrogen, it produces ammonia, and with\r\noxygen one of the most important acids--nitric acid. It is found free\r\nin the air and is thus easily secured. Nitrogen, while very important\r\nto all kinds of life, is known as the quiet gas. It stays quietly by\r\nitself unless forced to combine under great power with other things,\r\nand, even under those conditions, will combine rarely. We find a good\r\ndeal of nitrogen in the blood but, while we need the nitrogen which is\r\nfound in the blood, it does nothing particularly to the blood or the\r\nrest of the body. The nitrogen which the body uses is valuable to the\r\nbody only when found in a compound. This nitrogen which the body needs\r\nis secured through vegetable products such as the wheat from which our\r\nbread is made, and which are said to secure their nitrogen through\r\nthe aid of microbes which are able to force the nitrogen of the air\r\ninto a compound. Some day perhaps we shall know all there is to know\r\nabout nitrogen, which is the least known of these three wonderful and\r\nnecessary gases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Some Things Transparent and Others Not?\r\n\r\n\r\nTransparency is produced by the way rays of light go through substances\r\nor not. When light strikes a substance that is almost perfectly\r\ntransparent, it means that the rays of light go through it almost\r\nexactly as they come in. We think quickly of glass when we think of\r\nsomething readily transparent. Water is almost equally as transparent.\r\nWhen the sunlight is shining on one side of a pane of ordinary window\r\nglass, it causes every thing on that side of the window to reflect the\r\nlight which strikes it in all directions. When these rays of light\r\nstrike the window pane, they go right through and that is how we are\r\nable to see the trees and grass and everything else through a clear\r\nwindow pane. The same reason applies also to the water.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of window glass (the frosted kind) we cannot see\r\nthrough--they are not transparent. The surface of a frosted window pane\r\nis so made that when the light rays strike it the rays are twisted and\r\nbroken, and do not come through as they entered the glass.\r\n\r\nSometimes the water is almost perfectly transparent. When water is\r\nperfectly clear, it is quite transparent. When you look at or into\r\nwater that is not transparent, you will know that there are particles\r\nof solid matter floating about in it which twist and mix the light\r\nrays. If the water is not too deep you can see the bottom sometimes\r\neven when there are some particles of solid substances floating about\r\nin it, but the deeper the water the more of these solid particles there\r\nare generally in it, so that it is impossible in most waters to see the\r\nbottom if the water is deep. In some places, however, the water is so\r\nfree from floating particles that the bottom of the ocean can be seen\r\nat quite considerable depths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is the Sea Water Salt?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll water that comes into the oceans by way of the rivers and other\r\nstreams contains salt. The amount is so very small for a given quantity\r\nof water that it cannot be tasted. But all this river water is poured\r\ninto the oceans eventually at some point. After it reaches the oceans,\r\nthe water is evaporated by the action of the sun. When the sun picks up\r\nthe water in the form of moisture, it does not take up any of the solid\r\nsubstances which the water contained as it came in from the rivers, and\r\nwhile there is about as much water in the ocean all the time and about\r\nas much also in the air in the form of moisture also, the ocean never\r\ngets fuller; the solid substances from the river waters keep piling\r\nup in the ocean and float about in the water there. The salt which is\r\nin the river water has been left behind by the sun when it evaporated\r\nthe water in the ocean for so long that the amount of salt has become\r\nvery noticeable. The moisture which the sun takes into the air from\r\nthe ocean is eventually turned back to the earth again in the form of\r\nrain. This process of evaporation and precipitation in the form of rain\r\nis going on all the time. When the water which is in the form of rain\r\nstrikes the earth, it is pure water. It sinks into the ground and on\r\nthe way picks up some salt, finds its way into a river sooner or later,\r\nand then evidently gets back into the ocean. All this time it has been\r\ncarrying the tiny bit of salt which it picked up in going through the\r\nground. But when it reaches the ocean again and is taken up by the\r\nsun, it leaves its salt behind and so the salt from countless drops of\r\nwater is constantly being left in the ocean as it goes up into the air.\r\nThis has been going on for countless ages and the amount of salt has\r\nbeen increasing in the ocean all the time, so that the sea is becoming\r\nsaltier and saltier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Salt Make Me Thirsty?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blood in our body contains about the same proportion of salt as the\r\nwater in the ocean normally. When the supply is normal we do not feel\r\nthat we have too much salt in our systems, but when you take salt into\r\nyour mouth the percentage of salt in the body is increased, and the\r\nbeing thirsty, or the desire to drink water afterwards is caused by the\r\ndemand of the human system that the salt be diluted. The system calls\r\nfor water or something to drink in order that it may counteract the too\r\ngreat percentage of salt in the system. Other things also, when taken\r\ninto the body in too great a proportion, cause us to become thirsty.\r\nThirst is merely nature’s demand for more water on account of the\r\nnecessity of reducing the percentage of some substance like salt, or\r\nmerely a necessity for having more water in the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are Diamonds Made Of?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe learned the definition of an element in our study of water and\r\nother substances. Many things which were at one time thought by our\r\nwisest men to be elements were later found to be compounds of other\r\nsubstances. Water is one of these which we have learned is really not\r\nan element at all, but compounded from two gaseous elements, hydrogen\r\nand oxygen.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important elements in the world is the one out of\r\nwhich diamonds are formed. Not because diamonds are so valuable, but\r\nbecause the element referred to, carbon, is found in every tissue of\r\nevery living thing, both animal and mineral. This carbon is one of the\r\nmost useful of all elements, but is found in and used by living things\r\nalways in combination with some other substance. Carbon is combustible,\r\nforming carbonic acid gas, from which the earth’s vegetation secures\r\nits necessary carbon, which is very great in amount.\r\n\r\nWhen heat is made to act in certain ways on the tissues of animal and\r\nvegetable life we get charcoal, lampblack and coke. Carbon will combine\r\nwith more other substances than any of the other known elements. Its\r\nwonders lie in the fact that under various treatments it produces\r\naltogether different looking things, although remaining as pure carbon.\r\nOur diamonds, for instance, are pure carbon, but our lead pencils,\r\nthat is, the part we write with, are also pure carbon, and the coal\r\nwe burn is carbon also. It would be hard to say which of these three\r\nforms of pure carbon is most valuable to the world. A great many rich\r\npeople might say diamonds, while the poor people would surely say\r\ncoal, especially if you asked them in winter, while the people who\r\nwrite books, and newspaper reporters, would probably say lead-pencils.\r\nHowever, it would be better to choose diamonds, for if you have them\r\nyou can always trade them for coal or lead-pencils. A very small\r\ndiamond will buy quite a lot of either coal or lead-pencils. Carbon is\r\none of the solid elements which are not metals. A great many of the\r\nimportant elements in the group of solids are metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes Dimples?\r\n\r\n\r\nA dimple is a dent or depression in the skin on a part of the body\r\nwhere the flesh is soft. The fibers which lay in the tissue under the\r\noutside skin help to hold the skin firm. These fibers which are, of\r\ncourse, small run in all directions and are of different lengths. Now\r\nand then these fibers will just happen to grow short in one spot or the\r\nother and pull the skin in, forming a little depression, but producing\r\na very pleasing effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does the Dark Cause Fear?\r\n\r\n\r\nFear is an instinct. We are by nature afraid of the things we do not\r\nknow all about. That is why knowledge is so valuable; when we know\r\nabout a thing we are sure of our ground. When we are where it is light\r\nwe can see what is there; when it is dark our imagination becomes\r\nactive and because we do not know for certain what is there in the dark\r\nbefore us, we imagine things.\r\n\r\nFear of the dark, however, cannot be said to be entirely natural. It\r\ncomes naturally only when we have come to the age when we begin to\r\nimagine things. Animals have no imaginative powers and they do not fear\r\nthe dark. Some people say that the fear of the dark is bred in us,\r\nbut little babies do not fear the dark. If they are properly trained\r\nthey will go to sleep in the dark and will prefer the dark. As they\r\ngrow older children begin to fear the dark, but that is because their\r\nimagination is coming to life and because parents so often make the\r\nmistake at this stage of training their children of either encouraging\r\nthe feeling of fear that darkness brings for the convenient means of\r\npunishment it provides through threatening to put the light out, or\r\nbecause they do not take the pains to show that there is no reason for\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nMost children who fear the darkness are really taught to do so\r\npermanently by parents or servants. When a boy or girl first begins to\r\nimagine things in the dark, many parents run quickly to the child and\r\nsay, “Don’t be afraid” or “There is nothing to be afraid of,” and in\r\ndoing this they perhaps mention the word “fear” for the first time.\r\nRepetition of this will always cause the child to associate the word\r\n“fear” with “darkness.” As a matter of fact when the boy or girl first\r\nshows fear of the darkness, parents should go to them and quiet their\r\nfears, but talk about anything else but fear and direct the child’s\r\nmind away from any thought of fear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT EGYPTIAN ROPE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Coil of Rope\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many have ever given a thought to the question of where rope comes\r\nfrom and how it is made, or realize what a variety of uses it is put\r\nto, and how dependent we are upon it in many of the everyday affairs\r\nof life? But let us suppose for a moment that the world were suddenly\r\ndeprived of its supply of this very commonplace material, and of its\r\nsmaller relatives, cords and twine. We should then begin to realize\r\nthe importance of a seemingly unimportant thing, and to appreciate the\r\ndifficulty in getting along without it.\r\n\r\nAncient civilized peoples had their ropes and cordage, made from\r\nsuch materials as were available in their respective countries. The\r\nEgyptians are said to have made rope from leather thongs, and our\r\nillustration will be found interesting in this connection. This is from\r\na sculpture taken from a tomb in Thebes of the time of the Pharaoh of\r\nthe Exodus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGYPTIANS MAKING ROPE.]\r\n\r\nWhile this scene is said by the best authority to represent the\r\npreparation of leather cords for use in lacing sandals, it has been\r\nsupposed by some to be a representation of rope making. In any event\r\nthe process is undoubtedly the same as that used in making rope.\r\n\r\nThe scene is depicted with the true Egyptian faculty for showing\r\ndetails, making words almost unnecessary to an understanding of their\r\npictorial records. We see the raw material in the shape of the hide,\r\nand also two well-made coils of the finished product. One of the\r\nworkmen is cutting a strand from a hide by revolving it and cutting as\r\nit turns. Any one who has not tried it will be surprised to see what a\r\ngood, even string can be cut from a piece of leather in this way.\r\n\r\nAnother man is arranging and paying out the thongs to a third, who is\r\nevidently walking backward in time-honored fashion, twisting as he goes.\r\n\r\nComing down to more recent times we find that rope-making had been\r\ngoing on for centuries with probably very little change, up to the time\r\nof the introduction of machinery and the establishment of the factory\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HACKLING.]\r\n\r\n~HOW ROPE WAS LONG MADE BY HAND~\r\n\r\nIn the early days to which we have referred, all the yarn for\r\nrope-making was spun by hand in the time-honored way. We are able to\r\nrepresent to our readers by the photographs shown, this now almost lost\r\nart. The material shown in the pictures is American hemp, which because\r\nthe earlier machines were not adapted to working this softer fiber,\r\ncontinued to be spun by hand long after manila was spun chiefly on\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE PHILIPINO SCRAPING THE FIBER FROM THE LEAF STOCK.]\r\n\r\nThe hemp was first hackled, as is also shown by our photograph, the\r\nhackle or “hechel” being simply a board having long, sharp steel teeth\r\nset into it. This combed out the tow or short, matted fiber, leaving\r\nthe clean, straight hemp. This “strike” of hemp the spinner wrapped\r\nabout his waist, bringing the ends around his back and tucking them\r\ninto his belt, thus keeping the material in place without knot or\r\ntwist, and allowing the fibers to pay out freely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING THE FIBER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE IN AN EGYPTIAN KITCHEN SHOWING USE OF A LARGE ROPE\r\nTO SUPPORT A SORT OF HANGING SHELF.]\r\n\r\nThe workman in our picture is Johnny Moores, an old-time expert\r\nhand-spinner, who can walk off backward from the wheel with his wad of\r\nhemp, spinning with each hand a thread as fine and even as can be asked\r\nfor. In the photograph, in order to show the process more clearly, one\r\nlarge yarn is being spun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD FASHIONED ROPE WALK\r\n\r\nHAND SPINNING.]\r\n\r\nThe large wheel, usually turned by a boy, is used to convey power to\r\nthe “whirls,” or small spindles carrying hooks upon which the fiber\r\nis fastened. These whirls, revolving, give the twist to the yarn as\r\nthe spinner deftly pays out the fiber, regulating it with skillful\r\nfingers to preserve the uniformity and proper size of the yarn. As he\r\ngoes backward down the long walk through the “squares of sunlight on\r\nthe floor” he throws the trailing yarns over the “stakes” placed at\r\nintervals along the walk for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe spinning “grounds” were usually arranged with wheels at either\r\nend, so that spinners reaching the farther end, could go back to their\r\nstarting point spinning another set of yarns.\r\n\r\nThen in the case of small ropes, the strands could be made by attaching\r\ntwo or more yarns to the “whirl” and twisting them together, reversing\r\nthe motion to give the strands a twist opposite to that given the\r\nyarns. These strands were twisted together, again reversing the motion,\r\nmaking a rope. Thus it will be seen that, reduced to its lowest terms,\r\nrope-making consists simply of a series of twisting processes. The\r\ntwisting of the yarns into the strand is known as “forming” or putting\r\nin the “foreturn.” The final process is “laying,” “closing” or putting\r\nin the “after turn.” Horse-power was used in old times for forming and\r\nlaying rope which was too large to be made by hand.\r\n\r\nHow all this work is now done in a modern rope factory by ingeniously\r\ndevised machinery we shall now see.\r\n\r\nThe opening room where the fiber is made ready for the preparation\r\nmachinery is a reminder of the days when all rope-making processes\r\nwere hand work. The bales are first opened up--in the case of Manila\r\nthis means cutting the straw matting put on to protect the fiber in\r\nshipment. Then the hanks which are packed in various ways--sometimes\r\ndoubled, sometimes twisted--are taken out and straightened and the band\r\nat the end of the hank removed.\r\n\r\nNo machinery has yet been perfected for doing the work just described\r\nbut the first of the preparation processes, a short step beyond, tells\r\nquite a different story. Here the hanks of such fibers as require a\r\nspecial cleaning treatment are placed on fast working hackling machines\r\nwhich comb away most of the snarls, loose tow and dirt.\r\n\r\nAt this point hard fibers--Manila, Sisal and New Zealand--are usually\r\noiled to soften them and to make them more workable for the operations\r\nthat follow. The oil, furthermore, acts as a preservative. It is a\r\nmatter of importance to the buyer, however, that the fiber should not\r\nbe too heavily oiled, for that merely increases the weight and cost of\r\nthe rope without improving its quality.\r\n\r\nThe wonder of modernism in rope-making is nowhere more striking than\r\nin the preparation room. To pass from one end, where the raw hemp is\r\nreceived just as it left the hands of the native Filipino laborer with\r\nhis crude methods, down through the long rows of machines to the draw\r\nframes from which the sliver is delivered in a form that can be likened\r\nto a stream of molten metal, is to cover decades of inventive genius\r\nand mechanical development.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism performs its work so accurately that at first glance the\r\nman feeding the fiber into the machine and all the other men, busy\r\nabout their various duties, would appear to be playing very minor parts\r\nin modern rope making. In reality, expert workmanship and watchfulness\r\nare very important factors. Good rope depends no more upon scientific\r\nmachine processes than upon ceaseless attention to the little details,\r\nand this is especially true in the preparation room.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the distinctly modern machines so largely used now\r\nin the final processes of rope-making--the forming of strands, laying\r\nof common ropes and closing of cable-laid goods--we will describe the\r\nrope-walk where much of this work is still best carried on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUGE BALES OF RAW ROPE MATERIAL\r\n\r\nMANILA HEMP IN WAREHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nFor making tarred goods in all but the smaller sizes the walk has\r\ncertain advantages not afforded by newer methods. It also provides\r\nefficient equipment for turning out the largest ropes, which would\r\notherwise require special machinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MODERN ROPE WALK\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF ROPE WALK, PLYMOUTH CORDAGE CO.]\r\n\r\nThe long alleys or grounds where the work takes place are usually laid\r\nout in pairs, one for forming, the other for laying and closing. Each\r\nground has a track to accommodate the machines used and an endless\r\nband-rope which conveys the power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEAR VIEW OF MACHINE IN ROPE WALK.]\r\n\r\n~HOW ROPE IS FORMED AND TWISTED~\r\n\r\nAt the head of the forming ground stand frames holding the bobbins of\r\nyarn. The yarns for each strand first pass through a plate perforated\r\nin concentric circles. This arrangement gives each yarn the correct\r\nangle of delivery into a tube where the whole mass gets a certain\r\namount of compression.\r\n\r\nAs the top truck is forced ahead by the twisting process, the ropemaker\r\nby means of greater or less leverage on the “tails”--the loose ropes\r\nshown in our picture--preserves a correct lay in the rope. The stakes\r\non which the strands rest are removed one by one to allow the top truck\r\nto pass, and then replaced to support the rope until the laying is\r\nfinished and the reeling in of the rope begun.\r\n\r\nThe closing process on cable-laid goods is like the laying except\r\nthat the twist is reversed. The work now being with three complete\r\nropes--frequently very large--a heavier top truck is necessary, and\r\nthis must often be ballasted, as shown in our illustration, to keep\r\ndown the vibration which would otherwise tend to lift the truck off the\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEAR VIEW OF MACHINE IN ROPE WALK.]\r\n\r\nModern rope-making ingenuity reaches its high-water mark in the\r\ncompound laying-machine where the two operations of forming the strands\r\nand laying them into a rope are combined. Up to a certain point this\r\nmethod is more economical than that in which the forming and laying are\r\nunconnected. Fewer machines are required for a given output--hence,\r\nless floor space and fewer workmen. The time-saving element also enters\r\nin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING THE FIBER IN ROPE MAKING\r\n\r\nOPENING BALES OF MANILA FIBER FOR PREPARATION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARATION ROOM.\r\n\r\nHere the fiber is carefully cleaned and combed by a series of fine\r\ntooth machinery through which it passes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNTLESS SLIVERS STREAM FROM THE ROPE MACHINE\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF SLIVER--FIRST BREAKER.\r\n\r\nThe hanks of fiber are fed by hand into this machine several at a\r\ntime, where it is grasped by steel pins fitted to a slowly revolving\r\nendless chain. A second set of pins moving more rapidly draws out the\r\nindividual fibers and combs them into a continuous form.\r\n\r\nThe operations which follow are very similar. A number of “ropings”\r\nare allowed to feed together into a first slowly revolving set of pins\r\nand are drawn out again by a high speed set into a smaller sliver, the\r\npins becoming finer on each succeeding machine until the draw frame is\r\nreached. Here the fiber is pulled from a single set of pins between two\r\nrapidly moving leather belts called aprons. On all of these machines\r\nthe fiber passes between rollers as it goes onto and leaves the pins\r\nand the sliver is given its cylindrical form by being drawn through a\r\ncircular opening.\r\n\r\nA finished sliver must conform to the special size desired for\r\nspinning.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPREADER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND BREAKER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAW FRAME.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROPE MACHINE THAT IS ALMOST HUMAN\r\n\r\nFOUR-STRAND COMPOUND LAYING-MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe compound laying machine must, however, be stopped each time that\r\nthe supply of yarn on any bobbin is so low as to call for a fresh one.\r\nThis would occur so frequently in the case of the larger ropes as to\r\noffset the advantages just mentioned, hence the machine is used on a\r\nlimited range of sizes only.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the picture, the machine contains a vertical\r\nshaft with upper and lower projecting arms which support the\r\nbobbin-flyers--four in number in this particular case. The bobbins\r\nwithin each flyer turn on separate spindles, allowing the yarns to pass\r\nup through small guide plates and thence into a tube.\r\n\r\nEach flyer is geared to revolve on its own axis, thus twisting its set\r\nof yarns into a compact strand. At the same time all the flyers revolve\r\nwith the main shaft in an opposite direction and form a rope out of the\r\nstrands as the latter come together in a central tube still higher up.\r\n\r\nThe rope is drawn through this tube by a series of pulleys which exert\r\na steady pull and so keep the proper twist in the rope. From these\r\npulleys the finished product is delivered onto a separately-driven\r\ncoiling reel, an automatic device registering meanwhile on a dial the\r\nnumber of fathoms run.\r\n\r\nThe small reel, seen near the head of the main shaft, holds the small\r\nheart rope which is fed into the center of certain four-strand ropes to\r\nact as a bed for the strands.\r\n\r\nPure Manila rope is the very best and the most satisfactory for all\r\naround use. The character of good Manila fiber is such as to impart to\r\na properly made rope such necessary factors as strength, pliability,\r\nand wearing qualities.\r\n\r\nRegular 3-strand Manila rope is universally used for all general\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nFor certain special uses, however, and particularly where the rope is\r\nto be used for any kind of sheave work, a 4-strand type of construction\r\nwill be found the most suitable, as such a rope presents a much firmer,\r\nrounder, and greater wearing surface than the ordinary 3-strand. There\r\nare many different types of 4-strand rope.\r\n\r\nThe picture shown on this page represents a coil of 4-strand Manila\r\ncalled “Best Fall.” This rope is made of carefully selected fiber;\r\nis 4-strand with heart, and is harder twisted than ordinary goods.\r\nBest Fall is adapted for heavy hoisting work, as on coal and grain\r\nelevators, cargo and quarry hoists and for pile-driver hammer lines.\r\n\r\n~AN AVERAGE COIL OF ROPE--1200 FEET~\r\n\r\nThe standard length coil of rope is 1,200 feet, although extra long\r\nlengths are every day made for such purposes as oil-well drilling, the\r\ntransmission of power, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION, CROSS SECTION AND COIL, FOUR AND THREE-FOURTH\r\nINCHES CIRCUMFERENCE.

Tie a piece of twine (9 and 10, figure 6) around the rope to be\r\nspliced, about six feet from each end. Then unlay the strands of each\r\nend back to the twine.\r\n\r\n2. Butt the ropes together, and twist each corresponding pair of\r\nstrands loosely, to keep them from being tangled, as shown (_a_) figure\r\n6.\r\n\r\n3. The twine 10 is now cut, and the strand 8 unlaid, and strand 7\r\ncarefully laid in its place for a distance of four and a half feet from\r\nthe junction.\r\n\r\n4. The strand 6 is next unlaid about one and a half feet, and strand 5\r\nlaid in its place.\r\n\r\n5. The ends of the cores are now cut off so they just meet.\r\n\r\n6. Unlay strand 1 four and a half feet, laying strand 2 in its place.\r\n\r\n7. Unlay strand 3 one and a half feet, laying in strand 4.\r\n\r\n8. Cut all the strands off to a length of about twenty inches, for\r\nconvenience in manipulation. The rope now assumes the form shown in\r\n_b_, with the meeting-points of the strands three feet apart.\r\n\r\nEach pair of strands is now successively subjected to the following\r\noperations:\r\n\r\n9. From the point of meeting of the strands 8 and 7, unlay each one\r\nthree turns; split both the strands 8 and 7 in halves, as far back as\r\nthey are now unlaid, and “whip” the end of each half strand with a\r\nsmall piece of twine.\r\n\r\n10. The half of the strand 7 is now laid in three turns, and the half\r\nof 8 also laid in three turns.\r\n\r\nThe half strands now meet and are tied in a simple knot, 11 (_c_)\r\nmaking the rope at this point its original size.\r\n\r\n11. The rope is now opened with a marlin-spike, and the half strand of\r\n7 worked around the half strand of 8 by passing the end of the half\r\nstrand through the rope, as shown, drawn taut, and again worked around\r\nthis half strand until it reaches the half strand 13 that was not laid\r\nin. This half strand 13 is now split, and the half strand 7 drawn\r\nthrough the opening thus made, and then tucked under the two adjacent\r\nstrands as shown in _d_.\r\n\r\n12. The other half of the strand 8 is now wound around the other half\r\nstrand 7 in the same way. After each pair of strands has been treated\r\nin this manner, the ends are cut off at 12, leaving them about four\r\ninches long. After a few days’ wear they will all draw into the body of\r\nthe rope or wear off, so that the locality of the splice can scarcely\r\nbe detected.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Go to Sleep?\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, of course, we sleep to rest our body and brain. During our\r\nwaking hours many, if not all, parts of our bodies are active all the\r\ntime, and with every movement we exhaust or spend some of our strength.\r\nTake the case of your arm, for instance. You may be able to move it\r\nup and down fifty or a hundred or more times without getting tired,\r\naccording to how strong you are, but sooner or later you will not be\r\nable to move it any more--it is tired--the life has all gone out of it\r\nand it needs rest, in order that it may become strong again. Every time\r\nyou move your arm you destroy certain parts of its tissues, which can\r\nonly be replaced during rest. Every activity of your body has the same\r\nexperience, and the constant work of the brain in directing the various\r\nmovements and activities of the body, tires it out too. As soon as this\r\ncondition occurs, the brain tells the other parts of the body that it\r\nis time to rest, and even if we try to keep awake and go on with our\r\nwork or play, or whatever it is we are doing, we find sooner or later\r\nthat it is impossible. If we persist we fall asleep wherever we happen\r\nto be. It is not necessary for all parts of the body to be tired before\r\nwe sleep. One part alone may be so affected by what it has been doing\r\nthat it alone causes us to fall asleep. Sometimes the eyes become so\r\ntired, while we are looking at the pictures in a book or reading, for\r\ninstance, that we fall off to sleep quickly. It is perhaps easier to\r\nbring on sleep by making the eyes tired than in any other way. That\r\nis why so many people read themselves to sleep. It is such a gradual\r\npassing into unconsciousness that you can hardly ever tell where you\r\nleft off reading. It is said that when we are awake our bodies are\r\ncontinually planning for the time when we shall need sleep and are\r\ncontinually making some little germ which is carried to the brain as\r\nsoon as made, and when there are a sufficient number of these little\r\ngerms piled up in the brain, we go to sleep. The process of sleeping\r\nthen destroys these germs, and when they are destroyed we again wake up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Wake Up in the Morning?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo answer this we must go back to the answer to the question, “What\r\nmakes us go to sleep?” We go to sleep in order to secure the rest which\r\nour body and brain need to build up the parts which have been destroyed\r\nduring our active work or play.\r\n\r\nWe wake up naturally when we have had sufficient rest. We wake up\r\nnaturally, however, only when the destroyed parts of the body have\r\nbeen replaced. Other things may waken us--a noise of any kind, loud\r\nor slight, a startling dream or a moving thing that disturbs our\r\nsleep--according to how fully we are asleep. It is said that sometimes\r\nonly parts of the body are asleep; that we are not always all asleep\r\nwhen we appear to sleep, and that we dream because some part of the\r\nbody is awake or active. This is probably true. Now then, when all of\r\nanyone of us is sleepy, we go into what is called a deep sleep and\r\nat such times only something out of the ordinary would awaken us.\r\nGradually, however, various parts of the body become rested and they\r\nare said to wake up, and finally when all of us is rested, we naturally\r\nwake up all over. If you are healthy and sleep naturally, in a place\r\nwhere you cannot be disturbed by noises or movements of others, you\r\nshould be “wide awake” when your eyes open and be ready to get up at\r\nonce. If you feel like turning over for another snooze, when it is time\r\nto get up, you did not go to bed as early as you should have done,\r\nor else some part of you did not get the required amount of sleep it\r\nshould have had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Are We When Asleep?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are just where we lie. It seems to us, of course, because of our\r\ndreams when we are asleep that we are away off some place else. Often\r\nwhen we wake up we wonder for a minute or two where we are, as\r\neverything seems so strange to us, and it takes a minute or so for us\r\nto remember that we are in our own bed, if that is where we went to\r\nsleep. This is because of the dreams we have while asleep. In past\r\ntimes the uncivilized savages in various parts of the earth believed\r\nthat when any of them went to sleep that the real person so asleep\r\nactually went away, leaving the body behind; in other words, that\r\nthe soul went traveling. They thought this because it was the only\r\nexplanation they could think of for the dreams they had, since almost\r\ninvariably the dream was about some other place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does It Seem When We Have Slept All Night That We Have Been Asleep\r\nOnly a Minute?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is because all our ideas of passage of time are based on our\r\nconscious periods. When we are asleep we are unconscious. It is the\r\nsame as if time did not pass, and when we wake up the tendency is to\r\nstart in where we left off. We have learned by experience that when\r\nwe go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning that much time has\r\npassed and this unconscious knowledge keeps us from thinking always\r\nthat we have been asleep but a minute. But if you drop asleep in the\r\nday time, no matter how long you sleep, you wake up thinking that\r\nyou have been asleep only a minute, and sometimes it is difficult to\r\nconvince yourself that you have been asleep at all. Sometimes after\r\nbeing asleep for hours, your first waking thought is a continuation of\r\nwhat your mind was on when you went to sleep. The reason for this, as\r\nstated above, is that we cannot keep track of passing time when we are\r\nasleep, because we are perfectly unconscious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Should We Not Sleep With the Moon Shining On Us?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no harm in letting the moon shine on us while we are asleep.\r\nThis is one of the queer superstitions that has developed in the world.\r\nA great many people think that something terrible will happen if the\r\nmoon is allowed to shine into the room where they are asleep. Not so\r\nmany believe this as used to do so, thanks to the more enlightened\r\ncondition of things in the world.\r\n\r\nTo prove to yourself that no harm can come to you through the moon\r\nshining into your bedroom or upon you as you are asleep, you have only\r\nto remember that a great many men and very many more animals sleep out\r\nunder the sky every night and that the moon must shine on them while\r\nthey are asleep. As a matter of fact, people who sleep out under the\r\nopen sky are generally in possession of more rugged health than people\r\nwho sleep in beds in closed rooms. So it is rather better to let the\r\nmoon shine on you while asleep than not.\r\n\r\nThis belief probably started with some one who had trouble in going to\r\nsleep with the moon shining on him, because the light of the moon might\r\nhave a tendency to keep him awake. It is easier to go to sleep in a\r\ndark room than in one that is lighted, because when there is no light\r\nthere is less about you to keep you awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Us Dream?\r\n\r\n\r\nDreams originate in the brain. The brain has many parts and some parts\r\nof it may be asleep while others are not. If all parts of the brain\r\nare actually asleep, it is said there can be no dreams. We have dreams\r\nabout things which seem very natural while we are having them, and\r\nwhich we know would be impossible if we were wholly awake, because\r\nthose parts of the brain which control the other parts are probably\r\nasleep while the dream is taking place, and it is then that we have\r\nthose fantastic and highly imaginative dreams, for the brain is not\r\nunder control in every sense.\r\n\r\nWe used to believe that dreams have no purpose, just as now we know\r\nthat they have no meaning. But it has been discovered that dreams\r\nhave a purpose in that they protect our sleep. You see, every dream\r\nis started by some disturbance or excitement of the body or mind.\r\nSomething may be pressing or touching us while we sleep, or a strange\r\nsound may start a dream, or perhaps it is some uncomfortable position\r\nin which we are lying or trouble in the stomach on account of eating\r\nsomething we should not. Whatever it may be, those things wake up some\r\npart of the brain, because if all parts of the brain were asleep, we\r\ncould not feel or hear anything. Any such disturbance or excitement\r\nwould naturally excite the whole brain and wake us up completely if it\r\nwere not for dreams. The dream takes care of this and enables the rest\r\nof the body and brain to sleep while one or more parts of the brain are\r\ndisturbed and even perhaps awake. We may perhaps have become uncovered\r\nin some way. This would produce a cold feeling and might wake a part\r\nof the brain and cause a dream about skating or some other winter\r\namusement or experience, or even perhaps one about falling through the\r\nice, and still we might not be uncovered so much that it would make any\r\ngreat difference. The dream comes and we go on with our sleep without\r\nwaking up, whereas if it were not for the dream we would awaken. In\r\nother words, dreams are just another wise provision of nature which\r\nenables us to go right on and get the rest we need, even if our\r\ndigestion is out of order, or some part of our brain is disturbed\r\nthrough something we read about, or were told of, or we thought of\r\nwhile still awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Know We Have Dreamed When We Wake Up?\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause we remember some of our dreams. Sometimes we do not remember\r\nthe dreams we dreamed. This is just like what happens when we are\r\nawake. We remember some things and forget others.\r\n\r\nDreams are a sort of safety valve in our sleep. We dream because not\r\nall of our brain is asleep at the time and it is a wise provision of\r\nnature that permits the waking part of the brain to go on working\r\nwithout disturbing the sleep of the other parts of the brain. If a\r\nlarge part of the brain is awake and engaged in making the dream,\r\nwe are very apt to remember the dream; but when we dream and cannot\r\nremember what the dream was, it is because only a very small portion of\r\nthe brain was awake and making a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes Nightmare?\r\n\r\n\r\nA nightmare is a dream of what we might call a vigorous kind. A\r\nnightmare is caused by a feeling of intense fear, horror, anxiety\r\nor the inability to escape from some great danger. A nightmare is\r\nthe result of either an irregular flow of blood to the brain or by a\r\nstomach that is not in proper condition.\r\n\r\nThe name for this kind of a dream comes from the words night and mare.\r\nThe latter word in one of its several meanings indicates an incubus or\r\nevil vision, and a dream of an evil vision involving fear or horror\r\ncame to be termed a mare. Since they occurred generally at night, since\r\nmost people sleep at night, they became known as nightmares. Nightmares\r\nare more common to children than grown-up people because children are\r\nmore apt to have an uneven flow of blood to the brain and also are more\r\napt to eat the things which put the stomach in a state of unrest which\r\ncauses nightmares. Grown-up people are more likely to have learned to\r\navoid the abuses of the stomach which are apt to produce nightmares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are Ghosts?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of ghosts is the result of a mistake of the brain or an\r\nattempt to account for something of which we see the results, but have\r\nno actual knowledge. There are no ghosts. There are many forces at work\r\nin the world of which we know nothing as yet. Many of the wonderful\r\nthings that occur in the world are as yet mysteries to the mind of\r\nman. Every little while man discovers one of these new forces, and\r\nthen he is able to understand many things plainly which were up to\r\nthen surrounded with mystery and in the minds of superstitious people\r\nattributed to spirits or ghosts. Long before we understood as much as\r\nwe do now of the workings of electricity (and they say we know only a\r\nlittle of its wonders as yet) many of the natural wonders produced by\r\nelectricity were attributed to ghosts.\r\n\r\nMost of the marvelous tales of the wonders performed by and visits from\r\nghosts are the result of disturbances of the brain in the people who\r\nthink they see the ghosts and the results of their work.\r\n\r\nA creature without imagination does not pretend to see or believe in\r\nghosts. Man is the only animal which possesses the ability to imagine\r\nthings and so the ghosts we hear about are the creatures of the\r\ndisturbed brains of men. Generally in the ghost stories we hear of,\r\nthe ghost is described as wearing clothes--usually white. A bed sheet\r\nthrown over the foot of the bed may appear to a half-awake person as\r\nthe outline of the figure of a ghost and to one of a highly imaginative\r\ntemperament without the courage of investigation, become forever a real\r\nghost. Usually what is supposed to be a ghost is only a creation of\r\nthe mind--a vision such as we can develop during a dream--oftentimes,\r\nhowever, what you look at when you think you see a ghost is an actual\r\nsomething such as the sheet referred to, but which takes the form of\r\nthe ghost in the brain of the person who is looking at it through eyes\r\nthat really see it, but out of a brain that for the moment at least is\r\nfar off its balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Girls Like Dolls?\r\n\r\n\r\nGirls like dolls because they come into the world for the purpose of\r\nbecoming mothers and the love which they display for dolls is the\r\nmother instinct which begins to show itself early in life. To the\r\nlittle girl the doll is a make-believe child. It satisfies her as long\r\nas there are no real babies to take its place, but any little girl will\r\ndrop her dollie if she is given an opportunity to play at dolls with a\r\nreal live baby instead. This is a very interesting fact in connection\r\nwith the human race. Boys sometimes play with dolls, but not so often,\r\nand any kind of a boy will give up playing with a doll as soon as a\r\ntoy engine or some other boy’s toy appears for him. A boy has certain\r\nmannish instincts which a girl has not. We have many other instincts\r\nbesides the instinct of parenthood and each of them has its origin in\r\nsome certain kind of feeling which is born within us and is capable of\r\ndevelopment along interesting lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Works of a Watch Go?\r\n\r\n\r\nA watch like any other machine which we have, only goes when power is\r\napplied in some form or another. In the case of a watch it is a spring.\r\nA spring is an elastic body, such as a strip of steel, as in the case\r\nof the watch, coiled spirally which, when bent or forced out of its\r\nnatural state, has the power of recovering its shape again by virtue of\r\nits elastic power. The natural state of a watch spring is to be open\r\nflat and spread out to its full length. When you wind a watch you coil\r\nthis spring, i.e., you bend it out of its natural shape. As soon as you\r\nstop winding the spring begins to uncoil itself, trying to get back to\r\nits natural shape, and in doing so makes the wheels of the watch which\r\noperate the hands go round. The spring then, or rather its elasticity,\r\nwhich always makes an effort to get back to its natural state, is the\r\npower which makes the watch go. Men who make watches arrange the spring\r\nand the other machinery in the watch in such a way that it will uncoil\r\nitself only at a certain rate of speed. Sooner or later the spring\r\nloses its elasticity and then its power to make the watch go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes a Hot Box?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you put oil on the axle, however, the oil fills up the hollows\r\nbetween the little irregular bumps on both the axle and the hub, and\r\nmakes them both smooth--almost perfectly so. This reduces the friction\r\nand keeps the axle and hub from becoming hot and expanding. The less\r\nfriction that is developed, the more easily the wheel will turn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Moving Picture\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are Moving Pictures Made?\r\n\r\nTo begin at the beginning, we must start with the negative stock,\r\nor film on which the pictures are taken. This material is very much\r\nlike the films you buy for the ordinary snap-shot camera, slightly\r\nheavier and of more durable quality, to stand the wear and tear of\r\npassing through the picture camera and the projecting machine used in\r\nexhibition. This film is 1³⁄₈ inches wide and comes in rolls of 200\r\nfeet in length. This negative stock has to be carefully perforated,\r\nmaking the holes necessary to conduct the film by aid of sprockets\r\nthrough the camera and the projectoscope. To still further understand\r\nthis explanation, see illustrations of the negative stock. Having\r\nprepared the film in the dark room, we can load the camera in the dark\r\nroom and proceed to take the picture.\r\n\r\nIn taking an industrial or travelogue picture, after the camera is\r\nin readiness, is not so much of an undertaking as taking a picture\r\nof a drama or comedy, wherein a plot and players are concerned. The\r\ntravelogue or industrial pictures are simply photography, with the\r\nadditional manipulation of panoraming or turning the camera, which\r\nrequires an expert knowledge, acquired from experience and years of\r\nstudy. There is a distinction and a big difference between the ordinary\r\nphotographer and the moving picture photographer, who is generally\r\nknown as a “camera-man.” A photographer, therefore, though of vast\r\nexperience, cannot step into a “camera-man’s” place and expect to “make\r\ngood.” The latter has to depend entirely upon his special experience\r\nand judgment as to light and distance, focusing and general physical\r\nconditions of the moving-picture camera, which is affected by static\r\nand other electrical peculiarities of the atmosphere, to be avoided\r\nby him. These, and many other points, are convincing evidence that\r\nthe moving-picture camera is entirely different from an ordinary\r\nphotographic camera. A moving-picture camera and tripod weigh from\r\nfifty to one hundred pounds. There are two styles of cameras, one\r\nwhich takes a single film and one which takes two films at once,\r\nand each lens of the double camera must be equally well focused and\r\nevery feature to be depicted must be brought within the focus, which\r\ngenerally occupies a radius of 8 feet in width by 10 feet in height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENES FROM “OFFICER KATE.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAW NEGATIVE STOCK. PERFORATED NEGATIVE STOCK.\r\n\r\nExact size of a Motion Picture Film]\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to taking a photo-play, a drama or comedy, different\r\nconditions of a varied nature have to be contended with. To proceed\r\nintelligently in taking a photo-play, a scenario or manuscript is\r\nessential. It must be prefaced with a well-written synopsis of the\r\nstory involved, cast of characters, scenes to be enacted and a list of\r\nproperties required in the scenes. The director, or producer, of the\r\nplay, being furnished with such a guide, proceeds to select the actors\r\nand actresses (called players) suitable for the parts and the filling\r\nof the cast. This being accomplished, he insists that each one of the\r\nplayers read the scenario in order to be familiar with his or her\r\npart and understand the whole play before going into the picture. The\r\ndirector instructs them as to the costumes fitting the parts and then\r\nconfers with the costumer concerning the furnishing of proper dress\r\nfor each one of the players. The director is ready to go on with the\r\nperformance of the play, and tells his cast to appear for rehearsal\r\nat a set hour. At that time he puts them through a thorough course of\r\ntraining or rehearsal, to “get over” and register the meaning of each\r\nthought which is to be expressed by their actions. Sometimes a scene is\r\nrehearsed four to six hours before it is photographed. A one-reel play\r\nis generally 1000 feet in length, and it is very important that the\r\ndirector, if he has twenty scenes, for instance, to introduce within\r\nthat 1000 feet, to time the scenes to the length of his film; that is,\r\nif he has twenty scenes within one thousand feet, each of the twenty\r\nscenes must not average more than one minute each. If one should happen\r\nto be more than one minute, then he has to condense another scene less\r\nthan one minute, in order to bring all within the twenty minutes or\r\n1000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAGING A MOTION PICTURE IN A STUDIO\r\n\r\nREHEARSING SCENE IN STUDIO]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Size of Each Picture on the Film.\r\n\r\nSo you can see from this that it needs very careful rehearsal and nice\r\ncalculation to bring a well-acted and convincing play within so short\r\na time, to tell the whole story intelligently. Having done all this,\r\nthe director is ready to have the “camera-man” do his part of the\r\nwork. He draws his lines within the range of the camera, which do not\r\nexceed eight or ten feet in the foreground. This is another point to be\r\nconsidered on the part of the director, because all the action has to\r\nbe carried out within the eight feet of space, which is really confined\r\nto that much stage width. Here again is where the camera-man has to\r\nwatch very carefully, not only the workings of his camera, but the\r\nplayers; always alert that they are in the picture, and assisting the\r\ndirector by his observations. The size of each picture as taken on the\r\nfilm is ³⁄₄ by 1 inch. It is magnified ten thousand times its actual\r\nsize when we see it on the screen in a place of exhibition. A full reel\r\nof 1000 feet shows 16,000 photographs on the screen during the twenty\r\nminutes it consumes in its showing. The future of moving pictures is\r\nno longer a matter of speculation. The business is an established\r\none, and its further developments are only matters of time. The\r\npossibilities and uses of the animated art are unlimited. Already it\r\nis felt in educational, religious, scientific, and industrial affairs.\r\nTheir influence in matters of sanitation and all civic improvements,\r\nconstruction and mechanics, is invaluable. As a medium of wholesome\r\nentertainment and solid instruction it is unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nThese are merely suggestions of a few phases of its utility and it is\r\nonly a natural conclusion that it will be so far-reaching in its uplift\r\nthat it will surpass the expectations of the most sanguine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVELOPING ROOM.]\r\n\r\nTo develop, tint and clear the films, large tanks of wood or soapstone\r\nare used. The films, which are wound upon the wooden frames, or racks,\r\nare dipped into these vats, filled with the necessary chemicals and\r\nliquids. The films being wound on frames enables the developers to\r\nexamine them without handling them. The tinting is done by similar\r\nmethods to give the necessary tint, coloring in red, sepia, blue, green\r\nor yellow, imparting to them the effect of night, sunlight or evening,\r\nwhichever the case may be. The films are finally cleared, to wash them\r\nclear of any extraneous chemicals or matter which might streak or\r\nscratch the films, and avoid any objectionable matter that might mar\r\ntheir appearance when shown on the screen or in the process of handling.\r\n\r\n~EACH PICTURE IS FIRST EXHIBITED AT THE STUDIO~\r\n\r\nAs soon as convenient after a film is finished it is taken to the\r\nexhibition rooms, at the studio, where it is thrown onto the screen. It\r\nis reviewed first by the heads of the departments and the directors,\r\nand later by players and all those interested in it. The projectoscopes\r\nor moving-picture machines are run by motor, presided over by licensed\r\noperators, who are kept on the job continually.\r\n\r\nThese exhibition rooms are called, in the parlance of the studios,\r\n“knocklodeums,” for here is where everything is criticised. Players’\r\nacting and fitness are judged by their appearance and conduct on the\r\nscreen and decision given as to their qualifications. The quality of\r\nthe photography, developing and the picture as a finished production is\r\nhere determined by the heads of the concern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING ROOM.]\r\n\r\n~THE BOARD OF CENSORS PASSES ON EVERY PICTURE~\r\n\r\nEvery picture before it is released for exhibition must be passed upon\r\nby the Board of Censors. It is run upon the screen and thoroughly\r\ninspected, criticised, and every point involved thoroughly weighed\r\nas to its effect upon the mind of the general public. If, in their\r\nestimation, it is found objectionable in any particular, the\r\nobjectionable parts are eliminated, and if considered entirely harmful,\r\nin its sentiments or influence, the picture is condemned. The majority\r\nrules in the board’s judgment, although it is by no means infallible in\r\nits decision. This board is composed of about sixty persons, who are\r\nappointed by the government for their general qualifications, their\r\ninterest in the general welfare of the public, keenness as to morals\r\nand uplift of the people at large. They do not receive salaries; their\r\nservices are _pro bono publico_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKING A MILITARY SCENE OUTDOORS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY IN “PIGS IS PIGS”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “PIGS IS PIGS.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VITAGRAPH FAMOUS AUTHORS’ SERIES BY ELLIS PARKER BUTLER.\r\n\r\n  _You Have Seen Pigs, but Never Such Pigs as These.

The idea is almost as old as pictures themselves.\r\nThis toy we speak of was called a zoetrope. It consisted of a whirling\r\ncylinder having many slits in the outside through which you could see\r\nby looking into the cylinder a picture opposite each slit. The pictures\r\nwere drawn by hand and the artist aimed to place the pictures within\r\nthe cylinder in such order that each succeeding one would represent the\r\nnext successive motion of any moving object in making a movement as\r\nnear as he could draw it; when the cylinder was whirled with the slits\r\non a level with the eye, the effect produced was of a continuous moving\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nA great many devices were produced as a result of this toy for\r\npresenting the effect of pictures so arranged, but until photography\r\nwas invented no way was found for making the pictures to be viewed\r\nexcept such as were drawn by artists. But when photography was\r\ndeveloped it was possible to get actual successive photographs.\r\nThe greatest difficulty was found in taking photographs in such\r\nquick succession that all of the motions in the moving object were\r\ntaken without any skipping. This difficulty was for the first time\r\nsuccessfully overcome by Muybridge in 1877. He arranged a row of\r\ntwenty-four cameras with string trigger shutters, the string of each\r\nshutter being stretched across a race track. A moving horse approaching\r\ndown the track broke the strings as he came to them, thus operating\r\neach of the cameras in turn in quick succession and securing a series\r\nof pictures of the moving horse within a very short time. There were\r\ntwenty-four pictures to this film when reproduced in the devices then\r\nknown for projecting pictures, and this method required one camera for\r\neach section of the picture produced. Of course, the length of the\r\nseries was thus limited greatly.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years later Le Prince arranged what he called a multiple\r\ncamera. This was as a matter of fact a battery of sixteen automatically\r\nreloading cameras in which strips of film were used. Each of the\r\nsixteen cameras took a picture in turn and then automatically brought\r\nanother strip of the film into position, so that camera number one took\r\nthe seventeenth picture, the twenty-third, the forty-ninth, etc., and\r\neach of the other cameras took their various pictures in turn. With\r\nthis camera a film of any required length could be produced.\r\n\r\nThe Le Prince camera was therefore the real parent from which\r\nthe modern motion-picture camera sprang. The first really modern\r\nmotion-picture camera was built in a single case with a battery of\r\nsixteen separate lenses and sixteen shutters. These were operated by\r\nturning a crank. The pictures were taken on four strips of film. When\r\nthe crank was turned the exposure was made to each of the sixteen\r\nlenses in succession, and when the series was completed the films\r\nwere cut apart and pasted together in a single strip of film, the\r\npictures themselves being arranged in the proper order. The principal\r\ndevelopment of this camera, as found in the present method of making\r\nmotion pictures, is the invention of the flexible film negatives; the\r\ntransparent support for the print which permits the pictures to be\r\nprojected in enlarged form upon a screen; and the system of holes in\r\nthe margin of the film by which the film is held in perfect alignment\r\nfor projecting the pictures.\r\n\r\nBut a few years ago, then, the motion picture was a child’s toy. To-day\r\nit forms the basis for not only a very large and profitable business\r\nfor many people, but a source of amusement and education to millions\r\nof people at reasonable prices. To-day the motion-picture business is\r\nregarded as one of the world’s greatest industries.\r\n\r\nNo corner of the world is so far remote but the motion-picture man\r\nfinds his way there, either as an exhibitor or as a producer. Nothing\r\nhappens in the world to-day but the motion-picture man with his\r\ncamera is on the job if it is a happening that can be preserved in\r\nmotion pictures and worthy of that. The dethronement of kings and the\r\ninaugurations of presidents are all alike to him. If there is a war, he\r\nis found in all parts of the field, and is the first to see the parade\r\nwhen there is a peace jubilee. Disasters, horrors, heroes and criminals\r\npass before his lens and he gives us a moving panorama of everything\r\nthat is interesting, in nature, in real life, and in fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking Motion Pictures a Simple Operation.\r\n\r\nMotion-picture photography is mechanically simple and the projection of\r\nthe pictures on the screen was made possible by the improvement in dry\r\nplates which made instantaneous photography successful, together with\r\nthe invention of the process of using celluloid films for negatives.\r\nMotion pictures consist of a series of photographs made rapidly and\r\nthen projected rapidly on the screen. In this way one picture follows\r\nanother so quickly that the change from one picture to another is\r\nnot noticed and the movements and actions of the persons or things\r\nphotographed are reproduced in a life-like manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Hand Quicker Than the Eye?\r\n\r\nThere is no question that the hand can be moved so quickly that the\r\neye cannot detect the movement. This is proved by the motion picture\r\nwhen projected on the screen. In moving pictures the quickness of\r\nthe machine deceives the eye and the transition from one picture to\r\nanother is done so rapidly that the change is not seen and the apparent\r\nmovement is continuous and unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe film made by the motion picture is a “negative” in which the colors\r\nare reversed, the blacks being white and the whites black, exactly as\r\nin still photography. The film used in the projection machine is a\r\n“positive,” in which the lights and shadows have their proper values.\r\nThe principle and process is exactly the same as in making lantern\r\nslides and window transparencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the Film Move Continuously?\r\n\r\nIn making the negative for the motion picture the film does not move\r\nforward regularly, but it goes by jumps. It is absolutely still at the\r\nmoment of exposure. The same is true in projecting the picture on the\r\nscreen. In most projection machines the film is stationary three times\r\nas long as it is in motion, though in some machines the proportion is\r\none in six. In the taking of the picture, the film is really stationary\r\none-half of the time. As pictures are usually projected at the rate\r\nof fourteen or sixteen to the second, this means that each separate\r\npicture appears on the screen three-fourths of one-sixteenth of a\r\nsecond, or three-sixty-fourths of a second, and\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are Freak Pictures Made?\r\n\r\nFreak pictures are usually the result of clever manipulation of the\r\ncamera or the film. Articles or individuals can be made to instantly\r\ndisappear by stopping the camera while the article is removed or the\r\nperson walks off the stage, the other characters holding their pose\r\nuntil the camera is again put in motion. In some films in which a\r\nperson is thrown from a height or is apparently crushed under a steam\r\nroller the effect is gained by the live person walking away after the\r\ncamera is stopped and a dummy substituted to undergo the death penalty.\r\n\r\nBy projecting the picture at a faster rate than it was taken,\r\nexcruciatingly comic scenes are sometimes devised. An automobile going\r\nten miles an hour, by speeding up the projection machine, may be made\r\nto apparently move at a hundred miles an hour, and by increasing in\r\nthe same way the apparent speed of persons dodging the demoniac auto\r\nexceedingly ludicrous effects are had.\r\n\r\nBy mechanical means in combining two or more negatives into one\r\npositive a man can be shown fencing with himself or even cutting his\r\nown head off.\r\n\r\n  Pictures by courtesy of the Vitagraph Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW RUBBER TIRES ARE MADE\r\n\r\nWASH ROOM.[4]]\r\n\r\n  [4] These and the following Pictures by courtesy of the Goodyear Tire\r\n  and Rubber Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Ball of Rubber\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Crude Rubber Is Treated.\r\n\r\n_Washing._--When the crude rubber arrives at the factory of the rubber\r\nmanufacturer, it is generally stored in bins in dark and fairly cool\r\nstore-rooms, where it is kept until ready to be used. The rubber passes\r\ndirectly from the storage bins to the wash-room, where it is cut up\r\ninto small pieces, put into large vats of warmed water and allowed\r\nto soak, in order to soften it sufficiently to be broken down in the\r\nmachines. It is then fed into a cracker, a machine consisting of two\r\nrolls with projections on their surfaces shaped like little pyramids,\r\nthe two rolls revolving with a differential, one going considerably\r\nfaster than the other, and being adjustable, so that they can work\r\nclose together or with some distance between them. The rubber is fed\r\nbetween these rolls and broken down into a coarse, spongy mass. Water\r\nflows on to the rubber during the process, bringing down sand, dirt,\r\nbark, and the many other foreign materials which come mixed with the\r\nrubber. The rubber is put through this machine a number of times, until\r\nit is worked into a uniform condition. Some of the rubbers, like the\r\nCeylons and Paras, will sheet out into a coarse sheet by being put\r\nthrough this machine; others, like the majority of the African rubbers,\r\nwill fall apart and come down in chunks and have to be fed into the\r\nmachine with a shovel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING CRUDE RUBBER FOR MAKING TIRES\r\n\r\nCALENDER ROOM.]\r\n\r\nAfter the rubber is broken down sufficiently in the cracker, it is\r\nnext put through a washing machine, which is built very similar to\r\nthe cracking machine, except that the rolls are grooved or rifled, so\r\nthat their action is not so severe on the rubber. A large quantity of\r\nwater is kept constantly running over this machine while the rubber\r\nis being put through, and the rolls work very close together, so that\r\nthe rubber is finely ground and run out into a thin and comparatively\r\nsmooth sheet, allowing the water flowing between the rolls to take out\r\npractically all of the foreign matter that remains. The rubber is run\r\nthrough this machine a number of times until the experienced inspectors\r\nin charge are satisfied that it is thoroughly washed. Some types of\r\nrubber, such as Manicoba, which have large quantities of sand in them,\r\nare washed in a special form of washing machine known as the beater\r\nwasher. This is an endless, oval-shaped trough with a fast-revolving\r\npaddle-wheel. In this machine the rubber is submerged in water, after\r\nbeing broken down in the cracker, and the sand is literally knocked out\r\nof it by the paddle-wheel. The sand drops to the bottom of the machine,\r\nwhere if is drained off, while the rubber floats to the top and is\r\nthere gathered and then put through a regular washing machine for the\r\nfinal sheeting out.\r\n\r\n_Drying._--From the wash-room the rubber goes to the dry-room. Before\r\nthe rubber can be used in any articles of commercial value, it must\r\nbe thoroughly dried, as any moisture in the stock would turn to steam\r\nduring the vulcanizing process and cause blisters or blow-holes to form\r\nin the goods. There are two ways in which rubber is usually dried.\r\nThe method mostly used, and which is generally practiced with all the\r\nbetter grades of gums, is to hang the washed strips on horizontal\r\npoles and space them in aisles, so that air can freely circulate all\r\naround the surface of the rubber, the dry-room being kept at a constant\r\ntemperature. To properly dry the rubbers by this method takes from four\r\nto six weeks. The other method of drying is by means of a vacuum-drier.\r\nLow-grade rubbers which have a comparatively large percentage of\r\nresin in their composition cannot bear their own weight when hung on\r\nhorizontal poles, but drop off and stick in piles on the floor. Hence,\r\nthese rubbers have to be dried in a peculiar manner. They are laid in\r\ntrays which are placed into a large air-tight receptacle. The air is\r\nthen withdrawn from this receptacle and the interior heated by means of\r\nsteam coils. This allows the water to be evaporated off from the rubber\r\nat a considerably lower temperature than that at which water boils\r\nunder atmospheric pressure, and at such a low temperature, and in such\r\na short time, that the rubber is not affected. By this process these\r\nrubbers can be dried in a few hours.\r\n\r\n_Mixing._--After the rubber has been thoroughly dried, it is ready to\r\nbe mixed in proper proportions with the various ingredients which are\r\nused in rubber compounding, to give the desired quality of rubbers for\r\nthe various products for which they are intended. In order that rubber\r\nshall vulcanize, it is necessary to mix with it a certain proportion\r\nof sulphur, vulcanizing, or curing, as it is sometimes called, being\r\nmerely the changing of a physical mixture of rubber and sulphur into\r\na chemical compound of these ingredients, by the application of heat.\r\nBesides sulphur, some of the more important ingredients used in\r\ncompounding rubber are:\r\n\r\n_Zinc oxide._--This toughens the rubber and increases its wearing\r\nproperties and tensile strength.\r\n\r\n_Barium sulphate._--This stiffens the rubber and adds weight, so\r\nreducing the cost.\r\n\r\n_Lithopones._--This whitens the stock and makes it soft, and is used\r\nextensively in druggists’ sundries.\r\n\r\n_Antimony sulphide._--This makes the stock red and is a preservative\r\nagainst oxidation.\r\n\r\n_Litharge._--This has the same action as antimony sulphide, but makes\r\nthe stock black.\r\n\r\n_White lead._--This hastens the cure and is extensively used in gray\r\nand black stocks, and is a good filler or weight adder.\r\n\r\n_Magnesia oxide and carbonate._--These are used as fillers for white\r\nstocks.\r\n\r\n_Oxide of iron._--Used for coloring red and yellow stocks.\r\n\r\n_Lime_ (unslacked).--This hastens vulcanization and chemically removes\r\nany water left in the rubber.\r\n\r\n_Whiting._--This is used only as a cheap filler to increase quantity\r\nand lower cost.\r\n\r\n_Aluminum silicate._--This is used chiefly as a filler.\r\n\r\nThere are also used in compounding what are known as the various\r\nsubstitutes. These are chiefly linseed oil products and mineral\r\nhydrocarbons which are more or less elastic, and act somewhat as a flux.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Don’t We Use Pure Rubber?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a general impression that the various ingredients\r\nwhich are mixed with rubber are put into the compounds merely to\r\ncheapen the product and to lower the grade of the material. This\r\nis true in many cases, such as the general line of molded goods,\r\nrubber heels, bicycle grips, automobile bumpers, etc., but in many\r\ncases, such as tires, packing, belting, etc., these ingredients are\r\nadded to toughen the gum, increase its wearing qualities, to make it\r\nindestructible when subjected to heat, or to make it soft and yielding\r\nso that it can be forced into fabric, etc.\r\n\r\n~PROCESS NECESSARY TO MAKING RUBBER GOODS~\r\n\r\nIn the general process of manufacture the sheeted rubber is sent\r\ndirectly from the dry-room to the compound-room, where the various\r\ningredients are weighed out into proper proportions along with the\r\nrubber to make up a batch, and placed in receptacles ready to be mixed.\r\nThe batch is then sent into the mill-room to be mixed into a uniform\r\npasty mass, which is the characteristic uncured, or so-called green,\r\nrubber compound. The mixing is done in the mill. This is a very heavy\r\nmachine, constructed similarly to a cracker and a washer except that\r\nit is much larger and heavier, and the rolls are perfectly smooth and\r\nrun closer together. No water at all is used on the batch during the\r\nmixing. There are steam and cold water connections to the mills which\r\nare connected with hollow spaces inside the rolls, so that the latter\r\ncan be kept at any temperature desired. The general process of mixing\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst the rubber portion of the batch is thrown into the mill and\r\nis worked and warmed up until it takes on a very sticky and plastic\r\nconsistency. When it has arrived at a certain stage of plasticity,\r\nthe various compounds in the batch, which are always in the form of\r\nvery fine powders, are thrown in the mill, being worked by the rolls\r\ninto the rubber. The compounds are generally thrown on, a small amount\r\nat a time, until they are all taken up by the rubber. The batch is\r\nthen allowed to go through and through the mill, over and over again,\r\nuntil the mixture is absolutely uniform throughout the whole mass. The\r\nconsistency of the rubber, during this operation, is such that the\r\nbatch can be made endless around one of the rolls of the mill, so that\r\nit is constantly feeding itself between the rolls.\r\n\r\nAfter the batch is properly mixed, it is cut off the rolls in sheets\r\nand rolled up and sent to the green-stock store-room. In this\r\nstore-room the compounded, uncured gums are kept in different bins,\r\naccording to the nature of the compound, and are there allowed to\r\nseason a certain length of time, after which they are delivered to the\r\nvarious departments of the factory in which they are going to be used.\r\n\r\nAnother form in which rubber is used is the so-called Rubber-Cement.\r\nRubber or any of its compounds are readily soluble in naphtha. In this\r\nprocess, the compounds, after being milled, are chewed up and washed\r\nin specially constructed cement-mills and there mixed with a certain\r\nproportion of naphtha which gives a thick solution.\r\n\r\n_Spreading and calendering._--Rubber which is used for the general\r\nline of molded goods, solid tires, some kinds of tubing, etc., goes\r\ndirectly to the various departments from the green-stock store-room,\r\nwhile rubber used for boots and shoes, waterproof fabrics, many of\r\nthe druggists’ sundries, belting, pneumatic tires, inner tubes, etc.,\r\nhas to be sheeted out, and some of it forced into fabric before it\r\ngoes to the various departments. This sheeting-out of the gum, as well\r\nas applying the rubber to fabrics, is done generally by two methods;\r\neither by spreading a solution of the rubber and naphtha onto the\r\nfabric, or by calendering the rubber between heavy rolls in a rubber\r\ncalender.\r\n\r\nIn the spreading process, a machine called a spreader is used. The\r\nfabric to which the rubber is to be applied is mounted in a roll at\r\none end of the spreader and from the roll passes through a trough of\r\nrubber-cement, and then up over a so-called doctor roll, and under a\r\nknife edge, which allows only enough cement to pass through to fill the\r\npores of the fabric. From this knife the cemented fabric passes over\r\na steam drying chest and is then rolled up with a roll of liner cloth\r\nto prevent its sticking together. Fabric treated in this manner must\r\nbe put through the spreader a number of times before it has sufficient\r\nrubber on it to be used in the products for which it is intended.\r\n\r\nFor calendering rubber, a machine called a rubber calender is used.\r\nThis machine is made with three and sometimes four heavy rolls, which\r\nare capable of very fine adjustment. The rubber from the green-stock\r\nstore-room is first warmed up on a small mixing mill and is then fed\r\nbetween the rolls of the calender, coming through in a thin sheet of\r\nrequired thickness, and is wound up in a liner cloth and sent directly\r\nto the departments, where it is used for inner tubes, druggists’\r\nsundries, etc., where only rubber and no fabric is used. Where the\r\nrubber is to be applied to fabric, the fabric is put through the\r\ncalender rolls with the rubber, and the rubber is literally ground into\r\nthe fabric. Fabric treated in this manner is known to the trade as\r\nfriction, and is generally used in the manufacture of pneumatic tires,\r\nbelting, hose, etc. For boots, shoes, and other special work, calenders\r\nare used which are equipped with rolls engraved with the shapes of the\r\nsoles and other parts of the articles in question, so that the sheet\r\nof rubber coming from the machine has imprinted on it the shapes and\r\nthickness of the articles for which it is intended.\r\n\r\nAfter passing through such of the above processes as are required\r\nthe rubber is ready to be made up into the various articles known to\r\nthe rubber trade, such as boots and shoes, mackintoshes, waterproof\r\nfabrics, for balloons, aeroplanes, tentings, etc., mechanical goods,\r\nsuch as rubber heels, horseshoe pads, packing, tiling, automobile and\r\nother bumpers, artificial fish bait, etc., druggists’ sundries, such as\r\nnursing-bottles, nipples, syringes, bulbs, hot-water bottles, tubing,\r\netc. tobacco pouches, rubber belting, golf and other balls, insulated\r\nwire, fire and garden hose, inner tubes, tires, and the many other\r\ncommodities into the manufacture of which rubber enters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRADING ROOM]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are Automobile Tires Made?\r\n\r\nFrom the calender room of the rubber factory the stock is received\r\nin the automobile tire department, in the form of large rolls of\r\nrubber-coated fabric, and in rolls of sheeted rubber of various\r\nthicknesses and widths. The rubber-coated fabric is first cut into\r\nstrips of proper widths so that the edges will extend from bead to\r\nbead over the crown of the tire. These strips are always cut on the\r\nbias, generally at a 45-degree angle, with the edge of the roll, and\r\nwere formerly all cut on a cutting-table, a table about 50 feet long\r\nand 6 feet wide, covered with sheet metal. The cutting was done by two\r\nmen, each having a knife and each cutting half-way across the cloth\r\nalong the edge of a straight-edge so arranged as to be always set at 45\r\ndegrees with the edge of the table. This method of cutting is gradually\r\nbeing put aside by the use of the bias cutter, an extremely up-to-date\r\nmachine having jaws which ride up to the end of the fabric and pull\r\nit for a certain distance under a knife set at a 45-degree angle, the\r\nknife being set to cut just when the jaws have arrived at the limit of\r\ntheir motion. The action is repeated so that the machine cuts about\r\neighty strips a minute. These strips are fed onto a series of belts\r\nwhich carry them to where they are placed, by boys, into a book having\r\na leaf of common cloth between each strip of gum fabric, to prevent the\r\nstrips from sticking together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURING ROOM--SOLID TIRES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING A PNEUMATIC TIRE\r\n\r\nCURING ROOM, FIRST CURE--PNEUMATICS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPREADER ROOM.]\r\n\r\nThe majority of automobile tires to-day are machine built, but there\r\nare still a great many built by hand and this is the process we shall\r\ndescribe first. In this process the books of fabric are laid up and\r\nspliced into proper lengths to go around the tire and allow a proper\r\nlapping for the splices. The proper number of these laid-up pieces,\r\nor plies, as they are called, are placed together with cotton cloth\r\nbetween and taken to the tire builder. The tire builder mounts the\r\ncore, upon which the tire is to be built, on the building stand,\r\ngenerally cementing it so that the first ply of fabric will stick in\r\nplace. The first ply is then stretched onto the core and spliced,\r\nrolled down with a hand roller onto the sides of the core, and trimmed\r\nwith a knife at the base. The following plies are put on and rolled\r\ndown in the same manner, the beads being put in at the proper time,\r\naccording to the size and the number of plies to be used. After all the\r\nplies have been put onto the core the so-called cover rubber is put on.\r\nThis cover rubber is generally a sheet of rubber about one-sixteenth of\r\nan inch thick or more, and of the same compound as the rubber on the\r\nfabric.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE TREAD OF A TIRE IS MADE\r\n\r\nTREAD LAYING ROOM.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the machine-built tire, the result is the same, but the\r\nstock is handled as follows: After the rubber-coated fabric has been\r\ncut on the bias cutter, the strips are spliced and rolled up in rolls\r\non a spindle which is placed in the so-called tire-building machine.\r\nThe tire core is mounted on a stand attached to the machine, so that it\r\ncan be revolved by power, and the fabric is drawn onto the core from\r\nthe spindle under a certain definite tension. The tire-machines roll\r\nthe fabric down by power, and the beads are put into place before the\r\ntire and core are removed from the machine. Thereafter the process is\r\nthe same as in the case of the hand-built tires.\r\n\r\nAfter the cover rubber is in place the tire is ready to have the tread\r\napplied. The tread is made up independently of the tire by laying up\r\nnarrow strips of rubber, in different widths, in such a way that the\r\ncenter of the tread is thicker than the edges. In the case of the\r\nso-called single-cure tires, which are wholly vulcanized at one time,\r\nthis tread is applied to the tire directly after the cover, a strip of\r\nfabric called the breaker-strip generally being placed underneath, and\r\nthe building of the tire so completed.\r\n\r\nIn the general method of curing, the tire is allowed to remain on\r\nthe core, and is either bolted up in a mold and put into an ordinary\r\nheater, or it is laid in a mold and put into a heater press, where the\r\nhydraulic pressure keeps the two halves of the mold forced together\r\nduring the vulcanizing process. After the vulcanizing is completed, the\r\ntire is removed from the mold, the inside is painted with a French\r\ntalc mixture, the tire inspected and cleaned, and so made ready for the\r\nmarket. In some methods of curing, instead of the tire being put in a\r\nmold, it is put into a so-called toe-mold, which is virtually a pair of\r\nside flanges only reaching up as high as the edges of the tread on the\r\nside of the tire. After the flanges are fastened into place, the whole\r\nis cross-wrapped, the cross-wrapping coming in direct contact with\r\nthe tread. The tire in this condition is then put into the heater and\r\nvulcanized, giving the so-called wrapped tread tire. Still another form\r\nof curing is to inflate a kind of canvas inner tube inside the tire and\r\nplace the whole in a mold. This is known as the air-bag mold process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PNEUMATIC-TIRE ROOM--SHOWING TIRE-BUILDING MACHINES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are Inner Tubes Made?\r\n\r\nInner tubes for pneumatic tires may be classed under three headings,\r\naccording to the methods used in their manufacture, viz., seamed tubes,\r\nrolled tubes, and tube-machine tubes. By far the greater number of\r\ntubes come under the first two headings. For seamed tubes, the rubber\r\nis taken from the calender in the form of sheets from one-sixteenth to\r\nthree-sixteenths of an inch in thickness. These sheets are cut into\r\nstrips of proper length and just wide enough to make a tube of proper\r\ncross-section diameter when the two long edges are folded over and\r\nfastened together with rubber cement. These two long edges are cut on a\r\nbevel so that they make a good lap seam. The tube is then pulled over a\r\nmandrel of proper size and a thin piece of wet cloth rolled around it,\r\nand then it is spirally cross-wrapped with a long, narrow piece of wet\r\nduck for its entire length. The whole is then put into a regular heater\r\nand the tube vulcanized. After vulcanizing the wrapping is removed and\r\nthe tube stripped from the mandrel, turning the tube inside out, so\r\nthat the smooth side which is vulcanized next to the mandrel appears\r\noutside, and the rough side showing the marks of the cross-wrapping is\r\ninside. The valve hole is then punched in the tube, the valve inserted\r\nand the open ends of the tube buffed down to a feather edge. The tube\r\nin this state passes to the splicers, who cement the buffed ends and\r\nsplice them together, placing one open end within the other, making a\r\nlapped seam around the tube about 2¹⁄₂ inches long. The cement used\r\nin splicing is generally cured by an acid which chemically vulcanizes\r\nthe rubber without the application of heat. The tube is thus finished\r\nand ready for the market. Rolled tubes are made from very thin sheet\r\nrubber by rolling same over a mandrel of proper size, until the\r\nrequired number of layers of thin rubber have been rolled on to give\r\nthe tube the desired thickness. The tube is then wrapped, cured and\r\nspliced, in exactly the same manner as a seamed tube.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Rubber?\r\n\r\nCrude rubber is a vegetable product gathered from certain species of\r\ntrees, shrubs, vines and roots. Its characteristic peculiarities were\r\nearly recognized by the natives of the tropical countries in which it\r\nis found. Records of the earliest travelers in these countries show\r\nthat the natives had used various articles, such as receptacles, ties,\r\nclubs, etc., made from rubber, but it was not until about 1735 that\r\nrubber was first introduced into Europe. In civilization rubber was\r\nfirst used for pencil erasers and in waterproof cloth, and finally in\r\ncements. Vulcanizing, or the curing of rubber, was not discovered until\r\n1844, and thereafter the development of the rubber industry was very\r\nrapid, especially in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRAPPING ROOM--PNEUMATICS.]\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds and grades of rubber, and to-day these can be\r\ndivided into two chief classes, wild and cultivated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PNEUMATIC-TIRE ROOM, SHOWING TIRE FINISHING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE CRUDE RUBBER IS SECURED\r\n\r\nGathering Rubber in South America.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1.

A Palm Nut.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Balls of Crude Rubber.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tapping the Trees in Japan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How the Rubber Looks when it comes to Market.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carrying Balls of Crude Rubber to Native Market.]\r\n\r\nPictures herewith by courtesy of The B. F. Goodrich Company, Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Wild Rubber?\r\n\r\n~WHERE RUBBER COMES FROM~\r\n\r\nThe first class, or wild rubbers, are collected from trees which have\r\ngrown wild and where no cultivation processes whatsoever have been\r\nused. These rubber-producing trees, shrubs, etc., are found mostly in\r\nNorthern South America, Central America, Mexico, Central Africa and\r\nBorneo.\r\n\r\nThe finest rubber in the world is Fine Para, and is gathered in the\r\nAmazon regions of South America. This rubber has been gathered in\r\npractically the same way for over a century. The natives go out into\r\nthe forests and, selecting a rubber tree, cut “V”-shaped grooves in the\r\nbark with a special knife made for the purpose, these grooves being\r\ncut in herring-bone fashion diagonally around the tree, with one main\r\ngroove cut vertically down the center like the main vein in a leaf.\r\nThe latex, or milk-like liquid, of the tree, from which the rubber is\r\ntaken, flows from these veins and down the center vein into a little\r\ncup which the natives place to receive it. After the little cups are\r\nfilled they are gathered and brought into the rubber camp, and there\r\nthe latex is coagulated by means of smoke. This is done by the use of\r\na paddle which is alternately dipped into a bowl of the latex and then\r\nrevolved in the smoke from a wood or palm-nut fire. This smoke seems to\r\nhave a preservative effect on the rubber as well as drying it out and\r\ncausing it to harden on the paddle, each successive layer of the latex\r\ncausing the size of the rubber ball or biscuit to increase. When a\r\nbiscuit of sufficient size has been thus coagulated it is removed from\r\nthe paddle and is ready for shipment to countries where rubber products\r\nare manufactured.\r\n\r\nPara rubber is sold in three grades. Fine Para, which is the more\r\ncarefully coagulated or smoked rubber; Medium Para, which is rubber\r\ngathered and smoked in the same way as Fine, but which has had\r\ninsufficient smoking, and, therefore, more subject to deterioration due\r\nto oxidation, etc.; and Coarse Para, which is rubber gathered from the\r\ndrippings from the rubber trees after the cups have been removed. This\r\nlatter grade has generally a large percentage of bark and other foreign\r\nsubstances mixed with it, and is subject to even more deterioration\r\nthan is Medium Para, as it is oftentimes not smoked at all.\r\n\r\nAnother important grade of rubber coming from South America is Caucho.\r\nThis tree grows similar to the Para trees and the rubber is gathered\r\nin a similar manner, but is cured by adding to the latex some alkaline\r\nsolution and allowing the whole to dry out in the sun. The value of\r\nthis rubber can be greatly improved by better methods of coagulation.\r\n\r\nFrom Central America and Mexico comes the Castilloa rubber. This\r\nrubber is gathered from trees in a very similar manner to Para, and is\r\ncoagulated by being mixed with juices which are obtained by grinding\r\nup a certain plant which grows in the Castilloa districts. After being\r\nmixed with this plant juice, the Castilloa is spread out in sheets on\r\nbull hides, where it is allowed to dry in the sun, after which the\r\nrubber is rolled up and is ready for shipment. Castilloa is gathered\r\nmostly from wild trees, but in Mexico it has recently been cultivated\r\nto some extent.\r\n\r\nFrom Mexico we also get Guayule. This rubber is obtained from a certain\r\nspecies of shrub, the shrub being cut down and fed into a grinding or\r\npebble mill where the branches are crushed and ground and mixed with\r\nwater, and the rubber, which is contained in little particles all\r\nthrough the wood, is worked out, being taken from the pebble mills in\r\nchunks as large as a man’s fist.\r\n\r\nFrom Central Africa and from Borneo come the so-called African gums,\r\nsuch as Congo, Soudan, Massai, Lapori, Manicoba, Pontianic, etc. Some\r\nof these rubbers are gathered from trees, but most of them from vines\r\nand roots, and the methods of coagulation are varied. Practically all\r\nof them are dried out in the sun. These rubbers are all of lower grade\r\nthan the Para rubbers of South America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAGS OF CACAO BEANS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Stick of Chocolate\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Chocolate Come From?\r\n\r\nPerhaps no other one thing is so well known to boys and girls the world\r\nover as chocolate. Yet there was a time, and not so many years ago, as\r\nwe figure time in history, when there were no cakes of chocolate, or\r\nchocolate candies to be had in the candy shops, no chocolate flavored\r\nsoda water or chocolate cake. To-day quite a panic would be started if\r\nthe world’s supply of chocolate were cut off.\r\n\r\nChocolate is obtained from cacao, which is the seed of the cacao tree.\r\nIt is quite often called cocoa, although this is not quite a correct\r\nway of spelling the word. The cacao tree grows to a height of sixteen\r\nor eighteen feet when cultivated, but to a greater height when found\r\ngrowing wild. The cacao pod grows out from the trunk of the tree as\r\nshown in the picture, and is, when ripe, from seven to ten inches\r\nlong and from three to five inches in diameter, giving it the form\r\nof an ellipse. When you cut one of these pods open, you find five\r\ncompartments or cells, in each of which is a row of from five to ten\r\nseeds, which are imbedded in a soft pulp, which is pinkish in color.\r\nEach pod then contains from twenty-five to fifty seeds, which are what\r\nwe call “cocoa beans.”\r\n\r\nThe cacao tree was discovered for us by Christopher Columbus, so that\r\nwe have good reason to remember him aside from his great discovery of\r\nAmerica. The discovery of either of these would be fame enough for any\r\none man, and it would be difficult for some boys and girls to say just\r\nwhich of the two was Columbus’ greater discovery.\r\n\r\nColumbus found the cacao tree flourishing both in a wild and in a\r\ncultivated state upon one of his voyages to Mexico. The Indians of\r\nPeru and Mexico were very fond of it in its native state. They did not\r\nknow the joy of eating a chocolate cream, but they had discovered the\r\nqualities of the cacao bean as a food and had learned to cultivate it\r\nlong before Columbus came to Mexico.\r\n\r\nColumbus took some of the cacao beans back with him to Spain and to\r\nthis day cacao is much more extensively used by the Spaniards than by\r\nany other nation. The first record of its introduction into England is\r\nfound in an announcement in the _Public Advertiser_ of June 16, 1657,\r\nto the effect that:\r\n\r\n“In Bishopgate Street, in Queen’s Head Alley, at a Frenchman’s house,\r\nis an excellent West Indian drink called chocolate, to be sold where\r\nyou may have it ready at any time and also unmade, at reasonable rates.”\r\n\r\nOf course, by the time America became settled the people brought their\r\ntaste for chocolates with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF COCOA BEANS IN BAG AND COCOA-GRINDING MILL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Difference Between Cacao and Chocolate?\r\n\r\nWhen the cacao seeds are roasted and separated from the husks which\r\nsurround them, they are called cocoa-nibs. Cocoa consists of these nibs\r\nalone, whether they are ground or unground, dried and powdered, or of\r\nthe crude paste dried in flakes.\r\n\r\nChocolate is made from the cocoa-nibs. These nibs are ground into an\r\noily paste and mixed with sugar and vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, or other\r\nflavoring substances. Chocolate is only a product made from cocoa-nibs,\r\nbut it is the most important product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CACAO CRACKING MILL AND SHELL SEPARATOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOA CRACKING AND SHELL SEPARATOR.\r\n\r\n  WHERE THE SHELLS ARE SEPARATED FROM THE BEAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOA MILL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are Cocoa Shells?\r\n\r\nThere are other products which are obtained from the cacao seed. One is\r\ncalled Broma--which is the dry powder of the seeds, after the oil has\r\nbeen taken out.\r\n\r\nCocoa shells are the husks which surround the cocoa bean. These are\r\nground up into a fine powder and sold for making a kind of cocoa for\r\ndrinking, although the flavor is to a great extent missing and it is,\r\nof course, not nearly so nourishing as a drink of real cocoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOA ROASTER.\r\n\r\n  MILL IN WHICH THE BEANS ARE ROASTED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Cocoa Butter?\r\n\r\nThe oil from the cacao seeds, when separated from the seeds, is what we\r\ncall cocoa butter. It has a pleasant odor and chocolate-like taste. It\r\nis used in making soap, ointments, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW CACAO BEANS GROW\r\n\r\nCOCOA TREE WITH FRUIT KNOWN AS COCOA PODS, WHICH CONTAIN THE COCOA\r\nBEANS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is Cacao Gathered?\r\n\r\nWhen the cacao pods ripen on the tropical plantations, where the\r\nclimate is such that they can be grown successfully, the native laborer\r\ncuts off the ripened pods as we see him doing in the picture showing\r\nthe pods on the tree. He does this with a scissors-like arrangement of\r\nknives on a long pole.\r\n\r\nAs he cuts off the pods he lays them on the ground and leaves them to\r\ndry for twenty-four hours. The next day they are cut open, the seeds\r\ntaken out and carried to the place where they are cured or sweated.\r\n\r\nIn the process of curing or sweating, the acid which is found with the\r\nseeds is poured off. The beans are then placed in a sweating box. This\r\npart of the process is for the purpose of making the beans ferment and\r\nis the most important part of preparing the beans for market, as the\r\nquality and the flavor of the beans and, therefore, their value in the\r\nmarket, depends largely upon the ability of whoever does it in curing\r\nor fermenting.\r\n\r\nSometimes the curing is done by placing the seeds in trenches or holes\r\nin the ground and covering them with earth or clay. This is called\r\nthe clay-curing process. The time required in curing the cacao beans\r\nvaries, but on the average requires two days. When cured they are\r\ndried by exposure to the sun and packed ready for shipping. At this\r\ntime beans of fine quality are found to have a warm reddish color. The\r\nquality or grades of beans are determined by the color at this stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOCOLATE MILL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Chocolate is Made.\r\n\r\nWhen the cacao beans arrive at the chocolate factory they are put\r\nthrough various processes to develop their aroma, palatability and\r\ndigestibility.\r\n\r\n~PROCESSES IN CHOCOLATE MAKING~\r\n\r\nThe seeds are first roasted. In roasting the substance which develops\r\nthe aroma is formed. The roasting is accomplished in revolving\r\ncylinders, much like the revolving peanut roasters, only much larger.\r\nAfter roasting the seeds are transferred to crushing and winnowing\r\nmachines. The crushing machines break the husks or “shells,” and the\r\nwinnowing machine by the action of a fan separates the shells from the\r\nactual kernel or bean. The beans are now called cocoa-nibs. These nibs\r\nare now in turn winnowed, but in smaller quantities at a time, during\r\nwhich process the imperfect pieces are removed with other foreign\r\nsubstances. Cacao beans in this form constitute the purest and simplest\r\nform of cacao in which it is sold. The objection to their use in this\r\nform is that it is necessary to boil them for a much longer time, in\r\norder to disintegrate them, than when they are ground up in the form of\r\nmeal. For that reason the nibs are generally ground before marketing as\r\ncacao or cocoa.\r\n\r\nAnother form in which the pure seeds are prepared is the flaked\r\ncocoa. This is accomplished by grinding up the nibs into a paste.\r\nThis grinding is done in a revolving cylinder machine in which a drum\r\nrevolves. In this process the heat developed by the friction in the\r\nmachine is sufficient to liquefy the oil in the beans and form the\r\npaste. The oil then solidifies again in the paste when it becomes cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOCOLATE FINISHER.]\r\n\r\nWhat we know as cakes of chocolate are made from the cocoa-nibs by\r\nheating the mixture of the cacao, sugar and such flavoring extracts as\r\nvanilla, until an even paste is secured. This paste is passed several\r\ntimes between heavy rollers to get a thorough mixture and finally\r\npoured into molds and allowed to cool. When cool it can be taken from\r\nthe molds in firm cakes and wrapped for the market. This is the way\r\nMilk Chocolate is made. The difference in the taste and consistency of\r\nmilk chocolate depends upon how many different things the chocolate\r\nmaker adds to the pure cocoa-nibs to produce this mixture. Often\r\nsubstances such as starchy materials are added to make the cakes more\r\nfirm. They add nothing to the quality of the chocolate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOCOLATE MIXER.]\r\n\r\n~HOW CHOCOLATE CANDIES ARE MADE~\r\n\r\nChocolate-covered bonbons, chocolate drops, and the many different\r\nkinds of toothsome confections are prepared in the American candy\r\nfactories, as we all well know. The chocolate covering of this\r\nconfectionery is generally put on by dipping the inside of the choice\r\nmorsel in a pan of liquid chocolate paste and then placing the bits in\r\ntins to allow them to cool and harden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOCOLATE MIXING AND HEATING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nA great many of the choicest bits of confectionery are now produced by\r\nmachines entirely. These machines are almost human, apparently, as we\r\nsee them make a perfect chocolate bonbon which is delivered to a candy\r\nbox all wrapped for packing. These wonderful machines thus give us\r\ncandy which has not been touched by the hands of any one prior to the\r\ntime we thrust our own fingers in the brightly-decorated box and take\r\nour pick of the assortment it offers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF CONFECTION ARE WRAPPED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TALLEST BUILDING IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nWOOLWORTH BUILDING, NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\nThis building, the tallest in the world, is equipped with 26 gearless\r\ntraction elevators.\r\n\r\nTwo of the elevators run from the first to the fifty-first floor with\r\nactual travels of 679 feet 9¹⁄₂ inches and 679 feet 10¹⁄₄ inches,\r\nrespectively. There is also a shuttle elevator which runs from the\r\nfifty-first to the fifty-fourth floor.\r\n\r\nTotal height of building from curb to base of flagstaff, 792 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW AN ELEVATOR GOES UP AND DOWN\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE GEARLESS TRACTION ELEVATOR INSTALLATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does an Elevator Go Up and Down?\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, when we think of an elevator we think merely of the cage or\r\ncar in which we ride up or down. But the car is really only the part\r\nwhich makes the elevator of service to man, and from the standpoint of\r\nthe machinery, is a relatively unimportant part of the equipment.\r\n\r\nThere are two principal types of elevators used to-day; the hydraulic,\r\nwhich is worked by water under pressure, and the electric, which is\r\nworked by electricity through an electric motor. The latter type,\r\nbecause of the tendency towards the general use of electricity in\r\nrecent years, has largely superseded the hydraulic, and, as when you\r\nthink of elevators you probably have in mind those you have seen in\r\nsome huge skyscraper, we shall look at one of these.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the Principal Parts of an Elevator?\r\n\r\nThe most advanced type of elevator to-day is called a Gearless Traction\r\nElevator. In this elevator the principal parts are a motor, a grooved\r\nwheel on the motor shaft called a driving sheave and a brake, all\r\nmounted on one cast-iron bed-plate; a number of cables of equal length\r\nwhich pass over the driving sheave and thence around another grooved\r\nwheel called an idler sheave, located just below the driving sheave,\r\nand to one end of which is attached the car or cage, and to the other\r\nend a weight called a counterweight; also a controller which governs\r\nthe flow of electric current into the motor and thereby the speed,\r\nstarts and stops of the elevator car. Although the controller, motor,\r\nbrake and sheaves are usually placed way at the top of the building out\r\nof our sight, they are really very important parts of the elevator.\r\n\r\nThe cage or car in which we ride is held in place by tracks built\r\nupright in the elevator shaft, and the counterweight at one side of the\r\nshaft travels up and down along two separate upright tracks. When the\r\ncar goes up the counterweight on the other end of the cables goes down\r\nan equal distance. The counterweight is used to balance the load of the\r\ncar and to make it easier for the motor to move the car.\r\n\r\nElectricity is the power that makes the car go up or down. The operator\r\nin the car moves a master switch--in one direction if he wishes to go\r\nup, in the other direction if he wishes to go down. This master switch\r\nsets the electro-magnetic switches of the controller at the top of the\r\nhatchway into action, electrically, and the controller in turn allows\r\nthe electric current to flow into the motor. The motor then begins\r\nto revolve, gradually at first, and then faster, turning the driving\r\nsheave with which it is directly connected. As this driving sheave\r\nrevolves, the cables passing over it are set in motion, and the car and\r\ncounterweight to which they are attached begin to move.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Not the Car Fall?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRINCIPAL PARTS OF AN ELEVATOR]\r\n\r\nOf course, the question of safety is a very important one in any\r\nelevator, and you wonder what would happen if the cables broke. You\r\nthink of this especially when you are going up in one of the big\r\nskyscrapers--where the elevators sometimes travel to a height of 700\r\nfeet. It can be truthfully said that on every modern elevator there\r\nare safety devices which should make it practically impossible to have\r\na serious accident, due to the fall of the car. Every elevator is\r\nequipped with wedging or clamping devices which automatically grip the\r\nrails in case the car goes too fast either up or down. These gripping\r\ndevices can be adjusted to work at any speed that is desired above the\r\nregular speed. It is not at all probable that all the cables will break\r\nat once, because there are usually six of these, and any one of them is\r\nstrong enough to hold the car if the others break; but even if they all\r\nshould break the gripping devices on the rails will operate and hold\r\nthe car safely, just as soon as it starts down at great speed.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the car should descend at full speed, but not sufficiently\r\nfast to work the rail-gripping devices, it would be brought to a\r\ngradual rest at the bottom of the hatchway, because of the oil-cushion\r\nbuffer against which it would strike. This is a remarkable invention,\r\nwith a plunger working in oil in such a way that a car striking it\r\nat full speed will come to rest so gradually that there is scarcely\r\nany shock. You have perhaps seen a clever juggler on the stage throw\r\nan ordinary hen’s egg high into the air and catch it in a china dish\r\nwithout cracking it He does it by putting the dish under the falling\r\negg just at the right moment, and bringing the dish down with the egg\r\nat just the right speed, so that eventually he has the egg in the dish\r\nwithout cracking it. The trick is in calculating the rate of speed of\r\nthe falling egg accurately and adjusting the insertion of the dish\r\nunder the falling egg to a nicety. The oil-cushion buffer in the modern\r\nelevator works in very much the same way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF ROPING FOR GEARLESS TRACTION\r\nELEVATOR INSTALLATION.]\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the genius which has made possible these new types\r\nof elevators we could not have the high buildings. The elevators in the\r\nWoolworth Building are the latest type in modern elevator construction.\r\nIn this one building alone there are 29 elevators, and when you are\r\ntold that the electric elevators in the United States installed by\r\na single company represent a total of 525,000 horse-power, you will\r\nhave some idea of the power required to operate elevators all over the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Air Weigh Anything?\r\n\r\n\r\nAir is very light, so light that it seems to have no weight at all;\r\nbut, if you will think a minute you will see that it must have some\r\nweight, because birds fly in it and balloons can be made to float\r\nthrough it. It has been found that one hundred cubic inches of air\r\nat the sea level weighs, under ordinary conditions, about thirty-one\r\ngrains. This seems a very small weight, but when we remember the\r\nthickness of the atmospheric envelope over the earth we see that it\r\nmust press quite heavily upon the earth’s surface. There is a very\r\nsimple instrument called a barometer, which is used for measuring the\r\namount of this pressure. The name means pressure-measure.\r\n\r\nAnother striking feature of air is its elasticity, and this explains\r\nsomething that is noticed by all mountain climbers. On a high mountain,\r\nit is difficult to get enough air to the lungs, though one breathes\r\nrapidly and deeply. The reason is, that the air at the foot of the\r\nmountain is compressed by the weight of that above it, and consequently\r\nthe lungs can hold more of it than of the air on the mountain top,\r\nwhich has less weight resting upon it and is, therefore, not so much\r\ncompressed. On account of the ease with which it is compressed, we find\r\nthat more than half of all the envelope of air that surrounds the earth\r\nis within three miles of the surface.\r\n\r\nWhen air is chemically analyzed it is found to consist of a number of\r\nsubstances mingled together, but not chemically united. These include\r\nnitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbonic acid gas, water vapor, ozone, nitric\r\nacid, ammonia, and dust.\r\n\r\nOxygen is the most important of these constituents, for it is the part\r\nthat is necessary to support life. Yet, notwithstanding its importance,\r\nit forms only about one-fifth of the entire bulk of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOxygen is a very interesting substance and many striking experiments\r\nmay be performed with it. If a lighted candle is thrust into a vessel\r\nfilled with oxygen, it burns very much more rapidly and brilliantly\r\nthan in air. A piece of wood with a mere spark on it bursts into flame\r\nand burns brightly when thrust into oxygen, and some things that will\r\nnot burn at all in air, can be made to burn very rapidly in oxygen. For\r\nexample, if a piece of clock spring be dipped in melted sulphur and\r\nthen put into a jar of oxygen, after the sulphur has been set on fire,\r\nthe steel spring will take fire and burn fiercely. The heat produced is\r\nso great that drops of molten steel form at the end of the spring, and\r\nfalling on the bottom of the jar, melt the surface of the glass where\r\nthey strike.\r\n\r\nThe other two substances found in pure air, nitrogen and argon, are\r\nvery much alike. They make up the remaining four-fifths of the air, and\r\nare very different from oxygen in nearly every respect.\r\n\r\nNitrogen and argon resemble oxygen in being colorless, odorless, and\r\ntasteless gases; and they are of nearly the same weight as oxygen,\r\nargon being a little heavier and nitrogen a little lighter; but here\r\nthe similarity ends. Oxygen is what we call a very active substance.\r\nAs we have seen, it causes things to burn very much more rapidly in it\r\nthan in air. Nitrogen and argon, on the contrary, put out fire. If a\r\nlighted candle is put into a jar of nitrogen or argon its flame will be\r\nextinguished as quickly as if put into water.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the impurities found in air. Of these the most\r\nimportant is carbonic acid gas, or, as it is frequently called, carbon\r\ndioxide. It is always produced when wood or coal is burned, and\r\nis, of course, constantly being poured out of chimneys. It is also\r\nproduced in our lungs and we give off some of it when we breathe. It\r\nis colorless, like the gases found in pure air, has no odor or taste,\r\nand is considerably heavier than oxygen or nitrogen. In its other\r\nproperties it is much more like nitrogen than oxygen, for when a\r\ncandle is put into it the flame is extinguished at once. To find out\r\nwhether air contains carbonic acid gas, it is only necessary to force\r\nit through a little lime water, in a glass vessel, and watch what\r\nchange takes place in the water. Fresh lime water is as clear as pure\r\nwater; but after forcing air containing carbonic acid through it, it\r\nbecomes turbid and milky. If the turbid water is allowed to stand for\r\na time, a white powder will settle to the bottom, and if we examine\r\nthis powder, we find it to be very much the same thing as chalk. While\r\nit is true that air generally contains only a very small portion of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, there are some places in which it is present in such\r\nlarge quantities as to render the air unfit for breathing. The air at\r\nthe bottom of deep mines and old wells often has an unusually large\r\nproportion of this gas, which, because of its great weight, accumulates\r\nat the bottom, and remains confined there. The presence of a dangerous\r\nquantity of the gas in such places may be detected by lowering a candle\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does the Scenery Appear to Move When We Are Riding in a Train?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you sit in a moving train looking out of the window it appears\r\nas though the fields, the telegraph poles and everything else outside\r\nwere moving, instead of you. This is because our only ideas of motion\r\nare arrived at by comparison, and the fact that neither you nor the\r\nseats of the car or any other part of the inside of the car is changing\r\nits position, leads you to the delusion that the things outside the\r\ncar are moving and not you. If you were to pull down all the curtains\r\nand the train were making no noise at all, you would not think that\r\nanything was moving. It would appear as though you were motionless just\r\nas everything in the car appears so. When you turn then to the window,\r\nand lift the curtain you carry in the back of your mind the idea of\r\nbeing at rest and that is what makes it appear as though the fields and\r\neverything outside were moving in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly noticeable when you are in a train in a station\r\nwith another train on the next track. There is a sense of motion if one\r\nof the trains only is moving and you feel that it is the other train,\r\nbecause you are surrounded by objects in the car which are at rest,\r\nand when you look out at the other train with this half consciousness\r\nof rest in your mind, it appears as though the other train were moving\r\nwhen as a matter of fact it is your train. If the delusion happens to\r\nbe turned the other way, it will appear as though you are moving and\r\nthe other is still. It depends upon what cause the impression starts\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Don’t the Scenery Appear to Move When I am in a Street Car?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are in a street car in the country and moving along fast you\r\nwill receive the same impression, especially in a closed car, because\r\nyou are looking out of one hole or one window. In an open car you\r\ndo not receive the same impression because your range of vision is\r\nbroader. You can and do, although perhaps unconsciously, look out on\r\nboth sides and the impression your mind gets through the eyes is not\r\nthe same. If you were to pull down all the storm curtains in a moving\r\nopen street car, and then look out of one little crack, you would think\r\nthe outside was moving. But if you stop to remember that you are moving\r\nand not the things outside the car, then the impression vanishes. In\r\nthe city, of course, your brain is so thoroughly impressed with the\r\nfact that houses and pavements do not move, and the cars move so much\r\nmore slowly, that it is difficult to make yourself believe otherwise.\r\nThe impression is more difficult always when you are moving through\r\nor past objects with which you are perfectly familiar. It is all, of\r\ncourse, a question of impressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does the Moon Travel With Us When We Walk or Ride?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon does not really travel with us. It only seems to do so. The\r\nmoon is so far away that when we walk a block or two or a hundred, we\r\ncannot notice any relative difference in the relative positions of the\r\nmoon and ourselves. When a thing is close at hand we can notice every\r\nchange in our position toward it, but when it is far away the change of\r\nour position toward it is so slight that it is hardly perceptible. A\r\nvery good way to illustrate this is to ask you to recall the last time\r\nyou were in a railroad train looking out at the scenery in the country.\r\nThe telegraph poles rush past you so fast you cannot count them. The\r\ncows in the pasture beside the railroad do not seem to go by so fast.\r\nYou can count them easily. The tree farther over in the next field does\r\nnot appear to be moving but slightly, while the church steeple which\r\nyou can see far in the distance, does not go out of sight for a long\r\ntime--in fact, seems almost to be moving along with you. The moon is\r\njust like the church steeple in this case, except that it is so much\r\nfarther away that it seems to travel right with you. It is all due to\r\nthe fact as stated at the beginning of this answer, that the relative\r\npositions of yourself and the moon are only slightly changed as you\r\nmove from place to place, so slight in fact as to appear imperceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs There a Man in the Moon?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe markings which we see on the face of the moon when it is full can\r\nby a stretch of the imagination be said to form the face of a man. On\r\nsome nights this face appears to be quite distinct. If, however, we\r\nlook at the moon through a telescope, we see distinctly that it is\r\nnot the face of a man. Through a very large telescope we can see very\r\nplainly that the marks are mountains and craters of extinct volcanoes.\r\nIt just happens that these marks on the moon, aided by the reflections\r\nof the light from the sun, which gives the moon all the light it has,\r\nmake a combination that looks like a face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the Air Surrounding the Earth Move With It?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the old puzzling questions which many a high-school\r\nstudent has had to struggle with to the great amusement of the teacher\r\nwho asks for the information and such other scholars who have already\r\nhad the experience of trying to solve it.\r\n\r\nTo get at the right answer you have merely to ask one other question.\r\nIf the air does not revolve with the earth, why can’t I go up in\r\na balloon at New York, and stay up long enough for the earth to\r\nrevolve on its axis beneath me, and come down again when the city of\r\nSan Francisco appears under the balloon, which should be in about\r\nfour hours? If that were possible, travel would be both rapid and\r\ncomfortable, for then we could sit quietly in a balloon while the earth\r\ntraveling beneath us would get all the bumps.\r\n\r\nNo, the atmosphere surrounding the earth moves right along with the\r\nearth on its axis. If it were not so, the earth would probably burn\r\nup--at least no living thing could remain on it--since the friction of\r\nthe surface of the air against the surface of the earth would develop\r\nsuch a heat that nothing could live in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Oiling the Axle Make the Wheel Turn More Easily?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you look at what appears to be a perfectly smooth axle on a bicycle\r\nor motor car through a powerful magnifying glass, you will find that\r\nthe surface of the axle is not smooth at all, as you may have thought,\r\nbut covered with what appear to be quite large bumps or irregularities\r\nin the surface. If you were to examine the inside of the hub of the\r\nwheel in the same way, you would find that it also is like that. Now,\r\nwhen you attempt to turn a wheel on the axle without oil, these little\r\nirregularities or bumps grind against each other, producing what we\r\ncall friction. As friction develops heat, the metal of the axle and the\r\nhub expand and the wheel gets stuck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Made the Mountains?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that at one time the surface of the earth was\r\nsmooth, i. e., there were no big hills and no deep valleys. That was\r\nbefore the mountains were made. The earth was a hot molten mass that\r\nbegan to cool off from the outside inward. It is still a hot molten\r\nmass inside today. The outside crust became cooler and cooler and the\r\ncrust became deeper and deeper all the time. Then when there would be\r\nan eruption of the red-hot mass inside, the earth’s crust would be\r\nbulged out in some places and sucked in in others and would stay that\r\nway. The bulged out place became a range of mountains and the sucked\r\nin place became a valley. This process went on happening over and over\r\nagain until the crust of the earth became firmly set. Volcanos caused\r\nsome of these eruptions, as also did earthquakes. There are today\r\ngradual changes occurring which to a certain extent change the outside\r\nsurface of the earth, and it is possible that new mountain ranges will\r\nbe produced in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the Sea Roar?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe roar of the sea is a movement of the sea which causes the same kind\r\nof air waves or sound waves that you make when you shout, excepting\r\nthat, of course, the vibrations do not occur so quickly in the sea and,\r\ntherefore, the sound produced is a low sound. It is no different in\r\nany sense than the same noise would be if the same air waves could be\r\nproduced on the land away from the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Is Fire Hot?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a fire is lighted it throws off what we call heat rays or waves.\r\nThese waves are very much like the waves of light which come from a\r\nlight or fire or the air waves which produce sounds. The rays of light\r\nand heat which come from the sun are like the rays of light and heat\r\nfrom a fire. Heat is of two kinds--heat proper which is resident in the\r\nbody, and radiant heat which is the kind which comes to us from the\r\nsun or from a fire. This radiant heat is not heat at all, but a form\r\nof wave motion thrown out by the vibrations in the ether. The heat we\r\nfeel is the sensation produced upon our skins when it comes in contact\r\nwith the waves created by the fire. Heat was formerly thought to be an\r\nactual substance, but we know now that radiant heat is known to be the\r\nenergy of heat transferred to the ether which fills all of space and is\r\nin all bodies also. The hot body which sets the particles of either in\r\nvibration and this vibrating motion in the form of waves travels in all\r\ndirections. When these vibrations strike against our skin they produce\r\na heat sensation; striking other objects these vibrations may produce\r\ninstead of a heat sensation, either chemical action or luminosity. This\r\nis determined by the length of the vibratory rays in each case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I Throw a Ball Into the Air While Walking, Why Does It Follow Me?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you throw a ball into the air while moving your body forward or\r\nbackward, either slowly or fast, the ball partakes of two motions--the\r\none upward and the forward or backward motion of your body. The ball\r\npossessed the motion of your body before it left your hand to go up\r\ninto the air because your body was moving before you threw it up, and\r\nthe ball was a part of you at the time.\r\n\r\nIf you are moving forward up to the time you throw the ball into the\r\nair and stop as soon as you let go of the ball, it will fall at some\r\ndistance from you. Also if you throw the ball up from a standing\r\nposition and move forward as soon as the ball leaves your hand the ball\r\nwill fall behind you, provided you actually threw it straight up.\r\n\r\nOf course, you know that the earth is moving many miles per hour on\r\nits axis and that when you throw a ball straight into the air from a\r\nstanding position, the earth and yourself as well as the ball move\r\nwith the earth a long distance before the ball comes down again. The\r\nrelative position is, however, the same. We get our sense of motion by\r\na comparison with other objects. If you are in a train that is moving\r\nswiftly and another train goes by in the opposite direction moving just\r\nas fast, you seem to be going twice as fast as you really are. If the\r\ntrain on the other track, however, is going at the same rate of speed\r\nand in the same direction as you are, you will appear to be standing\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the ball again, you will find that it always partakes of\r\nthe motion of the body holding it in addition to the motion given when\r\nit is thrown up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Good Are the Lines On the Palms of Our Hands?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the lines on the palms of our hands are of any\r\ngreat service to us. Indeed it is doubtful if they are of any value\r\nin themselves, outside of the possible aid they may be in helping us\r\nto determine the character of the surface of things which we grasp or\r\ntouch. It is possible that they aid in some slight degree in this way.\r\nThere is little doubt, however, that they are a result of the work the\r\nhands are constantly called upon to do rather than contrived for any\r\nparticular service. The habitual tendency of the fingers in grasping\r\nand holding things throws the skin of the palms into creases which\r\nthrough frequent repetition make the lines of the palms permanent in\r\nseveral instances.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of these lines or creases in various individuals\r\nas to details and length and variations is the chief basis of the\r\nso-called science of palmistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Things Whirl Round When I Am Dizzy?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medical term that describes this condition of turning or whirling\r\nis vertigo, which means in simple language “to turn.” There are two\r\nkinds of dizziness--one where the objects about us seem to be turning\r\nround and round and the other where the person who is dizzy seems to\r\nhimself to be turning round and round.\r\n\r\nOne cause of this is due to the fact that when you are dizzy the\r\neyes are not in complete control of the brain and the eyes moving\r\nindependently of each other look in different directions and produce\r\nthis turning effect on the brain, since each eye then sends a different\r\nimpression to the brain instantly.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of the sense of dizziness is, however, the little\r\norgan which gives us our power to balance and which is located near the\r\nears. Sometimes this organ becomes diseased and people affected in this\r\nway are almost continually dizzy. Whenever this organ of balance is\r\ndisturbed we lose our idea of balance and the turning sensation occurs.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to make yourself dizzy. All you do is to turn round a few\r\ntimes in the same direction and stop. In doing this you disturb the\r\nlittle organ of balance and things begin to turn apparently before your\r\neyes. If you turn the other way you right matters again or if you just\r\nstand still matters will right themselves. There is no great harm in\r\nmaking yourself dizzy and very little fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are the Complexions of Some People Light and Others Dark?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis difference in the complexions of people is due to the varying\r\namounts of pigment or coloring material in the cells of which the skins\r\nof all animals is made up. Very light people have very little pigment;\r\nvery dark people, those with dark eyes and black hair, have a great\r\ndeal of this coloring material in their cells. A great many people are\r\nneither light or very dark. They have less than the dark-complexioned\r\npeople and more than the light-complexioned people. When the hair\r\nturns gray it is because the pigment has disappeared. As this is due\r\nto the loss of this coloring material, dark-complexioned people turn\r\ngray sooner than light-complexioned people. The structure of the skin\r\nshowing how these cells are made in layers can be seen by examining the\r\nskin with a microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Me Tired?\r\n\r\n\r\nMen were wrong for a long time in their conclusions as to what produced\r\nthe tired feeling in us.\r\n\r\nWe know now that every activity of our body registers itself on the\r\nbrain. When we move an arm or leg a great many times we soon feel\r\ntired. Every time you move your arm the movement is registered in the\r\nbrain, and after a number of these movements are registered the tired\r\nfeeling in the arm appears. It is said that every movement of any part\r\nof the body really produces certain defective cells and that these\r\naccumulate in the blood. When these reach a certain number the tired\r\nfeeling takes possession of us, and when we rest, the blood under\r\nthe guidance of the brain, goes to work and rebuilds these defective\r\ncells. We know that a change takes place in the blood when we become\r\ntired because, if you take some of the blood from an animal that shows\r\nunmistakable signs of fatigue and inject it into an animal that shows\r\nno tired feeling at all, the second animal will begin to show signs of\r\nfatigue even though it is not active at all.\r\n\r\nWe used to think that being tired indicated that our bodies were in\r\nneed of food and that the way to overcome it was to eat a big meal.\r\nWe did not stop to think that even when we are hungry the human body\r\nhas sufficient food supply stored up to keep it going for days without\r\ntaking in new food. Of course, this mistake was made because we knew\r\nthat our power and energy came as a result of the food we took into our\r\nsystems, but this belief was exploded when it was found that a really\r\ntired person could hardly digest food while tired, and that it is best\r\nfor people who are very tired to eat only a light meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Most People Right-Handed?\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people are right-handed because they are trained that way. Being\r\nright-handed or left-handed depends largely on how we get started in\r\nthat connection. When we are young we form the habit generally of\r\nbeing either right-handed or left-handed, as the case may be. Most\r\npeople correct their children when it appears they are likely to\r\nbecome left-handed, as we have come to think that it is better to be\r\nright-handed than left, and that is the reason why most people are\r\nright-handed. As a matter of fact, if we were trained perfectly, we\r\nshould all be both right-handed and left-handed also. Some people are\r\nso trained and, when we refer to their ability to do things equally\r\nwell with both hands and wish to bring out this fact, we say they are\r\nambidextrous. It is not natural that one hand should be trained to do\r\nthings while the other is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Some Faculties Stronger Than Others?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of our senses are capable of being developed so that our ability\r\nalong these lines would be about equal. The trouble is that we soon\r\nbegin to develop one or more of our faculties in an unusual manner at\r\nthe expense of the development of others. Many people have a keener\r\nsense of observation than others because they have had more and better\r\ntraining along that line. It is a pity that more attention is not given\r\nto the development of the power of observation in children, because\r\nit is one of the most valuable accomplishments that we can possess\r\nourselves of. With the sense of observation developed to the highest\r\ndegree, many of the other faculties need not be developed so strongly\r\nbecause, if we notice every thing that it is possible for us to see,\r\nwe do not have the need of the development of other powers to the same\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nIt is said that it would be possible to so train an infant and bring\r\nhim up to maturity with all his faculties developed and in practically\r\nan even way. If we did that we would have a wonderfully intelligent\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Glazing plates.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decorating china cups.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Cup and Saucer\r\n\r\n\r\n~HOW CHINA IS MADE~\r\n\r\nMany different kinds of raw materials are required to produce the clay\r\nfrom which china is formed, and these ingredients come from widely\r\nseparated localities. Clays from Florida, North Carolina, Cornwall and\r\nDevon. Flint from Illinois and Pennsylvania. Boracic acid from the\r\nMojave Desert and Tuscany. Cobalt from Ontario and Saxony. Feldspar\r\nfrom Maine. All these and more must enter into the making of every\r\npiece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grinders for reducing glazing materials.]\r\n\r\nThese materials are reduced to fine powder and stored in huge bins.\r\nBetween these bins, on a track provided for the purpose, the workmen\r\npush a car which bears a great box. Under this box is a scale for\r\nweighing the exact amount of each ingredient as it is put in, for too\r\nmuch of one kind of clay or too little of another would seriously\r\nimpair the quality of the finished china.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mill for pulverizing materials.]\r\n\r\nFrom bin to bin this car goes, gathering up so many pounds of this\r\nmaterial and so many pounds of that, until its load is complete. Then\r\nit is dumped into one of the great round tanks called “blungers,” where\r\nbig electrically driven paddles mix it with water until it has the\r\nconsistency of thick cream. From the blungers this liquid mass passes\r\ninto another and still larger tank, called a “rough agitator,” and is\r\nthere kept constantly in motion until it is released to run in a steady\r\nstream over the “sifters.”\r\n\r\nThese sifters are vibrating tables of finest silk lawn, very much\r\nlike that used for bolting flour at the mills. The material for\r\nchina making strains through the silk, while the refuse, including\r\nall foreign matter, little lumps, etc., runs into a waste trough and\r\nis thrown away. From the sifters the liquid passes through a square\r\nbox-like chute, in which are placed a number of large horseshoe\r\nmagnets, which attract to themselves and hold any particles of harmful\r\nminerals which may be in the mixture.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the magnets the fluid is free from impurities, and is\r\ndischarged into another huge tank called the “smooth agitator.” While\r\nthe fluid is in this tank a number of paddles keep it constantly in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pressing the water from the clay.]\r\n\r\nFrom the smooth agitator the mixture is forced under high pressure into\r\na press where a peculiar arrangement of steel chambers packed with\r\nheavy canvas allows the water to escape, filtered pure and clear, but\r\nretains the clay in discs or leaves weighing about thirty pounds each.\r\nFrom the presses this damp clay is taken out to the “pug mills,” where\r\nit is all ground up together, reduced to a uniform consistency, and\r\ncut into blocks of convenient size. It is now ready to use. Automatic\r\nelevators carry it to the workmen upstairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Molding Dishes. The racks to the left are full of molds\r\non which the clay is drying.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Molding sugar bowls and covered dishes.]\r\n\r\n~HOW THE DISHES ARE SHAPED~\r\n\r\nThe exact process of handling the clay differs with articles of\r\ndifferent shapes. Some are molded by hand in plaster of paris molds of\r\nproper shape, while others are formed by machine. To make a plate, for\r\nexample, the workman takes a lump of clay as large as a teacup. He lays\r\nthis on a flat stone, and with a large, round, flat weight, strikes it\r\na blow which flattens the material out until it resembles dough rolled\r\nout for cake or biscuits, only instead of being white or yellow it is\r\nof a dark gray color. A hard, smooth mold exactly the size and shape\r\nof the inside of the plate is at hand. Over this the workman claps the\r\nflat piece of damp clay. Then the mold is passed on to another workman,\r\nwho stands before a rapidly revolving pedestal, commonly known as the\r\npotter’s wheel. On this wheel he places the mold and its layer of clay.\r\nHe then pulls down a lever to which is attached a steel scraper. As the\r\nplate rapidly revolves, this scraper cuts away the surplus clay, and\r\ngives to the back of the plate its proper form. The plate, still in its\r\nmold, is placed on a long board, together with a number of others, and\r\nshoved into a rack to dry. One workman with two helpers will make 2,400\r\nplates per day. It is fascinating to watch the molders’ deft hands at\r\nwork swiftly changing a mass of clay into perfectly formed dishes. Such\r\nskilled workmen are naturally well paid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interior of a kiln showing how the “saggers” are packed\r\nfor firing.]\r\n\r\nWhen the clay is sufficiently dry, the plate is taken from its mold,\r\nthe edge smoothed and rounded, and any minor defects remedied. It\r\nis then placed in an oval shaped clay receptacle called a “sagger,”\r\ntogether with about two dozen of its fellows, packed in fine sand,\r\nand placed in one of the furnaces or kilns. Each kiln will contain on\r\nan average two thousand saggers. When the kiln is full the doorway\r\nis closed and plastered with clay, the fires started, and the dishes\r\nsubjected to terrific heat for a period of forty-eight hours. The\r\nfuel used is natural gas, piped one hundred miles from wells 2,000\r\nfeet deep. Natural gas gives an intense heat, and yet is always under\r\nperfect control--features which are vital in producing uniformly good\r\nchina.\r\n\r\nWhen the plate is taken from the kiln after the first baking, it is\r\npure white, but of dull, velvety texture, and is known as bisque ware.\r\n\r\nIn order to give it a smooth, high finish, the plate is next dipped\r\ninto a solution of white lead, borax and silica, dried, placed in a\r\nkiln and again baked. When it is taken out for the second time it\r\nhas acquired that beautiful glaze which so delights the eye. In this\r\ncondition it is known as “plain white ware,” and is finished, unless\r\nsome decoration is to be added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Taking the dishes from a kiln.]\r\n\r\n~HOW CHINA IS DECORATED~\r\n\r\nMost people are surprised to learn that the greater part of the\r\ngold which adorns dishes is put on by a simple rubber stamp. Two\r\npreparations of gold are used. One is a commercial solution called\r\n“liquid bright gold,” the other is very expensive, and is simply gold\r\nbullion melted down with acids to the right consistency.\r\n\r\nDecorating in colors is now done almost exclusively by decalcomania art\r\ntransfers. These are made principally in Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter the gold and colors are applied, the China must again go through\r\nthe oven’s heat for a period of twelve hours. Then the piece finished\r\nat last, is ready to grace your table. The dull gray clay has become\r\nbeautifully finished china, which will delight alike the housekeeper\r\nand her guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do Birds Find Their Way?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most interesting phase of the movement of animals from place to\r\nplace is found in the flight of birds during the spring and fall. In\r\nthe spring the birds come north and in the fall they go south. This is\r\ncalled “migration” and the reason given for the ability of some birds\r\nto come back every year to build a nest in the same tree is usually\r\nattributed to the “instinct of migration,” and yet that is more a\r\nstatement of fact rather than an explanation of the wonderful ability\r\nof the birds to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does a Captain Steer His Ship Across the Ocean?\r\n\r\n\r\nMan, the most intelligent animal, can also find his way about, but\r\nhe has had to learn to do this step by step. When an explorer first\r\ntravels into the unexplored forest, he carries a compass which tells\r\nhim in what direction he is traveling, but this is not sufficient to\r\ntell him the exact path he came and return the same way. In order that\r\nhe may do this, he must make marks on the trees and other objects\r\nto find his way back. When these marks are once made, other men can\r\nfollow the path by their aid, and eventually a path becomes worn so\r\nthat men can find their way back and forth without the aid of the marks\r\nespecially.\r\n\r\nA trained ship captain can take his ship from any port in the world to\r\nanother port. He can start at New York City and in a given number of\r\ndays, according to how fast his ship can travel, land his passengers\r\nand cargo in the port of London or Johannesburg, South Africa, or at\r\nany desired port in China, Japan or any other country. But he cannot do\r\nthis by any kind of instinct. He takes his directions from information\r\nthat was furnished him by some one who went that way before him--some\r\nother captain of a vessel who made marks in his book of his position\r\nin relation to the sun and stars. This is practically the same as the\r\ntraveler in the forest who made marks on the trees to make a map of the\r\nway back and forth. Even with these charts, compasses and other guiding\r\nmarks, however, man, even though he is the most intelligent of all the\r\nanimals, makes very grave mistakes and sometimes brings disaster upon\r\nhimself and the lives in his care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy the Birds Come Back in Spring?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe birds, however, have no charts or compasses to guide them. We do\r\nnot know as yet absolutely what it is that enables the bird to find its\r\nway back and forth to the same spot year after year. As nearly as we\r\nhave been able to ascertain, the birds after they mate and build their\r\nfirst nest and bring up their first family, develop a fondness for that\r\nparticular spot which is much the same as the instinct in man which we\r\ncall the “homing instinct.” Man becomes attached to one particular spot\r\nwhich he calls home and wherever he is thereafter, he is very likely to\r\nthink of the old locality when he thinks of home, and there are very\r\nfew of us but have yearnings to go back to the old “home locality”\r\nevery now and then. The environment in which a bird or human being is\r\nbrought up generally becomes to a greater or less extent a permanent\r\npart of him in this sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Birds Go South in Winter?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know why birds go south in the winter. The necessity of finding\r\nfood to live upon has everything to do with that. As food grows\r\nscarce towards the end of summer in the farthest northern places where\r\nbirds live, the birds there must find food elsewhere. They naturally\r\nturn south and when they find food, they have to divide with the birds\r\nliving there. The result is that soon the food becomes scarce again\r\nand both the new-comers and the old residents, so to speak, are forced\r\nto seek places where food is plentiful. So both of these flocks, to\r\nuse a short term, fly away to the south until they find food again\r\nand encounter a third flock or group of the bird family crowding the\r\nlocality and exhausting the food supply. So in turn each flock presses\r\nfor food upon the one in the locality next further to the south until\r\nwe have a general movement to the south of practically all the birds\r\nuntil they reach a point where the food supply is sufficient for all\r\nfor the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Don’t the Birds Stay South?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of all this is that the south-land is crowded with birds of\r\nall kinds and the food supply is enough for all. But soon in following\r\nthe laws of nature in birds, as in other living things, comes the time\r\nfor breeding. The south-land is warm enough for nesting and hatching,\r\nbut it is so crowded that there wouldn’t be enough food for all the old\r\nbirds and the little ones too and so the birds begin to scatter again.\r\nJust think of what would happen in the south-land if all the birds that\r\nstay there in the winter built their nests there and brought up a new\r\nfamily. A bird family will average four young birds, so that if all the\r\nbird families were born and raised in the south the bird population\r\nwould quickly multiply itself by three and there would be the same old\r\nnecessity of traveling away to look for food. To avoid this the birds\r\nbegin to scatter to their old homes before the breeding season begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Do They Find the Old Home?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe return of the birds to their old homes and how they find their\r\nway back to the same spot every year, to do which they must sometimes\r\ntravel thousands of miles, is one of the most marvelous things in\r\nnature and has not as yet been satisfactorily determined. The nearest\r\napproach we have to a satisfactory answer to this is that birds do have\r\na memory, that they can and do recognize familiar objects, and that\r\ntheir love for the old home causes them to fly to the north until they\r\nrecognize the landmarks of their former habitation. In this it is said\r\nthat the older birds--those who have gone that way before--lead the\r\nflocks and show the way.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that birds have a more perfect instinct of direction\r\nthan man. They can follow a line of longitude almost perfectly, i.e.,\r\nthey can pick out the shorter route by instinct, and this is, of\r\ncourse, a straight line. They just keep on going until they come to the\r\nfamiliar place they call home and then they stop and build their nests.\r\nThat it is not memory and sight of places alone that guides the birds\r\nis shown by the fact that some birds when migrating fly all night when\r\nthere is no light by which to recognize familiar objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Birds Sing?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song of the birds is a part of the love-making. The male bird is\r\nthe “singer,” as we call them at home, when we think of the canary in\r\nthe cage near us. The male bird sings to his mate to charm her and to\r\nfurther his wooing. This wooing goes on after the eggs have been laid\r\nin the nest and while the mother bird is keeping them warm until they\r\nhatch out, but almost instantaneously with the birth of the little\r\nbirds, the song of the male bird is hushed. Take the case of the\r\nnightingale. For weeks during the period of nest-building and hatching\r\nhe charms his mate and us with the beautiful music of his love song.\r\nBut as soon as the little nightingales come from the eggs, the sounds\r\nwhich the male nightingale makes are changed to a gutteral croak, which\r\nare expressive of anxiety and alarm, in great contrast to the song\r\nnotes of his wooing. And yet, if you were at this period--just after\r\nthe birds are born, and when his song changes--to destroy the nest\r\nand contents, you would at once find Mr. Nightingale return to his\r\nbeautiful song of love to inspire his mate to help him build another\r\nnest and start all over again to raise a family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes an Arrow to Fly?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is caused by the power generated when you bend the bow and string\r\nof the bow and arrow out of shape. The bow and string have the quality\r\nof elasticity which causes a rubber ball to bounce. When you force\r\nanything elastic out of shape, this quality in it makes it try to\r\nget back to its natural shape quickly. In doing this it acts in the\r\ndirection which will take it back to its normal shape most quickly. The\r\narrow is fixed on the string in a way that will not interfere with the\r\nbow and string getting back to its shape and, when they bounce back,\r\nthe arrow goes with it. The real cause for the arrow’s flight, however,\r\ncomes not from the bow, because the bow cannot put itself out of\r\nshape, but comes from the person who causes it to be out of shape and,\r\ntherefore, the person who pulls the string back really causes the arrow\r\nto fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Children Like Candy?\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren crave candy because the sugar which it contains largely is in\r\nsuch a condition that it is the most suited of all our foods for quick\r\nuse by the body. It is actually turned into real energy within a few\r\nminutes after it is eaten.\r\n\r\nAll the things we eat are for the purpose of supplying energy to our\r\nbodies to replace the energy that our daily activities have dissipated.\r\nNature takes the valuable parts of the foods we eat and changes them\r\ninto energy. The waste parts she throws off. Many things we eat have\r\nlittle real value as food and many also nature has to work upon a long\r\ntime before their food value is available in energy. Sugar, however,\r\nrepresents almost energy itself.\r\n\r\nChildren are, of course, more active than grown-ups. They are never\r\nstill. They are, therefore, almost always burning up or using up their\r\nenergy. They are also, therefore, almost always in need of food that\r\ncan be made into energy, and as sugar does this almost more quickly\r\nthan any other food, nature teaches the children to like candy or\r\nsweets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Eating Candy Make Some People Fat?\r\n\r\n\r\nEating as much as one can of anything at any time will produce fat,\r\nprovided you do not do sufficient physical work or take enough exercise\r\nto counteract the effect of generous eating. When you see a person who\r\neats a great deal and is growing fat, you may know that he or she is\r\nnot taking sufficient bodily exercise to work off the energy produced\r\nby the body from the food that has been eaten. When this happens the\r\nenergy in the form of fat piles up in various parts of the system.\r\nCandy will do this more quickly than any other thing we eat because it\r\ncontains so much sugar and because sugar is so easily changed by our\r\nsystem into usable energy. You generally find a fat person who eats\r\nmuch candy to be a lazy person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Snowflakes White?\r\n\r\n\r\nA snowflake is, as you are no doubt aware, made of water affected in\r\nsuch a way by the temperature as to change it into a crystal. Water, of\r\ncourse, as you know, is perfectly transparent. In other words, sunlight\r\nor other light will pass through water without being reflected. A\r\nsingle snow flake also is partially transparent, i.e., the light will\r\ngo through it partially, although some of it will be reflected back.\r\nWhen a drop of water is turned into a snowflake crystal, a great many\r\nreflecting surfaces are produced, and the whiteness of the snowflake is\r\nthe result of practically all of the sunlight which strikes it being\r\nreflected back, just as a mirror reflects practically all the light or\r\ncolor that is thrown against it. If you turn a green light on the snow,\r\nit will reflect the green light in the same way. When the countless\r\nsnow crystals lie on the ground close together, the ability to reflect\r\nthe light is increased and so a mass of snow crystals on the ground\r\nlook even whiter than one single snowflake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes the White Caps on the Waves White?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn telling why the snowflake is white we have practically already\r\nanswered this question also. Instead of little crystals formed from the\r\nwater, the foam produced by the waves of the ocean are tiny bubbles\r\nwhich have the same ability to reflect the light as the snow crystals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Good Can Come of a Toothache?\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few of us realize that an aching tooth is a good thing for us,\r\nprovided we have it attended to and the ache removed. Any one who has\r\nhad toothache will hardly agree that there can be a blessing attached\r\nto this excruciating pain.\r\n\r\nBut the good comes from the warning it gives us of the condition of our\r\nteeth on the inside of our mouths. The arrangement of the interior of\r\nthe mouth and the use we make of it in passing things into our systems,\r\nfavors very much the development and increase of microbes, and when\r\nthey once get in they are difficult to remove. It is said that the\r\ngreatest percentage of cases of stomach trouble come from teeth which\r\nare in bad condition and that a very large percentage of people who\r\nhave bad teeth are in grave danger of blood poisoning or other troubles\r\ndue to the microbes. When these microbes lodge in the mouth, they find\r\nconditions favorable to their development when there are bad teeth, and\r\nspread through the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Can Microbes Spread Through the Body?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various parts of the body, including the gums, are connected by\r\na lymphatic tissue, which is practically a series of canals. If the\r\nteeth are not properly attended to and kept in good condition, both as\r\nto cleanliness and repair, the microbes or germs collect on the gums\r\nand teeth, and increase in numbers. Soon the mouth is over-populated\r\nwith microbes and are pushed off the gums or teeth into the lymphatic\r\ncanals, where they succeed in developing a disease in your body.\r\n\r\nNow the ache in the tooth becomes a blessing very promptly if it\r\nbegins soon after the tooth begins to decay, because in that event the\r\ndentist is visited and the tooth filled or pulled. Therefore, while\r\nit hurts terribly, it might be well to remember that a toothache is a\r\ntimely warning of danger which, if not heeded, will likely develop into\r\nsomething quite serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes Toothache?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ache comes when the tiny nerve at the heart of the tooth is\r\nexposed to the air. When the tooth begins to decay, it starts to do so\r\ngenerally from the outside, and after the decaying process has gone far\r\nenough, it reaches the nerve in the tooth, which aches when exposed to\r\nthe air. The ache is the signal which the nerve sends to the brain that\r\nthere is an exposure and a cry for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf What Use Are Pains and Aches?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll pains and aches are helpful in sounding a warning. A headache may\r\nbe the result of improper sleep and rest and, therefore, warns us to\r\ntake the needed rest or sleep. A pain in the stomach is only nature’s\r\nway of telling us that we have been unwise in our eating and drinking.\r\nAs a matter of fact, short though our lives are, they would probably\r\nbe still shorter, on the average, if it were not for pains and aches,\r\nbecause without these warnings we would never have sense enough to stop\r\ndoing the things we should not do if we lived normally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes Earache?\r\n\r\n\r\nEarache is caused by the nerves in the ear being affected by something\r\neither from within or without which produces a swelling of the parts\r\nimmediately adjacent to the nerves in the ear, and which press against\r\nthe nerves; as the nerves cannot go any place else they send a warning\r\nto the brain that they are being crowded and pressed against. The pain\r\nyou feel is the nerve in the ear warning the brain that something is\r\nwrong in the ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Soap Made Of?\r\n\r\n\r\nSoap is not a very modern product, although we have rarely read of soap\r\nin olden times. As long ago as two thousand years, the Germans had an\r\nointment which was made in practically the same way as we now make\r\nsoap. A soap factory was engaged in making soap in France in 1000 A. D.\r\n\r\nEven before soap was manufactured, people knew that ashes of some\r\nplants, when mixed with water, gave it a peculiar, smooth, slippery\r\nfeeling, and added to the cleansing qualities of water. Although they\r\ndid not know it, this was due to the soda of potash which was in the\r\nashes. Pure soda and potash both have excellent qualities for cleaning,\r\nbut are likely to injure the skin, and other things coming in contact\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nSoap is made by boiling together oil or fat and “caustic” soda or\r\npotash. Caustic soda is a substance made from sodium carbonate by\r\nadding slaked lime to a solution of it. The slaked lime contains\r\ncalcium in combination with hydrogen and oxygen, and is known in\r\nchemistry as calcium hydrate. When calcium hydrate is added to a\r\nsolution of sodium carbonate, the sodium present combines with the\r\noxygen and hydrogen to form a compound, variously called sodium\r\nhydrate, sodium hydroxide, or caustic soda. A similar compound of\r\npotassium is formed when the same kind of lime is mixed in a solution\r\nof potassium carbonate. In both cases the calcium is converted into\r\ncalcium carbonate, which is not soluble in water and settles to the\r\nbottom; but the caustic soda or potash is dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe word “caustic” means to burn. Both will burn the skin if allowed to\r\ntouch the skin for a short time.\r\n\r\nThe fats used for making soap consist of glycerine, in chemical\r\ncombination with what are called fatty acids. When these fats are\r\nboiled with caustic soda, or caustic potash, the fat is decomposed; the\r\nfatty acid combines with the sodium or potassium to form soap and the\r\nglycerine is left uncombined.\r\n\r\nIn modern soap factories the manufacture is carried on in large iron\r\nvessels. Some fat and oil are put into the vessel and a little lye,\r\nwhich is really caustic soda or potash, is added and the mixture\r\nboiled. The fat and the lye combine very quickly and form a whitish\r\nfluid. More lye is now added and the boiling continued. This process\r\nis repeated until nearly all the oil or fat has combined with the lye.\r\nIf yellow laundry soap is being made, some rosin is put in, and this\r\ngives the yellow color. If toilet soap is being made, common salt is\r\nput in instead of rosin. The addition of the salt has the effect of\r\nseparating the water and the glycerine from the soap. The soap rises to\r\nthe surface and is skimmed off. As soon as the separation is complete,\r\nand the soap is then cut or pressed into cakes after it has become hard.\r\n\r\nSoaps referred to above are the ordinary hard soaps. In making soft\r\nsoaps no salt is added to separate the soap from the liquid. As the\r\nwater and glycerine do not separate from the soap, the entire mixture\r\nremains of a soft consistency. Soft soap is also made with a lye, that\r\nis obtained from wood ashes. The ashes are placed in barrels and water\r\npoured upon them. The water drips down through the ashes in the barrel\r\nand dissolves the potash contained in them, making lye or caustic\r\npotash. This lye is then in liquid form and is mixed and boiled with\r\ngrease or fat to make soap.\r\n\r\nThere are many different fats used in soap making. Palm oil is perhaps\r\nthe most common, but tallow, olive oil, cotton seed oil, and many other\r\nfats are used. The hardness of the soap varies with the kind of fat\r\nand lye used. Palm oil or tallow soap is very hard, and other oils are\r\nsometimes mixed with it to soften it.\r\n\r\nThese are the main facts connected with the making of soaps. There may\r\nappear to be different kinds all of which look and smell differently.\r\nThe difference in them is largely due to the presence of different\r\nperfumes and coloring matters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN SENDING MESSAGE WITH SMOKE SIGNALS.\r\n\r\nThe savage Indians found their system of smoke signals quite effective\r\nin sending messages from place to place. With a good burning fire\r\nbefore him, and a blanket or shield at hand, the Indian was equipped\r\nto send his messages. The code consisted of the varying kinds of smoke\r\nclouds produced. These were made large or small by covering the fire\r\nat intervals with the blanket or shield, thus making interruptions of\r\nvarious lengths in the rising clouds of smoke. By dropping moss or\r\nother things into the fire, he made the smoke clouds either light or\r\ndark at will.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Telegram\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Man Learned to Send Messages.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when man had learned to protect himself from the beasts\r\nof the forest, and thus was able to move about more freely, and live by\r\nhimself rather than remain with the tribe, he has found it necessary to\r\nsend messages.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of the early methods for sending messages\r\nwas the Indian way of smoke signalling with the simple equipment of a\r\nfire with its rising column of smoke and a blanket or shield. Messages\r\nwere sent, relayed, received and answered, at points hundreds of miles\r\napart. Among savages still found in remote parts of the earth this and\r\nother primitive methods are still in use. In the wilds of Africa to-day\r\nat points where the electric telegraph service has not yet penetrated,\r\nthe natives by the simple method of beating drums, which can be heard\r\nfrom one relay point to another, are able to send the “news of the day”\r\nacross the country with marvellous rapidity. In some parts of South\r\nAmerica, the natives long ago discovered that the ground is a good\r\nconductor of sound and send their messages almost at will, making their\r\nsignals by tapping against poles which they have planted in the ground\r\nat various points and which constitute both their sending and receiving\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThe Signal Corps in the army uses flags for sending messages, where\r\nthe telegraph is not available, the flags being of different colors,\r\nand the signals are produced by waving the flags in different ways.\r\nThe army heliograph is also used as a telegraph line--a mirror which\r\nreflects the sun’s rays in a manner understood by a prearranged code.\r\nThese and other similar methods are merely elaborations of devices\r\ndeveloped and used by the savages as a solution of the ever present\r\nneed of sending a message to some other point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST MESSENGER BOY\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK RUNNER.\r\n\r\nIn this picture we see the Greek Runner on the last leg of his journey\r\nand the man to whom he is to deliver the message waiting for him. This\r\nmethod of sending messages was not very fast, although the runners were\r\npicked because of their speed and endurance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PONY TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nHere we see the fast riders of the Pony Telegraph, which increased the\r\nspeed of delivering messages quite a good deal, but, of course, there\r\nwas danger of losing the message to enemies or through accident, so\r\nthat it might be difficult under such circumstances to send a secret\r\nmessage or to even be certain that it would arrive at destination.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IT IS EASY TO CALL A TELEGRAPH MESSENGER...\r\n\r\nRINGING THE CALL BOX.]\r\n\r\nThe great Marathon runner was nothing more or less than a telegraph\r\nmessenger hastening with his written message, from the man who\r\ndelivered it to him, to its destination, and his work was harder than\r\nthat of the messenger boy to-day, for he not only had to deliver the\r\nmessage himself to its destination, but had to run fast all the way or\r\nlose his job.\r\n\r\nThe messenger on foot finally gave way to the Pony Telegraph, which not\r\nonly shortened the time necessary to deliver a message, but marked the\r\nbeginning of a system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MESSENGER BOYS WITH BICYCLES WAITING THE CALL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does a Telegram Get There?\r\n\r\nThe next time your daddy takes you down to the office, ask him to show\r\nyou the telegraph call box. When you see it, you will perhaps not think\r\nthat by merely pulling down the little lever you can so start things\r\ngoing that, if you wish, you can cause men who are on the other side\r\nof the earth to work for you in a few minutes, and to make little\r\ninstruments all along the way which, with their other equipment, have\r\ncost millions of dollars, click, click, click at your will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ...BUT MANY TELEGRAPH EMPLOYEES MUST WORK...\r\n\r\nHere we see the messenger calling at the office from which the call box\r\nregistered a call and receiving the telegram to be taken by him to the\r\ncentral office to be put on the wire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: When the messenger gets back to the office, he hands the\r\nmessage to the receiving clerk who stamps it, showing the exact time\r\nreceived and sends it by pneumatic tube to the operating room.]\r\n\r\nSooner or later during the day your father will be wanting to send a\r\ntelegram. He steps to the call box, pulls the little lever and goes\r\nback to his desk. In a few minutes, sometimes before you realize it,\r\nthe little blue-coated messenger appears and says “Call?” Father\r\nhands him a telegraph blank on which he has written the message, the\r\nmessenger takes off his cap, puts the message inside and the cap back\r\non his head and away he goes on his bicycle as fast as his legs can\r\npedal, to the central office, to which point you follow him to see what\r\nhe does with the message.\r\n\r\nIf you had been at the telegraph office instead of your father’s\r\noffice, you would have seen one of these boys start off on his wheel to\r\nget the message your father wished to send. When the little lever on\r\nthe call box is pulled down, it is pulled back by a spring which sets\r\nsome clock work going which sends a signal over the wire on a circuit\r\nwhich runs out from a register at the main office. The register has a\r\npaper tape running through it, and the signal from the call box appears\r\nas a series of dots on the tape. The clerk knows from the number and\r\nspacing of the dots that it was your father that called and not some\r\nother business man whose box might be on the same circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ...BEFORE THE TELEGRAPH SERVICE IS POSSIBLE AND...\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the telegram to the point where it is to start\r\non its real journey. Here we see the operator preparing to send the\r\nmessage. He first must “get the wire.” By this is meant to get a\r\nthrough connection to the town where the message is to be delivered.\r\nEach office along the line has a signal. The other operators can hear\r\nthe call, but since it is not their signal, they pay no attention.\r\nAlmost immediately, however, the operator at the delivery point hears\r\nthe signal. He signals back “I I” and repeats his own office call,\r\nwhich means “I hear you and am ready.” The message is then ticked off,\r\nuntil finished and the operator at the delivery point signals “O. K.,”\r\ntogether with his personal signal, which means he has received the\r\nwhole message and has it down on paper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Here we see the operator at the delivery office. She\r\nhas translated the dots and dashes as they came to her over the wire\r\ninto plain words on a regular telegraph blank, putting down the time\r\nreceived, the amount to be collected, if it is a “collect” message, or\r\nmarking it “Paid” if it was so sent. She has handed it to one of the\r\nblue-clad messengers in her office who starts off at once to deliver\r\nit. The operator has also made a copy of the message for the office\r\nfiles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ...THE TELEGRAM ARRIVES AT DESTINATION\r\n\r\nHere we see the messenger delivering the telegram to the person to\r\nwhom it is addressed. It may be good news or bad news for the person\r\nreceiving it, but it is all in the day’s work for the messenger boy.\r\nBut let us see how many people have to work to deliver the message. We\r\nhave followed it through from the original call box. First there was\r\nthe messenger who came for it, then the receiving clerk, the sending\r\noperator and the operator who receives it and last of all the messenger\r\nboy who delivered it. This does not take into account the men who must\r\nlook after the many miles of wires, the machinery which supplies the\r\ncurrent, or the great army of men who are constantly laying new wires\r\nso that you can send a telegram from almost anywhere to any other\r\nplace.]\r\n\r\nThe operators you have seen working in these pictures are Morse\r\noperators. They send the message by Morse Code in dots and dashes\r\nwhich are sent over the wire as electric impulses. At the other end\r\nthe message is read by listening to the clicks the sounder makes as\r\nit receives these same electric impulses. This is the simplest way of\r\ntelegraphing.\r\n\r\nThe number of messages sent between two big cities in a day is\r\ntremendous--many more than could be transmitted over one Morse wire.\r\nMany wires would be needed. But wire costs money, so ingenious men\r\nset to work to find some way to send more than one message over a\r\nsingle wire at the same time. They succeeded. There is now the duplex\r\ntelegraph, which sends a message each way simultaneously over a single\r\nwire, the quadruplex, which sends two messages each way simultaneously\r\nover a single wire. Last but not least there is the multiplex, which\r\nsends four messages each way simultaneously over a single wire.\r\nThis seems almost unbelievable, but it is done. In the case of the\r\nduplex and quadruplex, the different messages are sent by currents\r\nof different strength, and by changing the direction of the current.\r\nReceiving instruments are designed so as to separate the messages by\r\nbeing affected only by the currents of certain strength or polarity,\r\nas the direction of flow is termed. It can easily be seen that by\r\nthese ingenious devices, the telegraph company saves many thousands\r\nof dollars in the miles and miles of wire, and hundreds of telegraph\r\npoles which would be required if all the messages had to be sent over a\r\nsimple Morse wire, one message only upon the wire at a time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WONDERFUL ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH SYSTEM...\r\n\r\nIn this picture we see the interior of a telegraph office along the\r\nline of a railroad. The operator has her hand on the “key” or sending\r\ninstrument. At her left in a stand called the resonator, is the\r\nreceiving instrument called the “sounder” which clicks off the message.\r\nIn front of her is an instrument called the “relay.” Current from two\r\nof the batteries goes through the key when it is pressed down, through\r\nthe relay and out on to the wires of the pole line, then through the\r\nrelay of the receiving operator at the other end, (see picture on\r\nopposite page) through his key and through two more batteries to the\r\nground. The earth forms the return wire of an electric circuit when\r\nboth keys are “closed” or pressed down. You know all electricity has to\r\nflow in a closed circuit. The “sounder” has to make good strong clicks\r\nto be understood, and the current after it has gone through miles of\r\nwire and ground may not be strong enough so the sounder is put on a\r\nlocal circuit of its own, with a special battery. In this circuit is a\r\ncontact maker which is part of the relay. When the key is pressed down\r\nand current flows over the wires on the poles and through the relays,\r\nthe magnets of the relay pull on a little piece of metal called the\r\n“armature,” which makes a contact and closes the local sounder circuit,\r\nso current from the single local battery can flow up through the\r\nmagnets of the sounder and back to the battery. This makes the sounder\r\nclick. When the key is released, the relay armature is pulled back by\r\na spring and breaks the circuit of sounder, which then emits another\r\nclick. By the number and duration of the clicks and the time between\r\nthem, the receiving operator knows the meaning of the signal. The Morse\r\nCode, which is used throughout the United States, is shown on next\r\npage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ...SENDS MESSAGES THOUSANDS OF MILES INSTANTANEOUSLY\r\n\r\n  MORSE TELEGRAPH CODE\r\n\r\n  Letters  Morse\r\n  A        · --\r\n  B        -- · · ·\r\n  C        · ·  ·\r\n  D        -- · ·\r\n  E        ·\r\n  F        · -- ·\r\n  G        -- -- ·\r\n  H        · · · ·\r\n  I        · ·\r\n  J        -- · -- ·\r\n  K        -- · --\r\n  L        ----\r\n  M        -- --\r\n  N        -- ·\r\n  O        ·  ·\r\n  P        · · · · ·\r\n  Q        · · -- ·\r\n  R        ·  · ·\r\n  S        · · ·\r\n  T        --\r\n  U        · · --\r\n  V        · · · --\r\n  W        · -- --\r\n  X        · -- · ·\r\n  Y        · ·  · ·\r\n  Z        · · ·  ·\r\n  &        ·  · · ·\r\n\r\n  Numerals\r\n\r\n  Figures  Morse\r\n  1        · -- -- ·\r\n  2        · · -- · ·\r\n  3        · · · -- ·\r\n  4        · · · · --\r\n  5        -- -- --\r\n  6        · · · · · ·\r\n  7        -- -- ·\r\n  8        -- · · · ·\r\n  9        -- · · --\r\n  0        ----\r\n\r\n  Punctuations\r\n\r\n  .

It has been\r\ndeveloped by the engineers of the Western Union Telegraph Co. working\r\nwith the engineers of the Western Electric Company. The principle\r\non which this instrument works is that if separate instruments are\r\ngiven connection with the wire one after the other during very short\r\nintervals of time, the effect is as though the wire were split up, and\r\neach instrument works just as if it alone were on the wire. Not only\r\ndoes the multiplex telegraph thus send four messages in one direction\r\nand four messages in the opposite direction, simultaneously over a\r\nsingle wire, thus keeping no less than sixteen operators employed on\r\none wire, four sending and four receiving at each end, but each message\r\ninstead of being sent by the ordinary Morse key, is written upon a\r\ntypewriter keyboard at one end of the line and appears automatically\r\ntypewritten at the other end.\r\n\r\nIf you live in a big city, go into one of the larger branch offices\r\nof the Western Union Telegraph Co. and ask to see printing telegraph.\r\nMost of the large branch offices communicate with the general operating\r\ndepartment in the city by means of what they term “short line\r\nprinters,” which are instruments on which the message is written upon a\r\ntypewriter keyboard and appears typewritten at the other end.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Invented the Electric Telegraph?\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say just how the telegraph originated in the mind of men.\r\nWe have already shown how the savages sent signals over distances by\r\nmeans of the smoke rising from his fire. Every boy and girl has used a\r\nlittle mirror, held in the sun to flash a bright spot here and there.\r\nThis principle has been used by the army to signal at distances. The\r\nsun’s rays are flashed from a small mirror, long and short flashes\r\nindicating the dashes and dots of the Morse telegraph code.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFESSOR S. F. B. MORSE, INVENTOR OF THE TELEGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nProgress towards the perfection of the electric telegraph began with\r\nthe first researches of scientists into the natural laws which govern\r\nthat great natural agent, electricity. Clever, painstaking men,\r\nstudying and experimenting for the love of the work, discovered bit\r\nby bit how to control the force. Stephen Gray with his Leyden jars,\r\nwhich stored up a charge of electricity, inspired Sir William Watson to\r\nexperiment, and he sent current from one jar to another two miles away.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Suggestion of the Electric Telegraph.\r\n\r\nFor a long time no one thought that this opened the way for the making\r\nof a useful servant for man. In 1753 this thought occurred to an\r\nunknown man in Scotland, who wrote a letter to a newspaper suggesting\r\nthat messages be sent by electric currents.\r\n\r\nOne of his schemes was that there should be a light ball at the\r\nreceiving end of the wire which would strike a bell when it felt\r\nthe electric impulse come over the wire from the Leyden jar, and by\r\ndevising a code depending upon the number of strokes of the bell and\r\nthe time between them, he suggested that messages could be sent and\r\ninterpreted. Some believe this man to have been a doctor named Charles\r\nMorrison of Greenock, Scotland. Whoever he was, he suggested a method\r\nwhich comes very near to being that in use to-day.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with proceeding on this suggestion was that the current\r\nfrom the Leyden jar was static electricity, which has not the strength\r\nnor can it be controlled as can the current of low potential which\r\nis used to-day. Volta discovered this new and more stable form of\r\nelectricity and many different men labored investigating what could\r\nbe accomplished with it. The names of Sir Humphry Davy and Michael\r\nFaraday are inseparably connected with this advance. It was Oersted’s\r\nand Faraday’s discovery of the connection between electricity and\r\nmagnetism, and how an electric current may be made to magnetize a piece\r\nof iron at will, that really opened the way for the invention of the\r\ntelegraph we know to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Real Telegraph.\r\n\r\nBut before the much greater practical value of Volta’s current was\r\ndiscovered, one man developed a real telegraph which worked with\r\nelectricity of the static kind, produced by friction. This man was\r\nnamed Sir Francis Ronalds. He worked along the lines laid down by the\r\nunknown Scotchman, whom we have supposed to be Charles Morrison. The\r\nmachine he built and operated in his garden at Hammersmith utilized\r\npith balls, which actuated by the charge of static electricity sent\r\nalong the wire caused a letter to appear before an opening in the dial.\r\nWhen perfected he offered it to the British Government, who refused\r\nit. They were very stupid in their refusal, for they said “telegraphs\r\nare wholly unnecessary.” Sir Francis Ronalds’ invention cost him much\r\ncare, anxiety and money. He lived to see the more practical voltaic\r\ncurrent taken up by others and put to successful use. Being unselfish\r\nhe rejoiced that others should succeed where he had failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Men who Invented our Telegraph almost Simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph, working on the electro-magnetic principle, as used\r\nto-day, was developed almost simultaneously on the two sides of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean. In England Sir Charles Wheatstone and Sir William\r\nFothergill Cooke worked out a practical method and instruments, which\r\nwith few changes, are in use to-day. Cooke was a doctor and had\r\nserved with the British army in India. Wheatstone was the son of a\r\nGloucester musical instrument maker. The latter was fond of science and\r\nexperimented continually with electricity and wrote about it and other\r\nscientific subjects. As a result of his work he was made a professor\r\nat King’s College. There he conducted important researches and tests,\r\namong which was one which measured the speed at which electricity\r\ntravels along a wire. So Cooke, who was a doctor and a good business\r\nman, entered into partnership with the scientist Wheatstone, and\r\ntogether they completed their invention. It was first used in 1838\r\non the London and Blackwall Railway. At first it was expensive and\r\ncumbersome, using five lines of wire. Later this number was reduced\r\nto two, and in 1845, an instrument was devised which required but one\r\nwire. This instrument, with a few minor changes, is the one in use\r\nto-day in England.\r\n\r\nWhile these two men were working in England, an American artist, S. F.\r\nB. Morse, was studying and experimenting in the United States along his\r\nown lines but with the same end in view, namely to produce instruments\r\nwhich would satisfactorily send messages over a wire by electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn American, however, is given the honor of First by Slight Margin.\r\n\r\nMorse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1791. He was gifted as\r\nan artist, both in painting and sculpture, and in 1811 went abroad to\r\nEngland to study. While on a voyage from Havre to America in 1832 he\r\nmet on board ship a Dr. Jackson, who told him of the latest scientific\r\ndiscoveries in regard to the electric current and the electro-magnet.\r\nThis set Morse to thinking and after three years’ hard work on the\r\nproblem he produced a telegraph which worked on the principle of the\r\nelectro-magnet. With the apparatus devised by Morse and his partner\r\nAlfred Vail, a message was sent from Washington to Baltimore in 1844.\r\n\r\nThere has been some question as to whether Morse or Wheatstone first\r\ninvented a workable telegraph. As will be evident from this history,\r\nthe telegraph in principle was a gradual development, to which many\r\nminds contributed. To Morse, however, the high authority of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States has given the credit of being\r\nthe first to perfect a practical instrument, saying that the Morse\r\ninvention “preceded the three European inventions” and that it would\r\nbe impossible to examine the latter without perceiving at once “the\r\ndecided superiority of the one invented by Professor Morse.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Sam Helped Build the First Telegraph Line.\r\n\r\n~FIRST TELEGRAPH LINE FROM BALTIMORE TO WASHINGTON~\r\n\r\nAt the time Morse’s Recording Telegraph was invented there were, of\r\ncourse, no telegraph lines in any part of the world, with the exception\r\nof the short lines of wire put up by investigators for experimental\r\npurposes. To remove the obscurity as to the purpose to be served by the\r\ntelegraph was the first problem which presented itself to Morse and his\r\nbackers. In 1843 an appropriation was secured of $30,000 from the U. S.\r\nGovernment, with which a line was built from Washington to Baltimore.\r\nThis was built and operated by the Government for about two years, but\r\nthe Government refused to purchase the patent rights. So the owners\r\nof the patents endeavored to get the general public interested in the\r\ntelegraph as a commercial undertaking and gradually companies were\r\nfounded and licensed to use the invention.\r\n\r\nBy 1851 there were as many as fifty different telegraph companies in\r\noperation in different parts of the United States. A few of these\r\nused the devices of a man named Alexander Bain, which were afterwards\r\nadjudged to infringe the Morse patents, and one or two used an\r\ninstrument invented by Royal E. House of Vermont, which printed the\r\nmessages received in plain Roman letters on a ribbon of paper. This at\r\nfirst seemed to have an advantage over that of Morse, which received\r\nthe message in dots and dashes, in the Morse Code, and these had\r\nto be translated and written out by an operator before they could\r\nbe delivered. However, as time went on, the operators came to read\r\nthe Morse messages by the sound of the dots and dashes, instead of\r\nwaiting to read the paper tape having the dots and dashes marked on\r\nit, and finally the recording feature was given up and the sounder, or\r\ninstrument which simply clicks out the message, came into general use.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, the possibility of the business were little\r\nunderstood and many telegraph companies failed. April 8, 1851,\r\npapers were filed in Albany for the incorporation of the New York\r\nand Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Co. This company, which\r\nsoon afterwards changed its name to Western Union, was destined to\r\nabsorb the various companies throughout the country until it, in time,\r\noperated the telegraph lines over practically the entire United States,\r\nand has its blue sign in nearly every town and hamlet in the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO-DAY\r\n\r\nOPERATING ROOM.\r\n\r\nIn large cities like New York and Chicago, the operating rooms are very\r\nlarge. For instance, the main operating department of the Western Union\r\nTelegraph Co. in New York City has 1000 operators. This picture shows\r\nan operating room. The men and women sit in opposite sides of long\r\ntables. On the tables are the keys and sounders by which they send and\r\nreceive the messages. Each operator has a typewriter, or “mill,” as he\r\ncalls it, on which he writes off the message as it comes to him over\r\nthe wire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN SWITCHBOARD.\r\n\r\nThe picture shows a main switchboard in a large operating room. To this\r\ncome the ends of the wires from other cities, and to it are connected\r\nthe wires from the instruments in front of the operators. By putting\r\nplugs, attached to each end of a wire, into the sockets in the board,\r\nany wire can be connected with any operating position, or several local\r\ncircuits can be connected up with a main line from the outside.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A THOROUGH SYSTEM MUST HANDLE THE MESSAGES\r\n\r\nA SECTION OF THE REPEATER ROOM.\r\n\r\nWhen a wire runs to a distant point from the main operating department\r\nof the telegraph company in a large city, the same electric current\r\nwhich runs through the key of the operator as he sits at his place,\r\nbusily sending messages, does not go out over the wire to that distant\r\npoint. It simply goes to the repeater room and operates a repeater,\r\nwhich sends out another current over the long wire which leads to the\r\ndestination of the message. This is necessary because the condition\r\nof the weather affects the lines and the current strength has to be\r\nchanged to suit the changing line conditions. The operators haven’t\r\ntime to make these adjustments, and so all the repeaters are grouped\r\ntogether in the repeater room where they are under the watchful eyes\r\nof experts. Here also are the delicate instruments which separate the\r\nmessages coming over duplex and quadruplex wires, by responding to\r\nimpulses of various strengths. These messages which have been separated\r\nare then transmitted by the duplex or quadruplex repeaters to different\r\noperators in the operating room, who hear their sounders tick out the\r\nmessage just the same as if it came over a simple Morse wire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CABLES ENTERING A CENTRAL OFFICE.\r\n\r\nYou may not but your father will remember the time when in large cities\r\nthere were tall telegraph poles with hundreds of wires on them running\r\nalong the main streets, so that the town seemed to be bound with great\r\nspiders’ web. That is all changed now, and the telegraph wires are run\r\nthrough ducts, placed underground. For this purpose they are made up\r\nin cables, and in the picture you see a number of cables entering a\r\ncentral office.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARVEL OF TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nWHEATSTONE SENDING INSTRUMENT.\r\n\r\nThese two photographs show the most modern form of the instruments\r\nwhich, as we are told on another page, were invented in England by\r\nWheatstone and Cooke. In sending a paper tape is punched in what\r\nis called a perforator, which has a keyboard like a typewriter. A\r\ncertain combination of holes means a certain letter. This tape is then\r\nautomatically fed through the sending instrument, which sends impulses\r\nover the wire. The tape with the holes punched through it can be seen\r\nin the picture.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the Wheatstone receiving instrument. It prints the\r\nsignals received in dots and dashes on a tape, which is translated by\r\nthe operator who typewrites the translation on a message blank for\r\ndelivery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The automatic telegraph typewriter shown here is one of\r\nthe wonderful instruments mentioned on one of the preceding pages. The\r\noperator at the other end of the line writes on a typewriter keyboard,\r\non the sending instrument. The electric impulses are received by the\r\nmachine shown above, which automatically typewrites the message on a\r\nblank, ready for delivery.]\r\n\r\nOn this page we see some of the first telegraph instruments, in\r\nfact, the very instruments which Professor Morse used in the early\r\ndemonstrations of his invention. These instruments may be seen in the\r\nSmithsonian Institution at Washington, D. C. The key is known as the\r\nVail key, because it is supposed to have been constructed by Alfred\r\nVail, who worked with Morse in his experiments with the telegraph. As\r\ncan be seen it is very simple. One wire was connected to the spring\r\npiece and the other to the post beneath it. When the key was pressed\r\ndown, the contact was made and an impulse sent over the wire, either a\r\ndot, if the key was pressed down and immediately released, or a dash if\r\nit were held down for just the fraction of a second before releasing.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first it was found that relays were necessary, because\r\nthe current after coming a long way over the wire often was not\r\nstrong enough to operate the recording instrument. Therefore, this\r\nweak current was made to go though the electro-magnets of the relay,\r\nmagnetizing these and pulling to the left the upright arm which can be\r\nseen in the photograph with a little block of iron attached to it. This\r\narm, when pulled by the magnets, made a contact at the top and allowed\r\na strong current from a battery to flow through the magnets of the\r\nrecording instrument.\r\n\r\nThe first practical recording telegraph instrument devised by Morse\r\nis shown. It looks like a clumsy affair compared to the instruments\r\nof to-day, but it worked so effectively as to convince people of the\r\npossibilities of the great invention. In the wooden box, attached to\r\nthe frame at the right, is clockwork which pulled a paper tape at an\r\neven rate of speed over a pulley just beneath a needle point. This\r\nneedle point is attached to a light framework having a piece of iron\r\nfastened in it. Below this iron are the electro-magnets, and when they\r\nreceived an impulse of current from the battery, through the relay,\r\nthey pulled down the frame so that the point made a mark upon the paper\r\ntape which moved under it. Thus in the tape appeared a series of dots\r\nand dashes, which the operator, knowing the Morse Code, could easily\r\ntranslate into English.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nONE OF THE FIRST KEYS FOR SENDING TELEGRAMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE FIRST RELAYS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The first recording apparatus. The box on the right\r\ncontains clock work for pulling a paper tape beneath a sharp point\r\nactuated by magnets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE INSTRUMENTS THAT CHECK OFF THE WORDS\r\n\r\nA LATER KEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LATER AND IMPROVED RECORDING INSTRUMENT.\r\n\r\nHere we see some early telegraph instruments which have been improved\r\nsomewhat from the crude devices illustrated on the preceding page.\r\nThe key answers the same purpose as before, but has been improved by\r\npivoting the lever arm, and having a coil spring, adjustable by means\r\nof a screw, so that the weight necessary to press it down can be varied\r\nto suit the likings of the operator who uses it. The play of the key\r\nor the distance it must be pressed down before it makes an electric\r\ncontact, can be adjusted by another screw.\r\n\r\nThe recording instrument here shown is a much neater affair than the\r\ncumbersome device which Professor Morse first built. The cumbersome\r\nwooden box has been replaced with a neat brass frame containing the\r\nclockwork for drawing the paper tape beneath the marking point, which\r\nis attached to a piece of iron, or armature, placed just above the\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\nBelow we see the most modern types of Morse instruments. In the center\r\nis the key, which is not much changed except that it is built to be\r\nlow down to a table, so that the operator may rest his forearm on the\r\ntable top in front of it, and operate the key with his wrist, with less\r\nfatigue. The relay at the left is interesting. It shows how little this\r\ninstrument has changed, except for refinement in its appearance, from\r\nthe first relay built by Professor Morse. At the right is the Morse\r\nsounder, which has replaced the old Morse tape recording instrument.\r\nWhen current goes through the magnets they attract a piece of iron\r\nattached to the metal arm and pull it down to strike the brass frame.\r\nThis makes a click, and when the current is intercepted, the magnets\r\nrelease the arm and a spring pulls it back, making another click.

Full size. Core 130/130.\r\n\r\nThis picture shows cross-sections of a cable which runs from Vancouver,\r\nB. C., to Australia and New Zealand. A cable is not laid with a\r\nuniform cross-section. On the floor of the ocean, perhaps miles below\r\nthe surface, the cable rests quietly and is not moved by storms\r\nwhich generate great waves on the surface of the water. As the cable\r\napproaches the shore, the movement of the water goes deeper and the\r\ncable must be made heavier to prevent it from being worn by movement on\r\nthe bed of the ocean. Where the cable passes over a rocky bottom, it is\r\nmade much larger in diameter and is heavily armored.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Here is the cable steamship “Colonia” laying the shore\r\nend of a cable. Note the row of floats upon the water which carry the\r\ncable until the end in the cable office is firmly fastened. When this\r\nis accomplished the floats are removed and the cable sinks to the\r\nbottom.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in an Ocean Cable\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a Cable Made of?\r\n\r\nA submarine telegraph cable as usually made consists of a core in the\r\ncenter of which is a strand of copper wire which varies in weight from\r\nseventy to four hundred pounds to the mile. Strands of copper wire\r\ninstead of one thick wire of copper are used, because the former is\r\nmore flexible. The copper conductor is covered with several coatings of\r\nrubber of equal weight to the copper wires. After this comes a coating\r\nof jute serving, then a layer of galvanized iron wires and finally a\r\nlayer of yarn and compound which forms the outer covering of the cable.\r\nIn addition to this where the cable lays among rocks that might injure\r\nit, chains are securely wrapped around it, so as to prevent wear and\r\ntear as much as possible.\r\n\r\nYou may not have known it, but the cable which lies on the bottom\r\nwhere the water is deepest is never so large as nearer the shore or\r\nin shallow water. Little by little the men who lay and look after\r\ncables have found that it is best to have a specially constructed outer\r\ncovering for different depths and character of bottoms so as to provide\r\nthe least possible danger of damage through the action of the water on\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is a Cable Laid?\r\n\r\nWhen the cable of sufficient length is completed, it is carried to\r\na specially equipped vessel which has a great tank for holding the\r\ncable and the necessary machinery for lowering it over the end of the\r\nship into the water. The cable is carefully coiled in the tank, the\r\ndifferent coils being prevented from adhering by a coat of whitewash.\r\nFirst then, a sufficient length of cable is paid out to reach the cable\r\nhouse or shore. Here it is finally tested to see that the entire length\r\nof cable is in working order. If satisfactorily tested, the vessel\r\nsteams slowly away on the course outlined, paying out the cable as she\r\ngoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STORING A CABLE LONG ENOUGH TO CROSS THE OCEAN\r\n\r\nHere we see a cable coiled round and round in the tank which holds it\r\non board the cable ship.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the front of the picture we see the cable coming from\r\nthe tank in which it is coiled. It goes over the drum of the paying-out\r\nmachine and thence to the bow of the ship, where it passes over big\r\nsheaves or pulleys and down into the ocean.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MACHINERY ON A CABLE SHIP\r\n\r\nThe paying-out machine. The cable makes a couple of turns around the\r\nbig drum, which is connected to the dial, so that the dial indicates\r\nthe length of cable which has been paid out into the sea.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The upper forward deck of the cable steamship\r\n“Telconia,” showing the gear which is used in paying out the cable.\r\nAway in the bow are the big sheaves over which the cable goes into the\r\nsea. Nearer is a dynamometer which measures the tension on the cable.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE CABLE IS DROPPED INTO THE OCEAN\r\n\r\nHere we see the cable on the lead, as it is called, passing over the\r\nbig bow sheave from which it dives into the depths of the sea.]\r\n\r\nThe vessel must pay out more than a mile of cable for every mile she\r\ntravels because there must be enough slack allowed at the same time\r\nto provide for the unevenness of the bottom of the sea. For this\r\npurpose the amount of cable paid out must be measured. This is done\r\nby the paying-out machine, which is shown in one of the pictures.\r\nThe difference between the speed of the ship and the amount of cable\r\npaid out gives the amount of slack. Too much slack would also be bad,\r\nso that it is a very pretty problem to pay out just enough and both\r\nthe speed of the vessel and the rate of paying out the cable must be\r\nwatched carefully.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest wonders accomplished by the ingenuity of man is the\r\nocean telegraph, by which we flash messages back and forth under the\r\nsea between the continents and completely around the world.\r\n\r\nHardly had the telegraph become an established fact, before Professor\r\nMorse, who made the telegraph practical, expressed the belief that a\r\ntelegraph line to Europe by means of a wire laid on the bottom of the\r\nocean was easily possible at some future time. Mr. Cyrus W. Field, the\r\nfirst to lay an ocean cable successfully, heard him and in his own\r\nmind said “Why not now?” The idea fixed itself so thoroughly in his\r\nresolute mind that he soon said to himself “It shall be done,” and\r\nwent to work, and labored incessantly through twelve years of failure\r\nand discouragement before he accomplished his task, which was a great\r\ncompliment to this giant of American stick-to-it-iveness.\r\n\r\nWhile many doubted the feasibility of the project and others thought\r\nit the dream of a disordered brain, Mr. Field found many who believed\r\nin him and his idea and who loaned him their financial support for the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CABLE ARRIVES ON THE OTHER SIDE\r\n\r\nLanding the shore end of a cable. The cable is supported on several\r\nboats and this picture shows the inshore boat with the end of the cable\r\nreaching the beach with the seas breaking over her.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MEN WHO MADE THE OCEAN CABLE POSSIBLE\r\n\r\nTHE PIONEERS OF THE FIRST OCEAN CABLE.]\r\n\r\nAmerican genius had not at that time asserted its supremacy in\r\nmechanics and so the first cable had to be made in England; so Mr.\r\nField ordered one long enough to stretch from the west coast of Ireland\r\nto the eastern point of Newfoundland. English capitalists subscribed\r\nthe money and the United States provided the vessel in which to store\r\nand from which to drop the cable into the ocean.\r\n\r\nUpon the first attempt to lay the cable, every thing went along nicely\r\nfor six days, and then suddenly the cable broke when three hundred and\r\nthirty-five miles had been laid, and many said it could not be done.\r\nMr. Field, however, full of American pluck and determination, said “We\r\nwill try again.” A second attempt was made with two ships, the U. S. S.\r\n“Niagara” and H. M. S. S. “Agamemnon.” Each ship carried half the cable\r\nand they traveled in company to the middle of the ocean. There the two\r\npieces of the cable were spliced together and the ships started for the\r\nshores in opposite directions. Again, however, when only a little of\r\nthe cable had been paid out--a little more than one hundred miles in\r\nfact--the cable broke and both ships were forced to return to England.\r\n\r\nIn his third attempt the cable was finally laid clear across the\r\nocean and fastened at both ends. When tried it was found to work\r\nsuccessfully and Queen Victoria and President Buchanan were able to\r\nexchange greetings upon the achievement of a wonderful work. The people\r\ncelebrated the event on both sides of the ocean, but in the midst of\r\nthe festivities, while a message was being flashed, something happened\r\nto the cable--what, we have never been able to learn--and the cable was\r\nsilent, forever.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, however, Mr. Field by his great courage induced his\r\nbackers to buy him another cable and the “Great Eastern” sailed upon\r\nwhat was to be a most successful mission. Starting from the American\r\nside with the greatest steamship then known in charge of the previous\r\ncable, the other end was successfully landed at Hearts Content,\r\nIreland, on July 27, 1866, in perfect working order, and the question\r\nof the ocean telegraph was solved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW CABLES ARE REPAIRED\r\n\r\nHere is a buoy which is anchored to the cable.

The signals are readily reducible again\r\nif necessary to the dots and dashes of the Morse code because dots make\r\ndeflections to one side of the center of the tape and dashes to the\r\nother.

We are accustomed to see the levers\r\nand other machinery for operating the engine right in the back of the\r\nengine cab. Over or near the firebox. Upon looking closely we find\r\nthat the operating machinery is at the side of the locomotive and\r\nfar forward in the cab. In fact there is a complete set of operating\r\nmachinery on both sides of the cab, so that the engineer can run the\r\nengine from whatever side he happens to be on. This is very necessary,\r\nparticularly in switching. Near the end of the cab where the engineer\r\nused to sit you will notice a peculiar pipe-like arrangement. This\r\nis not for operating the engine, but is the automatic stoker, which\r\nis fully explained in the next picture. An engine of this size will\r\nrequire seven tons of coal per hour.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MACHINE WHICH DOES THE WORK OF FOUR FIREMEN\r\n\r\nWhen these large locomotives were first used it was found that no one\r\nfireman could shovel in enough coal to keep the steam up. It would\r\nrequire three or four firemen working constantly to shovel enough coal\r\nto keep this engine going. Man’s inventive genius came to the front,\r\nhowever, and now we have an automatic fireman, so to speak. Instead of\r\nshoveling coal on one of these engines the fireman merely operates a\r\nlever. This is a picture of the Sweet locomotive stoker installed in\r\na railroad engine. This machine automatically conveys coal from the\r\ntender to the locomotive, raises it by an elevator to a point above the\r\nfire door, dumps it into the firebox and spreads it evenly over the\r\ngrate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is the new type of electric locomotive being used\r\nby the New York Central system]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW A FAST TRAIN TAKES WATER WITHOUT STOPPING\r\n\r\nThe fast express trains haven’t time to stop and take water from the\r\ntank at the side of the railroad as in former days. This picture shows\r\na tank built between the tracks which enables the engineer to fill\r\nhis boilers without slackening speed. When approaching this tank the\r\nengineer simply lowers a tube into the water, the end of which is a\r\nscoop. The moving engine thus forces the water up into the tube, from\r\nwhich it runs into the boiler.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is an improved signal tower from which switches are\r\noperated. If you were ever in a signal tower you will not recognize\r\nthis as one, for you are used to seeing a room full of levers which the\r\ntower man had to pull hard when he wished to throw a switch. By the old\r\nway the end of the lever was attached to a wire which was connected\r\nwith the switch. The wire running through pipes, when the operator\r\npulled the lever the switch was pulled shut by the pull on the wire. In\r\nthis new plan the switch is controlled by electricity, and the operator\r\nhas merely to pull out a plug as shown in the picture, which is much\r\neasier than operating a lever.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT MAKES A WIRELESS MESSAGE GO\r\n\r\nSketch showing arrangement of aerial on ship equipped with the Marconi\r\nDirection Finder, an instrument which tells the sea captain the exact\r\npoints of the compass from which wireless distress signals are being\r\nsent and enables ships to avoid collisions in fog.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in the Wireless\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Principle of the Wireless Telegraphy?\r\n\r\nDrop a stone in a pool of water. Circular waves or ripples will travel\r\noutward in all directions. That is the principle of wireless telegraph.\r\n\r\nIf a chip be floating on the water it will be rocked by each ripple,\r\njust as a wireless receiving station will respond to the electrical\r\nwaves or impulses that make up a wireless message. It is not known\r\njust how the invisible wireless waves are propelled through space,\r\nbut they travel through the ether in the air in very much the same\r\nway as do sound waves. The electrical signals, too, are received only\r\nby apparatus that is attuned to them; that is, they can not be heard\r\nexcept at wireless stations, any more than sound can be heard by the\r\nears of a deaf person.\r\n\r\nThe wireless waves have a definite length, can be measured in feet or\r\nmeters, and are regulated according to the distance the message is to\r\ntravel. Stations that send a few hundred miles use a wave length of six\r\nhundred meters, or less, while at the powerful land stations used for\r\ntrans-atlantic work the wave lengths used run into as many thousands.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Don’t the Messages Go to the Wrong Stations?\r\n\r\nSo that the hundreds of messages hurtling through space at the same\r\ntime will not interfere, the wireless stations are equipped with\r\ntuning-apparatus through which they can adjust their wave length to\r\nreceive the particular message desired. A different wave length is\r\nused by each ship or wireless shore station, and even though dozens of\r\nmessages fill the air, the minute the wireless operator adjusts his\r\ntuner to the length of the station he is after, that particular message\r\nstands out very strongly and all the others grow dim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Marconi Wireless station at Miami, Fla., which is\r\ntypical of the shore stations that handle messages to several thousand\r\nships at sea.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does the Wireless Reach Ships at Sea?\r\n\r\nAll ships at sea report their positions regularly; thus it is a simple\r\nmatter for a shore station to send a wireless message to the ship to\r\nwhich it is addressed. For example, the Marconi station at Sea Gate,\r\nNew York, wants to reach the Lusitania. The operator looks up that\r\nvessel on the list and notes her call signal and wave length. He\r\nadjusts his tuner to correspond and calls her signal, M F A, repeating\r\nit three times.\r\n\r\nThe wireless man on the vessel, knowing that he is within range of a\r\nshore station, has set his tuner at the wave length assigned to him and\r\nis listening. When his call letters are heard, he acknowledges them\r\nand signals to go ahead with the message. When it has been given, the\r\nSea Gate station “signs off” with its call letters W S E and the ship\r\noperator enters in his record that that particular message reached him\r\nvia the Marconi station at Sea Gate. Thus, with the wide variety in\r\nwave lengths, no confusion of messages exists and any desired ship or\r\nshore station can be called, just as a direct telephone connection is\r\nsecured by giving the central station the call number of the subscriber\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Kind of Signs Are Used in the Wireless?\r\n\r\nThe actual wireless message is composed of dots and dashes, which, in\r\ncertain combinations, stand for certain letters of the alphabet. This\r\nis done through opening and closing the electrical circuit by pressing\r\na key, a sharp touch forming a dot and a longer pressure a dash, as\r\nwith the wire telegraph.\r\n\r\nIf secrecy in a wireless message is wanted, the words are sent in\r\ncipher which, of course, cannot be understood by outsiders. The\r\nGovernment sends thousands of words each day without a single word\r\nmeaning anything to the wireless stations that happen to be “listening\r\nin.” While it is true that any one owning a wireless receiving set may\r\nlisten to messages flying through the air, every person within hearing\r\nwho understands the Morse Code can read the telegrams that come into a\r\ntelegraph office. Knowledge thus gained, however, is of little value,\r\nas the law provided heavy penalties for disclosing the contents of any\r\nkind of telegraph message.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Does a Wireless Equipment Consist of?\r\n\r\nThe various apparatus that comprises a wireless equipment can not be\r\nproperly explained without the use of technical language, but the\r\ngeneral principle of operation is somewhat as follows: If a small loop\r\nof copper wire, with a slight separation between the ends, is placed\r\nacross a room from an electric spark, it will be slightly affected.\r\nIncrease the electrical current to far greater power and control it,\r\nand the invisible electrical wave may be thrown many miles. To send\r\na message across the ocean, the current used by the modern wireless\r\nstation is so powerful that it will pass through storm and fog,\r\neven through mountains, without losing much of its force. When this\r\ntremendous force is released by pressing the telegraph key, it leaps\r\nfrom the aerial wires, or antennae, travels across the Atlantic and is\r\npicked up by a corresponding aerial, attuned to receive the signal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pack and riding horses grouped together ready for\r\nunloading the Marconi wireless set used in the cavalry.\r\n\r\nStation set up and working.\r\n\r\nWORKING THE WIRELESS IN THE ARMY.]\r\n\r\nThe aerial, or antennae, as it is called in a wireless work, is made up\r\nof copper wires. On a ship these are strung between the masts, usually\r\nconsisting of two, four or six wires held apart by crosspieces. Two or\r\nmore wires lead down from this to the wireless cabin.\r\n\r\nThe coil or transformer is the apparatus which produces the spark that\r\nforms the electrical waves. In small stations, the length and thickness\r\nof the spark and the speed of vibration is regulated by a thumb screw.\r\nTransformers are used when the power is taken from the alternating\r\ncurrent of an electric light circuit.\r\n\r\nThe gap, which the electrical current jumps when the telegraph key is\r\npressed down, is composed of two rods which slide together or apart to\r\nvary the length of the spark.\r\n\r\nThe simplest type of sending station consists of the antenna, battery,\r\ncoil, wireless key and spark gap. If a change in wave length is desired\r\na transmitting tuning coil must be added.\r\n\r\nThe receiving apparatus contains a detector, which is chiefly two\r\nmineral points lightly touching and connected with a sensitive head\r\ntelephone. The incoming signals are heard as long and short buzzing\r\nsounds corresponding to the dots and dashes. The receiving tuning coil,\r\nused to adjust wave lengths, is operated by simply moving sliding\r\ncontacts along a bar until the signals are more plainly heard. While\r\nthe large stations have more complicated apparatus, the principle\r\nremains the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The masts for the cavalry wireless sets are so attached\r\nthat they can be loaded and unloaded with the utmost rapidity; a\r\ncomplete station can be erected or dismantled in less than ten minutes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The gasoline engine which supplies the power for\r\noperating a cavalry wireless station is fitted to the saddle frame and\r\nis light enough to be carried by one horse.\r\n\r\nTHE WIRELESS IN THE ARMY]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow High Do Wireless Masts Have to be?\r\n\r\nThe towering masts of the Marconi Trans-Oceanic stations are often\r\nsupposed to rise to their great height, so that an antennae will be\r\nraised above the obstructions between. If this were necessary, two\r\nwireless stations separated by the Atlantic would have to have masts\r\none hundred and twenty-five miles high to rise above the curvature\r\nof the earth. The path of the wireless waves, however, is not in a\r\nstraight line, but follows the curvature of the earth. Scientists\r\nexplain this by saying the rarefied air above the earth’s surface acts\r\nas a shell enclosing the globe.\r\n\r\nThe speed of wireless messages is placed at 186,000 miles per second. A\r\nwireless message will thus cross the Atlantic in about one-nineteenth\r\nof a second--a period of time too small for the human mind to grasp.\r\nIn other words, the wireless flash crosses in a fraction of a second a\r\ndistance that the earth requires five hours to turn on its axis and the\r\nfastest ships take nearly a week to cross.\r\n\r\nThe longest distance over which a wireless message can be sent is not\r\ndefinitely known; the present record was made in September, 1910, by\r\nMarconi from Clifden, Ireland, to Buenos Aires, Argentina, a distance\r\nof 6700 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WIRELESS PREVENTS ACCIDENTS AND SAVES MANY LIVES\r\n\r\nThis photograph makes us appreciate what a wonderful aid is wireless to\r\nnavigators.

S. ARMY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Guglielmo Marconi, Inventor of wireless telegraphy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man Who Invented Wireless Telegraphy.\r\n\r\nCommunication without wires for thousands of miles across oceans, from\r\ncontinent to continent, is a far cry from sending a wireless impulse\r\nthe length of a kitchen table. That is the development of twenty years.\r\n\r\nTo properly trace the development of wireless telegraphy, however, it\r\nis necessary to go back eighty-three years to when, in 1831, Michael\r\nFaraday discovered electro-magnetic induction between two entirely\r\nseparate circuits. Steinheil, of Munich, too, in 1838, suggested\r\nthat the metallic portion of a grounded electrical circuit might be\r\ndispensed with and a system of wireless telegraphy established. Then,\r\nin 1859, Bowman Lindsay demonstrated to the British Association his\r\nmethod of transmitting messages by means of magnetism through and\r\nacross the water without submerged wires. In 1867 James Clerk Maxwell\r\nlaid down the theory of electro-magnetism and predicted the existence\r\nof the electric waves that are now used in wireless telegraphy.\r\nDolbear, of Tufts College, in 1836, patented a plan for establishing\r\nwireless communication by means of two insulated elevated plates, but\r\nthere is no evidence that the method proposed by him effected the\r\ntransmission of signals between stations separated by any distance.\r\nA year later Heinrich Rudolph Hertz discovered the progressive\r\npropagation of electro-magnetic action through space and accomplished\r\nthe most valuable work in this period of speculation and experiment.\r\n\r\nJust twenty years ago, at his father’s country home in Bologna,\r\nGuglielmo Marconi, then a lad just out of his ’teens, read of the\r\nexperiments of Hertz and conceived the first wireless telegraph\r\napparatus. This was completed some months later and a message in the\r\nMorse Code was transmitted a distance of three or four feet, the length\r\nof the table on which the apparatus rested.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that he had laid the foundation of an epoch-making discovery\r\nyoung Marconi pursued his experiments and filed the first patent on the\r\nsubject on June 2, 1896. Further experiments were carried on in London\r\nduring that year and at the request of Sir William H. Preece, of the\r\nBritish Post Office, official tests were made, first over a distance of\r\nabout 100 yards and later for one and three-quarter miles.\r\n\r\nDuring the year following Mr. Marconi gave several demonstrations to\r\nthe officials of the various European governments and communication\r\nwas established up to 34 miles. In July of this year, 1897, the first\r\ncommercial wireless telegraph company was incorporated in England and\r\nthe first Marconi station was erected at the Needles, Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nOn June 3, 1898, Lord Kelvin visited this station and sent the first\r\npaid Marconigram. A month later the events of the Kingstown Regatta in\r\nDublin were reported by wireless telegraphy for a local newspaper from\r\nthe steamer “Flying Huntress.” In August of that year the royal yacht\r\n“Osborn” was equipped with a wireless set, in order that Queen Victoria\r\nmight communicate with the Prince of Wales, who was at Ladywood Cottage\r\nand suffering from the results of an accident to his knee. For sixteen\r\ndays, constant and uninterrupted communication was maintained. Then on\r\nChristmas Eve was inaugurated the first lightship wireless service,\r\nmessages being sent from the East Goodwin lightship to the lighthouse\r\nat South Foreland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING TO SEND MESSAGES ACROSS THE OCEAN\r\n\r\nThis photograph shows how wireless messages are prepared for direct\r\ntransmission across the ocean. The dots and dashes of the telegraphic\r\ncode are punched on tapes by skilled operators, thus insuring accuracy\r\nand a permanent record of each message. Five or six operators, and\r\nsometimes more, are steadily preparing these tapes, which are pasted\r\ntogether and run through a machine which operates the key at each\r\nperforation. A speed of 100 words a minute is thus obtained.]\r\n\r\nThree months later the first marine rescue was effected through this\r\ninstallation. The steamship “R. F. Matthews” ran into the lightship\r\nand lifeboats from the South Foreland station promptly responded to\r\nthe wireless appeal for aid. The most important wireless event abroad\r\nduring the year 1899 was the establishing of communication across the\r\nEnglish Channel, a distance of thirty miles.\r\n\r\nThe American public next learned something of Marconi’s invention, for\r\nin September and October of that year wireless telegraphy was employed\r\nin reporting the International yacht races between the “Shamrock” and\r\nthe “Columbia” for a New York newspaper. At the conclusions of the\r\nraces, the naval authorities requested a series of trials, during which\r\nwireless messages were exchanged between the cruiser “New York” and\r\nthe battleship “Massachusetts” up to a distance of about 36 miles. On\r\nleaving America, Marconi fitted the liner “St. Paul” with his apparatus\r\nand when 36 miles from the Needles Station, secured wireless reports\r\nof the war in South Africa. These were printed aboard the vessel in a\r\nleaflet called “The Transatlantic Times,” the first of the chain of\r\nwireless newspapers now published daily on practically all passenger\r\nsteamships. Six field wireless sets were dispatched to South Africa\r\nabout this time and were later of considerable service in the Boer War.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the foreground of this picture is seen the automatic\r\ntransmitter with the message perforated tape running through. This is\r\none of the smaller wireless equipments; much larger ones are used at\r\nthe new Marconi stations.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1900 brought the first commercial wireless contracts. By\r\nagreement with the Norddeutscher Lloyd, Marconi apparatus was installed\r\non a lightship, a lighthouse and aboard the liner “Kaiser Wilhelm der\r\nGrosse.” On July 4th the British Admiralty entered into a contract\r\nfor the installation of Marconi apparatus on thirty-two warships and\r\nshore stations and the erection of the high power station at Poldhu was\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\n~WORLD WIDE USE OF THE WIRELESS~\r\n\r\nWork on similar station at Cape Cod was begun early in 1901 and on\r\nAugust 12th the famous Nantucket Island and Nantucket lightship\r\nstations opened to report incoming vessels by wireless. Heavy gales\r\nin September and November wrecked the masts at both Poldhu and\r\nCape Cod stations and these were replaced by four wooden towers,\r\n210 feet high. Important experimental work was then shifted to St.\r\nJohn’s, Newfoundland, and on December 12th and 13th, signals were\r\nreceived across the Atlantic from Poldhu. This to Marconi was a great\r\nachievement and the forerunner of the present day trans-atlantic\r\nservice. But with the announcement that the long dreamt of feat had\r\nbeen accomplished a flood of vituperation from scientific men was let\r\nloose. It was nonsense; it was deliberate deception; the reading was\r\nin error, were among the comments. Another prank of the “young man\r\nwith a box,” one scientist termed it. It is amusing now to recall this\r\nextraordinary treatment, but it was hardly so amusing to the young\r\ninventor, then in his twenty-seventh year.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the skepticism, developments followed rapidly from then\r\non and in 1902, the year in which the American Marconi Company was\r\nestablished, full recognition to wireless telegraphy was given by the\r\nvarious governments.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful growth of the Marconi system within the last twelve years\r\nis well known to all and does not require detailing. But in view of its\r\nyouth as an industry and its inauspicious beginning, a glimpse into\r\nwhat the present day Marconi system comprises may be interesting.\r\n\r\nMore than 1800 ships are equipped with Marconi wireless and its shore\r\nstations are landmarks in practically every country on the globe.\r\n\r\nPress and commercial messages are transmitted daily from continent to\r\ncontinent direct.\r\n\r\nShore to ship and ship to shore business each year runs into millions\r\nof words.\r\n\r\nMarconi wireless within seventeen years, has become an absolute\r\nnecessity in the maritime field, an invaluable aid in others. Regular\r\ncommunication has been established with icebound settlements and desert\r\ncommunities, and official running orders transmitted to moving railway\r\ntrains. Its service is dependable under all conditions and embraces\r\nactivities and locations inaccessible to any other telegraph system.\r\nContinuous service is maintained and wireless messages for all parts of\r\nthe world at greatly reduced rates are received at any Western Union\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nThe direction finder and wireless compass are recent Marconi inventions.\r\n\r\nA wide variety of types of Marconi equipment are designed for the\r\nmerchant marine, warships, submarines, pleasure craft, motor cars\r\nand railroad trains; also portable signal corps sets, apparatus for\r\naircraft, cavalry sets, knapsack sets and high-power installations for\r\ntrans-ocean communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does a Fly Walk Upside Down?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a little sucker on the end of each of the fly’s feet which\r\nmakes his foot stick to the ceiling or any other place he walks, and\r\nwhich he can control at will. It is made very much like the sucker\r\nyou have seen with which a boy can pick up a flat stone--a circular\r\npiece of rubber or leather with a string in the middle and more or\r\nless bell shaped underneath. A boy can pick up a flat stone with this\r\nkind of a sucker by pressing the rubber or leather part down flat on\r\nthe stone and then pulling gently on it by the string. When he does\r\nthis he simply expels the air which is between the leather part of\r\nthe sucker and the stone, which creates a vacuum and the pressure of\r\nthe air on the outside part of the leather enables him to pick it up.\r\nThe fly has little suckers like these on each of his feet, and they\r\nact automatically when he puts his foot down. Of course the sticking\r\npower of each foot is adjusted to the weight of the fly, just as the\r\nsticking or lifting power of the boy’s sucker is regulated by the\r\nweight of the stone or other object he tries to pick up. If the weight\r\nof the object is sufficient to overcome the sticking power which the\r\nvacuum creates, the stone cannot be lifted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Money?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is quite difficult to give a broad definition of money that will be\r\nunderstood by all, for in different ages and lands many things have\r\nbeen used as money besides the coins and bills which we think of only\r\nwhen we think at all what money is. Anything that passes freely from\r\nhand to hand in a community in the payment of debts and for goods\r\npurchased, accepted freely by the person who offers it without any\r\nreference to the person who offers it, and which can be in turn used\r\nby the person accepting it to give to some one else in payment of debt\r\nor for the purchase of goods, is money. This is rather a long sentence\r\nand perhaps difficult to understand, and so we will try to analyze\r\nwhat this means. If some one offered you a pretty stone as money in\r\npayment of a debt, it would be as good as any kind of money if you in\r\nturn could pass it on to any other person to whom you owed a debt or in\r\npayment of something you bought. The stone might appear to you to be\r\nvaluable but it would not be good money unless you could count on every\r\none else in the community accepting it at the same value. If everybody\r\naccepts it at the same value, it is as good as any kind of money. So\r\nthat anything which is acceptable to the people in any community as a\r\nunit of value to pay debts, is good money, provided everybody thinks so\r\nand accepts it that way. In this case, then any kind of substance might\r\nbecome money provided it was used and accepted by everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Need Money?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need money for the sake of the convenience which it provides in\r\nmaking the exchange of one kind of wealth for another and as a standard\r\nof value. When a community has adopted something or anything which\r\nis regarded by all of the people as a standard of value, all of the\r\ndifficulties of trading disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Originated Money?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest tribes of savages did not need money because no individual\r\nin the tribe owned anything personally. All the property of the tribe\r\nbelonged to the tribe as a whole and not to any particular person.\r\nLater on, when different groups of savages came into contact with each\r\nother, there arose the custom of bartering or exchanging things which\r\none tribe possessed and which the other tribe wanted. In that way arose\r\nthe business of trading or of what we call doing business, and soon the\r\nneed of something by which to measure the values of different things\r\narose. Some of the old Australian tribes had a tough green stone which\r\nwas valuable for making hatchets. Members of another tribe would see\r\nsome of this stone and notice what good hatchets could be made from\r\nit--better hatchets than they had been able to make. Naturally they\r\nwanted it so much that it became very valuable in their eyes and so\r\nthey came wanting to buy green stones. But they had nothing like what\r\nwe could call money today. They had, however, a good deal of red ochre\r\nin their lands which they used to paint their bodies. They got this\r\nred ochre out of the ground on their own lands just as the other tribe\r\ngot green stones out of its ground, and those who owned the green\r\nstones which were good for making hatchets, wanted some red ochre very\r\nmuch, and so they traded green stones for red ochre. The green stones\r\nthen took on a value in themselves for making exchanges for various\r\ncommodities, and before long became a kind of money inside and outside\r\nthe community so that when they wanted to obtain anything, the price\r\nwas put by the merchant as so many green stones and he accepted these\r\nin payment for goods given in exchange. He was willing to do this\r\nbecause he knew he could use them in making trades for almost anything\r\nhe might want, provided he had enough of the green stones. So you see\r\nthese green stones of the Australian tribe became a rudimentary kind of\r\nmoney, just because a desire had arisen to possess them; and the red\r\nochre was actual money in the same sense, for when this tribe found\r\nthat other tribes would value this red ochre, they began getting the\r\nthings they wanted and paying for them in red ochre. But the “unit of\r\nvalue” had to be developed to make a currency that was elastic. It\r\nrequired something that could be carried about easily--in fact it had\r\nto be something small enough so a number of units of value could be\r\ncarried about without too much trouble. The Indians of British Columbia\r\nsolved this difficulty of making an elastic currency by adopting as a\r\nunit of value a haiqua shell which they wore in strings as ornamental\r\nborders of their dresses--and one string of these shells was worth\r\none beaver’s skin. These shells then were real money and one of the\r\nearliest forms of it.\r\n\r\nThe skins of animals were long used by savage tribes as money. The\r\nskins were valuable in trading and a man’s fortune was reckoned by the\r\nnumber of skins he owned. As soon as the animals became domesticated,\r\nhowever, the whole animal replaced the skin as the unit of value. This\r\nchange undoubtedly came because a whole animal is more valuable than\r\nonly its skin. The first skins obtainable however were worn by wild\r\nanimals--the kind that the people could not deliver to someone else\r\nalive and whole. But when the animals became domesticated, which meant\r\nthat man tamed them and kept them where he could control them at will,\r\nthe skin and the wild animal ceased to be a unit of value because it\r\nwas an uncertain kind of money. Among domestic animals, oxen and sheep\r\nwere the earliest forms of money--an ox was considered worth ten sheep.\r\nThis idea of using cattle as money was used by many tribes in many\r\nlands. We find traces of it in the laws of Iceland. The Latin word\r\npecunia (pecus) shows that the earliest Roman money was composed of\r\ncattle. The English word fee indicates this also. The Irish law records\r\nshow the same evidence of the use of cattle as money and within recent\r\nyears the cattle still form the basis of the currency of the Zulus and\r\nKaffirs.\r\n\r\nWhen slavery became prominent many lands adopted the slaves as the unit\r\nof value. A man’s wealth was reckoned by the number of slaves he owned.\r\n\r\nThen, when the practice of agriculture became more common, people\r\nused the products of the soil as money--maize, olive oil, cocoanuts,\r\ntea and corn--the latter is said to pass current as actual money in\r\ncertain parts of Norway now. They used these products of the soil for\r\nmoney even in our own country. Our ancestors in Maryland and Virginia\r\nbefore the Revolutionary War, and even after, used tobacco as money.\r\nThey passed laws making tobacco money and paid the salaries of the\r\ngovernment officials and collected all taxes in tobacco.\r\n\r\nOther early forms of money were ornaments and these serve the purpose\r\nof money among all uncivilized tribes. In India they used cowrie\r\nshells--a small yellowish-white shell with a fine gloss. The Fiji\r\nIslanders used whales’ teeth; some of the South Sea Island tribes used\r\nred feathers; other nations used mineral products as money--such as\r\nsalt in Abyssinia and Mexico.\r\n\r\nUp to this point we have talked about the things used as money from\r\nthe standpoint of primitive forms of money. Today the metals have\r\npractically driven all these other crude forms of money out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMetallic Forms of Money.\r\n\r\n\r\n~WHY WE USE METALS FOR COINING~\r\n\r\nThe use of metals as money goes far back in the history of civilization\r\nbut it has never been possible to trace the historical order of the\r\nadoption of the various metals for the purposes. Iron according to the\r\nstatement of Aristotle was at one time extensively used as money.\r\nCopper, in conjunction with iron, was used in early times as money in\r\nChina; and until comparatively a short time ago was used for the coins\r\nof smaller value in Japan. Iron spikes were used in Central Africa\r\nand nails in Scotland; lead money is now used in Burmah. Copper has\r\nlong been used as money. The early coins of England were made of tin.\r\nFinally, however, came silver and silver was the principal form of\r\nmoney up to a few years ago. It was the basis of Greek coins introduced\r\nat Rome in 269 B. C. Most of the money of Medieval times was composed\r\nof silver.\r\n\r\nThe earliest traces of gold used as money is seen in pictures of\r\nancient Egyptians “weighing in scales heaps of gold and silver rings.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Use Gold and Silver as Money Principally?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a good many reasons why gold and silver have become almost\r\nuniversal materials for use as money. Perhaps this will be better\r\nunderstood if these reasons are set down in order.\r\n\r\n1st. It is necessary that the material out of which money is made\r\nshould be valuable, but nothing was ever used as money that had not\r\nfirst become desirable and, therefore, valuable as money. This is only\r\none of the incidental reasons for taking gold and silver for coining\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n2nd. To serve its purpose best, money should be easy to carry\r\naround--in other words, its value should be high in proportion to its\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThe absence of this quality made the early forms of money such as\r\nskins, corn, tobacco, etc., undesirable. It was difficult to carry very\r\nmuch money about. Imagine the skin of a sheep worth a dollar, say,\r\nand having to carry ten of them down to pay the grocer. To a certain\r\nextent this difficulty occurred with iron and copper money and in times\r\nwhen they used live cattle it was a pretty expensive job to pay your\r\ndebts because, while the cattle could move, it was still expensive to\r\ndrive them from place to place. A man who accepted a thousand cattle\r\nin payment had to go to some expense in getting them home. Then it was\r\nexpensive to have money when live cattle were used because the cattle,\r\nof course, had to be fed and from that point of view the poor man who\r\nhad no money was better off than the rich man who had money. When\r\ncattle were used as money it cost a lot to keep it. Our kind of money\r\ndoesn’t eat anything; in fact, if you put it in a savings bank, it will\r\nearn interest money for you. But when cattle were used as money it cost\r\na great deal to keep them and so it was worse than not earning any\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n3rd. Another quality that money should possess is divisibility without\r\ndamage and also the quality of being united again. This quality is\r\npossessed by the metals in every sense because they can be fused, while\r\nskins and precious stones suffer in value greatly when they are divided.\r\n\r\n4th. The material out of which money is made should be the same\r\nthroughout in quality and weight so that one unit of money should be\r\nworth as much as any other unit. This could never be true of skins or\r\ncattle as the difference in the size of skins is very great sometimes,\r\nand a small skin from the same animal could not be worth as much as a\r\nlarge one, or a skin of an animal of inferior quality so valuable as a\r\nvery fine one.\r\n\r\n5th. Another quality which money should possess is durability. This\r\nrequirement made it necessary to use something else besides animals or\r\nvegetable substances. Animals die and vegetables will not keep and so\r\nlose their value. Even iron is apt to rust and through that process\r\nlose more or less of its value.\r\n\r\n6th. The materials out of which money is made should be easy to\r\ndistinguish and their value easy to determine. For this reason such\r\nthings as precious stones are not good to use as money because it\r\ntakes an expert to determine their value and even they are not always\r\ncertain to be correct.\r\n\r\n7th. Then a very important quality that the material out of which money\r\nis made is that its value should be steady. The value of cattle varies\r\nvery greatly and, in fact, most of the materials out of which the first\r\ncurrencies were made were subject to quick change in value in a short\r\ntime. The value of gold and silver does not change excepting at long\r\nintervals. Gold and silver are both durable and easily recognizable.\r\nThey can be melted, divided and united. The same is true of other\r\nmetallic substances, but iron as stated is subject to rust and its\r\nvalue is low; lead is too soft. Tin will break, and both of them and\r\ncopper also are of low value. Gold and silver change only slowly in\r\nvalue when the change at all; they do not lose any of their value by\r\nage, rust or other cause; they are hard metals and do not, therefore,\r\nwear. Their value in proportion to the bulk of the pieces used for\r\nmoney is so large that the money made from them can be carried without\r\ndiscomfort and it is almost impossible to imitate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Made the First Cent?\r\n\r\n\r\nVermont was the first state to issue copper cents. In June, 1785, she\r\ngranted the authority to Ruben Harmon, Jr., to make money for the state\r\nfor two years. In October of the same year, Connecticut granted the\r\nright to coin 10,000 pounds in copper cents, known as the Connecticut\r\ncent of 1785. Massachusetts, in 1786, established a mint and coined\r\n$60,000 in cents and half cents. In the same year, New Jersey granted\r\nthe right to coin $10,000 at 15 coppers to the shilling. In 1781 the\r\nContinental Congress directed Robert Morris to investigate the matter\r\nof governmental coinage. He proposed a standard based on the Spanish\r\ndollar, consisting of 100 units, each unit to be called a cent. His\r\nplan was rejected. In 1784, Jefferson proposed to Congress, that the\r\nsmallest coin should be of copper, and that 200 of them should pass for\r\none dollar. The plan was adopted, but in 1786, 100 was substituted. In\r\n1792 the coinage of copper cents, containing 264 grains, and half cents\r\nin proportion, was authorized; their weight was subsequently reduced.\r\nIn 1853 the nickel cent was substituted and the half cent discontinued,\r\nand in 1864 the bronze cent was introduced, weighing 48 grains and\r\nconsisting of 95 per cent. of copper, and the remainder of tin and zinc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Did the Name Uncle Sam Originate?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Uncle Sam is a jocular name long in use for the Government of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nShortly after the war of 1812 was declared, Elbert Anderson of New\r\nYork State, who was a contractor for the army, went to Troy, New York,\r\nto purchase a quantity of provisions. At that place the provisions\r\nwere inspected, the official inspectors being two brothers named\r\nWilson--Ebenezer and Samuel. The latter was very popular among the men\r\nand was known as “Uncle Sam Wilson” and everybody called him that.\r\nThe boxes in which the provisions were packed were stamped with four\r\nletters, E. A. for Elbert Anderson, and U. S. for United States. One of\r\nthe men engaged in making the inspection asked another of the workmen\r\nwho happened to be a jocular fellow, what the letters E. A. U. S. on\r\nthe boxes stood for. He said in reply that he did not know but thought\r\nthey probably meant Elbert Anderson and Uncle Sam Wilson, and that they\r\nhad left off the W which would stand for Wilson. The suggestion caught\r\non quickly and as such things often do, the joke spread rapidly so that\r\neverybody soon thought of the name “Uncle Sam” whenever they saw the\r\nletters U. S. on anything or in any place.\r\n\r\nThe suit of striped trousers and long tailed coat and beaver hat\r\nin which Uncle Sam is now always represented in pictures, was the\r\ninspiration of the famous cartoonist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WORLD’S BREAD LOAVES\r\n\r\n  Egypt\r\n  2500 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Unleavened Bread\r\n  2000 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Pompeii\r\n  50 A.D.\r\n\r\n  Palestine\r\n\r\n  Modern American Loaf\r\n\r\n  England\r\n\r\n  England\r\n\r\n  France\r\n\r\n  Hungary\r\n\r\n  Spain\r\n\r\n  Switzerland\r\n\r\n  Bohemia\r\n\r\n  Holland\r\n\r\n  Italy\r\n\r\n  Austria\r\n\r\n  Germany\r\n\r\n  Balkan States]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARVESTING WHEAT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Loaf of Bread\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is Bread so Important?\r\n\r\nThe history of bread as a food reads like a romance. It has played an\r\nimportant part in the destinies of mankind and its struggles through\r\nthe ages to perfection. The progress of nations through their different\r\nperiods of development can be traced by the quality and quantity of\r\nbread they have used.\r\n\r\nNo other food has taken such an important part in the civilization of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nTo a large extent it has been the means of changing his habits from\r\nthose of a savage to those of a civilized being. It has supplied the\r\npeaceful pursuits of agriculture and turned him from war and the chase.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that the civilized and the semi-civilized\r\npeople of the earth can be divided into two classes, based upon their\r\nprincipal cereal foods: the rice eaters and the bread eaters.\r\n\r\nEvery one admits that rice eaters are less progressive, while bread\r\neaters have always been the leaders of civilization.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that just as Japan is changing from a\r\nrice-eating nation to a bread-eating nation she is asserting her power.\r\n\r\nAny one who stops to consider the history of nations will see that this\r\nmatter of what we eat is the one question of vital importance.\r\n\r\nBread is one of the earliest, the most generally used and one of the\r\nmost important foods used by man. Without bread the world would not\r\nexist without great hardship. On bread alone a nation of people can\r\nexist, and to sit down to a meal without it causes us to feel at once\r\nthat something is missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Was the Origin and Meaning of Bread?\r\n\r\nBread is baked from many substances, although when we think of bread,\r\nwe usually think of wheat bread. It is sometimes made from roots,\r\nfruits and the bark of trees, but generally only from grains such as\r\nwheat, rye, corn, etc. The word bread comes from an old word _bray_,\r\nmeaning to pound. This came from the method used in preparing the food.\r\nFood which was pounded was said to be brayed and later this spelling\r\nwas changed to bread. Properly speaking, however, these brayed or\r\nground materials are not really bread in our sense of using the term\r\nuntil they are moistened with water, when it becomes dough. The word\r\n_dough_ is an old one meaning to “moisten.” This dough was in olden\r\ntimes immediately baked in hot ashes and a hard indigestible lump of\r\nbread was the result. Accidentally it was discovered that if the dough\r\nwas left for a time before baking, allowing it to ferment, it would\r\nwhen mixed with more dough, swell up and become porous. Thus we got our\r\nword loaf from an old word _lifian_, which meant to raise up or to lift\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Was Wheat First Used in Making Bread?\r\n\r\nIt is not clearly known when or by whom wheat was discovered, but it\r\nseems to have been known from the earliest times. It is mentioned in\r\nthe Bible, can be traced to ancient Egypt and there are records showing\r\nthat the Chinese cultivated wheat as early as 2700 B.C. To-day it\r\nsupplies the principal article for making bread to all the civilized\r\nnations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the wheat plant is said to have been a kind of grass\r\nwhich is given a Latin name _Ægilops ovata_ by the botanists.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill Wheat Grow Wild?\r\n\r\nThis is a question that has puzzled the world’s scientists for more\r\nthan two thousand years. From time to time it has been reported by\r\ninvestigators in various parts of the world that here and there wheat\r\nhas been found growing wild and doing well, but every time a further\r\ninvestigation is made, it develops that the wheat has been cultivated\r\nby some one. There is as yet no evidence for believing that wheat will\r\ngrow in a wild state.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Difference between Graham Flour and Whole Wheat?\r\n\r\nGraham flour from which Graham bread is baked is made from unbolted\r\nflour. The process of bolting flour, which is described in one of the\r\nfollowing pages, consists briefly in taking out of it all but the\r\ninside of the grain of wheat. When this has been done, we have pure\r\nwhite flour.\r\n\r\nIn making Graham flour every part of the grain of wheat is left in the\r\nflour, and ground up finely. Many people think that Graham flour is\r\nmade from a special grain called Graham, but this is not true. It is\r\nsaid that Graham bread is not so good for you because it contains the\r\noutside covering of the wheat grain or bran which is composed of almost\r\npure silica, the same substance of which glass is made, and cannot\r\ntherefore be good for us.\r\n\r\nWhole wheat flour is made from the whole grain of wheat from which the\r\noutside covering or bran has been separated. It contains everything but\r\nthe bran and is therefore the most nutritious flour made.\r\n\r\nThe grain of wheat has several coverings of bran coats, the outer one\r\nof which is the one composed of silica, and which is not valuable\r\nas food. Underneath this husk--are found the inner bran coats,\r\nwhich contain the gluten. Gluten is a dark substance containing the\r\nflesh-forming or nitrogenous elements, which are valuable in muscle\r\nbuilding. The inside or heart of the grain of wheat consists of cells\r\nfilled with starch, a fine white mealy powder which has little value\r\nas food, but is a great heat producer. Sometimes in making whole wheat\r\nflour, the heart of the grain is also removed, making a pure gluten\r\nflour. The name whole wheat for flour is not accurate, therefore, for\r\nGraham flour is made of the whole wheat grain, while “whole wheat”\r\nflour is made of only certain parts of the grain of wheat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wheat conditioners for tempering the wheat before being\r\nground by the corrugated roller mills.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is Flour Made?\r\n\r\nIn great factories the raw material is frequently taken in at one end\r\nand comes out of the opposite end as a finished locomotive, a Pullman\r\npalace car, or a pair of shoes. There is no such progression in making\r\nflour. The wheat comes in at one place as a plain Spring or Winter\r\nwheat and at another goes out as flour, but in the process parts of\r\nit may go from top to bottom of the big mill 30 times. Instead of a\r\nfactory where everything moves along from hand to hand or machine to\r\nmachine, the flour mill is like a human body--a huge framework like the\r\nbones, with thousands of carrying devices, “elevators,” “spouts” and\r\n“conveyors,” like the veins and arteries of the blood-carrying system.\r\nStop up a vein of wheat, the mill becomes clogged, and finally must\r\nshut down if it cannot be mechanically relieved. It is an intricate and\r\nintensely interesting process, the result of year-to-year experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEPARATING THE WHEAT FIBER AND GERMS\r\n\r\nPurifier for separating the fiber, germ, and other impurities from the\r\nsemolina (grits) before it is finally crushed or ground into flour by\r\nsmooth roller mills.]\r\n\r\n\r\nScouring that Suggests a Dutch Kitchen.\r\n\r\nFrom the storage bins the wheat is drawn off through conveyors to the\r\nfirst of several cleaning processes, the “separators,” where the coarse\r\ngrain which naturally comes with the wheat, such as corn and oats, and\r\nimperfect kernels of wheat, is taken out. After this general cleaning\r\nthe grain goes to the “scouring machine,” which is an interesting\r\ndevice--a rapidly revolving cylinder with what are called “beaters”\r\nattached. The grain is thrown against perforated iron screens. Any\r\nclinging dirt is loosened, and a strong current of air passing through\r\nthe cylinder is constantly “calling for dust,” as the miller aptly\r\nexpresses it, and carries the impurities away as dust and dirt. Indeed,\r\nthe cleaning process seems to be a constant one from the time the\r\nwheat enters the mill until the flour is made. Having been cleansed,\r\nthe wheat is now ready for the rolls except for a “tempering” process,\r\nwhich is to prepare the grain, so that the outside of the wheat may be\r\ntaken off without injury to the inside or kernel.\r\n\r\nThen as the grain passes to the rolls there begins a gradual reduction\r\nof wheat to flour which is most intricate.\r\n\r\nThe first sets of rolls are corrugated and so adjusted as to “break”\r\neach grain of wheat into 12 to 15 parts. The “breaking” process goes on\r\nthrough five different sets of rolls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRINDING THE WHEAT FOR MAKING FLOUR\r\n\r\nCorrugated roller mills for grinding the wheat after it has been\r\ncleaned.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wooden spouts for conveying the different products, bran\r\nand partly ground wheat, from one machine to another.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLOUR IS READY FOR BAKING\r\n\r\nGyrating sifter for separating the bran particles from the flour and\r\nsemolina.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Big Bolters with Silken Sieves.\r\n\r\nClosely allied with the rolling process is the bolting process,\r\nwhich, working hand in hand with it has made modern flour making so\r\nperfect. The bolting process consists of a series of sieves--a sifting\r\nof the broken grain so that it is finally, after repeated breaking\r\nand sifting, a flour. The bolter machine contains a number of sieves\r\ncovered with silk bolting cloth with varying mesh or number of threads\r\nto the square inch. This bolting machine, moving rapidly, makes from\r\n8 to 10 different separations of the material. From rolls to bolters,\r\nfrom bolters to purifiers, from purifiers to rolls, over and over, the\r\nprocess continues, until five different grades of “middlings” have\r\nbeen selected by the mechanical hands of the millers. The purifier is\r\nstill another step to the process. It is a machine having eight sieves\r\nof different mesh. The “middlings” flow down over the different sieves\r\nin a thin sheet, a current of air meantime drawing all impurities out.\r\nWith this purifying process completed, the material is ready for the\r\nsmooth rolls.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mill Tries to Catch Up with the Bins.\r\n\r\nWhen the flour is made it is conveyed to large round bins--five sheets\r\nof hard wood pressed together. These bins are being filled all the time\r\nand being emptied all the time, the mill being about seven hours behind\r\nthe capacity of the bins, so that from start to finish the modern flour\r\nmill is a tremendously busy place.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the bins and connecting with them are the flour\r\npackers--automatic devices which pack a 3¹⁄₂-pound paper sack as\r\naccurately as a 196-pound barrel. The filled packages are sent down\r\n“chutes” to the shipping floor. There they go to wagons or through\r\nother chutes to boats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Lead Pencil[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] Courtesy of The Scientific American.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do They Call Them Lead-pencils?\r\n\r\n~WHERE LEAD PENCILS COME FROM~\r\n\r\nThe lead-pencil so generally used today is not, as its name would\r\nimply, made from lead, but from graphite. It derives its name from\r\nthe fact that prior to the time when pencils were made from graphite,\r\nmetallic lead was employed for the purpose. Graphite was first used\r\nin pencils after the discovery in 1565 of the famous Cumberland mine\r\nin England. This graphite was of remarkable purity and could be used\r\nwithout further treatment by cutting it into thin slabs and encasing\r\nthem in wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Made the First Lead-pencils in America?\r\n\r\nFor two centuries England enjoyed practically a monopoly of the\r\nlead-pencil industry. In the eighteenth century, however, the\r\nlead-pencil industry had found its way into Germany. In 1761, Caspar\r\nFaber, in the village of Stein, near the ancient city of Nuremberg,\r\nBavaria, started in a modest way the manufacture of lead-pencils, and\r\nNuremberg became and remained the center of the lead-pencil industry\r\nfor more than a century. For five generations Faber’s descendants made\r\nlead-pencils. Up to the present day they have continued to devote\r\ntheir interest and energy to the development and perfection of pencil\r\nmaking. Eberhard Faber, a great-grandson of Caspar Faber, immigrated\r\nto this country, and, in 1849, established himself in New York City.\r\nIn 1861, when the war tariff first went into effect, he erected his\r\nown pencil factory in New York City, and thus became the pioneer of\r\nthe lead-pencil industry in this country. Since then four other firms\r\nhave established pencil factories here. Wages, as compared to those\r\npaid in Germany, were very high, and Eberhard Faber realized the\r\nnecessity of creating labor-saving machinery to overcome this handicap.\r\nMany automatic machines were invented which greatly simplified the\r\nmethods of pencil making and improved the product. To-day American\r\nmanufacturers supply nine-tenths of the home demand and have largely\r\nentered into the competition of the world’s markets.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are Lead-pencils Made of?\r\n\r\nThe principal raw materials that enter into the making of a\r\nlead-pencil are graphite, clay, cedar and rubber. Although graphite\r\noccurs in comparatively abundant quantities in many localities, it is\r\nrarely of sufficient purity to be available for pencil making. Oxides\r\nof iron, silicates and other impurities are found in the ore, all of\r\nwhich must be carefully separated to insure a smooth, serviceable\r\nmaterial. The graphites found in Eastern Siberia, Mexico, Bohemia and\r\nCeylon are principally used by manufacturers.\r\n\r\n  Pictures by courtesy Joseph Dixon Crucible Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows the shape in which the cedar slats arrive at the factory.\r\nThese slats after grading are boiled in steam to remove what remaining\r\nsap there may be in the wood. The slats are then dried in steam-drying\r\nrooms. Then the next step is grooving and gives the results shown by\r\nFig. 2. Now the wood is ready to receive the “leads” (which you will\r\nremember are a mixture of graphite and clay), which are placed between\r\ntwo slats sandwich fashion, glued, put in forms that hold them over\r\nnight under a thousand pounds pressure. Fig. 3 shows the leads laid in\r\none of the grooved slats.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are Lead-pencils Made?\r\n\r\nThe graphite, as it comes from the mines, is broken into small pieces,\r\nthe impure particles being separated by hand. It is then finely\r\ndivided in large pulverizers and placed in tubs of water, so that the\r\nlighter particles of graphite float off from the heavier particles of\r\nimpurities. This separating, in the cheaper grades, is also done by\r\nmeans of centrifugal machines, but the results are not as satisfactory.\r\nAfter separation, the graphite is filtered through filter-presses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Some Pencils Hard and Others Soft?\r\n\r\nThe clay, after having been subjected to a similar process, is placed\r\nin mixers with the graphite, in proportions dependent upon the grade\r\nof hardness that is desired. A greater proportion of clay produces a\r\ngreater degree of hardness; a lesser proportion increases the softness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.\r\n\r\nFIG. 5.\r\n\r\nFIG. 6.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 shows a prospective view of the block as it appears when taken\r\nout of the form; the leads can be seen in the end. These blocks are fed\r\nto machines which cut out the pencils in one operation. An idea of this\r\noperation is given by Fig. 5, which shows a block half cut through. The\r\npencils come out quite smooth, but are sand-papered to a finer finish\r\nbefore receiving the finishing coats. The finer grades of pencils are\r\ngiven from seven to nine coats of varnish before being passed along for\r\nthe next process. Fig. 6 shows a pencil after it has been machined and\r\nbefore it has been varnished and stamped.]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the requisite degree of hardness is obtained by the\r\nsubsequent operation, viz., the compressing of the lead and shaping it\r\ninto form ready to be glued into the wood casings. A highly compressed\r\nlead will produce a pencil of greater wearing qualities, an important\r\nfeature in a high-grade pencil. Hydraulic presses are used for this\r\npurpose; and the mixture of clay and graphite, which is still in a\r\nplastic condition and has been formed into loaves, is placed into these\r\npresses. The presses are provided with a die conforming to the caliber\r\nof the lead desired, through which die the material is forced. The die\r\nis usually cut from a sapphire or emerald or other very hard mineral\r\nsubstance, so that it will not wear away too quickly from the friction\r\nof the lead. The lead leaves the press in one continuous string, which\r\nis cut into the lengths required (usually seven inches for the ordinary\r\nsize of pencil), is placed in crucibles, and fired in muffle furnaces.\r\nThe lead is now ready for use, and receives only a wooden case to\r\nconvert it into a pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does the Wooden Part of a Lead-pencil Come from?\r\n\r\nThe wood used in pencil making must be close and straight grained,\r\nsoft, so that it can readily be whittled, and capable of taking a good\r\npolish. No better wood has been found than the red cedar, a native of\r\nthe United States, a durable, compact and fragrant wood to-day almost\r\nexclusively used by pencil makers the world over. The best quality is\r\nobtained from the Southern States, Florida and Alabama in particular.\r\n\r\nThe wood is cut into slats about 7 inches long, 2¹⁄₂ inches wide, and\r\n¹⁄₄ inch thick. It is then thoroughly dried in kilns to separate the\r\nexcess of moisture and resin and to prevent subsequent warping. After\r\nthis the slats are passed through automatic grooving machines, each\r\nslat receiving six semi-circular grooves, into which the leads are\r\nplaced, while a second slab with similar grooves is brushed with glue\r\nand covered over the slat containing the leads. This is passed through\r\na molding-machine, which turns out pencils shaped in the form desired,\r\nround, hexagon, etc. The pencils are now passed through sanding\r\nmachines, to provide them with a smooth surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Color Put on the Outside of the Pencil?\r\n\r\nAfter sand-papering, which is a necessary preliminary to the coloring\r\nprocess, when fine finishes are desired, the pencils are varnished by\r\none of several methods. That most commonly employed is the mechanical\r\nmethod by which the pencils are fed from hoppers one at a time through\r\nsmall apertures just large enough to admit the pencil. The varnish is\r\napplied to the pencil automatically while passing through, and the\r\npencils are then deposited on a long belt or drying pan. They are\r\ncarried slowly a distance of about twenty feet, the varnish deposited\r\non the pencils meanwhile drying, and are emptied into a receptacle.\r\nWhen sufficient pencils have accumulated, they are taken back to the\r\nhopper of the machine and the operation repeated. This is done as often\r\nas is necessary to produce the desired finish. The better grades are\r\npassed through ten times or more. Another method is that of dipping\r\nin pans of varnish, the pencils being suspended by their ends from\r\nframes, immersed their entire length and withdrawn very slowly by\r\nmachine. A smooth enameled effect is the result. The finest grades of\r\npencils are polished by hand. This work requires considerable deftness;\r\nmonths of practice are necessary to develop a skilled workman. After\r\nbeing varnished, the pencils are passed through machines by which the\r\naccumulation of varnish is sand-papered from their ends. The ends\r\nare then trimmed by very sharp knives to give them a clean, finished\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nStamping is the next operation. The gold or silver leaf is cut into\r\nnarrow strips and laid on the pencil, whereupon the pencil is placed in\r\na stamping press, and the heated steel die brought in contact with the\r\nleaf, causing the latter to adhere to the pencil where the letters of\r\nthe die touch. The surplus leaf is removed, and, after a final cleaning\r\nthe pencil is ready to be boxed, unless it is to be further embellished\r\nby the addition of a metal tip and rubber, or other attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the Eraser Put On a Pencil?\r\n\r\nIn this country about nine-tenths of the pencils are provided with\r\nrubber erasers. These are either glued into the wood with the lead, or\r\nthe pencils are provided with small metal ferrules threaded on one end,\r\ninto which the rubber eraser-plugs are inserted. These ferrules are\r\nmade from sheet brass, which is cupped by means of power presses, drawn\r\nthrough subsequent operations into tubes of four- or five-inch lengths,\r\ncut to the required size, threaded and nickel-plated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Courtesy of Doubleday, Page & Co.\r\n\r\nA SOUTHERN COTTON FIELD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Bale of Cotton\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Cotton Come From?\r\n\r\nWe get cotton from a plant which grows best in the warm climate of our\r\nSouthern States. Cotton has been known to the people of the world for\r\na long time. Before the birth of Christ people knew about cotton. They\r\nthought it was wool which grew on a tree instead of a sheep’s back.\r\nNo other plant is of such value to man as cotton. We should learn\r\nsomething about a plant that is used by man in so many ways as cotton.\r\n\r\nThe cotton plant of our Southern States is a small shrub-like annual\r\nabout four feet high. The flowers of the cotton plant are white at\r\nfirst but change to cream color and then are tinged with red. This\r\nchange takes place over a period of four days when the petals drop off\r\nand leave what is called a “boll” in the calyx of the flower. This\r\nboll, which is to contain the cotton, is really the seed container of\r\nthe cotton plant and keeps on growing larger until it is about as big\r\nas a hen’s egg. When it is fully grown or ripe the boll cracks and the\r\nseeds and fibrous lint burst forth. The bolls are then gathered and\r\ntaken to a cotton gin, where the seeds are separated from the lint and\r\nthe lint prepared for weaving.\r\n\r\nThe boll is divided into from three to five sections. Each section\r\ncontains a quantity of lint and seeds. When the boll is fully grown\r\nthe covering of each of the sections cracks and opens up, revealing\r\nthe contents. It is just like opening the door of each section and\r\nhaving the contents burst out. When these bolls burst open, there is no\r\nmore beautiful sight in the world than to look out over a cotton field\r\nand see the colored people--the “cotton pickers”--busy at their work\r\npicking off the bolls.\r\n\r\nWhen the crop is gathered and ginned, the lint is packed into bales and\r\ntaken to the cotton mill, where it is made into cloth. One of the most\r\ninteresting industrial processes in the world is to see the bale of\r\ncotton go into a cotton mill and come out a piece of cotton goods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COTTON ARRIVES AT THE MILL\r\n\r\nBALES OF COTTON AT COTTON MILL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPENING MACHINES.\r\n\r\nThe bales are opened, and the cotton is thrown into the large hoppers\r\nat the front of these machines, which open and loosen the fibers,\r\nwork out lumps and remove the grosser impurities, such as dirt, leaf,\r\nseed and trash. A strong air draft carries off the dust and foreign\r\nparticles, and lifts the cotton through trunks to the floor above.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAPPER MACHINES.\r\n\r\nIn these machines, known as Breaker and Finisher Lappers, more of the\r\ntrash and impurities is beaten out of the cotton, and the lint is\r\ncarried forward and wound into rolls of cotton batting, known as laps.\r\nSeveral of these are doubled and drawn into one so as to get the weight\r\nof each yard as uniform as possible.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST STEPS IN MAKING COTTON CLOTH\r\n\r\nCARD ROOM.\r\n\r\nIn these machines, known as Revolving Flat Top Cards, the cotton passes\r\nover revolving cylinders clothed with wire teeth, and the fibers are\r\ncombed out and laid parallel with each other. They are delivered at the\r\nfront of the machine as a filmy web, which is gathered together and\r\nformed into a soft downy ribbon or rope, known as card sliver. This is\r\nautomatically coiled and delivered into cans.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAWING FRAMES.\r\n\r\nTo insure uniformity in weight, so that the yarn when spun shall run\r\neven, the card slivers are doubled and drawn out, redoubled and again\r\ndrawn out, somewhat in the manner of a candy maker pulling taffy, only\r\nhere the process is continuous. Six strands of the card sliver are fed\r\nin together at the back of the drawing frames, pulled out and delivered\r\nas one; and the process repeated. This produces a sliver more uniform\r\nin weight, and in which the fibres are more parallel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLUBBERS.\r\n\r\nThe sliver from the drawing frames is taken to machines called\r\nslubbers, where again the fibers are drawn out, and the strand of\r\ncotton, now much finer and known as slubber roving, is given a bit of\r\ntwist to hold it together, and is wound on large bobbins.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUTTING THE COTTON FIBER ON BOBBINS\r\n\r\nSPEEDERS.\r\n\r\nThe large bobbins of roving from the slubbers are taken to other\r\nmachines known as Speeders, and are unwound through the machine, again\r\ndrawn out finer and finer, and rewound on smaller bobbins. The strand\r\nof cotton known as speeder roving is now ready to be taken to the\r\nspinning room for the final draft and twist necessary to turn it into\r\nyarn.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINNING FRAMES.\r\n\r\nThe roving from the speeders is placed on the Spinning Frames, and now\r\nundergoes its final draft as it passes through the spinning rolls. The\r\nattenuated fibres are then twisted firmly together by the action of the\r\nspindles, which turn at a speed of about 10,000 revolutions per minute.\r\nThe yarn thus formed is wound on bobbins and is ready to be dyed and\r\nweaved.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COTTON IS READY FOR DYEING\r\n\r\nSPOOLERS.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of yarn are delivered at the spinning frames, known as warp\r\nand filling, which make respectively the lengthwise and crosswise\r\nthreads of the cloth. The filling is in its completed form ready for\r\nthe loom; the warp must first be gotten into shape for dyeing and then\r\narranged in parallel rows or sheets of thread for weaving. The first of\r\nthese processes is spooling, and consists simply in unwinding the yarn\r\nfrom the small bobbins on which it is spun, and rewinding it on large\r\nspools.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WARPERS.\r\n\r\nThe spools of warp yarn are placed in large wooden racks or creels from\r\nwhich they can conveniently unwind. The separate threads are drawn\r\nthrough little wires in the warpers, and are gathered into a bunch or\r\nrope of threads, which is wound in a large cylindrical ball known as a\r\nwarp. If any thread breaks while passing through the warper, the little\r\nwire drops and stops the machine. In this way full count of threads and\r\nuniform weight of the goods is insured.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYE-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nHere the warps, after being boiled and softened to enable the dye to\r\npenetrate, are passed through the indigo vats. Several runs are made to\r\nget the beautiful depth of color. This Dye-house is equipped with one\r\nhundred indigo vats, and is one of the best-lighted and cleanest-kept\r\ndye-houses in the world.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE THE COTTON IS WOVEN INTO CLOTH\r\n\r\nBEAMING FRAMES.\r\n\r\nAfter being dyed, the warps are washed and then passed through drying\r\nmachinery, from which they are delivered in coils. These are brought\r\nto the beaming frames, where they are again spread out into sheets of\r\nparallel threads, and passed through the teeth of a steel comb, which\r\nseparates the threads and prevents tangling, and in this form they are\r\nwound on huge iron spools known as slasher beams.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLASHERS.\r\n\r\nFrom the beaming frames the warps are taken to machines known as\r\nSlashers, where they are sized or stiffened to enable them to stand the\r\nchafing at the looms incidental to the process of weaving. The slasher\r\nbeams are placed in an iron frame at the back of the slashers and\r\nunwound together through the machine. With them some additional threads\r\nof white yarn are unwound at either side to form the selvage of the\r\ncloth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEAVE ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe sheet of warp threads unwinds from the loom beam, receives the\r\nfilling threads and is wound into a roll of cloth at the front of the\r\nloom. This weave room contains 2000 looms. It is 904 feet long by 180\r\nfeet wide (about four acres) and is the largest single weave room in\r\nthe world. Overhead is the roof, which forms one vast sky-light, being\r\nof what is known as saw-tooth construction. The vertical sides of the\r\nteeth all face due north and are formed of ribbed glass, which affords\r\nthe most perfect light to every section of the room.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COTTON CLOTH FINISHED\r\n\r\nINSPECTING TABLES.\r\n\r\nBefore going to the baling presses every yard of cotton cloth passes\r\nunder the vigilant eyes of the cloth inspectors, who mark as seconds\r\nand lay aside all pieces containing imperfections. This inspection\r\nis not a mere formality, but is conducted most carefully, and this\r\ndepartment is specially located to get the best and most perfect light.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BALING PRESSES.\r\n\r\nThe bolts of finished cloth are now placed in presses and made into\r\nbales of finished cloth and are ready for the market.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shipping platform of the White Oak Mills, Greensboro, N.\r\nC., showing how the bales of finished cloth are handled in shipping.]\r\n\r\n  Pictures herewith by courtesy of White Oak Mills.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Discovered Cotton?\r\n\r\nJust who discovered cotton is not known. The early records are so\r\nincomplete that no individual can be credited with the discovery of\r\nthe value of this wonderful plant. Long before Cæsar’s time, among the\r\nHindoos they had a law that if you stole a piece of cotton you were\r\nfined three times its value. Most of the early nations were familiar\r\nwith cotton--the early Egyptians, Chinese and other ancient people used\r\nit and valued it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Nation Produces the Most Cotton?\r\n\r\nThe United States is the leader in the production of cotton, as in many\r\nother important world products. We produce more than seventy-five per\r\ncent of all the cotton grown in the world. The remainder is practically\r\nall grown by East India, Egypt and Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Cotton Used For?\r\n\r\nThe cotton plant is one of the wonder plants of the world, when you\r\nstop to think how well we could get along without wool or silk or other\r\nfabrics if we had to.\r\n\r\nLittle would be lost to the world so far as actual comfort is concerned\r\nif all of the other fabric-making materials were lost. We would sleep,\r\nas we often do now, in beds the coverings of which were pure cotton,\r\nin a room in which the rugs were woven from cotton, the sun kept out\r\nof the room by cotton window shades. We could still have plenty of\r\ngood soap to wash our bodies and clothing, for much of our soap to-day\r\nis made from cotton-seed oil; then we could use a cotton towel to dry\r\nourselves; and put on a complete outfit of clothing made entirely of\r\ncotton. White cotton table cloths and napkins are not so fine as linen;\r\nthey are good enough for anyone. Your breakfast rolls will taste quite\r\nas well if baked with cottolene instead of lard; the meat for your\r\ndinner would be fed and fattened on cotton-seed meal and hulls as they\r\nare now; you would have butter made from cotton-seed that compares\r\nfavorably with the butter you now have on the table; the tobacco in\r\nyour cigar would continue to be grown under cotton cloth and packed in\r\ncotton bags; armies would still sleep under cotton tents and could use\r\ngun-cotton to destroy the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are the Principal Cotton Cloths?\r\n\r\nThere are a great many different names given to cotton cloths, but\r\nthey may in general be divided into five classes--plain goods, twills,\r\nsateen, fancy cloth and jacquard fabrics. The cotton cloth in each of\r\nthese classes varies and goes by different names. For instance, in\r\nPlain Goods, the different kinds are lawn, nainsook, sheeting, mull,\r\nprint cloth, madras. The difference lies in the number of threads in\r\none inch of width, the fineness and the weave. The Twills have lines\r\nrunning diagonally and are used for linings mostly. The difference\r\nis in the weaving. Denim, largely used for overalls, belongs to the\r\nclass of Twills. Sateen is used for dress linings, dresses and waists.\r\nThen there is the class of Fancy Cloths which is another kind of weave\r\nused largely in children’s clothes, shirt waists, etc., and under\r\nthe name Scrim is fine for draperies and towelling. The other class,\r\nJacquard Fabrics, represents the most complicated form of weaving and\r\nused largely under special individual names or brands for dress goods,\r\nnovelties, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much Cotton Cloth Will a Pound of Cotton Make?\r\n\r\nWhen the cotton is spun into yarn it is no longer sold by the bale, but\r\nby the pound. It is impossible to make an exact statement of the amount\r\nof cotton cloth one pound of cotton yarn will make, because of the\r\ndifference in weaving. It has, however, been figured out that a pound\r\nof cotton yarn should make\r\n\r\n  3¹⁄₂ yards of sheeting, or\r\n  3³⁄₄ yards of muslin, or\r\n  9¹⁄₂ yards of lawn, or\r\n  7¹⁄₂ yards of calico, or\r\n  5¹⁄₂ yards of gingham, or\r\n  57 spools of thread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Picture by courtesy Browne & Howell Co.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOFORI PIANO FROM THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART, NEW YORK CITY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Piano\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Music?\r\n\r\nMusic is one kind of sound. All sounds, whether musical or not, are the\r\nresult of sound waves in the air. They travel almost exactly like the\r\nwaves of the water. They go in circles in all directions at the same\r\nspeed and will go on forever unless they meet something that has the\r\nability to stop them. If you drop a pebble into the exact center of a\r\nbasin of water, you will see the ring of waves produced start from the\r\npoint where the pebble entered the water and travel to the sides of the\r\nvessel, which stop them. Also the pebble as it falls into the water\r\nwill make ring after ring of waves.\r\n\r\nWhen you shout or ring or strike one of the keys of the piano you start\r\na sound wave or a series of them, which you can hear as soon as the\r\nsound wave strikes your ear. When the series of waves is regular the\r\nsound produced is a musical sound, and when the sound waves are not\r\nregular in length we call it some other kind of a sound.\r\n\r\nActing on the knowledge so learned, man has devised numerous\r\ninstruments with which he can produce musical sounds, such as the\r\npiano, phonograph, and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Made the First Piano?\r\n\r\nThe first real piano was made by Bartolomeo Christofori, an Italian.\r\nHe invented the little hammers by the aid of which the strings are\r\nstruck, giving a clear tone instead of the scratching sound which\r\nall the previous instruments produced. It took two thousand years to\r\ndiscover the value of the little hammers in making clearer notes. His\r\nfirst piano was made in 1709. The word by which we call the instrument\r\npianoforte has, however, been traced back as far as 1598, when it is\r\nsaid to have been originated by an Italian named Paliarino. The first\r\npiano made in America was produced by John Behnud, in Philadelphia, in\r\n1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Was the Piano Discovered?\r\n\r\n~THE DISCOVERY OF STRINGED MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS~\r\n\r\nThe piano is a stringed musical instrument. The name pianoforte comes\r\nfrom two Italian words meaning _soft_ and _loud_, and is accurately\r\ndescriptive of the piano because the notes can at will be made soft or\r\nloud. The piano is a development of the simplest form of making regular\r\nsound vibrations by snapping or hammering a string of some kind which\r\nis stretched tight and fastened at both ends. We must go far back into\r\nhistory to find the earliest traces of stringed instruments, and even\r\nthen we do not know where and when they originated, for there seem to\r\nbe no records which help us to trace their origin. We know that the\r\nEgyptians as far back as 525 B.C. had stringed instruments, but we only\r\nknow they had them--not where they got them or who made them. There\r\nis a legend that the Roman god Mercury, while walking along the Nile\r\nafter the river had overflowed its banks and the land had again become\r\ndry, stubbed his toe on the shell of a dead tortoise. He picked it up\r\nto cast it aside and accidentally touched some strings of sinew with\r\nhis finger. These strings were only what remained of the once live\r\ntortoise. At the same time Mercury heard a musical note and, after\r\nvainly trying to find a cause for the musical sound, twanged the string\r\nagain and discovered the music in tightly-stretched strings. He set\r\nabout making an instrument, using the tortoise shell for the sound box\r\nand stretching a number of strings of sinew across it. This is only a\r\nlegend, of course, but if we examine the early musical instruments of\r\nthe Greeks, which was the lyre, we always find the representation of a\r\ntortoise upon it.\r\n\r\nOther nations, such as the early Chinese, the Persians, the Hindus and\r\nthe Hebrews, had stringed instruments much resembling the lyre. In the\r\ntombs of the great rulers of Egypt are found representations of harps,\r\nand one harp which had been buried in one of the tombs for more than\r\n3000 years was actually found to be in good condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picture by courtesy Browne & Howell Co.\r\n\r\nDULCIMER.]\r\n\r\nWherever we search among the records of early nations we find evidence\r\nthat they were familiar with the music obtainable from playing upon\r\nstringed instruments, but we have never been able to discover what\r\npeople or what persons first learned that music could be produced with\r\nsuch instruments.\r\n\r\n~THE FIRST STRINGED MUSICAL INSTRUMENT~\r\n\r\nThe harp was probably the first practical stringed instrument. Its\r\nmusic was produced by picking the strings with the fingers or with a\r\npiece of bone or metal.\r\n\r\nThe next step was the psaltery, which was produced in the Middle Ages.\r\nIt was a box with strings stretched across it and represented the first\r\ncrude attempt at using a sounding board. A larger instrument which came\r\nabout the same time and was very like the psaltery, was the dulcimer.\r\nBoth were played by picking the strings with the finger or a small\r\npiece of bone or other substance.\r\n\r\nThen came the keyboard, first used on stringed instruments in what\r\nis called the _clavicytherium_. This consisted of a box with cat-gut\r\nstrings ranged in a semitriangle. On the end of each key was a quill,\r\nwhich picked the string when the key was operated.\r\n\r\nAfter this came the clavichord. It was built like a small square piano\r\nwithout legs. The strings were made of brass and on the end of each key\r\nwas a wedge-shaped piece of brass which picked the strings. The elder\r\nBach composed his music on the clavichord, his favorite instrument, and\r\nthat is why the music written by Bach is full of soft and melancholy\r\nnotes. The clavichord produced only such notes.\r\n\r\nThe next steps brought the virginal, spinet and harpsichord. The\r\nstrings on all three were of brass with quills at the key ends for\r\npicking the strings. The virginal and spinet were very much alike. The\r\nharpsichord was larger and sometimes was made with two keyboards. These\r\ninstruments had notes covering four octaves only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picture by courtesy Browne & Howell Co.\r\n\r\nCLAVICHORD.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the strings in the harpsichord provided one step\r\nnearer to our piano. It had five octaves of notes and there were at\r\nleast two strings to each note instead of only one, as in previous\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picture by courtesy Browne & Howell Co.\r\n\r\nSPINET.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do We Have Only Seven Octaves On a Piano? Why Not Twelve or More\r\nOctaves?\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the longest key-board of the piano has seven octaves and\r\nthree notes in addition, or 52 notes, not counting the sharps and\r\nflats. An octave you, of course, know consists of the seven notes C D\r\nE F G A B. Every eighth note is a repetition of the one seven notes\r\nbelow or above. The reason that there are no more notes or octaves on\r\nthe piano is that if we extended the key-board either way one or two\r\noctaves more, we should not be able to hear the notes struck on the\r\nkeys. There would be sound produced, or course, but the vibrations\r\nwould be too fine for the human ear to hear. It is said that the range\r\nof the human ear does not go beyond somewhere between eleven and twelve\r\noctaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picture by courtesy Browne & Howell Co.\r\n\r\nUPRIGHT HARPSICHORD.\r\n\r\n(From the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Picture by courtesy Browne & Howell Co.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH’S VIRGINAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE MUSIC GETS INTO THE PIANO\r\n\r\n  Photo by Kohler & Campbell Piano Co.\r\n\r\nPUTTING ON THE SOUNDING BOARD.\r\n\r\nThe first operation in producing the piano is to make a wooden frame\r\nor back on which is attached first the sounding board, then the iron,\r\nharp-shaped frame to which the strings are fastened.\r\n\r\nThe tones of the piano are produced by felt-covered hammers striking\r\nthe strings. The sounding board, which is made of wood, magnifies the\r\ntones.\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the mechanics glueing the sounding board to the\r\nback.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo by Kohler & Campbell Piano Co.\r\n\r\nFASTENING THE STRINGS.\r\n\r\nThe strings are hitched on to pins in the iron frame at its lower end\r\nand fastened at the upper end by a metal pin or peg driven into the\r\nback. The peg is square on top, so that it can be turned with a tuning\r\nhammer or wrench in order to tighten or slacken the strings, which is\r\nthe operation of tuning the piano.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH STRIKE THE PIANO STRINGS\r\n\r\n  Photo by Kohler & Campbell Piano Co.\r\n\r\nBUILDING THE CASE AROUND THE SOUNDING BOARD.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sounding board with its iron frame and strings is\r\ncomplete, the outside case is built up around it, the front being left\r\nopen to receive the action and key-board.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo by Kohler & Campbell Piano Co.\r\n\r\nATTACHING THE LITTLE HAMMERS THAT STRIKE THE STRINGS.\r\n\r\nIn this picture the workmen are placing the action and keys, to which\r\nare attached the little wooden felt-covered hammers, which will strike\r\nthe strings and produce the tones. It took a great many years for our\r\nmusical instrument makers to hit upon the idea of using these little\r\nhammers, and thus make the piano a perfect instrument.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REGULATING THE ACTION OF THE PIANO\r\n\r\n  Photo by Kohler & Campbell Piano Co.\r\n\r\nREGULATING THE ACTION AND KEYBOARD.\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the piano partly assembled and the workmen adjusting\r\neach little black and white key to the proper touch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photo by Kohler & Campbell Piano Co.\r\n\r\nTUNING, POLISHING AND FINISHING.\r\n\r\nThe piano is now complete except for polishing and tuning. The tuning\r\nis left to the last. The tuner must have a good ear for music. With\r\nhis key he tightens or loosens each of the pegs to which the wires are\r\nattached until it is perfectly in tune and all in harmony. The piano is\r\nnow ready to play upon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Sounds Are Produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you look closely at a tuning fork, or a piano string, while it\r\nis sounding, you can see that it is swinging rapidly to and fro, or\r\nvibrating. Touch it with your finger and thus stop its vibration and it\r\nno longer produces sound. The only difference that you can discover in\r\nthe fork or string when sounding and when silent is that when you stop\r\nthe motion it is silent and when it vibrates it makes a sound. From\r\nthis we learn that the sounds are due to the vibrations of sounding\r\nbodies. This has been proven by the examination of so many sounding\r\nbodies that we believe that all sounds are produced by vibrations.\r\n\r\nThe question that next presents itself is, how the vibrations affect\r\nour ears, so as to produce the sensation of hearing. This may be made\r\nclear by a very simple, but striking, experiment. If a bell which has\r\nbeen arranged to be rung by clock-work is suspended under the receiver\r\nof an air pump, and the air pumped out, the sound of the bell will grow\r\nfaint as the quantity of air in the receiver decreases, and finally\r\nwill stop completely. By looking through the glass of the receiver,\r\nhowever, the bell may be seen ringing as vigorously as at first. We\r\nlearn thus that the air around a sounding body plays an important part\r\nin the transmission of the vibrations to our ears. The way in which\r\nthe air acts in transmitting the vibrations is as follows. At each\r\nvibration of the sounding body, it compresses, to a certain degree,\r\na layer of air in front of it. This layer, however, does not remain\r\ncompressed, for air is very elastic, and the compressed air soon\r\nexpands, and in doing so compresses a layer of air just beyond it. This\r\nlayer expands in its turn, and compresses another layer still further\r\nfrom the body. In this way waves of compression are sent through the\r\nair, at each vibration, in all directions from the vibrating body.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that particles of air travel all the way from\r\nthe vibrating body to the ear when a sound is heard. Each particle of\r\nair travels a very short distance, never any further than the vibrating\r\nbody moves in making a vibration, and the movement of the air particles\r\nis a vibratory one, like that of the sounding body. But the particles\r\nof air near the sounding body communicate their vibrations to other\r\nparticles, further from that body, and these, in turn, to others still\r\nfurther away, so, while the particles of air themselves move very short\r\ndistances, the waves produced by their vibrations may be made to travel\r\na considerable distance.\r\n\r\nThe size of a sound wave ordinarily is very small, but sound waves are\r\nsometimes made of such size and strength as to strike our ears with\r\na force sufficient to rupture the ear drum. Such large and forceful\r\nwaves come during explosions, such as the discharges of cannon or the\r\nexplosions of large quantities of gunpowder under any conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Sound?\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been said, you will probably answer that sounds\r\nare waves in the air, which produce the sensation of hearing. This\r\nis correct, but sound is not limited to vibrations of the air. Other\r\nelastic substances can be made to vibrate in the same way, and the\r\nwaves so produced when conveyed to our ears, produce the sensation of\r\nhearing. If you put your ear under water and then strike two stones\r\ntogether in the water you will hear a sound as readily as you would in\r\nair. Sound waves may be transmitted by solid bodies also, and some of\r\nthese are better for this purpose than air or liquids. Perhaps you have\r\ntried the experiment of placing your ear against one of the steel rails\r\non a railroad track to listen for the coming of a distant train. If you\r\nhave tried this, you know that a sound that is too faint, or is made\r\ntoo far away, to be heard through the air, can easily be heard through\r\nthe rail.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that other substances than air can be thrown into\r\nwaves that will affect the sense of hearing, we may define sound as\r\nvibrations in any elastic object, that produces the sensation of\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nThe definition is sometimes called the physical definition of sound,\r\nin contradistinction to the physiological definition of sound which\r\nis given as the sensation produced when vibrations in elastic\r\nsubstances are conveyed to our ears. You will see then that sound when\r\nreferring to the physical definition is what makes sound known in the\r\nphysiological definition. The term sound alone, without qualifications,\r\nmay have either meaning, and therefore statements concerning sound may\r\nbe misleading, unless we are exact in explaining the sense in which the\r\nword is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Fast Does Sound Travel?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a sound is made close to us, it reaches our ears so quickly that\r\nit seems as though it took no time to travel; but when a gun is fired\r\nby a person at a distance, you will notice that after you see the flash\r\nof the gun, a little time elapses before the sound reaches your ear. It\r\ntakes a little time for the light from the flash to get to your eyes,\r\nbut a very short time, which you cannot appreciate. Sound travels much\r\nmore slowly and the time it takes to travel a few hundred yards is\r\nnoticeable. Accurate measurements of the speed of sound have been made,\r\nand it has been found that sound usually travels in air at a speed of\r\nabout eleven hundred feet a second. The speed is not always the same,\r\nhowever, for a number of circumstances may cause it to vary. In air\r\nwhich is heated, the speed at which sound travels in it is increased\r\nbecause hot air expands. At the freezing point, sound travels through\r\nthe air at the rate of 1,091 feet a second, and for every increase\r\nin temperature of one degree of heat, the speed is increased about\r\nthirteen inches a second. Accordingly at 68° F. the speed would be\r\napproximately 1,130 feet a second. Sounds also travel faster in moist\r\nair than in dry.\r\n\r\nIn other gases the speed of sound transmission may be greater or less\r\nthan in air. For example, in hydrogen gas, which is much lighter than\r\nair, sound travels nearly four times as fast as it does in air. On the\r\nother hand, in carbonic acid gas, which is heavier than air, sound is\r\ntransmitted more slowly.\r\n\r\nIn liquids, which are always heavier than air, you would naturally\r\nthink that sound would travel more slowly than in air, but this is not\r\ntrue. Liquids are less compressible than gases and this causes the\r\nspeed with which sound is transmitted in them to be increased. In water\r\nsound travels about four times as fast as in air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are the Properties of Sound?\r\n\r\n\r\nSounds differ from each other by the extent to which they possess three\r\nqualities, namely; intensity, pitch and quality.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of any sound that we hear depends upon the size of\r\nthe waves that reach our ears. The size of a sound wave gradually\r\ndecreases, as the wave travels from its starting point, consequently\r\nthe intensity of a sound depends upon the distance from the point\r\nat which the sound was produced. We know this from experience and\r\nif we think of the matter for a moment we will see why it is so. At\r\nthe start of a sound wave, only a small quantity of air is affected,\r\nbut for every inch it travels the quantity of air to which the wave\r\nis conveyed becomes larger, and the intensity of the waves must grow\r\ncorrespondingly smaller, just as when a pebble is dropped into water,\r\nthe ripples produced by it are highest at the point where the pebble\r\nstruck the water, and grows lower and lower as their circle widens.\r\n\r\nIt has been found possible to measure the intensity of a sound wave,\r\nat different distances from the point from which it started, and from\r\nthese measurements it has been learned that the decrease in the open\r\nair, follows a fixed rule that is stated thus: the intensity of a\r\nsound wave at any point is inversely proportional to the square of\r\nits distance from its starting point. This rule is called “the law\r\nof inverse square,” and it means that if the intensity of a wave be\r\nmeasured at two points, distant say one hundred, and two hundred yards,\r\nrespectively, from the starting point of the sound, the intensity of\r\nthe sound at the first point will be found to be four times as great as\r\nat the second point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Can You Hear More Easily Through a Speaking Tube?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the decrease in intensity of a sound wave as it\r\ntravels through the air, is due to the fact that the quantity of\r\nair set in motion by it is constantly increasing. But, if a wave is\r\nconveyed through a tube containing air, the quantity of air to which\r\nthe vibrations are communicated does not increase as the wave travels\r\nforward, and theoretically there is no decrease in intensity. When a\r\nwave is actually transmitted in this way, however, it is found that\r\nthere is some decrease in intensity on account of the friction of the\r\nparticles of air against the sides of the tube; but the decrease from\r\nthis cause is much slower than that which occurs in the open air, and\r\nconsequently sounds can be heard at much greater distances through\r\ntubes than through the open air. Tubes for speaking purposes are\r\nfrequently used to connect different parts of the same building, and if\r\nthe tubes are not too crooked they serve their purpose very well.\r\n\r\nPitch is that property of sounds that determines whether they are high\r\nor low. The pitch of a sound depends upon the number of vibrations\r\na second which the body that produces it makes. The sound of an\r\nexplosion has no pitch because it makes but one wave in the air. The\r\nsound made by a wagon on a pavement has no definite pitch, for it is\r\na mixture of sounds, in which the number of vibrations per second is\r\nnot the same. Pitch is a property of continuous sounds only, and it is\r\napparent chiefly in musical sounds, by which we mean sounds in which\r\nthe vibrations are continuous and regular. In music, however, pitch\r\nis very important. In a musical instrument, the parts are so arranged\r\nthat the sounds produced can be given any desired pitch, and it is by\r\ncontrolling the pitch that the pleasing effect of musical sounds in\r\nlarge measure is produced. Sounds of low pitch are produced by bodies\r\nmaking but a few vibrations a second while high-pitched sounds are made\r\nby bodies that vibrate rapidly.\r\n\r\nQuality, may be defined as that property of sounds which enable us to\r\ndistinguish the notes produced by different instruments. Two notes,\r\none of which is produced upon a piano, and the other upon a violin,\r\nmay have the same pitch and be equally loud, yet they are easily\r\ndistinguishable. The difference in them is due to the presence of what\r\nare called overtones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Meant By the Length of Sound Waves?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe length of a sound wave embraces the distance from the point of\r\ngreatest compression in one wave to the same point in the next. This\r\ndepends upon the pitch for if a sounding body is making one hundred\r\nvibrations a second, by the time the one hundredth vibration is made,\r\nthe wave from the first vibration will have travelled about eleven\r\nhundred feet from the starting point, and the remaining ninety-eight\r\nwaves will lie between the first and the one hundredth. In consequence\r\nof this, the wave length for that particular sound will be about eleven\r\nfeet. If the sounding body had made eleven hundred vibrations a second\r\nby the time the first wave had travelled eleven hundred feet, there\r\nwould have been eleven hundred waves produced, and the wave length for\r\nthat sound would be one foot. The wave lengths of sounds produced by\r\nthe human voice usually lay between one and eight feet, though some\r\nsingers have produced notes having wave lengths as great as eighteen\r\nfeet, and others have reached notes so high that the wave length was\r\nonly about nine inches.\r\n\r\nWhen a tuning fork is struck, it produces a sound so faint that it can\r\nscarcely be heard unless the fork is held near the ear; but if the end\r\nof the fork is held on a box or table, the sound rings out loudly and\r\nseems to come from the table. The explanation of this is very simple.\r\nWhen only the fork vibrates, it produces very small sound waves,\r\nbecause its prongs are small and cut through the air. But when it is\r\nset on a box or table, its vibrations are communicated to the support,\r\nand the broader surface of the box or table sets a larger mass of air\r\nin vibration, and so amplifies the sound of the fork. When a surface\r\nis used in this way to reinforce the vibrations of a small body, and\r\nthus produce sound waves of greater volume, it is called a sounding\r\nboard. Many musical instruments, like the violin and the piano, owe\r\nthe intensity of their sounds to sounding boards, which reinforce the\r\nvibrations of their strings.\r\n\r\n~WHAT A SOUNDING BOARD DOES~\r\n\r\nColumns of air, like sounding boards, serve to reinforce sound waves.\r\nUnlike sounding boards, however, they do not respond equally well to a\r\nlarge number of different sounds. They respond to one sound only, or\r\nto several widely different ones. This may be shown as follows: Take a\r\nglass tube about sixteen inches long, and two inches in diameter, and\r\nafter thrusting one end of it into a vessel of water, hold a vibrating\r\ntuning fork over the other end. By gradually lowering the tube into the\r\nwater a point will be reached at which the sound becomes very loud, and\r\nas this point is passed the sound gradually dies away again. By raising\r\nthe tube again the sound is again made loud when the tube reaches a\r\ncertain point. This shows that to reinforce sound waves of a certain\r\nvibration frequency, the column of air in the tube must be of certain\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nLet us now see why the waves produced by the tuning fork are reinforced\r\nonly by a column of air of a certain length. When the prongs of the\r\nfork make a vibration, a wave of air is produced which enters the tube,\r\ngoes down to the water, is reflected, and comes back toward the fork.\r\nNow, if the reflected wave reaches the fork at the precise moment when\r\nit has completed one-half of its vibration and is about to begin upon\r\nthe second half, it will strengthen the wave produced by the second\r\nhalf of the vibration; but if the reflected wave reaches the fork\r\nbefore or after the beginning of the second half of the vibration, it\r\nwill not reinforce it. At the downward movement of the lower prong of\r\nthe tuning fork, a wave of compression is sent down into the tube, and\r\nis reflected at the surface of the water. In order to reinforce the\r\nwave produced by the prong when it moves upward, the reflected wave\r\nmust reach the fork just at the time that the prong reaches its normal\r\nposition and before it starts upon the second half of its vibration.\r\n\r\nNot only do columns of air tend to reinforce notes having a certain\r\nrate of vibration, but all elastic bodies have a certain rate at which\r\nthey tend to vibrate, and when sounds having the same rate of vibration\r\nare produced near them, these bodies will vibrate in sympathy with\r\nthem. If the sounds be kept up long enough, the sympathetic vibrations\r\nin objects near them sometimes become so great that they can easily be\r\nseen. Goblets and tumblers made of thin glass show this property very\r\nstrikingly. When the proper notes are sounded the glasses take up the\r\nvibrations, and give a sound of the same pitch. If the note is loud,\r\nand is continued for some time, the vibrations of a glass sometimes\r\nbecome so great that the glass breaks. Large buildings, and bridges\r\nalso, have rates at which they tend to vibrate, and this fact is the\r\nfoundation for the old saying, that a man may fiddle a bridge down, if\r\nhe fiddles long enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusical Instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy musical sounds, are meant sounds that are pleasant to hear, and\r\ntheir combination in such a way that their effect is agreeable\r\nproduces music. Any instrument, therefore, that is capable of producing\r\npleasing sounds may be called a musical instrument, and music is\r\nsometimes produced by very odd devices; but by musical instruments we\r\nordinarily mean instruments that are especially designed to produce\r\nmusical sounds. The number of such instruments that have been invented\r\nis enormous, but all of them may be divided into comparatively few\r\nclasses, only two of which are of much importance. The two classes,\r\nonly two of which are of much importance. The two classes referred to\r\nare stringed instruments and wind instruments.\r\n\r\n~WHAT PITCH IS IN MUSIC~\r\n\r\nStringed musical instruments are those in which the sounds are produced\r\nby the vibration of a number of strings, and are generally reinforced\r\nby a sounding board. The strings are arranged in the instruments in\r\nsuch a way that the pitch of the sound produced by each string shall\r\nbear relation to the pitch of those obtained from the other strings. As\r\nlong as this relation exists, the instrument is said to be in tune, and\r\nwhen the relation is destroyed, the instrument is out of tune, and the\r\nmusic produced by it is apt to contain what we call discords.\r\n\r\nThe conditions that determine the pitch of sounds produced by strings\r\ncan be very easily discovered by experiment. Thus, by taking two pieces\r\nof the same wire, one twice as long as the other, and stretching them\r\nequally, you will observe on striking them that the shorter one yields\r\nthe higher note. If their vibration frequencies are measured it will\r\nbe found that the shorter string has a vibration frequency just twice\r\nas great as that of the longer string. From this we conclude that when\r\ntwo strings of the same size (and material) are stretched equally taut,\r\ntheir vibration frequencies are inversely proportional to their lengths.\r\n\r\nBy now taking two pieces of wire, of the same size and length, and\r\nstretching them so that the tension of one is four times as great as\r\nthat of the other, we shall find that the vibration frequency of the\r\ntighter string is just twice as great as that of the looser. Thus, we\r\nsee that the vibration frequency depends upon the tension applied to a\r\nstring, and, that in strings of the same size and length, the vibration\r\nfrequencies are proportional to the square roots of their tensions.\r\n\r\nNow taking two strings of the same length, but with the diameter of one\r\ntwice as great as that of the other, and stretching them equally, we\r\nshall find that the vibration frequency of the smaller string is twice\r\nthat of the larger; which shows that when the lengths and tensions\r\nof two strings are equal, their vibration frequencies are inversely\r\nproportional to their diameters.\r\n\r\nIn constructing stringed instruments, advantage is taken of each\r\nof these conditions that affect the vibration of strings, and the\r\nrequisite pitch is secured in a string by choosing one of convenient\r\nlength and diameter, and by stretching it to just the right tension.\r\n\r\nWhen a string is plucked in the middle, it vibrates as a whole, and\r\nits rate of vibration, or vibration frequency, is determined by the\r\nthree conditions that have just been discussed; but if a finger is\r\nlaid on the string, in the middle, and the string is plucked between\r\nthe middle and the end, the string will vibrate in halves, and the\r\nmiddle point will remain at rest. If the string had been touched at a\r\npoint one-fourth of the length from the end it would have vibrated in\r\nfourths, and there would have been three stationary points.\r\n\r\nWhen vibrations are set up in a string, with nothing to prevent the\r\nfree vibration of the whole string, it first vibrates as a whole, and\r\nthe sound produced is known as the fundamental tone of the string; but\r\nvery soon smaller vibrations of segments of the string begin, first\r\nof halves of the string, then of thirds, and then of fourths. These\r\nsmaller vibrations produce sound waves that blend with the fundamental\r\ntone and are known as overtones. The combined sound of the fundamental\r\ntone and the overtones is called a note. The overtones present in\r\nnotes that have the same fundamental tone are not the same when the\r\nnotes are produced by different instruments, and, consequently,\r\nthe sound of notes of the same pitch is not the same on different\r\ninstruments. This difference in notes of the same pitch has already\r\nbeen mentioned, but the way in which overtones are produced was not\r\nexplained in connection with it.\r\n\r\nIn wind instruments the sounds are produced by the vibrations of\r\ncolumns of air in pipes. In the organ, which is probably the best\r\nexample of a wind instrument, the vibrations are usually produced by\r\ncausing a current of air to strike a sharp edge, just above the opening\r\nof the pipe, as is done in a common whistle. A portion of the air\r\ncurrent is deflected into the organ pipe, and it sets up vibrations in\r\nthe air within the pipe.\r\n\r\nThe pitch of the sound produced by an organ pipe is determined by the\r\nlength of the pipe. A pipe that is open at both ends, called an open\r\npipe, produces a sound that has a wave length twice as great as the\r\nlength of the pipe; and if the pipe is open at one end only, a closed\r\npipe, the sound produced has a wave length twice the length of the open\r\npipe. Hence it will be seen that a closed pipe produces a sound that\r\nhas the same pitch as that produced by an open pipe that is twice as\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTalking Machines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phonograph, graphophone, gramophone, sonophone, and other talking\r\nmachines, furnish one of the best proofs of the wave theory of sound,\r\nbecause their invention was based upon that theory. The first talking\r\nmachine was that invented by Thomas A. Edison and called by him the\r\nphonograph. The others merely show the principle of the phonograph\r\napplied in different ways, and need not be separately described. The\r\nreasoning that led Edison to invent the phonograph was that if the\r\nsound waves produced by the human voice were allowed to strike a thick\r\ndisk of hard rubber or metal, they would cause the disk to vibrate in\r\na certain way, and if the disk were again made to vibrate as it had\r\ndone under the influence of the voice, the sounds of the voice would be\r\nreproduced. The difficult part of the task of making a talking machine\r\nwas in finding a way to make the disk vibrate again as it did under\r\nthe influence of the voice. This, however, was finally accomplished,\r\nproviding the disk with a needle, that rests on a cylinder of hard\r\nwax, which turns slowly under the point of the needle while the sound\r\nwaves are striking the disk. The vibrations of the disk cause the point\r\nto indent the surface of the wax so as to produce a groove of varying\r\ndepth on its surface. After the vibrations of the speaker’s voice have\r\nbeen recorded in this way on the surface of the wax cylinder the needle\r\ncan be made to retrace its path, and will cause the disk to vibrate as\r\nit did under the tones of the speaker’s voice. These last vibrations of\r\nthe disk produce sound waves similar to those of the voice, but their\r\namplitude is less and the sound is not so loud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Red Make a Bull Angry?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very doubtful if a red flag really makes a bull more excited or\r\nmore quickly than a rag of any other color or any other object which\r\nthe bull can see plainly but does not understand. Conceding for the\r\nmoment that red excites a bull more than any other color, the answer to\r\nthe question will be found in the statement that anything unusual which\r\nthe bull sees has a tendency to make him angry and the thing which he\r\ncan see at a distance more quickly will start him going most quickly.\r\nHe can see a red rag better perhaps than almost any other color. There\r\nmay be something about the color which excites him just as some notes\r\non the piano will worry some dogs, but there is no way of studying the\r\nbull’s anatomy to determine why red should excite him more than any\r\nother color, if that is so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW A KEY TURNS A LOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens When the Knob is Turned?\r\n\r\nAll of that portion of the lock which is shown above the round central\r\npost is operated by the knob, the spindle of which passes through the\r\nsquare hole. Before the knob is turned, the parts are in the position\r\nshown in figure 2, with the latch bolt protruding. Turning the knob to\r\nthe left gives the position shown in figure 1, the upper lever in the\r\nhub pushing back the yoke, which in turn pushes back the latch bolt.\r\nWhen the hand is removed, the springs cause the parts to return to the\r\nposition shown in figure 2. Turning the knob to the right also retracts\r\nthe latch bolt, as shown in figure 3, by means of the lower lever on\r\nthe hub.\r\n\r\nThe spiral spring on the latch bolt is lighter than the one above\r\nit. This gives an easy, lively action to the bolt, with very little\r\nfriction when the door is closed, while the heavier spring above gives\r\na quick and positive action of the knobs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens When the Key is Turned?\r\n\r\nAll of that portion of the lock which is shown below the round central\r\npost is operated by the key. The square stud is attached to the bolt,\r\nand in figure 1, it is seen that the projections on the flat tumblers\r\nprevent the stud from moving forward, holding the bolt in retracted\r\nposition. When the key is turned as shown in figure 2, it raises the\r\ntumblers releasing the stud, and then pushes the bolt out, the tumblers\r\nfalling into position as shown in figure 3, with the projections\r\nagain engaging the stud and preventing the bolt from moving until the\r\nkey is turned backward, again raising the tumblers and releasing and\r\nretracting the bolt.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Key Changes Are Provided.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways in which keys are made individual to the locks\r\nthey fit.\r\n\r\n_a._ By changing the shape of the keyhole. This may be done shorter or\r\nlonger, wide or narrow, straight or tapering and with projections on\r\nthe sides which the key must fit, making it difficult or impossible\r\nfor keys of a different class to enter the lock. In the lock shown, a\r\nprojection on the keyhole will be noted, fitting a groove in the bit of\r\nthe key.\r\n\r\n_b._ By wards attached to the lock-case. The two crescent-shaped wards\r\nseen near the key in figure 2 illustrate this feature. Similar wards\r\nare placed on the lock cover. These fit into the two notches shown on\r\nthe key bit in figure 4, and their shape and position are varied at\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n_c._ By changes in the tumblers. There are five flat tumblers in the\r\nlock shown, and their lower edges fit into the end of the key bit.\r\nBy varying their height, changes in the cutting of the key are made\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe security of a lock depends very largely upon its being so made that\r\nno key will operate it except the one which belongs to it, and this\r\nis obtained by guarding the keyhole by means of _a_, by preventing\r\nthe wrong key from turning by means of _b_, and by still further\r\nlimitations by means of _c_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW A CYLINDER LOCK WORKS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1. PARTS OF CYLINDER LOCK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.\r\n\r\nFACE OF CYLINDER LOCK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cylinder Lock.\r\n\r\nDoor locks of the highest grade of security are made with a locking\r\ncylinder, which contains tumblers in the form of miniature bolts which\r\nmake it impossible to operate the lock except with the key to which it\r\nis fitted. This is screwed into the lock-case through the side of the\r\ndoor, with the lever on the inner end engaging the end of the bolt in\r\nthe lock, so that as it is moved it either retracts or “throws” the\r\nbolt as desired.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 shows all the parts of a modern master-keyed lock. Figure\r\n4 shows a broken view of the cylinder with all parts in position.\r\nFigure 3 shows a simpler form used when the master key is not desired.\r\nFigure 2 shows the front, the only part which is visible when the lock\r\nis in use, with its keyway of tortuous shape which will not admit\r\nflat-picking tools.\r\n\r\nWhen the lock is assembled, the pin tumblers project through the shell,\r\nthe master cylinder and the key plug holding all parts firmly bolted or\r\nfastened together. When the proper key is inserted, the tumblers are\r\nraised until the “breaks” in all of them coincide with the surface of\r\nthe key plug, releasing it and permitting the key to turn it. If any\r\none of the five tumblers is .002 inch too high or too low, the key will\r\nnot turn; so that no key except the one made for the lock can be used.\r\n\r\nIn the master-keyed lock, the master key causes the breaks to coincide\r\nwith the outer surface of the master ring. It is thus possible to\r\nhave a master key which will fit any desired number of locks with the\r\nindividual or change keys all different from each other and from the\r\nmaster key.\r\n\r\nThe balls reduce friction to such an extent that a key has been\r\ninserted and withdrawn for a million times without affecting the\r\naccuracy of the lock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF CYLINDER LOCK WITHOUT MASTER KEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF MASTER-KEYED CYLINDER LOCK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Salt Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nSalt is one of the things with which we come in contact with daily\r\nperhaps more than any other. With the exception of water, probably no\r\none thing is used more by all civilized people than salt.\r\n\r\nYou have already learned in our talk on elements the difference between\r\na mere mixture of substances and a chemical compound. You remember\r\nthat when some substances are only mixed together, they do not lose\r\ntheir identity. In a compound the substances are always combined in\r\nfixed proportions and the properties of the compound are often very\r\ndifferent from those of the things that make it. Common salt is made of\r\ntwo substances, that are not at all like salt, and are very different\r\nfrom each other. One, sodium, is a soft, bluish metal, and the other is\r\nchlorine, a yellowish-green gas. The chemical name for salt is sodium\r\nchloride which is derived from the two names sodium and chlorine.\r\n\r\nSodium and chlorine are both what we have learned to call elements. An\r\nelement being a substance which cannot be separated into substances\r\nof different kinds. There are now known about seventy such elements.\r\nAll the substances around us are composed of these elements alone, or\r\nchemically united in different compounds, or simply mixed together.\r\nMost of them, however, are mixtures, not of separate elements, but of\r\ncompounds. The soil under our feet is a mixture of compounds. Water is\r\nalso a compound. Pure compounds very rarely occur naturally. Salt is\r\nsometimes found almost pure; but generally is mixed with so many other\r\nthings that we have to take them out to get absolutely pure salt. For\r\npractical every-day use it is unnecessary to purify the salt.\r\n\r\nSalt is found in large quantities in the sea water, in which it is\r\ndissolved with some other substances. It is also found in salt beds,\r\nformed by the drying up of old lakes that have no outlets; salt wells,\r\nthat yield strong brine; and salt mines, in which it is found in hard,\r\nsolid, transparent crystals, called rock salt. Rock salt is the purest\r\nform in which salt is found and, to prepare it for market, it is merely\r\nnecessary to grind it or cut into blocks. The greatest deposit of salt\r\nin the world is probably that at Wielizka in Poland, where there is a\r\nbed 500 miles long, 20 miles wide, and 1,200 feet thick. Some of the\r\nmines there are so extensive that it is said some of the miners spend\r\nall their lives in them, never coming to the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nA trip through these mines is interesting. In one of them can be seen\r\na church made entirely of salt. The salt supply of the United States\r\nis obtained chiefly from the salt wells of Michigan and New York, the\r\nGreat Salt Lake in Utah, and the rock-salt mines of Louisiana and\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\nIn the arts and manufactures, the most important uses of salt are\r\nin glazing earthenware, in extracting metals from their ores, in\r\npreserving meats and hides, in fertilizing arid soil, and also, as we\r\nshall presently see, in the manufacture of soda. Of equal importance,\r\nperhaps, is its use in food. Most people think it not only lends a\r\npleasant flavor, but is itself an important article of diet. It is\r\ncertain, that all people who can obtain it use salt in their food, and\r\nwhere it is scarce, it is considered one of the greatest of luxuries.\r\n\r\nSoda is of interest to us, not so much on account of its use in\r\nour households, as because it plays on extremely important part in\r\ntwo industries that contribute greatly to our comfort, viz., the\r\nmanufacture of glass and soap.\r\n\r\nSoda is not found naturally in great abundance, as salt is, but is\r\ngenerally made from other substances. Formerly it was made almost\r\nentirely from the ashes of certain plants. One, known as the Salsoda\r\nsoda-plant, was formerly cultivated in Spain for the soda contained\r\nin it, and the ashes, or Barilla, as they were called, were soaked in\r\nwater to dissolve out the soda. Now, however, the world’s soda supply\r\nis produced from common salt by two processes, known from the names of\r\ntheir inventors as the Leblanc and Solvay processes.\r\n\r\n~WHERE WE GET SODA~\r\n\r\nIn the Leblanc process the first step is to treat the salt, or sodium\r\nchloride, with sulphuric acid. As a result of this, a compound of\r\nsodium, sulphur, and oxygen, called sodium sulphate is formed, together\r\nwith another acid containing hydrogen and chlorine, and called\r\nhydrochloric acid. This acid is driven off by boiling, and the sodium\r\nsulphate is left.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the process is to convert the sodium sulphate, or\r\n“salt cake,” into soda, or, to give it its chemical name, sodium\r\ncarbonate. This change is brought about by mixing the salt cake with\r\nlimestone and coal and heating the mixture. Just what changes go on\r\nwhen this is done, are not known, but the chief ones are probably the\r\nfollowing: the coal, which consists for the most part of an element\r\ncalled carbon, takes the oxygen out of the sodium sulphate, and unites\r\nwith it to form carbonic acid gas, leaving a compound of sodium and\r\nsulphur called sodium sulphide; this acts on the limestone, which is\r\ncomposed of a metal, calcium, in combination with carbon and oxygen,\r\nand causes the sulphur in the sodium sulphide to combine with the\r\ncalcium, forming calcium sulphide, while the sodium combines with the\r\ncarbon and oxygen and forms the desired compound, sodium carbonate.\r\nAfter the heating, the resulting mass which contains calcium sulphide,\r\nsodium carbonate, and some unburned coal, and is known as “black\r\nash,” is broken up and treated with water. This dissolves the sodium\r\ncarbonate, leaving the rest undissolved, and when part of the water is\r\nevaporated crystals containing sodium carbonate and water are formed.\r\nBy heating these the water may be driven off, and the sodium carbonate\r\nleft behind as a white powder.\r\n\r\nThe Solvay, or ammonia soda, process consists in forcing carbonic acid\r\ngas through strong brine, to which a considerable quantity of ammonia\r\nhas been added. When this is done, crystals are formed in the brine,\r\nwhich are composed of a compound of hydrogen, sodium, carbon, and\r\noxygen, and are called sodium bicarbonate. This substance, which is the\r\nsoda we sometimes use in baking bread, is decomposed by heating, into\r\nwater and sodium carbonate, the soda used for washing.\r\n\r\nThe Leblanc process was formerly used almost altogether for making\r\nsoda; but in recent years the Solvay process has come into extensive\r\nuse, and it is said that now more than half the soda of the world is\r\nmade in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Do All the Little Round Stones Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little round stones you are thinking of are really pebbles which\r\nhave been worn smooth and round by being rubbed against each other in\r\nthe water, through the action of the waves on a beach, or the running\r\nwater of brooks and streams. This sort of rock is called a water-formed\r\nrock. Some of them have travelled many miles before they are found\r\nside by side on the shore or in a large mass of what we would call\r\nconglomerate rock. But whenever you see a round smooth rock or pebble\r\nyou may be quite sure that it was made round and smooth by the action\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nYou sometimes see large rocks made of small stones of various colors\r\nand sizes. You can often find a large rock of this kind standing by\r\nitself. If you examine it carefully, you will find it consists of an\r\nimmense number of small stones of different sizes and of a variety of\r\ncolors, all fastened together as though with cement. This kind of rock\r\nis called conglomerate. We know two kinds of conglomerate rock, one,\r\nquite common, in which the little stones are round and smooth, and\r\nanother, not seen so often, in which the stones are sharp. The latter\r\nsort is sometimes called breccia, to distinguish it from the former,\r\nwhich is called true pudding stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Clay?\r\n\r\n\r\nClay is the result of the crumbling of a certain kind of rocks called\r\nfeldspars. When feldspar is exposed to the action of the weather, it\r\ncrumbles slowly at the surface and the little fragments combine with\r\na certain amount of water, forming clay. Pure clay is white and is\r\nused in the manufacture of china and porcelain. The common clay that\r\nwe usually think of when we think of clay, is generally yellowish,\r\nbut there are many different colored clays. Most of these colors,\r\nparticularly those of red clay, yellow clay and blue clay, come from\r\nthe iron which is present in the clay. Clay which contains iron is\r\nuseful for making bricks. Bricks are made from clay by first softening\r\nthe clay and pressing it in molds, the size of a brick. When dried for\r\na time in the sun they are put into an oven and baked in great heat\r\nand they become quite hard and generally red. Most of the clay from\r\nwhich bricks are made turns red when baked, whether blue, yellow or\r\nred, because the iron which is in the clay is generally turned red when\r\nsubjected to heat.\r\n\r\nFor making porcelains it is desirable to use the kinds of clay which\r\ncontain nothing that melts when heated to a high degree. Clays which\r\ncontain substances which melt in strong heat are, therefore, not good\r\nfor making porcelains. There is a pure white clay called Kaolin which\r\nis very excellent for this purpose. Clay out of which we make firebrick\r\nfor lining stoves and fireplaces is free from substances which melt.\r\nSeveral kinds of clay are good for making paints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Do School Slates Come From?\r\n\r\n\r\nSlates such as are used in school and as roofing material are formed of\r\nclay, which has been hardened under pressure and heat. When this occurs\r\nit does so because a number of layers of clay, one on top of the other,\r\nhave at sometime been subjected to great heat and pressure within the\r\nearth with the result that the clay is pressed into very thick layers\r\nand changed in color by the heat and becomes hard. There are many kinds\r\nof slate. Some of the slate, as found in slate mines, is used to make\r\nroofs over buildings and for this purpose they are cut to shapes very\r\nmuch like wooden shingles. They are easily broken, however, as slate is\r\nvery brittle.\r\n\r\nSlate is used in many other ways besides for roofs and school slates.\r\nSometimes it is made into slate pencils but, since paper has become\r\nso cheap, comparatively few slate pencils are used in the school room\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Causes Shadows?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere anything through which rays of light cannot pass intercepts the\r\nlight rays coming from a luminous body, the light rays are turned back\r\nin the direction from which they come and the part on the other side\r\nof the object which intercepted the light goes into shade and a shadow\r\nresults. A shadow then is produced by cutting off one or more light\r\nrays. We notice shadows when the sun is bright in the daytime and at\r\nnight when we walk along the streets lighted partly by street lamps.\r\nThe shadows we see in the daytime are caused by our cutting off and\r\nthrowing back some of the light rays which come from the sun. These are\r\nnot so dark as the shadows we see at night because the rays of light\r\nfrom the sun are so bright and are reflected from so many other objects\r\nto the side and in back of us.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we are walking along a dimly lighted street and come to\r\na street lamp the shadows our bodies cause are quite black. The night\r\nshadows are darker because the source of light is less intense and the\r\nobjects to the side of and in back of us (if we are walking toward the\r\nlight) do not reflect so much of the light rays as they do of the sun’s\r\nrays in the daytime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRIVING THE HOLLOW STEEL PILES TO BED ROCK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Foundation of a Sky Scraper\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Hollow Steel Piles, Compressed and Concrete Are Employed to Make a\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nRapidity of building construction is of primary importance in every\r\ncity of metropolitan size. When real estate is sold at the rate of\r\nseveral hundred dollars a square foot it is self-evident that time is\r\nindeed money. The delay of a few days in completing a structure may\r\ndeprive the owner of the chance of earning thousands in rental money.\r\nBecause of the excessive depth of an open caisson, the completion of\r\na foundation may be delayed for months. Hence the building may not\r\nbe completed until the renting period has passed and the owner must\r\nwait an entire year before he can expect any financial return on his\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nBecause rapidity is so essential in city building construction the\r\nmethod of first sinking an open pit to rock in providing a foundation\r\nhas been displaced to a large extent by a system in which heavy hollow\r\nsteel piles are employed in clusters to support a building. The hollow\r\npiles are driven through quicksand to rock, cleaned out and ultimately\r\nfilled with concrete.\r\n\r\n~PILES ARE DRIVEN DOWN TO SOLID ROCK~\r\n\r\nIn this method of constructing foundations, which is illustrated,\r\nhollow steel piles are driven in the well-known manner down to solid\r\nrock. The steel pile sections vary in length from 20 feet to 22 feet,\r\nand in diameter from 12 inches to 24 inches. If the ground is to be\r\npenetrated to a depth greater than 22 feet, the sections of piling\r\nare connected by means of a sleeve in such manner that a watertight\r\njoint is formed. Under a pressure of 150 pounds to the square inch a\r\njet of compressed air is then employed to blow out the earth and water\r\ncontained within the shell. A spouting geyser of mud rising sometimes\r\nto a height of 150 feet, and occasional large pieces of rock blown\r\nup from a depth of 40 feet below the ground, bear testimony to the\r\nterrific force of the air blast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PILES ARE ABOUT TWENTY-TWO FEET LONG. IF GREAT\r\nDEPTHS ARE TO BE REACHED SECTIONS OF PILING ARE JOINED TOGETHER BY\r\nMEANS OF A SLEEVE.]\r\n\r\nWhen the shell has been completely cleaned out by means of the blast\r\nof compressed air, the exposed rock can be examined by lowering an\r\nelectric light. Steel sounding rods are employed to test the hardness\r\nof the rock and to detect the difference between soft and hard bed\r\nrock. After the piles in each pier have been cleaned out, they must\r\nbe cut off at absolutely the same height--sometimes a very difficult\r\ntask when there is little room. The oxy-acetylene torch is used for\r\nthe purpose, the intensely hot flame cutting off the steel almost like\r\nbutter at the exact elevation desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUTTING STEEL PILES WITH A HOT FLAME\r\n\r\nPILE BEING CUT TO PROPER LEVEL BY MEANS OF OXY-ACETYLENE TORCH.\r\n\r\nAfter the piles in each pier have been cleaned out they must be cut off\r\nat exactly the same height--sometimes a very difficult task when there\r\nis little room. The oxy-acetylene torch is used for the purpose, the\r\nintensely hot flame cutting off the steel almost like butter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CLUSTER OF PILES, CLEANED OUT, FILLED WITH CONCRETE\r\nAND CUT OFF FLUSH BY MEANS OF THE OXY-ACETYLENE FLAME.]\r\n\r\n~PILES ARE NEXT FILLED WITH CONCRETE~\r\n\r\nThe hollow shell is next filled with concrete reinforced by means of\r\nlong two-inch steel rods, sometimes fifty feet in length. On clusters\r\nof these concrete-filled piles, the weight of the building is supported.\r\n\r\nThat this method of constructing foundations is indeed rapid, the\r\nstory of the work at 145-147 West Twenty-eighth Street, New York City,\r\nproves. Rock was located 38 feet below the curb. The material above\r\nit was clay and water-bearing sand. Structural steel was due in three\r\nweeks, but the completion of the cellar was still ten days off. The\r\nsteel pile foundation method offered the only solution of the problem.\r\nSpecifications were drawn which called for eighty-five 12-inch steel\r\npiles, driven to rock, blown clean by compressed air, and filled with\r\nconcrete, reinforced with 2-inch rods. Despite various obstructions on\r\nthe ground (shoring of neighboring buildings and the like) the driving\r\nwas started on June 30th. The excavator was still taking out his runway\r\nwhile the rear half of the lot was completely driven. After he had left\r\nthe ground a compressor was set up, and the first pipe was blown on\r\nJuly 7th. Three days later all driving and cleaning had been completed.\r\nDuring the following two days all the piles were filled and capped. In\r\na word, the entire foundation had been completed three days before the\r\nexpected arrival of the steel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONCRETE PILES WHICH HAVE BEEN SUNK TO ROCK BOTTOM AND\r\nIN WHICH TWO-INCH STEEL RODS HAVE BEEN INSERTED TO ACT AS REINFORCEMENT\r\nFOR THE CONCRETE WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY BE POURED IN.]\r\n\r\nSuch rapid work is not unusual with the steel foundation method.\r\nOn another contract, work was completed not in the three months\r\nstipulated, but in exactly one month and a half, during which brief\r\ntime all the excavation had been done, including sheeting, shoring,\r\npile-driving, the mounting of concrete girders to carry the wall and\r\ncapping of the piles ready to receive the grillage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STEEL PILE IS EASILY FORCED EVEN THROUGH THE SOFT\r\nUPPER LAYERS OF BED ROCK. SOMETIMES VERY LARGE PIECES ARE BLOWN UP INTO\r\nTHE AIR BY THE BLAST OF COMPRESSED AIR.]\r\n\r\nSometimes difficulties are encountered which would prove all but\r\ninsurmountable and certainly hopelessly expensive with other methods.\r\nThus in carrying out the one contract, water was found 12 feet from the\r\ncurb. Two running streams had intersected at that point. The piles were\r\nsimply sunk through the stream to rock bottom without any difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe excessive cost of open-pit work has sometimes made it impossible\r\nto build twelve or fourteen-story buildings in many sections of the\r\ncity of New York. The steel pile has, however, made steel building\r\nconstruction profitable.\r\n\r\nThe carrying capacity of a steel pile is enormous. On a single 12-inch\r\nsteel pile one hundred tons can be safely maintained. Piers containing\r\nsixteen piles have been used, and loadings up to 1300 tons are not\r\nunusual.\r\n\r\nNaturally the question arises: Do the steel piles deteriorate in\r\ntime? The question has been answered over and over again by the piles\r\nthemselves. After a service of fifteen years the steel foundation\r\npiles were removed from the site of a building which now stands at the\r\nnorthwest corner of Wall and Nassau streets, in New York City. They\r\nshowed practically no deterioration. The oxidation on the outside was\r\nalmost negligible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOWING OUT MUD AND ROCK WITH COMPRESSED AIR\r\n\r\nCLEANING OUT A HOLLOW STEEL PILE BY MEANS OF COMPRESSED AIR A GEYSER OF\r\nMUD ALWAYS APPEARS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DRIVEWAY ALONG THE TOP OF THE OLIVE BRIDGE DAM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Glass of Water\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does the Water Get into the Faucet?\r\n\r\nIt is easy for you boys and girls who live in the city to run into the\r\nkitchen or bathroom when you are thirsty and by a simple turn of the\r\nfaucet tap secure a glass of cool and refreshing water, but did you\r\never stop to think how many men must constantly work and how great\r\nand perfect arrangements must be made before it is possible to supply\r\na great city with water to drink, to bathe in, and for cooking and\r\nwashing?\r\n\r\nNo one who has never had the experience of being in a town or city\r\nfrom which the water supply has been cut off, for a day or a number of\r\ndays, can realize how necessary water is in our daily lives. We are so\r\nused to having all the water we want at any time that we even complain\r\nwhen in summer we are asked to drink water which is not iced. Drinking\r\nice-water is very much of a habit. In tropical countries where there is\r\nno ice, people drink the water just as they find it, and if you were to\r\ngo there and drink the waters for a few days, you would soon find that\r\nthe water slakes your thirst even when quite warm, so it is not the ice\r\nin the water that quenches your thirst, but the water itself, and the\r\nice-water is not good for you, as the doctor will tell you, because it\r\nchills the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Our Drinking Water Come from?\r\n\r\nThe best way to find out where the water in the faucet comes from is to\r\nfollow it back to its source. Let us see. Here we are in the kitchen\r\nand you have just had a drink of water taken from the faucet above the\r\nsink. The faucet, you will notice, is attached to a small pipe which\r\nis fastened to the wall back of the sink. We look under the sink and\r\nsee that the pipe goes through a hole in the floor, so we reason that\r\nthe water must come from the cellar. Let us go down cellar and see.\r\nYes, here is the little pipe that comes down through the floor under\r\nthe sink and we follow it along the wall toward the front of the house,\r\nand well, well, there it goes right out through the stone foundation of\r\nthe house. So we conclude that the water comes from somewhere outside\r\nof the house, and that the little pipe we have been following is only\r\na means of getting it from the outside into the house. We now mark the\r\nplace in the wall where the pipe goes through and run around to the\r\nfront of the house to see where it comes out, but we don’t see it. It\r\nmust be buried in the ground, so we get a spade and pick and begin\r\nto dig a hole in the ground, and pretty soon we find the little pipe\r\npointing straight out toward the street. We keep on digging the dirt\r\naway, and thus open a little trench from the house to the middle of\r\nthe street and when we get there after a great deal of digging we find\r\nour little pipe attached to a larger pipe which seems to run along the\r\nground in the middle of the street; so we are still in the dark as to\r\nwhere the water comes from, excepting that so far as our own home is\r\nconcerned we know that it gets into the house through a little pipe\r\nwhich is attached to a big pipe in the middle of the street. By this\r\ntime we know we have a big job on hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW A BIG DAM IS BUILT\r\n\r\nBUILDING OLIVE BRIDGE DAM TO FORM THE ASHOKAN RESERVOIR.\r\n\r\nThe great Ashokan reservoir is situated about fourteen miles west of\r\nKingston on the Hudson River. Its cost is $18,000,000, and it will hold\r\nsufficient water to cover the whole of Manhattan Island to a depth of\r\ntwenty-eight feet. The water is impounded by the Olive Bridge dam,\r\nwhich is built across Esopus Creek, and also by the Beaver Kill and\r\nthe Hurley dikes, which have been built across streams and gaps lying\r\nbetween the hills which surround the reservoir.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLIVE BRIDGE DAM, 4650 FEET LONG, 200 FEET HIGH.\r\n\r\nThe dam is a masonry structure 190 feet in thickness at the base, and\r\n23 feet thick at the top. The surface of the water when the reservoir\r\nis full is 590 feet above tide level. The total length of the main dam\r\nis 4560 feet, and the maximum depth of the water is 190 feet. The area\r\nof the water surface is 12.8 square miles, and in preparing the bottom\r\nit was necessary to remove seven villages, with a total population\r\nof 2000. Forty miles of highway and ten bridges had to be built. In\r\nthe construction of the dam and dikes it was necessary to excavate\r\nnearly 3,000,000 cubic yards of material, and 8,000,000 cubic yards of\r\nembankment and nearly 1,000,000 cubic yards of masonry had to be put in\r\nplace. The maximum number of men employed on the job was 3000.]\r\n\r\n~HOW THE PIPES RUN THROUGH THE STREET~\r\n\r\nWe are pretty tired of digging by this time, so we call in all the boys\r\nand girls in town to help us dig so that we may see where these pipes\r\ncome from, and we have a regular digging carnival. We follow the big\r\npipe along our own street until we come to the corner. Here we find\r\nthat our larger street pipe is connected with a still larger pipe, so\r\nwe think we had better follow the larger pipe. We keep on digging,\r\ngetting more of the boys and girls to help, and we follow that big pipe\r\nright out to the edge of town where we see it runs into another stone\r\nwall which you knew all the time was the reservoir, but concerning what\r\nit was for you were perhaps never quite clear.\r\n\r\nRight near the place where the pipe goes in is a stairway which leads\r\nup to the top of the wall, so the whole crowd of boys and girls climb\r\nthe steps and you are at the top of the reservoir; and there spread out\r\nbefore you, you see a big lake surrounded with a stone wall and you see\r\nwhere the water comes from--the reservoir--at least so you think. But\r\nyou are wrong. You really haven’t come anywhere near the source of the\r\nsupply. For soon as you walk around the broad top of the wall which\r\nsurrounds your reservoir, you meet a man who asks you what you want,\r\nand you tell him that you have been finding out where the water in the\r\nfaucet came from, but having found out you thought you would go back\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe man smiles at you, but, as he is good-natured and sees you are\r\nreally trying to find out where the water comes from, he tells you that\r\nsince you have gone to all the trouble of digging up the streets to\r\nfollow the pipes, you might as well learn all about it.\r\n\r\nHe first tells you that the reservoir is not really the place where the\r\nwater comes from but only a tank, so to speak. He explains to you that\r\nmost of the faucets in the city are higher than the real source of the\r\nwater, which is out in the country miles away, and as water will not\r\nrun up hill, it is necessary to keep the city’s daily supply in some\r\nplace that is higher than the highest faucet in the city, so that it\r\nwill force its way into and fill to the very end all of the large pipes\r\nin the streets and the small pipes which go into the houses, so that\r\nthe water will come out just as soon as you turn the faucet.\r\n\r\nThen he takes you over to a large building near the reservoir which\r\nyou have always called the water works, but never knew exactly what\r\nit was for. He takes you into a large room where there is a lot of\r\nnice-looking machinery working away steadily but quietly, and tells\r\nyou that these are the great pumps which lift the water from the great\r\npipes which bring it from far away in the country, into the reservoir\r\nwe have just seen, from which the water runs into and fills all of the\r\npipes into the city.\r\n\r\nHe also tells you that in some cities it is impossible to find a place\r\nto build a reservoir which is higher than the highest places in the\r\ncity. In such places, the pumps in the water works pump the water\r\ndirect into the city water pipes and force the water to the very end of\r\nall the pipes and keep it there under pressure all the time.\r\n\r\nFrom the pumping station he takes you down stairs in the water works\r\nand shows you the huge pipe which brings the water to the water works\r\nfrom the country. It is quite the largest pipe you ever saw. You see it\r\nis not really an iron pipe, but built of concrete, which is quite as\r\ngood. You will be surprised to have our friend, the water-works man,\r\ntell you that three average-sized men could stand up on each other’s\r\nshoulders inside the great pipe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE BIG PIPES ARE LAID THROUGH THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\nOLIVE BRIDGE DAM; ESOPUS CREEK FLOWING THROUGH TEMPORARY TUNNEL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACING THE 9¹⁄₂ FOOT STEEL PIPES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HUGE UNDERGROUND RIVER\r\n\r\nThe water is conducted from Ashokan reservoir as a huge, underground,\r\nartificial river. The aqueduct is ninety-two miles in length from\r\nAshokan to the northern city line, and it should be explained that it\r\nis built on a gentle grade, and that the water flows through this at\r\na slow and fairly constant speed. The aqueduct contains four distinct\r\ntypes: the cut-and-cover, the grade tunnel, the pressure tunnel,\r\nand the steel-pipe siphon. The cut-and-cover type, which is used on\r\nfifty-five miles of the aqueduct, is of a horseshoe shape and measures\r\n17 feet high by 17 feet 6 inches wide, inside measurements. It is\r\nbuilt of concrete, and on completion it is covered in with an earth\r\nembankment. This type is used wherever the nature of the ground and\r\nthe elevation allow. Where the aqueduct intersects hills or mountains,\r\nit is driven through them in tunnel at the standard grade. There are\r\ntwenty-four of these tunnels, aggregating fourteen miles in length.\r\nThey are horseshoe in shape, 17 feet high by 16 feet 4 inches wide, and\r\nthey are lined with concrete. When the line of the aqueduct encountered\r\ndeep and broad valleys, they were crossed by two methods: if suitable\r\nrock were present, circular tunnels were driven deep within this rock\r\nand lined with concrete. There are seven of these pressure tunnels\r\nof a total length of seventeen miles. Their internal diameter is 14\r\nfeet, and at each end of each tunnel a vertical shaft connects the\r\ntunnel with the grade tunnel above. If the bottom of the valley did\r\nnot offer suitable rock for a rock tunnel, or if there were other\r\nprohibitive reasons, steel siphons were used. These are 9 feet and 11\r\nfeet in diameter. They are lined with two inches of cement mortar and\r\nare imbedded in concrete and covered with an earth embankment. There\r\nare fourteen of these pipe siphons of a total length of six miles. At\r\npresent one pipe suffices to carry the water. Ultimately three will be\r\nrequired for each siphon.]\r\n\r\nOur water-works man sees how earnest you are in seeing just where the\r\nwater comes from, so he proposes that we go find out. We go outside and\r\nthere is an automobile all ready to go and we jump in and the machine\r\nstarts off along quite one of the nicest roads you were ever on. Soon\r\nyou exclaim, “Why, this is the aqueduct road,” and so it is. The great\r\npipe through which the water comes to the city is an aqueduct and they\r\nhave built the road right over the place where the aqueduct runs. Away\r\nwe go as fast as the car can carry us, sometimes ten, or twenty or\r\nperhaps fifty miles, according to what city you are in. The city goes\r\nas far as it must to find a supply of pure water and plenty of it and\r\nspends millions upon millions of dollars to make its supply of water\r\ngood and certain. Occasionally we come to a little stone house along\r\nthe way where we can go down and see the sides of the great stone pipe.\r\nAfter a while, however, we find our aqueduct road comes to an abrupt\r\nstop before another great stone wall. It is the great dam which has\r\nbeen built out there in the country to form one end of a great tank\r\nthat catches and holds the waters from the creeks and rivers that flow\r\ninto it. Usually the dam is built up right across a river. They simply\r\nbuild the dam strong enough to stop the river from going any further.\r\nThen, of course, the water piles up on the other side of the dam and\r\noccasionally this tank, which is simply another huge reservoir, gets so\r\nfull that the water flows over. It does not really overflow the top of\r\nthe dam, because underneath the top the engineers have left openings\r\nhere and there for the water to get through. If it were not for these\r\nloopholes, so to speak, the great wall of water within the reservoir,\r\npiled against the dam, would break down the wall no matter how well\r\nbuilt, by the great pressure it exerts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THROUGH THIS CHAMBER THE FLOW OF WATER TO THE AQUEDUCT\r\nIS REGULATED.]\r\n\r\n~THE REAL SOURCE OF THE WATER~\r\n\r\nWe are now near to the real source of the water. We take a trip around\r\nthe top of the great reservoir. Around at the other end we find what\r\nlooks like a river, excepting that there isn’t any current to speak of.\r\nIt is a river, but a much deeper one than it would have been but for\r\nthe dam which has been built across it, and originally its surface was\r\nquite far down in a valley. Sometimes man makes his water dam at one\r\nend of a lake, which has been formed by streams flowing into a valley\r\nwhich has no opening for the water to run out of. In these cases the\r\nlake will be high up in the hills and man simply builds his dam at one\r\nend, lets the end of his aqueduct into the bottom of the lake and the\r\nwater flows. In other cases he picks out a valley where there is no\r\nlake at all, builds his dam and then drains the water which he finds in\r\nsmall lakes higher up in the hills into the one big valley and makes a\r\nvery large lake. But the water in the lakes comes originally from the\r\ncreeks, rivers or springs which run into it, and so we will follow our\r\noriginal river back into the hills. Here and there along its course we\r\nfind a little stream flowing into our river and, as we go up higher and\r\nhigher into the hills, we find our river getting smaller and smaller.\r\nNow it is only a creek and, if we go far enough, we find its source but\r\nthe tiniest kind of a tinkling brook with the water dripping almost\r\nnoiselessly between the rocks as it makes its path down the side of\r\nthe hill. There is the source of the water in the glass you have just\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIGGING A HOLE UNDER A RIVER\r\n\r\nDIAMOND DRILL BORING A HORIZONTAL HOLE 1100 FEET BELOW THE HUDSON\r\nRIVER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUDSON RIVER SIPHON, 1100 FEET BELOW THE RIVER.\r\n\r\nOf the many siphons constructed, by far the most interesting and\r\ndifficult is that which has been completed beneath the Hudson River.\r\nThe preliminary borings made from scows in the river showed that great\r\ndepths would have to be reached before rock sufficiently solid and\r\nfree from seams was encountered to withstand the enormous hydraulic\r\npressure of the water in the tunnel. After failing to reach rock by the\r\nscow drills, two series of inclined borings were made from each shore,\r\none pair intercepting at about 900 feet depth and the other at about\r\n1500 feet. Both showed satisfactory rock, and accordingly a shaft was\r\nsunk on each shore, to a depth of approximately 1100 feet, and then a\r\nhorizontal tunnel was driven connecting the two. It is of interest to\r\nnote that because of the enormous head, which must be measured from the\r\nflow line far above the river surface, the pressure in the horizontal\r\ntunnel reaches over forty tons per square foot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HIGHEST BUILDING IN THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN\r\n\r\n  SHAFT 752′-0 DEEP\r\n\r\n  WOOLWORTH BUILDING 750′ 0″ HIGH\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the depth to which the pipes which carry the water\r\nthrough the city must sometimes be sunk in order that it will be\r\ncertain to remain in place. To illustrate this in connection with the\r\ndepth of the water tunnel in one place in the city of New York, our\r\nartist has taken the liberty of turning the Woolworth Building upside\r\ndown. Even this building, which is the tallest business building in the\r\nworld, and is 792 feet high, would not penetrate the water tunnel, at\r\nthe point shown, which is at the Clinton Street shaft at the west bank\r\nof the East River.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Carbonic Acid?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was formerly called fixed air, and is a gaseous compound of\r\ncarbon and oxygen. It is procured by the processes of combustion and\r\nrespiration, and hence is always present in the air, though in minute\r\nquantity. Plants live upon it and absorb it into their tissues; they\r\nabstract and assimilate its carbon, and return its oxygen to the\r\natmosphere in a pure condition. It is also present in spring water,\r\nand often in quantities, so that it sparkles and effervesces; it is\r\nalso produced during the processes of putrefaction, fermentation, and\r\nslow decay of animal and vegetable substances in presence of air. It\r\nis largely employed by the manufacturers of aerated bread and aerated\r\nwaters. Under a pressure of about 600 pounds it liquefies, and when\r\nallowed to escape through a small jet it rapidly evaporates and causes\r\nintense cold, so much so as to become frozen. It does not support\r\nburning. The gas derived from it, carbon dioxide, is invisible, and\r\nis heavier than air by one half, and has a pungent odor and slightly\r\nacid taste. In a pure state the gas cannot be respired, as it supports\r\nneither respiration nor combustion. When the portion in the atmosphere\r\nis increased to a considerable extent, as happens sometimes, it\r\nendangers life. The familiar “rising” of bread is brought about by\r\ncarbonic acid gas escaping through and permeating the dough, making\r\nit light and porous. In this form it is known as yeast or as baking\r\npowder. We see its uses also in the chemical fire-engine.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world large quantities of carbonic acid gas are\r\nconstantly issuing from openings of the earth’s surface. Two such\r\nplaces are the famous Poison Valley of Java, and the Grotto del Cane,\r\nnear Naples, in Italy. The former is a small valley about a half a mile\r\naround and about thirty-five feet deep, in which the air is so loaded\r\nwith carbonic acid gas that animals entering it are killed in a few\r\nminutes. Even birds that fly over the valley are overcome if they do\r\nnot rise high above it. The Grotto del Cane, or Grotto of the Dog, is\r\na small cavern in the crater of a volcano. A stream of carbonic acid\r\ngas flows constantly into the grotto, but the level of the gas does not\r\nreach the height of a man’s mouth. When the same air is breathed over\r\nand over again, the quantity of carbonic acid in it is increased so\r\nmuch, that it may become as deadly as the air in the Poison Valley.\r\n\r\nTwo other gases that may generally be found in air are ozone and\r\nammonia. The first is merely a form of oxygen that is produced by the\r\npassage of lightning through the air. After severe thunderstorms, it is\r\nsaid to be present, sometimes, in sufficient proportion to give to the\r\nair a slightly pungent odor. It is more active chemically than is the\r\nordinary form of oxygen, and consequently has a stimulating effect upon\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nAmmonia, or hartshorn, as it is sometimes called, from the fact that\r\nit was formerly obtained by distilling the horns of harts, or deer, is\r\nalmost always present in the air in small quantities. It is produced\r\nchiefly by the decay of animal and vegetable matter, especially the\r\nformer. Though present in the air in very small quantities, it is of\r\nmuch value to the plant world, because it contains nitrogen in a form\r\nin which it can be readily absorbed by plants. All plants contain some\r\nnitrogen, which is essential to their growth, but the greater part of\r\nthe nitrogen in the air is not in such form that it can be absorbed\r\nby them. They must obtain their supply from the soil, which usually\r\ncontains some nitrogen in a form that may be taken up by plants, and\r\nfrom the ammonia in the air. The latter is not taken directly out of\r\nthe air by the plants, but the rains falling through the air absorb the\r\nammonia and carry it to the soil, from which it is taken up into the\r\nplants by their roots.\r\n\r\n~VARIOUS GASES FOUND IN AIR~\r\n\r\nBesides the gases that have been mentioned, there is present in the\r\nair, at all times, a small quantity of water-vapor, which is, in many\r\nways as important to mankind as is the oxygen itself. The quantity\r\nof water in the air is not always the same. As a rule, the quantity\r\nis greater in warm air than in cold, and is less over land than over\r\nwater. Frequently the air feels damp in cold weather, and dry in hot\r\nweather, and it is natural to suppose that there is more vapor in the\r\nair on the damp day than on the dry one. This, however, is not always\r\ntrue. There is usually more moisture in the air on a warm summer day\r\nthan on a cold day in winter, though the winter day may seem much more\r\nmoist. You will be able to understand why this is so by comparing the\r\nair to a sponge. If we fill a sponge with water, and squeeze it gently,\r\na little water will be forced out of it. If we then remove the pressure\r\non the sponge. When the air cools, will appear dry on the surface, but\r\nthere will still be water in it, and on being squeezed harder than\r\nbefore it will again become moist on the surface and more water will be\r\nforced out of it. Now cold has an effect upon moisture-laden air very\r\nmuch like that of pressure on the sponge. When the air cools, some of\r\nthe moisture is forced out of it, and the air seems damp. When it warms\r\nagain, the air seems dry, though there is still water-vapor in it. It\r\nseems dry because it can absorb more water-vapor, just as the sponge\r\nseems dry after you cease to squeeze it, though it still contains\r\nwater. From this we see that the air does not always seem moist when\r\nthere is much water-vapor in it, nor dry when there is only a little.\r\nIt feels moist when there is as much water-vapor present as it can\r\nhold, and dry when it can held more than it already has. And we also\r\nsee that in hot weather the air can hold much more moisture than it can\r\nin cold weather, so that whether the air feels dry or moist, there is\r\ngenerally much more water-vapor in it in hot weather than in cold.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that, over water, the air naturally takes up more\r\nmoisture than over land, because there is so much more water there to\r\nbe transformed into vapor. Over the surface of seas, lakes and rivers,\r\nwater is continually being converted into vapor by the process of\r\nevaporation, and this vapor is absorbed by the air.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the solid particles floating in the air, the dust\r\nthat is seen dancing in the path of a sunbeam. Whenever we examine the\r\nair, these small particles are found, even on the tops of mountains,\r\nand at points so high above the earth that they have been reached only\r\nby balloons. Of course, there is very much less dust high above the\r\nearth than near the surface, where the winds are constantly stirring\r\nup the loose soil, and throwing into the air small particles of every\r\nkind. In cities, where factory chimneys are continually pouring out\r\nclouds of smoke, and the people and vehicles are constantly disturbing\r\nthe dust of the streets, the air always contains more dust than does\r\nthe air of the country.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may breathe air, the oxygen in it has been mixed with\r\nfour times as much nitrogen and argon, which must be inhaled with the\r\noxygen, though they have no more effect on the body than the water\r\nyou take with a strong medicine to weaken it. The oxygen, however,\r\nhas a very important effect upon the body, and if we compare the air\r\nwe exhale with that we inhale we find considerably less oxygen in\r\nthe former than in the latter. In place of the oxygen, the air has\r\nreceived carbonic acid gas. It may seem very strange to say that there\r\nis burning going on in the body, but that is very nearly what takes\r\nplace. The chief difference from coal-burning is that in the body the\r\nprocess goes on so slowly that it does not make the body very hot;\r\nbut when we set fire to coal, the process is much more rapid, and a\r\nlarge amount of heat is produced in a short time, so that the coal\r\nbecomes very hot. The products of breathing and of coal-burning are the\r\nsame, carbonic acid gas being the chief one. When coal is burned it\r\ndisappears, together with some of the oxygen of the air, and in their\r\nstead we have carbonic acid gas. When a breath is taken some of the\r\nmaterial of the body disappears, as does some of the oxygen of the air,\r\nand in place of them carbonic acid gas is found. If we could weigh the\r\ncoal burned and the oxygen that disappears in the burning of it, and\r\ncould then weigh the carbonic acid gas that is produced in the burning,\r\nwe should find that the latter weighs just as much as the coal and the\r\noxygen together. So, too, if we could weigh the oxygen that disappears\r\nfrom the air we breathe, and also find the weight of the material taken\r\nfrom our bodies by breathing, we should find that the two together\r\nweigh just as much as the carbonic acid gas given off in our breath. In\r\nneither case is anything absolutely destroyed; the substances resulting\r\nfrom the change weigh just as much as those that took part in it.\r\n\r\nHaving learned that a quantity of oxygen disappears every time we\r\ntake a breath, every time we build a fire, it would seem that in the\r\nthousands of years during which men and animals have been living on the\r\nearth, all the oxygen would have been exhausted and nothing left in\r\nits place but carbonic acid gas. That, however, is impossible, as the\r\ncarbonic acid gas is used up almost as fast as it is produced and the\r\noxygen is returned to the air in its stead.\r\n\r\n~HOW PLANTS EAT CARBONIC ACID~\r\n\r\nAll trees and plants, from the great redwood trees of California to the\r\nsmallest flowers that dot the fields, need carbonic acid gas to keep\r\nthem alive and to make them grow. Their leaves have the power when the\r\nsun shines on them to take up carbonic acid from the air and to return\r\noxygen in exchange. In this way you see that the balance is kept just\r\nas it should be. The oxygen needed by animals of all kinds is furnished\r\nby the plants, and the carbonic acid required by plants is thrown off\r\nin the breath of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs It a Fact that the Sun Revolves On Its Axis?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a proved fact that the sun revolves on its axis. All parts of its\r\nsurface, however, do not rotate with the same velocity. The rotation of\r\nthe sun differs from that of the earth in this respect.\r\n\r\nThis constitutes the visible proof that the physical state of the sun\r\nis different from the earth’s, although they are composed of similar\r\nchemical elements.\r\n\r\nThe earth, being covered with a solid crust, and being also, as recent\r\ninvestigation demonstrates, as rigid as steel throughout its entire\r\nglobe, rotates with one and the same angular velocity from the equator\r\nto the poles.\r\n\r\nIf you stood on the earth’s equator you would be carried by its daily\r\nrotation round a circle about 25,000 miles in circumference. If you\r\nstood within a yard of the North or South Pole you would be carried, by\r\nthe same motion, round a circle not quite 19 feet in circumference. And\r\nyet it would require precisely the same time, viz., twenty-four hours,\r\nto describe the 19-foot circle as the 25,000-mile one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is the Most Usefully Valuable Metal?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were guessing you would naturally say that gold is, of course,\r\nthe most valuable of the metals. But you would be wrong. The proper\r\nanswer to this is iron. We do not mean the pound for pound value, for\r\nyou could get much more money for a pound of gold than for a pound\r\nof iron, but we mean in useful value--iron is in that sense the most\r\nvaluable metal known to man. This is so because iron is of great\r\nservice to man in so many different ways, and it is very well that\r\nthere is so great a quantity of it for man’s use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE DOES TOBACCO COME FROM?\r\n\r\nGROWING TOBACCO UNDER CHEESECLOTH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Pipe and Cigar[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] Copyright by Tobacco Leaf Publishing Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Did the Name Tobacco Originate?\r\n\r\nIt is now generally agreed that the word tobacco is derived from\r\n“tobago,” which was an Indian pipe. The tobago was Y-shaped, and\r\nusually consisted of a hollow, forked reed, the two prongs of which\r\nwere fitted into the nostrils, the smoke being drawn from tobacco\r\nplaced in the end of the stem. The island of Tobago, contrary to the\r\nbelief of many, did not furnish the name for tobacco, but on the other\r\nhand, it was given that name by Columbus, owing to its resemblance in\r\nshape to the Indian pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Was Tobacco Discovered?\r\n\r\nWhile tobacco is now found growing in all inhabited countries, it is a\r\nnative of the Americas and adjacent islands. Its discovery by civilized\r\nman was coincident with the discovery of this continent by Christopher\r\nColumbus in 1492. Columbus and his adventurous sailors found the\r\nnative Indians using the weed on the explorer’s first visit to the new\r\nworld. Investigation has established that the plant was first used\r\nas a religious rite and gradually became a social habit among the\r\nnatives. Columbus and his Castilian successors carried the weed to\r\nSpain. Sir Walter Raleigh took it to England, Jean Nicot, whose name\r\nis immortalized in nicotine, introduced it to the French; adventurous\r\ntraders brought the seed to Turkey and Syria, and Spanish argosies\r\ncarried it westward from Mexico to the Philippines and thence to China\r\nand Japan. Thus within two centuries after its discovery tobacco was\r\nbeing cultivated in nearly every country and was being used by every\r\nrace of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Tobacco Grow?\r\n\r\nWhile tobacco is a native of the Americas, it is a fact that it will\r\ngrow after a fashion almost anywhere. Milton Whitney, Chief of the\r\nDivision of Soils, United States Department of Agriculture, in his\r\nbulletin on tobacco soils says tobacco can be grown in nearly all\r\nparts of the country even where wheat and corn cannot economically\r\nbe grown. The plant readily adapts itself to the great range of\r\nclimatic conditions, will grow on nearly all kinds of soil and has\r\na comparatively short season of growth. But while it can be so\r\nuniversally grown, the flavor and quality of the leaf are greatly\r\ninfluenced by the conditions of climate and soil. The industry has\r\nbeen very highly specialized and there is only demand now for tobacco\r\npossessing certain qualities adapted to certain specific purposes....\r\nIt is a curious and interesting fact that tobacco suitable for our\r\ndomestic cigars, is raised in Sumatra, Cuba and Florida, and then\r\npassing over our middle tobacco States the cigar type is found again\r\nin Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin....\r\nIt is surprising to find so little difference in the meteorological\r\nrecord for these several places during the crop season. There does not\r\nseem to be sufficient difference to explain the distribution of the\r\ndifferent classes of tobacco, and yet this distribution is probably\r\ndue mainly to climatic conditions.... The plant is far more sensitive\r\nto these meteorological conditions than are our instruments. Even in\r\nsuch a famous tobacco region as Cuba, tobacco of good quality cannot\r\nbe grown in the immediate vicinity of the ocean or in certain parts\r\nof the island that would otherwise be considered good tobacco lands.\r\nThis has been experienced also in Sumatra and in our own country, but\r\nthe influences are too subtle to be detected by our meteorological\r\ninstruments.... Under good climatic conditions, the class and type\r\nof tobacco depend upon the character of the soil, especially on the\r\nphysical character of the soil upon which it is grown, while the grade\r\nis dependent largely upon the cultivation and curing of the crop.\r\nDifferent types of tobacco are grown on widely different soils all the\r\nway from the coarse sandy lands of the Pine Barrens, to the heavy,\r\nclay, limestone, corn and wheat lands. The best soil for one kind of\r\ntobacco, therefore, may be almost worthless for the staple agricultural\r\ncrops, while the best for another type of tobacco may be the richest\r\nand most productive soil of any that we have.\r\n\r\n~WHERE HAVANA TOBACCO IS GROWN~\r\n\r\nHavana tobacco, which means all tobacco grown on the island of Cuba,\r\npossesses peculiar qualities which make it the finest tobacco in the\r\nworld for cigar purposes. The island produces from 350,000 to 500,000\r\nbales annually, of which 150,000 to 250,000 bales come to the United\r\nStates for use in American cigar factories. The best quality of the\r\nCuban tobacco comes largely from the Vuelta Abajo section, although\r\nsome very choice tobaccos are raised also in the Partidos section.\r\nRemedios tobaccos are more heavily bodied than others and are used\r\nalmost exclusively for blending with our domestic tobaccos. While there\r\nare innumerable sub-classifications, such as Semi-Vueltas, Remates,\r\nTumbadero, etc., the three general divisions named above, Vuelta\r\nAbajo, Partidos and Remedios, embrace the entire island. If a fourth\r\ngeneral classification were to be added, it would be Semi-Vueltas.\r\nThe Vuelta Abajo is grown in the Province of Pinar del Rio, located\r\nat the western end of the island. It is raised practically throughout\r\nthe entire province. Semi-Vueltas are also grown in Pinar del Rio, but\r\nthe trade draws a line between them and the genuine Vueltas. Partidos\r\ntobacco, which is grown principally in the Province of Havana, differs\r\nfrom the Vuelta Abajo in that it is of a much lighter quality. The\r\nPartidos country is famous for its production of fine light glossy\r\nwrappers. Tobacco from the foregoing sections is used principally in\r\nthe manufacture of clear Havana cigars. Some of the heavier Vueltas,\r\nhowever, are also used for seed and Havana cigar purposes. Remedios,\r\notherwise known as Vuelta-Arriba, is grown in the Province of Santa\r\nClara, located in the center of the island. This tobacco is taken\r\nalmost entirely by the United States and Europe and is used here for\r\nfiller purposes, principally in seed and Havana cigars. Its general\r\ncharacteristics are a high flavor and rather heavy body, which make it\r\nespecially suitable for blending with our domestic tobaccos. Havana\r\ntobacco is packed and marketed in bales.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparing the Seed Beds.\r\n\r\nThe first step is the preparation of the seed beds. For these beds\r\nlow, rich, hardwood lands are selected. The trees are cut down and the\r\nwood split, converted into cord wood and piled up to dry. About the\r\nmiddle of January this wood is stacked up on skid poles and ignited.\r\nThe ground is thus cleared by burning, the fires being moved from spot\r\nto spot until a sufficient area is cleared. By this process all grass,\r\nweeds, brush and insects are eradicated. The ground is then dug up with\r\nhoes and cleared off and a perfect seed bed is made.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco seed is first mixed with dry ashes in the proportion of\r\nabout a tablespoonful of seed to a gallon of the ashes, and about this\r\nquantity is sowed over a square rod of land. This amount is calculated\r\nto supply plants enough for one acre of ground, but the farmers usually\r\ndouble the planting as a precaution against emergencies. After the seed\r\nbeds are sowed they are covered over with cheesecloth as a means of\r\nprotection, and they are carefully weeded and watered until the leaves\r\nhave attained a length of about four inches. They are then ready for\r\ntransplanting, which operation begins about the middle of April.\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilization.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the tobacco-growing areas have been prepared by\r\nplowing and fertilizing. The matter of fertilization has been the\r\nsubject of much study and many experiments, and it has been definitely\r\nestablished that cow manure is one of the best for this purpose.\r\nThis natural fertilizer is distributed on the fields at the rate of\r\nten to twenty two-horse loads to each acre. In addition to this from\r\ntwo hundred to three hundred pounds of carbonate of potash, and from\r\ntwo thousand to three thousand pounds of bright cottonseed meal are\r\nemployed. The total cost of this fertilizer amounts to about $120 per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting.\r\n\r\nAfter the fertilizer is well plowed into the land the ground is laid\r\noff into ridges about four feet apart, made by throwing two one-horse\r\nfurrows together. These ridges are about two feet in width and are\r\nflattened on the top so as to make a level bed for the young plant. The\r\nfarmer then measures off and marks these rows at intervals of 16 to 18\r\ninches. At each mark he makes a small hole, and after pouring in a pint\r\nof water the plant is carefully set. Machine planters are used for this\r\npurpose to a limited extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCare of the Growing Crop.\r\n\r\nThe growers usually calculate on finishing their planting about the\r\nfirst of June. The young plants are then closely watched and are hoed\r\nand cultivated at least once a week. They are also supplied with\r\nsufficient water to keep them alive and growing. At this stage of the\r\nproceedings, the planter begins to look out for worms. The butter worm\r\nis one of his greatest enemies. This is a small green moth that lays\r\nits eggs in the bud of the plant and turns into a worm two days later.\r\nTo stop the ravages of this insect, it is customary to use a mixture\r\ncomposed of some insecticide mixed with corn meal. A small pinch of\r\nthis mixture is inserted at regular intervals in the bud of each plant\r\nuntil the plant is nearly grown.\r\n\r\nWhen the tobacco is about three feet high, all such leaves as were on\r\nthe plant when it was first set out are picked off and thrown away.\r\nAbout this time the crop is usually threatened by another enemy known\r\nas the horn worm. This is a large, mouse-colored moth, which swarms\r\nover the field about sun-down, and deposits green eggs about the size\r\nof a very small bird shot, on the back sides of the leaves. This is a\r\nvery ravenous insect and unless carefully watched it will devour every\r\nleaf of tobacco, leaving nothing but the stalks standing. It is removed\r\nby picking off and by insecticides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FIELD OF FINE HAVANA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvesting.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty to ninety days after setting, the bottom leaves on the\r\nplant are ripe and the grower is able to remove from three to four\r\non each stalk. This is called priming. The primer detaches each leaf\r\ncarefully and places it face down in his left hand, inspecting it at\r\nthe same time to see that no worms are carried to the barns. Upon\r\naccumulating a handful, he places them in baskets that are lined with\r\nburlap to prevent injury to the leaf, and the filled baskets are either\r\ncarried or hauled to the barns.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the plants have begun to bud out at the top, and\r\nthis bud, with a few small leaves around it, is broken off. This\r\nprocess is called topping, and is done for the purpose of confining\r\nthe development of the plant to the leaves below. After topping, the\r\npriming of the tobacco is continued for about three weeks, and until\r\nall the upper leaves of marketable value have been harvested. In the\r\nmeantime, the suckering has to be looked after, which is the removing\r\nof the small branches that have a tendency to grow out of the main\r\nstalk of the plant.\r\n\r\nIn the barns the leaves are placed on long tables, behind which stand\r\nthe stringers. They string the leaves, each separately, on strong\r\ncotton twine, about thirty leaves to a string, spaced about an inch\r\napart. If this is not done carefully and accurately, several leaves may\r\nbecome bunched together and the cure will thereby be impaired. It is\r\nattention to this detail which prevents the defect known as pole-sweat.\r\nThese strings are tied at either end to a tobacco lath, and the lath is\r\nhung upon two poles. These poles are placed in courses in the barn, at\r\nspaces of two feet, one above the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MODERN CUBAN TOBACCO PLANTATION.]\r\n\r\n~HOW TOBACCO IS CURED~\r\n\r\nHere the tobacco undergoes its preliminary, or barn cure, and during\r\nthis period the grower is constantly on the anxious seat, having to\r\nopen and close his curing houses according to the changes in the\r\nweather, and to look closely after the ventilation of his crop in order\r\nto avoid the development of stem rot and other afflictions with which\r\nthe tobacco is threatened at this stage of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STAND OF TOBACCO IN EACH HAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBulk Sweating.\r\n\r\nIn due course of time the laths are taken down, the strings removed and\r\nthe leaves are formed into hands and tied with a string. The tobacco is\r\nthen packed temporarily in cases and delivered at the fermenting house,\r\nwhere it is put into what is known as the bulk sweat. This consists\r\nof uniform piles of tobacco covered over with blankets, and which are\r\nfrequently “turned” in order that they shall cure evenly and not become\r\ntoo dark in color. From the bulk sweat the tobacco goes to the sorting\r\ntables, where it is divided into numerous grades of length and color.\r\nIt is then turned over to the packers, who form it into bales.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is Tobacco Cultivated?\r\n\r\nAs the young plants spring up and begin to grow, they are thinned out,\r\nwatered and cared for until along in October or November, and as soon\r\nas the weather becomes settled for the season, the little seedlings\r\nare transplanted into the field. Some growers use shade, but most of\r\nthe tobacco is grown in the open. The plants are placed in rows, very\r\nmuch as corn is planted, only farther apart. The plants are carefully\r\nprotected from weeds and insects, and in December the early tobacco is\r\nready to be harvested. Here the mode of procedure differs according\r\nto the discretion of the grower. The plan universally in vogue until\r\nrecent years was to cut the plant down at the base of the stalk.\r\nLately, however, the more scientific growers harvest their tobacco\r\ngradually, picking it leaf by leaf, according as they ripen and mature.\r\nThe tobacco is then allowed to lie in the field until the leaves are\r\nwilted. The stalks (or stems, according to the method followed) are\r\nthen strung on _cujes_ or poles, so that the plants hang with the tips\r\ndown. The tobacco is then allowed to hang in the sun until it is dry\r\nand later carried into the barns, where the poles are suspended in\r\ntiers until the barn is full. Tobacco barns everywhere are constructed\r\nwith movable, or rather, adjustable, side and end walls which permit of\r\na constant adjustment of the ventilation. While hanging in the barn the\r\ntobacco undergoes its preliminary cure and changes in color from the\r\ngreen of the growing plant to a yellowish brown. The climatic changes\r\nhave to be carefully studied during this process. If the weather is\r\nextremely dry it is customary to keep the barns closed in the daytime\r\nand to open the ventilators at night. It is generally desirable to\r\nkeep the tobacco fairly dry while it is undergoing the barn cure. After\r\na few weeks, and when the hanging tobacco has reached the proper stage\r\nof maturity, a period of damp weather is looked for so that the dry\r\nleaves may be rehandled without injury. When the desired shower comes\r\nalong the tobacco is stripped off the poles and placed in _pilon_--that\r\nis, in heaps, or piles, on the floors of the barns and warehouses, each\r\npile being covered with blankets. Here, being in a compact mass, it\r\nundergoes the _calentura_, or fever, by which it is pretty thoroughly\r\ncured, the color changing to a deeper brown. After about two weeks in\r\nthe piles it is sorted, tied into small bundles or carrots, and these\r\nin turn are packed in bales. After being baled the tobacco, if allowed\r\nto remain undisturbed, undergoes a third cure, by which it is greatly\r\nimproved in quality. It is then ready for the factory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TOBACCO BARN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shade-growing Method.\r\n\r\nThe shade-growing method is one of the institutions of modern tobacco\r\ncultivation. The principle is this: The sun, shining on the tobacco\r\nplants, draws the nutrition from the earth, and the plant ripens\r\nquickly, the leaves having a tendency to be heavy-bodied and not very\r\nlarge. To defeat these results and produce large, thin, silky leaves\r\nfor cigar-wrapper purposes, the grower sometimes covers his field with\r\na tent of cheesecloth or with a lattice-work of lathing which protects\r\nthe growing tobacco from the direct rays of the sun. Thus the ripening\r\nprocess is slower, causing the leaves to grow larger and thinner and\r\nless gummy; and being thinner and less gummy, they are of a lighter\r\ncolor when finally cured. This method is employed by some growers in\r\ncigar-leaf districts, such as Cuba, Florida and Connecticut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKING TOBACCO FROM BALES]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Are Cigars Made?\r\n\r\nWhile many labor-saving devices have been introduced in all branches\r\nof tobacco manufacture, it is a curious fact that in the production\r\nof the best grade of cigars, namely, the clear Havana, the work is\r\ndone entirely by hand. In fact, it may be said that in the process of\r\nmanufacturing fine cigars exactly the same principles are followed\r\nas those of two centuries ago. There has been much improvement in\r\nthe artisanship of the worker, of course, but no rudimentary change\r\nin method. In the manufacture of snuff, chewing and pipe tobacco,\r\ncigarettes and all-tobacco cigarettes, machinery plays an important\r\npart; and mechanical devices are also used extensively in the\r\nproduction of five-cent cigars and in the still higher priced grades\r\nof part-domestic cigars, such as the seed and Havana. Some of these\r\nappliances are almost human in their ingenuity. But in fashioning the\r\ntobacco of Cuba into cigars that are perfect in shape, in formation\r\nand in all the qualities that go to make a good cigar, there is no\r\nsubstitute for the human hand.\r\n\r\nUpon opening a bale of tobacco the workman takes each carrot out\r\nseparately, shakes it gently to separate the leaves, and then moistens\r\nit, either by dipping it into a tub of water from which it is quickly\r\nremoved and shaken to throw off the surplus water or else by spraying\r\nit with a blower. It is left in this condition over night, so that the\r\nleaves may absorb the moisture and become uniformly damp and pliable.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco is then turned over to the strippers, who remove the midrib\r\nfrom each leaf, at the same time separating the wrapper from the\r\nfiller. From this point on the treatment of the wrappers and fillers is\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe half leaves suitable for fillers are spread out and placed one\r\non top of the other, making what are called books. These books are\r\nplaced side by side, closely together, on a board, and a similar board\r\nis placed on top of the tobacco to hold it in position. Later, it is\r\npacked into barrels, the tops of which are covered with burlap, and\r\nthere it undergoes a fermentation. It is usually allowed to remain in\r\nthis condition for ten days or two weeks, when it is rehandled and\r\ninspected, and if found to be in the right condition, it is placed on\r\nracks, where it remains until it is in just the proper state of dryness\r\nto be ready for working.\r\n\r\n~THE GREAT CARE NECESSARY IN SELECTION~\r\n\r\nThe wrapper leaves, after leaving the hands of the stripper, are taken\r\nby the wrapper selector, who sits, usually, at a barrel, and spreads\r\nout each leaf, one on top of the other, over the edge of the barrel,\r\nassorting them as to size, color, etc., into several different piles or\r\nbooks. Each of these piles is divided into packs of twenty-five each,\r\nand each lot of twenty-five is folded over into what is called a “pad”\r\nand tied with a stem. It is in this form that they go to the cigarmaker.\r\n\r\nEvery morning the stock is distributed among the cigarmakers. Each\r\nworkman is given enough tobacco to make a certain number of cigars,\r\nand when his work is finished he must return either the full number of\r\ncigars or the equivalent in unused leaves.\r\n\r\nThe tools of the cigarmaker consist merely of a square piece of\r\nhardwood board, a knife and a pot of gum tragacanth. He sits at a\r\ntable upon which rests the board, and at which there is also a gauge\r\non which the different lengths are indicated. Fastened to the front\r\nof each table is a sack or pocket of burlap into which the cuttings\r\nthat accumulate on the table are brushed. The operator deftly cuts his\r\nwrapper from the leaf, fashions the filler into proper form and size\r\nin the palm of his hand (this is known as the “bunch”) and rolls the\r\ntobacco into cigar form, In winding the wrapper around the “bunch” the\r\noperator begins at the “lighting end” of the cigar, called the “tuck,”\r\nand finishes at the end that goes into the mouth, which is called the\r\n“head.” A bit of gum tragacanth is used to fasten the leaf securely at\r\nthe “head.” The cigar is then held to the gauge and is trimmed smoothly\r\noff to the proper length by a stroke of the knife at the “tuck.” The\r\ncigars are taken up in bundles of fifty each. They next pass into\r\nthe hands of the selectors, who separate them into different piles,\r\naccording to the color of the wrappers, and who also reject any cigars\r\nthat may be of faulty construction. Broken wrappers, bad colors or any\r\nother defects are sufficient to cause the rejection of a cigar. The\r\nrejected cigars are known as _resagos_ (“throwouts”) or _secundos_.\r\n\r\nFrom the selectors the cigars go to the packers, whose duty it is to\r\nplace them in the boxes, and to see that the colors in each box are\r\nuniform, marking the temporary color classification on each box in lead\r\npencil. After being packed, the filled boxes are put into a press and\r\nso left for twelve hours or until the cigars conform somewhat to the\r\nshape of the box which contains them. On being removed from the press,\r\nif to be banded, the cigars are carefully removed in layers from the\r\nbox, the bands affixed, and the cigars replaced. The goods are then\r\nplaced in an air-tight vault to await shipment.\r\n\r\nWhen the cigarmaker ties up his bundle of fifty cigars, he attaches to\r\nit a slip of paper upon which is marked his number. This enables the\r\nmanufacturer to keep an accurate account of the number of cigars made\r\nby each workman and also to place the responsibility for any defects in\r\nthe workmanship. Cigarmakers are paid by the piece, the scale of wages\r\nranging from $16 to $100 per thousand. In nearly every factory there\r\nmay be found advanced apprentices or old men working at the rate of\r\n$14 per thousand and also there may be found skilled artisans making\r\nexceptionally large odd sizes at more than $100 per thousand, but these\r\nare not generally considered in the regulation scale of prices. In\r\naverages, the workmen earn about $18 a week and make about 150 cigars a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a Few Figures About Tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe internal revenue from tobacco for one year would build fourteen\r\nbattleships of the first-class; or it would pay the salary of the\r\nPresident of the United States for nearly a thousand years. It would\r\npay the interest on the public debt for three years, and there would be\r\nenough left over to add a dollar to the account of every savings bank\r\ndepositor in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe money spent by smokers for cigars only, _not counting_ cigarettes,\r\nsmoking and chewing tobacco and snuff would more than pay for the\r\nbuilding of the Panama Canal, besides taking care of the $50,000,000\r\npaid to the new French Canal Co., and the Republic of Panama for\r\nproperty and franchises. And in addition to this it would cover the\r\ncost of fortifying the Canal.\r\n\r\nOr it would build a fleet of thirty-five trans-Atlantic liners, each\r\nexactly like the lost _Titanic_, coal them, provision them and keep\r\nthem running between New York and Liverpool with a full complement of\r\npassengers and crew, almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThere are 21,718,448 cigars burned up in the United States every\r\ntwenty-four hours; and 904,935 every hour; and 15,082 every minute; and\r\n251 _every second_.\r\n\r\nThe annual _per capita_ consumption of cigars in the United States,\r\ncounting men, women and children, is eighty-six cigars.\r\n\r\n_If all the cigars smoked in the United States in one year were put\r\ntogether, end to end, they would girdle the earth, at its largest\r\ncircumference, twenty-two times._\r\n\r\nAS TO THE CIGARETTES, there are 23,736,190 of them consumed in the\r\nUnited States every day; and 989,007 every hour; and 16,482 every\r\nminute. With every tick of your watch, night and day, the year around,\r\nthe butts of 275 smoked-up cigarettes are dropped into the ash tray.\r\n\r\nCigarette smokers in the United States, not counting those who roll\r\ntheir own smokes from tobacco, spend $60,645,966.36 for the little\r\npaper-covered rolls.\r\n\r\nIf all the cigarettes smoked in the United States in one year were\r\nplaced end to end and stood up vertically they would make a slender\r\nshaft rising 512,766 miles into the heavens.\r\n\r\n_If strung on a wire they would make a cable that would reach from\r\nthe earth to the moon and back again, with enough left over to circle\r\none-and-a-half times around the globe._\r\n\r\nIf this quantity of tobacco could be placed on one side of a huge\r\nbalancing scale it would take the combined weight of four vast armies,\r\neach army consisting of 1,000,000 men, to pull down the other side of\r\nthe scale.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the tobacco consumed in the United States in a year is\r\nequal to the weight of the entire and combined population of Delaware,\r\nMaryland, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nFlorida, Tennessee and Alabama.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW OUR FINGER PRINTS IDENTIFY US\r\n\r\nARCH: IN THIS PATTERN RIDGES RUN FROM ONE SIDE TO ANOTHER, MAKING NO\r\nBACKWARD TURN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOP: SOME RIDGES IN THIS PATTERN MAKE A BACKWARD TURN,\r\nBUT WITHOUT TWIST.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Finger Print[7]\r\n\r\n  [7] Engravings and story by the courtesy of Scientific American.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Fingers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting facts about our fingers is that every\r\nmember of the human race, irrespective of age or sex, carries in\r\nperson certain delicate markings by which identity can be readily\r\nestablished. If the inner surface of the hand be examined, a number\r\nof very fine ridges will be seen running in definite directions, and\r\narranged in patterns, there being four primary types--arches, loops,\r\nwhorls, and composites. It has been demonstrated that these patterns\r\npersist in all their details throughout the whole period of human life.\r\nThe impressions of the fingers of a new-born infant are distinctly\r\ntraceable on the fingers of the same person in old age. The fact that\r\nthese patterns on the bulbs of the fingers are characteristic of and\r\ndifferentiate one individual from another, makes it an ideal means of\r\nfixing identity. Even men who look so much alike that it is virtually\r\nimpossible to tell one from the other so far as facial characteristics\r\nare concerned, can be identified by their finger impressions.\r\n\r\nInnumerable illustrations can be given of how the perpetrators of\r\ncrime have been identified and convicted by their finger prints.\r\nImpressions left by criminals on such articles as plated goods, window\r\npanes, drinking glasses, painted wood, bottles, cash boxes, candles,\r\netc., have often successfully supplied the clue which has led to the\r\napprehension of the thief or thieves. One of our illustrations is that\r\nof a champagne bottle which was found empty on the dining-room table\r\nof a house which had been entered by a burglar in Birmingham, England.\r\nThere was a distinct impression of a thumb mark on the bottle. An\r\nofficer of the Birmingham City Police took the bottle to New Scotland\r\nYard, London, and within a few minutes a duplicate print was found in\r\nthe records. The burglar was arrested the same evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FINGER PRINTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT\r\n\r\nWHORL: RIDGES HERE MAKE A TURN THROUGH AT LEAST ONE COMPLETE CIRCUIT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPOSITE: INCLUDES PATTERNS IN WHICH TWO OR MORE OF THE\r\nOTHER TYPES ARE COMBINED.]\r\n\r\nMany similar instances could be given of how thieves have been caught\r\nby handling bottles and glasses. On one occasion a burglar entered a\r\nhouse in the West End of London, and before leaving helped himself\r\nto a glass of wine. On the tumbler used he left two finger imprints,\r\nand these were subsequently found, upon search in the records at New\r\nScotland Yard, to be identical with two impressions of a notorious\r\ncriminal, who was in due course arrested and sentenced to four years’\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nA somewhat gruesome relic is a cash-box which bears the blurred thumb\r\nmark of a man who was convicted of murder. The box was found in the\r\nbedroom of a man and his wife who were murdered at Deptford, London, in\r\n1905. The cash-box was taken to New Scotland Yard, and the impression\r\nphotographed and enlarged. Two brothers, suspected of the crime, were\r\narrested, and the thumb print of one was found to be identical with\r\nthat on the lid of the box. Our photograph of a gate recalls a curious\r\ncase that recently occupied the attention of a London magistrate. In\r\nthis instance a thief successfully climbed the gate, which was ten feet\r\nhigh. In his attempt to reach the ground on the inner side he placed\r\nhis feet on the center cross-bar, at the same time holding the spikes\r\nwith his right hand. In this position he fell, and the ring he wore on\r\nhis little finger caught on the spike indicated by the arrowhead. This\r\ncaused him to remain suspended in the air until his weight tore the\r\nfinger from his hand. The ring with the finger was found on the spike,\r\nand in due course was received at New Scotland Yard. An impression was\r\ntaken of the finger, and search among the records revealed a duplicate\r\nprint, which led to the man’s arrest.\r\n\r\nIf a criminal handles a piece of candle or removes a pane of glass and\r\nleaves these behind, it is a hundred to one he has left a valuable\r\nclue for the police. The candle shown on the following page bears the\r\nimprint of a man’s thumb, and was found in a house which a burglar had\r\nentered. By handling the candle, the thief virtually signed the warrant\r\nfor his own arrest.\r\n\r\nThe system was first used by the police in the Province of Bengal,\r\nIndia, at the instigation of Sir William Herschel. Its value was at\r\nonce apparent. The work of the courts was considerably lightened,\r\nas the natives recognized that a system of identification had been\r\ndiscovered which was indisputable. Then from the police it was\r\nintroduced into various branches of the public service, and here again\r\nits value was quickly demonstrated. When native pensioners died, for\r\ninstance, friends and relatives personated them, and so continued to\r\ndraw their allowances. By recording the identity of pensioners by\r\nfinger prints, this evil was quickly stamped out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPRESSIONS MADE BY THE FINGERS AND PALMS\r\n\r\nPALMARY IMPRESSIONS OF WHOLE HAND, SHOWING HOW IT IS COVERED WITH\r\nRIDGES AND PATTERNS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                 RIGHT HAND  LEFT HAND\r\n  THUMB\r\n  FIRST FINGER\r\n  SECOND FINGER\r\n  THIRD FINGER\r\n  FOURTH FINGER\r\n\r\nFINGER IMPRESSIONS OF AN ORANG-OUTANG (ANTHROPOID APE) TAKEN AT THE\r\nLONDON ZOO. THEY WERE MADE BY SCOTLAND YARD.]\r\n\r\nThe wonderful lineations, in the form of ridges and patterns, which\r\nadorn the palmar surface of the human hand, had, of course, been\r\nknown for many years. Mr. Francis Galton, the famous traveler and\r\nscientist, was perhaps the first to give serious attention to the\r\nsubject of finger prints. He discovered many interesting facts about\r\nthem. Then, in 1823, Prof. Purkinje, of Breslau, read a paper before\r\nthe University of Breslau on the subject. Up to this date, however, no\r\npractical use could be made of the impressions for the want of a system\r\nof classification. Prof. Purkinje certainly suggested one, but little\r\nnotice appears to have been taken of it.\r\n\r\nNaturally, to be of any value to the police or to any government\r\ndepartment, it is absolutely essential to classify the prints in such\r\na way that they could be readily referred to and identity established\r\nwithout undue delay. It was virtually left to Sir William Herschel,\r\nof the Indian Civil Service, to invent a really practical system of\r\nclassification, so it may be claimed that the finger-print method\r\nof identification, as at present adopted, is the discovery of an\r\nEnglishman. Then it is only fair to add that Sir Edward R. Henry, the\r\nCommissioner of the Metropolitan Police of London, has also devoted\r\nmuch time and study to the subject. His book, “Classification and Uses\r\nof Finger Prints,” has passed through many editions, and has been\r\ntranslated into several foreign languages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THIEVES HAVE BEEN CAUGHT THROUGH FINGER PRINTS\r\n\r\nA CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE HAVING THUMB IMPRINT, WHICH LED TO ARREST OF A\r\nBURGLAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANDLE BEARING THUMB MARK OF A BURGLAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASH-BOX IN BEDROOM OF MURDERED MAN AND WIFE. THE THUMB\r\nIMPRESSION (POINTED AT BY ARROW) LED TO ARREST OF THE MURDERER.]\r\n\r\nImpressions are divided up into four distinct types or patterns. First,\r\nwe have arches in which the ridges run from one side to the other,\r\nmaking no backward turn. In loops, however, some of the ridges do make\r\na backward turn, but are devoid of twists. In whorls some of the ridges\r\nmake a turn through at least one complete circuit. Under composites are\r\nincluded patterns in which two or more of the former types are combined\r\nin the same imprint. Although similarity in type is of frequent\r\noccurrence, completely coincident ridge characteristics have never been\r\nfound in any two impressions. It is not necessary here to enter into\r\na detailed account as to how the classification of these wonderful\r\nlineations of the human hand is effected. It is based on a number\r\nvalue, attained by an examination, by means of a magnifying glass, of\r\nthe “deltas” and “cores,” which break up a collection into as many as\r\n1024 separate primary groups, each of which can again, by a system\r\nof sub-classification, be further split up into quite a number of\r\nsub-groups. When the British police discover finger prints on articles\r\nat the scene of crime, the latter are at once conveyed to New Scotland\r\nYard. If the impressions are very faint, a little powder, known to\r\nchemists as “grey powder” (mercury and chalk), is sprinkled over the\r\nmarking and then gently brushed off with a camel-hair brush. This\r\nbrings out the imprint much more clearly. If one places his dry thumb\r\nupon a piece of white paper no visible impression is left. If powder,\r\nhowever, is sprinkled over the spot and then brushed off, a distinct\r\nimpression is seen. In the case of candles and articles of this nature,\r\na drop of printer’s ink is lightly smeared over an impression, in order\r\nthe more clearly to define the ridges and patterns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SPIKE THAT CAUGHT A CRIMINAL\r\n\r\nON THE SPIKE OF THE GATE (INDICATED BY AN ARROW) A CRIMINAL LEFT HIS\r\nFINGER AND RING, WHICH LED TO HIS CONVICTION.]\r\n\r\nAt the headquarters of the British police at New Scotland Yard they\r\npossess special cameras and a dark room for photographing these thumb\r\nmarks. The dark room is 21 feet long and 7 feet wide. When finger\r\nprints are required for production in court they are first enlarged\r\nfive diameters with an enlarging camera. The negatives are afterward\r\nplaced in an electric light enlarging lantern, with which it is\r\npossible to obtain photographic enlargements of a thumb mark 36 inches\r\nsquare. The lantern is arranged on a specially made table 12 feet long,\r\nthe lantern running between tram lines, so that when moved it is square\r\nwith the easel.\r\n\r\nCriminals have naturally come to dread the value of their thumb marks\r\nas a means of identifying their movements. Some will try to obliterate\r\nthe markings by pricking their fingers, but so far this has not\r\navailed them. To successfully accomplish this it would be necessary\r\nto obliterate the whole of the palmary impressions on the tip of each\r\nfinger of each hand.\r\n\r\nThen the system, too, is far in advance of any other, both in\r\nreliability and simplicity of working. Compared to anthropometry, for\r\ninstance, invented by M. Bertillon, in which measurements of certain\r\nportions of the body are relied upon as a medium of identification, the\r\nfinger-print system is certainly preferable. In the first place, the\r\ninstruments are costly and are liable to get out of order; while the\r\nmeasurements can only be taken by a fairly educated person, and then\r\nonly after a special course of instruction. In the finger-print system\r\nthe accessories needed are a piece of paper and ink, while any person,\r\nwhether educated or not, after half an hour’s practice, can take\r\nlegible finger prints. Then the classification of the latter is much\r\nsimpler and readier of access than the former.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing there are some 164,000 finger-print records in\r\nthe pigeon-holes at New Scotland Yard, and the number now being added\r\nto it is at the rate of about 250 weekly. The system, too, is not only\r\nin use in Great Britain, but in all the provinces of India, including\r\nBurma, and in most of the British colonies and dependencies. It is\r\nbeing rapidly extended, not only throughout Europe, but also through\r\nNorth and South America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECORDS OF FINGER PRINTS ARE KEPT AT HEADQUARTERS\r\n\r\n  SPECIMEN FORM.\r\n\r\n  This Form is not to be pinned.\r\n\r\n  MALE.\r\n\r\n  H.C.R.

R. Root Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the insect associations there are none that have more excited\r\nthe admiration of men of every age or that have been more universally\r\ninteresting than the colonies of the common honey-bee.\r\n\r\nThe ancients held many absurd views concerning the generation and\r\npropagation of bees, believing that they arose from decaying animals,\r\nfrom the flowers of certain plants, and other views equally ridiculous\r\nfrom our present point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Honey Come From?\r\n\r\nHoney is a sticky fluid collected from flowers by several kinds of\r\ninsects, particularly the honey bee; and the common honey bee from the\r\nearliest period has been kept by people in hives for the advantage\r\nand enjoyment which its honey and wax gives. It is found wild in\r\nNorth America in great numbers, storing its honey in hollow trees and\r\nother suitable locations, but not native to this country, having been\r\nintroduced in North America by European colonists.\r\n\r\nThe story of the honey bee is one of the most interesting of all\r\nstories of the living things found on the earth. The busy bee is the\r\nideal example of hard and persistent work and has for a long time been\r\nthe subject of interesting study for young and old. The bee is one of\r\nthe busiest of all of the world’s workers, and it is from the honey bee\r\nthat we get our expression “as busy as a bee”; such other expressions\r\nas “to have a bee in one’s bonnet”; also such others as “quilting\r\nbees” and “husking bees” are founded on the known activities of the\r\nhoney bee. The first expression means “to be flighty or full of whims\r\nor uneasy motions” which comes from the restless habits of bees, and\r\n“quilting bee” or “husking bee” originated from the knowledge that\r\nbees work together for the queen. In a quilting bee or husking bee a\r\nnumber of people get together and work together for a time for the\r\nbenefit of one individual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORKER-BEE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN-BEE, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRONE-BEE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHoney Is Produced by Bees which Live in Colonies.\r\n\r\n~HOW A BEE MAKES HONEY~\r\n\r\nA colony of bees consists of one female, capable of laying eggs,\r\ncalled the queen; some thousands of undeveloped females that normally\r\nnever lay eggs, the workers; and, at certain seasons of the year, many\r\nmales, the drones, whose only duty is to mate with the young queens.\r\nThese different kinds of individuals can readily be recognized by the\r\ndifference in size of various parts of the body, so that even the\r\nnovice at bee-keeping can soon recognize each with ease. This colony\r\nmakes its home in nature in a hollow tree or cave; but it thrives\r\nperhaps even better in the hives provided for it by man. In a modern\r\nhive, sheets of comb are placed in wooden frames which are hung in the\r\nhive-box in such a way that they can be removed at the pleasure of the\r\nbee-keeper. A sheet of comb is made up of small cells in which honey is\r\nstored by the bees, and in which eggs are laid, and young bees develop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEES LIVING ON COMBS BUILT IN THE OPEN AIR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does a Bee Make Honey from Flower Nectar?\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year the colony consists of a queen and workers,\r\nthere being no drones present at this time. During the winter the\r\nbees remain quiet, and the queen lays no eggs, so that there are no\r\ndeveloping bees in the hive. The supply of honey is also low, for they\r\nhave eaten honey all winter, and none has been collected and placed\r\nin the cells. As soon as the days are warm enough the bees begin to\r\nfly from the hive in search of the earliest spring flowers. From these\r\nflowers they collect the nectar, which is transformed into honey, and\r\npollen, which they carry to the hive on the pollen-baskets on the third\r\npair of legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUCUMBER-BLOSSOM WITH A BEE ON IT; CAUGHT IN THE ACT.]\r\n\r\nThe nectar is taken by the bee into its mouth, and then passes to an\r\nenlargement of the alimentary canal known as the honey-stomach, where\r\nit is acted upon by certain juices secreted by the bee. The true\r\nstomach lies just behind the honey-stomach; and if the bee needs food\r\nfor its own immediate use it passes on through the opening between the\r\ntwo stomachs. On its arrival in the hive the bee places its head in one\r\nof the cells of the comb and deposits there the nectar which it has\r\ncarried in. By this time the nectar has been partly transformed into\r\nhoney, and the process is completed by the bees by fanning the cells to\r\nevaporate the excess of moisture which still remains. When a cell has\r\nbeen filled with the thick honey the workers cover it with a thin sheet\r\nof wax unless it is to be eaten at once. The pollen is also deposited\r\nin cells, but is rarely mixed with honey. The little pellets which the\r\nbees carry in are packed tightly into cells until the cell is nearly\r\nfull. If a cell of pollen be dug out of the comb, one can often see the\r\nlayers made by the different pellets. This collecting of nectar and\r\npollen continues throughout the summer whenever there are flowers in\r\nbloom, and ceases only with the death of the last flowers in the autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Does the Queen Bee Do?\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as the honey and pollen begin to come in, the queen of\r\nthe colony begins to lay eggs in the cells of the center combs. The\r\ntitle of queen has been given to the female bee which normally lays\r\nall the eggs of the colony, under the supposition that she governs the\r\ncolony and directs its activities. This we now know to be an error, but\r\nthe name still remains. Her one duty in life is that of egg-laying.\r\nShe is most carefully watched over by the workers, and is constantly\r\nsurrounded by a circle of attendants who feed her and touch her with\r\ntheir antennæ; but she in no way dictates what shall take place in the\r\nhive. The eggs are laid in the bottom of the hexagonal cells, being\r\nattached by one end to the center of the cell. The first eggs laid\r\ndevelop into workers, and are deposited in cells one-fifth of an inch\r\nacross. As the colony increases in size by the hatching-out of these\r\nworkers, and as the stores of honey and pollen increase, the queen\r\nbegins to lay in larger cells measuring one-fourth of an inch, and\r\nfrom the eggs laid in these cells drones (or males) develop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW HONEY DEVELOPS IN A COMB\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF COMB HONEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN-CELLS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN AND HER RETINUE.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs do not develop directly into adult bees, as might be inferred\r\nfrom what has just been said; but after three days there hatches from\r\nthe egg a small white worm-like larva. For several days the larvæ\r\nare fed by the workers, and the amount of food consumed is truly\r\nremarkable. The larva grows rapidly until it fills the entire cell in\r\nwhich it lives. The workers then cover the cell with a cap of wax, and\r\nat the same time the larva inside spins a delicate cocoon under the cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE EGG OF THE QUEEN BEE LOOKS\r\n\r\nEGG OF QUEEN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW HONEY DEVELOPS IN A COMB\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF COMB HONEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are Drone Bees Good for?\r\n\r\nThe worker brood can at once be distinguished from the drone brood by\r\nthe fact that the workers place a flat cap over worker brood and a high\r\narched cap over drone brood; and this is often a great help to the\r\nbee-keeper in enabling him to determine at once what kind of brood any\r\nhive contains. Twenty-one days from the time the egg is laid the young\r\nworker-bee emerges from its cell, having gone through some wonderful\r\ntransformations during the time it was sealed up, this stage being\r\nknown as the pupa stage. For drones the time is twenty-four days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW A SWARM WILL SOMETIMES OCCUPY A SMALL TREE AND BEND\r\nIT OVER BY ITS WEIGHT.]\r\n\r\nAbout the time the drones begin to appear, the inmates of the hive\r\nbegin to prepare for swarming, which, to any one watching the habits\r\nof bees, is one of the most interesting things which takes place in\r\nthe colony. Several young worker larvæ are chosen as the material\r\nfor queen-rearing, generally located near the margin of the comb.\r\nThe workers now begin to feed these chosen larvæ an extra amount of\r\nfood and at the same time the sides of the cells containing them are\r\nremodeled and enlarged by the destruction of surrounding cells. The\r\nqueen (or royal) cell is nearly horizontal at the top, like the other\r\ncells of the comb, and projects beyond them; but then the workers\r\nconstruct another portion to the cell into which the queen larva moves.\r\nThis is an acorn-shaped cell placed vertically on the comb, about as\r\nlarge as three ordinary cells. As the cell is being built, the queen\r\nlarva continues to grow until the time comes for her to be sealed up\r\nand enter her pupa state. Although it takes the worker twenty-one days\r\nto complete its development, the queen passes through all the stages\r\nand reaches a considerably larger size in but sixteen days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DAILY GROWTH OF LARVÆ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRONE-COMB.\r\n\r\nWORKER-COMB.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE HONEY COMB IS MADE\r\n\r\nA STUDY IN CELL-MAKING.\r\n\r\nNote that the cells are made independent of each other, and that it is\r\nthe refuse wax, like droppings of mortar in brick-laying, that seems to\r\ntumble into the interstices to fill up.]\r\n\r\nIn the swarming season, at about the time the new queens are ready to\r\nleave their cells, the old queen leaves the hive and takes with her\r\npart of the workers, this being known as swarming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLIPPING THE QUEEN BEE’S WINGS\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUMP THE BEES OFF A COMB.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANNER OF USING GERMAN BEE-BRUSH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M.

The bees, before\r\nleaving their old hive, fill themselves with honey until the abdomen\r\nis greatly distended, and for this reason it is not necessary for them\r\nto collect nectar for a day or two, for they have other work to do.\r\nSome of the bees begin to clean out the new quarters and get it fit for\r\noccupancy; but most of them begin the construction of new combs. To\r\ndo this they suspend themselves in curtains from the top of the hive,\r\nand remain motionless for some time. The wax used in building comb is\r\nsecreted by the workers in eight small pockets on the lower side of the\r\nabdomen while they thus hang in curtains. Finally, after enough wax has\r\nbeen formed, they begin to build. The small flakes of wax are passed\r\nforward to the mouth, there mixed with a salivary secretion to make the\r\nwax pliable, and then are placed on the top of the hive by the first\r\ncomb-builders. Other workers then come and place their small burdens of\r\nwax on those first deposited, and this continues until the combs are\r\nfinished. There is more to comb-building than the mere sticking on of\r\nwax plates, however, and nothing in all bee instincts is more wonderful\r\nthan the beautiful plan on which they build the comb. The cells are\r\nhexagonal in shape, so that each cell in the center of the comb is\r\nsurrounded by six others. Nor is this the only remarkable thing in\r\ntheir architecture, for each comb is composed of a double row of cells,\r\nthe base of each cell being formed of three parts, each one of which is\r\nlikewise a part of a separate cell of the other side of the comb. By\r\nthis method the bees obtain the greatest possible capacity for their\r\ncells, with the least expenditure of wax. The accuracy of the cells of\r\nthe comb has in all ages been an object of admiration of naturalists\r\nand bee-keepers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as there are some cells constructed, and even before the cells\r\nare entirely completed, the queen begins to lay eggs, and the workers\r\nbegin to collect the stores of honey and pollen. They also collect in\r\nconsiderable quantity a waxy substance from various trees, commonly\r\ncalled propolis, with which they seal the inside of the hive, closing\r\nup all openings except the one which serves as the entrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE HONEY BEE DEFENDS HIMSELF\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF A STING NEAR THE EYE.]\r\n\r\nThe cells which are used for the storage of honey generally slant\r\nupward slightly to help keep the honey from running out. Queen-cells\r\nare made only when a new queen is to be reared.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan a Bee Sting?\r\n\r\nIt is true that bees cannot bite and kick like horses, nor can they\r\nhook like cattle; but most people, after having had an experience with\r\nbee-stings for the first time, are inclined to think they would rather\r\nbe bitten, kicked, and hooked, all together, than risk a repetition of\r\nthat keen and exquisite anguish which one feels as he receives the full\r\ncontents of the poison-bag.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens When a Bee Stings?\r\n\r\nAfter the bee has penetrated the flesh on your hand, and worked the\r\nsting so deeply into the flesh as to be satisfied, it begins to find\r\nthat it is a prisoner, and to consider means of escape. It usually\r\ngets smashed at about this stage of proceedings, unless it succeeds\r\nin tearing the sting--poison-bag and all--from the body; however, if\r\nallowed to do the work quietly it seldom does this, knowing that such a\r\nproceeding seriously maims it for life, if it does not kill it. After\r\npulling at the sting to see that it will not come out, it seems to\r\nconsider the matter a little, and then commences to walk around it,\r\nin a circle, just as if it were a screw it was going to turn out of a\r\nboard. If you will be patient and let it alone, it will get it out by\r\nthis very process, and fly off unharmed. I need not tell you that it\r\ntakes some heroism to submit patiently to all this maneuvering. The\r\ntemptation is almost ungovernable, while experiencing the intense pain,\r\nto say, while you give it a clip, “There, you little beggar, take that,\r\nand learn better manners in future.”\r\n\r\nWell, how does every bee know that it can extricate its sting by\r\nwalking around it? Some would say it is instinct. Well, I guess it is;\r\nbut it seems to me, after all, that it “sort o’ remembers” how its\r\nancestors have behaved in similar predicaments for ages and ages past.\r\n\r\n\r\nOdor of the Bee-sting Poison.\r\n\r\nAfter one bee has stung you, if you remain where you were stung, the\r\nsmell of the poison, or something else, will be pretty sure to get more\r\nstings for you, unless you are very careful. It has been suggested that\r\nthis is owing to the smell of the poison, and that the use of smoke\r\nwill neutralize this scent. This probably is so.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Should I Do If I Am Stung by a Bee?\r\n\r\nThe blade of a knife, if one is handy, may be slid under the\r\npoison-bag, and the sting lifted out, without pressing a particle more\r\nof the poison into the wound. When a knife-blade is not handy, push\r\nthe sting out with the thumb or finger nail in much the same way. It\r\nis quite desirable that the sting should be taken out as quickly as\r\npossible, for if the barbs once get a hold in the flesh, the muscular\r\ncontractions will rapidly work the sting deeper and deeper. Sometimes\r\nthe sting separates, and a part of it (one of the splinters, so to\r\nspeak) is left in the wound; it has been suggested that we should be\r\nvery careful to remove every one of these tiny points; but after trying\r\nmany times to see what the effect would be, I have concluded that they\r\ndo but little harm, and that the main thing is, to remove the part\r\ncontaining the poison-bag before it has emptied itself completely into\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Are Some Races White, and Others Black, Yellow and Brown?\r\n\r\nWhat you eat determines your color, according to Bergfield, a German\r\ninvestigator. Not necessarily that you yourself could effect any change\r\nin color, but your ancestors for thousands of years have unconsciously\r\nbeen influenced by the food they have eaten and the drinks they have\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the original men were black, says Bergfield. Their chief\r\ndiet was of vegetables and fruits, he explains, and these same food\r\ncontains manganates that are not unlike iron. Dark browns and blacks\r\nresult from this combination. It is a scientific fact that negroes who\r\ndrink milk and eat meat are never as dark as those who eat vegetables.\r\n\r\nAgain, Mongols are yellow because they have descended from races that\r\nwere fruit-eating, and who, making their way into the deepest nooks\r\nand widest plains of Asia, developed into shepherds and lived largely\r\non milk. Of course it is now known that milk contains a certain\r\npercentage of chlorine, and has a decidedly bleaching effect. In the\r\ncase of Caucasians, they are said to have become white by adding salt\r\nto their foods, which common salt is a strong chloride, and powerful in\r\nbleaching the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HIDE HOUSE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Piece of Leather[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] Pictures by courtesy of Endicott, Johnson & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Leather Come From?\r\n\r\nLeather is made by treating the hides of various animals such as the\r\ncalf, cow and horse. These are the principal animals from which we\r\nobtain hides for making leather to make shoes. Before the hides are\r\nfit for making shoes, they must be taken to a tannery where they are\r\nprepared and tanned.\r\n\r\nIn viewing a tannery, we enter first the enormous hide house. It is\r\nlong, damp and dark. Here the hides are collected from all over the\r\nworld and stored, awaiting their turn for tanning. We follow a small\r\ncar of these hides into the beamhouse. We see the hides loaded into a\r\nvat. They are soaked, resoaked, softened and split into sides. This\r\noperation, while simple, holds your attention longer perhaps than any\r\nof the others. Several hides after being softened are thrown over\r\na sort of saw-horse, the lot number is stamped on the hide in such\r\na manner that it appears on each side after being split. With an\r\nunusually long bladed knife the workman quickly cuts down through the\r\ncenter and the hides which are now called sides, fall to the floor.\r\nThey are next hooked together and pass on through vat after vat of lime\r\nsolution which loosens the hair and superfluous flesh. At the end of\r\nthis long chain of vats, we see the sides awaiting their turn at the\r\nfirst unhairing machine, where all the hair is removed and then to the\r\nfleshing machine, where the flesh is taken off and the sides are again\r\nloaded in a car and pass on to the tanyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE HIDES ARE TREATED\r\n\r\nTHE TAN YARD\r\n\r\nWe resume our travels, following a car of sides from the beamhouse to\r\nthe sole leather tanyard. There are about 40 operations in the tanning\r\nof sole leather, requiring about 100 days to produce first quality\r\nleather. In the tanyard, we see more than 500 vats, each holding 300\r\nsides, weighing about 23 pounds apiece. Each vat contains about 3000\r\ngallons of liquor at an approximate cost of $100 a vat. Here we see\r\nthe sides slipped over sticks and placed in vats six feet deep, where\r\nthey receive the tanning, the real tanning process which preserves the\r\nfibers giving the leather its life and long wearing qualities.\r\n\r\nFrom the tanyard we go to the big wringers where the liquor is wrung\r\nout, the hides are milled, dried and loaded on cars for the drying\r\nloft, where they are allowed to dry or season preparatory to rolling.\r\nThis long building is sectioned off every 50 feet into chambers, where\r\nthe hides are hung in the same manner as in the vats. The temperature\r\nof each room is changed from the outside temperature to a heat of 115\r\ndegrees, at which temperature the hides are dried and are ready for\r\nrolling.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the rolling room, we see an operation requiring skill\r\nand quickness of eye. The rollers pass to and fro over the side, which\r\nis now hard and stiff, with a pressure of 300 tons. This rolling or\r\nfinishing gives it a high polish and we see a beautiful side of sole\r\nleather, weighing from 18 to 25 pounds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW UPPER SHOE LEATHER IS TANNED\r\n\r\nIn the upper leather tannery we see the various operations preparatory\r\nto the actual operation of tanning the hide, about the same as in\r\nthe sole leather tannery, with this difference: Upper leather in\r\nthis tannery is generally chrome tanned, a process requiring 30 days\r\nand instead of vats sunken in the ground we see huge rolling drums\r\nrevolving at a rapid rate. This process is the most up-to-date method\r\nand absolutely insures the wearing qualities of the leather. This\r\nleather is very tough, yet is just as soft and pliable as glove leather\r\nand as comfortable to the feet. It does not harden with age, nor does\r\nit stiffen after being wet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNHAIRING MACHINE\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting sight while going through the tanneries is\r\nthe process of disposing of waste materials, such as hair, fleshings\r\nand the sediments from the lime and sulphur vats.\r\n\r\nThe hair is separated into white, brown and black colors, each color\r\ntaking its turn through the huge mill or gin where the hair is dried\r\nand afterwards baled. The brown and black are sold to plasterers. Those\r\nwho purchase the white often mix it with wool and use it for making\r\nmany useful articles.\r\n\r\nThe fleshings and trimmings are sold to manufacturers of glue.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ancient Sandal Maker as pictured on the wall of the\r\nruined temples at Thebes, Egypt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story in a Pair of Shoes[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] Pictures by Courtesy of United Shoe Machinery Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Made the First Shoes?\r\n\r\n~WHERE SHOES COME FROM~\r\n\r\nThe making of shoes is one of the oldest arts of which there is any\r\nhuman knowledge. Long before primitive man devised any method of\r\nrecording his exploits or thoughts, he contrived--through necessity--a\r\nmethod of protecting his feet from the rough way or hot sands over\r\nwhich he was obliged to travel in his search for food and shelter.\r\n\r\nThat foot covering antedates clothing or ornaments is shown from the\r\nfact that the primitive savage to-day, devoid of clothing or ornament,\r\nis almost invariably found with a crude form of foot protection and\r\nthere is scarcely a tribe or nation without it’s traditions of the\r\nshoe--its mysterious power for good or evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Was the First Foot Covering Like?\r\n\r\nThe first foot covering devised was undoubtedly a simple form of\r\nsandal--a rough bit of hide, wood or plaited grass held to the foot by\r\nmeans of thongs, generally brought up between the toes and tied about\r\nthe ankle. This form of foot covering is depicted in records of the\r\ngreatest antiquity: in the ruined temples at Thebes Egypt, the ancient\r\nsandal maker is shown at his task; the Assyrian bricks show the ancient\r\nwarriors and people of that time wearing the simple sandal.\r\n\r\nThe dispersion of the human races and the wandering of tribes into\r\ncolder climates brought the necessity for more thorough protection\r\nfor the feet and body, and that this was accomplished was shown in\r\nthe gradual increase in the number of straps or thongs which held the\r\nsandal in place and, in the colder climates, in the contrivance of\r\na bag-like foot covering--traces of which are found even now in the\r\nIndian moccasin and the foot covering of the Eskimo. In all colder\r\ncountries this type of footwear is still in evidence, the seam around\r\nthe outline of the foot being a relic of the puckering string which\r\nheld the bag-like covering to the foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient sandal showing puckering string and thongs for\r\nholding it on foot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE “ZORI”\r\n\r\nA flat sandal with felt sole. Also showing “Tabi” or glove-like sock\r\nworn by Japanese.]\r\n\r\nThe sandal was developed and adorned by the Greeks, but it was not\r\nuntil the days of the Roman Empire that anything approaching the\r\npresent form of shoes was designed. In this period a form of foot\r\ncovering was developed--that was appropriated by the Emperor and worn\r\nby him only--which covered the entire foot with the exception of the\r\ntoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n  EVOLUTION\r\n  OF THE\r\n  SANDAL\r\n  TO THE\r\n  SHOE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT AND MODERN FORMS OF SANDALS\r\n\r\nJapanese Astrida or Rough Weather Clog.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Turkish Bath Slipper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Crakrow or Poulaine showing clearly traces of the\r\noriental origin of this design.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home made sandal of Siberian Peasant. Showing puckering\r\nstring and key strap.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE WARY\r\n\r\nA primitive form of foot covering very generally used by Japanese at\r\nthe present time.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern sandal issued by the Mexican Government for wear\r\nof soldiers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boot Developed from the Sandal.\r\n\r\nIt was but a step from this form of foot covering to the boot which\r\ncovered not only the foot but the lower leg as well and which came\r\nwidely into use afterwards in the form of the Jack-boot.\r\n\r\nUp to the fourteenth century there had been little in the way of\r\ndevelopment of foot covering, but it is well established that in the\r\nyear 1408 there were shoemakers’ guilds in Europe. Some of these\r\nwere semi-religious in character, the members working in communities\r\nand sharing in the general product of their toil. Guilds of this\r\nperiod were very generally dedicated to either Saint Crispin or Saint\r\nCrispianus (the patron saint of shoemaking), and even to this day\r\nthe birthday of Saint Crispin is celebrated in some of the English\r\nshoemaking guilds on October 25. The ceremonies attending the\r\ncelebration in the olden days were of a very elaborate nature.\r\n\r\n~THE SHOE WHICH THE CHURCH AND LAW FORBADE~\r\n\r\nIn the process of time the shoes began to lose the crude nature and\r\ndesign in which the Dark Ages had held them and developed a style the\r\nfirst of which was apparent in the gradual elongation of the toes,\r\nthe custom said to have been introduced by Henry, Duke of Anjou,\r\nand these shoes were known as “Crakrows” or “Poulaines.” The style\r\nfinally ran to such extremes that effort was made to stop it by the\r\nchurch and government, but with indifferent success until finally its\r\nend was accomplished by the imposing of summary fines and threat of\r\nexcommunication by the church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRAKROW OR PEAKED SHOE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nImmediately the style went to the other extreme and the toes became\r\nvery broad, as evidenced in the period of Elizabeth, and in some\r\ninstances the shoes were as broad as six inches at the toe. They were\r\nmade of velvet and were slashed to show the satin lining.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Made the First Shoes in America?\r\n\r\nThe first shoemaking in America is recorded when Thomas Baird arrived\r\non the second voyage of the Mayflower in 1628. Baird was under contract\r\nwith the Plymouth Company to make shoes for the colonists and brought\r\nwith him divers hides, etc., for this purpose. It was recorded that in\r\n1636 a planter in Virginia employed six shoemakers to make shoes for\r\nhis slaves.\r\n\r\nThat in the early history of the country the art of making shoes had\r\nbecome of considerable importance is shown by the very summary laws\r\npassed by the different colonies regulating the industry. Particularly\r\nwas this so in the Province of Pennsylvania which, in 1721, placed upon\r\nits statute book most drastic laws regarding the making of shoes and\r\nregulating the prices to be charged therefor.\r\n\r\nShoemaking in New England early received impetus from the arrival of\r\none Phillip Kirtland, a Welshman, who came to Lynn, Mass., in 1636.\r\nHe was an experienced shoemaker and taught his art to many of the\r\ncolonists in his vicinity.\r\n\r\nShoemaking in this locality was further advanced by the arrival of\r\nJohn Adams Dagyr, who settled in Lynn in the year 1750. Dagyr was a\r\ncelebrated shoemaker and was enabled, from his own means, to secure the\r\nbest examples of work from abroad. He possessed the peculiar quality\r\nof being able to teach the art to those who came under his charge.\r\n\r\nThe fame of New England made shoes was due largely to the teachings\r\nof these men and the industry has continued to be one of the first in\r\nimportance. In Massachusetts alone, according to the census of 1910,\r\nover 40 per cent of the entire value of shoes in the United States was\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe young man of this period, who essayed to learn the shoemaking\r\ntrade, was ordinarily apprenticed for a term of seven years under the\r\nmost rigorous terms, as shown in some of the indentures of that period\r\nwhich are still in existence. He was instructed in every part of the\r\ntrade and, upon completion of his term of service, it was the custom\r\nfor the newly fledged shoemaker to start what was known as “whipping\r\nthe cat”--which meant journeying from town to town, living with a\r\nfamily while making a year’s supply of shoes for each member thereof,\r\nand then leaving to fill other engagements previously made.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that the master workman could largely increase his\r\nincome by employing other men to do certain portions of the work, while\r\nhe directed their efforts, and this gradually lead to a division of\r\nthe labor and was the beginning of a factory system--which has been in\r\nprocess of development from that time.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1795 it is recorded that there were in the city of Lynn,\r\nMass., over two hundred master workmen, employing over six hundred\r\njourneymen, and that they manufactured shoes at the rate of about one\r\npair per day per man.\r\n\r\nFactory buildings, as the words would be known to-day, were practically\r\nunknown at that time. The small buildings, about ten feet square, were\r\nin the back yards of many homes and in these little shops were employed\r\nfrom three to eight men.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, prior to the year 1845 there had been little\r\nchange in the tools employed in making shoes. The workman of that\r\nperiod, seated at his low bench, used practically the same implements\r\nthat were employed by his prototype, the ancient sandal-maker of\r\nEgypt. The lap stone, the hammer, the crude needle and the knife being\r\npractically the only tools used. Not that there had been no effort to\r\nperfect machinery for this purpose; Napoleon I, in his endeavor to\r\nsecure better shoes for his soldiers, had offered great rewards for\r\nthe perfecting of shoe machinery that would accomplish this purpose,\r\nbut although great effort had been made there had been no successful\r\nmachinery produced.\r\n\r\nIn this year 1845 the first machine to be widely adopted by the\r\nindustry was perfected. It was a simple form of rolling machine, which\r\ntook the place of the lap stone and hammer used by the shoemakers for\r\ntoughening the leather, and it is said that a man could, in half an\r\nhour, obtain the same results from this machine that would require a\r\nday’s labor on the part of the hand workman employing the old method of\r\npounding.\r\n\r\nThis was followed in 1848 by the very important invention by Elias Howe\r\nof the sewing machine--which was not adapted for use in connection with\r\nsewing leather until several years later. It started, however, an era\r\nof great activity among inventors and in 1857 there was perfected a\r\nmachine for driving pegs, which came into successful operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Machine for Making Shoes.\r\n\r\nThis was shortly followed by a very important invention by Lyman E.\r\nBlake, of Abington, Mass., of a machine for sewing the soles of shoes\r\nand this afterwards became famous as the “McKay Sewing Machine.” This\r\ninvention of Blake’s was purchased by Gordon McKay, who spent large\r\nsums of money in perfecting it, and the first machine was established\r\nin Lynn in 1861. The results obtained in the early stages of the\r\nmachines were of an indifferent nature and it was only after large\r\nexpenditures and the hiring of a number of different inventors to work\r\nupon it that a successful machine was produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOTS OF THE CAVALIERS AND POSTILLIONS\r\n\r\nFRENCH POSTILLION BOOT OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAVALIER BOOT OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILITARY JACK BOOT OF CROMWELL’S TIME]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILITARY JACK BOOT OF SIXTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\n~HOW SHOE MACHINERY WAS DEVELOPED~\r\n\r\nWhile the quality of work was pronounced by manufacturers to be a\r\nsuccess, few had any faith in the possibility of manufacturing shoes\r\nby machinery and McKay met with constant rebuffs in his endeavor\r\nto introduce his machine. It is recorded that in his desperation\r\nhe finally offered to sell all the patent rights in machines which\r\nhe owned to a syndicate of Lynn manufacturers for the sum of\r\n$250,000.00--the amount he had expended--but the offer was refused.\r\n\r\nIn his dilemma McKay at last offered to shoe manufacturers the use of\r\nhis machines on a basis, which afterwards became famous and an inherent\r\npart of the shoe industry known as “royalty,” whereby McKay placed his\r\nmachines with manufacturers and participated to a small extent in the\r\namount of money saved. Owing to the fact that shoemakers were leaving\r\nrapidly for the front and that there was a great scarcity of footwear,\r\nthe manufacturers gladly accepted this proposition and the machines\r\nwere very rapidly introduced.\r\n\r\nThe success of his early machines accomplished, McKay set about the\r\nperfecting of others that would do different parts of the work and\r\nthere was accordingly great activity on the part of inventors in\r\ntheir endeavor to perfect machines for the wide variety of uses made\r\nnecessary in the preparation of leather for shoemaking. There were soon\r\nmachines on the market for a wide variety of purposes--including the\r\nlasting of the shoe, cutting the leather and for many other processes\r\nnecessary in making a complete shoe.\r\n\r\nContemporary with the early success of the McKay machines, a French\r\ninventor, August Destoney, conceived the idea of making a machine\r\nwhich would sew turned shoes--then a popular type of footwear for\r\nwomen. After several years of endeavor he finally secured the interest\r\nof John Hanan, a famous shoemaker of that time in New York City, and\r\nthrough him the interest of Charles Goodyear--nephew of Goodyear of\r\nIndia-rubber fame.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the machine become perfected for the sewing of turned\r\nshoes, however, than he set to work to make changes which would fit\r\nit to sew welt shoes. (The welt shoe has always been considered the\r\nhighest type of shoemaking, as, by a very ingenious process, a shoe\r\nis made which is perfectly smooth inside; all the other types having\r\na seam of thread or tacks inside which make them of considerable\r\ndisadvantage. He was able to accomplish this a few years later,\r\nalthough the machines were not in extended use until about 1893, when\r\nauxiliary machines for performing important parts of the work were\r\nperfected; and from that time headway was made in the manufacture of\r\nthis high grade type of footwear.\r\n\r\nThe development of the industry--which has been very rapid with the\r\nintroduction of machinery--suffered materially in the latter part of\r\nthe last century through the bitter rivalry of machinery manufacturers,\r\na common process being the enjoining of manufacturers from the use of\r\nmachines on which it was claimed the patents were infringed and this\r\ncreated a state of great uncertainty in the minds of many of those\r\nmanufacturing shoes.\r\n\r\nThis condition finally found its solution in the formation of one large\r\ncorporation, known in the shoe industry as the “United Shoe Machinery\r\nCompany,” which purchased the patents for a sufficient number of\r\nmachines to form a complete system for the “bottoming”--or fastening\r\nthe soles and heels of shoes--and finishing them.\r\n\r\nThese machines have been the subject of constant improvement and\r\nothers have been perfected to take care of operations which, prior to\r\ntheir introduction, were purely hand operations. Each machine has been\r\nstandardized and so adapted to meet the requirements of those used in\r\nconnection with it that they collectively form the most remarkable and\r\nefficient system of machines used at the present time.\r\n\r\nMention is made of this company owing to the important position it\r\nhas taken in the organization and advancement of the industry, the\r\nAmerican-made shoe being the one commodity of world-wide consumption\r\nwhose supremacy is not contested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY LADY’S SLIPPERS OF EARLY TIMES\r\n\r\nEMBROIDERED RIDING BOOT WORN BY NOBLES DURING LAST DAYS OF POLISH\r\nINDEPENDENCE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMBROIDERED RIDING BOOT FROM PERSIA OF ABOUT 1850]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH CALF BOOT MADE IN NEW YORK CITY, 1835]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY’S SHOE--PERIOD OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY’S SHOE--PERIOD OF LOUIS XVI.\r\n\r\nHas wooden heel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY’S ADELAID OR SIDE LACED SHOE--PERIOD 1830 TO 1870]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHANNEL LIP\r\n\r\n  CROSS-SECTION OF INSOLE\r\n\r\n  WOODEN LAST—DETERMINES SIZE AND SHAPE OF SHOE\r\n\r\n  AN INSOLE\r\n\r\n  AN INSOLE TACKED TO BOTTOM OF LAST\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF A SHOE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Shoes Are Made by Machinery\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time the types of shoes ordinarily made are but five:\r\nthe “peg” shoe, which is the cheapest type of shoe made; the “standard\r\nscrew,” which is used in the soles of the heaviest types of boots;\r\nthe “McKay sewed,” which is made after the fashion established by\r\nGordon McKay; the “turn” shoe, a light type of shoe which was invented\r\ncenturies ago and which is still worn at this time to a limited extent;\r\nand the “Goodyear welt,” which has been universally adopted as the\r\nhighest type of footwear.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, this type of shoe has been selected to show the\r\nmethods employed in making shoes.\r\n\r\nTHE GOODYEAR WELT SHOE.--A Goodyear Welt shoe in its evolution from\r\nthe embryonic state in which it is “mere leather and thread” to the\r\ncompleted product, passes through one hundred and six different pairs\r\nof hands and is obliged to conform to the requirements of fifty-eight\r\ndifferent machines, each performing with unyielding accuracy the\r\nvarious operations for which they were designed.\r\n\r\nIt might seem that in all this multiplicity of operations confusion\r\nwould occur, and that the many details and specifications regarding\r\nmaterial and design of any given lot of shoes in process of manufacture\r\nwould become hopelessly entangled with those of similar lots undergoing\r\nthe same operations. But such is not the case; for, when an order\r\nis received in any modern and well-organized factory, the factory\r\nmanagement promptly take the precaution to see that all the details\r\nregarding the samples to which the finished product is to conform are\r\nset down in the order book. Each lot is given an order number and this\r\nnumber, together with the details affecting the preparation of the\r\nshoe upper, are written on tags--one for each two dozen shoes--which\r\nare sent to the foreman of the cutting room. Others containing details\r\nregarding the sole leather are sent to the sole leather room, while a\r\nthird lot is made out for the guidance of the foreman of the making or\r\nbottoming room, when the different parts which have received attention\r\nand been prepared according to specifications in the cutting and sole\r\nleather rooms are ready to be assembled for the making or bottoming\r\nprocess. If the tags which were sent to the cutting room were followed,\r\nit would be found that on their receipt the foreman of this department\r\nfigured out the amount and kind of leather required, the kind of\r\nlinings, stays, etc., and that the leather, together with the tags\r\nwhich gave directions regarding the size, etc., was sent to one of the\r\noperators of the Ideal Clicking Machine.\r\n\r\n~SHOEMAKING MACHINERY IS ALL BUT HUMAN~\r\n\r\nThis machine has been pronounced one of the most important innovations\r\nthat have been made in the shoe manufacturing industry during recent\r\nyears, as it performs an operation which has heretofore successfully\r\nwithstood every attempt at mechanical aid. Prior to its introduction,\r\nthe cutting of upper leather was accomplished by the use of patterns\r\nmade with metal edges, which were laid upon the leather by cutter, who\r\nthen ran a small sharp knife along the edges of the pattern, cutting\r\nthe leather to conform to it. This was a slow and laborious process,\r\nand if great care was not taken, there was a tendency to cut away from\r\nthe pattern; and in many cases, through some slip of the knife, the\r\nleather was cut beyond the required limits.\r\n\r\nThis machine has a cutting board very similar to those which were used\r\nby the hand workman and over it is a beam which can be swung either\r\nto the right or to the left, as desired, and over any portion of the\r\nboard. Any kind of skin to be cut is placed on the board, and the\r\noperator places a die of unusual design on it. Grasping the handle,\r\nwhich is a part of the swinging beam, he swings the beam over the die,\r\nand on downward pressure of the handle a clutch is engaged which brings\r\nthe beam downward, pressing the die through the leather. As soon as\r\nthis is accomplished, the beam automatically returns to its full height\r\nand remains there until the handle is again pressed.\r\n\r\nThe dies used are but three-quarters of an inch in height and are so\r\nlight that they do not mar the most delicate leather when placed upon\r\nit. They enable the operator to see clearly the entire surface of the\r\nleather he is cutting out, and it is obvious that the pieces cut by the\r\nuse of any given die must be identically the same.\r\n\r\nAfter the different parts required by the tag have been cut out by the\r\noperator of the Clicking Machine, some of the edges which show in the\r\nfinished shoe must be skived or thinned down to a beveled edge. This\r\nwork is performed by the Amazeen Skiving Machine--a wonderful little\r\nmachine in which the edge to be skived is fed to a sharp revolving\r\ndisk that cuts it down to the desired bevel. The machine does the\r\nwork in a very efficient manner, conforming to all the curves and\r\nangles. This skiving is done in order that the edges may be folded,\r\nto give the particular edge on which it is performed a more finished\r\nappearance. The skived edges are then given a little coating of cement\r\nand afterwards folded on a machine which turns back the edge and\r\nincidentally pounds it down, so that it presents a very smooth and\r\nfinished appearance.\r\n\r\nAside from the work of skiving toe caps and folding them, there is\r\ngenerally a series of ornamental perforations cut along the edge of\r\nthe cap. This is done very often by the Power Tip Press, by means of\r\nwhich the piece to be perforated is placed under a series of dies which\r\ncuts the perforations in the leather according to a predetermined\r\ndesign, doing the work all at one time. The number of designs used\r\nfor this purpose are many and varied, combinations of different sized\r\nperforations being worked out in innumerable designs.\r\n\r\nOn one of the top linings of each shoe there has been stamped the\r\norder number, together with the size of the shoe for which the linings\r\nwere intended. After all the linings have been prepared in accordance\r\nwith the instructions on the tag, they, in connection with the various\r\nparts of the shoe, receive attention from the Stitchers, where all the\r\ndifferent parts of the upper are united. The work is performed on a\r\nrange of wonderful machines, which perform all the different operations\r\nwith great rapidity and accuracy.\r\n\r\nAt the completion of these operations the shoe is ready to receive the\r\neyelets, which are placed with remarkable speed and accuracy by the\r\nDuplex Eyeletting Machine. This machine eyelets both sides of the shoe\r\nat one time with bewildering rapidity. The eyelets are securely placed\r\nand accurately spaced; and as both sides of the upper are eyeletted at\r\none time, the eyelets are placed directly opposite each other, which\r\ngreatly helps the fitting of the shoe, as thereby the wrinkling of the\r\nshoe upper is avoided.\r\n\r\nWith the completion of this operation, the preparation of the shoe\r\nupper is finished, and the different lots with their tags are sent to\r\nthe bottoming room to await the coming of the different sole leather\r\nportions of the shoe. These have been undergoing preparation in the\r\nsole leather room, where on receipt of tag the foreman has given\r\ndirections for the preparation of outsoles, insoles, counters, toe\r\nboxes and heels, to conform with the requirements of the order.\r\n\r\nThe soles are roughly died out from sides of sole leather on large\r\nDieing-out Machines, which press heavy dies down through the leather;\r\nbut to make them conform exactly to the required shape, they are\r\ngenerally rounded out on a machine known as the “Planet Rounding\r\nMachine,” in which the roughly died-out piece of leather is held\r\nbetween clamps, one of which is the exact pattern of the sole. On\r\nstarting the machine, a little knife darts around this pattern, cutting\r\nthe sole exactly to conform with it.\r\n\r\nThe outsole is now passed to a heavy Rolling Machine, where it is\r\nsubjected to tons of pressure between heavy rolls. This takes the place\r\nof the hammering which the old-time shoemaker gave his leather and\r\nbrings the fibres very closely together, greatly increasing its wear.\r\n\r\nThis sole is next fed to a machine called the “Summit Splitting\r\nMachine--Model M,” which reduces it to an exactly even thickness. The\r\ninsole--which is made of very much lighter leather--is prepared in\r\nmuch the same manner, and in this way it will be noticed that both the\r\ninsole and outsole are reduced to an absolutely uniform thickness.\r\n\r\nThe insole also receives further preparation; it is channeled on the\r\nGoodyear Channeling Machine. This machine cuts a little slit along the\r\nedge of the insole, extending about one-half inch towards its center.\r\nIt also cuts a small channel along the surface.\r\n\r\nThe lip which has been formed by the Goodyear Channeling Machine is now\r\nturned up on the Goodyear Lip Turning Machine, so that it extends out\r\nat a right angle from the insole, forming a lip or shoulder against\r\nwhich the welt is sewed. The cut which has been made on the surface\r\ninside this lip serves as a guide for the operator of the Welt Sewing\r\nMachine, when the shoe reaches that stage.\r\n\r\nThe heels to be used on these shoes have also been formed from\r\ndifferent lifts of leather which are cemented together. The heel is\r\nthen placed under great pressure, giving it exact form and greatly\r\nincreasing its wear.\r\n\r\n~THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SHOE COME TOGETHER~\r\n\r\nThe counters are also prepared in this room, as well as the toe boxes\r\nor stiffening, which is placed between the toe cap and the vamp of\r\nthe shoe. When these are all completed, they are sent to the making\r\nor bottoming room, where the completed shoe upper is awaiting them.\r\nHere a wonderfully ingenious little machine called the “Ensign Lacing\r\nMachine,” passes strong twine through the eyelets and in a twinkling\r\nties it automatically. This is done so that all parts of the shoe will\r\nbe held in their normal position while the shoe is being made. The\r\nknot tied by this machine is perfect and is performed with mechanical\r\nexactness. On high-grade shoes this work was formerly performed by\r\nhand and it will be readily recognized how difficult it was to obtain\r\nuniformity. The spread of the upper at the throat can be regulated\r\nperfectly when this machine is used. The different parts of the shoe\r\nnow commence to come together. The workman places the toe box, or\r\nstiffening, in the proper location as well as the counter at the\r\nheel, and draws the upper over the last. To the bottom of this last\r\nhas already been tacked by means of the U. S. M. Co. Insole Tacking\r\nMachine--which drives tacks automatically--the insole, which, it will\r\nbe noticed, conforms exactly to the shape of the bottom of the last.\r\nThis last, made of wood, is of the utmost importance, for upon the last\r\ndepends the shape of the shoe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EACH SHOE MACHINE DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT\r\n\r\nASSEMBLING MACHINE\r\n\r\nOperator locates back seam of upper on last. Machine drives two tacks\r\nwhich hold it in place.]\r\n\r\nThe shoe as completed up to this point with the parts mentioned\r\nfastened together as shown, is now ready for assembling. The workman,\r\nafter placing the last inside the shoe upper, puts it on the spindle of\r\nthe Rex Assembling Machine, where he takes care that the seam at the\r\nheel is properly located. He presses a foot lever and a small tack is\r\ndriven part way in, to hold the upper in place. He then hands it over\r\nto the operator of the Rex Pulling-Over Machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PULLING-OVER MACHINE\r\n\r\nDraws shoe upper smoothly down to last. Operator adjusts it so that\r\neach seam occupies correct position on last. Machine automatically\r\ndrives back to hold it in place.]\r\n\r\nThis machine is a very important one; for as the parts of the shoe\r\nupper have been cut to exactly conform to the shape of the last, it is\r\nnecessary that they should be correctly placed on the last to secure\r\nthe desired results. The pincers of this machine grasp the leather at\r\ndifferent points on each side of the toe; and the operator, standing\r\nin a position from which he can see when the upper is exactly centered,\r\npresses a foot lever, the pincers close and draw the leather securely\r\nagainst the wood of the last. At this point the operation of the\r\nmachine halts. By moving different levers, the workman is able to\r\nadjust the shoe upper accurately, so that each part of it lies in the\r\nexact position it was intended when the shoe was designed. When this\r\nimportant operation has been completed, the operator again presses a\r\nfoot lever, the pincers move toward each other, drawing the leather\r\nsecurely around the last, and at the same time there are driven\r\nautomatically two tacks on each side and one at the toe, which hold the\r\nupper securely in position. These tacks are driven but part way in, so\r\nthat they may be afterward removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LASTING MACHINE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT\r\n\r\nHAND METHOD LASTING MACHINE\r\n\r\nLast sides of shoe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LASTING MACHINE\r\n\r\nLast toe and heel of shoe.]\r\n\r\nThe shoe is now ready for lasting. This is one of the most difficult\r\nand important parts of the shoemaking process, for upon the success of\r\nthis operation depends in a great measure the beauty and comfort of the\r\nshoe. The Consolidated Hand Method Welt Lasting Machine, which is used\r\nfor this purpose, takes its name from the almost human way in which it\r\nperforms this part of the work. It is wonderful to observe how evenly\r\nand tightly it draws the leather around the last. At each pull of the\r\npincers a small tack driven automatically part way in holds the edge\r\nof the upper exactly in place, so that in the finished shoe every part\r\nof the upper has been stretched in all directions equally. The toe and\r\nheel of the shoe are considered particularly difficult portions to last\r\nproperly. This important part of the work is now being very generally\r\nperformed on the U. S. M. Co. Lasting Machine--No. 5, a machine of\r\nwhat is known as the “bed type.” It is provided with a series of\r\nwipers for toe and heel, which draw the leather simultaneously from\r\nall directions. There can be no wrinkles at the toe or heel of shoe on\r\nwhich it is properly used and the quality of work produced by it has\r\nbeen very generally recognized as a distinct advance in this important\r\npart of shoemaking. After the leather has been brought smoothly around\r\nthe toe it is held there by a little tape fastened on each side of the\r\ntoe and which is held securely in place by the surplus leather crimpled\r\nin at this point. The surplus leather crimpled in at the heel is\r\nforced smoothly down against the insole and held there by tacks driven\r\nby a very ingenious hand tool in which there is a constantly renewed\r\nsupply of tacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MACHINE THAT FORMS AND DRIVES TACKS\r\n\r\nUPPER STAPLING MACHINE\r\n\r\nForms small staples from wire.\r\n\r\nHolds shoe upper to lip of insole.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UPPER TRIMMING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nTrims off surplus part of shoe upper and lining.]\r\n\r\nIn all of the lasting operations the tacks are driven but part way in,\r\nexcept at the heel portion of the shoe, where they are driven through\r\nthe insole and clinched on the iron heel of the last. The tacks are\r\ndriven only part way in, in order that they may be afterward withdrawn\r\nso as to leave the inside of the shoe perfectly smooth. In making\r\nshoes other than Goodyear Welts, with the exception of the Goodyear\r\nTurn Shoe, it is necessary to drive the tacks through the insole and\r\nclinch them inside the shoe, so that the different portions of the sole\r\ninside the shoe have clinched tacks. These are left even after the shoe\r\nis finished. This smooth interior of the shoe is one of the essential\r\nfeatures of the Goodyear Welt Process.\r\n\r\nIn the lasting operation there is naturally a surplus amount of leather\r\nleft at the toe and sometimes around the sides of the shoe, and this is\r\nremoved on the Rex Upper Trimming Machine in which a little knife cuts\r\naway the surplus portion of the leather very smoothly and evenly, and\r\nsimultaneously a small hammer operating in connection with the knife\r\npounds the leather smooth along the sides and the toe of the shoe. The\r\nshoe then passes to the Rex Pounding Machine, in which a hammer pounds\r\nthe leather and counter around the heel so that the stiff portion of\r\nthe shoe conforms exactly to the shape of the last.\r\n\r\nThe shoe is now ready to receive the welt, which is a narrow strip of\r\nleather that is sewed along the edge of the shoe, beginning where the\r\nheel is placed and ending at the same spot on the opposite edge. This\r\nwelt is sewed from the inside lip of the insole, so that the needle\r\npasses through the lip, upper and welt, uniting all three securely\r\nand allowing the welt to protrude evenly along the edge. The needle\r\nin making this stitch does not go inside the shoe, but passes through\r\nonly a portion of the insole, leaving the inside perfectly smooth. This\r\npart of the work was formerly one of the most difficult and laborious\r\ntasks in shoemaking. As it was performed entirely by hand, the drawing\r\nof each stitch depended upon the strength and mood of the workman.\r\nIt is of course obvious that with different operators stitches were\r\noftentimes of different lengths and drawn at different tensions; for\r\nhuman nature is much the same everywhere, and it is impossible for a\r\nworkman who has labored hard all day to draw a stitch with the same\r\ntension at night as might have been possible in the morning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AUTOMATIC SEWING MACHINE WHICH NEVER TIRES\r\n\r\nWELT AND TURNED SHOE SEWING MACHINE\r\n\r\nUpper portion shows operator at machine. The lower shows formation and\r\nlocation of stitch formed by this machine.\r\n\r\n  Welt Stitch\r\n\r\n  Welt]\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how quickly and easily the work is done on the\r\nGoodyear Welt Sewing Machine. This famous machine has been the\r\nleading factor in the great revolution that has taken place in shoe\r\nmanufacturing. Its work should be carefully noted--all stitches of\r\nequal length and measured automatically, the strong linen thread\r\nthoroughly waxed and drawn evenly and tightly; for the machine never\r\ntires, and it draws the thread as strongly in the evening as in the\r\nmorning. Every completed movement of the needle forms a stitch of great\r\nstrength, which holds the welt, upper and insole securely together.\r\n\r\nAs the lasting tacks as well as the tacks which hold the insole in\r\nplace on the last were withdrawn just prior to this operation, it will\r\nbe seen that the inside of the shoe is left perfectly smooth. After\r\nthis process the surplus portions of the lip, upper and welt which\r\nprotrude beyond the stitches made by the Goodyear Welt Machine are\r\ntrimmed off by the Goodyear Inseam Trimming Machine--a most efficient\r\nmachine, in which a revolving cup-shaped knife comes in contact with\r\nthe surplus portions of the leather and trims them off very smoothly\r\ndown to the stitches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUTTING THE GROUND CORK AND RUBBER CEMENT IN SHOES\r\n\r\nINSEAM TRIMMING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nTrims shoe upper lining and lip of insole smooth down to stitches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELT BEATING AND SLASHING MACHINE\r\n\r\nBeats welt so that it stands out evenly round edge of shoe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACING SHANK AND FILLING BOTTOM.\r\n\r\nWorkman tacks shank in place and fills bottom with ground cork and\r\nrubber cement.]\r\n\r\nAt this stage the shoe is passed to the Universal Welt Beater, in which\r\na little hammer vibrating very rapidly beats the welt so that it stands\r\nout evenly from the side of the shoe. As the leather is bent around\r\nthe toe, it is the natural tendency of the welt to draw more tightly\r\nat that place, and this is taken care of by a little knife which the\r\noperator forces into operation, in the beating process, the toe is\r\nbeing taken care of, and it makes a series of little cuts diagonally\r\nalong the edge of it. The insole and welt now receive a coating of\r\nrubber cement. This cement is contained in an air-tight tank and is\r\napplied by means of a revolving brush, which takes its supply of\r\ncement, as required, from a can.\r\n\r\nIn this way, an even coating of any desired thickness is given to the\r\ninsole and welt. This machine has many advantages; the cement being\r\nclosely confined in the tank, there is almost no waste in its use.\r\nFormerly, when this was done by hand, the waste through evaporation or\r\nlack of care on the part of the workman was very material.\r\n\r\nThe heavy outsole of the shoe also receives at this time proper\r\nattention. The flesh side of this sole, or the side next to the animal,\r\nreceives a coating of rubber cement, and after it has dried slightly\r\nthe operator of the Goodyear Improved Twin Sole Laying Machine takes\r\nthe work in hand. In this machine there is a rubber pad, or mould,\r\nwhich has been made to conform to the curve in the sole of the shoe.\r\nAfter placing the last on the spindle, which is suspended from the\r\nmachine and hangs over the rubber mould, the outsole having been\r\npreviously pressed against the bottom of the shoe, the operator by\r\npressing the foot lever causes this arm to descend, forcing the shoe\r\ndown into the mould, so that every portion of the sole is pressed\r\nagainst the bottom of the shoe and welt. Here they are allowed to\r\nremain for a sufficient length of time for the cement to properly set,\r\nthe operation being repeated on a duplicate part of the machine, the\r\noperator leaving one shoe under pressure while he is preparing another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINES WHICH PUT THE SOLES ON SHOES\r\n\r\nSOLE LAYING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nPresses outsole to bottom of shoe where it is held by rubber cement.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUNDING AND CHANNELLING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nRoughly rounds outsole and welt to conform to shape of last. Cuts small\r\nchannel along edge for stitches.]\r\n\r\nThe next operation is that of trimming the sole and welt so that they\r\nwill protrude a uniform distance from the edge of the shoe. This work\r\nis performed on the Goodyear Universal Rough Rounding Machine, which\r\ngauges the distance exactly from the edge of the last. It is often\r\ndesired to have the edge extended further on the outside of the shoe\r\nthan it does on the inside and also that the width of the edge should\r\nbe considerably reduced in the shank of the shoe. This is taken care of\r\nwith great accuracy by the use of this machine. The operator is able\r\nto change the width at will. By the use of this remarkable machine the\r\noperator is also enabled to make the sole of the shoe conform exactly\r\nto all others of similar size and design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANNEL OPENING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nTurns back lip of channel preparatory to stitching.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANNEL CEMENTING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nCoats surface of channel so it may be laid to cover stitches.]\r\n\r\nThe surplus portion of the leather is now trimmed off on the Heel-Seat\r\nRounding Machine, and the channel cut by the knife on the Rough\r\nRounding Machine is turned up so that it leaves the channel open. This\r\nis done by the Goodyear Universal Channel Opening Machine, in which a\r\nlittle wheel, turning very rapidly, lays the lip smoothly back.\r\n\r\n~SEWING THE SOLE TO THE SHOE~\r\n\r\nThe outsole is now sewed to the welt. This operation is performed on\r\nthe Goodyear Outsole Rapid Lockstitch Machine, which is very similar in\r\noperation to the Goodyear Welt Sewing Machine used in sewing the welt\r\nto the shoe. The stitch, however, is finer and extends from the channel\r\nwhich was cut for it to the upper side of the welt, where it shows\r\nafter the shoe has been finished. The lockstitch formed by this machine\r\nis a most durable one. Using a thoroughly waxed thread, it holds the\r\noutsole securely in place, even after the connecting stitches have been\r\nworn off. This is one of the most important machines in the shoemaking\r\nprocess. It is able to sew even in the narrow shank, where a machine\r\nusing a straight needle could not possibly place its stitch.\r\n\r\nThe “Star Channel Cementing Machine--Model A” is again called into\r\noperation for the purpose of coating with cement the inside of the\r\nchannel in which this stitch has been made. A special brush with guard\r\nis used for this purpose, and the operation is very quickly performed\r\nby the skilled operator.\r\n\r\nAfter this cement has been allowed to set a sufficient length of time,\r\nthe channel lip, which has previously been laid back against the sole,\r\nis again forced into its former position and held securely in place\r\nby rubber cement. This work is done by the Goodyear Channel Laying\r\nMachine, in which a rapidly revolving wheel provided with a peculiar\r\narrangement of flanges forces back into place, securely hiding the\r\nstitches from observation on this portion of the shoe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINES WHICH PUNCH THE SOLES OF SHOES\r\n\r\nCHANNEL LAYING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nRubs channel lip down to cover stitches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOSE NAILING MACHINE\r\n\r\nDrives small nails which hold outsole in place at heel.]\r\n\r\nThe next operation is that of leveling, which is performed on the\r\nAutomatic Sole Levelling Machine--one of the most interesting used\r\nin the shoemaking process. This is a double machine provided with\r\ntwo spindles, on one of which the operator places a shoe to be\r\nlevelled. It is securely held by the spindle and a toe rest, and on\r\nthe operator’s pressing a foot lever, the shoe passes automatically\r\nbeneath a vibrating roll under heavy pressure. This roll moves forward\r\nwith a vibrating motion over the sole of the shoe down into the shank,\r\npasses back again to the toe, then cants to the right, and repeats the\r\noperation on that side of the shoe, returning to the toe and canting to\r\nthe left, repeating the operation on that side; after which the shoe\r\nautomatically drops forward and is relieved from pressure. This rolling\r\nmotion removes every possibility of there being any unevenness in the\r\nbottom of the shoe, and while one shoe is under pressure the operator\r\nis preparing a second one for the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMATIC LEVELLING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nRolls out any unevenness in soles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE HEEL OF A SHOE IS PUT ON\r\n\r\n  TOP LIFT\r\n\r\n  COMPRESSED HEEL\r\n\r\n  BEFORE OPERATION\r\n  AFTER OPERATION\r\n\r\n  Heel Attaching\r\n\r\nWORK PERFORMED BY HEELING MACHINES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMATIC HEEL LOADING AND ATTACHING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLUGGING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nDrives small pieces of ornamental metal which protect the heel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEEL TRIMMING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nTrims rough lifts of heel to desired shape.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEEL BREASTING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nCuts the breast of the heel to correct angle and curve.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDGE TRIMMING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nTrims edge of outsole smoothly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LUMP OF PULP.\r\n\r\nPaper such as found in this book is made from trunks and limbs of trees.\r\n\r\nThe use of good fibers in book paper is a guarantee of quality and\r\ndurability. The above illustration represents a lump of this pulp\r\nprepared for the beaters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the Paper in this Book is Made\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Does Paper Come From?\r\n\r\nEgyptians were the first people to make what would today be called\r\npaper. They made it from a plant called papyrus and that is where the\r\nname comes from.\r\n\r\nThis plant is a species of reed. The Egyptians took stalks of reed cut\r\ninto as thin slices as they could, laid them side by side; then they\r\narranged another layer on top with the slices the other way and put\r\nthis in a press. When dried and rubbed until smooth, it made a kind of\r\npaper, which could be written upon.\r\n\r\nOne of the first substances used for making the kind of paper we have\r\ntoday was cotton. Paper was made from cotton about 1100 A. D. From this\r\nthin cotton paper our present papers are a development, i.e., paper\r\ntoday is largely made of vegetable fibers. Vegetable fibers consist\r\nmostly of cellulose surrounded by other things which hold the short\r\nvegetable fibers together.\r\n\r\nThe fibers best adapted for making paper are those of the cotton and\r\nflax plants, and while the uses of paper were few, no other material\r\nwas needed when it was once learned that cotton and linen fibers would\r\ndo for making paper. All we had to do was to save all the old rags and\r\nsell them to the paper man.\r\n\r\nIn making paper from rags, the rags were allowed to rot to remove the\r\nsubstances that incrust the cellulose, and then beaten into a pulp,\r\nto which a large quantity of water was added. This pulp was put into\r\na sieve, until the greater part of the water had been drained off by\r\nshaking, and the fibers remaining formed a thin layer on the bottom of\r\nthe sieve. This layer of fiber was put into a pile with other similar\r\nlayers, and the whole pile was placed under a press, where more of\r\nthe water was removed. When they were dry, we had a very fair kind of\r\npaper which was, however, not much better than blotting paper and could\r\nnot be written on with ink because it was loose in texture and very\r\nabsorbent.\r\n\r\nTo give it good writing surface it was necessary to fill the pores.\r\nThis was done by sizing which gave the paper great firmness. Paper was\r\nsized by drawing the layers of paper through a solution of alum and\r\nglue, or some similar substances, and then drying them, then finally\r\npassed between highly polished rollers to iron it. This gave it the\r\nnecessary smooth hard surface.\r\n\r\nIn the modern method of making rag paper by machinery, the rags are\r\nboiled with caustic soda, which separates the cellulose fibers, and\r\nplaced in a machine in which rollers set with knives tear the rags\r\nto pieces and mix them with water to form a pulp. This is called a\r\nbreaker. The pulp is then bleached with chloride of lime, and is passed\r\non to the sizing machine. This machine mixes the pulp with alum and\r\nwith a kind of soap, made from suitable resins which serves the purpose\r\nbetter than glue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOT A WOOD YARD BUT THE OUTSIDE OF A PAPER MILL.\r\n\r\nThis shows the great piles of trunks and limbs of trees near a wood\r\npulp paper mill used in making paper for newspapers, books, magazines,\r\netc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Is the Water Mark Put Into Paper?\r\n\r\nThe pulp, which is now ready to be made into paper, is poured out upon\r\nan endless cloth made of fine brass wire. This cloth travels constantly\r\nin one direction, by means of rollers, and is given at the same time\r\na sort of vibratory motion, to cause the paper fibers to become more\r\nclosely felted together. On the wire cloth web are usually woven words,\r\nor designs, in wire, that rise above the rest of the surface. These\r\nare transferred to the paper, and are called water marks. The machine\r\nthen winds the finished paper into rolls, so that it may be handled\r\nconveniently.\r\n\r\n~HOW PAPER IS NOW MADE FROM WOOD~\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years the uses for paper have increased so greatly\r\nthat there have not been enough rags available to meet the demand for\r\nmaterial, and a successful effort was made to find other material from\r\nwhich paper could be made. Many fibers were tried before it was found\r\nthat wood pulp could be used. Straw and esparto grass, a plant that\r\ngrows wild in North America, were found to yield cellulose having the\r\ndesired qualities and were used to some extent. But the problem was\r\nsolved when it was learned that pulp made from trunks and limbs of\r\ntrees would serve even then. At first the powder formed by grinding up\r\nlogs was used, but the paper produced was not strong, and could be used\r\nfor very few purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT FORESTS TURNED INTO PAPER\r\n\r\nPAPER TREES.\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the trees as they grow in the woods. These trees are\r\ngood for making paper. Your morning paper, may some morning be printed\r\non what is left of one of these trees.]\r\n\r\nIt was discovered finally that if wood shavings were boiled in strong\r\nsolutions of caustic soda, in receptacles that would withstand very\r\nhigh pressure, the wood fibers were separated, and a very good quality\r\nof cellulose for paper manufacture produced, provided it was bleached\r\nbefore being made into paper, and most of our paper to-day is,\r\ntherefore, made of wood.\r\n\r\nLater on this process gave way to the sulphite process. In the sulphite\r\nprocess, a solution of sulphite of lime is used. Acid sulphite of lime\r\nresults when the fumes from burning sulphur are passed through chimneys\r\nfilled with lime. By this process the separation of the fibers and the\r\nbleaching are done at the same time and an even whiter paper making\r\nmaterial is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe sulphite process is now used almost exclusively in making paper\r\nfrom wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRINDING ROOM.\r\n\r\nIn this picture we see how the trees are first cut into smaller chunks\r\nbefore being reduced to chips for making pulp.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the process of making paper from wood has led to the\r\nuse of paper for many purposes for which it could otherwise never have\r\nbeen used. The wood pulp is also used in the form of papier-mâché, a\r\ntough, plastic substance, which is made by mixing glue with it, or by\r\npressing together a number of layers of paper having glue between.\r\nPapier-mâché can easily be molded into almost any form, and after\r\ndrying forms a very tough substance and one that will stand rough\r\nusage. It has been employed for making dishes, water baskets and\r\nutensils of many other kinds, for making the matrices for and from\r\nelectrotype plates, for car wheels, and many other purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE THE INGREDIENTS FOR MAKING PAPER ARE MIXED\r\n\r\nMIXING ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe wood fiber must be mixed with other ingredients when paper is made\r\nfrom it. This shows a corner of the large electro-chemical department\r\nfor the production of bleach and soda used in the preparation of rag\r\nand wood fibres.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WATER SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nA good deal of water is needed in making paper. From twelve to fifteen\r\nmillion gallons daily are drawn from the river and filtered through\r\nthis plant in Maine; clean paper of bright color being dependent upon\r\nthe use of pure water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEATING THE INGREDIENTS FOR MAKING PULP\r\n\r\nBEATER ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe ingredients for making paper are first mixed thoroughly in machines\r\ncalled “beaters” before going to the paper making machines. The\r\noperation of beating is one of the most important in paper making.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PAPER COMING OFF IN ROLLS.\r\n\r\nAs the paper progresses through the machines, it passes over a long\r\nseries of heated cylinders, drying and hardening the stock until it\r\nreaches the finished end.

D.\r\n  Warren & Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE PRINTED TYPE OF THIS BOOK WAS SET\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the wonderful Linotype machine by which the type\r\nof this book was “set,” as the printers say. The men who operate the\r\nmachine are compositors. Originally the type matter of books was set\r\nby hand and the compositor composed in type what the author of the\r\nbook had written. By pressing down on the keys which you see in the\r\npicture, the compositor sets the words in lines of metal. This machine\r\nis almost human. By touching the proper keys, the operator assembles a\r\nline of matrices the details of which are explained in another picture,\r\nand after this is done the machine automatically casts a slug from\r\nthem, turns and delivers a slug into a galley ready for use and finally\r\ndistributes the matrices back into their respective channels in the\r\nmagazine, where they are ready to be called down again, by the touch of\r\nthe key button. The latest model linotype has four magazines and can be\r\nequipped with matrices which when assembled will cast lines in from six\r\nto twelve different sizes and styles of type.\r\n\r\nThe assembling mechanism is the only part of the linotype where the\r\nhuman mind is applied to the working of the machine. It is necessary\r\nfor the eye to read what is to be printed, and the mind, through the\r\nmedium of the fingers, to translate this into assembled lines of\r\nmatrices; after that the machine acts automatically.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LINOTYPE—FOUR MACHINES IN ONE\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is made up of 90 keys, which act directly on the matrices\r\nin their channels in the magazine. The slightest touch on the\r\nkeybuttons releases the matrix, which drops to the assembler belt and\r\nis carried swiftly to the assembler. When a word is assembled, the\r\nspaceband key is touched and a spaceband drops into the assembler.\r\nWhen the necessary matrices and spacebands to fill the line have been\r\nassembled, the operator raises the assembler by pressing a lever on the\r\nside of the keyboard. When the assembler reaches its highest point it\r\nautomatically starts the machine and the matrices are transferred to\r\nthe casting position.\r\n\r\nThis illustration shows the manner in which matrices are constantly\r\ncirculated in the Linotype. From the magazine they are carried to the\r\nassembler, then passed to the mold, where the line is cast, and from\r\nthe mold after casting they are raised to the top of the machine and\r\nredistributed to their proper channels in the magazine.\r\n\r\nThe Linotype is sometimes called a typesetting machine, but this is not\r\ncorrect: it does not set type. It is a substitute for typesetting. It\r\nis strictly speaking a composing machine, as it does composition but\r\nits product is not set type, but solid slugs in the form of lines of\r\ntype with the printing face cast on the edge.\r\n\r\nIt is in reality four machines so arranged that they work together in\r\nharmony--the magazine, the assembling mechanism, the casting mechanism\r\nand the distributing mechanism. The magazine is at the top of the\r\nmachine sloping to the front at an angle of about 31 degrees, and\r\nconsists of two brass plates placed together with a space of about\r\nfive-eighths of an inch between. The two inner surfaces are cut with 92\r\ngrooves or channels running the up and down way of the magazine, for\r\ncarrying the matrices. The matrices slide down these channels on edge,\r\nwith the face or punched edge down, and the V-end extending toward the\r\nupper part of the magazine. Each of these channels will hold twenty\r\nmatrices.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LITTLE PIECES OF BRASS WHICH PRODUCE SOLID TYPE\r\n\r\nONE-LETTER AND TWO-LETTER MATRICES.\r\n\r\nLinotype matrices are made of brass. In the edge of each matrix is\r\neither one or two letters or characters in intaglio. The thickness of\r\nthe individual matrices is dependent on the width of the character.\r\nBy an ingenious arrangement either one-letter or two-letter matrices\r\ncan be used in the same machine, and either character on a two-letter\r\nmatrix can be used at will.\r\n\r\nThe two-letter matrix bears two characters, one above the other, one\r\nof which may be a Roman face and the other an italic, small capital,\r\nor black face. If a line is to be composed partly of the Roman face,\r\nwhich is in the upper position on the matrix, and partly of the other\r\nface, which is in the lower position, this is accomplished by means of\r\na slide on the assembler operated by a small lever.\r\n\r\nWhen the lower characters on the matrices are required, the slide\r\nis shifted and the matrices are arrested at a higher level, so that\r\nthe lower characters align with the upper characters of the other\r\nmatrices in the assembler. When the slide is withdrawn the matrices are\r\nassembled at the lower level. By means of this simple contrivance, a\r\nline may be composed partly of one face, partly of the other face, or\r\nentirely of either face.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIS SHOWS HOW THE HEADINGS ARE MADE IN CAPITALS OF\r\nDIFFERENT TYPE.\r\n\r\nLinotypes are guaranteed to be capable of setting above 5000 ems of\r\n6 point per hour, and this output is widely obtained in commercial\r\nprinting offices with first class operators. When a compositor speaks\r\nof the amount of type he sets per hour or day he speaks of “ems.” A\r\ncolumn of type matter is so many “ems” wide. The term “em” means the\r\nsquare of the particular size of type that is being set. Thus if a\r\ncolumn is said to be 13 ems wide it means that an em quad or square,\r\ncould be set 13 times in the width of the column. Type is graded\r\naccording to size by points. Machine type for book work runs from 5\r\npoints to 12 points. A point is one seventy-second of an inch, that is,\r\nthere are 72 points to an inch. This guarantee, however, by no means\r\nindicates the limit of speed at which the machine can be operated, as\r\nevidenced by records of 10,000 to 11,000 ems per hour maintained for an\r\nentire day. The rapidity of the Linotype is limited only by the ability\r\nof the operator to manipulate the keys, and the extreme capacity of the\r\nmachine has never yet been attained.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE LINOTYPE MAKES SOLID TYPE\r\n\r\nSECTIONAL VIEW OF MAGAZINE SHOWING CHANNEL FULL OF MATRICES.\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the machine with part of the magazine top and\r\nside removed. We can thus see how the matrices are arranged in their\r\nrespective grooves in the magazine. When one of the keys of the\r\nkeyboard is pressed down the first matrix in the corresponding grove in\r\nthe magazine escapes and drops upon a conveyor belt and is carried in\r\nits proper order to an assembler, which answers much the same purpose\r\nas a printer’s stick. The correct spacing or justification of the line\r\nof matrices is accomplished by means of spacebands, which are assembled\r\nautomatically between the words in the line by the touch of a lever at\r\nthe left of the keyboard.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LINOTYPE SLUGS.\r\n\r\nInstead of producing single type characters, the Linotype machine casts\r\nmetal bars, or slugs, of any length desired up to 36 ems, each complete\r\nin one piece and having on the upper edge, properly justified, the\r\ncharacters to print a line. These slugs are automatically assembled\r\nin proper order as they are delivered from the machine, when they are\r\nimmediately available either for printing from direct or for making\r\nelectrotype or stereotype plates. They answer the same purpose and are\r\nused in the same manner as composed type matter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTING THE SLUGS OF SOLID METAL\r\n\r\nLINE OF MATRICES BEING LIFTED TO DISTRIBUTOR\r\n\r\nAfter the slug has been cast, the matrices are carried up to the second\r\ntransfer position, where they are pushed to the right, and the teeth in\r\nthe V at the top of the matrices engage the grooves in the distributor\r\nbar of the second elevator, which descends from the distributor box at\r\nthe same time that the matrices rise to the second transfer position.\r\nThe second elevator then rises toward the distributor box, taking the\r\nmatrices with it, but leaving the spacebands; these are then pushed to\r\nthe right and slide into the spaceband box, to be used again.\r\n\r\nAs the second elevator rises toward the distributor box with its load\r\nof matrices, the distributor shifter lever moves to the left until\r\nthe elevator head has reached its place by the distributor box. It\r\nthen moves back to the right and pushes the matrices off the second\r\nelevator distributor bar into the distributor box, where they meet the\r\n“matrix lift” and are lifted, one at a time, to the distributor screws\r\nand distributor bar proper. The teeth in the matrix and the grooves in\r\nthe bar are so arranged that when a matrix arrives at a point directly\r\nover the channel in which it belongs, it “lets go” and drops into its\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nIf, however, there is a matrix in the line which was not designed to\r\ndrop into one of the channels operated from the keyboard, it will be\r\ncarried clear across the distributor bar and dropped into the last\r\nchannel, and from there it will find its way to the sorts box.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTIONAL VIEW OF METAL POT WITH LINE OF MATRICES IN\r\nPOSITION BEFORE THE MOLD\r\n\r\nThe casting mechanism consists of the metal pot, mold disk, mold,\r\nejector, and trimming knives. The illustration shows a cross-section\r\nof the metal pot, mold disk, and mold, with a line of matrices in the\r\ncasting position. When the line of matrices leaves the assembler,\r\nthey pass to a position in front of the mold disk. The disk makes a\r\none-quarter turn to the left, which brings the mold from the ejecting\r\nposition, where it stands while the machine is at rest, to the casting\r\nposition. It then advances until the face of the mold comes in contact\r\nwith the matrices. The metal pot advances until the pot mouthpiece\r\ncomes in contact with the back of the mold; at this point the pump\r\nplunger descends and forces the metal into the mold and against the\r\nmatrices. The pot then recedes, the mold disk withdraws from the\r\nmatrices and makes three-fourths of a revolution to the left, stopping\r\nin the ejecting position, from which it started. The slug is ejected\r\nand assembled in the galley.\r\n\r\nDuring the last revolution of the disk the bottom of the slug is\r\ntrimmed off, and in the process of ejection the sides of the slug are\r\ntrimmed, so that when it drops in the galley the slug is a perfect line\r\nof type, ready for the form.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE PRINTED PART OF A BOOK LOOKS AT FIRST\r\n\r\nAs the slugs of type, each of which represents a line, come from the\r\nlinotype machine, they are arranged in order in a brass holder the\r\nwidth of the line of type, called a “galley.” This holder is about\r\ntwenty inches long. As soon as it is filled one of the men in the\r\ntypesetting office takes it to a proof press where he makes a rough\r\nimpression of it. He runs an ink covered roller over the top of the\r\nslugs, lays a piece of blank paper on it and then either runs another\r\nroller over it or puts it in a hand press and secures an impression of\r\nthe type just as it is. This is called making a “galley proof.”\r\n\r\nThe galley proof is then sent to the proof-reader who reads it\r\ncarefully and indicates such errors in setting as appear and must be\r\nchanged. Before correcting the actual type, however, the composing\r\nroom sends the galley proof to the one who is publishing the book.\r\nThe publisher also reads the proof over carefully and, if he does not\r\nwish to change any of the wording, he sends it back to the composing\r\nroom with his “O. K.” attached in writing. If he wishes to change\r\nthe wording, he does so and the galley proof is then returned to the\r\ncomposing room marked “O. K. after corrections and changes are made.”\r\n\r\nThe linotype operator then makes whatever changes are desired or\r\nnecessary by setting new lines where mistakes or changes occur. If\r\nthere is only one wrong letter in a line, he must reset the whole line\r\nas the machine, as you remember, only turns out solid lines of type. A\r\nrevised proof is then sent to the publishing office and, if no further\r\nchanges are to be made, he gives instructions to have the “galley” made\r\nup into pages. How the pages are made up is shown in the next picture.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE PAGES OF A BOOK ARE MADE UP\r\n\r\nWhen the revised proofs come back from the publisher ready to be made\r\ninto pages, the publisher has marked on same what pictures are to go on\r\nthe pages of the “make up” as this is called. The compositor then picks\r\nout the pictures in the form of cuts which are to go on the different\r\npages and puts them in the page first. He then arranges the type matter\r\nfrom the galley proof around, above or below the pictures, puts in the\r\nproper headings and takes a “final proof” of how the pages are arranged\r\nto look. If this is satisfactory the publisher puts a “final O. K.”\r\non the proof in writing and the page is ready to be printed. Thus the\r\nbook is made up page by page. No page is printed without the O. K. of\r\nthe publisher and so, if there are any errors still in the page, the\r\npublisher is responsible.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THIS BOOK IS PRINTED\r\n\r\nPRINTING THE BOOK OF WONDERS\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the pages of the Book of Wonders being printed.\r\nThirty-two pages are printed on each side of a sheet of paper at\r\none time.

In reality it would\r\ntake from 100 to 400 of these dots to make an inch, according to the\r\nfineness of screen.]\r\n\r\n~HOW THE PICTURES IN THIS BOOK ARE MADE~\r\n\r\nThe first step is the making of the halftone negative which differs\r\nfrom an ordinary negative in being made up of different sized dots\r\ninstead of shades of gray. This result is obtained by photographing the\r\npicture through a halftone screen consisting of two pieces of glass,\r\nruled with black lines and cemented together so the lines cross at\r\nright angles and leave small squares of clear glass.\r\n\r\nThe effect of making the negative in this way is to represent the\r\ndifferent shades from black to white by large or small dots. Wet plate\r\nphotography is usually used in this process because the film is thinner\r\nand more intensely black besides being cheaper than dry plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  New Process Engraving Co.\r\n\r\nThis cut shows a portion of a halftone cut enlarged so that the dots\r\ncan be seen very plainly.]\r\n\r\nHaving made the negative the next step is to make a printing plate\r\nfrom it. To do this, a piece of metal, copper if the work is fine, and\r\nzinc for coarser work, is coated with a solution which is sensative to\r\nlight, fish glue is commonly used to which is added a small amount of\r\nammonium bichromate. The metal being coated and dried, it is put in\r\na very strong frame with the negative and squeezed together so that\r\nthey are in perfect contact. A powerful light is now directed upon the\r\nnegative with the metal behind it, the result being that wherever the\r\nlight goes through the white spaces in the negative, the coating on the\r\nmetal is rendered insoluble. Where the dots on the negative are, the\r\nlight is unable to get at the coating so that when the metal is removed\r\nfrom the frame and thoroughly washed this part of the coating washes\r\naway, leaving the part which the light got at attached to the metal.\r\nThis is now heated until the enamel, as the coating is called, turns\r\ndark brown and the picture can be easily seen.\r\n\r\nThe picture is now on the metal but it must be made to stand out in\r\nrelief before it can be used for printing from, so it is put in a bath\r\nof acid which eats away that part of the metal left uncovered by the\r\nwashing away of the coating and this leaves the dots which make up\r\nthe picture standing up in relief. A roller covered with very thick\r\npaste-like ink is now rolled over the picture, or cut as it is now\r\ncalled, and when a piece of paper is pressed against the ink covered\r\ncut each little dot leaves a mark of ink on the paper the total making\r\nup the picture as we see it.\r\n\r\nThere are many more wonderful things connected with the making of cuts\r\nsuch as the routing machine which has a tool that revolves so fast\r\nthat it turns around 300 times while the clock ticks once, and other\r\nmachines which cut hard metal as easily as you can cut a potato with a\r\nknife.\r\n\r\nColored pictures are also made by the process outlined above. The\r\npicture is photographed three times with a different colored piece of\r\nglass in front of the lens, the result being three negatives, one of\r\nwhich has all the blue, one all the red and the other all the yellow\r\nin the picture. By making cuts from each negative and printing them\r\non top of one another in yellow, red, and blue, the original picture\r\nis reproduced in all its colors. This is how all our pretty magazine\r\ncovers are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Editors of the Book of Wonders make acknowledgment herewith to the\r\nfollowing.

The book was partly written\r\n  by representatives of the industries concerned; inconsistencies in\r\n  grammar, spelling, punctuation (including the use of decimal points\r\n  and commas), style, lay-out, etc. have been retained. Contradictions\r\n  and repetitions have not been addressed. Alphabetical sorting\r\n  inconsistencies in the index have not been corrected.\r\n\r\n  Page 218, ... and have them meet as shown in Fig. 13 ...: The\r\n  illustrations in this chapter are not numbered.
