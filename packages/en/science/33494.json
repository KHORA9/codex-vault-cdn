It has been most valuable.\r\n\r\nThe original suggestion of this volume, and of the character of its\r\ncontents, I owe to Dr. James I. Wyer, Jr., Director of the New York\r\nState Library.\r\n\r\n                                                ARTHUR E.

It is this chiefly\r\n    that has differentiated the modern library from its\r\n    predecessors and has made prominent our present insistence\r\n    on the reader as well as the book, as a fundamental element\r\n    in what we are doing. At first evident only in a general and\r\n    somewhat vague recognition, by writers and speakers, of a\r\n    vital relation between libraries and the communities that\r\n    they serve, it later crystallized into definite discussions\r\n    of their reciprocal service--that of the community to the\r\n    library, consisting of financial, material and moral support\r\n    expressing itself partly in the appointment of adequate\r\n    boards of trustees and their proper backing, and that of the\r\n    library to the community, showing itself largely in the\r\n    provision of books, the collection of information, the\r\n    control and guidance of reading, and so-called\r\n    \"community-centre\" service. These facts have guided the\r\n    grouping and sequence of the papers and addresses that make\r\n    up the present volume. The authors, it will be noticed,\r\n    include more statesmen, publicists, and professional men,\r\n    and fewer librarians, than was the case with the two\r\n    previous volumes, thus reflecting the greater generality and\r\n    wider interest of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL COMMUNITY RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the following group have been included papers and\r\n    addresses largely by publicists or educators interested in\r\n    libraries from the general civic standpoint, and affected by\r\n    the general trend toward what has been termed here\r\n    \"socialization.\" They have been loosely arranged in three\r\n    groups--general ideas on the field, function and\r\n    possibilities of the library, papers on books and their\r\n    uses, as affected or promoted by the library, and general\r\n    addresses, chiefly at the opening of library buildings.\r\n    Within these groups they are given in general in their\r\n    chronological order, although with some exceptions whose\r\n    purpose will be self evident. Through them all runs the\r\n    thread of consciousness that service to the community must\r\n    be the primary object of the library, although the breadth\r\n    and extent of that service, as it was destined later to grow\r\n    and develop is not generally realized and in some cases\r\n    doubtless would have been deprecated by the writers or\r\n    speakers, could they have foreseen it. But in all these\r\n    pronouncements we may clearly see the dawning light of a new\r\n    library day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN\r\n    AMERICA AND ITS TRUE FUNCTION IN THE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\n    This comprehensive sketch, by Professor Tyler of Cornell\r\n    University, forms part of an address delivered at the\r\n    dedication of the Sage Library, at West Bay City, Michigan,\r\n    Jan. 16, 1884.\r\n\r\n    Moses Coit Tyler was born in Griswold, Conn., Aug. 2, 1835\r\n    and graduated at Yale in 1857. He was professor of English\r\n    at Michigan University in 1867-81 and from the latter year\r\n    to his death, Dec. 28, 1900, held the chair of American\r\n    History at Cornell.\r\n\r\n    In this address, Prof. Tyler has added to his equipment as a\r\n    philosophical historian his personal knowledge and\r\n    experience of the service that a properly administered\r\n    collection of books may render to a community.\r\n\r\nLooking over the entire course of American society, from its rough and\r\nhardy beginning, in the first years of the 17th century, I find six\r\ndistinct stages of development with reference to the possession and use\r\nof books by the people. The first stage is that of private libraries;\r\nthe second is that of special institutional libraries, like those of\r\ncolleges and other learned corporations, and intended for a limited and\r\nrather scholastic class in the community; the third is that of\r\nassociation or joint stock libraries, _i.e._, libraries of a more\r\nmiscellaneous and general character, but for the use only of those whose\r\nnames are on the subscription list; the fourth is that of common school\r\nlibraries; the fifth is that of endowed libraries, _i.e._, public\r\nlibraries founded and sustained entirely by private endowment and thrown\r\nopen to the public without any cost whatever to the public; and finally,\r\nthe sixth is that of free public libraries created, it may be, by\r\nprivate benefaction, but sustained in part at least at the public cost,\r\n_i.e._, uniting the two elements of private help and public selfhelp,\r\nand cherished by the public only as people will cherish that which costs\r\nthem something, and of which they have some sense of real ownership.\r\n\r\nBut before proceeding to inspect these successive forms of library\r\nevolution, the fact should be distinctly brought out as applicable to\r\nthem all, that the American people started on their career in this\r\ncountry with an uncommon interest in books; and say what one will about\r\nAmerican philistinism and American devotion to the practical, this\r\npeople have always retained that ancient and primitive homage for books.\r\nTo an extent, I think, unapproached elsewhere, they are, and they always\r\nhave been, a bookish people. In some other nations there is,\r\nundoubtedly, a larger leisurely class; and among persons of that class\r\nthere is a profounder and more extensive contact with books than is the\r\ncase with us. But while among most other nations, the craving for books\r\nis the propensity of one class, with us it may be fairly described as\r\nthe propensity of all classes. A certain tincture of bookishness has\r\npervaded the American people from the beginning. Perhaps the most\r\ndecided quality of American civilization has been its effort to unite\r\nthe practical with the ideal; its passion for material results ennobled\r\nby the intellectual and the spiritual; its fine reverence for\r\nstudiousness, even amid the persistent fury of dollar-hunting.\r\n\r\nAnd not only was this bookish trait visible in our colonial infancy but\r\nit may be said to have had an ante-natal origin. The two Englishmen who\r\nin the latter half of the 16th century did most to make possible the\r\nbirth of American civilization in the first half of the 17th, were Sir\r\nHumphrey Gilbert and Sir Walter Raleigh; and both were men possessed by\r\nthis large zest for ideas as well as for deeds; both were contemplative\r\nmen as well as active men. The last glimpse that any surviving mortal\r\nhad of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, before his ship went down in the sea, was\r\nof that stern hero sitting calmly on the deck, with a book in his hand,\r\ncheering his companions by telling them that heaven is as near by water\r\nas by land; and the last labor of Sir Walter Raleigh, before his\r\njudicial murder in the Tower, was to write one of the learnedest and\r\nstateliest books to be met with in the literature of modern men.\r\n\r\nAnd this flavor of bookishness which belonged to these two great\r\npioneers and martyrs of American colonization, seems to have passed on\r\nto the men who successfully executed the grand project in which they had\r\nfailed. When you run your eyes along the sturdy list of the great\r\ncolony-founders of the 17th century--the men who carried out the fierce\r\ntask of conveying English civilization across the Atlantic, and of\r\nmaking it take root and live in this wild soil--Captain John Smith, and\r\nWilliam Bradford, and Winslow, and Robert Cushman, and the Winthrops,\r\nand Dudley, and Hooker, and Davenport, and Roger Williams, and William\r\nPenn, you will find them all, in some special sense, lovers of books,\r\ncollectors of books, readers of books, even writers of books.\r\n\r\nAnd what is true of the leaders of that great act of national\r\ntransmigration is true also of the men of less note who followed in it.\r\nThe first American immigrants were reading immigrants--immigrants who\r\nbrought in their hands not only axes and shovels, but books. Their\r\ncoming hither was due to the restlessness inflicted by the possession of\r\nideas. Books were to them a necessary part of the outfit for the voyage\r\nand the settlement. And so rare and so precious were books in those days\r\nthat they were cherished as family treasures, and handed down as\r\nheirlooms; nay, they were so dealt with in wills and in contracts as if\r\nthey rose almost to the dignity of real estate. In fact, in those days,\r\nthe possession of an unusual number of books, with the reputation of\r\nusing them, constituted a sort of patent of gentility, and seemed to\r\nbridge the chasm between the most widely separated classes in society;\r\nas when, in 1724, a young mechanic, named Benjamin Franklin, arriving in\r\nNew York on a sloop from Newport, is invited to the house of the\r\nGovernor of New York and is honored by him with a long and friendly\r\ninterview, for no other reason than that the captain of the sloop had\r\ntold the governor of a lad on his vessel who had with him \"a great many\r\nbooks.\" \"The governor received me,\" says Franklin in his autobiography\r\n\"with great civility, showed me his library, which was a considerable\r\none, and we had a good deal of conversation relative to books and\r\nauthors. This was the second governor who had done me the honor to take\r\nnotice of me, and for a poor boy, like me, it was very pleasing.\" So I\r\nthink I am justified in saying that we started on our career as a people\r\nwith this underlying intellectual quality--a pretty general respect for\r\nbooks, love for them, habit of using them; and this is the impelling\r\nmoral force which prompts to the several efforts which society has made\r\nfor providing itself with books. Now, the first stage in the process of\r\nlibrary evolution--and I have called it that of private libraries--was\r\nthe prevailing condition of the American colonies during the whole of\r\nthe 17th century and the first third of the 18th. This is the picture:\r\nEverywhere books, but few, costly, portly, solemn, revered, read over\r\nand over again; every respectable family, however poor, having at least\r\na few hereditary treasures in the form of books, as in that of silver\r\nand choice furniture; and here and there up and down the colonies, an\r\noccasional luminous spot, drawing to itself the wide-eyed wonder of the\r\nsurrounding inhabitants, the seat of a great private library, belonging\r\nto some country gentleman, or clergyman, or publicist, like that of\r\nColonel William Bird, of Westover, or of the Reverend James Blair, of\r\nWilliamsburg, or of Dr. Cotton Mather, of Boston, or of James Logan, of\r\nPhiladelphia, or of Cadwallader Colden, of New York.\r\n\r\nThis is the first stage of library evolution. And, of course, it has its\r\npleasant aspects; but surely there is here no adequate provision for the\r\nintellectual wants of the entire community. Very few persons in any\r\ncommunity are rich enough to buy and own all the books they ought to\r\nhave access to; and the existence of great private libraries in a few\r\nwealthy households can no more supply this general need of books than\r\nthe great private dinners which are given in the same households can\r\nkeep the entire community from going hungry.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the second stage in the evolution of libraries is away\r\nfrom mere private ownership and use, and is toward complete public\r\nownership and use; but it stops far this side of it; it is the stage of\r\nspecial scholastic libraries, collected by colleges and other learned\r\ncorporations, and intended for the particular use of the learned\r\nclass--students, investigators, and specialists. The earliest library of\r\nthat sort ever formed in this country was begun at Harvard College in\r\n1638; near the close of the 17th century, another was begun at William\r\nand Mary College, and still another at Yale; thenceforward, and\r\nespecially during the past eighty years, such libraries have been\r\nmultiplying in the land, so that at the present moment there are more\r\nthan three hundred of them, and a few of them are now really vast\r\nlibrary collections. The value of these libraries--who can doubt? Yet\r\ntheir direct value is only for a class; they are scholars' libraries,\r\nnot people's libraries. This will not suffice; society cannot rest\r\nsatisfied, and will not rest satisfied until everywhere good books for\r\nall are placed within the reach of all. The complete popularization of\r\nbooks is the goal.\r\n\r\nSo we come to the third stage of library evolution--that of libraries\r\ngathered and controlled by voluntary associations of people, _e.g._,\r\njoint stock associations, but of course for the use only of those who\r\nsubscribe to them and share in the expense.\r\n\r\nHere we have a natural step forward; a goodly step; a step in the right\r\ndirection, but still not far enough. We shall all agree that this is the\r\nstrong and hearty modern method of doing difficult things--the method of\r\nclubbing together to do something; it is self-reliant, social,\r\ncooperative, mutually, helpful, What the individual cannot do alone a\r\nclub of individuals can do together. Thus the hardest and grandest\r\nachievements of our time have been brought about--vast railroads, vast\r\nmanufacturing and commercial enterprises. And so men and women, who\r\ncould not singly get the books they wanted, have joined forces and have\r\ngot them by combination.\r\n\r\nIt is a notable fact, however, that this third stage of library\r\nevolution was not reached until more than a hundred years after the\r\nfirst colonies had been settled.\r\n\r\nMany of you, doubtless, in wandering about Philadelphia--perhaps during\r\nour great centennial visit to that city--may have noticed the venerable\r\nbuilding of the Philadelphia Library company, and in the walls of it an\r\nold tablet with this inscription: \"Be it remembered in honor of the\r\nPhiladelphia youth (then chiefly artificers) that, in 1731, they\r\ncheerfully, at the suggestion of Benjamin Franklin, one of their number,\r\ninstituted the Philadelphia Library, which though small at first, is\r\nbecome highly valuable and extensively useful, and which the walls of\r\nthis building are now destined to contain and preserve.\" Now, in\r\nreality, that year 1731, when that first subscription library was\r\nstarted in America, begins a new epoch in the intellectual life of the\r\nAmerican people, the epoch of systematic cooperation for the procurement\r\nby the people of the great intellectual and spiritual boon of books.\r\nImmense results have followed from that example set in 1731. Therefore,\r\nlet us stop a moment longer, and listen to Benjamin Franklin's own\r\naccount of the way in which he came to think of that capital project.\r\n\"At the time I established myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good\r\nbookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston.\r\nThose who loved reading were obliged to send for their books from\r\nEngland; the members of the Junto had each a few. We had left the\r\nalehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in. I\r\nproposed that we should all of us bring our books to that room; where\r\nthey would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become a\r\ncommon benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wished\r\nto read at home. This was accordingly done, and for some time contented\r\nus. Finding the advantage of this little collection, I proposed to\r\nrender the benefit from the books more common by commencing a public\r\nsubscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would\r\nbe necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer to put the whole in form of\r\narticles of agreement to be subscribed; by which each subscriber engaged\r\nto pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of the books and an\r\nannual contribution for increasing them. So few were the readers at that\r\ntime in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor, that I was not\r\nable with great industry to find more than fifty persons, mostly young\r\ntradesmen, willing to pay down for this purpose forty shillings each and\r\nten shillings per annum. With this little fund we began. The books were\r\nimported; the library was opened one day in the week for lending them to\r\nthe subscribers, on their promissory notes to pay double the value if\r\nnot duly returned. The institution soon manifested its utility, was\r\nimitated by other towns and in other provinces. The libraries were\r\naugmented by donations; reading became fashionable; and our people,\r\nhaving no public amusements to divert their attention from study, became\r\nbetter acquainted with books; and in a few years were observed by\r\nstrangers to be better instructed, and more intelligent, than people of\r\nthe same rank generally are in other countries.\"\r\n\r\nI think you will agree with me that this is a very striking bit of\r\ntestimony, too much so to permit us to hurry past it. Note these few\r\nthings about it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, that device of Franklin's, started in 1731--what\r\ndoes it really signify in our history? It signifies this. It signifies a\r\nnew departure for mankind--the application of the democratic spirit to\r\nthe distribution of intellectual advantages. These things called\r\nbooks--these bewitched and bewitching fabrics of paper and ink, which\r\nsomehow contain the accumulated thought of all nations and of all\r\ncenturies, and can communicate to us the noblest pleasures and the most\r\ngodlike powers--these potent things, in all the ages before, had been\r\naccessible only to some few fortunate human beings--to a privileged\r\nclass--to rich men who wished them--to scholars who could win their way\r\nto them--in short, to an aristocracy of intellectual privileges. But in\r\n1731, by that modest device of Benjamin Franklin, the democratic\r\nspirit--the modern humane spirit--the spirit which in its true nature is\r\na levelling spirit only in this grand sense that it levels upward and\r\nnot downward, and raises the general average of human intelligence and\r\nfelicity--this benign and mighty democratic spirit, I say, which was\r\nthen marching with gentle but invincible footsteps along all avenues and\r\npathways of modern life, and was laying its miraculous touch on church\r\nand state, on kings and priests and peasants, on the laws and law-makers\r\nand law-breakers, on all the old activities of society, on the old\r\nadjustments of human relations, that spirit then began to touch this\r\nrelation also, the relation of man to the superb and royal realm of\r\nbooks. And the first effect of that touch was what? It was enlargement,\r\nliberalization, extension of intellectual opportunity for man simply as\r\nman. Hitherto books had been the privilege of the privileged class. In\r\neffect, Franklin says: They shall be so no more. In this year 1731 I set\r\nagoing a device concerning books which shall abolish the privileged\r\nclass by making all classes privileged, and shall finally result in\r\nplacing the blessings of books within the reach of all.\r\n\r\nBut, in the second place, in that year 1731, who was Franklin who did\r\nall that, and who were the persons who helped to do it? He and they were\r\nyoung men; obscure men, poor men, laboring men; mechanics and tradesmen\r\nof the town where they lived; young men just getting a start in the\r\nworld. So this new era in the brain life of the American people had its\r\nbeginning with such as they were. Who of us, therefore, however modest\r\nbe our lot in life, has any right to say to himself, \"I am not in\r\nposition to do anything for the advancement of my race\"? Nay; my\r\nbrother, think of young Ben Franklin, the printer, and his 50 brother\r\nmechanics; remember what they accomplished; and do not despair of being\r\nuseful in your time also. And in the third place, this movement came\r\nfrom those young men associated together in a social debating club. It\r\nwas their experience in the actual discussion of the problems of human\r\nthought which made them feel the need of books and suggested this great\r\nmeasure for popularizing books: a fact which fits in well with Mr.\r\nSage's idea of blending the two things together here; of giving\r\nperpetual house-room and hospitality to a debating club, here, in the\r\nvery midst of this library. And now the fourth point is, that the plan\r\nstarted by Franklin and those other young mechanics in Philadelphia, in\r\n1731, the plan of joint-stock library associations, worked so well there\r\nthat, as Franklin tells, it was taken up in other provinces. Naturally,\r\nthe new plan was adopted first in the towns where it was heard of\r\nfirst--the towns nearest to Philadelphia. But before many years, the\r\nnews of it had travelled far, to the southward and the northward, and\r\nwhether consciously or unconsciously the model set up in Philadelphia,\r\nwas imitated, with more or less closeness, in scores of places far away.\r\nOne curious example springs up in South Carolina. It is in the\r\nGeorgetown district, then given to the growth of indigo. A number of the\r\nplanters came together and formed the Winyaw Indigo Society. Their chief\r\nbusiness was to have a pleasant time together and talk indigo; they paid\r\ntheir initiation fees in indigo; they paid their annual dues in indigo;\r\nand presently they found their treasury so full and overflowing with\r\nindigo, that they resolved to devote their surplus in part to the\r\nformation of the Indigo Society Library. Then, too, at about the same\r\ntime in Charleston, seventeen young men, of very limited means, desirous\r\nof seeing the best and freshest English magazines, formed a club for\r\nthat purpose, and started with a fund of ten pounds sterling, not\r\nventuring at first to hope to be able to purchase books also. Soon,\r\nhowever, their plan grew and took in books; and from this small\r\nbeginning arose the great \"Library Society\" of Charleston, which has\r\nministered to the pleasure and benefit of the people of that place for\r\nnearly a century and a half.\r\n\r\nBut the Philadelphia plan travelled northward as well as southward. In\r\n1747, at Newport, Rhode Island, was formed, also out of a discussion\r\nclub, the famous Redwood Library, which lives and flourishes still. In\r\n1753 the Providence Library was started on the same general plan; in\r\n1754, the New York Society Library; in 1760, the Social Library at\r\nSalem, Massachusetts; in 1763, similar libraries at Lancaster and at\r\nPortland, Maine; in 1753, a similar one at Hingham; and so on throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious of these joint-stock library associations was\r\none formed in 1751 in three parishes in the towns of York and Kittery,\r\nMaine, and called the \"Revolving Library.\" It was not a circulating\r\nlibrary--that being the name of a library from which the books circulate\r\nsingly and in units; but it was called a \"revolving library\" because the\r\nentire library was to revolve, in bulk, on its own axes, in an orbit\r\nincluding the parsonages of the three parishes embraced in the scheme.\r\nAnd thus this library began to revolve from parsonage to parsonage more\r\nthan 130 years ago; and it has been revolving ever since, occasionally\r\nencountering some queer experiences, as when, about 15 years ago, it was\r\nfound by the new pastor of Kittery Point in the garret of the parsonage,\r\n\"dumped down on the attic floor like a load of coal,\" the wife of the\r\nformer incumbent having had a prejudice against books for sanitary\r\nreasons, \"considering them unhealthy, and so being unwilling to have\r\nthem in any living room\" where their presence might communicate diseases\r\nto the family.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is a rather eccentric specimen of the class of\r\nlibraries now under view. A very good normal example of the class is\r\nfurnished us by the social library of Castine, Maine, organized in 1801;\r\nand its articles of association I desire to read to you as exhibiting\r\nthe scope and spirit of this whole movement for supplying the public\r\nwith books through jointstock companies. The articles of association are\r\nas follows: \"It is proposed by the persons whose names are here\r\nsubjoined to establish a social library in this town. It is greatly to\r\nbe lamented that excellent abilities are not unfrequently doomed to\r\nobscurity by reason of poverty; that the rich purchase almost everything\r\nbut books; and that reading has become so unfashionable an amusement in\r\nwhat we are pleased to call this enlightened age and country. To remedy\r\nthese evils; to excite a fondness for books; to afford the most rational\r\nand profitable amusement; to prevent idleness and immorality; and to\r\npromote the diffusion of useful knowledge, piety, and virtue, at an\r\nexpense which small pecuniary abilities can afford, we are induced to\r\nassociate for the above purposes; and each agrees to pay for the number\r\nof shares owned, and annexed to his name at $5 per share.\"\r\n\r\nThe first public library in the north-west was established by an\r\nassociation formed at Marietta, Ohio, in 1796. Then followed similar\r\nlibraries at Cincinnati, and at Ames, Athens County. The latter, which\r\nwas formed as early as 1802, had a curious origin. It was popularly\r\nknown as the \"Coon-skin Library.\" The hardy pioneers of that township of\r\nAmes met together, it seems, to consider the subject of roads; and,\r\nhaving considered it, they proceeded to consider also the subject of\r\nbooks--a fine illustration, I think, of the blending of the practical\r\nand the ideal in the American character and in American civilization.\r\nHere were these sturdy pioneers projecting a public library even before\r\nthey had got their public roads cut out and put in order. What is called\r\nmoney hardly existed among them; but they knew how to shoot bears and to\r\ncatch coons and to take their skins, and these skins could be sent to\r\nBoston and sold for cash, and the money invested in books. This\r\naccordingly was done. The noted politician, Thomas Ewing, then a boy at\r\nAmes, gives this account of the affair: \"All my accumulated wealth, ten\r\ncoon-skins, went into the fund,\" the total amount of which proved to be\r\nabout $100. \"Squire Sam Brown, of Sunday Creek, who was going to Boston,\r\nwas charged with the purchase. After an absence of many weeks, he\r\nbrought the books to Capt. Ben Brown's, in a sack on a pack-horse. I was\r\npresent at the untying of the sack and pouring out of the treasures.\r\nThere were about 60 volumes, I think, and well selected; the library of\r\nthe Vatican was nothing to it, and there never was a library better\r\nread. This, with occasional additions, furnished me with reading while I\r\nremained at home.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the stuff of which strong men are made, and strong communities,\r\nand mighty nations. And what was done at Marietta, and at Cincinnati,\r\nand at Ames, was done in a multitude of other towns all over the\r\nnorth-west. At Vincennes, Indiana, a library was started by similar\r\nmeans in 1807; and one of the founders was Gen. Wm. Henry Harrison, the\r\nhero of Tippecanoe and hard cider. That was the first public library\r\nestablished in Indiana.\r\n\r\nSo, too, in Michigan, far back in its territorial days, similar\r\nlibraries were formed, especially that of the Young Men's Society of\r\nDetroit. But in Michigan, by far the greatest service in this direction\r\nhas been rendered more recently by the ladies, whose admirable library\r\nassociations in such towns as Ann Arbor, Flint, and Kalamazoo have done\r\nmuch, especially during the past twenty years, for the literary\r\nimprovement and enjoyment of the people.\r\n\r\nBut this third stage of library evolution, good and useful as it has\r\nbeen during the past 150 years, has this defect: it does not offer books\r\nfreely to all who would like books; it is limited to those who\r\nparticipate in its privileges by paying for them.\r\n\r\nTherefore society pushed forward into a fourth stage of evolution--one\r\nstill nearer to the grand object to be reached--the complete\r\npopularization of books. This fourth stage was reached chiefly through a\r\nnew idea entering into the case, namely, the duty of the state to help\r\nin providing books for the people who compose the state. The principle\r\nis already admitted that the state must educate its citizens, and for\r\nthat purpose must sustain schools. For the same purpose, and on the same\r\nprinciple, it must sustain libraries; for these are but an annex to\r\nschools, and the books in them are only a part of the necessary\r\napparatus for public education.\r\n\r\nIn this way was started the fourth plan, that of \"district school\r\nlibraries,\" a plan which for a while was hailed with delight as a real\r\ncontribution to human progress and happiness; which was eagerly adopted\r\nin this state and in many others; but which has, upon the whole,\r\nresulted in failure.\r\n\r\nThe State of New York has the honor of having started this plan, which\r\nwas first publicly advocated by Governor De Witt Clinton, in his message\r\nfor 1826. In 1838 General John A. Dix, then secretary of state, was\r\n\"charged with the execution of the law giving to the school districts\r\n$55,000 a year to buy books for their libraries, and requiring them to\r\nraise by taxation an equal amount for same purpose.\" The system was\r\nreceived throughout the state with enthusiastic favor. In 1841 the\r\nschool libraries of the state reported the possession of 422,459\r\nvolumes; in the following year, 200,000 volumes more; and in 1853 they\r\nhad reached the enormous number of 1,604,210 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe plan as advocated in New York soon passed over into Massachusetts,\r\nwhere it was taken up and advocated by Horace Mann, that noble-minded\r\nand eloquent champion of popular enlightenment. Through his influence\r\nthe necessary law was passed in 1837, but the operation of the plan was\r\nnever very successful in that state, and after twelve years had resulted\r\nin the accumulation of only 42,707 volumes.\r\n\r\nMichigan appears to have been abreast of Massachusetts in the adoption\r\nof the plan of district school libraries, incorporating it into its\r\nschool law of 1837.\r\n\r\nAfter New York, Massachusetts, and Michigan, the several other states\r\nwhich adopted this plan did so in the following order: Connecticut in\r\n1839; Rhode Island and Iowa in 1840; Indiana in 1841; Maine in 1844;\r\nOhio in 1847; Wisconsin in 1848; Missouri in 1853; California and Oregon\r\nin 1854; Illinois in 1855; Kansas and Virginia in 1870; New Jersey in\r\n1871; Kentucky and Minnesota in 1873; and Colorado in 1876.\r\n\r\nThese data will give you some idea of the wide extension of this fourth\r\nstage in library evolution. Its merits are very great. Perhaps its\r\ngreatest merit is that it recognizes the true function of the public\r\nlibrary as a part of the system of public education, and therefore as\r\nentitled to a share in public taxation. Moreover, it has undoubtedly\r\ndone a vast amount of good in placing the means of intellectual\r\nimprovement within the reach of millions of people of all ages; it has\r\nstimulated the love of books and diffused knowledge and happiness. And\r\nyet with all these merits, it has been a failure; and this is largely\r\ndue to just three defects in administration:\r\n\r\n1. Lack of care and wisdom in the selection of the books, resulting in\r\nthe acquisition of many volumes of trash and of profligacy.\r\n\r\n2. Lack of care as to the distribution and return of the books,\r\nresulting in their rapid dispersion and disappearance.\r\n\r\n3. Lack of care in the preservation of the books that were not strayed\r\nand stolen, resulting in their rapid deterioration.\r\n\r\nYou have got to apply business principles to the handling of books, as\r\nwell as of any other material possessions. Libraries as well as sawmills\r\nneed to be dealt with according to common-sense and with efficiency. Now\r\nupon the general failure of these libraries, let me quote for you a\r\nlittle testimony. The superintendent of schools in New York State, in\r\n1875, says: \"The system has not worked well in this state.... The\r\nlibraries have fallen into disuse, and have become practically\r\nvalueless.\" [1 Pub. lib. of U.S., i. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe superintendent for 1861 says that in \"nearly every quarter of the\r\nstate,\" the libraries are \"almost totally unused and rapidly\r\ndeteriorating.\" [2 Pub. Lib. of U.S. i. 40.] For 1862, the\r\nsuperintendent gives a more detailed picture of the condition of the\r\nschool libraries. He finds them \"mainly represented by a motley\r\ncollection of books, ranging from 'Headley's sacred mountains' to the\r\n'Pirate's own book,' numbering in the aggregate a million and a half of\r\nvolumes, scattered among the various families, constituting a part of\r\nthe family library, or serving as toys for children in the nursery; ...\r\ncrowded into cupboards, thrown into cellars, stowed away in lofts,\r\nexposed to the action of water, the sun, and of fire, or more frequently\r\nlocked away into darkness unrelieved and silence unbroken.\" [2 Pub. Lib.\r\nof U.S. i. 40.]\r\n\r\nThis graphic picture of the failure of the system in New York is perhaps\r\nmatched by a similar picture of its failure in Michigan, as drawn by our\r\nsuperintendent of education in 1869:\r\n\r\n\"The books were distributed to the districts by the town clerk to be\r\nreturned by the directors every third month for exchange. This would now\r\nrequire more than 60,000 miles' travel per annum, at a positive expense\r\nto the directors, certainly, of $100,000, to say nothing of more than\r\n10,000 days' time. This was like putting two locomotives ahead of each\r\nother to draw a hand-car. The result was the books were generally hidden\r\naway in the clerks' offices, like monks in their cloister, and valueless\r\nto the world. And what kind of books were they? Some good ones,\r\ndoubtless; but generally it was better to sow oats in the dust that\r\ncovered those books than to give them to the young to read. Every year,\r\nsoon after the taxes were collected, the state swarmed with pedlers,\r\nwith all the unsalable books of Eastern houses--the sensational novels\r\nof all ages, tales of piracies, murders, and love intrigues--the\r\nyellow-covered literature of the world.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, the superintendent for 1873 says: \"The whole system seems to\r\nhave come into general disfavor; and is, more than any other feature of\r\nour school system, the one of which we are least proud.\"\r\n\r\nNow we come to the fifth stage in the evolution of libraries--that of\r\nlibraries fully endowed by private generosity, and thrown open to the\r\npublic on such conditions as the founders have been pleased to indicate;\r\nsometimes called patronymic libraries. Notable specimens of this class\r\nof libraries are the Astor, Cooper, and Lenox Libraries, of New York,\r\nand the Peabody Library, of Baltimore. The note of this species of\r\nlibrary is this: it is for the use of the public entirely without cost\r\nto the public. In short, it is a library completely endowed, not only as\r\nto the original expense of its erection and equipment, but absolutely\r\nfor all subsequent expense in its increase and administration.\r\nConcerning this species of library, I have this to say: It is a noble\r\nuse to make of private wealth; it does immense good; but it is not the\r\nbest final form of library evolution. And for two reasons: first, the\r\nman who will completely endow a free public library does not arise in\r\nevery community; whereas, every community needs a free public library.\r\nAnd, second, the wholesomest kind of a gift is not that which does it\r\nall for the community and requires no exertion or sacrifice on their\r\npart; but that which gives the community a good generous start, but\r\nstill leaves something for the community to do for itself. In other\r\nwords, the healthiest sort of help, whether for one man or for ten\r\nthousand, is that help which helps a man to help himself.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us to the sixth and final form of library development.\r\nIt is the one which is the resultant of the two grand ideas; primarily,\r\nthe recognition of the free public library as an essential part of the\r\nsystem of public education and therefore as a legitimate subject for\r\npublic taxation. This idea is essential to the most satisfactory form of\r\na public library--the public must invest something in it. But this idea\r\ncan adjust itself to that other noble one--private liberality in aid of\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nAnd it is in this final and most consummate form, combining private\r\nhelp with public selfhelp, that many of the most successful libraries in\r\nthis country have been organized; and yet it is only since 1848 that\r\nsuch libraries have been possible. For it was in 1848 that the first\r\nstate in our Union, Massachusetts, passed an act authorizing a\r\nmunicipality to tax itself for the support of a free public library.\r\nSince then many other states have followed with similar legislation. So\r\nthat it is only within the past thirty-five years that this grand result\r\nhas been reached: the systematic popularization of books under the\r\ndirection of the municipality, partially at least at the public expense,\r\nand often in combination with private benefaction.\r\n\r\nNow, it is this grand result that you have reached here in West Bay\r\nCity. The library which you to-day dedicate to the perpetual service of\r\nthe people, and which we may believe will continue as long as society\r\nlasts here to do its serene and beneficient work for the instruction and\r\ndelight of innumerable generations of mankind--this library represents\r\nthe latest, and I think we may say the most perfect and the final term\r\nin a process of library evolution, which has been going forward on this\r\ncontinent for more than two hundred years, and has involved, as we have\r\nseen, countless struggles and failures and sacrifices for the production\r\nof this single result.\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, may I venture to express the hope that this study\r\nwhich we have now made of the process--the slow, costly, laborious\r\nprocess--by which this brilliant result has been made possible and easy\r\nfor you, in West Bay City, is something which will enhance even your\r\npleasure in the acquisition of this noble library as well as your\r\nappreciation of the princely act of Mr. Sage in his creative relation to\r\nit?\r\n\r\nI trust it may enhance also your feeling of responsibility for the\r\nperpetual success of this library in the purposes for which it has been\r\nformed. This library has been well organized; but the working of it will\r\ndepend upon you. It is on one side of it a business concern; and like\r\nany other business concern it will go to wrack and ruin unless it is\r\nconducted on sound business principles, accurate accounting, sharp\r\nsupervision, punctuality, system, order, promptitude, energy.\r\n\r\nBut more than ordinary business qualities are needed to make this\r\nlibrary all that it should be. Recognize the true function of the free\r\npublic library; it is a part of a large system of public education. It\r\nis but a co-ordinate department of that larger institution for public\r\neducation--the people's university--including the ward schools and the\r\nhigh schools. Some of the fruitfullest and best work of those schools\r\nwill be done in this library.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the public library stands for the wholesome truth that\r\neducation is never finished and should not stop when one stops going to\r\nschool. The boy and the girl who graduate at the school do not desert\r\nthe library; they keep up and carry forward their intellectual training\r\nby a post-graduate course in the public library, for the rest of their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the free public library supplements the work of the free\r\npublic schools by reaching those whom the schools never reached at all,\r\nor only reached very slightly.\r\n\r\nAnd that public library is never a complete success, in which is not\r\npresent in the officers a spirit of courtesy toward readers, of\r\nsympathy, of cheerfulness, of patience, even of helpfulness. Don't\r\npermit your library ever to be a dismal, bibliographical cave, in charge\r\nof a dragon. Let it always be a bright and winsome place, hospitable to\r\nall orderly people; a place where even those ill-informed about books\r\nwill not be made embarrassed, but encouraged. Let it be one of the most\r\nattractive places in town; let it outshine in attractiveness the vulgar\r\nand harmful attractions of the bar-room and the gambling den; let it\r\ngrow up into the best life of the community, a place resorted to by all,\r\nloved by all, a blessing to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY AS A FIELD FOR PHILANTHROPY\r\n\r\n\r\n    At a dinner given to Andrew Carnegie by the Authors' League\r\n    in New York, he said: \"They say I am a philanthropist. I am\r\n    no such foolish fellow.\" Nevertheless, to the _North\r\n    American Review_ for December, 1889, he contributed an\r\n    article, entitled \"The Best Fields for Philanthropy,\" in\r\n    which he gives the Library first place. It is of course\r\n    impossible to tell whether the title was his or a suggestion\r\n    of the editor. The extract printed here is interesting as\r\n    embodying Mr. Carnegie's gospel of \"help by self-help,\" but\r\n    also as giving credit to Enoch Pratt of Baltimore as an\r\n    earlier exponent of it.\r\n\r\n    Andrew Carnegie was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, Nov. 25,\r\n    1835. He was brought by his family to Pittsburgh, Pa. as a\r\n    boy of 13, and after working as a weaver's assistant and a\r\n    telegraph messenger boy, became an operator, rose to be head\r\n    of his division, made money by organizing a sleeping-car\r\n    company and after the Civil War became an ironmaster,\r\n    retiring in 1901 as a multi-millionaire. Much of his fortune\r\n    he gave to build libraries, almost always on the condition\r\n    that the municipality should assure them a stated support.\r\n    He died in New York, Aug. 11, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe reception given to the first paper[1] upon this subject, to which\r\nour lamented friend, the late editor and proprietor of this _Review_,\r\nwas pleased to give the first place in the June number, has been most\r\nencouraging to its author, as it would surely have been to the editor\r\nhad he been spared, for he was most deeply interested in the subject.\r\n\r\n[1] \"Wealth\" by Andrew Carnegie. In the North American Review, June,\r\n1889.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the question which you have proposed, it may be\r\nadvantageous to restate the positions taken in the former paper, for the\r\nbenefit of those who may not have read it, or who cannot conveniently\r\nrefer to it. It was assumed that the present laws of competition,\r\naccumulation, and distribution are the best obtainable conditions; that\r\nthrough these the race receives its most valuable fruits; and,\r\ntherefore, that they should be accepted and upheld. Under these it was\r\nheld that great wealth must inevitably flow into the hands of the few\r\nexceptional managers of men. The question then arose, What should these\r\ndo with their surplus wealth? and the \"Gospel of Wealth\" contended that\r\nsurplus wealth should be considered as a sacred trust, to be\r\nadministered during the lives of its owners, by them as trustees, for\r\nthe best good of the community in which and from which it had been\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out that there were but three modes of disposing of\r\nsurplus wealth, and two of these were held to be improper. First, it was\r\nheld that to leave great fortunes to children did not prove true\r\naffection for them or interest in their genuine good, regarded either as\r\nindividuals or as members of the state; that it was not the welfare of\r\nthe children, but the pride of the parents, which inspired enormous\r\nlegacies, and that, looking to the usual results of vast sums conferred\r\nupon children, the thoughtful man must be forced to say, if the good of\r\nthe child only were considered: \"I would as soon leave to my son a curse\r\nas to leave to him the almighty dollar.\"\r\n\r\nThe second mode open to men is to hoard their surplus wealth during\r\nlife, and leave it at death for public uses. It was pointed out that in\r\nmany cases these bequests become merely monuments of the testators'\r\nfolly; that the amount of real good done by posthumous gifts was\r\nridiculously disproportionate to the sums thus left. The recent decision\r\nupon Mr. Tilden's will, which is said to have been drawn by the ablest\r\nof lawyers, and the partial failure of Mr. Williamson's purposes in\r\nregard to the great technical school which that millionaire intended to\r\nestablish in Philadelphia, are lessons indeed for the rich who only\r\nbequeath.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the first article was thus to lead up to the conclusion that\r\nthere is but one right mode of using enormous fortunes--namely, that the\r\npossessors from time to time during their own lives so administer them\r\nas to promote the permanent good of the communities from which they have\r\nbeen gathered. It was held that public sentiment would soon say of one\r\nwho died possessed of millions of available wealth which he might have\r\nadministered: \"The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this article is to present some of the best methods of\r\nperforming this duty of administering surplus wealth for the good of the\r\npeople. The first requisite for a really good use of wealth by the\r\nmillionaire who has accepted the gospel which proclaims him only a\r\ntrustee of the surplus that comes to him, is to take care that the\r\npurpose for which he spends it shall not have a degrading, pauperizing\r\ntendency upon its recipients, and that his trust should be so\r\nadministered as to stimulate the best and most aspiring poor of the\r\ncommunity to further efforts for their own improvement. It is not the\r\nirreclaimably destitute, shiftless, and worthless that it is truly\r\nbeneficial or truly benevolent to attempt to reach and improve. For\r\nthese there exists the refuge provided by the city or the state, where\r\nthey can be sheltered, fed, clothed, and kept in comfortable existence,\r\nand--most important of all--where they can be isolated from the\r\nwell-doing and industrious poor, who are liable to be demoralized by\r\ncontact with these unfortunates. One man or woman who succeeds in living\r\ncomfortably by begging is more dangerous to society, and a greater\r\nobstacle to the progress of humanity, than a score of wordy Socialists.\r\nThe individual administrator of surplus wealth has as his charge the\r\nindustrious and ambitious; not those who need everything done for them,\r\nbut those who, being most anxious and able to help themselves, deserve\r\nand will be benefited by help from others and the extension of their\r\nopportunities at the hands of the philanthropic rich.\r\n\r\nIt is ever to be remembered that one of the chief obstacles which the\r\nphilanthropist meets in his efforts to do real and permanent good in\r\nthis world is the practice of indiscriminate giving; and the duty of the\r\nmillionaire is to resolve to cease giving to objects that are not proved\r\nclearly to his satisfaction to be deserving. He must remember Mr. Rice's\r\nbelief, that nine hundred and fifty out of every thousand dollars\r\nbestowed to-day upon so-called charity had better be thrown into the\r\nsea. As far as my experience of the wealthy extends, it is unnecessary\r\nto urge them to give of their superabundance in charity so-called.\r\nGreater good for the race is to be achieved by inducing them to cease\r\nimpulsive and injurious giving. As a rule, the sins of millionaires in\r\nthis respect are not those of omission, but of commission, because they\r\nwill not take time to think, and chiefly because it is much easier to\r\ngive than to refuse. Those who have surplus wealth give millions every\r\nyear which produce more evil than good, and which really retard the\r\nprogress of the people, because most of the forms in vogue to-day for\r\nbenefiting mankind only tend to spread among the poor a spirit of\r\ndependence upon alms, when what is essential for progress is that they\r\nshould be inspired to depend upon their own exertions. The miser\r\nmillionaire who hoards his wealth does less injury to society than the\r\ncareless millionaire who squanders his unwisely, even if he does so\r\nunder cover of the mantle of sacred charity. The man who gives to the\r\nindividual beggar commits a grave offence, but there are many societies\r\nand institutions soliciting alms which it is none the less injurious to\r\nthe community to aid. These are as corrupting as individual beggars.\r\nPlutarch's \"Morals\" contains this lesson: \"A beggar asking an alms of a\r\nLacedaemonian, he said: 'Well, should I give thee anything, thou wilt be\r\nthe greater beggar, for he that first gave thee money made thee idle,\r\nand is the cause of this base and dishonorable way of living.'\" As I\r\nknow them, there are few millionaires, very few indeed, who are clear of\r\nthis sin of having made beggars.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind these considerations, let us endeavor to present some of\r\nthe best uses to which a millionaire can devote the surplus of which he\r\nshould regard himself as only the trustee.\r\n\r\n_First_--Standing apart by itself there is the founding of a university\r\nby men enormously rich, such men as must necessarily be few in any\r\ncountry. Perhaps the greatest sum ever given by an individual for any\r\npurpose is the gift of Senator Stanford, who undertakes to establish\r\nupon the Pacific coast, where he amassed his enormous fortune, a\r\ncomplete university, which is said to involve the expenditure of ten\r\nmillions of dollars, and upon which he may be expected to bestow twenty\r\nmillions of his surplus. He is to be envied. A thousand years hence some\r\norator, speaking his praise upon the then crowded shores of the Pacific,\r\nmay repeat Griffith's eulogy of Wolsey, \"In bestowing he was most\r\nprincely: ever witness for him this great seat of learning.\" Here is a\r\nnoble use of wealth.\r\n\r\nWe have many such institutions, Hopkins, Cornell, Packer, and others,\r\nbut most of these have only been bequeathed, and it is impossible to\r\nextol any man greatly for simply leaving what he cannot take with him.\r\nCooper, and Pratt, and Stanford, and others of this class deserve credit\r\nand the admiration of their fellows as much for the time and the\r\nattention given during their lives, as for their expenditure, upon their\r\nrespective monuments.\r\n\r\nWe cannot have the Pacific coast in mind without recalling another\r\nimportant work of a different character which has recently been\r\nestablished there, the Lick Observatory. If any millionaire be\r\ninterested in the ennobling study of astronomy,--and there should be and\r\nwould be such if they but gave the subject the slightest\r\nattention,--here is an example which could well be followed, for the\r\nprogress made in astronomical instruments and appliances is so great and\r\ncontinuous that every few years a new telescope might be judiciously\r\ngiven to one of the observatories upon this continent, the last being\r\nalways the largest and the best, and certain to carry further and\r\nfurther the knowledge of the universe and of our relation to it here\r\nupon the earth. As one among many of the good deeds of the late Mr.\r\nThaw, of Pittsburg, his constant support of the observatory there may be\r\nmentioned. This observatory enabled Professor Langley to make his\r\nwonderful discoveries. The professor is now at the head of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, a worthy successor to Professor Henry.\r\nConnected with him was Mr. Brashear, of Pittsburg, whose instruments are\r\nin most of the principal observatories of the world. He was a common\r\nmillwright, but Mr. Thaw recognized his genius and was his main support\r\nthrough trying days. This common workman has been made a professor by\r\none of the foremost scientific bodies of the world. In applying part of\r\nhis surplus in aiding these two now famous men, the millionaire Thaw did\r\na noble work. Their joint labors have brought great, and are destined to\r\nbring still greater, credit upon their country in every scientific\r\ncentre throughout the world.\r\n\r\nIt is reserved for very few to found universities, and, indeed, the use\r\nfor many, or perhaps any, new universities does not exist. More good is\r\nhenceforth to be accomplished by adding to and extending those in\r\nexistence. But in this department a wide field remains for the\r\nmillionaire as distinguished from the Croesus among milionaires. The\r\ngifts to Yale University have been many, but there is plenty of room for\r\nothers. The School of Fine Arts, founded by Mr. Street, the Sheffield\r\nScientific School, endowed by Mr. Sheffield, and Professor Loomis's fund\r\nfor the observatory, are fine examples. Mrs. C.J. Osborne's building for\r\nreading and recitation to be regarded with especial pleasure as being\r\nthe wise gift of a woman. Harvard University has not been forgotten; the\r\nPeabody Museum, and the halls of Wells, Matthews, and Thayer may be\r\ncited. Sever Hall is worthy of special mention, as showing what a genius\r\nlike Richardson could do with the small sum of a hundred thousand\r\ndollars. The Vanderbilt University at Nashville, Tennessee, may be\r\nmentioned as a true product of the gospel of wealth. It was established\r\nby members of the Vanderbilt family during their lives--mark this vital\r\nfeature--during their lives; for nothing counts for much that is left by\r\na man at his death. Such funds are torn from him, not given by him. If\r\nany millionaire is at a loss to know how to accomplish great and\r\nindisputable good with his surplus, here is a field which can never be\r\nfully occupied, for the wants of our universities increase with the\r\ndevelopment of the country.\r\n\r\n_Second_--The result of my own study of the question, What is the best\r\ngift which can be given to a community? is that a free library occupies\r\nthe first place, provided the community will accept and maintain it as a\r\npublic institution, as much a part of the city property as its public\r\nschools, and, indeed, an adjunct to these. It is, no doubt, possible\r\nthat my own personal experience may have led me to value a free library\r\nbeyond all other forms of beneficence. When I was a boy in Pittsburg,\r\nColonel Anderson, of Allegheny,--a name I can never speak without\r\nfeelings of devotional gratitude,--opened his little library of four\r\nhundred books to boys. Every Saturday afternoon he was in attendance\r\nhimself at his house to exchange books. No one but he who has felt it\r\ncan know the intense longing with which the arrival of Saturday was\r\nawaited, that a new book might be had. My brother and Mr. Phipps, who\r\nhave been my principal business partners through life, shared with me\r\nColonel Anderson's precious generosity, and it was when revelling in\r\nthese treasures that I resolved, if ever wealth came to me, that it\r\nshould be used to establish free libraries, that other poor boys might\r\nreceive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to\r\nthat noble man.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has been foremost in appreciating the value of free\r\nlibraries for its people. Parliament passed an act permitting towns and\r\ncities to establish and maintain these as municipal institutions, and\r\nwhenever the people of any town or city voted to accept the provisions\r\nof the act, the authorities were authorized to tax the community to the\r\nextent of one penny in the pound valuation. Most of the towns already\r\nhave free libraries under this act. Many of these are the gifts of rich\r\nmen, whose funds have been used for the building, and in some cases for\r\nthe books also, the communities being required to maintain and to\r\ndevelop the libraries; and to this feature I attribute most of their\r\nusefulness. An endowed institution is liable to become the prey of a\r\nclique. The public ceases to take interest, in it, or, rather, never\r\nacquires interest in it. The rule has been violated which requires the\r\nrecipients to help themselves. Everything has been done for the\r\ncommunity instead of its being only helped to help itself.\r\n\r\nMany free libraries have been established in our country, but none that\r\nI know of with such wisdom as the Pratt Library, of Baltimore. Mr. Pratt\r\npresented to the city of Baltimore one million dollars, requiring it to\r\npay 5 per cent. per annum, amounting to fifty thousand dollars per year,\r\nwhich is to be devoted to the maintenance and development of the library\r\nand its branches. During the last year 430,217 books were distributed;\r\n37,196 people of Baltimore are registered upon the books as readers; and\r\nit is safe to say that 37,000 frequenters of the Pratt Library are of\r\nmore value to Baltimore, to the State, and to the country than all the\r\ninert, lazy, and hopelessly-poor in the whole nation. And it may further\r\nbe safely said that, by placing within the reach of 37,000 aspiring\r\npeople books which they were anxious to obtain, Mr. Pratt has done more\r\nfor the genuine progress of the people than has been done by all the\r\ncontributions of all the millionaires and rich people to help those who\r\ncannot help themselves. The one wise administrator of his surplus has\r\npoured his fertilizing stream upon soil that was ready to receive it and\r\nreturn a hundred-fold. The many squanderers have not only poured their\r\nstreams into sieves which never can be filled,--they have done worse;\r\nthey have poured them into stagnant sewers that breed the diseases which\r\nafflict the body politic. And this is not all. The million dollars of\r\nwhich Mr. Pratt has made so grand a use are something, but there is\r\nsomething greater still. When the fifth branch library was opened in\r\nBaltimore, the speaker said:\r\n\r\n    \"Whatever may have been done in these four years, it was his\r\n    pleasure to acknowledge that much, very much, was due to the\r\n    earnest interest, the wise councils, and the practical\r\n    suggestions of Mr. Pratt. He never seemed to feel that the\r\n    mere donation of great wealth for the benefit of his\r\n    fellow-citizens was all that would be asked of him, but he\r\n    wisely labored to make its application as comprehensive and\r\n    effective as possible. Thus he constantly lightened burdens\r\n    that were, at times, very heavy, brought good cheer and\r\n    bright sunshine when clouds flitted across the sky, and made\r\n    every officer and employee feel that good work was\r\n    appreciated, and loyal devotion to duty would receive hearty\r\n    commendation.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the finest picture I have ever seen of any of the millionaire\r\nclass. As here depicted, Mr. Pratt is the ideal disciple of the \"Gospel\r\nof Wealth.\" We need have no fear that the mass of toilers will fail to\r\nrecognize in such as he their best leaders and their most invaluable\r\nallies; for the problem of poverty and wealth, of employer and employed,\r\nwill be practically solved whenever the time of the few is given, and\r\ntheir wealth is administered during their lives, for the best good of\r\nthat portion of the community which has not been burdened by the\r\nresponsibilities which attend the possession of wealth. We shall have no\r\nantagonism between classes when that day comes, for the high and the\r\nlow, the rich and the poor, shall then indeed be brothers.\r\n\r\nNo millionaire will go far wrong in his search for one of the best forms\r\nfor the use of his surplus who chooses to establish a free library in\r\nany community that is willing to maintain and develop it. John Bright's\r\nwords should ring in his ear: \"It is impossible for any man to bestow a\r\ngreater benefit upon a young man than to give him access to books in a\r\nfree library.\" Closely allied to the library, and, where possible,\r\nattached to it, there should be rooms for an art gallery and museum, and\r\na hall for such lectures and instruction as are provided in the Cooper\r\nUnion. The traveller upon the Continent is surprised to find that every\r\ntown of importance has its art gallery and museum; these may be large or\r\nsmall, but in any case each has a receptacle for the treasures of the\r\nlocality, which is constantly receiving valuable gifts and bequests. The\r\nfree library and art gallery of Birmingham are remarkable among these,\r\nand every now and then a rich man adds to their value by presenting\r\nbooks, fine pictures, or other works of art. All that our cities require\r\nto begin with is a proper fireproof building. Their citizens who travel\r\nwill send to it rare and costly things from every quarter of the globe\r\nthey visit, while those who remain at home will give or bequeath to it\r\nof their treasures. In this way these collections will grow until our\r\ncities will ultimately be able to boast of permanent exhibitions from\r\nwhich their own citizens will derive incalculable benefit, and which\r\nthey will be proud to show to visitors. In the Metropolitan Museum of\r\nArt in this city we have made an excellent beginning. Here is another\r\navenue for the proper use of surplus wealth.\r\n\r\n_Third_--We have another most important department in which great sums\r\ncan be worthily used,--the founding or extension of hospitals, medical\r\ncolleges, laboratories, and other institutions connected with the\r\nalleviation of human suffering, and especially with the prevention\r\nrather than the cure of human ills. There is no danger of pauperizing a\r\ncommunity in giving for such purposes, because such institutions relieve\r\ntemporary ailments or shelter only those who are hopeless invalids. What\r\nbetter gift than a hospital can be given to a community that is without\r\none?--the gift being conditioned upon its proper maintenance by the\r\ncommunity in its corporate capacity. If hospital accommodation already\r\nexists, no better method for using surplus wealth can be found than in\r\nmaking additions to it. The late Mr. Vanderbilt's gift of half a million\r\nof dollars to the medical department of Columbia College for a chemical\r\nlaboratory was one of the wisest possible uses of wealth. It strikes at\r\nthe prevention of disease by penetrating into its causes. Several others\r\nhave established such laboratories, but the need for them is still\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nIf there be a millionaire in the land who is at a loss what to do with\r\nthe surplus that has been committed to him as trustee, let him\r\ninvestigate the good that is flowing from these chemical laboratories.\r\nNo medical college is complete without its laboratory. As with\r\nuniversities, so with medical colleges; it is not new institutions that\r\nare required, but additional means for the more thorough equipment of\r\nthose that exist. The forms that benefactions to these may wisely take\r\nare numerous, but probably none is more useful than that adopted by Mr.\r\nOsborne when he built a school for training female nurses at Bellevue\r\nCollege. If from all gifts there flows one-half of the good that comes\r\nfrom this wise use of a millionaire's surplus, the most exacting may\r\nwell be satisfied. Only those who have passed through a lingering and\r\ndangerous illness can rate at their true value the care, skill, and\r\nattendance of trained female nurses. Their employment as nurses has\r\nenlarged the sphere and influence of woman. It is not to be wondered at\r\nthat a Senator of the United States and a physician distinguished in\r\nthis country for having received the highest distinctions abroad should\r\nfind their wives from this class.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_--In the very front rank of benefactions public parks should be\r\nplaced, always provided that the community undertakes to maintain,\r\nbeautify, and preserve inviolate the parks given to it. No more useful\r\nor more beautiful monument can be left by any man than a park for the\r\ncity in which he was born or in which he has long lived, nor can the\r\ncommunity pay a more graceful tribute to the citizen who presents it\r\nthan to give his name to the gift. If a park be already provided, there\r\nis still room for many judicious gifts in connection with it. Mr.\r\nPhipps, of Allegheny, has given conservatories to the park there, which\r\nare visited by many every day of the week, and crowded by thousands of\r\nworking people every Sunday, for, with rare wisdom, he has stipulated as\r\na condition of the gift that the conservatories shall be open on\r\nSundays. The result of his experiment has been so gratifying that he is\r\njustified in adding to them from his surplus, as he is doing largely\r\nthis year. To any lover of flowers among the wealthy I commend a study\r\nof what is possible for them to do in the light of Mr. Phipps's example;\r\nand may they please note that Mr. Phipps is a wise as well as a liberal\r\ngiver, for he requires the city to maintain these conservatories, and\r\nthus secures for them forever the public ownership, the public interest,\r\nand the public criticism of their management. Had he undertaken to\r\nmanage and maintain them, it is probable that popular interest in the\r\ngift would never have been awakened.\r\n\r\nThe parks and pleasure-grounds of small towns throughout Europe are not\r\nless surprising than their libraries, museums, and art galleries. We saw\r\nnothing more pleasing during our recent travels than the hillside of\r\nBergen, in Norway. It has been converted into one of the most\r\npicturesque of pleasure-grounds; fountains, cascades, water-falls,\r\ndelightful arbors, fine terraces, and statues adorn what was before a\r\nbarren mountain side. Here is a field worthy of study by the millionaire\r\nwho would confer a lasting benefit upon his fellows. Another beautiful\r\ninstance of the right use of wealth in the direction of making cities\r\nmore and more attractive we found in Dresden. The owner of the leading\r\npaper there bequeathed its revenues forever to the city, to be used in\r\nbeautifying it. An art committee decides from time to time what new\r\nartistic feature is to be introduced or what hideous feature is to be\r\nchanged, and as the revenues accrue they are expended in this direction.\r\nThus through the gift of this patriotic newspaper proprietor his native\r\ncity of Dresden is fast becoming one of the most artistic places of\r\nresidence in the whole world. A work having been completed, it devolves\r\nupon the city to maintain it forever. May I be excused if I commend to\r\nour millionaire newspaper proprietors the example of their colleague in\r\nthe capital of Saxony?\r\n\r\nScarcely a city of any magnitude in the older countries is without many\r\nstructures and features of great beauty. Much has been spent upon\r\nornament, decoration, and architectural effect: we are still far behind\r\nin these things upon this side of the Atlantic. Our Republic is great in\r\nsome things,--in material development unrivalled; but let us always\r\nremember that in art and in the finer touches we have scarcely yet taken\r\na place. Had the exquisite memorial arch recently erected temporarily in\r\nNew York been shown in Dresden, the art committee there would probably\r\nhave been enabled, from the revenue of the newspaper given by its owner\r\nfor just such purposes, to order its permanent erection to adorn the\r\ncity forever.\r\n\r\nWhile the bestowal of a park upon a community as one of the best uses\r\nfor surplus wealth will be universally approved, in embracing such\r\nadditions to it as conservatories, or in advocating the building of\r\nmemorial arches and works of adornment, it is probable that many will\r\nthink we go too far, and consider these somewhat fanciful. The material\r\ngood to flow from them may not be so directly visible; but let not any\r\npractical mind, intent only upon material good, depreciate the value of\r\nwealth given for these or for kindred aesthetic purposes as being\r\nuseless as far as the mass of the people and their needs are concerned.\r\nAs with libraries and museums, so with these more distinctively artistic\r\nworks; these perform their great use when they reach the best of the\r\nmasses of the people. It is worth more to reach and touch the sentiment\r\nfor beauty in the naturally bright minds of this class than that those\r\nincapable of being so touched should be pandered to. For what the\r\nimprover of the race must endeavor to do is to reach those who have the\r\ndivine spark ever so feebly developed, that it may be strengthened and\r\ngrow. For my part, I think Mr. Phipps put his money to better use in\r\ngiving the workingmen of Allegheny conservatories filled with beautiful\r\nflowers, orchids, and aquatic plants, which they, with their wives and\r\nchildren, can enjoy in their spare hours, and on which they can feed the\r\nlove for the beautiful, than if he had given his surplus money to\r\nfurnish them with bread, for those in health who cannot earn their bread\r\nare scarcely worth considering by the individual giver; the care of such\r\nbeing the duty of the state. The man who erects in a city a truly\r\nartistic arch, statue, or fountain makes a wise use of his surplus. \"Man\r\ndoes not live by bread alone.\"\r\n\r\n_Fifth_--We have another good use for surplus wealth, in providing for\r\nour cities halls suitable for meetings of all kinds, especially for\r\nconcerts of elevating music. Our cities are rarely provided with halls\r\nfor these purposes, being in this respect also very far behind European\r\ncities. The Springer Hall, of Cincinnati, that valuable addition to the\r\ncity, was largely the gift of Mr. Springer, who was not content to\r\nbequeath funds from his estate at death, but who gave during his life,\r\nand, in addition, gave--what was equally important--his time and\r\nbusiness ability to insure the successful results which have been\r\nachieved. The gift of a hall to any city lacking one is an excellent use\r\nfor surplus wealth for the good of a community. The reason why the\r\npeople have only one instructive and elevating, or even amusing,\r\nentertainment when a dozen would be highly beneficial, is that the rent\r\nof a hall, even when a suitable hall exists (which is rare), is so great\r\nas to prevent managers from running the risk of financial failure. If\r\nevery city in our land owned a hall which could be given or rented for a\r\nsmall sum for such gatherings as a committee or the mayor of the city\r\njudged advantageous, the people could be furnished with proper lectures,\r\namusements, and concerts at an exceedingly small cost. The town halls of\r\nEuropean cities, many of which have organs, are of inestimable value to\r\nthe people, when utilized as they are in the manner suggested. Let no\r\none underrate the influence of entertainments of an elevating or even of\r\nan amusing character, for these do much to make the lives of the people\r\nhappier and their natures better. If any millionaire born in a small\r\nvillage, which has now become a great city, is prompted in the day of\r\nhis success to do something for his birthplace with part of his surplus,\r\nhis grateful remembrance cannot take a form more useful than that of a\r\npublic hall with an organ, provided the city agrees to maintain and use\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Sixth_--In another respect we are still much behind Europe. A form of\r\nbeneficence which is not uncommon there is providing swimming baths for\r\nthe people. The donors of these have been wise enough to require the\r\ncity benefited to maintain them at its own expense, and as proof of the\r\ncontention that everything should never be done for any one or for any\r\ncommunity, but that the recipients should invariably be called upon to\r\ndo part, it is significant that it is found essential for the popular\r\nsuccess of these healthful establishments to exact a nominal charge for\r\ntheir use. In many cities, however, the school children are admitted\r\nfree at fixed hours upon certain days, different hours being fixed for\r\nthe boys and the girls to use the great swimming baths, hours or days\r\nbeing also fixed for the use of these baths by ladies. In inland cities\r\nthe young of both sexes are thus taught to swim. Swimming clubs are\r\norganized, and matches are frequent, at which medals and prizes are\r\ngiven. The reports published by the various swimming baths throughout\r\nGreat Britain are filled with instances of lives saved because those who\r\nfortunately escaped ship-wreck had been taught to swim in the baths, and\r\nnot a few instances are given in which the pupils of certain bathing\r\nestablishments have saved the lives of others. If any disciple of the\r\n\"Gospel of Wealth\" gives his favorite city large swimming and private\r\nbaths (provided the municipality undertakes their management as a city\r\naffair), he will never be called to account for an improper use of the\r\nfunds intrusted to him.\r\n\r\n_Seventh_--Churches as fields for the use of surplus wealth have\r\npurposely been reserved until the last, because, these being sectarian,\r\nevery man will be governed by his own attachments; therefore gifts to\r\nchurches, it may be said, are not, in one sense, gifts to the community\r\nat large, but to special classes. Nevertheless, every millionaire may\r\nknow of a district where the little cheap, uncomfortable, and altogether\r\nunworthy wooden structure stands at the cross-roads, to which the whole\r\nneighborhood gathers on Sunday, and which is the centre of social life\r\nand source of neighborly feeling. The administrator of wealth has made a\r\ngood use of part of his surplus if he replaces that building with a\r\npermanent structure of brick, stone, or granite, up the sides of which\r\nthe honeysuckle and columbine may climb, and from whose tower the\r\nsweet-tolling bell may sound. The millionaire should not figure how\r\ncheaply this structure can be built, but how perfect it can be made. If\r\nhe has the money, it should be made a gem, for the educating influence\r\nof a pure and noble specimen of architecture, built, as the pyramids\r\nwere built, to stand for ages, is not to be measured by dollars. Every\r\nfarmer's home, heart, and mind in the district will be influenced by the\r\nbeauty and grandeur of the church. But having given the building, the\r\ndonor should stop there; the support of the church should be upon its\r\nown people; there is not much genuine religion in the congregation or\r\nmuch good to flow from the church which is not supported at home.\r\n\r\nMany other avenues for the wise expenditure of surplus wealth might be\r\nindicated. I enumerate but a few--a very few--of the many fields which\r\nare open, and only these in which great or considerable sums can be\r\njudiciously used. It is not the privilege, however, of millionaires\r\nalone to work for or aid measures which are certain to benefit the\r\ncommunity. Every one who has but a small surplus above his moderate\r\nwants may share this privilege with his richer brothers, and those\r\nwithout surplus can give at least part of their time, which is usually\r\nas important as funds, and often more so. Some day, perhaps, with your\r\npermission, I will endeavor to point out some fields and modes in which\r\nthese may perform well their part as trustees of wealth, or leisure,\r\naccording to the measure of their respective fortunes.\r\n\r\nIt is not expected, neither is it desirable, that there should be a\r\ngeneral concurrence as to the best possible use of surplus wealth. For\r\ndifferent men and different localities there are different uses. What\r\ncommends itself more highly to the judgment of the administrator is the\r\nbest use for him, for his heart should be in the work. It is as\r\nimportant in administering wealth as it is in any other branch of a\r\nman's work that he should be enthusiastically devoted to it and feel\r\nthat in the field selected his work lies.\r\n\r\nBesides this, there is room and need for all kinds of wise benefactions\r\nfor the common weal. The man who builds a university, library, or\r\nlaboratory performs no more useful work than he who elects to devote\r\nhimself and his surplus means to the adornment of a park, the gathering\r\ntogether of a collection of pictures for the public, or the building of\r\na memorial arch. These are all true laborers in the vineyard. The only\r\npoint required by the \"Gospel of Wealth\" is that the surplus which\r\naccrues from time to time in the hands of man should be administered by\r\nhim in his own lifetime for that purpose which is seen by him, as\r\ntrustee, to be best for the good of the people. To leave at death what\r\nhe cannot take away, and place upon others the burden of the work which\r\nit was his own duty to perform, is to do nothing worthy. This requires\r\nno sacrifice, nor any sense of duty to his fellows.\r\n\r\nTime was when the words concerning the rich man entering heaven were\r\nregarded as a hard saying. Today, when all questions are probed to the\r\nbottom and the standards of faith received the most liberal\r\ninterpretations, the startling verse has been relegated to the rear, to\r\nawait the next kindly revision as one of those things which cannot be\r\nquite understood, but which meanwhile--it is carefully to be\r\nobserved--are not to be understood literally. But is it so very\r\nimprobable that the next stage of thought is not to restore the doctrine\r\nin all its pristine purity and force, as being in perfect harmony with\r\nsound ideas upon the subject of wealth and poverty, the rich and the\r\npoor, and the contrasts everywhere seen and deplored? In Christ's day,\r\nit is evident, reformers were against the wealthy. It is none the less\r\nevident that we are fast recurring to that position to-day; and there\r\nwill be nothing to surprise the student of sociological development if\r\nsociety should soon approve the text which has caused so much anxiety:\r\n\"It is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich\r\nman to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.\" Even if the needle were the small\r\ncasement at the gates, the words betoken serious difficulty for the\r\nrich. It will be but a step for the theologian to take from the doctrine\r\nthat he who dies rich dies disgraced to that which brings upon the man\r\npunishment or deprivation hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe \"Gospel of Wealth\" but echoes Christ's words. It calls upon the\r\nmillionaire to sell all that he hath and give it in the highest and best\r\nform to the poor, by administering his estate himself for the good of\r\nhis fellows, before he is called upon to lie down and rest upon the\r\nbosom of Mother Earth. So doing, he will approach his end no longer the\r\nignoble hoarder of useless millions, poor, very poor indeed, in money,\r\nbut rich, very rich, twenty times a millionaire still, in the affection,\r\ngratitude and admiration of his fellow-men, and--sweeter far--soothed\r\nand sustained by the still small voice within, which, whispering, tells\r\nhim that, because he has lived, perhaps one small part of the great\r\nworld has been bettered just a little. This much is sure: against such\r\nriches as these no bar will be found at the gates of Paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDEA OF A POPULAR LIBRARY\r\n\r\n    The following seven papers give some fundamental ideas on\r\n    the functions of popular libraries. They are arranged in\r\n    chronological order, and, so grouped, span the gap between\r\n    1851 and 1906, considerably more than half a century. The\r\n    first is interesting as presenting a discussion at the\r\n    inception of our first great public library, that of the\r\n    city of Boston, quoted from \"The Life, Letters and Journals\r\n    of George Ticknor\" (Boston, 1909). Ticknor's idea of a\r\n    popular library, given in a letter to Edward Everett, is\r\n    followed by Everett's answer. Some of the editor's comments\r\n    precede and conclude. Those interested may read on, in\r\n    Chapter XV, Vol. II of the \"Life,\" and get a further idea of\r\n    Ticknor's zeal in promoting the Boston library and his\r\n    interest in making it as popular as possible, in distinction\r\n    to the idea of a library solely for scholars, upheld by John\r\n    Jacob Astor, in his New York gift of three years previous,\r\n    which Everett rather favored.\r\n\r\n    George Ticknor was born in Boston, Aug. 1, 1791 and\r\n    graduated at Dartmouth in 1807. He was admitted to the bar\r\n    in 1813 but devoted his life chiefly to teaching and to\r\n    literature, serving as professor in Harvard in 1819-35. He\r\n    died in Boston, Jan. 26, 1871. A sketch of Everett appears\r\n    on page 127 of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe endowment of a great library in New York, given by Mr. John Jacob\r\nAstor, at his death, in 1848, was much talked about; and men of forecast\r\nbegan to say openly that, unless something of a like character were done\r\nin Boston, the scientific and literary culture of this part of the\r\ncountry would follow trade and capital to the metropolis, which was thus\r\ntaking the lead. Still, nothing effectual was done. Among the persons\r\nwith whom Mr. Ticknor had, of late years, most frequently talked of the\r\nmatter, Dr. Channing was dead, Mr. Abbott Lawrence had become Minister\r\nto England, and Mr. Jonathan Phillips was growing too infirm to take\r\npart in public affairs. The subject, however, kept its hold on Mr.\r\nTicknor's mind.\r\n\r\nHis idea was that which he felt lay at the foundation of all our public\r\ninstitutions, namely, that in order to form and maintain our character\r\nas a great nation, the mass of the people must be intelligent enough to\r\nmanage their own government with wisdom; and he came, though not at\r\nonce, to the conclusion that a very free use of books, furnished by an\r\ninstitution supported at the expense of the community, would be one of\r\nthe effective means for obtaining this result of general culture.\r\n\r\nHe had reached this conclusion before he saw any probability of its\r\nbeing practically carried out, as is proved by the following letter,\r\nwhich he wrote to Mr. Everett, in the summer of 1851. A few months\r\nbefore this date Mr. Everett had presented to the city--after offering\r\nit in vain more than once--a collection of about a thousand volumes of\r\nPublic Documents, and books of similar character, accompanied by a\r\nletter, urging the establishment of a public library.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To HON. EDWARD EVERETT.\r\n\r\n  Bellows Falls, Vermont, July 14, 1851.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR EVERETT,--I have seen with much gratification from\r\n    time to time, within the last year, and particularly in your\r\n    last letter on the subject, that you interest yourself in\r\n    the establishment of a public library in Boston;--I mean a\r\n    library open to all the citizens, and from which all, under\r\n    proper restrictions, can take out books. Such, at least, I\r\n    understand to be your plan; and I have thought, more than\r\n    once, that I would talk with you about it, but accident has\r\n    prevented it. However, perhaps a letter is as good on all\r\n    accounts, and better as a distinct memorandum of what I\r\n    mean.\r\n\r\n    It has seemed to me, for many years, that such a free\r\n    public library, if adapted to the wants of our people, would\r\n    be the crowning glory of our public schools. But I think it\r\n    important that it should be adapted to our peculiar\r\n    character; that is, that it should come in at the end of our\r\n    system of free instruction, and be fitted to continue and\r\n    increase the effects of that system by the self-culture that\r\n    results from reading.\r\n\r\n    The great obstacle to this with us is not--as it is in\r\n    Prussia and elsewhere--a low condition of the mass of the\r\n    people, condemning them, as soon as they escape from school,\r\n    and often before it, to such severe labor, in order to\r\n    procure the coarsest means of physical subsistence, that\r\n    they have no leisure for intellectual culture, and soon lose\r\n    all taste for it. Our difficulty is, to furnish means\r\n    specially fitted to encourage a love for reading, to create\r\n    an appetite for it, which the schools often fail to do, and\r\n    then to adapt these means to its gratification. That an\r\n    appetite for reading can be very widely excited is plain,\r\n    from what the cheap publications of the last twenty years\r\n    have accomplished, gradually raising the taste from such\r\n    poor trash as the novels with which they began, up to the\r\n    excellent and valuable works of all sorts which now flood\r\n    the country, and are read by the middling classes\r\n    everywhere, and in New England, I think, even by a majority\r\n    of the people.[2]\r\n\r\n    Now what seems to me to be wanted in Boston is, an apparatus\r\n    that shall carry this taste for reading as deep as possible\r\n    into society, assuming, what I believe to be true, that it\r\n    can be carried deeper in our society than in any other in\r\n    the world, because we are better fitted for it. To do this I\r\n    would establish a library which, in its _main_ department\r\n    and purpose, should differ from all free libraries yet\r\n    attempted; I mean one in which any popular books, tending to\r\n    moral and intellectual improvement, should be furnished in\r\n    such numbers of copies that many persons, if they desired\r\n    it, could be reading the same work at the same time; in\r\n    short, that not only the best books of all sorts, but the\r\n    pleasant literature of the day, should be made accessible to\r\n    the whole people at the only time when they care for it,\r\n    _i.e._ when it is fresh and new. I would, therefore,\r\n    continue to buy additional copies of any book of this class,\r\n    almost as long as they should continue to be asked for, and\r\n    thus, by following the popular taste,--unless it should\r\n    demand something injurious,--create a real appetite for\r\n    healthy general reading. This appetite, once formed, will\r\n    take care of itself. It will, in the great majority of\r\n    cases, demand better and better books; and can, I believe,\r\n    by a little judicious help, rather than by any direct\r\n    control or restraint, be carried much higher than is\r\n    generally thought possible.\r\n\r\n[2] Mr. Ticknor was much struck by the publication of a cheap edition\r\nof Johns' Translation of Froissart, by the Harpers, of which he found\r\na copy in a small inn of a retired village of southern New York, in\r\n1844; and he always watched the signs of popular taste, both in\r\npublishers' lists and in the bookshelves of the houses which he\r\nentered, in his summer journeys, or in his errands of business and\r\ncharity in the winter.\r\n\r\nAfter some details, of no present consequence, developing this idea, the\r\nletter goes on:--\r\n\r\n    Nor would I, on this plan, neglect the establishment of a\r\n    department for consultation, and for all the common purposes\r\n    of public libraries, some of whose books, like\r\n    encyclopaedias and dictionaries, should never be lent out,\r\n    while others could be permitted to circulate; all on the\r\n    shelves being accessible for reference as many hours in the\r\n    day as possible, and always in the evening. This part of the\r\n    library, I should hope, would be much increased by donations\r\n    from public-spirited individuals, and individuals interested\r\n    in the progress of knowledge, while, I think, the public\r\n    treasury should provide for the more popular department.\r\n\r\n    Intimations of the want of such public facilities for\r\n    reading are, I think, beginning to be given. In London I\r\n    notice advertisements of some of the larger circulating\r\n    libraries, that they purchase one and two hundred copies of\r\n    all new and popular works; and in Boston, I am told, some of\r\n    our own circulating libraries will purchase almost any new\r\n    book, if the person asking for it will agree to pay double\r\n    the usual fee for reading it; while in all, I think,\r\n    several, and sometimes many copies of new and popular works\r\n    are kept on hand for a time, and then sold, as the demand\r\n    for them dies away.\r\n\r\nOmitting other details, now of no importance, the letter ends as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    Several years ago I proposed to Mr. Abbott Lawrence to move\r\n    in favor of such a library in Boston; and, since that time,\r\n    I have occasionally suggested it to other persons. In every\r\n    case the idea has been well received; and the more I have\r\n    thought of it and talked about it, the more I have been\r\n    persuaded, that it is a plan easy to be reduced to practice,\r\n    and one that would be followed by valuable results.\r\n\r\n    I wish, therefore, that you would consider it, and see what\r\n    objections there are to it. I have no purpose to do anything\r\n    more about it myself than to write you this letter, and\r\n    continue to speak of it, as I have done heretofore, to\r\n    persons who, like yourself, are interested in such matters.\r\n    But I should be well pleased to know how it strikes you.\r\n\r\nTo this letter Mr. Everett replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAMBRIDGE, July 26, 1851.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR TICKNOR,--I duly received your letter of the 14th\r\n    from Bellows Falls, and read it with great interest.\r\n\r\n    The extensive circulation of new and popular works is a\r\n    feature of a public library which I have not hitherto much\r\n    contemplated. It deserves to be well weighed, and I shall be\r\n    happy hereafter to confer with you on the subject. I cannot\r\n    deny that my views have, since my younger days, undergone\r\n    some change as to the practicability of freely loaning books\r\n    at home from large public libraries. Those who have been\r\n    connected with the administration of such libraries are apt\r\n    to get discouraged, by the loss and damage resulting from\r\n    the loan of books. My present impressions are in favor of\r\n    making the amplest provision in the library for the use of\r\n    books there.\r\n\r\n    Your plan, however, is intended to apply only to a\r\n    particular class of books, and does not contemplate the\r\n    unrestrained circulation of those of which the loss could\r\n    not be easily replaced.\r\n\r\n    That Boston must have a great public library, or yield to\r\n    New York in letters as well as in commerce, will, I think,\r\n    be made quite apparent in a few years. But on this and other\r\n    similar subjects I hope to have many opportunities of\r\n    conferring with you next winter.\r\n\r\nThe difference of opinion, here made evident, as to the possibility or\r\nsafety of allowing books to circulate freely, was not removed by many\r\nsubsequent conversations, nor were the hopes of either of the gentlemen,\r\nwith regard to the establishment of a great library, raised even when,\r\nin the early part of 1852, the mayor, Mr. Seaver, recommended that steps\r\nbe taken for such an object, and the Common Council, presided over by\r\nMr. James Lawrence, proposed that a board of trustees for such an\r\ninstitution should be appointed. When, therefore, both Mr. Everett and\r\nMr. Ticknor--the latter greatly to his surprise--were invited to become\r\nmembers of this board, they conferred together anew on the project; and,\r\nalthough the mayor, on hearing Mr. Ticknor's views, was much pleased\r\nwith them, and urged him to take the place, yet he at one time\r\ndetermined to decline the office, certainly unless the library were to\r\nbe open for the free circulation of most of its books, and unless it\r\nwere to be dedicated, in the first instance, rather to satisfying the\r\nwants of the less favored classes of the community, than--like all\r\npublic libraries then in existence--to satisfying the wants of scholars,\r\nmen of science, and cultivated men generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUNCTION OF A TOWN LIBRARY\r\n\r\n    Nearly a quarter-century elapsed after Ticknor's letter,\r\n    just quoted, before the publication in book form of Josiah\r\n    P. Quincy's \"Protection of Majorities and Other Essays\"\r\n    (Boston, 1875), of which collection his paper on the\r\n    function of a town library forms a part. As stated in his\r\n    introduction, it appeared originally in _Old and New_, a\r\n    magazine already extinct when that introduction was penned.\r\n\r\n    While asserting as strongly as Mr. Ticknor his belief in\r\n    making a library \"popular,\" the writer denies that his\r\n    belief justifies the inclusion of fiction. His position\r\n    seems to be that, praiseworthy as much of it is, fiction\r\n    should not be supplied to the public from the public funds.\r\n    The present attitude, that this is a matter to be settled by\r\n    the public itself, is repudiated in set terms and with\r\n    somewhat picturesque illustrations, by Mr. Quincy. His\r\n    stalwart advocacy of the library as a supplement to the\r\n    school is what justifies the inclusion of his paper in this\r\n    collection. Those who desire to follow Mr. Quincy a little\r\n    farther may read the next paper in the above-named\r\n    collection entitled \"The Abuse of Reading.\"\r\n\r\n    Josiah Phillips Quincy was born in Boston, Nov. 28, 1829\r\n    and graduated at Harvard in 1850, the son of the statesman\r\n    Josiah Quincy who was also president of Harvard. He was\r\n    admitted to the bar in 1854, but afterward engaged in\r\n    business and in farming, also writing freely on civic and\r\n    economic subjects.\r\n\r\nThis is a one-sided paper. Something might be said on the other side;\r\nbut, as that is the popular side, it is likely to receive full justice.\r\nIn behalf of an unconverted minority, who should be represented through\r\nthe press, if nowhere else, I desire to register a dissent from the\r\nprevailing opinion concerning the function of libraries sustained by the\r\ntaxation of towns and small municipalities. The importance of\r\nstimulating thought upon subjects bearing ever so remotely upon our\r\nfiscal requirements, I conceive to be far greater than may superficially\r\nappear. For when the mass of our people clearly comprehend what\r\ngovernment should not be called upon to do for them, they will insist\r\nupon its performing duties which are manifestly within its sphere of\r\naction. Laboring men and women are to-day suffering from the\r\nadulteration of their food and drink, and from a system of taxation\r\nwhich oppresses them with weighty and unjust burdens. Their deliverance\r\ncan only come by dismissing legislators who are disciples of what may be\r\ncalled the Todgers school of economy; that remarkable matron, as Dickens\r\ntells us, caring little for the solid sustenance of her boarders,\r\nprovided \"the gravy\" was abundant and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nUpon what principle can the citizen, who thinks before he casts his\r\nballot, justify himself in voting increased taxes upon his neighbors for\r\nthe purpose of establishing a library? He must assume the necessity of\r\npublic schools, and then argue that he may vote for a library that will\r\nsupplement the elementary instruction which the town provides. And the\r\njustification is ample. If our schools are so conducted as to awaken a\r\ntaste for knowledge and give a correct method in English reading, the\r\ntown library may represent the university brought to every man's door.\r\nBut suppose a large portion of the funds taken from tax-payers is\r\ndevoted to circulating ephemeral works of mere amusement. Is it not as\r\nmonstrous for me to vote to tax my neighbor to furnish the boys and\r\ngirls with \"A Terrible Tribulation,\" or \"Lady So-and-So's Struggle,\" as\r\nit would be for the purpose of providing them with free tickets to\r\nwitness \"Article 47\" or \"The Black Crook\"? These romances and dramas (to\r\nrepresent them in the most favorable point of view) are evanescent\r\nproductions, designed to meet the market demand for the intense and\r\nspasmodic. Their claims to patronage from the public purse are precisely\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nSo far, the citizen has a right to object as a tax-payer. But, if he\r\nwere truly solicitous for the welfare of the community about him, the\r\nprotest might be far deeper. For the weak spot in our school system lies\r\njust here: while claiming immense credit for giving most of our children\r\nthe ability to read, we show the profoundest indifference about what\r\nthey read. But this accomplishment of reading is a very doubtful good if\r\nit goes no farther than to give a boy the satisfaction of perusing \"The\r\nPolice Gazette,\" or introduces a girl to the immoralities of Mr.\r\nGriffith Gaunt, and the adventures of a hundred other heroes of\r\ncharacters even more questionable. By teaching our children to read, and\r\nthen setting them adrift in a sea of feverish literature which vitiates\r\nthe taste and enervates the character, we show an indifference about as\r\nsensible as that of the old lady who thought it could not matter whether\r\nher son had gone to the bosom of Abraham or Beelzebub, seeing that they\r\nwere both Scripture names.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to conceive of communities, existing in Greenland\r\nor elsewhere, which might legitimately tax the citizen to furnish his\r\nneighbors with their novel-reading. But it can scarcely be disputed that\r\nan increased facility for obtaining works of fiction is not the pressing\r\nneed of our country in this present year of grace. Dr. Isaac Ray,\r\nperhaps our highest authority on morbid mental phenomena, concludes his\r\nstudy on the effects of the prevalent romantic literature in these\r\nwords: \"The specific doctrine I would inculcate is, that the excessive\r\nindulgence in novel-reading, which is a characteristic of our times, is\r\nchargeable with many of the mental irregularities that prevail among us\r\nin a degree unknown at any former period.\" The late Dr. Forbes Winslow,\r\na physician of similar note in England, used still stronger language in\r\ndescribing how fearfully and fatally suggestive to the minds of the\r\nyoung are those artistically developed records of sin which form the\r\nstaple of the popular novel. In these days of disordered nerve centres,\r\nand commissions to inquire into every thing, we neglect much valuable\r\ninformation which lies upon the surface. It is well to bear in mind that\r\nour eminent bibliographer, Mr. Spofford, has informed us that \"masses of\r\nnovels and other ephemeral publications overload most of our popular\r\nlibraries\"; and that our wisest physicians have agreed as to the\r\ninfluence they exert.\r\n\r\nOf course these views will be met by a brusque statement that town\r\nlibraries must supply such books as people want, and that they demand\r\nthe current novels in unlimited quantities. But I repudiate the dismal\r\nfallacy upon which such an argument is based. Plum-cake and champagne\r\nwould doubtless be demanded at a Sunday-school picnic, were these\r\ndelicacies placed upon the table; but, if the committee did not think it\r\nnecessary to supply them from the parish funds, is it certain that a\r\nfair amount of cold beef and hasty-pudding would not be consumed in\r\ntheir stead? And if a heartless man-government declined to furnish\r\nMaggie and Mollie with \"The Pirate's Penance\" or \"The Bride's Bigamy\"\r\nfor their Sabbath reading, is it not possible that those fair voters of\r\nthe future might substitute Mrs. Fawcett's interesting illustrations of\r\npolitical economy, or some outline of human physiology, their knowledge\r\nof which would bless an unborn generation?\r\n\r\nI do not advocate the absurdity of a town library which should chiefly\r\nconsist of authors like Plato and Professor Peirce. No one can doubt\r\nthat the great majority of its volumes should be emphatically _popular_\r\nin their character. They should furnish intelligible and interesting\r\nreading to the average graduate of the town schools. And there is no\r\nlack of such works. The outlines of physical and social science have\r\nbeen written by men of genius in simple and attractive style. History\r\nand biography in the hands of their masters give a healthy stimulus to\r\nthe imagination, and tend to strengthen the character. The function of a\r\ntown library should be to supply reading improving and interesting, and\r\nyet, in the best sense of the word, popular; and I maintain that this\r\ncan be done, without setting up a rival agency to the news-stand, the\r\nbook-club, and the weekly paper, for the circulation of the novels of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying of Dr. Johnson, to the effect, that, if a boy be let\r\nloose in a library, he is likely to give himself a very fair education.\r\nBut, in accepting this dictum, we must remember the sort of library the\r\ndoctor had in his mind. As known to him, it was based upon solid volumes\r\nof systematized information. Besides these were the noblest poems of the\r\nworld, a very few great romances, and ponderous tomes of controversial\r\ntheology; good, healthy food, and much of it attractive to an unpampered\r\nboy-appetite.\r\n\r\nBut the range of a large library is by no means necessary to produce the\r\nsoundest educational results. Can it be doubted that familiar knowledge\r\nof a small case of well-selected books--such, for instance, as the\r\nmodest stipend of a country clergyman easily collects--is better for boy\r\nand girl than the liberty of devouring a thousand highly-flavored sweets\r\nin the free library? At all events, a few old-fashioned people do not\r\nquestion it. \"A year ago,\" writes one of them, \"Alice used to read\r\nIrving and Spenser, and Tom was dipping into Gibbon and Shakespeare;\r\nliking them well enough, yet preferring a game of base-ball to either,\r\nas it was proper he should. But the town library was opened, and these\r\nyoung people are found crouching over novels in out-of-the-way corners,\r\nwhen they ought to be at play; or reading surreptitiously at night, when\r\nthey ought to be asleep.\" It is in vain to throw all the responsibility\r\nupon parents. American parents are very busy, and somewhat careless.\r\nMrs. Fanny Firefly's highly-seasoned love-stories for girls, and Mr.\r\nSamuel Sensation's boy-novels and spiced preparations of boned history,\r\nare got up, like the port-wine drops of the confectioners, to tempt and\r\nto sell. And they do their work. No one can examine the average boy and\r\ngirl of the period without being struck with their ignorance of the\r\ngreat works of English literature which young people of a former\r\ngeneration were accustomed to read with profit and delight.\r\n\r\nThe function of a town library is to supplement the town schools; to\r\ngratify the taste for knowledge which they should have imparted; and to\r\nserve as an instrument for that self-education to which there is no\r\nlimit. But tax-payers are not bound to circulate twenty-seven thousand\r\nnovels against nineteen hundred volumes of biography and seventeen\r\nhundred of history, according to the figures of one report; or to expend\r\ntwo-thirds of the working force of their establishment in sending out\r\n\"novels and juveniles,\" according to the statement of another. In a\r\nword, information, not excitement, should be imbibed from the atmosphere\r\nof the town library. That prevailing infirmity of our time which seems\r\nto substitute sensibility for morality should there find small\r\nencouragement. But we shall never know what this institution might do\r\nfor a community, so long as the temptation of free novels is thrust in\r\nthe faces of all who enter. For it is not to be expected that our youth\r\nfresh from school, moving among the countless agitations of American\r\nlife, will select reading that may require some mental exertion, so long\r\nas mental excitement is offered them in unlimited amounts.\r\n\r\nI am well aware how much may be said for the story-tellers, and how many\r\npeople there are to say it; and, whenever there is danger of their being\r\nunduly neglected, my voice shall be loudly raised in their behalf. But\r\none may allow the claims of the romances, from Scheherazade to Mrs.\r\nSouthworth, and yet maintain that the theory upon which the average town\r\nlibrary is run is faulty. There is no virtue in despising cakes and ale,\r\nand the heat of ginger in the mouth may at times impart a wholesome glow\r\nto the entire system. But it does not quite follow that it is the\r\nfunction of American towns to supply these stimulants gratis, at the\r\nexpense of their tax-payers. While we consider the immense amount of\r\nreading of a certain sort that a town library supplies, it is well to\r\nremember that there are other sorts of reading it may possibly prevent.\r\nFor it may encourage reading precisely as prodigality encourages\r\nindustry. Luxury and profusion do indeed feed industry, and demoralize\r\nit; but the industry which serves God by blessing man, they prevent from\r\nbeing fed. I fear that in these days more noble capacities die of a\r\nsurfeit from too much poor reading, than starve from want of good books.\r\nThe valid defence of institutions working in the interest of State\r\neducation is this: they prevent a waste of power. When any one of them\r\ncan be shown to encourage waste of power, it needs looking after. In our\r\ncomplex social condition, the real consequences of any government\r\ninterference extend far beyond its apparent consequences. An institution\r\nmay be very useful up to a certain point, and yet hurtful if allowed to\r\nrun its full course without restraining criticism.\r\n\r\nThe managers of our smaller libraries are apt to be picked men, who\r\ngive unrequited labor and intelligence to their trust. But they are\r\nchosen at town meetings,--and to a certain extent must carry out the\r\nwishes of their electors. Upon this matter, as upon most others, it is\r\nthe duty of the thoughtful men and women to create a wholesome public\r\nopinion. They must recognize the fact that the change from a few good\r\nbooks to an unlimited supply of all sorts of books is by no means an\r\nunmixed advantage to a community. While the results of town libraries,\r\ntaken in the aggregate, are undoubtedly good, it is our duty to consider\r\nwhether they ought not to be better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\n    The public library had now passed the period of the merely\r\n    academic advocacy exemplified in the Ticknor letter of 1851.\r\n    It was an actual, functioning institution, and as such was\r\n    called upon to answer criticism and to justify its\r\n    existence. The atmosphere of apologetics begins to appear in\r\n    what its friends have to say about it. This is evident in\r\n    the extract from Col. Higginson's \"Men and Women\" (New York,\r\n    1888) which immediately follows. The author's comparison of\r\n    the evolution of a library with that of a great railroad\r\n    system is perhaps the first hint of a comprehensive vision\r\n    of the library as something bigger than any individual town\r\n    or city institution and beyond it.\r\n\r\n    Thomas Wentworth Higginson was born in Cambridge, Mass.,\r\n    Dec. 22, 1823, and graduated at Harvard in 1841. He entered\r\n    the ministry in 1847 but retired in 1858 and served in the\r\n    Civil War. From that time until his death, May 9, 1911, he\r\n    devoted himself to literature, publishing a large number of\r\n    books.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as there is a good deal of anxiety wasted in regard to our free\r\npublic schools, especially on the part of those who have never entered\r\nthem, so there is some misplaced solicitude in regard to our libraries.\r\nThe free town or city library is one of the few things in our democratic\r\nsociety that would have pleased the splenetic Carlyle, who mourned in\r\none of his early letters that every village in England had its jail, but\r\nnone its open library. It is a pity, therefore, when a man of high\r\nstanding and great influence writes of these institutions thus hastily\r\n(I take the passage from a well-known literary journal): \"Among the\r\nforms of beneficence for which our own generation has been conspicuous\r\nis the Free Library.... But it is, I apprehend, no exaggeration to say\r\nthat such well-meant generosity has _oftener than otherwise_ (the\r\nitalics are my own) been chilled and discouraged by its results.\r\nAppreciative readers are few, the best books are largely let alone, and\r\nthe cost of the 'plant' and the taste which are put into it are often in\r\nmost painful contrast to the appreciation which they have received.\"\r\nNow, while every count of this last sentence may be true indictment, it\r\nis easy to show how little it sustains the verdict. \"Appreciative\r\nreaders\" are few in the most cultivated circles, if their appreciation\r\nmust be tested by \"the best books\" only. It is not easy even to know\r\nwhat the best books are, if we may judge by the tiresome failures in\r\nmaking out the list of them; and suppose that they were known, do we\r\nfind many clergymen or bishops who habitually read Plato, Aeschylus, and\r\nDante, rather than \"Ben-Hur\" or \"The lady or the tiger\"? It does not\r\ntherefore follow that people are unworthy of public libraries because\r\n\"the best books are largely let alone\"; the question is whether even the\r\nsecond best may not be good reading. We have the medical authority of\r\nHippocrates for saying that the second best medicine may be better than\r\nthe best, if the patient likes it best. So in regard to the fine\r\nbuildings, the success of republican government happily does not depend\r\non how far our citizens appreciate the architecture of the Capitol at\r\nWashington and the State House at Albany; and it is surely the same with\r\nlibraries. Grant a few over-fine library buildings, built to please some\r\nprivate benefactor; grant a few mismanaged public libraries--though\r\nwhere these buildings or these libraries are I do not myself know--does\r\nthe kindly writer of these lines mean to be understood as saying that\r\n\"oftener than otherwise\" our free public libraries are failures?\r\n\r\nIf he does, it can only be said that this remark adds another to the\r\ninnumerable illustrations of that invaluable remark of Coleridge that we\r\nmust take every man's testimony to the value of that which he does not\r\nknow. All experience shows how easy it is to construct an institution\r\nout of one's own consciousness and then condemn it; we see this daily in\r\nwhat is written of our public school system. In General Butler's brief\r\ncareer as Governor of Massachusetts he made a severe attack upon the\r\nNormal Art School in Boston, and cited a pathetic instance of a fallen\r\ngirl who undoubtedly (as he urged) received her first demoralization\r\nfrom the study of the nude in that school. It turned out on\r\ninvestigation that he himself had never entered the school, and that the\r\nyoung girl herself made no such charges; that there never had been any\r\nstudying from nude models in the school; that she had attended it but a\r\nmonth or two, and this in its early days, when it did not possess so\r\nmuch as a plaster cast of a human foot or hand. No matter; the charge\r\nwas reiterated up to the very end of His Excellency's career in office,\r\nand is believed by many worthy people of this day. It is equally easy to\r\nbring general charges against public libraries, and equally hard to\r\nremove their impression, however unjust and even cruel they may be.\r\n\r\nWhat are the facts? There has just been a great Librarians' Convention\r\nassembled from all parts of the country, and keeping together for many\r\ndays. Did a single speaker at that Convention take the ground that\r\n\"oftener than otherwise\" the benefactors of public libraries were\r\nchilled and discouraged? On the contrary, it was reported that such\r\nbenefactors were never so active, and their benefactions were never so\r\nlarge. The tone was not one of discouragement, but of buoyancy and hope.\r\nEvery one admitted the vastness of the educational engine created by the\r\nfree library system; every one had his own suggestion by way of\r\nimprovement or development, but every one expressed a cordial faith in\r\nthe community, and reported encouragement in all work well done. The\r\nsimple truth is that the creation of a system of such libraries is like\r\nthe creation of a great railway system; it must be an evolution, not a\r\ncreation outright. The wisest librarian in America fifty years ago had\r\nno more conception of the free library system of to-day than had\r\nBenjamin Franklin of our postal methods; nor can any one now foresee\r\nwhat fifty years of development will do for either.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that every step in any great organization brings out new\r\npossibilities, new dangers, and new resources. Side by side with the\r\nperils of free libraries--as of too much light reading, and the absence\r\nof proper appreciation of the best things--there are evoked resources to\r\nmeet these dangers.\r\n\r\nOutside the library there come up the \"association to promote study at\r\nhome,\" and the vast Chautauqua \"reading circles\"--all these being\r\nessentially based on the free library system, and implying it for their\r\nfull development. Inside the library there grow up such methods as those\r\nof Mr. S.S. Green, City Librarian of Worcester, Massachusetts, whose\r\nways of making such an institution useful to all sorts and conditions of\r\nthe people may take rank with Rowland Hill's improvements in postal\r\nservice, as to their results on democratic civilization. He has\r\nsucceeded in linking the library and the public schools so closely that\r\nhe and the teachers acting in concurrence, indirectly control the\r\nreading of the whole generation that is growing up in that city. The\r\ndetails must be sought in his reports--as, for instance, one from the\r\nLibrary Journal of March, 1887, which is printed as a leaflet; but the\r\nessential thing in managing libraries, as in managing schools, is to\r\nhave faith in the community in which one lives, and to believe that\r\npeople do, as the Scripture has it, \"covet earnestly the best gifts,\" if\r\nyou will only show them how those best gifts are to be obtained. Put\r\ninto school and library methods one-half the organizing ability brought\r\nto bear on railways and telegraphs, and we shall stand astonished at the\r\nresults within our reach. Those already attained, if fairly looked at,\r\nare sufficient to encourage any one. The writer has at two different\r\ntimes and in two different States been a director in these institutions.\r\nWhenever he needed a little stimulus toward doing his duty it was his\r\ncustom to go and look over the rack containing the books lately brought\r\nback by readers. With all necessary deduction for the love of fiction--a\r\nlove shared in these days by the wisest and best--the proportion of\r\nsensible and useful reading was always such as to vindicate the immense\r\nvalue of the free public libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO FUNDAMENTALS\r\n\r\n    Mary Salome Cutler, now Mrs. Milton Fairchild, is the first\r\n    librarian to be quoted in this symposium. A sketch of her\r\n    appears in Vol. II. of this series. In the paragraphs quoted\r\n    below which form part of a paper read by Miss Cutler, then\r\n    vice-director of the New York State Library School, before\r\n    the Pennsylvania Library Club and printed in _The Library\r\n    Journal_ (October, 1896), appears a definite recognition of\r\n    the social character of the library's task. Her two\r\n    fundamentals--organization and human feelings--are both\r\n    decided elements in its socialization.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering library interests we do well, I think, not to confine\r\nourselves to the limited range of library subjects.\r\n\r\nThat mysterious thing which we call society is growing more complex,\r\nevery part more curiously intertwined with every other part, each human\r\nlife bearing some relation to every other human life. Whether he will or\r\nno, it is literally true that \"no man liveth to himself alone.\" If it\r\nwere possible, then, as a part of this organism to discover some of the\r\nlaws which govern the whole, we might come back to our special domain\r\nwith an application of the laws which would have the force of freshness.\r\nI believe that we gain an insight into these controlling principles only\r\nby yielding to the tendency of solidarity, by opening ourselves to\r\nsurrounding influences, by living the fullest life of which we are\r\ncapable. I think I have seen the workings of two of these laws which\r\nhave a close relation to each other. If I am right your experience will\r\nconfirm mine, and we can together make the application to what concerns\r\nus most--the library interests of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn any undertaking results depend directly, and often largely, upon the\r\nperfection of organization. Organization implies a mind which can grasp\r\nthe undertaking as a whole, follow it out, each step in detail, estimate\r\nthe various factors, personal and impersonal, provide for unforeseen\r\ncontingencies, and furnish the faith, the will-power, the personal\r\nmagnetism, whatever you choose to call it, in such measure as is needed\r\nto carry it through. Such a mind sees the end at the beginning, and\r\nthinks of it as already done while to others it may seem far off and\r\neven impossible. Such thought, often the work of one mind, sometimes the\r\nresult of cooperation, is behind every piece of accomplished work. Other\r\nelements may doubtless be essential, but there can be no adequate\r\nresults without organization. And, making allowance for other elements,\r\nthe perfection of results depends upon the perfection of\r\norganization....\r\n\r\nFor the reason of this tendency we have not far to seek. I believe it is\r\nfound in the scientific spirit of the age, which is surely pervading\r\nevery sphere of human thought and activity. The careful investigation of\r\nfacts, the deduction of the law from the phenomena, the distrust of\r\nchance and the loyalty to the law deduced, all of which evidence the\r\nscientific spirit, mark alike the great financier, diplomatist,\r\ninventor, philanthropist.\r\n\r\nIn some undertakings organization alone will suffice. For example,\r\nmaking a machine, laying out a railroad, compiling a volume of\r\nstatistics. In others there must needs come in what I will call the\r\nhuman element, the consideration of people, not in masses, but as\r\nindividuals, that matchless, indescribable quality which we call human\r\nsympathy....\r\n\r\nIllustrations might be multiplied in educational, religious, and\r\nphilanthropic efforts where we work for the masses, and forget that each\r\none of the mass is a human being with passions, sensibilities,\r\naspirations like our own. This interest in the human being as such,\r\nwhich is a gift to some, can be cultivated, but it can never be\r\nsimulated. The counterfeit always rings false. Joined to a good memory\r\nfor names and faces, it gives a person a power which can hardly be\r\nestimated....\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that these two principles apply with tremendous and\r\nunusual force to the problems of the modern library. I will speak of the\r\npublic library alone because it has a wider reach and a closer touch on\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe will review in imagination the library situation in this country. We\r\ntake up Mr. Flint's Statistics volume for 1893; we sum up 593 free\r\nlibraries in the New England states, 520 in New York, Pennsylvania, and\r\nNew Jersey, 285 in the Southern states, 758 in the Western states, a\r\ntotal of 2156 free libraries.\r\n\r\nWe recall our friends in the American Library Association, who\r\nconstitute with some marked exceptions, who prefer to work alone, the\r\nhigh-water mark of the fraternity. As their names pass before us we take\r\na measure of the men and women. We think of their libraries which we may\r\nhave visited, or, better still, which we have used as readers. In some\r\nfew cases we know the influence of these libraries in the town or city.\r\nTake it for all in all we find a body of hard-working men and women\r\ntranslating into practice noble ideals. As a result, the library is\r\nbeginning to get a hold upon the community. But it is only a beginning\r\nand, compared with the possibilities, only a prophecy of what may and\r\nwill be. Are not the failures in our work due to the lack of the best\r\norganization and the true human touch?\r\n\r\nA librarian is appointed, let us say, to an important post. He has\r\ndoubtless had experience in library work. He comes on to consult with\r\nthe trustees. They vote to send him on a trip for getting ideas from\r\nother libraries. He probably has on his hands a beautiful building illy\r\nadapted to library work. He carries the plans with him, and spends most\r\nof the time with other members of the craft, in choosing the least of\r\nseveral evils in placing the reference-room, catalog, charging-desk,\r\netc. He secures two or three assistants with training, experience, or\r\nboth, and fills the minor places with local help chosen by examination\r\nor by luck or by personal favor. He learns in a general way the\r\ncharacter of the town and selects books with that in view. If there are\r\ncertain manufacturing interests or a particular foreign population, he\r\nmakes large purchases in those lines. He decides on a system of\r\nclassification, of cataloging, and on a method of charging. The books\r\nare rushed through the various processes, though all too slowly for an\r\nimpatient public. In a few months at the latest the big educational\r\nplant begins to be utilized.\r\n\r\nThe circulation surprises the most sanguine, the average of fiction\r\ndrops a little below the usual mark, good service is done at the\r\ninformation or reference desk by the enthusiastic man or woman having it\r\nin charge, work is begun with the schools, and a little fraction of\r\nteachers make the children know books because they know books\r\nthemselves. The rest go through the motions. The bookworm fills his\r\ncorner, the chronic grumbler has his little say, the usual number of\r\nprize questions are answered. The library becomes the very bread of life\r\nto those who are ready to receive it, and gives refreshment and\r\nsuggestion and inspiration to many more. The profession approves. At the\r\nnext A.L.A. meeting Mr. ---- is brought forward more prominently, and\r\nthe wise ones say, \"I always thought he was a rising man.\"\r\n\r\nBut only 20 per cent. of the population ever set foot within the\r\nlibrary, and when a stranger asks the way within a block of the\r\nbuilding, a fairly intelligent-looking workman does not appear to know\r\nthere is such a thing as the public library.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the proceedings of the library association for the 18\r\nyears of its existence, we are struck by the evidences of industry and\r\nearnestness. There are papers and discussions on libraries and schools,\r\naccess to the shelves, bookbinding, systems of classification,\r\ncataloging rules. The keynote is cooperation in securing, with an\r\nenthusiasm which amounts to missionary zeal, the best and most uniform\r\nmethods, with special reference to mechanical devices. The very motto\r\nsmacks of arithmetic and commerce. \"The best reading for the largest\r\nnumber at the least cost.\" All this is good and proper in its place.\r\nWise methods are essential to the best results. But we sought in vain\r\nall along the years for the philosophic insight which should grasp the\r\nhigher motive of our profession and connect it with the great struggles\r\nof our modern life. After the Columbus year in the clearer air of the\r\nmountain-top, the word for which we were waiting came. I wish it were\r\npossible to stop right here and give you the papers of Mr. Larned and\r\nMr. Brett, which were read at Lake Placid, as well as the discussion\r\nwhich followed. I must content myself by quoting Mr. Larned's last\r\nsentence: \"Those of us who have faith in the future of democracy can\r\nonly hold our faith fast by believing that the knowledge of the learned,\r\nthe wisdom of the thoughtful, the conscience of the upright, will some\r\nday be common enough to prevail, always, over every factious folly and\r\nevery mischievous movement that evil minds or ignorance can set astir.\r\nWhen that blessed time of victory shall have come, there will be many to\r\nshare the glory of it; but none among them will rank rightly before\r\nthose who have led and inspired the work of the public libraries.\"\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the first great need of the profession to-day, that the\r\nlibrarian should be in the noblest sense a large, man, that he should\r\nadd to executive and business ability and technical knowledge a broad\r\nand generous culture in Matthew Arnold's sense of the word, \"An inward\r\nspiritual activity, having for its character increased sweetness,\r\nincreased light, increased life, increased sympathy.\" He must be an\r\nomnivorous reader, skimming many books, and knowing by instinct which\r\nbooks and which chapters and sentences to read carefully. He must study\r\nfrom books and in life the great industrial, social, and religious\r\nquestions which stir our age. He must be a scholar without pedantry, a\r\nman of the world without indifference, a friend of the people without\r\nsentimentality.\r\n\r\nThere follows naturally the second necessity, that the librarian should\r\nbe a careful student of his own town. He should know its history and\r\ntopography, its social, political, business, literary, and\r\necclesiastical life. To this end he should have a personal acquaintance\r\nwith the city officers, the party bosses, the labor leaders, members of\r\nthe board of trade, manufacturers, leading women in society, with the\r\nclergy, with the school superintendent and the teachers, with those who\r\nshape the charitable organizations, with reporters, policemen, and\r\nreformers.\r\n\r\nTo what end? Broadly that he may catch the spirit of the civic life and\r\nrelate the library to the whole as the organs to the body. Specifically,\r\nthat he may reach the entire population through the natural leaders,\r\nthat he may select books, establish branches, open up new avenues of\r\ncommunication between the library and the people.\r\n\r\nThe church may be aristocratic, industry, trade, and politics a war,\r\nthe public school like the drinking-fountain, though planned for the\r\nmany scorned by the few. I believe it is possible for a man with a broad\r\nand sympathetic knowledge of our age and an intimate knowledge of his\r\nown city, to make of the public library the one common meeting-place,\r\nthe real focus of democratic ideas. The church and the school will reach\r\nthis in the future, the library may achieve it to-day.\r\n\r\nThere is a third difficulty, which is a very real and palpable one. The\r\nlibrarian himself may have a fairly high ideal of the library which is\r\nshared by perhaps one or two assistants. The bulk of the work in a\r\nlibrary with a large circulation is done by young persons of less\r\nopportunity and training. Each has a distinct part of the work to do\r\nwith little idea of its relation to the whole. Unfortunately the\r\nloan-desk, registration-desk, and reading-room are usually manned in\r\nthis way. I have often stood amazed at the delivery-desk of librarians\r\nwhose names represent all that is best in the library profession. I\r\nwould not be understood as depreciating the work of the lower assistants\r\nin our libraries. I know well that this service, as a whole, represents\r\nan amount of faithfulness and devotion which it ill becomes me to\r\nundervalue. The responsibility lies with the head of the library and the\r\nfailure comes from lack of organization. The appointing power should be\r\npractically in his hands. The man whom we have described above does not\r\nneed to seek this power. It comes to him. It is surely possible to\r\nsecure for the library service young men and women, boys and girls, of\r\nfair intelligence, quick wits, responsive minds, and human sympathies.\r\nThe making of these units into an organism is the severest test of a\r\nlibrarian's power. The ability of a general is not enough. He must\r\nhimself have the real human touch or he cannot call it forth from\r\nothers. There must be the promptness, the accuracy, the despatch which\r\nmarks military discipline; there must be also an intelligent conception\r\nof the purpose of the library, a strong sense of personal responsibility\r\nand of the dignity and beauty of the public service. It is sometimes\r\nsaid that spirit of the library should be that of a merchant and his\r\nwell-trained clerks, anxious to please their customers. It should be\r\nrather the fine spirit of a hostess with the daughters of the house\r\nabout her greeting her guests.\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth failure which is perhaps the root difficulty. It is\r\nthe failure to make the most of time. The day opens. The man hastens to\r\nhis place and finds a score of voices calling him to as many different\r\ntasks. He hastily begins the one which seems to call the loudest, and\r\nhas just begun to gather up the threads of thought when there is a\r\nperemptory call in another direction. And so he is driven through the\r\nday, not controlling, but controlled, and constantly lashed by the\r\nthought of neglected duties. By dint of keeping at it all through the\r\nday and often into the night much work is done. The man gets and\r\ndeserves the reputation of a hard-working man, deliberately sacrificing\r\nhealth, ease, leisure, and the joys of a scholar's life for the public\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nNow this is the first and natural result of the enlarged conception of a\r\nlibrarian's work. The man is dazed by the sense of responsibility and\r\nalmost crushed by the demands upon his time apparently separate and\r\nconflicting. But this should be considered only the first process from\r\nwhich the strong man will speedily evolve a wiser way. The fatal mistake\r\nlies in considering this first stage inevitable and final. If a man\r\ntarries here it argues limitation, not power. There certainly are men\r\nwho stand high in public life as well as those holding less prominent\r\npositions, who accomplish an enormous amount of work with a sense of\r\nfreedom and an impression of leisure. As I have observed individual\r\ncases, I am led to the conclusion that the explanation lies not in a\r\nstronger physique, or a stronger intellect, but in a better organization\r\nof work with reference to time. There is no need more imperative than\r\nthis for all of us who are proud to be called busy people. The trouble\r\nis, we think we are too busy to stop and plan. Our philosophic error\r\nlies in believing that the work must all be done to-day. Nature herself\r\nshould teach us that the best work cannot be done in a hurry.\r\n\r\nWe may not hope in this generation to understand well the working of\r\nthat complex, mysterious thing which we call human society, but we may\r\nat least so relate ourselves and our libraries to it that we may live,\r\nmove, and grow together.\r\n\r\n    \"Not unrelated, ununified,\r\n    But to each thought and thing allied,\r\n    Is perfect Nature's every part\r\n    Rooted in the mighty Heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT A LIBRARY SHOULD BE AND WHAT IT CAN DO\r\n\r\n    No one has done more to inspire library workers with the\r\n    feeling that what they are doing is worth while than Dr.\r\n    Melvil Dewey, pioneer in this country of the modern library\r\n    and of the socialized library spirit. A sketch of Dr. Dewey\r\n    will be found in Vol. I. of this series. The following is\r\n    from the stenographer's report of a brief talk at the\r\n    Atlanta Conference of the American Library Association, as\r\n    printed in _Public Libraries_ (Chicago, June, 1899).\r\n\r\n\r\nAtlanta has been known long in this country as a southern city that\r\nbelieves supremely that education pays, and as the revelation has come\r\nlate in this century of what the library is or should be, and what the\r\nlibrary can do, on this line I will say a few words to you tonight.\r\n\r\nWe have had an illustration in the recent war with Spain that education\r\npays, in what it means to have the man behind the guns trained. We have\r\nan illustration in Mr. Carnegie's work, whose name has been mentioned\r\nhere in his competition with the rest of the world, illustrating another\r\npeculiar American feature that American education pays in dollars and\r\ncents; but it is a more recent conception of the part the library has in\r\na system of public education. It took a thousand years to develop our\r\neducational system from the university down; first the university as the\r\nbeginning of all education, and then we must have the colleges to\r\nprepare for the universities, the academies and common schools to\r\nprepare for the colleges, and it is only in our own generation that we\r\nhave come to understand that we must begin with the kindergarten and end\r\nin our libraries.\r\n\r\nI am really pleased tonight that the Young men's association has done\r\nthis generous work, and that Atlanta is going to pay the money from the\r\ntaxes. It would be no advantage to this city if your schools were\r\nprovided for you without charge to the people. Those who study the\r\nquestion from the low plane of dollars and cents, without regard to the\r\nhigher things in life, have learned that no investigation pays well. In\r\nmany a community men are giving liberally to the schools, and are\r\nbeginning to give liberally to the libraries, and they do it because\r\nthey know it makes everything more valuable--it makes their business\r\nmore prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe library is going through the same process the public school went\r\nthrough. Henry Barnard, of Connecticut, visited 27 different states and\r\nspoke before them to urge upon them the system of public education, and\r\nto provide a guidance for the children.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the educated parents are more likely to have children\r\neducated highly, but there is no question whatever that the great\r\nmajority of the men and women who are to shape the future of this\r\ncountry will be born in the humblest homes, and we come back to the\r\nproblem of the general education of all the people as the best possible\r\nadvancement and the chiefest defense of the nation; it is the concern of\r\nthe state because it is the duty of the state, because it pays, and\r\nbecause the state does not dare any longer to neglect it. Therefore I\r\ncall your attention to the fact that we are repeating in libraries\r\nexactly the process of the school, and that there were meetings to urge\r\nthe acceptance of them. There are few who doubt the wisdom of donating\r\nmoney to support the free library, and when the history of the time is\r\nwritten it will be marked as the history of free libraries.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that the people are taxing themselves erecting beautiful\r\nbuildings, buying books, paying salaries, printing catalogs, incurring\r\nall these expenses, paying out an amount of money that a short time ago\r\nwould have been thought only a dream? It is a recognition of its\r\nnecessity and importance. We understand that it is a good thing.\r\n\r\nA broad conception at the end of the century of the work of the schools\r\nis simply this, to teach the children to think accurately, with strength\r\nand with speed. If it is in the school that they get their start, then\r\nwhere do they get their education? Tell me from your own experience, was\r\nit from the school that you got most of your ideas? We had an experiment\r\nsome time ago, when the teachers of New York made an elaborate\r\ninvestigation as to the teaching of boys and girls. The thing that\r\ninfluenced those boys and girls most was the books they read. What,\r\nafter all, is the supreme end of education? I state that we should teach\r\nthem to think with accuracy and with speed, but I doubt if there is one\r\nwho denies the supreme necessity of the building of character. That is\r\nwhat is winning in the peaceful conflicts of commerce. If you care to\r\nanalyze how character is built, follow it back briefly. Character comes\r\nfrom habits, and habits from actions repeated, and actions from a\r\nmotive, and a motive from reflection. What makes me reflect? What makes\r\nyou reflect? What is the cause? Isn't it something that you have read in\r\na book, a magazine, or a paper? So the genealogy is this: reading begets\r\nreflection, reflection begets motive, motive begets action, and action\r\nbegets habit, and habit begets that supreme thing--character. So we have\r\ncome to recognize that if we are to accomplish the chief end that is\r\nbefore the people, we must strive to control the reading for others.\r\n\r\nReading sometimes carries downhill, as it often carries upward, and\r\nthere is no way that we can reach the people except through the free\r\nlibrary and with proper help from the people.\r\n\r\nWhat Atlanta wants to make out of her citizens is not to train privates,\r\nbut to train officers. If you go out on the streets you can find a\r\nthousand men to do the work of a laborer, where you can find only a few\r\nto do the work that will demand five or ten thousand dollars. The world\r\nis looking for that class of men. It is the highest salaried man that is\r\nthe hardest to find. If you would buy a machine, there enters into it\r\nthe material that is in it; the process of manufacture throughout which\r\nhas transformed it, and then the approved fitness for performing its\r\nfunctions. The same way with a man--the native that is manufactured;\r\nthen comes the experience which proves the fitness for his work; and you\r\npay the salary for these things. And by means of our schools and\r\nlibraries we must reach these girls and boys.\r\n\r\nThomas Edison and other great men say that their whole lives are\r\ngoverned from reading a single book. So the province of the library is\r\nto amuse, to inform and inspire. We have the old proverbs, As free as\r\nair; As free as water; but the new one that is important to the race is,\r\nAs free as knowledge. The people of this state cannot afford to have any\r\nboy in Georgia who is anxious to know more, how to make his life more\r\nvaluable, who wants inspiration and is ready to read, and not furnish it\r\nto him. Education is the chief concern of the American people, and the\r\nstates that have done most for their education have been the most\r\nprosperous.\r\n\r\nIt is the concern of the richest as to what should be done for the\r\npoorest; you should provide free schools and free libraries, or the\r\nfailure to do so will react in your own lives. If you say that this\r\nideal is too high, that the library has important functions, but it does\r\nnot take its place as the equal of the schools, it is because you have\r\nnot studied this question in all its details. When you do, you will be\r\nforced to the conclusion that while we must say that this is the\r\ninspiration of a dreamer, remember that it is the devotion of noble\r\nminds that never falters, but endures and waits for all it can find, and\r\nwhat it cannot find, creates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN AMERICAN LIFE\r\n\r\n    As the last of this particular group of papers we reproduce\r\n    a view of our public library system by a foreigner who had\r\n    lived in this country long enough to appreciate it and who\r\n    was yet able to contrast it with the library systems of\r\n    European countries--Prof. Munsterberg of Harvard.\r\n\r\n    Hugo Munsterberg was born in Danzig, Germany, June 1, 1863,\r\n    educated at Leipzig and Heidelberg, and after serving as\r\n    assistant professor at the University of Freiburg, became\r\n    professor of psychology at Harvard in 1892, where he served\r\n    until his death on Dec. 16, 1916. The subjoined extract is\r\n    from his book \"The Americans\" (New York, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American's fondness for reading finds clearest expression in the\r\ngrowth of libraries, and in few matters of civilization is America so\r\nwell fitted to teach the Old World a lesson. Europe has many large and\r\nancient collections of books, and Germany more than all the rest; but\r\nthey serve only one single purpose--that of scientific investigation;\r\nthey are the laboratories of research. They are chiefly lodged with the\r\ngreat universities, and even the large municipal libraries are mostly\r\nused by those who need material for productive labors, or wish to become\r\nconversant with special topics.\r\n\r\nExactly the same type of large library has grown up in America; and\r\nhere, too, it is chiefly the universities whose stock of books is at the\r\nservice of the scientific world. Besides these, there are special\r\nlibraries belonging to learned societies, state law libraries, special\r\nlibraries of government bureaus and of museums, and largest of all the\r\nLibrary of Congress. The collection of such scientific books began at\r\nthe earliest colonial period, and at first under theological auspices.\r\nThe Calvinist Church, more than any other, inclined to the study of\r\nbooks. As early as 1790 the catalog of Harvard College contained 350\r\npages, of which 150 were taken up by theological works. Harvard has\r\nto-day almost a million books, mostly in the department of literature,\r\nphilology, history, philosophy, and jurisprudence. There are, moreover,\r\nin Boston the state library of law, with over a hundred thousand\r\nvolumes; the Athenaeum, with more than two hundred thousand books; the\r\nlarge scientific library of the Institute of Technology, and many\r\nothers. Similarly, in other large cities, the university libraries are\r\nthe nucleus for scientific labors, and are surrounded by admirable\r\nspecial libraries, particularly in New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.\r\nThen, too, the small academic towns, like Princeton, Ithaca, New Haven,\r\nand others, have valuable collections of books, which in special\r\nsubjects are often unique. For many years the American university\r\nlibraries have been the chief purchasers of the special collections left\r\nby deceased European professors. And it often happens, especially\r\nthrough the gift of grateful alumni, that collections of the greatest\r\nscientific value, which could not be duplicated, come into the\r\npossession even of lesser institutions.\r\n\r\nIn many departments of investigation, Washington takes the lead with\r\nthe large collection of the various scientific, economic, and technical\r\nbureaus of the government. The best known of these is the unique medical\r\nlibrary of the War Department. Then there is the Library of Congress,\r\nwith many more than a million volumes, which today has an official right\r\nto one copy of every book published in the United States, and so may\r\nclaim to be a national library. It is still not comparable to the\r\nmany-sided and complete collection of the British Museum; the national\r\nlibrary is one-sided, or at least shows striking gaps. Having started as\r\nthe Library of Congress, it has, aside from its one copy of every\r\nAmerican book and the books on natural science belonging to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, few books except those on politics, history,\r\npolitical economy, and law. The lack of space for books, which existed\r\nuntil a few years ago, made it seem inexpedient to spend money for\r\npurposes other than the convenience of congressmen. But the American\r\npeople, in its love for books, has now erected such a building as the\r\nworld had never before seen devoted to the storing of books. The new\r\nCongressional Library was opened in 1897, and since the stacks have\r\nstill room for several million volumes, the library will soon grow to an\r\nall-round completeness like that at London. This Library has a specially\r\nvaluable collection of manuscripts and correspondences.\r\n\r\nAll the collections of books which we have so far mentioned are\r\nvirtually like those of Germany. But since they mostly date from the\r\nnineteenth century, the American libraries are more modern, and contain\r\nless dead weight in the way of unused folios. Much more important is\r\ntheir greatly superior accessibility. Their reading-rooms are more\r\ncomfortable and better lighted, their catalogs more convenient, library\r\nhours longer, and, above all, books are more easily and quickly\r\ndelivered. Brooks Adams said recently, about the library at Washington\r\nas a place for work, that this building is well-nigh perfect; it is\r\nlarge, light, convenient, and well provided with attendants. In Paris\r\nand London, one works in dusty, forbidding, and overcrowded rooms, while\r\nhere the reading-rooms are numerous, attractive, and comfortable. In the\r\nNational Library at Paris, one has to wait an hour for a book; in the\r\nBritish Museum, half an hour, and in Washington, five minutes. This\r\nrapid service, which makes such a great difference to the student, is\r\nfound everywhere in America; and everywhere the books are housed in\r\nbuildings which are palatial, although perhaps not so beautiful as the\r\nWashington Library.\r\n\r\nStill, all these differences are unessential; in principle the academic\r\nlibraries are alike in the New and Old Worlds. The great difference\r\nbetween Europe and America begins with the libraries which are not\r\nlearned, but which are designed to serve popular education. The American\r\npublic library which is not for science, but for education, is to the\r\nEuropean counterpart as the Pullman express train to the village\r\npost-chaise.\r\n\r\nThe scientific libraries of Boston, including that of Harvard\r\nUniversity, contain nearly two million printed works; but the largest\r\nlibrary of all is distinct from these. It is housed on Copley Square, in\r\na renaissance palace by the side of the Art Museum, and opposite the\r\nmost beautiful church in America. The staircase of yellow marble, the\r\nwonderful wall-paintings, the fascinating arcade on the inner court and\r\nthe sunlit halls are indeed beautiful. And in and out, from early\r\nmorning till late evening, week-day and Sunday, move the people of\r\nBoston. The stream of men divides in the lower vestibule. Some go to the\r\nnewspaper room, where several hundred daily newspapers, a dozen of them\r\nGerman, hang on racks. Others wander to the magazine rooms, where the\r\nweekly and monthly papers of the world are waiting to be read. Others\r\nascend to the upper stories, where Sargent's famous pictures of the\r\nProphets allure the lover of art, in order to look over more valuable\r\nspecial editions and the art magazines, geographical charts, and musical\r\nworks. The largest stream of all goes to the second floor, partly into\r\nthe huge quiet reading-room, partly into the rotunda, which contains the\r\ncatalog, partly into the hall containing the famous frescoes of the Holy\r\nGrail, where the books are given out. Here a million and a half books\r\nare delivered every year to be taken home and read. And no one has to\r\nwait; an apparatus carries the applicant's card with wonderful speed to\r\nthe stacks, and the desired book is sent back in automatic cars. Little\r\nchildren meanwhile wander into the juvenile room, where they find the\r\nbest books for children. And everything invites even the least patient\r\nreader to sit down quietly with some sort of a volume--everything is so\r\ntempting, so convenient and comfortable, and so surpassingly beautiful.\r\nAnd all this is free to the humblest working-man.\r\n\r\nAnd still, if the citizen of Massachusetts were to be asked of what\r\nfeature of the public libraries he is most proud, he would probably not\r\nmention this magnificent palace in Boston, the capital of the state, but\r\nrather the 350 free public libraries scattered through the smaller\r\ncities and towns of this state, which is after all only one-third as\r\nlarge as Bavaria. It is these many libraries which do the broadest work\r\nfor the people. Each little collection, wherever it is, is the center of\r\nintellectual and moral enlightenment, and plants and nourishes the\r\ndesire for self-perfection. Of course, Massachusetts has done more in\r\nthis respect than any other ward in this respect. But there is no longer\r\nany city of moderate size which has not a large public library, and\r\nthere is no state which does encourage in every possible way the\r\nestablishment of public libraries in every small community, giving\r\nfinancial aid if it is necessary.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries have become the favorite Christmas present of\r\nphilanthropists, and while the hospitals, universities, and museums,\r\nhave still no reason for complaint, the churches now find the\r\nsuperfluous millions are less apt to go to gay church windows than to\r\nwell chosen book collections. In the year 1900 there existed more than\r\n5383 public libraries having over a thousand volumes; of these 144 had\r\nmore than fifty thousand, and 54 had more than a hundred thousand\r\nvolumes. All together contained, according to the statistics of 1900\r\nmore than forty-four million volumes and more than seven million\r\npamphlets; and the average growth was over 8 per cent. There are\r\nprobably to-day, therefore, fifteen million volumes more on the shelves.\r\nThe many thousand libraries which have fewer than 999 books are over and\r\nabove all this.\r\n\r\nThe make-up of such public libraries may be seen from the sample catalog\r\ngotten out by the Library Association a few years since, as a typical\r\ncollection of five thousand books. This catalog, which, with the\r\nexception of the most important foreign classics, contains only books in\r\nEnglish, including, however, many translations, contains 227 general\r\nreference books, 756 books on history, 635 on biography, 413 on travel,\r\n355 on natural science, 694 on belles-lettres, 809 novels, 225 on art,\r\n220 on religion, 424 on social science, 268 on technical subjects, etc.\r\nThe cost of this sample collection is $12,000. The proportions between\r\nthe several divisions are about the same in larger collections. In\r\nsmaller collections, belles-lettres have a somewhat greater share. The\r\ngeneral interest taken by the nation in this matter is shown by the fact\r\nthat the first edition of 20,000 copies of this sample catalog, of 600\r\npages, was soon exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe many-sidedness of this catalog points also to the manifold\r\nfunctions of the public library. It is meant to raise the educational\r\nlevel of the people, and this can be done in three ways: first, interest\r\nmay be stimulated along new lines; second, those who wish to perfect\r\nthemselves in their own subjects or in whatsoever special topics, may be\r\nprovided with technical literature; and third, the general desire for\r\nliterary entertainment may be satisfied by books of the best or at least\r\nnot of the worst sort. The directors of libraries see their duties to\r\nlie in all three directions. The libraries guide the tastes and\r\ninterests of the general public, and try to replace the ordinary\r\nservant-girl's novel with the best romance of the day and shallow\r\nliterature with works that are truly instructive. And no community is\r\nquite content until its public library has become a sort of general\r\nmeeting-place and substitute for the saloon and the club. America is the\r\nworking-man's paradise, and attractive enough to the rich man; but the\r\nordinary man of the middle classes, who in Germany finds his chief\r\ncomfort in the Bierhalle would find little comfort in America if it were\r\nnot for the public library, which offers him a home. Thus the public\r\nlibrary has come to be a recognized instrument of culture along with the\r\npublic school; and in all American outposts the school teacher and\r\nlibrarian are among the pioneers.\r\n\r\nThe learned library cannot do this. To be sure, the university library\r\ncan help to spread information, and conversely the public library makes\r\nroom for thousands of volumes on all sorts of scientific topics. But the\r\nemphasis is laid very differently in the two cases, and if it were not\r\nso neither library would best fulfil its purpose. The extreme quiet of\r\nthe reference library and the bustle and stir of the public library do\r\nnot go together. In the one direction America has followed the dignified\r\ntraditions of Europe; in the other, it has opened new paths and\r\ntravelled on at a rapid pace. Every year discovers new ideas and plans,\r\nnew schemes for equipment and the selection of books, for cataloging,\r\nand for otherwise gaining in utility. When, for instance, the library in\r\nProvidence commenced to post a complete list of books and writings\r\npertaining to the subject of every lecture that was given in the city,\r\nit was the initiation of a great movement. The juvenile departments are\r\nthe product of recent years, and are constantly increasing in\r\npopularity. There are even, in some cases, departments for blind\r\nreaders. The state commissions are new, and so also the travelling\r\nlibraries, which are carried from one village to another.\r\n\r\nThe great schools for librarians are also new. The German librarian is\r\nmostly a scholar; but the American believes that he has improved on the\r\nEuropean library systems, not so much by his ample financial resources\r\nas by having broken with the academic custom, and having secured\r\nlibrarians with a special library training. And since there are such\r\nofficials in many thousand libraries, and the great institutions create\r\na constant demand for such persons, the library schools, which offer\r\ngenerally a three years' course, having been found very successful.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, all this technical apparatus is expensive; the Boston\r\nlibrary expends every year a quarter of a million dollars for\r\nadministrative expenses. But the American taxpayer supports this more\r\ngladly than any other burden, knowing that the public library is the\r\nbest weapon against alcoholism and crime, against corruption and\r\ndiscontent, and that the democratic country can flourish only when the\r\ninstinct of self-perfection as it exists in every American is thoroughly\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\n    This paper and the two that follow it relate specifically to\r\n    reading as fostered by the public library and yet not\r\n    sufficiently to the provision of books to the public as a\r\n    definite library service to warrant postponing them to the\r\n    section relating to that branch of community service. They\r\n    have a somewhat academic or \"literary flavor,\" and yet are\r\n    permeated not with the idea of \"books for scholars\" but with\r\n    that of \"books for people\"--the idea of reading as a\r\n    universal function--duty, pleasure and inspiration in\r\n    one--which is distinctly that of a socialized library. The\r\n    first paper is an address made by Lowell at the opening of\r\n    the new public library building at Chelsea, Mass., Dec. 22,\r\n    1885.\r\n\r\n    James Russell Lowell was born in Cambridge, Mass., Feb. 22,\r\n    1819, and graduated at Harvard in 1838, succeeding\r\n    Longfellow as professor of Literature there in 1855. He\r\n    edited _The North American Review_ in 1863-72, served as\r\n    U.S. minister to Spain in 1877-80 and to Great Britain in\r\n    1880-85. He died in Cambridge, Aug. 12, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A few years ago my friend, Mr. Alexander Ireland, published a very\r\ninteresting volume which he called \"The book-lover's euchiridion,\" the\r\nhandbook, that is to say, of those who love books. It was made up of\r\nextracts from the writings of a great variety of distinguished men,\r\nancient and modern, in praise of books. It was a chorus of many voices\r\nin many tongues, a hymn of gratitude and praise, full of such piety and\r\nfervor as can be parelleled only in songs dedicated to the supreme\r\npower, the supreme wisdom and the supreme love. Nay, there is a glow of\r\nenthusiasm and sincerity in it which is often painfully wanting in those\r\nother too commonly mechanical compositions. We feel at once that here it\r\nis out of the fulness of the heart, yes, and of the head, too, that the\r\nmouth speaketh. Here was none of that compulsory commonplace which is\r\nwont to characterize those 'testimonials of celebrated authors,' by\r\nmeans of which publishers sometimes strive to linger out the passages of\r\na hopeless book toward its _requiescat_ in oblivion. These utterances\r\nwhich Mr. Ireland has gathered lovingly together are stamped with that\r\nspontaneousness which is the mint mark of all sterling speech. It is\r\ntrue that they are mostly, as is only natural, the utterances of\r\nliterary men, and there is a well-founded proverbial distrust of herring\r\nthat bear only the brand of the packer, and not that of the sworn\r\ninspector. But to this objection a cynic might answer with the question,\r\n'Are authors so prone, then, to praise the works of other people that we\r\nare to doubt them when they do it un-asked?' Perhaps the wisest thing I\r\ncould have done to-night would have been to put upon the stand some of\r\nthe more weighty of this cloud of witnesses. But since your invitation\r\nimplied that I should myself say something, I will endeavor to set\r\nbefore you a few of the commonplaces of the occasion, as they may be\r\nmodified by passing through my own mind, or by having made themselves\r\nfelt in my own experience.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Mr. Ireland's witnesses testify to the comfort and\r\nconsolation they owe to books, to the refuge they have found in them\r\nfrom sorrow or misfortune, to their friendship, never estranged and\r\noutliving all others. This testimony they volunteered. Had they been\r\nasked, they would have borne evidence as willingly to the higher and\r\nmore general uses of books in their service to the commonwealth, as well\r\nas to the individual man. Consider, for example, how a single page of\r\nBurke may emancipate the young student of politics from narrow views and\r\nmerely contemporaneous judgments. Our English ancestors, with that\r\ncommon-sense which is one of the most useful, though not one of the most\r\nengaging, properties of the race, made a rhyming proverb, which says\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n    \"When land and goods are gone and spent,\r\n    Then learning is most excellent\";\r\n\r\nand this is true, so far as it goes, though it goes, perhaps, hardly\r\nfar enough. The law also calls only the earth and what is immovably\r\nattached to it _real_ property, but I am of opinion that those only are\r\nreal possessions which abide with a man after he has been stripped of\r\nthose others falsely so called, and which alone save him from seeming\r\nand from being the miserable forked radish to which the bitter scorn of\r\nLear degraded every child of Adam. The riches of scholarship, the\r\nbenignities of literature, defy fortune and outlive calamity. They are\r\nbeyond the reach of thief or moth or rust. As they cannot be inherited,\r\nso they cannot be alienated. But they may be shared, they may be\r\ndistributed, and it is the object and office of a free public library to\r\nperform these beneficial functions.\r\n\r\n\"Books,\" says Wordsworth, \"are a real world,\" and he was thinking,\r\ndoubtless, of such books as are not merely the triumphs of pure\r\nintellect, however supreme, but of those in which intellect infused with\r\nthe sense of beauty aims rather to produce delight than conviction, or,\r\nif conviction, then through intuition rather than formal logic, and,\r\nleaving what Donne wisely calls\r\n\r\n    \"Unconscious things, matters of fact,\"\r\n\r\nto science and the understanding, seeks to give ideal expression to the\r\nabiding realities of the spiritual world for which the outward and\r\nvisible world serves at best but as the husk and symbol. Am I wrong in\r\nusing the word _realities_?--wrong in insisting on the distinction\r\nbetween the real and the actual? in assuming for the ideal an existence\r\nas absolute and self-subsistent as that which appeals to our\r\nsenses--nay, so often cheats them in the matter of fact? How very small\r\na part of the world we truly live in is represented by what speaks to us\r\nthrough the senses when compared with that vast realm of the mind which\r\nis peopled by memory and imagination, and with such shining inhabitants!\r\nThese walls, these faces, what are they in comparison with the countless\r\nimages, the innumerable population which every one of us can summon up\r\nto the tiny show-box of the brain, in material breadth scarce a span,\r\nyet infinite as space and time? And in what, I pray, are those we\r\ngravely call historical characters, of which each new historian strains\r\nhis neck to get a new and different view, in any sense more real than\r\nthe personages of fiction? Do not serious and earnest men discuss Hamlet\r\nas they would Cromwell or Lincoln? Does Caesar, does Alaric, hold\r\nexistence by any other or stronger tenure than the Christian of Bunyan\r\nor the Don Quixote of Cervantes or the Antigone of Sophocles? Is not the\r\nhistory which is luminous because of an indwelling and perennial truth\r\nto nature, because of that light which never was on land or sea, really\r\n_more_ true, in the highest sense, than many a weary chronicle with\r\nnames, date, and place in which \"an Amurath to Amurath succeeds\"? Do we\r\nknow as much of any authentic Danish prince as of Hamlet?\r\n\r\nBut to come back a little nearer to Chelsea and the occasion that has\r\ncalled us together. The founders of New England, if sometimes, when they\r\nfound it needful, an impracticable, were always a practical people.\r\nTheir first care, no doubt, was for an adequate supply of powder, and\r\nthey encouraged the manufacture of musket bullets by enacting that they\r\nshould pass as currency at a farthing each--a coinage nearer to its\r\nnominal value, and not heavier than some with which we are familiar.\r\nTheir second care was that \"good learning should not perish from among\r\nus,\" and to this end they at once established the Latin School in\r\nBoston, and soon after the college at Cambridge. The nucleus of this\r\nwas, as you all know, the bequest in money by John Harvard. Hardly less\r\nimportant, however, was the legacy of his library, a collection of good\r\nbooks, inconsiderable measured by the standard of to-day, but very\r\nconsiderable then as the possession of a private person. From that\r\nlittle acorn what an oak has sprung, and from its acorn again what a\r\nvocal forest, as old Howell would have called it--old Howell, whom I\r\nlove to cite, because his name gave their title to the 'Essays of Elia,'\r\nand is borne with slight variation by one of the most delightful of\r\nmodern authors! It was, in my judgment, those two foundations, more than\r\nanything else, which gave to New England character its bent and to\r\nBoston that literary supremacy which, I am told, she is in danger of\r\nlosing, but which she will not lose till she and all the world lose\r\nHolmes.\r\n\r\nThe opening of a free public library, then, is a most important event\r\nin the history of any town. A college training is an excellent thing;\r\nbut, after all, the better part of every man's education is that which\r\nhe gives himself, and it is for this that a good library should furnish\r\nthe opportunity and the means. I have sometimes thought that our public\r\nschools undertook to teach too much, and that the older system, which\r\ntaught merely the three R's, and taught them well, leaving natural\r\nselection to decide who should go farther, was the better. However this\r\nmay be, all that is primarily needful in order to use a library is the\r\nability to read. I say primarily, for there must also be the\r\ninclination, and, after that, some guidance in reading well. Formerly\r\nthe duty of a librarian was considered too much that of a watchdog to\r\nkeep people as much as possible away from the books, and to hand these\r\nover to his successor as little worn by use as he could. Librarians now,\r\nit is pleasant to see, have a different notion of their trust, and are\r\nin the habit of preparing for the direction of the inexperienced lists\r\nof such books as they think best worth reading. Cataloging has also,\r\nthanks in great measure to American librarians, become a science, and\r\ncatalogs, ceasing to be labyrinths without a clew, are furnished with\r\nfinger-posts at every turn. Subject catalogs again save the beginner a\r\nvast deal of time and trouble, by supplying him for nothing with one at\r\nleast of the results of thorough scholarship, the knowing where to look\r\nfor what he wants. I do not mean by this that there is or can be any\r\nshort-cut to learning, but that there may be, and is, such a short-cut\r\nto information that will make learning more easily accessible.\r\n\r\nBut have you ever rightly considered what the mere ability to read\r\nmeans? That it is the key that admits us to the whole world of thought\r\nand fancy and imagination; to the company of saint and sage, of the\r\nwisest and the wittiest at their wisest and wittiest moment? That it\r\nenables us to see with the keenest eyes, hear with the finest ears, and\r\nlisten to the sweetest voices of all time? More than that, it\r\nannihilates time and space for us; it revives for us without a miracle\r\nthe Age of Wonder, endowing us with the shoes of swiftness and the cap\r\nof darkness, so that we walk invisible like fern seed and witness\r\nunharmed the plague at Athens or Florence or London, accompanying Caesar\r\non his marches, or look in on Catiline in council with his\r\nfellow-conspirators, or Guy Fawkes in the cellar of St. Stephen's. We\r\noften hear of people who will descend to any servility, submit to any\r\ninsult, for the sake of getting themselves or their children into what\r\nis euphemistically called good society. Did it ever occur to them that\r\nthere is a select society of all the centuries to which they and theirs\r\ncan be admitted for the asking--a society, too, which will not involve\r\nthem in ruinous expense and still more ruinous waste of time and health\r\nand faculties?\r\n\r\nSouthey tells us that, in his walk, one stormy day, he met an old\r\nwoman, to whom, by way of greeting, he made the rather obvious remark\r\nthat it was dreadful weather. She answered, philosophically, that, in\r\nher opinion, '_any_ weather was better than none!' I should be half\r\ninclined to say that any reading was better than none, allaying the\r\ncrudeness of the statement by the Yankee proverb, which tells us that,\r\nthough 'all deacons are good, there's odds in deacons.' Among books,\r\ncertainly there is much variety of company, ranging from the best to the\r\nworst, from Plato to Zola, and the first lesson in reading well is that\r\nwhich teaches us to distinguish between literature and merely printed\r\nmatter. The choice lies wholly with ourselves. We have the key put into\r\nour hands; shall we unlock the pantry or the oratory? There is a\r\nWallachian legend which, like most of the figments of popular fancy, has\r\na moral in it. One Bakala, a good-for-nothing kind of fellow in his way,\r\nhaving had the luck to offer a sacrifice especially well pleasing to\r\nGod, is taken up into heaven. He finds the Almighty sitting in something\r\nlike the best room of a Wallachian peasant's cottage--there is always\r\nsomething profoundly pathetic in the homeliness of the popular\r\nimagination, forced, like the princess in the fairy tale, to weave its\r\nsemblance of gold tissue out of straw. On being asked what reward he\r\ndesires for the good service he has done, Bakala, who had always\r\npassionately longed to be the owner of a bagpipe, seeing a half wornout\r\none lying among some rubbish in a corner of the room, begs eagerly that\r\nit may be bestowed on him. The Lord, with a smile of pity at the\r\nmeanness of his choice, grants him his boon, and Bakala goes back to\r\nearth delighted with his prize. With an infinite possibility within his\r\nreach, with the choice of wisdom, of power, of beauty at his tongue's\r\nend, he asked according to his kind, and his sordid wish is answered\r\nwith a gift as sordid. Yes, there is a choice in books as in friends,\r\nand the mind sinks or rises to the level of its habitual society, is\r\nsubdued, as Shakespeare says of the dyer's hand, to what it works in.\r\nCato's advice, _cum bonis ambula_, consort with the good, is quite as\r\ntrue if we extend it to books, for they, too, insensibly give away their\r\nown nature to the mind that converses with them. They either beckon\r\nupward or drag down. And it is certainly true that the material of\r\nthought reacts upon the thought itself. Shakespeare himself would have\r\nbeen commonplace had he been paddocked in a thinly shaven vocabulary,\r\nand Phidias, had he worked in wax, only a more inspired Mrs. Jarley. A\r\nman is known, says the proverb, by the company he keeps, and not only\r\nso, but made by it. Milton makes his fallen angels grow small to enter\r\nthe infernal council room, but the soul, which God meant to be the\r\nspacious chamber where high thoughts and generous aspirations might\r\ncommune together, shrinks and narrows itself to the measure of the\r\nmeaner company that is wont to gather there, hatching conspiracies\r\nagainst our better selves. We are apt to wonder at the scholarship of\r\nthe men of three centuries ago and at a certain dignity of phrase that\r\ncharacterizes them. They were scholars because they did not read so many\r\nthings as we. They had fewer books, but these were of the best. Their\r\nspeech was noble, because they lunched with Plutarch and supped with\r\nPlato. We spend as much time over print as they did, but instead of\r\ncommuning with the choice thoughts of choice spirits, and unconsciously\r\nacquiring the grand manner of that supreme society, we diligently inform\r\nourselves and cover the continent with a network of speaking wires to\r\ninform us of such inspiring facts as that a horse belonging to Mr. Smith\r\nran away on Wednesday, seriously damaging a valuable carryall; that a\r\nson of Mr. Brown swallowed a hickory nut on Thursday; and that a gravel\r\nbank caved in and buried Mr. Robinson alive on Friday. Alas! it is we\r\nourselves that are getting buried alive under this avalanche of earthy\r\nimpertinences. It is we who, while we might each in his humble way be\r\nhelping our fellows into the right path, or adding one block to the\r\nclimbing spire of a fine soul, are willing to become mere sponges\r\nsaturated from the stagnant goosepond of village gossip.\r\n\r\nOne is sometimes asked by young people to recommend a course of\r\nreading. My advice would be that they should confine themselves to the\r\nsupreme books in whatever literature, or still better to choose some one\r\ngreat author, and make themselves thoroughly familiar with him. For, as\r\nall roads lead to Rome, so do they likewise lead away from it, and you\r\nwill find that, in order to understand perfectly and weigh exactly any\r\nvital piece of literature, you will be gradually and pleasantly\r\npersuaded to excursions and explorations of which you little dreamed\r\nwhen you began, and will find yourselves scholars before you are aware.\r\nFor remember that there is nothing less profitable than scholarship for\r\nthe mere sake of scholarship, nor anything more wearisome in the\r\nattainment. But the moment you have a definite aim attention is\r\nquickened, the mother of memory, and all that you acquire groups and\r\narranges itself in an order that is lucid, because everywhere and always\r\nit is in intelligent relation to a central object of constant and\r\ngrowing interest. This method also forces upon us the necessity of\r\nthinking, which is, after all, the highest result of all education. For\r\nwhat we want is not learning, but knowledge--that is, the power to make\r\nlearning answer its true end as a quickener of intelligence and a\r\nwidener of our intellectual sympathies. I do not mean to say that every\r\none is fitted by nature or inclination for a definite course of study,\r\nor indeed for serious study in any sense. I am quite willing that these\r\nshould 'browse in a library,' as Dr. Johnson called it, 'to their\r\nhearts' content. It is, perhaps, the only way in which time may be\r\nprofitably wasted. But desultory reading will not make a \"full man,\" as\r\nBacon understood it, of one who has not Johnson's memory, his power of\r\nassimilation, and, above all, his comprehensive view of the relations of\r\nthings. \"Read not,\" says Lord Bacon, in his \"Essay of Studies,\" \"to\r\ncontradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find\r\ntalk and discourse; but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be\r\ntasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and\r\ndigested--that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be\r\nread, but not curiously (carefully), and some few to be read wholly and\r\nwith diligence and attention. _Some books also may be read by deputy._\"\r\nThis is weighty and well said, and I would call your attention\r\nespecially to the wise words with which the passage closes.\r\n\r\nI have been speaking of such books as should be chosen for profitable\r\nreading. A public library, of course, must be far wider in its scope. It\r\nshould contain something for all tastes, as well as the material for a\r\nthorough grounding in all branches of knowledge. It should be rich in\r\nbooks of reference, in encyclopaedias, where one may learn without cost\r\nof research what things are generally known. For it is far more useful\r\nto know these than to know those that are _not_ generally known. Not to\r\nknow them is the defect of those half trained and therefore hasty men\r\nwho find a mare's nest on every branch of the tree of knowledge. A\r\nlibrary should contain ample stores of history, which, if it do not\r\nalways deserve the pompous title which Bolingbroke gave it, of\r\nphilosophy teaching by example, certainly teaches many things profitable\r\nfor us to know and lay to heart; teaches among other things how much of\r\nthe present is still held in mortmain by the past; teaches that, if\r\nthere be no controlling purpose, there is, at least, a sternly logical\r\nsequence in human affairs, and that chance has but a trifling dominion\r\nover them; teaches why things are and must be so and not otherwise;\r\nteaches, perhaps, more than anything else, the value of personal\r\ncharacter as a chief factor in what used to be called destiny, for that\r\ncause is strong which has not a multitude but one strong man behind it.\r\nHistory is indeed mainly the biography of a few imperial men, and forces\r\nhome upon us the useful lesson how infinitesimally important our own\r\nprivate affairs are to the universe in general. History is clarified\r\nexperience, and yet how little do men profit by it--nay, how should we\r\nexpect it of those who so seldom are taught anything by their own!\r\nDelusions, especially economical delusions, seem the only things that\r\nhave any chance of an earthly immortality. I would have plenty of\r\nbiography. It is no insignificant fact that eminent men have always\r\nloved their Plutarch, since example, whether for emulation or avoidance,\r\nis never so poignant as when presented to us in a striking personality.\r\nAutobiographies are also instructive reading to the student of human\r\nnature, though generally written by men who were more interesting to\r\nthemselves than to their fellow-men. I have been told that Emerson and\r\nGeorge Eliot agreed in thinking Rousseau's \"Confessions\" the most\r\ninteresting book they had ever read.\r\n\r\nA public library should also have many and full shelves of political\r\neconomy, for the dismal science, as Carlyle called it, if it prove\r\nnothing else, will go far toward proving that theory is the bird in the\r\nbush, though she sing more sweetly than the nightingale, and that the\r\nmillennium will not hasten its coming in deference to the most\r\nconvincing string of resolutions that were ever unanimously adopted in\r\npublic meeting. It likewise induces in us a profound distrust of social\r\npanaceas.\r\n\r\nI would have a public library abundant in translations of the best books\r\nin all languages; for though no work of genius can be adequately\r\ntranslated, because every word of it is permeated with what Milton calls\r\n'the precious life blood of a master spirit,' which cannot be transfused\r\ninto the veins of the best translation, yet some acquaintance with\r\nforeign and ancient literatures has the liberalizing effect of foreign\r\ntravel. He who travels by translation travels more hastily and\r\nsuperficially, but brings home something that is worth having,\r\nnevertheless. Translations properly used, by shortening the labor of\r\nacquisition, add as many years to our lives as they subtract from the\r\nprocesses of our education.\r\n\r\nIn such a library the sciences should be fully represented, that men may\r\nat least learn to know in what a marvellous museum they live, what a\r\nwonder worker is giving them an exhibition daily for nothing. Nor let\r\nart be forgotten in all its many forms, not as the antithesis of\r\nscience, but as her elder or fairer sister, whom we love all the more\r\nthat her usefulness cannot be demonstrated in dollars and cents. I\r\nshould be thankful if an every day laborer among us could have his mind\r\nillumined, as those of Athens and of Florence had, with some image of\r\nwhat is best in architecture, painting and sculpture to train his crude\r\nperceptions and perhaps call out latent faculties. I should like to see\r\nthe works of Ruskin within the reach of every artisan among us. For I\r\nhope some day that the delicacy of touch and accuracy of eye that have\r\nmade our mechanics in some departments the best in the world may give us\r\nthe same supremacy in works of wider range and more purely ideal scope.\r\n\r\nVoyages and travels I would also have, good store, especially the\r\nearlier, when the world was fresh and unhackneyed and men saw things\r\ninvisible to the modern eye. They are fast sailing ships to waft away\r\nfrom present trouble to the Fortunate Isles.\r\n\r\nTo wash down the dryer morsels that every library must necessarily\r\noffer at its board, let there be plenty of imaginative literature, and\r\nlet its range be not too narrow to stretch from Dante to the elder\r\nDumas. The world of the imagination is not the world of abstraction and\r\nnonentity, as some conceive, but a world formed out of chaos by the\r\nsense of the beauty that _is_ in man and the earth on which he dwells.\r\nIt is the realm of might be, our heaven of refuge from the shortcomings\r\nand disillusions of life. It is, to quote Spenser, who knew it well,\r\n\r\n    \"The world's sweet inn from care and wearisome turmoil.\"\r\n\r\nDo we believe, then, that God gave us in mockery this splendid faculty\r\nof sympathy with things that are a joy forever? For my part, I believe\r\nthat the love and study of works of imagination is of practical utility\r\nin a country so profoundly material in its leading tendencies as ours.\r\nThe hunger after purely intellectual delights, the content with ideal\r\npossessions, cannot but be good for us in maintaining a wholesome\r\nbalance of the character and of the faculties. I for one shall never be\r\npersuaded, that Shakespeare left a less useful legacy to his countrymen\r\nthan Watt. We hold all the deepest, all the highest satisfactions of\r\nlife as tenants of imagination. Nature will keep up the supply of what\r\nare called hard-headed people without our help, and, if it come to that,\r\nthere are other as good uses for heads as at the end of battering rams.\r\n\r\nI know that there are many excellent people who object to the reading of\r\nnovels as a waste of time, if not as otherwise harmful. But I think they\r\nare trying to outwit nature, who is sure to prove cunninger than they.\r\nLook at children. One boy shall want a chest of tools and one a book,\r\nand of those who want books one shall ask for a botany, another for a\r\nromance. They will be sure to get what they want, and we are doing a\r\ngrave wrong to their morals by driving them to do things on the sly, to\r\nsteal that food which their constitution craves and which is wholesome\r\nfor them, instead of having it freely and frankly given them as the\r\nwisest possible diet. If we cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear,\r\nso neither can we hope to succeed with the opposite experiment. But we\r\nmay spoil the silk for its legitimate uses. I can conceive of no\r\nhealthier reading for a boy, or girl either, than Scott's novels or\r\nCooper's, to speak only of the dead. I have found them very good reading\r\nat least for one young man, for one middle-aged man, and for one who is\r\ngrowing old. No, no; banish the Antiquary, banish Leather Stocking, and\r\nbanish all the world! Let us not go about to make life duller than it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nBut I must shut the doors of my imaginary library, or I shall never\r\nend. It is left for me to say a few words of fitting acknowledgment to\r\nMr. Fitz for his judicious and generous gift. It is always a pleasure to\r\nme that I believe the custom of giving away money during their lifetime\r\n(and there is nothing harder for most men to part with, except\r\nprejudice) is more common with Americans than with any other people. It\r\nis a still greater pleasure to see that the favorite direction of their\r\nbeneficence is toward the founding of colleges and libraries. My\r\nobservation has led me to believe that there is no country in which\r\nwealth is so sensible of its obligations as our own. And, as most of our\r\nrich men have risen from the ranks, may we not fairly attribute this\r\nsympathy with their kind to the benign influence of democracy rightly\r\nunderstood? My dear and honored friend, George William Curtis, told me\r\nthat he was sitting in front of the late Mr. Ezra Cornell in a\r\nconvention, where one of the speakers made a Latin quotation. Mr.\r\nCornell leaned forward and asked for a translation of it, which Mr.\r\nCurtis gave him. Mr. Cornell thanked him, and added: \"If I can help it,\r\nno young man shall grow up in New York hereafter without the chance, at\r\nleast, of knowing what a Latin quotation means when he hears it.\" This\r\nwas the germ of Cornell University, and it found food for its roots in\r\nthat sympathy and thoughtfulness for others of which I just spoke. This\r\nis the healthy side of that good nature which democracy tends to foster,\r\nand which is so often harmful when it has its root in indolence or\r\nindifference; especially harmful where our public affairs are concerned,\r\nand where it is easiest, because there we are giving away what belongs\r\nto other people. In this country it is as laudably easy to procure\r\nsignatures to a subscription paper as it is shamefully so to obtain them\r\nfor certificates of character and recommendations to office. And is not\r\nthis public spirit a natural evolution from that frame of mind in which\r\nNew England was colonized, and which found expression in these grave\r\nwords of Robinson and Brewster: \"We are knit together as a body in a\r\nmost strict and sacred bond and covenant of the Lord, of the violation\r\nof which we make great conscience, and by virtue whereof we hold\r\nourselves strictly tied to all care of each other's good, and of the\r\nwhole.\" Let us never forget the deep and solemn import of these words.\r\nThe problem before us is to make a whole of our many discordant parts,\r\nmany foreign elements, and I know of no way in which this can better be\r\ndone than by providing a common system of education and a common door of\r\naccess to the best books by which that education may be continued,\r\nbroadened, and made fruitful. For it is certain that, whatever we do or\r\nleave undone, those discordant parts and foreign elements are to be,\r\nwhether we will or no, members of that body which Robinson and Brewster\r\nhad in mind, bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, for good or ill.\r\n\r\nThere is no way in which a man can build so secure and lasting a\r\nmonument for himself as in a public library. Upon that he may\r\nconfidently allow \"Resurgam\" to be carved, for through his good deed he\r\nwill rise again in the grateful remembrance and in the lifted and\r\nbroadened minds and fortified characters of generation after generation.\r\nThe pyramids may forget their builders, but memorials such as this have\r\nlonger memories.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitz has done his part in providing your library with a dwelling.\r\nIt will be for the citizens of Chelsea to provide it with worthy\r\nhabitants. So shall they, too, have a share in the noble eulogy of the\r\nancient wise man: \"The teachers shall shine as the firmament, and they\r\nthat turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF GOOD BOOKS\r\n\r\n    The following paragraphs, which are from an address\r\n    delivered by Rev. Dr. Collyer at the opening of the Richard\r\n    Sugden Library at Spencer, Mass., are taken from a report in\r\n    _The Library Journal_ (September, 1889). The\r\n    autobiographical portions, perhaps, are little related to\r\n    the progress of libraries here in the United States, but\r\n    their interest is so great that more of them have been\r\n    included here than are strictly pertinent to our subject.\r\n\r\n    Robert Collyer was born in Keighley, Yorkshire, Eng., Dec.\r\n    8, 1823. He was apprenticed to a blacksmith as a boy of 14,\r\n    came to Shoemakertown, Pa., with his parents in 1850 and\r\n    followed there the trade of a hammermaker. Later he entered\r\n    the ministry of the Unitarian church and in 1860 founded\r\n    Unity church in Chicago. In 1879 he became pastor of the\r\n    Church of the Messiah in New York City, where he died in\r\n    1912.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Richard Sugden asked me to come to Spencer and say some word\r\nwhich would fit this occasion, I wrote him by the next mail that I\r\nshould be ever so glad to come, and felt that it was a great honor to\r\nreceive such an invitation, and a great pleasure. Nor was the trouble of\r\nmuch account--which touches us all who say Aye to such an invitation on\r\nthe impulse of the moment and then wonder how we shall make our promise\r\ngood. My old friend wanted me to come, and not another and better man,\r\nand to say the word which was in my heart to-day, whatever this might\r\nbe; and this was enough, because I had read in the papers--what he was\r\nfar too modest to tell me, beyond the merest mention--about the gift of\r\nRichard Sugden to his town, and so I said it makes no great matter what\r\nany man may say, the thing he has done tells its own story, and tells it\r\nmore nobly than I could ever hope to do, more nobly and in this fashion\r\nwhich shames my speech. For our words float away on the summer winds, to\r\nbe caught, it may be, and set in type and read by those who care for\r\nsuch things, and then to die and be forgotten; but this your friend and\r\nmine has done in Spencer will be eloquent with the silence which is\r\ngolden, and still tell its tale when we are all dead and dust who gather\r\nhere to-day. It is a poor and scant manhood which does not long now and\r\nthen to be remembered some little while after the grass grows green and\r\nthe daisies bloom on the grave. To have them speak of us at the\r\nfire-side and in the workshop and the market, remembering what was\r\nworthy in us and forgetting what was base, though there may be no more\r\nto tell by comparison than Dr. Ripley told down in Concord, as he stood\r\nby the dust of a man in his own town, and being sorely troubled to find\r\nsome real worth in the man's life he could dwell on for a moment, said,\r\n\"He was the best man I ever knew at a fire.\" I cannot even guess whether\r\nRichard Sugden ever thought of this as one of the rewards which must\r\nreturn to him for his gift to Spencer, and I love to think that to his\r\ngenerous heart the work was its own reward. But I say, as we stand here\r\non this day of gift and dedication, that if this had been his sole\r\npurpose, to be held in grateful remembrance of his fellow-townsmen and\r\ntheir children through centuries of time, then he has taken out an\r\ninsurance that will stand good always and keep his memory green in the\r\ntown of Spencer. And not here alone, but far away across the sea in old\r\nYorkshire, where his home was in the old time before he came to this new\r\nworld to seek his fortune, and, far more and better than that, to earn\r\nit honestly and well. The story will be told there long after to-day and\r\nto-morrow, how one of the Sugdens who went out from among them gave this\r\ngift, and then the kith and kin will hold up their heads and feel that\r\nthe fine old name has won still another patent of nobility. A poor youth\r\nhe was in the narrow, contracted, dear old land, where the poor were\r\nheld by a cruel bit. And a voice came to him, saying, \"Get thee out from\r\nthy kindred and thy father's house unto a land that I will tell thee\r\nof\"; and he followed the voice, as I did also, to the promised land;\r\ncarved out his fortune honest and fair, I say, but then could not be\r\ncontent to enrich his own family alone, or, as so many do, to remember\r\nhis town in his will. He must build this noble structure, please God, in\r\nhis own lifetime, and convey it by free gift to you and yours forever;\r\nand so the work is done, and so well done, to all seeming, that if you\r\ncare for the gift as your friend has cared for its creation, we may say,\r\nas old Andrew Fairservice said of the cathedral in Glasgow, \"Keep airn\r\nand gunpooder aff it, and it will stand to the crack o'doom.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend and yours is also an Englishman and a Yorkshireman, as you\r\nknow, by birth and breeding, as I am also, and I am the more glad and\r\nproud of what he has done for that reason; because I still love old\r\nEngland with a very tender love after these forty years of absence, as I\r\nknow he does also. But I have had to notice how very many of us who came\r\nhere from England to find a home in the American republic, and it may be\r\nmake their fortune, can find nothing so good in this new world as that\r\nthey left behind them, and no matter how much wealth they may win, they\r\ndo nothing as a rule for the town they live in, like this your friend\r\nhas done in Spencer. He could not be content to be a mere exile from\r\nEngland, he must be a citizen of the United States and blend his life\r\nwith the life in this new world which has made him so much more of a man\r\nthan he ever could have been had he stayed on that hill-side in old\r\nYorkshire. This is the true home of his heart and life, here he won his\r\nwealth and found ample room to grow to be the man you honor, and here is\r\none proof among many he has given in all these years, that while he was\r\nborn in England and is proud of it, though he may not say so, he was\r\nborn again in America, and does not love the old land less but the new\r\nland more, as every man must who comes here to share your life, if he is\r\nworth his salt.\r\n\r\nYou will pardon me, I know, as you receive the gift, for this word in\r\npraise of the giver, while he may find it hard to do so; but for that I\r\ndo not care, because in asking me to come here and say the word that was\r\nin my heart he must run his risk and take it as it came to me, and\r\ninsisted on being said. Richard Sugden falls into line with our\r\nhome-born men far and wide, but especially in Massachusetts, who have\r\ndone or are ready to do some such thing as he has done now in\r\nSpencer--building these public libraries in the towns where they live or\r\nfrom which they went away to seek their fortune; public libraries, which\r\nrange with the schools and churches and the town halls; which are the\r\nfour-square defence of our life as citizens of the republic and of our\r\nintelligence and virtue, when they are nobly maintained. They can do no\r\nnobler thing. They are sure of their reward, also, if they want one, in\r\nthe grateful remembrance of their towns and cities, and open the way for\r\nothers again who wonder what they can do to the finest purpose; men who\r\nhave made their fortune and have not been struck by what we may call the\r\ngreenback paralysis, through which the hand that gets takes all the\r\nstrength from the hand that gives. What can we do better, they will say\r\nin such a case, than this Richard Sugden has done for Spencer, and many\r\nanother man far and wide?--see to it that our town also shall have a\r\npublic library, which shall be its pride and joy, and make perfect so\r\nfar as we can the defence from ignorance and vice and crime; open a\r\nfountain from which the waters of life may flow forever for those who\r\nthirst for knowledge or whatever good books can give them? And, as I\r\nhave had to notice up among the mountains this summer how I would not\r\nfeel thirsty till I came to a clear, cool spring, but then would drink\r\nto my heart's content, so such fountains as these will also create the\r\nthirst they can so nobly allay, while still we keep on drinking in\r\nanswer to their perpetual invitation, as the years come and go.\r\n\r\nAnd now shall I tell you a very simple story touching my own life,\r\nwhich will help to make good my thought of the worth of this you are\r\ndoing in Spencer through your free public library, and have been doing,\r\nas I understand, these 30 years, which is in itself a great and singular\r\nhonor to your town, maintaining a free library and reading-room at your\r\nown proper charges, for which your friend and fellow-citizen has built\r\nthis noble edifice, with some such feeling as he had in the old time who\r\nbuilt the temple that the ark of the covenant and the rod which budded\r\nand the sacred books might have an abiding and splendid home. It was my\r\nlot to be born as your friend was and mine, in a poor and small home,\r\nwith this thirst in my nature, as far back as I can remember, for\r\nsomething to read. And I mind very well the first book I ever bought\r\nwith my own penny, the delectable history of Whittington and his Cat,\r\nwhich cast such a spell over my imagination that when I went up Highgate\r\nHill over London the other summer, and saw the stone on which poor Dick\r\nsat down to hear the bells ringing far below, which lured him back again\r\nto fame and fortune, I found I was a small boy again reading my small\r\nwonder-book, and the old stone divided the honors of a tender interest\r\nwith the red granite shaft set above the grave of the woman of finest\r\ngenius England has to her name, George Eliot, which is a few minutes'\r\nwalk away.\r\n\r\nThere were a few books in our small cottage of three rooms, but these\r\nwere among the best in the English tongue, the Bible and Bunyan and\r\nGoldsmith, with a few more I do not now remember, but these I read as\r\nyou drink at clear, cool springs. Then a man came along from over the\r\nmoors and brought Burns with him, and another brought Shakespeare. My\r\nfather borrowed these for me to read, and the world grew great and wide\r\nand wonderful to me as I read them, while to this day I notice that I\r\ncare more for the history of England in Shakespeare's grand dramas than\r\nI do for Hume and Froude and Macaulay, so great was the spell cast again\r\nover my life. Then an old farmer came along with a couple of volumes,\r\nand said, \"Here, lad, I notice thou is fond o' good reading, and I think\r\nthou will like to read these books.\" It was Irving's Sketch-Book and it\r\nwas Christmas day, and I was away from home then and lonesome, wanting\r\nto be with my folks and to sit by the old fireside, but the magic wand\r\nof Irving touched me and stole away all my tears. Still, as you may see,\r\nthis was only hand-to-mouth reading. I had never seen a public library,\r\nbut had heard of them and longed to find one somewhere, sometime, as, I\r\nfear, I never had longed to find my way into heaven. Well, I heard of\r\none that had been started only three miles away, and so I went with my\r\nheart in my mouth to see what I could find to read in the wonderful new\r\nlibrary. I can see the books now standing on the shelves in the small\r\nupper room, and recall the old delight of my youth. I go into the Astor\r\nLibrary now and then when I have time, rich in the lore of all the ages,\r\nand have wandered through some of the finest in the world beside, but\r\nthat small room in Addingham is still the story of one's first love.\r\nThere were some 200 volumes, but here I was with all this wealth of\r\nbooks at my command at about the cost of three days' work in a year. I\r\ncannot tell you the story of that first grand passion and the delight of\r\nit. I had found a library. I like that honest Dutchman, a fine old\r\nscholar says, who told me that one page of Plato did him more good than\r\nten bumpers of wine, and that was the way I felt about those 200\r\nvolumes. I had found out the unspeakable delight of drinking all my\r\nheart could desire, and struck the matchless intoxication of noble and\r\nwholesome books, that leave no headache or heartache when you are sober,\r\nonly it was a good while before I got sober.\r\n\r\nThen I came in due time to this new world and began to work again at the\r\nanvil in Pennsylvania, my own proper business I expected to follow all\r\nmy life, and presently heard of a library in the small town of Hatboro,\r\nsix or seven miles away, six one way and seven the other. A fine old\r\nfarmer had found a long while ago that this was the noblest use he could\r\nmake of a good deal of his money, to build up a library away among the\r\nrich green lands, and so there it was waiting for me with its treasure\r\nof good books. I see them again as they stand on the shelves, and think\r\nI could walk right in and lay my hands on those that won me most\r\npotently and cast their spell again over my heart, though it is five and\r\nthirty years since I was within the doors. I may mention Hawthorne among\r\nthem all as the author I found there for the first time who won my heart\r\nfor good and all, as we may say, and holds it still. Then I found a\r\ngreat treasure in no long time in Philadelphia, that I could no more\r\nexhaust than you can exhaust the spring we have been glancing at by\r\ndrinking, which dips down toward the deepness of the world. I was still\r\nbound fast to the anvil, for this was our living, but there was my life,\r\nso far as good books could make it, rich for me and noble in the great\r\nlibrary again seven miles away. So what matter about the hard day's work\r\nat the anvil, while there was some new volume to read when the day's\r\nwork was done or old one to read with an ever new delight. My new book\r\nor old one, with the sweet green lane in the summer time where I could\r\nwalk while the birds sang their mating song, and the fragrance of the\r\ngreen things growing floated on the soft summer air, and the fireside in\r\nwinter with the good wife busy about the room, and the little ones\r\nsleeping in their cribs, I look back to those times still and wonder\r\nwhether they were not the best I ever knew. I was reading some lines the\r\nother day in an old English ballad written 300 years ago, and they told\r\nthe story of those times:\r\n\r\n  \"O for a booke, and a shadie nook, eyther indoore, or out,\r\n  With the green leaves whisp'ring overhede, or the streete cries all\r\n                                                                   about,\r\n  Where I maie reade, all at my ease, both of the New and Olde,\r\n  For a right good Booke, whereon to looke, was better to me than Golde.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so I touch the story of my own life for some poor evidence of what\r\ngood books can do for us and for the worth of what you have been doing\r\nin Spencer all these years, and are made glad to day by this library\r\nbuilding which crowns the good endeavor; a place that will not shame but\r\nwill glorify your purpose and hold it to the noblest and best endeavors\r\nyou can make in the time to come, for such a shrine will be sure to draw\r\nbooks to it always, worthy of its beauty and grace, and there will be\r\nother men and women also to follow in the steps of Richard Sugden, and\r\nbring to it costly works and rare and beautiful, worthy to be in the\r\npalaces of kings while still you will see to it that the noble provision\r\nof books for the general reading rests directly as it has done so long\r\non your own generous care.\r\n\r\nYou have made this noble boon of good books easy and opulent for the\r\nworkingmen of Spencer. When I came to this new world and had not heard\r\nas yet of that library among the green lands, but must have books on any\r\nterms, and the terms were hard, and the good wife watching not the\r\ndollars but the very cents because they must all be saved to furnish the\r\nlittle home, I can well remember how I bought a book one day for half a\r\ndollar, far too big to smuggle into the cottage, and hid it in the\r\nbushes, watched my chances the next day, and got it in all safe and\r\nsound; and some days after, when she caught me reading, and said, \"Where\r\ndid you get that book, my dear?\" I answered, \"Why, I have had it for\r\nsome time\"; and then she only said, \"Indeed!\" for she was patient with\r\nme and good; and then, it was in what somebody calls our treacle moon.\r\nThe workingmen of Spencer fall on happy times. Here are books easy to\r\ncome at as the water you drink and the air you breathe and stores of\r\nthem which can never be exhausted. If it had come to pass thirty years\r\nago that some man delving in your wild hills had struck gold, and all\r\nthe eager manhood of New England had gone crazy to delve for gold where\r\nSpencer stands, and had found it in mighty stores, I wonder whether that\r\nwould have been such a boon to Spencer and the world as this you have\r\ndone--establishing great industries and wholesome and good; beckoning\r\nthe working forces from far and wide to come here and take hold with you\r\non such terms as we can find nowhere else outside this new world.\r\nBrother McGlynn, I remember, as we rode together to the funeral of Gen.\r\nGrant, called out some half-dozen times, \"God's world for the\r\nworkingman!\" You did this who were the pioneers of the strong and\r\nsteadfast town, and then you said, We must have a free public library,\r\nand pay the bills; we have got our churches started, and our schools,\r\nand our place for town-meeting--the tap-root of the tree of liberty in\r\nNew England, a living tree, and no mere liberty-pole, and reaching down\r\n200 years--now we must complete the walls of the city, which standeth\r\nfour-square, by a free public library, and so do what men may to\r\nmaintain a fair public virtue and intelligence within the lines of\r\nSpencer; these men we employ shall have books to read of every kind any\r\nman ought to read, and the ought shall be large and free and fair; and\r\nso the thing was done.\r\n\r\nThe thirty years have come and gone; the free public library has done\r\nits noble and beautiful work. It is a new departure we touch to-day in\r\nthis ceremony of gift and acceptance. This library will grow always more\r\nworthy the name your friend and neighbor has made for it from this time.\r\nThey say that in Scotland once a man sent for his minister and said, \"If\r\nI give L20,000 to the church do you think it will be reckoned in my\r\naccount when I get through down here?\" And the minister said: \"I do not\r\nfeel sure about that; but it is weel worth the experiment.\" I do feel\r\nsure about this, and the worth of what you can do, to be placed to your\r\ncredit, not yonder but right here in the town of Spencer. There can be\r\nno nobler investment, and but few as noble as this you have made these\r\nthirty years for all who have the hunger and thirst in them good books\r\ncan satisfy; while still with poor Oliver in the story, we ask for more;\r\nand they are not dead things, as Milton says, but contain a potency of\r\nlife as active as the soul from which they sprang:\r\n\r\n    \"Books are each a world; and those we know\r\n    Are a substantial world both pure and good;\r\n    Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,\r\n    Our pastime and our happiness will grow.\r\n                And books are yours\r\n    Within whose silent chambers treasure lies\r\n    Preserved from age to age; more precious far\r\n    Than that accumulated store of gold\r\n    And orient gems, which for a day of need\r\n    The Sultans hide deep in ancestral vaults.\r\n    These stores of truth you can unlock at will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS AND LIFE\r\n\r\n    The influence of books on the community has been used in\r\n    this address by Dean (now President) Birge as a basis for\r\n    discussing their reaction on special groups, especially\r\n    those differentiated by age and sex, and how far the library\r\n    should be guided by it and take advantage of it. It is\r\n    perhaps the best general treatment of the group features of\r\n    socialized library work by a speaker of authority, not a\r\n    professional librarian.\r\n\r\n    Edward Asahel Birge was born at Troy, N.Y., Sept. 7, 1851,\r\n    graduated at Williams in 1873 and since 1875 has been a\r\n    member of the University of Wisconsin faculty, serving\r\n    successively as instructor in natural history, professor of\r\n    zoology, dean of the college of arts and sciences, acting\r\n    president, and finally in 1919, president of the University.\r\n    He has also served as a director of the Free Library at\r\n    Madison, and in 1906 was president of the Wisconsin Library\r\n    Association, before whom this address was delivered.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the subject to which I would call your attention is the\r\noften observed fact of the extent to which modern life in all of its\r\nphases, is becoming based upon books. I say in all of its phases, for we\r\nare concerned with the present extent of this relation between books and\r\nlife with its rapid increase, rather than with its existence. Ever since\r\nthe beginning of human society men have based their actions on the\r\nteachings of experience. Part of these teachings each individual has\r\ndirectly derived from his environment, and he has supplemented and\r\nenlarged them by means of those coming from the remembered experience of\r\nothers, often belonging to an older generation. Later in history there\r\nwere added those teachings derived from books--from the recorded\r\nexperience of others. With that enlargement of the basis of human action\r\nwhich comes from the remembered experience of others we, as librarians,\r\nhave nothing to do, and, indeed, there is little to say about it now\r\nwhich could not have been said with equal propriety, one, two, or twenty\r\ncenturies ago. With books the case is different. The last century, the\r\nlast generation, the last decade--each has seen the transfer of the\r\nbasis of action from the oral to the printed word, which could be\r\nparalleled by no other period of equal length in the history of\r\ncivilization. The story of this transfer from talk to print, from rule\r\nof thumb to textbook, from tradition to school, from practise to\r\nscience, is long and intensely interesting. I can touch only a few\r\nphases of it.\r\n\r\nFirst consider the lengthening of the school period for children. I do\r\nnot think it is possible accurately to compare the present length of\r\nthis period with that which existed a century or a half ago; nor would\r\nsuch a comparison interest us. It is enough for our purpose to know that\r\nyears have been added to the school life of many thousands of the youth\r\nof all classes. As a single illustration, consider the effect of the\r\nhigh school, whose development into a large and popular institution, an\r\ninstitution affecting great masses of the people, belongs almost wholly\r\nto the period within the life of the generation now on the stage. A half\r\ncentury ago the public high school was almost unknown and the private\r\nacademy reached very few persons. Only a generation ago the number of\r\nstudents in secondary schools was hardly one-tenth of the present\r\nnumber. The attendance on institutions of secondary grade has thus\r\nincreased five times as rapidly as the population. Within the past\r\nfifteen years the attendance in the high schools of Milwaukee has more\r\nthan trebled, while only a little more than fifty per cent. has been\r\nadded to the population of the city. In Racine almost exactly the same\r\nratio holds, and so for many other cities of the United States, the\r\nincrease being least marked in New England cities, and greatest in the\r\ncities of the West.\r\n\r\nThe formative influence of the high school youth are far more\r\nextensively and exclusively books than were those of his father or\r\ngrandfather, who probably began to learn his trade, or his business, at\r\nabout the age when his boy enters the high school, and who therefore,\r\nduring the period of adolescence, received his training from action\r\nrather than from study, from oral rather than from printed experience.\r\n\r\nOne may find to-day in the writings of many teachers jeremiads over the\r\nshortness of the average school life of children. I would not contradict\r\ntheir statistics and would join in their regrets, but the fact remains\r\nthat the most striking phenomenon in the life of the children of the\r\npast thirty years is the extent to which their training has been\r\ncommitted to the use of books and the rapid growth of the use of books\r\nas the period has advanced. Few as the school years of the children now\r\nare, those of any older generation have been fewer. This aspect of the\r\nmatter is the one that is of interest to us, and the school life of the\r\npresent, instead of arousing our regrets by its brevity, may well call\r\nout our astonishment by its length, and demand the use of our best wits\r\nto see the changes which have been caused in the life of the present and\r\nto forecast those which in the future will flow from this fundamental\r\nchange in education.\r\n\r\nOne of these correlated changes is already apparent--the extension of\r\nthe period of book learning for many thousands of persons into the\r\ncollege and university course.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the total attendance on colleges in the United States was about\r\nten thousand. Half a century later, when the population of the country\r\nhad increased about three and one-third times, the college students had\r\nincreased in a tenfold ratio, or more than three times as rapidly as the\r\npopulation. Even more significant is the growth of the number of college\r\nstudents in more recent years. Since 1889 the number has more than\r\ndoubled, thus continuing in the latest years a ratio of growth with\r\nreference to population quite as great as in earlier years.\r\n\r\nAn equally significant, and quite as conspicuous change, is seen in the\r\ngrowth of technical education. Thirty years ago, when I came to\r\nWisconsin, the university was graduating from two or three and a half\r\ndozen engineers yearly, and these could not all find occupation in this\r\ncommonwealth, with a population then of more than a million people. Now\r\na hundred graduates go out at Commencement, while the population of the\r\nstate has little more than doubled, and while other engineering schools\r\nof high rank have multiplied all around it.\r\n\r\nNowadays the man of books, rather than the man of tradition is directing\r\nthe work of the world. In the copper mines of the north the\r\nold-fashioned mine captain, who received his profession and his\r\ntraditions from his father, is disappearing and has almost vanished. His\r\nplace is taken by the graduate of a mining school, who interprets what\r\nhe sees, not by the light of the experience of his elders, communicated\r\nto him orally, but by the far clearer light of the collective experience\r\nof men embodied in books.\r\n\r\nWhen the capitalist now desires to explore for new iron mines he employs\r\nnot the old-fashioned prospector, but puts into the field a party of\r\nyoung men often fresh from the geological laboratory. Thus science,\r\norganized knowledge, book learning, is driving out with increasing\r\nrapidity the picturesque figures of past times--times wholly past,\r\nthough only just behind us in years. That \"bookish theoric,\" so detested\r\nby Iago, is apparently firmly in control of affairs and has displaced\r\nits predecessors and rivals.\r\n\r\nIn countless other ways the same fact is shown. Half a century ago a\r\nyouth who desired to become a lawyer or a doctor entered the office of a\r\npractitioner and learned his profession by practise and experience. Now\r\nhe goes to the school of law or medicine and gains his entrance to his\r\nchosen calling by the way of books and laboratories. Even commerce and\r\ntrade, in which the rules of practical experience seem most firmly\r\nentrenched, are shifting their basis to books, and schools of commerce\r\nand trade schools are springing up on every hand to give youth a broader\r\nfoundation of knowledge than can be gained from practise. Still more\r\nsignificant are the facts shown by the enormous development of\r\nagricultural experiment stations, farmers' bulletins and farmers'\r\ninstitutes. Agriculture, that calling which of all others is most\r\nancient and most conservative, is rapidly changing its basis from\r\ntradition to books. Perhaps I ought not to say \"most conservative,\" for\r\nthere is one calling which may better deserve the title--that of the\r\ndomestic industries practised by women. Yet even here a beginning of the\r\ntransfer, although a small one, has been made by schools of domestic\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nWhile this beginning is but small, and while the traditional professions\r\nof women have not yet been greatly modified by books, the life of no\r\nclass of the community has been more profoundly affected by this general\r\nchange than has that of women. With the passing away of home industries\r\nand with the great increase of wealth which the past century, or half\r\ncentury, has seen, have come vastly increased opportunities to women for\r\nleisure, for release from domestic duties, and for the prolongation of\r\nschool life. The statistics of high schools and colleges sufficiently\r\nshow the use which they are making of this leisure. Other facts are\r\nequally obvious and significant as showing the transfer of the basis of\r\nwoman's life from domestic experience to books. The woman's club, I\r\nsuppose, may be said fairly to take the place of the sewing circle of\r\nour mothers and grandmothers. The contrast even in the name is\r\nsignificant, as marking the transfer of interest from the circle of\r\ndomestic experience to the wider domain of the recorded life of the\r\nworld, to the realm of books.\r\n\r\nThus at whatever point we examine the life of the present, we find it\r\nbasing itself on books, both for action and enjoyment, and that in an\r\never-increasing degree. This truth is peculiarly evident to you as\r\nlibrarians, since the facts of your own profession and the rapid growth\r\nof libraries and library work afford one of the latest phases of this\r\ngeneral movement.\r\n\r\nFrom 1875 to 1896 the number of libraries in the United States just\r\nabout doubled, increasing steadily, and adding, during this period,\r\nabout 2,000 libraries, or a little less than 100 per year. From 1896 to\r\n1900, 1,350 libraries were added, or about 450 per year. From 1900 to\r\n1903, 1,500 libraries were founded, or 500 per year. In the past ten\r\nyears the number of libraries must have doubled; a ratio growth at least\r\nfour times that of the population....\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the adjustment of the library to this movement of\r\nmen's minds towards books is the most important practical question for\r\nall of us. Questions of management, of administration, of methods are\r\nall of secondary importance beside this one--if, indeed they may be\r\ncalled even secondary. For this change of base is a revolutionary\r\naffair, not a mere matter of readjustment of detail, and it is no easy\r\ntask for the library to find itself in such a movement. Libraries are so\r\nsmall a part of the national intellectual life, so small, in the mass,\r\nfor example, in comparison to the great universities, that their proper\r\ninfluence and work are easily overlooked. There is sometimes danger that\r\nthey may be swept into currents guided by other forces rather than find\r\nopportunity freely to contribute their own share to the movement.\r\n\r\nLet us turn then to the more practical side of the question, and ask how\r\nthe library is adjusting itself, in this changed relation of men, where\r\nit has best succeeded, and where it still has most to do. Let us ask\r\nwhere experience seems to promise successful solution of problems, and\r\nwhere the problems are in that stage in which only doubtful success can\r\nbe expected from experiments, and final solution still lies far before\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe library began as a place to keep books, permitting their use by the\r\npublic, but often under such restrictions as seem to indicate that this\r\nservice was granted \"grudgingly and of necessity.\" Books and the high\r\nlife were in some obscure way correlated in the mind of the librarian,\r\nand he too often seemed to feel that these were treasures not to be\r\nshared by the many. The first change which came, therefore, as the\r\nlibrary was swept into the general intellectual current of time, was the\r\nremoval of restrictions on the use of books and their replacement by\r\ndevices intended to encourage and extend that use. A second step, and a\r\nmuch more revolutionary one, has been to teach the community directly\r\nthe uses of books, and thus not merely to afford easy conditions for the\r\nuse of books on the part of those who want them, but to add a positive\r\nforce which will compel the books to go out in the community, there to\r\nperform their present service and to create a demand for an increased\r\nservice in the future.\r\n\r\nThis change marks a fundamental departure of the library from its old\r\nbasis, and one which will affect it greatly, for good and perhaps for\r\nill. The movement toward freedom of administration was really concerned\r\nwith small matters, and left unaltered the central plan and purpose of\r\nthe library. But with the assumption of direct educational work for\r\nchildren, for women, for men, the library has entered upon a new epoch\r\nin its evolution. It has taken up duties whose performance will demand\r\ngreatly enlarged resources--of space and of money, of books and of\r\nworking staff. And what is of even greater importance, the purpose, the\r\npoint of view, of those who control the library, and the temper of the\r\nadministration, will change, and ought to change, under the pressure of\r\nthese new duties.\r\n\r\nThis positive and educational library work falls into two main\r\ntypes--that for children, and that for adults--both men and women. It is\r\nstill in a tentative condition, in a formative and experimental period.\r\nThe results are still so few and recent that they do not admit any exact\r\nformulation. They permit only general and suggestive statement.\r\n\r\nWork for children is, in some ways, the easiest educational attempt of\r\nthe library, since it runs parallel to the work of the schools, and\r\nthose for whom the work is done are easily reached and easily guided.\r\nIts function is, of course, in part to supplement the school. It would\r\nbe, however, a great misfortune if it were looked upon merely as a\r\nsupplement to the school, as a means of providing reading which the\r\nschool ought to buy, but cannot afford. Its purpose is rather to begin\r\nin childhood, both for pleasure and for profit, a voluntary association\r\nwith books which lie wholly outside of the school program. It aims to\r\nbegin the early formation of the habit of reading as distinguished from\r\nstudy--a habit which will be permanent, instead of ending with the\r\nperiod of formal instruction. It recognizes the fact that school life\r\nmust soon end, and that when the end comes, the important feature of the\r\nchild's intellectual condition is not so much the amount he has learned\r\nas the temper and habit of his mind toward books. Has he merely learned\r\ncertain truths from books or are books open to him? It is of fundamental\r\nimportance to the community that the second alternative be secured. The\r\nschool libraries and children's librarians are, therefore, not to feel\r\nthat their duty is to supplement the school. That duty lies on a\r\ndifferent, and, in a way, a higher plane, in a more spiritual region. It\r\nis their part to make the child a citizen of the world of books, and to\r\nnaturalize him so thoroughly that he will always remain a citizen. Thus\r\nonly can he share fully, not only in the high and permanent pleasures\r\nthat books afford, but also in that great movement of life toward books\r\nwhich marks our time.\r\n\r\nFrom remarks which I have heard on various occasions, I believe this\r\nextension of library service and library duties to youth has often been\r\nmisunderstood. Work with school children, whether done by the library\r\nforce as part of their duties, or by assistants especially engaged, has\r\nseemed to many to be a somewhat unnecessary extension of the\r\nlibrary--something of a luxury. These added duties have often been\r\nassumed by the libraries under special pleas, and for reasons temporary\r\nin character. But in that wider view which I am trying to present, the\r\ntruth is recognized that the library is a permanent storehouse of books\r\nfor the community, to which the citizen of every class and age must\r\nrepair for knowledge not only interesting and useful but necessary to\r\nthe conduct of life. We recognize also that while the training of the\r\nschools soon ceases for every individual, the service of the library\r\nextends throughout life. We assert also that the possibilities of this\r\nservice must be taught to the members of the community from childhood,\r\nand that the efficiency of the books will largely depend on the\r\nefficiency with which this teaching is done.\r\n\r\nEspecial care must be taken with children and youth toward the end of\r\nthe ordinary school periods--in the upper grades and in the high school.\r\nHere it is that the transition to independent reading must come. The\r\nchildren's room must not be merely an appendage to the kindergarten and\r\nprimary school, but the library must supply to youth of all ages not\r\nonly books, but inspiration in reading. The questions which arise in\r\nwork for children are many and often perplexing, but if these general\r\nprinciples are accepted, they are, after all, questions of detail rather\r\nthan of principle.\r\n\r\nThe library's influence over women has been the greatest in extent and\r\nproductive of the largest results; so much so that, in the opinion of\r\nmany critics of the public library, that institution is in danger of\r\nbecoming \"feminized.\" I shall not attempt to discuss so large a subject\r\nas that indicated by this fearful word, but it may not be unprofitable\r\nto touch upon the causes which have given the work of the library for\r\nwomen at once so great an extension and so great a success, as well as\r\nsome obvious limitations. I should place first among the causes, both\r\nfor the success and the limitation of this influence, the recent\r\nacquisition by women of large opportunities for the intellectual life,\r\ntheir natural conservatism, and their greatly increased leisure as\r\ncompared with men. That women read books, and read them in enormous\r\nnumbers, is granted, indeed asserted. That they read seriously I have\r\nheard questioned and have always wondered at the doubt. It seems to me\r\nrather that they never read in any way except seriously. How many\r\nwomen--reading women, I mean--can put away an unfinished book without a\r\nsense of guilt? How many can \"browse about\" in a library and enjoy doing\r\nso? How many really like to read a dictionary or encyclopaedia without\r\nulterior designs upon an article for the women's club, or, at least,\r\nwithout wanting to know something? These are all tests--unconscious, but\r\nnone the less excellent--of the real readers, of those to whom books are\r\nalive and intimate friends. While I have no statistics at hand, I fear\r\nthat many women most devoted to libraries would fail to reach this\r\nstandard. The field of the intellectual life has been widely opened to\r\nwomen so recently that they still feel a certain sense of duty along\r\nwith the privilege which is granted them in entering it, rather than a\r\ncomplete sense of being at home there. The conservatism of women helps\r\nthis tendency to read seriously and for general purposes. The\r\ntraditional use of books as a means of culture appeals to their more\r\nconservative mind as it does not to men. They are more easily induced to\r\nread for reading's sake--they are willing to read the books one ought to\r\nread. They are moved by considerations of mental improvement independent\r\nof any result beyond the improvement itself. The library as a library\r\nattracts them. Then, too, the amount of their reading and its character\r\nis modified by the fact that women are so much more limited than men in\r\nmeans to pass their leisure. Jerome K. Jerome (if correctly reported by\r\nnewspapers) recently pointed out that much so-called reading is no more\r\nan intellectual process than is smoking a cigar, and that often we go to\r\nbooks just as to the cigar, to pass the time and to prevent the\r\nintrusion of disagreeable thoughts. Of course this is, and ought to be,\r\nwholly true, and since with us the cigar is a masculine privilege, the\r\nwoman must take to books as the man takes to smoking, and even to\r\ndrinking. Speaking seriously, the library is to many women a relief from\r\ncare--the only distraction from the monotony of routine. It is a cheap\r\nand easy thing to sneer at this use of books, but we who believe in the\r\nfriendship of books know that here lies one of the greatest blessings\r\nthey can give, as it is one of the greatest blessings of true\r\nfriendship. Nor do we wonder that the uncultivated, or the\r\nhalf-cultivated, often choose their book friends from a class not\r\ngreatly above their own.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, women have hardly begun to use books on lines along\r\nwhich we are seeking to get men to read--in directions connected with\r\ntheir trade or profession. Domestic industries, so far as they are in\r\nthe hands of women, are still most wholly dependent upon tradition. They\r\nare not exposed to competition. Failure or inefficiency does not put the\r\nproprietor out of business. Their results are not measured in dollars\r\nand cents. In a word, the whole line of motives which is forcing\r\nmasculine industries over to the basis of books is lacking in the chief\r\nfeminine occupations. We are now seeing only the feeble beginnings of\r\nthe attempt thus to transfer them from tradition to science. A long time\r\nmust pass, and social conditions greatly change, before the transfer is\r\nmade. Thus women are not forced from general to special lines of\r\nreading, while they have greater motive for general reading than have\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAs a result, women are becoming, to a degree without example in the\r\npast, the possessors and transmitters of the life of culture. I do not\r\nbelieve that fewer men read good literature than formerly, but the\r\nincrease in masculine readers of this type has been so much less than\r\nthe increase in women readers that in comparison the number of men seems\r\nto have shrunken greatly. Of course much of this reading by women for\r\nculture is desultory and aimless, much is misdirected. But after all\r\ndeductions are made, it remains true that the knowledge of books seems\r\nto be tending to become the possession of women rather than of men. It\r\nhas always belonged to a certain class of men--not a very large part of\r\nthe community--and it is still theirs; but its extension to other\r\nclasses has been along female lines rather than male, and its\r\ntransmission to the next generation seems only too likely to depend in a\r\nlarge measure upon the female line. College statistics at present show\r\nthe same facts. Language, literature, and art are the chosen studies of\r\nwomen. Men turn rather to science, economics, or politics--subjects\r\nwhich, they suppose, bear directly on future plans for life. These great\r\nsubjects whose main purpose in education is the uplifting of the mind,\r\nthe widening of the mental horizon without direct reference to any\r\nspecific line of life--these appeal far more strongly to women than to\r\nmen, and their influence, in a rapidly increasing degree, will reach the\r\nnext generation through the mother rather than through the father. It\r\nwould be a pessimistic view which would say that modern society is\r\ncoming to depend on the mothers for the accumulation and transmission of\r\nculture, while retaining in the male line the function of accumulating\r\nand transmitting wealth, though much could be said for the thesis and a\r\nvery plausible argument could be constructed for it.\r\n\r\nIf all this is true, it is inevitable that women should use libraries\r\nfar more than men. It is equally inevitable that in this large use much\r\nshould be trivial, much customary, much misdirected and unwise. Nature\r\nhas no means of reaching success except by the rule of natural\r\nselection--the old-fashioned plan of \"cut-and-try,\" and this means much\r\nfailure along the road of advance. We who see the work of the library\r\nfrom our daily experience know how much it is contributing of culture,\r\nhow much of happiness, to the life of women, and through them to that of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nBut men--why do they not use the library, say the critics, and what\r\nshall the library do to increase its use by men? You have all read the\r\nvigorous article that the _Independent_ published on this subject last\r\nsummer, which, with much of error, contains a good deal of truth in a\r\nstimulating form. It presents a subject which must have a somewhat\r\nlarger treatment.\r\n\r\nIt ought first to be said that in this and other articles on the topic\r\nthe terms _women_ and _men_ are by no means similarly used. The writers\r\nare not concerned about men at large--the husbands and brothers of the\r\nwomen who are said to visit the library--the women of comparative\r\nleisure, who are seeking information on art, literature, or ancestry,\r\nwho are trying to get up a paper for the club, or who visit the library\r\nfor recreation. It is the plumber, the machinist, the grocer, whose\r\nabsence they deplore, and to whom they think the library ought to give\r\nhelp. Not only so, but it is the plumber, rather than as a man, whose\r\npresence is desired and who is to be aided. The library, says the\r\n_Independent_ in effect, ought to teach the plumber how to \"plumb\";\r\nought to furnish him with information which his boss is unable to give.\r\nBut this is a new function for libraries, however useful it may be, and\r\na function which libraries do not attempt for women. Dressmakers do not\r\n(I speak under correction, but I think I am right) expect to secure at a\r\nlibrary a knowledge of how to fit a difficult customer, any more than do\r\ntailors. Yet this sort of thing, we are told, the library ought to do\r\nfor men; and we are told in a tone which implies that here is an obvious\r\nduty which only wilful ignorance can overlook.\r\n\r\nIt ought rather to be recognized that in undertaking this work the\r\npublic library is entering a new and almost unexplored field of effort,\r\nand also that it is trying to extend its influence to classes of the\r\ncommunity which it has not hitherto reached, and along lines of\r\nknowledge which it has never seriously attempted to follow. In such a\r\nwork there must be many experiments and many failures, and the positive\r\nresults will be small for a long time....\r\n\r\nThe problem for the library, as regards men, is therefore twofold: 1.\r\nCan men be induced to visit the library for general purposes, to use it\r\nin ways similar to those for which women come to it? 2. How can the\r\nwage-earners and handicraftsmen be induced to visit the library and use\r\nits books for their practical advantage?\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the general question: Can we reach the men? The\r\nwomen come to the libraries, say the critics, in shoals and droves, for\r\nall sorts of intellectual purposes, good and bad. You catch the\r\nchildren, they say, in school, when they cannot get away, and indeed are\r\nglad of relief from lessons; but the men--can you reach them and affect\r\ntheir lives? In reply we must say at once and frankly that no such large\r\nvolume of success with men is possible as has been the case with women.\r\nThe public library came to women at the precise moment when increased\r\neducation disposed them to use it, and increased leisure gave them the\r\nopportunity. It fills a space in their lives which would be otherwise\r\nvoid. But the present time is one of decreased leisure and increased\r\nintensity of work for all classes of men. Perhaps I ought to except from\r\nthis statement the wage-earner, who as eight hour laws and customs come\r\ninto force will have more time for reading than the man of almost any\r\nother class in the community. This movement toward lessened hours of\r\nlabor is more effective where libraries are best organized and therefore\r\npresents an opportunity for the extension of library influence, both\r\ngeneral and special. The opportunity must be improved, yet neither the\r\nwage-earner nor the business man will be easy to reach; neither has been\r\namong the active patrons of the library in the past. Their lives are\r\nalready full, both with business and pleasure, and if the library is to\r\nreach them, it must attract them on lines which appeal to them more\r\nstrongly than business or present pleasure. It must reach needs which\r\nthey know and feel to be real.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that men of the present generation will come to\r\nlibraries in great numbers for the purposes that attract women. We might\r\nas well admit that they will not substitute the novel for the cigar, the\r\nprinted story for the companionship of the club. They will not read good\r\nbooks because they ought to do so, and the number who will read them\r\nbecause they like to do so is unfortunately not great. Men have not thus\r\nacted since the world began, and man-like, they will not do so now, even\r\nthough such conduct on their part would help our library statistics very\r\ngreatly. Nor will any great number of them read in order to enlarge the\r\nbasis of life, for, in spite of the greatness of the movement toward\r\nbooks, it affects at first hand only a few people in the community. The\r\nmass of workmen, now and always, will get their knowledge from tradition\r\nor at second hand. It will be the unusual man who will get his ideas\r\nfrom books at first hand and thus improve his work and that of his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nThe problem is then to reach these few, and through them the community;\r\nand this brings us to the second phase of the question. I do not find\r\nthat the problem has been solved; perhaps it is too recent. But\r\nlibraries have been attempting its solution by various methods and with\r\nvarying success.\r\n\r\nThe first and most successful attempt is that of the large libraries,\r\nlike that of Pittsburgh and the Pratt Institute of Brooklyn, which\r\nmaintain a technical library for the men--a library adequately housed in\r\nits own rooms and administered by a special librarian. These technical\r\nlibraries for working men succeed in their aim of reaching many of the\r\nclass for which they are established. They offer not merely an\r\nopportunity for reading, but that guidance in the use of books which all\r\nclasses of the community need, if they are to use books for a serious\r\npurpose. They show us that success in this line of effort may be reached\r\nif the library has an income sufficient to enable it to undertake the\r\ntask on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThis condition is, however, not that of most of the libraries which are\r\nrepresented here. Our incomes are none too large for the work which we\r\nmust necessarily do for the general public. Such libraries must\r\nordinarily content themselves with offering to men opportunities for\r\nreading without special guidance in the use of books. This work has been\r\nattempted in a good many of the smaller libraries. They attempt to\r\nprovide masculine conditions for reading and reading material which will\r\nappeal to men. The first includes a well-furnished, comfortable room for\r\nmen, where a man can come in his working clothes without feeling he is\r\nout of place; smoking may be allowed or not--both plans are tried\r\nwithout great difference in apparent result. The masculine reading\r\ncomprises newspapers and magazines; good books of literature which can\r\nbe left in the room (paper bound copies suggested); most important of\r\nall are trade journals; if possible, files of the recent volumes of\r\nthese journals, selected according to the industries of each town; and\r\nthe most readable and most recent reference books on similar subjects.\r\nIn a word, a room is furnished with reading which will appeal to the\r\nclasses of men who do not ordinarily use libraries and who are not\r\ngreatly interested in literature.\r\n\r\nThis plan is good one and ought to be tried, but I believe the\r\nconditions are exceptional under which it will reach large numbers of\r\nmen. Inertia and habit will keep most of them away from the library.\r\nThey will see the daily papers at their wonted places of resort, and the\r\nroom, necessarily lacking in much of the freedom of the club, will fail\r\nto attract very many of them. They will not form the habit of visiting\r\nit, even though they might enjoy it if the habit were formed. It must\r\nalso be remembered that increasing numbers of the manufacturing concerns\r\nare providing their employees with reading of this kind, and thus\r\nlimiting the use of the city library.\r\n\r\nIn some libraries the attempt to reach men has gone still further and\r\nhas led to an inclusion of attractions which are ordinarily regarded as\r\noutside the work of a library. They have attempted to combine to some\r\ndegree the privileges of a club with that of the public library. The\r\nStevens Point Library has a club room, equipped with billiard tables,\r\ncards, etc., as well as with technical journals and similar books. This,\r\nthe librarian reports, is very successful in attracting boys, many of\r\nwhom learn to use the library. Men, however, do not come in large\r\nnumbers, as they do not care to use a place frequented by boys, and in\r\nwhich smoking is not permitted. At Wausaukee a special room with games\r\nand where lunch is served has been established at the library as a means\r\nof furnishing a sort of club room for lumber men who come to the\r\nvillage, especially on Sunday, and who have no other place of resort,\r\nexcept the saloon. How far such methods are advisable as a part of\r\nlibrary work is a question which will often be asked during the coming\r\nyears and which only experience can answer. At present such enterprises\r\nhave not gone beyond the stage of early experiment.\r\n\r\nSumming up the result, I would frankly confess that the reports which I\r\nhave received are not numerous enough for a positive judgment, yet it is\r\nmy impression that where there is an income large enough to provide a\r\nspecial librarian and a public large enough to warrant the expense, this\r\nmovement for special libraries for men is likely to succeed. It seems\r\nalso to be true that where the library provides the men with the\r\nopportunity for reading only, and does not furnish guidance for readers,\r\nno very large use is made of technical books and there is no greatly\r\nincreased use of the library in general. How to guide the reading seems,\r\ntherefore, to be the central factor in the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nIn a small town a special librarian is impossible, for financial\r\nreasons, but there, as well as in large cities, lectures can be given\r\nwhich deal with practical subjects and the aid to their knowledge which\r\nthe library affords. Many cities are giving such courses of lectures,\r\nnotably perhaps New York, and with considerable effect on the use of the\r\npublic library. I have no statistics regarding such lectures from the\r\nvarious cities, but undoubtedly this method offers the easiest plan for\r\nextending the use of the library in smaller cities and towns. I say the\r\n_easiest_, and it will not be difficult to secure good lectures on\r\nliterature, history, or art, but lectures on the practical subjects are\r\nmuch more difficult to obtain, since it is hard to secure lecturers who\r\nknow more about the trades than do the craftsmen who constitute the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nIf these movements are to succeed, they must not be attempted in an\r\namateurish way. They must be well planned and well executed--planned and\r\nexecuted with careful reference to the wants of the men of the\r\ncommunity. Above all, they must be persistently carried out with full\r\nvigor year after year, even though results are apparently small. Their\r\npurpose must be steadfastly maintained and the methods of execution\r\ncontinually readjusted, as success or failure indicates. It is no light\r\nor easy thing to change the habits of half the adult members of the\r\ncommunity--to cultivate the reading habit in those who have reached\r\nmaturity without acquiring it--and the work which the library proposes\r\nfor itself involves such a task.\r\n\r\nIf men are to be reached at all it must be on a business basis, not on\r\nthat of occasional effort. Nor must the missionary spirit prevail, for\r\nmen, as a rule, do not wish to be reformed or to be helped. They must\r\nfind in the library a place which appeals to their sense of comfort and\r\nwhich gives them things that they want, or, like other sensible people,\r\nthey will not use it.\r\n\r\nOne word in closing this topic, and that in emphasis of what I have\r\nalready said. It is easier to keep a boy reading as he grows up than to\r\ncatch him again as a man after the library has lost him. Take a lesson\r\nfrom the church. The boy who graduates from Sunday-school rarely returns\r\nfor a post-graduate course. In the wise administration of the work for\r\nchildren and youth lies the main hope not of reaching, but keeping men\r\nin the library.\r\n\r\nBut it should be definitely understood that this enlargement of library\r\nwork which the times are forcing upon us means increasing expense, more\r\nroom, more books--which must be more frequently renewed--and a larger\r\nlibrary staff. It means the attempt to do efficiently several lines of\r\nintellectual work for the public instead of purveying literature for\r\nthose who desire it. This new work the library can readily accomplish,\r\nbut not with the staff which was sufficient for the old duties. Any\r\nlibrary can provide, for example, the list of desiderata mentioned in\r\nthe _Independent's_ article, which could easily be extended. They can\r\nall be furnished by the library as the public wants them and will pay\r\nfor them. They cannot be, and ought not to be, supplied by an already\r\noverworked library staff of two or three persons.\r\n\r\nThe library, therefore, should not enter upon these duties blindly or\r\nignorantly. It is a great task which is thus undertaken--to educate the\r\ncommunity to use books and to guide it in that use. Although small\r\nbeginnings are possible, the work will inevitably grow on our hands just\r\nas that of the schools and colleges has done, and for similar reasons.\r\nBut whatever difficulties lie in the way of their performance, it is\r\nplain that the library must assume these new duties. With many\r\nexperiments, with many failures, with many partial successes, the\r\nlibrary will extend its teachings, its conscious influences, until they\r\ntouch the life of the community at every point.\r\n\r\nIn this rambling talk I have discussed library work as it looks forward\r\nto new problems, and have devoted only a word, and that perhaps a rather\r\ndisparaging one, to the traditional use of the library. I would not\r\nleave the subject in this way. For the traditional use of books remains\r\nand will remain the center of library work and the main source of its\r\nbest influences. The problem of the library to-day, looked at from\r\nwithin and not from without, and in relation to other agencies, is\r\nessentially that which confronts the university. Both institutions once\r\nstood for culture and for culture exclusively. Both are now challenged\r\nby the spirit of the newer time and are called upon to justify\r\nthemselves as public utilities. This they must do, and that in full\r\nmeasure, but there is a real danger that both, in the multiplicity of\r\nthe new duties thus forced upon them, may forget the weighty words,\r\n\"these ought ye to do and not leave the other undone.\" For, after all,\r\nthe highest public utility which the library offers, or can offer, is\r\nthe opportunity to cultivate the friendship of books. This utility is\r\nnone the less precious because it is intangible. Indeed, it is the\r\nunique privilege of the library among municipal enterprises that it can\r\nprovide a service which aids the higher life of the citizen so directly\r\nand so purely. In the spirituality of this function, the library stands\r\nsecond only to the highest institutions of pure learning, and to the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nNo new undertaking, no extension of work, no plea of necessity can\r\nwarrant or justify any loss of power on this highest level. The problem\r\nis not to discover how to sacrifice as little as possible of the old\r\nspirit to the new duties, but to learn how through the new duties we may\r\nmake more wide-spread and more potent for good that oldest and best\r\ninheritance from the past--the love of books.\r\n\r\n\"The people's university,\" the library has been called, but it would be\r\nas great a pity if the librarian so understood this term as to believe\r\nthat people came to the library only to learn, as it would be if any\r\nwent there who could not learn what they sought. That university which\r\nis a place to study rather than a place to live is missing its best\r\npossibilities, and in a similar way the library ought to be, first and\r\nalways, a place to read rather than a place to study. I would not go so\r\nfar as to say that I want to find it a place to \"loaf,\" though I might\r\nbe provoked into saying so; but certainly it must be a place where I can\r\n\"invite my soul\"--such a place as the world gives me elsewhere only in\r\nthe church or in the silence of nature. Trade journals and technical\r\nworks are of great use; books for women's clubs are good things; the\r\nchildren's room is a necessity; but these of themselves no more make a\r\nlibrary than a kitchen, dining room and bedroom make a home. Out of such\r\nutilities as these you may get a boarding house, but nothing better; the\r\nfamily makes it a home. Those are wholly wrong who believe that standard\r\nbooks are so cheap that anyone can buy them, and therefore the library\r\ncould conceivably get on without them. Without the best literature you\r\nmight get a very useful institution, no doubt, but not a library, for in\r\na library the great works of the great authors are the soul and theirs\r\nis the spirit which enables the library not merely to contribute to the\r\nadvance of the community toward prosperity and intelligence, but also,\r\nin some degree, to touch its higher life to finer issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\nAN ADDRESS AT ITS DEDICATION\r\n\r\n    This and the four addresses that follow it have little in\r\n    common except that all were delivered at the opening\r\n    exercises of libraries. Everett's address at the opening of\r\n    the Boston Public Library appropriately heads the group. The\r\n    reader will look in it in vain for any reflection of the\r\n    conservative opinions expressed in the letter to George\r\n    Ticknor printed on page 53 of this volume, unless perhaps in\r\n    the total absence of anything radical. It is typical oratory\r\n    of the day--ponderously graceful, if that is not a\r\n    contradiction in terms.\r\n\r\n    Edward Everett was born in Dorchester, Mass., April 11,\r\n    1794. He graduated at Harvard in 1811 and served there as\r\n    professor of Greek in 1819-25. He was a member of Congress\r\n    in 1825-35, governor of Massachusetts in 1836-40, minister\r\n    to Great Britain in 1841-45, president of Harvard, 1846-49,\r\n    U.S. secretary of state in 1852-53, and U.S. senator in\r\n    1853-54. He died in Boston, Jan. 15, 1865. His reputation as\r\n    a scholarly orator was very high.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MAYOR:--\r\n\r\nIn behalf of the Trustees of the City Library, I receive with extreme\r\npleasure the keys which you have placed in my hands. The completion of\r\nthe noble building, which the city government now confides to our care,\r\nis an event to which the Trustees have looked forward with the greatest\r\ninterest, and which they now contemplate with the highest satisfaction.\r\nThey deem themselves especially honored in their connection with an\r\ninstitution, for whose use this stately and commodious edifice has been\r\nerected, and which they doubt not is destined to be instrumental of the\r\nhighest good to the community, and to reflect lasting credit upon the\r\nliberality, public and private, with which it has been founded and\r\nendowed.\r\n\r\nThe city of Boston, owing to peculiar circumstances in its growth and\r\nhistory, has been at all times, as I think, beyond most cities in the\r\nworld, the object of an affectionate attachment on the part of its\r\ninhabitants; a feeling entitled to respect and productive of good, even\r\nif it may sometimes seem to strangers over-partial in its\r\nmanifestations. It is not merely its commanding natural situation, the\r\ntriple hills on which it is enthroned, its magnificent bay and harbor,\r\nand the group of islands and islets that sparkle like emeralds on their\r\nsurface; not merely this most admirable common, which opens before our\r\nwindows, delightful even at this season of the year, and affording us in\r\nsummer, in its noble malls and shady walks, all that the country can\r\nboast of cool and beautiful and salubrious, transported to the heart of\r\nthe city, \"the poor man's pleasure-ground,\" as it has been well called,\r\nthough a king might envy it;--nor the environs of our city of surpassing\r\nloveliness, which enclose it on every side in kindly embrace; it is not\r\nsolely nor principally these natural attractions which endear Boston to\r\nits citizens. Nor is it exclusively the proud and grateful memories of\r\nthe past,--of the high-souled fathers and mothers of the land, venerable\r\nin their self-denying virtues, majestic in the austere simplicity of\r\ntheir manners, conscientious in their errors, who, with amazing\r\nsacrifices and hardships never to be described, sought out new homes in\r\nthe wilderness, and transmitted to us delights and blessings which it\r\nwas not given to themselves to enjoy;--of those who in succeeding\r\ngenerations deserved well of their country,--the pioneers of the\r\nRevolution, the men of the stamp act age, whose own words and acts are\r\nstamped on the pages of history, in characters never to be effaced;--of\r\nthose who, when the decisive hour came, stood forth in that immortal\r\nHALL, the champions of their country's rights, while it scarcely yet\r\ndeserved the name of a country; it is not exclusively these proud and\r\ngrateful associations, which attach the dutiful Bostonian to the city of\r\nhis birth or adoption.\r\n\r\nNo, Mr. Mayor, it is not exclusively these, much as they contribute to\r\nstrengthen the sentiment. It has its origin, in no small degree, in the\r\npersonal relation in which Boston places herself to her children; in the\r\nparental interest which she cherishes in their welfare, which leads her\r\nto take them by the hand almost from the cradle,--to train them up in\r\nthe ascending series of her excellent free schools; watching over them\r\nas a fond father watches over the objects of his love and hope; in a\r\nword, to confer upon them a first-rate school education at the public\r\nexpense. Often have I attempted, but with very partial success, both in\r\nthis country and in Europe, to persuade inquiring friends from the\r\ncountries and places where no such well-organized system of public\r\neducation prevails, that our free schools do really afford to the entire\r\npopulation means of elementary education, of which the wealthiest\r\ncitizen is glad to avail himself.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. Mayor, the enlightened counsels of the city government are\r\nabout to give new strength to those ties of gratitude and affection,\r\nwhich bind the hearts of the children of Boston to their beloved city.\r\nHitherto the system of public education, excellent as it is and wisely\r\nsupported by a princely expenditure, does but commence the work of\r\ninstruction and carry it to a certain point; well advanced, indeed, but\r\nfar short of the goal. It prepares our young men for college, for the\r\ncounting-room, for the office of the engineer, the _studio_ of the\r\nartist, the shop of the artisan, the laboratory of the chemist, or\r\nwhatever field of employment they may be destined to enter, but there it\r\nleaves them, without further provision for the culture of the mind. It\r\ndisciplines the faculties and forms a taste for the acquisition of\r\nknowledge, on the part of our young men and women, but it provides no\r\nmeans for their exercise and gratification. It gives them the elementary\r\neducation requisite for their future callings, but withholds all\r\nfacilities of access to those boundless stores of recorded knowledge, in\r\nevery department, by which alone that elementary education can be\r\ncompleted and made effectual for the active duties of life.\r\n\r\nBut to-day our honored city carries on and perfects her work. The\r\ntrustees, from their first annual report to the present time, have never\r\nfailed to recommend a first class public library, such as that, sir, for\r\nwhose accommodation you destine this noble building, as the completion\r\nof the great system of public education. Its object is to give to the\r\nentire population, not merely to the curious student, but to the\r\ninquisitive member of either of the professions, to the intelligent\r\nmerchant, mechanic, machinist, engineer, artist or artisan, in short, to\r\nall of every age and of either sex, who desire to investigate any\r\nsubject, either of utility or taste, those advantages which, without\r\nsuch an ample public collection, must necessarily be monopolized by the\r\nproprietors of large private libraries, or those who by courtesy have\r\nthe use of them; nay, to put within the reach of the entire community\r\nadvantages of this kind, far beyond those which can be afforded by the\r\nlargest and best provided private libraries.\r\n\r\nThe trustees are anxious that the institution, whose prosperity they\r\nhave so much at heart, should continue to be viewed in this light; as\r\none more added to the school-houses of the city, at which Boston boys\r\nand girls, when they have outgrown the other schools, will come to carry\r\non the education which has been there commenced; where Boston men and\r\nwomen, \"children of a larger growth,\" may come to acquire that\r\nadditional knowledge which is requisite for the most successful\r\ndischarge of the duties of the various callings of society,--which\r\nopens, in its pursuit, the purest sources of happiness,--and which,\r\nwithout reference to utility, contributes so materially to the grace and\r\nornament of life.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there is still floating about in the community a vague\r\nprejudice against what is called book-learning. One sometimes hears\r\ndoubts expressed of the utility of public libraries; opinions that\r\nthey are rather ornamental than necessary or useful; and the fact that\r\nour time-honored city, never indifferent to the mental improvement of\r\nher children, has existed more than two centuries without one, is a\r\nsufficient proof, that, until within a very few years, their\r\nimportance has not been practically felt. There is perhaps even now a\r\ndisposition to claim some superiority for what is called practical\r\nknowledge--knowledge gained by observation and experience (which most\r\ncertainly the trustees would not disparage), and a kind of\r\nsatisfaction felt in holding up the example of self-taught men, in\r\nsupposed contradistinction from those who have got their knowledge\r\nfrom books. No name perhaps is so frequently mentioned for this\r\npurpose as that of Franklin, who, because he had scarce any school\r\neducation and never went to college, has been hastily set down as a\r\nbrilliant example to show the inutility of book-learning. It has been\r\nquoted to me in this way, and to show that libraries are of no use,\r\nwithin three days.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Mayor, I need not tell you that there never was a greater\r\nmistake in point of fact. A thirst for books, which he spared no pains\r\nto allay, is the first marked trait disclosed in the character of\r\nFranklin; his success throughout the early period of his life can be\r\ndirectly traced to the use he made of them; and his very first important\r\nmovement for the benefit of his fellow-men was to found a public\r\nlibrary, which still flourishes;--one of the most considerable in the\r\ncountry. Franklin not a book-man! whoever labors under that delusion,\r\nshows that somebody else is not a book-man, at least so far as concerns\r\nthe biography of our illustrious townsman. We happen to have a little\r\ninformation on that subject, in a book written by Franklin himself. He\r\nthere gives a very different account of himself, and I would ask any one\r\nwho entertains the idea to which I am alluding, at what period of\r\nFranklin's career he supposes this taste for books began to be\r\nmanifested by him; how soon he ceased to be a self-formed man? Perhaps\r\nafter he had struggled through the years of his youthful poverty,\r\nescaped to Philadelphia, set up in business as a printer, and begun to\r\nhave a little money in his pocket. I need not tell you, sir, that it was\r\nearlier than that. Was it, then, while he was the clever apprentice to\r\nhis brother, the editor of a journal, and wrote articles for its columns\r\nin a disguised hand, and tucked them under the office door, enjoying the\r\nexquisite delight of being ordered to set up his own anonymous articles;\r\nwas it then, at the age of fifteen or sixteen, that this fondness for\r\nreading, under the stimulus of boyish authorship, disclosed itself?\r\nEarlier than that. Well, then, at the grammar-school and Master\r\nBrownwell's writing-school, which he attended from eight to ten (for\r\nthere are boys who show a fondness for reading, even at that tender\r\nage); was little Benjamin's taste for books developed while yet at\r\nschool? Earlier than that. Hear his own words, which you will permit me\r\nto read from that exquisite piece of autobiography to which I have\r\nalready alluded: \"From my INFANCY I was _passionately_ fond of reading,\r\nand all the money that came into my hands was laid out in purchasing\r\nbooks. I was very fond of voyages. My first acquisition was Bunyan's\r\nworks, in separate little volumes. I afterwards sold them to enable me\r\nto buy R. Burton's _Historical Collections_. They were small chapman's\r\nbooks and cheap, forty volumes in all. My father's little library\r\nconsisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read. I\r\nhave often regretted [and this is a sentence that might be inscribed on\r\nthe lofty cornice of this noble hall] that at a time when I had such a\r\nthirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way....\r\nThere was among them Plutarch's Lives, which I read abundantly, and I\r\nstill think that time spent to great advantage. There was also a book of\r\nDefoe's, called an _Essay on Projects_, and another of Dr. Mather's,\r\ncalled an _Essay to do Good_, which\"--did what, sir? For I am now going\r\nto give you, in Franklin's own words (they carry with them the\r\njustification of every dollar expended in raising these walls), the\r\noriginal secret of his illustrious career--what was the effect produced\r\nby reading these two little books of Defoe and Cotton Mather? \"they\r\nperhaps gave me a turn of thinking, which had an influence on some of\r\nthe principal future events of my life.\" Yes, sir, in the reading of\r\nthose books was the acorn that sprouted into that magnificent oak; there\r\nwas the fountain-drop which a fairy might have sipped from a buttercup,\r\nfrom which has flowed the Missouri and the Mississippi,--the broad, deep\r\nriver of Franklin's fame, winding its way through the lapse of ages, and\r\ndestined to flow on, till it shall be ingulfed in the ocean of eternity.\r\n\r\nFrom his \"infancy,\" sir, \"passionately fond of reading,\" nay, with the\r\nappetite of a vulture, with the digestion of an ostrich, attacking the\r\ngreat folios of polemic divinity in his father's library. Not a dull\r\nboy, either; not a precocious little bookworm; fond of play; doesn't\r\ndislike a little mischief; sometimes, as he tells us, \"led the other\r\nboys into scrapes;\" but in his intervals of play, in his leisure\r\nmoments, up in the lonely garret when the rest of the family were\r\nasleep, holding converse in his childhood with the grave old\r\nnon-conformists, Howe and Owen and Flavel and Baxter,--communing with\r\nthe austerest lords of thought; the demigods of puritanism.\r\n\r\nFranklin not a book-man? Why, he goes on to tell us that it was \"this\r\nbookish inclination which at length determined his father to make him a\r\nprinter,\" against his own inclination, which was for the sea; and when\r\nhe had thus by constraint become a printer, his great consolation was,\r\nas he says, that \"I now had access to better books. An acquaintance with\r\nthe apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small\r\none, which I was careful to return soon and clean. Often I sat up in my\r\nchamber reading the greatest part of the night, when the book was\r\nborrowed in the evening and was to be returned in the morning, lest it\r\nshould be found missing.\"\r\n\r\nThen he made the acquaintance of Mr. Matthew Adams, an ingenious,\r\nsensible man, \"who had a pretty collection of books.\" He frequented the\r\nprinting-office, took notice of the bright little apprentice, and \"very\r\nkindly proposed to lend me such books as I chose to read.\" Having taken\r\nto a vegetable diet at the age of sixteen, he persuaded his brother to\r\nallow him in cash half the price of his board,--lived upon potatoes and\r\nhasty pudding,--soon found that he could save half even of that little\r\nallowance (which could not have exceeded two-and-six-pence a week,\r\nlawful money), and this poor little economy \"was an additional fund for\r\nbuying books.\" What would the poor, underfed boy, who was glad to buy\r\nbooks on the savings of his potato diet, have said could he have had\r\nfree access to a hall like this, stored as it soon will be with its\r\npriceless treasures?\r\n\r\nFurther, sir, while working as a journeyman in England, he says, \"I\r\nmade the acquaintance of one William Wilcox, a bookseller, whose shop\r\nwas next door. He had an immense collection of second-hand\r\nbooks.\"--(Somewhat, I suppose, like our friend Burnham, in\r\nCornhill.)--\"Circulating libraries were not then in use, but we agreed\r\nthat on certain reasonable terms, which I have now forgotten, I might\r\ntake, read, and return any of his works. This I esteemed a great\r\nadvantage, and I made as much use of it as I could.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, sir, as I have already said, Franklin's first important\r\nmovement for the good of his fellow-men was the foundation of the public\r\nlibrary in Philadelphia. At his instance, the members of a little club\r\nto which he belonged, tradesmen and mechanics of narrow means, threw\r\ninto common stock the few books which belonged to them. A subscription\r\nwas then obtained from fifty young men, principally tradesmen, of two\r\npounds each, and ten shillings _per annum_, and with this little fund\r\nthey began. \"The books were imported, the library was opened one day in\r\nthe week for lending them to the subscribers, on their promissory notes\r\nto pay double the value if not duly returned.\" \"This was the mother,\"\r\nsays Franklin, \"of all the North American subscription libraries, now so\r\nnumerous. It has become a great thing itself, and continually goes on\r\nincreasing. These libraries have improved the general conversation of\r\nthe Americans, made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as\r\nmost gentlemen from other countries, and, perhaps, have contributed in\r\nsome degree to the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in\r\ndefence of their privileges.\"\r\n\r\nThose are the words of Franklin, Mr. Mayor, which I read from his own\r\nbook. Our excellent friend the President of the Commissioners (Hon. R.C.\r\nWinthrop) has justly felicitated himself on having been the first person\r\npublicly to raise his voice in this noble hall. He must be a happier man\r\nthan I who can speak an earlier or an abler word than his on any\r\noccasion; but I claim the credit of having read from the first book\r\nopened in this hall;--and what is more, sir, I mean to have the\r\nsatisfaction of presenting the first volume given to the library, since\r\nthis building came into the care of the Trustees. In your presence, Mr.\r\nMayor, and that of this vast assembly on this first of January, 1858, I\r\noffer this copy of Franklin's Autobiography in Sparks's edition, as a\r\nNew Year's gift to the Boston Public Library. Nay, sir, I am going to do\r\nmore, and make the first, and perhaps the last, motion ever made in this\r\nhall; and that is, that every person present, of his own accord, if of\r\nage,--with the consent of parent or guardian, if a minor,--man, woman,\r\nboy, or girl, be requested, on going home, to select one good book, and\r\nin memory of the poor boy, who half-fed himself to gratify his taste for\r\nreading, present it as a New-Year's gift to the Boston Public Library. I\r\nmake you that motion, Mr. Mayor, and I call upon all present to give me\r\ntheir voices: especially I ask the cooperation of the fairer and better\r\npart of creation. If nowhere else, woman's rights shall be respected in\r\nthis hall, while I have anything to do with it. I pray you, Mr. Mayor,\r\nput the question, and then I'll finish my speech.\r\n\r\n    His Honor the Mayor then rose and stated the question, which\r\n    was seconded by Mr. Winthrop. The mayor particularly called\r\n    on the ladies to vote, and a unanimous and emphatic aye\r\n    resounded through the vast hall. The negative was then\r\n    called and no response made. His Honor, amidst great\r\n    cheering and laughter, pronounced it a unanimous vote. Mr.\r\n    Everett  resumed--\r\n\r\nNo, sir, if there is one lesson more than another directly deducible\r\nfrom the life of Franklin, it is the close connection of a thoroughly\r\npractical and useful life and career with books, libraries, and reading.\r\nIf there is a thing on earth which would have gladdened his heart could\r\nhe have anticipated it, it would be the knowledge that his native city,\r\nin two generations after his death, would found a library like this, to\r\ngive to the rising generation and to the lovers of knowledge of every\r\nage that access to books, of which he so much felt the want. And could\r\nit be granted to him, even now, to return to his native city, which\r\ndwelt in his affections to the close of his life, his first visit would\r\nbe to the centre of the ancient burial-ground, where in after-life he\r\ndutifully placed a marble slab on the graves of his parents; his second\r\nvisit would be to the spot in Milk street where he was born; his third\r\nto the corner of Union street and Hanover street, where he passed his\r\nchildhood, in a house still standing; his fourth visit would be to the\r\nsite of the free grammar school-house, where, as he says in his will, he\r\nreceived \"his first instruction in literature,\" and which is now adorned\r\nwith a statue which a grateful posterity has dedicated to his memory;\r\nand his last and longest would be to this noble hall, where you are\r\nmaking provision for an ample supply of that reading of which, \"from his\r\n_infancy_ he was _passionately_ fond.\" The trustees have done what they\r\ncould to connect some reference to Franklin with an institution which\r\nwould have been the object of his warmest affections, by providing that\r\nevery Franklin medal boy shall be entitled to its privileges; and\r\ninasmuch as the accumulating fund which he bequeathed to the city, and\r\nwhich now exceeds seventy thousand dollars, has proved almost wholly\r\nunavailing for the primary object of the bequest, it deserves\r\nconsideration whether, when it has reached a sufficient magnitude, as it\r\nwill before the end of this century, the interest of the fund, if it can\r\nbe legally done, might not advantageously be appropriated, as a\r\npermanent endowment for the support of the library.\r\n\r\nI have not proposed at this time, sir, on the part of the trustees, to\r\nmake a formal speech; I have preferred to let Benjamin Franklin speak\r\nfor us. This day belongs of right to the commissioners for building the\r\nlibrary, ably represented as they are, by our distinguished friend their\r\npresident, who has done such ample justice to the subject; and to you,\r\nMr. Mayor, as the organ of the city government, whom I cannot but\r\ncongratulate on closing your official career,--in all respects so\r\nhonorable to yourself and so acceptable to your fellow-citizens,--by an\r\nact, I am sure, most grateful to your own feelings and most auspicious\r\nof the public good. It is not yet the time for the trustees to speak. A\r\nmore fitting opportunity may hereafter present itself, when the books\r\nshall be placed on the shelves, the catalogue printed, and the library\r\nopened for public use. Occasion may then, perhaps, with propriety be\r\ntaken, to illustrate the importance and utility of such an institution;\r\nto do justice to the liberality on the part of the city government and\r\nthe individual benefactors by which it has been founded, endowed, and\r\nsustained; and especially to the generosity of our greatest benefactor\r\nand esteemed fellow-countryman, Mr. Bates, whose letters announcing his\r\nfirst munificent donation of fifty thousand dollars, alluding to his own\r\nearly want of access to books, assign that as the moving cause which\r\nprompted his liberality. It will be the pleasing duty of those who may\r\nthen be intrusted with the administration of the library, to pay a\r\nfitting tribute to so much public and private bounty.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, sir, we must throw ourselves on the patience and\r\nconsiderateness of the city council and the community. Not much short of\r\nsixty thousand volumes are to be brought together from four different\r\nplaces of temporary deposit, and assigned to their final resting-places\r\nin this hall and the circulating library below. Here they are to be\r\narranged on the shelves, the cards and slips which pertain to them, far\r\nmore numerous than the volumes themselves, reduced to alphabetical\r\norder; a separate catalogue of each alcove prepared; and a comprehensive\r\ncatalogue of the whole collection, without which it will be little\r\nbetter than an unmanageable mass, prepared and printed. Every thing\r\nwhich could be done beforehand, has been anticipated; but much of the\r\nwork was of necessity reserved till the books should be placed on the\r\nshelves. In the interval, and while this labor is going on, the library\r\nin Mason street will be left in possession of the books most in request\r\nfor daily circulation, and will be closed at last only when it becomes\r\nabsolutely necessary that they also should be removed to the new\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nBut it is time for me to conclude. The shades of evening are falling\r\naround us; those cressets which lend us their mild and tasteful\r\nillumination will soon be extinguished; and the first day of the\r\nNew-Year, rich in the happy prospects we now inaugurate, will come to a\r\nclose. May the blessing of Heaven give effect to its brightest\r\nanticipations. A few more days,--a few more years,--will follow their\r\nappointed round, and we, who now exchange our congratulations on this\r\nmagnificent New-Year's gift of our city fathers, shall have passed from\r\nthe scene; but firm in the faith that the growth of knowledge is the\r\ngrowth of sound principles and pure morals, let us not doubt, that, by\r\nthe liberality of the city government and of our generous benefactors at\r\nhome and abroad, a light will be kindled and go forth from these walls,\r\nnow dedicated to the use of the FREE BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY, which will\r\nguide our children and our children's children in the path of\r\nintelligence and virtue, till the sun himself shall fall from the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK FREE CIRCULATING LIBRARY\r\n\r\nADDRESS IN ITS FAVOR AT A PUBLIC MEETING\r\n\r\n    President Cleveland made this address on March 6, 1890,\r\n    while a resident of New York City in the interval between\r\n    his two presidential terms, at a meeting, at Chickering\r\n    Hall, called for the purpose of directing attention to the\r\n    work of the struggling Free Circulating Library and if\r\n    possible to raise funds for its support, which was only\r\n    partially insured by the City. Owing to increase in both\r\n    public and private contributions this library was enabled to\r\n    make rapid growth in the years immediately following until\r\n    in 1901, when it was merged in the Circulation Department of\r\n    the New York Public Library, it was operating eleven\r\n    branches with a circulation of over 600,000. This\r\n    institution was the pioneer of the popular, as distinguished\r\n    from the scholarly, library idea in New York.\r\n\r\n    [Stephen] Grover Cleveland was born in Caldwell, N.J.,\r\n    March 18, 1837, the fifth son of a Presbyterian clergyman.\r\n    He received a common-school education and after his father's\r\n    death went in 1855 to live with an uncle in Buffalo, N.Y. He\r\n    was admitted to the bar there in 1859, was assistant\r\n    district attorney in 1863-66, sheriff in 1871-74 and mayor\r\n    in 1882. In the latter year he was elected Governor of New\r\n    York and in 1884 President of the United States. He was an\r\n    unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1888, but was\r\n    elected again in 1892. He died in Princeton, N.J., where he\r\n    had resided since his last presidential term, on June 24,\r\n    1908.\r\n\r\nThe words I shall speak on this occasion I intend rather as a pledge of\r\nmy adherance to the cause in which you are enlisted than an attempt to\r\nsay anything new or instructive. I gladly join with the enthusiasm of a\r\nnew convert in the felicitations of those who have done noble and\r\neffective work in the establishment and maintenance in our city of a\r\nfree circulating library, and it seems to me they have abundant cause\r\nfor congratulation in review of the good which has already been\r\naccomplished through their efforts and in the contemplation of the\r\nfurther usefulness which awaits their continued endeavor.\r\n\r\nIn every enlightened country the value of popular education is fully\r\nrecognized, not only as a direct benefit to its recipients, but as an\r\nelement of strength and safety in organized society. Considered in these\r\naspects it should nowhere be better appreciated than in this land of\r\nfree institutions consecrated to the welfare and happiness of its\r\ncitizens, and deriving its sanction and its power from the people. Here\r\nthe character of the people is inevitably impressed upon the government,\r\nand here our public life can no more be higher and purer than the life\r\nof the people, than a stream can rise above its fountain or be purer\r\nthan the spring in which it has its source.\r\n\r\nThat we have not failed to realize these conditions is demonstrated by\r\nthe establishment of free public schools on every side, where children\r\nare not only invited but often obliged to submit themselves to such\r\ninstruction as will better their situation in life and fit them to take\r\npart intelligently in the conduct of the government.\r\n\r\nThus, in our schools the young are taught to read, and in this manner\r\nthe seed is sown, from which we expect a profitable return to the state,\r\nwhen its beneficiaries shall repay the educational advances made to them\r\nby an intelligent and patriotic performance of their social and\r\npolitical duties.\r\n\r\nAnd yet if we are to create good citizenship, which is the object of\r\npopular education, and if we are to insure to the country the full\r\nbenefit of public instruction, we can by no means consider the work as\r\ncompletely done in the schoolroom. While the young gathered there are\r\nfitting themselves to assume in the future their political obligations,\r\nthere are others upon whom these obligations already rest, and who now\r\nhave the welfare and safety of the country in their keeping. Our work is\r\nbadly done if these are neglected. They have passed the school age, and\r\nhave perhaps availed themselves of free instruction; but they, as well\r\nas those still in the school, should, nevertheless, have within their\r\nreach the means of further mental improvement and the opportunity of\r\ngaining that additional knowledge and information which can only be\r\nsecured by access to useful and instructive books.\r\n\r\nThe husbandman who expects to gain a profitable return from his\r\norchards, not only carefully tends and cultivates the young trees in his\r\nnurseries as they grow to maturity but he generously enriches and cares\r\nfor those in bearing and upon which he must rely for ripened fruit.\r\n\r\nTeaching the children of our land to read is but the first step in the\r\nscheme of creating good citizens by means of free instruction. We teach\r\nthe young to read so that both as children and as men and women they may\r\nread. Our teaching must lead to the habit and the desire of reading to\r\nbe useful; and only as this result is reached can the work in our free\r\nschools be logically supplemented and made valuable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the same wise policy and intent which open the doors of our\r\nfree schools to our young, also suggest the completion of the plan thus\r\nentered upon by placing books in the hands of those who in our schools\r\nhave been taught to read.\r\n\r\nA man or woman who never reads and is abandoned to unthinking torpor, or\r\nwho allows the entire mental life to be bounded by the narrow lines of\r\nthe daily recurring routine of effort for mere existence, cannot escape\r\na condition of barrenness of mind, which not only causes the decay of\r\nindividual contentment and happiness, but which fails to yield to the\r\nstate its justly expected return of usefulness in valuable service and\r\nwholesome political action.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of this question should not be overlooked. It is not\r\nonly of great importance that our youth and our men and women should\r\nhave the ability, the desire, and the opportunity to read, but the kind\r\nof books they read is no less important. Without guidance and without\r\nthe invitation and encouragement to read publications which will improve\r\nas well as interest, there is danger that our people will have in their\r\nhands books whose influence and tendency are of a negative sort, if not\r\npositively bad and mischievous. Like other good things, the ability and\r\nopportunity to read may be so used as to defeat their beneficient\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe boy who greedily devours the vicious tales of imaginary daring and\r\nblood-curdling adventure which in these days are far too accessible to\r\nthe young will have his brain filled with notions of life and standards\r\nof manliness which, if they do not make him a menace to peace and good\r\norder, will certainly not tend to make him a useful member of society.\r\n\r\nThe man who devotes himself to the flash literature now much too common\r\nwill, instead of increasing his value as a citizen, almost surely\r\ndegenerate in his ideas of public duty and grow dull in appreciation of\r\nthe obligations he owes his country.\r\n\r\nIn both these cases there will be a loss to the state. There is danger\r\nalso that a positive and aggressive injury to the community will result,\r\nand such readers will certainly suffer deprivation to the happiness and\r\ncontentment which are the fruits of improving study and well-regulated\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the young woman who seeks recreation and entertainment in\r\nreading silly and frivolous books, often of doubtful moral tendency, is\r\nherself in the way of becoming frivolous and silly, if not of weak\r\nmorality. If she escapes this latter condition, she is certain to become\r\nutterly unfitted to bear patiently the burden of self-support or to\r\nassume the sacred duties of wife and mother.\r\n\r\nContemplating these truths, no one can doubt the importance of securing\r\nfor those who read, as far as it is in our power, facilities for the\r\nstudy and reading of such books as will instruct and innocently\r\nentertain, and which will at the same time improve and correct the\r\ntastes and habits.\r\n\r\nThere is another thought somewhat in advance of those already suggested,\r\nwhich should not pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\nAs an outgrowth of the inventive and progressive spirit of our people,\r\nwe have among us legions of men, and women, too, who restlessly desire\r\nto increase their knowledge of the new forces and agencies which at this\r\ntime are being constantly dragged from their lurking-places and\r\nsubjected to the use of man. Those earnest inquirers should all be given\r\na chance and have put within their reach such books as will guide and\r\ninspire their efforts. If by this means the country shall gain to itself\r\na new inventor or be the patron of endeavor which shall add new elements\r\nto the sum of human happiness and comfort, its intervention will be well\r\nrepaid.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, and the fact that many among us having the ability\r\nand inclination to read are unable to furnish themselves with profitable\r\nand wholesome books amply justify the beneficient mission of our Free\r\nCirculating Library. Its plan and operation, so exactly adjusted to meet\r\na situation which cannot safely be ignored and to wants which ought not\r\nto be neglected, establish its claim upon the encouragement and\r\nreasonable aid of the public authorities and commend it most fully to\r\nthe support and generosity of private benefaction.\r\n\r\nThe development which this good work has already reached in our city has\r\nexhibited the broad field yet remaining untouched and the inadequacy of\r\npresent operations. It has brought to view also instances of noble\r\nindividual philanthropy and disinterested private effort and\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\nBut it certainly seems that the time and money directed towards this\r\nobject are confined to a circle of persons far too narrow, and that the\r\npublic encouragement and aid have been greatly disproportioned to\r\nprivate endeavor.\r\n\r\nThe city of New York has never shown herself willing to be behind other\r\ncities in such work as is done by our Free Circulating Library, and\r\nwhile her people are much engrossed in business activity and enterprise\r\nthey have never yet turned away from a cause once demonstrated to them\r\nto be so worthy and useful as this.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration is at hand. Let it be pressed upon our fellow\r\ncitizens, and let them be shown the practical operation of the project\r\nyou have in hand and the good it has accomplished, and the further good\r\nof which it is capable through their increased liberality, and it will\r\nbe strange if they fail to respond generously to your appeal to put the\r\ncity of New York in the front rank of the cities which have recognized\r\nthe usefulness of the free circulating libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WADSWORTH ATHENAEUM\r\n\r\nADDRESSES AT THE OPENING OF ITS LIBRARY IN HARTFORD, CONN., JAN. 2,\r\n1893.\r\n\r\n    These addresses, by Charles Dudley Warner and Charles H.\r\n    Clark, are reprinted from brief abstracts given in _The\r\n    Library Journal_ of January, 1893.\r\n\r\n    Charles Dudley Warner was born in Plainfield, Mass., Sept.\r\n    12, 1829 and graduated at Hamilton College in 1851. He\r\n    practised law in Chicago in 1856-60 and in 1861 became\r\n    managing editor of the Hartford, Conn., _Press_. In 1867 on\r\n    its consolidation with the _Courant_, he became co-editor.\r\n    He was made associate editor of _Harper's Magazine_ in 1884,\r\n    and died at Hartford, Oct. 20, 1900. He was widely popular\r\n    as an essayist, first gaining favorable notice by his \"My\r\n    Summer in a Garden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis building and its contents are contributory to the excellence and\r\nenjoyment of life exactly as Bushnall Park is--not merely that it is a\r\nplace of rest and recreation, but it is a training in beauty, in the\r\nappreciation of nobleness, and in the public and private refinement.\r\nCulture is a plant of rather slow growth. I suppose there never was such\r\na change wrought, almost instantaneously, in a people as was wrought in\r\nthe American people by the opening and exhibition of the Philadelphia\r\nCentennial of 1876. Its effect was at once apparent everywhere. But\r\nknowledge precedes culture, culture being, after all, but another name\r\nfor educational taste.\r\n\r\nNow this institution is simply a means for the culture of the city of\r\nHartford, in all ways, because literature and art--not taken externally,\r\nbut absorbed as a part of our lives, not only of knowledge, but of\r\nexperience--are the things that make life worth living.\r\n\r\nNo one can speak too highly of the offices of a great library. It was\r\none of our great essayists, you remember, who said that the\r\nmonastery--speaking of it with reference to its books--was the ark that\r\nfloated down over the tempest and darkness of the middle ages, in order\r\nto carry classic learning to the fifteenth century. They were\r\nrepositories of learning. That is the old idea. And for a long\r\ntime--almost to our day--that was the notion of the library. It was a\r\nplace to put something away. It was not even like a market for the sale\r\nof provisions or eggs; indeed, if they were eggs the librarians thought\r\nit their duty to sit on them, with the idea that they might hatch out\r\nother books. That was a noble thing to do. But much better than that is\r\nto scatter these books abroad among the people, so that we shall not\r\nhave reproduction--an egg for an egg--but that these books will so\r\nrevivify the life that we shall have books new, that express the actual\r\nconditions and that appeal to the human life as it is. This is the\r\nmodern idea of the library. This great collection, which is not to be\r\nsecluded, is to be carried and even forced upon the people, so that it\r\nshall enter into and become a part of their daily lives.\r\n\r\nYou remember, perhaps, what Milton says about the books, in that\r\nnoblest of noble defences of unlicensed printing, that \"they are not\r\ndead things. As good almost,\" he says, \"kill a man as you kill a good\r\nbook. Who kills a man, kills a reasonable being, made in God's image.\r\nWho destroys a good book destroys reason itself, kills the image of God\r\nas it were, in the eye. Many a man,\" he goes on to say, \"lives a burden\r\nto the earth, but a good book is the precious life blood of a master\r\nspirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life; so\r\nthat if we slay a good book we would slay immortality rather than a\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n    Charles Hopkins Clark, who immediately followed Mr. Warner,\r\n    was at this time editor in chief of _The Hartford Courant_,\r\n    of which Mr. Warner was co-editor. Mr. Clark was born in\r\n    Hartford April 1, 1848, graduated at Yale, and joined the\r\n    _Courant_ staff in 1871, becoming editor in 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest sins of my youth, or rather one of the earliest that\r\nis burnt into my memory, was committed in the library of what was then\r\nthe Young Men's Institute. I spoke out loud! The rebuke that I received\r\nsent me down the stairs overwhelmed with a sense of the enormity of my\r\ncrime, yet more than sustained by joy to think that I had escaped the\r\nutter annihilation with which my reprimand was freighted. And I can say\r\nthat the awe with which I used to enter that chamber of silence, and the\r\nfear with which I regarded the librarian were the common property of all\r\nthe young people of that somewhat remote period. But long since we found\r\nout that the old librarian was one of the gentlest and most inoffensive\r\nmen, and that we had misunderstood him as completely as he had\r\nmisunderstood us.\r\n\r\nBut I have no such gloomy recollection, nor to be honest, have I any\r\nrecollection at all of the Wadsworth Athenaeum gallery, because, like\r\neverybody else who then lived in Hartford, I never went in there. The\r\ndoor was often open and the only sentinel on guard had no more\r\nformidable weapon than a pair of knitting-needles. But no one ever\r\ncrossed that threshold. The simple legend, traced on a placard at the\r\ndoor, \"Admission Ten Cents,\" did the business, or rather, to be more\r\nelegant as well as accurate, prevented any business being done. The\r\npeople who came up the stone steps read the notice and turned off to the\r\nleft to the library or to the right to the Historical Society, where\r\nentrance was free. I say free, but freedom must have its limits if we\r\nare to have safety, so the tin sign on the outside of the door gave\r\nnotice to the always unwelcome boy that he could not go in until he\r\nreached the mature age of twelve years. That was one of the things that\r\nI wanted to grow to full manhood for.\r\n\r\nAnd I well remember my first visit there. As I walked slowly up the\r\nstairs I wondered what venerable monument of patriotic achievement, what\r\nnew inspiration to love for our noble State whose history is such a\r\npriceless treasure, what vision of heroic self-sacrifice in her behalf\r\nwould first burst upon my eager eyes when I should look around the hall.\r\nI looked and lo! there in a glass jar stood the chaste but familiar\r\nfigure of Charles Hosmer's night-blooming cereus--the modest pioneer of\r\nthe canned-fruit industry in this community.\r\n\r\nI have made this brief review in order to suggest to you the state of\r\ninnocuous desuetude in which for more or less time the various miscalled\r\ninterests in this building had been lying for lack of any interest at\r\nall. The library had a limited and dwindling clientage. The Athenaeum\r\nwas deserted. The Historical Society, with no funds and few friends, was\r\nexhibiting a collection of animal, vegetable, and mineral curiosities,\r\nwhile its real treasures of history and truth were by lock and key shut\r\noff from the very public for whom they were collected and preserved.\r\nLook at that picture, then look at this which greets us here to day.\r\n\r\nIn these elegant and spacious buildings the whole public of Hartford is\r\nwelcome, without money and without price. The circulating library will\r\nfurnish every home with books, and Miss Hewins, who has devoted her life\r\nto this town, is always ready to help the younger readers. The Library\r\nof Reference, monument alike to Mr. Watkinson's liberality and Dr.\r\nTrumbull's rare judgment and life-long devoted service as a librarian,\r\noffers free to all students the authorities on every branch of\r\nknowledge. The Historical Society, with improved facilities, has been\r\nable to adopt a more liberal policy, and is widening its claim upon\r\npublic interest, and so increasing its usefulness, and, thanks largely\r\nto the women of Hartford, the Art Gallery and Art School are ready to\r\nspread their refining and wholesome influence all through this\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARIES AS LEAVEN\r\n\r\n    This address was delivered at the inauguration of the Free\r\n    Public Library, Madison, Wis., by Prof. James D. Butler.\r\n\r\n    James Davie Butler was born in Rutland, Vt., March 15, 1815,\r\n    and was graduated at Middlebury College, Vt., in 1836. He\r\n    entered the Congregational ministry, and held the chairs of\r\n    ancient languages in Wabash College, 1854-58 and the\r\n    University of Wisconsin, 1858-67, after which he devoted\r\n    himself to lecturing and writing until his death in Madison\r\n    in 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy subject is \"Libraries as Leaven,\" or the relation of libraries to the\r\nincreased diffusion of knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat is a Library? It is the knowledge of all brought within the reach\r\nof each one. It is an expanded encyclopaedia, or the books which are, or\r\nought to be, consulted in compiling a perfect encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\nHuman knowledge--and hence the books in which it is treasured up--is\r\ndivided by some authors into forty departments. I have their names here\r\nall written down--but I dare not read them. You would give no more\r\nquarter to such a catalogue than the lover gave to the mercantile\r\ninventory of his sweetheart's charms, when itemized as \"two lips\r\nindifferent red,\" \"two gray eyes with lids to them,\" and so on.\r\n\r\nBut all these forty classes of knowledge ought to be represented in a\r\nlibrary, and the more largely the better. They should also mingle there\r\nin due proportion, \"parts into parts reciprocally shot, and all so\r\nforming a harmonious whole.\" \"If the whole body were an eye, where were\r\nthe hearing?\"\r\n\r\nI once lived in a town of a thousand families, where, through a legacy,\r\none copy of some single author was annually presented to each family.\r\nBut, with the same money, a thousand different works might have been\r\nevery year purchased, and all kept accessible by all the families. The\r\nresult would have been a feast as appetizing to all palates as the\r\nmiraculous manna which the rabbins tell us tasted to each Jew like that\r\nparticular dainty which he loved best.\r\n\r\nIt is no objection to a library that no man will ever read it through.\r\nNo man will read through his dictionary, and time is not long enough for\r\na man to read all the words in the daily _Tribune_. Nor will any\r\ncustomer exhaust a store. Yet he demands an assortment from which to\r\nselect the little that he needs. In every library most authors, bound up\r\nin congenial calf, sleep soundly in their own sheets. Yet the dust of\r\ndead men's bones, at the touch of genius, comes forth in a new life. How\r\nmuch that is best in Macaulay and in Buckle is extracted from\r\nbibliothecal rubbish--or reading which had never been read. Hence even\r\nSamson could not say to the jaw-bone of an ass: \"I have no need of you.\"\r\nThe wise thank God for fools. They get their living out of them, and\r\nmostly out of the greatest fools. In truth, no library is large enough.\r\nGuizot and Michelet complain of inability to consult certain books, even\r\nin that Parisian library, where books are as plenty as water in the\r\ndeluge, and the shelves would reach from here to Milwaukee.\r\n\r\nA library should be a cosmos; but it is a chaos till arrangement,\r\ncatalogues and librarians bring us at once the volume we desire, and\r\nwhich, without them, would be as hard to fish up as the Atlantic cable\r\nlost in mid-ocean.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus warlike arms in magazines we place,\r\n    All ranged in order and disposed with grace:\r\n    Not thus alone the curious eye to please,\r\n    But to be _found_, when need requires, with ease.\"\r\n\r\nIn some libraries, however, books are arranged on a system which seems\r\nborrowed from Spanish hospitals, where patients are arranged according\r\nto religious creeds, rather than bodily complaints. Every library has\r\nmore volumes than I can master; but no library though it be the conflux\r\nof all civilizations, has so many volumes as I may need to consult.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Story used to assert that no American could test the\r\naccuracy of Gibbon without crossing the Atlantic. Such an assertion\r\nwould now, perhaps, be extravagant, yet many of Gibbon's references are\r\nstill hard to trace in America. One instance may be worth notice. Our\r\napproaching national centenary leads us to curiosity in reference to the\r\nsecular feasts of the Romans. In Gibbon's account of the most famous\r\namong them, a thousand years from the founding of Rome, the main\r\nauthority quoted is Zosimus. But the history of Zosimus you will seek in\r\nvain throughout Madison libraries. You will not find his name in the\r\npublic collections of Chicago, or Cincinnati, or St. Louis, or San\r\nFrancisco. It is unlikely that any single copy of Zosimus has yet\r\npenetrated west of our Atlantic slope.\r\n\r\nBut how dare I thus speak about Zosimus? How is it possible for me to\r\nknow whether his history can, or cannot, be discovered, either on the\r\nPacific shore, or in the Mississippi valley? I know it, thanks to the\r\nLibrary of Our Historical Society, and specifically to its goodly array\r\nof bibliothecal catalogues.\r\n\r\nWhy will not our Centenary Women's Club buy our Free Library a Zosimus?\r\n\r\nFree libraries, especially those maintained by public taxation, were\r\nscarcely known before the last half of the nineteenth century. If in an\r\nantiquarian mood, I could indeed bring forth curious details concerning\r\nhalf a hundred in continental Europe, some of them running back several\r\ncenturies, but I forbear. The earliest British library law, similar to\r\nours in Wisconsin, dates from 1850. The earliest in Massachusetts--and I\r\nsuppose in America--was approved May 24, 1851. The first library opened\r\nin consequence of this law was in New Bedford, March 3, 1853. The\r\ngrandest triumph under the Massachusetts law is in Boston. The free\r\nlibrary there stands to-day surpassed in volumes by only three or four\r\nAmerican libraries--say the Astor, Congress, and Harvard--while in\r\narrangement, architecture, and equipment it is pronounced by the most\r\nenlightened foreigners unsurpassed by any library in the world.\r\n\r\nOur legislature in 1872 empowered the mayors and councils in towns and\r\ncities to lay an annual tax of one mill on a dollar of the assessed\r\nvaluation, for establishing and maintaining free libraries. This law\r\nwill bear good fruit. Yet it is a step backward from the act of 1859.\r\nThat act created a library fund by setting apart for that purpose\r\none-tenth of the school-fund income, and imposing a tax of one-tenth of\r\na mill on all property. The sum of $88,784.78 had been thus accumulated\r\nwhen the war of 1861 broke out,--and the money was used for military\r\npurposes. It ought to be refunded by the State, or United States, and\r\nexpended for its original object. The great superiority of the law of\r\n1859 lies in its extending to rural districts,--and so leaving no hamlet\r\nunvisited--while the maxim of the present law is, \"Coals to Newcastle,\r\nowls to Athens, apples to Alcinous. He that hath--to him shall be\r\ngiven.\" It gives a library to Madison, where 40,000 volumes were already\r\nwithin reach, but nothing at all to five and twenty other places in Dane\r\nCounty, whose need of books is ten times greater. But libraries bring\r\nforth after their kind, and free libraries, we may hope, will become\r\nco-extensive with free schools.\r\n\r\nMadison, to-day, in opening to all her sons and daughters a Free\r\nLibrary, has outstripped every other municipality in the State. It is a\r\nnoble preeminence, and will do her honor to the end of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Madison Free Library, it may be reasonably hoped, will approximate\r\nto the bibliothecal ideal. It starts with an inheritance of 3,308\r\nvolumes, accumulated during a score of years by the Madison Institute.\r\nIts revenue is considerable, and it will grow in even pace with the\r\ngrowth of the city. Nothing but Adam and Minerva was ever born of full\r\nstature. The tax now assessed for it would impoverish no man till after\r\nthe lapse of thrice three thousand years. It was limited to less than a\r\nthird of what the law allows because we make the entering edge of a\r\nwedge thin, and would learn wisdom from Satan who never makes his\r\ntemptations so bad at the beginning as at the end. Is is only the first\r\nstep that costs. The Free Library will be ready for windfalls, and so\r\nsurely as history repeats itself, they will pour cornucopias into its\r\nlap. Of the million volumes in the British Museum, two out of every five\r\nwere gifts. No wonder. Book-gatherers abhor the breaking up of their\r\ncollections as we do the dissolution of the Union, or as abolitionists\r\ndid the snapping of family ties by slave-traders. Lest what they have\r\njoined together shall be put asunder, they rejoice to lay up their\r\ntreasures in an institution which shall never die. Accordingly, in\r\ntracing the origin of one hundred and eighty libraries in continental\r\nEurope, it has been discovered that all of them, except sixteen, were\r\npresented to the municipalities by book-lovers.\r\n\r\nExperience this side the Atlantic is thus far equally encouraging. I\r\nwill notice a single specimen. The Boston Free Library is mainly\r\ncontributed by individuals. One thousand volumes were given by Everett;\r\n2,300 by Bowditch; 11,360 by Theodore Parker; 26,000 by Joshua Bates;\r\n11,899 by the Old South Church, and those of greater rarity than any\r\nother equal number of volumes. Then Ticknor and Prescott bestowed the\r\nbest Spanish library ever gathered by private men, and Wheelwright one\r\nscarcely inferior, relating to South America. Of pecuniary benefactions,\r\nI will only mention $10,000 from Lawrence, $30,000 from Phillips, and\r\n$50,000 from Bates. But legacies to the Free Library have become so\r\ncommon that we may confidently expect that, if any Bostonian shall die\r\nand bequeath it nothing, the courts will decide the neglect of the\r\nLibrary to be conclusive proof of insanity, and so will nullify his\r\nwill! On the whole, we cannot be too sanguine concerning the prospective\r\nprogress of our book-feast for the million.\r\n\r\nBut a library, however perfect, and though freely open to all the world,\r\nmay be a light shining in a darkness which comprehendeth it not. Many\r\nyears ago, I was a student in such a library at Rome. It was larger than\r\nany one in America at that time, and offered the best of all its stores\r\ndaily to everybody, and that without charge. Yet it was well-nigh a\r\nsolitude. The reason was obvious. My walk thither was through a gauntlet\r\nof beggar-boys, and I once took with me an Italian primer, and cried out\r\nthat I would give something to any boy who could read. I held it up\r\nbefore nineteen in succession, but no one could spell out a line. They\r\nhad eschewed not only writing as tempting to forgery, but reading also\r\nas a black art. Had they been giants they could,--like the barbarians\r\nwho sacked Rome,--ruin, but not relish, the nectared sweets of books. To\r\nthem the collective wisdom of the world was as sunshine to the blind, or\r\nas smoke in the nursery riddle,--\"roomful, houseful, can't catch a\r\nhandful!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Or like gospel pearls which pigs neglect\r\n    When pigs have that opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nBut in regard to _our_ Free Library, I have better hopes, and beg your\r\nleave to show _what use_, in my judgment, will be made of it. It will be\r\nresorted to for _amusement_. Some will flit through it in the spirit of\r\nthe Viennese, who turn their central cathedral into a thoroughfare on\r\npromenades and business walks. But such visitors will learn something in\r\nglancing at the backs of books. Books, as well as men, have a\r\nphysiognomy. Here, as elsewhere, the admirers of Shakespeare will take\r\nout his plays, return them with the leaves uncut, and then insist that\r\nbooksellers be instructed if Mr. Shakespeare writes any new book, to\r\nforward it without further orders. Many will have no eyes except for the\r\nvolumes of _fiction_, and sometimes will rather run through these than\r\nread them. Novels are a sort of cake, which, if eaten alone, is prone to\r\nmake mental dyspeptics. Yet most novel-readers will gain some profit\r\nfrom our library. Some of them will here acquire a facility in reading\r\nwhich for lack of practice has hitherto been unknown to them. No one has\r\nreally learned to read, until he has read to learn. Their interest in\r\nstories will beguile the toil of becoming _ready_ readers, and their\r\nrange of reading will naturally widen. But if it does not, they may\r\nlearn much. Every good fiction is _true_, if not to particular fact yet\r\nto general principles, to natural scenery, to human nature, to the ways\r\nof human life, manners, customs, the very age and body of the time. Even\r\nTom Moore declares that \"his chief work of fiction is founded on a long\r\nand labourious collection of facts.\" Again, when worn out by work, when\r\ncare-crazed, and nerves are unstrung, who has not found in fiction--the\r\nbalm of hurt minds--a recreation, a city of refuge, a restorative.\r\n\r\n    \"Cups that cheer but not inebriate?\"\r\n\r\nIn this way our free library will be a new pleasure, and the founder of\r\nit deserves the reward offered by the Sicilian tyrant, for such an\r\ninvention. Work was never so monotonous as now; accordingly, play ought\r\nto be more than ever amusing. The Kilkenny cats, who devoured each other\r\nall but the tails, left one orphan kitten which began to eat up itself,\r\nbut catching sight of a mouse was diverted from suicide. There is among\r\nus more than one disconsolate kitten now destroying himself, who will in\r\nour free feast of fiction espy a mouse which will reconcile him to life,\r\nand save him from himself. The rationale of this solace is indicated\r\nafter a forcible, though rather a homely fashion, in the Chinese saying:\r\n\"A dog chasing game does not mind the fleas which he _barks_ at while he\r\nlies in his kennel.\" \"The labour we delight in physics pain.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in all great works of fiction the purpose is, while not\r\no'erstepping the modesty of nature, to show virtue her own feature, and\r\nscorn her own image. Who can count the admirers of Scott and Dickens\r\nthat have learned from their portraitures moral lessons so well as never\r\nto forget them;--to loathe the mean and aspire to the noble;--to shun\r\nevil and cleave to good--in spite of temptations to one and from the\r\nother?\r\n\r\nBut, after all, our book-treasury will only now and then bestow its best\r\ngifts on those who resort to it merely for pleasure. To most visitors of\r\nthis class it must remain no more than a telescope to a child, something\r\nto play with rather than to look through. Accordingly, they no more\r\nexhaust the capacities of books than the Irish made full proof of\r\npotatoes while they cooked only the balls and left the tubers to rot in\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nBut the Free Library will be resorted to for _instruction_. Few will\r\nalways hold the amusing button so close to their eyes that it will hide\r\nthe instructive sun. From the start it will be superior to every private\r\ncollection in the city, and its superiority will increase. Accordingly,\r\nprofessional men will come thither to inform themselves either each in\r\nhis own specialty, or sallying on excursions from their home fields.\r\nBesides the time-honoured and traditional three professions, editors and\r\nteachers will be there, learning how to answer the hard questions of\r\npupils and subscribers. Each of these professionals will more or less\r\nmake known what he learns. The bibliothecal odor will be as plain upon\r\nthem as a certain other odor is upon those who emerge from the\r\nsmoking-car or saloon. \"Dispensing native perfumes they whisper whence\r\nthey stole those balmy spoils.\" But the bibliothecal leaven will leaven\r\nthe community more _directly_.\r\n\r\nGod has set geniuses as great lights in the firmament to give light and\r\ndelight as well on the earth. The circuit of such suns is unto the ends\r\nof the heaven, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. More and\r\nmore pervasive is their influence, like the spring-time, which leaves no\r\ncorner of the land untouched. In a library every man will recognize some\r\nsupreme author transfiguring whatever he touches,--crystallizing into\r\ndiamonds by wit, turning to gold with poetry, and glorifying as with\r\ntongues of angels by eloquence, and whom he hence worships as Scotchmen\r\ndo Burns and as all the world does Shakespeare. Less and less do men\r\nentertain angels unawares, more and more are they ashamed to know the\r\nworld's books only by name. Nobody now asks concerning Paradise Lost,\r\n\"What does it prove?\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Free Library will be patronized by the people in quest of\r\nanswers to multitudinous questions. Newspapers, whether in its\r\nreading-room or out of it, will rouse in many directions a curiosity\r\nthey cannot satisfy, and so will urge to the library. There is a story\r\nthat an Englishman in a London library, after looking through an atlas,\r\nsaid to a friend, \"Help me find _Umbrage_ on the map! I read in my\r\ngazette that the French have taken _Umbrage_. What a good-for-nothing\r\nminister is ours--to leave _Umbrage_ so poorly defended that the French\r\ncould take it.\" That John Bull discovered in the library either\r\n_umbrage_, or what was better for him--his own ignorance and the way to\r\nremove it, \"taking umbrage\" against himself. His gazette probably\r\nbrought the same earnest inquirer to the library for _history_ as well\r\nas for geography. A daily paper, which is the history of the world for\r\none day, leads backward, as a stream carries our thoughts to its\r\nfountain. Whoever repairs to a library with one historical query will be\r\nlikely to repeat his visit, since newspapers, in the light of history,\r\nwill become more significant as the last chapter in a novel is more\r\ninteresting to those who have read the previous chapters, and so often\r\nleads one back to them. Again, discussions are always arising, not\r\nmerely in formal debates, but as we sit in the house and walk by the\r\nway. Some carry them on by assertions and counter-assertions--a strong\r\nwill and a strong won't--equally positive and ignorant, discussing and\r\nsometimes leaving off the _dis_, till like Milton's devils they find no\r\nend, in wandering mazes lost. Too often \"It comes to pass that a\r\nterrible oath, with a swaggering accent twanged off, gives an opinion\r\nmore approbation than ever proof itself would have earned it.\" Others\r\nback up their opinions by _wagers_, in spite of a lurking feeling that\r\n\r\n    \"Bets are the blockhead's argument,--\r\n    The only logic he can vent,\r\n    His minor and his major.--\r\n\r\n    'Tis to confess your head a worse\r\n    Investigator than your purse,\r\n    To reason with a wager.\"\r\n\r\nBut where standard books are at hand, investigation will often either\r\ntake the place of disputation, or bring strife to a speedy end.\r\n\r\nLet us hope those here seeking props for their arguments will never be\r\nthose jealous lovers of books who cannot use them without using them up,\r\nor who spirit them away for themselves alone. Such abductors have\r\nsometimes infested the libraries in the Capitol. Their thefts can be\r\njustified only by that casuistry which holds stealing the relics of\r\nsaints for a pious fraud. But in truth the more holy the saint, the more\r\nheinous the sacrilege of what Hood calls _Book_-aneering.\r\n\r\nMoreover, every _lecture_ delivered in the city will send some\r\ninvestigators to the library, that they may confute, or confirm, or\r\namplify its teachings. A lecture that pops will not be as surely\r\n_popular_ as formerly, if the library shall evince that what is true in\r\nit is not new, and that what is new is not true, or that the speaker\r\ndraws on imaginations for facts and on facts for imaginations.\r\n\r\nEvery meeting of our Women's Centennial Club will start inquiries which\r\ncannot be answered without recourse to the library.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that books of _travel_ will here be largely consulted.\r\nSome of us purpose to go abroad. Such will read beforehand in order to\r\nadd a precious seeing to their eyes. They would dislike to have their\r\nexperiences those of a lady who when asked what she saw in Rome answered\r\n\"dirt,\" or of the London barber who at the coronation of Napoleon\r\nremembered nothing except that the Emperor was well shaved, or of the\r\nBostonian fresh from the West who, when called on for his opinion of\r\nMadison, said it would be a pretty fair Massachusetts village if it were\r\nnot spoiled by so many fresh water ponds around it. Others among us have\r\ntravelled already, and we shall be studious in the library that we may\r\nascertain what we ought to have seen--but did not, or the meaning of\r\nwhat we did see, but which was Greek to us. The Shah of Persia noted in\r\nhis journal that of all the fine things in Europe the finest to his mind\r\nwas a show of wax work. His library would teach him better, and would\r\nnot laugh at him, as we do. A Vermont friend of mine, after his trip to\r\nLondon, when asked whether he saw Westminster Abbey, confessed that he\r\ndid not, but added that Westminster Abbey was out of town at the time of\r\nhis visit. If he had free course in our library he would hardly excuse\r\nhimself in that way again. Soon after crossing the Mississippi at\r\nBurlington, I heard a New York merchant, bound for California,\r\nremarking: \"How much geography one learns in travelling. Here is\r\nBurlington. I always thought it in Illinois, but now I find it is in\r\nMissouri.\" Library-reading may by this time have added insight to his\r\nsight, and convicted him of the blunder which I suffered to pass\r\nuncorrected, though we chatted 100 miles together. There are others of\r\nus who, on hearing a traveller's tales, are curious to examine how far\r\nwe, like the old prophet, should count the way-faring man a fool, and\r\nhow far he uses his license to lie. Hence they will read that they may\r\nmake up their minds whether all MARK TWAIN'S caricatures have the ring\r\nof truth.\r\n\r\nA German table d'hote of twenty courses will surfeit a careless diner\r\nbefore it is half over, and yet fail to afford him either what he likes\r\nbest or what he should like best. Hence it compels guests to a careful\r\nchoice what they will partake of and what refuse of the blessing there\r\nis no room to receive in its fulness. A similar influence will be\r\nexerted by the free library where we fall into the embarassment of\r\nriches. We shall be driven to select from its bill of fare, that is the\r\ncatalogue, that fraction which we can enjoy most and which will profit\r\nus most.\r\n\r\n    \"Taste after taste upheld by kindliest change.\"\r\n\r\nSome persons, when they survey a library and perceive that they can\r\nnever read the hundredth part of its volumes, will be attracted to those\r\nworks which teach \"what to read,\" or open a panoramic outlook on the\r\ndiversified regions of the bookish world.\r\n\r\n    \"Of all the best of man's best knowledges,\r\n    The contents, indexes and title-pages,\r\n    Through all past, present, and succeeding ages.\"\r\n\r\nUnless we thus liberalize our views we are likely to vegetate, like the\r\nrhubarb pie plant, under a barrel, and see the world only through its\r\nbunghole. Ignorant of bibliographical guides and hence at a loss how to\r\nestimate books, the steward of a British nobleman sold as rubbish all\r\nvolumes in the library which lacked _covers_. One of those thus disposed\r\nof, and bought by a pedlar for nine pence, proved to be the very\r\nearliest issue of the British press, snapped up by the British museum\r\nfor L80, and could not now be bought for ten times that sum. In regard\r\nto the _intrinsic_ value of books blunders more egregious are daily\r\nmade. Libraries were never so needful as now, for libraries and life\r\nnever lay so close to one another as now. Our familiar sights lead to\r\ninterest in recondite knowledge. Photography, gas, the locomotive,\r\nkerosene, yes, every match that lights it, provokes questions in\r\nchemistry, or philosophy, which not every library can answer. No one can\r\ngaze at the dome of our Capitol without naturally falling into\r\narchitectural inquiries which draw him through a world of books that\r\nexpose the nakedness of his ignorance, yet never put him to open shame.\r\nBut the truth is too palpable to dwell on that in our day life touches\r\nlibraries at every point.\r\n\r\nIn all libraries there are readers whose emblem is dead fish who follow\r\nthe stream, but thanks to various accidents, some of this class, ceasing\r\nto be passive recipients, begin to investigate as active seekers. They\r\nat once rise to a higher mental plane. The contrast between active\r\nseekers and passive recipients is analogous to that between the\r\nmountaineers and the maritime aborigines of California. The mountaineers\r\nlived on grizzly bears--food which it was impossible to seize without\r\ntasking their energies to the utmost. But tasking trains. The maritimes\r\nlived on salmon, which were so abundant and so tame that they could be\r\ncaught by fishers who lay basking in the sun. But basking enervates.\r\nNaturally enough no Indians are superior to the mountaineers who are\r\nactive seekers, nor yet inferior to the maritimes, who are passive\r\nrecipients. What investigators seek they will not find at once; they may\r\nnever find it. But they are sure to discover something better, so that\r\nthey will say with LESSING, in the library at Wolfenbuttel, \"Were God to\r\nhold truth in one hand and search in the other, and give me my choice, I\r\nwould say: Give me seeking without finding, rather than finding without\r\nseeking!\"\r\n\r\n                    \"All things that are,\r\n    Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.\"\r\n    Courtship once over, the novel ends.\r\n\r\nIn the library where LESSING was made librarian--not that he might serve\r\nthe library, but that the library might serve him--I took in my hand\r\nwith reverence the inkstand out of which he distilled the essence of a\r\nthousand books, and reformed German literature as radically as LUTHER\r\nhad reformed German religion.\r\n\r\nAll truths being inter-dependent, every road will lead to the end of the\r\nworld, and so while studying one subject a man becomes interested in\r\nothers, and his range of inquiry expands. When he kindles one dry stick,\r\nmany green ones will catch, and his brightest blazes are lit up by\r\nunexpected sparks. One quickly learns to love hunting, and before\r\nworking up many topics, he forms an investigating habit which will\r\nperpetuate itself. Thus while seeking an oyster, he finds a pearl, like\r\nSAUL who sought asses and found a kingdom. Henceforth he reads more by\r\nsubjects, each a cord to string pearls on, than by volumes, for he feels\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n    \"Unless to some particular end designed,\r\n    Reading is but a specious trifling of the mind,\r\n    And then, like ill-digested food,\r\n    To humors turns and not to blood.\"\r\n\r\nBut less and less of that sort is his reading, though it range through\r\nall time, and tax all the world. Such an inquirer will live longer than\r\nMETHUSELAH, for he will have more thoughts, yet he will wish each of his\r\nminutes was a millenary. He will read with an appetite growing as long\r\nas he lives; indeed reading will help him to live longer. A thousand\r\nsuch readers feel what one has spoken out, saying:\r\n\r\n\"In a library I was thrown, instead of worse society, into the company\r\nof poets, philosophers and sages--to me good angels and ministers of\r\ngrace. From these silent instructors who often do more than fathers for\r\nour interests, from these delightful associates I learned something of\r\nthe divine and more of the human religion. They were my interpreters in\r\nthe House Beautiful of God, and my guides among the Delectable Mountains\r\nof Nature,\r\n\r\n    Blessing be with them and eternal praise,\r\n    Who gave me nobler loves and nobler cares.\"\r\n\r\nPre-eminently to the _young_ will the myriad-minded library be an oracle\r\nin perplexities. They have been better trained in public schools than we\r\nof the last generation were. They have broken ground in more various\r\nstudies, and their curiosity has been stimulated concerning more\r\nquestions. Each question, each study puts in their hand a new _key_ to\r\nthe locks which shut up libraries. Singers love to sing, and it is joy\r\nfor the just to do justice, so will our youth rejoice to use in the\r\nlibrary the skill they have acquired in school as naturally as when they\r\nget jack knives they take to whittling. The public schools then find in\r\nfree libraries their fitting supplement, and complement. Schools without\r\nlibraries feed a prisoner with salted viands and then tantalize his\r\nthirst with pitchers and bottles, all empty. The free school and the\r\nfree library will join hands like husband and wife in a well-matched\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n    \"He is the half-part of a blessed man,\r\n    Left to be finished by such as she;\r\n    And she a fair divided excellence,\r\n    Whose fulness of perfection lies in him;\r\n    But two such silver currents when they join,\r\n    Do glorify the banks that bind them in.\r\n\r\nEach befits the other, as ALEXANDER said concerning the finest poem and\r\nthe most costly casket in the world when he enshrined the Iliad in the\r\nPersian box of gold and gems. Both are lotteries where tickets cost\r\nnothing and everybody may draw all the prizes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the free library will be to some nothing less than\r\nan _inspiration_. _To some_--I wish I could say _to all_, but alas, it\r\nis only an \"elect few\" whom the library can inspire. Spectacles are\r\ninvaluable,--but only to those who have eyes. One Sultan never wore a\r\nshirt that had not every word of the Koran written on it yet absorbed\r\nlittle piety. AARON'S excuse for making only a golden calf was, that the\r\nJews did not bring him gold enough to make an ox. The cherubim who know\r\nmost can never equal the seraphim who love most. An ugly and stupid man,\r\nwalking with a lady on each arm, boasts that he is between wit and\r\nbeauty, but may not imbibe one particle of either.\r\n\r\nTo some, however, a free library will make up for the lack of a liberal\r\neducation. More than that. It will furnish such an education every jot\r\nand tittle of it, and that, in some sense, better than was ever bestowed\r\nin a college, because acquired in the face of greater difficulties.\r\nLibraries have often vouchsafed this priceless boon. That in Salem did\r\nto BOWDITCH, the mathematician, in the last century, and to WHIPPLE, the\r\nessayist, in this. The Edinburgh library made HUME an historian. Another\r\nwas inspiration to COBBETT. So was that of the Erfurt convent to LUTHER.\r\n\"It had purchased,\" says his biographer, \"at heavy cost, several Latin\r\nBibles just printed for the first time in the neighboring city of Mainz.\r\nWhen he first opened one of these tomes his eyes fell on the story of\r\nHANNAH and SAMUEL. \"O, God,\" he murmured, \"could I have one of these\r\nbooks I would seek no other worldly treasure.\" A great revolution then\r\ntook place in his soul. His happiest hours were in the library.\r\nConcerning such a scholar--\r\n\r\n                      \"We cannot say: ''Tis pity\r\n    He lacks instructions,' for he seems a master\r\n    To most that teach.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of ancient Libraries on classical writers is manifest from\r\ntheir quotations. PLUTARCH'S have been traced to 250 authors. PLINY'S to\r\n2,000 works. Classical Libraries preserved in Constantinople, so long as\r\nstudied, made there a Goshen of light in the Dark Ages, and when carried\r\nto Italy proved a Promethean spark to kindle occidental culture anew. It\r\nis well known that inventions are oftenest struck out in the Patent\r\nOffice, the grand store-house of inventions. In the world of mind, as\r\nwell as of matter, new ideas are suggested where old ideas most\r\ncongregate, or are most communed with. According to CHAUCER,\r\n\r\n    \"Out of old fields, as man saith,\r\n      Cometh all the new corn from year to year,\r\n    And out of old books, in good faith,\r\n      Cometh all the new science that men lear.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea of writing the \"Life of COLUMBUS\" first darted into the mind\r\nof IRVING, when, in Madrid, he found himself surrounded by an unrivaled\r\nmagazine of materials made ready to his hand, and for which the world\r\nhad been ransacked. Thus the sight of means to make good books makes\r\ngood books made.\r\n\r\nNot only those volumes which compose the body of literature, but those\r\nfiner essences which form its soul,--the literature of power,--stamped\r\nin Nature's mint of ecstasy--are marked all over with proofs of\r\nfamiliarity with the best that had been achieved,--each in its own\r\ndepartment. Nobody has hesitated thus to affirm concerning VIRGIL,\r\nDANTE, TASSO, MILTON. But it is commonly said that SHAKESPEARE was\r\n_ignorant_. The truth is that no ignorant man, no ordinary, scholar can\r\nunderstand his allusions, historical, romantic, classical, or those to\r\nart, science, nationalities, customs--or even his words. He could get\r\nmore from a Library in a day than most men in a life-time, but he needed\r\nit still.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of SHAKESPEARE, I mean the man who wrote the Plays reputed\r\nhis, no matter whether that author was BACON, or JOHN SMITH, or even our\r\ntownsman GEORGE B.\r\n\r\nWe ought to say that SHAKESPEARE was a universal man,--because he was\r\nheir of all ages,--and his was universal knowledge, a knowledge which\r\nneither can we fathom nor could he find without a library.\r\n\r\nHis peculiarity was ability to discern the immortal part of books, or to\r\nstamp what were otherwise perishable with his own immortality. Whoever\r\ncan do much without tools, can do more with them. Accordingly men do\r\ntheir broken weapons rather use than their bare hands. Whoever can do\r\nmuch without a library, can do more with a library. DAVID did much with\r\na sling, but more with better arms, and builded an armory on which there\r\nhung a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.\r\n\r\nIf then there be among us any one person endued with any spark of\r\nShakespearian or other genius he will find it kindling to a flame\r\nthrough contact in this library with similar celestial fires. To such a\r\n\"meeting soul!\" as MILTON calls it,--the library will prove a better\r\nbonanza than has been prospected in our States of silver and gold.\r\nThough having nothing he shall possess all things,--infinite riches in a\r\nlittle room.\r\n\r\nThus our Free Library will amuse, and instruct, and inspire. Over its\r\nentrance I seem to read as on the front of the oldest in the world, the\r\ninscription, \"The healing of the soul,\" or the words of FRANKLIN to his\r\nnamesake town, \"I give you books instead of a bell, sense rather than\r\nsound.\" Let it have free course for a generation, calling to culture as\r\nceaselessly as a standing army calls to war, and this community will say\r\nwith SENECA, \"Leisure without books and letters is mental death and\r\nburial.\"\r\n\r\nThe first public library in Ohio--just two years younger than the\r\nState--was founded in Ames. It was bought by hunters who threw together\r\na lot of raccoon skins, sent them in a sleigh by one of their number to\r\nBoston and there bartered them for books. They soon hunted Greek as\r\nzealously as game, and while Ames remained a hamlet ten of them, or\r\ntheir children, were among the early graduates of the State University.\r\n\r\nThe influences of a library are _cumulative_, and sometimes become\r\nmanifest only after a long lapse of ages. The cuniform library of\r\nAssyrian bricks, dating from pre-historic periods, burned up, buried and\r\nforgotten just now emerges from its grave speaking in a voice heard\r\nround the world, and no less authoritative than a second book of\r\nGenesis. From its shelves more centuries look down upon us than upon\r\nNAPOLEON at the Pyramids.\r\n\r\nLibraries are hemmed in by no lines of State, nation, race, language,\r\nreligion or century. Their field is the world. But ours is the\r\ncosmopolitan age, and we are pre-eminently the cosmopolitan people. More\r\nthan any other people, then must we feel the need of libraries, which\r\nare, of all institutions, the most cosmopolitan. Hence they will benefit\r\nus most.\r\n\r\nConsiderations like these demonstrate that free libraries tend to\r\n_equality_ and _fraternity_. They are free lunches, crying to all: \"Cut,\r\nand come again!\" As we all have equal rights at the polls and in court,\r\nso have we in the free library. In church we each secure a blessing in\r\nproportion to our capacity; so can we in the library. In both blessed\r\nare they who hunger and thirst, for they shall be filled. In public\r\nschools all can enjoy the best of teaching without money and without\r\nprice; so can they in the free library. Free libraries will create an\r\naristocracy--one open to talent and toil, but to nothing else; the\r\naristocracy of knowledge. Where street cars have been introduced, half\r\nthe private carriages are soon given up, so the establishment of free\r\nlibraries will lead many to refrain from large domestic collections as\r\nsuperfluous, and to the transfer of many a private library to the public\r\nshelves, where they will not only do more good, but will be better cared\r\nfor, better arranged, and more accessible than they now are even to\r\ntheir owners. One millionaire as we walked into his library, said with a\r\nsigh: \"See how many gaps there are in my shelves! Five hundred of my\r\nbooks are missing, lent and lost.\" \"Lost!\" cried I, half in joke, \"say\r\nrather found! lost to you, but found each by some one who will make the\r\nmost of them. Would to heaven these 5,000 were lost in the same way,\r\nlost by you who have no time nor care for them, found by those who have\r\nboth. Nobody could steal them from you, but at most only from moths and\r\nworms, dust and mould.\" Rich men who have bought libraries as luxuries\r\nwill learn that the way to save them is to lose them, and that their\r\nbooks serve them best when deposited in free libraries.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of _sham_ equality result from outside pressure. In\r\nVenetian gondolas all awnings are required to be black that no one may\r\noutshine his neighbor. Under the first republic the French proscribed\r\nall titles but citizen, and citizeness, which they gave to everybody.\r\nCommunists would make all men's shares in property equal. Endeavors of\r\nthis sort not only fail, but prove suicidal like the impetuous Irishman,\r\ninsisting that one man is as good as another, and _a great dey better\r\ntoo_. The influence of Free Libraries, however is toward genuine and not\r\nmerely visible equality. Thanks to them the most expensive luxury of the\r\nrich becomes the daily food of the poor, and the tree of knowledge no\r\nmore bears forbidden fruit. A volume which I can draw out of a library\r\nat will is worth as much to me as if I owned it. In fact, though my\r\nprivate library is not small, the books I read are more often borrowed\r\nthan my own.\r\n\r\nIf I take out books from a library, I am doubly spurred to to make their\r\ncontents my own, because those books must be returned more promptly than\r\nto the friend who neither exacts fines nor yet even notes in a book what\r\nbook we borrow.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN tells us that \"he often sat up reading, the greater part of\r\nthe night, when a book borrowed (he means _stolen_) from booksellers in\r\nthe evening, was to be returned in the morning lest it should be found\r\nmissing.\" In proportion as men make full proof of books, they become\r\nalike _inside_, in real communion with great authors, in information,\r\ntaste, mental capacity, mastery of speech,--accomplishments which cannot\r\nbe lost, and which render each one more equal and congenial with his\r\nfellows. Men will still differ by God, not by man. What then is the Free\r\nLibrary less than the key stone in our Republican arch?\r\n\r\nWhen we would show attention to strangers, it has been a Madison custom\r\nto take them into our cemetery. That grave yard is well worth showing.\r\nBut in time to come I trust we shall rather exhibit our Libraries, and\r\nsay; \"These are our jewels.\" Not tombs, but living shrines that on the\r\nliving still work miracles,--the shrines where all the relics of the\r\nsaints full of true virtue are preserved, where the dead live and the\r\ndumb speak--the dead sceptered sovereigns who still rule our spirits\r\nfrom their urns. This sun of our intellectual worlds is\r\n\r\n                  \"Made porous to receive\r\n    And drink the liquid light, firm to retain\r\n    Its gathered beams, great palace now of light,\r\n    Hither as to a fountain countless stars\r\n    Repairing in their golden urns draw light.\"\r\n\r\nLet us rejoice in it all glorious within, even as our Capitol and\r\nUniversity parks are without.\r\n\r\nA library,--the assembled souls of all men deem most wise, the only men\r\nwho speak loud enough for posterity to hear;--reminds me of that fresco\r\nby RAPHAEL, which I admired most of all his Vatican masterpieces,\r\npopularly styled \"The School of Athens,\" and which I hope to see hung up\r\nas the genius of our library hall, as I have seen it in many. In some\r\none of the fifty-two figures glowing with life in that picture, every\r\nvariety of culture has a representative. You see there the practical\r\nman, like FRANKLIN'S Poor Richard, in Diogenes rough and ready by his\r\ntub. Archimedes is drawing a diagram in the sand. On the broad steps of\r\na temple stand Ptolemy, with the terrestrial and Hipparchus with the\r\ncelestial globe. No sage is without a docile retinue. SOCRATES, with sly\r\nhumor, is humbling the self-sufficient ALCIBIADES that he may rouse him\r\nto loftier aspirations. PYTHAGORAS is writing among disciples, one of\r\nwhom holds his musical scale, while above all, and in the midst of the\r\ntemple, appear ARISTOTLE, father of natural philosophy, pointing down to\r\nthe earth, and PLATO, the father of spiritual philosophy with hand\r\nuplifted toward heaven, man as it were feeling for God. The culture\r\nproffered in such a School of Athens, as RAPHAEL painted--and as an\r\nideal free library is to my mind, has its fittest emblem in the miracle\r\nof architecture, the dome,--which is well said to unite clustered arches\r\nand pillars and radiate in equal expansion towards every quarter of the\r\nearth, while with every convergent curve it soars heavenward, buried in\r\nair, and looking to the stars.\r\n\r\n    \"Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\n    This section, devoted to the general relations of the\r\n    library and society, which opened with a historical account\r\n    by Prof. Moses Coit Tyler, may appropriately close with\r\n    another of similar tenor, contributed eleven years later to\r\n    _The American Magazine of Civics_ (New York, May, 1895) by\r\n    Prof. Henry H. Barber. It covers some of the same ground but\r\n    gives results to a later date, while it is still only\r\n    introductory to the social development of more recent years.\r\n\r\n    Henry Hervey Barber was born in Warwick, Mass., Dec. 30,\r\n    1835, graduated at Meadville Theological Seminary in 1861\r\n    and after holding several Unitarian pastorates was professor\r\n    of philosophy and theology there from 1884 to 1904. He was\r\n    also editor of the Unitarian Review from 1875 to 1884. He\r\n    died about 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo public institution has made greater progress during the last few\r\nyears or grown more rapidly in public interest and favor than the free\r\npublic library. The building of a magnificent structure in Chicago,\r\ntogether with the excellent Newberry free reference library, and in\r\ncooperation with the fast growing library of the Chicago University,\r\nwill make perhaps the most superb public provision for free literary\r\nculture ever furnished by any municipality. Boston has lately\r\ntransferred its more than half a million volumes to the new and noble\r\npublic library building on the Back Bay. The newspapers of this last\r\nweek tell us that in New York Mr. Tilden is after all not to be finally\r\ncounted out; but that the two millions rescued from his estate by the\r\nhigh sense of honor of one of his heirs is to be joined with the\r\ninvaluable Astor Library, and the choice Lennox Reference Library, and\r\nall made free and available to the public--a property valued in the\r\naggregate at eight million dollars. These events, together with the\r\nrecent founding of the Carnegie free libraries in Pittsburg and\r\nAllegheny, the not very remote establishment of the Enoch Pratt Free\r\nLibrary in Baltimore, and the addition by Mr. Henry C. Lea to the\r\nsplendid Ridgway foundation in Philadelphia, constitute a series of\r\nbrilliant triumphs for the free public library, unparalleled in the\r\nhistory of educational institutions, and seldom equalled, I must think,\r\nin the intellectual progress of civilization.\r\n\r\nNor do these metropolitan successes indicate, after all, the most\r\nessential advance. The frequency with which private beneficence is\r\ncoming to the aid of public enterprise in smaller cities and country\r\ntowns, for the establishment and increase of these libraries; the recent\r\nnotable instances of stimulative auxiliary legislation; and the growth\r\nof intelligent interest in new and widely scattered sections of the\r\ncivilized world, are equally significant, and perhaps even more widely\r\nbeneficent. It is the era of the free public library; and it is of\r\nspecial interest to us to see that our community and our commonwealth\r\nare moving in accord with this tide of new feeling and enterprise\r\nconcerning it.\r\n\r\nOf special interest, I say, to us as Pennsylvanians; for we are glad to\r\nremember that it is here that the first impulse was given to the\r\nfoundation of the system of circulating libraries, the development of\r\nwhich is the free public library in England and America. Benjamin\r\nFranklin, after considerable effort, founded in 1732 the Philadelphia\r\nLibrary Company, the \"mother,\" as he himself calls it, \"of all the\r\nsubscription libraries in North America.\"\r\n\r\nThis library which Franklin started for the advantage of himself and his\r\nfifty young business associates, in the early time, when, as he says,\r\n\"there was not a good bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the\r\nsouthward of Boston,\" and when most of the books had to be imported from\r\nEngland, was followed soon by the establishment of more ambitious\r\nsimilar libraries in Newport (1747) and Hartford (1774); and later in\r\nmany other places in England and this country. These were called public\r\nlibraries, though books could only be taken out by subscribers.\r\nProbably, however, as in Philadelphia, the librarian could \"permit any\r\ncivil gentlemen to peruse the books of the library in the library room.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was in the formation of many so-called \"Social Libraries\" in the\r\nsmaller cities and country towns of New England and the Middle States,\r\nearly in the present century, that the foundations of the free municipal\r\nlibrary were laid. These subscription libraries, in their growth and in\r\ntheir decay, no less than in the appetite for books they developed,\r\ncreated a demand and at length a necessity for public provision for what\r\nhad come to be one of the prime intellectual needs of many communities.\r\n\r\nMeantime in Scotland, in 1816, Samuel Brown of Haddington, following in\r\npart the methods of London booksellers, established a system of free\r\nitinerating libraries, loaning without cost selections of fifty books in\r\neach package to villages and neighborhoods that would engage to\r\ncirculate and take proper care of them. At the end of two years each\r\nloan was called in, and another of different works sent in its place.\r\nThis scheme was for many years highly successful, and doubtless highly\r\nuseful; but seems to have failed soon after the death of its projector\r\nand inspirer in 1839. The system had the earnest sanction of Lord\r\nBrougham, and about 1825 was taken up in some parts of England; and, in\r\na modified form, has had a great success in Melbourne and its\r\nneighborhood, in Australia. Stanley Jevons, whose article on the\r\nrationale of free public libraries in his \"Methods of Social Reform\" is\r\none of the most interesting and valuable contributions to the literature\r\nof this subject, commends it as the best form of extending free public\r\nlibraries in the rural portions of Great Britain, and he estimates that\r\nthere ought to be three thousand such literary itinerants in England and\r\nWales.\r\n\r\nThis system was copied in this country in the School District Libraries\r\nwhich were started in the state of New York in 1835, and a few years\r\nafterward were in successful operation in Massachusetts and other New\r\nEngland states, and in Michigan and Ohio at least, among states further\r\nwest. At first every school district raising thirty dollars the first\r\nyear and ten dollars thereafter, by tax or subscription, was assisted by\r\nthe state--I cite the Massachusetts statute--to a like sum; and a small\r\nbut choice selection of books sent to it for free circulation within the\r\ndistrict. A little later Massachusetts, at least, removed this\r\ncondition; and supplied every school district with such a library. These\r\nlibraries after remaining in use for a while, and generally being\r\nthoroughly read, were exchanged among the districts. New books were thus\r\ncontinually coming to new readers. This movement was earnestly forwarded\r\nby that pioneer among American educators, Horace Mann, and during the\r\nperiod of my boyhood was a godsend to the young people of New England. I\r\nwant to bless the memory of Samuel Brown, Father Page (a pioneer of the\r\nsystem in New York), and Horace Mann for the gleams of literary light\r\nthus cast across the bookless darkness of New England rural homes forty\r\nto fifty years ago. This highly economical missionary agency of general\r\nintelligence passed away in New England with the incoming of the more\r\nsatisfactory town system of free libraries. The cause of its decadence\r\nelsewhere is not clear, but it has lately had a remarkable resurrection\r\nin New York, as we soon shall see.\r\n\r\nThe first free town library in America, or the world, supported by\r\nmunicipal taxation, was established by the efforts of Abiel Abbot, D.D.,\r\nin Peterboro, New Hampshire, in 1833. A decayed social library and an\r\noperatives' library, and perhaps some other small collections, were thus\r\ngathered under the shelter of the town; and took on new life from its\r\nfostering care, and the small annual appropriation for new books which\r\nis the breath of life to all libraries. Here, as always, it was _a man_\r\nthat inspired the advance movement and carried it on to successful\r\nfulfilment.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, New Hampshire passed a general law enabling towns and cities to\r\nmaintain free libraries by taxation; and in 1851 Massachusetts, which\r\nhad granted Boston in 1847 the right to establish such a library, passed\r\na similar general enabling act. Several other states followed almost\r\nimmediately, and nearly every northern and northwestern state, except\r\nPennsylvania, has since adopted the measure. In 1893, twenty states had\r\nenacted similar statutes; and, in all, more than seven hundred free\r\nlibraries have been established under them. They have increased--as\r\nmight naturally have been expected--most rapidly in the portions of the\r\ncountry where other library agencies, and where an efficient public\r\nschool system, have been longest and most efficiently at work. Thus, of\r\nthe seven hundred libraries, more than three hundred are in\r\nMassachusetts (according to the returns of the Public Library Commission\r\nfor 1894), or 1,233 volumes for every thousand of population; in New\r\nHampshire something over one hundred (in 1894), or 464 volumes per\r\nthousand of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has kept nearly equal pace with our foremost states in\r\nfree library legislation. A general enabling act to establish and\r\nsupport free libraries for the people from municipal rates was passed by\r\nParliament in 1850, and accepted with great energy and enthusiasm by\r\nmany of the northern towns and cities. Eighty-six free libraries, not\r\nincluding branches, had been opened before 1880; but, as in this\r\ncountry, the conservatism of the southern portions of the country has\r\nprevented their general establishment. For similar reasons only the\r\nprovince of Ontario has made any considerable movement in this direction\r\nin the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nThis hasty historical sketch would be very incomplete without some\r\naccount of the recent legislation, in several states, for the assistance\r\nof the smaller towns and villages in the establishment and increase of\r\npublic libraries. This legislation has already had marvelous results.\r\nMassachusetts, in 1890, appropriated one hundred dollars to any town\r\nthat would raise by taxation, or appropriate from the dog tax, or\r\notherwise raise, at least fifty dollars (or if its valuation was less\r\nthan one million dollars it should raise twenty-five dollars, or if less\r\nthan $250,000 it should raise at least fifteen dollars); and should\r\nagree to take care of the books, and furnish the agency of distribution.\r\nThe sums granted by the state are in the hands of a board of\r\ncommissioners appointed by the governor (with the advice and consent of\r\nthe council); and so far these commissioners--librarians and\r\nothers--have been eminent citizens, serving without salaries, and having\r\nonly $500 in their hands annually for clerk hire and traveling expenses.\r\nThe commission is also required to give advice and information to\r\nlibrarians and others concerning selection of books, cataloguing, and\r\nadministration; and to select and forward the books granted by the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nNow for results. The commission has thus aided in establishing, in four\r\nyears, more than sixty free public libraries in small towns (out of one\r\nhundred and four not thus supplied) and its action has shamed a few\r\nlarger towns into establishing them; so that now only two and three\r\nfourths per cent of the population of the state, in forty-four small\r\ntowns, were in January, 1894, without their advantages. And this has\r\nbeen accomplished with an entire expense to the commonwealth of less\r\nthan ten thousand dollars. _Per contra_, more than half a million\r\ndollars were given by individuals in a single year for similar purposes\r\nwithin the state. Certainly, this has been a most economical and\r\neffective public outlay; free, too, from all suspicion of any one's\r\nfattening by political jobbery.\r\n\r\nThe record of New Hampshire is even more remarkable. This state passed a\r\nlaw in 1891, similar to the one outlined above, and over eighty towns\r\naccepted its provisions, and established free libraries within a\r\ntwelvemonth after it came in force. We are glad to read that the states\r\nof Maine, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania are moving in the direction of a\r\nmeasure that has proved so effective in its operation, and that must be\r\nso widely beneficent.\r\n\r\nThe state of New York has adopted another system to stimulate the\r\ndevelopment of the free library. Her enabling act of many years ago\r\nproduced, as we have seen, comparatively small results; and in 1892 a\r\nlaw was passed authorizing the Regents of the University of New York to\r\nlend for a limited time--usually six months--selections of books from\r\nthe duplicate department of the state library, or from books purchased\r\nfor the purpose, to any public library in the state; or, where none\r\nexists, to twenty-five petitioners in any town or village of the state.\r\nA fee of five dollars is required, to cover cost of transportation,\r\ncatalogue, etc., for a loan of one hundred volumes, and a smaller sum\r\n(three dollars) for a loan of fifty volumes. This plan, it will be seen,\r\nis a revival of the old school district method; and of that instituted\r\nby Samuel Brown in Scotland, and the later one found successful in\r\nAustralia. The antipodes have a fashion lately of suggesting valuable\r\nobject-lessons for social legislation. In small communities it has the\r\nadvantage of making books do manifold duty, and of meeting the wants of\r\nvaried communities and occupations. By judicious and varied selection,\r\nclubs, classes, schools, and reading circles may be aided in special\r\ncourses and investigations. At the end of twenty months one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five of these free loan libraries had been sent out by the New\r\nYork Board of Regents; of which nearly one half (44) went to communities\r\nwithout public libraries, the remainder going to libraries already\r\nestablished (22), to university extension centers (18), and to academy\r\nlibraries open to the public (22). Eleven thousand nine hundred volumes\r\nwere thus made accessible to the public, with a total circulation of not\r\nfar from 25,000 volumes and 9,000 readers. This system, which seems even\r\nmore economical than the Massachusetts one, has greatly promoted\r\ninterest in good reading, and led to the establishment of several local\r\npublic libraries. The system is very elastic and is easily adapted to\r\nthe rapidly growing demands for its privileges. As a pioneer method, or\r\nas auxiliary to municipal libraries, it promises excellent results.\r\n\r\nAfter this historical survey it would hardly seem necessary to dwell\r\nupon the arguments in behalf of the free public library. \"There is\r\nprobably no mode of expending public money,\" says Stanley Jevons, \"which\r\ngives a more extraordinary and immediate return in utility and innocent\r\nenjoyment.\" He affirms that in Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, and\r\nsome other great towns in England, as in similar communities in this\r\ncountry, where such libraries have existed for years, there is but one\r\nopinion about them. \"They are classed with town-halls, police courts,\r\nprisons, and poorhouses as necessary adjuncts of our stage of\r\ncivilization.\" A more natural, and certainly more cheerful, collocation\r\nwould class them with free schools, museums, and public parks, as Jevons\r\nhimself afterwards suggests. \"The main _raison d'etre_ of free public\r\nlibraries, as indeed of public museums, art galleries, parks, halls,\r\npublic clocks, and many other kinds of public works, is the enormous\r\nincrease of utility which is thereby acquired for the community at a\r\ntrifling cost.\" He proceeds to illustrate by several instances what he\r\ncalls \"the remarkable multiplication of utility\" in the case of free\r\nlending libraries by several instances. Every book, in the first year of\r\nthe Birmingham Free Library, was issued on an average seventeen times,\r\nand the periodical literature turned over fifty times. In Leeds, every\r\nbook was used eighteen times. In larger libraries and in later use, of\r\ncourse, the figures are less, averaging from three to ten times, the\r\nwhole cost of each issue averaging only from two to five cents. Similar\r\nstatistics may be found in the _Forum_ article already referred to in\r\nregard to the manifold use of books furnished in New York.\r\n\r\nThe comfort and moral economy of a cheerful, well-lighted reading-room,\r\ntoo, is overwhelmingly illustrated. Mr. Jevons found that in Manchester\r\nall persons of suitable age visited the free libraries on an average\r\nthirteen times a year, of whom three fourths came to read in the\r\nreading-rooms. Such a refuge from the perils of the saloon and the\r\nstreet is an immense benefaction in any neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe relative cheapness of securing this means of general culture and\r\nenjoyment, this efficient antidote to vice and ignorance, is strikingly\r\nshown by comparing its cost with other items of governmental\r\nexpenditure, and the statistics of national luxuries and vices. The\r\neighty-six free libraries in the large cities of Great Britain cost not\r\nmore than half a million dollars per year--one fifth the cost of a first\r\nclass ironclad. The statistics I have given show that the cost of the\r\ntwo war vessels just voted by Congress might be abundantly sufficient to\r\ninsure the organization on the Massachusetts plan of a free library in\r\nevery village and country town of the United States, not now accessible\r\nto such a library. The expenditure for drink, for horse-racing, or even\r\nfor tobacco, for a single year, would royally equip and endow a public\r\nlibrary for every thousand people now without such privileges. As\r\npost-office savings banks are, wherever established, a mighty engine for\r\nteaching thrift, as public parks are an incalculable source of health\r\nand enjoyment in our cities, so the public library, \"the free literary\r\npark,\" as Jevons calls it, is a most effective agency for the promotion\r\nof culture and civilization.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1851, George Ticknor, the distinguished author of the\r\n\"History of Spanish Literature\" and a benefactor of the Boston Public\r\nLibrary, wrote to Edward Everett: \"I would establish a library which\r\ndiffers from all free libraries yet attempted; I mean one in which any\r\npopular books tending to moral and intellectual improvement shall be\r\nfurnished in such numbers that many persons can be reading the same book\r\nat the same time; in short, that not only the best books of all sorts,\r\nbut the pleasant literature of the day, shall be made accessible to the\r\nwhole people when they most care for it--that is, when it is fresh and\r\nnew. I would thus by following the popular taste--unless it should\r\ndemand something injurious--create a real appetite for healthy reading.\r\nThis appetite once formed will take care of itself. It will in a great\r\nmajority of cases demand better and better books.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Everett's conservatism doubted the wisdom of these principles for\r\nthe foundation of a library: but they are essentially those which have\r\nproved sound in the free library system of England and New England, of\r\nAustralia and the Northwestern cities. In the light of fifty years'\r\nexperience, indeed, Everett's skepticism reads like Governor Berkeley's\r\nreport on education in Virginia, in which he thanked God that there were\r\nno free schools in Virginia and hoped that there would be none for a\r\nhundred years. The communities in which libraries, approaching George\r\nTicknor's ideal, have been longest established, would do without paved\r\nstreets or electric lights sooner than without these libraries, and they\r\nsupport them by taxation as cheerfully as the public schools. Indeed,\r\nthe free library in not a few communities is reckoned an invaluable and\r\nindispensable adjunct of the public school, the very crown of the system\r\nof popular education. Such librarians as Green of Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts, and Whitney of Watertown, and Hosmer of Minneapolis, keep\r\nin touch with the work of the schools, and apprize the various classes\r\nof pupils of new books especially valuable for their work. More than\r\nthis, they have regard to the needs of the various clubs, trades, and\r\nprofessions, and keep their members aware of valuable books in their\r\nspecial departments. But perhaps the most helpful service of all is\r\nrendered by capable librarians in the constant advice given to\r\ninexperienced readers, and the frequent bulletins sent out to stimulate\r\nthe interest and instruct the intelligence of the community. It is of\r\nspecial interest to note that the demand for good reading has been\r\ngreatly increased wherever the public library has been administered in\r\nthis way. Indeed, booksellers and proprietary libraries have come to\r\nfavor the opening of the free library as largely increasing the demand\r\nfor their books.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that with this large and various capacity of social\r\nservice, the free library should be rapidly growing in public favor; nor\r\nthat private munificence should frequently come to the municipal\r\nprovision. There is no public object for which so generous gifts are\r\noften made. In the year 1893, for instance, five hundred thousand\r\ndollars were contributed to public libraries and the erection of library\r\nbuildings in Massachusetts alone. \"There has been ready perception,\"\r\nsays Fletcher in his \"Public Libraries in America,\" \"of the truth that\r\none's memory cannot better be perpetuated than by association with an\r\ninstitution so popular and at the same time so elevating and refining as\r\nthe public library. Memorial libraries are therefore very abundant, and\r\nas expense has not been spared in the erection of such memorials, many\r\nof our towns, even the smaller ones, are ornamented by library buildings\r\nwhich are gems of architecture.... The fact remains, with all its\r\nsignificance, that about the public library cluster naturally the\r\naffections and the interest of the community. In its endowment, on the\r\none hand by private beneficence, and on the other by public taxation, is\r\nillustrated that collaboration of the rich and the poor in the pursuit\r\nof the highest ends which has in it the promise, and perhaps the\r\npotency, of the solution of vexing social questions.\"\r\n\r\nThe remembrance that these statements are only locally accepted, and\r\nthat large portions of England and the United States have hardly moved\r\ntoward the establishment of public libraries, may prompt a consideration\r\nof certain objections which are still sometimes urged. Civilization\r\naccepts its most benignant and effective agencies of progress only under\r\nprotest; and it is not, therefore, wholly inexplicable that fifty years\r\nof unmixed and increasing success should have left some excellent and\r\notherwise intelligent people unconvinced of the beneficence of the free\r\npublic library. A friend of mine was enthusiastically setting forth the\r\nadvantages of such libraries, and their rapid multiplication and growing\r\nservice in New England, at the dinner table of one of the most\r\ndistinguished, philosophic, and progressive of contemporary Englishmen;\r\nand was not a little surprised to be cut short with the decided comment,\r\n\"I do not believe in it.\" The Englishman's fastidious preference for\r\nhigh fences and compartment railway carriages pervades all his\r\nintellectual conceptions also; and makes him impervious even to Stanley\r\nJevons's overwhelming demonstration of the moral, social, and economic\r\nutility of the free public library; impervious even to the appeal that\r\nignorance and narrow intellectual opportunity must be supposed to make\r\nupon enlightened philanthropy.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer and the individualists oppose to the public\r\nlibrary, supported by taxation, their wellworn declamation about the\r\ninjustice of making one man pay for another man's culture and amusement;\r\nand urge the dictum of _laissez faire_ in civilization and government.\r\nBut as the post-office and the public school have survived their\r\nonslaughts we may not feel compelled to surrender the advantages of the\r\nfree library. For, as with the school, it is easy to show that mental\r\nhealth and light are as primary interests of the community as material;\r\nand that it is precisely because those most deficient are least sensible\r\nof their defect that society must seek to remedy it. Mr. Spencer's\r\nanalogy between hunger for food and hunger for knowledge is utterly\r\nfallacious. The physical appetite may be trusted to seek vigorously its\r\nown supply; the intellectual appetite has most to be aroused where\r\nintellectual starvation is most imminent; and it grows only by what it\r\nfeeds on. Men usually value most, indeed, what they work or pay for; but\r\nit is precisely those who do not value good books at all who need to be\r\ntempted and trained to their appreciation. And it is just the children\r\nof those whose parents will not, or cannot, provide them wholesome\r\nreading, that society cannot afford to let go wholly unprovided.\r\n\r\nThe smallest fee here proves an effective bar, as the experience of all\r\nsubscription libraries proves. When the Springfield (Mass.) library was\r\nmade free, its circulation was trebled the first year--though the fee\r\nhad been only one dollar--and in a few years rose six or seven fold.\r\n\"The Mercantile Library of Peoria, Ill.,\" says Mr. Crunden, \"turned over\r\nto the city and made free, notes an increase in ten years, of members\r\nfrom two hundred and seventy-five to four thousand five hundred, and of\r\nissues from fifteen thousand to ninety thousand.\" So always. If the\r\ndollar fee were removed from the circulation of the books of our\r\nMeadville City Library, for instance, within five years they would go\r\ninto fifteen hundred families instead of less than three hundred, as\r\nnow; and the added twelve hundred families would be the very ones where\r\nthe books would be of highest service. And, perhaps, more beneficent\r\nstill would be the influence upon the vastly larger number who would\r\nfrequent the library, and grow intelligent through the multiplied use of\r\nits reading facilities, and the help of its valuable reference\r\ndepartment. The reaction upon the general intelligence of the community\r\nwould make itself felt in the increasing intelligence of its working men\r\nand the higher standard of life this would bring among them. In short,\r\nit would insure economic progress.\r\n\r\nBesides the economic advantages, and much more important, the influence\r\nof a well-furnished free library would tell in the training of citizens.\r\nThe discussion of economic and social questions, eager and often bitter\r\nas it is, would become less crude and partisan in the knowledge of the\r\nbest books and magazine articles upon the topics involved. The reading\r\nof history, biography, and travels would exert a broadening,\r\nenlightening, and often inspiring influence. To make wholesome\r\nliterature more accessible than dime novels would save many boys and\r\ngirls from ruin, rouse many dormant intellects to higher life, and\r\nsupply effective rivals to the saloons and other low resorts.\r\nPhilanthropy and religion alike demand the wide opening of such an\r\n\"effectual door\" to the opportunities of the higher life.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes objected that the records of all public libraries show\r\nthat the lightest literature is most read, that fiction constitutes one\r\nhalf or three fourths of the books circulated. But besides the obvious\r\nconsideration that only wholesome fiction finds place in all\r\nwell-appointed public libraries, Horace Greeley's view has much to\r\ncommend it, viz.: that all pure reading, however light, tends to develop\r\na taste for more vigorous and instructive literature. Besides, it may\r\nwell be urged that fiction is not only the current form of literary art,\r\nbut also the effective vehicle of current social theories,\r\nphilanthropies, and reforms; and that much of the most earnest thinking\r\nand serious moral purpose of this age is embodied in it. Under such\r\nintelligent and careful selection as the public opinion of the community\r\nmay provide for, the public library will furnish a healthful substitute\r\nand corrective for the unappointed and vagrant reading of that large\r\nsection of young people most in need of guidance.\r\n\r\nI have left myself but a moment to suggest one or two practical\r\nquestions that may need consideration in the establishment of a new\r\nsystem of free public libraries in communities or a commonwealth. Next\r\nto thorough discussion of their proved beneficence, an efficient\r\nenabling act is certainly the first desideratum, in any state still\r\nwithout it, so that towns and cities may tax themselves for this\r\npurpose. And it is most important that this act be not so narrowly\r\nlimited that communities shall be unable to attempt anything worth\r\nwhile. Better wait five years, or ten years, more for the statute that\r\nwill enable our communities to put themselves in line with the most\r\nadvanced in the country in this respect, than to enact a starveling and\r\nineffective statute that shall\r\n\r\n    \"Keep the word of promise in our ear,\r\n    And break it to our hope,\"\r\n\r\nas has already sometimes happened. The public appropriation is so\r\nlimited by penny-wise legislation in a number of states as to discourage\r\nall action, and kill all interest in the matter.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, it is to be hoped that these states will accompany\r\ntheir enabling acts by auxiliary legislation similar to that in\r\nMassachusetts and New Hampshire; or, perhaps still better, patterned\r\nupon that of New York. It is difficult to decide upon the comparative\r\nadvantages of these two systems. That of Massachusetts seems to me\r\nbetter for permanent results; but that of New York seems likely to be\r\nmore immediately effective in stirring the sluggish interest of\r\nindifferent communities. Both are wonderfully economical in money, and\r\nboth have great effectiveness when worked by the intelligent interest of\r\neven a few enthusiastic friends of the free library movement in any\r\ncommunity. It would seem that even a governor who thinks five million\r\npeople cannot afford $25,000 for the \"Birds of Pennsylvania\" might\r\nconsent to spend a fifth of that sum per year to begin a work that would\r\nnot end, if once well begun, without putting a new and most effective\r\nagency of social culture and even economic progress within the reach of\r\nevery boy and girl in the state.\r\n\r\nThe machinery through which to plan and begin this great and hopeful\r\nexperiment should be carefully considered. Massachusetts's unsalaried\r\ncommission of eminent citizens, New York's Board of University Regents,\r\nalike insure that in those commonwealths the work will be carried on\r\nunder the most hopeful and efficient conditions. Some such unpartisan\r\nand public-spirited agency is absolutely demanded for the success of the\r\nmovement in a state that has to begin it _de novo_; and the _personnel_\r\nof the agency is the most important point in any legislation initiating\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere is also a difference of opinion as to whether school boards, or\r\nboards specially constituted for the purpose, should have charge of\r\npublic libraries. My opinion is decidedly in favor of the latter; for\r\nwhile school boards would bring the library, as is most desirable, into\r\ncloser relation with the public schools, an independent board, chosen,\r\nperhaps, by the school board in connection with the city council, as\r\nsometimes in Massachusetts, would be likely to bring more ability,\r\nindependence, and careful consideration to the affairs of the library,\r\nand to separate it more completely from injurious partisan and personal\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNITY'S SERVICE TO THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n    The Public Library, like the Public School, is the creature\r\n    of the community, which owes it provision for keeping it in\r\n    condition to render the service for which it was created.\r\n    This duty of course, includes adequate financial support but\r\n    does not end here. Among the most important adjuncts to such\r\n    support are the aid that can be given by enlightened public\r\n    opinion and by organized groups in the maintenance of\r\n    liberal and helpful policies, and the appointment of a\r\n    governing board equally conscious of its responsibilities\r\n    and its limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF THE STATE TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\n    This statement of first principles was made by Melvil Dewey\r\n    at the Second International Library Conference, held in\r\n    London, July 13-16, 1897, and is reprinted from the\r\n    Transactions and Proceedings of the Conference (London,\r\n    1898). In reading this address, it must be kept in mind that\r\n    it was made to Englishmen, whose conception of the functions\r\n    of a public library were then, as now, much more\r\n    conservative than ours. A sketch of Dr. Dewey will be found\r\n    in Vol. I. of this series.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been listening to an admirable account of the development of the\r\nlibrary movement from earliest times to the present day, and I venture\r\nto believe that when the history of the age in which we live is written,\r\nand is looked back upon by those who shall come after, it will be known\r\ndistinctively as the \"Library Age.\"\r\n\r\nLibraries of one sort or another have existed from the beginning of\r\nhuman history, and we are now well into the fifth century since the\r\ninvention of printing; so that it would seem as if there had been\r\nabundant time for library development. But so great an institution as\r\nthe modern library is of slow growth. It has taken a thousand years to\r\ndevelop our school system from university down to kindergarten. The\r\npublic library is much more rapidly going through corresponding stages\r\nin order to come to its own. The original library was a reservoir,\r\ngetting in and keeping safely, a storehouse for posterity. That was and\r\nis a great function, for which I have profound respect. Then, after many\r\ncenturies, came another library epoch, for which we all feel still\r\ngreater respect. The cistern was made a fountain; giving out was seen to\r\nbe more important than getting in. The library is no longer merely a\r\npassive receptacle, but becomes an aggressive educational force in every\r\ncommunity. The reservoir will not become a stagnant pool, for, in its\r\nbranches and deliveries, the public library has mains and pipes laid\r\nthrough every street, and reaching almost to the door of every\r\nhouseholder. And we live now not in the age of the reservoir, but in the\r\nage of the fountain. In our zeal and admiration, however, we are apt to\r\nforget that there is yet another and even more important stage to reach.\r\nIn my own city, some time ago, we spent half a million dollars in\r\nproviding an ample supply of water. But we found that we had really\r\nopened convenient communication with the cemetery by water, for the\r\nquality of the new and abundant beverage was such that our death-rate\r\nsteadily rose. The burning question became qualitative, not\r\nquantitative, and we are now spending our money on efficient filtration.\r\nOf course no library intends to circulate injurious books, but equally\r\nno town intends to distribute harmful water. We are concerned more with\r\nthe results than with the intention. The mortality tables make plain the\r\nphysical defect, but alas! science has as yet devised no instruments\r\ndelicate enough to record the greater danger to the individual and the\r\nState from poison in the great current, which has come to be a mighty\r\nflood, of modern reading matter. The most hopeful, and perhaps the only\r\npracticable, method of guarding against this serious danger is through\r\nthe public library, which must now in the last days of this eventful\r\ncentury recognise the gravity of the new responsibility which it cannot\r\nshirk. Before another audience I might dwell at length on what this\r\nproblem of selection means, but the representative librarians of the\r\nworld will understand my claim that, wonderful as was the development\r\nfrom the cistern to the fountain, its importance is overshadowed by this\r\ngreat question of excluding the pernicious, which I sum up in the word\r\nfiltration. This is the great problem of the modern library, and its\r\nsolution must depend largely on the State.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that the modern periodicals and newspapers are our\r\ngreatest danger; but this, of course, is true only of the sensational\r\nand other objectionable types. I yield to none in my high appreciation\r\nof what the best kind of newspaper may do in its capacity as the\r\nstrongest ally of the public library and of the public school. I am\r\nconfident that early in the next century such journals will be\r\nrecognised as a distinct part of our educational machinery, but I am\r\nequally clear that the worst journals, conducted merely as money-making\r\nenterprises, and catering to the worst instead of to the best elements\r\nof both society and individuals, are the most potent factors for evil,\r\nand the greatest enemy which the ideal librarian has to combat in\r\ncarrying forward his best work. They leave their habitual readers with\r\nneither time nor taste for anything above their own low plane. The mind\r\nwill inevitably rise or fall to the level of its habitual reading, and\r\nwe apostles and missionaries of the book have no more disheartening\r\noutlook than on the readers whose literary atmosphere is limited to the\r\nmodern sensational newspapers. But the apologists for such reading say\r\nthat the history of their own times is of more importance to them than\r\nany other history; should they not, therefore, become as familiar as\r\npossible with it? But when a man, on account of \"pressure of business,\"\r\nnever looks inside any good book, yet has time to read everything in the\r\nnewspapers, he is--well, specialising too much in \"history.\" How many\r\nmen and women there are, who, from year's end to year's end, read\r\nnothing but the so-called history of their own times, and who can tell\r\nyou nothing better than which dog won the last fight! It is a good thing\r\nto know the history of our own times; so is a pinch of salt a good thing\r\non one's breakfast potato, but it is not necessary to drink a barrel of\r\nsea water each morning in order to get it.\r\n\r\nIt is highly desirable that I should know the geology and topography of\r\nmy own State, but I can learn all that is worth knowing without creeping\r\non hands and knees with nose close to the ground over the barnyards and\r\ndump heaps of our commonwealth, under the vain delusion that I am\r\nexhaustively studying its geology. We must join this battle squarely.\r\nThe eternal conflict of good and the best with bad and the worst is on.\r\nThe librarian must be the librarian militant before he can be the\r\nlibrarian triumphant. At the end of another century, when a conference\r\nlike this is held, our descendants will look back with wonder to find\r\nthat we have so long been satisfied to leave the control of the\r\nall-pervading, all-influencing newspaper in the hands of people who have\r\nbehind them no motive better than the \"almighty dollar.\" The solution of\r\nour difficulties lies in recognition by the State that public libraries\r\nare not only good things, but that they are an absolutely necessary part\r\nof our educational system. We started with the university, but found\r\nthat we had to put under it the college. Then we went a step further,\r\nand had the academy and high school to prepare for the college; the\r\nprimary and grammar schools to prepare for the high school; and now we\r\nhave the kindergarten under the primary school. I am not giving a\r\nchronology, but simply pointing out that during these centuries\r\neducators have constantly been facing the question of adequate provision\r\nfor meeting completely the public wants. We have at last reached step by\r\nstep from the university to the nursery, and have provided a series of\r\nschools covering the entire field. Yet, with all this, we have not\r\nattained the full system of education that we ought to attain, and every\r\nthoughtful person is now asking, \"What next?\"\r\n\r\nHuxley has well said that a system of education which in the early years\r\ntrains boys and girls to read and then makes no provision for what they\r\nshall read during all the rest of their lives, would be as senseless as\r\nto teach our children the expert use of the knife, fork, and spoon, and\r\nthen make no provision for their daily food. The whole history of\r\neducation has been a series of broadening conceptions. I can recall no\r\ncase in which the ideal has narrowed, but step by step we have come to a\r\ngeneral recognition that education is for poor as well as rich, for\r\nplebeian as well as prince, for black and white, for native and\r\nforeigner, for brilliant or backward, for women as well as men, for\r\ndeaf, dumb, and blind, and all defectives and delinquents, who in the\r\nold conception were left without the pale. It is almost within our\r\nmemory that we have come to substantial agreement that the State owes an\r\nelementary education to every boy and girl born within its limits, not\r\nalone as a right to the child, but as a matter of safety and practical\r\nwisdom on the part of the State; and this broader conception is followed\r\nclosely by a second and still broader one, that every boy and girl is\r\nentitled not only to an elementary, but to something also of higher\r\neducation. I have met no competent student of this subject who dares\r\ndeny that hereafter the State must recognize that education is not alone\r\nfor the young, for limited courses, in schools which take all the time\r\nof their pupils, but that it must regard adults as well; and not alone\r\nfor short courses, but all through life--not in our recognised teaching\r\ninstitutions alone, but in that study outside of office or working hours\r\nthat may be carried on at home. I may sum it up in the one sentence,\r\n\"Higher education, for adults, at home, through life.\"\r\n\r\nIn this home education, which must hereafter be recognised side by side\r\nwith school education, the library is the great central agent round\r\nwhich study clubs, reading circles, extension teaching, museums, and the\r\nother allied agencies must cluster. A statesman solicitous for the\r\nfuture welfare of his country will find his most fruitful field in\r\nprotecting and guiding the reading of the people. It is what a man reads\r\nthat shapes his future, which depends, not at once upon the rostrum and\r\nthe pulpit, but on the book and the newspaper. In education we recognise\r\nthat the supreme end is the building of character, but many of us have\r\nnever thought clearly how directly this character-building rests upon\r\nthe public library. It is reading that begets reflection, reflection\r\nbegets motive, motive begets action, and action begets habit, and habit\r\nbegets character; and who here dares question this, that it is not the\r\nair nor the water, nor yet the \"roast beef of Old England,\" not its\r\nhistory nor traditions nor laws nor geographic location, but\r\n_character_, that has made the Anglo-Saxons, England and her daughters\r\nacross the seas, the most wonderful people of the earth. It is not\r\nbrawn, but brain. The dogs and horses might have the physical qualities,\r\nbut it is the mind and soul, and those elements of true greatness which\r\ncan best be instilled into a people through the reading of good and\r\ngreat books, that have made a race of which we are justly all so proud.\r\nOne of the wisest of Frenchmen said of the Franco-Prussian War, when the\r\nneedle-gun was suggested as the explanation of German victory, \"No; it\r\nwas not the needle-gun, nor the German soldier who held it, nor yet the\r\nGerman schoolmaster who trained the soldier, but it was the German\r\nuniversity that made the schoolmaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowledge is power,\" and it is knowledge that has made England and\r\nAmerica great. Think of the men who read the poorest newspapers, but\r\nknow nothing of our best books. Can the State afford to make other\r\nthings free, and not make free true and useful knowledge as preserved in\r\nbooks? Can the State recognize the necessity for free schools, and fail\r\nto provide free access to the best reading in all realms of knowledge?\r\n\r\n\"Free as air,\" was the old-time strongest expression. Then men learned\r\nhow absolutely essential to physical well-being was abundance of water,\r\nand our language records in its favourite expression, \"free as water,\"\r\nthe meaning of the untold millions that civilization has spent to supply\r\nall people freely with this essential. We are learning the greater\r\nlesson about the necessity of free knowledge more slowly, because\r\nintellectual and spiritual things are not so readily discerned by our\r\nmortal eyes, and it takes more time to read even those messages that God\r\nhas written very large for those who have eyes to see; but the time is\r\nnot far distant, mark my words, when our speech will again record the\r\ngeneral acceptance of a great truth in the common phrase, as \"free as\r\nknowledge.\" We should make the public understand the relation of the\r\nschool system to the library system; that the library is not merely a\r\ncollection of books, or a storehouse, but an aggressive and active\r\nsource of education, side by side with the free schools. If the issue\r\ncame--but, thank God, it never will--between giving up either the\r\nlibrary or the free school, I am not sure that I would not choose for\r\nthe welfare of the country the public library rather than the school.\r\nThis may sound strange from one who has given his life to education, but\r\nI believe that even without our schools nearly every boy and girl would\r\nsomehow learn to read; and when I soberly consider the influence on\r\nlives and characters and on the State, it seems probable that,\r\ninfinitely valuable as is the work of our free schools, it would be\r\nexceeded by what could be done by a system of free public libraries,\r\nreaching every boy and girl and man and woman in the community, and so\r\nadministered as to provide each freely from childhood to the grave with\r\nthe best reading in every field of interest and activity.\r\n\r\nThe State, whatever it may or may not do, should recognise the library\r\nas being as essential to public welfare as is the school, and it should\r\ngive it as careful protection from dangers without and within as it\r\ngives to institutions like banks and insurance companies. The State\r\nshould protect the library against unjust laws, improper interference,\r\nor pernicious influence of any kind from without. It should guard it\r\nalso against misconduct, incapacity, or neglect on the part of its\r\ntrustees, officers, or employees. Beside the direct appropriations for\r\nits support, it should grant the most liberal powers for holding\r\nproperty given by individuals for the public benefit, and, above all,\r\nshould grant entire exemption from taxation. To tax a free public\r\nlibrary for doing its beneficent work is theorising gone mad. It is as\r\nabsurd as for a missionary to refuse admission to his preaching, or for\r\nthe manager of a theatre in which a fire has just started to shut out\r\nevery fireman till he had presented the conventional coupon for a\r\nreserved seat. The example first set by my own State (New York) in the\r\nstatute which I had the honour of drawing ought to be followed\r\nuniversally. We created a public libraries department, to devote its\r\nentire attention to advancing the best interests of public libraries. It\r\nwould take the entire morning to sketch to you the various forms of\r\nbeneficent work which we have found practicable. We help to establish\r\nnew libraries, reorganise old ones, revise methods, select books, lend\r\nsingle books or entire libraries, grant books or money up to $200 yearly\r\nto any library raising an equal sum from local sources, and, by means of\r\ncorrespondence, personal inspection, and steady work in a dozen\r\ndirections, help every community to get the greatest practical good from\r\nthe labour and money given to its free library. We have now about five\r\nhundred travelling libraries moving about in all parts of the State. The\r\npublic library is rapidly becoming universal. For the Government not to\r\nrecognise it in its own organisation is as absurd as it would be to have\r\na standing army and no war department, or schools dotted all about the\r\nstate and no department of education. Time forbids more than the mere\r\nnaming of what is needed, but the first great step in summing up the\r\nrelation of the State to public libraries is the establishment of a\r\npublic libraries department, in charge of a strong man who appreciates\r\nthe almost limitless opportunities for usefulness which this new field\r\naffords.\r\n\r\nOur discussions this morning took such a turn that you could almost\r\nhear behind them, like the recurring motive of one of Wagner's operas,\r\nthe question, \"Who shall be greatest among librarians?\" In our State\r\nLibrary School I give each year a course of five lectures on the\r\nqualifications of a librarian, and point out under a half-hundred\r\ndifferent heads the things we should demand in an ideal librarian; but\r\nwhen we have covered the whole field of scholarship and technical\r\nknowledge and training, we must confess that overshadowing all are the\r\nqualities of the man. To my thinking, a great librarian must have a\r\nclear head, a strong hand, and, above all, a great heart. He must have a\r\nhead as clear as the master in diplomacy; a hand as strong as he who\r\nquells the raging mob, or leads great armies on to victory; and a heart\r\nas great as he who, to save others, will, if need be, lay down his life.\r\nSuch shall be greatest among librarians; and, when I look into the\r\nfuture, I am inclined to think that most of the men who will achieve\r\nthis greatness will be women.\r\n\r\nIt is well to hold up high ideals, but it would be a sad mistake to\r\nunderrate the services of the noble men and women who in some, perhaps\r\nmany, respects fall far short of the standards we lay down, and yet who\r\nhave done, and are doing well, much of the world's best work. Let us\r\ndwell on what has been well done, not on what has been omitted or on\r\nwhat might have been done by other men in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nI remember, some twenty-five years ago, reading in George Eliot's\r\n_Romola_ these words, which we should remember when thinking of any\r\ngreat librarian who of necessity fails in some respects to meet all our\r\nideals: \"It was the fashion of old, when an ox was led out for sacrifice\r\nto Jupiter, to chalk the dark spots and give the offering a false show\r\nof unblemished whiteness. Let us fling away the chalk, and boldly say\r\nthe victim was spotted; but it was not therefore in vain that his mighty\r\nheart was laid on the altar of men's highest hopes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF SECURING THE INTEREST OF A COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n    This paper by Wm. E. Foster, Librarian of the Providence\r\n    Library, appears in the double number of _The Library\r\n    Journal_ for September-October, 1880. Written forty years\r\n    ago it is more advanced from the standpoint of\r\n    socialization, especially as regards group-action, than some\r\n    pronouncements that one might hear to-day. A sketch of Mr.\r\n    Foster appears in Vol. I. of this series.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mainly resolves itself into a consideration of direct and indirect\r\nmethods. The one attempts only to supply the public with what it wants;\r\nthe other, striving after the truest improvement of the readers, in time\r\nsecures, with the growth of intelligent appreciation, an interest even\r\nmore active, and vastly more permanent, than the other. No library may\r\nsafely disregard either class of methods, and their proper adjustment is\r\na point which may very profitably engage much of the librarian's\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the first of these is not likely to escape his\r\nattention. \"What the public wants\" is a consideration which will meet\r\nhim frequently, from one end of the year to the other. No one needs to\r\nbe told, for instance, that the public wants to be amused. Doubtless the\r\nclass of books described as \"humorous\" would constitute, to a large body\r\nof readers in any one of our cities, the true ideal of a collection of\r\nbooks. The taste for imaginative literature begins early and lasts long,\r\nwith a large number of readers. \"Something new\" is a phrase whose\r\nattractiveness is not far from universal. Still further, if it is a\r\nquestion between a \"true account,\" which deals with stirring adventures,\r\nand another \"true account,\" whose pages are devoted to an impassive\r\nstatement of scientific facts, there is not much question which will\r\nfind the most readers among the general public. \"What the public wants,\"\r\nthen, as regards the choice of books, while it certainly does not\r\nindicate a high degree of enlightenment, has perhaps the merit of being\r\ntrue to nature.\r\n\r\nThere are certain points of administration, also, in which the interest\r\nof the public is concerned. It is in favor of having the library as near\r\nits place of residence as possible; and here, unfortunately, \"the\r\npublic\" is a plural personage which cannot all be suited at once. It is\r\nin favor of that method of obtaining the privileges of the library which\r\nrequires the least trouble and inconvenience on its part, and seldom\r\nsees the need of a careful verification of the applicant's identity. It\r\nis in favor of the fewest restrictions on access to the books, and on\r\nthe time for keeping them. It is in favor, decidedly, of that \"charging\r\nsystem\" which will deliver the book soonest. It is in favor of finding\r\nthe library open on all days and at all hours, sometimes even not\r\nregarding the specified hours announced as worthy of consideration. In\r\nshort, while it is by no means difficult to persuade the public of the\r\nreasonableness of a particular restriction, yet its first thought is\r\nundeniably largely influenced by selfish considerations.\r\n\r\nNor is the larger part of the public any more fond of bestowing deep and\r\npainstaking thought upon the books which it reads, and of carrying the\r\nmind systematically through a complicated mental process. It is not\r\nimprobable that some readers would be glad of some method of using books\r\nwhich should save them the trouble of any mental process. And, while\r\nthese readers are so much averse to any troublesome efforts toward\r\nimprovement on their own part, it would be scarcely reasonable to look\r\nfor any very intelligent supervision by them of the reading of their\r\nchildren, or of the pupils in the schools. Here, again, what the public\r\nwants is \"the royal road\"--some \"short and easy method.\"\r\n\r\nThat library, then, which would awaken and develop a lively interest\r\namong its readers in the miscellaneous public, cannot certainly complain\r\nof a lack of methods by which to secure such interest. It may include in\r\nits selection of books a suitable percentage of fiction, and humorous\r\nworks. It may infuse \"new blood\" into the library by frequent and\r\nregular purchase of the latest publications. It may add largely to the\r\ndepartment of voyages and travels, of books copiously illustrated,--of\r\npopular literature, in short. It may place its main building in the\r\ncenter of population, and establish branches for the accommodation of\r\noutlying localities. It may recognize the desirableness of \"the least\r\nred tape\" in registering readers, of open book-shelves, of expeditious\r\nserving of readers, and long periods of time for the use of the library\r\nand the retention of books. It may furnish its readers with explanations\r\nand directions for obtaining and using the books which shall require the\r\nleast difficulty in understanding and applying them. It may, and it\r\nshould, recognize the value of all these principles, and the library\r\nwhich fails to act on them does so at its peril. Yet these points do not\r\ncomprise all that demand attention; and the effectiveness of even these\r\nis due to the limits which are set to them. A certain amount of fiction\r\nis well enough, but to enlarge this department at the expense of all\r\nothers would clearly defeat the library's purpose. Diminution of\r\nrestrictions in the use of books is certainly agreeable to the public,\r\nbut the removal of all restrictions would result in such a loss of books\r\nas would soon work its own cure.\r\n\r\nThe question, \"What does the public want?\" is not the only, nor, in\r\nfact, the chief question to be borne in mind in the conduct of a\r\nlibrary. One has only to keep his eyes open to see how suggestive as to\r\nmethods is this other question: \"Of what service may the library be?\"\r\nAnd it is safe to say that one who has not given the subject attention\r\nwill be surprised to find at how many points a collection of books, and\r\nthe thought there contained, touch human life. Here is a machine-shop\r\nwith its hundred or more workmen, many of whom are anxious to study some\r\nmechanical work. The library has such works, and is glad to supply them.\r\nHere again is a society of natural history, whose members are\r\nsystematically studying some department of natural science. To them,\r\nalso, the library willingly offers its resources in that department.\r\nWith no less willingness it offers its cooperation to those who are\r\nfollowing a course of public lectures on some topic of political science\r\nor of art, to a college class studying topically some epoch of history\r\nor period of literature; or to a public-school teacher, with a class in\r\ngeography; or a parent desiring some suitable reading for a child. Or,\r\nwith no specified class of persons in view, it seeks to make its\r\ncollection generally available, by regular references to its resources\r\non matters of current and universal interest.\r\n\r\nMuch more effective, however, than the best of such attempts at reaching\r\nclasses of readers will be the aid rendered to individual readers. Not\r\ngeneral and indefinite, but specific and direct assistance, is here\r\ngiven, and, although at first this kind of work might seem to be\r\nimpracticable in a large library, yet one who tries it will be\r\ninterested to see how far such individual methods may be introduced. The\r\nlibrarian almost mechanically learns \"to pigeon-hole\" in his mind the\r\npeculiar tastes and lines of reading of single readers, and, when the\r\noccasion presents itself, can bring to their notice books and articles\r\nwhich they are glad to obtain. More than one librarian makes it a\r\nregular practice, in adding new books to the library or in collecting\r\nmaterial bearing upon some one topic, to drop a postal to this and that\r\nreader who, he knows, will be glad of just this information. The more\r\nthe conducting of a library can be made an individual matter, bringing\r\nparticular books to the notice of particular readers, the more effective\r\nit becomes.\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider what may be called the \"general effect\" of such\r\nindividual efforts, continued from one year to another. They will\r\ncertainly result in giving the public a large amount of assistance.\r\nBeing exerted in connection with the whole community, they cannot fail\r\nto leave an influence, like the school, the church, or the\r\nnewspaper,--an influence moreover, which, if wisely directed, and\r\nintelligently shaped, will make the public library idea appreciably felt\r\nin the civilization of the country.\r\n\r\nNor can it fail to have a reflex influence in securing the interest of\r\nthe public. If methods of the former class were able, by their direct\r\nagency, to accomplish practical results, even more significant and more\r\npermanent are those reached indirectly by this method. No class of\r\npeople will be so truly attached to the institution, by active interest,\r\nas those who feel that they have been personally aided and improved\r\nthrough its agency. The former methods are directly adapted to secure\r\npopularity, the latter to win gratitude; and if it should ever become\r\nnecessary to choose one of these, at the expense of the other, there can\r\nbe little room for hesitation. The growth of public sentiment in\r\ncommunities like Boston and Worcester, where public libraries have been\r\nadministered on these principles, and with these ends in view, for a\r\nseries of years, is very instructive. Public sentiment, like confidence,\r\nis \"a plant of slow growth\"; but experience shows that when the\r\nconviction has once thoroughly penetrated a community that an\r\ninstitution like this is sincerely aiming to serve the public, a hold on\r\nits sympathy and interest has been acquired not easily to be shaken. It\r\nshould be the aim of each librarian to make the usefulness of his\r\ninstitution so manifest that the public will as soon think of dispensing\r\nwith the post-office as with the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT\r\n\r\n    The justification for taxing the members of a community to\r\n    support a Public Library, although rarely questioned to-day\r\n    was argued with heat in former times. Earlier, there was the\r\n    same difference of opinion with regard to the public\r\n    schools. In order to obtain the argument in opposition, in\r\n    its best form, we have had to draw from a British source,\r\n    which we consider it proper to quote here because it\r\n    elicited a reply from an American librarian which will\r\n    immediately follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE LIBRARIES\r\n\r\n(AN ARGUMENT AGAINST PUBLIC SUPPORT)\r\n\r\n    This paper, by M.D. O'Brien, forms Chapter IX of the\r\n    compilation of essays entitled \"A Plea for Liberty\" edited\r\n    by Thomas Mackay (3rd ed. London, 1894). The sub-title of\r\n    the book, \"an argument against socialism and socialistic\r\n    legislation,\" gives its viewpoint. There is a formidable\r\n    introduction by Herbert Spencer in which he condemns even\r\n    the extremely limited state support given at that time to\r\n    general education in England as a \"tyrannical system tamely\r\n    submitted to by people who fancy themselves free.\" Mr.\r\n    Spencer ends by asserting that the end, if this sort of\r\n    thing is to go on, \"must be a society like that of ancient\r\n    Peru, dreadful to contemplate, in which the mass of the\r\n    people, elaborately regimented in groups, ... were\r\n    superintended in their private lives as well as in their\r\n    industries and toiled hopelessly for the support of the\r\n    governmental organization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Free Library may be defined as the socialists' continuation school.\r\nWhile State education is manufacturing readers for books,\r\nState-supported libraries are providing books for readers. The two\r\nfunctions are logically related. If you may take your education out of\r\nyour neighbour's earnings, surely you may get your literature in the\r\nsame manner. Literary dependency has the same justification as\r\neducational dependency; and, no doubt, habituation to the one helps to\r\ndevelop a strong desire for the other. A portion of our population has\r\nby legislation acquired the right to supply itself with necessaries and\r\nluxuries at the cost of the rates. The art of earning such things for\r\nthemselves has been rendered superfluous. Progress therefore halts\r\nbecause this all-important instinct has fallen into disuse. At a point\r\nthe rates will bear no more, and those who depend on them for their\r\npleasures are doomed to disappointment. The identity of principle\r\nexemplified alike by compulsory education and compulsory libraries,\r\nlogically involves the justification or condemnation of both; and, let\r\nus disguise the unpleasant truth in as many sounding phrases as we\r\nplease, the fact remains that the carrying out of this socialistic\r\nprinciple means pauperism pure and simple. Have we forgotten the evils\r\nthat resulted from the application of this principle under the old poor\r\nlaw? or do we imagine that when an evil changes its outward appearance\r\nit changes its inner essence also? The harm done to the national\r\ncharacter by a policy of this nature varies in intensity in proportion\r\nto the necessity of the want supplied. If the thing supplied at public\r\ncost is really necessary and eagerly accepted by the people, it becomes\r\nmore readily a potent cause of dependency, and a heavy and at length an\r\ninsupportable charge on the ratepayers. This was the experience of the\r\nold poor law. The cost of national education is fast approaching to the\r\nsame state of things, and the problem will one day have to be faced:\r\n'How is the burden of the cost of education to be returned to the\r\nshoulders of those who are responsible for it?' In this paper we are\r\nconcerned with a smaller question. A very inconsiderable section of the\r\npeople really want the Free Library; the question at the polls is\r\ngenerally treated with apathy, and only a very small proportion of the\r\nratepayers record their votes one way or the other. As a matter of fact\r\nthe Free Library is forced upon the public by a number of doctrinaire\r\nbelievers in the superhuman value of a mere literary education. It is\r\nnot a popular want. The vast majority of people have still a greater\r\nfaith in the training which results from practical contact with the real\r\nfacts of life, and still only regard book-learning as a useful\r\nsupplement, easily obtainable by those who really desire it and are\r\nlikely to profit by it.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Education Acts is very analogous. The literary\r\nclasses became alarmed at the ignorance of the poor, and instead of\r\nallowing the efforts of philanthropists, aided by the growing\r\nappreciation of education amongst the labouring class--already giving\r\ngreat promise of providing a true and voluntary remedy for the supposed\r\nevil--to work out a system of education on natural and healthy lines of\r\nspontaneous evolution, a course which would have added dignity and\r\nstability to the domestic life of the parents and given a real and\r\ntechnical system of education to the children--instead of this, the\r\nhasty politician rushed forward crying. 'The people do not want\r\neducation, so we must compel them.' The compulsory and demoralizing\r\ncharacter of the means reacts on the otherwise advantageous nature of\r\nthe end, and the result is a mind-destroying system of cram for the\r\nchildren; summons, fines, and police for the parents. This is how the\r\npolitician makes education a lovely and desirable thing. It is almost\r\nimpossible to over-estimate the evils resulting from the State not\r\nallowing teachers and parents to adjust the educational arrangements so\r\nas to meet the felt requirements of the case. This communal despotism\r\nstrikes at the very foundation of personal virtue, viz. the home, the\r\ninstrument by which nature lifts human character above the non-moral\r\nsensuousness of the animal world. Let us never forget that the human\r\nmind is made up of lower and higher elements, and that the removal of\r\npersonal duties--the practice-ground of the virtues--favours the\r\ndevelopment of the lower factors of character at the expense of the\r\nhigher, of weeds at the expense of flowers.\r\n\r\nWhat else can possibly result from the carrying out of a principle which\r\nmeans the public feeding, clothing, and lodging of children under\r\nofficial superintendence and control? Will it be contended that State\r\nofficers can know better than parents what is really needed for\r\nchildren? Yet this is what our Free Educationalists are leading us to.\r\nThe system which robs the parent of one of the noblest motives to\r\neffort--the desire to give a good education to his children--which\r\nweakens the sense of duty and takes away a wholesome stimulus to the\r\nmental and moral faculties, is only the beginning of an evil that\r\nmenaces civilization and threatens to swallow up all natural\r\ndistinctions and relationships in a low and promiscuous communism. This\r\nbribe of parental irresponsibility--this patent method of shirking\r\nduties--which the politician offers us in exchange for our manhood, is a\r\nscheme for encouraging the race to cast itself forth into the moral\r\ndarkness of a world where the parents are all childless and the children\r\nall orphans.\r\n\r\nThe Free Library, however, has not yet reached the same degree of\r\ncompulsion as the Free School. A majority of the local public must vote\r\nfor it before it can be established; or rather, we should say, there\r\nmust be a majority favourable to it amongst _those who do take the\r\ntrouble to record their votes_: usually only a very small proportion of\r\nthe electorate think it worth while to cross the street in order to pay\r\na visit to the poll. When the Library is established, its real\r\npopularity is to be measured by the fact that its books are borrowed by\r\nonly about one per cent. of the population. We make bold to say that if\r\nit ever becomes popular, it will be an extremely mischievous\r\ninstitution. As yet it is merely a plaything for a number of\r\nwell-meaning busybodies, and an occasional convenience to a few\r\nmiddle-class readers. The limited amount generally spent upon it\r\nprevents it from doing anything more than minister to the sensational\r\nindulgences of a very limited section of the reading public. If the\r\nworking classes of the country ever really become students, it will be\r\nimpossible to supply them with adequate store of books from the rates:\r\nif this is attempted, it can only be at a time when books will be but a\r\nsmall item in the expenditure which a dominant State Socialism seeks to\r\nlay on the public purse. On the one hand will stand a class whose only\r\nplan for satisfying their wants is the imposition of a new tax, and on\r\nthe other a harried remnant of ratepayers, both soon to be overwhelmed\r\nby the near approach of national bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nWant is the spring of human effort. Self-discipline, self-control,\r\nself-reliance, are the habits which grow in men who are allowed to act\r\nfor themselves. The meddlesome forestalling of individual effort, which\r\nis being carried into mischievous excess, is going far to bind our\r\npoorer classes for another century of dependence.\r\n\r\nLet us run, as rapidly as possible, through a few of the pleas set up\r\nby the advocates of this form of municipal socialism. Good books, it is\r\nsaid, are out of the reach of the working man. Whether this is true as\r\nregards books we shall see, but obviously it would be easy to make out a\r\nmuch stronger case for many other forms of amusement which are far more\r\npopular with the million than books; yet no one seriously proposes that\r\nthe amusements of the poorer classes can _all_ be supported by the\r\nrates. But a glance down the lists of some of our publishers will show\r\nany one that the statement is not true--is the very reverse of truth.\r\nWhen books like 'Pilgrim's Progress,' 'The Vicar of Wakefield,'\r\n'Rasselas,' 'Paul and Virginia,' Byron's 'Childe Harold,' 'Lady of the\r\nLake,' 'Marmion,' and others, can be purchased from Messrs. Dicks at\r\ntwopence each; when all Scott's novels can be obtained from the same\r\npublishers for threepence per story; when, from the same source, any of\r\nShakespere's plays can be got for a penny each, it will not do to say\r\nthat the best kind of literature is unpurchasable by a class that spends\r\nmillions a year on alcohol, as well as thousands on tobacco and other\r\nluxuries. Three or four pence, which even comparatively poor people\r\nthink nothing now-a-days of spending on an ounce of tobacco or a pipe,\r\nwill buy enough of the best literature to last an ordinary reader at\r\nleast a week or a fortnight. And when the book is read, there is the\r\npleasure to be derived from lending or giving it to a friend, and of\r\naccepting the loan or gift of his in return; a custom that largely\r\nobtains in country districts where no socialistic collection of unjustly\r\ngotten books exists to hinder the development of personal thrift or\r\npoison the springs of spontaneous generosity. Lying on the table where\r\nthis is written is a list of the works published in Cassell's National\r\nLibrary. How some of the old book-lovers who are gone--who lived in the\r\ndays when the purchase of a good book involved some personal\r\nsacrifice--would have appreciated this valuable library! Here are 208 of\r\nthe world's best books, each one of which contains some 200 pages of\r\nclear readable type. The published price is threepence each; but a\r\ndiscount of twenty-five per cent. is allowed when four or five or more\r\nare purchased. It would be a waste of space to give the entire list; but\r\na few typical examples may be taken. Here are the Essays of Lord\r\nMacaulay; here are works by Plutarch, Herodotus, Plato, Xenophon,\r\nLucian, Fenelon, Voltaire, Boccaccio, Gothe, and Lessing--in English, of\r\ncourse. Here is Walton's 'Complete Angler,' Goldsmith's 'Plays,' Bacon's\r\n'Wisdom of the Ancients' and 'Essays.' Here are works by Burke, Swift,\r\nSteele and Addison, Milton, Johnson, Pope, Sydney Smith, Coleridge,\r\nDickens, Landor, Fielding, Keats, Shelley, Defoe, Dryden, Carlyle,\r\nLocke, Bolingbroke, Shakespere, and many others. All Shakespere's plays\r\nare here complete, and each play is accompanied by the poem, story, or\r\nprevious play on which it is founded. Here, for example, is the last of\r\nthe series as yet published, 'All's Well that Ends Well'; it contains a\r\ntranslation of the story of Giletta of Narbona from Painter's 'Palace of\r\nPleasure'; it is worth threepence to a student, if only for showing the\r\ndifference between raw material and finished product. Hundreds of new\r\nnovels, including some of those of Thackeray, Kingsley, Dickens, Lytton,\r\nand other well-known authors, are to be obtained in most places for\r\n4-1/2_d._, and their secondhand price is less still. Considering the\r\nmarvellous cheapness of good books, it is difficult to understand how\r\nany one can either blackmail his neighbour for them, or encourage\r\nworking-men to do so. If a man will not deduct a few coppers now and\r\nthen from his outlay in other luxuries to purchase literature, he cannot\r\nwant literature very badly; if he does not value books sufficiently well\r\nto buy them with his own earnings he does not deserve to have them\r\nbought for him with other people's earnings. That poor women and others,\r\nwho are often the sole support of a large family of children, should\r\nhave their hard earnings confiscated to maintain readers--many of them\r\nwell-to-do--in gratuitous literature, is an injustice not to be\r\npalliated by all the hollow cant about culture and education so freely\r\nindulged in at the present time. Some time ago there was a discussion on\r\n'the sacrifice of education to examination.' There is another question\r\nquite as serious--the sacrifice of justice to so-called education.\r\n\r\nLet us next consider the educational value of this institution.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary for us to say that we have no objection, either\r\nfor ourselves or for our neighbours, to novel-reading. On the contrary,\r\nwe regard it as a legitimate form of recreation. All we argue is that it\r\nis not a luxury which should be paid for out of the rates. Now, to\r\nlisten to the advocates of Free Libraries one would imagine that these\r\ninstitutions were only frequented by students, and that the books\r\nborrowed were for the most part of a profound and scholarly character.\r\nBut the very reverse of this is the case. The committee of the Blackpool\r\nFree Library, in their Report for the year 1887-8, say:--'Works of\r\nfiction and light literature enjoy the greatest degree of popularity,\r\neach book circulating eleven times in the year, while _the more\r\ninstructive books in the other classes circulate only once during the\r\nsame period_.' According to this Report, out of a total average daily\r\nissue of 150 volumes, 137 are works of fiction and light literature. The\r\naverage issue of history, which is the next largest item, is only 9 per\r\ndiem.\r\n\r\nNo wonder is it, after such results as this, that the Committee should\r\nexpress the opinion 'that the rich stores of biography, history,\r\ntravels, and works of science and art which have been added in recent\r\nyears are deserving of greater attention than has hitherto been given to\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\nAlthough the nominal and frequently exceeded limit is now one penny in\r\nthe pound, there is no knowing how soon it may be raised. Already one of\r\nthe members of the Library Association of the United Kingdom, a body\r\ncomposed to a considerable extent of librarians whose bureaucratic\r\ninstincts naturally impel them to push their business by all possible\r\nmeans, has awarded a prize of ten guineas for a draft Library Bill,\r\nwhich, among other things, permits a twopenny instead of a penny rate.\r\n'But,' says the _Daily News_ of Oct. 4th, 1889, 'the feeling appeared to\r\nbe unanimous that it would be _unwise_ to put this forward as a part of\r\nthe Association's programme, as it would enormously increase the\r\nopposition to the adoption of the Act in new localities.' No regard for\r\nthe ratepayers' pockets holds them back; but only a fear of injuring\r\nbusiness by frightening the bird whose feathers are to be plucked. Were\r\nit not for this the Bill would be pushed forward, and those ratepayers\r\nwho have voted for the adoption of the Act in the belief that no more\r\nthan one penny can be levied, would have the rate suddenly doubled over\r\ntheir heads without knowing it. Perhaps, after all, it would serve them\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe intervention of this Association in the conduct of the agitation for\r\nFree Libraries is instructive, and points to the fact that if we admit\r\nthe principle that the wants of the poorer classes generally are to be\r\nsupplied from the rates, it is not the poorer classes themselves who are\r\nallowed to say what form the gift shall take. On the contrary the law is\r\nmanipulated by a number of amiable enthusiasts who succeed in foisting\r\ntheir own fad on the public charges. If the working classes were allowed\r\nto choose the application of _1d._ or _2d._ in the pound it would not go\r\nto Free Libraries.\r\n\r\nThe enormous amount of light reading indulged in by the frequenters of\r\nFree Libraries leads us to expect that these places are largely used by\r\nwell-to-do and other idlers. And this is exactly what we find. Free\r\nLibraries are perfect 'god-sends' to the town loafer, who finds himself\r\nhoused and amused at the public expense, and may lounge away his time\r\namong the intellectual luxuries which his neighbours are taxed to\r\nprovide for him. Says Mr. Mullins, the Birmingham librarian, 'No\r\ndelicacy seemed to deter the poor tramp from using, not only the\r\nnews-room, but the best seats in the reference library _for a snooze_.\r\nAlready the Committee had to complain of the use of the room for\r\n_betting_, and for the transaction of various businesses, and the\r\nexhibition of samples, writing out of orders, and other pursuits more\r\nsuited to the commercial room of an hotel.' And referring to another\r\nFree Library, the same authority continues:--'In the Picton Room of the\r\nLiverpool Library, alcoves were once provided with small tables, on\r\nwhich were pens, ink, &c., but it was found that pupils were received in\r\nthem by tutors, and much private letter-writing was done therein; so\r\nthat when a respectable thief took away L20 worth of books they were\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nAfter the nonsense usually indulged in by the officials of literary\r\npauperism such candour as this is positively refreshing. It is seldom\r\nthe high priest allows us to look behind the curtain in this fashion. As\r\na rule, the admission is much less direct, and can only be gathered from\r\na careful analysis of the statistics. According to the Bristol Report\r\nfor last year, there were 416,418 borrowers during the twelve months\r\npreceding December 31, 1889: of these 148,992 are described as having\r\n'no occupation.' The Report of the Atkinson Free Library of Southport\r\ninforms us that out of the 1283 new borrowers who joined the library\r\nlast year, 536 are written down as of 'no occupation.' At the same town,\r\nin the years 1887-8, there were 641 who, according to the report, were\r\nwithout any occupation, out of a total of 1481. According to the annual\r\nReport of the Leamington Free Public Library for 1888-9, 187 made a\r\nreturn 'no occupation,' out of a total of 282 applicants. In the\r\nYarmouth Report for the same year, out of a total of 3085 new borrowers,\r\n1044 are described as of 'no occupation'; the report for the previous\r\nyear states the proportion as follows:--Total of borrowers, 2813; 'no\r\noccupation,' 1078; in the year before that the total was--3401; 'no\r\noccupation,' 1368.\r\n\r\nSome reports give a fuller analysis of the different classes of people\r\nwho use the libraries to which they refer. In the Wigan Report for last\r\nyear we are told that 13,336 people made use of the reference library in\r\nthat town during 1888-9. The largest items of this amount are given as\r\nfollows:--Solicitors, 1214; clergy, 903; clerks and book-keepers, 1521;\r\ncolliers, 961; schoolmasters and teachers, 801; architects and\r\nsurveyors, 418; engineers, 490; enginemen, 438. At Newcastle-on-Tyne,\r\nlast year, there were 11,620 persons used the reference library, and\r\nonly 3949 of these were of 'no occupation.' Yet, notwithstanding the\r\nnumerical weakness of the latter, they managed to consult nearly half\r\nthe books that were consulted during that year. The total number\r\nconsulted was 36,100; and 16,800 were used by people who had 'no\r\noccupation.' And this is legislation for the Working Classes!\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that at least forty-nine out of every fifty\r\nworking-men have no interest whatever in these institutions. For one\r\npenny they can buy their favourite newspaper, which can be carried in\r\nthe pocket and read at any time; whereas if they wanted to see a paper\r\nat a Free Library they would generally have to wait half an hour or an\r\nhour in a stuffy room, without being allowed to speak during the time.\r\nThe following sensible remarks are from the pen of one who has risen to\r\nan honourable position from a very humble beginning without the aid of\r\neither Free Libraries or Free Schools:--\r\n\r\n    Not long ago a conference of working men was held at Salford\r\n    to consider the question of rational amusement, when, in\r\n    reply to a series of questions, it was stated that Free\r\n    Libraries were not the places for poor, hard-working men,\r\n    who had social wants which such libraries could not gratify.\r\n    It was argued that people who went to work from six in the\r\n    morning till six at night did not want to travel a mile or\r\n    so to a Free Library. Music, gymnastics, smoking and\r\n    conversation rooms, and other things were suggested, but in\r\n    summing up the majority of replies, it appeared that\r\n    amusement rather than intellectual improvement, or even\r\n    reading, was what was most wanted by men after a hard day's\r\n    toil. This appears to have been realised in the erection,\r\n    according to Mr. Besant's conception, of the Palace of\r\n    Delight in the east end of London.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that a Free Library favours one special section of the\r\ncommunity--the book-readers--at the expense of all the rest. The\r\ninjustice of such an institution is conspicuously apparent when it is\r\nremembered that temperaments and tastes are as various as faces. If one\r\nman may have his hobby paid for by his neighbours, why not all? Are\r\ntheatre-goers, lovers of cricket, bicyclists, amateurs of music, and\r\nothers to have their earnings confiscated, and their capacities for\r\nindulging in their own special hobbies curtailed, merely to satisfy\r\ngluttons of gratuitous novel-reading? A love of books is a great source\r\nof pleasure to many, but it is a crazy fancy to suppose that it should\r\nbe so to all. If logic had anything to do with the matter we might\r\nexpect to hear proposals for compelling the attendance of working men at\r\nthe Free Library. But surely in this nineteenth century men might be\r\ntrusted to choose their own amusements, and might mutually refrain from\r\ncharging the cost thereof to their neighbours' account. This pandering\r\nto selfishness is bad for all parties, and doubly so to the class it is\r\nspecially intended to benefit.\r\n\r\nThe following imaginary dialogue will perhaps serve to show the inherent\r\ninjustice of literary socialism.\r\n\r\n_A_ and _B_ earn _1s._ each by carrying luggage. Says _A_ to _B_: 'I am\r\nin favour of circulating books by means of a subscription library; from\r\nthis _1s._ I therefore propose to deduct _1d._ in order to compass my\r\ndesire. There is my friend _C_, who is of the same opinion as myself,\r\nand he is willing to subscribe his quota to the scheme. We hope you will\r\nbe willing to subscribe your mite, but if not, we intend to force you to\r\ndo so, for, as you know, all private interests must give way to the\r\npublic good.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps so,' replies _B_,'but then, you see, I have my own opinions on\r\nthe subject, and I do not believe that your method of supplying\r\nliterature is the best method. Of course I may be wrong, but then I am\r\nlogically entitled to the same freedom of thought and action as you\r\nyourself are. If you are entitled to have your views about a \"Free\"\r\nLibrary and to act upon them, I am equally entitled to the same liberty,\r\nso long as I don't interfere with you. I don't compel you to pay for my\r\nchurch, my theatre, or my club; why should you compel me to pay for your\r\nlibrary? For my own part I don't want other people to keep me in\r\nliterature, and I don't want to keep other people. I refuse therefore to\r\npay the subscription.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' rejoins _A_, 'if that is the case I shall proceed to make\r\nyou pay; and as I happen to represent a numerical majority the task will\r\nbe an easy one.'\r\n\r\n'But are we not man and man,' says _B_,'and have not I the same right to\r\nspend my earnings in my own way as you have to spend yours in your way?\r\nWhy should I be compelled to spend as you spend? Don't you see that you\r\nare claiming more for yourself than you are allowing to me, and are\r\nsupplementing your own liberty by robbing me of mine? Is this the way\r\nyou promote the public good? Is this your boasted free library? I tell\r\nyou it is founded upon theft and upon the violation of the most sacred\r\nthing in this world--the liberty of your fellow man. It is the\r\nembodiment of a gross injustice, and only realises the selfish purpose\r\nof a cowardly and dishonest majority.'\r\n\r\n'We have heard all this before,' replies _A_, 'but such considerations\r\nmust all give way before the public good. We are stronger than you are,\r\nand we have decided once and for all that you shall pay for a \"Free\"\r\nLibrary; don't make unnecessary resistance, or we shall have to proceed\r\nto extremities.'\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, the so-called Free Library is not really free--only so\r\nin name. If the penny or twopenny rate gave even the shabbiest\r\naccommodation to anything like a fair proportion of its compulsory\r\nsubscribers, there would not be standing room, and the ordinary\r\nsubscription libraries would disappear. According to Mr. Thos.\r\nGreenwood, who in his book on 'Free Libraries' has given a table of the\r\ndaily average number of visitors at the different Free Libraries\r\ndistributed up and down the country, there is only one per cent., on an\r\naverage, of visitors per day of the population of the town to which the\r\nlibrary belongs accommodated for a rate of one penny in the\r\npound,--sometimes more, sometimes less;--but the general proportion is\r\nabout one per cent. Now what do these facts mean? If it costs one penny\r\nin the pound to acommodate so few, what would it cost for a fair\r\nproportion to receive anything like a share that would be worth having?\r\nEven now it is a frequent occurrence for a reader to wait for months\r\nbefore he can get the novel he wants. Says Mr. George Easter, the\r\nNorwich librarian:--'Novels most read are those by Ainsworth,\r\n_Ballantyne_, _Besant_, _Braddon_, _Collins_, _Craik_, Dickens, Fenn,\r\nGrant, _Haggard_, _Henty_, _C. Kingsley_, _Kingston_, _Edna Lyall_,\r\nMacdonald, Marryat, Oliphant, Payn, Reade, Reid, Verne, Warner, _Wood_,\r\n_Worboise_, and _Young_; of those underlined (in italics) the works are\r\nnearly always out.' The fact is, the Free Library means that the many\r\nshall work and pay and the few lounge and enjoy; theoretically it is\r\nfree to all, but practically it can only be used by a few.\r\n\r\nWhile there is such a run on novels, solid works are at a discount. At\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne during 1880-81 we find that 2100 volumes of Miss\r\nBraddon's novels were issued (of course some would be issued many times\r\nover, as the whole set comprised only thirty-six volumes), while Bain's\r\n'Mental and Moral Science' was lent out only twelve times in the year.\r\nThere were 1320 volumes issued of Grant's novels, and fifteen issues of\r\nButler's 'Analogy of Religion'; 4056 volumes of Lever's novels were\r\nissued, while Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason' circulated four times;\r\n4901 volumes of Lytton's novels were issued, while Locke 'On the\r\nUnderstanding' went eight times. Mill's 'Logic' stands at fourteen\r\nissues as against Scott's novels, 3300; Spencer's 'Synthetic Philosophy'\r\n(8 vols.) had forty-three issues of separate volumes; Dickens' novels\r\nhad 6810; Macaulay's 'History of England' (10 vols.) had sixty-four\r\nissues of separate volumes. Ouida's novels had 1020; Darwin's 'Origin of\r\nSpecies' (2 vols.) had thirty-six issues; Wood's novels, 1481. Mill's\r\n'Political Economy' had eleven issues; Worboise's novels, 1964. Smith's\r\n'Wealth of Nations' (2 vols.) had fourteen issues; Collins' novels,\r\n1368.\r\n\r\n'No worse than in other libraries,' it may be said; 'knowledge is at a\r\ndiscount: sensation at a premium everywhere!' Perfectly true; but are\r\npeople to be taxed to give facilities for this? Novel reading in\r\nmoderation is good: the endowment of novel reading by the rates is\r\nbad--that is our contention. And when it is remembered that any book\r\nrequiring serious study cannot be galloped through, like a novel, in the\r\nweek or fourteen days allowed for use, it becomes at once evident that\r\nthis gratuitous lending system is only adapted for the circulation of\r\nsensation, and not for the acquirement of real knowledge. And this is\r\nthe sort of thing people allow themselves to be rated and taxed for!\r\nThis is progressive legislation, and its opponents are backward and\r\nilliberal!\r\n\r\nFree Libraries are typical examples of the compulsory cooperation\r\neverywhere gaining ground in this country. Like all State socialism they\r\nare the negation of that liberty which is the goal of human progress.\r\nEvery successful opposition to them is therefore a stroke for human\r\nadvancement. This mendacious appeal to the numerical majority to force a\r\ndemoralising and pauperising institution upon the minority, is an\r\nattempt to revive, in municipal legislation, a form of coercion we have\r\noutgrown in religious matters. At the present time there is a majority\r\nof Protestants in this country who, if they wished, could use their\r\nnumerical strength to compel forced subscription from a minority of\r\nCatholics, for the support of those religious institutions which are\r\nregarded by their advocates as of quite equal importance to a Free\r\nLibrary. Yet this is not done; and why? Because in matters of religion\r\nwe have learnt that liberty is better than force. In political and\r\nsocial questions this terrible lesson has yet to be learned. We deceive\r\nourselves when we imagine that the struggle for personal liberty is\r\nover--probably the fiercest part has yet to arise. The tyranny of the\r\nfew over the many is past, that of the many over the few is to come. The\r\ntemptation for power--whether of one man or a million men--to take the\r\nshort cut, and attempt by recourse to a forcing process to produce that\r\nwhich can only come as the result of the slow and steady growth of ages\r\nof free action, is so great that probably centuries will elapse before\r\nexperience will have made men proof against it. But, however long the\r\nconflict, the ultimate issue cannot be doubted. That indispensable\r\ncondition of all human progress--liberty--cannot be permanently\r\nsuppressed by the arbitrary dictates of majorities, however potent. When\r\nthe socialistic legislation of to-day has been tried, it will be found,\r\nin the bitter experience of the future, that for a few temporary, often\r\nimaginary, advantages we have sacrificed that personal freedom and\r\ninitiative without which even the longest life is but a stale and empty\r\nmockery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARGUMENTS FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES\r\n\r\n    A rejoinder to the preceding paper was made by William E.\r\n    Foster, of the Providence Public Library, before the\r\n    American Library Association at its conference held in San\r\n    Francisco, Cal., in 1891. It may be considered as giving the\r\n    normal American view as contrasted with the\r\n    ultra-conservative attitude of Mr. O'Brien. A sketch of Mr.\r\n    Foster appears in Vol. I. of this series.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rise of the public library system both in this country and Great\r\nBritain, during the past half-century, has been almost coincident with\r\nthe very noteworthy reexamination of every phase of social economy now\r\nso powerfully influencing the thought of the world. In this discussion\r\nthe contributions of Kaufmann, of Fawcett, of Graham, of Jevons, and\r\nabove all, of Herbert Spencer, have been more than influential--they\r\nhave been almost epoch-making--and whatever view one may hold in regard\r\nto the social question, in its various phases, one cannot fail to\r\nacknowledge the deep debt which we owe to these profound thinkers.\r\n\r\nNo book, from Mr. Spencer's point of view, which has appeared within\r\nrecent years, is worthy of a wider reading than the volume entitled \"A\r\nplea for liberty; an argument against socialism and socialistic\r\nlegislation,\" which appeared about the beginning of the present year. In\r\nit thirteen writers, whose point of view is very nearly identical, have\r\ndiscussed in successive chapters such topics as postal communications,\r\nelectric communication, investment, improvement of workingmen's homes,\r\nfree libraries, education, and other subjects, in their relation to the\r\nquestion, \"What action shall the State take in regard to them?\" The\r\nunderlying purpose of the book is thus expressed in the words of Mr.\r\nMackay, the editor of the volume:--\"If the view set out in this volume\r\nis at all correct, it is very necessary that men should abandon the\r\npolicy of indifference, and that they should do something to enlarge the\r\natmosphere of liberty. This is to be accomplished not by reckless and\r\nrevolutionary methods, but rather by a resolute resistance to new\r\nencroachment and by patient and statesmanlike endeavor to remove\r\nwherever practicable the restraints of regulation, and to give full play\r\nover a larger area to the creative forces of liberty, for liberty is the\r\ncondition precedent to all solution of human difficulty.\" Surely this is\r\na statement of the case which must powerfully appeal to all thinking\r\nmen, and lead them to reexamine, at least, the principles on which State\r\nsupport of the various institutions referred to is based.\r\n\r\nIn such a spirit, a reexamination of the argument for public support of\r\npublic libraries must be regarded as entirely germane to the objects\r\nwhich the American Library Association has at heart. In such a spirit\r\nthe present paper proposes to weigh once more the principles which\r\nunderlie our American library system, and the considerations brought\r\nforward by Mr. O'Brien in the chapter devoted to \"Free libraries\" in the\r\nvolume referred to.\r\n\r\nThe half-century of discussion of \"socialism and socialistic\r\nlegislation\" already referred to has made few things so clear as the\r\nfact that the arguments employed on any subject--social subjects in\r\nparticular--are weakened in almost the exact ratio in which they are\r\nallowed to be tinged by passion and excited feeling. It must therefore\r\nbe regarded as unfortunate that Mr. O'Brien's chapter suffers most\r\nemphatically from comparison with the generally high level of calm and\r\nunimpassioned argument, characterizing the larger portion of the book.\r\nWhether this is to be explained on the basis of the apocryphal legal\r\nmaxim, \"When you have no case, abuse your opponent,\" or whether Mr.\r\nO'Brien entered the lists fresh from some too recent participation in a\r\npersonal contest over the question, we do not undertake to inquire. The\r\nfact remains that not only do the writers of the other chapters of the\r\nbook appear from a careful reading to state their arguments more\r\neffectively, but that the reader is also impressed with the fact that\r\nthey have a case which admits of more effective argument.\r\n\r\nLet us glance in succession at the points which Mr. O'Brien has aimed\r\nto make. They may be grouped in general under two heads; first, those\r\nwhich relate to the injury (in Mr. O'Brien's view) inflicted on the\r\nindividual user of a free library from having it aided by public\r\nsupport, and second, those which relate to the tax-payer's grievance (in\r\nMr. O'Brien's view) in helping to support it. The former is of course\r\nthe side of the question most germane to the general purpose of the\r\nbook, and it is therefore an occasion for surprise to notice that in Mr.\r\nO'Brien's enumeration of arguments those coming under the other class\r\noutnumber it in the ratio of six to one. First of all, to use Mr.\r\nO'Brien's own language \"the argument that if readers were left to pay\r\nfor their own books, not only would books be more valued, but the moral\r\ndiscipline involved in the small personal sacrifice incurred by saving\r\nfor such a purpose would do infinitely more good than any amount of\r\nculture obtained at other people's expense.\" And he takes occasion to\r\nsuggest that \"possibly the advocates of literary pauperism will see\r\nlittle force in\" this argument. Possibly; we are not familiar with the\r\ntrain of reasoning which leads to an advocacy of \"literary pauperism.\"\r\nFor ourselves, we have been accustomed, long before the appearance of\r\nMr. O'Brien's chapter, to attach exceptional importance to the principle\r\nwhich he has here indicated, somewhat awkwardly, to be sure. There can\r\nbe no doubt that the appreciation of any object is in almost the exact\r\nratio of the effort expended to procure it. This is why teachers and\r\nlibrarians--in American communities, at least--have so often had\r\noccasion to rejoice at seeing a taste not only for reading, but for\r\nowning books inspired in a young man or woman by access to a noble\r\ncollection of books for the use of the public. For \"owning books,\" we\r\nsay; but the limits of a collection so owned are too soon reached in the\r\ncase of even the best-endowed pockets of individual readers. Were the\r\nintelligent teacher who takes an interest in the reading and\r\nintellectual growth of the pupils, from the various walks in life\r\nrepresented in our schools, to find a pupil whose interest in pursuing\r\nfurther some lines of thought therein suggested, extended no further\r\nthan to the books at home on his own book-shelf, we cannot doubt that it\r\nwould give occasion to question the efficacy of the teaching imparted.\r\nMr. O'Brien's objection to the enjoyment of these reservoirs of\r\nenlightenment, by a portion of the community, where the community as a\r\nwhole is responsible for their support, is as if a man should be told\r\nthat he would do well not to walk abroad at night by the light of the\r\npublic street lamps, but rather enjoy the light kindled in his own\r\nhouse. The latter is certainly important, but not even Mr. O'Brien's\r\nreasoning is likely to persuade us that it precludes the former. Mr.\r\nO'Brien, in the second place, deeply feels for the reader who, in being\r\nbrought in contact with the benefits of the library, is, he thinks,\r\nsubjected to a wrong system of education. To quote his language: \"Just\r\nat the time when a child is beginning to form his tastes, just at the\r\nperiod when the daily habituation to the simple duties of farm life\r\nwould lay the foundation both of sound health and practical knowledge,\r\nhe is taken out of the parent's control, and subjected to a\r\nmind-destroying, cramming process, which excludes practical knowledge\r\nand creates a dislike for all serious study.\" One is compelled on\r\nreading this extraordinary deliverance to cast one's eye to the heading\r\nat the top of the page, \"Free Libraries,\" and ask what this formidable\r\nindictment--not one count in which has any bearing on libraries--can\r\nmean in this connection. The only conclusion possible is that it was\r\nwritten with a view to appearing in some other chapter of the book.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. O'Brien's concern is manifested also for the taxpayer, who\r\nunites in the public support of the library. If we understand him\r\ncorrectly, his contention is that the enormity of this tax consists\r\nlargely in the reprehensible nature--as represented in his pages--of the\r\ninstitution itself. For from this short chapter one gradually frames a\r\npicture of the free library as a place which tramps frequent for\r\nsleeping off the effects of dissipation; as a place used by commercial\r\ntravellers for exhibiting their samples; as a place from which in one\r\ninstance \"a respectable thief took away L20 worth of books\"; as a place\r\nused in an almost exclusive degree for reading fiction; as a place where\r\nthe time prescribed for keeping books makes 'serious study' impossible;\"\r\nand, more serious than all the rest, as a place which, he says, \"favors\r\none special section of the community at the expense of all the rest.\"\r\nLet us do Mr. O'Brien the justice to add that for the first three of\r\nthese counts he gives \"chapter and verse\" for his charges, quoting,\r\nnamely, from various (English) library reports. No one will therefore\r\nwish to dispute his well-fortified statement that in such and such an\r\ninstance an unseemly incident occurred. But even a child can assuredly\r\nsee the difference between a statement of an isolated occurrence and an\r\ninference that it is a necessarily characteristic and inherent quality\r\nof the institution in question. Were this latter true, then we might\r\nwell cry out for abolishing our churches, sidewalks, and railway\r\nstations, for in them these very same three things respectively are\r\nknown at some time to have been done. In the last three of these counts,\r\nhowever, we have only Mr. O'Brien's assertions as the basis, and we are\r\nobliged to add also that even these are found to be conflicting. On one\r\npage his language shows that he is pained that a certain percentage of\r\nreaders in the libraries named should prefer to call for works of\r\nfiction. Can it be that he has forgotten this, when on another page he\r\ncites it as a grievance that \"it is a frequent occurrence for a reader\r\nto wait for months before he can get the novel he wants\"! On page 333,\r\nafter quoting, from the annual report of one of the English libraries,\r\nthe statement as to the use of works of fiction, nothing but a resort to\r\nitalics can sufficiently emphasize his lamentation that \"the more\r\ninstructive books in the other classes circulate only once during the\r\nsame period.\" Mr. O'Brien is not the only observer who has failed always\r\nto observe, when commenting upon percentages of fiction, that \"any book\r\nrequiring serious study cannot be galloped through, like a novel, in the\r\nweek or fourteen days allowed for use,\" yet who would have believed that\r\n\"out of his own mouth\" would he be so completely answered, for this\r\nremark, as well as the one which it answers, is found in his decidedly\r\ninteresting chapter (p. 348). But here it is evident that the bearing of\r\nthe two upon each other was not in his mind in writing it, for his\r\npurpose in the sentence last quoted was plainly to make it appear that\r\nthe customary regulations of public libraries were such as to render\r\n\"serious study\" impossible.\r\n\r\nThe limitation of \"a week or fourteen days\" for a book of the kind\r\nwhich he here indicates--he instances by name Kant's \"Critique of pure\r\nreason\" and Smith's \"Wealth of nations\"--is practically unknown in\r\nAmerican public libraries. In most of those known to the present writer\r\na book of this kind can be charged in the first instance for fourteen\r\ndays and then renewed, making twenty-eight days in all, and in still\r\nothers for a longer period. It can then, after being returned to the\r\nlibrary--to give any other reader who may need it a chance at it--be\r\ntaken out again after remaining on the shelves twenty-four hours, for\r\nanother twenty-eight days' use by the same reader. The annual report of\r\nan American library which lies before us contains a case in point.\r\nSpeaking of Bryce's \"American Commonwealth,\" it states: \"Of this, seven\r\ncopies were added in succession.\" It names 101 as the total of the\r\nissues of this work during the year; but considering the truth expressed\r\nin Mr. O'Brien's own very just words, that \"any book requiring serious\r\nstudy cannot be galloped through, like a novel,\" the statement is added\r\nthat \"such a record, for a book like this, constantly in the hands of\r\nreaders, may be contrasted with the more than ten times greater number\r\nof times that some work of fiction might be read through, returned and\r\ntaken out again, requiring but a part of a day's attention.\" In fact,\r\n101 is very likely to be the total number of issues possible in the case\r\nof seven copies of this book, while 700 would probably fall far short of\r\nthe total possible issues of the same number of copies of a story like\r\n\"The Wreck of the Grosvenor.\" Again, Mr. O'Brien not only tells us that\r\n\"a free library favors one special section of the community\" at the\r\nexpense of all the rest, but throughout his chapter recurs again and\r\nagain to the case of the \"workingman.\" On page 330, for instance, we are\r\nsolemnly told: \"If the workingman cannot come by his books honestly, let\r\nhim wait until he can.\" This is indeed somewhat summary, particularly\r\nwhen, being interpreted, it is found to mean, Let there be no free\r\nlibraries supported by the public. And yet, on page 344, with no less\r\ncertainty, we are assured that \"there is little doubt that at least\r\nforty-nine out of every fifty workingmen have no interest whatever in\r\nthese institutions.\"\r\n\r\nWhere the deliverances from one and the same source are so\r\ncontradictory, the impartial inquirer will doubtless feel like looking\r\nfor some other source of information. From the materials accessible to\r\nthe present writer in regard to American libraries--and the new edition\r\nof Mr. Greenwood's \"Public libraries\" appears to tell the same tale in\r\nregard to Great Britain--the interest of workingmen in the opportunities\r\nafforded by public libraries is everywhere emphatically shown; but he\r\nwho sets out with the purpose of showing that there is any one exclusive\r\nclass to whom the public library is of service and to no other--be that\r\nclass workingmen, or students, or manufacturers, or scientists--will\r\nfind the facts singularly obstinate and unresponsive to his purpose. The\r\ntruth is--Mr. O'Brien's confident assertion to the contrary--that there\r\nis no more \"universal\" and non-partisan institution than a public\r\nlibrary. This is undoubtedly the highest among its several claims to\r\npublic support. Few among the objects to which the public funds have\r\nbeen appropriated, in American cities, have met with so hearty and\r\nunquestioning approval as the public parks, and it is right that it\r\nshould be so. Yet there are whole classes in every community who not\r\nonly never do enjoy the public parks, but never care to enjoy them. Even\r\nthe public schools are for a certain fraction of the population\r\nonly--the younger portion. In contrast with both of these, the public\r\nlibrary extends its resources to the children and the adults alike.\r\nPerhaps, however, the fundamentally important question of universality,\r\nin the sense of non-partisanship, is one which is seldom appreciated in\r\nits full force, as applied to a public library. An independent position,\r\none entirely free from bias, a non-partisan attitude, in fact, is an\r\nideal repeatedly set before the conductors of a school or a newspaper.\r\nIn both these cases, however, there is too often an element of practical\r\ndifficulty in carrying these praiseworthy intentions into practice,\r\nwhich is almost completely wanting in the case of a public library. The\r\npolicy of the latter, is, in its very essence, catholic. It places on\r\nits shelves the volumes which represent, not one side, but both, or\r\nrather all sides of any subject on which the sentiment of the public\r\ndivides; and thus, whether the user be Democrat or Republican,\r\nprotectionist or freetrader, Catholic or Protestant, the aspect which\r\nthis collection of books presents to him is no less free and\r\nuncircumscribed than the illimitable aid.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is important that the relation of a public library to the\r\nquestion of entertainment should be clearly understood. Entertainment is\r\nnot an element totally foreign to the purposes of a public library--the\r\nsame kind of public benefit accrues in this case as in the case of\r\npublic parks--but in the light of the infinitely more important\r\nfunctions which it renders, this must of necessity occupy a subordinate\r\nplace. The primary function of a library is to render a service, to\r\nsupply a need, to respond to a demand. In this respect its value to the\r\ncommunity is of the same description as the postal system, the bank at\r\nwhich one may cash a check, or the reservoir from which one may \"turn\r\non\" a supply of water.\r\n\r\nOne of the points which Mr. O'Brien aims to make, and which proceeds\r\nfrom a manifest confusion of thought, can be appropriately noticed here.\r\nHis contention is that a public library is for the \"class\" who may be\r\ndesignated \"book-readers,\" that these form but a small percentage of any\r\ncommunity, and that therefore it is obviously wrong that the library\r\nshould receive public support. This is ingenious, as is also his\r\neloquent, though somewhat contemptuous setting of their supposed special\r\nneeds over against those of others. \"Are theatre-goers, lovers of\r\ncricket, bicyclists, amateurs of music, and others to have their\r\nearnings confiscated,\" merely that the \"book-reader\" may gratify his\r\npeculiar craving? Like many other ingenious theories, however, it leaves\r\nout of account certain fundamentally important bearings of the subject.\r\nThere can be no doubt that in any community \"the book-reader\" is not\r\nsynonymous with the entire population. Some of the population are\r\nchildren in arms; some have never learned to read; the sight of some who\r\nhave learned has failed; others again are too fully occupied to find\r\ntime for it; others find their inclination drawn more strongly in other\r\ndirections; others still have more or less to do with reading, yet are\r\nnot, in the strict sense, \"book-readers.\" Yet we shall err very widely\r\nif we lose sight of the fact that even those who do not personally\r\nperform the role of the \"book-reader\" do nevertheless benefit by the\r\nexistence of the library, by proxy. The young child is read to, by his\r\nmother; or is cared for by her, by methods learned through her use of\r\nbooks. The busy \"captain of industry,\" whose large profits are due to a\r\nskillful application of scientific principles, may find his own time so\r\nclosely occupied by details of administration that, personally, he\r\nseldom opens the treatises which bear upon the subject, but he expects\r\nto keep abreast of the ever unfolding science, by the consultation not\r\nonly of such works as private ownership may provide, but the more nearly\r\ncomplete collection in a great public library.\r\n\r\nThis principle of \"community of interest\" and interdependence has an\r\neven wider bearing; for it applies not only to the family and the\r\nbusiness firm, but to the community as a whole. A public library\r\nreport now before the writer contains several instances of this kind.\r\nSpeaking of the systematic efforts made to build up an approximately\r\ncomplete collection of works on industrial and decorative subjects,\r\nthe report states that in this way \"the library is gradually becoming\r\nthe possessor of a scientifically selected set of volumes and plates\r\nwhich cannot fail to leave a distinct impress on the character of the\r\nwork done in the various industries of the city.\" Another portion of\r\nthe same report illustrates the direct service rendered by such an\r\ninstitution to the interests of the municipality. To quote the\r\nlanguage there used, \"Instances of the last named, both striking and\r\ntangible, are of by no means exceptional occurrence, sometimes an\r\napplication of this kind being presented from more than one city\r\nofficial on the same day,\" the foregoing having reference to the city\r\nin question. \"A well-authenticated instance,\" it continues, \"in one of\r\nthe largest cities of the country, of the saving of a sum of many\r\nthousand dollars, in the matter of a contract, due to the opportunity\r\nfor consulting the requisite data comprised in works of authority in\r\nthe public library of that city, is but an indication of the\r\npossibilities of a public library.\"\r\n\r\nIt is fitting that where funds are to be appropriated, collected by\r\ntaxes levied on the tax-paying population, there should be possible so\r\ntangible a presentation as the above, of the direct relation of the\r\ninstitution supported, to the question of \"profit and loss,\" as\r\naffecting those who are taxed. And yet it is well to remember that it is\r\nas true now as twenty centuries ago, that \"man does not live by bread\r\nalone;\" and that the public support of the institutions referred to can\r\nbe justified by other arguments than that of the material interests just\r\ncited.\r\n\r\nNo aspect of the library's operation is more full of interest than\r\nthat which takes account of its uplifting influence. The analogy between\r\nits service and that of the postal system has been noticed; but it has a\r\nno less real analogy to the work of the school, the pulpit, or the\r\npress--yet without the propagandist principle which so often attaches to\r\nthese latter--namely, in the principle of growth or advance. In the\r\nearlier portion of this paper a little space was devoted to showing that\r\nin the nature of the case the number of copies of any work of fiction\r\nused in the course of a year would immensely out-number those which\r\ncould possibly be read in the more solid departments of reading. Even\r\nwere the constituency of the library confined to a selected few, to\r\nwhose minds the higher class of reading was congenial, this would be the\r\ncase. Nor should we forget that the ground of distinction between a\r\n\"public\" library and any other, as the library of a scientific society,\r\na debating society, a theological school or a teachers' club, is that\r\nits constituency _is_ not thus limited to a selected class but is broad\r\nas humanity itself, with all its enormous inequalities of condition,\r\ntaste, and mental growth. Like a mirror, therefore, the recorded\r\nclassified circulation reflects this variety. Even with this apparently\r\nalmost unmanageable unevenness, appreciable improvement in standards of\r\nreading is by no means an unknown experience. There lies before the\r\nwriter, for instance, a library report which is able to make such a\r\nstatement as this: \"The fiction percentages of the seven successive\r\nyears, beginning with 1883 and ending with 1889, show an uninterrupted\r\ndecline, as follows: 70+, 66+, 62+, 61+, 58+, 56+.\" But it must be\r\nremembered also that figures such as these, though they may tell a part,\r\nand a very gratifying part, of the advances which individual readers\r\nhave been helped to make, fall very far short of expressing the whole.\r\nIt would be entirely possible for individual after individual thus to\r\nadvance from good to better, and from better to best, and yet the\r\nfigures which express the aggregate use of the year remain stationary\r\n(or even retrograde), because the constituency of a public library\r\n(particularly in a large city) is all the time being reenforced by new\r\nreaders. And these new readers comprise both those who are children in\r\nage and those who are children in mental growth, who begin at the foot.\r\nWhen, therefore, there is anything more than a preserving of a uniform\r\nlevel--as in the noteworthy figures above quoted--it stands for a very\r\nstriking advance indeed, on the part of a very large portion of the\r\ncommunity. Probably every librarian in charge of a public library in a\r\nlarge city has had an opportunity of observing these advances in\r\ninnumerable individual instances. And this class of results, while\r\ndistinctly following the \"order of nature,\" does not by any means come\r\nabout through a view of library administration which regards either\r\nbooks, readers, or librarian as inert masses. Much of it is the result\r\nof individual interest expressed by the librarian in some reader, whose\r\nmind receives an awakening impulse.\r\n\r\nMore than one well authenticated instance exists of an individual\r\nbeginning life as a newsboy or an elevator-boy, and through his use of a\r\npublic library finding his intellectual powers unfolding until he has\r\nentered one of the learned professions. The relation of the library\r\nsystem to the school system opens an almost boundless field of thought,\r\nand it is a fact of deep significance that the profound principle\r\ninvolved in it, after having engaged the attention of English and\r\nAmerican libraries for years, has been recognized in the educational\r\nsteps recently taken by the government of Japan, where the two systems\r\nare placed on a plane of equality. In the experience of one of the\r\nAmerican libraries already referred to, almost the chief hope of the\r\nlibrary for the future is placed upon \"a class of readers,\" every year\r\nlargely increasing in numbers, who comprise the \"graduates from the\r\nvarious institutions of learning\" in the city, and whose \"lines of study\r\nand reading\" \"may be characterized as a carrying forward of those\r\nimpulses in the direction of right reading which were received in school\r\nand college.\" The library has a no less direct relation to the needs and\r\nambitions of those who have received the invaluable training of \"the\r\npractical duties of the world,\" to use Mr. O'Brien's phrase, and it\r\nresponds with equal readiness to these. There is concentrated in the\r\ncontemptuous phrase, \"book-learning,\" a popular judgment of condemnation\r\nwhich is for the most part just, on the spurious variety of knowledge\r\nwhich knows the expression of certain principles in books, but knows\r\nnothing of their practical embodiment in the life and work of this\r\nworld. We are glad to observe that Mr. O'Brien's antipathy to this\r\npseudo-knowledge is almost as profound as our own, but his expression of\r\nit seems singularly out of place in a philippic against public\r\nlibraries; for one will seek far before finding an institution more\r\nperfectly suited to be a corrective of such a tendency than the modern\r\npublic library. Does any one claim that the public school system\r\nsometimes has an unfortunate tendency to repress individuality and turn\r\nout a set of pupils of uniform mould? If so, the public library supplies\r\na means of supplementing and complementing this uniformity by its\r\ninfinite variety and universality, and it is continually doing this,\r\nindeed. Does any one regret that the school system at its best reaches\r\nbut a fraction of the population and that fraction for but a few short\r\nyears of their life, and that in too many instances there is a tendency\r\non the part of even these few, educated in the schools, to conceive of\r\ntheir education as \"finished,\" and allow the fabric to become hopelessly\r\nravelled? If so, the public library stands to these members of the\r\ncommunity in an almost ideal relation, not only fulfilling very\r\nperfectly Mr. Carlyle's characterization of a \"collection of books\" as\r\n\"the people's university,\" but in the peculiarly wide range shown in the\r\ndemands made upon it, almost as properly rendering it the people's\r\nworkshop, or laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe same library report which has several times been cited printed\r\nseveral years since a record of the inquiries made on specific subjects\r\nduring a single month, which throws significant light upon this subject.\r\nAnother report of the same library declares that \"few can adequately\r\nconceive to what extent the inquiries made at the library have become\r\nspecialized, and require trained facility and research\" on the part of\r\nthe library staff. The library thus becomes a laboratory, in which the\r\nreader gains not only the specific information, but the method.\r\n\r\nAn observation of popular movements in their relation to political or\r\neconomic principles reveals few facts so plainly as that an almost\r\ninsuperable narrowness of view is, in much the greater number of\r\ninstances, the barrier to advance in those questions decided mainly by\r\nthe popular voice. Why then should any one wish to perpetuate the\r\nconditions which make this possible? In Mr. O'Brien's view the\r\nworkingman,--and we ought not to forget how large a percentage of the\r\ncommunity this word \"workingman\" represents, both in England and\r\nAmerica,--will be a fortunate man when the contents of free libraries\r\nare no longer rendered everywhere accessible to him by public support,\r\nfor then the workingmen \"for one 'penny' can buy their favorite\r\nnewspaper, which can be carried in the pocket and read at any time\"! It\r\nis well nigh incredible that an ideal such as this should be looked\r\nforward to by thinking men. Whatever may be the fact in regard to the\r\nworkingmen of Great Britain,--and Mr. O'Brien of course knows them\r\nbetter than we do,--it may confidently be asserted that the American\r\nworkingman would strike no such false note. Mr. Lowell in one of his\r\nadmirable orations quotes from a Wallachian legend of a peasant who was\r\n\"taken up into heaven\" and offered his choice among the objects to be\r\nseen there. He chose a half worn-out bagpipe, and with this returned to\r\nthe earth. \"With an infinite possibility within his reach, with the\r\nchoice of wisdom, of power, of beauty, at his tongue's end, he asked\r\naccording to his kind, and his sordid wish is answered with a gift as\r\nsordid.\" The newspaper is well enough in its way,--even a \"penny\r\nnewspaper,\"--but to condemn whole masses of the population to limit\r\nthemselves to this, is to incur the condemnation of Mr. Lowell's fine\r\nscorn when, in another portion of the oration just referred to, he says:\r\n\"It is we who, while we might each in his humble way be helping our\r\nfellows into the right path, or adding one block to the climbing spire\r\nof a fine soul, are willing to become mere sponges saturated from the\r\nstagnant goose-pond of village gossip.\" It is more. It is to help\r\ndevelop a community from whom in the end every spark of uplifting\r\ninfluence shall have vanished. Does any one say that this is a result\r\nimpossible of attainment by any people? The scientifically true, yet\r\nbrutally summary record given by the distinguished European savant,\r\nElisee Reclus, of a certain European stock which has found and occupied\r\nvirgin soil in the South of Africa, is a sufficient answer. \"In\r\ngeneral,\" he says, \"the Boers despise everything that does not\r\ncontribute directly to the material prosperity of the family group. They\r\nignore music, the arts, literature, all refining influence, and find\r\nlittle pleasure in anything,\" except solid amassing of wealth.\r\n\r\nA few additional points remain to be noted. It is an entirely pertinent\r\nquestion whether every public library in England and America improves\r\nits high privilege, uses to the full the peculiar opportunities open to\r\nit, places itself in close communication with the public school system,\r\nwith the university extension movement, and with the influences\r\ncontinually at work in industrial and artistic development. And we need\r\nnot hesitate to answer in the negative. Yet the significant fact is,\r\nthat everywhere the tendency is in this direction with a stronger and\r\nstronger momentum. The advance made in this country, within the last\r\ndecade even, in this direction, is among the most striking phenomena of\r\nthe time; and no less striking is the almost overwhelming percentage of\r\nthe body of librarians in this country whose entrance upon the work from\r\na deep-seated love for it, rather than as furnishing a means of\r\nlivelihood, supplies one of the strongest guarantees against the\r\ninvasion of the perfunctory spirit in the future. Again, it is equally\r\npertinent to ask whether, granted that the benefits of such an\r\ninstitution as the public library are unquestioned, dependence may not\r\nbe placed on funds entirely unconnected with those of the public, for\r\nits support. It would ill become the citizen of a country where private\r\nmunificence has accomplished so much in channels of public spirit, to\r\noverlook these noble memorials of enlightened private action. Yet it\r\nremains true, nevertheless, that were dependence to be placed on these\r\nalone, a map of the country on which public libraries should be dotted\r\ndown would show as partial and inadequate a supply furnished to the\r\ncommunity, as the very instructive \"annual rainfall map\" published by\r\nthe government shows in the matter of rain. What we are accustomed, in\r\nthe eastern portion of this country, to consider the rain--in its\r\nuniversal beneficent service and in its indispensableness--that also is\r\nto be associated with the \"reservoirs\" comprised in these public\r\ncollections of books. For, after all, valuable as are the books\r\nthemselves, even in their material aspect, as pieces of handiwork, still\r\nmore in the specific items of information and admonition contained in\r\nthem, yet in the deeper view these are but symbols of their real\r\nsignificance and service. To place one's self in communication with them\r\nas contained in these libraries, is to bring ourselves in contact with\r\nthe stored-up thought of the world thus far. We have just adverted to\r\nthe fundamental bearing which this has upon the deeper or spiritual side\r\nof man's life. But the two-sided character of these collections of books\r\nfollows us even here, for their indispensableness in the material point\r\nof view is almost as striking, and this, not only whether we consider\r\nthe statesman planning measures of public weal, while neglecting to\r\ninform himself of the recorded conditions which necessarily must\r\ndetermine such measures; or whether it be the inventor spending long\r\nyears of his too brief life in perfecting a machine which his\r\nconsultation of the recorded patent would have shown him some one else\r\nhad anticipated him in thinking out; or whether it be the day laborer\r\nsubmitting without an effort to violations of his rights, which a single\r\nglance at the recorded statutes would have shown him he had a remedy\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nHow like all this is to the supposed state of things which one of the\r\nmost suggestive writers of our day has thus expressed: \"Our early\r\nvoyagers are dead: not a plank remains of the old ships that first\r\nessayed unknown waters; the sea retains no track; and were it not for\r\nthe history of these voyages contained in charts, in chronicles, in\r\nhoarded lore of all kinds, each voyager, though he were to start with\r\nall the aids of advanced civilization,\" would be in the helpless\r\nposition of the earliest voyager.\r\n\r\nOnce more, each reader of the strongly written book which we have been\r\nconsidering should ask the question for himself, whether all of the\r\nvarious propositions maintained therein necessarily stand or fall\r\ntogether. Because the compiler has chosen to bracket together two such\r\nheadings as \"Free libraries\" and \"The state and electrical\r\ndistribution,\" it certainly does not follow that the argument which\r\ncarries conviction in the one case must in the other also. We shall not\r\nbe suspected of having our judgment in this regard swayed by the natural\r\nweakness with which, to use Mr. O'Brien's illustration, the shoemaker is\r\ninclined to think that \"there is nothing like leather,\" if we suggest,\r\nwhat the public at large in this country is very plainly persuaded of,\r\nthat, for one person who has appreciated the need for public action in\r\nthe latter case there are thousands in the former. The writer lives in a\r\ncity in which for more than eleven years the public library was\r\nadministered by funds not in the least degree derived from municipal\r\nappropriations. Yet the character of its service to the public had so\r\nwidely impressed itself upon the community that, largely from sources\r\noutside of the library board, a movement arose for recognizing the\r\ncloseness of the relation, by public support. A report by a committee of\r\nthe city government, recommending this course, significantly declares:\r\n\"Your committee are unanimously of the opinion that this public library,\r\nalready existing in the city, is a useful and a necessary adjunct to the\r\neducational system sustained by the city in its public schools, and\r\nproperly appeals to the treasury for an appropriation towards its\r\nsupport.\" After eleven years' opportunity for observation and\r\ncomparison, such a judgment as this has the merit of deliberation and\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nIt is true that by far the greater part of the considerations which\r\nlead the present writer to find Mr. O'Brien's view untenable are drawn\r\nfrom observation and experience of conditions existing in this country.\r\nYet it is to be noted that his position is also contested, so far as\r\nGreat Britain is concerned, by an article in the March number of The\r\nLibrary (of London), which shows, not only that our English cousins are\r\nfully able to take care of themselves, but also that on many of the\r\nquestions of fact, about which his arguments turn, he is painfully wide\r\nof the mark. Few students of social conditions have left so noteworthy\r\nan impress on contemporary thought as the late William Stanley Jevons.\r\nOf the free public library he held a view radically opposed to that of\r\nMr. O'Brien, believing it to be \"an engine for operating upon\" the\r\ncommunity, in ways at once protective and ennobling. As to the\r\nuniversality of its beneficent service, he was equally convinced,\r\ndeclaring not only that \"free libraries are engines for creating the\r\nhabit and power of enjoying high-class literature, and thus carrying\r\nforward the work of civilization which is commenced in the primary\r\nschool,\" but also that they are \"classed with town halls, police courts,\r\nprisons, and poor-houses, as necessary adjuncts of our stage of\r\ncivilization.\" The experience of one community or one nation is\r\nrepeatedly serviceable to another; but, after all, it is the local\r\nconditions which must finally determine in any case. Even if a different\r\nconclusion were to be reached in this matter in Great Britain, it would\r\nstill remain true that for us in America it is one of the highest duties\r\nof self-preservation to keep alive the uplifting influences represented\r\nin the public support of these institutions. The future of this country,\r\neven more than its past, will be irrevocably committed to the democratic\r\nprinciple in government. As is the people--in the widest sense of the\r\nword--so will be the national life and character. In the future, even\r\nmore than in the past, crudity, narrowness, well-meaning ignorance, and\r\nlow standards of taste and ethics will, unless met with corrective\r\ntendencies, color our national life. The public school and the public\r\nlibrary--\"instruments equal in power to the Dionysiac theatre, and\r\nvastly greater in their range of power,\" to quote the language of one of\r\nthe most thoughtful of our men of letters--will stand more and more, in\r\nour American communities, as such corrective tendencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE PUBLIC\r\n\r\n    One of the first clear statements of the Public Library as a\r\n    business enterprise, involving certain amounts invested by a\r\n    city with the expectation of certain definite returns. The\r\n    paper refers particularly to the San Francisco Public\r\n    Library, of which the author, Frederic Beecher Perkins, was\r\n    then librarian but its conclusions are general, and hold\r\n    good to-day. It was read at the Lake George Conference of\r\n    the American Library Association, in September, 1885.\r\n\r\n    Frederic Beecher Perkins was born in Hartford, Conn., Sept.\r\n    27, 1828, a grandson of Lyman Beecher. He left Yale in\r\n    sophomore year to study law and was admitted to the bar in\r\n    1851, but graduated at the State Normal School in 1852 and\r\n    devoted himself to literary and educational work. In 1880-87\r\n    he was librarian of the San Francisco Public Library. He\r\n    died in Morristown, N.J., Jan. 27, 1899. He was the father\r\n    of Charlotte Perkins Gilman.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are in the United States about 5,000 public libraries of 300\r\nvolumes or more. Returns of their present conditions are very imperfect,\r\nand must therefore be summed in the following crude way:--\r\n\r\n  Annual cost much more than                  $1,500,000\r\n  The books in them are many more than        13,000,000\r\n  Books added yearly are many more than          500,000\r\n  Books used yearly are many more than        10,000,000\r\n\r\nThese institutions, therefore, represent a large money investment, and\r\na very extensive and active educational agency. Not all of them by any\r\nmeans are \"free public libraries,\"--_i.e._, libraries supported by taxes\r\nor endowments for the use of all. But a considerable portion of them\r\nare. It may now be justly said that no town of importance is respectably\r\ncomplete without a free public library any more than any town whatever\r\nwithout a school.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Free Public Library was founded in 1879, and was\r\nadvancing with creditable speed towards a size and usefulness\r\ncorresponding to the position of San Francisco, among American cities,\r\nuntil the present city government suddenly cut down its annual\r\nappropriation to bare running expenses, leaving no allowance for buying\r\nnew books, or even for replacing old ones worn out.\r\n\r\nThis library is not a collection of mummies of deceased learning, which\r\nwill be no drier in a thousand years than they are now. It has thus far\r\nconsisted of live books for live people. But a library of this\r\npractically useful kind, if it stops buying new books, quickly becomes\r\ndead stock,--unattractive, obsolete, useless. In _belles-lettres_,\r\nliterature, history, mechanic arts, engineering, applied science, all\r\nalike, it is equally indispensable to have the new books. The\r\nphotographer, the druggist, the electrician, the machinist, the\r\nmanufacturing chemist, as much as or more than the reader of novels,\r\npoetry, travels, or history, want this year's discoveries, for last\r\nyear's are already obsolete. Next year it will not be Mr. Blaine's book\r\nthat will be most called for,--that will be a year old,--but General\r\nGrant's book. But a thousand examples would not make the case clearer.\r\nThis prohibition of new books, perhaps on pretence of economy, would be\r\nthe natural first step of shrewd opponents intending to close the\r\nlibrary entirely as soon as the books are dead enough. It is girdling\r\nthe tree now, so as to destroy it more early next year. It is understood\r\nthat at least two prominent members of the present city government\r\n(Supervisor Pond and Auditor Strother) are distinctly opposed to the\r\nlibrary, and to free public libraries, on principle. It is not known\r\nthat any member of it is a particularly energetic friend of the\r\ninstitution. The library staff is small in number (seven boys and eight\r\nadults); the salaries (omitting the librarian's) exceptionally scanty,\r\nand even this small patronage and expenditure is wholly controlled by\r\nthe Board of Trustees, and wholly out of reach of the Board of\r\nSupervisors. When this is remembered it is easy to understand both the\r\nprobable firmness of any opposition, and the probable lukewarmness of\r\nany friendship to the library in the latter body. This is perfectly\r\nnatural. All governing bodies try to keep and increase their authority\r\nover persons and payments. They never let go of them when they can help\r\nit. And, accordingly, the Supervisors insisted on controlling all the\r\nexpenditure and management of the library, until a decision of the\r\nSupreme Court of the State forced the control out of their hands.\r\n\r\nWhether the actual closing of the library is intended or not, the\r\nobvious first step towards it has been taken, and its closing will\r\nfollow in due season, if the policy is continued. If the voters of San\r\nFrancisco choose to have it so, there is no more to be said, for it is\r\ntheir library. Probably they could lawfully divide up the books among\r\nthemselves, and so close out the enterprise. The dividend, now, would be\r\nnot far from one volume to each household in the city. But, if they wish\r\nthe library to continue, this early notice is due them.\r\n\r\nFurther: the custom here, in respect to the contents of municipal public\r\ndocuments, prevents such discussions of library questions as are usual\r\nin the annual reports of other city libraries; so that, if a view of\r\nprinciples and practices in and about such institutions as a class, and\r\nof their application in this instance, is to be laid before the public\r\nat all, it must be submitted, as in this paper, unofficially.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the financial, and some of the literary,\r\nrelations between public libraries and cities in San Francisco, in four\r\nother large cities, and in six small cities. The cases were taken\r\npromiscuously as they came to hand, of the latest dates available, but\r\nall are within a few years. New York has no free public library;\r\nmovements to establish one there have repeatedly been contemplated, but\r\nhave been abandoned, because the men who could have set up the library\r\nwould not encounter the practical certainty of its becoming one more\r\ncorruptionist engine in the hands of the city rulers. Philadelphia has\r\nnone, for reasons not known to the present writer, but, very likely, the\r\nsame as in New York.

It may\r\nbe added, although the figures are not in this table, that a much more\r\nstriking evidence of the stringent economy of the library administration\r\nhere is the fact that there is paid at the Boston Public Library in\r\nsalaries, in the cataloging department alone, without allowing anything\r\nfor printing, nearly as much as the whole of this year's library\r\nappropriation by the city of San Francisco.\r\n\r\n(7) Similar comparisons with the six smaller cities listed would give\r\nresults generally similar, but showing a still more liberal rate per\r\nhead and dollar of expenditure for libraries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this exposition of comparative parsimony a feature of it\r\nshould be remembered which might easily escape notice: that, while the\r\nmoney for running expenses is all gone at the end of the year, nearly\r\nall of the allowance above running expenses remains represented by\r\nvaluable property. Thus, if the year's allowance for this library had\r\nbeen $28,000, instead of $18,000, it would not have cost a cent more to\r\nrun the library and at the year's end about $10,000 worth of books would\r\nremain added to the permanent property of the city.\r\n\r\nAnother result of this policy is to prevent printing any catalogue of\r\nthe recent additions to the library; so that there is practically no\r\naccess, and there will, for the present, continue to be none, even for\r\nthe public who own the books, to all additions to this library since\r\nJune, 1884, being several thousand titles. It is needless to point out\r\nthat if there were to be the hypothesis of an unfriendly purpose\r\nentertained against the library, that purpose would be served as\r\ndirectly by suppressing the names of books in the library as by\r\npreventing the addition of new ones, or by the replacing of those worn\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThese brief statements sufficiently show what our city is doing, and\r\nwhat other cities are doing, for or against public libraries. It is not\r\nwithin the scope of this paper to inquire after the real reason for the\r\nstop put to the progress of the San Francisco Free Public Library. One\r\nhypothesis is, that, instead of any unfriendly intention against the\r\nlibrary itself, the step was taken to help in persuading the public that\r\nthe \"dollar limit\" to the rate of city taxation is too low, and that our\r\ncitizens must submit to a higher rate. As the money saved is only\r\n$6,000, the economy is not great in itself, being about one\r\nfour-hundredth part of the city tax levy. If the proposed effect was\r\nexpected to be produced by continuously annoying and dissatisfying the\r\ncitizens there is more reason in the scheme; for the library is\r\nfrequented by more than a thousand persons daily; between 26,000 and\r\n27,000 cards have been issued to authorize the home use of books; and\r\nthere are always at any given moment from 5,900 to 6,000 volumes from\r\nthe library in use in as many homes all over the city. To inconvenience\r\nand disoblige so large a constituency as this may naturally produce some\r\neffect. This paper need not attempt to decide whether that effect would\r\nnaturally be approval or disapproval of the treatment of the library,\r\nenthusiasm in favor of, or against, the proposed increase of taxation,\r\nunpopularity or popularity of the institution itself, or of those whose\r\naction so effectually cripples its usefulness. Nor will it discuss the\r\nstill larger question of the \"dollar limit\" itself,[4] however\r\ndecisively important all these inquiries are for the future of the\r\nlibrary, and however interesting and clear the arguments and conclusions\r\non those subjects may be. But what it may properly do is, to state,\r\nwithout any pretence of novelty, but simply in order to refresh the\r\npublic memory, the chief heads of a doctrine of her public libraries\r\nfrom a practical point of view.\r\n\r\nFirst (to limit the discussion). What a free public library is _not_\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nIt is not for a nursery; a lunch-room; a bed-room; a place for meeting a\r\ngirl in a corner and talking to her; a conversation-room of any kind; a\r\nfree dispensary of stationery, envelopes, and letter-writing; a free\r\nrange for loiterers; a campaigning field for mendicants, or for\r\ndisplaying advertisements; a haunt for loafers and criminals. Indeed,\r\nnot to specify with inelegant distinctness, a free public library, like\r\nany other similarly commodious place of free public resort, would, if\r\npermitted, be used for any purpose whatever, no matter how private or\r\nhow vicious, which could be served there more conveniently than by going\r\nto one's own home, or than by having any home at all. It would be so\r\nused systematically, constantly, and to a degree of intolerable\r\nnuisance; and its purification from such uses, if they have been set up,\r\nwill be met with clamor, abuse, and with any degree and kind of even\r\nviolent resistance which may be thought safe, or likely to succeed. Let\r\nit not be supposed that this is an imaginary picture. It is in every\r\npoint taken from actual and numerous instances, and could be illustrated\r\nby a sufficiently ridiculous series of single adventures, by any\r\nlibrarian of large experience. Open public premises for some of the\r\npurposes above specified might conceivably be properly supplied by the\r\npublic. What is here affirmed is, that public libraries are not at\r\npresent proper for them.\r\n\r\n[4] San Francisco is at present taxed on a precise scale of one dollar\r\nto the hundred dollars of value, and on an annual total valuation of\r\n$200,000,000, which is, however, in practice somewhat, but not\r\nlargely, exceeded.\r\n\r\nSecond. What such a library _is_ for.\r\n\r\nIts first object is to supply books to persons wishing to improve their\r\nknowledge of their occupations. Such books as Nicholson's, Burns',\r\nRiddell's, Tredgold's, Dwyer's, Waring's, Holly's, and others, on\r\npractical architecture, building, or departments of them; the numerous\r\ncollections of plans and details of domestic and other architecture;\r\nMasury's house-painting; Kittredge's metal-worker's pattern-book;\r\nPercy's, Phillips', and other books on metallurgy and mining; Dussance,\r\nPiesse, and others on soap-making, perfumery, and other branches of\r\napplied chemistry; Lock on sugar-refining; many manuals of brewing and\r\ndistilling; Noad, Hospitalier, Preece, etc., on applications of\r\nelectricity; Burgh's, Roper's, and other hand-books and more advanced\r\nworks on steam engineering generally, locomotives, marine engines, etc.;\r\nGaskell's, Hill's, and other business manuals; hand-books of\r\ncorrespondence, book-keeping, phonography; in short, text-books, both\r\nelementary and advanced, in all sorts of commercial and industrial\r\noccupations, are of the first importance in a free public library, and\r\nare constantly and eagerly used in this one. The study of such books\r\nputs money directly into the student's pocket, promotes his success in\r\nlife, and the prosperity of the city. A good and active public library\r\nraises the value of every piece of real estate in the city, by thus\r\nmaking the city more profitable (in dollars) to live in; because it\r\nenables the intelligent and studious to earn more.\r\n\r\nSecond in importance is the supply of books to those who wish to acquire\r\nor pursue an education, or to complete or continue a knowledge of\r\ngeneral literature; and, third, the accommodation of students working\r\nout special lines of research.\r\n\r\nFourth. Such is the more solid usefulness of a public library. The rest\r\nof its distributing work, whatever its intrinsic usefulness, is at least\r\nas indispensable, and is always numerically the most popular. This is\r\nthe supply of light literature to readers for rest or amusement. Whether\r\nbooks of this class constitute one-half the library or (as in this one)\r\none-tenth of it, it may be depended on that from one-half to four-fifths\r\nof all the reading done will be done from that part. The justification\r\nof the supply of such books by a free public library is, that it is\r\nimportant also, if not likewise, to afford mental relaxation, as it is\r\nto feed mental effort; that even light reading is a very important\r\nimprovement over and safe-guard from street life and saloon life; that\r\nsuch books introduce to a more useful class of books by forming the\r\nhabit of reading; and that the public, who pay for the library, choose\r\nto have books of this sort as much as, if not even rather more than, the\r\nmore useful sort.\r\n\r\nFifth. There is another department of usefulness for public libraries,\r\nquite unknown until within a few years, which makes them actual and\r\nvital members of the public-school system, and additionally justifies\r\nthe term \"People's Universities,\" which has often been applied to them.\r\nThis is the arrangement at the library of courses of illustrative study\r\nand reading for teachers or pupils, or both. A series of such books as\r\nrelate to one or another part of the school course is laid out at the\r\nlibrary; the teachers, and perhaps sometimes one of the higher classes,\r\nexamine them along with the librarian, and such information as they\r\nafford is used to fill out and illustrate the outline in the school-book\r\nfor the fuller information of the pupils.\r\n\r\nThis practice is perhaps easiest in history and geography. It is easy to\r\nsee how a capable teacher could intensify the interest and enrich the\r\nminds of a class about the geography of the East Indian archipelago, by\r\nintroducing them to the vivid narrative and abundant illustrations of\r\nWallace's most entertaining and instructive book on that region. How,\r\nfor instance, Palgrave's \"Year in Arabia,\" Palmer's \"Desert of the\r\nExodus,\" Lady Duff Gordon's \"Letters from Egypt,\" O'Donovan's \"Merv\r\nOasis,\" Atkinson's and Kennan's books on Siberia, Huc's \"Travels in\r\nTartary and in China,\" and hundreds of other books, each for its\r\nlocality, all over the world, could be used to give a child clear\r\nnotions and strong impressions of savage or civilized landscapes and\r\npeople. It is not too much to say that the study of geography in the\r\npublic schools of San Francisco, illustrated as it could easily be from\r\nbooks of travel now in the public library, could be made from beginning\r\nto end as fascinating as any romance, while it would store the\r\nchildren's minds with a kind and quantity of distinct knowledge about\r\nthe earth and its people as much beyond the results of ordinary\r\ngeographical study as gold is better than mud. It would be easy to\r\nfurnish similar specifications for the study of history, of natural\r\nscience, and other branches. This is no mere speculation. This system of\r\ninstruction is regularly practised by Mr. Green, of the Worcester Free\r\nLibrary (the originator and pioneer in it); by Mr. Poole at Chicago, and\r\nelsewhere, and with complete success. Besides its immediate result in\r\nvivifying and enriching the pupil's minds, this method affords a\r\ntraining in habits of reading of the very best kind, by teaching\r\nresearch, the habit of selecting books, and the practice of comparative\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: A free public library--\r\n\r\n1. As to manners--is a parlor, not a bar-room; a place where not only\r\nworking men and business men, but ladies and young girls can safely and\r\nconveniently come and abide. While not expressly a school of manners and\r\nmorals, it is much and closely concerned in maintaining a high standard\r\nin both.\r\n\r\n2. As to objects--is to furnish good books, not bad ones; to satisfy\r\nwithin this limit all demands on it as far as may be; and in particular\r\nto be progressive; that is, to supply for intelligent readers what they\r\nmost require,--the _new_ good books.\r\n\r\n3. As to method--should keep the books in the best possible condition\r\nfor the longest possible term of use, and should not allow them to be\r\nscattered, lost, abused, mutilated, or stolen.\r\n\r\nLastly. It is needless to add, under these heads, any of the numerous\r\ntechnical details which crowd the work of an active library; but this\r\nexposition would be inexcusably imperfect without a reference to the\r\nabsolute indispensableness of proper quarters in order to successful\r\nlibrary administration. Only the merest reference need now be made to\r\nthe professional immorality of notorious localities close around this\r\nlibrary in its present place. Something more may be said of the\r\nunbusinesslike payment by the city of a heavy insurance on $50,000 worth\r\nof its property, which must be paid, because the library is in the same\r\nbuilding with a theatre. Theatres burn down on an average once in\r\nseventeen years; and a theatre risk, although not absolutely uninsurable\r\nlike a gunpowder mill, is what insurance men call \"extra hazardous;\" so\r\nthat not only is the insurance rate high, but the destruction by fire of\r\nthe library (in its present location) may be looked upon as certain, the\r\nonly question being, How soon?\r\n\r\nA difficulty less obvious and less dangerous, but still a source of\r\nconstant friction and annoyance, is the present arrangement of the\r\nlibrary as one collection, with but one place for delivering books. In a\r\nsmall library, with a small business, this difficulty becomes nothing;\r\nbut in one as large and as energetically active as this it is a serious\r\ndisadvantage. Such a library imperatively requires division into two\r\nlibraries or sections, one to contain all books deliverable without\r\ndiscrimination; the other, all books calling for special care and\r\nprecaution of any kind. The receipt and delivery desks of these two\r\nsections should be separate, and before and behind them there should be\r\nplenty of room. In the present library, which is in one large undivided\r\nhall, the space is insufficient, both for the public and for the library\r\nstaff; and books of the two classes above described are intermingled all\r\nover the shelves. The result is, crowding, interruption, delay, error,\r\nconfusion, and dissatisfaction. Very many books might be trusted with a\r\nstudious mechanic or a literary student which it would be a folly to\r\ndeliver into the hands of a small boy or girl. Many other extremely\r\ndesirable objects would be gained by the occupancy of properly arranged\r\nlibrary quarters; but of these only two need be mentioned here; separate\r\nquarters could be provided for students who need special facilities and\r\nassistance, and there could be such arrangements that ladies using the\r\nlibrary need not crowd and struggle about among impatient children and\r\nmiscellaneous masculine strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEVY OF LIBRARY TRIBUTE\r\n\r\n    The above title was constructed by the editor from a\r\n    sentence in the presidential address of Henry M. Utley\r\n    before the American Library Association at its Denver\r\n    conference of 1895. President Utley himself gave it no\r\n    title, but it is an examination of the claims of the library\r\n    to public support, with a conclusion that those claims are\r\n    justified only by regarding the library as an educational\r\n    institution, using this term in its broadest sense.\r\n\r\n    Henry Munson Utley was born at Plymouth, Mich., Aug. 5,\r\n    1836. He served on the staff of the Detroit _Free Press_ in\r\n    1861-66, was city editor of the _Post_ and _Post-Tribune_\r\n    until 1881, and then, after holding the secretaryship of the\r\n    Detroit Board of Education, became in 1885 librarian of the\r\n    Public Library, in which post he served until his death on\r\n    Feb. 16, 1917, becoming librarian emeritus in 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are met for the seventeenth Conference of the American Library\r\nAssociation in the Capital city of the Centennial State. It is a\r\npleasing co-incidence that the Association and the State celebrate the\r\nsame natal year. Within the memory of some of us the whole region of\r\nwhich this city is now the metropolis was a wilderness. The century was\r\nfairly begun when Lieut. Pike led his little band to the sources of the\r\nArkansas and made his futile attempt to scale the lofty peak which now\r\nbears his name. Forty years later came the explorations of Fremont, and\r\nthen fifteen years elapsed before the tide of immigration set in. The\r\ndesert of that day has been converted into prosperous farms. Thriving\r\ntowns have sprung up in the mountain fastnesses, at the gateway to which\r\nsits this Queen City of the plains, displaying all the evidences of\r\nwealth, culture, and refinement to be found in the proud cities to the\r\neastward.\r\n\r\nThis rapid and wonderful transformation has been the work of human hands\r\nguided by intelligent brains and an indomitable spirit of pluck and\r\nperseverance. We are accustomed to think of this combination as purely\r\nAmerican. In many of its characteristics it certainly is so. And in no\r\nrespect more distinctively so than in the cause in which we are most\r\ninterested. Not all the older commonwealths, even on this side of the\r\nAtlantic, have yet accepted the theory that the education of the citizen\r\nis the concern of the state. But in all this newer portion of our\r\ncountry this doctrine has been incorporated into the fundamental law.\r\nThe ordinance of 1787 for the government of the territory northwest of\r\nthe Ohio river declared that for obvious reasons schools and the means\r\nof education shall be forever encouraged. The twenty states now\r\norganized within this and the subsequently acquired territory to the\r\nwestward have all accepted to the fullest extent the doctrine of the\r\nordinance. They have not only carried it into practical effect by\r\ngeneral laws providing for free public schools for children, for\r\nuniversities and institutions of higher learning for the education of\r\nyouth, but have also provided for the establishment and maintenance of\r\nfree public libraries at the general expense and for the common use of\r\nall the people.\r\n\r\nLet us consider very briefly the theory upon which the state assumes to\r\nlevy tribute upon the property of individuals to provide means for\r\nmaintaining libraries. By what right does the state tax the man of\r\nwealth to put miscellaneous books into the hands of the man who pays no\r\ntax?\r\n\r\nSo far as primary education is concerned, the basis seems clear. The\r\nfree state which depends for its very existence upon the intelligence of\r\nthe masses of its citizens must, as a measure of self-defense, provide\r\nthe facilities by which all may become intelligent. Self-preservation is\r\nthe supremest natural law. Whatever has a right to exist has a right to\r\ndo that which is necessary to preserve its existence. The free state\r\nwhich rests on the suffrage of its citizens is bound in duty to itself\r\nto see to it that popular education, which is essential to its\r\nperpetuity, is universal. Ignorant men are not competent to take care of\r\nthemselves and their households, still less to direct the destinies of\r\nan empire. The state has, therefore, the right, not only to provide the\r\nmeans of education, but to compel education. Laws are in force which\r\nrequire certain attendance upon the schools. These rest on the theory\r\nthat the interest of the state in the education of the individual\r\nsurpasses that of the individual, and therefore, the state cannot, in\r\njustice to itself, treat education purely as a matter of individual\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nIt is a notorious fact that the average person does not perceive the\r\nimportance of self-cultivation. As the vineyard left to itself is soon\r\nchoked out with weeds and chapparall, so man if left to himself lapses\r\nnaturally into his primitive condition. The state cannot leave him to\r\nhimself, but must interpose to make it certain that he acquires the best\r\ndegree of information which his natural abilities and the time not\r\nnecessary to his self-support shall permit. Neither can the state leave\r\nthe matter of providing facilities and inducements to education to\r\nprivate enterprise, nor to the church, which has been the foremost of\r\nall organizations to appreciate its importance. While the state\r\nrecognizes these agencies and accepts them as satisfactory, so far as\r\nthey go, it nevertheless fully equips schools of its own, in pursuance\r\nof its inherent right and duty, which cannot be relinquished to any\r\nother agency.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the state shall go in the matter of educating its\r\ncitizens has been the subject of much discussion. There are those who\r\nmaintain that as the education of the individual proceeds his concern in\r\nhis own development increases, until finally, if his education proceeds\r\nfar enough, his concern in his own development surpasses that of the\r\nstate, and he must thenceforth be left to equip himself entirely at his\r\nown expense. If that point is marked by the line between primary and\r\nsecondary, or between secondary and higher education, there is where the\r\nstate is in duty bound to stop. The extent of the interest of the\r\ncommunity as compared with that of the individual is held to grow less\r\nand less and finally to disappear as he advances.\r\n\r\nBut the better judgment of our time repudiates this theory, and holds\r\napparently that there is no limit to the concern of the state in the\r\nmental progress of the individual. Ian Maclaren in his touching story of\r\n\"Domsie\" quotes John Knox as saying: \"Ilka scholar is something added to\r\nthe riches of the commonwealth.\" It can probably be demonstrated by the\r\nrules of accounts that as a business investment the state is wisely\r\nspending money in the education of the people. The cost is more than\r\nreturned to it in the material development which an enlightened\r\ncitizenship ensures. If we contrast our own country, where education is\r\nfree, with some older countries where it is yet held to be a matter of\r\nminor concern, or if we contrast some of the states of this republic\r\nwith others of corresponding age, we shall see at a glance a wide\r\ndifference in material resources and prosperity. In one the industrial\r\narts are far advanced, there is intellectual activity, the average\r\ncitizen is well clothed, well housed, and enjoys many luxuries; in the\r\nother, the methods and life of a past century prevail and poverty and\r\nill-living are the rule. This, if not the highest motive, is an\r\nincidental one of considerable importance for doing at the common\r\nexpense that which is for the common good.\r\n\r\nBut the maintenance of the public library is not based on the\r\ncommunistic idea. A former president of this association, speaking at\r\nthe Lake George Conference, said: \"The socialists and communists are all\r\nfriends of the library, for we give them the books they want, and they\r\nhold that it is not only the duty of the government to educate the\r\npeople, but to furnish them with reading. If the library ever shall have\r\nenemies they will be the rich, who do not enjoy being taxed for the\r\nbenefit of the public, and have libraries of their own. Its defenders\r\nwill be men of broad views, scholarly people, and behind them, with\r\nvotes, the middle and poorer classes.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it may be true, in a certain sense, that socialists and\r\ncommunists approve the public library because it appears to give them\r\nsomething which they desire at the public cost, that scheme, on its true\r\nground, is as far removed as possible from any such theory of\r\nmaintenance by the state. The essential principle of communism is that\r\nthe members of the community shall hold their property in common for the\r\ncommon use and benefit. This principle flourished in the village\r\ncommunity in which each individual was allotted his certain proportion\r\nof the lands owned in common. There are at this day a sporadic few who\r\nadvocate government ownership of railroads, and some would even include\r\nall the great instrumentalities of commerce and production. But the\r\nrational majority hold that the state of society is best which makes the\r\nindividual a free and independent member of the community. His ambitions\r\nand energies are best stimulated by his opportunities to prosper for\r\nhimself. Civilization and enlightenment are advanced by the efforts of\r\nthe master spirits of the race. The only demand which the individual can\r\njustly make on the community, with its government as the common agent of\r\nall, is that it shall not merely protect him in his rights as a free and\r\nindependent citizen, but that it shall assure him the opportunities for\r\nthe fullest exercise of his talents, and shall also, as a measure of\r\ncommon interest, provide the facilities for his very highest mental\r\nequipment. In this latter service of the state there is nothing whatever\r\nof the communistic idea.\r\n\r\nThe public library is not a public charity. There may be some who regard\r\nit as in the nature of a free soup-house which caters to the appetite\r\nfor mental pabulum more or less wholesome. Most communities make some\r\nprovision for those who are mentally or physically unfitted to care for\r\nthemselves and who have no estate nor natural relations upon whom they\r\ncan rely for support. So the state builds and maintains hospitals and\r\nalmshouses. This it does simply as a duty of humanity. The instincts of\r\nthe race and the teachings of an enlightened civilization assure us that\r\na universal brotherhood makes all human creatures kin. As individuals we\r\nowe a certain duty to all other individuals, and as organized society we\r\nmust see to it that the welfare of all is conserved. But there is no\r\nduty of kindness or good-will which requires the furnishing of reading\r\nmatter for the use of the whole community.\r\n\r\nThe public library is not provided for the mere intellectual enjoyment\r\nof the citizens. The municipal corporation uses public funds to buy and\r\nbeautify parks and boulevards. The purpose of these is to promote the\r\npublic health and comfort, and incidentally to cultivate the aesthetic\r\nsense. The state has a direct interest in the health of its citizens. It\r\nmust rely on their physical strength for defense in time of peril or\r\ninvasion. Therefore it must have a care that their physical welfare is\r\npromoted. Wholesome food, gentle exercise, a cheerful and contented\r\nmind, have much to do with soundness of body, and so food-inspection and\r\nopen-air recreation are justified at the common expense.\r\n\r\nArt-museums and public concerts are sometimes maintained out of the\r\ngeneral treasury. The only basis on which this expense can be justified\r\nis that their purpose is educational. The welfare of the state depends\r\nnot alone on the ability of its citizens to merely read and write and\r\nsolve problems in simple arithmetic. Our nature is many-sided and its\r\nfull and perfect development must be sought in many directions. The\r\naesthetic is not less real than the practical. The finer qualities of\r\nthe mind have weightly influence upon national progress and destiny. The\r\nstate has a right to do for its citizens the things which will best\r\nserve its ultimate interests.\r\n\r\nUniversities and higher institutions of learning maintained at public\r\ncost now train those who have the means and opportunities to take\r\nadvantage of their curricula for the most advanced degrees, and through\r\ntheir post-graduate courses offer facilities for spending the good part\r\nof a lifetime in the immediate pursuit of knowledge. But in the nature\r\nof things the number of those who can give time to these higher courses\r\nis limited. The argument has sometimes been employed against high\r\nschools and universities that they are maintained at great cost for the\r\nuse of a comparatively trifling portion of the community. Statistics are\r\nquoted to show that of the whole number of children in the primary\r\ngrades less than 25 per cent. go through the grammar grades, and that of\r\nthe small number who enter the high school grades hardly one in ten\r\nfinishes them, while of these but an infinitesimal number go on to and\r\nthrough the university.\r\n\r\nIt is not due to lack of capacity wholly, or lack of interest, that so\r\nmany students fall by the wayside, but mainly to the fact that their\r\nservices are necessary in the productive channels of business. Yet, in\r\nspite of the comparatively few who are able to take advantage of them,\r\nthe state considers it a duty to foster, and the community cheerfully\r\nbears the burden of maintaining, the higher institutions of learning,\r\nbecause the benefits which they confer are easily recognized. To\r\ncompensate in some degree those who are not able to pursue in organized\r\ninstitutions studies untimely stopped by the necessities of active life,\r\nthe community provides the free library. This is the people's\r\nuniversity, close to the door of every citizen, in which all who have\r\nthe inclination and energy to do so may pursue through their whole lives\r\nthe studies which most interest them.\r\n\r\nThe function of the public library is purely and wholly educational. In\r\nthis case the term is to be construed in its most comprehensive sense.\r\nIt does not merely include development of the intellect; it involves all\r\nthe varied human relations. We owe duties to our Maker, to ourselves, to\r\nthose who are dependent upon us, to our neighbors, to society, and to\r\nthe state. In all these delicate and intricate relations we must be\r\ntaught, and as the world advances, our civilization becomes more complex\r\nand our relations more involved, the character and quality of our\r\neducation becomes the more important. The school and the college have\r\nmerely laid the foundation. If they have done their full duty they have\r\ndone little more than set the student on the high road. The sequel rests\r\nwith himself. The public library puts into his hands books, which\r\ncontain the combined wisdom and experience of all who have gone before,\r\nand wherein are preserved the best thoughts of the best men and women of\r\nall time. They who pass judgment upon what shall and what shall not be\r\nadmitted to the shelves of a public library must bear in mind that,\r\nstrictly construing the function of the library to be educational, there\r\nis yet very wide latitude in respect to the things which people may\r\nsafely and wisely learn.\r\n\r\nIn this aspect of the case, those who are charged with the management\r\nand control of libraries have imposed upon them a very grave\r\nresponsibility. They are not merely the custodians of the books which\r\nthe public purse has bought; they are commissioned to guide in the path\r\nof highest progress. In this light, the function of the librarian\r\nassumes the halo of a holy office. He who discharges it earnestly and\r\nfaithfully may do much to help forward the enlightenment of his\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the whole statement, briefly, is this: There is no limit to\r\nthe concern of the free state in the education of its citizens. It is as\r\nmuch bound to provide libraries in which the adult may continue his\r\nstudies as it is to maintain schools in which as a child he may begin\r\nthem. The day is not distant when this duly will be universally\r\nrecognized in this country. In most of the states compulsory education\r\nlaws prevail. In at least one, every town is required by law to\r\nestablish and maintain a free public library. In this respect, New\r\nHampshire is only leading the way in which others will shortly follow.\r\n\r\nThen organized society can truthfully say to the individual, in the\r\nlanguage of Professor Hoffman in his \"Sphere of the State\": \"We have\r\ndone what we could to develop and strengthen all your powers. We have\r\ntaught you to the best of our ability to know yourself and to understand\r\nyour relations to your fellows. Now, so long as you conduct yourself as\r\na child of the day and not of the night, all the rights and privileges\r\nof the brotherhood are yours. But if you choose to walk in the darkness\r\nrather than in the light, if you trample under foot our laws, if you\r\nraise your hand against every man, let the curse of your wrong doing\r\nfall upon your own head, not on ours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVES TO TAX-SUPPORT\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the case of a public library, that is, of one intended to\r\n    be used by all the members of the community, as\r\n    distinguished from a subscription library, alternatives to\r\n    public support have usually been in the nature of expedients\r\n    to tide matters over until the library could be turned over\r\n    to the municipality. The next two papers are early\r\n    discussions of some of these alternatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF NOT A TAX-SUPPORTED LIBRARY, WHAT?\r\n\r\n    The following paper contributed anonymously to _The Iowa\r\n    Library Quarterly_ (Des Moines, April, 1903) tells how local\r\n    library associations have been formed in that state, in\r\n    small towns where public support, for the moment, has been\r\n    deemed impossible or inadvisable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that a majority of the states of the Union have by legal\r\nenactment provided for free public libraries supported by tax indicates\r\nthe general acceptance of the belief that such an institution is for the\r\npublic good and its support as an educational institution is as\r\ndesirable as the support of the public schools.\r\n\r\nMore and more has it come to be recognized that if the ideals and\r\naspirations of youth are to be aroused and directed early in life by the\r\nreading of inspiring books, the state may well foster this institution\r\nwhich provides such literature.\r\n\r\nThe Code of Iowa provides that towns and cities shall have power to\r\nprovide for the foundation and maintenance of a free public library by\r\nvoting upon the question, \"Shall a free public library be established\"\r\nat a general or special election, and further providing that a tax not\r\nexceeding two mills on the dollar of the taxable valuation of such city\r\nor town may be levied for its support. This places the library on a firm\r\nfooting as a public educational institution, even though its income from\r\nthe tax may be small.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some towns in the state that find it impossible or\r\nunwise at present to secure this support of the library by a tax and\r\nhence they ask, \"If not a free public library supported by tax, what\r\nshall we attempt?\" This inquiry is practical. The desire is earnest in\r\nmany places to support a library by some other means than a tax until\r\nsuch time as sentiment will be strong enough to vote favorably upon it,\r\nhence the best method of conducting it needs to be considered.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of such a work must be made by a few, earnest people who\r\nthoroughly believe in the need of a public collection of books, not\r\nalone for the value it will be to them personally, but what it may do\r\nfor the many who are unable to own books for themselves. Club women are\r\noften the most active factors in inaugurating such a movement and\r\nsometimes the Woman's Club alone espouses the cause of the library and\r\nprovides for the purchase of books and the running expenses of the\r\nlibrary. It would seem, however, after observation of various efforts,\r\nmore or less successful, along this line, that it is much better to\r\nsecure the cooperation of all clubs and other organizations in the town,\r\nthus disarming any outside criticism or antagonism from those outside\r\nthe one club.\r\n\r\nA library association, which includes all persons in the town who are\r\ndesirous of having a public library, seems to be the better form for the\r\norganization to take, though a city federation of clubs has proven a\r\nsuccessful agency in many towns. The difficulty of providing funds for\r\nconducting such a library on an absolutely free basis is evident, but to\r\nmake membership in the association, with the payment of an annual\r\nmembership fee, the condition of borrowing is to bar from the use of the\r\nbooks the people who need them most.\r\n\r\nIn organizing a library association it will be necessary to decide what\r\nthe policy is to be in this respect. Shall the library be solely for\r\nthose who join the association and pay this fee, or shall this be an\r\naltruistic movement for the betterment of the town, making the use of\r\nthe books free to all? If the latter plan is decided upon it will be\r\nnecessary to provide by subscription of citizens or by entertainments\r\nand otherwise, a larger fund for the support of the library, and such an\r\nundertaking should be well considered for it often becomes burdensome.\r\n\r\nIf an association is formed with an annual membership fee which entitles\r\nthe member to the use of the books, those who feel unable to pay this\r\nannual fee may be loaned books upon the payment of a small fee for the\r\nloan of a single book.\r\n\r\nThe reading room feature is of great importance and whatever plan may\r\nbe adopted regarding the loan of the books for home use there is no\r\nreason why the use of the reading room, the periodicals and the books in\r\nthe room should not be absolutely free to all who will come there to use\r\nthem. To make the reading room the brightest and most attractive spot in\r\ntown for the boys who are inclined to be on the street of evenings is a\r\npossibility for any library association, if a few earnest women will\r\ngive time and effort toward this end.\r\n\r\nThe actual expenses incurred in such a venture are room rent, furniture,\r\nheat, light, services of a librarian and the purchase of books and\r\nperiodicals, but a systematic effort to interest the people of the town\r\noften results in the donation of the use of a room and the other\r\nnecessities. It is not desirable to solicit donation of books. The\r\nrandom inclination of people to pass on to the public library books they\r\ndo not care for on their own library shelves is damaging to the library\r\nreceiving them. In another column the report of the Audubon Club\r\nmentions this point. The books should be selected with the greatest\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThe most important feature of such an enterprise is to have some one in\r\ncharge of the room who shall be suited to the work,--a woman of culture\r\nand character, of pleasing manners and one who loves children and\r\ndelights in aiding readers. Such a librarian gives an \"atmosphere\" to\r\nthe whole undertaking.\r\n\r\nIn many towns club women and others who are interested have volunteered\r\nto serve as librarians, without compensation, and if a head librarian is\r\nselected to whom these volunteer workers shall report and who is\r\nresponsible for the work, this arrangement seems a good one until such\r\ntime as funds will permit of the employment of a paid librarian.\r\n\r\nAt Audubon, Exira, Glenwood, Guthrie Center, Laurens, Leon, Tama and\r\nother places in the state, the women are most courageously carrying on\r\nthis work, with the hope that the town will eventually take the\r\nresponsibility off their shoulders by voting a tax to support the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nIf any attempt has been made to vote a municipal tax and it has failed,\r\nor if there seems to be little sentiment in favor of the measure, there\r\nis no need to feel disheartened. A beginning may be made by securing a\r\ntravelling library of 50 volumes from the Library Commission at Des\r\nMoines, without other cost than transportation, and these books, may be\r\nexchanged for a similar collection every 3 months, thus making 200\r\nvolumes accessible during the year.\r\n\r\nThis collection with the few books the local association is able to buy\r\nand a few good magazines should make it possible to open the room for\r\nreading and the issue of books two afternoons and evenings each\r\nweek--preferably Wednesday and Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe small beginning will gather to itself strength if the workers are\r\npersistent; the collection of books will increase, sentiment will grow\r\nmore favorable and eventually the movement will be popular.\r\n\r\nIn making such a beginning the Iowa Library Commission should be called\r\nupon for the use of the traveling library, form of constitution and\r\nby-laws, book lists and other printed matter, and the secretary will be\r\nglad to render any assistance possible in forwarding such an enterprise\r\nin any town in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARY AND COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n    A paper that originally appeared in _The Springfield\r\n    Republican_, Dec. 1, 1899, and was reprinted in Home\r\n    Education Bulletin No. 31 of the University of the State of\r\n    New York. The author, Miss M. Anna Tarbell of Brimfield,\r\n    Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of the word cooperation in connection with the public library\r\nimplies that the library is not simply a collection of books, that it is\r\nnot a passive institution, a repository of treasure, but an active\r\ninstitution reaching out to bestow benefits. The library spirit means\r\nnot only cooperating with all uplifting forces in the community, but\r\ncreating and stimulating such forces. The library spirit seeks to carry\r\nbrightness into gray and toilworn lives, to give broad vision in place\r\nof the narrow and distorted view, to awaken generous sympathies and\r\nnoble thoughts in place of sordid desires and petty interests. Imbued\r\nwith this spirit, the librarian will be a lover of humankind,\r\nsympathetic, earnest, self-sacrificing, a true missionary, enthusiastic\r\nwithal and eager to seize upon ways and means by which the library may\r\nmore and more be made to enrich human life. But however abundant in\r\nresources the library, and however zealous and efficient the librarian,\r\nthere is a limit to the work that can be accomplished on the library\r\nside for the promotion of intellectual life and general culture. There\r\nneeds to be a larger and more intelligent demand on the community side\r\nfor the supply which the library offers. To stimulate this demand there\r\nis needed the cooperation of those people and those institutions in the\r\ncommunity that possess special opportunities for increasing the use and\r\ninfluence of the library, or in any way making human life wiser, better\r\nand happier. This cooperation may be both direct and indirect, since all\r\nculture influences are by nature cooperative with that of the library. I\r\nshall dwell specially on the need of stimulating cooperation on the side\r\nof the community, for the reason that the library has already taken the\r\ninitiative, and because library privileges are so abundant in\r\nMassachusetts, so freely offered and eagerly extended, without a\r\nproportionate response to these privileges on the part of the public.\r\n\r\nWhile dwelling most upon the importance of its educational influences, I\r\nwould not underrate the province of the library in providing\r\nentertainment and recreation, which have their culture value. But the\r\nfollowing are impressive words from the editor of the New England\r\nmagazine in its current number: \"Education in a democracy is so\r\nfundamental that education may almost be looked upon as another way of\r\nspelling democracy.\" \"We are to consider more carefully the educational\r\nfunction of everything which affects the mind of the people: the church,\r\nthe newspaper, the library, the platform.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering cooperation with the library on the part of individuals, we\r\nnaturally think first of those who are connected with the library by\r\nvirtue of their office, namely, the library trustees. The trustees have\r\nspecial opportunities for increasing the use and usefulness of the\r\nlibrary on account of their acquaintance with, and influence upon, the\r\nlibrary on one hand, and their daily intercourse with the public on the\r\nother. There has so far come to my notice such assistance by the\r\ntrustees as inviting people, specially newcomers, to the library,\r\ncarrying books to outlying schools, personal assistance in the library\r\nand collecting historical material for preservation in the library. It\r\nis true that the literal requirements of the office of library trustee\r\nare only those of a conservative nature, just as the duties of the\r\nlibrarian were formerly considered to be those of the careful custodian,\r\nbut as the library spirit gains ground and the conception of the library\r\nas an active mission grows, we may look forward to the day when every\r\ntown will be sure of having six or nine persons, as the case may be, not\r\nonly engaged in improving the character of the library, but in promoting\r\nits increased and more effective use, a standing committee for the\r\nculture interests of the town. This cooperation will be promoted by\r\ntrustees attending the meetings of library clubs, joining the clubs and\r\nassisting them, as well as by giving the librarian every encouragement\r\nto do so, such as granting leave of absence and possibly paying\r\nexpenses. The _Library journal_ and _Public libraries_ should be on the\r\nsubscription list of every library, and trustees as well as librarian\r\nneed to keep informed of progress in the library world.\r\n\r\nThere are other people in every town who would be willing to assist in\r\nthe work of the library, or help people to get books or encourage more\r\nand better reading if asked to do so by the librarian. To seek out such\r\npersons, then, is the duty and opportunity of the librarian in this work\r\nof cooperation. Suggestions regarding \"Volunteer aids in library work\"\r\nare admirably given in the report of the state library commission for\r\nthis year in the bound volume, _Public libraries of Massachusetts_, and\r\nshould be read by librarians and trustees and shown to all patrons of\r\nthe library who are available for assistance.\r\n\r\nSurely the home should cooperate with the library by the example of the\r\nreading habit, and by the direction of the reading of the children;\r\nwhile it would be an excellent thing for parents to pursue lines of\r\nreading that would keep them in touch with the children's studies. As it\r\nis, I fear librarians will bear out the recent statement of a school\r\nsupervisor that \"The home is not even inclined to supervise the\r\nchildren's reading, and, the selection of books being left largely to\r\nthemselves, many boys and girls read books not proper for them to read.\"\r\n\r\nThe church, the school and the library are institutions which naturally\r\nconstitute a triple alliance. Cooperation between the library and the\r\nschools, which has received so much consideration and is being so\r\nrapidly developed, I need not dwell upon. But there is need for\r\nincreased cooperation between the church and the library. This\r\ncooperation should be both direct and indirect. Ministers should feel a\r\nresponsibility for the intellectual, as well as spiritual, welfare of\r\nthe people. They should show that intelligence and breadth of mind make\r\na better and more efficient Christian, and that the church will become a\r\ngreater power if its members read and think. The minister has had\r\nspecial privileges for his own culture, and he has peculiar\r\nopportunities for recommending books, guiding library taste, and\r\ndirectly increasing the use of the library. There should be some kind of\r\nstudy club connected with every church, and those young people who have\r\nfinished their school course should be taught their moral obligation to\r\ncultivate their God-given mental powers and grow in intelligence and\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nTo advance the special interests of the church along intellectual\r\nlines, the library should be provided with books that will improve\r\nSunday school work, aid in the study of the Bible, and the growth of\r\nintelligence on religious subjects. It should be provided with up to\r\ndate histories of Bible times in the light of archeological discoveries,\r\nwith works of modern reverent scholarship concerning the Bible, and\r\nbooks which record the development of religious thought. Much excellent\r\nstudy is being done by members of the women's missionary societies. It\r\nis very desirable that these women cooperate with the librarian in the\r\nselection of standard works revealing conditions in the countries\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nAmong organizations, women's clubs have probably done the most to assist\r\nlibrary interests. This is especially true in some of the western\r\nstates, notably in Wisconsin. Literary and other study clubs which\r\nprevail in New England are certainly in their nature cooperative with\r\nthe library, while they might be of more direct assistance to it. The\r\nlibrary, of course, should give these societies all possible\r\nencouragement and help. The clubs will react favorably on the library in\r\ncreating a demand for books which will improve the character of the\r\naccessions to the library. Where a study club does not exist, the\r\nlibrarian should help to form one. It is possible that there is a\r\ntendency to exclusiveness in women's literary clubs. If the number limit\r\nkeeps out those desirous of joining, or those who need encouragement in\r\nliterary interest, a branch club for their benefit should be formed.\r\nBesides working for their own improvement, the members of study clubs\r\nshould have a missionary spirit and should feel a responsibility for the\r\nintellectual welfare of the town. A woman's literary club is capable of\r\nbeing a strong ally of the public library.\r\n\r\nThe newly developing local history societies and the public library are\r\nnaturally allied, and promise to be of increasing mutual benefit. The\r\nlibrary should buy town histories and books needed by the historical\r\nsociety, while the latter will contribute to the library records, maps\r\nand published memorials. Further, the historical society, by sustaining\r\nlectures in which the principles of colonial development are illustrated\r\nby local annals, should develop a perception and interest which will be\r\nmanifested in a demand for volumes of history now lying dusty on the\r\nlibrary shelves.\r\n\r\nThe grange is another organization whose objects affiliate it with the\r\nlibrary, since the grange movement is an important culture movement.\r\nThere is opportunity for more active cooperation between the library and\r\nthe grange. The grange, and also the farmers' clubs, should be asked to\r\nrecommend the best works upon agriculture, while the lecturer of the\r\ngrange and the committee of the farmers' clubs should confer in advance\r\nwith the librarian as to material needed in carrying out their literary\r\nprograms. More than one other organization might be mentioned which\r\nwould help the library and be helped by it through increased\r\ncooperation, thereby extending the influence of both. It is the sense of\r\nobligation and responsibility that needs to grow.\r\n\r\nThe public press is an agency which certainly ought to be a firm ally of\r\nthe public library, cooperating with it directly and indirectly.\r\nNewspapers should be ever ready to give space to any matter that will\r\nbring the library to the attention of the public, and they should also\r\nkeep the public informed of progress in library interests. Deeper than\r\nthis, the press should constantly exemplify and teach culture ideals,\r\nthe true mission of journalism.\r\n\r\nThe hope of stimulating greater cooperation between the community and\r\nthe public library seems to me to lie largely in the library club or,\r\nbetter, library association, movement. First, local library clubs should\r\nincrease in number, becoming more truly local, thus exerting a stronger\r\ninfluence upon the libraries in the section represented and coming into\r\ncloser relation with the community. The membership should include people\r\nwho are neither librarians nor trustees, but whose sense of\r\nresponsibility will be awakened as their interest is increased. The\r\ndistrict represented should not be so large as to prevent meetings being\r\nfrequently held in the same vicinity. These local clubs should be in\r\nclose relation with the state club or association, and the state library\r\ncommission. The local clubs will do the actual close work, while having\r\nthe support, advice and assistance of the state club and state\r\ncommission. The local clubs will give information as to conditions and\r\nneeds, and will be agencies for the application of progressive ideas.\r\nThe study of conditions, of what may be called the environment of\r\nlibraries, comes within the province of library-club work. The study of\r\nthe conditions and needs of the small towns and rural communities is of\r\nleading importance. From what other source except from the library\r\nmovement with a greater development of its possibilities is help for\r\nthose towns to come? The initiative in personal effort to give\r\nadvantages for want of which some of the small towns are suffering has\r\nbeen taken by the women's education association in the loan of their\r\ntraveling libraries accompanied by personal visits and the study of\r\nconditions and needs.\r\n\r\nBut there is another want besides that of books in the small villages\r\nand towns. There is needed not only the printed page, but the speaking\r\nvoice, the influence of personality through lectures. A story from\r\nexperience will illustrate this need. A few years ago there was held in\r\nour town an exhibition of antiquities which awakened intense interest on\r\nthe part of old and young. This interest made a good opportunity for the\r\nstudy of colonial history, which a few of us carried on. Certain books\r\nnot in our library were needed, although the library is a good one and\r\nwell equipped in American history. Our want came to the knowledge of\r\nMiss Chandler, chairman of the library committee of the woman's\r\neducation association, and out of this grew, another year, a special\r\nlibrary lent to us upon American history which formed a valuable\r\nsupplement to the works contained in our library in that department. At\r\nboth times, when we had the exhibition and when we received the\r\ntraveling library (which we still possess, having bought the books) I\r\nrealized the opportunity and need of lectures. What a strong combination\r\nthe group would have made--the exhibition, the working library, a\r\nlecture course. This would have been in reality an adaptation of the\r\nidea of university extension, which I believe could be developed by the\r\nlibrary club movement. Each town would have its standing library\r\ncommittee composed of members of the local library club, and several\r\ntowns in the district represented by the club would form a convenient\r\ncircuit. But if this scheme, which I believe to be feasible, can not be\r\nimmediately developed or applied, there should be no delay on the part\r\nof those interested in library work in Massachusetts in considering some\r\nplan of promoting popular education, the leading object today of library\r\nwork, through lectures of some kind, if not sustained courses having\r\ncontinuity of subject.\r\n\r\nTwo difficulties meet this need of lectures in the smaller and poorer\r\ntowns and in many villages, that of the expense of securing the best\r\ntalent (and nothing short of excellent ability will serve), and that of\r\nknowing where to find available speakers. The last difficulty can be met\r\nby organizing a committee who will search out those who can be secured\r\nto speak under the auspices of the libraries of the small towns. A plan\r\nfor bringing the expense within the means of the people of those towns\r\nmight also be developed. One source of help might be found in the\r\nincrease of the powers of the state library commission. In Wisconsin the\r\nefficiency and powers of the state commission have been extended by the\r\npassage of a bill through the legislature increasing the appropriation\r\nawarded the commission and adding to its duties. The commission is\r\nempowered to hold library institutes in various parts of the state, and\r\nto encourage the growth of study clubs connected with the traveling\r\nlibraries. To carry out the duties of the commission, among which is\r\nmentioned \"to aid in building up a better system of popular education,\"\r\nthe additional sum of $3500 is awarded to the commission. Why should not\r\nMassachusetts aid in building up a better system of popular education by\r\nhelping to provide speakers for the smaller villages and towns where\r\nneeded, thus supplementing and aiding the work of the public libraries?\r\nIt is possible that a beginning could be made through the establishment\r\nof library institutes. If it should be considered wise to establish\r\nlibrary institutes in this state, as important a feature of them as\r\ninstruction in library matters would be lectures for the public on\r\nliterary and educational subjects of a popular nature. The first step to\r\nbe taken is for a committee representing the three existing library\r\nclubs and the Massachusetts library commission to consider what plans\r\nare most feasible, not only for the improvement of library work, but\r\nalso for increasing the intelligent and effective use of the library by\r\ncreating new ideals of popular education in the community, and thus\r\nbring about cooperation in its deepest sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOARDS OF TRUSTEES\r\n\r\n\r\n    A board of trustees, or of directors or commissioners, is\r\n    the representative of the community in its control of the\r\n    library and in the formal service rendered by the community\r\n    to the library. The relationship was familiar in other\r\n    public institutions at the time that public libraries began\r\n    to be established, and its duties, responsibilities and\r\n    limitations in this instance were regarded as being the same\r\n    as in others. They were therefore not widely discussed, and\r\n    the work of library trusteeship is still too little\r\n    systematized.\r\n\r\n    The Trustees' Section of the A.L.A., founded in order that\r\n    Library trustees might gather yearly to discuss their\r\n    peculiar problems, has always been scantily attended. The\r\n    Indiana Trustees Association is the only prosperous body of\r\n    the kind in the United States, but its success might well\r\n    prove suggestive to library trustees in other states. The\r\n    three following papers were all read at a single library\r\n    conference in 1890, which may show that there was then some\r\n    degree of awakening to the necessity for discussing this\r\n    phase of library administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARY WORK FROM THE TRUSTEES' STANDPOINT\r\n\r\n    A few first principles by the president of the Board of what\r\n    was at that time the St. Louis Public School Library, since\r\n    1893 the St. Louis Public Library. The Rev. Mr. Learned read\r\n    this paper at the Fabyan's Conference of the American\r\n    Library Association, in 1890.\r\n\r\n    John Calvin Learned was born in Dublin, N.H., Aug. 7, 1834.\r\n    He engaged in teaching, went to Missouri in 1856 and in 1859\r\n    entered Harvard Divinity School. After graduation he was\r\n    pastor of a Unitarian church in Exeter, N.H., and in 1870\r\n    took charge of the newly-organized Church of the Unity in\r\n    St. Louis where he remained until his death, Dec. 8, 1893.\r\n    He was a member of the Board of Managers of the Public\r\n    School Library from 1884 to 1892 and its president for half\r\n    that period.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old play has it that \"trustees are not to be trifled with\" and, as\r\nthey are not only allowed but invited to come among the librarians to\r\nassert their rights and their authority, why should they not do it\r\nvigorously? Did they not originate the librarian? \"Shall the thing\r\nformed say to him that formed it, 'Why hast thou made me thus?'\"\r\n\r\nYet to assume such creative power must load us down with\r\nresponsibilities--greater, I fear, than some of us have joyfully\r\naccepted. In fact, do not trustees incline, as a rule, to throw too much\r\nof the burden of library administration upon the librarian? If the\r\nincumbent of this office is fairly willing and capable, is he not\r\nsuffered to do pretty much as he pleases, except it may be with regard\r\nto such large measures as the construction of buildings and the\r\nmanagement of investments?\r\n\r\nProportioned to the authority of trustees, however, is their\r\nresponsibility. To whom much is given, of them much is required. And the\r\nposition of the better sort of trustee valuable to the best work of the\r\nlibrarian, is not that sinecure seat sometimes depicted. He must\r\nconstantly stand as the able and ready advisor of the librarian, and for\r\nthe honor and defence of the library. He will be made the court of\r\nultimate appeal in many matters, both practical and curious. He will\r\nreceive letters from all sorts of people, some with gifts in their\r\nhands, and some with complaints on their lips; some seeking favors,\r\npossible and impossible. Col. Higginson's humorous way, recently, of\r\nintroducing Phillips Brooks as the man whom nobody in the Cambridge\r\nlibrary could find out the height of, until at last the inquiry was\r\nbrought to him as trustee to answer, may illustrate the point.\r\n\r\nLately an article in one of the English reviews treats of the \"Perils of\r\nTrustees.\" And while no statute makes us responsible,--as innocent\r\nparties were held to be under British law, in the failure of the Glasgow\r\nBank,--yet the library trustee carries risks, both moral and financial,\r\nand the place should be offered to none who will not give it a\r\n_bonafide_ service. There is no room for a mere figure-head or\r\nornamental name on a working library board. Every member of a directory,\r\nrightly organized, should take his share in the administration, and have\r\nsome knowledge of what goes on in the library world.\r\n\r\nIt is true there have been instances where some ambitious and\r\nirrepressible spirit has exceeded his official duties and privileges;\r\nhas been disposed to dictate the whole policy of the library, reducing\r\nthe librarian's office to that of a mere secretary. I knew a director in\r\na large library who resigned because he could not buy the books and\r\nwrite all the reports. He hungered for more to do. But I have known more\r\nthan one to keep himself as far away from the board as possible, after\r\none or two sessions of three or four hours each, in the necessary\r\ndeliberations of the book committee.\r\n\r\nEdward Everett Hale says that the great essential for the directors or\r\ntrustees of any institution is, that they \"keep their end in sight,\" as\r\nDr. Watt's hymn reads. If it is an institution to help old women, or\r\nsave poor children, or find situations for the idle, does it really do\r\nit? Or is it so taken up with the mechanism of the concern, so absorbed\r\nand happy over methods and details, that it loses sight of the object?\r\nThis is especially to be considered in the management of a public\r\nlibrary. What is the library for? Is it accomplishing its work? Is it\r\ndoing its utmost to promote the virtue, refinement, and intelligence of\r\nthe community?\r\n\r\nA library may be likened to a bank where literary reserves are kept. It\r\nis organized to promote the circulation of a sound literary currency.\r\nThe directors must see to it that, though there may be counterfeit and\r\nworthless money in the vaults, the cashier or librarian must pay over\r\nthe counter for general circulation such only as will maintain the\r\ninstitution's standard of credit and confidence in the community. The\r\ngold basis must be maintained, and no \"wild-cat\" bills pass out through\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nIt grows increasingly evident that very few libraries in the world can\r\nindulge in the luxury or licence of buying all books written. The\r\nambition to supply any man with any work he calls for must therefore be\r\nheld in check. Thus it becomes increasingly important that much care and\r\ndeliberation be exercised in the choice of books to be bought, whether\r\nto complete deficient departments or for the daily circulation. The\r\npurchase of poor books makes a market for poor authorship. Hereafter,\r\nless than ever should libraries be the dumping place for indiscreet\r\npublishers, for questionable or incompetent authors. The public library\r\nexists for civilization, that is, for moral ends. It is the record and\r\nhistory of civilization, as well as the ally of progress. It is the\r\n\"friend and helper of all those who seek to live in the spirit.\" For\r\nthis reason, therefore, the character of the books in a library is of\r\nmore importance than mere numbers; and the value of a library to the\r\ncommunity may be imperfectly shown by the statistics of circulation. No\r\naim can be higher, however, than having a good library, to make its\r\nresources known, and to multiply readers in the remotest and obscurest\r\nparts of our towns and cities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrustees of Free Public Libraries\r\n\r\n    In introducing this topic, Mr. C.C. Soule, who spoke as a\r\n    trustee of the Brookline Public Library, said that he had\r\n    found little or nothing about it in existing library\r\n    literature, and that his paper had been shown to a\r\n    considerable number of both trustees and librarians and\r\n    modified in accordance with their views. His analysis of the\r\n    subject is somewhat closer than President Learned's.\r\n\r\n    Charles Carroll Soule was born in Boston June 25, 1842 and\r\n    graduated at Harvard in 1862. After serving in the Civil\r\n    War, which he left as a captain of Massachusetts volunteers\r\n    he became a publisher and after 1889 was president of the\r\n    Boston Book Co. He was an active member of the American\r\n    Library Association. He died at his home in Brookline, Jan.\r\n    7, 1913\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper considers the constitution of elective boards of trustees of\r\nfree public libraries, intrusted with the appointment of librarians and\r\nfull control of their libraries.\r\n\r\nThe subject can be naturally treated under the following heads: Size of\r\nthe board; term of office; qualifications for the position; duties;\r\nindividual and collective; organization; and relations with the\r\nlibrarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SIZE OF THE BOARD\r\n\r\nThe weight of opinion seems to be in favor of small boards; and in\r\nsmall towns, where the duties are light, three trustees will usually\r\nwork more harmoniously and effectively than a larger number. But in\r\nlarge towns and cities a more numerous board has two advantages--there\r\nis more chance of securing among its members one or two men who are\r\nexceptionally active, intelligent, judicious, and interested in library\r\nscience; and the board may be more thoroughly representative of\r\ndifferent sections of the town and different elements in the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. TERM OF OFFICE\r\n\r\nThe usual and undoubtedly the best composition of a board of library\r\ntrustees is to divide it into groups, one group going out of office each\r\nyear. This provision secures stability by preventing sudden changes of\r\nthe whole board by intrigue or popular caprice, and is intended to allow\r\nopportunity for gradual change whenever it is needed.\r\n\r\nBut does this provision alone insure sufficient change to prevent\r\nstagnation? The position of trustee of a library is so pleasant and\r\nhonorable, that the incumbent may wish to retain it indefinitely. The\r\nmen selected as trustees may be personally so worthy and popular that\r\ntheir townsmen are reluctant to retire them compulsorily, even when the\r\nfeeling is prevalent that others might serve more acceptably. To effect\r\na change under such circumstances requires an effort approaching\r\nrevolution, with danger of that discord and bad feeling which are so\r\nunfortunate in library management.\r\n\r\nWould it not be wise, in view of this possible danger, to follow the\r\nexample of the graduates of Harvard College in electing overseers, and\r\nprovide by law that no trustee shall hold office for more than (say)\r\nthree successive terms of three years, or nine years in all? While a\r\nlibrary might thus lose occasionally an active and efficient trustee\r\n(who could still be reelected after being only a year out of office),\r\nwould it not gain much more than it could lose, in keeping that close\r\ncontact with popular needs and with new ideas, which is so healthy and\r\nstimulating in the management of all public institutions?\r\n\r\n\r\n3. QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE POSITION\r\n\r\nThe ideal qualifications for a trustee of a public library (a fair\r\neducation and love of books being taken for granted) might be summarized\r\nsomewhat thus:--\r\n\r\nSound character; good judgement and common-sense; public spirit;\r\ncapacity for work; literary taste; representative fitness.\r\n\r\nMen of character and position in the community are usually selected as\r\ntrustees; but it may be assumed somewhat too confidently that, because a\r\nman has been prominent in political or business or social circles, he\r\nwill make a good trustee. It is a mistake to put in such a position any\r\nman who has outlived his public spirit and energy.\r\n\r\nLibrary taste is placed low on this list of qualifications, because in\r\nany administrative position, even in connection with a library, capacity\r\nand willingness to work, united with common-sense and a fair education,\r\nare much more useful than a taste for literature without the practical\r\nqualities. And of the different grades of literary taste, general\r\nculture and a wide range of reading are generally more serviceable to a\r\npublic library than the knowledge of the scholar or the specialist.\r\n\r\nIn selecting men of prominence for trustees, there is danger of\r\nexcluding too rigidly the younger men who might contribute to the\r\nstrength and efficiency of the board. There is so much activity and\r\nprogress in the library work of this generation, that the adage \"Old men\r\nfor counsel, young men for action\" is not wholly inapplicable to the\r\nchoice of trustees, whose work requires counsel and action in nearly\r\nequal degrees.\r\n\r\nWith a large board it would seem wise to select members with some\r\nreference to representation of different sections of the town, and\r\ndifferent occupations, interests, or nationalities among the\r\ninhabitants. This tends to prevent dissatisfaction, and to adapt the\r\npurchase of books and the general policy of the library to the needs of\r\nthe whole community, rather than to the wishes of special classes.\r\n\r\nNeither politics nor religious opinion should of course enter into the\r\nchoice of library trustees, except so far as it is unwise to constitute\r\na board exclusively from one party or one denomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DUTIES, INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE\r\n\r\nAs an individual, the trustee of a public library ought to realize that\r\nhe holds a high and sacred trust from the people; that he has been\r\nelected to preserve and extend the privileges and benefits afforded by\r\nthe library in its modern development as \"The People's University\"; that\r\nlibrary science is not to be comprehended by intuition, but can be\r\nlearned only by intelligent observation and study; and that he has no\r\nright to accept or hold the position unless he can take a lively\r\ninterest in the library, be constant in attendance at meetings and\r\ndiligent in committee work, keep himself informed of the current library\r\nideas by reading every number of the _Library journal_, and, if\r\npossible, by visiting other libraries than his own, and watch keenly the\r\ntastes and requirements of the constituency he represents.\r\n\r\nThe collective duties of the board includes the care of investments and\r\nfunds, the careful and economical supervision of expenditures, the\r\ndetermination of the policy of the library toward the public and in its\r\ninterior administration, the general direction of the choice and\r\npurchase of books, the selection of the librarian and his assistants,\r\nconstant and critical observation of their work, occasional reckoning up\r\nof work done and progress made, comparison of results with those reached\r\nin other libraries, as a confirmation of merits and a corrective for\r\nerrors, and such active work of detail as will assist the librarian in\r\nperforming his duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nA large board ordinarily transacts business through a chairman, a\r\nsecretary, a treasurer, and one or more committees.\r\n\r\nThe chairman has few active duties, but the position requires judgment\r\nin appointing committees, and tact in conducting meetings. The place is\r\nperhaps the highest public honor in small towns, and is usually and\r\nproperly given to some trustee eminent for character and public\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Perkins's article, \"How to make Town Libraries Successful,\" in\r\nthe \"Government Report of 1876 on Public Libraries,\" it is suggested\r\nthat the librarian should act as secretary to the board of trustees;\r\nbut, aside from the fact he usually has more than enough work to do in\r\nhis own department, is it not at least doubtful whether an official,\r\nwhose conduct may at any time be a proper subject for confidential\r\ndiscussion before the board, should serve as their secretary, and so be\r\nobliged to be present throughout all meetings? The duties of a secretary\r\nmay properly provide occupation for some member of the board.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer, if he holds funds in his hands, should always be put\r\nunder bond. No matter how trustworthy he may be, it is a sound principal\r\nthat no official should handle public money without giving bond. His\r\nsuccessor may not be so careful or so honest, and, unless the precedent\r\nis established while the danger of loss seems small, it will be\r\ndifficult and invidious to insist upon a bond when occasion may require\r\nit. If no trustee is willing to accept the position of treasurer with\r\nbond, it is usually possible to leave the library funds in the hands of\r\nthe already bonded town treasurer, and draw on them as needed to pay\r\nbills.\r\n\r\nAs to committees, it is better to have as many as can actively be\r\nemployed, in order to enlist the cooperation or advice of every trustee.\r\nIn large boards, even with small libraries, four standing committees can\r\nfind occupation; namely, executive, book, finance, and progress.\r\n\r\nThe executive committee can take charge of the daily work of the\r\nlibrary, of purchases, and of the care of the building. They should be\r\nefficient men, with prompt business habits, with an active interest in\r\nthe library, with leisure to attend to their duties during library\r\nhours, and with sufficient discretion to sift and formulate business to\r\nbe presented at the meetings of the trustees. While discharging their\r\nexecutive duties promptly and thoroughly, they ought to be careful not\r\nto assume too much of the power and responsibility which properly belong\r\nto the full board, whose will they are appointed to execute.\r\n\r\n[In very large libraries, these duties of an executive committee are\r\nsometimes subdivided among additional committees on building and\r\ngrounds, on purchase of supplies, on reading-room and so on, as\r\ndifferent departments increase in importance.]\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the range of reading, the literary taste, and the critical\r\nfaculty, which qualify a man to select books for popular use, are not\r\nnecessarily united with executive ability, it will often be best to\r\nintrust the choice of books to a book committee, selected for that\r\npurpose alone. This is a sufficiently important duty to occupy all the\r\nspare time of a committee, even where the initiative is taken by the\r\nlibrarian, and appeal on doubtful points is made to the full board.\r\n\r\nThe duties of a finance committee are often confined to a perfunctory\r\nand occasional examination of accounts, but they may be made very\r\nimportant. To make and watch investments, to provide that money on\r\ndeposit shall always draw the best interest, to see that purchases of\r\nbooks and supplies are made on the most favorable terms, to keep close\r\nwatch on all the controllable expenditures, to examine and verify bills,\r\nand to audit carefully the treasurer's accounts, will give full\r\nemployment to a good committee of business men.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these obviously useful committees, there is another,--a\r\n\"Committee on Library Progress\"--which often serves to increase the\r\nactivity and efficiency of the library. Constituted from among the\r\nyounger or more active men, and from those trustees who can find\r\nopportunity for visiting other libraries, such a committee can do good\r\nwork in watching the experiments made elsewhere; in placing before the\r\nboard information in regard to improved methods of library work; in\r\ncomparing the library with other libraries similarly situated; and in\r\nencouraging their own librarian, if he be progressive, or in stimulating\r\nhim, if too conservative. In short such a committee, if both active and\r\nwise, could keep even the smallest town library in the full tide of\r\nmodern progress.\r\n\r\nIt will be best not to leave too much discretion or power permanently to\r\nany committee, but to require all committees to report their acts and\r\nplans frequently for the approval or criticism of the full board.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. RELATIONS WITH THE LIBRARIAN\r\n\r\nThe relations of the trustees with the librarian will vary greatly\r\naccording to circumstances. Some general principals may be suggested,\r\nsubject always to \"the exceptions which prove the rule.\"\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it should be borne in mind that the trustees are the\r\nresponsible managers of the library, and that so far as they chose to\r\nact, the librarian is only their agent, bound in honor to carry out\r\ntheir wishes promptly, thoroughly, and cheerfully.\r\n\r\nIf they are fortunate enough, however, to have a first-class librarian,\r\nwith superior ability, training, knowledge, energy, wisdom, and tact,\r\nthe trustees ought to leave the management of the library practically to\r\nhim, working only to lighten his labors and strengthen his hands.\r\n\r\nBut if--as sometimes may happen--the librarian has human limitations,\r\nand while strong in some directions is weak in others, it is the part of\r\nthe trustees to try to supplement, without impeding, his abilities. If,\r\nafter ascertaining his limitations, they decide that he is the best\r\nlibrarian that they can get, under the circumstances of the case they\r\nshould note in what lines he needs help, and select for committees the\r\ntrustees best fitted to do the part of library work which he cannot\r\nsatisfactorily perform.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the librarian has executive ability, it will be wise for\r\nthe trustees to let him control the selection, management, and dismissal\r\nof all his assistants; if he has good judgement and what may be called\r\n\"the librarian's faculty,\" it will be wise to let him arrange the\r\nmethods and details of library work; if he has literary taste, it will\r\nbe especially wise to allow him at least the initiative in the choice\r\nand purchase of books, for he has (or ought to have) constant contact\r\nwith the public and an intelligent knowledge of their wants.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not be considered best for the librarian to act as their\r\nsecretary, the trustees should take him into their confidence, consult\r\nhim freely, and invite his presence during some part of each board\r\nmeeting and of all committee meetings where his advice might be of\r\nservice. The librarian can properly reciprocate by allowing the board\r\nand the committees frequent opportunities for private conference and\r\n\"executive session,\" unembarrassed by his presence.\r\n\r\nIn brief, while the trustees cannot forget that they control both\r\nlibrary and librarian, they should remember that the librarian is chosen\r\nto be their expert advisor and their executive officer, and, so long as\r\nhe fills these positions satisfactorily, they ought not to hamper or\r\ninterfere with, so much as to assist and sustain him by their actions.\r\n\r\nThe relations of an active librarian with an active board of trustees\r\ndemand discretion and consideration on both sides. But if the librarian\r\nis sensible, and not too sensitive, and the trustees are reasonably\r\nharmonious and judicious, the cooperation herein outlined may be carried\r\nout with success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUTIES OF TRUSTEES AND THEIR RELATIONS TO LIBRARIANS\r\n\r\n    Although Mr. S.S. Green says that he has prepared this paper\r\n    \"from the standpoint of a librarian,\" he is competent to\r\n    speak from that of a trustee also, for he served as both,\r\n    having been a trustee of the Worcester Public Library for\r\n    some time when he was chosen its librarian. A sketch of\r\n    Samuel Swett Green will be found in Vol I. of this series.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the symposium in which we are now engaged, I understand that I am to\r\nconsider the subject which we are talking about from the standpoint of a\r\nlibrarian.\r\n\r\nThe position can be stated in a few words.\r\n\r\nA librarian should be regarded as holding relations to his trustees\r\nsimilar to those held by the agent of a factory or the cashier of a bank\r\nto the governing board of the factory or bank.\r\n\r\nSome cashiers and some agents have more power than others. The power\r\nconferred depends upon the knowledge, training, experience, industry,\r\nenterprise, good judgment, and ability of persons holding such\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nIf the board of trustees of a library is more competent to manage its\r\naffairs than the librarian, and if it is ready to give the time that is\r\nnecessary to the discharge of the duties of management, it has a perfect\r\nright to do so, and the librarian need then only be a clerk.\r\n\r\nSo, too, if on any board of directors there is one man of leisure who\r\nhas especial qualifications for conducting the affairs of a library, the\r\nboard may delegate to him the performance of the more intellectual\r\nportions of the work of the librarian.\r\n\r\nEven, however, in such cases as those the individuality of the\r\nlibrarian should be considered, because, although his position may be\r\nvery humble, yet he can do better work if allowed to work in his own\r\nway, rather than in accordance with the provisions of rules laid down by\r\nothers which he is required to strictly observe.\r\n\r\nWhen a librarian is accomplished, it will be found wise for a board of\r\ntrustees or directors to ascertain his views on most subjects before\r\nacting, and it will generally appear manifest that it is well to give\r\nvery careful consideration to those views.\r\n\r\nA board which encourages its librarian to initiate measures, will\r\nadminister its trust more satisfactorily than it can if it reduces him\r\nto the position of a mere executive officer, who is only to carry out\r\nthe plans which it has formed.\r\n\r\nI should say that the wisest course for a board of trustees to pursue is\r\nto let a good librarian do pretty much as he thinks best, only keeping a\r\nwatchful eye on him for the purpose of seeing that things are not going\r\nwrong under his conduct of affairs. It is better, generally speaking,\r\nfor a board to change its librarian than to undertake to manage matters,\r\nunless its members are willing to give much time and thought on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMr. Greenough, at that time the President of the Board of Trustees of\r\nthe Boston Public Library, said to me, just after Mr. Windsor gave up\r\nhis position of Superintendent of that library, that he wished in his\r\nsuccessor the qualities of a librarian (using that designation in a\r\nrestricted sense) and not those of a superintendent, and that the title\r\nof the new officer would be librarian and not superintendent.\r\n\r\nMr. Greenough had had a long connection with the Boston Public Library\r\nas a trustee and as President of the Board of Trustees, and felt that he\r\nknew, better than any person whose services the library was likely to\r\nsecure, how to conduct its affairs.\r\n\r\nJudge Chamberlain, Mr. Windsor's successor, accepted the situation and\r\nstated in an early report, in substance, that the duty of a librarian is\r\nmerely to carry out the wishes of the board of trustees.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Greenough became disabled after a while, and Judge Chamberlain\r\ngained experience; and I venture to say, during the latter portion of\r\nthe short time which he was connected with the Boston Public Library, he\r\nfound that in the long run a librarian must take upon himself the lion's\r\nshare in the entire management of a library. Now that Judge Chamberlain\r\nhas resigned his place, the Trustees of the Boston Public Library are\r\nunderstood to be looking around for an accomplished superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe ideal executive head of a large public library--let me say it\r\nemphatically--should have the qualifications of both librarian and\r\nsuperintendent. Perhaps, in the case of some of the largest libraries,\r\nit is well to have both a superintendent and a librarian; but when such\r\na distribution of duties becomes desirable, it is certain that the\r\nsuperintendent should have something of the spirit of a librarian, and\r\nas much of his technical knowledge as possible, and that the librarian\r\nshould be often consulted in regard to questions of management, and\r\nhave, himself, no mean qualifications as an executive officer.\r\n\r\nA good librarian should be allowed to make experiments (observing, of\r\ncourse, reasonable limits), without consulting the board of trustees,\r\nwith the purpose of satisfying himself as to the desirability and\r\nfeasibility of adopting new methods, and of obtaining evidence that will\r\nenable the board to form intelligent opinions in regard to the value of\r\nchanges recommended by him.\r\n\r\nExperiments may often be undertaken, with good prospect of success, by\r\npersons familiar with kinds of work which a board of trustees,\r\nacquainted with such kinds of work, would not care to try, but which,\r\nnevertheless, it is very important should be tried.\r\n\r\nA librarian should have the appointment of his assistants in his own\r\nhands, and should himself consult heads of departments in the choice of\r\npersons to serve under them.\r\n\r\nHe should be allowed to buy such books as are needed between meetings of\r\nlibrary committees and boards of trustees, just as a trusted cashier is\r\npermitted to loan money to a bank's customer between meetings of its\r\nboard of directors. Both the librarian and the cashier should, of\r\ncourse, give an account of such proceedings to the committee or board\r\nover him at the meeting next after the transactions.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, a competent librarian should be allowed large\r\nfreedom, and held responsible for wisdom in management.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the board of trustees should insist upon the\r\nobservance by the librarian of such forms as have been adopted as\r\nsafe-guards.\r\n\r\nWhile it should allow much liberty to its executive officer, it should\r\nalso see to it that he keeps the machinery, by which work is done, in\r\norder; so that, if in the exercise of a careful oversight, it shall\r\nbecome advisable at any time for it to resume the power conferred on the\r\nlibrarian, it may be able to do it promptly.\r\n\r\nTrustees and directors may render services of the greatest value to\r\nlibraries and librarians.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I had upon my board of directors an influential member, who\r\nused to say regularly at the first meeting, after new men came on it,\r\n\"Gentlemen, our only duty is to support the librarian.\"\r\n\r\nThat is saying too much, certainly. It is, however, the duty of a board\r\nof trustees to second heartily a librarian in his efforts to make his\r\nadministration energetic, useful, and progressive, and to do all that it\r\ncan to secure patient and generous consideration by town and city\r\ngovernments, and by citizens, of all wise measures which he may adopt.\r\n\r\nTrustees are very influential in working individually to obtain for a\r\nlibrary the support in money which is needed.\r\n\r\nThey can be of great service in showing their appreciation of good work\r\ndone by the librarian, by word and act.\r\n\r\nIt is almost too much to expect of a board of trustees that it should\r\nlook out to see to it that a librarian receive a proper salary, and that\r\nhis compensation be increased as his services grow in value, without\r\nbeing reminded that the remuneration is inadequate by a communication\r\nfrom that officer. Still it is very desirable that, when a communication\r\nis made, it should be sympathetically considered, and that members of\r\nthe board should point out to one another the excellence of the services\r\nrendered by the librarian instead of expecting him to enlarge upon their\r\nvalue himself.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood, also, that it is a librarian's duty to state\r\nfully the worth of the services of his assistants, and seek adequate\r\ncompensation for them.\r\n\r\nA board of trustees can do much, and should always do as much as\r\npossible, to keep the interests of a library and of a librarian from\r\nbeing sacrificed to supposed exigencies of politics.\r\n\r\nIn some portions of the country the appointment and removal of\r\nlibrarians for political reasons has become a scandal.\r\n\r\nA board of trustees owes it to its librarian to protect him from the\r\nvagaries of impracticable men who may by some chance become members of\r\nthe board.\r\n\r\nFor example, it should quietly vote down unwise propositions, as they\r\nare made by fussy or narrow men; by those persons who, while they are\r\nself-confident, are also ignorant; by men who are so constituted as\r\nalways to oppose or hold back, or go ahead recklessly; and by such\r\npersons as wish to have a hand in doing everything which it is the duty\r\nof the librarian to do, and yet are unwilling to give any time or\r\nthought to the conduct of affairs.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency in many boards of trustees, when a single member is\r\nurgent in opposition to some measure proposed by a librarian, and the\r\nother members have no positive opinions regarding the matter, to yield\r\nto the objector.\r\n\r\nSuch oppositions may afford a proper excuse for the delay, but should\r\nnot be allowed to become permanently efficacious in preventing the\r\nexecution of a project, without the librarian has been given ample\r\nopportunities, for explaining the grounds of his recommendation. The\r\nlibrarian should always be treated as a cooperator, and not as an\r\nunintelligent servant. It would always be unwise in him to press the\r\nadoption of measures until their wisdom is generally recognized by the\r\ntrustees. Still his reasons for advising action should be ascertained\r\nand duly considered.\r\n\r\nA board of trustees will always do well to have the librarian present at\r\nits regular meetings. His knowledge and experience will be found of\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nHis plans will be the better understood. He, too, by being present will\r\nnot only comprehend better than in any other way the wishes of the board\r\nof trustees (and its members), but, that which is of great importance\r\nwill catch the spirit which animates it, and become aware of the general\r\nprinciples which it desires should underlie the administration of the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nTrustees should bear in mind that unnecessary delays are to be avoided,\r\nand that, in order to keep the members of a community in a contented\r\nframe of mind, their wants must not only be supplied, but supplied\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\nTrustees should remember that it is important to give librarians and\r\nsome of their assistants time in which to aid users of libraries,\r\ninstead of keeping every attendant constantly employed about routine\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nTrustees should guard themselves against the notion that library work\r\nis easy, and that it is only the occupations which they are usually\r\nengaged in, in which employment is wearing and hard.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, from anything which I have said, that the\r\nposition of a director or trustee of a library is, in the opinion of\r\nlibrarians, a sinecure.\r\n\r\nOur idea is far from this, as will be seen if the remarks already made\r\nare carefully considered.\r\n\r\nIt should be said in conclusion, that one of the most important duties\r\nof trustees is to look around among libraries in different towns and\r\ncities, to read library reports and accounts of meetings of librarians,\r\nwith the purpose of finding out whether they are getting as much and as\r\ngood service from librarians in the communities whose interests they\r\nhave to look after, as citizens are obtaining in places where libraries\r\nand their management have attained a high standard of excellence.\r\n\r\nWith the same end in view, they should see to it that librarians are\r\nprovided with the current issues of the best library journals and with a\r\ncollection of the best bibliographical works.\r\n\r\nThey should also put themselves, and insist upon librarians putting\r\nthemselves, into vital relations with other libraries, and with the\r\nwhole body of librarians.\r\n\r\nLibrarians should never forget that the real authority in a library\r\nrests with the board of trustees, or fail to render immediate and\r\ncordial submission to its directions.\r\n\r\nThey should also seek and accept with gratitude all practical\r\nsuggestions that may be made to them by trustees or other persons.\r\n\r\nWhen any members of the board of trustees are specialists, they should\r\nbe urged to give the library the benefit of their special knowledge, by\r\nproposing for purchase lists of books known to them to be of particular\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nI wish to add to what I have written, the statement that I have always\r\nbeen very fortunate in having over me a body of directors of unusually\r\ngood judgment, and of the kindest disposition toward me.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the remarks which I have made regarding the duties of trustees\r\nhave been suggested to me by observation of the happy results which have\r\nfollowed the administration of the affairs of my own library, by a board\r\nof directors who have governed themselves by rules almost identical with\r\nthose which I have recommended for use by boards of trustees and\r\ndirectors generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY'S SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\n    This division of the subject is that which has been most\r\n    discussed, and its subject matter is that in which most\r\n    progress has been made. It is creditable to libraries that\r\n    what they do for the public has extended and developed to a\r\n    marvelously greater degree than what the public does for\r\n    them. Whether it is equally creditable to the public \"is\r\n    another story.\" The first seven papers reproduced bear on\r\n    the subject of library service in a somewhat general manner\r\n    and are arranged chronologically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME POPULAR OBJECTIONS TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES\r\n\r\n    This is probably the first treatment of the subject in this\r\n    country, and is the leading article in the second number of\r\n    _The American Library Journal_, as it was then called. The\r\n    writer, William F. Poole was at the time librarian of the\r\n    Chicago Public Library. He mentioned objections only to\r\n    explain them away. It will be noted that none of them would\r\n    be described at present as \"popular,\" and that only the\r\n    third is now much heard.\r\n\r\n    William Frederick Poole was born in Salem, Mass., 1821, and\r\n    graduated at Yale in 1849, where as librarian of the\r\n    Linonian and Brothers Library he founded Poole's Index to\r\n    Periodical Literature, by which his name is chiefly\r\n    remembered. He was librarian of the Chicago Public Library\r\n    in 1873-87, and at his death, March 1, 1894, he was\r\n    librarian of the Newberry Library, Chicago, whose building\r\n    he designed on the departmental system, of which he was an\r\n    earnest advocate. He was the second president of the\r\n    American Library Association, serving in 1885-87.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this paper I shall use the term \"public libraries\" as meaning free\r\nmunicipal libraries organized under State laws and supported by general\r\ntaxation. This definition will exclude from our notice a large number of\r\nlibraries established on other foundations, some of them richly endowed\r\nand partially accessible to the public.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase in the number and importance of public libraries,\r\nboth in this country and in England, is perhaps the most marked feature\r\nof educational development during the past twenty-five years; for within\r\nthat brief period the first of them was opened to the public.\r\n\r\nMy subject, as announced in the programme, requires me to speak of\r\npopular objections; yet I must confess that popular appreciation of\r\nthese institutions, where they have been established, would have\r\nfurnished a more attractive theme. As their foundation involves\r\ntaxation, that prolific source of political controversy, it is somewhat\r\nremarkable that in the eleven States of our Union where public-library\r\nstatutes have been enacted, so little public discussion has occurred,\r\nand so few objections have been offered. I have heard of no instance\r\nwhere such a bill was proposed in a State legislature and was defeated.\r\nThat all the Northern States, where general education and the\r\ncommon-school system are established, have not by legislation provided\r\nalso for the public library--the natural ally and supplement of that\r\nsystem--is doubtless owing to the fact that the people have not asked\r\nfor such legislation. The unanimity of the vote by which towns have\r\naccepted taxation for the support of public libraries is significant.\r\nThe Commissioner of Education at Washington recently made inquiries on\r\nthis point, and received replies from 37 towns and cities. In 32 of\r\nthese the vote was unanimous; in 5 there was a divided sentiment, but\r\nthe vote was 1730 in favor to 515 against taxation. The vote of the\r\nrate-payers in some English towns and cities where free libraries have\r\nbeen established was as follows:\r\n\r\n                           Ayes.  Noes.\r\n\r\n  Manchester               3962     40\r\n  Winchester                337     13\r\n  Bolton                    662     55\r\n  Cambridge                 873     78\r\n  Oxford                    596     72\r\n  Sheffield                 838    232\r\n  Kidderminster             108     11\r\n  Blackburn                1700      2\r\n  Dundee, no dissentient.\r\n\r\nBy the latest statistics of the Bureau of Education, it appears that\r\nthere are 188 public libraries in eleven of the United States. Of these\r\nfive are Eastern States--Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts\r\nand Connecticut; five are Western States--Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nWisconsin, and Iowa: and one is a Southern State--Texas. Eight of these\r\nStates have passed public-library statutes within the past ten years. In\r\nthe number of libraries the States rank as follows: Massachusetts, 127;\r\nIllinois, 14; New Hampshire, 13; Ohio, 9; Maine, 8; Vermont,\r\nConnecticut, and Wisconsin, 4 each; Indiana, 3; Iowa and Texas, 1 each.\r\nIn the number of volumes they rank as follows (in round numbers):\r\nMassachusetts, 920,000; Ohio, 144,000; Illinois, 77,000; New Hampshire,\r\n52,000; Maine, 34,000; Indiana, 26,000; Vermont, 16,000; Connecticut,\r\n15,000; Texas, 10,000; Wisconsin, 6000; Iowa, 1000. The aggregate number\r\nof volumes in these libraries is 1,300,000, and their annual aggregate\r\ncirculation is 4,735,000 volumes. It is noticeable that no one of these\r\nlibraries is in New York, Pennsylvania, or any of the Middle States. The\r\nrepresentatives from those States in this Conference may be able to\r\naccount for this hiatus in the statistics of the Bureau of Education.\r\n\r\nIn this brief sketch of the statistics of our American public libraries\r\nwe have not found much evidence of popular objections to their inception\r\nand organization. In England, however, where the questions of national\r\nschools, secular schools, and parochial schools are still mooted, the\r\nidea of levying a general tax for the support of a library free to all,\r\nand furnished with books adapted to the capacities of all classes, was\r\nnot in harmony with the traditions and public policy of that people. In\r\n1848, the same year that the Legislature of Massachusetts, at the\r\nsuggestion of Josiah Quincy, Mayor of Boston, passed an act authorizing\r\nthe city of Boston to maintain a public library, Mr. William Ewart,\r\nmember of Parliament, moved in the House of Commons for a committee of\r\ninquiry respecting libraries. Such a committee was raised, and Mr. Ewart\r\nwas appointed chairman. Much evidence was taken; a report was made; and\r\nin February, 1850, a bill was introduced into the House of Commons\r\nenabling town councils to establish public libraries and museums. \"Our\r\nyounger brethren, the people of the United States,\" says the report,\r\n\"have already anticipated us in the formation of libraries entirely open\r\nto the public.\" The bill proposed limited the rate of taxation to one\r\nhalfpenny in the pound; required the affirmative vote of two thirds of\r\nthe rate-payers; restricted its operation to towns which had at least\r\nten thousand inhabitants; and provided that the money so raised should\r\nbe expended only in building and contingent expenses. This bill, meagre\r\nindeed compared with the later enactments of Parliament, met persistent\r\nopposition from the conservative benches. An ex-Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer objected because it did not give sufficient powers to form a\r\nlibrary; and he should object to it more strongly if it did. Who was to\r\nselect the books? Was every publication that issued from the press to be\r\nprocured? or was there to be a censorship introduced? Another member\r\nclaimed that the bill would enable a few persons to tax the general body\r\nof rate-payers for their own benefit, and the library would degenerate\r\ninto a political club. Col. Sibthorp thought that, however excellent\r\nfood for the mind might be, food for the body was more needed by the\r\npeople. \"I do not like reading at all,\" he said, \"and hated it when I\r\nwas at Oxford.\" Lord John Manners said he could not support the bill,\r\nbecause it would impose an additional tax upon the agricultural\r\ninterest. Mr. Spooner feared these institutions might be converted into\r\nnormal schools of agitation. Sir Roundell Palmer--since the Lord\r\nChancellor of England--was most apprehensive that the moment the\r\ncompulsory principle was introduced, a positive check would be imposed\r\nupon the voluntary, self-supporting desire which existed among the\r\npeople. A division being taken on the bill, there were 118 ayes and 101\r\nnoes. The bill passed the House of Commons in July, and the House of\r\nLords, without opposition, in August, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe Manchester, Liverpool, and Bolton free libraries were immediately\r\norganized under this act, the cost of the books being defrayed by public\r\nsubscription. In 1853 similar legislation was extended to Scotland and\r\nIreland. In July, 1855, the new libraries having gone into operation\r\nwith the most encouraging results, a new and more liberal library act\r\nwas passed, by a vote of three to one, which raised the rate of taxation\r\nfrom a halfpenny to a penny in the pound, and allowed the income to be\r\nexpended for books. Its provisions were made to include towns, boroughs,\r\nparishes, and districts having a population of 5000 inhabitants, and\r\npermitted two adjoining parishes, having an aggregate population of five\r\nthousand, to unite in the establishment of a library.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the library act was again improved by removing the limit of\r\npopulation required, and reducing the two-thirds vote on the acceptance\r\nof the library tax to a bare majority vote. Provision was also made for\r\ncases in which the overseers of parishes refused or neglected to call a\r\nmeeting of the rate-payers to vote on the question. Any ten rate-payers\r\ncould secure the calling of such a meeting, and the vote there taken was\r\nmade binding and legal.\r\n\r\nThe English free-library system is now so firmly established that it\r\nwill not be changed except to expand and enlarge it. Its chief\r\nsupporters are the middle classes, and artisans and laborers, who, with\r\ntheir families, are its most numerous patrons.\r\n\r\nThe recent extension of suffrage in England has strengthened the system.\r\nNo candidate for official position who opposed it could hope for\r\nsuccess. It has been found that free libraries have not degenerated into\r\npolitical clubs and schools of agitation. No trouble has arisen in the\r\nselection of books, and no censorship of the press was required. It was\r\nat first supposed that all books relating to religion and politics--the\r\nsubjects on which people quarrel most--must be excluded. The experiment\r\nof including these books was tried in the Manchester and Liverpool\r\nlibraries, where the books were purchased by private subscription, and\r\nno controversy arising therefrom, all apprehension of evil from this\r\ncause was allayed. Parliament doubled the rate of taxation, and\r\npermitted the purchase of books from the public funds. The adoption of\r\nthe compulsory system has not imposed a check on the voluntary and\r\nself-supporting desire of possessing books which existed among the\r\npeople. It has strengthened that desire; and ample proof of this\r\nstatement could be furnished if the prescribed limits of this paper\r\nwould permit.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that objections to public libraries have come mainly from\r\nmen--as we have seen from the debate in the British Parliament--who are\r\neducated, and in general matters of public welfare are intelligent above\r\ntheir fellows. These objections, however, were uttered before the\r\npersons making them had given the subject any attention, and hence they\r\nwere disqualified from entertaining an opinion.\r\n\r\nNearly all the objections to public libraries which have been expressed\r\nin this country--and these appear more frequently in private\r\nconversation than in the public prints--may be classed under three\r\nheads:\r\n\r\n1. The universal dread of taxation. Libraries cost money. In every city\r\nand town of the land there is a feeling that the present rate of\r\ntaxation is all that the property and business of the place will bear.\r\nThis feeling existed before the taxes were one half their present rates.\r\nThere is a generous rivalry among our cities and towns in the\r\nmaintenance of good schools; and localities which furnish the best\r\nfacilities for education are regarded as the most desirable places for\r\nresidence. Viewed simply as a matter of public economy, no city can\r\nafford to dispense with its educational system, or to permit it to\r\ndegenerate. The public library also should be maintained as the\r\nsupplement of the public school, carrying forward the education of the\r\npeople from the point where the public school leaves it.\r\n\r\n2. There are certain theoretical objections offered to the establishment\r\nand maintenance of public libraries. One is that the library tax bears\r\nunequally upon the people. Some persons do not care to read books, and\r\nothers prefer to pay for their own reading. The same objection is quite\r\nas valid against any system of public education. To lay the burden of\r\neducation uniformly upon property, and to tax the owner who has no\r\nchildren, or, having children, prefers to educate them at private\r\nschools, is another glaring instance of inequality. No taxation for the\r\nmaintenance of public health, the introduction of water and gas, the\r\nconstruction of roads, bridges, and sewers, bears equally upon every\r\nmember of the community. If perfect equality in the distribution of\r\nthese burdens were a necessity, an organized municipality would be an\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most popular objection to public libraries is the one urged\r\nby the few disciples of Herbert Spencer--that government has no\r\nlegitimate function except the protection of person and property, as the\r\noriginal compact of society is simply for the purpose of protection. All\r\nelse is paternal, pertains to the commune, and tends to perpetual\r\nantagonism. The government may support a police, courts of justice,\r\nprisons, penitentiaries, and similar institutions, and can do nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nHow are the people under this theory to be educated? The reply is\r\nexplicit: Unless they will educate themselves, they are not to be\r\neducated. How is the public health to be maintained? It is not to be\r\nmaintained by any interference of government. Who is to build bridges\r\nand sewers and lay out public parks? Nobody. Imagine, if it be possible,\r\na community where such a Utopian theory was carried out. Such a\r\ngovernment fortunately does not, and never did, exist on the face of the\r\nglobe. The \"general welfare\"--which includes protection--is expressly\r\nstated in the preamble of the national constitution to be the purpose of\r\nour government, and the same expression is found in nearly all the state\r\nconstitutions. What ever the people desire, and whatever will, in their\r\njudgment, conduce to the general welfare, is a legitimate subject for\r\ngovernmental action. \"The only orthodox object of the institution of\r\ngovernment,\" says Mr. Jefferson, \"is to secure the greatest degree of\r\nhappiness possible to the general mass of those associated under it.\"\r\nHerbert Spencer wrote his \"Social Statics\" before the British Parliament\r\npassed an act for the support of public libraries. Mr. Ewart's bill was\r\nthen before Parliament; and Mr. Spencer, in that work, took occasion to\r\nfling a sneer at it. In the preface of his American edition, written in\r\n1864, he states, without remodelling the text, that \"the work does not\r\naccurately represent his present opinions.\"\r\n\r\n3. The third and last class of objections to public libraries to which\r\nI shall direct your attention relates to the kind and quality of books\r\ncirculated. These objections, which are usually made by educated and\r\nscholarly persons, are based on an entire misconception of the facts in\r\nthe case. The objectors do not divest themselves of the old idea that\r\nlibraries are established for the exclusive benefit of scholars; whereas\r\nthe purpose of these is to furnish reading for all classes in the\r\ncommunity. On no other principle would a general tax for their support\r\nbe justifiable. The masses of a community have very little of literary\r\nand scholarly culture. They need more of this culture, and the purpose\r\nof the library is to develop and increase it. This is done by placing in\r\ntheir hands such books as they can read with pleasure and appreciate,\r\nand by stimulating them to acquire the _habit_ of reading. We must first\r\ninterest the reader before we can educate him; and, to this end, must\r\ncommence at his own standard of intelligence. The scholar, in his pride\r\nof intellect, forgets the progressive steps he took in his own mental\r\ndevelopment--the stories read to him in the nursery, the boy's book of\r\nadventure in which he revelled with delight, and the sentimental novel\r\nover which he shed tears in his youth. Our objector supposes that the\r\nmasses will read books of his standard if they were not supplied with\r\nthe books to which he objects; but he is mistaken. Shut up to this\r\nchoice, they will read no books. When the habit of reading is once\r\nacquired, the reader's taste, and hence the quality of his reading,\r\nprogressively improve.\r\n\r\nThe standard histories, technical works of science, and even\r\nShakespeare's plays and Milton's \"Paradise Lost,\" are sealed books to a\r\nlarger portion of every community than are willing to acknowledge the\r\nfact. \"When a Boy,\" said John Quincy Adams, \"I attempted ten times to\r\nread Milton's 'Paradise Lost.' I was mortified, even to the shedding of\r\ntears, that I could not conceive what it was that my father and mother\r\nso much admired in that book. I smoked tobacco and read Milton at the\r\nsame time, and for the same motive: to find out what was the recondite\r\ncharm in them that gave my father so much pleasure. After making myself\r\nsick four or five times with smoking, I mastered that accomplishment;\r\nbut I did not master Milton. I was nearly thirty years of age when I\r\nfirst read 'Paradise Lost' with delight and astonishment.\"\r\n\r\nIf our objectors mourn over the standard of books which are read by the\r\npublic, they may be consoled by the fact that, as a rule, people read\r\nbooks better than themselves, and hence are benefited by reading. A book\r\nof a lower intellectual or moral standard than the reader's is thrown\r\naside in disgust, to be picked up and read by a person still lower in\r\nthe scale of mental and moral development.\r\n\r\nI do not lament, or join in the clamor sometimes raised, over the\r\nstatistics of prose fiction circulated at public libraries. Why this\r\nlamentation over one specific form of fiction? The writers of such prose\r\nfiction as is found in our libraries were as eminent and worthy men and\r\nwomen as the writers of poetical fiction, dramatic fiction, or, I might\r\nadd, the fiction which passes in the world as history and biography.\r\nHistory professes to relate actual events, biography to describe actual\r\nlives, and science to unfold and explain natural laws and physical\r\nphenomena. Fiction treats these and other subjects, mental, moral,\r\nsentimental, and divine, from an ideal or artistic standpoint; and the\r\ngreat mass of readers prefer to take their knowledge in this form. More\r\nis known to-day of the history and traditions of Scotland, and of the\r\nsocial customs of London, from the novels of Sir Walter Scott and\r\nCharles Dickens than from all the histories of those localities. Fiction\r\nis the art element in literature, and the most enduring monuments of\r\ngenius in the literature of any people are works of the imagination.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there is much poor fiction, and the statement is true.\r\nSo there are many poor pictures and poor statues, wretched chromos and\r\nmore wretched plaster casts. That these productions find purchasers is\r\nevidence that there are persons whose ideal standard of excellence is\r\neven below these feeble efforts, and they are educated thereby.\r\n\r\nBut there are novels, we are told, which are immoral and positively\r\ndebasing. So there are immoral paintings and indecent plastic objects.\r\nThe act of photography, I am told, is debased to the lowest purposes.\r\nNobody would think of objecting to art because it can be and is\r\ndegraded. The librarian who should allow an immoral novel in his library\r\nfor circulation would be as culpable as the manager of a picture gallery\r\nwho should hang an indecent picture on his walls.\r\n\r\nYoung people, again, we are told, read too many novels. So they eat too\r\nmuch, play too much, go too often to the lake to bathe, remain too long\r\nin the water, and do too much of everything in which they take special\r\ndelight. The remedy is not to deprive children of these pleasures, but\r\nthat parents and guardians should regulate them. I have never met a\r\nperson of much literary culture who would not confess that at some\r\nperiod in his life, usually in his youth, he had read novels\r\nexcessively. His special interest in them suddenly ceased. He found\r\nhimself with a confirmed habit of reading, an awakened imagination, a\r\nfull vocabulary, and a taste for other and higher classes of literature.\r\nA novel was read occasionally in later life, as recreation in the midst\r\nof professional or technical studies. My observation addressed to this\r\npoint, and extending over a library experience of thirty years, has\r\nconfirmed me in the belief that there is in the mental development of\r\nevery person who later attains to literary culture a limited period when\r\nhe craves novel-reading, and perhaps reads novels to excess; but from\r\nwhich, if the desire be gratified, he passes safely out into broader\r\nfields of study, and this craving never returns to him in its original\r\nform.\r\n\r\nAgain, and finally, we are told that the reading of fiction should be\r\ndiscouraged because it is not _true_. What department of literature is\r\ntrue? Is it history? Whose history of the United States, for instance,\r\nis the true history? Is it Bancroft's? Mr. Bancroft for forty years has\r\nbeen changing the plates of his work to an extent that in pages we can\r\nscarcely recognize the original text, and lately he has revised the\r\nwhole in the new Centennial edition. The accurate student of specialties\r\nin American history will talk to you by the hour of mis-statements and\r\nerrors found in this new issue. Whose history of the reigns of Henry\r\nVIII. and of Queen Elizabeth is the true one? Is it Hume's, Turner's,\r\nLingard's, or Froude's? \"Do not read to me history,\" said a sick\r\nmonarch, \"that I know is a lie. Read to me something that is true.\" Is\r\nbiography true? Which of the score of lives of Mary Queen of Scots is\r\nthe true biography? Is theology true? Whose is the true body of\r\ndivinity? Is science true? Why was it necessary to rewrite all the\r\nscience in the eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, for the\r\nninth edition? Homer's Iliad, Dante's Divine Comedy, Shakespeare's\r\nHamlet and Othello, do not require to be rewritten every ten or twenty\r\nyears. The Vicar of Wakefield, Ivanhoe, and Robinson Crusoe have held\r\nand will hold their own from generation to generation without revision,\r\nbecause they are _ideally true_ pictures of human life and human nature.\r\nShall we say that in literature and science there is nothing true but\r\nfiction and the pure mathematics?\r\n\r\nIn the public libraries which are growing up in our land, fully four\r\nfifths of the money appropriated for books is spent in works adapted to\r\nthe wants of scholars. In the larger libraries the proportion is even\r\ngreater. It is hardly becoming for scholars, who enjoy the lion's share,\r\nto object to the small proportional expenditure for books adapted to the\r\nwants of the masses who bear the burden of taxation.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Edwards, of the Manchester Library, speaking, in 1859, of\r\nnovels and romances--which he circulated more freely than is done in any\r\nAmerican library--remarked as follows: \"It may be truthfully said that\r\nat no previous period in the history of English literature has prose\r\nfiction been made, in so great a degree as of late years, the vehicle of\r\nthe best thoughts of some of the best thinkers. Nor, taking it as a\r\nwhole, was it ever before characterized by so much general purity of\r\ntone or loftiness of purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE A LIBRARY\r\n\r\n    The substance of two addresses made at Pittsfield, Mass.,\r\n    and printed in _The Library Journal_ for February, 1884. Mr.\r\n    Hubbard's advice with regard to children's reading was\r\n    followed long ago by specialization in work with children.\r\n    That with regard to adult fiction remains unheeded. Some\r\n    day, possibly we shall have \"adults' librarians\" and\r\n    training for \"work with adults.\"\r\n\r\n    James Mascarene Hubbard was born in Boston in 1836. He was\r\n    made assistant librarian of the Boston Public Library in\r\n    1884 and also reorganized the Berkshire Athenaeum of\r\n    Pittsfield, Mass., in the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong all the pictures of Abraham Lincoln none perhaps are more\r\ninteresting than two which represent scenes at the beginning and at the\r\nend of his life. In the first, a lad of thirteen or fourteen, he is\r\nreading by the light of a fire in his father's log hut. In the second,\r\nhe is reading the Bible to his sons in a room in the White House. This\r\nBible, which lies before the President in the latter picture, with a\r\ncatechism and a spelling-book, were the only books in that frontier\r\ncabin when he learned to read. Though his father could neither read nor\r\nwrite, yet he took the greatest interest in getting books for his son,\r\nso that when he was eighteen his library consisted of the Bible,\r\nPilgrim's Progress, Aesop's Fables, Weem's and Ramsay's Lives of\r\nWashington, a Life of Clay, the Autobiography of Franklin, and a copy of\r\nPlutarch. It is note-worthy that the one which influenced him the most\r\nstrongly, after the Bible, was the Life of Washington. At the very\r\ncrisis of his career, when on his way to the national capital to take\r\nthe leading part in crushing out the rebellion, he reverted to those\r\nearly days, and recalled the burning thoughts which filled his mind\r\nwhile reading of the sufferings and sacrifices endured for the sake of\r\nfreedom by the great patriot leader and his followers.\r\n\r\nLincoln's experience was, of course, no solitary one, but it doubtless\r\nhad a great effect when it became generally known. It filled many men's\r\nimaginations with pictures of obscure lads with latent powers for noble\r\ndeeds in danger of being stunted or wholly destroyed for want of proper\r\nnourishment, and they gave freely and generously that these \"village\r\nHampdens,\" these hearts \"pregnant with sacred fire,\" might not live\r\nuseless and ignoble lives for want of books alone. Hence to-day a large\r\nsection of our country is dotted over with libraries, in which the\r\ncollective wisdom and experience of the world, as it were, are gathered\r\nfor the use especially of the youth of the nation.\r\n\r\nBut, as is inevitable with the blessing of abundance, has come its\r\ndanger also. Lincoln's naturally great intellectual powers were\r\nstrengthened by their being at first exercised upon a few subjects. The\r\npossession of a book being an era in his early life from its rarity, he\r\nread and re-read each one which he got, so as almost to learn it by\r\nheart before he read another. So the vivid impressions received from the\r\nlives of Washington and the other great heroes of history ran no risk of\r\nbeing dissipated before they could have their full effect upon his mind\r\nand heart. This, however, is our danger in this day of public libraries\r\nand cheap literature, that the mental strength of our youth will be\r\nweakened through the too much reading of a multitude of books. As the\r\nwaters of a brook when confined to a narrow channel may have power\r\nenough to set in motion a thousand spindles, but if suffered to spread\r\nover the ground are not able to turn a child's toy wheel, so with the\r\npowers of the mind. When directed to a few objects they may be capable\r\nof the greatest and most beneficent results, but when allowed to exhaust\r\nthemselves upon a multitude they are in danger of becoming sterile and\r\nunfruitful. With Lincoln then, and with many a frontier and backwoods\r\nboy now, the question was and is, How shall I get a book? With a greater\r\nnumber to-day, however, the more important question is, Which book shall\r\nI choose?\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to aid any one to answer this question for himself,\r\nlet me briefly advert to the fact that there are two kinds of reading\r\nfor each of us, and two corresponding uses, therefore, of the\r\nlibrary--the reading for amusement and the reading for profit. In regard\r\nto the former, I can say but a word, as it is a subject by itself. And\r\nthat word is, let this reading be the best possible, and do not let it\r\noccupy too much of your spare time. Books read simply for amusement have\r\non most a greater power to elevate or degrade than any others, and more\r\ncare should be taken in selecting them than in the choice of those to be\r\nread for instruction. Read then, and put into the hands of the young the\r\nbest fiction, and shun those writers, whatever their power or their\r\npopularity, who reproduce in their books the slang and vulgar speech of\r\nthe streets and paint realistic scenes of vice and crime.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question, How or what shall I read? must necessarily\r\nbe as varied as the tastes, the talents, and the circumstances of\r\nreaders vary. The general aim, however, should be the same in all. We\r\nshould read in order to do well whatever we have to do in life. Now this\r\nimplies something more than the reading simply to increase one's\r\nknowledge--certainly a worthy aim, but not the highest. The field of\r\nknowledge is so broad and the time for reading so short that we must\r\nnecessarily choose those subjects, the knowledge of which will make us\r\nbetter fitted for our work in life. And the mere seeking for knowledge,\r\nwhich is the sole end of much reading, does not imply, but may even\r\nprevent the attaining that higher end, the cultivation of our nobler\r\npowers, as the imagination and the sympathies, and the gaining the power\r\nof appreciating what is highest and best in literature and life. For\r\ninstance, one may be conscious of a total lack of a love for any great\r\nwriter. To him Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, and their peers are\r\nbut names. Now it may be that the best use to which such an one can put\r\na library is to make at least the attempt to understand and enjoy some\r\ngreat author. It will be no easy task, but one needing and worthy the\r\nhardest study. To take, as an illustration of one method, a lesser poet,\r\nread carefully and thoughtfully Matthew Arnold's introduction to his\r\nedition of the selected poems of Wordsworth. Whenever he refers to a\r\npoem, read it before going farther and re-read it until the thought of\r\nthe poet as indicated by the commentator is reasonably clear. Then read\r\nin the same manner what Coleridge, Shairp, F.W. Robertson, or any other\r\ngood critic has written upon Wordsworth. And, above all, sometimes read\r\nthe poems as nearly as possible in the same circumstances under which\r\nthey were written--in the forest, by the brook-side, in the solitudes of\r\nthe mountains, or on a bridge in the heart of a great city. If this fail\r\nto awaken an interest in Wordsworth, try some other author in a similar\r\nway, and it is impossible that of all who have stirred men's hearts\r\nthrough the ages, no one can be found to arouse your sympathies. And\r\nwhen the right author is at length found, you live on a higher plane\r\nthan before. This great poet, philosopher, or dramatist has become your\r\nfriend and familiar companion--a gain far greater than the acquirement\r\nof any mere book knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of another person's life may be spent in sordid\r\nsurroundings, with companions and in an occupation tending to depress\r\nand degrade the better nature. I can easily conceive that it might be\r\nthe highest duty of such an one to remain ignorant of much useful\r\nknowledge in order to quicken the imagination, to enlarge the tastes,\r\nand heighten the enjoyments. So that when the day's work is done, he may\r\nexchange the sordid companions, suggestive only of mean thoughts and low\r\naims, for intercourse with men of purest and noblest nature--men, too,\r\nit may be, who have lived, thought, and written under circumstances as\r\ndepressing as those in which he lives and works. So there may be some\r\none who regretfully feels that in Nature there is nothing which gives to\r\nhim, as to others, the keenest pleasure, refreshing him when wearied,\r\nencouraging him when downcast. Who sees nothing in the skies save signs\r\nof the coming storm, nothing in the trees or flowers, the rivers or the\r\nhills, save something relating to his material comfort or discomfort.\r\nThe best use to which this man could put a library and his reading hours\r\nmight be to study the works of the great interpreters of nature, as\r\nWhite of Selborne, Ruskin, or Emerson. And if they should open his eyes\r\nso that he can look \"through Nature up to Nature's God,\" his gain is\r\nimmeasurable.\r\n\r\nNow, in neither of these instances is the increase of knowledge the aim\r\nset before the reader, but the development of some dwarfed faculty whose\r\ngrowth is necessary to the leading of a noble life. But where the\r\nincrease of knowledge is the direct end sought, the value of the\r\nknowledge in itself must not be that alone which decides one in the\r\nchoice of books, or incites him to reading, but the use to which it can\r\nand ought to be put. An employer of labor, for instance, one who is\r\nimmediately responsible for the welfare of a large number of workmen,\r\ncannot, with any true conception of his duty as a master, devote his\r\ntime for reading to acquiring a knowledge of history, science, or\r\nliterature, if he know nothing of the principles underlying the\r\nrelations of capital to labor, if he is ignorant of the dangers, the\r\ntemptations, the needs and rights of his workpeople. However\r\nwell-informed on other subjects, he has read to far less advantage than\r\nif his books had been chosen with a direct purpose to fit him to do his\r\nduty as a master. So many a parent ought, for a time at least, to read\r\nwith a view wholly to prepare himself for the wise moral and mental\r\ntraining of his children. And on the other hand a man should read the\r\nhistory of his country, not merely that he may not blush from conscious\r\nignorance of it, but that, knowing what his heritage of freedom cost to\r\nobtain, he may also come to the conviction that it is not his to enjoy\r\nsimply, but it is a sacred trust to be accounted for, however humble his\r\nposition. It could not be more humble than Lincoln's, and yet none can\r\ndoubt that to the spirit in which he read American history was largely\r\ndue his future fitness for the great work which God gave him to do.\r\n\r\nTo what highest and most profitable use can I put my reading? is the\r\nquestion then which each one should ask himself, and according as the\r\nanswer is, so should the choice be made. It may be that one will read\r\nthat he may understand better his duties and privileges as a citizen;\r\nanother, that he may be a just master, or an intelligent and faithful\r\nworkman; still another, that she may be a wise parent; while a fourth\r\nmay have the strong conviction that everything else should be laid aside\r\nfor the study of one of the masterpieces of the world's literature, that\r\nhe may develop his higher faculties and become a man thinking lofty\r\nthoughts and capable of noble deeds.\r\n\r\nBut there is a very large class of readers, especially of a public\r\nlibrary, to whom what I have just said will be of but little use. And as\r\nit is upon them that the choice of books has the greatest influence for\r\ngood or evil, it is to speak of their interests that I turn with the\r\ndeepest solicitude. This class may be subdivided into two classes--the\r\nchildren of intelligent parents who are capable of directing their\r\nreading, and those children who have none to guide them in their choice.\r\nAs regards the former, one of the greatest dangers of the public\r\nlibrary, in my opinion, is that many parents throw off all\r\nresponsibility as to the books their children read upon those who have\r\ncharge of the library. A generation ago, all the books, as a rule, which\r\nthe young read were bought especially for them by their parents or\r\nfriends, with more or less care in the selection. Of course under these\r\ncircumstances they had a general knowledge of what their children read.\r\nNow a great many parents neither know, nor do they apparently seem to\r\ncare to know, what books fall into their children's hands, so long as\r\nthey are from the public library, which is supposed to be a guarantee\r\nfor their fitness for young readers. Without entering here upon the\r\nimportant question as to what books should or should not be put in a\r\npublic library, it is enough to say that no intelligent parent, with a\r\nright idea of his duty toward his children, can properly lay this\r\nresponsibility upon persons, however carefully chosen or however\r\nfaithful in the discharge of their duties. The capacity of children for\r\nreceiving good or bad impressions from books differs, as their features\r\nand forms vary. The same story might prove harmless to one boy and give\r\na moral twist to another's mind from which he might never recover. One\r\ngirl might receive from a book a hundred evil suggestions, hopelessly\r\ndepraving her imagination, while upon another it might not leave a\r\nsingle evil trace. Now, it is not possible for the most scrupulous\r\nlibrarian to discriminate between these two, and refuse the book to the\r\none and freely give it to the other. And therefore no library with a\r\nlarge and miscellaneous collection of stories and novels can be safe for\r\nchildren freely to use except under the careful supervision of their\r\nparents. The only safeguard of which I know is for parents to read much\r\nwith their children, to interest themselves in their books, and to talk\r\nwith them about them. Those stories, for instance, against which there\r\nhas been such an outcry of late years, would have but small power to\r\nhurt that boy to whom a father had taken the pains to point out the\r\nabsurdities, the unrealities, the false ideas and aims of which they are\r\naccused.\r\n\r\nBut in our cities and large towns there can be no doubt that the\r\ngreater number of the younger readers of a public library belong to the\r\nsecond of the two classes referred to--those who have none to guide them\r\nin the choice of their books. The most of these come, of course, simply\r\nfor amusement, without a thought of any better use of the library. But a\r\nfew come with other and higher aims. Some, with no specially strong\r\ntastes or more than ordinary capacities, merely wish to read that which\r\nwill cultivate their minds and increase their knowledge, or will be\r\nprofitable to them in their work. A very few there are, however, in\r\nevery large town, with intellects of no mean order and strong ambitions,\r\nwho turn to the library instinctively for that which will satisfy the\r\ncravings of their intellects and the promptings of their ambitions. A\r\nyouth with the instincts of a Lincoln or a Webster comes to read the\r\nhistory of his country. Another, with the latent powers of a Nasmyth, a\r\nStevenson, or an Arkwright, wants the books which will give full play to\r\nhis inventive faculties. Another finds a strange and irresistible\r\nattraction in natural phenomena, in the habits of plants and animals, in\r\nthe formation of the rocks and the hills, in the aspects of the skies\r\nand the movements of the stars. Now, it will depend very much upon the\r\nfirst choice of their books, and the subsequent direction of their\r\nreading, whether they will become men useful to the communities in which\r\nthey live and add substantial material to the sum of human knowledge, as\r\nstatesmen, inventors, naturalists, or astronomers. The danger is that,\r\nfor lack of proper guidance and restraint, they will dissipate their\r\nmental energies and lose sight of all high aims by too much and too\r\nvague reading. If the public library is to be in fact, what it is in\r\ntheory, an educating power second only to the church and the school, and\r\nsupplementing the work of both, there must be some method devised by\r\nwhich such readers as these may be helped to choose the right books.\r\nWithout such aid, given continually and systematically, the library\r\nfails in the principal end for which it was founded--the elevation and\r\ninstruction of the people. We might as well turn our children into a\r\nschool-house, fully furnished with books and apparatus, but with only a\r\njanitor to see that no injury is done to them, and expect the children\r\nto make a wise use of their opportunities, to take up and pursue the\r\nproper studies without the aid of a master, as to give children the free\r\nrange of a great library and expect them undirected to make a wise use\r\nof its advantages as a means of education. It is, therefore, in my\r\nopinion, a most pernicious error to encourage young people, of the lower\r\nclasses especially, to come to a library, and to give them poor stories\r\nin the mistaken belief that, the taste for reading being developed, they\r\nwill naturally and surely rise from these to better books. Such a belief\r\nis contrary to all our experience of human nature. With careful guidance\r\nand restraint a boy may be brought from the Dime novel to read Scott and\r\nMacaulay. But without this restraint and guidance, where one will rise,\r\na hundred, a thousand rather, will remain at the level from which they\r\nstarted, or more naturally sink to still lower depths.\r\n\r\nThe question is, Can anything be done to help the young who throng our\r\npublic libraries to read well and wisely? Shall these boys and girls,\r\nwith their unknown powers both for good and evil, be left to grope\r\nhelplessly amid these treasures of wisdom and knowledge which our\r\nlibraries contain, or shall the attempt at least be made to give them a\r\nkindly and intelligent guidance? This work, of such incalculable\r\nimportance, I hasten to say, is already well done to a certain extent by\r\na few librarians in the country. But it is a work which requires time,\r\npatience, tact, an insight into character, and a very varied and\r\nextensive knowledge. It is evident that the librarians who combine these\r\nrequisites are few in number. It is a work which cannot be done by them\r\nas a class. Nor can it be done by the ordinary catalogues, however\r\nskilfully prepared. For it is evident that there needs to be some\r\npersonal knowledge of each reader's capacities in order to help him\r\nintelligently and profitably. Nor is it something which the\r\nschool-teachers, willing though many of them are, can do, except in a\r\nlimited degree, as many of those who need help are not school-children.\r\nThere are, however, a few persons in every town fitted by their\r\neducation and their circumstances in life for this work, and it is to\r\nthem we must finally appeal.\r\n\r\nThe most practical plan, presenting on the whole the fewest\r\ndifficulties, seems to be the following: Let those persons who are\r\nwilling to make the attempt to give this instruction in reading choose\r\neach a subject, as general History, the History of the United States,\r\nScience, Travels, Biography, Fiction, or Children's stories, and see\r\nwhat their public library contains on these subjects. In due time notice\r\ncould be given that all persons wishing help in the choice of books in\r\nany of these subjects could be aided by applying to the librarian. He\r\nwould refer the inquirer to that person who has chosen this subject, who\r\nwill naturally endeavor to find out something of the character,\r\ncircumstances, and abilities of the applicant before selecting the books\r\nbest fitted in his or her opinion for him to read. No doubt, at first,\r\nthere would be few to apply, and mistakes would be made from lack of\r\nexperience. But, if only one reader was substantially aided, if only one\r\nbright youth was rescued from the danger of dissipating his energies by\r\naimless or depraving reading, all the labor would be amply rewarded, to\r\nsay nothing of the benefit which the guide himself, in preparing for his\r\nwork, would receive. I do not believe, however, that the applicants for\r\nguidance would be few, when it was known among the work-people of our\r\nmills, our shops and stores, among the poor, that every one coming to\r\nthe library asking for aid would find some one ready, as it were, to\r\ntake him by the hand, and lead him from book to book, so long as he\r\nneeded help. I am confident that it would be an invaluable service if\r\nsome one or two persons should take the pains to become acquainted with\r\nthe character of the books for the children and the novels contained in\r\na library. There are many parents who feel instinctively the truth of\r\nthe words of F.W. Robertson, that \"a man's character and mind are\r\nmoulded for good or evil far more by the forms of imagination which\r\nsurround his childhood than by any subsequent scientific training.\" Many\r\nan anxious but ignorant parent who sees in her boys and girls a craving\r\nfor books, at which she rejoices with trembling, would turn with\r\nheart-felt gratitude--I speak with the fullest confidence, because I\r\nspeak from experience--to one who would give them advice as to the books\r\nwhich their children might safely read and those which they should shun.\r\n\r\nIt is only by some such means as this that the public library can be\r\nmade a real educating power for the masses. In far too many places, now,\r\nit is simply a place where children can get story-books at the public\r\nexpense. This cannot long continue, and I believe that the greater part\r\nof the libraries which continue to do this work without an effort to\r\nfulfil their higher mission, will surely and inevitably die, as the\r\nDistrict School and Agricultural libraries died fifty years ago. The\r\nresponsibility rests with the people of each place where there is a\r\npublic library, as to which of two ends shall be reached. It may be\r\nmerely a means for furnishing amusement for an hour, or it may be a\r\ncentral beacon from whence the rays of light shall stream into every\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADAPTATION OF LIBRARIES TO CONSTITUENCIES\r\n\r\n    Prepared by Samuel S. Green, then librarian of the\r\n    Worcester, Mass. Public Library and a member of the State\r\n    Library Commission, for the World's Library Congress held at\r\n    the Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893) and printed in the\r\n    government report thereon. The \"adaptation\" favored by Mr.\r\n    Green consists in weeding out unfitting books. Melvil Dewey,\r\n    as editor of this volume of papers, tells us in a foot-note\r\n    that in the discussion of Mr. Green's paper, this process\r\n    was not generally approved except as the first step in a\r\n    transfer to other libraries. President Eliot's suggestion of\r\n    reservoir libraries for storage is a later stage, in the\r\n    same line of thought. A sketch of Mr. Green appears in Vol.\r\n    I. of this series.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--With this paper should be read those pages of the\r\n    Chicago discussions in which it was pointed out by leading\r\n    librarians that to weed out safely would require much costly\r\n    expert service; that the most hurtful criticism would be\r\n    attacks after inevitable cases where some one would greatly\r\n    wish a book that had been withdrawn as useless; that the\r\n    printed catalogs already circulated would be made\r\n    untrustworthy by parting with any volume included; that what\r\n    one wise and learned man would throw out as trash, another\r\n    equally wise and learned would consider specially valuable\r\n    because of differing personal equations. In short, that\r\n    however excellent in theory, it was perhaps the most\r\n    difficult thing in librarianship to put successfully in\r\n    practice.\r\n\r\n    While few favored \"weeding out\" simply to gain room by\r\n    getting rid of books little wanted, many believe in\r\n    transferring to other libraries which have a distinctly\r\n    greater need of them.--M.D.\r\n\r\nA resident of a Massachusetts town to which the Commonwealth was about\r\nto give $100 worth of books came to secure my influence as a member of\r\nthe State free public library commission to have a large part of the\r\n$100 spent for rare and expensive books on Massachusetts history. As a\r\nlarge and valuable library made up principally of books of that class\r\nwas soon to be given to another small town in the same county, it would\r\nhave been manifestly unwise to grant this request. It seems unwise also\r\nto place a students' library in a small town where there are few who\r\nwill use it. It would be better to give the library to a flourishing\r\ninstitution at a county seat, on condition that it shall be open for\r\nfree consultation by all residents of the county, and that, under proper\r\nrules, books may be lent from it to inhabitants of smaller towns for use\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nIn this way the library would be so placed that most persons wishing to\r\nmake investigations would have the books near home, and the\r\ncomparatively few investigators in the smaller towns, such as the man in\r\nthe town first mentioned, would also have their interests provided for.\r\n\r\nThe trustees of the Thomas Crane Public Library at Quincy, Mass., have\r\nconcluded, utilizing the experience of many years, that a working\r\nlibrary of 15,000 volumes is sufficient to supply the general wants of\r\nthe 20,000 residents of the city. It is proposed not to let the library\r\ngrow beyond 20,000 volumes while the wants of the city remain what they\r\nare, and when it exceeds that number of volumes to cut it down by taking\r\nout books that never have been needed in a popular library like that in\r\nQuincy or that have become useless. It having become evident that an\r\naddition would presently have to be made to the building if the recent\r\nrate of increase should continue, it seemed best to the trustees to\r\nbegin at once to reduce the size of the library. They proceeded, under\r\nthe able leadership of Mr. Charles Francis Adams, to remove from the\r\nlibrary large numbers of Government documents, unnecessary duplicates,\r\nbooks of an outgrown ephemeral interest, and those unsuited to the\r\nlocality. Twenty-one hundred and forty-five volumes were removed\r\nimmediately. The Quincy library, by adopting this course, relieves\r\nitself from very considerable prospective expenses and secures money to\r\nuse in increasing its usefulness.\r\n\r\nPart of the plan is to keep the printed catalogs of the small library up\r\nto date and to scatter copies of them widely throughout the city by\r\nselling them at a nominal price. It is always expensive to prepare and\r\nprint a good catalog; it is very expensive to issue new editions\r\nfrequently. Still, if a popular library is to do its work well it must\r\nintroduce its constituents to its books by means of frequent revised\r\neditions of a good, printed catalog.\r\n\r\nThe Thomas Crane Library has been famous for the excellence of its\r\nannotated catalog and for lists of books on special subjects for the use\r\nof school children. It proposes in future to use more money than in the\r\npast in making, printing, and keeping up to date good catalogs, and, in\r\norder to make it practicable to do so, to keep down the number of\r\nvolumes in the library, thus reducing the expenses of cataloging, and\r\nalso to save money in housing its books. That is to say, it is acting on\r\nthe well-established principle that a small library well cataloged, if\r\nat all adapted in the number of its volumes to the size of a town, is of\r\nincalculably greater advantage to its constituency than one many times\r\nlarger but poorly equipped with catalogs.\r\n\r\nIt is a distinctive feature of the Quincy plan not to make the library a\r\nspecial reference library. That city is very near Boston and Cambridge,\r\nwhich it is well known are richly supplied with large general and\r\nnumerous special libraries.\r\n\r\nWhen a man appears in Quincy who wishes to make a minute inquiry on some\r\nspecial subject, it is proposed to refer him to the great libraries in\r\nthe neighboring cities, and to confine the efforts of the trustees of\r\nthe Quincy library to supplying the general wants of its constituency.\r\nHere, then, is a bold attempt at adapting a library to its constituency.\r\nShall it be seconded?\r\n\r\nMany will hold it unwise to discuss such a subject publicly. Remembering\r\nmany ill-judged efforts at economy by ignorant, uneducated, or\r\nparsimonious men in town meetings and on library boards, they will\r\npronounce it hurtful to libraries to point out to such men that some\r\nlibrary experts consider it well to keep down expenses for cataloging\r\nand housing books by weeding out libraries. Perhaps they are right.\r\nWhether they are so or not, however, their objection is too late. The\r\nmatter now under consideration is undergoing public discussion, and it\r\nis important that men having special knowledge of library matters should\r\ncontribute now the results of their experience. Unreasonable men in town\r\nmeetings and in boards of trustees must be answered, and reasonable men\r\nand women need to understand thoroughly the subject in order that their\r\nanswers may be discriminating and wise.\r\n\r\nOnce, when the Librarian of Congress asked that an addition be made to\r\nthe library rooms, a member is said to have urged that instead of\r\nenlarging the Capitol, the library should be weeded out. Such a plan\r\nwould be regarded generally as exceedingly foolish.\r\n\r\nThere must be in many parts of this broad land large and growing\r\nlibraries which will aim to gather very large general and special\r\ncollections not limited to books of intrinsic merit. Such libraries will\r\nhave to get many books of little value in themselves to enable students\r\nto study subjects historically. It would indeed be very silly to weed\r\nout the Congressional Library. Somewhere there should be accessible (and\r\nwhere better than in that library?) every book, pamphlet, and map\r\npublished in the United States. The Congressional Library should be a\r\ngreat national library like the Bibliotheque Nationale and the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nThe Quincy plan would not work well even in a place the size of\r\nWorcester, Mass., with a population of only 90,000 or 95,000, and but 44\r\nmiles from Boston, for it is a center of important educational\r\ninstitutions and of inquirers, and therefore needs large reference\r\nlibraries. Cambridge, though very much nearer Boston than Quincy,\r\nbecomes, because of Harvard University, a center where there must be a\r\nlarge library. It is too great an inconvenience for Harvard professors\r\nand students to rely, except for book rarities, on libraries even so\r\nnear as those in Boston.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, consider the John Adams Library at Quincy. It was\r\ncollected by President John Adams in Europe and America, and undoubtedly\r\ncontains many valuable books. But is it in place in Quincy? It was\r\nformerly kept in the Adams Academy, but not proving useful there, it was\r\ntransferred to the Thomas Crane Public Library, where it now is. Mr.\r\nCharles Francis Adams recently said that he only knew of this John Adams\r\nLibrary having been consulted once in forty years, and that then he was\r\nhimself the consulter. It is more convenient for Mr. Adams to make his\r\nmany researches in the great libraries in Boston and Cambridge than in\r\nQuincy, and his opinion is that this library should be given to the\r\nBoston Public Library, where it would be of great value in supplementing\r\nthe collections, and would be readily accessible to the class of\r\nstudents who would use it. Perhaps, however, Quincy would be unwilling\r\nto give up this library, which marks its connection with a very\r\ndistinguished man. While it is a distinctive feature of the Quincy plan\r\nnot to make the public library a special reference library, its success\r\ndepends on having large reference libraries near at hand. In one respect\r\nit encourages making the library a special library, namely, on local\r\ninterests and history. As to the saving in expense possible under the\r\nQuincy plan, while money is saved which would ordinarily be used in\r\nhousing books and in other ways, increased expenditure, it should be\r\nremembered, is contemplated in frequent issues of improved catalogs. As\r\nI shall soon show, the plan, if well carried out, requires other\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nThere are many small libraries which do not need weeding. If a library\r\nneeds weeding, as many undoubtedly do, will it be weeded out wisely?\r\n\r\nBroad-minded intelligence is needful for this kind of work, as well as\r\neducation and experience in library work. An expert is as much needed in\r\nthis work of weeding out as in selecting books for a library at its\r\nstart. Great harm might result from injudicious discarding.\r\n\r\nAnother objection likely to be made to the Quincy plan is that it would\r\noften be difficult to decide how large a library is needed in a town or\r\ncity, and that this difficulty would be magnified in a growing town.\r\nStill, if a thing is desirable it should be done in spite of\r\ndifficulties. Foresight must be exercised and generous provision made\r\nfor the probable growth of towns, and the number of volumes changed as\r\nchanges in the size of population or other considerations demand.\r\nSupposing a mistake has been made, the weeding has been made with the\r\naccessibility in view of large and special libraries in towns and cities\r\nnear by. Those towns and cities will still remain near to the town which\r\nhas grown unexpectedly large; their libraries will still be accessible\r\nfor reference. The difference between the old state of things and the\r\nnew is likely to be that the books will be used more under changed\r\ncircumstances than formerly.\r\n\r\nBut how provide under the Quincy plan for students who can not afford\r\ntime and money to frequent the large libraries even in towns or cities\r\nnear by; and supposing this number of special inquirers becomes\r\nconsiderable, can you hope that they will receive a cordial welcome and\r\nsympathetic assistance in large neighboring libraries? Dangers here\r\nhinted at must be guarded against. Librarians and trustees should be on\r\nthe lookout for inquirers and help them to get at the books needed.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to help them by preparing and issuing often improved\r\nprinted catalogs. Personal assistance would also evidently be needed\r\nunder the new plan. In some cases it would be necessary to buy books. In\r\nothers the investigator might be introduced to the officers of the\r\nlibrary, or by some influential person to the officers of a large\r\nneighboring library with reference to his being allowed to borrow if he\r\ncould not use books on the premises. The same thing might perhaps be\r\nbetter accomplished by a loan from the large to the small library. The\r\nsmall library might have to pay for this privilege. It might be\r\ndesirable, if an investigator had leisure but not money, for the small\r\nlibrary to pay his car fare to the town where the library to be\r\nconsulted is situated.\r\n\r\nLarge libraries as now constituted are very obliging, and continually\r\nextend courtesies to smaller institutions. The people of Worcester, for\r\nexample, every week, and sometimes oftener, have books borrowed for\r\ntheir use from the Surgeon-General's library, Washington, from Harvard,\r\nthe Boston Athenaeum, Columbia, Yale, and other libraries. Many\r\ninstitutions are already extending gratuitously such privileges.\r\n\r\nSupposing it were to become the custom of small libraries to send books\r\nand pamphlets which they can get, but do not need, to large neighboring\r\nlibraries where they would be useful. Such action would lead to an\r\nexchange of various civilities. Then, too, as the desirability of having\r\nlarge libraries help smaller ones by loans of books becomes more and\r\nmore obvious, will not persons of means give money to the former to\r\nenable them to do this kind of work for small towns generally or for\r\nparticular towns in which they may be specially interested?\r\n\r\nMr. Adams's advice to libraries is, not to accumulate books\r\npromiscuously, but to practice a systematic differentiation in\r\ncollecting. Books which cumber the shelves of one library may be of the\r\ngreatest value in another. The public documents only of its own town and\r\nState, and a few of the national documents relating to matters of\r\ngeneral interest, are in place in the library of a small town. But all\r\npublic documents have come to be of the greatest service in large\r\nlibraries and in libraries connected with important educational\r\ninstitutions. Even those which seem driest, because exclusively of\r\nstatistics, are much in demand in colleges where students of history and\r\npolitical economy are required to examine original sources.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles A. Cutter said several years ago, regarding the proper\r\ndisposition of pamphlets, that local pamphlets should be given to local\r\nlibraries, professional or scientific pamphlets to special libraries,\r\nmiscellaneous and all sorts of pamphlets to larger general libraries.\r\nThis is excellent advice.\r\n\r\nEven large general libraries practice differentiation, many of them\r\nexcluding professional books and leaving special libraries in their\r\nneighborhood to accumulate them. A State library may properly make a\r\nspecialty of public documents, and perhaps law books, and pay little\r\nattention to accumulating other books. A general subscription library\r\nwith a constituency mainly of people of leisure may find it more useful\r\nto collect books in belles-lettres, biography, history, travel, etc.,\r\nthan to buy many dealing with industrial subjects. But a public library\r\nin a great manufacturing town, or a special library for architects and\r\nengineers, must specialize on technical books.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed to destroy books taken out of libraries where they\r\nare not needed, but to place them within reach of those most needing\r\nthem, either through other libraries or auction rooms or secondhand\r\nbookstores. No countenance would be given to such a proceeding as that\r\nof the administrators of the estate of the well-known collector of old\r\nbooks, Mr. T.O.P.H. Burnham, who are said to have sent a ton or more of\r\nmaterial from his stock to the paper mill.[5]\r\n\r\nThe people of Worcester act more wisely. They empty their attics into\r\nthe rooms of the American Antiquarian Society or those of the local\r\nSociety of Antiquity. Housekeepers there, too, dispose similarly of such\r\nbooks as turn up in spring cleaning and are found to be in the way. An\r\nextensive system of exchange is in operation under the auspices of the\r\nformer society, and books and pamphlets sent to the rooms of either\r\nsociety, find their way to persons and libraries where they are needed,\r\nand the two antiquarian societies enrich their collections by the\r\nexchanges made.\r\n\r\n[5] It is conceivable that after a lifetime of buying whole attics of\r\nrejected books and preserving those which no one would buy at any\r\nprice, out of an immense stock there might be a ton of duplicate\r\nschoolbooks, incomplete volumes, and other books and pamphlets which\r\ncould not even be given away to any library; since the large libraries\r\nwould have copies and the smaller ones would not esteem them worth\r\nshelf room.--M.D.\r\n\r\nCol. Thomas Wentworth Higginson recently stated that a trustee of the\r\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston, told him that he spent a considerable part\r\nof his time in refusing gifts offered to the museum. This trustee is\r\nprobably wise in declining gifts. There are many books and pamphlets\r\noffered to libraries which they would not find useful. These should be\r\naccepted only on condition that they may be placed wherever they will be\r\nmost valuable.\r\n\r\nDifferentiation is specially desirable in the smallest libraries. When\r\nbut little money is available for buying books the small amount should\r\nbe spent with closest regard to actual needs of the constituency. Not\r\ninfrequently intelligent entertainment and elementary instruction will\r\nbe the principles that should guide in selecting books for small\r\nlibraries. With intelligent cooperation several small neighboring towns\r\nmight adopt to advantage the suggestion that each of them spend a few\r\ndollars a year on a specialty, such as botany, geology, zoology; every\r\ntown taking a different specialty and all lending to one another.\r\n\r\nThis paper favors in the main the selection of books with special\r\nreference to the actual existing needs of the users of the library. Such\r\nan institution as the flourishing public library of Providence, R.I.,\r\nmight properly, if allowable for any library in cities of moderate size,\r\nadd to its general work some specialty of limited interest. Mr. Foster,\r\nits librarian, has recently stated, however, that he thinks that\r\nnotwithstanding the reputation which the famous Harris collection of\r\npoetry gives to the library throughout the country, it is the best for\r\nthat library to devote itself almost exclusively to supplying the\r\ngeneral needs of Providence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that Mr. Adams does not claim that the\r\nplan of weeding out libraries adopted at Quincy has never been thought\r\nof before. He was not indebted to any book for the idea, but it had\r\noccurred to other persons before. Action upon it had always been\r\nrecommended. Mr. Adams has taken the bull by the horns. He has put the\r\nplan in execution and to a considerable extent has systematized it. He\r\nhas also called attention to it and made it a living subject for\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION OF FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO THE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n    Presentations of Library questions to the general reading\r\n    public from authoritative sources are exceptionally hard to\r\n    find, even at the present day. The one reprinted below was\r\n    contributed to _The North American Review_ for June, 1898,\r\n    by Herbert Putnam, then librarian of the Boston Public\r\n    Library.\r\n\r\n    Herbert Putnam was born in New York, Sept. 20, 1861, the\r\n    youngest son of the founder of the publishing house. He\r\n    graduated at Harvard in 1883 and studied law. He served as\r\n    librarian in Minneapolis, first of the Atheneum and then of\r\n    the Public Library in 1884-91, meanwhile being admitted to\r\n    the bar in 1886. He practised law in Boston in 1892-95, but\r\n    in the latter year became librarian of the Boston Public\r\n    Library, serving until appointed in 1899 Librarian of\r\n    Congress. His administration has been marked by the\r\n    development of this institution along the line of service of\r\n    a national library. During the great war he was Director of\r\n    Library War Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nFree libraries have existed for less than a half a century. Their\r\nestablishment assumed that books are beneficial: but it involved also\r\nthe assertion that it is the proper function of government to supply\r\nbooks to such of its citizens as may require them at the expense of the\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\n\r\nLibraries of this special type do not yet form the major portion of the\r\ninstitutions supplying books on a large scale to groups of persons.\r\nUnder the head of \"Public, Society and School Libraries,\" these\r\ninstitutions in the United States aggregate 8,000 in number, with\r\n35,000,000 volumes, with $34,000,000 invested in buildings, with\r\n$17,000,000 of endowments, and with over $6,000,000 of annual income. Of\r\nthese the free public libraries supported by general taxation number\r\nless than 2,000, with 10,000,00 volumes, and with less than $3,500,000\r\nof annual income. They are, however, increasing with disproportionate\r\nand amazing rapidity. In Massachusetts, but 10 of the 353 cities and\r\ntowns, but three-fourths of one per cent. of the inhabitants now lack\r\nthem. One hundred and ten library buildings there have been the gift of\r\nindividuals. No form of private memorial is now more popular; no form of\r\nmunicipal expenditure meets with readier assent. Nor are the initiative\r\nand the expenditure left wholly to local enterprises. The Commonwealth\r\nitself takes part: extending, through a State Commission, State aid in\r\nthe form of books and continuing counsel. And Massachusetts is but one\r\nof eight States maintaining such commissions. New York State, in its\r\nsystem of traveling libraries, has gone further still in supplementing\r\ninitial aid with a continuing supply of books, and even photographs and\r\nlantern slides, purchased by the State and distributed through the\r\nRegents of the State University from Albany to the remotest hamlet.\r\n\r\nThe first stage of all such legislation is an enabling act--authorizing\r\nthe establishment of a library by the local authorities; the next is an\r\nact encouraging such establishment by bounties; and New Hampshire has\r\nreached a third by a law actually mandatory, requiring the local\r\nauthorities to establish free libraries in proportion to their means and\r\nthe population to be served. This seems to mark the high-water mark of\r\nconfidence in the utility of these institutions. It indicates that free\r\npublic libraries are to be ranked with the common schools, as\r\ninstitutions indispensable to good citizenship, whose establishment the\r\nState for its own protection must require.\r\n\r\nSo the movement has progressed, until now these 2,000 public\r\nlibraries combined are sending out each year over 30 million books, to\r\ndo their work for good or ill in the homes of the United States. The\r\nentire 2,000 result from one conviction and a uniform purpose. Yet\r\namong them there is every variety in scope and in organization. There\r\nis the hamlet library of a hundred volumes, open for a couple of hours\r\neach week in some farm house, under a volunteer custodian, maintained\r\nby the town, but enlisting private contribution through bazaars and\r\nsociables--sending out its books by the local provision dealer to its\r\nremote and scattered constituents. There is the library of the great\r\ncity, with elaborate equipment and complex organization to meet a vast\r\nand complex need. Such a library as you may find at Chicago; a city\r\nwhich, though it has two great endowed reference libraries, still\r\nconsiders its million and a half people entitled to a municipal\r\nlibrary, with a two million dollar building, studded with costly\r\nmosaics, and aided by forty branches and stations in bringing the\r\nbooks nearer each home. Or such a library as exists at Boston;\r\norganized as a City Department, under Trustees appointed by the Mayor,\r\nmaintained, like the schools, or the police, or the fire department,\r\nby general taxation; with a central building which has cost the city\r\ntwo and one-half million dollars, with ten branch libraries and\r\nseventeen delivery stations scattered through the city and reached\r\ndaily by its delivery wagons; with 700,000 books; and accommodations\r\nfor over 2,000 readers at one time; including in its equipment such\r\nspecial departments as a bindery and a printing office; requiring for\r\nits administration over 250 employes, and for its maintenance each\r\nyear a quarter of a million dollars, in addition to the proceeds of\r\nendowments; and representing in its buildings, books and equipment an\r\ninvestment of over five millions of dollars, the interest on which, at\r\nfour per cent., to the expenditure for maintenance, is equivalent to\r\nan annual burden of $450,000 for its creation and support.\r\n\r\nWhen this function was first proposed for a municipality, the argument\r\nused was that in this country books had come to be the principal\r\ninstruments of education; that the community was already supporting a\r\npublic school system; that this system brought a youth to the threshold\r\nof education and there left him; that it qualified him to use books, but\r\ndid nothing to put books within his reach; and finally that it was of\r\n\"paramount importance that the means of general information should be so\r\ndiffused that the largest possible number of persons should be induced\r\nto read and understand questions going down to the very foundation of\r\nsocial order, which are constantly presenting themselves, and which we,\r\nas a people, are constantly required to decide, and do decide, either\r\nignorantly or wisely.\"\r\n\r\nA glance at the libraries now in operation in the United States shows\r\nthat the ends proposed for them fall far short of the service which they\r\nactually perform. They begin with the child before he leaves school;\r\nwhile he is still in his elementary studies they furnish to him books\r\nwhich stir his imagination, and bring the teaching of the text books\r\ninto relation with the art and with life. They thus help to render more\r\nvivid the formal studies pursued; but they also prepare the child to\r\nbecome an intelligent constituent hereafter. This work cannot begin too\r\nearly, for four-fifths of the children pass out into active life without\r\nreaching the high schools. It need not be deferred, for now the number\r\nis almost countless of books that touch with imagination and charm of\r\nstyle even the most elementary subjects; and the library can add\r\nillustrations which through the eye convey an impression of the largest\r\nsubjects in the most elemental way.\r\n\r\nIf the library begins with the citizen earlier than was foreseen, it is\r\nprepared to accompany him further than was thought necessary. It\r\nresponds not only to the needs of the general reader, but also to those\r\nof the student and even, to the extent of its means, to those of the\r\nscholar engaged in special research. The maintenance of universities at\r\nthe common expense is familiar in the West; it is less so in the East.\r\nAnd there is still contention that institutions for highly specialized\r\ninstruction should not be charged upon the community as a whole. But no\r\none has questioned the propriety of charging upon the community the\r\nsupport of a library whose leading purpose may be the encouragement of\r\nthe higher scholarship.\r\n\r\nFinally, to the services just above described the public library has\r\nadded another: the supply of books for proposes purely recreative. This\r\nservice, if anticipated, was certainly not explicitly argued for; nor\r\nwas it implied in Edward Everett's prediction that the public library\r\nwould prove the \"intellectual common\" of the community. The common that\r\nMr. Everett had in mind was a pasturage, not a baseball ground, or\r\nlover's walk, or a loafing place for tramps.\r\n\r\nBut as regards certain of the books customarily supplied, the ordinary\r\npublic library of to-day is furnishing recreation rather than\r\ninstruction. In fact, if we look at the history of free public libraries\r\nin this country, we find that the one point of practice on which they\r\nhave been criticised is the supply of merely recreative literature. The\r\nprotest has come from thoughtful persons, and it means something,\r\nlightly as it has been waved aside.\r\n\r\nThe excuse that used to be given for the supply of inferior books was\r\nthat they would entice to the use of the better books. There was to be\r\nreached a mass of persons of inferior taste and imperfect education.\r\nThese persons must be introduced gradually to an acquaintance with the\r\nbetter class of reading through the medium of the familiar. And, at all\r\nevents, it was better that they should read something than not read at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI am not quite so confident of the regenerating virtue of mere printed\r\nmatter as such; and I am confident that the reading of a book inferior\r\nin style and taste debases taste, and that the book which sets forth,\r\neven with power, a false view of society does harm to the reader, and is\r\nso far an injury to the community of which he is part. But even granting\r\nthe premises, the conclusion is doubtful. We do not deliberately furnish\r\npoor art at public expense because there is a portion of the public\r\nwhich cannot appreciate the better. Nor when the best is offered,\r\nwithout apology, does the uncultured public in fact complain that it is\r\ntoo \"advanced.\" Thousands of \"ordinary\" people come to see and enjoy the\r\nAbbey and Chavannes and Sargent decorations in the Boston Public\r\nLibrary. No one has yet complained that the paintings are too advanced\r\nfor him. The best of art is not too good for the least of men, provided\r\nhe can be influenced at all. Nor are the best of books too good for him,\r\nprovided he can be influenced, and provided they are permitted, as are\r\nthe pictures to make their appeal directly. They must not be secluded\r\nbehind catalogs and formal paraphernalia. The practice which admitted\r\nthe scholar to the shelves, and limited the general reader to the\r\ncatalogues, gave the best opportunity to him who least needed it. The\r\nmodern practice sets before the reader least familiar with good _titles_\r\na selection of good _books_. It places them on open shelves where he can\r\nhandle them without formality. The result is almost invariably, that he\r\nis attracted to a book in advance of his previous tastes. Perhaps a\r\nchance paragraph appeals to some experience or ambition, or an\r\nillustration stirs his imagination. The books themselves draw him\r\noutside of his previous limitations.\r\n\r\nIn the place, therefore, of books inferior in quality, the more modern\r\npublic library seeks to attract by the freest possible access to books\r\nof the best quality. Not that this practice is universal. But the\r\nopinion and tendency are in this safe direction.\r\n\r\nHowever, quality assumed, the general question as to the reading of\r\nrecreative literature remains. What shall we say of the fact that sixty\r\nper cent. of the circulation of the free public libraries still consists\r\nof fiction?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, that this percentage takes no account of reference\r\nuse, which is almost wholly of serious literature; second, that as to\r\nhome use the ratio in circulation of fiction to serious literature does\r\nnot represent a similar ratio of trivial to serious service. Fiction is\r\nthe small coin of literature. It must circulate more rapidly to\r\nrepresent the same volume of real business done. A volume of fiction may\r\nbe issued, returned and reissued three times while a biography or\r\nhistory or work of science is issued once. It will then count\r\nseventy-five per cent. in the circulation. But the serious book has\r\nduring the entire period been out in the hands of the reader; and the\r\nservice which it has performed--the period of attention which it has\r\noccupied--equals that of the novel in its three issues. And, finally,\r\nthere is to be considered the influence of the best fiction toward\r\ngeneral culture (if the library is not merely to inform but also to\r\ncultivate)--in broadening the sympathies, giving a larger tolerance, a\r\nkindlier humanity, a more intelligent helpfulness; in affording the rest\r\nthat is in itself an equipment for work, and the distraction that may\r\nsave from impulse to evil.\r\n\r\nHowever, the amount of fiction circulated in proportion to the total\r\nwork of the library is on the average steadily decreasing. At the same\r\ntime the quality is improving; in part through critical selection, in\r\npart as a happy result of the fact that the inferior novels are also, as\r\na rule, inferior books, so poorly manufactured that libraries cannot\r\nafford to buy them.\r\n\r\nBut there is standard fiction and current fiction; and it is the current\r\nfiction that constitutes by itself a special problem still perplexing.\r\nIt is a problem that concerns not the uneducated child, nor the\r\nilliterate adult; it is caused by the people of intelligent education\r\nwho are avid to read the latest novel by Mr. X. or Mrs. Y. while it is\r\nstill the latest novel by Mr. X. or Mrs. Y. It is being talked about at\r\ndinner or afternoon tea. Well-informed people are reading it; to read it\r\nis a social necessity.\r\n\r\nThe reason that presses the public library to supply promptly every\r\nmost recent book in the domain of scientific literature is apparent\r\nenough. Such literature contributes facts which are the data for action.\r\nBut novels in general belong to the literature of power. Their purpose\r\nis not to furnish information but to give pleasure. Literature of this\r\nsort adds no new fact, nor is it superseded, nor does it lose any of its\r\nvalue by lapse of time. To assume that it does would be to assume that\r\nbeauty of form could become obsolete. This is not so in painting, in\r\nsculpture, in architecture; why should it be so in prose fiction, in\r\npoetry, in the drama? Was there, in fact, an aesthetic value in the\r\nCanterbury Tales in 1380, in Hamlet in 1602, in Ivanhoe in 1819, that is\r\nnot to be found in them in 1898?\r\n\r\nBut a large portion of latter day fiction is fiction with a purpose;\r\nanother way of saying that it is a work of art composed for the\r\ndissemination of doctrine. This element promotes it at once to the\r\ndignity of a treatise; a new view of politics, a new criticism of social\r\nconditions, a new creed! Here is something that concerns the student of\r\nsociology. And surely his needs are worthy of prompt response.\r\n\r\nIn fact, his needs and the general curiosity do get prompt response, and\r\nthe new novels are freely bought. How freely I have recently sought to\r\nascertain. I asked of some seventy libraries their yearly expenditure\r\nfor current fiction in proportion to their total expenditure for books.\r\nThe returns show an average of from ten to fifteen per cent. In one case\r\nthe amount reached fifty per cent., in others it fell as low as two per\r\ncent. The ratio for fiction in general is much higher on the average;\r\nbut fiction in general includes Scott and Thackeray and other standards,\r\nan ample supply of which would not usually be questioned. At Providence\r\nand Worcester, two of the most active and popular of public libraries,\r\nthe purchases of fiction, current and standard, formed last year but\r\nseven and eleven per cent., respectively, of the entire expenditure for\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nAt Boston there were selected but 178 titles of current fiction (out of\r\nnearly 600 read and considered). But some dozen copies were bought of\r\neach title, so that the entire purchases reached 2,300 volumes and cost\r\nabout $2,300. This was about six and a half per cent. on a total\r\nexpenditure for books of $34,000. At St. Louis the practise is to buy\r\nbut two copies out of the general funds to be circulated free. Nearly a\r\nhundred more are added which are rented out and thus pay for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe statistics do not seem to show that the initial expenditure for\r\ncurrent fiction is very alarming. But the purchase price of these books\r\nis but a fraction of the expense of handling them. They cannot be\r\nsupplied in adequate quantities; for while the frenzy of curiosity\r\npersists, an adequate supply is beyond the resources of any library. But\r\nsince the attempt to supply is futile the pretense is injurious. The\r\npresence of the titles in the catalogues misleads the reader into a\r\nmultitude of applications which are a heavy expense to the library\r\nwithout benefit to him. And the acquisition of the single book means to\r\nthe library the expense of handling a hundred applications for it which\r\nare futile to one that can be honored. In this sense a current novel\r\ninvolves perhaps a hundred times the expense of any other book in being\r\nsupplied to but the same number of readers.\r\n\r\nThe British museum acquires the new novels as published; but it\r\nwithholds them from the readers until five years after their date of\r\npublication. It is my personal belief that a one year limitation of this\r\nsort adopted by our free libraries generally would relieve them of\r\nanxiety and expense and their readers of inconvenience and delusion.\r\n\r\nBut as regards current light literature in general it is worth while to\r\nconsider whether the responsibility of public libraries has not been\r\nmodified by the growth and diffusion of the newspaper and periodical\r\npress. In 1850, when the free public library was started, the number of\r\nnewspapers and periodicals published in the United States was about\r\n2,500; now it is nearly 20,000. The total annual issues have increased\r\nfrom 400 million to over 4-1/2 billion copies.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary daily of 1850 contained perhaps a single column of literary\r\nmatter. To-day it contains, for the same price, seven columns. In 1850\r\nit gave no space to fiction; now it offers Kipling, Howells, Stockton,\r\nBret Harte, Anthony Hope, Crockett, Bourget and many others of the best\r\nof the contemporary writers of fiction.\r\n\r\nThen there are the cheap magazines, which tender a half dozen stories\r\nfor the price of a cigar or a bodkin. There are, also, the cheap\r\n\"libraries,\" which have flooded the United States with engaging\r\nliterature available to almost any purse.\r\n\r\nIn short, conditions have altered. A vast mass of light literature is\r\nnow cheaply accessible to the individual which formerly could be\r\nacquired only painfully or at great expense. Why then should the public\r\nlibraries struggle to supply it in book form at the public expense?\r\n\r\nBut as to a certain percentage of current light literature there is an\r\nembarrassment that I have not touched. It is the embarrassment of making\r\nselection without giving offense. All cannot be bought. A choice must be\r\nmade. With reference to standard literature authoritative judgement is\r\nnot difficult to obtain. But here there has been no lapse of time to\r\nbalance opinion. An anticipatory estimate must be attempted and\r\nattempted by the library itself.\r\n\r\nNow, if the library decide against the book it is very likely held to\r\nblame for \"dictating\" to its readers. \"It is one thing,\" says a journal\r\ncommenting on an adverse decision, \"it is one thing to consider this\r\nnovel pernicious, but it is another and more serious thing for the\r\nforemost library in the country maintained at public expense, to deny to\r\na large and respectable portion of the public an opportunity to judge\r\nfor itself whether the work of a man of (this author's) calibre is\r\npernicious or not.\"\r\n\r\nThe author in this case was, of course, not Mr. X., but rather Mr. A.,\r\nan already known quantity.\r\n\r\nSo a library is not to be permitted to apply a judgement of its own! It\r\nis not protected by the fact that this judgment coincides with the\r\njudgment of professional critics--so far at least as these may be\r\nascertained. The author may have turned perverse and written a book\r\ndistinctly bad. Yet this book is to be bought and supplied to enable\r\neach member of the public to form a judgment of his own upon it. And it\r\nis to be so bought out of public funds entrusted to the library for\r\neducational purposes. Censorship has to us an ugly sound; but does the\r\nlibrary act as censor when it declares a book beyond its province? Does\r\nit dictate what the people shall read when it says, \"We decline to buy\r\nthis book for you with public funds\"?\r\n\r\nThis is a question which is far larger than the selection or rejection\r\nof a novel or two. It involves the whole question of authority, and it\r\nconcerns not merely the extremes, but the varying degrees of worth in\r\nliterature. Most departments of educational work are founded upon\r\nprinciples, cautiously ascertained, and systematically adhered to. Their\r\nconsistent maintenance upon principle is the easier because each other\r\nsuch department deals with a special constituency, limited either in age\r\nor perhaps in sex, or at least in purpose, and one which accepts as\r\nauthoritative the system provided for it. The free public library,\r\nhowever, has to satisfy a constituency practically unlimited, including\r\nevery age of both sexes, whose intellectual need ranges from that of the\r\nmost illiterate to that of the most highly accomplished, whose education\r\nin books ranges from that of the person who has never entered a library\r\nto that of the scholar whose life has been a perpetual training in the\r\nuse of the library; the assertive classes, the bashful classes. And if\r\ntoward this vast and heterogeneous constituency it seeks to assume the\r\nposition of an educator, it finds that its authority is one which the\r\nconstituents themselves are unanimously unwilling to concede. Each\r\nconstituent deems himself not a beneficiary accepting some service, but\r\na proprietor demanding it. Now, within each community there are persons\r\nwho would have every kind of printed matter published. If, therefore, a\r\npublic library exists simply to respond to the demands of its readers,\r\nwe must have, instead of an educational system devised by experts and\r\nadministered with reference to general principles, a system fluctuating\r\nwith each eccentric requirement of individuals, indefinite in number,\r\nvarious in taste and culture, inexpert, except as each may be competent\r\nto judge his own need, incapable of expression in the aggregate, and as\r\nindividuals without responsibility for the general results.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, an authority is to be vested in the library, what\r\nlimits shall it set upon itself, upon what principles of discrimination\r\nshall it proceed, in what directions may it expediently control? I but\r\nstate the problem. I shall not endeavor to answer it. But it is one of\r\nthe most important involved in the relation of the public library to the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nFrom such questions an ordinary educational institution stands aloof. It\r\nis content to represent the judgment of the majority in matters of\r\nmorality and to inculate the lesson of tried truths as against untried\r\nfancies in matters of opinion affecting the social order. It thus throws\r\nits influence in favor of the established order of things. But its\r\nright, nay, its duty, to do this is unquestioned. Nor is it regarded as\r\ndisparaging the opinion which it does not teach.\r\n\r\nBut a public library is not so exempt. In addition to the doctrine\r\nwhich is accepted, it is held to have a duty to the opinion which is\r\nstruggling for recognition. As to minority opinion, it is not so much a\r\nuniversity as a forum. Nay, it is to give every advantage to minority\r\nopinion, for--in our resentment of intolerance--minority opinion is not\r\nmerely tolerated, it is pampered.\r\n\r\nNow, it is not for libraries or librarians to act as censors and\r\ndenounce this or that publication. Yet it is to be remembered that a\r\nlibrary which circulates a book helps to promulgate the doctrine which\r\nthe book contains. And if public libraries circulate books which teach\r\nrestless, irreverent or revolutionary doctrines, they offer us the\r\nincongruity of a municipality aiding in the propagation of ideas which\r\nare subversive of social order.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if there is to be exclusion on such grounds, where is\r\nthe line of exclusion to be drawn? Shall we say at doctrines which, if\r\ncarried into action, would be criminal under the law? Would the public\r\nrest content with this?\r\n\r\nMoreover, the principle of exclusion accepted, who is to apply it? Whose\r\njudgment shall determine whether the particular book does or does not\r\noffend? Shall the library determine? But will it not then be \"dictating\"\r\nto its readers? Will it not be unduly discriminating against a certain\r\nclass of opinion when it has undertaken to represent impartially all\r\nshades of opinion? Will it not offend the remonstrant against the\r\nexisting order of things who has a grievance, and, therefore, a right to\r\nbe heard; and the defender of the existing order of things who must know\r\nthe opinion in order to combat it; and the student of sociology whose\r\ncuriosity reaches all extremes and regards them simply as phenomena upon\r\nwhich he is entitled to be informed?\r\n\r\nI believe that it will. And yet I do not see how the library can escape\r\nexercising judgment. For there is no other responsible authority which\r\ncan be brought to exercise it. We must then expect numerous decisions\r\nwhich will offend a portion of the community. They will usually be on\r\nthe conservative side--of exclusion. And it is for those who believe\r\nthat a public library should be a conservative influence in the\r\ncommunity to see that it has the authority and is protected in its\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nNot that in respect of the violent books there is great injury in\r\npresent conditions. In the public libraries of to-day there exists no\r\ndoubt material sufficiently anarchic to upset society, if it could have\r\nits will upon society. The fact is, that though there is plenty in\r\nliterature that is incendiary, there is little in our community that is\r\ninflammable.\r\n\r\nThe good that the libraries do is obvious and acknowledged. They\r\nrepresent the accumulated experience of mankind brought to our service.\r\nThey are the custodians of whatever is most worthy of preservation in\r\nour own life and literature. They are the natural depositories of what\r\nwe have of memorial and of records; the original entries of legislation\r\nand of achievement. They must render history available; they must\r\nadequately exhibit science; they may help to refine by the best examples\r\nin each art, and in this they may also contribute to the industrial life\r\nof the community by educating the artisan into an artist, his craft into\r\nan art. And through record and description of processes and inventions\r\nthey may contribute to the foundations of great industries. They touch\r\nthe community as a whole as perhaps does no other single organized\r\nagency for good. They offer to the shyest ignorance equality with the\r\nmost confident scholarship, and demand no formal preliminary which might\r\nabash ignorance.\r\n\r\nThey have a profound duty--not generally appreciated--to help render\r\nhomogeneous the very heterogeneous elements of our population. Thirty\r\nper cent. of it has come to us from an alien life and alien\r\ninstitutions. One-third of the people in our six leading cities are of\r\nforeign birth; seventy-one per cent. were either born abroad or born of\r\nforeign parentage. In the assimilation of this foreign element no single\r\nagency is perhaps so potent as our public libraries.\r\n\r\nThe public libraries deem themselves the allies of formal educational\r\nprocesses; but also the direct educators of that part of the community\r\nnot subject to the formal processes. It is this latter responsibility\r\nwhich has led them to attempt a broader service than the mere supply of\r\nbooks. A book is not the only nor necessarily the most effective vehicle\r\nfor conveying knowledge. There are illustrations which more directly\r\nconvey an impression, and often as fully state a fact. And photographs\r\nand process reproductions are now part of the equipment of a public\r\nlibrary almost as conventional as books. Within the past year 10,000\r\nsuch have been added to the collections of the Boston Public Library;\r\nnot as works of art (they are for the most part cheap silver prints and\r\nthe Art Museum is but a hundred feet distant); nor merely as aids to the\r\nstudy of the fine arts and the useful arts, but also as convenient\r\nauxiliaries to the study of history, of literature and institutions. And\r\nthey are used by individuals and by classes not as a substitute for the\r\ntext, but as helping to render vivid the lesson of the text.\r\n\r\nWith these go lectures in exposition. Every building of importance\r\nrecently designed for the uses of a public library includes an art\r\ngallery and a lecture hall. What an immense augmentation of function\r\nthis implies! It implies that the library is no longer merely an\r\naggregate of books, each passive within rigid limits; but that it is an\r\nactive agent having under its control material which is kept plastic and\r\nwhich it moulds into incredibly varied shapes to suit incredibly varied\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the Boston Public Library shows that in the case of\r\nbooks each increase of facilities creates an increased demand. The\r\ntrustees of 1852 boasted that they were providing for as many as fifty\r\nreaders at a time; the trustees of 1887 thought themselves venturesome\r\nin providing for 500 readers at a time; and within a month after the new\r\nbuilding was opened it was forced to accommodate over 700 at a time.\r\nEvery week over 30,000 persons enter the Central Library building, and\r\nevery year 1,200,000 volumes are drawn for home use by the 65,000\r\ncard-holders. Yet these figures represent still but a portion of the\r\npersons reached and the work to be done. Nor can facilities for\r\ndistribution keep pace with the need. For a city of a half million\r\npeople spread over an area of forty square miles adequate library\r\nfacilities cannot ever be provided. A municipality which even\r\napproximates the adequate in providing buildings, equipment,\r\nadministration and general literature at the public expense must still\r\nlook to private gift for the specialized material necessary to a great\r\nreference collection. That the Boston Public Library is next to the\r\nBritish Museum in Shakespeariana is, to be sure, the result of a special\r\nexpenditure by the city. But the larger part of its special collections\r\nwhich have given it distinction as a great scholars' library, has come\r\nfrom private gift; the Ticknor collection of Spanish literature, the\r\nBowditch collection of mathematics, the Chamberlain collection of\r\nautographs, the Brown collection of music and many others. And a city\r\nwhich erects for its public library a building which is monumental is\r\nputting forward the most attractive invitation to private gift. The\r\ngifts which have come to Boston as the direct result of the new building\r\nhave already reached a twelfth of its cost.\r\n\r\nWith proper organization and a liberal co-operation between municipal\r\nand private effort the opportunities for service are almost limitless.\r\nThe risk is the greater of attempts at service either legally\r\ninappropriate or practically inexpedient, and the risk is not lessened\r\nby a popular appreciation which is more enthusiastic than it is apt to\r\nbe discriminating. There is, therefore, the greater need of\r\ndiscrimination on the part of the library itself and of an authority\r\nwhich will protect its exercise. This authority can be conferred only by\r\nintelligent public opinion on the part of those who are capable of\r\nappreciating constitutional limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC LIBRARY: ITS USES TO THE MUNICIPALITY\r\n\r\n    Written for the National Municipal League and printed in\r\n    _The Library Journal_ for June, 1903, eight years after the\r\n    author, Dr. John S. Billings, had begun his service as\r\n    director of the New York Public Library; largely a defence\r\n    of libraries against certain objections. The statement of\r\n    the part played by \"sentiment\" in popular institutions, and\r\n    its justification, are striking and true.\r\n\r\n    John Shaw Billings was born in Switzerland County, Ind., in\r\n    1839, graduated from Miami University in 1857, studied\r\n    medicine and after serving as a surgeon in the Civil War,\r\n    was assigned to the Surgeon General's Office in Washington,\r\n    of whose library he compiled the 16-volume Index Catalogue.\r\n    After service in Johns Hopkins and Pennsylvania Universities\r\n    he was chosen in 1895 director of the newly established New\r\n    York Public Library, where he served until his death in\r\n    1913, planning and supervising the construction of its\r\n    central building.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great majority of cities of 25,000 inhabitants and upward in the\r\nUnited States have public libraries of some sort, and the same is true\r\nof many of the smaller cities. Many of these libraries have been founded\r\non gifts of individuals, some have developed from subscription\r\nlibraries, but the majority are now supported mainly or entirely by\r\nfunds appropriated by the city government. A considerable number are\r\nstill in the formative stage, this being true of those for which\r\nbuildings are being erected from funds provided by Mr. Carnegie and for\r\nseveral hundred others for which he will probably provide buildings in\r\nthe near future.\r\n\r\nThere may be excessive and unjustifiable taxation for the support of a\r\npublic library--the amount which the city can afford for this purpose\r\nshould be carefully considered in connection with its needs for a pure\r\nwater supply and good sewage disposal, for means of communication, for\r\nthe care of the sick poor and for public schools. Each case must be\r\njudged by itself; the only general rule I have to suggest is that in the\r\ndepartment of education the claims of the public library for support are\r\nmore important than those of municipal college or high school. The\r\npeople who have no taxable property, and who therefore often erroneously\r\nsuppose that they contribute nothing toward the payment of the taxes,\r\nare usually quite willing to have a higher tax rate imposed for the\r\npurpose of securing for themselves and their families free library\r\nfacilities--although in exceptional cases religious or sociological\r\nopinions may lead them to oppose it.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of taxpayers on the other hand, are more or less\r\nreluctant to have their assessments increased for this purpose, and\r\ntheir arguments should be considered and met. They are:\r\n\r\n1. That they should not be taxed for things they do not want and never\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n2. That furnishing free books tends to pauperize the community and to\r\ndiscourage the purchase of books for home use.\r\n\r\n3. That there is no evidence that free public libraries improve the\r\ncommunity materially or morally.\r\n\r\n4. That the greater part of the books used are works of fiction and that\r\nthese are injurious to the readers.\r\n\r\n5. That most of the arguments used in favor of free public libraries are\r\nmerely sentimental and emotional.\r\n\r\nThe first of these reasons would apply also to taxes for public schools,\r\nstreet paving, sewerage, and many other items of municipal expenditure\r\nand has no weight.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second argument it is not a sufficient reply to say\r\nthat every one pays through the taxes, for this would apply equally well\r\nto free lodging houses, free lunchrooms and soup kitchens, free fuel,\r\netc., all of which it generally believed tend to pauperize a city,\r\nexcept in great and special emergencies. The proper answer is that the\r\nfree public library is an important and, indeed, necessary part of the\r\nsystem of free education which is required to secure intelligent\r\ncitizens in our form of popular government, and that while in a few very\r\nexceptional cases free schools and free libraries may tend to\r\nimprovidence or indolence or even to certain forms of crime, these rare\r\ncases are of no importance in comparison with the benefits which\r\neducation confers upon the immense majority of the community and with\r\nthe fact that without free schools and libraries a large part of the\r\npeople will not be sufficiently educated to be useful citizens.\r\n\r\nWith the regard to the third count, the public library, again, may be\r\nconsidered together with the public school. While it is difficult to\r\ntrace to either specific instances of material or moral improvement, it\r\nis certain that the general diffusion of intelligence which both\r\ncertainly effect does result beneficially in these directions.\r\nCommunities with flourishing free schools and libraries are usually more\r\nprosperous and better than those without such facilities, and, while\r\nthere is doubtless room here for a confusion of cause and effect, it is\r\nprobable that there is both action and reaction. Prosperity calls for\r\nincreased facilities for education and these in turn tend to make the\r\ncommunity more prosperous.\r\n\r\nThat the majority of books withdrawn from public libraries are works of\r\nfiction cannot be denied. Many librarians are wont to deplore this fact,\r\nand most libraries endeavor in one way or another to decrease the\r\npercentage of fiction in their circulation.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of recreative reading in a public library is necessarily\r\nlarge. In like manner, the greater proportion of those who visit a\r\nzoological or botanical garden do so for amusement. Yet the information\r\nthat they secure in so doing is none the less valuable and both are\r\ncertainly educational institutions. So if in the public library a large\r\nnumber of its users get their history, their travel and their biography\r\nthrough the medium of recreative readings we should not complain. Were\r\nit otherwise these readers would probably lack altogether the\r\ninformation that they now certainly acquire.\r\n\r\nTaking up the final count in the indictment, it is doubtless true that\r\nsentimental and emotional considerations have had much to do with\r\nlibrary development. They have furnished the initial motive power, as\r\nthey have for free schools, for the origin and progress of democratic\r\ngovernment, and for most of the advances of civilization. They often\r\nprecede deliberate, conscious reasoning and judgment, yet they are often\r\nthemselves the result of an unconscious reasoning process producing\r\naction of the will in advance of deliberate judgment. Sometimes they are\r\npure reflexes, like winking when the eye is threatened by a blow. The\r\nfree public library can neither be established nor maintained usefully\r\nwithout their aid, but their methods--or want of method--must be\r\ncarefully guided to produce good results.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment that we ought to establish institutions for the diffusion\r\nof knowledge is the expression of a real economic need and should be\r\ndirected and encouraged and not suppressed. Logic is a useful steering\r\napparatus, but a very poor motive power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY: A PLEA FOR ITS RECOGNITION\r\n\r\n    Delivered by Frederick M. Crunden before the Library Section\r\n    of the International Congress of Arts and Science, held in\r\n    connection with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St.\r\n    Louis in 1904, closes with a summary of the public library's\r\n    functions that remains measurably true to-day, although, of\r\n    course, it could now be somewhat expanded.\r\n\r\n    A sketch of Mr. Crunden appears in Vol. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Louisiana Purchase Exposition is an epitome of the life and activity\r\nof the world--from the naked Negrito to the grande dame with her\r\nelaborate Paris costume, from the rude wigwam of the red Indian to the\r\nWorld's Fair palace filled with the finest furniture, rugs and\r\ntapestries, sculpture and painting, and decorations that the highest\r\ntaste and finest technique can produce--from the monotonous din of the\r\nsavage tom-tom to the uplifting and enthralling strains of a great\r\nsymphony orchestra--from fire by friction, the first step of man beyond\r\nthe beast, to the grand electric illumination that makes of these\r\ngrounds and buildings the most beautiful art-created spectacle that ever\r\nmet the human eye. And to all this magnificent appeal to the senses are\r\nsuperadded the marvels of modern science and its applications--the\r\nwonders of the telescope, the microscope and the spectroscope, the\r\ntelegraph, in its latest wireless extension, the electric motor and\r\nelectric light, the telephone and the phonograph, the Roentgen ray and\r\nthe new-found radium.\r\n\r\nAnd now after this vision of wondrous beauty, this triumph of the grand\r\narts of architecture and sculpture and landscape--of all the arts, fine\r\nand useful--has for six months enraptured the senses of people from all\r\nquarters of the globe, the learned men of the world have gathered here\r\nto set forth and discuss the fundamental principals that underlie the\r\nsciences, their correlations and the methods of their application to the\r\narts of life--to summarize the progress of the past, to discuss the\r\ncondition of the present and attempt, perhaps, a forecast of the future.\r\n\r\nIn the scheme of classification, our subject appears in the last\r\ndepartment that concerns itself with man's purely mundane affairs, and\r\nis the last section in that department. It thus appears properly as a\r\nclimax and summary of the arts and sciences intelligible to man in his\r\npresent stage of existence; and if the problem of the future life is\r\never solved this side of the grave, the knowledge conserved and\r\ndisseminated by the library will be the starting-point and the\r\ninspiration of the advance, as it has been of all progress since the art\r\nof written speech was invented. \"The library is the reservoir of the\r\ncommon social life of the race. It is at once the accumulator and the\r\ntransmitter of social energy.\" Without the library the highest social\r\nculture is impossible; and a most moderate degree could be achieved by\r\nvery few.\r\n\r\nUnder the main division, \"Social Culture,\" the library is one of the\r\nfive sections in the Department of Education. In education are summed up\r\nall the achievements of the past and the possibilities of the future. In\r\nthe words of Wendell Phillips, \"Education is the one thing worthy the\r\ndeep, controlling anxiety of the thoughtful man.\" \"Education,\" exclaims\r\nMazzini, \"and my whole doctrine is included and summed up in this grand\r\nword.\" It is practically a truism that Jules Simon utters when he says\r\n\"Le peuple qui a les meilleures ecoles est le premier peuple; s'il ne\r\nl'est pas aujourd'hui il le sera demain.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this Department of Education, with its grades, the School, the\r\nCollege and the University, the Library is assigned the last section. It\r\nbelongs there in chronological order of development as an active factor\r\nin popular instruction and enlightenment; and, furthermore, the\r\npresentation of its claims and functions comes naturally after those of\r\nthe other factors in education, because it is an essential coadjutor and\r\nsupplement to each and all. It is a summary and a climax. There have\r\nalways been libraries, and they have always been a factor in education;\r\nbut the public, free, tax-supported library is but just half a century\r\nold, and could hardly be considered out of the long clothes of infancy\r\ntill the year 1876; while its general acceptance as an essential\r\nsupplement to the public school and a co-ordinate factor with the\r\ncollege and university may be considered the accomplishment of the last\r\ndecade. There are still teachers who look on general reading as an\r\ninterference with school work and an extra burden on their shoulders.\r\n\r\nWe start, then, with the axiomatic proposition that all human progress\r\ndepends on education; and no elaborate demonstration is necessary to\r\nshow that the library is an essential factor in every grade of\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nHigher education, certainly, cannot dispense with the library. The\r\nwell-known dictum of Carlyle, \"The true university of modern times is a\r\ncollection of books,\" was accepted as a striking statement of a man with\r\nrhetorical habit, without, perhaps, a realization of its full\r\nsignificance. It has been recently expanded into a more express and\r\nspecific tribute to the importance of the library in university\r\neducation. In an address delivered in St. Louis and afterwards published\r\nin the _North American Review_, President Harper said:\r\n\r\n\"The place occupied by libraries and laboratories in the educational\r\nwork of to-day, as compared with that of the past, is one of commanding\r\nimportance. Indeed, the library and the laboratory have already\r\npractically revolutionized the methods of higher education. In the\r\nreally modern institution, the chief building is the library. It is the\r\ncenter of institutional activity.... That factor of college work, the\r\nlibrary, fifty years ago almost unknown, to-day already the center of\r\nthe institution's intellectual activity, half a century hence, with its\r\nsister, the laboratory, almost equally unknown fifty years ago, will\r\nhave absorbed all else and will have become the institution itself.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the value of the library in elementary education Doctor Harris\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"What there is good in our American system points towards the\r\npreparation of the pupil for the independent study of the book by\r\nhimself. It points towards acquiring the ability of self-education by\r\nmeans of the library.\"\r\n\r\nI might quote similar utterances from many other eminent educators as to\r\nthe value--the necessity--of the library in early education; but I can\r\nthink of no stronger summing-up of the subject, nor from higher\r\nauthority, than this statement from President Eliot:\r\n\r\n\"From the total training during childhood there should result in the\r\nchild a taste for interesting and improving reading, which should direct\r\nand inspire its subsequent intellectual life. That schooling which\r\nresults in this taste for good reading, however unsystematic or\r\neccentric the schooling may have been, has achieved a main end of\r\nelementary education; and that schooling which does not result in\r\nimplanting this permanent taste has failed.... The uplifting of the\r\ndemocratic masses depends on this implanting at school of the taste for\r\ngood reading.\"\r\n\r\nTo persons who have given little thought to educational questions these\r\nutterances will have the weight that attaches to the highest authority;\r\nbut we need no university president or national commissioner to tell us\r\nthese facts. We have learned them from our own experience; and,\r\nenlightened as we now are, it seems to us strange that question could\r\never have been raised as to the essential character of the library in\r\nelementary education. Yet there are some of us, I am sure, who can\r\nrecall painful consequences from putting into practice an educational\r\ntheory not generally accepted by the pedagogues of our childhood days.\r\n\r\nWe know that higher education is impossible without a library, for the\r\nlibrary is the storehouse of the world's knowledge, the record of\r\nhumanity's achievements, the history of mankind's trials and sorrows and\r\nsufferings, of its victories and defeats and of its gradual progress\r\nupwards in spite of frequent fluctuation and failure. In this chronicle\r\nof the past lie lessons for the present and the future; from the lives\r\nof storied heroes comes the inspiration that leads the race onward and\r\nupward. A university without a library would of necessity have a very\r\nsmall and weak faculty--only the few professors who could be induced to\r\ngo where the most important instrumentality of their work was lacking:\r\nthe university that has an adequate library includes in its faculty the\r\nprofessors of all other universities and all the great teachers of all\r\ncountries and ages.\r\n\r\nBut is it worth while to consider a university without a library? Can\r\nthere be such an institution?\r\n\r\nIn higher education, then, the library is a necessity. In elementary\r\nand secondary education it is no less essential, if the most is to be\r\nmade of the few years that the average child spends in school and if he\r\nis to be started on a path of self-culture. On this point Stanley Jevons\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"In omitting that small expenditure in a universal system of libraries\r\nwhich would enable young men and women to keep up the three R's and\r\ncontinue their education, we spend L97 and stingily decline the L3\r\nreally needed to make the rest of the L100 effective.\"\r\n\r\nAt the International Library Conference in London, in 1897, one of the\r\nmost distinguished American librarians, who has been an administrator in\r\na large educational field outside of the library, expressed his view of\r\nthe supreme importance of the library in a scheme of popular education\r\nby saying that if he had to choose between the public school and the\r\npublic library--if he could have only one--(though the alternative is\r\none that never will or can be presented), he would keep the library and\r\nlet the school go. For, he argued, every child would learn to read\r\nsomehow; and, with a free library that actively sought him, he would be\r\nbetter off than if he had a school to teach him to read, but no books to\r\nread after he had learned. But however divergent might be opinions\r\nregarding this impossible alternative, there is no doubt that the public\r\nlibrary, with enlarged functions and activities, has at least equal\r\npotentialities with the school. Whether the formal instruction of the\r\nschool or the broader education of the library is of greater value,\r\ndepends on what is the chief aim. If it is merely to make breadwinners,\r\nthe school may be the more useful, though in this, too, the library is\r\nan efficient coadjutor; but if our purpose is to make men and women,\r\ncitizens of a progressive nation, active members of an aspiring society,\r\nthe library may fairly claim at least equal rank with the school. For\r\nthe school wields its direct influence over the average child but a few\r\nyears; the library is an active influence through life.\r\n\r\nAgain, more than ninety-five children out of every hundred leave school\r\nbefore they are sufficiently mature to comprehend those studies which\r\nopen their eyes to the universe, which bear upon their relations to\r\ntheir fellow-men, upon their duties as citizens of a state, as members\r\nof organized society. These are the studies that deal with the most\r\nimportant problems that mankind has to solve. They cannot be taught to\r\nchildren; they cannot be taught--dogmatically--at all. They involve the\r\nconsideration of burning questions, subjects of bitter controversy--the\r\nworld-old battle between conservatism and innovation which, as Emerson\r\nsays, \"is the subject of civil history.\" They cannot be taught by any\r\nteacher, they cannot be taught by any text-book or by any one book.\r\nTheir adequate consideration calls for the reading of many books--books\r\nof the present and the future as well as the past. The electrician who\r\nallows himself to be guided by the treatises of twenty years ago would\r\nhave no standing; neither has the economist or sociologist who has not\r\nkept up with the literature of the last thirty years--or the last three\r\nyears. It would be of no particular advantage for all of us to be\r\nelectricians. We can safely trust that field to experts; but it is\r\nextremely desirable that every man should comprehend the great issues of\r\neconomics and politics. The school cannot even PRESENT the important\r\nproblems of sociology; the university cannot adequately do so without\r\nthe library. On no other subject is the wide reading that Matthew Arnold\r\nenjoins so necessary. And no other subject is of such momentous\r\nimportance to mankind; for the betterment of social conditions is a\r\nnecessary forerunner and foundation of moral and religious progress. And\r\nthat cannot be true religion which does not lead to social betterment.\r\nIn that noblest aspiration ever put into the mouth and mind and heart\r\n(too often, alas, only the mouth!) of man we are taught to pray not that\r\nwe may be transplanted to a better world, but that God's kingdom may\r\ncome and His will be done in this world.\r\n\r\nWe are not likely to abate our eagerness in the pursuit of knowledge of\r\nphysical science, for the zeal of the scientist is stimulated by the\r\nspur of commercialism; and, though it seems impossible, the twentieth\r\ncentury may bring forth as wonderful discoveries and inventions as the\r\nnineteenth. But, to take the advance just now most sought, can any one\r\nraise the question as to which would be of greater benefit to St. Louis,\r\nto reach Chicago in an hour by airship or to take six or ten hours for\r\nthe trip and find there--and everywhere--a contented body of workmen\r\nsupplying us with the necessities of life and a set of managers carrying\r\non the transportation system that we already have on equal terms to all\r\npeople? What the world's progress most needs is \"evening up.\" The\r\nadvancing column presents a very ragged front, with physical science and\r\nits applications so far ahead that they have almost lost sight of social\r\nscience in the rear. It would be no great disadvantage to the world--to\r\nthe progress of mankind as a whole--if the swift-footed legion of\r\napplied science would merely mark time for a period, while attention\r\nshould be given to a better organization of the vast human army. The\r\nobjective point would be reached as soon, for a nation is like a railway\r\ntrain; it can go no faster than its hindmost car. But this is not likely\r\nto happen at present. Applied science has every stimulus from within and\r\nwithout, every reward intrinsic and extrinsic; while progress in the\r\nsocial and political sciences must carry the dead weight of the inertia\r\nof conservatism and also meet the active and intense opposition of\r\nvested interests, which have ever the single purpose of preserving the\r\nstatus quo, no matter how unjust or maleficent.\r\n\r\nThe solution of these all-important problems cannot be found in the\r\nschool, where immature minds are taught merely how to use the tools of\r\nknowledge; these questions cannot be settled by the small number of\r\nuniversity students; they must be solved by the education of the masses,\r\nby instilling in them in their early school years a desire for knowledge\r\nand a love for good reading, which will lead them to continue their\r\neducation by means of the library. The education of the mass of the\r\nvoters who determine the character of a democratic government, must not\r\nbe left to the party organ or the stump speaker. The great social and\r\npolitical questions should be studied and pondered in the quiet of the\r\ncloset and not decided, without previous thought, amid the hurrahs of\r\nthe hustings.\r\n\r\nTo make the public library realize fully its possibilities as the\r\nPeople's University calls for more than the opportunity which every\r\npublic library now offers; it requires active effort to reach out and\r\nbring the people to the library by the fullest co-operation with the\r\nschool and by means of attractive lecture courses, which shall stimulate\r\nreading and guide it in profitable channels. But the beginning of this\r\nwork--the inculcation of a taste for good reading--lies with the school,\r\nwith the library's co-operation, especially during the years from six to\r\nten or twelve, those years when nearly all the children come under the\r\nschool's influence and when the habit of reading can be most easily\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nIf charged with placing undue stress upon the value of the library, I\r\nmight urge its comparative newness and its consequent lack of\r\nrecognition; and, as an evidence of the latter, I might point to the\r\nfact that in this great educational exposition, while one vast palace is\r\ngiven up to exhibits of the school, the library has with difficulty\r\nsecured a part of a room in the Missouri State Building for an exhibit\r\nof its activities in the great work of education, in which, as I am\r\ntrying to show, its potentialities are as great as those of the school.\r\nAs our Board of Directors said, in its appeal to the exposition\r\nDirectors for a separate library building:\r\n\r\n    \"The library, besides being the most efficient and most\r\n    economical agency for popular education, represents all the\r\n    fair will have to show. It stands for the sum total of human\r\n    knowledge. It is the instrumentality through which knowledge\r\n    has been conserved and cumulated. Only through the library\r\n    can civilization continue to advance.... Books are the most\r\n    potent factors in progress. Without books we should have had\r\n    no powerful locomotives to show, no wireless telegraphy, no\r\n    wonder-making machinery, no beautiful buildings, no\r\n    impressive statuary, no paintings to arouse wonder and yield\r\n    delight--no World's Fair to draw distinguished scientists\r\n    and educators from all over the world.\"\r\n\r\nBy way of introduction to the comprehensive addresses of the two\r\ndistinguished delegates who have travelled four or five thousand miles\r\nto lay before this Section, and, through publication, before the world,\r\nthe past history and the present problems of the library, it has seemed\r\nto me appropriate that, as chairman, I should present a brief plea for\r\nthe consideration of the library as one of the greatest factors in human\r\nprogress. It has existed, though not in its present form or with its\r\npresent functions, from the dawn of recorded civilization. It is itself\r\nthe record of civilization; and without it there can be no records and\r\nno civilization. It is the repository, the custodian, the preserver of\r\nall the arts and sciences and the principal means of disseminating all\r\nknowledge. With the school and the church it forms the tripod necessary\r\nto the stable equilibrium of society. Let me briefly summarize the\r\nfunctions of the public library.\r\n\r\n1. It doubles the value of the public school instruction, on which is\r\nexpended more than ten times the cost of the library.\r\n\r\n2. It enables the children who leave school at an early age (an\r\noverwhelming majority) to continue their education while earning their\r\nliving. It provides for the education of the adults who have lacked or\r\nfailed to utilize early opportunities. This is of special importance in\r\na country like the United States, where one of the greatest political\r\nproblems is the assimilation of a vast influx of ignorant foreigners of\r\nall races and languages.\r\n\r\n3. It supplies books and periodicals needed for the instruction of\r\nartisans, mechanics, manufacturers, engineers, and all others whose work\r\nrequires technical knowledge[6]--all persons on whom depends the\r\nindustrial progress of the community.\r\n\r\n4. It furnishes information and inspiration to ministers, teachers,\r\njournalists, authors, physicians, legislators--all persons on whose work\r\ndepend the intellectual, moral, sanitary, political and religious\r\nwelfare and advancement of the people.\r\n\r\n5. It is the stimulus and the reliance of the literary and study clubs,\r\nwhich, especially among the women, have done much not only for\r\nindividual self-culture but also for civic enlightenment and social\r\nbetterment. This represents its numerous post-graduate courses, which\r\nare taken by constantly increasing numbers.\r\n\r\n6. It has philosophers and theologians to explain and expound and to\r\nexhort those who are willing to listen; but, far better, it has poets\r\nand dramatists and novelists--who compel a hearing and impress on heart\r\nas well as mind the fundamental truths of morality and religion.\r\n\r\n7. It is also a school of manners, which have been well defined as minor\r\nmorals. The child learns by example and by the silent influence of his\r\nsurroundings; and every visit to a library is a lesson in propriety and\r\nrefinement. The roughest boy or the rudest man cannot fail to be\r\nimpressed by the library atmosphere and by that courtesy which is the\r\nchief element in the \"library spirit.\"\r\n\r\n8. It imparts, as the school cannot, knowledge of one's self, and of\r\none's relations to one's fellow-man, and thus prepares the individual\r\nfor citizenship and fellowship in organized society and leads him to be\r\nan active force in social advancement.\r\n\r\n9. It elevates the standard of general intelligence throughout the\r\ncommunity, on which depends its material prosperity as well as its moral\r\nand political well-being.\r\n\r\n[6] The information furnished by a book in the Cincinnati Public\r\nLibrary once saved that city a quarter of a million dollars. This in\r\nnumerous instances, but on a smaller scale, is a part of the everyday\r\nwork of the library.\r\n\r\n10. But not last, if an exhaustive list were aimed at--nor least it\r\nsupplies a universal and urgent craving of human nature by affording to\r\nall entertainment of the highest and purest character, substituting this\r\nfor the coarse, debasing, demoralizing, amusements which would otherwise\r\nbe sought and found. Further, it brings relief and strength to many a\r\nsuffering body and cheer and solace to many a sorrowing heart. It is\r\ninstruction and inspiration to the young, comfort and consolation to the\r\nold, recreation and companionship to all ages and conditions.\r\n\r\nI close as I began:\r\n\r\nEducation is the greatest concern of mankind; it is the foundation of\r\nall human progress. The library is an essential factor in all grades of\r\neducation; and it is the agent plenipotentiary in the betterment of\r\nsociety and the culture and cheer of the human soul. \"The highest gift\r\nof education is not the mastery of sciences, but noble living, generous\r\ncharacter, the spiritual delight that comes from familiarity with the\r\nloftiest ideals of the human mind, the spiritual power that saves each\r\ngeneration from the intoxication of its own success.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY AS A FACTOR IN MODERN CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\n    Read by President Faunce of Brown University, at the\r\n    Narragansett Pier Conference of the American Library\r\n    Association in 1906. Elaborates the library's three gifts to\r\n    the nation--\"knowledge, perspective and ideals.\"\r\n\r\n    William Herbert Perry Faunce was born in Worcester, Mass.,\r\n    Jan. 15, 1859, graduated at Brown University in 1880,\r\n    entered the Baptist ministry, and after holding several\r\n    pastorates became in 1899 president of his alma mater. He is\r\n    known as an effective writer and speaker, especially on\r\n    religion and education.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have long been accustomed to speak of three great factors in modern\r\ncivilization--the school, the church, and the home. Must we, in view of\r\nsuch a significant meeting as this, add a fourth factor--the library?\r\nThe modern library has in some places become a true school; in other\r\nplaces it has radiated something of the refinement for which we once\r\nlooked to the home, and something of the idealism which is a peculiar\r\ngift of the church. The library is vastly more than a collection of\r\nbooks: it is a social, civilizing, moralizing force. We expect to find\r\nthe library building in every city and town as much as to find the spire\r\nof the church or the flag of the schoolhouse. The visitor to Boston\r\nto-day finds the public library as commanding a pile as Trinity Church,\r\nand far more imposing than any schoolhouse. The visitor to New York\r\nfinds the new public library building climbing into a mass and dignity\r\nas great as that of any cathedral. No smallest village is now complete\r\nwithout its library, and when some future Goldsmith shall sing the\r\npraise of another \"Deserted village,\" he will point out not only with\r\nthe \"noisy mansion\" of the school-master, not only the church adorned\r\nwith the meek and unaffected grace of the rural pastor, but the loaded\r\nshelves, the catalogs and reference lists, the chairs and tables, and\r\nthe zeal unaffected, though not always meek, of the modern librarian.\r\n\r\nThese libraries have sprung into being throughout the land without\r\nspecific legislation and without deliberate propaganda. The church\r\nmissionary societies of the country have adopted the avowed policy of\r\nplanting a church in every community, and appointing superintendents of\r\nmissions to see that this is done. Every state in the Union has its laws\r\nfor the establishment and maintenance of schools. But these multiplying\r\nlibraries have come into being without enactment of law or the preaching\r\nof the crusade. They have spread from sea to sea by a happy contagion,\r\nthey have become a noble American epidemic. The great inarticulate\r\nthirst for knowledge has demanded satisfaction, and created its own\r\nsupply. Our wisest directors of public sentiment and philanthropic\r\nendeavor have realized that through the library may come a charity that\r\ndoes not pauperize, a help that induces self-help, light to irradiate\r\nthe dark places of civilization, inspiration for every calling, and\r\naccess and power to every worthy institution and noble cause. What then\r\nis the specific function of this new and powerful institution in modern\r\nlife? What is the contribution of the library to modern civilization?\r\n\r\nThe library makes to the nation three gifts: the gift of knowledge, the\r\ngift of perspective, the gift of ideals. Putting the matter in another\r\nway, we may say it gives us facts, relations, values.\r\n\r\nThe library is primarily to conserve and disseminate knowledge. Indeed,\r\nthe old conception of the library was purely that of a place of storage\r\nfor written or printed material. No one thought of taking out a book\r\nfrom a mediaeval library any more than of removing a statue or painting\r\nfrom an art gallery. And still to-day the function of the library as a\r\nstorehouse is most important. Modern democracy holds that knowledge is\r\nnot for a few bright minds of each generation, not for an intellectual\r\nelite; but all that is knowable is to be made accessible to all that\r\ndesire to know. If we allow knowledge to come only to a chosen few of\r\neach generation, how can we know that we have chosen the right ones to\r\nreceive it? The genius that might turn the stream of history may be born\r\nin the lowliest cabin on the prairie, or in the darkest tenement of the\r\ngreat city. There may not be a village Hampden in every village, but\r\nthere may be an Edison, a Fulton, an Eli Whitney, an Andrew Carnegie, a\r\nCarl Schurz in any village in America. Only when we make knowledge\r\naccessible to all shall we know what minds and hearts are among us.\r\n\r\nBut we must discriminate. The books which no longer convey knowledge,\r\nwhich state theories no longer held, and propound as facts things no\r\nlonger believed; in other words, antiquated books of knowledge should be\r\nsharply separated from books abreast of modern thinking. Those books\r\nwhich have ceased to be of any use to mankind (except for antiquarian\r\npurposes) or which never were of any use to mankind--and their name is\r\nlegion--have their place in a museum, but not in an working library. In\r\nan arsenal we keep only weapons now serviceable in actual war, and\r\nrelegate flint-locks, catapults, and bows and arrows to the museum. No\r\narsenal in the world would be large enough to accommodate weapons for a\r\nmodern regiment mingled with all the weapons of all past generations. It\r\nis time for some one to say frankly that there is no inherent sanctity\r\nin paper and printer's ink. It may have been true in Milton's day that a\r\nbook was usually the precious life-blood of a master spirit; but to-day\r\na book is often the product of the least erected spirit that fell. An\r\nalmanac put forth to advertise some nostrum, or a novel prepared purely\r\nas a piece of merchandise, does not acquire dignity or value simply\r\nbecause bound in leather and placed on the shelf with \"Paradise Lost.\"\r\n\r\nWe must apply to our libraries some higher standard than that of size.\r\nWe never estimate the Uffizzi or the Louvre by the number of paintings\r\nthey contain, yet we continue to grade modern libraries by the number of\r\nvolumes groaning on dust-covered shelves. A library of five thousand\r\nwell selected books may be of far more service than one of one hundred\r\nthousand composed largely of books outgrown and forgotten. Our public\r\nlibraries must distinguish sharply between the library and the museum,\r\nto the advantage of both.\r\n\r\nSecondly: Perspective. The library aims to show us facts in their large\r\nand permanent relations. There is no virtue in mere knowledge of facts\r\n(any more than in vast numbers of volumes). Most facts are not worth\r\nknowing, still less worth preserving. Doubtless the letter \"p\" occurs a\r\ncertain definite number of times in \"Idylls of the King,\" and it may be\r\nthat some deluded mortal in prison or asylum has ascertained that\r\nnumber; but we do not care to know that fact or have any one else know\r\nit. The exact number of grains in some ant-hill is doubtless\r\ndiscoverable, but only a lunatic would care for the discovery. Most\r\nfacts in nature and in history are in our present stage of development\r\nwithout value. Only when these facts are collected, classified, seen in\r\nrelation, and translated into truth do they become of value to men.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the library must encourage, slow, patient, thoughtful\r\nreading. We have long been told that a taste for reading is worth ten\r\nthousand a year. Whether this is true or not depends altogether on what\r\nsort of reading is referred to. The habit of letting the mind lie\r\npassive while some scribbler plays upon it is not worth ten thousand a\r\nyear. The habit of letting the mind become a waste basket for sensation\r\nand scandal is not worth ten thousand a year. The habit of reading as a\r\nsubstitute for thinking is worth nothing, but is sheer damage to mental\r\nfibre. The university library is even more important than the university\r\nlaboratory. In the laboratory we verify the theory which is far more\r\nlikely to be discovered in the library. The new discovery is a new\r\ncombination of old ideas, and such mental combination comes to us more\r\neasily when we are dealing with thoughts than with things.\r\n\r\nOur students need to use books not only as tools, but as friends. In the\r\nold days, when the reading of college students was far more promiscuous\r\nthan to-day, they were accustomed to regard books almost as personal\r\nacquaintances, and there was a genuine exchange of reaction of writer\r\nand reader. Such reading was indeed very desultory, but, as our\r\nprofessor of English literature is accustomed to say, \"it was immensely\r\nfattening.\" Now, on the other hand, the college student goes to the\r\nlibrary with a list of references, using many books, but becoming really\r\nacquainted with none. He opens one work at volume 2, page 193, another\r\nat volume 4, page 315, and, having extracted the precise bit of\r\ninformation he desires, has no further use for the author in question.\r\nThis modern method of reading is far more accurate and definite than the\r\nolder method, and is obviously effective in securing results. But it\r\nmust be supplemented by the \"browsing\" of former days, by the large\r\nhorizons which come from being set free in the companionship of great\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nThirdly: Ideals. Our libraries must not be only storehouses of\r\nknowledge, but reservoirs of power. The great books of all time give us\r\ncontact with inspiring personalities, shining examples, with the great\r\nleaders of men. The trophies of Themistocles will not suffer us to\r\nsleep. When such books come into many a shut-in life, to many a boyhood,\r\ncabined and confined, the limitations of the farm and factory are\r\nforgotten, the mind expands to a kinship with past and future, and the\r\nreader in some village library may become the prophet of the new\r\ncentury, and the leader of the modern world.\r\n\r\nMore than that: the literature of power creates the climate in which we\r\nlive. It shapes our ideals of success, of power, of beauty, of goodness.\r\nFiction and poetry, if they thus create aspiration and give us\r\nstandards, may be more useful than all encyclopedias or text-books, for\r\nthey deal with the sources and the goal of all human action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROVISION OF BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\n    The seven addresses or papers just preceding relate to the\r\n    general services of the library to the community. The twelve\r\n    that now follow analyze this into four types of special\r\n    service, as already suggested--the provision of books, the\r\n    collection of information, the control and guidance of\r\n    reading and community-centre service. The next three papers\r\n    treat of the provision of books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARIAN AND HIS CONSTITUENTS\r\n\r\n    That the choice of books is the most important of the\r\n    librarian's duties and that \"his best effort\" should be\r\n    given to it, is the thought of an institutional librarian,\r\n    R.B. Poole of the New York Y.M.C.A. This view should\r\n    interest those who think that administrative problems and\r\n    socialization are elbowing the books into the background.\r\n\r\n    Reuben Brooks Poole was born in Rockport, Mass., in 1834,\r\n    and graduated at Brown University in 1857. After serving as\r\n    a teacher he became librarian of the Y.M.C.A. library in New\r\n    York City, where he remained until his death on April 6,\r\n    1895. He was president of his state library association in\r\n    1894.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy constituents is not meant political constituents. It is unfortunate\r\nfor any librarian when he holds his office in a public library as a\r\npolitical favor, and library appointments should be as far removed as\r\npossible from all party influences. A public library, like any other\r\npublic property, is susceptible of being used as a tool, and may easily\r\ndegenerate into a political job, unless specially protected by its\r\ncharter. New York city has one such library. The library exists for the\r\nlibrarians; its constituents--not readers--are of the school of\r\npolitics. The example, it is to be hoped, is a unique one in our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nA brief retrospect of the libraries and librarians of the past may help\r\nus to more fully comprehend the situation of the librarian and his\r\nconstituents of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe monk represented the librarian of the Middle Ages. He was not by\r\nprofession a librarian, and yet the valuable service he rendered to\r\nliterature entitles him to the name. He was at once chorister, master of\r\nceremonies, transcriber, illuminator, and collector. Professedly the\r\nmonk was a religious ascetic. He retired from the world to devote\r\nhimself to religion, to a life of self-denial. His language was the\r\nLatin; the books or manuscripts that surrounded him were works of the\r\nFathers, books of devotion, service-books, and the classics. These were\r\njust in keeping with his life and thoughts. A congenial occupation was\r\nthus opened to him. The hours of the cloister were made shorter as the\r\nmonk duplicated and reduplicated some dainty missal, or some commentary\r\nof Augustine, or painted a miniature of the Virgin or of the apostles.\r\n\r\nHowever much we may differ in opinion as to the service rendered to\r\nreligion by the monasteries of the Middle Ages, as librarians we have a\r\nfellow-feeling with these toiling monks, and are grateful to them for\r\nthe service they have rendered the libraries of to-day by their\r\npreservation of works that otherwise would have been destroyed. There is\r\nnothing in the book-making arts of to-day to compare with the artistic\r\nskill displayed in the illuminations and miniature-painting which enrich\r\nand beautify the manuscripts of those times.\r\n\r\nThe monastic libraries were small, and the readers few. Books were\r\nloaned from monastery to monastery. They were distributed once a year,\r\nat the Lenten season. As each borrower returned his book he was\r\ncatechised as to its contents, if the examination was satisfactory he\r\nwas allowed another book for the coming year; if not, he must take his\r\nold book again.\r\n\r\nOne not a member of the order of St. Benedict, or an _attache_ of Cluny\r\nor Canterbury, could procure the coveted treasure, sometimes, by\r\npledging to return with the manuscript borrowed a full transcription.\r\n\r\nLibrary economy in these ages was very simple. Catalogues were little\r\nmore than inventories, and no discordant notes were chanted, in duets or\r\nsolos, over systems of classification. The absolute or fixed system of\r\nshelving was in vogue, the books being held in their places by chains.\r\nThe survival of this feature exists in the attachments of the modern\r\ncity directory.\r\n\r\nBut, not to linger longer in cloisters or abbeys, we come to the age of\r\nprinting and to the foundation of the modern libraries of Europe; the\r\ntreasures in the monastic libraries contributing to form their vast\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nThe monk's occupation as a librarian was gone, and he was succeeded by\r\nthe collector, the keeper, the scholar. In the centuries immediately\r\nsucceeding the invention of printing there was a growing diffusion of\r\nknowledge by means of libraries. We smile at the restrictions imposed,\r\nand look upon them as so many fetters on the intellect. It is, however,\r\nto be borne in mind that at this time books were costly and rare, and on\r\nthis account were guarded with great jealousy.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bodleian library was founded it was stipulated by law that\r\nunder no pretence should any book be lent to any one, no matter what his\r\nstation. A Fellow of Corpus Christi College could not enter the sacred\r\nalcoves alone, and he was under oath not to remove a book. The books\r\nwere there for use, there can be no question; and in the Bodleian, to\r\nwhich we have just referred, a person could have six books at a time to\r\nconsult, and the library was open for six hours during the day.\r\n\r\nAbout 1650 Humphrey Chetham bequeathed L1,000 for a public library in\r\nManchester, England. He was a firm adherent of the fixed location. \"My\r\nmind and will is,\" he says, \"that care be taken that none of said books\r\nbe taken out of the said library at any time, and that the said books be\r\nfixed or chained.\" After specifying certain religious books, and\r\nannotations on the Bible, he adds, \"and other books proper for the\r\ncommon people.\" It was two hundred years after this, in this last half\r\ncentury, before the Public Libraries Act was introduced into the English\r\nParliament; and from this period we may date a new era, both in England\r\nand in this country, in the dissemination of books and improved library\r\nmethods. The last decade, commencing with the formation of the A.L.A.\r\nand the beginning of our second century as a nation, has witnessed\r\nresults hitherto unachieved in library economy. It is not necessary to\r\nenlarge here upon the work that has been accomplished. The important\r\nthing to note is that the librarian of to-day should be _en rapport_\r\nwith all that pertains to his profession. He should acquaint himself\r\nwith schemes of classification, and elect from them that which is best\r\nadapted for the purposes of his own library. He should adopt the best\r\nsystem for charging, acquaint himself with the most approved library\r\nappliances. Whether he adopt the classed catalogue, the dictionary, the\r\nalphabeto-classed, or any other form, let it be one that shall be\r\nabreast of the progress that has been made in this department of library\r\nscience. The librarian can scarcely keep pace with his fellow-librarians\r\nunless he receives the right hand of fellowship of the American Library\r\nAssociation, and is a reader of the _Library journal_ or the _Library\r\nnotes_, just launched and designed to cruise along the coast into the\r\nsmaller ports. The advantages which the librarian receives from these\r\nsources will qualify him better for his profession, but the greater\r\nadvantage will accrue to his readers: knowledge will be made more\r\navailable, and a bright, cheerful atmosphere will pervade the alcoves of\r\nhis store-house.\r\n\r\nThe librarian of to-day is developing to the full the utilitarian\r\nprinciple. He is practical,--practical in his library management,\r\npractical in his choice of books. His constituency is either a\r\nparticular class or the great public. To supply the masses with reading,\r\nand to make books helpful in all the vocations of life, is the\r\nlibrarian's aim. It is just here that we need to emulate our\r\npredecessors, the monks and the collectors and bookworms of the\r\nsixteenth and succeeding centuries.\r\n\r\nHe must have the spirit of the collector, the animus of the scholar. He\r\nmust not forget that he is an antiquarian in his zeal for utility. His\r\nconstituency is not confined to the present; he is building for\r\nposterity as well. His library will live after him. He therefore needs\r\nto be a wise master-builder.\r\n\r\nIf the choice of books is in the librarian's hands, or if he occupies an\r\nimportant position in connection with the selection, his best effort\r\nshould be given to this department. The responsibility is not small. He\r\nwill find it more difficult often to reject than to select. He must\r\nconsult the wants of his readers; but there is a limit to that.\r\nEverything that is in print may be called for, but that is no reason why\r\nit should be honored with a place in a library. The librarian's personal\r\nequation is not to be the standard, but the foundation principles of\r\nmorality, truth, and sound sense must guide him. No quarter should be\r\ngiven to books of doubtful morality. Fiction now finds a place in most\r\nlibraries open to any extent to the public, and this class of books\r\nforms so large a part of the circulation of many libraries that it is\r\nbecoming a question of no small importance as to how far public funds\r\nshould be expended for such books as afford little else than pastime. A\r\npublic library is a public educator. It is not a sluice into which every\r\npublisher may dump his entire wares; as educators, librarians and\r\nmanaging boards have the right to maintain the purity of their\r\ncollections, and to protect them from inundations of worthless books.\r\n\r\nThe librarian should be alert to supply his readers with all they\r\nrequire that will be helpful, as we have said; but, more than this, he\r\nshould lead them. He may do so by procuring works of standard worth, new\r\nand old, that represent the best thought in any department of literature\r\nor science.\r\n\r\nUnless he has something of the spirit of the collector very much will\r\nelude his grasp, and be, perhaps, utterly lost to his library. There are\r\nthe limited editions, now so limited in number; the privately printed\r\nbook; the first numbers of periodicals; the first reports of societies;\r\nlocal histories and genealogies; memorial volumes, and the like,--works\r\nwhose value is enhanced by time.\r\n\r\nA librarian, to be successful, must be a lover of books. The novice, in\r\napplying for a librarianship, often puts it down as one of his cardinal\r\nqualifications that he is fond of reading. To the active, toiling worker\r\nthis is not suggestive of business. A love of books very naturally\r\nsuggests a taste for reading, except when bibliomania is in the blood. A\r\ntrue friend of books is not such because his collection embraces\r\nElzevirs and Aldines, or because they are in Grolier or Bedford\r\nbindings, or printed on Whatman or Holland paper,--these are matters of\r\njust pride,--but because the army of silent authors, marshalled under\r\nhis leadership, will diffuse light and knowledge wherever they go. The\r\nlibrarian imbued with this spirit, if he finds time to read, will\r\nreflect what he has read. It is to be feared that the librarian who\r\nreads in these times is the exception; and yet there can be no question\r\nthat, if he could have each day an hour or two for reading,--time enough\r\nto acquaint himself with the thought of the times, and occasionally\r\ncommune with the authors of the past,--his efficiency would be greatly\r\nenlarged, and his readers would have a supplemental catalogue in him,\r\ncorresponding, to some extent, to the good work contemplated by our\r\nCooperative Committee.\r\n\r\nThere are in every library very many books that are what we might term,\r\nto use a mercantile phrase, dead stock. From the very necessities of the\r\ncase there must be many books that will be called for only at great\r\nintervals, while others never have a friendly consultation. But, aside\r\nfrom these, libraries will often have works of great practical value\r\nthat are standing idle, because it is not generally known that the\r\nlibrary possesses them. There may be a choice lot of works on\r\nelectricity, a rare collection on ceramics, a fine selection of\r\nengravings, representative works in the various industrial arts; the\r\ncall for them not being popular and large, they might be brought to the\r\nnotice of a larger constituency by calling the attention of certain\r\nreaders to them, or by sending a polite invitation to some manufacturing\r\nfirms, to some professional electricians, or to art schools and\r\nscientific schools.\r\n\r\nPeriodicals, before the days of Poole's Index, were sealed books.\r\nLibraries have been wonderfully expanded where this index is used.\r\nFurther cooperation in this direction, as planned by the Cooperative\r\nCommittee, should receive hearty encouragement. The books of a library\r\nmay be further enlarged in their use by publishing, on the library\r\nbulletin, the works in the library that illustrate important events,\r\nafter the admirable plan initiated by Mr. Foster, of Providence.\r\n\r\nIf the librarian has not the time at his command to read he has rare\r\nopportunities for reading character; and to be on good terms with his\r\nvaried constituency he will have to be like St. Paul,--all things to all\r\nmen. He must be polite, accommodating, possess his soul in patience, and\r\nbe unselfish in his devotion to his readers. Generally, his contact with\r\nhis constituency will be pleasant and agreeable, but he will have to\r\ndeal with certain typical characters that will vex and fret him.\r\n\r\nThere is the rummager, who snarls at all catalogues, and wants the\r\nfreedom of the library, not for studious research, but to gratify his\r\nbookish propensity. \"Five minutes with authors\" is his watchword.\r\n\r\nThe crank, who has been defined as a person with an idea, without brains\r\nto carry it out, is a frequenter of libraries. His inquiries are for\r\nwhat the library does not possess. This affords him a text for lecturing\r\nthe librarian and the managers. If the librarian's sentiments are not in\r\naccord with that idea of his he threatens to expose him in the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity-hunter is another representative reader. He is brother to\r\nthe rummager, but he does not despise catalogues. They exhibit the\r\noddities of the library, at least the odd titles, such as Luther's\r\n\"Vagabonds and Beggars,\" \"The Foundling Hospital for Wit,\" or \"The\r\nHistory of the Tread-mill.\" He passes quickly from one to the other,\r\ngleaning here and there till curiosity is satiated.\r\n\r\nAnother reader helps the librarian materially in his statistics; if he\r\ncalls for one book he calls for an armful. The subject he is\r\ninvestigating may require all the light the library can focus upon it;\r\nbut he disposes of his armful so quickly that the query is, by what\r\nalchemy knowledge is appropriated so rapidly. It must be put to the\r\ncredit of this age.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent tramp is another _habitue_ of libraries. He is sometimes\r\na desultory reader, sometimes he is a specialist, and he investigates\r\nwith a profound air the most difficult problems; but that is as far as\r\nhe goes. He is constitutionally lazy. He has some love for literature\r\nand science, but a far more appreciative love of leisure. He does\r\nnothing, produces nothing.\r\n\r\nThen there are walking encyclopaedias. You cannot name any author or work\r\nthat they have not an acquaintance with. They can talk glibly on any\r\nsubject; they absorb like sponges, but they give out nothing. They have\r\na passion for reading; but they either do not, or will not, make their\r\nknowledge available to others. The colored man who not long since\r\napplied to me for something on the toothache, as he was to deliver a\r\nlecture upon this interesting topic, was not of this non-productive\r\nclass. If his monograph has been published it will be a good book for\r\nclose classification.\r\n\r\nThe librarian who feels the obligations of his position realizes that\r\nhis influence as an educator is far-reaching, telling effectively upon\r\nthe community in which he lives, and destined to extend far down the\r\nyears to come. It becomes him, therefore, to fully equip himself for his\r\nwork, and to give to his constituents the results of his ripest\r\nexperience and his most unselfish attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USEFULNESS OF LIBRARIES IN SMALL TOWNS\r\n\r\n    A few books in a small town may exert as much influence as\r\n    many books in a large one; and the personal influence of\r\n    their custodian and administrator may count for more. An\r\n    early statement placing emphasis on this fact by Miss West\r\n    of the Milwaukee Public Library (now Mrs. Henry L.\r\n    Elmendorf) appears in the subjoined paper read at the\r\n    Buffalo Conference of the American Library Association in\r\n    1883.\r\n\r\n    Theresa West Elmendorf, who as the writer of this paper was\r\n    Theresa Hubbell West, was born at Pardieville, Wis., Nov. 1,\r\n    1855, educated in Milwaukee and served on the staff of the\r\n    public library of that city, being deputy librarian in\r\n    1880-92 and librarian in 1892-96. In that year she married\r\n    Henry L. Elmendorf, then librarian of the Buffalo Public\r\n    Library, and since his death in 1906 she has been\r\n    vice-librarian there. In 1911 she was chosen president of\r\n    the American Library Association--the first woman to hold\r\n    this office.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is still, as in the days when the story of the \"wicked and\r\nslothful servant,\" who contemptuously hid his one talent in a napkin,\r\nwas told, something discouraging in the sight of incomparably greater\r\nopportunities than our own in the hands of another.\r\n\r\nThe librarian of a small town or village may not cherish the envy of\r\nthe man in the parable in his heart, and yet feel a certain depression,\r\na sense that the small things he is striving--perhaps with all his\r\nmight--to accomplish amount to very little, as he listens to plans for\r\nthe construction of a building which will commodiously and conveniently\r\nhouse two millions of books; as he ponders over a printed scheme which\r\nwill intelligently order upon the shelves a hundred thousand volumes,\r\nand is yet so flexible, so elastic, that this number may be indefinitely\r\nincreased with no confusion, no necessity for rearrangement; as he sees\r\na method of charging which has been slowly evolved to meet the\r\never-varying, ever-increasing needs of a circulation whose daily issues\r\nare counted by thousands.\r\n\r\nPossibly this feeling has something to do with the small representation\r\nin this Association of the hundreds of lesser libraries which are\r\nscattered through the land. Whether it has, or not, the fact of this\r\nmeagre representation remains, and remains to be regretted. That such a\r\nstate of things is to be deprecated by the society goes without saying.\r\nEvery new member, in one way or another, brings an added power and\r\ninfluence, which is by no means always to be measured by the size of the\r\nlibrary which he represents, or the active part he bears in the\r\ndeliberations. He may even be utterly silent, and yet an actual force;\r\nfor no speaker fails to feel the inspiration which radiates from an\r\nattentive and enthusiastic listener. In ordinary society the\r\naccomplishment of being \"a good listener\" is one of the most enduring of\r\ncharms. It does not lose its power among librarians. The prosperity of a\r\npaper as truly as a jest's \"lies in the ear of him that hears it, never\r\nin the tongue of him that makes it.\"\r\n\r\nTo ask these unattached librarians, if perhaps an echo may reach them,\r\nto consider whether their isolation from their profession is not only a\r\ndeprivation to themselves which they can illy afford, but a retarding of\r\nthe progress of the true library spirit as well, and to suggest a\r\nthought which may possibly prove a stimulus to counteract the\r\ndiscouragement and depression before spoken of, is all that I have even\r\nhoped to accomplish in the few words which have, somewhat too\r\nambitiously, been called a paper on \"The usefulness of libraries in\r\nsmall towns.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the interest and profit of these meetings to the lesser\r\nlibraries, I have heard it asserted, and it is, I think, true, that the\r\npapers and discussions were almost exclusively directed to the\r\nconsideration of the aims, methods, and needs of great libraries. If the\r\nfact needs explanation, or justification, an ample one is found in the\r\nregister of the names of the composing members, with their positions.\r\nThat there would be a ready and cordial response to any general call for\r\nthe discussion of topics specially pertinent to small libraries is not\r\nto be doubted. Over the editorial columns of one of our most-used\r\nperiodicals runs the legend, \"Every man is a debtor to his profession.\"\r\nIt was a most wise choice of mottoes by our friend, the editor and\r\npublisher, for in no profession is it more true than in our own. The\r\nconstant missionary work which Boston and Chicago, and indeed every\r\nlibrary of any repute in the country, has done and is doing, is proof\r\nenough that the obligation is appreciated. If the smaller libraries want\r\nthe discussion of simpler, less technical methods, they have, probably,\r\nbut to ask.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that the great obviously includes the small, and\r\nthat plans and methods which are good and suitable for the former need\r\nbut to be reproduced in miniature for the latter. It is true, that, in\r\nmany departments, the accident of size makes little or no difference in\r\nlibrary economy; but in the administration of affairs, in the machinery\r\nof running, the director of a municipal library has many and\r\naccumulating cares, of which his less burdened rural brother need never\r\nfeel the weight. Prof. John Fiske, some years ago, at the time when he\r\nwas assistant librarian of Harvard University, very graphically\r\ndescribed a portion of the perplexing duties which fall to the lot of\r\neven a university librarian, striving to correct the erroneous but too\r\nprevalent notion that such a position is a sinecure. He confined himself\r\nto an enumeration and description of the duties which are essentially\r\nprofessional, the multiplicity of details of the ordering, classifying,\r\nand cataloging of books. In this direction there is a difference only in\r\namount between the greater and the less. But, in addition to all that\r\nProf. Fiske described, a city librarian must needs oversee as well the\r\nthousand and one minutiae which go to make up the sum of a day's work in\r\na circulating library. He must provide for the accurate identification\r\nand registration of his borrowers,--no light task when they number tens\r\nof thousands of the floating population of a western city, which has\r\nmore active duties for her police than the following up of delinquent\r\npatrons of the public library. He must see to it that the thousands of\r\nbooks which flow over his counters are unerringly charged, and that\r\ntardy borrowers are warned of their remissness. These are but a few of\r\nthe numberless details, many of which are trivial in the extreme, but\r\nwhich all go toward the making up of such a day's work as \"none but he\r\nthat feels it knows.\" As a machine increases in complications a\r\nconstantly greater percentage of power is consumed in overcoming\r\nfriction. This attention to the routine of daily work, which forms much\r\nof the severest, because least satisfying, work which a librarian does,\r\nmay be compared to the friction of machinery; and just in the proportion\r\nthat the power of his mind and the strength of his body are taxed in\r\nthis direction, by just so much are they reduced for other duties, the\r\nimportance of which is specially prominent in the minds not only of the\r\nprofession, but of the public as well,--an actual knowledge of the books\r\nwhich the library buys, and the exertion of an active personal influence\r\nin raising the standard of literature which is drawn from the library.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely in this line of personal influence that there seem to me\r\nto be special encouragements to the librarians of small towns, that\r\nhere, notwithstanding their limited resources, they have peculiar\r\nopportunities for attaining an almost ideal standard of excellence in\r\nthe quality of their work.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust to say that a city librarian actually works harder\r\nthan his country brother. The duties of the former are mainly those of\r\nguiding, overseeing, and correcting the work of others. The latter, with\r\nhis own hands and brain, does most of the work himself. It is as if the\r\none were architect solely, and the other not only architect, but mason\r\nand carpenter as well. One of the severest trials of the lot of a city\r\nlibrarian, in the West at least, is that he must work through many\r\nassistants who are not only utterly lacking in any real love or\r\nenthusiasm for their work, but who are many times illy-educated as well.\r\nThe remedy for this state of affairs is not likely to be found until our\r\nboards of trustees take for their careful consideration the reply of a\r\ncertain irate domestic to her remonstrating mistress: \"You can't expect\r\na good cook and all the Christian virtues for two dollars a week!\" If\r\nthe necessities of the work do not require the employment of more than\r\none, two, or, at most, three assistants, the subtle electric current of\r\nthe librarian's own enthusiasm may suffer the subdivision without being\r\nutterly dissipated. He can actually do much of the work himself. He\r\ncomes into contact with his clientage, which is not so large but that he\r\nmay hope to become personally acquainted with many of them, and,\r\nlearning their tastes and needs, easily become their trusted friend and\r\nguide. His catalog, too, is his own work, and it is perhaps safe to say\r\nthat no one ever properly appreciates a catalog but its maker. Certainly\r\nno one else ever handles it with equal ease and intelligence.\r\n\r\nI am afraid the catalog has never been made, and never will be, over\r\nwhich the ignorant and indolent will not be perplexed and deceived; and,\r\nafter all is said, it is to the ignorant to whom the gospel of the\r\npublic library is specially sent. If the cataloger himself is constantly\r\nat hand to explain intricacies, to supplement deficiencies, with his own\r\nperfect knowledge of his library, to answer even foolish and stumbling\r\nquestioners patiently and intelligently, he may make the puzzling way of\r\nfinding and getting a book so plain that \"The wayfaring man, though a\r\nfool, need not err therein.\"\r\n\r\nThat this personal influence, when exerted, bears fruit, and that right\r\nsoon, has been proved again and again. The following is from the last\r\nreport of one of the largest libraries in the country: \"The increasing\r\npublic interest in the more scholarly books of the Library, and the\r\nlarge accession of visitors to the reference tables, are to be\r\nattributed partly to the Saturday-morning classes which have been\r\nconducted at the Library for the past four months.\" If such work makes\r\nso immediate and appreciable an impression upon a circulation which is\r\nnumbered by hundreds of thousands, is there not a hopeful outlook,\r\nindeed, for small workers?\r\n\r\nOne has said that \"A library is, after all, very much what its\r\nlibrarian makes it.\" There are too many conflicting individualities at\r\nwork in a municipal library to make this, to any considerable extent,\r\ntrue; but in a small town or village the personal equation of the\r\nlibrarian may easily become the exponent of the power of the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE DEDICATION OF THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF\r\nPENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n    Dr. Talcott Williams, the orator of this occasion, Feb. 7,\r\n    1891, was at that time a journalist in Philadelphia. He has\r\n    always been a welcome writer and speaker on literary themes.\r\n\r\n    Talcott Williams was born in Abeih, Turkey, July 20, 1849,\r\n    the son of an American missionary. He graduated at Amherst\r\n    in 1873 and in that year entered journalism, becoming later\r\n    an editorial writer on several large dailies until 1912 when\r\n    he was made director of the School of Journalism of Columbia\r\n    University, New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first and for the last time, the voices of men are heard in\r\nthis place, dedicated to the more eloquent silence of books. Nowhere is\r\nman more and men less than in the library. In the presence of books\r\nindividual learning pales. The scholar dies; the library lives. Yet only\r\nin part. In this bookish age, we fondly impute immortality to books.\r\nNothing could be more false. Few books have the power of an endless\r\nlife. Against these books of power stand a great multitude of books of\r\nuse, which perish with the using. The vast mass of books, like the\r\nthoughts in our daily lives, sink into the background of the\r\nrecollection of the race and furnish the soil from which fresh growths\r\nspring. Few there are who have written books of power. Not a score in\r\nall. Poets for the most part. High priests forever after the order of\r\nhumanity, whose flaming message burns from age to age in the great tree\r\nof human existence, consuming and unconsumed. These books of power which\r\nlive that humanity may not die, and books of use that die that others\r\nmay live, divide literature between them. They constitute the warp and\r\nwoof out of which the university weaves the higher education. In its\r\nlast analysis a liberal training is the mastery of books of use and a\r\nglad yielding to the mastery of books of power.\r\n\r\nControversy over the classics, wrangling over Greek, vain jangling over\r\nrequired and elective courses--these are details. Direct contact between\r\nthe growing minds of each generation and the great minds of the\r\nrace--this is essential. We smile at the space given Confucius in\r\nChinese education; the Koran in Mohammedan schools; but this is only a\r\nperversion of the sound instinct which everywhere puts the young to\r\nschool to the teachers of the race. Unless your education does this, it\r\nstands where the electric telegraph did before its wires were\r\ngrounded--its batteries and instruments, its poles and wires useless\r\nuntil they were in direct contact with the elemental source of electric\r\nenergy in the earth itself. So-called and mis-called practical systems\r\nof education, _realschulen_, which omit these eternal realities of the\r\nrace, find when they have stuffed their pupils with the facts of the day\r\nthat they are still insulated from the thinkers of all time. Fortunately\r\nfor us and for our education, these books of power exist in more than\r\none language and are accessible through more than one channel of\r\nlearning. Thanks to the matchless translation of the Bible, one\r\nincomparable group of books of power is taught in every Sunday-school,\r\nthough I doubt if this will be held sufficient reason for neglecting\r\ntheir study in every university. Greek holds another group. But it is\r\nthe pitiful pedant's plea to urge their study because Greek is\r\ndifficult. It is not because Greek is Greek, but because Homer is Homer\r\nthat Chapman \"spake out loud and bold\" of the solitary text-book which\r\nhas held its own for 2500 years, and links, as may it forever link, this\r\nuniversity with the school of Athens.\r\n\r\n    \"Yet still your Homer, living, lasting, reigning,\r\n    And proves how truth builds in poets feigning.\"\r\n\r\nIt is because these books of power hold the truth that makes men free,\r\nworking thoughts that perish never, that they live when the tongues in\r\nwhich they speak are dead. Books of power which transmit the spiritual\r\nlife of the race keep the self-same spirit through all the\r\ntransmigrations of speech. The scriptures of the race, no less than the\r\nscriptures of religion, enjoy a pentecostal gift of tongues, and are\r\nheard by every man in his own language. Where such books are few in\r\nnumber, which a shelf or two will hold, there is a liberal education,\r\nand no elective course which permits their exclusion offers intellectual\r\nsalvation. Some such books every race has found in its own literature as\r\nit reached the full stature of universal humanity, as our own\r\nEnglish-speaking race, well-nigh within this generation, has discovered\r\nin adding Shakespeare to our general schooling. By the production of\r\nsuch books of power nations are justly measured. This is the wisdom\r\nwhich keepeth a city from destruction. The ship of state, however\r\nweighted with worldly wealth, moves a trackless keel through the waters\r\nof history unless some poet wings its course with \"the proud, full sail\r\nof his great verse.\" We have all heard to-day from one whose lifelong\r\ndevotion has raised him to the foremost rank of scholarship.\r\n\r\n    \"Weave a circle around him thrice\r\n      And close your eyes with holy dread,\r\n      For he on honey-dew hath fed\r\n    And drunk the milk of Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nThe study of such books is possible without any aid or apparatus\r\nwhatever; so near is the diviner of letters to every one of us. But the\r\nfirst office which the library discharges in a university is in\r\nproviding the limitless and manifold interpretation which the ages have\r\nbuilded about these great books of power. Better than all other books as\r\nare the books of power when read without study, they are infinitely\r\nbettered by all study. The literature of interpretation is only second\r\nin value to the literature of inspiration. The study even of books of\r\npower tends to become scholastic, narrow, provincial, letterwise, and\r\nspiritually dead, unless it is quickened and corrected by the fruits of\r\nthe entire field of critical science. For lack of this more than one\r\nsacred book has met a fate which makes one feel, as well kill a book as\r\ngive it a good name. Even in the teaching of books of power--which of\r\nall teaching needs but a soul and the book to awake eternity--the\r\nscholar is saved from himself by the library. He learns that with all\r\nthe inspired prophets of the race no scripture is of private\r\ninterpretation, that only time unlocks the weaving of these deeper\r\noracles of humanity, because they spake not of themselves, but for the\r\nspirit of man. Nor need we fear that they will be smothered by their\r\ninterpretation. The mountains bear easily the weight of forests they\r\nuprear, and at the last and highest, no tree ascends above the snow-line\r\nof eternal thought.\r\n\r\nBut such ascents are as little the normal work of the university as of\r\nthe road-builder. Its course lies chiefly along the broad highways of\r\nlearning. Not books of power, but books of use, which sum first general,\r\nand then special and professional knowledge, occupy the greater portion\r\nof its time, just as the most saintly of mortals devotes more of his\r\ndays to earning his living than to saving his soul. If the study of\r\nbooks of power is rendered more valuable by a library, the adequate\r\nteaching of books of use without one is impossible. Every text-book is a\r\ncompromise between what is known and what can be taught. Two classes, I\r\nknow, the publishers and the public, cherish the belief that there are\r\ntext-books which sum current knowledge on this subject and that; but\r\nthere are none. Every text-book is out of date the day after it goes to\r\nthe printer, and the day before it gave out, not what is known, but the\r\nview of what is known then in vogue. It measures the advancing tides of\r\nlearning by a gauge itself incessantly changing. We love to speak of\r\nauthorities and standards. We delude ourselves. The whole field of\r\nletters and of learning is in a perpetual flux, whose only complete\r\nrecord is the library. We know that in science discovery succeeds\r\ndiscovery. There is nothing certain about a scientific book except that\r\nit will be wrong in five or ten years. Only now and then does some\r\nlaw-giver in science, some Newton or Darwin, descend the mount of\r\ndiscovery, bearing eternal and lasting laws of nature, writ by Nature's\r\nGod. But in literature we dream of permanent reputation. Here, too,\r\n\"Every century gives the last the lie.\" All the lesser priests of\r\nletters stand at shrines like that of Nemi and the Golden Bough,\r\n\r\n    \"Beneath Aricia's trees,\r\n      Where the ghastly priest doeth reign,\r\n      The priest who slew the slayer\r\n    And shall himself be slain,\"\r\n\r\nEvery new book enters the arena about to die. The friendly verdict but\r\ndeters fate; it does not avert it. The lesser criticism of letters must\r\nbe done anew for every crop of readers, and in fifteen or twenty years\r\nmost essays are left behind. The procession of novels passes almost as\r\nrapidly. Few are read for thirty years, no English novels have held a\r\npopular place for past half a century, and a decade before the centenary\r\nof Waverly it begins to be whispered that Scott is no longer read by the\r\nyoung. Every generation must have its own translations of the classics,\r\nor reprints of those which have been forgotten. Morals, philosophy, and\r\nreligion must be rewritten for it. Even histories, which linger a little\r\nlonger on the stage than all the rest, yield to inexorable change. It is\r\nbarely a century since Gibbon launched his mighty fleet, freighted with\r\nthe fall of empire. It has long ridden the seas, but I think we are all\r\nwell aware that its masts are already low on the horizon. No one author,\r\nno one work, can longer satisfy the world for the story of ten centuries\r\nof the race. For most of us these changes do not exist. Unconsciously we\r\ngo on down the stream with the favorites of our youth and forget that\r\nboth are growing old together. If literature is to be taught as it is,\r\nand not as it seems, to take one pregnant illustration, true of all\r\nstudies, teacher and taught must have instant and vital access to that\r\ngreat body of books to which in every subject a text-book is but a rude\r\nand makeshift guide. The present can only be understood by the past, and\r\nboth are needed to prophesy of the future. When this library has been\r\nenlarged to the utmost bounds of our anticipation, it will still have\r\nits limits to the specialists--joints in its armor of learning. Even at\r\nthe British Museum I was told and discovered that no man is long at work\r\nwithout wanting some book with which it is unprovided.\r\n\r\nBut if teaching requires this great array, much more does the wider\r\nwork of the college professor. To look upon him as set only to teach, to\r\nhear recitations, is as narrow and barren a view of his work as to think\r\nof the farmer as only occupied in feeding his calves. If a university is\r\nin the highest sense to be a teaching body, it must cultivate knowledge\r\nas well as pupils. Its professors must do more than harvest the learning\r\nand teach the discoveries of other discoverers. They must produce and\r\ndiscover. The spirit of genius bloweth where it listeth, but those books\r\nof use which play their part in giving each generation its critical\r\nstandards, its histories, and the results of research are born only in\r\nfull libraries. If a university is deficient in them, the lack is apt to\r\nbe in that laboratory of learning, its library. Unless a university is\r\nproducing these, it is teaching only its matriculates when it ought to\r\nbe teaching the public.\r\n\r\nMuch may be done, much accomplished, in the university without the\r\nlibrary. Professional schools may multiply and grow, for in these men of\r\nprofessional learning supply the lack of books. It is even possible to\r\ncarry on much research and produce valuable results along any narrow\r\nrising line of discovery in some science, which, like the coral, has but\r\nits growing edge alive, and for the rest is dead and under water. But if\r\na university is to fill the whole round and play part in society, it\r\nmust enjoy, employ, and extend the organized memory of man as\r\nrepresented in a great library. As the chief value of this lies, not in\r\nany view of its mere bulk and size, but in its relation to the\r\nrecollection of the race, so the work of the university pivots on its\r\nability to make vital the study of books of power, without which all\r\nlearning and letters and science are but a vain show. Better, a thousand\r\ntimes better, the solitary study which brings men face to face with the\r\nspirit of man in these great movements than any university study which\r\ndwarfs to routine or degrades to mere rote these great works. For the\r\nobject of all our study is not knowledge, but wisdom, and we move to\r\ndwindling ends if we search out all the secrets of matter and forget the\r\nsecrets of the spirit. The great round of studies which make up the\r\nuniversity, its libraries and laboratories, the accumulation of the past\r\nand the discovery of the future, these are each and all but the\r\nscaffolding by which the race rises to those conceptions of the Divine\r\nand the spiritual uttered and summed in its books of power. Listening to\r\ntheir teaching we may even learn that the ascent of man is more\r\nimportant than his descent, his future of more consequence than his\r\norigin--that it is his birth, and not his death, which is a sleep and a\r\nforgetting.\r\n\r\nBut books of use and books of power--the indiscriminate eulogy of books\r\nand reading has ceased to be possible even at the opening of a building\r\ndedicated to both. Their criticism has begun. Books are no longer the\r\nunique property of the scholar. We all buy books. Most of us read them.\r\nMany of you write them. The use of books is the one side of learning on\r\nwhich we all claim an opinion. Yet owned, read, written, or wholly laid\r\naside in a busy life, the use of books, which each of us knows, is\r\nindividual and personal. Standing to-day in the home of a collection\r\nwhich, we trust, is to be one of the larger libraries of learning,\r\nlandmark, and lighthouse at once, recording the past and lighting the\r\npathless future, this individual and personal use is inevitable before\r\nus, cramping and limiting our conception of the relations, the aims, and\r\nthe ends of a great library. Its very beginnings about us raise a doubt\r\nas to the wisdom of these endless accumulations of print. The peril of\r\nthe mere aggregate was, perhaps, never plainer than in these days, when\r\nthe great glacier of democracy slides on, making high places low and low\r\nhigh--one would be glad to believe, preparing the pathway of a new\r\nlordship of learning, but one is fain to fear making easy the track and\r\nbroad the road for an evil over-lordship of mediocrity in learning and\r\nin literature. Our own democracy we are assured, has ceased to read\r\nanything but fiction, and demands this, not book-meal, but piece-meal,\r\nin monthly, weekly, or even daily doses.\r\n\r\nThe vast book-stack of the modern library, in which volumes lose their\r\nindividuality as completely as urns in a columbarium, and like them but\r\ntoo often hold naught but dead and forgotten dust, is far removed from\r\nthe still air of delightful studies which we associate with our own\r\nloved libraries. \"I seldom go there,\" says Emerson of the University\r\nLibrary he used, \"without renewing my conviction that the best of it all\r\nis already within the four walls of my study at home.\" The ablest of\r\nAmerican editors recently urged in the most brilliant of American\r\nnewspapers that the Library of Congress should be reduced to a sound\r\nworking collection of 50,000 volumes, and the rest of its treasures\r\ndissipated or stored. I have myself heard the suggestion in regard to\r\nthis library, and from one of academic connection, that its future\r\nusefulness would be increased if its future bulk were restricted.\r\nWhether we listen to the philosopher, the editor, or the university\r\ntrustee; whatever fanned and winnowed opinions we apply to the great\r\nthreshing floor on whose round the feet of the ages slowly tread out the\r\nwheat from the chaff in the garnered harvest of human thought, the\r\nremnant will be small--measured by high thought or narrow utility. The\r\nmere mass of our libraries already overtaxes our utmost ability to\r\nclassify, to catalogue, and to administer. As we watch their bulk grow,\r\non whatever side of the great altar of learning we worship, our fears\r\nincrease that these heaped offerings will stifle the sacred fire. This\r\nweighty weapon of letters forged by generations, this mighty armor and\r\npanoply of learning on whose myriad rivets so many hammers have rung,\r\nhas outgrown the individual, and we begin to doubt its ultimate value to\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThus men ever err in their early thought on the new duties and fresh\r\nresponsibilities created for men by associate man. In the field of\r\norganized life the whole is always greater than the sum of its parts.\r\nThe body is more than an aggregate of cells. The soul wiser than all its\r\nfaculties. A nation more puissant than any census of its citizens. Man\r\nmore than men. The secret of this supremacy over the sterile synthesis\r\nof sense, the root and germ mastery over the mere mechanics of life, and\r\nthe bald and barren arithmetic of existence, lies in the capacity to\r\nknow the present and to remember the past--in consciousness, out of\r\nwhich conscience grows, and in memory, Mnemosyne, mother of all the\r\nMuses and parent of all learning. Rightly in all history do we measure\r\nthe value of every human society to Humanity by its power to awake to\r\nits own existence and be aware of its own past. This is the\r\n\r\n      --\"mystery in the soul of state\r\n    Which hath an operation more divine\r\n    Than breath or pen can give expression to--\"\r\n\r\nThis exalts the microscopic municipalities of Greece. This abases the\r\ndumb millions of Asia. Our own articulate millions, deficient in much,\r\nhave done most for the world, not by material development, but by\r\ndemonstrating that 62,000,000 spread over a continent can enjoy a\r\nconsciousness as constant, continuous, and complete as the handful of\r\ncitizens in the market-place of a Greek city, less in population that\r\nthe ward in which we stand, smaller in area than the open spaces about\r\nthis University. This general capacity to think as one and remember as a\r\nwhole differences modern societies from all the past, save that of\r\nGreece. This has brought the awakening of nations in this century, a\r\nmightier resurrection with power than the awakening of men in the\r\nsixteenth century. With the future awakening of man the work will be\r\ncomplete. Until it is, national consciousness and national memory,\r\ncreating conscious national life, are the determining conditions of\r\nhuman progress. The problem which Greece solved by making its\r\ncommunities small, the modern world triumphantly meets by making them\r\nlarge and live. It secures this through the newspaper, the print of the\r\npresent, which sets at one in consciousness vast masses of men which are\r\nset apart in space. For generations separated in time, the library, the\r\nprint of the past, preserves for society the sacred oracles of memory.\r\nMisunderstood, misappreciated, placed in opposition, treated as\r\nantagonists, the editor assuring us that the newspaper has superseded\r\nthe printed book, the librarian hesitating to cumber his shelves with\r\nthe fugitive issues of the newspaper, these twin and vital organs in\r\nsociety still supplement and correlate each other.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper is the library of the moment, the library is the newspaper\r\nof all time. We open a newspaper to learn what we are as a nation. We\r\nenter a library to learn what we were. The revelations of neither are\r\naltogether satisfactory. We object to the library because it does not\r\ntell enough of the past. Too often we object to the newspaper because it\r\ntells too much of the present. The faults and shortcomings of the past,\r\nhowever plainly told, rouse no unpleasant sense of responsibility. In\r\nour own individual experience we have each of us had our private and\r\npersonal quarrel with consciousness and memory for setting in too clear\r\na light the sins and duties, the lacks and demands of the past and\r\npassing day. The revelation is no pleasanter when consciousness, memory\r\nand responsibility are social and national. Yet it is only by accepting\r\nboth a complete social consciousness and a complete social memory that a\r\nsociety can be created whose ultimate end is the highest development of\r\neach of its individuals, whose service is the highest duty of all its\r\nmembers. Lavish margin of error in the newspaper too often leads us by\r\nsome slain truth to ask with the soldier at Philippi:\r\n\r\n      \"Messenger of error--\r\n    Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men\r\n    The things they are not?--\"\r\n\r\nBut like Cassius, the truth is self-slain and dies among its friends.\r\nIt still remains true that the newspaper is oftener challenged for\r\ntelling what is unpleasant than for recording what is untrue, and the\r\nrefined and cultured soul, which objects to the newspaper because it\r\nreeks with the ill news of society for whose ills no man can avoid his\r\njust share of responsibility, but imitate the Pharaoh, who slew the\r\nmessengers of evil and sunk in wilful ignorance to an ignoble grave.\r\n\r\nThe nation which lives by the newspaper will lose touch with the past.\r\nThe nation which lives in the library will want knowledge of the\r\npresent. We know all too much as Americans of the peril of thinking by\r\nthe newspapers. German thought has run in the seclusive channel of the\r\nacademic library to the lack and loss of civic consciousness. Germany\r\nwas the last of modern states to act as a people. We were the first, the\r\nbalance and connection between the newspaper and the library, news and\r\nliberal letters, the reporter and the professor, cuts up by the roots\r\nthe frequent conception of the library as a place occult, withheld,\r\nuntrod; shut apart from practical ends, the grant of society to the\r\nscholar--useful to letters, useless to life. This \"idol of the\r\nmarket-place\" falls to pieces confronted by the facts of social\r\nstructure. As well might the brain be held silent, the voice of memory\r\ndumb, the light of consciousness in darkness by the side of the brute\r\nmechanical forces of the body; silence, seclusion, separation from the\r\nactive life of society, these may be for the exchange and the\r\nmarket-place, the railroad and the factory, vast, dumb mechanic\r\nprocesses which perish in producing, but not for the library--not here,\r\nnot here. These walls ring with war. They sound with the conflicts of\r\nthe race. Here, rather than in any arsenal is heard\r\n\r\n      --\"the infinite fierce chorus,\r\n    The cries of agony, the endless groan,\r\n    Which, through the ages that have gone before us,\r\n      In long reverberations reach our own.\"\r\n\r\nThus much for the library in organized society. Long since have we\r\nknown of books as the counsellors and comforters of men. To us all they\r\nhave been teachers, to each of us companions. That great majority,\r\ngreater in wisdom no less than in number, in which by the iron decrees\r\nof fate so many are called and so few are chosen to lasting immortality,\r\nholds all of whom living the world was not worthy, but of whom dead it\r\nslowly seeks to be. Here and here alone in all shapes and forms, we\r\nbuild the sepulchres of the prophets whom our fathers crucified and here\r\ndoubtless our children will build the sepulchres of those who in our day\r\nare despised and afflicted of men for the truth's sake. In joy and in\r\ngrief, in life and in death some book supports, sustains, and soothes\r\neach of us, and in this library the very light has been trained to teach\r\nus at every window and door that we might enter it to pass within the\r\npresence of the mighty dead, to enjoy the companionship of that great\r\ncompany no man can number of wise men made perfect by time.\r\n\r\nBut to the seeing eye and the hearing ear, awake and attentive to all\r\nthat a library is, not for men but for man, not for individuals but for\r\nthe race, a greater than Solomon is here, and a mightier shape fills\r\nthese halls and looks down from these shelves than all the trooped and\r\nillustrious dead. These books, shelf on shelf, these volumes, which fit\r\nsubject by subject into the storied arch of human knowledge, resting one\r\nside on metaphysics and the other on history, the science of mind and\r\nthe science of man, seem existent human memory. The complete library\r\nwould round and fill the record of the race. At best, we have but a\r\nbeggarly fragment. If a single copy of each of the 13,000,000 volumes\r\nwhich dropped from the press in 450 years were by some glad miracle\r\nmultiplying knowledge gathered in one place, human memory would be\r\nunbroken for this short span of its long stay on the globe. Of\r\n13,000,000 but 1,000,000 rest in the largest library on earth in\r\nBloomsbury Square, and not a half are gathered in all known libraries.\r\nBut such as it is, large or small complete or incomplete, a great\r\nlibrary to its capacity gives, as this has begun to do, the only measure\r\nwe have of the recollection of the race. Here we stand face to face not\r\nwith men or nations, race or people, but with man. Blindly our humanity\r\nstill struggles to shape its thought, dumb, inarticulate, unconscious,\r\ntravelling in darkness and laboring in pain, century by century, and\r\ngeneration by generation, in the slow pilgrimage toward the conscious\r\nand consecration before it. The thunder of its power who shall know? Who\r\nshall sound its depths or scale its heights? Who shall know it in all\r\nits compass and sound, measure the confines thereof or prophesy its far\r\nfinal coming? These are all hid in the inscrutable decrees of God from\r\nthe sight of men, but here, here and in places like this there rises\r\nbefore us like an exhalation of the past in these volumes, in this\r\nlibrary, the majestic and visible memory of man.\r\n\r\nRightly here, as in that larger treasure house in London, have we\r\ngathered museum and library under the same roof. These shapeless\r\nfragments worked by the early cunning of savage man, these inscribed\r\nmarbles and sculptured slabs, these tablets and relics of another and a\r\ndistant life, these all, each in its place, play their part in the\r\nrecorded memory of the race. Out of every fragment from every book\r\nshines this Ancient of Days, who before Abraham was and after us shall\r\nbe. Who and what are we, creatures of a day, toilers of an hour, to be\r\nmeasuring by our experience the metes and bounds in the manifestations\r\nof his mighty memory. Rather let our labor be given to render complete\r\nand to transmit unbroken our share in this great heritage by preserving\r\nthe universal printed record of the life about us. The librarian falling\r\nfar short of the honor and amplitude of his office, standing between the\r\nliving past and the slowly dying life of the present, now and then\r\napologizes for saving every empty volume, because none but prescient\r\nomniscience can tell which of 10,000 titles will be demanded by some\r\nsolitary reader a century hence. How petty the plea, how narrow the\r\nargument, how infinitesimal the claims of this distant reader who after\r\nall may never appear! But how simple, how sufficient, how adequate\r\nbecomes the reason for the preservation of every volume when we remember\r\nthat it, too, is a part of this vast image of human memory seated by the\r\nslow river of time, more vocal than that of Memnon, older and younger,\r\nand with every fresh sunburst of genius breaking into fresh song!\r\n\r\nIn high reason has our own Historical Society gathered every volume\r\nwhich fell in this State and city from the press of the last century.\r\nOnly thus can the span of human memory be set forth without a single\r\nforgetful flaw. If the like effort is made here to fill a like\r\nresponsibility for the passing moment to the future, it is possible that\r\nthe Historical Society of another century will not find it necessary to\r\npay $700 for an almanac which might once have been had for a penny, and\r\nyet how grievous the gap in the continuous and social memory of this our\r\ncity if the solitary copy left of Bradford's Almanac, the first product\r\nof our press, had not found a secure resting-place.\r\n\r\nA great library, therefore, does not merely transmit the memory of the\r\npast; it is daily providing memory for the future, safe preserved\r\n\"against the wreckful siege of battering days.\" For the individual no\r\nworse hap can fall than loss of memory. All other powers may remain.\r\nThis lost, all are worthless. Stripped of memory, the soul has no future\r\nand no past, naught save an infructuose now. Nor less, the race. The\r\ndestruction of the Alexandrian Library, whether with Abulfaraj we\r\nattribute it to the intelligent Moslem, or with Gibbon to the ignorant\r\nmonk, was not the loss of so many books and parchments. It was the\r\nparalysis of a great lobe of human memory, fatal lesion had fallen on\r\nthe localized organ of recollection in the brain of humanity. If we had\r\nthe 200 plays of Aeschylus, the 160 of Sophocles, the last books of\r\nLivy, the missing annals of Tacitus, which this library held, the\r\nstature of these writers would not be increased. Like the greater peaks\r\nof every chain they already rise as they recede. It is only the\r\nfoot-hill that needs bulk. These, and lost books like them, would fill\r\nfor us the full measures of classic memory. As library after library\r\nperished and book after book shared the fate of those fathered by\r\nPtolemy, the wreck and loss of human memory went on. The ages that we\r\ncall dark lacked not in men of action. Those ages of faith had their men\r\nof thought matching any before or after. They laid for us the\r\nfoundations of a civil liberty more indestructible than that of Rome.\r\nThe piers of that great arch of law along which our rights daily travel\r\nin safety were built by them. Their architecture and their sculpture\r\nequals any. Their knowledge of the earth, as a whole, was immeasureably\r\nin advance of classic conception. They furnished in Dante one of the two\r\nor three poets for all time, and in the Roman Church they gave the race\r\na creation and conception of whose future it would be a rash man who\r\nventured to say that it was destined to be less than its past, imperial\r\nas its history has been. These ages were dark, not from lack of light\r\nand of leading, but from lack of memory. The ages had lost touch of the\r\nelbow in their march through the dark defile of time. The Renaissance\r\nwas less the revival of human knowledge than the recovery of human\r\nmemory. Age was joined again to age in the unbroken sequence of\r\ncontinuous recollection, and Greece laid her hands to transmit an\r\nApostolic succession of memory on the bowed and studious head of the\r\nmodern world.\r\n\r\nTo play its part in transmitting and preserving human memory this\r\nlibrary is tonight opened and dedicated. Our Library Committee, and you,\r\nsir, its head, who have shown us that whole libraries of comment may be\r\ncondensed into a volume by your magic alembic, providing for criticism a\r\nnew instrument of precision akin to the measurements and the analysis of\r\nthe exact science--you, sir, in the loving care you have given this\r\nbuilding, have not been providing a retreat for scholars; you have built\r\nand fashioned here another refuge and stronghold, fortified\r\n\r\n    \"Against confounding Age's cruel knife\r\n    That he shall never cut from memory.\"\r\n\r\nThe architect of this building has not wrought in mere brick and stone;\r\nhe has added to those shrines and centres of human memory to which its\r\ntreasures gravitate for their security and convenience. This university,\r\nin receiving this building from its Finance Committee, which has raised\r\nits cost, and whose head first suggested its erection, is placed in a\r\nposition where it can discharge not only the first duty of a university,\r\nto which it has always been true, of thinking for the community, but the\r\nsecond, which is like unto it, of remembering for society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\n    One of the functions of the modern library is that of a huge\r\n    cyclopedia, kept continually up to date by the acquisition\r\n    of new material--books, periodicals, prints, pamphlets,\r\n    clippings, publicity matter and manuscripts. It is the\r\n    cyclopedia on cards long advocated by Dr. Dewey, except that\r\n    the cards are in its catalogue and do not contain the\r\n    information directly but serve only as keys to it. In this\r\n    kind of service the library is for the moment getting away\r\n    from books and nearer to the worker, whether at home, in\r\n    school or laboratory, or in commerce and industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARIES AS BUREAUS OF INFORMATION\r\n\r\n    Early material on this ancient function of libraries, so\r\n    widely extended and developed of late, is hard to find. Only\r\n    two papers are given here. The first, by Samuel S. Green, is\r\n    part of an address delivered at the dedication of the Haston\r\n    Free Public Library Building in North Brookfield, Mass.,\r\n    printed in _The Library Journal_ for July, 1896. A sketch of\r\n    Mr. Green appears in Vol. I. of this series.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ideal library is one which invites everybody who has a question to\r\nask, which books contain answers to, to come to the library and put his\r\nquestion, with the assurance that he will be kindly received, his\r\nquestion sympathetically considered, and every effort made to find the\r\nanswer desired.\r\n\r\nI cannot better illustrate what I mean by saying that libraries should\r\nbe bureaus of information than by giving instances of inquiries recently\r\nmade in the library under my charge and explaining how those inquiries\r\nwere met. I will select questions which were answered by sending out of\r\ntown for books, and thus illustrate in addition the fact that libraries\r\nadministered on advanced principles help one another.\r\n\r\nA man came to me not long since and asked by what means he could\r\ndissolve a certain gum which he mentioned. I had the United States\r\nDispensatory brought. The man did not find the answer wished for in that\r\nwork, but did find a reference to a volume of the _Pharmaceutical\r\nJournal_. We did not have a set of that periodical; so I said that I\r\nwould send away to borrow the desired volume. I sent to the librarian of\r\nthe medical library in Boylston place, Boston, for it. He sent it to me\r\nimmediately by express. That volume contained some of the information\r\ndesired by the inquirer, but not all that he wanted. There was another\r\nvolume of the same periodical which he thought would contain the facts\r\nwhich he was in search of. I sent for that, promising to return both\r\nvolumes at once. The second volume was immediately received. That\r\ncontained just what was wanted.\r\n\r\nBy doing work like this a librarian may do much to add to the prosperity\r\nof the industries of a town.\r\n\r\nAnother man came to me to inquire whether we had a catalog of a certain\r\nsouthern society which purported to do hospital work.\r\n\r\nI found that we had no catalog of the society named. It appeared that\r\nthe applicant for information had been asked to contract to do $4000\r\nworth of work for a society of the name mentioned and wished to learn\r\nsomething about its standing. I told him that if I were in his place I\r\nshould write to a gentleman in Washington, whose name I gave him, who\r\nknows all about medical institutions and hospitals throughout the\r\ncountry, to ask him about the society; I offered to write, myself, as\r\nthe applicant felt timid about writing.\r\n\r\nI did write and soon had the answer that the correspondent would advise\r\nthe Worcester man to be very cautious about entering into a contract,\r\nfor he knew nothing about the existence of such a society. I hope that I\r\nhelped to save a Worcester business man from loss on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAgain, a boy who came into Worcester to school called at the library to\r\nask me what I could tell his brother about a school for instruction in\r\ntanning leather in Freiberg, Saxony. Did it receive Americans? what was\r\nthe cost of attending its sessions? what was its curriculum? etc., were\r\nquestions asked.\r\n\r\nI had no pamphlet to give the required information, but suggested that\r\nthe Commissioner of Education at Washington be written to, to find out\r\nwhat information could be found in the library of his office. I found\r\nthat it would be necessary for me to write the letter; so I wrote it.\r\nSoon the answer came giving the information desired and stating the\r\naddress of the school. The answer was passed over to the applicant, with\r\nthe suggestion that if further information were desired he should write\r\nto the officers of the school.\r\n\r\nI remember doing much to start in her studies a resident of Worcester\r\nwho has since become a distinguished Russian scholar, by helping her to\r\nget a Russian-German dictionary from abroad and by borrowing Russian\r\nbooks for her to read from Harvard College Library.\r\n\r\nThree students of the Chinese language have received assistance at my\r\nlibrary, one a missionary at home on leave, the other two students under\r\nthe late Chinese professor of Harvard University, from dictionaries and\r\nother books borrowed for their use.\r\n\r\nI have had occasion to hunt up books in the language of the Exquimaux\r\nfor the use of an investigator in Worcester. I could not find the books\r\nin the libraries of Harvard University or Columbia College, and tried\r\nthe libraries of other centres of learning without success, when I\r\nremembered that Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, the well-known Indian scholar\r\nand historical student, had brought together a fine collection of\r\nphilological works in the Watkinson Library at Hartford, Connecticut.\r\nThe librarian of that library wrote me after a few days, saying that he\r\nhad the books and would send them at once. He apologized for not\r\ndespatching them before, saying that the library did not allow books to\r\nbe taken out. He had waited to consult the president. The president had\r\nsaid that they must set aside the rule if Mr. Green and the library in\r\nWorcester wanted the books, for it was evident that they were needed for\r\nsome important purpose. We got the books and they were used in the\r\npreparation of a learned paper.\r\n\r\nNow, for closing illustrations, let me show you how libraries at great\r\ndistances help one another. I will choose the relations of the library\r\nin Worcester to the Public Library of Denver, Colorado. Mr. Dana, the\r\nlibrarian of that library, sent to me to borrow one of the publications\r\nof the Browning Society of London. It was sent to him by registered mail\r\nand returned, safely, in the same way.\r\n\r\nNext he wanted, for some student of mining, an extract from one of the\r\nvolumes of the _Comptes Rendus_ of the French Academy. The extract was\r\ncopied from the volume and sent to him. There has since occurred the\r\nfollowing transaction. A gentleman in Chicago had written to Mr. Dana,\r\nin Denver, to ask him whether he knew of a translation of the report of\r\na government railroad commission in Holland which had recently been\r\nengaged in considering what kinds of paint are best to use in preserving\r\niron, and whether he could tell him where to find the results of certain\r\nexperiments which had been made in one of the bureaus of the U.S. Navy\r\nDepartment. Mr. Dana passed along the question to me, knowing that I had\r\noften to answer questions of that kind. In order to find an answer to\r\nthe first question, I at once set a young man at work looking at the\r\nindexes of the late volumes of the _Railroad and Engineering Journal_,\r\nand soon an important article was unearthed giving the results of the\r\ninvestigations of the Dutch commission. This piece of information was\r\nsent to Denver. I then wrote to Mr. Henry C. Baird, the Philadelphia\r\npublisher, to see if he knew of the publication of a translation of the\r\nreport. He wrote back that he did not know of the publication of such a\r\ntranslation, but that there was a long article on paints useful in the\r\npreservation of iron in one of the most recently issued volumes of\r\nSpons's \"Receipts.\" He promised, however, to make further inquiries. So\r\nhe went to the rooms of the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences and\r\ninquired there what gentleman in the city was most likely to have the\r\ninformation sought for. He was referred to some one connected with the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Co., who told him that he was not aware that the\r\nreport had been translated, but referred the inquirer to an elaborate\r\narticle extending through several numbers of the well-known periodical,\r\n_Iron_. Mr. Baird transmitted the information he had got to me and I\r\nsent it and other pieces of information gained since my last letter to\r\nthe library of Denver. The information sent to Denver was sent to\r\nChicago. So by the aid of two far separated librarians a person in\r\nChicago, an intermediate city, distant from the homes of both, received\r\ninformation which he desired through Denver, Worcester, and\r\nPhiladelphia. For an answer to his second question, this inquirer from\r\nChicago was referred to the Navy Department at Washington.\r\n\r\nA clergyman in Colorado Springs, and this is a final illustration,\r\napplied to the librarian of the same public Library in Denver for an old\r\nbook by Goldwin Smith. He referred him to me. I knew him, having met him\r\non my way to California. To my surprise I found we did not own the book.\r\nSo I wrote to Mr. Winsor, the Librarian of Harvard University, and told\r\nhim that the applicant could be trusted and would make good use of the\r\ninformation afforded him, and that he needed the book in preparing a\r\ncourse of lectures which he was to give at once at Colorado College in\r\nColorado Springs. Then I asked Mr. Winsor if he felt at liberty to lend\r\nthe book. The next thing I heard in regard to the matter, a letter came\r\nfrom the gentleman in Colorado Springs thanking me for the aid rendered,\r\nand saying that Mr. Winsor had sent the book and that it had reached him\r\njust in time to use in preparing a lecture. The library in the United\r\nStates which was earliest in the field in doing the work of lending to\r\nother libraries systematically and on a large scale, in so far as I\r\nknow, was that of the Surgeon-General's Office in Washington, long\r\nadministered so intelligently and with so keen an eye for usefulness by\r\nDr. John S. Billings.\r\n\r\nNow, how can libraries in towns of the size of North Brookfield become\r\nbureaus of information?\r\n\r\nLet them approach as nearly as they can to the ideal of seeing to it\r\nthat everybody needing information gets it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to let it be understood that a library desires\r\nto have inquirers come to it for information, and that its librarian is\r\nready to take time to find out whether the library contains books which\r\nwill give the information desired.\r\n\r\nIf it does not have the needed books, the librarian tries to think where\r\nthey can be had. Does anybody in town own them? If not, can they be had\r\nfrom a library in a neighboring town?\r\n\r\nIf these resources are not adequate, then let the librarian send to the\r\nnearest large centre to borrow books from the library there to answer\r\nthe questions asked. Worcester would be the natural centre for North\r\nBrookfield to send to.\r\n\r\nIndividuals should not send to Worcester, but the librarian, having\r\nexhausted resources at hand, should send for the books, the library\r\nagreeing, of course, to make good damage and loss and pay the cost of\r\ncarriage. An out-of-town librarian does not know the individual users of\r\na library in a smaller town, but the librarian in that town does know\r\nhis constituency and for whom it is safe to borrow books. Libraries\r\nshould lend to one another, but the work of lending should be\r\nsystematic.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the Free Public Library Commission of Massachusetts, I\r\nwish to say that the commission likes to come into close contact with\r\nthe libraries of the state, and that the smaller libraries may from time\r\nto time find it helpful to put questions to its chairman at the state\r\nhouse in Boston, in person, through a representative, or by letter,\r\nabout library administration.\r\n\r\nPeople are breaking away from their leaders to-day. There is an\r\nimmense amount of crude thought and imperfect information in every\r\ncommunity. I verily believe that not least among the instrumentalities\r\nby which thought may be matured and knowledge completed are public\r\nlibraries when administered as bureaus of information by accomplished\r\nand earnest librarians, who will act as sympathetic friends and advisers\r\nto inquirers and help them to look at all sides of questions and form\r\nwell-grounded judgments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY FRIEND\r\n\r\n    Not all the information required of the Public Library is\r\n    asked by those engaged in laboratory research or by experts\r\n    in commerce and industry. Much of it is homely stuff,\r\n    greatly desired and more or less easy to find. Much of it\r\n    can be given offhand by the capable reference assistant, who\r\n    thereby becomes what the writer of this article calls a\r\n    \"library friend\" to her neighborhood.\r\n\r\n    Miss Winifred Louise Taylor was born in Freeport, Ill., Feb.\r\n    24, 1846. In 1874 she organized the first circulating\r\n    library in Freeport and acted as librarian for twelve years.\r\n    It was eventually incorporated in the Freeport Public\r\n    Library. In 1900-01, Miss Taylor was in charge of the\r\n    information desk at the Pratt Institute Free Library,\r\n    Brooklyn. For many years she gave much of her time to work\r\n    in the prisons, and in 1914 she published \"The Man Behind\r\n    the Bars,\" describing some of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The library friend\" is the term that seems best to apply to that\r\nmember of the modern library's staff whose work is a development of the\r\nservice ordinarily rendered through the \"information desk.\"\r\nInformation-desk service as usually conceived, it is not; for the\r\nlibrary friend deals with the tendencies, tastes, and aspirations of\r\nreaders as much as if not more than with the definite question and\r\nanswer respecting facts. The office indeed may be regarded as finding\r\nits first expression in the circulating libraries maintained by\r\nsubscription in many of the smaller cities twenty-five years and more\r\nago, when the free public library of to-day was comparatively rare. In\r\nthose libraries every subscriber knew the librarian, and the librarian\r\nwas personally acquainted with every book on the shelves. To bring the\r\nbooks and readers into congenial relationship was the business and\r\nusually the pleasure of the librarian. The personal element was the\r\nheart from which the circulation of the books radiated--if the presiding\r\npersonality lacked vitality and enthusiasm the library was a failure.\r\n\r\nWith the era of the democratic free libraries, with their more rapid\r\ngrowth, with their doors open to men, women and children of all classes,\r\nthe human element, the personal relation of librarian to the reader\r\nsuffered a gradual eclipse, until, in some libraries more perfectly\r\ndeveloped on the technical side, the personal equation vanished\r\naltogether. The library became a great machine, into which a number was\r\ndropped, and out of which a book was dropped like corn from the hopper.\r\nWe all know how formidable this mechanism is to those unaccustomed to\r\nmodern library methods. To the uninitiated the card catalog is an\r\nabomination, an unsolved problem, a delusion and a snare. The boy who is\r\ninterested in athletics, fumbling over the card catalog in Micawber-like\r\nfashion, hits upon the title \"Morning and evening exercises\"; he\r\nstraight away hands in the number thinking he has found a prize. It is\r\ndiscouraging and depressing when the machine shoots out to him a volume\r\nof devotional compilations. He has tried his luck and it has failed, and\r\nas he was reminded only last week that a book cannot be exchanged the\r\nsame day on which it is drawn out he retires with \"Morning and evening\r\nexercises,\" a sadder, but not a wiser boy. It is in accord, therefore,\r\nwith the process of library evolution that a closer personal relation\r\nbetween reader and librarian should be developed through some such\r\nmedium as is here outlined under the designation \"the library friend.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the library problems just now is this: given on the one side\r\n100,000 books and on the other 50,000 people. How is each individual to\r\nbe brought into contact with the particular book that he wants? Where\r\nopen shelves are practicable a great advantage--to the discriminating\r\nreader, an inestimable advantage, is gained; but the majority of\r\nlibrarians have not room to throw any department open to the public; and\r\neven among open shelves the person whose judgment of books is wholly\r\nuntrained often misses what he is looking for.\r\n\r\nThe assistance given by the reference room is invaluable. There no one\r\ngoes away unsatisfied; but the reference room reaches only those in\r\npursuit of a definite subject. Beyond its range is the drifting, aimless\r\nreader, the searcher after something he knows not what. The dull, the\r\ndiffident, the beginners in the use of libraries, those who read purely\r\nfor amusement and those who want the new books--new spelled with a\r\ncapital n and book with a small b--old persons, those whose eyesight is\r\ndefective and whose glasses strike the card catalog at the wrong angle,\r\nforeigners who use English with difficulty and diffidence--all these\r\ngather together in the delivery room at once, and efficient as the\r\nassistant may be--and sometimes they effect miracles--it is impossible\r\nfor them to give the different individuals the help each one needs. In\r\nthe libraries where the human element is most withdrawn the case of\r\nthese people is hard.\r\n\r\nTo bring the personal relation again into the library and to develop it\r\nwith the growth of the needs of the public, with this end in view, a\r\nnumber of libraries have introduced the information desk. By common\r\nconsent, perhaps in the eternal fitness of things, this position so far\r\nseems to have been relegated to woman.\r\n\r\n\"She is a reading lady, and far gone in the pleasures of friendship.\"\r\nSo wrote Sir Roger De Coverley of the object of his affections, and no\r\none could more felicitously describe two of the qualifications for the\r\none presiding at the information desk. A reading lady she must be; and\r\nit is no less important that she be far gone in friendship for the\r\npublic. To study their needs; to be receptive as wax to their impress,\r\nand responsive with heart and soul as well as with mind. This all around\r\nsympathetic power is the fundamental requisite of true service in this\r\nposition. She may be a person of many words or of few; a good listener\r\nshe must be. Success depends less upon temperament or gifts than upon an\r\nattitude of inward receptivity and outgoing friendliness--the attitude\r\nthat radiates a home-like atmosphere and insensibly sets the stranger at\r\nease. Emerson quaintly described certain faces as \"decorated with\r\ninvitation.\" This style of decoration will be permanently in fashion in\r\nthis position if the invitation from the heart is a magnet strong enough\r\nto draw within its circle those who are in need of help. It is most\r\nnecessary, also, that a certain poise be preserved. To be ready but not\r\nover anxious to assist; to be responsive but not intrusive; to be\r\nsuggestive but never insistent; to recommend books without forcing one's\r\nown literary tastes or standards upon others; while helping new comers,\r\nto seek to make them independent in their use of the library instead of\r\nleading them to rely on some one else to do the work and use all the\r\njudgement for them, all this requires a nice adjustment of balances. And\r\nit is well to have on hand the tact which is the art of lessening social\r\nfriction, and the sense of humor so invaluable as a lubricator in human\r\nrelations. When any one comes to the information desk with a grievance,\r\nirritated, if not angry, to be met with simple good nature, and not to\r\nbe taken too seriously, and yet to find instant readiness to adjust the\r\ncause of annoyance if possible, soon dissipates the feeling of\r\nantagonism or injury. Such encounters ought not to tax one's patience.\r\nThey sometimes turn out to be rather interesting.\r\n\r\nNor need stupidity tax one's patience. What more pathetic than the\r\nisolation of one who is slow to perceive and to grasp? It is a terrible\r\nhandicap. To rescue the dull from their dullness should be the first\r\nimpulse, and shallow is the sympathy that does not reach out to such\r\ninstinctively. It is not enough to be able also to unlock the resources\r\nof the individual.\r\n\r\nPeople come to libraries from all sorts of homes. To the man or woman\r\nliving in the midst of ugly and sordid surroundings, where the days are\r\ncrowded with drudgery, the weekly visit to the library becomes a social\r\nevent; it is a lift into a fresh atmosphere, into another plane of life.\r\nA passing greeting from the information desk gives a sense of welcome\r\nand of relationship to the reading public. Five or ten minutes of\r\ncordial contact, a brief conversation with one unrelated to their world\r\nof worries, is a refreshing experience. To be recognized as a thinking,\r\nreading being, with opinions about books, instead of a human machine for\r\ncooking, scrubbing and sewing, or money-getting, puts new life into one.\r\n\r\nBut this social side of the work of the information desk must rest on\r\nthe solid foundation of practical qualifications. One must possess the\r\nknowledge of a wide range of books, the power of concentration on the\r\none person or the one subject in hand, and the mental alertness that\r\nperceives when another person is waiting. The more perfect the\r\nunderstanding of the system of classification of the books and of all\r\nthe technical side of library work, the more effective will be the\r\nservice at the information desk. There the resources of the library\r\nshould be at command, and should be reached rapidly and accurately. When\r\nany imaginable or unimaginable question may be asked at any moment, from\r\n\"May I use your pencil?\" up through the whole range of history, art,\r\nliterature, politics, science or religion, one must know the ground\r\nthoroughly in order to meet these demands. Topics requiring special\r\nresearch are passed on to the reference room, but the inquirer should be\r\nput on the right track when he wants but a single book from the delivery\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer must be instructed in intelligent use of the catalogs and\r\nhelped towards self-reliance from the start. The young people must be\r\nassisted in making out their first lists, and these lists should\r\nrepresent a variety of authors, in order that the author who pleases can\r\nbe followed up independently through the card catalogs. A well selected\r\nfirst list for boys or girls should place at their command a range of\r\n50, 60, or 100 books. It is surprising how few writers are known to the\r\naverage boy or girl who comes to the public library for fiction. The\r\nfield of the boy is often bounded by Alger, Ellis, Optic, and Henty,\r\nwhile the girls may know only Sophie May and Miss Olcott. Beyond are\r\nunknown seas. One of the early developments at the information desk will\r\nbe carefully-selected lists of books for boys and girls. They grow under\r\none's hand as the young people in turn recommend additions. This sense\r\nof co-operation wins the confidence of those who are quick to suspect\r\nand ward off any lurking desire for their improvement on the part of the\r\nlibrary. Notwithstanding that the starting point must always be the\r\ntaste and inclination of the reader, it is a simple matter to keep the\r\npressure in the right direction. Carefully-selected fiction lists for\r\nolder readers also meet a want. Such lists do not include the works of\r\nthe standard, voluminous writers known to every one. Into them are\r\ngathered some of the old favorites of a generation ago, or later novels\r\nwhich may have happened to miss fame and yet possess an abiding charm\r\nand the indispensable element of interest. There are hundreds of such\r\nbooks, perennially delightful, novels just now submerged under the\r\ncontinually rising tide of new fiction. It is a piece of pure good\r\nfortune for the reader who turns in despair from the pursuit of \"David\r\nHarum,\" \"Eben Holden,\" or \"Janice Meredith,\" to find a fresh range of\r\nunheard-of novels of equal or more than equal interest. This enlargement\r\nof their circle of congenial authors is welcomed with every grateful\r\nappreciation. A list of good short stories is another resource, and one\r\nof cheerful books for invalids; stories that are neither morbid nor\r\ntragic. Young working men who can come to the library only at evening\r\nare glad of assistance in selecting books related to their work and they\r\nare quick to respond to any evidence of sympathetic interest in their\r\npursuit. Young girls employed during the day who wish to make up for the\r\nlack of opportunities in school are eager and grateful for advice in\r\noutlining courses of reading and study; those studying music are glad of\r\nguidance into the more interesting pathways of musical literature, or it\r\nmay be the amateur in some branch of art who reveals a cherished\r\nambition in the hope of obtaining help in this direction, and\r\ndelightfully friendly relations spring into being while these various\r\nlists are under way.\r\n\r\nOften the chance encounter, the mere passing remark, brings the happy\r\ninspiration as to just the right books, as when one catches a glimpse of\r\na deep enthusiasm for nature surviving in the breast of a man through\r\nfifty years spent between city walls. To introduce him to Richard\r\nJeffries, most intense, nearest to nature's spirit, and least known of\r\nnature's lovers, is to enrich the remaining years of this man's life.\r\n\r\nAll who go to the library go as seekers. Some are seeking merely\r\nentertainment, others are searching for knowledge, but many are\r\nstruggling with the deep problems that beset us all, perhaps in moral or\r\nspiritual darkness, and looking only for light. If one's heart is with\r\nthe people, nothing so quickens perception as sympathy. One notes the\r\ntrend of the reading of the individual, and often what he is seeking is\r\nintuitively divined. Perhaps the simple remark, \"If you can tell me just\r\nwhat you want I may be able to find it for you,\" results in a frank\r\nstatement of the difficulty, or an outburst of sudden confidence is\r\ngiven from the impulse that makes it often easier to confide in a\r\nstranger than in a relative. And it counts for a good deal just then if\r\nthe one at the information desk knows what writer has felt and thought\r\nmost deeply and has written most clearly and helpfully on that subject.\r\nFew are the needs of the human heart or mind that are really beyond the\r\nreach of help from books--books in which we find the reflection of our\r\nevery mood, the expression in our inmost aspiration, the conservation of\r\nthe feeling, the experience and the wisdom of the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROL AND GUIDANCE OF READING\r\n\r\n\r\n    Border regions are those of greatest interest, for they are\r\n    regions of contact and therefore places where things happen.\r\n    This is a border region between the field of the librarian\r\n    and that of the teacher. Its activities are the sole\r\n    justification for the name \"library teacher\" bestowed upon\r\n    assistants in many of the homelier city districts. Here the\r\n    librarian must tread warily. He can not push or pull; he\r\n    must effect what he desires by making it attractive to the\r\n    reader. In the five following papers this function is\r\n    somewhat elaborated--a very modern phase of library work and\r\n    one most nearly concerned with its socialization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABLE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL OUTCOME OF THE RAPID INCREASE OF PUBLIC\r\nLIBRARIES\r\n\r\n    A paper by Rev. Dr. Pierce, then editor of _Zion's Herald_,\r\n    a Methodist publication, read at the Lake George Conference\r\n    of the American Library Association in 1885. Notably free\r\n    from the caution and hesitancy then often appearing in the\r\n    public utterances of the clergy regarding popular libraries,\r\n    and full of belief that their power of guidance would make\r\n    them \"powerful elements of culture.\"\r\n\r\n    Bradford Kinney Pierce was born in Royalton, Vt., February\r\n    3, 1819, and graduated at Wesleyan University in 1841.\r\n    Entering the Methodist Episcopal ministry, he was also\r\n    occupied for many years as teacher and editor, being agent\r\n    of the Sunday School Union in 1845-56, editing _Zion's\r\n    Herald_ in 1872-88 and then serving as librarian of the Free\r\n    Library at Newton, Mass., in addition to his other duties,\r\n    until his death, April 19, 1889. He has been called \"the\r\n    Nestor of New England Methodism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe free public library is now becoming the favorite posthumous\r\nbeneficiary of our men of wealth. Heretofore it has hardly been esteemed\r\nrespectable in the vicinity of Boston for a man of fortune to die\r\nwithout leaving a generous bequest to Harvard College or to the\r\nMassachusetts General Hospital. The city and town library is now\r\nbeginning to share liberally in these testamentary benefactions. The\r\ncollege requires too considerable a sum in our days to be often\r\nadequately endowed by the estate of one patron, but the library can be\r\nestablished and be quite amply appointed by the accumulation of one\r\npublic-spirited citizen, and be made to become his most-honored and\r\npermanent memorial. Every town of any size in our New England and\r\nNorthern States either has, or will soon have, one of these people's\r\nuniversities, through the individual gift of a generous citizen, or by\r\npublic establishment.\r\n\r\nThis general gathering of large bodies of books in all our principal\r\ntowns, opened freely to all ages, can but produce a manifest influence\r\nfor good or evil in the community. The familiar and forcible response to\r\nthe objection made to the establishment of so many small colleges in the\r\nland, rather than securing their consecration and abundant endowment and\r\nappointment in a few centres, is that the \"fresh-water institution,\" so\r\ncalled, brings the opportunities for a liberal culture near to thousands\r\nwho could not otherwise be prompted to make the incident sacrifices to\r\nsecure an advanced education. The immediate presence itself of the\r\ninstitution is an inspiration to study. So the presence of the numerous\r\nlibraries, with their wide-open doors to all, and their attractive\r\nshelves, becomes a powerful incitement to those who otherwise would\r\nhardly think of seeking enjoyment or profit in reading. The statistics\r\nof these city and town libraries fully confirm this _a-priori_\r\npresumption as to their influence in awakening and cultivating an\r\ninterest in books among all classes. And this influence of books upon a\r\nreading community is very powerful. It is more subtle than human\r\ncompanionship. The latter strongly affects and moulds the character; but\r\nbooks reach us at lower depths. They inspire us more profoundly; they\r\ntouch our whole being, intellect, heart, and executive purpose; they\r\nimperceptibly create or modify our ethical standards; they become our\r\nmodels of life and conduct; they lay hold of our highest and most sacred\r\nsentiments and color our views of the life beyond.\r\n\r\nIt can but be, where the circulation of these volumes reaches nearly\r\nall our families and enters into the thoughts and emotions of every day\r\nof the year, that manifest results for the better or the worse will\r\nfollow. Many thoughtful persons have been honestly anxious in reference\r\nto the result of the experiment. The public press has sent out its\r\nserious forebodings from the pens of those who have taken depressing\r\nviews of the matter, and alarming tracts have been published, giving\r\npainful criticisms upon the contents of certain libraries, the nature of\r\nspecial volumes found upon their shelves, and the amount of circulation\r\nof works of fiction of not the most elevating, or even wholesome,\r\ncharacter. To all this we answer that these criticisms, whether well\r\nfounded or not, have not been without their influence in calling\r\nattention to the most intelligent of our institutions. Their officers\r\nare cultured gentlemen and ladies, clearly apprehending the relation of\r\nthe library to the intellectual and moral development of the community\r\nand its true office in administering to the improvement, as well as\r\nenjoyment, of its patrons. It is more and more becoming an educating\r\nrather than a simply entertaining institution. It is every day becoming\r\nmore widely recognized that it is not intended to be a competitor with\r\nthe circulating library, but rather an antagonist, winning the patrons\r\nof the latter to the reading and study of a higher order of literature.\r\nWhile the majority of library managers do not take the extreme view that\r\nhas been strongly advocated by some quite intelligent library trustees,\r\nthat the public funds should not be used for the purchase of fiction,\r\nwhich may be considered an intellectual luxury, but only for improving\r\nand educating literature, they do seek to carefully sift the lighter\r\nissues of the press, securing the best and the purest of this character.\r\nThey also study at the same time, through their accomplished officers\r\nand assistants, in the use of the local press, through the cooperation\r\nof the teachers of the schools and the leaders of public opinion, with\r\nthe aid of parents, to awaken especially in the minds of the young\r\npeople a taste for regular and substantial courses of reading in the\r\nvarious departments of science, history, and _belles-lettres_. The\r\nsuccess that has attended these efforts is full of encouragement. Our\r\nsuperintendents and librarians do not simply remain at their desks, or\r\nstand behind their tables to respond to the call for books, but make\r\nthemselves felt in the community, aiding in the investigations of\r\nstudents, assisting in the search for authorities, facts, and\r\nillustrations, suggesting plans for interesting the youthful readers in\r\nscientific or literary studies, and calling attention to the rich\r\naccumulations upon the library shelves. The annual reports of these\r\ninstitutions are constantly showing improvement in the character of the\r\nreading in their several communities,--a gradual decrease in the lighter\r\nworks, and an increase in the call for books of art and science, of\r\ntravel and biography, of poetry and philosophy. A significant falling\r\noff in the number of books taken from the library, in many places, is\r\nnoticed, while the patronage of the library is manifestly increased. The\r\nworks that are now selected are substantial, requiring thought and time\r\nin reading. They cannot be hurried over in a day like the light novel,\r\nand hence the decrease in the number of volumes read is a most\r\ngratifying evidence of improvement in the quality of the reading.\r\n\r\nThe free library is becoming the effectual antagonist, also, of the\r\nsuperficial news and story papers. Their \"name is legion.\" They assault\r\nthe eye with their staring illustrations, and tempt the reader by their\r\ncheapness. Especially at the close of the week, supplies of this trash,\r\nwith periodical sheets of a little higher order, but still superficial,\r\nhave been heretofore laid in for the hours of respite from labor on the\r\nSabbath. This light, disconnected, desultory reading, carried on through\r\nall the unoccupied hours of the week, while it secures a smattering of\r\ninformation, can but be of a very vicious intellectual tendency, not to\r\nspeak of its moral influence. The free library and its reading-room\r\noffer without expense the perusal of the best periodical literature in\r\nthe land, and permit and tempt their patrons to secure, for the\r\nunemployed hours of the approaching Sabbath, works of deep interest and\r\nof an improving character.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that this multiplication of well-selected and\r\nconstantly growing collections of standard and current literature is\r\nfull of promise of good, and, as generally managed among us, is attended\r\nwith small and easily corrected evils. It is inspiring the establishment\r\nof literary and scientific clubs, awakening the ambition and inventive\r\npowers of our mechanics, encouraging a liberal and cultivating course of\r\nreading among our school students, and affording an immeasurable amount\r\nof pure and refining enjoyment throughout the community. We look upon it\r\nas one of the significant and powerful elements of a higher and general\r\nculture among the people, and prophetic of far greater and better fruits\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBILITIES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN MANUFACTURING COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\n    \"A love of reading as a keynote to broader culture,\" and how\r\n    the librarian may guide reading by stimulating that love--a\r\n    paper by Mrs. Sanders of the Pawtucket Public Library (long\r\n    lovingly known among librarians as \"Mawtucket of\r\n    Pawtucket\").\r\n\r\n    Minerva Amanda Sanders was born in Providence, R.I., Feb. 1,\r\n    1837. About 1876 she became librarian of the subscription\r\n    library in Pawtucket, R.I., organized in 1852, which\r\n    preceded the present free library; and when about six months\r\n    later it was turned over to the town, she continued in\r\n    charge, serving until her death, March 20, 1912. Mrs.\r\n    Sanders did notable pioneer work in her profession,\r\n    especially in the adoption of free access to books and in\r\n    work with children. This paper was read at the Thousand\r\n    Islands Conference of the American Library Association in\r\n    1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, in an address to the working people of Windsor and\r\nEton upon the occasion of opening a public library for their use in\r\n1839, said:--\r\n\r\n\"If I were to pray for a taste, which should stand me in stead under\r\nevery variety of circumstances, and be a source of happiness and\r\ncheerfulness to me through life, and as a shield against its ills\r\nhowever things might go amiss and the world frown upon me, it would be a\r\ntaste for reading.\r\n\r\n\"Give a man this taste and a means of gratifying it, and you can hardly\r\nfail of making a happy man, unless, indeed, you put into his hands a\r\nmost perverse selection of books.\r\n\r\n\"You place him in contact with the best society in every period of\r\nhistory; with the wisest, the wittiest, with the tenderest, the bravest,\r\nand the purest characters who have adorned humanity.\r\n\r\n\"You make him a denizen of all nations, a contemporary of all ages. The\r\nworld has been created for him. It is hardly possible but the character\r\nshould take a higher and better tone from the constant habit of\r\nassociating in thought with a class of thinkers, to say the least of it,\r\nabove the average of humanity.\r\n\r\n\"It is morally impossible but that the manners should take a tinge of\r\ngood breeding and civilization from having constantly before one's eyes\r\nthe way in which the best-bred and the best-informed men have talked and\r\nconducted themselves in their intercourse with each other.\r\n\r\n\"There is a gentle but perfectly irresistible coercion in a habit of\r\nreading well directed, over the whole tenor of a man's character and\r\nconduct, which is not the less effectual because it is really the last\r\nthing he dreams of.\r\n\r\n\"It cannot, in short, be better summed up than in these few words: It\r\ncivilizes the conduct of men, and suffers them not to remain\r\nbarbarians.\"\r\n\r\nRecognizing this love of reading as the keynote to broader culture and a\r\nhigher standard of morals, one by one, during the last half-century,\r\nlibraries have been thrown open to the public that were before only\r\naccessible to the scholar (and often grudgingly even to him) and new\r\nlibraries established, till, in every community, a free public library\r\nis as much a necessity to-day as its churches or its schools.\r\n\r\nEven in the troublous days of the Revolution our forefathers were\r\nawaking to this demand, for in 1776 there were 29 \"partially public\r\nlibraries in the colonies\"; in 1800 there were 49; in 1876 the number\r\nhad increased to over 3,000; while to-day we number between 5,000 and\r\n6,000 public libraries, comprising a total of over 20,000,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe influence of a public library is contingent upon many\r\ncircumstances--its community, its finances, and largely upon its\r\nmanagement. Possibilities which may be developed in one library, in\r\nanother remain unnoticed; while something of equal importance is made of\r\nincalculable benefit to its own community. Thus, though working on a\r\ngeneral principle, each library independently works out the problem of\r\nthe greatest good to the greatest number of its own patrons. Happily,\r\ntherefore, there is no cause for the rivalry and jealousies that disturb\r\nthe harmony of so many fraternities.\r\n\r\nIt is my pleasure and privilege to live in a manufacturing community; to\r\nwatch the development of practical ideas; to follow the progress of\r\nmechanical improvement, and witness with pride their results, for the\r\ndistinctive feature of Pawtucket is the variety of its industries.\r\n\r\nWe remember with pride our parentage and the honor due to it; but surely\r\nwhen Samuel Slater, after a weary time of toil and discouragement,\r\nperfected the first power machinery for cotton spinning in this country,\r\nand with a pardonable pride saw it in successful operation in the first\r\nbona fide cotton mill in the United States, which still stands in the\r\ncentre of our city--(I speak with authority though I am fully aware that\r\nthis is a case parallel to the \"Seven Grecian cities striving for Homer\r\ndead.\")--When, as I said, this was accomplished in 1791, there was no\r\npower of the imagination that could have foreseen the change from the\r\nlittle mill village on the Blackstone River, with its few hundred\r\ninhabitants, to the present city of 25,000, 13,000 of whom are engaged\r\nin industrial pursuits, its 70 schools, its 600 manufacturing\r\nestablishments, embracing the greatest variety of industries.\r\n\r\nBut Pawtucket is only one of many thriving manufacturing communities.\r\n\r\nWaltham, Mass., the adoptive parent of the American Watch Co., which had\r\nin 1865 a population of but 7,000, now numbers over 16,000, with not\r\nless than 7,000 employes, 2,500 of whom alone are employed by the\r\nAmerican Watch Co.\r\n\r\nLowell, Mass., according to the census of 1883, had a population of\r\n66,000, one third of whom were employed in its 300 manufactories.\r\n\r\nManchester, N.H., with a population of 40,000, employs 15,000 persons in\r\nits 102 manufactories.\r\n\r\nAnd so I might go on enumerating special statistics, but these are\r\nsimply representative communities. It is sufficient for my purpose to\r\nsay that there are in the United States about 254,000 manufacturing\r\nestablishments, employing nearly 3,000,000 persons, at an average wage\r\nof $1.15 per working day.\r\n\r\nIt is to this great class that we look for much of the prosperity of\r\nour country; for we find that the value of the product of the\r\nmanufactures of the United States for the last ten years was\r\n$5,400,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt is also an important factor in our government, for the pride and\r\nprinciple of our country is \"Vox populi, vox Dei.\"\r\n\r\nIn these days when skilled labor is at a premium, when issues are\r\nconstantly arising requiring the best legislative ability, and the\r\ndemand for both is far greater than the supply, how are we to meet it?\r\nThe reply comes from far and near, \"Educate the people.\" Yes, educate\r\nthe people! for they are very ready to be educated, many of them\r\nstriving with a self-denial known only to themselves to give to their\r\nchildren the education that was denied them; our schools of to-day are\r\nshowing good work from the sons and daughters of these parents, and its\r\ninfluence is blessing their homes.\r\n\r\nBut many are denied that privilege, and cannot afford to spare their\r\nchildren's wages for even the three months covering the compulsory law\r\nof education.\r\n\r\nAt the average wage a private library though small is unattainable; a\r\nnewspaper may be a luxury indulged in. Where, then, is the royal road to\r\nlearning? We do not hesitate to say the free public library is that\r\nlong-sought highway. Then open wide the doors; let us stock our shelves\r\nwith the best mechanical and scientific works; see that each craft is\r\nespecially represented; supply the works on the leading questions of the\r\nday, also works pertaining to the civil government. In this we must not\r\nbe partisan; these subjects must be considered in all their bearings,\r\nand in the broadest manner.\r\n\r\nThe biographies of working men who have attained honor by their\r\npractical worth and perserverance either in mechanical, civil, or\r\nmilitary service must have a prominent place; history and travel will\r\nreceive their share of attention; while we will not forget that the\r\nworking man and woman must have some amusement and recreation, and that\r\n\"strong meat\" is not always desirable; our fiction department must be\r\nsupplied with all that is bright, fresh, inspiring, and helpful, but\r\nnothing that will create a craving for greater stimulant, or tend in the\r\nleast degree to weaken the moral character; for the office of a public\r\nlibrary is to develop to its fullest capacity the best powers of a\r\ncommunity. The extent of such development must depend largely upon the\r\nmanner of its use.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the first entrance into a library should bring with it\r\nthat most delightful sensation, the companionship of books, we have at\r\nour own library, contrary to the custom which now obtains, thrown open\r\nour shelves to the public, with the title and name of author plainly\r\nprinted on each volume so that literally \"he who runs may read.\"\r\n\r\nAn old man said to me a few days since: \"I get little time for reading\r\nnow, but I love to come in and look at the books; they bring to mind\r\nmany a thing that I read long ago, and I carry it with me all the day\r\nthrough; 'tis an education just to be with them.\" You say, How can this\r\nbe done without loss of books?\r\n\r\nTen years of experience has taught us that there is a point of honor in\r\nthese working people in this regard, with which we must come in contact\r\nto fully appreciate; we have lost no more books with our open system\r\nthan other libraries with their closed shelves.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding fully the value of a catalogue, especially a closely\r\nclassified one, to the scholar; to an uneducated man it is a labyrinth\r\nthrough which he gropes till in despair he either lays it aside or\r\nappeals for help. What is a catalogue to a man who asks for \"a book on\r\nbirds,\" and when we direct an attendant to give him a certain work on\r\nornithology, quickly replies, \"'Tis not that I want; 'tis a book on\r\nbirds;\" or the girl who wants an \"adequate book\" to furbish up her\r\nsociety manners. Not one in ten persons comes to a library with a\r\ndefinite object.\r\n\r\nRoaming at will among the books, the sight of Blaikie's \"How to get\r\nstrong\" has been the first step toward the recovery of health otherwise\r\nlost; John B. Gough's \"Darkness and daylight\" has brought in the same\r\nway happiness to a wretched household; while Andrew Carnegie's\r\n\"Triumphant Democracy\" has awakened in more than one citizen an interest\r\nand pride in his native or adopted country heretofore unknown.\r\n\r\nThere are the contents of the shelves to select from; no fear of any one\r\nleaving the library without a book; whereas, after presenting from the\r\ncatalogue a list of books to be returned as \"not in,\" he either \"hasn't\r\ntime,\" or \"will make no further trouble,\" and passes out unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nI have already said that a possibility in one community may be\r\nimpracticable in another; with us this open system has proved an\r\nunqualified success.\r\n\r\nA community of this class is not aggressive; on the contrary they are\r\nin a library rather shy. They should be met with prompt service, and the\r\ncourtesy of the drawing-room. Make them welcome as they enter the\r\nlibrary; it is their own; help them to cultivate a personal pride in it;\r\nascertain their tastes, (many of them will surprise us), and call their\r\nattention to such works as will gratify them, gradually leading them to\r\nhigher standards when it is necessary.\r\n\r\nIf they are seeking special subjects and need our help, let us exhaust\r\nour references. To \"give to him that asketh\" and \"the Lord loveth a\r\ncheerful giver\" should be a librarian's watchword.\r\n\r\nWhat does it matter if half of the pleasures, and all of the ills of our\r\npatrons be poured into our ears? It only brings us nearer to them, and\r\nshows us how to be more helpful, and widens the influence of our work.\r\n\r\n'Tis a wise community that enables its trustees to give to their\r\nlibrarian sufficient clerical assistance to allow him to mingle with the\r\npeople, to learn their habits and tastes, to direct their reading\r\n(especially of the young), and to assist them in their researches; for\r\nwe all know that peculiarly inherent weakness of human nature, to seek\r\nfor information from the highest source, and to be better satisfied,\r\neven though the same help may be rendered us by a subordinate.\r\n\r\nThe reading-room in connection with a public library may be made an\r\nimportant agent in the education of a community, especially of its young\r\nmen and children.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of hard work, what are the homes to which many of these\r\nyoung men return? The accommodations of a cheap boarding-house, which\r\nmeans a room generally occupied by two or more, with barely furniture\r\nfor necessity to say nothing of comfort.\r\n\r\nWhat inducement has he to spend his evenings at home? Where, then, will\r\nhe go? Into the street, to drift into the place offering the most\r\nattraction for the least money; alas! too often at the bitter cost of\r\nmisery to himself and sorrow for his friends hereafter.\r\n\r\nThis, then is our work, to make our reading-rooms so attractive that\r\nthey will be drawn hither. Have them well lighted, well heated and\r\nventilated, supplied with the daily papers of our own and other cities,\r\nalso the current magazines. We cannot afford to be niggardly in this\r\nwork. Let us supply our tables with illustrated mechanical and art\r\nworks, also the best literature of the day. The more freedom that we can\r\ngive, the better the results. The young man will pass in and out at his\r\npleasure, spending an hour or two with whatever pleases him best, till\r\nthe reading-room largely takes the place of home, and reading becomes a\r\npart of his daily existence, the beneficent effect of which he will\r\ncarry through life.\r\n\r\nThere are lying on our tables week after week by actual count 600\r\npapers, magazines, and books, from \"Baby Days\" to \"The Cathedrals of the\r\nWorld,\" free to the public. This has ceased to be an experiment, for\r\nduring the ten years our losses have not amounted to $10; and there are\r\ndays when nearly if not quite 500 persons sit at our tables.\r\n\r\nThe greater possibilities, however, are with our children, the future\r\nparents and guardians of our commonwealth. What are we doing for them as\r\npublic libraries, as educators? Working hand in hand with the schools\r\nfaithfully and well, as shown by the valuable and interesting reports\r\npublished in the Library journal, without which we would know as little\r\nof the library work outside our own as we would know of the outside\r\nworld without our newspaper. Long may it live!\r\n\r\nDoes our responsibility rest here? What of the multitude of waifs worse\r\nthan homeless, without restraining or guiding influence, to be thrown\r\ninto the community to swell the numbers of paupers and criminals, many\r\nof whom, yes, the majority of whom, have the same gentle instincts and\r\nlatent ability as our own little ones so tenderly nurtured.\r\n\r\nWe may say this is the work of charitable institutions and humane\r\nsocieties; not so; this is essentially our work. We call ourselves\r\neducators, and have the honor to be recognized as such; the work of a\r\npublic library is to teach, to elevate, to ennoble, there is no limit to\r\nits possible influence.\r\n\r\nMust we wait, then, until our children (for they are all ours as a\r\ncommunity) are fourteen years of age or upwards before we begin to teach\r\nthem the first principles of right living, of mental growth, of love to\r\ntheir neighbor?\r\n\r\nWe maintain that we cannot begin too early, and that this is a part of\r\nlibrary work from which we get the greatest percentage of reward. Again\r\nI ask, What are we doing for these children, the future pride or\r\ndishonor of our communities?\r\n\r\nBrockton, Mass., has a reading-room to which children are admitted, and\r\nwhich they are encouraged to visit, so well patronized that it will soon\r\ndouble its seating capacity.\r\n\r\nWaltham, Mass., has taken a step in the right direction. The trustees of\r\nthe public library have supplied two tables in their waiting room with\r\nWide awake and St. Nicholas for the children.\r\n\r\nLowell, Mass., admits children during the day, and supplies them with\r\njuvenile magazines. Manchester, N.H., admits children to the\r\nreading-room; but unfortunately, from various causes, they are unable to\r\noffer the necessary attractions, and few visit it.\r\n\r\nNewport, R.I., can only furnish St. Nicholas for want of money, but\r\nchildren may come and go at their pleasure.\r\n\r\nOlneyville, R.I., is offering every inducement that their means will\r\nallow to draw children to their reading-room; and to interest and\r\ninstruct them seems to be the object of those in charge.\r\n\r\nWillimantic, Conn., admits children at the age of 12 years.\r\n\r\nSomerville, Mass., supplies juvenile magazines, and has no limit to age.\r\n\r\nSpringfield, Mass., also admits children at all ages.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Public Library, the parent of the public libraries of New\r\nEngland, true to its paternal instinct, begins to exert its influence\r\nover the children at the earliest years.\r\n\r\nThere are doubtless others from whom we would be glad to hear, but I\r\nconfess that, after visiting and inquiring among public libraries\r\nconcerning this work, I became disheartened and ceased investigation,\r\nfor the popular verdict seems to be \"Children and Dogs not allowed.\"\r\n\r\nWith our experience in this work with the children since the opening of\r\nour library in 1876, and knowing the possibilities only waiting for\r\ndevelopment, I am emboldened to speak earnestly.\r\n\r\nLet us gather the children in; give \"milk for babies,\" in the\r\nillustrated books which they may understand though they cannot read;\r\njuvenile magazines and literature of a healthy nature to counteract the\r\npernicious trash that is flooding our communities.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to refer you to the specimens of flash literature\r\nwhich our boys have relinquished to us, with pale faces and trembling\r\nhands, after reading from the scrapbook here on exhibition the cuttings\r\nfrom the newspapers of the day showing the bad influence of the dime\r\nnovel. It tells its own story far better than I can tell it, and the one\r\nin whose mind this great remedial agent originated is daily blest in\r\nseeing the good results of his experiment.\r\n\r\nHelp the children to begin early to understand that even they are of use\r\nin a community; awaken their pride and ambition in the right direction,\r\nand their future is assured.\r\n\r\nIf there are those who doubt the practicability of this work, and, like\r\nHosea Bigelow, would\r\n\r\n    \"Give more for one live bobolink\r\n    Than a square mile of larks in printer's ink,\"\r\n\r\ncome and see our \"Flower Band,\" numbering 200 children, gathered from\r\nthe little girls and boys who frequent our library and reading-room,\r\nfrom five years of age to fourteen; from the little fellow who brings\r\nthree wilted daisies, or a rose without a stem, to the dainty miss with\r\na bouquet from the greenhouse.\r\n\r\nTheir badges signify a pledge to bring flowers once a week (if\r\npossible), and to respond to a call to distribute them in any place\r\nwhere they will add a bit of brightness to a shadowed household; also to\r\nseek out such homes and report them. Several names have been already\r\nstricken from our list, of those who have died leaving a blessing for\r\nthese little missionaries.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this work upon the children and the community cannot be\r\ntold. It must be seen to be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to show that upon the influence of the public library\r\nworking in harmony with the spirit of the churches and the schools, with\r\nthe single object of the highest welfare of the people, depends much of\r\nthe prosperity, morality, and culture of our industrial communities--I\r\nmight also say of our country; but when we consider that there are less\r\nthan 6,000 public libraries in the United States, are we not tempted to\r\nsay in the words of old, \"What are they among so many?\"\r\n\r\nBut let us remember that the same spirit that gave power to feed the\r\nmultitude from the \"five loaves and fishes\" still lives in the hearts of\r\nmen to animate them to good works, as shown by Messrs. Ames, Hail,\r\nPratt, Carnegie, Osterhout, Newberry, and a host of others whose names\r\nare yet to be engraved as public benefactors on the tablets of public\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nMay God speed the work!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS OF JOSEPH N. LARNED\r\n\r\n    The need of stronger forces in popular education--the\r\n    failure of the press--the library's opportunity, as it\r\n    appeared to a scholarly librarian of the so-called \"old\r\n    school\" in 1894.\r\n\r\n    Joseph Nelson Larned was born in Chatham, Ontario, May 11,\r\n    1836, and was educated in the public schools of Buffalo,\r\n    N.Y. He served on the editorial staff of the Buffalo\r\n    _Express_ in 1859-72, was superintendent of education in\r\n    Buffalo in 1872-73 and superintendent of the Buffalo Library\r\n    from 1877 until it became the Public Library in 1897, after\r\n    which he devoted himself to literature until his death in\r\n    1913. His best known work is his History for Ready Reference\r\n    and Topical Reading. He was president of the A.L.A. in\r\n    1893-94.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was my misfortune to be absent from the meeting at which you did me\r\nthe honor to elect me to this place, and I had no opportunity, either to\r\ngive my advice against that action, or to thank you for the distinction\r\nwith which it clothes me. The advice I would have given is now belated;\r\nbut my thanks have lost no warmth by the delay, and I pray you to accept\r\nthem with belief in their sincerity. At the same time I shall venture to\r\ndraw from the circumstances a certain claim upon your generosity. If it\r\nhappens to me to be tripped in some of these tangles of procedure which,\r\nin such meetings as this, await the stumbling feet of an untrained\r\npresiding officer, be good enough to remember the warning I would have\r\ngiven you if I had had the opportunity.\r\n\r\nWe are gathered for the sixteenth meeting of the American Library\r\nAssociation, in the eighteenth year of its existence. Our league of the\r\nlibraries is young; its history is unpretentious; but it is the history\r\nof a movement of higher importance to the world that many others that\r\nhave marched with trumpets, and drums. Eighteen years ago, the\r\nconception of the Library militant, of the Library as a moving force in\r\nthe world, of the Librarian as a missionary of literature, was one which\r\na few men only had grasped; but with which those few had already begun\r\nthe doing of a revolutionary work. To-day such ideals are being realized\r\nin most corners of the American republic. The last generation, and the\r\ngenerations before the last, were satisfied with the school as an agent\r\nof popular education. In our time we have brought the library to the\r\nhelp of the school, and the world is just opening its eyes to perceive\r\nthe enormous value of the reinforcement that is gained from this new\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAnd the discovery has come none too soon; for a desperate need of more\r\nand stronger forces in the work of popular education is pressing on us.\r\nIf we reflect on the social conditions of the present day, and review a\r\nlittle the working of the ferments in civilized society during a few\r\nyears last past, we shall marvel, I think, at the timeliness of the\r\nmovement which brings the public library, just now, to the front of\r\naction among the instruments and agencies of popular education. It is\r\nour fortune, good or ill as we may regard it, to be unmistakably passing\r\nthrough one of the greater crisies of human history. In the last\r\ncentury, modern democracy got its political footing in the world. Its\r\nbirth was older, and it had been cradled in divers nursing places,\r\nSwiss, Dutch, English, and New English; but last century it stepped into\r\npolitical history as the actor of the leading part; as the sovereign of\r\nthe future, mounting his throne. From the moment it came on the stage,\r\nall wise men knew that its need above every other need was education.\r\nThey made haste, in our country, to build school-houses and to set the\r\nschool-master at work; seeing plainly that all they might hope for and\r\nstrive for in the future would depend on the intelligence that could be\r\nput into the brain of this omnipotent sovereign who had risen to rule\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nWell, the schools and the school-masters served their purpose\r\nreasonably well for a reason. Democracy was fairly equipped with a\r\nspelling-book and a quill-pen for the duties and responsibilities of a\r\nsimple, slowly-moving time. The mass of its members, the every-day\r\npeople of the farm and the shop, read the pamphlets and the weekly\r\ngazettes of their day, and were gently drawn, with unconfused minds,\r\ninto one or the other of two straightly opposed political parties which\r\nsought their votes. If they lacked knowledge, there was a certain\r\ningenuousness in their character which paid respect to the opinions of\r\nmen who had more. If blundering in politics occurred, it was blundering\r\nleadership, for the most part, and more easily corrected than perversity\r\nin the ranks. So the reign of democracy was successful enough while\r\nsociety kept the simpler state.\r\n\r\nBut that simpler state is gone. We who are beyond middle age may say\r\nthat we have seen it disappear. We have witnessed a miraculous\r\ntransformation of the earth and of the people who dwell on it. We have\r\nseen the passing of Aladdin, who rubbed his magical electric lamp as he\r\nwent calling Afreets from the air to be the common servants of man. A\r\nchange has been wrought within fifty years that is measureless, not only\r\nin itself, but in its effects on the human race. The people who whisper\r\nin each other's ears across a continent; who know at noon-time in\r\nNebraska what happened in the morning at Samarcand; the people to whom a\r\nhundred leagues are neighborhood, and a thousand but easy distance; for\r\nwhom there is little mystery left on the face of the earth, nor anything\r\nhidden from their eyes; these people of our day are not in the likeness\r\nof the men and women who ambled horseback or rode in coaches from town\r\nto town, and who were content with a weekly mail. The fitting and\r\nfurniture of mind that would make a safe member of society and a good\r\ncitizen out of the man of small horizons, who lived the narrower life of\r\na generation or two ago, are perilously scant for these times.\r\n\r\nIt is true that all the wonderful quickening of life which has occurred\r\ncarries something of education in itself, and that men learn by living\r\nunder the conditions of the present day; but the learning caught in that\r\nway is of the dangerous kind. It is the delusive knowledge of the\r\nsurface of things; the deceitful lore which breeds mischievous beliefs\r\nand makes them fanatical. It goes but a little way, if at all, toward\r\nthe saving of society, as against the unrest, the discontent, the\r\ndesire, which torment such an age of revolution as ours.\r\n\r\nAnd the threatening fact is this: that ignorant opinions have acquired\r\nat the present day a capacity for harm enormously increased over that of\r\nthe elder times. They share the magnified potency that is given to all\r\nthings, good or ill, by the science of the modern man. Its million\r\ntongues are lent to them for propagation; but that is a matter of small\r\nseriousness compared with the boundless ease of combination which it\r\noffers to them at the same time. It is in that appalling facility of\r\nalliance and organization, which present conditions have given to men\r\nand women of every class and character, for every kind of aim and\r\npurpose, that the greatest peril of society lies in our day. A peril,\r\nthat is to say, so long as society has no assurance that the leagues and\r\nconfederacies formed within its bosom will be prevailingly well\r\ninstructed and intelligently controlled.\r\n\r\nAs a serious danger this is something quite new. It has come upon us\r\nwithin recent years. I can remember a state of things in which it was\r\ndifficult for a man in common life to join himself with other men, much\r\nbeyond his own neighborhood, in any effectual way, excepting as he did\r\nit on the lines of an old political party or an older church. But,\r\nto-day, leagues, unions, federations, associations, orders, rings, form\r\nthemselves among the restless, unstable elements of the time as clouds\r\nare formed in the atmosphere, and with kindred lightning flashes and\r\nmutterings of thunder. Any boldly ignorant inventor of a new economical\r\ntheory or a new political doctrine, or a new cornerstone for the fabric\r\nof society, can set on foot a movement from Maine to California, between\r\ntwo equinoxes, if he handles his invention with dexterity. This is what\r\ninvests popular ignorance with terrors which never appeared in it\r\nbefore, and it is this which has brought the real, responsible test of\r\ndemocracy, social and political, on our time and on us.\r\n\r\nDemocracy, in fact, has remained considerably, hitherto, an unworked\r\ntheory of society, even in communities which have supposed themselves to\r\nbe democratically constituted. It has remained so through want of\r\nconditions that would give a clear sound to the individual voice and\r\nfree play to the individual will. Those conditions are now arriving in\r\nthe world, and the democratic regime is consequently perfecting itself,\r\nnot politically alone, but economically, and in all the social relations\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nSo it is not exaggeration to say that we have come to a situation in\r\nwhich society must fight for its life against popular ignorance. The old\r\nagencies of education are inadequate, when the best has been made of\r\nthem. The common school does not go far enough, and cannot. Its chief\r\nfunction is to prepare a soil in the young mind for the after\r\nseed-planting which will produce fruits of intelligence. Unsupplemented,\r\nit is well-nigh barren of true educational results. The higher schools\r\nand colleges reach too small a number to count for much in a problem\r\nwhich concerns the teaching of the universal millions. What agency,\r\nthen, is there, that will prepare the democracy of the present and the\r\nfuture for its tremendous responsibilities?\r\n\r\nSome may say, the newspaper press: and I would rejoice if we could\r\naccept that reply. For the press is an educating power that might\r\ntransform the civilization of the world as swiftly in mind and morals as\r\nsteam and electricity have transformed its material aspects. There is\r\nnothing conceivable in the way of light and leading for mankind which a\r\nconscientious and cultivated newspaper press might not do within a\r\nsingle generation. But a press of that character and that effect seems\r\npossible only under circumstances of disinterestedness which are not\r\nlikely to exist. The publication of a newspaper may sometimes be\r\nundertaken as a duty, but not often. As a rule it is a business, like\r\nany other, with the mercenary objects of business; and as a rule, too,\r\nthe gain sought is more readily and more certainly found by pandering to\r\npopular ignorance than by striving against it. A few newspapers can\r\nsecure a clientage which they please best by dignity, by cleanness, by\r\nsober truthfulness, and by thoughtful intelligence, in their columns;\r\nbut the many are tempted always, not merely to stoop to low tastes and\r\nvulgar sentiments, but to cultivate them; because there is gravitation\r\nin the moral as well as the physical world, and culture in the downward\r\nway is easier than the upward.\r\n\r\nThe vulgarizing of the news press has been a late and rapid process,\r\nnearly coincident in cause and event with the evolution of this modern\r\ndemocracy which it makes more problematical. We need not be very old to\r\nhave seen the beginnings: the first skimming of the rich daily news of\r\nthe world for the scum and froth of it; the first invention of that\r\ndisgusting brew, from public sewers and private drains, with which the\r\npopular newspapers of the day feed morbid appetites. We can recall the\r\nvery routes by which it was carried from city to city, and taken up by\r\njournal after journal, as they discovered a latent, un-developed taste\r\nfor such ferments of literature in the communities around them. The\r\ntaste was latent, potential; it did not exist as a fact; it was not\r\nconscious of itself; it made no demands. The newspapers deliberately\r\nsought it out, delved for it, brought it to the surface, fed it,\r\nstimulated it, made it what it is to-day, an appetite as diseased and as\r\nshamefully pandered to as the appetite for intoxicating drams.\r\n\r\nAnd, so far as I can perceive, this action and reaction between what is\r\nignorant and vulgar in the public and what is mercenary and unscrupulous\r\nin the press will go on until popular education from other sources puts\r\nan end to it. For it is the saving fact that there are other sources;\r\nand foremost among them are the public libraries. If it has been our\r\nprivilege to see, and for some in our circle to bear a part in, the\r\nbeginnings of the active educational work of the libraries, I am\r\npersuaded that it is only the beginnings we have witnessed as yet. I am\r\npersuaded that the public library of the future will transcend our\r\ndreams in its penetrating influence. Consider for a moment what it is,\r\nand what it offers to the energies of education which a desperate\r\nnecessity is awakening and organizing in the world! It is a store, a\r\nreservoir, of the new knowledge of the latest day and the ripened wisdom\r\nof the long past. To carry into the memory and into the thought of all\r\nthe people who surround it, in a town, even some little part of what it\r\nholds of instructed reasoning and instructed feeling, would be to\r\ncivilize that community beyond the highest experience of civilization\r\nthat mankind has yet attained to. There is nothing that stands equally\r\nbeside it as a possible agent of common culture. It is the one fountain\r\nof intellectual life which cannot be exhausted; which need not be\r\nchanneled for any fortunate few; which can be generously led to the\r\nfilling of every cup, of every capacity, for old or young. There is\r\nlittle in it to tempt the befouling hand of the politician, and it\r\noffers no gain to the mercantile adventurer. For those who serve it on\r\nbehalf of the public there are few allurments of money or fame. Its vast\r\npowers for good are so little exposed to seduction or corruption that it\r\nseems to give promises for the future which are safer and surer than any\r\nothers that society can build hopes upon.\r\n\r\nIn this view, those who serve the public libraries have a great\r\nresponsibility laid on them. They hold in their hands what would give to\r\ncivilization an ideal refinement if it could be distributed and\r\ncommunicated to all. As we know very well, that is impossible. There is\r\na part of mankind, in every community, which never will feel, never can\r\nbe made to feel, the gentle attractiveness and influence of books. The\r\nfact is one not to be disputed or ignored. At the same time it is a fact\r\nto be treated practically as though it did not exist. It is our business\r\nto assume that the mission of good books, books of knowledge, books of\r\nthought, books of inspiration, books of right feeling, books of\r\nwholesome imagination, can be pushed to every hearth, and to every child\r\nand parent who sits by it. And it is our business to labor unsparingly\r\ntoward the making of that assumption good, without reckoning any\r\nfraction of hopelessness in it.\r\n\r\nThat is the business to which we are appointed in this world. Let us be\r\ncareful that we do not misconceive it in one most important particular!\r\nIt is not the mission of _books_ that we are charged with, but the\r\nmission of _good books_. And there lies a delicate, difficult, very\r\ngrave duty in that discrimination. To judge books with adequate\r\nknowledge and sufficient hospitality of mind; to exercise a just choice\r\namong them without offensive censorship; to defend his shelves against\r\nthe endless siege of vulgar literature, and yet not waste his strength\r\nin the resistance--these are really the crucial demands made on every\r\nlibrarian.\r\n\r\nFor the first condition of successful work is a good tool; and our tools\r\nare not _books_, but _good books_. These given, then follow those\r\ndemands on us which we sometimes discuss as though they came first of\r\nall: the demands, that is, for a perfected apparatus in the working\r\nlibrary, for a tireless energy in its motive forces, and for a large\r\nintelligence in the directing of them.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, our missionary undertakings from the library seemed\r\nto be bounded by its own walls. The improving, annotating, and\r\npopularizing of catalogues; the printing and distributing of bulletins\r\nand reference lists; the surrounding of readers and seekers in a library\r\nwith willing help and competent suggestion; these labors seemed, only a\r\nfew years ago, to include almost everything that the librarian most\r\nzealous as a missionary could do. But see what doors have been opening\r\nin the last few years, and what illimitable fields of labor now invite\r\nhim! Through one, the great army of the teachers in the common schools\r\nis coming into co-operation with him. Through another, he steps into the\r\nmovement of university extension, and finds in every one of its servants\r\na true apostle of the library mission of good books. From a third, he\r\nspreads his beneficient snares about a city in branches and delivery\r\nstations; and by a fourth he sends \"traveling libraries\" to the ends of\r\nhis State.\r\n\r\nThe arena of our work is large enough already to make claims on every\r\nfaculty and power we can bring to it; and yet our plainest duty is to\r\nenlarge it still. I think we may be sure that there are portals yet to\r\nopen, agents yet to enlist, alliances yet to enter, conquests yet to\r\nmake. And in the end--what?\r\n\r\nThose of us who have faith in the future of democracy can only hold our\r\nfaith fast by believing that the knowledge of the learned, the wisdom of\r\nthe thoughtful, the conscience of the upright, will some day be common\r\nenough to prevail, always, over every factious folly and every\r\nmischievous movement that evil minds of ignorance can set astir. When\r\nthat blessed time of victory shall have come, there will be many to\r\nshare the glory of it; but none among them will rank rightly before\r\nthose who have led and inspired the work of the public libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY AS AN INSPIRATIONAL FORCE\r\n\r\n    What a librarian may do to direct the attention of his\r\n    readers to the really great writers and thinkers--a plea for\r\n    original work and for innovation in the library--a note\r\n    frequently heard in 1920, but new in 1899 when Mr. Foss,\r\n    librarian and popular poet, sounded it in _Public Libraries_\r\n    for March.\r\n\r\n    Sam Walter Foss was born in Canadia, N.H., June 19, 1858,\r\n    graduated at Brown University in 1882 and served on the\r\n    editorial staff of various papers. In 1895 he left that of\r\n    the _Boston Globe_ and from 1898 to his death, Feb. 26,\r\n    1911, he was librarian of the Somerville, Mass., Public\r\n    Library. He published several volumes of popular verse.\r\n\r\n\r\nA library has no especial reason for self-felicitation simply because it\r\ndistributes a large number of books. In fact, it is possible for it to\r\ngive out a very large number of books and do more harm than good. The\r\ntest question to ask is: Is it grinding out a product of enlightened and\r\nsymmetrical men and women? Is it transforming the community into\r\nintellectual, thoughtful, better equipped, more roundly developed\r\ncitizens? Is it making life any ampler, is it making men any manlier, is\r\nit making the world any better? If there is any library that cannot\r\nanswer these questions affirmatively, its librarians are doddering their\r\nlives away in useless activity, and receiving a salary without rendering\r\nany real service in return. The activities of such a library are useless\r\ncontortions, and the taxpayers have a right to protest its further\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWhat can a librarian do to make his library an inspirational force? In\r\nthe first place he must be as accessible as a turnpike road. It seems to\r\nme that he can do more good by talking to people than in any other way.\r\nTo do this, of course, it is a prerequisite that he should know\r\nsomething. I have no faith in the miserable heresy that a librarian who\r\nreads is lost. A librarian who does not read would better not be found\r\nin the first place. A librarian who does not read is simply a stable\r\nkeeper for books. He may see to it that they are well blanketed,\r\ngroomed, and put in the proper stalls, and that the various implements\r\nabout his stable are kept in good order; but such a librarian will never\r\nbe mistaken for an intellectual giant in his community. Let him know the\r\nbooks he handles so that he can talk with schoolgirls about Sophie May\r\nand Virginia Townsend, and with boys about Henty and Brooks and Knox and\r\nButterworth. Let him be able to discuss Herbert Spencer and David Harum\r\nwith equal zest, and know something about Kant and a good deal about\r\nKipling, and venerate Marcus Aurelius, and not despise Mark Twain. His\r\nmind should be a live coal in its love for books, and then nestle up to\r\nother minds and let them get ignited also.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that a librarian hasn't the time for such extensive\r\nreading. Did you ever know a boy who couldn't find time to play? One\r\nalways finds time to do the thing he loves to do; and a man who has a\r\ngenuine love for reading will find time for it even in a library.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest longings that any soul can have is a longing for\r\nsome one to talk with who is interested in identical subjects.\r\n\r\nA librarian, through personal intercourse, can become a powerfully\r\neducative influence in his community, and start intellectual impulses\r\nthat will not subside during his lifetime, but go on widening and\r\nblessing indefinitely. Let him become the father confessor of minds in\r\nhis town or city; the priest of the intellect, to whom all men shall\r\nbring all their mental problems, all their dubious enigmas of the brain.\r\nHe will not be able to solve all their puzzles or untie all their knots;\r\nbut perhaps he will be able to hold the candle for a little while, while\r\nthey struggle with the knots themselves. Let him always hold the candle,\r\nand talk pleasantly while he is holding it.\r\n\r\nThis matter of being pleasant in a library is really the first and\r\ngreat commandment. There should be an air of welcome inside that is\r\npleasanter than the sunshine outdoors. The deathlike stillness and\r\ntomblike hush, the sepulchral gloom, the graveyard silence that\r\nsometimes prevails in libraries, should not be encouraged. Make people\r\nfeel at home. The library here can learn a good lesson from the barroom.\r\nThere are no signs up in a barroom intimating that loud talking is not\r\nallowed, nobody walks on tiptoes, everybody is welcomed heartily and\r\nencouraged to stay, and men find a sympathetic friendliness there who\r\nfind it nowhere else. John Wesley said we should not allow the devil to\r\nmonopolize all the good tunes. The library should not allow the barroom\r\nto monopolize all the spirit of human friendliness and good cheer. I am\r\nsincerely glad that the old type of librarian is passing out--a man so\r\ndignified that children were afraid of him, whose face was so long that\r\nhis chin dragged on the floor. We want human men with blood in them in a\r\nlibrary; men who like men and love children; men who can make themselves\r\nagreeable to men, women, children, and dogs. Let us make life as\r\npleasant in a library as a mother's twilight hour with her children, and\r\nwe shall raise up great families for the afterdays, who shall look back\r\nupon us as their intellectual parents, and rise up after we are gone and\r\ncall our memories blessed.\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of books--books that give pleasure, books that\r\ngive information, and books that give inspiration. The first class has\r\nits thousands of readers, the second its hundreds, and the third its\r\ntens. It is a good thing to read books for pleasure--it is the most\r\ninnocent kind of drunkenness I know about; but that reading books merely\r\nfor pleasure may develop into a kind of intellectual dissipation is\r\nsomething that we know from experience; for who is there of us who has\r\nnot sinned? But reading books merely for pleasure is something we should\r\noutgrow in childhood, just as we do stilts and marbles and the game of\r\ntag. It is a better thing to read books for information. It is one of\r\nthe healthiest joys of the normal mind to be forever learning something;\r\nforever learning and forever coming to the knowledge of the truth. It is\r\nthe best thing, however, to read books for inspiration. And this is a\r\nclass of readers into which many of the frequenters of the public\r\nlibraries never graduate. Ah! the pity of it! Books that lift us out of\r\nourselves and the fogs and fumes and dust of our little treadmill\r\nroutines into the ampler ether of loftier altitudes--into the grandeurs\r\nof life! Emerson and Shakespeare and Wordsworth and Whitman--do men love\r\nsuch as these and remain little men? No, this is the meat from which\r\ngiants are grown; here is the food for souls. Now it seems to me it is\r\nthe duty of the good librarian, one who believes in the august nature of\r\nhis profession, to lead up his readers by all devices within his power,\r\nby imperceptible gradations, through the books that please and the books\r\nthat inform, to the books that inspire. And the librarian who drops a\r\nboy before he learns to love John Milton has only brought him half his\r\njourney, and has dropped him before he has reached the destination to\r\nwhich his fare was paid.\r\n\r\nWhy do not people read the best books? One reason is they never see\r\nthem. It is a librarian's business to keep them in sight, his next\r\nbusiness is to read them himself, and his next business is to talk about\r\nthem whenever he can get an audience of fifty, or five, or one; to write\r\nabout them in his monthly bulletins and let every man know he can get\r\nthem, and welcome, by stretching out his hand. We all know how Tom\r\nSawyer got his fence painted. He made all the boys in his neighborhood\r\nbelieve that fence painting was great fun. The librarian should make all\r\nthe boys in his neighborhood believe that reading the best books is\r\ngenuine pleasure. They can be brought to an appreciation of this\r\npleasure as one is brought to the height of a tableland of a great\r\ncontinent, by gradations so gradual that they seem to be walking on a\r\nflat surface.\r\n\r\nI believe that the great destiny of the public library is as yet but\r\nfaintly foreseen. The plain truth is that the library has not tried yet\r\nto do its best. It has opened it doors and let people come in, if they\r\nso desire, or if they happen to be passing that way. No successful\r\nauctioneer does business according to any such method. On the contrary\r\nhe lifts up his voice to all it may concern, and to all that do not care\r\nthat there are about to be great bargains at his place. The business man\r\nwho opens his store and then forever holds his peace has his solitude\r\nvery infrequently interrupted by customers. The church that has no\r\nmissionary spirit is as tepid as the old church of Laodicea. The\r\nschoolmaster whose pupils absent themselves too frequently collects his\r\ndaily audience, even if he has to call in the services of the truant\r\nofficer. All this is written with something of the same wisdom. I do not\r\nbelieve it should always wait for people to come to it; it should go to\r\nthe people. Every family in every city or town where there is a library\r\nshould be offered a library card, or as many cards as it has adult\r\nmembers. Sometimes there is so much red tape prerequisite to obtaining a\r\nlibrary card that a bashful man does not dare to make the attempt. Let\r\nus not shut the people off from the books that they have paid for by a\r\nbarbed wire fence of red tape. Let every man or woman, yes, or child,\r\ntoo, that is old enough, be personally canvassed and offered a library\r\ncard. Then sell him a catalog at cost price, or better still, at less\r\nthan cost, and tell him how to use it. Ah, but our trustees will say,\r\nthis will cost something. Yes, it will cost something, but it will be a\r\ntremendously profitable investment, and pay immense dividends later on\r\nin a more intelligent citizenship and wiser and happier men.\r\n\r\nFrom all this I wish it might be inferred that no librarian can be too\r\ngreat for his position. It is not easy for him to have too much\r\nknowledge, too much tact, too much consecration to his work, too exalted\r\nan estimate of his possibilities. He should not have a mind with a\r\nflange on it, so that it forever runs on the small rail along the dusty\r\nroadbeds of routine. Let him originate, let him innovate, let him blaze\r\nhis path with the pioneers--let him think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\n    Part of an address by President Angell of the University of\r\n    Michigan--educator, diplomat and statesman--at the\r\n    dedication of the Ryerson Library Building in Grand Rapids,\r\n    Mich., Oct. 8, 1904. To advise a reader, Pres. Angell\r\n    thinks, one must know something of his personal aptitudes.\r\n    General advice about \"good reading\" is seldom of great\r\n    service. A modern note by a great man.\r\n\r\n    James Burrill Angell was born in Scituate, R.I., Jan. 7,\r\n    1829, graduated at Brown University, and after studying\r\n    abroad, became eminent as an educator, holding first a\r\n    professorship in his alma mater and then serving\r\n    successively as president of the Universities of Vermont and\r\n    Michigan. He was U.S. minister to China in 1880-81 and\r\n    served on important international commissions. His works on\r\n    international law and on education are standard. He died on\r\n    April 1, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that your benefactor has so nobly done his part, it remains for the\r\ncity to see that the library is maintained and managed in an effective\r\nmanner. It would not only be an act of ingratitude, but it would be a\r\nmockery, if in such an edifice as this we should not find a good and\r\ngrowing and well administered library. There is no more important\r\ncommission in your city than the commission charged with the care of\r\nyour library. Let us hope that they will always be chosen with special\r\nregard to their fitness for their official duty and without regard to\r\ntheir party affiliations.\r\n\r\nEspecially is wisdom needed in the selection of your books. It is not\r\nso difficult to choose books for the cultivated and scholarly readers.\r\nBut in a city library you must provide for all your population.\r\nParticular care should be had to procure books attractive and useful to\r\nyour artisans and mechanics and common laborers. They should be led to\r\nfeel that this is the place where they can most profitably spend a spare\r\nhour and can find something to bring new brightness into their\r\nmonotonous lives. The efforts which you have already initiated to make\r\nthe library serviceable to the pupils in your schools must now be\r\nredoubled. The teachers and the library authorities must always contrive\r\nto cooperate heartily. The multiplication of libraries in this country\r\nhas already elevated the work of the librarian to the dignity of a\r\ndistinct profession. And no profession promises to be more useful. In\r\naddition to the proper organization and care of the library, the\r\ninfluence which a competent librarian can wield in his guidance of the\r\nreading and studies of the young is seldom outweighed by that of the\r\nteacher or the preacher. In no manner can a generous appropriation of\r\nfunds for the support of a library be more wisely expended than in\r\nsecuring a competent librarian.\r\n\r\nJudging by my own experience and by my observation of others, I doubt\r\nwhether the guide books which have been written to tell one what works\r\nto read have been of great service. The simple reason why they are not\r\nvery helpful is that to advise one what to read, you should know\r\nsomething of his aptitudes and taste and something of his plans of life.\r\nGeneral advice is a shot in the air. It may hit nothing.\r\n\r\nBut a competent person may give helpful counsels to the young\r\nconcerning useful methods of reading whatever one does read, and may\r\nindeed specify what are some of the best books on certain topics. A good\r\nlibrarian, if leisure enough is left him, may attract and help willing\r\nauditors by occasional lectures or informal talks on how to read in a\r\nlibrary. But personal suggestions, to meet particular needs, are the\r\nmost fruitful of good. And just here the school teachers, if competent\r\nto advise, can be of the utmost service. In no way can the library be\r\nmade so valuable as by the hearty and systematic co-operation of the\r\nlibrarian and the teachers. It would be very useful if they could from\r\ntime to time meet to confer upon the best methods of securing harmonious\r\naction. For it is the generation now coming on to the stage who are\r\nchiefly to profit by the use of this library. It is through them that\r\nthe city is to receive its chief benefit. To incite them to read, to\r\ntrain them to right habits of reading, to inspire them with high ideals\r\nof what one should seek and love in reading, should be the aspiration of\r\nparents and teachers, if this library is to yield its largest harvest of\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nLike all good things, this library may to some persons bring no good; it\r\nmay even be made an instrument of harm. It may bring no good, because it\r\nmay be utterly neglected. No doubt there are many families who have\r\nnever drawn a book from its shelves. It may bring no good, it may even\r\ncause intellectual, not to say moral injury, if it is misused. It is\r\npossible to choose from any great library such passages from works and\r\nto peruse them in such a spirit as to gratify and stimulate prurient\r\ndesires, or if one does not descend to so unworthy and shameful an act,\r\none may read in such a manner as to be guilty of intellectual\r\ndissipation. What we may call the desultory readers are exposed to this\r\ndanger. They pick up whatever book or magazine comes first to hand,\r\nprovided they are sure that it makes no tax upon their mental powers.\r\nThey spend their time dawdling over a chapter of this book, then over a\r\nchapter of that, as men of the town now join this gay companion for an\r\nhour and then another for the next hour for frivolous talk and\r\nprofitless gossip, and so wander aimless through the day without any\r\nfruitage to show for their time. They lose the power, if they ever had\r\nit, of consecutive study and thought and discourse on any theme\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to intimate that we should never come to this library to\r\nread for pleasure and entertainment. One of the great and proper uses of\r\nbooks is to refresh and amuse us in our hours of weariness and\r\ndepression. Like the society of our choicest friends, they may wisely be\r\nsought for the sole purpose of diverting our minds from the flood of\r\ncares and troubles which come in upon all of us. The library may well be\r\n\r\n    \"The world's sweet inn from care and wearisome turmoil.\"\r\n\r\nOr in our happy and merry moods we may seek congenial company in the\r\ncreations of Cervantes and Moliere and Shakespeare and Dickens and Mark\r\nTwain. Reading for pastime is a commendable occupation, if wisely\r\nfollowed. Lowell in his paradoxical style tells us that what Dr. Johnson\r\ncalled browsing in a library is the only way in which time can be\r\nprofitably wasted. But to browse profitably one should have an appetite\r\nonly for what has some merit. I have known lads born with a literary\r\ninstinct as unerring as that of the bee for finding honey, to have the\r\nfree run of a large library and come out with a wonderful range of good\r\nlearning. Such instances show the unwisdom of having the same rules to\r\nguide every one in his reading. In such cases as those just cited, the\r\nexample and taste of the parents often determine the success of the\r\nexperiment. The books they talk about fondly at table and quote from\r\nfreely and appositely are likely to arrest the attention of the child.\r\nTherefore we may say that the home as truly as the school may largely\r\ndetermine what advantage shall be gained in this library. Parents who\r\nfor their children's sake are careful what guests they admit to their\r\nhouse and what companionships they counsel the children to form may well\r\nconsider what reading comes under their roof and what literary tastes\r\nthey encourage in their household.\r\n\r\nIn these days when reviews and magazines and school histories of\r\nliterature abound, there seems ground for one caution to youthful\r\nreaders. It is, not to be content with reading about great books and\r\ngreat men, but to study the works themselves of great men. Many of the\r\noutlines of English literature, for example, which pupils in school are\r\nrequired to study, contain dates and names and brief descriptions of\r\nmasterpieces, and from the nature of the case can contain little else.\r\nBut cramming the memory with these is not learning the literature.\r\nReading, mastering, and learning to appreciate and love the great works\r\nof a great author is better than to learn the dry facts in the lives of\r\na score of authors. So our magazines and reviews treat us to criticism\r\nsometimes wise, sometimes unwise, of many authors. But all these are of\r\nlittle value until the works themselves of the authors have been\r\nstudied. With the works the biographies of the authors should be read in\r\norder to appreciate the conditions under which the works were produced.\r\nBut far better is it to gain a thorough acquaintance with one great\r\nwriter's life and works than to learn a few fragmentary facts at second\r\nhand about the lives and writings of many.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult questions to settle in these days in the\r\nselection of books for a library or in directing the reading of the\r\nyoung is, how large shall be the proportion of fiction in a library or\r\nin the reading of any one. Just now we are flooded with fiction,\r\nstretching from the short story of the magazine to the two-volume novel.\r\nI observe that nearly two-thirds of the volumes drawn from this library\r\nin 1901-02 are classed under the two heads of juvenile fiction and\r\nfiction. And I suppose the experience of other popular libraries is\r\nsimilar to yours. This shows at least that there is a great craving for\r\nfiction. That craving a library like this must to a fair degree strive\r\nto meet. Nor need we regret that there is a strong desire for sterling\r\nworks of fiction. They stimulate and nourish the imagination. They give\r\nus vivid pictures of life. They portray for us the working of human\r\npassions. They give a reality to history. Sometimes they cultivate a\r\ntaste for reading in those who would otherwise be inclined to read\r\nlittle, and so lead them to other branches of literature. But, on the\r\nother hand, I think it must be confessed that a great deal of the\r\nfiction which is deluging the market is the veriest trash, or worse than\r\ntrash. Much of it is positively bad in its influence. It awakens morbid\r\npassions. It deals in most exaggerated representations of life. It is\r\nvicious in style.\r\n\r\nIt is a most delicate task for the authorities of a library like this to\r\ndraw the line between the works of fiction which should be and those\r\nwhich should not be found on its shelves. As to the individual reader,\r\nthe best we can do is to elevate his taste as rapidly as we can by\r\nplacing in his hands fiction attractive at once in its matter and in its\r\nstyle. We must hope that with the cultivation of taste to which our best\r\nschools aspire, we can rear a generation which will prefer the best\r\nthings in literature to the inferior. That is the reason why the\r\nteachers of languages and literature in our schools should be not mere\r\nlinguists, but persons of refined literary taste, who will imbue their\r\npupils with a love for the truest and highest in every literature which\r\nthey can read.\r\n\r\nI would like to commend to my young friends who desire to profit by\r\nthe use of this library the habit of reading with some system and of\r\nmaking brief notes upon the contents of the books they read. If, for\r\ninstance, you are studying the history of some period, ascertain what\r\nworks you need to study and finish such parts of them as concern your\r\ntheme. Do not feel obliged to read the whole of a large treatise, but\r\nselect such chapters as touch on the subject in hand, and omit the rest\r\nfor the time. Young students often get swamped and lose their way in\r\nSerbonian bogs of learning, when they need to explore only a simple and\r\nplain pathway to a specific destination. Have a purpose and a plan and\r\nadhere to it in spite of alluring temptations to turn aside into\r\nattractive fields that are remote from your subject. If in a note book\r\nyou will on finishing a work jot down the points of importance in the\r\nvolume and the references to the page or chapter, you will frequently\r\nfind it of the greatest service to run over these notes and refresh your\r\nmemory. If you are disposed to add some words of comment or criticism on\r\nthe book, that practice also will make you a more attractive reader, and\r\nwill make an interesting record for you to consult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY CENTER SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is the newest phase of library work and the most\r\n    convincing evidence of its socialization. There is little in\r\n    print about its early stages; its classics are still in the\r\n    making. We quote only three papers here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY AS A SOCIAL CENTRE\r\n\r\n    The opening address at the Red Wing meeting of the Minnesota\r\n    Library Association, Oct. 12, 1905, by Miss Countryman,\r\n    librarian of the Minneapolis Public Library. The \"public,\"\r\n    Miss Countryman thinks, \"is no indefinite, intangible\r\n    somebody; it is just 'we'\"--the statement of library\r\n    socialization in a nutshell.\r\n\r\n    Gratia Alta Countryman was born at Hastings, Minn., in\r\n    November, 1866, and graduated, with the B.S. degree, at the\r\n    University of Minnesota in 1889. In that same year she\r\n    entered the service of the Minneapolis Public Library, and\r\n    she was assistant librarian at the resignation of Dr. James\r\n    K. Hosmer in 1904, succeeding him as librarian.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring these latter days of enormous library activity, we have been\r\nconscientiously examining the functions of a library; we have been\r\ntrying all sorts of methods to popularize it, to advertise it. We have\r\nasked for and listened to the criticism of outsiders, and by the light\r\nthrown upon it through this prism have separated our work into its\r\nelemental parts and seen its various hues.\r\n\r\nWe used to erect a library as an altar to the gods of learning; now, to\r\nuse Mr. Dana's words, we erect it as an altar to the \"gods of good\r\nfellowship, joy and learning.\" So you see, our ideals are constantly\r\nrising, our horizons ever broadening, and our work continually\r\nincreasing, both in extent and in depth. We might well have considered\r\nour hands fairly full to have dealt alone with this god of learning, but\r\nwe find ourselves embracing the opportunity for additional service to\r\nthe gods of good fellowship and joy.\r\n\r\nIt might do us good to consider tonight what we are doing for the cause\r\nof learning, what the library has done to increase serious reading and\r\nstudy, and how it may further the educational work of the world. This\r\nquestion is ever present with us, and can stand any amount of\r\ndiscussion. But it is the gods of good fellowship and joy that we are\r\ndiscussing tonight, the library not as a center of learning but as a\r\nsocial center.\r\n\r\nWe are dealing with a small crowd of people whom we call \"our public.\"\r\nWho are the public? Why, you and I, and my family, and others just like\r\nus. They want just the same things that we do, and to be accommodated in\r\njust the same way that we do. The public is no indefinite, intangible\r\nsomebody, it is just \"we.\"\r\n\r\nWe talk about the people being hungry for books and information. Have\r\nyou found it so? Then why do we have free libraries and free schools?\r\nPeople are willing to sacrifice for something that they are very hungry\r\nfor. Do you hunger and thirst to read Homer and Shakespeare, and Emerson\r\nand Arnold, and good histories and literature? Do you, when you are\r\ntired after a day's work, take home a scientific work or a treatise on\r\ncivics? No, you are just a little sample of the public, and you think\r\nyou need to read a pleasant, entertaining, restful book. You aren't\r\nhungry for information, and, as a matter of fact, the person who\r\ndelights in study and has a fine taste for the best in literature has\r\none of the \"gifts extremely rare.\" Most of us are practical, everyday,\r\nworking people, with a very limited time for reading, and this public\r\nwhom we serve is just like us. A few of them will love to read the best,\r\nmany of them will want information at intervals, a large proportion want\r\nrecreative reading, and the vast majority use the library not at all.\r\nNow the former, who want and love the library, you need not be troubled\r\nabout. They will naturally come to the library, and you will find\r\npleasure in serving them. But these latter classes who either come for\r\npleasure or come not at all must be drawn and held through the social\r\ninstincts, and through their desire for pleasure. Every human being must\r\nhave social life. We seek company and companionship with whom we can\r\nfind mutual pleasure. We may find it in friendly gatherings, social\r\nclubs, or music or conversation or games, but social pleasure of some\r\nsort is sought by all of us, great and small, in town and country alike.\r\nIn the city there is usually plenty of opportunity--I might almost say\r\nthat there is a surfeit--and one must pick and choose. But in the towns\r\nand villages it is often different; good amusement and profitable\r\npleasures are not always to be had, and being social beings, the social\r\ncraving is satisfied with whatever means may be at hand. Young people\r\nespecially can not isolate themselves, or live unto themselves. Just\r\nwhere is the library going to stand in this matter? Is there anything\r\nwhich we can do to satisfy these natural desires and to enter more\r\nvitally into the lives of the people? This is the question to take home\r\nand think about.\r\n\r\nAs individuals, we are coming to have an enormous interest in other\r\nhuman lives, there is a sense of social obligation upon us; we have come\r\nto know that personal righteousness is not all that is required of us,\r\nbut that we must help to realize the social righteousness. The library\r\nhas the duty of being all things to all men. It is no longer simply a\r\nrepository of books, it is exactly what Mr. Carnegie calls it, the\r\ncradle of democracy, filled with the democratic spirit, and it\r\nendeavors, as far as circumstances permit, to minister to all the needs\r\nof the community in which it dwells. The library stands for progress,\r\nthe progress of its town, and this does not mean increasing the material\r\nprosperity of the people, though that may follow, but it chiefly means\r\nthe raising of the moral, social and intellectual standards of all its\r\npeople, and helping men and women to be more effective in every way. The\r\nlibrary does not exist for one side only of the life of the people, but\r\nfor every side, and if it fails to provide for those who seek amusement,\r\nit shirks a duty and renounces a privilege. The sooner we unveil the\r\n\"gods of joy and good fellowship\" in our library the better; the sooner\r\nwe make the library a centre for all the activities among us that make\r\nfor social efficiency the better.\r\n\r\nOf course there are natural limitations to the kind of work which a\r\nlibrary can do, and in helping to further the spirit of good fellowship\r\nand to furnish pleasure, we must keep within such limits as are\r\nconsistent with the spirit of a library. The library can appeal to\r\npeople in other ways than by books alone, as we shall consider later,\r\nyet as books are our chief tools, it is natural to think first of giving\r\npleasure by that method. One of our chiefest ways of late years has been\r\nthrough the children's room. The children get book instruction and\r\nsupplementary reading and enforced book interests, all of which are\r\nneeded for their development, in the schoolroom. But in the children's\r\nroom at the library furnished especially for them, with low tables,\r\npicture books and low shelves containing fairy stories and all their\r\nfavorite authors, they settle down to satisfy their own especial\r\nindividual tastes. Then there is the story hour, of which we shall hear\r\nto-morrow. Many of the children have never learned the pleasure of\r\nreading. They do not belong to cultured homes and the presence of books.\r\nMany of them never heard a Mother Goose jingle or a nonsense verse, and\r\na book is an unlearned delight. But what child, even of this kind, does\r\nnot love to hear stories, and listening breathlessly, would not come\r\nagain and again. Somehow it seems as if we could not discharge our\r\nsocial obligation until we had gone into the by-ways and hedges and\r\ngathered in these scraps of society, and taught them the pleasures of a\r\nbook. The children, once acquainted with the library, will always count\r\nit among their friends, and it will forever remain a social centre to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe grown ups are not so different from the children; we, too, like a\r\nstory, and we, too, want to read the things that cheer and entertain us.\r\nWe agreed a moment ago that we, as well as our public, were liable to\r\nleave the serious books for the infrequent study hour and to spend our\r\nleisure evenings with the fascinating novel. Well, I do not know of any\r\nbetter way to give amusement and pleasure than to furnish the people\r\nwith the books they want, in which they can be interested and absorbed.\r\nThe \"cares that infest the day\" will fold their wings better under the\r\nspell of a good story than any other way. I think we need not be\r\nfrightened when libraries are accused of being only fiction\r\ndistributors, for it is a library's function to amuse as well as to\r\ninstruct, and if people will seek amusement through the library, so much\r\nthe better for the people. It is natural that the people should feel a\r\ncuriosity about the newest book and want to read what other people are\r\ntalking about. This adds also to pleasant social intercourse, and gives\r\npeople a common subject of conversation. Fiction is bound to be more and\r\nmore an interpretation of life by which we see the motives and the\r\ncurrents in other souls. We need not be afraid to supply good, wholesome\r\nfiction and to use it in establishing social relations with our people,\r\nso that the adults as well as the children shall feel a real pleasure in\r\ncoming to the library.\r\n\r\nMany of our libraries are now housed in beautiful buildings, in which\r\ncase, the building as well as the books becomes a means of social\r\ninfluence. If there is need of a home for social intercourse and\r\namusement, the library may legitimately attempt to furnish such a home\r\nwithin its walls. If there are social or study clubs, organized labor\r\nguilds or missionary societies, or any other organizations, encourage\r\nthem to meet at the library, find out what they need, let them find out\r\nthat the library is their cooperative partner. And so with the schools\r\nand industries, of which I have not time to speak. The whole building at\r\nall times should be managed in the broadest spirit of hospitality; the\r\natmosphere should be as gracious, kindly and sympathetic as one's own\r\nhome. Then do away with all unnecessary restrictions, take down all the\r\nbars, and try to put face to face our friends the books and our friends\r\nthe people. Introduce them cordially, then stand aside and let them make\r\neach other's blessed acquaintance.\r\n\r\nSome have tried smoking rooms, had boy's club rooms and games, and many\r\nhave tried simply to make the rooms homelike and cheery, and all of\r\ntheir experience is valuable to us.\r\n\r\nIt may be that no one of the plans used by other libraries may fit your\r\ncase, for it is not necessarily good for you because some one else has\r\nused it successfully. But with any plan do not expect immediate results,\r\nfor almost everything that succeeds permanently has a slow, gradual\r\ndevelopment; that which flashes up quickly usually dies down suddenly.\r\nBe willing to work out a good plan if you have one, and be willing to\r\nstudy your people and all of their interests before you shape your\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY AND THE SOCIAL CENTRE\r\n\r\n    By a great expert in library field-work as done by one of\r\n    our most active library commissions. Miss Lutie E. Stearns,\r\n    of whom a sketch will be found in Vol. I. of this series, is\r\n    now a lecturer at large, but at the writing of this paper,\r\n    which is reprinted from _The Wisconsin Library Bulletin_ for\r\n    May, 1911, she was in the service of the Library Commission\r\n    of that state.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is coming to be an axiom in library economy that \"the worth of a book\r\nis in its use.\" For this reason, librarians everywhere are devoting\r\nthemselves to what is called \"library extension\" through the building of\r\nbranches, and the establishment of deposit stations in schools,\r\nfactories, stores, club-houses, police stations, fire-engine houses,\r\netc. Experience has shown that where no efforts are made along the line\r\nof library extension only 10 per cent. or at the most 20 per cent. of\r\nthe people are reached in any given community. If we wish to have\r\nwholesome literature become \"the burden of the common thought\" we must\r\nplace good books within easy reach of all. Libraries should be quick to\r\nrealize that the social centre offers a most excellent opportunity to\r\nreach those that might not otherwise take the time to avail themselves\r\nof library privileges. The free public library should therefore be made\r\nan important part of social centre work through active and sympathetic\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\nWhere libraries can afford proper facilities, there is no reason why\r\nthe library building should not serve as the social centre for the\r\ncommunity, as this institution differs from the schoolhouse, in cities\r\nwhere parochial schools exist, in being neutral on the religious\r\nquestion and therefore acceptable to all denominations. Wherever the\r\nsocial centre may be, whether in library building or schoolhouse, strong\r\nemphasis should be placed on the use of books. A special librarian, of\r\npeculiar fitness, should be appointed either by the library or the\r\nsocial centre authorities. This man or woman should be earnestly\r\naltruistic in his or her desire to fit the right book to the right\r\nperson at the right time. It may be that this will mean the issuance of\r\na primer in English to an adult Slav who has recently arrived in this\r\ncountry, or it may be the loan of a novel more wholesome in tone though\r\njust as sentimental as one by Bertha M. Clay, the author requested.\r\nAgain, the leader of the boy gang may be persuaded to give up the\r\nreading of the lurid \"nickel library\" in favor of Custer and Grinnell's\r\ntruthful Indian experiences. Such selection involves a wide range of\r\nbooks in the social centre library, from well-bound and attractive\r\neditions of the classics down to the latest, most wholesome novel. The\r\nboys that frequent the gymnasium may be won by Barbour's latest football\r\nstory. The raffia worker should find interest in Priestman's\r\nHandicrafts. An up-to-date and authoritative encyclopedia, a good\r\ndictionary, a World almanac, and other popular reference books should be\r\nsupplied and instruction given in their use. Debating material should be\r\nsought and every inducement offered for individual research.\r\n\r\nThose who cannot afford to take correspondence courses in the various\r\ntrades and crafts should find material in the social centre library for\r\nself-education. James Russell Lowell has said that the best part of\r\nevery man's education is that which he gives himself, and it is for this\r\nthat the library at the social centre should furnish the opportunity and\r\nthe means. Again, there should be books of a cheerful sort for tired\r\nworkers so that, as in William Morris's Earthly Paradise, they may\r\n\r\n    \"Forget six counties overhung with smoke,\r\n    Forget the snorting steam and piston stroke.\"\r\n\r\nWholesome novels should be found in plenty for both men and women,\r\ntogether with books that inspire with courage for life's daily round,\r\nsuch as Hugh Black's Work, Gannett's Blessed be drudgery, Hyde's Art of\r\noptimism, Emerson's Character and heroism, and Wagner's Courage. Each\r\nbook in the library's collection should serve one or all three\r\npurposes--to inform, to inspire, or to refresh.\r\n\r\nThe rules for the issuance of books should be made as simple as\r\npossible. Borrowers should not be restricted to one book at a time if\r\nmore can be used; that is, a novel should be loaned with a book for\r\nstudy. No guarantee should be required except the borrower's signature.\r\n\r\nA reading room should be made an attractive feature in connection with\r\nthe issuance of books. The library and reading room should be well\r\nlighted and heated, and order and quiet should be insisted upon. The\r\nreading table should be supplied with an abundance of the best of the\r\npopular magazines. The Technical World, Popular mechanics, Amateur work,\r\nand the Scientific American, will be found to be strong magnets for\r\nattracting the interest of the boys and young men. The World's work,\r\nCollier's weekly, and the American magazine, are the three great\r\nexponents of optimism in our national life which should find a place on\r\nthe reading room tables, as should McClure's, Everybody's, Hampton's,\r\nScribner's, Harper's, Century, and the Atlantic. In the small towns the\r\nlocal paper and one or two of the near-by metropolitan dailies should\r\nalso be taken.\r\n\r\nAttractive libraries and reading rooms make less attractive the\r\nseductions of other places. George Eliot said long ago, \"Important as it\r\nis to direct the industries of men, it is not so important as to wisely\r\ndirect their leisure.\" It is indeed true, as a critic of our national\r\nlife has said, that \"The use of a nation's leisure is the test of its\r\ncivilization.\" To win people to a love of good literature, to bring back\r\nthe old days of reading and meditation, are two of the great problems\r\nthat confront the present-day librarian. In the words of one earnest\r\nlibrary worker, \"The modern library movement is a movement to increase\r\nby every possible means the accessibility of books, to stimulate their\r\nreading and to create a demand for the best. Its motive is helpfulness;\r\nits scope, instruction and recreation; its purpose, the enlightenment of\r\nall; its aspiration, still greater usefulness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE NEIGHBORS MEET\r\n\r\n    Extracts from a special report on the social work of the St.\r\n    Louis Public Library made in 1917 by Margery Quigley, then\r\n    librarian of its Divoll Branch.\r\n\r\n    Margery Closey Quigley was born in Los Angeles, Cal., Sept.\r\n    16, 1886, and graduated from Vassar College. She entered the\r\n    service of the St. Louis Public Library in February, 1909,\r\n    studied at the New York State Library School in 1914-15, and\r\n    in August, 1918, became librarian of the Free Library in\r\n    Endicott, N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experience of the St. Louis Public Library goes to prove that no\r\nmatter what the neighborhood may be, and however well-supplied it\r\nalready is with meeting places, there is always room for the library\r\nauditorium and club rooms without subtracting in any way from the\r\nbusiness of the other agencies. In fact, they seem to increase each\r\nother's use.\r\n\r\nOf our six branch buildings, one is located in the heart of the older\r\nghetto, one in Carondelet, two in purely residential neighborhoods, one\r\nat the Soulard civic center, where nine or ten European languages are\r\nrepresented, and the sixth in the older German section of the north\r\nside, near the river.\r\n\r\nAbout each branch is the full quota of meeting places required by any\r\ngiven neighborhood--moving-picture houses, community halls to let for\r\ndances and entertainments, churches, saloons, Turnvereins, settlements,\r\nclub houses, running the gamut from \"lid clubs\" to the Artists' Guild,\r\nMasonic temples and public schools, which are now managed on the\r\ncommunity-center plan. Several of the branches have all these within a\r\nradius of five or six blocks, and still they must show the\r\n\"standing-room-only\" sign to many of the clubs that apply for the use of\r\nthe library halls.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable feature of this wider use of the library is that in\r\nspite of the increase of meetings, there has been no spirit of\r\ncompetition. Between the community halls and the library, for example,\r\nthere has been no rivalry for statistics of use. Cabanne branch, in the\r\nheart of perfectly equipped institutions which foster all sorts of\r\nclubs, shows more than 52 meetings a month during the last nine months,\r\nwhile our report of 1907 said of this branch: \"There has been an average\r\nof nearly six meetings a month in the building.\"\r\n\r\nNeighborhood clubs meet in the halls which best suit their purposes, and\r\nno agency seeks to move any one of them to a different roof. In the\r\nCrunden Branch neighborhood, the Socialists meet in a synagogue and a\r\nYiddish church meets in the library.\r\n\r\nThe city recreation department reports that the library's work and the\r\ndepartment's community work at the Patrick Henry School and on the\r\nplaygrounds, far from duplicating one another are supplementary.\r\n\r\nIn giving the free use of its meeting-rooms to any reputable group of\r\npersons, the St. Louis Public Library acts upon two principles which it\r\ncannot emphasize strongly enough. They are the same on which it buys its\r\nbooks; first, that the library stands for no propaganda but seeks to\r\nhouse all opinions, and second, that it makes no obvious attempt to\r\nreform or \"uplift.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the books it buys must meet a certain standard in style and\r\ncontent, the day is past when library assistants seek to force down\r\nreaders' throats books which \"will be good\" for them. In the same way,\r\nthe meeting which it shelters must meet the standards of the community;\r\nbut the Library has ceased to initiate or direct clubs and meetings,\r\ncultural or otherwise.\r\n\r\nCommunity work can be successful only when it embodies the spontaneous\r\nexpression of the neighborhood's own demand, whether it is from\r\nchildren, or women, or men. A chain of suffrage groups was successful,\r\nif numbers were an indication, in one neighborhood and a failure in\r\nanother--from the same cause. In a neighborhood of illiterate foreign\r\nwomen with large families, one suffragist lecturer on the common law of\r\nEngland was greeted by an audience consisting of one deaf old lady and\r\nfifty Jewish children under twelve, who had heard that candy was to be\r\ngiven away.\r\n\r\nMany of the meetings that wither and die are conceived in the finest\r\nspirit of service. If they aim to interest the whole neighborhood,\r\nirrespective of cliques and prejudices, they almost always fail--if, as\r\nwe Americans are supposed to do, we figure failure and success in terms\r\nof quantity. Utopian schemes cannot long survive to-day, housed or not\r\nin the scholarly and friendly surroundings of the library. A united\r\nUkraine cannot absorb the attention of its supporters half as\r\ncontinuously as the possibility of a new job in Ford's factory, and a\r\n\"decent dancing club\" cannot always endure in the face of profits to be\r\nmade from a river excursion.\r\n\r\nProbably of all municipal institutions, the library, while maintaining\r\nits dignified and quiet atmosphere, may become the least formal and most\r\nneighborly. It is a library truism that a librarian can tell from\r\nrepeated experiences just when a borrower is calling at the library to\r\nannounce her engagement or to proclaim that his new job has been\r\nsecured. Countless other bits of everyday news are exchanged over the\r\ndesk with real profit to the library and to the visitor. We feel in St.\r\nLouis that the so-called wider use of the plant is only a tangible\r\nexpression of this same friendly relationship, justified on the one hand\r\nby its economy and on the other, and to a far larger extent, by its\r\ncontribution to the community's legitimate social life.\r\n\r\nVery fortunately for the tax-payer, and for the average reader, the\r\npublic library does not look upon its branches as intellectual clinics\r\nfor the poor. Like the public schools, its problem is to serve \"all the\r\nchildren of all the people,\" and consequently in localities other than\r\nthose where foreigners live, the same sort of branch building is\r\nerected, with an auditorium open under the same regulations and used to\r\nmeet the needs of the particular neighborhood. The so-called \"middle\r\nclass\" has as fair a chance and as \"good a time\" in the library\r\nauditoriums as the foreign poor.\r\n\r\nWhen there are public meetings at the Carondelet library, speakers from\r\nother parts of the city invariably come late. They begin their addresses\r\nwith long apologies, saying that they have never been in the\r\nneighborhood before, and did not know where to find the library. They\r\nalways seem amazed at the size and beauty of the building, and comment\r\nparticularly on the pleasant club-rooms. One West End woman could not\r\nsay enough in praise of everything, repeating continually, \"and all this\r\ndown here!\"\r\n\r\nPractically this same comment is made again and again in the main\r\nlibrary, and in the other branches throughout the city. \"All this down\r\nhere,\" is equally true of seven auditoriums, each with a seating\r\ncapacity of 200, and of club rooms and offices to the number of fifteen.\r\nIn these halls were held, during the past year, practically as large a\r\nnumber of meetings as our equipment will permit. Omitting the meetings\r\nat Crunden and Soulard, practically all are held by the average sort of\r\nperson--average financially, socially and intellectually. The very\r\nabsence of the feeling that the club must make money, or must at least\r\npay expenses, probably accounts for the long list of small clubs and\r\nboard meetings which could almost as easily meet in the homes of\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThere are those who think that no one uses the auditoriums except very\r\nwealthy club-women, who set up Christmas trees for the poor. There is no\r\nmore truth in this than there would be in saying that all the\r\ninhabitants of St. Louis are either immigrants or millionaires. In the\r\ntotal number of meetings at the library, what Ida Tarbell has termed\r\n\"the shirtwaist crowd,\" is far in the majority. At practically every\r\nbranch, the Simon-pure woman's clubs form at least fifteen per cent. of\r\nall the meetings. At the Cabanne branch, about fifty per cent. are made\r\nup of women. The Barr Branch Mothers' Circle, The Queen Hedwig Polish\r\nWomen, and the Carondelet Women's Club are three names out of a list\r\nrunning almost to a hundred.\r\n\r\nThe masculine of \"shirtwaist crowd\" is \"shirtsleeves crowd\"; and this is\r\nequally well represented upon the schedules of all the branches. Miss\r\nGriggs, of the Barr Branch, writes:\r\n\r\n\"We seem now to have a number of new meetings that are held for\r\ndiscussion--but not many for study--casual, one-meeting-only affairs.\r\nFor instance, the Royal Arcanum met to discuss what could be done about\r\nthe increased rates. All the premiums were raised and those for older\r\nmen raised far out of reason, so all the older members had a meeting\r\ndown here, to discuss what action they could take. I am glad people come\r\ncasually that way--and feel that we are open for something beside the\r\nregular study meetings. They sit around very informally, smoke, come in\r\nand out down stairs and do not have any very formal session.\r\n\r\n\"In common with the other branches, Barr has had political meetings.\r\nSome have been held just before elections and have been quite warm. On\r\none occasion, the library was made a buzzing community center by a\r\nseries of bombs that were set off in the street. Other and quieter\r\nmeetings have been held by party committees, judges of elections and the\r\nlike. The State Socialist party has twice held its conventions here, and\r\neach time the session lasted for four days. The meetings were opened\r\nwith hymns, and the delegates had all-day sessions, from 9:00 a.m. to\r\n9:00 p.m. I think most of the partisan leaders feel that they are a\r\nlittle handicapped when they meet in the library--still, they come back\r\noccasionally.\r\n\r\n\"There are coming to be more purely social meetings of younger grade\r\npupils. In some cases, these children are not organized, but merely\r\nclaim to be in order to get the halls. In other cases, relatives who\r\ncome with them to make application are frank to confess that they want\r\nthe hall to avoid inconvenience at home, especially the protracted\r\nhouse-cleanings which are the pre-requisite at most home parties. One\r\nmother said that the last time there was a birthday party in her house,\r\nthe man who lived upstairs, after rapping repeatedly on the floor to\r\nstop the children's noise, came down and said, that 'the party would\r\nsimply have to bust up.' She wanted to hold this party in the library,\r\nbecause her husband had such a bad temper, that she was sure he would\r\nmurder the man if such a thing happened again, and, of course, it\r\n_would_ happen again, for no children's party would ever be quiet enough\r\nto suit the man upstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Adult clubs as a whole ask very little of us beyond the occasional use\r\nof the telephone, and they often come and go without our being conscious\r\nof them. This is especially true of day-time meetings. It must be\r\nadmitted, that in addition to those who are very friendly and those who\r\ndo not make either criticism or appreciation articulate, there are some\r\nwho break the monotony of the librarian's existence by thinking 'they\r\nowns the place,' to quote the janitor. The younger social meetings need\r\nconsiderable attention, too. They overflow upstairs, are always noisy\r\nand sometimes not as agreeable as they should be. A member of a new club\r\nof girls said, 'I guess we rented this building for the evening--we can\r\nmake as much noise as we please.'\"\r\n\r\nWithin certain limits, particularly the powder-cans and lead pencils of\r\nthe staff, we want the clubs to think that they do own the place. The\r\nsurest proof that the St. Louis plan works, is to have the scions of our\r\ndemocracy feel that they are getting their money's worth from the\r\ninstitution that their taxes support.\r\n\r\nA group of young socialists was formed too late in the season to secure\r\na regular meeting night. They finally decided that they would have to be\r\nsatisfied with meeting, for the winter, at K----'s--a delicatessen store\r\na few blocks away. K----'s has an advertisement every week in the Jewish\r\nRecord, inviting men to come and read the papers there and make use of\r\nthe free meeting-room. Like all Jewish delicatessens, this shop contains\r\neverything that any patron is willing to buy, and in addition,\r\nelaborates the coffee-house idea into any shape that circumstances may\r\nsuggest. When the young men said individually on later occasions that\r\nthey were not contented at the delicatessen, they always added, \"It's\r\nbecause we feel so at home at the library; because we've always gotten\r\nbooks out there.\" The next winter their application was handed in\r\nseveral months in advance.\r\n\r\nIn a neighborhood where conditions are the exact antithesis of\r\nCrunden's, the same feeling exists. Miss Pretlow was talking one evening\r\nto a young man who belonged to a group giving a dancing party at Cabanne\r\nLibrary. She said that she could not but remark how well-dressed and\r\nwell bred and altogether prosperous the dancers were. They very\r\nevidently could have met in any one of a number of large homes or could\r\nhave paid for one of the best halls in the city; so she said to the\r\nyoung man, \"How is it you do not rent Blank's Hall, but use the Library\r\ninstead? I know it can't be the difference in cost that influences you.\"\r\nThe young man answered in very evident astonishment: \"Why, we like this\r\nplace; we all grew up in this Library.\"\r\n\r\nWhen adolescents of both sexes meet together, their meetings are purely\r\nfor a good time. Their behavior is extremely immature from the social\r\nside; either very wooden or very uncontrolled. This is the period when\r\nthe librarian must insist upon strict chaperonage, and it is also the\r\nperiod when resentment of discipline, or even of suggestion, runs high.\r\nThey would no more follow the advice of the Librarian in the matter of\r\ninvitations, introduction of wall-flowers and how a dance is to be \"run\r\noff\" generally, than they would copy her taste in dress, which they\r\ninvariably consider very \"old-maidy.\" The standards to which social\r\nclubs adhere rigidly are those observed in places of commercialized\r\namusement. One group of boys met to teach each other dancing, where the\r\ngirls would not see them. As it was a case of the blind leading the\r\nblind, a volunteer who had been teaching folk-dancing to the girls all\r\nwinter, offered her services. After one trial she was _persona non\r\ngrata_, because she wouldn't let them \"rag.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the dances are quite grim. One will not hear a note of laughter\r\nall the evening. Five or six girls will often come together. Those who\r\nknow boys will dance with them, and between dances will not make the\r\nslightest effort to introduce their friends to possible partners. The\r\nfriends, instead of resenting this inactivity, often sit all the evening\r\non the side lines watching and chewing gum, apparently perfectly\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite pole is the wild desire for \"rough house.\" In the early\r\nstages of auditorium work and before these days of H.C.L., pieces of\r\ncake have occasionally gone flying across the hall.\r\n\r\nAs soon as branch libraries recognized these facts, and it was very\r\nsoon, the application for dances became fewer and of better quality.\r\nLeavings from other club rooms no longer apply, and disgruntled alumni\r\nassociations in schools have ceased to contemplate a move to the nearest\r\nbranch library.\r\n\r\nNo effort has been made to advertise the club rooms, beyond these\r\nstatements of the branch librarians in passing, except the exhibiting of\r\nthe rooms themselves to visitors who \"stop in to show our library to\r\ncousin Sarah, from Davenport,\" or Illinois, or Oklahoma, as the case may\r\nbe. Word-of-mouth publicity accounts for the gradual steady growth in\r\nthe use of the rooms. One of the many examples began with a stenographer\r\nwho sewed, \"in secret,\" as she said, at noon in the club room. She was\r\nembroidering an engagement present for one of the girls in her office.\r\nNeedless to say, she scattered information about the rooms, and the\r\nrules governing them, wherever any one would listen. Eventually a Sunday\r\nSchool class, to which her cousin belonged, gave a St. Patrick's Day\r\nparty in the library. As an indirect result, a School Patron's\r\nAssociation now holds five or six meetings each Spring, to make\r\npreparations for its annual picnic. So the ball of publicity rolls along\r\nof its own momentum.\r\n\r\nAt branch libraries, the auditorium and study rooms are as a rule\r\nclosely connected architecturally with the reading rooms, and club\r\nmembers usually pass through the main part of the library to reach the\r\nmeetings. One or two at least from each group stop to chat with the\r\nworkers, or to read. At Crunden the assistants say that whenever a\r\nYiddish meeting is to begin at nine, the men come at eight and read.\r\nThen there are the isolated individuals from the club who stumble on the\r\nresources of the library quite by accident, and later grow\r\ncommunicative. Occasionally some one rushes up stairs to borrow the\r\ntelephone book, and when, after an unsuccessful quest, he is offered the\r\ncity directory by the librarian, he finds it hard to realize that any\r\nlibrary can contain a book as useful as that. One man who saw a magazine\r\nlying on the desk while he was asking to be directed to the auditorium,\r\nsaid, \"I had no idea the library handled magazines.\"\r\n\r\nLibraries try as faithfully to reach every one as if they were\r\ncommercial enterprises, but there will always be a certain number of\r\npersons who have never been in a library building, not to speak of\r\nknowing the location of the nearest branch and realizing its resources.\r\nA Harvard graduate said he had walked past a branch every day for a year\r\nand had thought it was a branch post-office. If there were no other\r\narguments in favor of adding auditoriums to the library's list of\r\nactivities, there is this: that they introduce to the library large\r\ngroups of people who have had no connection with it before. The horse at\r\nleast has been led to the water.\r\n\r\nIf clubs meet regularly, there is always a small proportion who make\r\nmeeting-night their library night. They consequently read and want to\r\ncalculate all fines with reference to the night of the last meeting. I\r\nonce heard one young woman telling another how she finally had her\r\nreading \"doped out into a system,\" by beginning on her seven-day book\r\njust as soon as she reached home after the meeting, and using the\r\nfourteen-day book only on the street cars.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of libraries in small towns and rural\r\ncommunities, there is at present a tendency to make social centers out\r\nof library buildings, even at the sacrifice of the books, rather than to\r\nestablish libraries in connection with social activities. This is also\r\ntrue in those cities where \"field-houses\" in parks are well developed.\r\nWithout holding a brief for either school, we may properly emphasize\r\nthree principles. The first is that a librarian holds her position by\r\nvirtue of being a librarian, and that her duty and training require her\r\nfull time for the purpose for which she is employed--the fitting of the\r\nproper book to the individual. The second is that if the community needs\r\nto have the social center stressed more than the books, a social worker\r\nmust direct the center and the librarian must contribute in a\r\nsubordinate capacity to make the center a success. For example, the St.\r\nLouis Public Library has equipped a room with books and is furnishing an\r\nattendant at a colored social center in a church building at Garrison\r\nand Lucas Avenues, but it does not thereby put forward any claim to\r\ncontrol and stimulate the social activities of the neighborhood. The\r\nthird principle is that if the library plant is already in operation, it\r\nis a waste to exclude neighborhood groups from rooms not being used\r\ndirectly for the reading and circulation of books, inasmuch as overhead\r\nexpenses continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT OF THE FUTURE?\r\n\r\n    A forecast, not of library progress alone, but of\r\n    civilization itself, by one who declares himself \"a\r\n    simple-minded visionary optimist.\" It is of the warp and\r\n    woof of visions like this that the fabric of a better world\r\n    is woven. Frederick Morgan Crunden, who delivered this\r\n    address at the public session of the Philadelphia Conference\r\n    of the American Library Association, 1897, was not, it is\r\n    true, the technical founder of the St. Louis Public Library,\r\n    but in his thirty-year administration of it, he originated\r\n    and kept in motion the forces that have given it the\r\n    position that it now holds in the community. These forces\r\n    and their results were both social, and his address forms a\r\n    fitting conclusion to this compilation of material on \"The\r\n    Library and Society.\" A sketch of Mr. Crunden appears in\r\n    Vol. I of this series.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present Victorian jubilee has naturally brought out a fresh group of\r\nreminiscences comparing conditions at the beginning of the reign with\r\nthose now existing. The most striking contrast between the two periods\r\nlies in the advances made in the material comforts of life--improvements\r\nin lighting and heating, in locomotion and intercommunication. The\r\nprogress of applied science has been so rapid that some of its most\r\nnotable achievements have come within the memory of young persons still\r\nat school. Telephonic conversation between New York and St. Louis is\r\nonly a thing of yesterday; aerial navigation is evidently near at hand;\r\nand already daring scientists speak hopefully of electric communication\r\nwith the planets.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in this line that the world has advanced. To note\r\ngreat changes in social customs, we need not go back to the last\r\ncentury. Sir Algernon West in a recent magazine article refers to the\r\nmatter-of-course manner in which his chief was in the habit of\r\nannouncing to the head clerk that he would not be at the office the\r\nfollowing day, as he was to dine out that evening. As an indication of\r\nthe social changes brought about in his lifetime, he quotes this\r\nsignificant sentence of Mr. Charles Villiers: \"In his young days,\" said\r\nMr. Villiers, \"every young man, even if he was busy, pretended to be\r\nidle; now every young man, even if he is idle, pretends to be busy.\"\r\nThere is great import in this. When every member of society is usefully\r\nemployed, our social problems will be well on the way to solution.\r\n\r\nTo note progress in another direction we need not turn back to the acts\r\nof the 14th century, which made it a crime to give or receive more than\r\nthe wretched wage fixed by law. At the beginning of the Victorian era\r\nboys and girls as young as six years worked in mines and factories\r\nlonger hours than are now required of strong men; and the masses of\r\npeople were compelled to pay an artificially high price for their bread,\r\nin order to increase the unearned wealth of the few.\r\n\r\nAnd in our own country we need not go back to the Salem witchcraft or\r\nthe persecution of the Quakers. There are still eye-witnesses to tell us\r\nthat men and women in this \"land of the free,\" were lawfully sold like\r\ncattle or flogged to death at the will of their owners. It was a few\r\nmonths after Queen Victoria's accession to the throne that Elijah Parish\r\nLovejoy was killed for daring to say that human slavery was wrong--for\r\nadvocating, not forcible abolition, but gradual emancipation as \"the\r\nfree, voluntary act of the master, performed from a conviction of its\r\npropriety.\" For maintaining his right to express his opinions on this or\r\nany other public question, he was driven from place to place and finally\r\nshot down in cold blood. In the city where 60 years ago he fell, a\r\nmartyr to the cause of free speech, a stately monument--one of the most\r\nimposing in the country--was the other day dedicated to his memory. No\r\nAmerican better deserves a monument. No leader in the Revolution or the\r\nCivil War was a greater hero. In my opinion, the unquestioned courage of\r\nthe great Union commander is dwarfed and paled by the simple heroism of\r\nthis young preacher-editor, who gave his life to a greater cause than\r\neven the preservation of the Union. Yet for some years after his death,\r\nin many cities of this country, it would have been hazardous for a man\r\nto utter his eulogy.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a marked advance. But we have not yet obtained entire\r\nfreedom of speech on live topics. Was it not as late as last year that\r\nwe hear of two librarians holding opposite political views, whose\r\npositions were rendered insecure by an unfortunate misadjustment of\r\nlongitudes and political opinions? And not many miles from here a score\r\nof good, earnest men were jailed for advocating, disinterestedly, and at\r\nconsiderable self-sacrifice, a method of taxation that did not meet the\r\napproval of the city authorities. Still we have made great progress\r\ntoward a broad tolerance. We not only permit the practice of all\r\nreligious forms, but we even allow a man to deny himself the\r\nconsolations of religion in any form if he chooses to do so.\r\n\r\nIn science, at least, there is absolute freedom of thought and\r\nexpression. One may publish arguments to prove that the world is five\r\nthousand, or five hundred million years old, and no one will molest or\r\ndenounce him; or he may announce a new theory of the universe with our\r\nmoon as the stationary centre, and no state or church will\r\nanathematize him or compel him to recant. It is not till he enters the\r\nfield of politics, i.e., the discussion of economic and sociological\r\nquestions with a view to immediate practical results, that the\r\nadvocate of new ideas reaches the danger-point. Here he finds vested\r\ninterests--self-styled \"vested rights,\" but as often vested wrongs--on\r\nguard and alert to repel intrusion and resist inquiry. These summon to\r\ntheir aid the legions of unreasoning conservatism; and the innovator\r\nis made to feel the truth of the saying that there is no pain so keen\r\nas the pain of a new idea--from which, therefore, mankind has always\r\nshrunk, as a child shrinks from the surgeon's knife. We have passed\r\nthe period of rack and stake; but social and business ostracism are\r\npretty effective, while occasionally there are suggestions of\r\ntar-buckets or bullets. For the most part, however, we content\r\nourselves with denouncing the proposer of any marked departure from\r\nexisting political or sociological conditions as a \"socialist,\" a\r\n\"communist,\" and an \"anarchist,\" using these terms indiscriminately as\r\nabusive epithets without any definite knowledge of their meaning. From\r\nthe beginning of time every social advance--and until recently every\r\nforward step in science or religion has been regarded as menacing the\r\nvery foundations of society. The Reform Act of 1832, which simply took\r\nthe first step towards correcting the grossest political abuses, was\r\nlooked upon by the Duke of Wellington and other good men as\r\nthreatening the very existence of the kingdom. The condition of\r\naffairs then existing, they considered, if not the best possible, at\r\nany rate vastly better than the political chaos that would be sure to\r\nresult from change. Speaking on this blind conservative opposition to\r\nthe Reform Bill, Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, said:\r\n\r\n\"All the resistance to these natural changes can effect is to derange\r\ntheir operation, and make them act violently and mischievously instead\r\nof healthfully, or at least harmlessly. The old state of things is gone\r\npast recall, and all the efforts of all the tories cannot save it; but\r\nthey may by their folly, as they did in France, get us a wild democracy\r\nor a military despotism in the room of it, instead of letting it change\r\nquietly into what it is, merely a new modification of the old state. One\r\nwould think that people who talk against change were literally as well\r\nas metaphorically blind, and really did not see that everything in\r\nthemselves and around them is changing every hour by the necessary law\r\nof its being.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing so revolutionary, because there is nothing so\r\nunnatural and so convulsive to society, as the strain to keep things\r\nfixed, when all the world is, by the very law of its creation, in\r\neternal progress; and the cause of all the evils of the world may be\r\ntraced to that natural but most deadly error of human indolence and\r\ncorruption--that our business is to preserve and not to improve.\"\r\n\r\nIn his retrospect of the Victorian reign, in the June Review of Reviews,\r\nW.T. Stead says: \"It is to the stoutest conservatives of our time almost\r\ninconceivable that rational beings could ever have defended the system\r\nthat prevailed in Britain sixty years ago.\"\r\n\r\nI am no more assured of the rising of to-morrow's sun than I am that to\r\nthe stoutest conservatives of 1950, it will appear \"almost inconceivable\r\nthat rational beings could ever have defended the system\" that prevails\r\nin America to-day. They will, however, resist further progress as\r\ndoggedly as do the conservatives of to-day, even while these see plainly\r\nhow absurd was the attitude of their predecessors of sixty years ago.\r\nYour genuine conservative ever holds doggedly to things as they are. He\r\nclings tenaciously--and vainly. He belongs to a party whose defeat all\r\nhistory teaches is foredoomed. Now he stands for the divine right of\r\nkings; and notwithstanding he is a man of irreproachable character and\r\nable, moreover, to show that he is much less autocratic than most of his\r\npredecessors, he loses his crown and his head. Again, he stands for the\r\nparent country's unlimited power of taxation, and he forfeits his most\r\nflourishing colonies. At another period he urges long sufferance as a\r\njustification for continuing--even extending--the crime of slavery, and\r\nhe meets defeat amid slaughter and devastation. No repetition of the\r\nlesson will ever teach him to consider what is abstractly right--what\r\nought to be without reference to what is.\r\n\r\nBut the conservative has to be, in accordance with the law of nature, so\r\npoetically announced in the song of Willis in Iolanthe:\r\n\r\n    \"That every boy and every gal\r\n      That's born into this world alive,\r\n    Is either a little Liberal,\r\n      Or else a little Conservative!\"\r\n\r\nOr, as Emerson's prose expresses it--\r\n\r\n\"The two parties which divide the state--the party of conservatism and\r\nthat of innovation--are very old and have disputed the possession of the\r\nworld ever since it was made. This quarrel is the subject of civil\r\nhistory. The conservative party established the reverend hierarchies and\r\nmonarchies of the most ancient world. The battle of patrician and\r\nplebeian, of parent state and colony, of old usage and accommodation to\r\nnew facts, of the rich and the poor, reappears in all countries and\r\ntimes....\r\n\r\n\"There is always a certain meanness in the argument of conservatism,\r\njoined with a certain superiority in its fact. It affirms because it\r\nholds. Its fingers clutch the fact, and it will not open its eyes to see\r\na better fact. The castle which conservatism is set to defend is the\r\nactual state of things, good or bad. The project of innovation is the\r\nbest possible state of things. Of course conservatism always has the\r\nworst of the argument, is always apologizing, pleading a necessity,\r\npleading that to change would be to deteriorate. It must saddle itself\r\nwith the mountainous load of the violence and the vice of society, must\r\ndeny the possibility of good, deny ideas, and suspect and stone the\r\nprophets; while innovation is always in the right, triumphant,\r\nattacking, and sure of final success.\"\r\n\r\nBut though doomed to defeat, conservatism is not to be denounced or\r\ncondemned. It is not without its uses. It often keeps us from following\r\nuntried paths that open out alluring but end in thickets or quagmires. A\r\nbrake is sometimes as necessary to safety as motive power is to\r\nprogress. But the usual tendency of conservatism is to keep the brakes\r\non all the time, causing either stagnation, retrogression, or a\r\nsmash-up. The real revolutionist is the rock-ribbed conservative. It is\r\nthe boulder blocking the onward flow of the stream that causes the eddy\r\nand the whirlpool.\r\n\r\nThose who think on this subject and who really desire the improvement of\r\nsociety--unfortunately a very small class--are divided over the question\r\nwhether mankind shall progress by the path of individualism or by that\r\nof collectivism. Extremists assure us that these paths go in opposite\r\ndirections, or traverse each other at right angles. The truth is they\r\nrun parallel; and we have been travelling both, now advancing more on\r\none and then on the other, towards the ultimate goal of humanity--the\r\nperfection of society through the elevation of the individual, the\r\nperfection of the individual through the improvement of society. Each\r\nhelps the other; neither can be independent of the other. It often\r\nhappens that organized society cannot await the slow process of\r\nindividual perfection. It must accelerate the operation by changing\r\nstandards and ideals. There is no telling how long it would have\r\nrequired to convince each individual slave-owner of the wrong of human\r\nslavery, or each individual mine and factory owner of the wickedness of\r\nchild-labor. Society had to take the matter in hand and force individual\r\ndevelopment--in one case by law, in the other by the sword. Many\r\nthoughtful persons are raising the question whether society has not more\r\nwork of this kind ahead of it. There can be no individual perfection or\r\nprogress under certain social conditions. Ceremonious politeness was not\r\nto be expected among the victims of the Black Hole of Calcutta.\r\nStarvation has often led to cannibalism among men who would shrink with\r\nhorror from the thought of it under ordinary conditions. Society can\r\ncreate conditions favorable or unfavorable to the improvement of the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable outcome of the struggle between individualism and\r\ncollectivism is the triumph of each in its own proper field.\r\n\r\nA line drawn from the past to the present shows the trend of the future.\r\nWe find this embodying two distinct, and apparently contradictory,\r\ntendencies--one towards greater individual freedom, the other towards a\r\nconstant extension of the principle of cooperation, or collectivism.\r\nThat is, organized society leaves ever greater freedom to the individual\r\nin all those things that concern only him, while at the same time it\r\nextends farther and farther its supervision and performance of those\r\nthings that pertain to the welfare of all, and which society can do for\r\nthe individual better than he can do for himself. A man may kiss his\r\nwife on Sunday without scandal or fear of prosecution; and he may dress\r\nin any manner he pleases within the bounds of convention, which is still\r\nan unreasoning tyrant. He is generally glad to avail himself of the more\r\nconvenient water-supply provided by the community; but he may, if he\r\nwishes, have a well in his yard, until, with the growth of the city,\r\nthis becomes a menace to his neighbors' health; then it must be closed.\r\nHe may still mould his own tallow candles and use no other light if he\r\nprefers; but cooperation among consumers supplies him with a much\r\nsuperior illuminant; and when this cooperation is extended to embrace\r\nall the citizens--i.e., when gas or electricity is furnished by the\r\nmunicipality, the cost is reduced, and he becomes a partner in the\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nOf the benefits of municipal cooperation we had a signal illustration in\r\nthe introduction of municipal sprinkling in St. Louis. Formerly, the\r\noccupant of a fifty-foot lot paid a private contractor from $6 to $12 a\r\nseason, while he suffered from the dust blown from his neighbors'\r\nfrontage and from unsprinkled streets all over the city. Now the owner\r\nof a fifty-foot lot pays about $1 a year and enjoys sprinkled streets\r\nthroughout the whole city. Municipal cooperation in libraries brings the\r\nsame kind of benefits. The average well-to-do reader, instead of a\r\nfive-dollar subscription fee, pays a dollar tax; and for that not only\r\nhe and his family, but also the families of his neighbors, have access\r\nto a superior library. And it is almost as necessary for your comfort\r\nthat your neighbor's children have access to a library as for your own.\r\n\r\nWhile social evolution tends to relieve the individual of the\r\ncompulsion of law, and also to lessen the pressure of public opinion, in\r\nthose affairs that pertain only to his own life, correlatively his\r\naction is more and more restricted in so far as it affects his neighbors\r\nand society in general--though here, too, law and custom tend more and\r\nmore to individual freedom. It was once regarded as a public scandal not\r\nto go to church; and 50 years ago in St. Louis Unitarians were shunned\r\nas suspicious characters. But pari passu with the growth of individual\r\nliberty has grown the recognition of the duty of society to see that all\r\npersons have equal liberty--to protect the weak against the strong.\r\nNothing in Victoria's reign has done more for the progress of England\r\nthan the series of acts that have been passed to curb the greed of mine\r\nand factory owners, to prevent them from coining the muscle and manhood\r\nof Britain into gold--in a way that, at one period, threatened to\r\nexhaust the vitality of the race--to kill the goose that lays the golden\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of mankind is a continuous struggle of the weak and\r\nignorant many to secure the rights withheld from them by the superior\r\nstrength and cunning of the few. The oppression and injustice of the\r\npast are apparent to all; but many of us, like the conservative\r\nantagonists of Cobden and Bright, fail to see anything seriously wrong\r\nin the present; and, like them, we fear change. But it is the part of\r\nwise men to welcome change as the natural order of the universe--to see\r\nthat it is a change for the better.\r\n\r\nIt does not by any means follow that every new idea is a good one, that\r\nevery proposed change would be an improvement. But as progress is the\r\nlaw of the universe, it rests with the old order to show why it should\r\nbe continued. Wisdom, therefore, urges us to give careful consideration\r\nto new ideas, however contrary they may be to prevalent opinions,\r\nbearing in mind the frequent lesson of history that \"the stone which the\r\nbuilders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner,\" and\r\napproaching all questions in the spirit of St. Paul's injunction: \"Prove\r\nall things; hold fast that which is good.\" For all political and social\r\nproblems, which are the burning questions of to-day, there is, it seems\r\nto me, a simple test in Herbert Spencer's \"first principle\": \"Every man\r\nmay claim the fullest liberty to exercise his faculties compatible with\r\nthe possession of like liberty by every other man.\" Legislation that\r\ndoes not square with the self-evident truth and justice of this dictum\r\nis bad legislation, and must prove maleficent to the nation, state, or\r\ncity that enacts it. I need not offer any modern instances.\r\n\r\nReasoning in reverse order, i.e., from effect to cause, we may be sure\r\nthat when we see in a country abounding in natural resources, as ours\r\nis, inhabited by the most intelligent, energetic, and resourceful people\r\nthe world has ever seen--when we see in such a country millions of\r\nwilling workers in enforced idleness; when, to account for the idleness\r\nand its attendant want and destitution, we are offered the absurdity of\r\n\"over-production\" of the very things for which millions are suffering;\r\nwhen we see men and women who toil not revelling in luxury, while others\r\nwho labor sixteen hours a day are barely able to keep body and soul\r\ntogether, we may know absolutely, without further investigation, that\r\nthere is something fundamentally wrong in our social organization.\r\n\r\nThis is not the time or place to point out these wrongs specifically, or\r\nto advance, even in the most general terms, what, after much thought, I\r\nbelieve to be the remedies. I merely urge the thoughtful study of social\r\nproblems without bias or prejudice. This state of openmindedness is not\r\neasy to achieve. We think that we think our own thoughts; but as Tarde,\r\nthe French psychologist, says: \"What the individual hypnotizer is to his\r\nsleeping and abnormally plastic subject, such, almost precisely, is\r\nsociety to the waking and normally plastic man.\"[7]\r\n\r\nOn the solution of social problems, Ibsen says: \"There is only one thing\r\nthat avails--to revolutionize people's minds.\" This was a difficult task\r\nabout so plain a matter as the Copernican system, which was opposed by\r\nthe combined learning and piety of Europe. How much more difficult must\r\nit be when the change affects the every-day life of every individual? As\r\nNitti says: \"Had the propositions of Euclid affected economic interests\r\nthey would still appear doubtful hypotheses of arduous solution.\"\r\n\r\n[7] \"As, then, in philosophy the first step is to begin by doubting\r\neverything, so, in social philosophy, the first step is to throw aside\r\nall supposed absolute rights.\"--JEVONS.\r\n\r\nThe public library is destined to play an important part, to exercise\r\nan incalculable influence in the solution of the social problems of\r\nto-day, and through this on the future of the nation and the race. The\r\nwisdom needed for this task is not to be obtained from schools or\r\ncolleges, but from the higher education of mature minds--the masses of\r\nthe people--which the public library alone can give. The preparation for\r\nthis higher education of the masses devolves on the schools and\r\ncolleges. Their curricula should be so arranged as to arouse \"historic\r\nconsciousness\" in the youngest child, to awaken social consciousness,\r\nand to provide for its continuous development by starting every boy and\r\ngirl on a career of self-culture--by matriculating every child in the\r\nPeople's University, the Public Library. In affairs that concern society\r\nas a whole, it is better to trust the well-informed common-sense of the\r\npeople than the learning of the schoolmen.\r\n\r\nIt is not knowledge of mathematics or physics, or Greek and Latin, or\r\nmodern languages; it is not the study--academic study--of history, or\r\nphilosophy, or even political economy, that will solve the great social\r\nproblems that now confront us. These will help in various degrees,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, some more, some less, some, perhaps, not at all.\r\nA knowledge of the general course of history is essential; some\r\nacquaintance with philosophy is useful; dogmatic theology serves only to\r\nconfuse, but the true religion that lies in a vital acceptance of\r\nChrist's two commandments as a summary of the law and the prophets--that\r\nis the greatest aid of all. Such, however, is the influence of\r\nestablished order on men's minds that no investigation will avail\r\nwithout a determination to take nothing for granted, to re-examine what\r\nhave been considered basic principles, to accept no postulates that do\r\nnot square with reason and justice. This cannot be done by confining our\r\nreading to the accepted standards of a generation or a century ago. We\r\nmust keep abreast of the thought of the time; we must keep our eyes and\r\nears, and still more our minds, open; we must scorn no aids to\r\nenlightenment; but we must do our own thinking; we must consider the\r\nidea, not the source from which it came, remembering that good may come\r\nout of Nazareth; we must live up to the motto; \"Truth for authority, not\r\nauthority for truth,\" and we must \"lend a hand.\"\r\n\r\nMy faith in the efficacy of the education offered by the public library\r\nis not without foundation. In more than one case I have seen a course of\r\nlectures or the reading of a single book lead to a course of reading in\r\neconomics and sociology, which has entirely changed points of view. New\r\nideals, higher standards, have made new men with higher lines of action.\r\nTheir natures have not been changed, but their visions have been\r\nclarified.\r\n\r\nOne of the stock arguments which conservatism always brings out to give\r\na final quietus to any proposal for social reform, is--\"Oh, that's\r\nimpossible; you'd have to change human nature!\" This mental attitude,\r\nwhich, I am sorry to say, is the prevailing one with the great majority\r\nof mankind, is admirable satirized in some verses which I had great\r\npleasure in printing in the April number of the St. Louis Public Library\r\nMagazine:\r\n\r\n    There was once a Neolithic Man, an enterprising wight,\r\n    Who made his simple instruments unusually bright,\r\n    Unusually clever he, unusually brave.\r\n    And he sketched delightful mammoths on the border of his cave,\r\n    To his Neolithic neighbors who were startled and surprised,\r\n    Said he: \"My friends, in course of time we shall be civilized!\r\n    We are going to live in cities and build churches and make laws!\r\n    We are going to eat three times a day without the natural cause!\r\n    We're going to turn life upside down about a thing called Gold!\r\n    We're going to want the earth, and take as much as we can hold!\r\n    We are going to wear a pile of stuff outside our proper skins;\r\n    We're going to have Diseases! and Accomplishments!! and Sins!!!\r\n    Then they all rose up in fury against this boastful friend\r\n    For prehistoric patience comes quickly to an end.\r\n    Said one, \"This is chimerical! Uptopian! Absurd!\"\r\n    Said another, \"What a stupid life! Too dull, upon my word!\"\r\n    Cried all, \"Before such things can come, you idiotic child,\r\n    You must alter Human Nature!\" and they all sat back and smiled!\r\n    Thought they, \"An answer to that last it will be hard to find!\"\r\n    It was a clinching argument--to the Neolithic Mind!\r\n\r\nYes, great progress and reform can be accomplished without changing\r\nhuman nature. The elemental forces in the heart of man are the same now\r\nas in the earliest recorded ages, and they are likely to remain the same\r\nfor all time to come. We cannot change the elements of man's nature; but\r\nby changing conditions we can improve the product of reaction. We can\r\nelevate conduct by elevating ideals. There was a time when the man who\r\ncould wield the heaviest battle-axe was the greatest man; and there are\r\nstill circles in which Corbett and Fitzsimmons are regarded as the\r\ngreatest men of the present day. But the men who now excite most general\r\nadmiration are our \"captains of industry,\" the men who succeed in\r\ngetting money and the luxury and power it commands. How shall we elevate\r\nour national ideals?\r\n\r\nSelfishness is a mainspring of human action. A like motive, desire for\r\nhappiness, sets men to fighting dogs and to founding hospitals. Nero\r\nfound pleasure in one way, Marcus Aurelius in another. Charles I. and\r\nLouis XVI. were not bad men; but they were controlled by outgrown\r\nstandards. Elizabeth, Napoleon, Peter, and Catherine of Russia sought\r\ntheir own pleasure in accordance with their personal characters and the\r\nstandards of their times. But how much higher and purer pleasure the\r\ndevotion of their talents to the service of their fellowmen brought to\r\nWashington, Jefferson and Lincoln, Cobden, Bright and Gladstone--and\r\nJohn Pounds!\r\n\r\nFalse standards, low ideals, now lead many good men to find their\r\npleasure, not in cruelty, not in sensuality, but in the accumulation of\r\nwealth, partly for the luxury, chiefly for the power it brings.\r\n\"Superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.\"\r\n\r\nWith the spread of intelligence and thought, and the consequent\r\nelevation of popular ideals, men possessed of millions will not seek to\r\nadd to their large legitimate gains by legalized robbery from their\r\nfellow-citizens; and people calling themselves Christians will not\r\nrejoice in the distress and starvation of their fellow-men across the\r\nocean. Men will still be selfish but their selfishness will at least be\r\non a higher plane--less intense, less destructive of essential rights.\r\n\r\nHow shall we most speedily bring about this desired consummation? By\r\nwhat agency can we most effectively elevate our national ideals? By\r\nextending and improving our system of popular education, by reversing\r\nthe usual order and beginning where school curricula now end, by placing\r\nour school-children from their earliest years in close and familiar\r\ncontact with the life and thought of the race as expressed in\r\nliterature, by exciting in every child admiration and emulation of the\r\nworld's true heroes, by feeding the imagination and cultivating the\r\nmoral faculties, by putting every child into the way of acquiring a\r\nsocial and a historic perspective.\r\n\r\nI suppose I am one of those simple-minded visionary optimists of whom\r\nProf. Royce speaks. But I do not \"dislike\" economic facts in the sense\r\nof ignoring them, and I am not blind to the persistence of the elemental\r\nforces of human nature. But as the abolition of slavery changed men's\r\nmental attitude towards this social crime, without at all changing human\r\nnature, just so I believe that the adoption of other social reforms\r\nwould in a generation cause all men to look with horror and wonder upon\r\nsocial injustice that nearly every one now ignores or regards as\r\nirremediable and inevitable. I share Ruskin's scorn of the word\r\n\"Utopian.\" \"A thing is either possible or impossible.\" As Carlyle says,\r\n\"The actual final rights of man lie in the far deeps of the ideal. Every\r\nnoble work is at first impossible.\" In the A.L.A. we have heard the word\r\n\"Utopian,\" or its equivalent, on more than one occasion met by the\r\nmotto, \"Hitch your wagon to a star\"; and we have seen the impracticable\r\nan accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nIf time permitted I might risk ridicule by presenting some features of\r\nthe vision that I see with the eye of faith in an all-wise and\r\nall-powerful Creater and belief in human perfectibility as an infinite\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n    \"Die Zukunft decket\r\n    Schmerzen and Gluecke\r\n    Schrittweis' dem Blicke;\r\n    Doch ungeschrecket,\r\n    Dringen wir vorwaerts.\"\r\n\r\n    \"New occasions teach new duties;\r\n    Time makes ancient good uncouth!\r\n    They must upward still and onward\r\n    Who would keep abreast with truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Abiel, library pioneer, 172.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Brooks, quoted, 81.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Charles Francis, trustee of Crane Library, Quincy, 308.\r\n\r\n  Adams, John Quincy, quoted, 294.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Matthew, lends books to Franklin, 133.\r\n\r\n  Adams library, Quincy, Mass., 310.\r\n\r\n  Adaptation of Libraries to Constituencies,\r\n    paper, by S.S.
