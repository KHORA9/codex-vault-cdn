It is\r\nconstructed on the same lines, and is a kind of new and much revised\r\nedition of that successful work. While in some respects more extended,\r\nit is also more concise and terse than its predecessor. This should the\r\nbetter fit it for its purpose now that competent teachers are common.\r\nThey may in many cases develop paragraphs into lectures, and fully\r\nillustrate points which are barely, but it is hoped clearly, stated.\r\nIndeed, even for those without a teacher, it may be that a condensed is\r\nbetter than a diffuse exposition.\r\n\r\nThe book is adapted to the higher schools, \"How Plants Grow and Behave\"\r\nbeing the \"Botany for Young People and Common Schools.\" It is intended\r\nto ground beginners in Structural Botany and the principles of vegetable\r\nlife, mainly as concerns Flowering or Phanerogamous plants, with which\r\nbotanical instruction should always begin; also to be a companion and\r\ninterpreter to the Manuals and Floras by which the student threads his\r\nflowery way to a clear knowledge of the surrounding vegetable creation.\r\nSuch a book, like a grammar, must needs abound in technical words, which\r\nthus arrayed may seem formidable; nevertheless, if rightly apprehended,\r\nthis treatise should teach that the study of botany is not the learning\r\nof names and terms, but the acquisition of knowledge and ideas. No\r\neffort should be made to commit technical terms to memory. Any term used\r\nin describing a plant or explaining its structure can be looked up when\r\nit is wanted, and that should suffice. On the other hand, plans of\r\nstructure, types, adaptations, and modifications, once understood, are\r\nnot readily forgotten; and they give meaning and interest to the\r\ntechnical terms used in explaining them.\r\n\r\nIn these \"Elements\" naturally no mention has been made of certain terms\r\nand names which recent cryptogamically-minded botanists, with lack of\r\nproportion and just perspective, are endeavoring to introduce into\r\nphanerogamous botany, and which are not needed nor appropriate, even in\r\nmore advanced works, for the adequate recognition of the ascertained\r\nanalogies and homologies.\r\n\r\nAs this volume will be the grammar and dictionary to more than one or\r\ntwo Manuals, Floras, etc., the particular directions for procedure which\r\nwere given in the \"First Lessons\" are now relegated to those works\r\nthemselves, which in their new editions will provide the requisite\r\nexplanations. On the other hand, in view of such extended use, the\r\nGlossary at the end of this book has been considerably enlarged. It will\r\nbe found to include not merely the common terms of botanical description\r\nbut also many which are unusual or obsolete; yet any of them may now and\r\nthen be encountered. Moreover, no small number of the Latin and Greek\r\nwords which form the whole or part of the commoner specific names are\r\nadded to this Glossary, some in an Anglicized, others in their Latin\r\nform. This may be helpful to students with small Latin and less Greek,\r\nin catching the meaning of a botanical name or term.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations in this volume are largely increased in number. They\r\nare mostly from the hand of Isaac Sprague.\r\n\r\nIt happens that the title chosen for this book is that of the author's\r\nearliest publication, in the year 1836, of which copies are rarely seen;\r\nso that no inconvenience is likely to arise from the present use of the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n                              ASA GRAY.\r\n\r\n                              Cambridge, Massachusetts,\r\n                              _March, 1887_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  Page\r\nSECTION I.

INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BOTANY is the name of the science of the vegetable kingdom in\r\ngeneral; that is, of plants.\r\n\r\n2. Plants may be studied as to their kinds and relationships. This study\r\nis SYSTEMATIC BOTANY. An enumeration of the kinds of vegetables, as far\r\nas known, classified according to their various degrees of resemblance\r\nor difference, constitutes a general _System of plants_. A similar\r\naccount of the vegetables of any particular country or district is\r\ncalled a _Flora_.\r\n\r\n3. Plants may be studied as to their structure and parts. This is\r\nSTRUCTURAL BOTANY, or ORGANOGRAPHY. The study of the organs or parts of\r\nplants in regard to the different forms and different uses which the\r\nsame kind of organ may assume,--the comparison, for instance, of a\r\nflower-leaf or a bud-scale with a common leaf,--is VEGETABLE MORPHOLOGY,\r\nor MORPHOLOGICAL BOTANY. The study of the minute structure of the parts,\r\nto learn by the microscope what they themselves are formed of, is\r\nVEGETABLE ANATOMY, or HISTOLOGY; in other words, it is Microscopical\r\nStructural Botany. The study of the actions of plants or of their parts,\r\nof the ways in which a plant lives, grows, and acts, is the province of\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL BOTANY, or VEGETABLE PHYSIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n4. This book is to teach the outlines of Structural Botany and of the\r\nsimpler parts of the physiology of plants, that it may be known how\r\nplants are constructed and adapted to their surroundings, and how they\r\nlive, move, propagate, and have their being in an existence no less\r\nreal, although more simple, than that of the animal creation which they\r\nsupport. Particularly, this book is to teach the principles of the\r\nstructure and relationships of plants, the nature and names of their\r\nparts and their modifications, and so to prepare for the study of\r\nSystematic Botany; in which the learner may ascertain the name and the\r\nplace in the system of any or all of the ordinary plants within reach,\r\nwhether wild or cultivated. And in ascertaining the name of any plant,\r\nthe student, if rightly taught, will come to know all about its general\r\nor particular structure, rank, and relationship to other plants.\r\n\r\n5. The vegetable kingdom is so vast and various, and the difference is\r\nso wide between ordinary trees, shrubs, and herbs on the one hand, and\r\nmosses, moulds, and such like on the other, that it is hardly possible\r\nto frame an intelligible account of plants as a whole without\r\ncontradictions or misstatements, or endless and troublesome\r\nqualifications. If we say that plants come from seeds, bear flowers, and\r\nhave roots, stems, and leaves, this is not true of the lower orders. It\r\nis best for the beginner, therefore, to treat of the higher orders of\r\nplants by themselves, without particular reference to the lower.\r\n\r\n6. Let it be understood, accordingly, that there is a higher and a lower\r\nseries of plants; namely:--\r\n\r\nPHANEROGAMOUS PLANTS, which come from seed and bear _flowers_,\r\nessentially stamens and pistils, through the co-operation of which seed\r\nis produced. For shortness, these are commonly called PHANEROGAMS, or\r\n_Phaenogams_, or by the equivalent English name of FLOWERING PLANTS.[1]\r\n\r\nCRYPTOGAMOUS PLANTS, or CRYPTOGAMS, come from minute bodies, which\r\nanswer to seeds, but are of much simpler structure, and such plants have\r\nnot stamens and pistils. Therefore they are called in English FLOWERLESS\r\nPLANTS. Such are Ferns, Mosses, Algae or Seaweeds, Fungi, etc. These\r\nsorts have each to be studied separately, for each class or order has a\r\nplan of its own.\r\n\r\n7. But Phanerogamous, or Flowering, Plants are all constructed on one\r\nplan, or _type_. That is, taking almost any ordinary herb, shrub, or\r\ntree for a pattern, it will exemplify the whole series: the parts of one\r\nplant answer to the parts of any other, with only certain differences in\r\nparticulars. And the occupation and the delight of the scientific\r\nbotanist is in tracing out this common plan, in detecting the likenesses\r\nunder all the diversities, and in noting the meaning of these manifold\r\ndiversities. So the attentive study of any one plant, from its growth\r\nout of the seed to the flowering and fruiting state and the production\r\nof seed like to that from which the plant grew, would not only give a\r\ncorrect general idea of the structure, growth, and characteristics of\r\nFlowering Plants in general, but also serve as a pattern or standard of\r\ncomparison. Some plants will serve this purpose of a pattern much better\r\nthan others. A proper pattern will be one that is perfect in the sense\r\nof having all the principal parts of a phanerogamous plant, and simple\r\nand regular in having these parts free from complications or disguises.\r\nThe common Flax-plant may very well serve this purpose. Being an annual,\r\nit has the advantage of being easily raised and carried in a short time\r\nthrough its circle of existence, from seedling to fruit and seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The name is sometimes _Phanerogamous_, sometimes _Phaenogamous_\r\n(_Phanerogams_, or _Phaenogams_), terms of the same meaning\r\netymologically; the former of preferable form, but the latter shorter.\r\nThe meaning of such terms is explained in the Glossary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection II. FLAX AS A PATTERN PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. =Growth from the Seed.= Phanerogamous plants grow from seed, and\r\ntheir flowers are destined to the production of seeds. A seed has a\r\nrudimentary plant ready formed in it,--sometimes with the two most\r\nessential parts, i. e. stem and leaf, plainly discernible; sometimes\r\nwith no obvious distinction of organs until germination begins. This\r\nincipient plant is called an EMBRYO.\r\n\r\n9. In this section the Flax-plant is taken as a specimen, or type, and\r\nthe development and history of common plants in general is illustrated\r\nby it. In flax-seed the embryo nearly fills the coats, but not quite.\r\nThere is a small deposit of nourishment between the seed-coat and the\r\nembryo: this may for the present be left out of the account. This embryo\r\nconsists of a pair of leaves, pressed together face to face, and\r\nattached to an extremely short stem. (Fig. 2-4.) In this rudimentary\r\ncondition the real nature of the parts is not at once apparent; but when\r\nthe seed grows they promptly reveal their character,--as the\r\naccompanying figures (Fig. 5-7) show.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Pod of Flax. 2. Section lengthwise, showing two\r\nof the seeds; one whole, the other cut half away, bringing contained\r\nembryo into view. 3. Similar section of a flax-seed more magnified and\r\ndivided flatwise; turned round, so that the stem-end (caulicle) of the\r\nembryo is below: the whole broad upper part is the inner face of one of\r\nthe cotyledons; the minute nick at its base is the plumule. 4. Similar\r\nsection through a seed turned edgewise, showing the thickness of the\r\ncotyledons, and the minute plumule between them, i. e. the minute bud on\r\nthe upper end of the caulicle.]\r\n\r\n10. Before the nature of these parts in the seed was altogether\r\nunderstood, technical names were given to them, which are still in use.\r\nThese initial leaves were named COTYLEDONS. The initial stem on which\r\nthey stand was called the RADICLE. That was because it gives rise to the\r\nfirst root; but, as it is really the beginning of the stem, and because\r\nit is the stem that produces the root and not the root that produces the\r\nstem, it is better to name it the CAULICLE. Recently it has been named\r\n_Hypocotyle_; which signifies something below the cotyledons, without\r\npronouncing what its nature is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Early Flax seedling; stem (caulicle), root at\r\nlower end, expanded seed-leaves (cotyledons) at the other: minute bud\r\n(plumule) between these. 6. Same later; the bud developed into second\r\npair of leaves, with hardly any stem-part below them; then into a third\r\npair of leaves, raised on a short joint of stem; and a fifth leaf also\r\nshowing. 7. Same still older, with more leaves developed, but these\r\nsingly (one after another), and with joints of stem between them.]\r\n\r\n11. On committing these seeds to moist and warm soil they soon sprout,\r\ni. e. _germinate_. The very short stem-part of the embryo is the first\r\nto grow. It lengthens, protrudes its root-end; this turns downward, if\r\nnot already pointing in that direction, and while it is lengthening a\r\nroot forms at its point and grows downward into the ground. This root\r\ncontinues to grow on from its lower end, and thus insinuates itself and\r\npenetrates into the soil. The stem meanwhile is adding to its length\r\nthroughout; it erects itself, and, seeking the light, brings the seed up\r\nout of the ground. The materials for this growth have been supplied by\r\nthe cotyledons or seed-leaves, still in the seed: it was the store of\r\nnourishing material they held which gave them their thickish shape, so\r\nunlike that of ordinary leaves. Now, relieved of a part of this store of\r\nfood, which has formed the growth by which they have been raised into\r\nthe air and light, they appropriate the remainder to their own growth.\r\nIn enlarging they open and throw off the seed-husk; they expand, diverge\r\ninto a horizontal position, turn green, and thus become a pair of\r\nevident leaves, the first foliage of a tiny plant. This seedling,\r\nalthough diminutive and most simple, possesses and puts into use, all\r\nthe ORGANS of VEGETATION, namely, root, stem, and leaves, each in its\r\nproper element,--the root in the soil, the stem rising out of it, the\r\nleaves in the light and open air. It now draws in moisture and some\r\nfood-materials from the soil by its root, conveys this through the stem\r\ninto the leaves, where these materials, along with other crude food\r\nwhich these imbibe from the air, are assimilated into vegetable matter,\r\ni. e. into the material for further growth.\r\n\r\n12. =Further Growth= soon proceeds to the formation of new\r\nparts,--downward in the production of more root, or of branches of the\r\nmain root, upward in the development of more stem and leaves. That from\r\nwhich a stem with its leaves is continued, or a new stem (i. e. branch)\r\noriginated, is a BUD. The most conspicuous and familiar buds are those\r\nof most shrubs and trees, bearing buds formed in summer or autumn, to\r\ngrow the following spring. But every such point for new growth may\r\nequally bear the name. When there is such a bud between the cotyledons\r\nin the seed or seedling it is called the PLUMULE. This is conspicuous\r\nenough in a bean (Fig. 29.), where the young leaf of the new growth\r\nlooks like a little plume, whence the name, _plumule_. In flax-seed this\r\nis very minute indeed, but is discernible with a magnifier, and in the\r\nseedling it shows itself distinctly (Fig. 5, 6, 7).\r\n\r\n13. As it grows it shapes itself into a second pair of leaves, which of\r\ncourse rests on a second joint of stem, although in this instance that\r\nremains too short to be well seen. Upon its summit appears the third\r\npair of leaves, soon to be raised upon its proper joint of stem; the\r\nnext leaf is single, and is carried up still further upon its supporting\r\njoint of stem; and so on. The root, meanwhile, continues to grow\r\nunderground, not joint after joint, but continuously, from its lower\r\nend; and commonly it before long multiplies itself by branches, which\r\nlengthen by the same continuous growth. But stems are built up by a\r\nsuccession of leaf-bearing growths, such as are strongly marked in a\r\nreed or corn-stalk, and less so in such an herb as Flax. The word\r\n\"joint\" is ambiguous: it may mean either the portion between successive\r\nleaves, or their junction, where the leaves are attached. For precision,\r\ntherefore, the place where the leaf or leaves are borne is called a\r\nNODE, and the naked interval between two nodes, an INTERNODE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Upper part of Flax-plant in blossom.]\r\n\r\n14. In this way a simple stem with its garniture of leaves is developed\r\nfrom the seed. But besides this direct continuation, buds may form and\r\ndevelop into lateral stems, that is, _into branches_, from any node. The\r\nproper origin of branches is from the AXIL of a leaf, i. e. the angle\r\nbetween leaf and stem on the upper side; and branches may again branch,\r\nso building up the herb, shrub, or tree. But sooner or later, and\r\nwithout long delay in an annual like Flax, instead of this continuance\r\nof mere vegetation, reproduction is prepared for by\r\n\r\n15. =Blossoming.= In Flax the flowers make their appearance at the end\r\nof the stem and branches. The growth, which otherwise might continue\r\nthem farther or indefinitely, now takes the form of blossom, and is\r\nsubservient to the production of seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Flax-flowers about natural size. 10. Section of a\r\nflower moderately enlarged, showing a part of the petals and stamens,\r\nall five styles, and a section of ovary with two ovules or rudimentary\r\nseeds.]\r\n\r\n16. =The Flower= of Flax consists, first, of five small green leaves,\r\ncrowded into a circle: this is the CALYX, or flower-cup. When its\r\nseparate leaves are referred to they are called SEPALS, a name which\r\ndistinguishes them from foliage-leaves on the one hand, and from petals\r\non the other. Then come five delicate and _colored_ leaves (in the Flax,\r\nblue), which form the COROLLA, and its leaves are PETALS; then a circle\r\nof organs, in which all likeness to leaves is lost, consisting of\r\nslender stalks with a knob at summit, the STAMENS; and lastly, in the\r\ncentre, the rounded body, which becomes a pod, surmounted by five\r\nslender or stalk-like bodies. This, all together, is the PISTIL. The\r\nlower part of it, which is to contain the seeds, is the OVARY; the\r\nslender organs surmounting this are STYLES; the knob borne on the apex\r\nof each style is a STIGMA. Going back to the stamens, these are of two\r\nparts, viz. the stalk, called FILAMENT, and the body it bears, the\r\nANTHER. Anthers are filled with POLLEN, a powdery substance made up of\r\nminute grains.\r\n\r\n17. The pollen shed from the anthers when they open falls upon or is\r\nconveyed to the stigmas; then the pollen-grains set up a kind of growth\r\n(to be discerned only by aid of a good microscope), which penetrates the\r\nstyle: this growth takes the form of a thread more delicate than the\r\nfinest spider's web, and reaches the bodies which are to become seeds\r\n(OVULES they are called until this change occurs); these, touched by\r\nthis influence, are incited to a new growth within, which becomes an\r\nembryo. So, as the ovary ripens into the seed-pod or capsule (Fig. 1,\r\netc.) containing seeds, each seed enclosing a rudimentary new plantlet,\r\nthe round of this vegetable existence is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection III. MORPHOLOGY OF SEEDLINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Having obtained a general idea of the growth and parts of a\r\nphanerogamous plant from the common Flax of the field, the seeds and\r\nseedlings of other familiar plants may be taken up, and their variations\r\nfrom the assumed pattern examined.\r\n\r\n19. =Germinating Maples= are excellent to begin with, the parts being so\r\nmuch larger than in Flax that a common magnifying glass, although\r\nconvenient, is hardly necessary. The only disadvantage is that fresh\r\nseeds are not readily to be had at all seasons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Embryo of Sugar Maple, cut through lengthwise\r\nand taken out of the seed. 12, 13. Whole embryo of same just beginning\r\nto grow; _a_, the stemlet or caulicle, which in 13 has considerably\r\nlengthened.]\r\n\r\n20. The seeds of Sugar Maple ripen at the end of summer, and germinate\r\nin early spring. The embryo fills the whole seed, in which it is nicely\r\npacked; and the nature of the parts is obvious even before growth\r\nbegins. There is a stemlet (caulicle) and a pair of long and narrow\r\nseed-leaves (cotyledons), doubled up and coiled, green even in the seed,\r\nand in germination at once unfolding into the first pair of\r\nfoliage-leaves, though of shape quite unlike those that follow.\r\n\r\n21. Red Maple seeds are ripe and ready to germinate at the beginning of\r\nsummer, and are therefore more convenient for study. The cotyledons are\r\ncrumpled in the seed, and not easy to straighten out until they unfold\r\nthemselves in germination. The story of their development into the\r\nseedling is told by the accompanying Fig. 14-20; and that of Sugar Maple\r\nis closely similar. No plumule or bud appears in the embryo of these two\r\nMaples until the seed-leaves have nearly attained their full growth and\r\nare acting as foliage-leaves, and until a root is formed below. There is\r\nno great store of nourishment in these thin cotyledons; so further\r\ngrowth has to wait until the root and seed-leaves have collected and\r\nelaborated sufficient material for the formation of the second internode\r\nand its pair of leaves, which lending their help the third pair is more\r\npromptly produced, and so on.\r\n\r\n22. Some change in the plan comes with the Silver or Soft White Maple.\r\n(Fig. 21-25). This blossoms in earliest spring, and it drops its large\r\nand ripened keys only a few weeks later. Its cotyledons have not at all\r\nthe appearance of leaves; they are short and broad, and (as there is no\r\nroom to be saved by folding) they are straight, except a small fold at\r\nthe top,--a vestige of the habit of Maples in general. Their unusual\r\nthickness is due to the large store of nutritive matter they contain,\r\nand this prevents their developing into actual leaves. Correspondingly,\r\ntheir caulicle does not lengthen to elevate them above the surface of\r\nthe soil; the growth below the cotyledons is nearly all of root. It is\r\nthe little plumule or bud between them which makes the upward growth,\r\nand which, being well fed by the cotyledons, rapidly develops the next\r\npair of leaves and raises them upon a long internode, and so on. The\r\ncotyledons all the while remain below, in the husk of the fruit and\r\nseed, and perish when they have yielded up the store of food which they\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. One of the pair of keys or winged fruits of Red\r\nMaple; the seed-bearing portion cut open to show the seed. 15. Seed\r\nenlarged, and divided to show the crumpled embryo which fills it. 16.\r\nEmbryo taken out and partly opened. 17.

Seedling with another joint of\r\nstem and pair of leaves.]\r\n\r\n23. So, even in plants so much alike as Maples, there is considerable\r\ndifference in the amount of food stored up in the cotyledons by which\r\nthe growth is to be made; and there are corresponding differences in the\r\ngermination. The larger the supply to draw upon, the stronger the\r\ngrowth, and the quicker the formation of root below and of stem and\r\nleaves above. This deposit of food thickens the cotyledons, and renders\r\nthem less and less leaf-like in proportion to its amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.

Still, they are flat and not\r\nvery thick. In germination this store is promptly utilized in the\r\ndevelopment of the caulicle to twenty or thirty times its length in the\r\nseed, and to corresponding thickness, in the formation of a cluster of\r\nroots at its lower end, and the early production of the incipient\r\nplumule; also in their own growth into efficient green leaves. The case\r\nof our common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris, Fig. 28-30) is nearly the same,\r\nexcept that the cotyledons are much more gorged; so that, although\r\ncarried up into the air and light upon the lengthening caulicle, and\r\nthere acquiring a green color, they never expand into useful leaves.\r\nInstead of this, they nourish into rapid growth the plumule, which is\r\nplainly visible in the seed, as a pair of incipient leaves; and these\r\nform the first actual foliage.\r\n\r\n25. Very similar is the germination of the Beech (Fig. 31-33), except\r\nthat the caulicle lengthens less, hardly raising the cotyledons out of\r\nthe ground. Nothing would be gained by elevating them, as they never\r\ngrow out into efficient leaves; but the joint of stem belonging to the\r\nplumule lengthens well, carrying up its pair of real foliage-leaves.\r\n\r\n26. It is nearly the same in the Bean of the Old World (Vicia Faba, here\r\ncalled Horse Bean and Windsor Bean): the caulicle lengthens very little,\r\ndoes not undertake to elevate the heavy seed, which is left below or\r\nupon the surface of the soil, the flat but thick cotyledons remaining\r\nin it, and supplying food for the growth of the root below and the\r\nplumule above. In its near relative, the Pea (Fig. 34, 35), this use of\r\ncotyledons for storage only is most completely carried out. For they are\r\nthickened to the utmost, even into hemispheres; the caulicle does not\r\nlengthen at all; merely sends out roots from the lower end, and develops\r\nits strong plumule from the upper, the seed remaining unmoved\r\nunderground. That is, in technical language, the germination is\r\n_hypogaeous_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Embryo of Pumpkin-seed, partly opened. 27. Young\r\nseedling of same.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Embryo of Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris):\r\ncaulicle bent down over edge of cotyledons. 29. Same germinating:\r\ncaulicle well lengthened and root beginning; thick cotyledons partly\r\nspreading; and plumule (pair of leaves) growing between them. 30. Same,\r\nolder, with plumule developed into internode and pair of leaves.]\r\n\r\n27. There is sufficient nourishment in the cotyledons of a pea to make a\r\nvery considerable growth before any actual foliage is required. So it is\r\nthe stem-portion of the plumule which is at first conspicuous and\r\nstrong-growing. Here, as seen in Fig. 35, its lower nodes bear each a\r\nuseless leaf-scale instead of an efficient leaf, and only the later ones\r\nbear leaves fitted for foliage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. A Beech-nut, cut across. 32. Beginning\r\ngermination of the Beech, showing the plumule growing before the\r\ncotyledons have opened or the root has scarcely formed. 33. The same, a\r\nlittle later, with the plumule-leaves developing, and elevated on a long\r\ninternode.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. Embryo of Pea, i. e. a pea with the coats\r\nremoved; the short and thick caulicle presented to view. 35. Same in\r\nadvanced germination: the plumule has developed four or five internodes,\r\nbearing single leaves; but the first and second leaves are mere scales,\r\nthe third begins to serve as foliage; the next more so.]\r\n\r\n28. This _hypogaeous_ germination is exemplified on a larger scale by the\r\nOak (Fig. 36, 37) and Horse-chestnut (Fig. 38, 39); but in these the\r\ndownward growth is wholly a stout tap-root. It is not the caulicle; for\r\nthis lengthens hardly any. Indeed, the earliest growth which carries the\r\nvery short caulicle out of the shell comes from the formation of\r\nfoot-stalks to the cotyledons; above these develops the strong plumule,\r\nbelow grows the stout root. The growth is at first entirely, for a long\r\ntime mainly, at the expense of the great store of food in the\r\ncotyledons. These, after serving their purpose, decay and fall away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. Half of an acorn, cut lengthwise, filled by the\r\nvery thick cotyledons, the base of which encloses the minute caulicle.\r\n37. Oak-seedling.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Half of a horse-chestnut, similarly cut; the\r\ncaulicle is curved down on the side of one of the thick cotyledons. 39.\r\nHorse-chestnut in germination; foot-stalks are formed to the cotyledons,\r\npushing out in their lengthening the growing parts.]\r\n\r\n29. Such thick cotyledons never separate; indeed, they sometimes grow\r\ntogether by some part of their contiguous faces; so that the germination\r\nseems to proceed from a solid bulb-like mass. This is the case in a\r\nhorse-chestnut.\r\n\r\n30. =Germinating Embryo supplied by its own Store of Nourishment=, i. e.\r\nthe store in the cotyledons. This is so in all the illustrations thus\r\nfar, essentially so even in the Flax. This nourishment was supplied by\r\nthe mother plant to the ovule and seed, and thence taken into the embryo\r\nduring its growth. Such embryos, filling the whole seed, are\r\ncomparatively large and strong, and vigorous in germination in\r\nproportion to the amount of their growth while connected with the parent\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n31. =Germinating Embryo supplied from a Deposit outside of Itself.= This\r\nis as common as the other mode; and it occurs in all degrees. Some\r\nseeds have very little of this deposit, but a comparatively large\r\nembryo, with its parts more or less developed and recognizable. In\r\nothers this deposit forms the main bulk of the seed, and the embryo is\r\nsmall or minute, and comparatively rudimentary. The following\r\nillustrations exemplify these various grades. When an embryo in a seed\r\nis thus surrounded by a white substance, it was natural to liken the\r\nlatter to the white of an egg, and the embryo or germ to the yolk. So\r\nthe matter around or by the side of the embryo was called the _Albumen_,\r\ni. e. the white of the seed. The analogy is not very good; and to avoid\r\nambiguity some botanists call it the ENDOSPERM. As that means in English\r\nmerely the inwards of a seed, the new name is little better than the old\r\none; and, since we do not change names in botany except when it cannot\r\nbe avoided, this name of _albumen_ is generally kept up. A seed with\r\nsuch a deposit is _albuminous_, one with none is _exalbuminous_.\r\n\r\n32. The ALBUMEN forms the main bulk of the seed in wheat, maize, rice,\r\nbuckwheat, and the like. It is the floury part of the seed. Also of the\r\ncocoa-nut, of coffee (where it is dense and hard), etc.; while in peas,\r\nbeans, almonds, and in most edible nuts, the store of food, although\r\nessentially the same in nature and in use, is in the embryo itself, and\r\ntherefore is not counted as anything to be separately named. In both\r\nforms this concentrated food for the germinating plant is food also for\r\nman and for animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Seed of Morning Glory divided, moderately\r\nmagnified; shows a longitudinal section through the centre of the embryo\r\nas it lies crumpled in the albumen. 41. Embryo taken out whole and\r\nunfolded; the broad and very thin cotyledons notched at summit; the\r\ncaulicle below. 42. Early state of germination. 43. Same, more advanced;\r\ncaulicle or primary stem, cotyledons or seed-leaves, and below, the\r\nroot, well developed.]\r\n\r\n33. For an albuminous seed with a well-developed embryo, the common\r\nMorning Glory (Ipomoea purpurea, Fig. 40-43) is a convenient example,\r\nbeing easy and prompt to grow, and having all the parts well apparent.\r\nThe seeds (duly soaked for examination) and the germination should be\r\ncompared with those of Sugar and Red Maple (19-21). The only essential\r\ndifference is that here the embryo is surrounded by and crumpled up in\r\nthe albumen. This substance, which is pulpy or mucilaginous in fresh and\r\nyoung seeds, hardens as the seed ripens, but becomes again pulpy in\r\ngermination; and, as it liquefies, the thin cotyledons absorb it by\r\ntheir whole surface. It supplements the nutritive matter contained in\r\nthe embryo. Both together form no large store, but sufficient for\r\nestablishing the seedling, with tiny root, stem, and pair of leaves for\r\ninitiating its independent growth; which in due time proceeds as in Fig.\r\n44, 45.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Seedling of Morning Glory more advanced (root\r\ncut away); cotyledons well developed into foliage-leaves: succeeding\r\ninternode and leaf well developed, and the next forming. 45. Seedling\r\nmore advanced; reduced to much below natural size.]\r\n\r\n34. Smaller embryos, less developed in the seed, are more dependent upon\r\nthe extraneous supply of food. The figures 46-53 illustrate four grades\r\nin this respect. The smallest, that of the Peony, is still large enough\r\nto be seen with a hand magnifying glass, and even its cotyledons may be\r\ndiscerned by the aid of a simple stage microscope.\r\n\r\n35. The broad cotyledons of Mirabilis, or Four-o'clock (Fig. 52, 53),\r\nwith the slender caulicle almost encircle and enclose the floury\r\nalbumen, instead of being enclosed in it, as in the other illustrations.\r\nEvidently here the germinating embryo is principally fed by one of the\r\nleaf-like cotyledons, the other being out of contact with the supply. In\r\nthe embryo of Abronia (Fig. 54, 55), a near relative of Mirabilis, there\r\nis a singular modification; one cotyledon is almost wanting, being\r\nreduced to a rudiment, leaving it for the other to do the work. This\r\nleads to the question of the\r\n\r\n36. =Number of Cotyledons.= In all the preceding illustrations, the\r\nembryo, however different in shape and degree of development, is\r\nevidently constructed upon one and the same plan, namely, that of two\r\nleaves on a caulicle or initial stem,--a plan which is obvious even when\r\none cotyledon becomes very much smaller than the other, as in the rare\r\ninstance of Abronia (Fig. 54, 55). In other words, the embryos so far\r\nexamined are all\r\n\r\n37. =Dicotyledonous=, that is, two-cotyledoned. Plants which are thus\r\nsimilar in the plan of the embryo agree likewise in the general\r\nstructure of their stems, leaves, and blossoms; and thus form a class,\r\nnamed from their embryo DICOTYLEDONES, or in English, DICOTYLEDONOUS\r\nPLANTS. So long a name being inconvenient, it may be shortened into\r\nDICOTYLS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. Section of a seed of a Peony, showing a very\r\nsmall embryo in the albumen, near one end. 47. This embryo detached, and\r\nmore magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. Section of a seed of Barberry, showing the\r\nstraight embryo in the middle of the albumen. 49. Its embryo detached.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. Section of a Potato seed, showing the embryo\r\ncoiled in the albumen. 51. Its embryo detached.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.

Embryo of Abronia umbellata; one of the\r\ncotyledons very small. 55. Same straightened out.]\r\n\r\n38. =Polycotyledonous= is a name employed for the less usual case in\r\nwhich there are more than two cotyledons. The Pine is the most familiar\r\ncase. This occurs in all Pines, the number of cotyledons varying from\r\nthree to twelve; in Fig. 56, 57 they are six. Note that they are all on\r\nthe same level, that is, belong to the same node, so as to form a circle\r\nor _whorl_ at the summit of the caulicle. When there are only three\r\ncotyledons, they divide the space equally, are one third of the circle\r\napart. When only two they are 180 deg. apart, that is, are _opposite_.\r\n\r\n39. The case of three or more cotyledons, which is constant in Pines and\r\nin some of their relatives (but not in all of them), is occasional among\r\nDicotyls. And the polycotyledonous is only a variation of the\r\ndicotyledonous type,--a difference in the number of leaves in the whorl;\r\nfor a pair is a whorl reduced to two members. Some suppose that there\r\nare really only two cotyledons even in a Pine embryo, but these divided\r\nor split up congenitally so as to imitate a greater number. But as\r\nleaves are often in whorls on ordinary stems, they may be so at the very\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56. Section of a Pine-seed, showing its\r\npolycotyledonous embryo in the centre of the albumen, moderately\r\nmagnified. 57. Seedling of same, showing the freshly expanded six\r\ncotyledons in a whorl, and the plumule just appearing.]\r\n\r\n40. =Monocotyledonous= (meaning with single cotyledon) is the name of\r\nthe one-cotyledoned sort of embryo. This goes along with peculiarities\r\nin stem, leaves, and flowers, which all together associate such plants\r\ninto a great class, called MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS, or, for shortness,\r\nMONOCOTYLS. It means merely that the leaves are alternate from the very\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. Section of a seed of the Iris, or\r\nFlower-de-Luce, enlarged, showing its small embryo in the albumen, near\r\nthe bottom. 59. A germinating seedling of the same, its plumule\r\ndeveloped into the first four leaves (alternate), the first one\r\nrudimentary, the cotyledon remains in the seed.]\r\n\r\n41. In Iris (Fig. 58, 59) the embryo in the seed is a small cylinder at\r\none end of the mass of the albumen, with no apparent distinction of\r\nparts. The end which almost touches the seed coat is caulicle, the other\r\nend belongs to the solitary cotyledon. In germination the whole\r\nlengthens (but mainly the cotyledon) only enough to push the proximate\r\nend fairly out of the seed; from this end the root is formed, and from a\r\nlittle higher the plumule later emerges. It would appear therefore that\r\nthe cotyledon answers to a minute leaf rolled up, and that a chink\r\nthrough which the plumule grows out is a part of the inrolled edges. The\r\nembryo of Indian Corn shows these parts on a larger scale and in a more\r\nopen state (Fig. 66-68). There, in the seed, the cotyledon remains,\r\nimbibing nourishment from the softened albumen, and transmitting it to\r\nthe growing root below and new-forming leaves above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Section of an Onion seed showing the slender and\r\ncoiled embryo in the albumen, moderately magnified. 61. Seed of same in\r\nearly germination.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. Germinating Onion, more advanced, the chink at\r\nbase of cotyledon opening for the protrusion of the plumule, consisting\r\nof a thread-shaped leaf. 63.

The embryo taken out whole; the thick mass is\r\nthe cotyledon, the narrow body partly enclosed by it is the plumule, the\r\nlittle projection at its base is the very short radicle enclosed in the\r\nsheathing base of the first leaf of the plumule.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. Grain of Indian Corn in germination, the\r\nascending sprout is the first leaf of the plumule, enclosing the younger\r\nleaves within, at its base the primary root has broken through. 70. The\r\nsame, advanced; the second and third leaves developing, while the\r\nsheathing first leaf does not further develop.]\r\n\r\n42. The general plan is the same in the Onion (Fig. 60-65), but with a\r\nstriking difference. The embryo is long, and coiled in the albumen of\r\nthe seed. To ordinary examination it shows no distinction of parts. But\r\ngermination plainly shows that all except the lower end of it is\r\ncotyledon. For after it has lengthened into a long thread, the chink\r\nfrom which the plumule in time emerges is seen at the base, or near it,\r\nso the caulicle is extremely short, and does not elongate, but sends out\r\nfrom its base a simple root, and afterwards others in a cluster. Not\r\nonly does the cotyledon lengthen enormously in the seedling, but (unlike\r\nthat of Iris, Indian Corn, and all the cereal grains) it raises the\r\ncomparatively light seed into the air, the tip still remaining in the\r\nseed and feeding upon the albumen. When this food is exhausted and the\r\nseedling is well established in the soil, the upper end decays and the\r\nemptied husk of the seed falls away.\r\n\r\n43. In Maize or Indian Corn (Fig. 66-70), the embryo is more developed\r\nin the seed, and its parts can be made out. It lies against the starchy\r\nalbumen, but is not enclosed therein. The larger part of it is the\r\ncotyledon, thickish, its edges involute, and its back in contact with\r\nthe albumen; partly enclosed by it is the well-developed plumule or bud\r\nwhich is to grow. For the cotyledon remains in the seed to fulfil its\r\noffice of imbibing nourishment from the softened albumen, which it\r\nconveys to the growing sprout; the part of this sprout which is visible\r\nis the first leaf of the plumule rolled up into a sheath and enclosing\r\nthe rudiments of the succeeding leaves, at the base enclosing even the\r\nminute caulicle. In germination the first leaf of the plumule develops\r\nonly as a sort of sheath, protecting the tender parts within; the second\r\nand the third form the first foliage. The caulicle never lengthens: the\r\nfirst root, which is formed at its lower end, or from any part of it,\r\nhas to break through the enclosing sheath; and succeeding roots soon\r\nspring from all or any of the nodes of the plumule.\r\n\r\n44. =Simple-stemmed Plants= are thus built up, by the continuous\r\nproduction of one leaf-bearing portion of stem from the summit of the\r\npreceding one, beginning with the initial stem (or caulicle) in the\r\nembryo. Some Dicotyls and many Monocotyls develop only in this single\r\nline of growth (as to parts above ground) until the flowering state is\r\napproached. For some examples, see Cycas (Fig. 71, front, at the left);\r\na tall Yucca or Spanish Bayonet, and two Cocoa-nut Palms behind; at the\r\nright, a group of Sugar-canes, and a Banana behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Simple-stemmed vegetation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection IV. GROWTH FROM BUDS: BRANCHING.\r\n\r\n\r\n45. Most plants increase the amount of their vegetation by branching,\r\nthat is, by producing lateral shoots.\r\n\r\n46. Roots branch from any part and usually without definite order. Stems\r\nnormally give rise to branches only at definite points, namely, at the\r\nnodes, and there only from the axils of leaves.\r\n\r\n47. =Buds= (Fig. 72, 73). Every incipient shoot is a _Bud_ (12). A stem\r\ncontinues its growth by its _terminal bud_; it branches by the formation\r\nand development of _lateral buds_. As normal lateral buds occupy the\r\naxils of leaves, they are called _axillary buds_. As leaves are\r\nsymmetrically arranged on the stem, the buds in their axils and the\r\nbranches into which axillary buds grow partake of this symmetry. The\r\nmost conspicuous buds are the scaly winter-buds of most shrubs and trees\r\nof temperate and cold climates; but the name belongs as well to the\r\nforming shoot or branch of any herb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Shoot of Horse-chestnut, of one year's growth,\r\ntaken in autumn after the leaves have fallen; showing the large terminal\r\nbud and smaller axillary buds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Similar shoot of Shagbark Hickory, Carya alba.]\r\n\r\n48. =The Terminal Bud=, in the most general sense, may be said to exist\r\nin the embryo,--as cotyledons, or the cotyledons and plumule,--and to\r\ncrown each successive growth of the simple stem so long as the summit is\r\ncapable of growth. The whole ascending growth of the Palm, Cycas, and\r\nthe like (such as in Fig. 71) is from a terminal bud. Branches, being\r\nrepetitions of the main stem and growing in the same way, are also\r\nlengthened by terminal buds. Those of Horse-chestnut, Hickory, Maples,\r\nand such trees, being the resting buds of winter, are conspicuous by\r\ntheir protective covering of scales. These bud-scales, as will hereafter\r\nbe shown, are themselves a kind of leaves.\r\n\r\n49. =Axillary Buds= were formed on these annual shoots early in the\r\nsummer. Occasionally they grow the same season into branches; at least,\r\nsome of them are pretty sure to do so whenever the growing terminal bud\r\nat the end of the shoot is injured or destroyed. Otherwise they may lie\r\ndormant until the following spring. In many trees or shrubs these\r\naxillary buds do not show themselves until spring; but if searched for,\r\nthey may be detected, though of small size, hidden under the bark.\r\nSometimes, although early formed, they are concealed all summer long\r\nunder the base of the leaf-stalk, which is then hollowed out into a sort\r\nof inverted cup, like a candle-extinguisher, to cover them; as in the\r\nLocust, the Yellow-wood, or more strikingly in the Button-wood or\r\nPlane-tree (Fig. 74).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. An axillary bud, concealed under the hollowed\r\nbase of the leaf-stalk, in Buttonwood or Plane-tree.]\r\n\r\n50. The _leaf-scars_, so conspicuous in Fig. 72, 73, under each axillary\r\nbud, mark the place where the stalk of the subtending leaf was attached\r\nuntil it fell in autumn.\r\n\r\n51. =Scaly Buds=, which are well represented in Fig. 72, 73, commonly\r\nbelong to trees and shrubs of countries in which growth is suspended\r\nduring winter. The scaly coverings protect the tender young parts\r\nbeneath, not so much by keeping out the cold, which of course would\r\npenetrate the bud in time, as by shielding the interior from the effects\r\nof sudden changes. There are all gradations between these and\r\n\r\n52. =Naked Buds=, in which these scales are inconspicuous or wanting, as\r\nin most herbs, at least above ground, and most tropical trees and\r\nshrubs. But nearly related plants of the same climate may differ widely\r\nin this respect. Rhododendrons have strong and scaly winter-buds; while\r\nin Kalmia they are naked. One species of Viburnum, the Hobble-bush, has\r\ncompletely naked buds, what would be a pair of scales developing into\r\nthe first leaves in spring; while another (the Snowball) has conspicuous\r\nscaly buds.\r\n\r\n53. =Vigor of Vegetation from strong buds.= Large and strong buds, like\r\nthose of the Horse-chestnut, Hickory, and the like, contain several\r\nleaves, or pairs of leaves, ready formed, folded and packed away in\r\nsmall compass, just as the seed-leaves of a strong embryo are packed\r\naway in the seed: they may even contain all the blossoms of the ensuing\r\nseason, plainly visible as small buds. And the stems upon which these\r\nbuds rest are filled with abundant nourishment, which was deposited the\r\nsummer before in the wood or in the bark. Under the surface of the\r\nsoil, or on it covered with the fallen leaves of autumn, similar strong\r\nbuds of our perennial herbs may be found; while beneath are thick roots,\r\nrootstocks, or tubers, charged with a great store of nourishment for\r\ntheir use. This explains how it is that vegetation from such buds shoots\r\nforth so vigorously in the spring of the year, and clothes the bare and\r\nlately frozen surface of the soil, as well as the naked boughs of trees,\r\nvery promptly with a covering of fresh green, and often with brilliant\r\nblossoms. Everything was prepared, and even formed, beforehand: the\r\nshort joints of stem in the bud have only to lengthen, and to separate\r\nthe leaves from each other so that they may unfold and grow. Only a\r\nsmall part of the vegetation of the season comes directly from the seed,\r\nand none of the earliest vernal vegetation. This is all from buds which\r\nhave lived through the winter.\r\n\r\n54. =The Arrangement of Branches=, being that of axillary buds, answers\r\nto that of the leaves. Now leaves principally are either _opposite_ or\r\n_alternate_. Leaves are _opposite_ when there are two from the same\r\njoint of stem, as in Maples (Fig. 20), the two being on opposite sides\r\nof the stem; and so the axillary buds and branches are opposite, as in\r\nFig. 75. Leaves are _alternate_ when there is only one from each joint\r\nof stem, as in the Oak, Lime-tree, Poplar, Button-wood (Fig. 74),\r\nMorning-Glory (Fig. 45,--not counting the seed-leaves, which of course\r\nare opposite, there being a pair of them); also in Indian Corn (Fig.\r\n70), and Iris (Fig. 59). Consequently the axillary buds are also\r\nalternate, as in Hickory (Fig. 73); and the branches they form\r\nalternate,--making a different kind of spray from the other mode, one\r\nbranch shooting on one side of the stem and the next on some other. For\r\nin the alternate arrangement no leaf is on the same side of the stem as\r\nthe one next above or next below it.\r\n\r\n55. But the symmetry of branches (unlike that of the leaves) is rarely\r\ncomplete. This is due to several causes, and most commonly to the\r\n\r\n56. =Non-development of buds.= It never happens that all the buds grow.\r\nIf they did, there might be as many branches in any year as there were\r\nleaves the year before. And of those which do begin to grow, a large\r\nportion perish, sooner or later, for want of nourishment, or for want of\r\nlight, or because those which first begin to grow have an advantage,\r\nwhich they are apt to keep, taking to themselves the nourishment of the\r\nstem, and starving the weaker buds. In the Horse-chestnut (Fig. 72),\r\nHickory (Fig. 73), Magnolia, and most other trees with large scaly buds,\r\nthe terminal bud is the strongest, and has the advantage in growth; and\r\nnext in strength are the upper axillary buds: while the former continues\r\nthe shoot of the last year, some of the latter give rise to branches,\r\nand the rest fail to grow. In the Lilac also (Fig. 75), the uppermost\r\naxillary buds are stronger than the lower; but the terminal bud rarely\r\nappears at all; in its place the uppermost pair of axillary buds grow,\r\nand so each stem branches every year into two,--making a repeatedly\r\ntwo-forked ramification, as in Fig. 76.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75. Shoot of Lilac, with winter buds; the two\r\nuppermost axillary ones strong; the terminal not developed. 76. Forking\r\nramification of Lilac; reduced in size.]\r\n\r\n57. =Latent Buds.= Axillary buds that do not grow at the proper season,\r\nand especially those which make no appearance externally, may long\r\nremain latent, and at length upon a favorable occasion start into\r\ngrowth, so forming branches apparently out of place as they are out of\r\ntime. The new shoots seen springing directly out of large stems may\r\nsometimes originate from such latent buds, which have preserved their\r\nlife for years. But commonly these arise from\r\n\r\n58. =Adventitious Buds.= These are buds which certain shrubs and trees\r\nproduce anywhere on the surface of the wood, especially where it has\r\nbeen injured. They give rise to the slender twigs which often feather\r\nthe sides of great branches of our American Elms. They sometimes form on\r\nthe root, which naturally is destitute of buds; they are even found upon\r\nsome leaves; and they are sure to appear on the trunks and roots of\r\nWillows, Poplars, and Chestnuts, when these are wounded or mutilated.\r\nIndeed Osier-Willows are _pollarded_, or cut off, from time to time, by\r\nthe cultivator, for the purpose of producing a crop of slender\r\nadventitious twigs, suitable for basket-work. Such branches, being\r\naltogether irregular, of course interfere with the natural symmetry of\r\nthe tree. Another cause of irregularity, in certain trees and shrubs, is\r\nthe formation of what are called\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. Tartarean Honeysuckle, with three accessory buds\r\nin each axil.]\r\n\r\n59. =Accessory or Supernumerary Buds.= There are cases where two, three,\r\nor more buds spring from the axil of a leaf, instead of the single one\r\nwhich is ordinarily found there. Sometimes they are placed one over the\r\nother, as in the Aristolochia or Pipe-Vine, and in the Tartarean\r\nHoneysuckle (Fig. 77); also in the Honey-Locust, and in the Walnut and\r\nButternut (Fig. 78), where the upper supernumerary bud is a good way\r\nout of the axil and above the others. And this is here stronger than the\r\nothers, and grows into a branch which is considerably out of the axil,\r\nwhile the lower and smaller ones commonly do not grow at all. In other\r\ncases three buds stand side by side in the axil, as in the Hawthorn, and\r\nthe Red Maple (Fig. 79.) If these were all to grow into branches, they\r\nwould stifle each other. But some of them are commonly flower-buds: in\r\nthe Red Maple, only the middle one is a leaf-bud, and it does not grow\r\nuntil after those on each side of it have expanded the blossoms they\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. Butternut branch, with accessory buds, the\r\nuppermost above the axil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79. Red-Maple branch, with accessory buds placed\r\nside by side. The annular lines toward the base in this and in Fig. 72\r\nare scars of the bud-scales, and indicate the place of the winter-bud of\r\nthe preceding year.]\r\n\r\n60. =Sorts of Buds.= It may be useful to enumerate the kinds of buds\r\nwhich have been described or mentioned. They are\r\n\r\n_Terminal_, when they occupy the summit of (or terminate) a stem,\r\n\r\n_Lateral_, when they are borne on the side of a stem; of which the\r\nregular kind is the\r\n\r\n_Axillary_, situated in the axil of a leaf. These are\r\n\r\n_Accessory_ or _Supernumerary_, when they are in addition to the normal\r\nsolitary bud; and these are _Collateral_, when side by side;\r\n_Superposed_, when one above another;\r\n\r\n_Extra-axillary_, when they appear above the axil, as some do when\r\nsuperposed, and as occasionally is the case when single.\r\n\r\n_Naked buds_; those which have no protecting scales.\r\n\r\n_Scaly buds_; those which have protecting scales, which are altered\r\nleaves or bases of leaves.\r\n\r\n_Leaf-buds_, contain or give rise to leaves, and develop into a leafy\r\nshoot.\r\n\r\n_Flower-buds_, contain or consist of blossoms, and no leaves.\r\n\r\n_Mixed buds_, contain both leaves and blossoms.\r\n\r\n61. =Definite annual Growth= from winter buds is marked in most of the\r\nshoots from strong buds, such as those of the Horse-chestnut and Hickory\r\n(Fig. 72, 73). Such a bud generally contains, already formed in\r\nminiature, all or a great part of the leaves and joints of stem it is to\r\nproduce, makes its whole growth in length in the course of a few weeks,\r\nor sometimes even in a few days, and then forms and ripens its buds for\r\nthe next year's similar growth.\r\n\r\n62. =Indefinite annual Growth=, on the other hand, is well marked in\r\nsuch trees or shrubs as the Honey-Locust, Sumac, and in sterile shoots\r\nof the Rose, Blackberry, and Raspberry. That is, these shoots are apt\r\nto grow all summer long, until stopped by the frosts of autumn or some\r\nother cause. Consequently they form and ripen no terminal bud protected\r\nby scales, and the upper axillary buds are produced so late in the\r\nseason that they have no time to mature, nor has their wood time to\r\nsolidify and ripen. Such stems therefore commonly die back from the top\r\nin winter, or at least all their upper buds are small and feeble; so the\r\ngrowth of the succeeding year takes place mainly from the lower axillary\r\nbuds, which are more mature.\r\n\r\n63. =Deliquescent and Excurrent Growth.= In the former case, and\r\nwherever axillary buds take the lead, there is, of course, no single\r\nmain stem, continued year after year in a direct line, but the trunk is\r\nsoon lost in the branches. Trees so formed commonly have rounded or\r\nspreading tops. Of such trees with _deliquescent_ stems,--that is, with\r\nthe trunk dissolved, as it were, into the successively divided\r\nbranches,--the common American Elm (Fig. 80) is a good illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. An American Elm, with Spruce-trees, and on the\r\nleft Arbor Vitae.]\r\n\r\n64. On the other hand, the main stem of Firs and Spruces, unless\r\ndestroyed by some injury, is carried on in a direct line throughout the\r\nwhole growth of the tree, by the development year after year of a\r\nterminal bud: this forms a single, uninterrupted shaft,--an _excurrent_\r\ntrunk, which cannot be confounded with the branches that proceed from\r\nit. Of such _spiry_ or _spire-shaped_ trees, the Firs or Spruces are\r\ncharacteristic and familiar examples. There are all gradations between\r\nthe two modes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection V. ROOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n65. It is a property of stems to produce roots. Stems do not spring from\r\nroots in ordinary cases, as is generally thought, but roots from stems.\r\nWhen perennial herbs arise from the ground, as they do at spring-time,\r\nthey rise from subterranean stems.\r\n\r\n66. =The Primary Root= is a downward growth from the root-end of the\r\ncaulicle, that is, of the initial stem of the embryo (Fig. 5-7, 81). If\r\nit goes on to grow it makes a _main_ or _tap-root_, as in Fig. 37, etc.\r\nSome plants keep this main root throughout their whole life, and send\r\noff only small side branches; as in the Carrot and Radish: and in\r\nvarious trees, like the Oak, it takes the lead of the side-branches for\r\nseveral years, unless accidentally injured, as a strong tap-root. But\r\ncommonly the main root divides off very soon, and is lost in the\r\nbranches. _Multiple primary roots_ now and then occur, as in the\r\nseedling of Pumpkin (Fig. 27), where a cluster is formed even at the\r\nfirst, from the root-end of the caulicle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81. Seedling Maple, of the natural size; the root\r\nwell supplied with root hairs, here large enough to be seen by the naked\r\neye. 82. Lower end of this root, magnified, the root seen just as\r\nroot-hairs are beginning to form a little behind the tip.]\r\n\r\n67. =Secondary Roots= are those which arise from other parts of the\r\nstem. Any part of the stem may produce them, but they most readily come\r\nfrom the nodes. As a general rule they naturally spring, or may be made\r\nto spring, from almost any young stem, when placed in favorable\r\ncircumstances,--that is, when placed in the soil, or otherwise supplied\r\nwith moisture and screened from the light. For the special tendency of\r\nthe root is to avoid the light, seek moisture, and therefore to bury\r\nitself in the soil. _Propagation by division_, which is so common and so\r\nvery important in cultivation, depends upon the proclivity of stems to\r\nstrike root. Stems or branches which remain under ground give out roots\r\nas freely as roots themselves give off branches. Stems which creep on\r\nthe ground most commonly root at the joints; so will most branches when\r\nbent to the ground, as in propagation by _layering_; and propagation by\r\n_cuttings_ equally depends upon the tendency of the cut end of a shoot\r\nto produce roots. Thus, a piece of a plant which has stem and leaves,\r\neither developed or in the bud, may be made to produce roots, and so\r\nbecome an independent plant.\r\n\r\n68. =Contrast between Stem and Root.= Stems are ascending axes; roots\r\nare descending axes. Stems grow by the successive development of\r\ninternodes (13), one after another, each leaf-bearing at its summit (or\r\nnode); so that it is of the essential nature of a stem to bear leaves.\r\nRoots bear no leaves, are not distinguishable into nodes and internodes,\r\nbut grow on continuously from the lower end. They commonly branch\r\nfreely, but not from any fixed points nor in definite order.\r\n\r\n69. Although roots generally do not give rise to stems, and therefore do\r\nnot propagate the plant, exceptions are not uncommon. For as stems may\r\nproduce adventitious buds, so also may roots. The roots of the Sweet\r\nPotato among herbs, and of the Osage Orange among trees freely produce\r\nadventitious buds, developing into leafy shoots; and so these plants are\r\npropagated by _root-cuttings_. But most growths of subterranean origin\r\nwhich pass for roots are forms of stems, the common Potato for example.\r\n\r\n70. Roots of ordinary kinds and uses may be roughly classed into\r\n_fibrous_ and _fleshy_.\r\n\r\n71. =Fibrous Roots=, such as those of Indian Corn (Fig. 70), of most\r\nannuals, and of many perennials, serve only for absorption: these are\r\nslender or thread-like. Fine roots of this kind, and the fine branches\r\nwhich most roots send out are called ROOTLETS.\r\n\r\n72. The whole surface of a root absorbs moisture from the soil while\r\nfresh and new; and the newer roots and rootlets are, the more freely do\r\nthey imbibe. Accordingly, as long as the plant grows above ground, and\r\nexpands fresh foliage, from which moisture largely escapes into the air,\r\nso long it continues to extend and multiply its roots in the soil\r\nbeneath, renewing and increasing the fresh surface for absorbing\r\nmoisture, in proportion to the demand from above. And when growth ceases\r\nabove ground, and the leaves die and fall, or no longer act, then the\r\nroots generally stop growing, and their soft and tender tips harden.\r\nFrom this period, therefore, until growth begins anew the next spring,\r\nis the best time for transplanting; especially for trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\n73. The absorbing surface of young roots is much increased by the\r\nformation, near their tips, of ROOT-HAIRS (Fig. 81, 82), which are\r\ndelicate tubular outgrowths from the surface, through the delicate walls\r\nof which moisture is promptly imbibed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83-85. Forms of tap-root.]\r\n\r\n74. =Fleshy Roots= are those in which the root becomes a storehouse of\r\nnourishment. Typical roots of this kind are those of such biennials as\r\nthe turnip and carrot; in which the food created in the first season's\r\nvegetation is accumulated, to be expended the next season in a vigorous\r\ngrowth and a rapid development of flowers, fruit, and seed. By the time\r\nthe seed is matured the exhausted root dies, and with it the whole\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n75. Fleshy roots may be single or multiple. The single root of the\r\ncommoner biennials is the primary root, or tap-root, which begins to\r\nthicken in the seedling. Names are given to its shapes, such as\r\n\r\n_Conical_, when it thickens most at the crown, or where it joins the\r\nstem, and tapers regularly downwards to a point, as in the Parsnip and\r\nCarrot (Fig. 84);\r\n\r\n_Turnip-shaped_ or _napiform_, when greatly thickened above, but\r\nabruptly becoming slender below; as the Turnip (Fig. 83); and\r\n\r\n_Spindle-shaped_, or _Fusiform_, when thickest in the middle and\r\ntapering to both ends; as the common Radish (Fig. 85).\r\n\r\n76. These examples are of primary roots. It will be seen that turnips,\r\ncarrots, and the like, are not pure root throughout; for the caulicle,\r\nfrom the lower end of which the root grew, partakes of the thickening,\r\nperhaps also some joints of stem above: so the bud-bearing and growing\r\ntop is stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. Sweet-Potato plant forming thickened roots. Some\r\nin the middle are just beginning to thicken; one at the left has grown\r\nmore; one at the right is still larger.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87. Fascicled fusiform roots of a Dahlia: _a_, _a_,\r\nbuds on base of stem.]\r\n\r\n77. A fine example of secondary roots (67), some of which remain fibrous\r\nfor absorption, while a few thicken and store up food for the next\r\nseason's growth, is furnished by the Sweet Potato (Fig. 86). As stated\r\nabove, these are used for propagation by cuttings; for any part will\r\nproduce adventitious buds and shoots. The Dahlia produces _fascicled_\r\n(i. e. clustered) fusiform roots of the same kind, at the base of the\r\nstem (Fig. 87): but these, like most roots, do not produce adventitious\r\nbuds. The buds by which Dahlias are propagated belong to the surviving\r\nbase of the stem above.\r\n\r\n78. =Anomalous Roots=, as they may be called, are those which subserve\r\nother uses than absorption, food-storing, and fixing the plant to the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n_Aerial Roots_, i. e. those that strike from stems in the open air, are\r\ncommon in moist and warm climates, as in the Mangrove which reaches the\r\ncoast of Florida, the Banyan, and, less strikingly, in some herbaceous\r\nplants, such as Sugar Cane, and even in Indian Corn. Such roots reach\r\nthe ground at length, or tend to do so.\r\n\r\n_Aerial Rootlets_ are abundantly produced by many climbing plants, such\r\nas the Ivy, Poison Ivy, Trumpet Creeper, etc., springing from the side\r\nof stems, which they fasten to trunks of trees, walls, or other\r\nsupports. These are used by the plant for climbing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88. Epiphytes of Florida and Georgia, viz.,\r\nEpidendrum conopseum, a small Orchid, and Tillandsia usneoides, the\r\nso-called Long Moss or Black Moss, which is no moss, but a flowering\r\nplant, also _T. recurvata_; on a bough of Live Oak.]\r\n\r\n79. =Epiphytes, or Air-Plants= (Fig. 88), are called by the former name\r\nbecause commonly growing upon the trunks or limbs of other plants; by\r\nthe latter because, having no connection with the soil, they must derive\r\ntheir sustenance from the air only. They have aerial roots, which do not\r\nreach the ground, but are used to fix the plant to the surface upon\r\nwhich the plant grows: they also take a part in absorbing moisture from\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n80. =Parasitic Plants=, of which there are various kinds, strike their\r\nroots, or what answer to roots, into the tissue of foster plants, or\r\nform attachments with their surface, so as to prey upon their juices. Of\r\nthis sort is the Mistletoe, the seed of which germinates on the bough\r\nwhere it falls or is left by birds; and the forming root penetrates the\r\nbark and engrafts itself into the wood, to which it becomes united as\r\nfirmly as a natural branch to its parent stem; and indeed the parasite\r\nlives just as if it were a branch of the tree it grows and feeds on. A\r\nmost common parasitic herb is the Dodder; which abounds in low grounds\r\nin summer, and coils its long and slender, leafless, yellowish\r\nstems--resembling tangled threads of yarn--round and round the stalks of\r\nother plants; wherever they touch piercing the bark with minute and very\r\nshort rootlets in the form of suckers, which draw out the nourishing\r\njuices of the plants laid hold of. Other parasitic plants, like the\r\nBeech-drops and Pine-sap, fasten their roots under ground upon the roots\r\nof neighboring plants, and rob them of their juices.\r\n\r\n81. Some plants are partly parasitic; while most of their roots act in\r\nthe ordinary way, others make suckers at their tips which grow fast to\r\nthe roots of other plants and rob them of nourishment. Some of our\r\nspecies of Gerardia do this (Fig. 89).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89. Roots of Yellow Gerardia, some attached to and\r\nfeeding on the root of a Blueberry-bush.]\r\n\r\n82. There are phanerogamous plants, like Monotropa or Indian Pipe, the\r\nroots of which feed mainly on decaying vegetable matter in the soil.\r\nThese are SAPROPHYTES, and they imitate Mushrooms and other Fungi in\r\ntheir mode of life.\r\n\r\n83. =Duration of Roots, etc.= Roots are said to be either _annual_,\r\n_biennial_, or _perennial_. As respects the first and second, these\r\nterms may be applied either to the root or to the plant.\r\n\r\n84. =Annuals=, as the name denotes, live for only one year, generally\r\nfor only a part of the year. They are of course herbs; they spring from\r\nthe seed, blossom, mature their fruit and seed, and then die, root and\r\nall. Annuals of our temperate climates with severe winters start from\r\nthe seed in spring, and perish at or before autumn. Where the winter is\r\na moist and growing season and the summer is dry, _winter annuals_\r\nprevail; their seeds germinate under autumn or winter rains, grow more\r\nor less during winter, blossom, fructify, and perish in the following\r\nspring or summer. Annuals are fibrous-rooted.\r\n\r\n85. =Biennials=, of which the Turnip, Beet, and Carrot are familiar\r\nexamples, grow the first season without blossoming, usually thicken\r\ntheir roots, laying up in them a stock of nourishment, are quiescent\r\nduring the winter, but shoot vigorously, blossom, and seed the next\r\nspring or summer, mainly at the expense of the food stored up, and then\r\ndie completely. Annuals and biennials flower only once; hence they have\r\nbeen called _Monocarpic_ (that is, once-fruiting) plants.\r\n\r\n86. =Perennials= live and blossom year after year. A perennial herb, in\r\na temperate or cooler climate, usually dies down to the ground at the\r\nend of the season's growth. But subterranean portions of stem, charged\r\nwith buds, survive to renew the development. Shrubs and trees are of\r\ncourse perennial; even the stems and branches above ground live on and\r\ngrow year after year.\r\n\r\n87. There are all gradations between annuals and biennials, and between\r\nthese and perennials, as also between herbs and shrubs; and the\r\ndistinction between shrubs and trees is quite arbitrary. There are\r\nperennial herbs and even shrubs of warm climates which are annuals when\r\nraised in a climate which has a winter,--being destroyed by frost. The\r\nCastor-oil plant is an example. There are perennial herbs of which only\r\nsmall portions survive, as off-shoots, or, in the Potato, as tubers,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection VI. STEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n88. =The Stem= is the axis of the plant, the part which bears all the\r\nother organs. Branches are secondary stems, that is, stems growing out\r\nof stems. The stem at the very beginning produces roots, in most plants\r\na single root from the base of the embryo-stem, or caulicle. As this\r\nroot becomes a _descending axis_, so the stem, which grows in the\r\nopposite direction is called the _ascending axis_. Rising out of the\r\nsoil, the stem bears leaves; and leaf-bearing is the particular\r\ncharacteristic of the stem. But there are forms of stems that remain\r\nunderground, or make a part of their growth there. These do not bear\r\nleaves, in the common sense; yet they bear rudiments of leaves, or what\r\nanswers to leaves, although not in the form of foliage. The so-called\r\nstemless or _acaulescent_ plants are those which bear no obvious stem\r\n(_caulis_) above ground, but only flower-stalks, and the like.\r\n\r\n89. =Stems above ground=, through differences in duration, texture, and\r\nsize, form herbs, shrubs, trees, etc., or in other terms are\r\n\r\n_Herbaceous_, dying down to the ground every year, or after blossoming.\r\n\r\n_Suffrutescent_, slightly woody below, there surviving from year to\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n_Suffruticose_ or _Frutescent_, when low stems are decidedly woody\r\nbelow, but herbaceous above.\r\n\r\n_Fruticose_ or _Shrubby_, woody, living from year to year, and of\r\nconsiderable size,--not, however, more than three or four times the\r\nheight of a man.\r\n\r\n_Arborescent_, when tree-like in appearance or mode of growth, or\r\napproaching a tree in size.\r\n\r\n_Arboreous_, when forming a proper tree-trunk.\r\n\r\n90. As to direction taken in growing, stems may, instead of growing\r\nupright or erect, be\r\n\r\n_Diffuse_, that is, loosely spreading in all directions.\r\n\r\n_Declined_, when turned or bending over to one side.\r\n\r\n_Decumbent_, reclining on the ground, as if too weak to stand.\r\n\r\n_Assurgent_ or _Ascending_, rising obliquely upwards.\r\n\r\n_Procumbent_ or _Prostrate_, lying flat on the ground from the first.\r\n\r\n_Creeping_ or _Repent_, prostrate on or just beneath the ground, and\r\nstriking root, as does the White Clover, the Partridge-berry, etc.\r\n\r\n_Climbing_ or _Scandent_, ascending by clinging to other objects for\r\nsupport, whether by _tendrils_, as do the Pea, Grape-Vine, and\r\nPassion-flower and Virginia Creeper (Fig. 92, 93); by their twisting\r\nleaf-stalks, as the Virgin's Bower; or by rootlets, like the Ivy, Poison\r\nIvy, and Trumpet Creeper.\r\n\r\n_Twining_ or _Voluble_, when coiling spirally around other stems or\r\nsupports; like the Morning-Glory (Fig. 90) and the Hop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90. Twining or voluble stem of Morning-Glory.]\r\n\r\n91. Certain kinds of stems or branches, appropriated to special uses,\r\nhave received distinct substantive names; such as the following:\r\n\r\n92. =A Culm=, or straw-stem, such as that of Grasses and Sedges.\r\n\r\n93. =A Caudex= is the old name for such a peculiar trunk as a Palm-stem;\r\nit is also used for an upright and thick rootstock.\r\n\r\n94. =A Sucker= is a branch rising from stems under ground. Such are\r\nproduced abundantly by the Rose, Raspberry, and other plants said to\r\nmultiply \"by the root.\" If we uncover them, we see at once the great\r\ndifference between these subterranean branches and real roots. They are\r\nonly creeping branches under ground. Remarking how the upright shoots\r\nfrom these branches become separate plants, simply by the dying off of\r\nthe connecting under-ground stems, the gardener expedites the result by\r\ncutting them through with his spade. That is, he propagates the plant\r\n\"by division.\"\r\n\r\n95. =A Stolon= is a branch from above ground, which reclines or becomes\r\nprostrate and strikes root (usually from the nodes) wherever it rests on\r\nthe soil. Thence it may send up a vigorous shoot, which has roots of its\r\nown, and becomes an independent plant when the connecting part dies, as\r\nit does after a while. The Currant and the Gooseberry naturally multiply\r\nin this way, as well as by suckers (which are the same thing, only the\r\nconnecting part is concealed under ground). Stolons must have suggested\r\nthe operation of _layering_ by bending down and covering with soil\r\nbranches which do not naturally make stolons; and after they have taken\r\nroot, as they almost always will, the gardener cuts through the\r\nconnecting stem, and so converts a rooting branch into a separate plant.\r\n\r\n96. =An Offset= is a short stolon, or sucker, with a crown of leaves at\r\nthe end, as in the Houseleek (Fig. 91), which propagates abundantly in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91. Houseleek (Sempervivum), with offsets.]\r\n\r\n97. =A Runner=, of which the Strawberry presents the most familiar and\r\ncharacteristic example, is a long and slender, tendril-like stolon, or\r\nbranch from next the ground, destitute of conspicuous leaves. Each\r\nrunner of the Strawberry, after having grown to its full length, strikes\r\nroot from the tip, which fixes it to the ground, then forms a bud there,\r\nwhich develops into a tuft of leaves, and so gives rise to a new plant,\r\nwhich sends out new runners to act in the same way. In this manner a\r\nsingle Strawberry plant will spread over a large space, or produce a\r\ngreat number of plants, in the course of the summer, all connected at\r\nfirst by the slender runners; but these die in the following winter, if\r\nnot before, and leave the plants as so many separate individuals.\r\n\r\n98. =Tendrils= are branches of a very slender sort, like runners, not\r\ndestined like them for propagation, and therefore always destitute of\r\nbuds or leaves, being intended only for climbing. Simple tendrils are\r\nsuch as those of Passion-flowers (Fig. 92). Compound or branching\r\ntendrils are borne by the Cucumber and Pumpkin, by the Grape-Vine,\r\nVirginia Creeper, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92. A small Passion-flower (_Passiflora sicyoides_),\r\nshowing the tendrils.]\r\n\r\n99. A tendril commonly grows straight and outstretched until it reaches\r\nsome neighboring support, such as a stem, when its apex hooks around it\r\nto secure a hold; then the whole tendril shortens itself by coiling up\r\nspirally, and so draws the shoot of the growing plant nearer to the\r\nsupporting object. But the tendrils of the Virginia Creeper (Ampelopsis,\r\nFig. 93), as also the shorter ones of the Japanese species, effect the\r\nobject differently, namely, by expanding the tips of the tendrils into a\r\nflat disk, with an adhesive face. This is applied to the supporting\r\nobject, and it adheres firmly; then a shortening of the tendril and its\r\nbranches by coiling brings up the growing shoot close to the support.\r\nThis is an adaptation for climbing mural rocks or walls, or the trunks\r\nof trees, to which ordinary tendrils are unable to cling. The Ivy and\r\nPoison Ivy attain the same result by means of aerial rootlets (78).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93. Piece of the stem of Virginia Creeper, bearing a\r\nleaf and a tendril. 94. Tips of a tendril, about the natural size,\r\nshowing the disks by which they hold fast to walls, etc.]\r\n\r\n100. Some tendrils are leaves or parts of leaves, as those of the Pea\r\n(Fig. 35). The nature of the tendril is known by its position. A tendril\r\nfrom the axil of a leaf, like that of Passion-flowers (Fig. 92) is of\r\ncourse a stem, i. e. a branch. So is one which terminates a stem, as in\r\nthe Grape-Vine.\r\n\r\n101. =Spines= or =Thorns= (Fig. 95, 96) are commonly stunted and\r\nhardened branches or tips of stems or branches, as are those of\r\nHawthorn, Honey-Locust, etc. In the Pear and Sloe all gradations occur\r\nbetween spines and spine-like (spinescent) branches. Spines may be\r\nreduced and indurated leaves; as in the Barberry, where their nature is\r\nrevealed by their situation, underneath an axillary bud. But prickles,\r\nsuch as those of Blackberry and Roses, are only excrescences of the\r\nbark, and not branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95. A branching thorn of Honey-Locust, being an\r\nindurated leafless branch developed from an accessory bud far above the\r\naxil: at the cut portion below, three other buds (_a_) are concealed\r\nunder the petiole.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. Spine of Cockspur Thorn, developed from an\r\naxillary bud, as the leaf-scar below witnesses: an accessory leaf-bud is\r\nseen at its base.]\r\n\r\n102. Equally strange forms of stems are characteristic of the Cactus\r\nfamily (Fig. 111). These may be better understood by comparison with\r\n\r\n103. =Subterranean Stems and Branches.= These are very numerous and\r\nvarious; but they are commonly overlooked, or else are confounded with\r\nroots. From their situation they are out of ordinary sight; but they\r\nwill well repay examination. For the vegetation that is carried on under\r\nground is hardly less varied or important than that above ground. All\r\ntheir forms may be referred to four principal kinds: namely, the\r\n_Rhizoma_ (_Rhizome_) or _Rootstock_, the _Tuber_, the _Corm_ or solid\r\nbulb, and the true _Bulb_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97. Rootstocks, or creeping subterranean branches,\r\nof the Peppermint.]\r\n\r\n104. =The Rootstock, or Rhizoma=, in its simplest form, is merely a\r\ncreeping stem or branch growing beneath the surface of the soil, or\r\npartly covered by it. Of this kind are the so-called _creeping_,\r\n_running_, or _scaly roots_, such as those by which the Mint (Fig. 97),\r\nthe Couch-grass, or Quick-grass, and many other plants, spread so\r\nrapidly and widely,--\"by the root,\" as it is said. That these are really\r\n_stems_, and not roots, is evident from the way in which they grow;\r\nfrom their consisting of a succession of joints; and from the leaves\r\nwhich they bear on each _node_, in the form of small scales, just like\r\nthe lowest ones on the upright stem next the ground. They also produce\r\nbuds in the axils of these scales, showing the scales to be leaves;\r\nwhereas real roots bear neither leaves nor axillary buds. Placed as they\r\nare in the damp and dark soil, such stems naturally produce roots, just\r\nas the creeping stem does where it lies on the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n105. It is easy to see why plants with these running rootstocks take\r\nsuch rapid and wide possession of the soil, and why they are so hard to\r\nget rid of. They are always perennials; the subterranean shoots live\r\nover the first winter, if not longer, and are provided with vigorous\r\nbuds at every joint. Some of these buds grow in spring into upright\r\nstems, bearing foliage, to elaborate nourishment, and at length produce\r\nblossoms for reproduction by seed; while many others, fed by nourishment\r\nsupplied from above, form a new generation of subterranean shoots; and\r\nthis is repeated over and over in the course of the season or in\r\nsucceeding years. Meanwhile, as the subterranean shoots increase in\r\nnumber, the older ones, connecting the successive growths, die off year\r\nby year, liberating the already rooted side-branches as so many separate\r\nplants; and so on indefinitely. Cutting these running rootstocks into\r\npieces, therefore, by the hoe or the plough, far from destroying the\r\nplant, only accelerates the propagation; it converts one many-branched\r\nplant into a great number of separate individuals. Cutting into pieces\r\nonly multiplies the pest; for each piece (Fig. 98) is already a\r\nplantlet, with its roots and with a bud in the axil of its scale-like\r\nleaf (either latent or apparent), and with prepared nourishment enough\r\nto develop this bud into a leafy stem; and so a single plant is all the\r\nmore speedily converted into a multitude. Whereas, when the subterranean\r\nparts are only roots, cutting away the stem completely destroys the\r\nplant, except in the rather rare cases where the root freely produces\r\nadventitious buds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98. A piece of the running rootstock of the\r\nPeppermint, with its node or joint, and an axillary bud ready to grow.]\r\n\r\n106. Rootstocks are more commonly thickened by the storing up of\r\nconsiderable nourishing matter in their tissue. The common species of\r\nIris (Fig. 164) in the gardens have stout rootstocks, which are only\r\npartly covered by the soil, and which bear foliage-leaves instead of\r\nmere scales, closely covering the upper part, while the lower produces\r\nroots. As the leaves die, year by year, and decay, a scar left in the\r\nform of a ring marks the place where each leaf was attached, that is,\r\nmarks so many nodes, separated by very short internodes.\r\n\r\n107. Some rootstocks are marked with large round scars of a different\r\nsort, like those of the Solomon's Seal (Fig. 99), which gave this name\r\nto the plant, from their looking somewhat like the impression of a seal\r\nupon wax. Here the rootstock sends up every spring an herbaceous stalk\r\nor stem, which bears the foliage and flowers, and dies in autumn. The\r\n_seal_ is the circular scar left by the death and separation of the base\r\nof the stout stalk from the living rootstock. As but one of these is\r\nformed each year, they mark the limits of a year's growth. The bud at\r\nthe end of the rootstock in the figure (which was taken in summer) will\r\ngrow the next spring into the stalk of the season, which, dying in\r\nautumn, will leave a similar scar, while another bud will be formed\r\nfarther on, crowning the ever-advancing summit or growing end of the\r\nstem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99. Rootstock of Solomon's Seal, with the bottom of\r\nthe stalk of the season, and the bud for the next year's growth.]\r\n\r\n108. As each year's growth of stem makes its own roots, it soon becomes\r\nindependent of the older parts. And after a certain age, a portion\r\nannually dies off behind, about as fast as it increases at the growing\r\nend, death following life with equal and certain step, with only a\r\nnarrow interval. In vigorous plants of Solomon's Seal or Iris, the\r\nliving rootstock is several inches or a foot in length; while in the\r\nshort rootstock of Trillium or Birthroot (Fig. 100) life is reduced to a\r\nnarrower span.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100. The very short rootstock and strong terminal\r\nbud of a Trillium or Birthroot.]\r\n\r\n109. An upright or short rootstock, like this of Trillium, is commonly\r\ncalled a CAUDEX (93); or when more shortened and thickened it would\r\nbecome a corm.\r\n\r\n110. =A Tuber= may be understood to be a portion of a rootstock\r\nthickened, and with buds (eyes) on the sides. Of course, there are all\r\ngradations between a tuber and a rootstock. Helianthus tuberosus, the\r\nso-called Jerusalem Artichoke (Fig. 101), and the common Potato, are\r\ntypical and familiar examples of the tuber. The stalks by which the\r\ntubers are attached to the parent stem are at once seen to be different\r\nfrom the roots, both in appearance and manner of growth. The scales on\r\nthe tubers are the rudiments of leaves; the eyes are the buds in their\r\naxils. The Potato-plant has three forms of branches: 1. Those that bear\r\nordinary leaves expanded in the air, to digest what they gather from it\r\nand what the roots gather from the soil, and convert it into\r\nnourishment. 2. After a while a second set of branches at the summit of\r\nthe plant bear flowers, which form fruit and seed out of a portion of\r\nthe nourishment which the leaves have prepared. 3. But a larger part of\r\nthis nourishment, while in a liquid state, is carried down the stem,\r\ninto a third sort of branches under ground, and accumulated in the form\r\nof starch at their extremities, which become tubers, or depositories of\r\nprepared solid food,--just as in the Turnip, Carrot, and Dahlia (Fig.\r\n83-87), it is deposited in the root. The use of the store of food is\r\nobvious enough. In the autumn the whole plant dies, except the seeds (if\r\nit formed them) and the tubers; and the latter are left disconnected in\r\nthe ground. Just as that small portion of nourishing matter which is\r\ndeposited in the seed feeds the embryo when it germinates, so the much\r\nlarger portion deposited in the tuber nourishes its buds, or eyes, when\r\nthey likewise grow, the next spring, into new plants. And the great\r\nsupply enables them to shoot with a greater vigor at the beginning, and\r\nto produce a greater amount of vegetation than the seedling plant could\r\ndo in the same space of time; which vegetation in turn may prepare and\r\nstore up, in the course of a few weeks or months, the largest quantity\r\nof solid nourishing material, in a form most available for food. Taking\r\nadvantage of this, man has transported the Potato from the cool Andes of\r\nChili to other cool climates, and makes it yield him a copious supply of\r\nfood, especially important in countries where the season is too short,\r\nor the summer's heat too little, for profitably cultivating the\r\nprincipal grain-plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101. Tubers of Helianthus tuberosus, called\r\n\"artichokes.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102. Bulblet-like tubers, such as are occasionally\r\nformed on the stem of a Potato-plant above ground.]\r\n\r\n111. =The Corm or Solid Bulb=, like that of Cyclamen (Fig. 103), and of\r\nIndian Turnip (Fig. 104), is a very short and thick fleshy subterranean\r\nstem, often broader than high. It sends off roots from its lower end, or\r\nrather face, leaves and stalks from its upper. The corm of Cyclamen goes\r\non to enlarge and to produce a succession of flowers and leaves year\r\nafter year. That of Indian Turnip is formed one year and is consumed\r\nthe next. Fig. 104 represents it in early summer, having below the corm\r\nof last year, from which the roots have fallen. It is partly consumed by\r\nthe growth of the stem for the season, and the corm of the year is\r\nforming at base of the stem above the line of roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103. Corm of Cyclamen, much reduced in size: roots\r\nfrom lower face, leaf-stalks and flower-stalks from the upper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104. Corm of Indian Turnip (Arisaema).]\r\n\r\n112. The corm of Crocus (Fig. 105, 106), like that of its relative\r\nGladiolus, is also reproduced annually, the new ones forming upon the\r\nsummit and sides of the old. Such a corm is like a tuber in budding from\r\nthe sides, i. e. from the axils of leaves; but these leaves, instead of\r\nbeing small scales, are the sheathing bases of foliage-leaves which\r\ncovered the surface. It resembles a true bulb in having these sheaths or\r\nbroad scales; but in the corm or solid bulb, this solid part or stem\r\nmakes up the principal bulk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105. Corm of a Crocus, the investing sheaths or dead\r\nleaf-bases stripped off. The faint cross-lines represent the scars,\r\nwhere the leaves were attached, i. e. the nodes: the spaces between are\r\nthe internodes. The exhausted corm of the previous year is underneath;\r\nforming ones for next year on the summit and sides.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106. Section of the same.]\r\n\r\n113. =The Bulb=, strictly so-called, is a stem like a reduced corm as to\r\nits solid part (or plate); while the main body consists of thickened\r\nscales, which are leaves or leaf-bases. These are like bud-scales; so\r\nthat in fact a bulb is a bud with fleshy scales on an exceedingly short\r\nstem. Compare a White Lily bulb (Fig. 107) with the strong scaly buds of\r\nthe Hickory and Horse-chestnut (Fig. 72 and 73), and the resemblance\r\nwill appear. In corms, as in tubers and rootstocks, the store of food\r\nfor future growth is deposited in the stem; while in the bulb, the\r\ngreater part is deposited in the bases of the leaves, changing them into\r\nthick scales, which closely overlap or enclose one another.\r\n\r\n114. =A Scaly Bulb= (like that of the Lily, Fig. 107, 108) is one in\r\nwhich the scales are thick but comparatively narrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. Bulb of a wild Lily. 108. The same divided\r\nlengthwise, showing two forming buds of the next generation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109. A ground leaf of White Lily, its base (cut\r\nacross) thickened into a bulb-scale. This plainly shows that bulb-scales\r\nare leaves.]\r\n\r\n115. =A Tunicated or Coated Bulb= is one in which the scales enwrap each\r\nother, forming concentric coats or layers, as in Hyacinth and Onion.\r\n\r\n116. =Bulblets= are very small bulbs growing out of larger ones; or\r\nsmall bulbs produced above ground on some plants, as in the axils of the\r\nleaves of the bulbiferous Lilies of the gardens (Fig. 110), and often in\r\nthe flower-clusters of the Leek and Onion. They are plainly buds with\r\nthickened scales. They never grow into branches, but detach themselves\r\nwhen full grown, fall to the ground, and take root there to form new\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110. Bulblets in the axils of leaves of a Tiger\r\nLily.]\r\n\r\n117. =Consolidated Vegetation.= An ordinary herb, shrub, or tree is\r\nevidently constructed on the plan developing an extensive surface. In\r\nfleshy rootstocks, tubers, corms, and bulbs, the more enduring portion\r\nof the plant is concentrated, and reduced for the time of struggle (as\r\nagainst drought, heat, or cold) to a small amount of exposed surface,\r\nand this mostly sheltered in the soil. There are many similar\r\nconsolidated forms which are not subterranean. Thus plants like the\r\nHouseleek (Fig. 91) imitate a bulb. Among Cactuses the columnar species\r\nof Cereus (Fig. 111, _b_), may be likened to rootstocks. A green rind\r\nserves the purpose of foliage; but the surface is as nothing compared\r\nwith an ordinary leafy plant of the same bulk. Compare, for instance,\r\nthe largest Cactus known, the Giant Cereus of the Gila River (Fig. 111,\r\nin the background), which rises to the height of fifty or sixty feet,\r\nwith a common leafy tree of the same height, such as that in Fig. 89,\r\nand estimate how vastly greater, even without the foliage, the surface\r\nof the latter is than that of the former. Compare, in the same view, an\r\nOpuntia or Prickly-Pear Cactus, its stem and branches formed of a\r\nsuccession of thick and flattened joints (Fig. 111, _a_), which may be\r\nlikened to tubers, or an Epiphyllum (_d_), having short and flat joints,\r\nwith an ordinary leafy shrub or herb of equal size. And finally, in\r\nMelon-Cactuses, Echinocactus (_c_), or other globose forms (which may be\r\nlikened to permanent corms), with their globular or bulb-like shapes, we\r\nhave plants in the compactest shape; their spherical figure being such\r\nas to expose the least possible amount of substance to the air. These\r\nare adaptations to climates which are very dry, either throughout or for\r\na part of the year. Similarly, bulbous and corm-bearing plants, and the\r\nlike, are examples of a form of vegetation which in the growing season\r\nmay expand a large surface to the air and light, while during the period\r\nof rest the living vegetable is reduced to a globe, or solid form of the\r\nleast possible surface; and this protected by its outer coats of dead\r\nand dry scales, as well as by its situation under ground. Such are also\r\nadapted to a season of drought. They largely belong to countries which\r\nhave a long hot season of little or no rain, when, their stalks and\r\nfoliage above and their roots beneath early perishing, the plants rest\r\nsecurely in their compact bulbs, filled with nourishment and retaining\r\ntheir moisture with great tenacity, until the rainy season comes round.\r\nThen they shoot forth leaves and flowers with wonderful rapidity, and\r\nwhat was perhaps a desert of arid sand becomes green with foliage and\r\ngay with blossoms, almost in a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection VII. LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n118. STEMS bear leaves, at definite points (nodes, 13); and these are\r\nproduced in a great variety of forms, and subserve various uses. The\r\ncommonest kind of leaf, which therefore may be taken as the type or\r\npattern, is an expanded green body, by means of which the plant exposes\r\nto the air and light the matters which it imbibes, exhales certain\r\nportions, and assimilates the residue into vegetable matter for its\r\nnourishment and growth.\r\n\r\n119. But the fact is already familiar (10-30) that leaves occur under\r\nother forms and serve for other uses,--for the storage of food already\r\nassimilated, as in thickened seed-leaves and bulb-scales; for covering,\r\nas in bud-scales; and still other uses are to be pointed out. Indeed,\r\nsometimes they are of no service to the plant, being reduced to mere\r\nscales or rudiments, such as those on the rootstocks of Peppermint (Fig.\r\n97) or the tubers of Jerusalem Artichoke (Fig. 101). These may be said\r\nto be of service only to the botanist, in explaining to him the plan\r\nupon which a plant is constructed.\r\n\r\n120. Accordingly, just as a rootstock, or a tuber, or a tendril is a\r\nkind of stem, so a bud-scale, or a bulb-scale, or a cotyledon, or a\r\npetal of a flower, is a kind of leaf. Even in respect to ordinary\r\nleaves, it is natural to use the word either in a wider or in a narrower\r\nsense; as when in one sense we say that a leaf consists of blade and\r\npetiole or leaf-stalk, and in another sense say that a leaf is petioled,\r\nor that the leaf of Hepatica is three-lobed. The connection should make\r\nit plain whether by leaf we mean leaf-blade only, or the blade with any\r\nother parts it may have. And the student will readily understand that by\r\nleaf in its largest or _morphological_ sense, the botanist means the\r\norgan which occupies the place of a leaf, whatever be its form or its\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. LEAVES AS FOLIAGE.\r\n\r\n121. This is tautological; for foliage is simply leaves: but it is very\r\nconvenient to speak of typical leaves, or those which serve the plant\r\nfor assimilation, as foliage-leaves, or ordinary leaves. These may first\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\n122. =The Parts of a Leaf.= The ordinary leaf, complete in its parts,\r\nconsists of _blade_, _foot-stalk_, or _petiole_, and a pair of\r\n_stipules_.\r\n\r\n123. First the BLADE or LAMINA, which is the essential part of ordinary\r\nleaves, that is, of such as serve the purpose of foliage. In structure\r\nit consists of a softer part, the _green pulp_, called _parenchyma_,\r\nwhich is traversed and supported by a fibrous frame, the parts of which\r\nare called _ribs_ or _veins_, on account of a certain likeness in\r\narrangement to the veins of animals. The whole surface is covered by a\r\ntransparent skin, the _Epidermis_, not unlike that which covers the\r\nsurface of all fresh shoots.\r\n\r\n124. Note that the leaf-blade expands horizontally,--that is, normally\r\npresents its faces one to the sky, the other to the ground, or when the\r\nleaf is erect the upper face looks toward the stem that bears it, the\r\nlower face away from it. Whenever this is not the case there is\r\nsomething to be explained.\r\n\r\n125. The framework consists of _wood_,--a fibrous and tough material\r\nwhich runs from the stem through the leaf-stalk, when there is one, in\r\nthe form of parallel threads or bundles of fibres; and in the blade\r\nthese spread out in a horizontal direction, to form the _ribs_ and\r\n_veins_ of the leaf. The stout main branches of the framework are called\r\nthe _Ribs_. When there is only one, as in Fig. 112, 114, or a middle one\r\ndecidedly larger than the rest, it is called the _Midrib_. The smaller\r\ndivisions are termed _Veins_; and their still smaller subdivisions,\r\n_Veinlets_. The latter subdivide again and again, until they become so\r\nfine that they are invisible to the naked eye. The fibres of which they\r\nare composed are hollow; forming tubes by which the sap is brought into\r\nthe leaves and carried to every part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112. Leaf of the Quince: _b_, blade; _p_, petiole;\r\n_st_, stipules.]\r\n\r\n126. =Venation= is the name of the mode of veining, that is, of the way\r\nin which the veins are distributed in the blade. This is of two\r\nprincipal kinds; namely, the _parallel-veined_, and the _netted-veined_.\r\n\r\n127. In _Netted-veined_ (also called _Reticulated_) leaves, the veins\r\nbranch off from the main rib or ribs, divide into finer and finer\r\nveinlets, and the branches unite with each other to form meshes of\r\nnetwork. That is, they _anastomose_, as anatomists say of the veins and\r\narteries of the body. The Quince-leaf, in Fig. 112, shows this kind of\r\nveining in a leaf with a single rib. The Maple, Basswood, Plane or\r\nButtonwood (Fig. 74) show it in leaves of several ribs.\r\n\r\n128. In _parallel-veined_ leaves, the whole framework consists of\r\nslender ribs or veins, which run parallel with each other, or nearly so,\r\nfrom the base to the point of the leaf,--not dividing and subdividing,\r\nnor forming meshes, except by minute cross-veinlets. The leaf of any\r\ngrass, or that of the Lily of the Valley (Fig. 113) will furnish a good\r\nillustration. Such parallel veins Linnaeus called _Nerves_, and\r\nparallel-veined leaves are still commonly called _nerved_ leaves, while\r\nthose of the other kind are said to be _veined_,--terms which it is\r\nconvenient to use, although these \"nerves\" and \"veins\" are all the same\r\nthing, and have no likeness to the _nerves_ and little to the veins of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n129. _Netted-veined_ leaves belong to plants which have a pair of\r\nseed-leaves or cotyledons, such as the Maple (Fig. 20, 24), Beech (Fig.\r\n33), and the like; while _parallel-veined_ or _nerved_ leaves belong to\r\nplants with one cotyledon or true seed-leaf; such as the Iris (Fig. 59),\r\nand Indian Corn (Fig. 70). So that a mere glance at the leaves generally\r\ntells what the structure of the embryo is, and refers the plant to one\r\nor the other of these two grand classes,--which is a great convenience.\r\nFor when plants differ from each other in some one important respect,\r\nthey usually differ correspondingly in other respects also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113. A (parallel-veined) leaf of the Lily of the\r\nValley. 114. One of the Calla Lily.]\r\n\r\n130. Parallel-veined leaves are of two sorts,--one kind, and the\r\ncommonest, having the ribs or nerves all running from the base to the\r\npoint of the leaf, as in the examples already given; while in another\r\nkind they run from a midrib to the margin, as in the common\r\nPickerel-weed of our ponds, in the Banana, in Calla (Fig. 114), and many\r\nsimilar plants of warm climates.\r\n\r\n131. Netted-veined leaves are also of two sorts, as in the examples\r\nalready referred to. In one case the veins all rise from a single rib\r\n(the midrib), as in Fig. 112, 116-127. Such leaves are called\r\n_Feather-veined_ or _Penni-veined_, i. e. _Pinnately-veined_; both terms\r\nmeaning the same thing, namely, that the veins are arranged on the sides\r\nof the rib like the plume of a feather on each side of the shaft.\r\n\r\n132. In the other case (as in Fig. 74, 129-132), the veins branch off\r\nfrom three, five, seven, or nine ribs, which spread from the top of the\r\nleaf-stalk, and run through the blade like the toes of a web-footed\r\nbird. Hence these are said to be _Palmately_ or _Digitately_ veined, or\r\n(since the ribs diverge like rays from a centre) _Radiate-veined_.\r\n\r\n133. Since the general outline of leaves accords with the framework or\r\nskeleton, it is plain that _feather-veined_ (or _penni-veined_) leaves\r\nwill incline to elongated shapes, or at least to be longer than broad;\r\nwhile in _radiate-veined_ leaves more rounded forms are to be expected.\r\nA glance at the following figures shows this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115-120. A series of shapes of feather-veined\r\nleaves.]\r\n\r\n134. =Forms of Leaves as to General Outline.= It is necessary to give\r\nnames to the principal shapes, and to define them rather precisely,\r\nsince they afford easy marks for distinguishing species. The same terms\r\nare used for all other flattened parts as well, such as petals; so that\r\nthey make up a great part of the descriptive language of Botany. It will\r\nbe a good exercise for young students to look up leaves answering to\r\nthese names and definitions. Beginning with the narrower and proceeding\r\nto the broadest forms, a leaf is said to be\r\n\r\n_Linear_ (Fig. 115), when narrow, several times longer than wide, and of\r\nthe same breadth throughout.\r\n\r\n_Lanceolate_, or _Lance-shaped_, when conspicuously longer than wide,\r\nand tapering upwards (Fig. 116), or both upwards and downwards.\r\n\r\n_Oblong_ (Fig. 117), when nearly twice or thrice as long as broad.\r\n\r\n_Elliptical_ (Fig. 118) is oblong with a flowing outline, the two ends\r\nalike in width.\r\n\r\n_Oval_ is the same as broadly elliptical, or elliptical with the breadth\r\nconsiderably more than half the length.\r\n\r\n_Ovate_ (Fig. 119), when the outline is like a section of a hen's egg\r\nlengthwise, the broader end downward.\r\n\r\n_Orbicular_, or _Rotund_ (Fig. 132), circular in outline, or nearly so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121, oblanceolate; 122, spatulate; 123, obovate; and\r\n124, wedge-shaped, feather-veined, leaves.]\r\n\r\n135. A leaf which tapers toward the base instead of toward the apex may\r\nbe\r\n\r\n_Oblanceolate_ (Fig. 121) when of the lance-shaped form, only more\r\ntapering toward the base than in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n_Spatulate_ (Fig. 122) when more rounded above, but tapering thence to a\r\nnarrow base, like an old-fashioned spatula.\r\n\r\n_Obovate_ (Fig. 123) or inversely ovate, that is, ovate with the\r\nnarrower end down.\r\n\r\n_Cuneate_ or _Cuneiform_, that is, _Wedge-shaped_ (Fig. 124), broad\r\nabove and tapering by nearly straight lines to an acute angle at the\r\nbase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125, sagittate; 126, auriculate; and 127,\r\nhalberd-shaped or hastate leaves.]\r\n\r\n136. =As to the Base=, its shape characterizes several forms, such as\r\n\r\n_Cordate_ or _Heart-shaped_ (Fig. 120, 129), when a leaf of an ovate\r\nform, or something like it, has the outline of its rounded base turned\r\nin (forming a notch or _sinus_) where the stalk is attached.\r\n\r\n_Reniform_, or _Kidney-shaped_ (Fig. 131), like the last, only rounder\r\nand broader than long.\r\n\r\n_Auriculate_, or _Eared_, having a pair of small and blunt projections,\r\nor _ears_, at the base, as in one species of Magnolia (Fig. 126).\r\n\r\n_Sagittate_, or _arrow-shaped_, where such ears are acute and turned\r\ndownwards, while the main body of the blade tapers upwards to a point,\r\nas in the common Sagittaria or Arrow-head, and in the Arrow-leaved\r\nPolygonum (Fig. 125).\r\n\r\n_Hastate_, or _Halberd-shaped_, when such lobes at the base point\r\noutwards, giving the shape of the halberd of the olden time, as in\r\nanother Polygonum (Fig. 127).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128-132. Various forms of radiate-veined leaves.]\r\n\r\n_Peltate_, or _Shield-shaped_ (Fig. 132), is the name applied to a\r\ncurious modification of the leaf, commonly of a rounded form, where the\r\nfootstalk is attached to the lower surface, instead of the base, and\r\ntherefore is naturally likened to a shield borne by the outstretched\r\narm. The common Watershield, the Nelumbium, and the White Water-lily,\r\nand also the Mandrake, exhibit this sort of leaf. On comparing the\r\nshield-shaped leaf of the common Marsh Pennywort (Fig. 132) with that of\r\nanother common species (Fig. 130), it is at once seen that a\r\nshield-shaped leaf is like a kidney-shaped (Fig. 130, 131) or other\r\nrounded leaf, with the margins at the base brought together and united.\r\n\r\n137. =As to the Apex=, the following terms express the principal\r\nvariations:--\r\n\r\n_Acuminate_, _Pointed_, or _Taper-pointed_, when the summit is more or\r\nless prolonged into a narrowed or tapering point; as in Fig. 133.\r\n\r\n_Acute_, ending in an acute angle or not prolonged point; Fig. 134.\r\n\r\n_Obtuse_, with a blunt or rounded apex; as in Fig. 135, etc.\r\n\r\n_Truncate_, with the end as if cut off square; as in Fig. 136.\r\n\r\n_Retuse_, with rounded summit slightly indented, forming a very shallow\r\nnotch, as in Fig. 137.\r\n\r\n_Emarginate_, or _Notched_, indented at the end more decidedly; as in\r\nFig. 138.\r\n\r\n_Obcordate_, that is, inversely heart-shaped, where an obovate leaf is\r\nmore deeply notched at the end (Fig. 139), as in White Clover and\r\nWood-sorrel; so as to resemble a cordate leaf inverted.\r\n\r\n_Cuspidate_, tipped with a sharp and rigid point; as in Fig. 140.\r\n\r\n_Mucronate_, abruptly tipped with a small and short point, like a mere\r\nprojection of the midrib; as in Fig. 141.\r\n\r\n_Aristate_, _Awn-pointed_, and _Bristle-pointed_, are terms used when\r\nthis mucronate point is extended into a longer bristle-form or slender\r\nappendage.\r\n\r\nThe first six of these terms can be applied to the lower as well as to\r\nthe upper end of a leaf or other organ. The others belong to the apex\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133-141. Forms of the apex of leaves.]\r\n\r\n138. =As to degree and nature of Division=, there is first of all the\r\ndifference between\r\n\r\n_Simple Leaves_, those in which the blade is of one piece, however much\r\nit may be cut up, and\r\n\r\n_Compound Leaves_, those in which the blade consists of two or more\r\nseparate pieces, upon a common leaf-stalk or support. Yet between these\r\ntwo kinds every intermediate gradation is to be met with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142-147. Kinds of margin of leaves.]\r\n\r\n139. =As to Particular Outlines of Simple Leaves= (and the same applies\r\nto their separate parts), they are\r\n\r\n_Entire_, when their general outline is completely filled out, so that\r\nthe margin is an even line, without teeth or notches.\r\n\r\n_Serrate_, or _Saw-toothed_, when the margin only is cut into sharp\r\nteeth, like those of a saw, and pointing forwards; as in Fig. 142.\r\n\r\n_Dentate_, or _Toothed_, when such teeth point outwards, instead of\r\nforwards; as in Fig. 143.\r\n\r\n_Crenate_, or _Scalloped_, when the teeth are broad and rounded; as in\r\nFig. 144.\r\n\r\n_Repand_, _Undulate_, or _Wavy_, when the margin of the leaf forms a\r\nwavy line, bending slightly inwards and outwards in succession; as in\r\nFig. 145.\r\n\r\n_Sinuate_, when the margin is more strongly sinuous or turned inwards\r\nand outwards; as in Fig. 146.\r\n\r\n_Incised_, _Cut_, or _Jagged_, when the margin is cut into sharp, deep,\r\nand irregular teeth or incisions; as in Fig. 147.\r\n\r\n_Lobed_, when deeply cut. Then the pieces are in a general way called\r\nLOBES. The number of the lobes is briefly expressed by the phrase\r\n_two-lobed_, _three-lobed_, _five-lobed_, _many-lobed_, etc., as the\r\ncase may be.\r\n\r\n140. When the depth and character of the lobing needs to be more\r\nparticularly specified, the following terms are employed, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Lobed_, in a special sense, when the incisions do not extend deeper\r\nthan about half-way between the margin and the centre of the blade, if\r\nso far, and are more or less rounded; as in the leaves of the Post-Oak,\r\nFig. 148, and the Hepatica, Fig. 152.\r\n\r\n_Cleft_, when the incisions extend half way down or more, and especially\r\nwhen they are sharp; as in Fig. 149, 153. And the phrases _two-cleft_,\r\nor, in the Latin form, _bifid_, _three-cleft_ or _trifid_, _four-cleft_\r\nor _quadrifid_, _five-cleft_ or _quinquefid_, etc., or _many-cleft_, in\r\nthe Latin form, _multifid_,--express the number of the _Segments_, or\r\nportions.\r\n\r\n_Parted_, when the incisions are still deeper, but yet do not quite\r\nreach to the midrib or the base of the blade; as in Fig. 150, 154. And\r\nthe terms _two-parted_, _three-parted_, etc., express the number of such\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n_Divided_, when the incisions extend quite to the midrib, as in the\r\nlower part of Fig. 151, or to the leaf-stalk, as in Fig. 155; which\r\nreally makes the leaf compound. Here, using the Latin form, the leaf is\r\nsaid to be _bisected_, _trisected_ (Fig. 155), etc., according to the\r\nnumber of the divisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148, pinnately lobed; 149, pinnately cleft; 150,\r\npinnately parted; 151, pinnately divided, leaves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152, palmately three-lobed; 153, palmately\r\nthree-cleft; 154, palmately three-parted; 155, palmately three-divided\r\nor trisected, leaves.]\r\n\r\n141. =The Mode of Lobing or Division= corresponds to that of the\r\nveining, whether _pinnately veined_ or _palmately veined_. In the former\r\nthe notches or incisions, or _sinuses_, coming between the principal\r\nveins or ribs are directed toward the midrib: in the latter they are\r\ndirected toward the apex of the petiole; as the figures show.\r\n\r\n142. So degree and mode of division may be tersely expressed in brief\r\nphrases. Thus, in the four upper figures of pinnately veined leaves, the\r\nfirst is said to be _pinnately lobed_ (in the special sense), the second\r\n_pinnately cleft_ (or _pinnatifid_ in Latin form), the third _pinnately\r\nparted_, the fourth _pinnately divided_, or _pinnatisected_.\r\n\r\n143. Correspondingly in the lower row, of palmately veined leaves, the\r\nfirst is _palmately lobed_, the second _palmately cleft_, the third\r\n_palmately parted_, the fourth _palmately divided_. Or, in other\r\nlanguage of the same meaning (but now less commonly employed), they are\r\nsaid to be _digitately lobed_, _cleft_, _parted_, or _divided_.\r\n\r\n144. The number of the divisions or lobes may come into the phrase. Thus\r\nin the four last named figures the leaves are respectively _palmately\r\nthree-lobed_, _three-cleft_ (or _trifid_), _three-parted_,\r\n_three-divided_, or better (in Latin form), _trisected_. And so for\r\nhigher numbers, as _five-lobed_, _five-cleft_, etc., up to\r\n_many-lobed_, _many-cleft_ or _multifid_, etc. The same mode of\r\nexpression may be used for pinnately lobed leaves, as _pinnately\r\n7-lobed_, _-cleft_, _-parted_, etc.\r\n\r\n145. The divisions, lobes, etc., may themselves be _entire_ (without\r\nteeth or notches), or _serrate_, or otherwise toothed or incised; or\r\nlobed, cleft, parted, etc.: in the latter cases making _twice\r\npinnatifid_, _twice palmately_ or _pinnately lobed_, _parted_, or\r\n_divided_ leaves, etc. From these illustrations one will perceive how\r\nthe botanist, in two or three words, may describe any one of the almost\r\nendlessly diversified shapes of leaves, so as to give a clear and\r\ndefinite idea of it.\r\n\r\n146. =Compound Leaves.= A compound leaf is one which has its blade in\r\nentirely separate parts, each usually with a stalklet of its own; and\r\nthe stalklet is often _jointed_ (or _articulated_) with the main\r\nleaf-stalk, just as this is jointed with the stem. When this is the\r\ncase, there is no doubt that the leaf is compound. But when the pieces\r\nhave no stalklets, and are not jointed with the main leaf-stalk, it may\r\nbe considered either as a divided simple leaf, or a compound leaf,\r\naccording to the circumstances. This is a matter of names where all\r\nintermediate forms may be expected.\r\n\r\n147. While the pieces or projecting parts of a simple leaf-blade are\r\ncalled _Lobes_, or in deeply cut leaves, etc., _Segments_, or\r\n_Divisions_, the separate pieces or blades of a compound leaf are called\r\nLEAFLETS.\r\n\r\n148. Compound leaves are of two principal kinds, namely, the _Pinnate_\r\nand the _Palmate_; answering to the two modes of veining in reticulated\r\nleaves, and to the two sorts of lobed or divided leaves (141).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156-158. Pinnate leaves, the first with an odd\r\nleaflet (_odd-pinnate_); the second with a tendril in place of uppermost\r\nleaflets; the third _abruptly pinnate_, or of even pairs.]\r\n\r\n149. _Pinnate_ leaves are those in which the leaflets are arranged on\r\nthe sides of a main leaf-stalk; as in Fig. 156-158. They answer to the\r\n_feather-veined_ (i. e. _pinnately-veined_) simple leaf; as will be\r\nseen at once on comparing the forms. The _leaflets_ of the former answer\r\nto the _lobes_ or _divisions_ of the latter; and the continuation of the\r\npetiole, along which the leaflets are arranged, answers to the midrib of\r\nthe simple leaf.\r\n\r\n150. Three sorts of pinnate leaves are here given. Fig. 156 is _pinnate\r\nwith an odd_ or _end leaflet_, as in the Common Locust and the Ash. Fig.\r\n157 is _pinnate with a tendril at the end_, in place of the odd leaflet,\r\nas in the Vetches and the Pea. Fig. 158 is evenly or _abruptly pinnate_,\r\nas in the Honey-Locust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159. Palmate (or digitate) leaf of five leaflets, of\r\nthe Sweet Buckeye.]\r\n\r\n151. _Palmate_ (also named _Digitate_) leaves are those in which the\r\nleaflets are all borne on the tip of the leaf-stalk, as in the Lupine,\r\nthe Common Clover, the Virginia Creeper (Fig. 93), and the\r\nHorse-chestnut and Buckeye (Fig. 159). They evidently answer to the\r\n_radiate-veined_ or _palmately-veined_ simple leaf. That is, the\r\nClover-leaf of three leaflets is the same as a palmately three-ribbed\r\nleaf cut into three separate leaflets. And such a simple five-lobed leaf\r\nas that of the Sugar Maple, if more cut, so as to separate the parts,\r\nwould produce a palmate leaf of five leaflets, like that of the\r\nHorse-chestnut or Buckeye.\r\n\r\n152. Either sort of compound leaf may have any number of leaflets; yet\r\npalmate leaves cannot well have a great many, since they are all crowded\r\ntogether on the end of the main leaf-stalk. Some Lupines have nine or\r\neleven; the Horse-chestnut has seven, the Sweet Buckeye more commonly\r\nfive, the Clover three. A pinnate leaf often has only seven or five\r\nleaflets, or only three, as in Beans of the genus Phaseolus, etc.; in\r\nsome rarer cases only two; in the Orange and Lemon and also in the\r\ncommon Barberry there is only one! The joint at the place where the\r\nleaflet is united with the petiole distinguishes this last case from a\r\nsimple leaf. In other species of these genera the lateral leaflets also\r\nare present.\r\n\r\n153. The leaflets of a compound leaf may be either _entire_ (as in Fig.\r\n126-128), or _serrate_, or lobed, cleft, parted, etc.; in fact, may\r\npresent all the variations of simple leaves, and the same terms equally\r\napply to them.\r\n\r\n154. When the division is carried so far as to separate what would be\r\none leaflet into two, three, or several, the leaf becomes _doubly_ or\r\n_twice compound_, either _pinnately_ or _palmately_, as the case may be.\r\nFor example, while the clustered leaves of the Honey-Locust are _simply\r\npinnate_, that is, _once pinnate_, those on new shoots are _bipinnate_,\r\nor _twice pinnate_, as in Fig. 160. When these leaflets are again\r\ndivided in the same way, the leaf becomes _thrice pinnate_, or\r\n_tripinnate_, as in many Acacias. The first divisions are called\r\n_Pinnae_; the others, _Pinnules_; and the last, or little blades\r\nthemselves, _Leaflets_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160. A twice-pinnate (abruptly) leaf of the\r\nHoney-Locust.]\r\n\r\n155. So the palmate leaf, if again compounded in the same way, becomes\r\n_twice palmate_, or, as we say when the divisions are in threes, _twice\r\nternate_ (in Latin form _biternate_); if a third time compounded,\r\n_thrice ternate_ or _triternate_. But if the division goes still\r\nfurther, or if the degree is variable, we simply say that the leaf is\r\n_decompound_; either palmately or pinnately decompound, as the case may\r\nbe. Thus, Fig. 161 represents a four times ternately compound (in other\r\nwords a _ternately decompound_) leaf of a common Meadow Rue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161. Ternately decompound leaf of Meadow Rue.]\r\n\r\n156. When the botanist, in describing leaves, wishes to express the\r\nnumber of the leaflets, he may use terms like these:--\r\n\r\n_Unifoliolate_, for a compound leaf of a single leaflet; from the Latin\r\n_unum_, one, and _foliolum_, leaflet.\r\n\r\n_Bifoliolate_, of two leaflets, from the Latin _bis_, twice, and\r\n_foliolum_, leaflet.\r\n\r\n_Trifoliolate_ (or _ternate_), of three leaflets, as the Clover; and so\r\non.\r\n\r\n_Palmately bifoliolate_, _trifoliolate_, _quadrifoliolate_,\r\n_plurifoliolate_ (of several leaflets), etc.: or else\r\n\r\n_Pinnately bi-_, _tri-_, _quadri-_, or _plurifoliolate_ (that is, of\r\ntwo, three, four, five, or several leaflets), as the case may be: these\r\nare terse ways of denoting in single phrases both the number of leaflets\r\nand the kind of compounding.\r\n\r\n157. Of foliage-leaves having certain peculiarities in structure, the\r\nfollowing may be noted:--\r\n\r\n158. =Perfoliate Leaves.= In these the stem that bears them seems to\r\nrun through the blade of the leaf, more or less above its base. A common\r\nBellwort (Uvularia perfoliata, Fig. 162) is a familiar illustration. The\r\nlower and earlier leaves show it distinctly. Later, the plant is apt to\r\nproduce some leaves merely clasping the stem by the sessile and\r\nheart-shaped base, and the latest may be merely sessile. So the series\r\nexplains the peculiarity: in the formation of the leaf the bases,\r\nmeeting around the stem, grow together there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162. A summer branch of Uvularia perfoliata; lower\r\nleaves perfoliate, upper cordate-clasping, uppermost simply sessile.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163. Branch of a Honeysuckle, with\r\nconnate-perfoliate leaves.]\r\n\r\n159. =Connate-perfoliate.= Such are the upper leaves of true\r\nHoneysuckles. Here (Fig. 163) of the opposite and sessile leaves, some\r\npairs, especially the uppermost, in the course of their formation unite\r\naround the stem, which thus seems to run through the disk formed by\r\ntheir union.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164. Rootstock and equitant leaves of Iris. 165. A\r\nsection across the cluster of leaves at the bottom, showing the\r\nequitation.]\r\n\r\n160. =Equitant Leaves.= While ordinary leaves spread horizontally, and\r\npresent one face to the sky and the other to the earth, there are some\r\nthat present their tip to the sky, and their faces right and left to the\r\nhorizon. Among these are the _equitant_ leaves of the Iris or\r\nFlower-de-Luce. Inspection shows that each leaf was formed as if _folded\r\ntogether lengthwise_, so that what would be the upper surface is\r\nwithin, and all grown together, except next the bottom, where each leaf\r\ncovers the next younger one. It was from their straddling over each\r\nother, like a man on horseback (as is seen in the cross-section, Fig.\r\n165), that Linnaeus, with his lively fancy, called these _Equitant_\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n161. =Leaves with no distinction of Petiole and Blade.= The leaves of\r\nIris just mentioned show one form of this. The flat but narrow leaves of\r\nJonquils, Daffodils, and the cylindrical leaf of Onions are other\r\ninstances. _Needle-shaped_ leaves, like those of the Pine, Larch, and\r\nSpruce, and the _awl-shaped_ as well as the _scale-shaped_ leaves of\r\nJunipers, Red Cedar, and Arbor-Vitae (Fig. 166), are examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166. Branch of Arbor-Vitae, with awl-shaped and\r\nscale-shaped leaves.]\r\n\r\n162. =Phyllodia.= Sometimes an expanded _petiole_ takes the place of the\r\nblade; as in numerous New Holland Acacias, some of which are now common\r\nin greenhouses. Such counterfeit blades are called _phyllodia_,--meaning\r\nleaf-like bodies. They may be known from true blades by their standing\r\nedgewise, their margins being directed upwards and downwards; while in\r\ntrue blades the faces look upwards and downwards; excepting in equitant\r\nleaves, as already explained.\r\n\r\n163. =Falsely Vertical Leaves.= These are apparent exceptions to the\r\nrule, the blade standing edgewise instead of flatwise to the stem; but\r\nthis position comes by a twist of the stalk or the base of the blade.\r\nSuch leaves present the two faces about equally to the light. The\r\nCompass-plant (Silphium laciniatum) is an example. So also the leaves of\r\nBoltonia, of Wild Lettuce, and of a vast number of Australian Myrtaceous\r\nshrubs and trees, which much resemble the phyllodia of the Acacias of\r\nthe same country. They are familiar in Callistemon, the Bottle-brush\r\nFlower, and in Eucalyptus. But in the latter the leaves of the young\r\ntree have the normal structure and position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167. The ambiguous leaf? (cladophyllum) of\r\nMyrsiphyllum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168. Same of Ruscus, or Butcher's Broom.]\r\n\r\n164. =Cladophylla=, meaning _branch-leaves_. The foliage of Ruscus (the\r\nButcher's Broom of Europe) and of Myrsiphyllum of South Africa\r\n(cultivated for decoration under the false name of Smilax) is peculiar\r\nand puzzling. If these blades (Fig. 167, 168) are really leaves, they\r\nare most anomalous in occupying the axil of another leaf, reduced to a\r\nlittle scale. Yet they have an upper and lower face, as leaves should,\r\nalthough they soon twist, so as to stand more or less edgewise. If they\r\nare branches which have assumed exactly the form and office of leaves,\r\nthey are equally extraordinary in not making any further development.\r\nBut in Ruscus, flowers are borne on one face, in the axil of a little\r\nscale: and this would seem to settle that they are branches. In\r\nAsparagus just the same things as to position are thread-shaped and\r\nbranch-like.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. LEAVES OF SPECIAL CONFORMATION AND USE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169. A young Agave Americana, or Century-plant;\r\nfleshy-leaved.]\r\n\r\n165. =Leaves for Storage.= A leaf may at the same time serve both\r\nordinary and special uses. Thus in those leaves of Lilies, such as the\r\ncommon White Lily, which spring from the bulb, the upper and green part\r\nserves for foliage and elaborates nourishment, while the thickened\r\nportion or bud-scale beneath serves for the storage of this nourishment.\r\nThe thread-shaped leaf of the Onion fulfils the same office, and the\r\nnourishing matter it prepares is deposited in its sheathing base,\r\nforming one of the concentric layers of the onion. When these layers, so\r\nthick and succulent, have given up their store to the growing parts\r\nwithin, they are left as thin and dry husks. In a Houseleek, an Aloe or\r\nan Agave, the green color of the surface of the fleshy leaf indicates\r\nthat it is doing the work of foliage; the deeper-seated white portion\r\nwithin is the storehouse of the nourishment which the green surface has\r\nelaborated. So, also, the seed-leaves or cotyledons are commonly used\r\nfor storage. Some, as in one of the Maples, the Pea, Horse-chestnut,\r\nOak, etc., are for nothing else. Others, as in Beech and in our common\r\nBeans, give faint indications of service as foliage also, chiefly in\r\nvain. Still others, as in the Pumpkin and Flax, having served for\r\nstorage, develop into the first efficient foliage. Compare 11, 22-30,\r\nand the accompanying figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170. Series of bud-scales and foliage-leaves from a\r\ndeveloping bud of the Low Sweet Buckeye (AEsculus parviflora), showing\r\nnearly complete gradation, from a scale to a compound leaf of five\r\nleaflets; and that the scales answer to reduced petioles.]\r\n\r\n166. =Leaves as Bud-Scales= serve to protect the forming parts within.\r\nHaving fulfilled this purpose they commonly fall off when the shoot\r\ndevelops and foliage-leaves appear. Occasionally, as in Fig. 170, there\r\nis a transition of bud-scales to leaves, which reveals the nature of the\r\nformer. The Lilac also shows a gradation from bud-scale to simple leaf.\r\nIn Cornus florida (the Flowering Dogwood), the four bud-scales which\r\nthrough the winter protect the head of forming flowers remain until\r\nblossoming, and then the base of each grows out into a large and very\r\nshowy petal-like leaf; the original dry scale is apparent in the notch\r\nat the apex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171. Shoot of common Barberry, showing transition of\r\nfoliage-leaves to spines.]\r\n\r\n167. =Leaves as Spines= occur in several plants. A familiar instance is\r\nthat of the common Barberry (Fig. 171). In almost any summer shoot, most\r\nof the gradations may be seen between the ordinary leaves, with sharp\r\nbristly teeth, and leaves which are reduced to a branching spine or\r\nthorn. The fact that the spines of the Barberry produce a leaf-bud in\r\ntheir axil also proves them to be leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172. Leaves of Solanum jasminoides, the petiole\r\nadapted for climbing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173. Leaf of Lathyrus Aphaca, consisting of a pair\r\nof stipules and a tendril.]\r\n\r\n168. =Leaves for Climbing= are various in adaptation. True\r\nfoliage-leaves serve this purpose; as in Gloriosa, where the attenuated\r\ntip of a simple leaf (otherwise like that of a Lily) hooks around a\r\nsupporting object; or in Solanum jasminoides of the gardens (Fig. 172),\r\nand in Maurandia, etc., where the leaf-stalk coils round and clings to a\r\nsupport; or in the compound leaves of Clematis and of Adlumia, in which\r\nboth the leaflets and their stalks hook or coil around the support.\r\n\r\n169. Or in a compound leaf, as in the Pea and most Vetches, and in\r\nCobaea, while the lower leaflets serve for foliage, some of the uppermost\r\nare developed as tendrils for climbing (Fig. 167). In the common Pea\r\nthis is so with all but one or two pairs of leaflets.\r\n\r\n170. In one European Vetch, the leaflets are wanting and the whole\r\npetiole is a tendril, while the stipules become the only foliage (Fig.\r\n173).\r\n\r\n171. =Leaves as Pitchers=, or hollow tubes, are familiar in the common\r\nPitcher-plant or Side-saddle Flower (Sarracenia, Fig. 174) of our bogs.\r\nThese pitchers are generally half full of water, in which flies and\r\nother insects are drowned, often in such numbers as to make a rich\r\nmanure for the plant. More curious are some of the southern species of\r\nSarracenia, which seem to be specially adapted to the capture and\r\ndestruction of flies and other insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174. Leaf of Sarracenia purpurea, entire, and\r\nanother with the upper part cut off.]\r\n\r\n172. The leaf of Nepenthes (Fig. 175) combines three structures and\r\nuses. The expanded part below is foliage: this tapers into a tendril for\r\nclimbing; and this bears a pitcher with a lid. Insects are caught, and\r\nperhaps digested, in the pitcher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175. Leaf of Nepenthes; foliage, tendril, and\r\npitcher combined.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176. Leaves of Dionaea; the trap in one of them open,\r\nin the others closed.]\r\n\r\n173. =Leaves as Fly-traps.= Insects are caught in another way, and more\r\nexpertly, by the most extraordinary of all the plants of this country,\r\nthe Dionaea or Venus's Fly-trap, which grows in the sandy bogs around\r\nWilmington, North Carolina. Here (Fig. 176) each leaf bears at its\r\nsummit an appendage which opens and shuts, in shape something like a\r\nsteel-trap, and operating much like one. For when open, no sooner does a\r\nfly alight on its surface, and brush against any one of the two or three\r\nbristles that grow there, than the trap suddenly closes, capturing the\r\nintruder. If the fly escapes, the trap soon slowly opens, and is ready\r\nfor another capture. When retained, the insect is after a time moistened\r\nby a secretion from minute glands of the inner surface, and is digested.\r\nIn the various species of Drosera or Sundew, insects are caught by\r\nsticking fast to very viscid glands at the tip of strong bristles, aided\r\nby adjacent gland-tipped bristles which bend slowly toward the captive.\r\nThe use of such adaptations and operations may be explained in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3. STIPULES.\r\n\r\n174. A leaf complete in its parts consists of blade, leaf-stalk or\r\npetiole, and a pair of stipules. But most leaves have either fugacious\r\nor minute stipules or none at all; many have no petiole (the blade being\r\n_sessile_ or stalkless); some have no clear distinction of blade and\r\npetiole; and many of these, such as those of the Onion and all phyllodia\r\n(166), consist of petiole only.\r\n\r\n175. The base of the petiole is apt to be broadened and flattened,\r\nsometimes into thin margins, sometimes into a sheath which embraces the\r\nstem at the point of attachment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177. Leaf of Red Clover: _st_, stipules, adhering to\r\nthe base of _p_, the petiole; _b_, blade of three leaflets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178. Part of stem and leaf of Prince's-Feather\r\n(Polygonum orientale) with the united sheathing stipules forming a\r\nsheath or _ocrea_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179. Terminal winter bud of Magnolia Umbrella,\r\nnatural size. 180. Outermost bud-scale (pair of stipules) detached.]\r\n\r\n176. =Stipules= are such appendages, either wholly or partly separated\r\nfrom the petiole. When quite separate they are said to be _free_, as in\r\nFig. 112. When attached to the base of the petiole, as in the Rose and\r\nin Clover (Fig. 177), they are _adnate_. When the two stipules unite\r\nand sheathe the stem above the insertion, as in Polygonum (Fig. 178),\r\nthis sheath is called an _Ocrea_ from its likeness to a greave or\r\nleggin.\r\n\r\n177. In Grasses, when the sheathing base of the leaf may answer to\r\npetiole, the summit of the sheath commonly projects as a thin and short\r\nmembrane, like an ocrea: this is called a LIGULA or LIGULE.\r\n\r\n178. When stipules are green and leaf-like they act as so much foliage.\r\nIn the Pea they make up no small part of the actual foliage. In a\r\nrelated plant (Lathyrus Aphaca, Fig. 173), they make the whole of it,\r\nthe remainder of the leaf being tendril.\r\n\r\n179. In many trees the stipules are the bud-scales, as in the Beech, and\r\nvery conspicuously in the Fig-tree, Tulip-tree, and Magnolia (Fig. 179).\r\nThese fall off as the leaves unfold.\r\n\r\n180. The stipules are spines or prickles in Locust and several other\r\nLeguminous trees and shrubs; they are tendrils in Smilax or Greenbrier.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4. THE ARRANGEMENT OF LEAVES.\r\n\r\n181. =Phyllotaxy=, meaning leaf-arrangement, is the study of the\r\nposition of leaves, or parts answering to leaves, upon the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181. Alternate leaves, in Linden, Lime-tree, or\r\nBasswood.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182. Opposite leaves, in Red Maple.]\r\n\r\n182. The technical name for the attachment of leaves to the stem is the\r\n_insertion_. Leaves (as already noticed, 54) are _inserted_ in three\r\nmodes. They are\r\n\r\n_Alternate_ (Fig. 181), that is, one after another, or in other words,\r\nwith only a single leaf to each node;\r\n\r\n_Opposite_ (Fig. 182), when there is a pair to each node, the two\r\nleaves in this case being always on opposite sides of the stem;\r\n\r\n_Whorled_ or _Verticillate_ (Fig. 183) when there are more than two\r\nleaves on a node, in which case they divide the circle equally between\r\nthem, forming a _Verticel_ or whorl. When there are three leaves in the\r\nwhorl, the leaves are one third of the circumference apart; when four,\r\none quarter, and so on. So the plan of opposite leaves, which is very\r\ncommon, is merely that of whorled leaves, with the fewest leaves to the\r\nwhorl, namely, two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183. Whorled leaves of Galium.]\r\n\r\n183. In both modes and in all their modifications, the arrangement is\r\nsuch as to distribute the leaves systematically and in a way to give\r\nthem a good exposure to the light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184. A piece of stem of Larch with two clusters\r\n(fascicles) of numerous leaves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185. Piece of a branch of Pitch Pine, with three\r\nleaves in a fascicle or bundle, in the axil of a thin scale which\r\nanswers to a primary leaf. The bundle is surrounded at the base by a\r\nshort sheath, formed of the delicate scales of the axillary bud.]\r\n\r\n184. No two or more leaves ever grow from the same point. The so-called\r\n_Fascicled_ or _Clustered_ leaves are the leaves of a branch the nodes\r\nof which are very close, just as they are in the bud, so keeping the\r\nleaves in a cluster. This is evident in the Larch (Fig. 184), in which\r\nexamination shows each cluster to be made up of numerous leaves crowded\r\non a spur or short axis. In spring there are only such clusters; but in\r\nsummer some of them lengthen into ordinary shoots with scattered\r\nalternate leaves. So, likewise, each cluster of two or three\r\nneedle-shaped leaves in Pitch Pines (as in Fig. 185), or of five leaves\r\nin White Pine, answers to a similar extremely short branch, springing\r\nfrom the axil of a thin and slender scale, which represents a leaf of\r\nthe main shoot. For Pines produce two kinds of leaves,--1. primary, the\r\nproper leaves of the shoots, not as foliage, but in the shape of\r\ndelicate scales in spring, which soon fall away; and 2. secondary, the\r\n_fascicled_ leaves, from buds in the axils of the former, and these form\r\nthe actual foliage.\r\n\r\n185. =Phyllotaxy of Alternate Leaves.= Alternate leaves are distributed\r\nalong the stem in an order which is uniform for each species. The\r\narrangement in all its modifications is said to be _spiral_, because, if\r\nwe draw a line from the _insertion_ (i. e. the point of attachment) of\r\none leaf to that of the next, and so on, this line will wind spirally\r\naround the stem as it rises, and in the same species will always bear\r\nthe same number of leaves for each turn round the stem. That is, any two\r\nsuccessive leaves will always be separated from each other by an equal\r\nportion of the circumference of the stem. The distance in _height_\r\nbetween any two leaves may vary greatly, even on the same shoot, for\r\nthat depends upon the length of the _internodes_, or spaces between the\r\nleaves; but the distance as measured around the circumference (in other\r\nwords, the _Angular Divergence_, or angle formed by any two successive\r\nleaves) is uniformly the same.\r\n\r\n186. =Two-ranked.= The greatest possible divergence is, of course, where\r\nthe second leaf stands on exactly the opposite side of the stem from the\r\nfirst, the third on the side opposite the second, and therefore over the\r\nfirst, and the fourth over the second. This brings all the leaves into\r\ntwo ranks, one on one side of the stem and one on the other, and is\r\ntherefore called the _Two-ranked_ arrangement. It occurs in all\r\nGrasses,--in Indian Corn, for instance; also, in the Basswood (Fig.\r\n181). This is the simplest of all arrangements, and the one which most\r\nwidely distributes successive leaves, but which therefore gives the\r\nfewest vertical ranks. Next is the\r\n\r\n187. =Three-ranked= arrangement,--that of all Sedges, and of White\r\nHellebore. Here the second leaf is placed one third of the way round the\r\nstem, the third leaf two thirds of the way round, the fourth leaf\r\naccordingly directly over the first, the fifth over the second, and so\r\non. That is, three leaves occur in each turn round the stem, and they\r\nare separated from each other by one third of the circumference. (Fig.\r\n186, 187.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186. Two-ranked arrangement, shown in a piece of the\r\nstalk of a Sedge, with the leaves cut off above their bases; the leaves\r\nare numbered in order, from 1 to 6. 187. Diagram or cross-section of the\r\nsame, in one plane; the leaves similarly numbered; showing two cycles of\r\nthree.]\r\n\r\n188. =Five-ranked= is the next in the series, and the most common. It is\r\nseen in the Apple (Fig. 188), Cherry, Poplar, and the greater number of\r\ntrees and shrubs. In this case the line traced from leaf to leaf will\r\npass twice round the stem before it reaches a leaf situated directly\r\nover any below (Fig. 189). Here the sixth leaf is over the first; the\r\nleaves stand in five perpendicular ranks, with equal angular distance\r\nfrom each other; and this distance between any two successive leaves is\r\njust two fifths of the circumference of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188. Shoot with its leaves 5-ranked, the sixth leaf\r\nover the first; as in the Apple-tree.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189. Diagram of this arrangement, with a spiral line\r\ndrawn from the attachment of one leaf to the next, and so on; the parts\r\non the side turned from the eye are fainter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190. A ground-plan of the same; the section of the\r\nleaves similarly numbered; a dotted line drawn from the edge of one leaf\r\nto that of the next marks out the spiral.]\r\n\r\n189. The five-ranked arrangement is expressed by the fraction 2/5. This\r\nfraction denotes the divergence of the successive leaves, i. e. the\r\nangle they form with each other: the numerator also expresses the number\r\nof turns made round the stem by the spiral line in completing one cycle\r\nor set of leaves, namely, two; and the denominator gives the number of\r\nleaves in each cycle, or the number of perpendicular ranks, namely,\r\nfive. In the same way the fraction 1/2 stands for the two-ranked mode,\r\nand 1/3 for the three-ranked: and so these different sorts are expressed\r\nby the series of fractions 1/2, 1/3, 2/5. Other cases follow in the same\r\nnumerical progression, the next being the\r\n\r\n190. =Eight-ranked= arrangement. In this the ninth leaf stands over the\r\nfirst, and three turns are made around the stem to reach it; so it is\r\nexpressed by the fraction 3/8. This is seen in the Holly, and in the\r\ncommon Plantain. Then comes the\r\n\r\n191. =Thirteen-ranked= arrangement, in which the fourteenth leaf is over\r\nthe first, after five turns around the stem. The common Houseleek (Fig.\r\n191) is a good example.\r\n\r\n192. The series so far, then, is 1/2, 1/3, 2/5, 3/8, 5/13; the numerator\r\nand the denominator of each fraction being those of the two next\r\npreceding ones added together. At this rate the next higher should be\r\n8/21, then 13/34, and so on; and in fact just such cases are met with,\r\nand (commonly) no others. These higher sorts are found in the Pine\r\nFamily, both in the leaves and the cones and in many other plants with\r\nsmall and crowded leaves. But in those the number of the ranks, or of\r\nleaves in each cycle, can only rarely be made out by direct inspection.\r\nThey may be indirectly ascertained, however, by studying the _secondary_\r\nspirals, as they are called, which usually become conspicuous, at least\r\ntwo series of them, one turning to the right and one to the left, as\r\nshown in Fig. 191. For an account of the way in which the character of\r\nthe phyllotaxy may be deduced from the secondary spirals, see Structural\r\nBotany, Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191. A young plant of the Houseleek, with the leaves\r\n(not yet expanded) numbered, and exhibiting the 13-ranked arrangement;\r\nand showing secondary spirals.]\r\n\r\n193. =Phyllotaxy of Opposite and whorled Leaves.= This is simple and\r\ncomparatively uniform. The leaves of each pair or whorl are placed over\r\nthe intervals between those of the preceding, and therefore under the\r\nintervals of the pair or whorl next above. The whorls or pairs alternate\r\nor cross each other, usually at right angles, that is, they _decussate_.\r\nOpposite leaves, that is, whorls of two leaves only, are far commoner\r\nthan whorls of three or four or more members. This arrangement in\r\nsuccessive decussating pairs gives an advantageous distribution on the\r\nstem in four vertical ranks. Whorls of three give six vertical ranks,\r\nand so on. Note that in descriptive botany leaves in whorls of two are\r\nsimply called _opposite_ leaves; and that the term _verticillate_ or\r\n_whorled_, is employed only for cases of more than two, unless the\r\nlatter number is specified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192. Opposite leaves of Euonymus, or Spindle-tree,\r\nshowing the successive pairs crossing each other at right angles.]\r\n\r\n194. =Vernation or Praefoliation=, the disposition of the leaf-blades in\r\nthe bud, comprises two things; 1st, the way in which each separate leaf\r\nis folded, coiled, or packed up in the bud; and 2d, the arrangement of\r\nthe leaves in the bud with respect to one another. The latter of course\r\ndepends very much upon the phyllotaxy, i. e. the position and order of\r\nthe leaves upon the stem. The same terms are used for it as for the\r\narrangement of the leaves of the flower in the flower-bud. See,\r\ntherefore, \"AEstivation, or Praefloration.\"\r\n\r\n195. As to each leaf separately, it is sometimes _straight_ and open in\r\nvernation, but more commonly it is either _bent_, _folded_, or _rolled\r\nup_. When the upper part is bent down upon the lower, as the young blade\r\nin the Tulip-tree is bent upon the leaf-stalk, it is said to be\r\n_Inflexed_ or _Reclined_ in vernation. When folded by the midrib so that\r\nthe two halves are placed face to face, it is _Conduplicate_ (Fig. 193),\r\nas in the Magnolia, the Cherry, and the Oak. When folded back and forth\r\nlike the plaits of a fan, it is _Plicate_ or _Plaited_ (Fig. 194), as\r\nin the Maple and Currant. If rolled, it may be so either from the tip\r\ndownwards, as in Ferns and the Sundew (Fig. 197), when in unrolling it\r\nresembles the head of a crosier, and is said to be _Circinate_; or it\r\nmay be rolled up parallel with the axis, either from one edge into a\r\ncoil, when it is _Convolute_ (Fig. 195), as in the Apricot and Plum; or\r\nrolled from both edges towards the midrib,--sometimes inwards, when it\r\nis _Involute_ (Fig. 198), as in the Violet and Water-Lily; sometimes\r\noutwards, when it is _Revolute_ (Fig. 196), in the Rosemary and Azalea.\r\nThe figures are diagrams, representing sections through the leaf, in the\r\nway they were represented by Linnaeus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193. 194. 195. 196. 197. 198.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection VIII. FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n196. Flowers are for the production of seed (16). Stems and branches,\r\nwhich for a time put forth leaves for vegetation, may at length put\r\nforth flowers for reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. POSITION AND ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS, OR INFLORESCENCE.\r\n\r\n197. Flower-buds appear just where leaf-buds appear; that is, they are\r\neither _terminal_ or _axillary_ (47-49). Morphologically, flowers answer\r\nto shoots or branches, and their parts to leaves.\r\n\r\n198. In the same species the flowers are usually from axillary buds\r\nonly, or from terminal buds only; but in some they are both axillary and\r\nterminal.\r\n\r\n199. =Inflorescence=, which is the name used by Linnaeus to signify mode\r\nof flower-arrangement, is accordingly of three classes: namely,\r\n_Indeterminate_, when the flowers are in the axils of leaves, that is,\r\nare from axillary buds; _Determinate_, when they are from terminal buds,\r\nand so _terminate_ a stem or branch; and _Mixed_, when these two are\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\n200. =Indeterminate Inflorescence= (likewise, and for the same reason,\r\ncalled _indefinite inflorescence_) is so named because, as the flowers\r\nall come from axillary buds, the terminal bud may keep on growing and\r\nprolong the stem indefinitely. This is so in Moneywort (Fig. 199).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199. Piece of a flowering-stem of Moneywort\r\n(Lysimachia nummularia,) with single flowers successively produced in\r\nthe axils of the leaves, from below upwards, as the stem grows on.]\r\n\r\n201. When flowers thus arise singly from the axils of ordinary leaves,\r\nthey are _axillary_ and _solitary_, not collected into flower-clusters.\r\n\r\n202. But when several or many flowers are produced near each other, the\r\naccompanying leaves are apt to be of smaller size, or of different shape\r\nor character: then they are called BRACTS, and the flowers thus brought\r\ntogether form a cluster. The kinds of flower-clusters of the\r\nindeterminate class have received distinct names, according to their\r\nform and disposition. They are principally _Raceme_, _Corymb_, _Umbel_,\r\n_Spike_, _Head_, _Spadix_, _Catkin_, and _Panicle_.\r\n\r\n203. In defining these it will be necessary to use some of the following\r\nterms of descriptive botany which relate to inflorescence. If a flower\r\nis stalkless, i. e. sits directly in the axil or other support, it is\r\nsaid to be _sessile_. If raised on a naked stalk of its own (as in Fig.\r\n199) it is _pedunculate_, and the stalk is a PEDUNCLE.\r\n\r\n204. A peduncle on which a flower-cluster is raised is a _Common\r\npeduncle_. That which supports each separate flower of the cluster is a\r\n_Partial peduncle_, and is generally called a PEDICEL. The portion of\r\nthe general stalk along which flowers are disposed is called the _Axis\r\nof inflorescence_, or, when covered with sessile flowers, the _Rhachis_\r\n(back-bone), and sometimes the _Receptacle_. The leaves of a\r\nflower-cluster generally are termed BRACTS. But when bracts of different\r\norders are to be distinguished, those on the common peduncle or axis,\r\nand which have a flower in their axil, keep the name of _bracts_; and\r\nthose on the pedicels or partial flower-stalks, if any, that of\r\nBRACTLETS or _Bracteoles_. The former is the preferable English name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200. A raceme, with a general peduncle (_p_),\r\npedicels (_p'_), bracts (_b_), and bractlets (_b'_). Plainly the bracts\r\nhere answer to the leaves in Fig. 199.]\r\n\r\n205. =A Raceme= (Fig. 200) is that form of flower-cluster in which the\r\nflowers, each on their own foot-stalk or pedicel, are arranged along the\r\nsides of a common stalk or axis of inflorescence; as in the Lily of the\r\nValley, Currant, Barberry, one section of Cherry, etc. Each flower comes\r\nfrom the axil of a small leaf, or bract, which, however, is often so\r\nsmall that it might escape notice, and even sometimes (as in the Mustard\r\nFamily) disappears altogether. The lowest blossoms of a raceme are of\r\ncourse the oldest, and therefore open first, and the order of blossoming\r\nis _ascending_ from the bottom to the top. The summit, never being\r\nstopped by a terminal flower, may go on to grow, and often does so (as\r\nin the common Shepherd's Purse), producing lateral flowers one after\r\nanother for many weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201. A raceme. 202. A corymb. 203. An umbel.]\r\n\r\n206. =A Corymb= (Fig. 202) is the same as a raceme, except that it is\r\nflat and broad, either convex, or level-topped. That is, a raceme\r\nbecomes a corymb by lengthening the lower pedicels while the uppermost\r\nremain shorter. The axis of a corymb is short in proportion to the lower\r\npedicels. By extreme shortening of the axis the corymb may be converted\r\ninto\r\n\r\n207. =An Umbel= (Fig. 203) as in the Milkweed, a sort of flower-cluster\r\nwhere the pedicels all spring apparently from the same point, from the\r\ntop of the peduncle, so as to resemble, when spreading, the rays of an\r\numbrella; whence the name. Here the pedicels are sometimes called the\r\n_Rays_ of the umbel. And the bracts, when brought in this way into a\r\ncluster or circle, form what is called an INVOLUCRE.\r\n\r\n208. The corymb and the umbel being more or less level-topped, bringing\r\nthe flowers into a horizontal plane or a convex form, the ascending\r\norder of development appears as _Centripetal_. That is, the flowering\r\nproceeds from the margin or circumference regularly towards the centre;\r\nthe lower flowers of the former answering to the outer ones of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n209. In these three kinds of flower-clusters, the flowers are raised on\r\nconspicuous _pedicels_ (204) or stalks of their own. The shortening of\r\nthese pedicels, so as to render the flowers _sessile_ or nearly so,\r\nconverts a raceme into a _Spike_, and a corymb or an umbel into a\r\n_Head_.\r\n\r\n210. =A Spike= is a flower cluster with a more or less lengthened axis,\r\nalong which the flowers are sessile or nearly so; as in the Plantain\r\n(Fig. 204).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204. Spike of the common Plantain or Ribwort.]\r\n\r\n211. =A Head= (_Capitulum_) is a round or roundish cluster of flowers,\r\nwhich are sessile on a very short axis or receptacle, as in the\r\nButton-ball, Button-bush (Fig. 205), and Red Clover. It is just what a\r\nspike would become if its axis were shortened; or an umbel, if its\r\npedicels were all shortened until the flowers became sessile. The head\r\nof the Button-bush is naked; but that of the Thistle, of the Dandelion,\r\nand the like, is surrounded by empty bracts, which form an _Involucre_.\r\nTwo particular forms of the spike and the head have received particular\r\nnames, namely, the _Spadix_ and the _Catkin_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205. Head of the Button-bush (Cephalanthus).]\r\n\r\n212. =A Spadix= is a fleshy spike or head, with small and often\r\nimperfect flowers, as in the Calla, Indian Turnip, (Fig. 206), Sweet\r\nFlag, etc. It is commonly surrounded or embraced by a peculiar\r\nenveloping leaf, called a SPATHE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206. Spadix and spathe of the Indian Turnip; the\r\nlatter cut through below.]\r\n\r\n213. =A Catkin, or Ament=, is the name given to the scaly sort of spike\r\nof the Birch (Fig. 207) and Alder, the Willow and Poplar, and one sort\r\nof flower-clusters of the Oak, Hickory, and the like,--the so-called\r\n_Amentaceous_ trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207. Catkin, or Ament, of Birch.]\r\n\r\n214. _Compound_ flower-clusters of these kinds are not uncommon. When\r\nthe stalks which in the simple umbel are the pedicels of single flowers\r\nthemselves branch into an umbel, a _Compound Umbel_ is formed. This is\r\nthe inflorescence of Caraway (Fig. 208), Parsnip, and almost all of the\r\ngreat family of Umbelliferous (umbel-bearing) plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208. Compound Umbel of Caraway.]\r\n\r\n215. The secondary or partial umbels of a compound umbel are UMBELLETS.\r\nWhen the umbellets are subtended by an involucre, this secondary\r\ninvolucre is called an INVOLUCEL.\r\n\r\n216. A _Compound raceme_ is a cluster of racemes racemosely arranged, as\r\nin Smilacina racemosa. A _compound corymb_ is a corymb some branches of\r\nwhich branch again in the same way, as in Mountain Ash. A _compound\r\nspike_ is a spicately disposed cluster of spikes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209. Diagram of a simple panicle.]\r\n\r\n217. =A Panicle=, such as that of Oats and many Grasses, is a compound\r\nflower-cluster of a more or less open sort which branches with apparent\r\nirregularity, neither into corymbs nor racemes. Fig. 209 represents the\r\nsimplest panicle. It is, as it were, a raceme of which some of the\r\npedicels have branched so as to bear a few flowers on pedicels of their\r\nown, while others remain simple. A _compound panicle_ is one that\r\nbranches in this way again and again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210. Diagram of an opposite-leaved plant, with a\r\nsingle terminal flower. 211. Same, with a cyme of three flowers; _a_,\r\nthe first flower, of the main axis; _b b_, those of branches. 212. Same,\r\nwith flowers also of the third order, _c c_.]\r\n\r\n218. =Determinate Inflorescence= is that in which the flowers are from\r\nterminal buds. The simplest case is that of a solitary terminal flower,\r\nas in Fig. 210. This stops the growth of the stem; for its terminal bud,\r\nbecoming a blossom, can no more lengthen in the manner of a leaf-bud.\r\nAny further growth must be from axillary buds developing into branches.\r\nIf such branches are leafy shoots, at length terminated by single\r\nblossoms, the inflorescence still consists of solitary flowers at the\r\nsummit of stem and branches. But if the flowering branches bear only\r\nbracts in place of ordinary leaves, the result is the kind of\r\nflower-cluster called\r\n\r\n219. =A Cyme.= This is commonly a flat-topped or convex flower-cluster,\r\nlike a corymb, only the blossoms are from terminal buds. Fig. 211\r\nillustrates the simplest cyme in a plant with opposite leaves, namely,\r\nwith three flowers. The middle flower, _a_, terminates the stem; the two\r\nothers, _b b_, terminate branches, one from the axil of each of the\r\nuppermost leaves; and being later than the middle one, the flowering\r\nproceeds from the centre outwards, or is _Centrifugal_. This is the\r\nopposite of the indeterminate mode, or that where all the flower-buds\r\nare axillary. If flowering branches appear from the axils below, the\r\nlower ones are the later, so that the order of blossoming continues\r\n_centrifugal_ or, which is the same thing, _descending_, as in Fig. 213,\r\nmaking a sort of reversed raceme or _false raceme_,--a kind of cluster\r\nwhich is to the true raceme just what the flat cyme is to the corymb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213. Diagram of a simple cyme in which the axis\r\nlengthens, so as to take the form of a raceme.]\r\n\r\n220. Wherever there are bracts or leaves, buds may be produced from\r\ntheir axils and appear as flowers. Fig. 212 represents the case where\r\nthe branches, _b b_, of Fig. 211, each with a pair of small leaves or\r\nbracts about their middle, have branched again, and produced the\r\nbranchlets and flowers _c c_, on each side. It is the continued\r\nrepetition of this which forms the full or compound cyme, such as that\r\nof the Laurestinus, Hobble-bush, Dogwood, and Hydrangea (Fig. 214).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214. Compound cyme of Hydrangea arborescens, with\r\nneutral enlarged flowers round the circumference.]\r\n\r\n221. =A Fascicle= (meaning a bundle), like that of the Sweet William and\r\nLychnis of the gardens, is only a cyme with the flowers much crowded.\r\n\r\n222. =A Glomerule= is a cyme still more compacted, so as to imitate a\r\nhead. It may be known from a true head by the flowers not expanding\r\ncentripetally, that is, not from the circumference towards the centre.\r\n\r\n223. The illustrations of determinate or _cymose_ inflorescence have\r\nbeen taken from plants with opposite leaves, which give rise to the most\r\nregular cymes. But the Rose, Cinquefoil, Buttercup, etc., with alternate\r\nleaves, furnish also good examples of cymose inflorescence.\r\n\r\n224. =A Cymule= (or diminutive cyme) is either a reduced small cyme of\r\nfew flowers, or a branch of a compound cyme, i. e. a partial cyme.\r\n\r\n225. =Scorpioid= or =Helicoid Cymes=, of various sorts, are forms of\r\ndeterminate inflorescence (often puzzling to the student) in which one\r\nhalf of the ramification fails to appear. So that they may be called\r\n_incomplete cymes_. The commoner forms may be understood by comparing a\r\ncomplete cyme, like that of Fig. 215 with Fig. 216, the diagram of a\r\ncyme of an opposite-leaved plant, having a series of terminal flowers\r\nand the axis continued by the development of a branch in the axil of\r\nonly one of the leaves at each node. The dotted lines on the left\r\nindicate the place of the wanting branches, which if present would\r\nconvert this _scorpioid cyme_ into the complete one of Fig. 215. Fig.\r\n217 is a diagram of similar inflorescence with alternate leaves. Both\r\nare kinds of _false racemes_ (219). When the bracts are also wanting in\r\nsuch cases, as in many Borragineous plants, the true nature of the\r\ninflorescence is very much disguised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215. A complete forking cyme of an Arenaria, or\r\nChickweed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216. Diagram of a scorpioid cyme, with opposite\r\nleaves or bracts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 217. Diagram of analogous scorpioid cyme, with\r\nalternate leaves or bracts.]\r\n\r\n226. These distinctions between determinate and indeterminate\r\ninflorescence, between corymbs and cymes, and between the true and the\r\nfalse raceme and spike, were not recognized by botanists much more than\r\nhalf a century ago, and even now are not always attended to in\r\ndescriptions. It is still usual and convenient to describe rounded or\r\nflat-topped and open ramification as _corymbose_, even when essentially\r\ncymose; also to call the reversed or false racemes or spikes by these\r\n(strictly incorrect) names.\r\n\r\n227. =Mixed Inflorescence= is that in which the two plans are mixed or\r\ncombined in compound clusters. A _mixed panicle_ is one in which, while\r\nthe primary ramification is of the indeterminate order, the secondary or\r\nultimate is wholly or partly of the determinate order. A contracted or\r\nelongated inflorescence of this sort is called a THYRSUS. Lilac and\r\nHorse-chestnut afford common examples of mixed inflorescence of this\r\nsort. When loose and open such flower-clusters are called by the general\r\nname of _Panicles_. The heads of Compositae are centripetal; but the\r\nbranches or peduncles which bear the heads are usually of centrifugal\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. PARTS OR ORGANS OF THE FLOWER.\r\n\r\n228. These were simply indicated in Section II. 16. Some parts are\r\nnecessary to seed-bearing; these are _Essential Organs_, namely, the\r\n_Stamens_ and _Pistils_. Others serve for protection or for attraction,\r\noften for both. Such are the leaves of the Flower, or the _Floral\r\nEnvelopes_.\r\n\r\n229. =The Floral Envelopes=, taken together, are sometimes called the\r\nPERIANTH, also _Perigone_, in Latin form _Perigonium_. In a flower which\r\npossesses its full number of organs, the floral envelopes are of two\r\nkinds, namely, an outer circle, the CALYX, and an inner, the COROLLA.\r\n\r\n230. =The Calyx= is commonly a circle of green or greenish leaves, but\r\nnot always. It may be the most brightly colored part of the blossom.\r\nEach calyx-leaf or piece is called a SEPAL.\r\n\r\n231. =The Corolla= is the inner circle of floral envelopes or\r\nflower-leaves, usually of delicate texture and _colored_, that is, of\r\nsome other color than green. Each corolla-leaf is called a PETAL.\r\n\r\n232. There are flowers in abundance which consist wholly of floral\r\nenvelopes. Such are the so-called full _double flowers_, of which the\r\nchoicer roses and camellias of the cultivator are familiar examples. In\r\nthem, under the gardener's care and selection, petals have taken the\r\nplace of both stamens and pistils. These are monstrous or unnatural\r\nflowers, incapable of producing seed, and subservient only to human\r\ngratification. Their common name of _double_ flowers is not a sensible\r\none: except that it is fixed by custom, it were better to translate\r\ntheir Latin name, _flores pleni_, and call them _full flowers_, meaning\r\nfull of leaves.\r\n\r\n233. Moreover, certain plants regularly produce _neutral flowers_,\r\nconsisting of floral envelopes only. In Fig. 214, some are seen around\r\nthe margin of the cyme in Hydrangea. They are likewise familiar in the\r\nHobble-bush and in Wild-Cranberry tree, Viburnum Oxycoccus; where they\r\nform an attractive setting to the cluster of small and comparatively\r\ninconspicuous perfect flowers which they adorn. In the Guelder Rose, or\r\nSnow-ball of ornamental cultivation, all or most of the blossoms of this\r\nsame shrub are transformed into neutral flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218. A _flos plenus_, namely, a full double flower\r\nof Rose.]\r\n\r\n234. =The Essential Organs= are likewise of two kinds, placed one above\r\nor within the other; namely, first, the STAMENS or fertilizing organs,\r\nand second, the PISTILS, which are to be fertilized and bear the seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219. A stamen: _a_, filament; _b_, anther,\r\ndischarging pollen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220. A pistil; with ovary, _a_, half cut away, to\r\nshow the contained ovules; _b_, style; _c_, stigma.]\r\n\r\n235. =A Stamen= consists of two parts, namely, the FILAMENT or stalk\r\n(Fig. 219 _a_), and the ANTHER (_b_). The latter is the only essential\r\npart. It is a case, commonly with two lobes or cells, each opening\r\nlengthwise by a slit, at the proper time, and discharging a powder or\r\ndust-like substance, usually of a yellow color. This powder is the\r\nPOLLEN, or fertilizing matter, to produce which is the office of the\r\nstamen.\r\n\r\n236. =A Pistil= (Fig. 220, 221) when complete, has three parts; OVARY,\r\nSTYLE, and STIGMA. The _Ovary_, at base, is the hollow portion, which\r\ncontains one or more OVULES or rudimentary seeds. The _Style_ is the\r\ntapering portion above: the _Stigma_ is a portion of the style, usually\r\nits tip, with moist naked surface, upon which grains of pollen may lodge\r\nand adhere, and thence make a growth which extends down to the ovules.\r\nWhen there is no style then the stigma occupies the tip of the ovary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221. Model of a simple pistil, with ovary cut across\r\nand slightly opened ventrally, to show the ovules and their attachment.]\r\n\r\n237. =The Torus= or =Receptacle= is the end of the flower-stalk, or the\r\nportion of axis or stem out of which the several organs of the flower\r\ngrow, upon which they are borne (Fig. 223).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222. Flower of Sedum ternatum, a Stonecrop.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223. Parts of same, two of each kind, separated and\r\ndisplayed; the torus or receptacle in the centre; _a_, a sepal; _b_, a\r\npetal; _c_, a stamen; _d_, a pistil.]\r\n\r\n238. The parts of the flower are thus disposed on the receptacle or axis\r\nessentially as are leaves upon a very short stem; first the sepals, or\r\nouter floral leaves; then the petals or inner floral leaves; then the\r\nstamens; lastly, at summit or centre, the pistils, when there are two or\r\nmore of them, or the single pistil, when only one. Fig. 223 shows the\r\norgans displayed, two of each kind, of such a simple and symmetrical\r\nflower as that of a Sedum or Stonecrop, Fig. 222.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3. PLAN OF FLOWER.\r\n\r\n239. All flowers are formed upon one general plan, but with almost\r\ninfinite variations, and many disguises. This common plan is best\r\nunderstood by taking for a type, or standard for comparison, some\r\n_perfect_, _complete_, _regular_, and _symmetrical_ blossom, and one as\r\nsimple as such a blossom could well be. Flowers are said to be\r\n\r\n_Perfect_ (_hermaphrodite_), when provided with both kinds of essential\r\norgans, i. e. with both stamens and pistils.\r\n\r\n_Complete_, when, besides, they have the two sets of floral envelopes,\r\nnamely, calyx and corolla. Such are completely furnished with all that\r\nbelongs to a flower.\r\n\r\n_Regular_, when all the parts of each set are alike in shape and size.\r\n\r\n_Symmetrical_, when there is an equal number of parts in each set or\r\ncircle of organs.\r\n\r\n240. Flax-flowers were taken for a pattern in Section II. 16. But in\r\nthem the five pistils have their ovaries as it were consolidated into\r\none body. Sedum, Fig. 222, has the pistils and all the other parts free\r\nfrom such combination. The flower is perfect, complete, regular, and\r\nsymmetrical, but is not quite as simple as it might be; for there are\r\ntwice as many stamens as there are of the other organs. Crassula, a\r\nrelative of Sedum, cultivated in the conservatories for winter\r\nblossoming (Fig. 224) is simpler, being _isostemonous_, or with just as\r\nmany stamens as petals or sepals, while Sedum is _diplostemonous_,\r\nhaving double that number: it has, indeed, two sets of stamens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224. Flower of a Crassula. 225. Diagram or\r\nground-plan of same.]\r\n\r\n241. =Numerical Plan.= A certain number either runs through the flower\r\nor is discernible in some of its parts. This number is most commonly\r\neither five or three, not very rarely four, occasionally two. Thus the\r\n_ground-plan_ of the flowers thus far used for illustration is five.\r\nThat of Trillium (Fig. 226, 227) is three, as it likewise is as really,\r\nif not as plainly, in Tulips and Lilies, Crocus, Iris, and all that\r\nclass of blossoms. In some Sedums all the flowers are in fours. In\r\nothers the first flowers are on the plan of five, the rest mostly on the\r\nplan of four, that is, with four sepals, four petals, eight stamens (i.\r\ne. twice four), and four pistils. Whatever the ground number may be, it\r\nruns through the whole in symmetrical blossoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226. Flower of a Trillium; its parts in threes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227. Diagram of flower of Trillium. In this, as in\r\nall such diagrams of cross-section of blossoms, the parts of the outer\r\ncircle represent the calyx; the next, corolla; within, stamens (here in\r\ntwo circles of three each, and the cross-section is through the\r\nanthers); in the centre, section of three ovaries joined into a compound\r\none of three cells.]\r\n\r\n242. =Alternation of the successive Circles.= In these flowers the parts\r\nof the successive circles _alternate_; and such is the rule. That is,\r\nthe petals stand over the intervals between the sepals; the stamens,\r\nwhen of the same number, stand over the intervals between the petals; or\r\nwhen twice as many, as in the Trillium, the outer set alternates with\r\nthe petals, and the inner set, alternating with the other, of course\r\nstands before the petals; and the pistils alternate with these. This is\r\njust as it should be on the theory that the circles of the blossom\r\nanswer to whorls of leaves, which alternate in this way. While in such\r\nflowers the circles are to be regarded as whorls, in others they are\r\nrather to be regarded as condensed spirals of alternate leaves. But,\r\nhowever this may be, in the mind of a morphological botanist,\r\n\r\n243. =Flowers are altered Branches=, and their parts, therefore, altered\r\nleaves. That is, certain buds, which might have grown and lengthened\r\ninto a leafy branch, do, under other circumstances and to accomplish\r\nother purposes, develop into blossoms. In these the axis remains short,\r\nnearly as it is in the bud; the leaves therefore remain close together\r\nin sets or circles; the outer ones, those of the calyx, generally\r\npartake more or less of the character of foliage; the next set are more\r\ndelicate, and form the corolla, while the rest, the stamens and pistils,\r\nappear under forms very different from those of ordinary leaves, and are\r\nconcerned in the production of seed. This view gives to Botany an\r\ninterest which one who merely notices the shape and counts the parts of\r\nblossoms, without understanding their plan, has no conception of.\r\n\r\n244. That flowers answer to branches may be shown, first, from their\r\nposition. As explained in the section on Inflorescence, flowers arise\r\nfrom the same places as branches, and from no other; flower-buds, like\r\nleaf-buds, appear either on the summit of a stem, that is, as a terminal\r\nbud, or in the axil of a leaf, as an axillary bud. And, as the plan of a\r\nsymmetrical flower shows, the arrangement of the parts on their axis or\r\nreceptacle is that of leaves upon the stem.\r\n\r\n245. That the sepals and petals are of the nature of leaves is evident\r\nfrom their appearance; they are commonly called the leaves of the\r\nflower. The calyx is most generally green in color, and foliaceous\r\n(leaf-like) in texture. And though the corolla is rarely green, yet\r\nneither are proper leaves always green. In our wild Painted-cup, and in\r\nsome scarlet Sages, common in gardens, the leaves just under the flowers\r\nare of the brightest red or scarlet, often much brighter-colored than\r\nthe corolla itself. And sometimes (as in many Cactuses, and in Carolina\r\nAllspice) there is such a regular gradation from the last leaves of the\r\nplant (bracts or bractlets) into the leaves of the calyx, that it is\r\nimpossible to say where the one ends and the other begins. If sepals are\r\nleaves, so also are petals; for there is no clearly fixed limit between\r\nthem. Not only in the Carolina Allspice and Cactus (Fig. 229), but in\r\nthe Water-Lily (Fig. 228) and in a variety of flowers with more than one\r\nrow of petals, there is such a complete transition between calyx and\r\ncorolla that no one can surely tell how many of the leaves belong to the\r\none and how many to the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228. Series of sepals, petals, and stamens of White\r\nWater-Lily, showing the transitions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229. A Cactus blossom.]\r\n\r\n246. That stamens are of the same general nature as petals, and\r\ntherefore a modification of leaves, is shown by the gradual transitions\r\nthat occur between the one and the other in many blossoms; especially in\r\ncultivated flowers, such as Roses and Camellias, when they begin to\r\n_double_, that is, to change their stamens into petals. Some wild and\r\nnatural flowers show the same interesting transitions. The Carolina\r\nAllspice and the White Water-Lily exhibit complete gradations not only\r\nbetween sepals and petals, but between petals and stamens. The sepals of\r\nour Water-Lily are green outside, but white and petal-like on the\r\ninside; the petals, in many rows, gradually grow narrower towards the\r\ncentre of the flower; some of these are tipped with a trace of a yellow\r\nanther, but still are petals; the next are more contracted and\r\nstamen-like, but with a flat petal-like filament; and a further\r\nnarrowing of this completes the genuine stamen.\r\n\r\n247. Pistils and stamens now and then change into each other in some\r\nWillows; pistils often turn into petals in cultivated flowers; and in\r\nthe Double Cherry they are occasionally replaced by small green leaves.\r\nSometimes a whole blossom changes into a cluster of green leaves, as in\r\nthe \"green roses\" occasionally noticed in gardens, and sometimes it\r\ndegenerates into a leafy branch. So the botanist regards pistils also as\r\nanswering to leaves; that is, to single leaves when simple and separate,\r\nto a whorl of leaves when conjoined.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4. MODIFICATIONS OF THE TYPE.\r\n\r\n248. =The Deviations=, as they may be called, from the assumed type or\r\npattern of flower are most various and extensive. The differences\r\nbetween one species and another of the same genus are comparatively\r\ninsignificant; those between different genera are more striking; those\r\nbetween different families and classes of plants more and more profound.\r\nThey represent different adaptations to conditions or modes of life,\r\nsome of which have obvious or probable utilities, although others are\r\nbeyond particular explanation. The principal modifications may be\r\nconveniently classified. First those which in place of perfect\r\n(otherwise called _hermaphrodite_ or bisexual) flowers, give origin to\r\n\r\n249. =Unisexual, or Separated, or Diclinous Flowers=, _imperfect_\r\nflowers, as they have been called in contradistinction to perfect\r\nflowers; but that term is too ambiguous. In these some flowers want the\r\nstamens, while others want the pistils. Taking hermaphrodite flowers as\r\nthe pattern, it is natural to say that the missing organs are\r\n_suppressed_. This expression is justified by the very numerous cases in\r\nwhich the missing parts are _abortive_, that is, are represented by\r\nrudiments or vestiges, which serve to exemplify the plan, although\r\nuseless as to office. Unisexual flowers are\r\n\r\n_Monoecious_ (or _Monoicous_, i. e. of one household), when flowers of\r\nboth sorts or sexes are produced by the same individual plant, as in the\r\nRicinus or Castor-oil Plant, Fig. 230.\r\n\r\n_Dioecious_ (or _Dioicous_, i. e. of separate households), when the\r\ntwo kinds are borne on different plants; as in Willows, Poplars, Hemp,\r\nand Moonseed, Fig. 231, 232.\r\n\r\n_Polygamous_, when the flowers are some of them perfect, and some\r\nstaminate or pistillate only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230. Unisexual flowers of Castor-oil plant: _s_,\r\nstaminate flower; _p_, pistillate flower.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231, staminate, and 232, pistillate flower of\r\nMoonseed.]\r\n\r\n250. A blossom having stamens and no pistil is a _Staminate_ or _Male_\r\nflower. Sometimes it is called a _Sterile_ flower, not appropriately,\r\nfor other flowers may equally be sterile. One having pistil but no\r\nstamens is a _Pistillate_ or _Female_ flower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233. Flower of Anemone Pennsylvanica; apetalous,\r\nhermaphrodite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234. Flower of Saururus or Lizard's-tail; naked, but\r\nhermaphrodite.]\r\n\r\n251. =Incomplete Flowers= are so named in contradistinction to complete:\r\nthey want either one or both of the floral envelopes. Those of Fig. 230\r\nare incomplete, having calyx but no corolla. So is the flower of Anemone\r\n(Fig. 233), although its calyx is colored like a corolla. The flowers of\r\nSaururus or Lizard's-tail, although perfect, have neither calyx nor\r\ncorolla (Fig. 234). Incomplete flowers, accordingly, are\r\n\r\n_Naked_ or _Achlamydeous_, destitute of both floral envelopes, as in\r\nFig. 234, or\r\n\r\n_Apetalous_, when wanting only the corolla. The case of corolla present\r\nand calyx wholly wanting is extremely rare, although there are seeming\r\ninstances. In fact, a single or simple perianth is taken to be a calyx,\r\nunless the absence or abortion of a calyx can be made evident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235. Flower of Mustard. 236. Its stamens and pistil\r\nseparate and enlarged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237. Flower of a Violet. 238. Its calyx and corolla\r\ndisplayed: the five smaller parts are the sepals; the five intervening\r\nlarger ones are the petals.]\r\n\r\n252. In contradistinction to regular and symmetrical, very many flowers\r\nare\r\n\r\n_Irregular_, that is, with the members of some or all of the floral\r\ncircles unequal or dissimilar, and\r\n\r\n_Unsymmetrical_, that is, when the circles of the flower or some of them\r\ndiffer in the number of their members. (Symmetrical and unsymmetrical\r\nare used in a different sense in some recent books, but the older use\r\nshould be adhered to). Want of numerical symmetry and irregularity\r\ncommonly go together; and both are common. Indeed, few flowers are\r\nentirely symmetrical beyond calyx, corolla, and perhaps stamens; and\r\nprobably no irregular blossoms are quite symmetrical.\r\n\r\n253. =Irregular and Unsymmetrical Flowers= may therefore be illustrated\r\ntogether, beginning with cases which are comparatively free from other\r\ncomplications. The blossom of Mustard, and of all the very natural\r\nfamily which it represents (Fig. 235, 236), is regular but unsymmetrical\r\nin the stamens. There are four equal sepals, four equal petals; but six\r\nstamens, and only two members in the pistil, which for the present may\r\nbe left out of view. The want of symmetry is in the stamens. These are\r\nin two circles, an outer and an inner. The outer circle consists of two\r\nstamens only; the inner has its proper number of four. The flower of\r\nViolet, which is on the plan of five, is symmetrical in calyx, corolla,\r\nand stamens, inasmuch as each of these circles consists of five members;\r\nbut it is conspicuously irregular in the corolla, one of the petals\r\nbeing very different from the rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239. Flower of a Larkspur. 240. Its calyx and\r\ncorolla displayed; the five larger parts are the sepals; the four\r\nsmaller, of two shapes, are the petals; the place of the fifth petal is\r\nvacant. 241. Diagram of the same; the place for the missing petal marked\r\nby a dotted line.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242. Flower of a Monkshood. 243. Its parts\r\ndisplayed; five sepals, the upper forming the hood; the two lateral\r\nalike, broad and flat; the two lower small. The two pieces under the\r\nhood represent the corolla, reduced to two odd-shaped petals; in centre\r\nthe numerous stamens and three pistils. 244. Diagram of the calyx and\r\ncorolla; the three dotted lines in the place of missing petals.]\r\n\r\n254. The flowers of Larkspur, and of Monkshood or Aconite, which are\r\nnearly related, are both strikingly irregular in calyx and corolla, and\r\nconsiderably unsymmetrical. In Larkspur (Fig. 239-241) the irregular\r\ncalyx consists of five sepals, one of which, larger than the rest, is\r\nprolonged behind into a large sac or spur; but the corolla is of only\r\nfour petals (of two shapes),--the fifth, needed to complete the\r\nsymmetry, being left out. And the Monkshood (Fig. 242-244) has five very\r\ndissimilar sepals, and a corolla of only two very small and\r\ncuriously-shaped petals,--the three needed to make up the symmetry being\r\nleft out. The stamens in both are out of symmetry with the ground-plan,\r\nbeing numerous. So are the pistils, which are usually diminished to\r\nthree, sometimes to two or to one.\r\n\r\n255. =Flowers with Multiplication of Parts= are very common. The stamens\r\nare indefinitely numerous in Larkspur and in Monkshood (Fig. 242, 243),\r\nwhile the pistils are fewer than the ground-plan suggests. Most\r\nCactus-flowers have all the organs much increased in number (Fig. 229),\r\nand so of the Water-Lily. In Anemone (Fig. 233) the stamens and pistils\r\nare multiplied while the petals are left out. In Buttercups or Crowfoot,\r\nwhile the sepals and petals conform to the ground-plan of five, both\r\nstamens and pistils are indefinitely multiplied (Fig. 245).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245. Flower of Ranunculus bulbosus, or Buttercup, in\r\nsection.]\r\n\r\n256. =Flowers modified by Union of Parts=, so that these parts more or\r\nless lose the appearance of separate leaves or other organs growing out\r\nof the end of the stem or receptacle, are extremely common. There are\r\ntwo kinds of such union, namely:--\r\n\r\n_Coalescence_ of parts of the same circle by their contiguous margins;\r\nand\r\n\r\n_Adnation_, or the union of adjacent circles or unlike parts.\r\n\r\n257. =Coalescence= is not rare in leaves, as in the upper pairs of\r\nHoneysuckles, Fig. 163. It may all the more be expected in the crowded\r\ncircles or whorls of flower-leaves. Datura or Stramonium (Fig. 246)\r\nshows this coalescence both in calyx and corolla, the five sepals and\r\nthe five petals being thus united to near their tips, each into a tube\r\nor long and narrow cup. These unions make needful the following terms:--\r\n\r\n_Gamopetalous_, said of a corolla the petals of which are thus\r\ncoalescent into one body, whether only at base or higher. The union may\r\nextend to the very summit, as in Morning Glory and the like (Fig. 247),\r\nso that the number of petals in it may not be apparent. The old name for\r\nthis was _Monopetalous_, but that means \"one-petalled;\" while\r\ngamopetalous means \"petals united,\" and therefore is the proper term.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246. Flower of Datura Stramonium; gamosepalous and\r\ngamopetalous.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247. Funnelform corolla of a common Morning Glory,\r\ndetached from its polysepalous calyx.]\r\n\r\n_Polypetalous_ is the counterpart term, to denote a corolla of\r\n_distinct_, that is, separate petals. As it means \"many petalled,\" it is\r\nnot the best possible name, but it is the old one and in almost\r\nuniversal use.\r\n\r\n_Gamosepalous_ applies to the calyx when the sepals are in this way\r\nunited.\r\n\r\n_Polysepalous_, to the calyx when of separate sepals or calyx-leaves.\r\n\r\n258. Degree of union or of separation in descriptive botany is expressed\r\nin the same way as is the lobing of leaves (139). See Fig. 249-253, and\r\nthe explanations.\r\n\r\n259. A corolla when gamopetalous commonly shows a distinction (well\r\nmarked in Fig. 249-251) between a contracted tubular portion below, the\r\nTUBE, and the spreading part above, the BORDER or LIMB. The junction\r\nbetween tube and limb, or a more or less enlarged upper portion of the\r\ntube between the two, is the THROAT. The same is true of the calyx.\r\n\r\n260. Some names are given to particular forms of the gamopetalous\r\ncorolla, applicable also to a gamosepalous calyx, such as\r\n\r\n_Wheel-shaped_, or _Rotate_; when spreading out at once, without a tube\r\nor with a very short one, something in the shape of a wheel or of its\r\ndiverging spokes, Fig. 252, 253.\r\n\r\n_Salver-shaped_, or _Salver-form_; when a flat-spreading border is\r\nraised on a narrow tube, from which it diverges at right angles, like\r\nthe salver represented in old pictures, with a slender handle beneath,\r\nFig. 249-251, 255.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248. Polypetalous corolla of Soapwort, of five\r\npetals with long claws or stalk-like bases.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249. Flower of Standing Cypress (Gilia\r\ncoronopifolia); gamopetalous: the tube answering to the long claws in\r\n248, except that they are coalescent: the limb or border (the spreading\r\npart above) is _five-parted_, that is, the petals not there united\r\nexcept at very base.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250. Flower of Cypress-vine (Ipomoea Quamoclit);\r\nlike preceding, but limb _five-lobed_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251. Flower of Ipomoea coccinea; limb almost\r\n_entire_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 252. Wheel-shaped or rotate and five-parted corolla\r\nof Bittersweet, Solanum Dulcamara. 253. Wheel-shaped and five-lobed\r\ncorolla of Potato.]\r\n\r\n_Bell-shaped_, or _Campanulate_; where a short and broad tube widens\r\nupward, in the shape of a bell, as in Fig. 254.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254. Flower of a Campanula or Harebell, with a\r\ncampanulate or bell-shaped corolla; 255, of a Phlox, with salver-shaped\r\ncorolla; 256, of Dead Nettle (Lamium), with labiate _ringent_ (or\r\ngaping) corolla; 257, of Snapdragon, with labiate _personate_ corolla;\r\n258, of Toad-Flax, with a similar corolla spurred at the base.]\r\n\r\n_Funnel-shaped_, or _Funnelform_; gradually spreading at the summit of a\r\ntube which is narrow below, in the shape of a funnel or tunnel, as in\r\nthe corolla of the common Morning Glory (Fig. 247) and of the Stramonium\r\n(Fig. 246).\r\n\r\n_Tubular_; when prolonged into a tube, with little or no spreading at\r\nthe border, as in the corolla of the Trumpet Honeysuckle, the calyx of\r\nStramonium (Fig. 246), etc.\r\n\r\n261. Although sepals and petals are usually all blade or lamina (123),\r\nlike a sessile leaf, yet they may have a contracted and stalk-like base,\r\nanswering to petiole. This is called its CLAW, in Latin _Unguis_.\r\n_Unguiculate_ petals are universal and strongly marked in the Pink\r\ntribe, as in Soapwort (Fig. 248).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259. Unguiculate (clawed) petal of a Silene; with a\r\ntwo-parted crown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 260. A small Passion-flower, with crown of slender\r\nthreads.]\r\n\r\n262. Such petals, and various others, may have an outgrowth of the inner\r\nface into an appendage or fringe, as in Soapwort, and in Silene (Fig.\r\n259), where it is at the junction of claw and blade. This is called a\r\nCROWN, or _Corona_. In Passion-flowers (Fig. 260) the crown consists of\r\nnumerous threads on the base of each petal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261. Front view of a papilionaceous corolla. 262.\r\nThe parts of the same, displayed: _s_, Standard, or Vexillum; _w_,\r\nWings, or Alae; _k_, Keel, or Carina.]\r\n\r\n263. =Irregular Flowers= may be polypetalous, or nearly so, as in the\r\npapilionaceous corolla; but most of them are irregular through\r\ncoalescence, which often much disguises the numerical symmetry also. As\r\naffecting the corolla the following forms have received particular\r\nnames:\r\n\r\n264. =Papilionaceous Corolla=, Fig. 261, 262. This is polypetalous,\r\nexcept that two of the petals cohere, usually but slightly. It belongs\r\nonly to the Leguminous or Pulse family. The name means butterfly-like;\r\nbut the likeness is hardly obvious. The names of the five petals of the\r\n_papilionaceous_ corolla are curiously incongruous. They are,\r\n\r\nThe STANDARD or _Banner_ (_Vexillum_), the large upper petal which is\r\nexternal in the bud and wrapped around the others.\r\n\r\nThe WINGS (_Alae_), the pair of side petals, of quite different shape\r\nfrom the standard.\r\n\r\nThe KEEL (_Carina_), the two lower and usually smallest petals; these\r\nare lightly coalescent into a body which bears some likeness, not to the\r\nkeel, but to the prow of a boat; and this encloses the stamens and\r\npistil. A Pea-blossom is a typical example; the present illustration is\r\nfrom a species of Locust, Robinia hispida.\r\n\r\n265. =Labiate Corolla= (Fig. 256-258), which would more properly have\r\nbeen called _Bilabiate_, that is, two-lipped. This is a common form of\r\ngamopetalous corolla; and the calyx is often bilabiate also. These\r\nflowers are all on the plan of five; and the irregularity in the corolla\r\nis owing to unequal union of the petals as well as to diversity of form.\r\nThe two petals of the upper or posterior side of the flower unite with\r\neach other higher up than with the lateral petals (in Fig. 256, quite to\r\nthe top), forming the _Upper lip_: the lateral and the lower similarly\r\nunite to form the _Lower lip_. The single notch which is generally found\r\nat the summit of the upper lip, and the two notches of the lower lip, or\r\nin other words the two lobes of the upper and the three of the lower\r\nlip, reveal the real composition. So also does the alternation of these\r\nfive parts with those of the calyx outside. When the calyx is also\r\nbilabiate, as in the Sage, this alternation gives three lobes or sepals\r\nto the upper and two to the lower lip. Two forms of the labiate corolla\r\nhave been designated, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Ringent_ or _Gaping_, when the orifice is wide open, as in Fig. 256.\r\n\r\n_Personate_ or _Masked_, when a protuberance or intrusion of the base of\r\nthe lower lip (called a _Palate_) projects over or closes the orifice,\r\nas in Snapdragon and Toad-Flax, Fig. 257, 258.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263. Corolla of a purple Gerardia laid open, showing\r\nthe four stamens; the cross shows where the fifth stamen would be, if\r\npresent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264. Corolla, laid open, and stamens of Pentstemon\r\ngrandiflorus, with a sterile filament in the place of the fifth stamen,\r\nand representing it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265. Corolla of Catalpa laid open, displaying two\r\ngood stamens and three abortive ones or vestiges.]\r\n\r\n266. There are all gradations between labiate and regular corollas. In\r\nthose of Gerardia, of some species of Pentstemon, and of Catalpa (Fig.\r\n263-265), the labiate character is slight, but is manifest on close\r\ninspection. In almost all such flowers the plan of five, which is\r\nobvious or ascertainable in the calyx and corolla, is obscured in the\r\nstamens by the abortion or suppression of one or three of their number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266. Two flower-heads of Chiccory.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267. One of them half cut away, better showing some\r\nof the flowers.]\r\n\r\n267. =Ligulate Corolla.= The ligulate or _Strap-shaped_ corolla mainly\r\nbelongs to the family of Compositae, in which numerous small flowers are\r\ngathered into a head, within an involucre that imitates a calyx. It is\r\nbest exemplified in the Dandelion and in Chiccory (Fig. 266). Each one\r\nof these straps or _Ligules_, looking like so many petals, is the\r\ncorolla of a distinct flower: the base is a short tube, which opens out\r\ninto the ligule: the five minute teeth at the end indicate the number of\r\nconstituent petals. So this is a kind of gamopetalous corolla, which is\r\nopen along one side nearly to the base, and outspread. The nature of\r\nsuch a corolla (and of the stamens also, to be explained in the next\r\nsection) is illustrated by the flower of a Lobelia, Fig. 285.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268. Head of flowers of a Coreopsis, divided\r\nlengthwise.]\r\n\r\n268. In Asters, Daisies, Sunflower, Coreopsis (Fig. 268), and the like,\r\nonly the marginal (or _Ray_) corollas are ligulate; the rest (those of\r\nthe _Disk_) are regularly gamopetalous, tubular, and five-lobed at\r\nsummit; but they are small and individually inconspicuous, only the\r\n_ray-flowers_ making a show. In fact, those of Coreopsis and of\r\nSunflower are simply for show, these ray-flowers being not only sterile,\r\nbut _neutral_, that is, having neither stamens nor pistil. But in\r\nAsters, Daisies, Golden-rods, and the like, these ray-flowers are\r\npistillate and fertile, serving therefore for seed-bearing as well as\r\nfor show. Let it not be supposed that the show is useless. See Section\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269. A slice of the preceding more enlarged, with\r\none tubular perfect flower (_a_) left standing on the receptacle, with\r\nits bractlet or chaff (_b_), one ligulate and neutral ray-flower (_cc_)\r\nand part of another; _dd_, section of bracts or leaves of the\r\ninvolucre.]\r\n\r\n269. =Adnation, or Consolidation=, is the union of the members of parts\r\nbelonging to different circles of the flower (256). It is of course\r\nunderstood that in this (as likewise in coalescence) the parts are not\r\nformed and then conjoined, but are produced in union. They are born\r\nunited, as the term _adnate_ implies. To illustrate this kind of union,\r\ntake the accompanying series of flowers (Fig. 270-274), shown in\r\nvertical section. In the first, Fig. 270, Flax-flower, there is no\r\nadnation; sepals, petals, and stamens, are _free_ as well as distinct,\r\nbeing separately borne on the receptacle, one circle within or above the\r\nnext; only the five pistils have their ovaries coalescent. In Fig. 271,\r\na Cherry-flower, the petals and stamens are borne on the throat of the\r\ncalyx-tube; that is, the sepals are coalescent into a cup, and the\r\npetals and stamens are adnate to the inner face of this; in other\r\nwords, the sepals, petals, and stamens are all consolidated up to a\r\ncertain height. In Fig. 272, a Purslane-flower, the same parts are\r\nadnate to or consolidated with the ovary up to its middle. In Fig. 273,\r\na Hawthorn-flower, the consolidation has extended over the whole ovary;\r\nand petals and stamens are adnate to the calyx still further. In Fig.\r\n274, a Cranberry-blossom, it is the same except that all the parts are\r\nfree at the same height; all seem to arise from the top of the ovary.\r\n\r\n270. In botanical description, to express tersely such differences in\r\nthe relation of these organs to the pistil, they are said to be\r\n\r\n_Hypogynous_ (i. e. under the pistil) when they are all _free_, that is,\r\nnot adnate to pistil nor connate with each other, as in Fig. 270.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270. Flax-flower in section; the parts all\r\nfree,--hypogynous.]\r\n\r\n_Perigynous_ (around the pistil) when connate with each other, that is,\r\nwhen petals and stamens are _inserted_ or borne on the calyx, whether as\r\nin Cherry-flowers (Fig. 271) they are free from the pistil, or as in\r\nPurslane and Hawthorn (Fig. 272, 273) they are also adnate below to the\r\novary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271. Cherry-flower in section; petals and stamens\r\nadnate to tube of calyx,--perigynous.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272. Purslane-flower in section; calyx, petals,\r\nstamens, all adnate to lower half of ovary,--perigynous.]\r\n\r\n_Epigynous_ (on the ovary) when so adnate that all these parts appear to\r\narise from the very summit of the ovary, as in Fig. 274. The last two\r\nterms are not very definitely distinguished.\r\n\r\n271. Another and a simpler form of expression is to describe parts of\r\nthe flower as being\r\n\r\n_Free_, when not united with or _inserted_ upon other parts.\r\n\r\n_Distinct_, when parts of the same kind are not united. This term is the\r\ncounterpart of coalescent, as free is the counterpart of adnate. Many\r\nwriters use the term \"free\" indiscriminately for both; but it is better\r\nto distinguish them.\r\n\r\n_Connate_ is a term common for either not free or not distinct, that\r\nis, for parts united congenitally, whether of same or of different\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n_Adnate_, as properly used, relates to the union of dissimilar parts.\r\n\r\n272. In still another form of expression, the terms superior and\r\ninferior have been much used in the sense of above and below.\r\n\r\n_Superior_ is said of the ovary of Flax-flower, Cherry, etc., because\r\nabove the other parts; it is equivalent to \"ovary free.\" Or it is said\r\nof the calyx, etc., when above the ovary, as in Fig. 273-275.\r\n\r\n_Inferior_, when applied to the ovary, means the same as \"calyx adnate;\"\r\nwhen applied to the floral envelopes, it means that they are free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273. Hawthorn-blossom in section; parts adnate to\r\nwhole face of ovary, and with each other beyond; another grade of\r\nperigynous.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274. Cranberry-blossom in section; parts epigynous.]\r\n\r\n273. =Position of Flower or of its Parts.= The terms superior and\r\ninferior, or upper and lower, are also used to indicate the relative\r\nposition of the parts of a flower in reference to the axis of\r\ninflorescence. An axillary flower stands between the bract or leaf which\r\nsubtends it and the axis or stem which bears this bract or leaf. This is\r\nrepresented in sectional diagrams (as in Fig. 275, 276) by a transverse\r\nline for the bract, and a small circle for the axis of inflorescence.\r\nNow the side of the blossom which faces the bract is the\r\n\r\n_Anterior_, or _Inferior_, or _Lower_ side; while the side next the axis\r\nis the\r\n\r\n_Posterior_, or _Superior_, or _Upper_ side of the flower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 275. Diagram of papilionaceous flower (Robinia, Fig.\r\n261), with bract below; axis of inflorescence above.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276. Diagram of Violet-flower; showing the relation\r\nof parts to bract and axis.]\r\n\r\n274. So, in the labiate corolla (Fig. 256-258), the lip which is\r\ncomposed of three of the five petals is the _anterior_, or _inferior_,\r\nor _lower_ lip; the other is the _posterior_, or _superior_, or _upper_\r\nlip.\r\n\r\n275. In Violets (Fig. 238, 276), the odd sepal is posterior (next the\r\naxis); the odd petal is therefore anterior, or next the subtending leaf.\r\nIn the papilionaceous flower (Fig. 261, and diagram, Fig. 275), the odd\r\nsepal is anterior, and so two sepals are posterior; consequently, by the\r\nalternation, the odd petal (the standard) is posterior or upper, and the\r\ntwo petals forming the keel are anterior or lower.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5. ARRANGEMENT OF PARTS IN THE BUD.\r\n\r\n276. =AEstivation= was the fanciful name given by Linnaeus to denote the\r\ndisposition of the parts, especially the leaves of the flower, before\r\n_Anthesis_, i. e. before the blossom opens. _Praefloration_, a better\r\nterm, is sometimes used. This is of importance in distinguishing\r\ndifferent families or genera of plants, being generally uniform in each.\r\nThe aestivation is best seen by making a slice across the flower-bud; and\r\nit may be expressed in diagrams, as in the accompanying figures.\r\n\r\n277. The pieces of the calyx or the corolla either overlap each other in\r\nthe bud, or they do not. When they do not overlap, the aestivation is\r\n\r\n_Valvate_, when the pieces meet each other by their abrupt edges,\r\nwithout any infolding or overlapping; as the calyx of the Linden or\r\nBasswood (Fig. 277).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277. Diagram of a flower of Linden, showing the\r\ncalyx valvate and corolla imbricate in the bud, etc.]\r\n\r\n_Induplicate_, which is valvate with the margins of each piece\r\nprojecting inwards, as in the calyx of a common Virgin's-bower, Fig.\r\n278, or\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278. Valvate-induplicate aestivation of calyx of\r\ncommon Virgin's-bower.]\r\n\r\n_Involute_, which is the same but the margins rolled inward, as in most\r\nof the large-flowered species of Clematis, Fig. 279.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279. Valvate-involute aestivation of same in\r\nVine-bower, Clematis Vitialla.]\r\n\r\n_Reduplicate_, a rarer modification of valvate, is similar but with\r\nmargins projecting outward.\r\n\r\n_Open_, the parts not touching in the bud, as the calyx of Mignonette.\r\n\r\n278. When the pieces overlap in the bud, it is in one of two ways;\r\neither every piece has one edge in and one edge out, or some pieces are\r\nwholly outside and others wholly inside. In the first case the\r\naestivation is\r\n\r\n_Convolute_, also named _Contorted_ or _Twisted_, as in Fig. 280, a\r\ncross-section of a corolla very strongly thus convolute or rolled up\r\ntogether, and in the corolla of a Flax-flower (Fig. 281), where the\r\npetals only moderately overlap in this way. Here one edge of every petal\r\ncovers the next before it, while its other edge is covered by the next\r\nbehind it. The other mode is the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280. Convolute aestivation, as in the corolla-lobes\r\nof Oleander.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281. Diagram of a Flax-flower; calyx imbricated and\r\ncorolla convolute in the bud.]\r\n\r\n_Imbricate_ or _Imbricated_, in which the outer parts cover or overlap\r\nthe inner so as to \"break joints,\" like tiles or shingles on a roof;\r\nwhence the name. When the parts are three, the first or outermost is\r\nwholly external, the third wholly internal, the second has one margin\r\ncovered by the first while the other overlaps the third or innermost\r\npiece: this is the arrangement of alternate three-ranked leaves (187).\r\nWhen there are five pieces, as in the corolla of Fig. 225, and calyx of\r\nFig. 281, as also of Fig. 241, 276, two are external, two are internal,\r\nand one (the third in the spiral) has one edge covered by the outermost,\r\nwhile its other edge covers the innermost; which is just the five-ranked\r\narrangement of alternate leaves (188). When the pieces are four, two are\r\nouter and two are inner; which answers to the arrangement of opposite\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n279. The imbricate and the convolute modes sometimes vary one into the\r\nother, especially in the corolla.\r\n\r\n280. In a gamopetalous corolla or gamosepalous calyx, the shape of the\r\ntube in the bud may sometimes be noticeable. It may be\r\n\r\n_Plicate_ or _Plaited_, that is, folded lengthwise; and the plaits may\r\neither be turned outwards, forming projecting ridges, as in the corolla\r\nof Campanula; or turned inwards, as in that of Gentian Belladonna; or\r\n\r\n_Supervolute_, when the plaits are convolutely wrapped round each other,\r\nas in the corolla of Morning Glory and of Stramonium, Fig. 282.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282. Upper part of corolla of Datura Stramonium in\r\nthe bud; and below a section showing the convolution of the plaits.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection IX. STAMENS IN PARTICULAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n281. =Androecium= is a technical name for the staminate system of a\r\nflower (that is, for the stamens taken together), which it is sometimes\r\nconvenient to use. The preceding section has dealt with modifications of\r\nthe flower pertaining mainly to calyx and corolla. Those relating to the\r\nstamens are now to be indicated. First as to\r\n\r\n282. Insertion, or place of attachment. The stamens usually go with the\r\npetals. Not rarely they are at base\r\n\r\n_Epipetalous_, that is, inserted on (or adnate to) the corolla, as in\r\nFig. 283. When free from the corolla, they may be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283. Corolla of Morning Glory laid open, to show the\r\nfive stamens inserted on it, near the base.]\r\n\r\n_Hypogynous_, inserted on the receptacle under the pistil or gynoecium.\r\n\r\n_Perigynous_, inserted on the calyx, that is, with the lower part of\r\nfilament adnate to the calyx-tube.\r\n\r\n_Epigynous_, borne apparently on the top of the ovary; all which is\r\nexplained in Fig. 270-274.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284. Style of a Lady's Slipper (Cypripedium), and\r\nstamens united with it; _a_, _a_, the anthers of the two good stamens;\r\n_st_, an abortive stamen, what should be its anther changed into a\r\npetal-like body; _stig_, the stigma.]\r\n\r\n_Gynandrous_ is another term relating to insertion of rarer occurrence,\r\nthat is, where the stamens are inserted on (in other words, adnate to)\r\nthe style, as in Lady's Slipper (Fig. 284), and in the Orchis family\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n283. =In Relation to each Other=, stamens are more commonly\r\n\r\n_Distinct_, that is, without any union with each other. But when united,\r\nthe following technical terms of long use indicate their modes of mutual\r\nconnection:--\r\n\r\n_Monadelphous_ (from two Greek words, meaning \"in one brotherhood\"),\r\nwhen united by their filaments into one set, usually into a ring or cup\r\nbelow, or into a tube, as in the Mallow Family (Fig. 286), the\r\nPassion-flower (Fig. 260), the Lupine (Fig. 287), and in Lobelia (Fig.\r\n285).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285. Flower of Lobelia cardinalis, Cardinal flower;\r\ncorolla making approach to the ligulate form; filaments (_st_)\r\nmonadelphous, and anthers (_a_) syngenesious.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286. Flower of a Mallow, with calyx and corolla cut\r\naway; showing monadelphous stamens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287. Monadelphous stamens of Lupine. 288.\r\nDiadelphous stamens (9 and 1) of a Pea-blossom.]\r\n\r\n_Diadelphous_ (meaning in two brotherhoods), when united by the\r\nfilaments into two sets, as in the Pea and most of its near relatives\r\n(Fig. 288), usually nine in one set, and one in the other.\r\n\r\n_Triadelphous_ (three brotherhoods), when the filaments are united in\r\nthree sets or clusters, as in most species of Hypericum.\r\n\r\n_Pentadelphous_ (five brotherhoods), when in five sets, as in some\r\nspecies of Hypericum and in American Linden (Fig. 277, 289).\r\n\r\n_Polyadelphous_ (many or several brotherhoods) is the term generally\r\nemployed when these sets are several, or even more than two, and the\r\nparticular number is left unspecified. These terms all relate to the\r\nfilaments.\r\n\r\n_Syngenesious_ is the term to denote that stamens have their anthers\r\nunited, coalescent into a ring or tube; as in Lobelia (Fig. 285), in\r\nViolets, and in all of the great family of Compositae.\r\n\r\n284. =Their Number= in a flower is commonly expressed directly, but\r\nsometimes adjectively, by a series of terms which were the name of\r\nclasses in the Linnaean artificial system, of which the following names,\r\nas also the preceding, are a survival:--\r\n\r\n_Monandrous_, i. e. solitary-stamened, when the flower has only one\r\nstamen,\r\n\r\n_Diandrous_, when it has two stamens only,\r\n\r\n_Triandrous_, when it has three stamens,\r\n\r\n_Tetrandrous_, when it has four stamens,\r\n\r\n_Pentandrous_, when it has five stamens,\r\n\r\n_Hexandrous_, when with six stamens, and so on to\r\n\r\n_Polyandrous_, when it has many stamens, or more than a dozen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289. One of the five stamen-clusters of the flower\r\nof American Linden, with accompanying scale. The five clusters are shown\r\nin section in the diagram of this flower, Fig. 277.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290. Five syngenesious stamens of a Coreopsis. 291.\r\nSame, with tube laid open and displayed.]\r\n\r\n285. For which terms, see the Glossary. They are all Greek numerals\r\nprefixed to _-andria_ (from the Greek), which Linnaeus used for\r\n_androecium_, and are made into an English adjective, _-androus_. Two\r\nother terms, of same origin, designate particular cases of number (four\r\nor six) in connection with unequal length. Namely, the stamens are\r\n\r\n_Didynamous_, when, being only four, they form two pairs, one pair\r\nlonger than the other, as in the Trumpet Creeper, in Gerardia (Fig.\r\n263), etc.\r\n\r\n_Tetradynamous_, when, being only six, four of them surpass the other\r\ntwo, as in the Mustard-flower and all the Cruciferous family, Fig. 235.\r\n\r\n286. =The Filament= is a kind of stalk to the anther, commonly slender\r\nor thread-like: it is to the anther nearly what the petiole is to the\r\nblade of a leaf. Therefore it is not an essential part. As a leaf may be\r\nwithout a stalk, so the anther may be _Sessile_, or without a filament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292. Stamen of Isopyrum, with innate anther. 293. Of\r\nTulip-tree, with adnate (and extrorse) anther. 294. Of Evening Primrose,\r\nwith versatile anther.]\r\n\r\n287. =The Anther= is the essential part of the stamen. It is a sort of\r\ncase, filled with a fine powder, _the Pollen_, which serves to fertilize\r\nthe pistil, so that it may perfect seeds. The anther is said to be\r\n\r\n_Innate_ (as in Fig. 292), when it is attached by its base to the very\r\napex of the filament, turning neither inward nor outward;\r\n\r\n_Adnate_ (as in Fig. 293), when attached as it were by one face, usually\r\nfor its whole length, to the side of a continuation of the filament; and\r\n\r\n_Versatile_ (as in Fig. 294), when fixed by or near its middle only to\r\nthe very point of the filament, so as to swing loosely, as in the Lily,\r\nin Grasses, etc. Versatile or adnate anthers are\r\n\r\n_Introrse_, or _Incumbent_, when facing inward, that is, toward the\r\ncentre of the flower, as in Magnolia, Water-Lily, etc.\r\n\r\n_Extrorse_, when facing outwardly, as in the Tulip-tree.\r\n\r\n288. Rarely does a stamen bear any resemblance to a leaf, or even to a\r\npetal or flower-leaf. Nevertheless, the botanist's idea of a stamen is\r\nthat it answers to a leaf developed in a peculiar form and for a special\r\npurpose. In the filament he sees the stalk of the leaf; in the anther,\r\nthe blade. The blade of a leaf consists of two similar sides; so the\r\nanther consists of two LOBES or CELLS, one answering to the left, the\r\nother to the right, side of the blade. The two lobes are often connected\r\nby a prolongation of the filament, which answers to the midrib of a\r\nleaf; this is called the CONNECTIVE. This is conspicuous in Fig. 292,\r\nwhere the connective is so broad that it separates the two cells of the\r\nanther to some distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295. Diagram of the lower part of an anther, cut\r\nacross above, and the upper part of a leaf, to show how the one answers\r\nto the other; the filament to petiole, the connective to midrib; the two\r\ncells to the right and left halves of the blade.]\r\n\r\n289. A simple conception of the morphological relation of an anther to a\r\nleaf is given in Fig. 295, an ideal figure, the lower part representing\r\na stamen with the top of its anther cut away; the upper, the\r\ncorresponding upper part of a leaf.\r\n\r\n290. So anthers are generally _two-celled_. But as the pollen begins to\r\nform in two parts of each cell (the anterior and the posterior),\r\nsometimes these two strata are not confluent, and the anther even at\r\nmaturity may be _four-celled_, as in Moonseed (Fig. 296); or rather, in\r\nthat case (the word _cell_ being used for each lateral half of the\r\norgan), it is _two-celled_, but the cells _bilocellate_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296. Stamen of Moonseed, with anther cut across;\r\nthis 4-celled, or rather 4-locellate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297. Stamen of Pentstemon pubescens; the two\r\nanther-cells diverging, and almost confluent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298. Stamen of Mallow; the anther supposed to answer\r\nto that of Fig. 297, but the cells completely confluent into one.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299. Stamen of Globe Amaranth; very short filament\r\nbearing a single anther-cell; it is open from top to bottom, showing the\r\npollen within.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300-305. Stamens of several plants of the Labiate or\r\nMint Family. Fig. 300. Of a Monarda: the two anther-cells with bases\r\ndivergent so that they are transverse to the filament, and their\r\ncontiguous tips confluent, so as to form one cell opening by a\r\ncontinuous line. Fig. 301. Of a Calamintha: the broad connective\r\nseparating the two cells. Fig. 302. Of a Sage (Salvia Texana); with long\r\nand slender connective resembling forks of the filament, one bearing a\r\ngood anther-cell; the other an abortive or poor one. Fig. 303. Another\r\nSage (S. coccinea), with connective longer and more thread-shaped, the\r\nlower fork having its anther-cell wholly wanting. Fig. 304. Of a White\r\nSage, Audibertia grandiflora; the lower fork of connective a mere\r\nvestige. Fig. 305. Of another White Sage (A. stachyoides), the lower\r\nfork of connective suppressed.]\r\n\r\n291. But anthers may become _one-celled_, and that either by confluence\r\nor by suppression.\r\n\r\n292. By confluence, when the two cells run together into one, as they\r\nnearly do in most species of Pentstemon (Fig. 297), more so in Monarda\r\n(Fig. 300), and completely in the Mallow (Fig. 298) and all the Mallow\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n293. By suppression in certain cases the anther may be reduced to one\r\ncell or halved. In Globe Amaranth (Fig. 299) there is a single cell\r\nwithout vestige of any other. Different species of Sage and of the White\r\nSages of California show various grades of abortion of one of the\r\nanther-cells, along with a singular lengthening of the connective (Fig.\r\n302-305).\r\n\r\n294. The splitting open of an anther for the discharge of its pollen is\r\ntermed its _Dehiscence_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306. Stamen with the usual dehiscence of anther down\r\nthe side of each cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307. Stamen of Pyrola; cells opening by a terminal\r\nhole.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308. Stamen of Barberry; cells of anther each\r\nopening by an uplifted valve.]\r\n\r\n295. As the figures show, this is commonly by a line along the whole\r\nlength of each cell, either lateral or, when the anthers are extrorse,\r\noften along the outer face, and when introrse, along the inner face of\r\neach cell. Sometimes the opening is only by a chink, hole, or pore at\r\nthe top, as in the Azalea, Pyrola (Fig. 307), etc.; sometimes a part of\r\nthe face separates as a sort of trap-door (or valve), hinged at the top,\r\nand opening to allow the escape of the pollen, as in the Sassafras,\r\nSpice-bush, and Barberry (Fig. 308).\r\n\r\n296. =Pollen.= This is the powdery matter, commonly of a yellow color,\r\nwhich fills the cells of the anther, and is discharged during\r\nblossoming, after which the stamens generally fall or wither away. Under\r\nthe microscope it is found to consist of grains, usually round or oval,\r\nand all alike in the same species, but very different in different\r\nplants. So that the plant may sometimes be recognized from the pollen\r\nalone. Several forms are shown in the accompanying figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309. Magnified pollen of a Lily, smooth and oval;\r\n310, of Echinocystis, grooved lengthwise; 311, of Sicyos, with bristly\r\npoints and smooth bands; 312, of Musk Plant (Mimulus), with spiral\r\ngrooves; 313, of Succory, twelve-sided and dotted.]\r\n\r\n297. An ordinary pollen-grain has two coats; the outer coat thickish,\r\nbut weak, and frequently adorned with lines or bands, or studded with\r\npoints; the inner coat is extremely thin and delicate, but extensible,\r\nand its cavity when fresh contains a thickish protoplasmic fluid, often\r\nrendered turbid by an immense number of minute particles that float in\r\nit. As the pollen matures this fluid usually dries up, but the\r\nprotoplasm does not lose its vitality. When the grain is wetted it\r\nabsorbs water, swells up, and is apt to burst, discharging the contents.\r\nBut when weak syrup is used it absorbs this slowly, and the tough inner\r\ncoat will sometimes break through the outer and begin a kind of growth,\r\nlike that which takes place when the pollen is placed upon the stigma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314. Magnified pollen of Hibiscus and other\r\nMallow-plants, beset with prickly projections; 315, of Circaea, with\r\nangles bearing little lobes; 316, of Evening Primrose, the three lobes\r\nas large as the central body; 317, of Kalmia, four grains united, as in\r\nmost of the Heath family; 318, of Pine, as it were of three grains or\r\ncells united; the lateral empty and light.]\r\n\r\n298. Some pollen-grains are, as it were, lobed (as in Fig. 315, 316), or\r\nformed of four grains united (as in the Heath family, Fig. 317): that of\r\nPine (Fig. 318) has a large rounded and empty bladder-like expansion\r\nupon each side. This renders such pollen very buoyant, and capable of\r\nbeing transported to a great distance by the wind.\r\n\r\n299. In species of Acacia simple grains lightly cohere into globular\r\npellets. In Milkweeds and in most Orchids all the pollen of an\r\nanther-cell is compacted or coherent into one mass, called a\r\n_Pollen-mass_, or POLLINIUM, plural POLLINIA. (Fig. 319-322.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319. Pollen, a pair of pollinia of a Milkweed,\r\nAsclepias, attached by stalks to a gland; moderately magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320.

One of the partial pollinia, torn up at top to\r\nshow the grains (which are each composed of four), and highly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection X. PISTILS IN PARTICULAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. ANGIOSPERMOUS OR ORDINARY GYNOECIUM.\r\n\r\n300. =Gynoecium= is the technical name for the pistil or pistils of a\r\nflower taken collectively, or for whatever stands in place of these. The\r\nvarious modifications of the gynoecium and the terms which relate to\r\nthem require particular attention.\r\n\r\n301. The PISTIL, when only one, occupies the centre of the flower; when\r\nthere are two pistils, they stand facing each other in the centre of the\r\nflower; when several, they commonly form a ring or circle; and when very\r\nnumerous, they are generally crowded in rows or spirals on the surface\r\nof a more or less enlarged or elongated receptacle. Their number gives\r\nrise to certain terms, the counterpart of those used for stamens (284),\r\nwhich are survivals of the names of orders in the Linnaean artificial\r\nsystem. The names were coined by prefixing Greek numerals to _-gynia_\r\nused for gynoecium, and changed into adjectives in the form of\r\n_-gynous_. That is, a flower is\r\n\r\n_Monogynous_, when it has a single pistil, whether that be simple or\r\ncompound;\r\n\r\n_Digynous_, when it has only two pistils; _Trigynous_, when with three;\r\n_Tetragynous_, with four; _Pentagynous_, with five; _Hexagynous_, with\r\nsix; and so on to _Polygynous_, with many pistils.\r\n\r\n302. =The Parts of a Complete Pistil=, as already twice explained (16,\r\n236), are the OVARY, the STYLE, and the STIGMA. The ovary is one\r\nessential part: it contains the rudiments of seeds, called OVULES. The\r\nstigma at the summit is also essential: it receives the pollen, which\r\nfertilizes the ovules in order that they may become seeds. But the\r\nstyle, commonly a tapering or slender column borne on the summit of the\r\novary, and bearing the stigma on its apex or its side, is no more\r\nnecessary to a pistil than the filament is to the stamen. Accordingly,\r\nthere is no style in many pistils: in these the stigma is _sessile_,\r\nthat is, rests directly on the ovary (as in Fig. 326). The stigma is\r\nvery various in shape and appearance, being sometimes a little knob (as\r\nin the Cherry, Fig. 271), sometimes a point or small surface of bare\r\ntissue (as in Fig. 327-330), and sometimes a longitudinal crest or line\r\n(as in Fig. 324, 341-343), or it may occupy the whole length of the\r\nstyle, as in Fig. 331.\r\n\r\n303. The word Pistil (Latin, _Pistillum_) means a pestle. It came into\r\nuse in the first place for such flowers as those of Crown Imperial, or\r\nLily, in which the pistil in the centre was likened to the pestle, and\r\nthe perianth around it to the mortar, of the apothecary.\r\n\r\n304. A pistil is either _simple_ or _compound_. It is simple when it\r\nanswers to a single flower-leaf, compound when it answers to two or\r\nthree, or a fuller circle of such leaves conjoined.\r\n\r\n305. =Carpels.= It is convenient to have a name for each flower-leaf of\r\nthe gynoecium; so it is called a _Carpel_, in Latin _Carpellum_ or\r\n_Carpidium_. A simple pistil is a carpel. Each component flower-leaf of\r\na compound pistil is likewise a carpel. When a flower has two or more\r\npistils, these of course are simple pistils, that is, separate carpels\r\nor pistil-leaves. There may be only a single simple pistil to the\r\nflower, as in a Pea or Cherry blossom (Fig. 271); there may be two such,\r\nas in many Saxifrages; or many, as in the Strawberry. More commonly the\r\nsingle pistil in the centre of a blossom is a compound one. Then there\r\nis seldom much difficulty in ascertaining the number of carpels or\r\npistil-leaves that compose it.\r\n\r\n306. =The Simple Pistil=, viewed morphologically, answers to a\r\nleaf-blade with margins incurved and united where they meet, so forming\r\na closed case or pod (the ovary), and bearing ovules at the suture or\r\njunction of these margins: a tapering upper portion with margins\r\nsimilarly inrolled, is supposed to form the style; and these same\r\nmargins, exposed at the tip or for a portion of the length, become the\r\nstigma. Compare, under this view, the three accompanying figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 323. An inrolled small leaf, such as in\r\ndouble-flowered Cherry blossoms is often seen to occupy the place of a\r\npistil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 324. A simple pistil (of Isopyrum), with ovary cut\r\nacross; the inner (ventral) face turned toward the eye: the ovules seem\r\nto be borne on the ventral suture, answering to leaf-margins: the stigma\r\nabove seen also to answer to leaf-margins.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325. Pod or simple pistil of Caltha or\r\nMarsh-Marigold, which has opened, and shed its seeds.]\r\n\r\n307. So a simple pistil should have a one-celled ovary, only one line of\r\nattachment for the ovules, a single style, and a single stigma. Certain\r\nvariations from this normal condition which sometimes occur do not\r\ninvalidate this morphological conception. For instance, the stigma may\r\nbecome two-lobed or two-ridged, because it consists of two leaf-margins,\r\nas Fig. 324 shows; it may become 2-locellate by the turning or growing\r\ninward of one of the sutures, so as to divide the cavity.\r\n\r\n308. There are two or three terms which primarily relate to the parts of\r\na simple pistil or carpel, and are thence carried on to the compound\r\npistil, viz.:--\r\n\r\nVENTRAL SUTURE, the line which answers to the united margins of the\r\ncarpel-leaf, therefore naturally called a suture or seam, and the\r\nventral or inner one, because in the circle of carpel-leaves it looks\r\ninward or to the centre of the flower.\r\n\r\nDORSAL SUTURE is the line down the back of the carpel, answering to the\r\nmidrib of the leaf,--not a seam therefore; but at maturity many fruits,\r\nsuch as pea-pods, open by this dorsal as well as by the ventral line.\r\n\r\nPLACENTA, a name given to the surface, whatever it be, which bears the\r\novules and seeds. The name may be needless when the ovules grow directly\r\non the ventral suture, or from its top or bottom; but when there are\r\nmany ovules there is usually some expansion of an ovule-bearing or\r\nseed-bearing surface; as is seen in our Mandrake or Podophyllum, Fig.\r\n326.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326. Simple pistil of Podophyllum, cut across,\r\nshowing ovules borne on placenta.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 327. Pistil of a Saxifrage, of two simple carpels or\r\npistil-leaves, united at the base only, cut across both above and\r\nbelow.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 328. Compound 3-carpellary pistil of common St.\r\nJohn's-wort, cut across: the three styles separate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 329. The same of shrubby St. John's-wort; the three\r\nstyles as well as ovaries here united into one.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 330. Compound 3-carpellary pistil of Tradescantia or\r\nSpiderwort; the three stigmas as well as styles and ovary completely\r\ncoalescent into one.]\r\n\r\n309. =A Compound Pistil= is a combination of two, three, or a greater\r\nnumber of pistil-leaves or carpels in a circle, united into one body, at\r\nleast by their ovaries. The annexed figures should make it clear. A\r\nseries of Saxifrages might be selected the gynoecium of which would\r\nshow every gradation between two simple pistils, or separate carpels,\r\nand their complete coalescence into one compound and two-celled ovary.\r\nEven when the constituent styles and stigmas are completely coalescent\r\ninto one, the nature of the combination is usually revealed by some\r\nexternal lines or grooves, or (as in Fig. 328-330) by the internal\r\npartitions, or the number of the placentae. The simplest case of compound\r\npistil is that\r\n\r\n310. =With two or more Cells and Axile Placentae=, namely, with as many\r\ncells as there are carpels, that have united to compose the organ. Such\r\na pistil is just what would be formed if the simple pistils (two, three,\r\nor five in a circle, as the case may be), like those of a Paeony or\r\nStonecrop (Fig. 224, 225), pressed together in the centre of the flower,\r\nwere to cohere by their contiguous parts. In such a case the placentae\r\nare naturally _axile_, or all brought together in the axis or centre;\r\nand the ovary has as many DISSEPIMENTS, or internal _Partitions_, as\r\nthere are carpels in its composition. For these are the contiguous and\r\ncoalescent walls or sides of the component carpels. When such pistils\r\nripen into pods, they often separate along these lines into their\r\nelementary carpels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331, 332. Pistil of a Sandwort, with vertical and\r\ntransverse section of the ovary: free central placenta.]\r\n\r\n311. =One-celled, with free Central Placenta.= The commoner case is that\r\nof Purslane (Fig. 272) and of the Pink and Chickweed families (Fig. 331,\r\n332). This is explained by supposing that the partitions (such as those\r\nof Fig. 329) have early vanished or have been suppressed. Indeed, traces\r\nof them may often be detected in Pinks. On the other hand, it is equally\r\nsupposable that in the Primula family the free central is derived from\r\nparietal placentation by the carpels bearing ovules only at base, and\r\nforming a consolidated common placenta in the axis. Mitella and Dionaea\r\nhelp out this conception.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333. Plan of a one-celled ovary of three\r\ncarpel-leaves, with parietal placentae, cut across below, where it is\r\ncomplete; the upper part showing the top of the three leaves it is\r\ncomposed of, approaching, but not united.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334. Cross section of the ovary of Frost weed\r\n(Helianthemum), with three parietal placentae, bearing ovules.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 335. Cross section of an ovary of Hypericum\r\ngraveolens, the three large placentae meeting in the centre, so as to\r\nform a three-celled ovary. 336. Same in fruit, the placentae now separate\r\nand rounded.]\r\n\r\n312. =One-celled, with Parietal Placentae.= In this not uncommon case it\r\nis conceived that the two or three or more carpel-leaves of such a\r\ncompound pistil coalesce by their adjacent edges, just as sepal-leaves\r\ndo to form a gamosepalous calyx, or petals to form a gamopetalous\r\ncorolla, and as is shown in the diagram, Fig. 333, and in an actual\r\ncross-section, Fig. 334. Here each carpel is an open leaf, or with some\r\nintroflexion, bearing ovules along its margins; and each placenta\r\nconsists of the contiguous margins of two pistil-leaves grown together.\r\nThere is every gradation between this and the three-celled ovary with\r\nthe placentae in the axis, even in the same genus, sometimes even in\r\ndifferent stages in the same pistil (Fig. 335, 336).\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. GYMNOSPERMOUS GYNOECIUM.\r\n\r\n313. The ordinary pistil has a closed ovary, and accordingly the pollen\r\ncan act upon the contained ovules only indirectly, through the stigma.\r\nThis is expressed in a term of Greek derivation, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Angiospermous_, meaning that the seeds are borne in a sac or closed\r\nvessel. The counterpart term is\r\n\r\n_Gymnospermous_, meaning naked-seeded. This kind of pistil, or\r\ngynoecium, the simplest of all, yet the most peculiar, characterizes\r\nthe Pine family and its relatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337.

Branchlet of the American Arbor-Vitae,\r\nconsiderably larger than in nature, terminated by its pistillate\r\nflowers, each consisting of a single scale (an open pistil), together\r\nforming a small cone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 339. One of the scales or carpels of the last,\r\nremoved and more enlarged, the inside exposed to view, showing a pair of\r\novules on its base.]\r\n\r\n314. While the ordinary simple pistil is conceived by the botanist to be\r\na leaf rolled together into a closed pod (306), those of the Pine, Larch\r\n(Fig. 337), Cedar, and Arbor-Vitae (Fig. 338, 339) are open leaves, in\r\nthe form of scales, each bearing two or more ovules on the inner face,\r\nnext the base. At the time of blossoming, these pistil-leaves of the\r\nyoung cone diverge, and the pollen, so abundantly shed from the\r\nstaminate blossoms, falls directly upon the exposed ovules. Afterward\r\nthe scales close over each other until the seeds are ripe. Then they\r\nseparate that the seeds may be shed. As the pollen acts directly on the\r\novules, such pistil (or organ acting as pistil) has no stigma.\r\n\r\n315. In the Yew, and in Torreya and Gingko, the gynoecium is reduced\r\nto extremest simplicity, that is, to a naked ovule, without any visible\r\ncarpel.\r\n\r\n316. In Cycas the large naked ovules are borne on the margins or lobes\r\nof an obvious open leaf. All GYMNOSPERMOUS plants have other\r\npeculiarities, also distinguishing them, as a class, from ANGIOSPERMOUS\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection XI. OVULES.\r\n\r\n\r\n317. =Ovule= (from the Latin, meaning a little egg) is the technical\r\nname of that which in the flower answers to and becomes the seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 340. A cluster of ovules, pendulous on their\r\nfunicles.]\r\n\r\n318. Ovules are _naked_ in gymnospermous plants (as just described), in\r\nall others they are enclosed in the ovary. They may be produced along\r\nthe whole length of the cell or cells of the ovary, and then they are\r\napt to be numerous, or only from some part of it, generally the top or\r\nthe bottom. In this case they are usually few or single (_solitary_, as\r\nin Fig. 341-343). They may be _sessile_, i. e. without stalk, or they\r\nmay be attached by a distinct stalk, the FUNICLE or FUNICULUS (Fig.\r\n340).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 341. Section of the ovary of a Buttercup,\r\nlengthwise, showing its ascending ovule.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 342. Section of the ovary of Buckwheat, showing the\r\nerect ovule.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 343. Section of the ovary of Anemone, showing its\r\nsuspended ovule.]\r\n\r\n319. Considered as to then position and direction in the ovary, they are\r\n\r\n_Horizontal_, when they are neither turned upward nor downward, as in\r\nPodophyllum (Fig. 326),\r\n\r\n_Ascending_, when rising obliquely upwards, usually from the side of the\r\ncell, not from its very base, as in the Buttercup (Fig. 341), and the\r\nPurslane (Fig. 272),\r\n\r\n_Erect_, when rising upright from the very base of the cell, as in the\r\nBuckwheat (Fig. 342),\r\n\r\n_Pendulous_, when hanging from the side or from near the top, as in the\r\nFlax (Fig. 270), and\r\n\r\n_Suspended_, when hanging perpendicularly from the very summit of the\r\ncell, as in the Anemone (Fig. 343). All these terms equally apply to\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n320. In structure an ovule is a pulpy mass of tissue, usually with one\r\nor two coats or coverings. The following parts are to be noted, viz.--\r\n\r\nKERNEL or NUCLEUS, the body of the ovule. In the Mistletoe and some\r\nrelated plants, there is only this nucleus, the coats being wanting.\r\n\r\nTEGUMENTS, or coats, sometimes only one, more commonly two. When two,\r\none has been called PRIMINE, the other SECUNDINE. It will serve all\r\npurposes to call them simply outer and inner ovule coats.\r\n\r\nORIFICE, or FORAMEN, an opening through the coats at the organic apex of\r\nthe ovule. In the seed it is _Micropyle_.\r\n\r\nCHALAZA, the place where the coats and the kernel of the ovule blend.\r\n\r\nHILUM, the place of junction of the funiculus with the body of the\r\novule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 344. Orthotropous ovule of Buckwheat: _c_, hilum\r\nand chalaza; _f_, orifice.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 345. Campylotropous ovule of a Chickweed: _c_, hilum\r\nand chalaza; _f_, orifice.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 346. Amphitropous ovule of Mallow: _f_, orifice;\r\n_h_, hilum; _r_, rhaphe; _c_, chalaza.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 347. Anatropous ovule of a Violet, the parts\r\nlettered as in the last.]\r\n\r\n321. =The Kinds of Ovules.= The ovules in their growth develop in three\r\nor four different ways and thereby are distinguished into\r\n\r\n_Orthotropous_ or _Straight_, those which develop without curving or\r\nturning, as in Fig. 344. The chalaza is at the insertion or base, the\r\nforamen or orifice is at the apex. This is the simplest, but the least\r\ncommon kind of ovule.\r\n\r\n_Campylotropous_ or _Incurved_, in which, by the greater growth of one\r\nside, the ovule curves into a kidney-shaped outline, so bringing the\r\norifice down close to the base or chalaza; as in Fig. 345.\r\n\r\n_Amphitropous_ or _Half Inverted_, Fig. 346. Here the forming ovule,\r\ninstead of curving perceptibly, keeps its axis nearly straight, and, as\r\nit grows, turns round upon its base so far as to become transverse to\r\nits funiculus, and adnate to its upper part for some distance. Therefore\r\nin this case the attachment of the funiculus or stalk is about the\r\nmiddle, the chalaza is at one end, the orifice at the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 348-350. Three early stages in the growth of ovule\r\nof a Magnolia, showing the forming outer and inner coats which even in\r\nthe later figure have not yet completely enclosed the nucleus; 351,\r\nfurther advanced, and 352, completely anatropous ovule.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353. Longitudinal section, and 354, transverse\r\nsection of 352.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 355. Same as 353, enlarged showing the parts in\r\nsection: _a_, outer coat; _b_, inner coat; _c_, nucleus; _d_, rhaphe.]\r\n\r\n_Anatropous_ or _Inverted_, as in Fig. 347, the commonest kind, so\r\ncalled because in its growth it has as it were turned over upon its\r\nstalk, to which it has continued adnate. The organic base, or chalaza,\r\nthus becomes the apparent summit, and the orifice is at the base, by\r\nthe side of the hilum or place of attachment. The adnate portion of the\r\nfuniculus, which appears as a ridge or cord extending from the hilum to\r\nthe chalaza, and which distinguishes this kind of ovule, is called the\r\nRHAPHE. The amphitropous ovule (Fig. 346) has a short or incomplete\r\nrhaphe.\r\n\r\n322. Fig. 348-352 show the stages through which an ovule becomes\r\nanatropous in the course of its growth. The annexed two figures are\r\nsections of such an ovule at maturity; and Fig. 355 is Fig. 353\r\nenlarged, with the parts lettered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection XII. MODIFICATIONS OF THE RECEPTACLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 356. Longitudinal section of flower of Silene\r\nPennsylvanica, showing stipe between calyx and corolla.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 357. Flower of a Cleome of the section Gynandropsis,\r\nshowing broadened receptacle to bear petals, lengthened stipe below the\r\nstamens, and another between these and pistil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 358. Pistil of Geranium or Cranesbill.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 359. The same, ripe, with the five carpels splitting\r\naway from the long beak (carpophore), and hanging from its top by their\r\nrecurving styles.]\r\n\r\n323. =The Torus= or Receptacle of the flower (237, Fig. 223) is the\r\nportion which belongs to the stem or axis. In all preceding\r\nillustrations it is small and short. But it sometimes lengthens,\r\nsometimes thickens or variously enlarges, and takes on various forms.\r\nSome of these have received special names, very few of which are in\r\ncommon use. A lengthened portion of the receptacle is called\r\n\r\nA STIPE. This name, which means simply a trunk or stalk, is used in\r\nbotany for various stalks, even for the leaf-stalk in Ferns. It is also\r\napplied to the stalk or petiole of a carpel, in the rare cases when\r\nthere is any, as in Goldthread. Then it is technically distinguished as\r\na THECAPHORE. When there is a stalk, or lengthened internode of\r\nreceptacle, directly under a compound pistil, as in Stanleya and some\r\nother Cruciferae, it is called a GYNOPHORE. When the stalk is developed\r\nbelow the stamens, as in most species of Silene (Fig. 356), it has been\r\ncalled an ANTHOPHORE or GONOPHORE. In Fig. 357 the torus is dilated\r\nabove the calyx where it bears the petals, then there is a long\r\ninternode (gonophore) between it and the stamens; then a shorter one\r\n(gynophore) between these and the pistil.\r\n\r\n324. =A Carpophore= is a prolongation of receptacle or axis between the\r\ncarpels and bearing them. Umbelliferous plants and Geranium (Fig. 358,\r\n359) afford characteristic examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360. Longitudinal section of a young strawberry,\r\nenlarged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361. Similar section of a young Rose-hip.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 362. Enlarged and top-shaped receptacle of\r\nNelumbium, at maturity.]\r\n\r\n325. Flowers with very numerous simple pistils generally have the\r\nreceptacle enlarged so as to give them room; sometimes becoming broad\r\nand flat, as in the Flowering Raspberry, sometimes elongated, as in the\r\nBlackberry, the Magnolia, etc. It is the receptacle in the Strawberry\r\n(Fig. 360), much enlarged and pulpy when ripe, which forms the eatable\r\npart of the fruit, and bears the small seed-like pistils on its surface.\r\nIn the Rose (Fig. 361), instead of being convex or conical, the\r\nreceptacle is deeply concave, or urn-shaped. Indeed, a Rose-hip may be\r\nlikened to a strawberry turned inside out, like the finger of a glove\r\nreversed, and the whole covered by the adherent tube of the calyx. The\r\ncalyx remains beneath in the strawberry.\r\n\r\n326. In Nelumbium, of the Water-Lily family, the singular and greatly\r\nenlarged receptacle is shaped like a top, and bears the small pistils\r\nimmersed in separate cavities of its flat upper surface (Fig. 362).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 363. Hypogynous disk in Orange.]\r\n\r\n327. =A Disk= is an enlarged low receptacle or an outgrowth from it,\r\n_hypogynous_ when underneath the pistil, as in Rue and the Orange (Fig.\r\n363), and _perigynous_ when adnate to calyx-tube (as in Buckthorn, Fig.\r\n364, 365), and Cherry (Fig. 271), or to both calyx-tube and ovary, as\r\nin Hawthorn (Fig. 273). A flattened hypogynous disk, underlying the\r\novary or ovaries, and from which they fall away at maturity, is\r\nsometimes called a GYNOBASE, as in the Rue family. In some Borragineous\r\nflowers, such as Houndstongue, the gynobase runs up in the centre\r\nbetween the carpels into a carpophore. The so-called _epigynous_ disk\r\n(or STYLOPODIUM) crowning the summit of the ovary in flowers of\r\nUmbelliferae, etc., cannot be said to belong to the receptacle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 364. Flower of a Buckthorn showing a conspicuous\r\nperigynous disk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 365. Vertical section of same flower.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection XIII. FERTILIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n328. The end of the flower is attained when the ovules become seeds. A\r\nflower remains for a certain time (longer or shorter according to the\r\nspecies) in _anthesis_, that is, in the proper state for the fulfilment\r\nof this end. During anthesis, the ovules have to be fertilized by the\r\npollen; or at least some pollen has to reach the stigma, or in\r\ngymnospermy the ovule itself, and to set up the peculiar growth upon its\r\nmoist and permeable tissue, which has for result the production of an\r\nembryo in the ovules. By this the ovules are said to be _fertilized_.\r\nThe first step is _pollination_, or, so to say, the sowing of the proper\r\npollen upon the stigma, where it is to germinate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. ADAPTATIONS FOR POLLINATION OF THE STIGMA.\r\n\r\n329. These various and ever-interesting adaptations and processes are\r\nillustrated in the \"Botanical Text Book, Structural Botany,\" chap. VI.\r\nsect. iv., also in a brief and simple way in \"Botany for Young People,\r\nHow Plants Behave.\" So mere outlines only are given here.\r\n\r\n330. Sometimes the application of pollen to the stigma is left to\r\nchance, as in dioecious wind-fertilized flowers; sometimes it is\r\nrendered very sure, as in flowers that are fertilized in the bud;\r\nsometimes the pollen is prevented from reaching the stigma of the same\r\nflower, although placed very near to it, but then there are always\r\narrangements for its transference to the stigma of some other blossom of\r\nthe kind. It is among these last that the most exquisite adaptations are\r\nmet with.\r\n\r\n331. Accordingly, some flowers are particularly adapted to close or\r\nself-fertilization; others to cross fertilization; some for either,\r\naccording to circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Close Fertilization_ occurs when the pollen reaches and acts upon a\r\nstigma of the very same flower (this is also called self-fertilization),\r\nor, less closely, upon other blossoms of the same cluster or the same\r\nindividual plant.\r\n\r\n_Cross Fertilization_ occurs when ovules are fertilized by pollen of\r\nother individuals of the same species.\r\n\r\n_Hybridization_ occurs when ovules are fertilized by pollen of some\r\nother (necessarily some nearly related) species.\r\n\r\n332. =Close Fertilization= would seem to be the natural result in\r\nordinary hermaphrodite flowers; but it is by no means so in all of them.\r\nMore commonly the arrangements are such that it takes place only after\r\nsome opportunity for cross fertilization has been afforded. But close\r\nfertilization is inevitable in what are called\r\n\r\n_Cleistogamous Flowers_, that is, in those which are fertilized in the\r\nflower-bud, while still unopened. Most flowers of this kind, indeed,\r\nnever open at all; but the closed floral coverings are forced off by the\r\ngrowth of the precociously fertilized pistil. Common examples of this\r\nare found in the earlier blossoms of Specularia perfoliata, in the later\r\nones of most Violets, especially the stemless species, in our wild Jewel\r\nweeds or Impatiens, in the subterranean shoots of Amphicarpaea. Every\r\nplant which produces these cleistogamous or bud-fertilized flowers bears\r\nalso more conspicuous and open flowers, usually of bright colors. The\r\nlatter very commonly fail to set seed, but the former are prolific.\r\n\r\n333. =Cross Fertilization= is naturally provided for in dioecious\r\nplants (249), is much favored in monoecious plants (249), and hardly\r\nless so in dichogamous and in heterogonous flowers (338). Cross\r\nfertilization depends upon the transportation of pollen; and the two\r\nprincipal agents of conveyance are winds and insects. Most flowers are\r\nin their whole structure adapted either to the one or to the other.\r\n\r\n334. =Wind-fertilizable or Anemophilous= flowers are more commonly\r\ndioecious or monoecious, as in Pines and all coniferous trees, Oaks, and\r\nBirches, and Sedges; yet sometimes hermaphrodite, as in Plantains and\r\nmost Grasses; they produce a superabundance of very light pollen,\r\nadapted to be wind-borne; and they offer neither nectar to feed winged\r\ninsects, nor fragrance nor bright colors to attract them.\r\n\r\n335. =Insect-fertilizable or Entomophilous= flowers are those which are\r\nsought by insects, for pollen or for nectar, or for both. Through their\r\nvisits pollen is conveyed from one flower and from one plant to another.\r\nInsects are attracted to such blossoms by their bright colors, or their\r\nfragrance, or by the nectar (the material of honey) there provided for\r\nthem. While supplying their own needs, they carry pollen from anthers to\r\nstigmas and from plant to plant, thus bringing about a certain amount of\r\ncross fertilization. Willows and some other dioecious flowers are so\r\nfertilized, chiefly by bees. But most insect-visited flowers have the\r\nstamens and pistils associated either in the same or in contiguous\r\nblossoms. Even when in the same blossom, anthers and stigmas are very\r\ncommonly so situated that under insect-visitation, some pollen is more\r\nlikely to be deposited upon other than upon own stigmas, so giving a\r\nchance for cross as well as for close fertilization. On the other hand,\r\nnumerous flowers, of very various kinds, have their parts so arranged\r\nthat they must almost necessarily be cross-fertilized or be barren, and\r\nare therefore dependent upon the aid of insects. This aid is secured by\r\ndifferent exquisite adaptations and contrivances, which would need a\r\nvolume for full illustration. Indeed, there is a good number of volumes\r\ndevoted to this subject.[1]\r\n\r\n336. Some of the adaptations which favor or ensure cross fertilization\r\nare peculiar to the particular kind of blossom. Orchids, Milkweeds,\r\nKalmia, Iris, and papilionaceous flowers each have their own special\r\ncontrivances, quite different for each.\r\n\r\n337. Irregular flowers (253) and especially irregular corollas are\r\nusually adaptations to insect-visitation. So are all _Nectaries_,\r\nwhether hollow spurs, sacs, or other concavities in which nectar is\r\nsecreted, and all _nectariferous glands_.\r\n\r\n338. Moreover, there are two arrangements for cross fertilization common\r\nto hermaphrodite flowers in various different families of plants, which\r\nhave received special names, _Dichogamy_ and _Heterogony_.\r\n\r\n339. =Dichogamy= is the commoner case. Flowers are _dichogamous_ when\r\nthe anthers discharge their pollen either before or after the stigmas of\r\nthat flower are in a condition to receive it. Such flowers are\r\n\r\n_Proterandrous_, when the anthers are earlier than the stigmas, as in\r\nGentians, Campanula, Epilobium, etc.\r\n\r\n_Proterogynous_, when the stigmas are mature and moistened for the\r\nreception of pollen, before the anthers of that blossom are ready to\r\nsupply it, and are withered before that pollen can be supplied.\r\nPlantains or Ribworts (mostly wind-fertilized) are strikingly\r\nproterogynous: so is Amorpha, our Papaws, Scrophularia, and in a less\r\ndegree the blossom of Pears, Hawthorns, and Horse-chestnut.\r\n\r\n340. In Sabbatia, the large-flowered species of Epilobium, and\r\nstrikingly in Clerodendron, the dichogamy is supplemented and perfected\r\nby movements of the stamens and style, one or both, adjusted to make\r\nsure of cross fertilization.\r\n\r\n341. =Heterogony.= This is the case in which hermaphrodite and fertile\r\nflowers of two sorts are produced on different individuals of the same\r\nspecies; one sort having higher anthers and lower stigmas, the other\r\nhaving higher stigmas and lower anthers. Thus reciprocally disposed, a\r\nvisiting insect carries pollen from the high anthers of the one to the\r\nhigh stigma of the other, and from the low anthers of the one to the low\r\nstigma of the other. These plants are practically as if dioecious,\r\nwith the advantage that both kinds are fruitful. Houstonia and\r\nMitchella, or Partridge-berry, are excellent and familiar examples.\r\nThese are cases of\r\n\r\n_Heterogone Dimorphism_, the relative lengths being only short and long\r\nreciprocally.\r\n\r\n_Heterogone Trimorphism_, in which there is a mid-length as well as a\r\nlong and a short set of stamens and style; occurs in Lythrum Salicaria\r\nand some species of Oxalis.\r\n\r\n342. There must be some essential advantage in cross fertilization or\r\ncross breeding. Otherwise all these various, elaborate, and exquisitely\r\nadjusted adaptations would be aimless. Doubtless the advantage is the\r\nsame as that which is realized in all the higher animals by the\r\ndistinction of sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. ACTION OF POLLEN, AND FORMATION OF THE EMBRYO.\r\n\r\n343. =Pollen-growth.= A grain of pollen may be justly likened to one of\r\nthe simple bodies (_spores_) which answer for seeds in Cryptogamous\r\nplants. Like one of these, it is capable of germination. When deposited\r\nupon the moist surface of the stigma (or in some cases even when at a\r\ncertain distance) it grows from some point, its living inner coat\r\nbreaking through the inert outer coat, and protruding in the form of a\r\ndelicate tube. This as it lengthens penetrates the loose tissue of the\r\nstigma and of a loose conducting tissue in the style, feeds upon the\r\nnourishing liquid matter there provided, reaches the cavity of the\r\novary, enters the orifice of an ovule, and attaches its extremity to a\r\nsac, or the lining of a definite cavity, in the ovule, called the\r\n_Embryo-Sac_.\r\n\r\n344. =Origination of the Embryo.= A globule of living matter in the\r\nembryo-sac is formed, and is in some way placed in close proximity to\r\nthe apex of the pollen tube; it probably absorbs the contents of the\r\nlatter; it then sets up a special growth, and the _Embryo_ (8-10) or\r\nrudimentary plantlet in the seed is the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Beginning with one by C. C. Sprengel in 1793, and again in our day\r\nwith Darwin, \"On the Various Contrivances by which Orchids are\r\nfertilized by Insects,\" and in succeeding works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection XIV. THE FRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n345. =Its Nature.= The ovary matures into the Fruit. In the strictest\r\nsense the fruit is the seed-vessel, technically named the PERICARP. But\r\npractically it may include other parts organically connected with the\r\npericarp. Especially the calyx, or a part of it, is often incorporated\r\nwith the ovary, so as to be undistinguishably a portion of the pericarp,\r\nand it even forms along with the receptacle the whole bulk of such\r\nedible fruits as apples and pears. The receptacle is an obvious part in\r\nblackberries, and is the whole edible portion in the strawberry.\r\n\r\n346. Also a cluster of distinct carpels may, in ripening, be\r\nconsolidated or compacted, so as practically to be taken for one fruit.\r\nSuch are raspberries, blackberries, the Magnolia fruit, etc. Moreover,\r\nthe ripened product of many flowers may be compacted or grown together\r\nso as to form a single compound fruit.\r\n\r\n347. =Its kinds= have therefore to be distinguished. Also various names\r\nof common use in descriptive botany have to be mentioned and defined.\r\n\r\n348. In respect to composition, accordingly, fruits may be classified\r\ninto\r\n\r\n_Simple_, those which result from the ripening of a single pistil, and\r\nconsist only of the matured ovary, either by itself, as in a cherry, or\r\nwith calyx-tube completely incorporated with it, as in a gooseberry or\r\ncranberry.\r\n\r\n_Aggregate_, when a cluster of carpels of the same flower are crowded\r\ninto a mass; as in raspberries and blackberries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 366. Forming fruit (capsule) of Gaultheria, with\r\ncalyx thickening around its base. 367. Section of same mature, the\r\nberry-like calyx nearly enclosing the capsule.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368. Section of a part of a strawberry. Compare with\r\nFig. 360.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369. Similar section of part of a blackberry. 370.\r\nOne of its component simple fruits (drupe) in section, showing the pulp,\r\nstone, and contained seed; more enlarged. Compare with Fig. 375.]\r\n\r\n_Accessory_ or _Anthocarpous_, when the surroundings or supports of the\r\npistil make up a part of the mass; as does the loose calyx changed into\r\na fleshy and berry-like envelope of our Wintergreen (Gaultheria, Fig.\r\n366, 367) and Buffalo-berry, which are otherwise simple fruits. In an\r\naggregate fruit such as the strawberry the great mass is receptacle\r\n(Fig. 360, 368); and in the blackberry (Fig. 369) the juicy receptacle\r\nforms the central part of the savory mass.\r\n\r\n_Multiple_ or _Collective_, when formed from several flowers\r\nconsolidated into one mass, of which the common receptacle or axis of\r\ninflorescence, the floral envelopes, and even the bracts, etc., make a\r\npart. A mulberry (Fig. 408, which superficially much resembles a\r\nblackberry) is of this multiple sort. A pine-apple is another example.\r\n\r\n349. In respect to texture or consistence, fruits may be distinguished\r\ninto three kinds, viz.--\r\n\r\n_Fleshy Fruits_, those which are more or less soft and juicy throughout;\r\n\r\n_Stone Fruits_, or _Drupaceous_, the outer part fleshy like a berry,\r\nthe inner hard or stony, like a nut; and\r\n\r\n_Dry Fruits_, those which have no flesh or pulp.\r\n\r\n350. In reference to the way of disseminating the contained seed, fruits\r\nare said to be\r\n\r\n_Indehiscent_ when they do not open at maturity. Fleshy fruits and stone\r\nfruits are of course indehiscent. The seed becomes free only through\r\ndecay or by being fed upon by animals. Those which escape digestion are\r\nthus disseminated by the latter. Of dry fruits many are indehiscent; and\r\nthese are variously arranged to be transported by animals. Some burst\r\nirregularly; many are\r\n\r\n_Dehiscent_, that is, they split open regularly along certain lines, and\r\ndischarge the seeds. A dehiscent fruit almost always contains many or\r\nseveral seeds, or at least more than one seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371. Leafy shoot and berry (cut across) of the\r\nlarger Cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 372, 373. Pepo of Gourd, in section. 373. One carpel\r\nof same in diagram.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374. Longitudinal and transverse sections of a pear\r\n(pome).]\r\n\r\n351. The principal kinds of fruit which have received substantive names\r\nand are of common use in descriptive botany are the following. Of fleshy\r\nfruits the leading kind is\r\n\r\n352. =The Berry=, such as the gooseberry and currant, the blueberry and\r\ncranberry (Fig. 371), the tomato, and the grape. Here the whole flesh is\r\nsoft throughout. The orange is a berry with a leathery rind.\r\n\r\n353. =The Pepo=, or _Gourd-fruit_, is a hard-rinded berry, belonging to\r\nthe Gourd family, such as the pumpkin, squash, cucumber, and melon, Fig.\r\n372, 373.\r\n\r\n354. =The Pome= is a name applied to the apple, pear (Fig. 374), and\r\nquince; fleshy fruits, like a berry, but the principal thickness is\r\ncalyx, only the papery pods arranged like a star in the core really\r\nbelonging to the carpels. The fruit of the Hawthorn is a drupaceous\r\npome, something between pome and drupe.\r\n\r\n355. Of fruits which are externally fleshy and internally hard the\r\nleading kind is\r\n\r\n356. =The Drupe=, or _Stone-fruit_; of which the cherry, plum, and peach\r\n(Fig. 375) are familiar examples. In this the outer part of the\r\nthickness of the pericarp becomes fleshy, or softens like a berry, while\r\nthe inner hardens, like a nut. From the way in which the pistil is\r\nconstructed, it is evident that the fleshy part here answers to the\r\nlower, and the stone to the upper face of the component leaf. The layers\r\nor concentric portions of a drupe, or of any pericarp which is thus\r\nseparable, are named, when thus distinguishable into three portions,--\r\n\r\n_Epicarp_, the external layer, often the mere skin of the fruit,\r\n\r\n_Mesocarp_, the middle layer, which is commonly the fleshy part, and\r\n\r\n_Endocarp_, the innermost layer, the stone. But more commonly only two\r\nportions of a drupe are distinguished, and are named, the outer one\r\n\r\n_Sarcocarp_ or _Exocarp_, for the flesh, the first name referring to the\r\nfleshy character, the second to its being an external layer; and\r\n\r\n_Putamen_ or _Endocarp_, the _Stone_, within.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 375. Longitudinal section of a peach, showing flesh,\r\nstone, and seed.]\r\n\r\n357. The typical or true drupe is of a single carpel. But, not to\r\nmultiply technical names, this name is extended to all such fruits when\r\nfleshy without and stony within, although of compound pistil,--even to\r\nthose having several or separable stones, such as the fruit of Holly.\r\nThese stones in such drupes, or drupaceous fruits, are called _Pyrenae_,\r\nor _Nucules_, or simply _Nutlets_ of the drupe.\r\n\r\n358. Of Dry fruits, there is a greater diversity of kinds having\r\ndistinct names. The indehiscent sorts are commonly one-seeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 376. Akene of a Buttercup. 377. The same, divided\r\nlengthwise, to show the contained seed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378. Akene of Virgin's-bower, retaining the\r\nfeathered style, which aids in dissemination.]\r\n\r\n359. =The Akene or Achenium= is a small, dry and indehiscent one-seeded\r\nfruit, often so seed-like in appearance that it is popularly taken for a\r\nnaked seed. The fruit of the Buttercup or Crowfoot is a good example,\r\nFig. 376, 377. Its nature, as a ripened pistil (in this case a simple\r\ncarpel), is apparent by its bearing the remains of a style or stigma, or\r\na scar from which this has fallen. It may retain the style and use it in\r\nvarious ways for dissemination (Fig. 378).\r\n\r\n360. The fruit of Compositae (though not of a single carpel) is also an\r\nakene. In this case the pericarp is invested by an adherent calyx-tube;\r\nthe limb of which, when it has any, is called the PAPPUS. This name was\r\nfirst given to the down like that of the Thistle, but is applied to all\r\nforms under which the limb of the calyx of the \"compound flower\"\r\nappears. In Lettuce, Dandelion (Fig. 384), and the like, the achenium as\r\nit matures tapers upwards into a slender beak, like a stalk to the\r\npappus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379. Akene of Mayweed (no pappus). 380. That of\r\nSuccory (its pappus a shallow cup). 381. Of Sunflower (pappus of two\r\ndeciduous scales). 382. Of Sneezeweed (Helenium), with its pappus of\r\nfive scales. 383. Of Sow-Thistle, with its pappus of delicate downy\r\nhairs. 384. Of the Dandelion, its pappus raised on a long beak.]\r\n\r\n361. =A Cremocarp= (Fig. 385), a name given to the fruit of Umbelliferae,\r\nconsists as it were of a pair of akenes united completely in the\r\nblossom, but splitting apart when ripe into the two closed carpels. Each\r\nof these is a _Mericarp_ or _Hemicarp_, names seldom used.\r\n\r\n362. =A Utricle= is the same as an akene, but with a thin and bladdery\r\nloose pericarp; like that of the Goosefoot or Pigweed (Fig. 386). When\r\nripe it may burst open irregularly to discharge the seed; or it may open\r\nby a circular line all round, the upper part falling off like a lid; as\r\nin the Amaranth (Fig. 387).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 385. Fruit (cremocarp) of Osmorrhiza; the two\r\nakene-like ripe carpels separating at maturity from a slender axis or\r\ncarpophore.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386. Utricle of the common Pigweed (Chenopodium\r\nalbum).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 387. Utricle (pyxis) of Amaranth, opening all round\r\n(circumscissile).]\r\n\r\n363. =A Caryopsis, or Grain=, is like an akene with the seed adhering to\r\nthe thin pericarp throughout, so that fruit and seed are incorporated\r\ninto one body; as in wheat, Indian corn, and other kinds of grain.\r\n\r\n364. =A Nut= is a dry and indehiscent fruit, commonly one-celled and\r\none-seeded, with a hard, crustaceous, or bony wall, such as the\r\ncocoa-nut, hazelnut, chestnut, and the acorn (Fig. 37, 388.) Here the\r\ninvolucre, in the form of a cup at the base, is called the CUPULE. In\r\nthe Chestnut the cupule forms the bur; in the Hazel, a leafy husk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388. Nut (acorn) of the Oak, with its cup or\r\ncupule.]\r\n\r\n365. =A Samara, or Key-fruit=, is either a nut or an akene, or any other\r\nindehiscent fruit, furnished with a wing, like that of Ash (Fig. 389),\r\nand Elm (Fig. 390). The Maple-fruit is a pair of keys (Fig. 391).\r\n\r\n366. Dehiscent Fruits, or Pods, are of two classes, viz., those of a\r\nsimple pistil or carpel, and those of a compound pistil. Two common\r\nsorts of the first are named as follows:--\r\n\r\n367. =The Follicle= is a fruit of a simple carpel, which dehisces down\r\none side only, i. e. by the inner or ventral suture. The fruits of Marsh\r\nMarigold (Fig. 392), Paeony, Larkspur, and Milkweed are of this kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 389. Samara or key of the White Ash, winged at end.\r\n390. Samara of the American Elm, winged all round.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391. Pair of samaras of Sugar Maple.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392. Follicle of Marsh Marigold (Caltha palustris).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 393. Legume of a Sweet Pea, opened.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 394. Loment or jointed legume of a Tick-Trefoil\r\n(Desmodium).]\r\n\r\n368. =The Legume= or true Pod, such as the peapod (Fig. 393), and the\r\nfruit of the Leguminous or Pulse family generally, is one which opens\r\nalong the dorsal as well as the ventral suture. The two pieces into\r\nwhich it splits are called VALVES. A LOMENT is a legume which is\r\nconstricted between the seeds, and at length breaks up crosswise into\r\ndistinct joints, as in Fig. 394.\r\n\r\n369. The pods or dehiscent fruits belonging to a compound ovary have\r\nseveral technical names: but they all may be regarded as kinds of\r\n\r\n370. =The Capsule=, the dry and dehiscent fruit of any compound pistil.\r\nThe capsule may discharge its seeds through chinks or pores, as in the\r\nPoppy, or burst irregularly in some part, as in Lobelia and the\r\nSnapdragon; but commonly it splits open (or is _dehiscent_) lengthwise\r\ninto regular pieces, called VALVES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 395. Capsule of Iris, with loculicidal dehiscence;\r\nbelow, cut across.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396. Pod of a Marsh St. John's-wort, with septicidal\r\ndehiscence.]\r\n\r\n371. Regular _Dehiscence_ in a capsule takes place in two ways, which\r\nare best illustrated in pods of two or three cells. It is either\r\n\r\n_Loculicidal_, or, splitting directly into the _loculi_ or cells, that\r\nis, down the back (or the dorsal suture) of each cell or carpel, as in\r\nIris (Fig. 395); or\r\n\r\n_Septicidal_, that is, splitting through the partitions or _septa_, as\r\nin St. John's-wort (Fig. 396), Rhododendron, etc. This divides the\r\ncapsule into its component carpels, which then open by their ventral\r\nsuture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 397, 398. Diagrams of the two modes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 399. Diagram of septifragal dehiscence of the\r\nloculicidal type. 400. Same of the septicidal or _marginicidal_ type.]\r\n\r\n372. In loculicidal dehiscence the valves naturally bear the partitions\r\non their middle; in the septicidal, half the thickness of a partition is\r\nborne on the margin of each valve. See the annexed diagrams. A variation\r\nof either mode occurs when the valves break away from the partitions,\r\nthese remaining attached in the axis of the fruit. This is called\r\n_Septifragal_ dehiscence. One form is seen in the Morning-Glory (Fig.\r\n400).\r\n\r\n373. The capsules of Rue, Spurge, and some others, are both loculicidal\r\nand septicidal, and so split into half-carpellary valves or pieces.\r\n\r\n374. =The Silique= (Fig. 401) is the technical name of the peculiar pod\r\nof the Mustard family; which is two-celled by a false partition\r\nstretched across between two parietal placentae. It generally opens by\r\ntwo valves from below upward, and the placentae with the partition are\r\nleft behind when the valves fall off.\r\n\r\n375. =A Silicle or Pouch= is only a short and broad silique, like that\r\nof the Shepherd's Purse, Fig. 402, 403.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 401. Silique of a Cadamine or Spring Cress.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 402. Silicle of Shepherd's Purse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 403. Same, with one valve removed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 404. Pyxis of Purslane, the lid detaching.]\r\n\r\n376. =The Pyxis= is a pod which opens by a circular horizontal line, the\r\nupper part forming a lid, as in Purslane (Fig. 404), the Plantain,\r\nHenbane, etc. In these the dehiscence extends all round, or is\r\n_circumscissile_. So it does in Amaranth (Fig. 387), forming a\r\none-seeded utricular pyxis. In Jeffersonia, the line does not separate\r\nquite round, but leaves a portion for a hinge to the lid.\r\n\r\n377. Of Multiple or Collective Fruits, which are properly masses of\r\nfruits aggregated into one body (as is seen in the Mulberry (Fig. 408),\r\nPine-apple, etc.), there are two kinds with special names and of\r\npeculiar structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 405. A fig-fruit when young. 406. Same in section.\r\n407. Magnified portion, a slice, showing some of the flowers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 408. A mulberry. 409. One of the grains younger,\r\nenlarged; seen to be a pistillate flower with calyx becoming fleshy.\r\n410. Same, with fleshy calyx cut across.]\r\n\r\n378. =The Syconium or Fig-fruit= (Fig. 405, 406) is a fleshy axis or\r\nsummit of stem, hollowed out, and lined within by a multitude of minute\r\nflowers, the whole becoming pulpy, and in the common fig, luscious.\r\n\r\n379. =The Strobile or Cone= (Fig. 411), is the peculiar multiple fruit\r\nof Pines, Cypresses, and the like; hence named _Coniferae_, viz.\r\ncone-bearing plants. As already shown (313), these cones are _open\r\npistils_, mostly in the form of flat scales, regularly overlying each\r\nother, and pressed together in a spike or head. Each scale bears one or\r\ntwo naked seeds on its inner face. When ripe and dry, the scales turn\r\nback or diverge, and in the Pine the seed peels off and falls, generally\r\ncarrying with it a wing, a part of the lining of the scale, which\r\nfacilitates the dispersion of the seeds by the wind (Fig. 412, 413). In\r\nArbor-Vitae, the scales of the small cone are few, and not very unlike\r\nthe leaves. In Cypress they are very thick at the top and narrow at the\r\nbase, so as to make a peculiar sort of closed cone. In Juniper and Red\r\nCedar, the few scales of the very small cone become fleshy, and ripen\r\ninto a fruit which closely resembles a berry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 411. Cone of a common Pitch Pine. 412. Inside view\r\nof a separated scale or open carpel; one seed in place: 413, the other\r\nseed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection XV. THE SEED.\r\n\r\n\r\n380. Seeds are the final product of the flower, to which all its parts\r\nand offices are subservient. Like the ovule from which it originates, a\r\nseed consists of coats and kernel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 414. Seed of a Linden or Basswood cut through\r\nlengthwise, and magnified, the parts lettered: _a_, the hilum or scar;\r\n_b_, the outer coat; _c_, the inner; _d_, the albumen; _e_, the embryo.]\r\n\r\n381. =The Seed-coats= are commonly two (320), the outer and the inner.\r\nFig. 414 shows the two, in a seed cut through lengthwise. The outer coat\r\nis often hard or crustaceous, whence it is called the _Testa_, or shell\r\nof the seed; the inner is almost always thin and delicate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 415. A winged seed of the Trumpet-Creeper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 416. One of Catalpa, the kernel cut to show the\r\nembryo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 417. Seed of Milkweed, with a _Coma_ or tuft of long\r\nsilky hairs at one end.]\r\n\r\n382. The shape and the markings, so various in different seeds, depend\r\nmostly on the outer coat. Sometimes this fits the kernel closely;\r\nsometimes it is expanded into a _wing_, as in the Trumpet-Creeper (Fig.\r\n415), and occasionally this wing is cut up into shreds or tufts, as in\r\nthe Catalpa (Fig. 416); or instead of a wing it may bear a _Coma_, or\r\ntuft of long and soft hairs, as in the Milkweed or Silkweed (Fig. 417).\r\nThe use of wings, or downy tufts is to render the seeds buoyant for\r\ndispersion by the winds. This is clear, not only from their evident\r\nadaptation to this purpose, but also from the fact that winged and\r\ntufted seeds are found only in fruits that split open at maturity, never\r\nin those that remain closed. The coat of some seeds is beset with long\r\nhairs or wool. _Cotton_, one of the most important vegetable products,\r\nsince it forms the principal clothing of the larger part of the human\r\nrace, consists of the long and woolly hairs which thickly cover the\r\nwhole surface of the seed. There are also crests or other appendages of\r\nvarious sorts on certain seeds. A few seeds have an additional, but more\r\nor less incomplete covering, outside of the real seed-coats called an\r\n\r\n383. =Aril, or Arillus.= The loose and transparent bag which encloses\r\nthe seed of the White Water-Lily (Fig. 418) is of this kind. So is the\r\n_mace_ of the nutmeg; and also the scarlet pulp around the seeds of the\r\nWaxwork (Celastrus) and Strawberry-bush (Euonymus). The aril is a growth\r\nfrom the extremity of the seed-stalk, or from the placenta when there is\r\nno seed-stalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 418. Seed of White Water Lily, enclosed in its\r\naril.]\r\n\r\n384. A short and thickish appendage at or close to the hilum in certain\r\nseeds is called a CARUNCLE or STROPHIOLE (Fig. 419).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 419. Seed of Ricinus or Castor oil plant, with\r\ncaruncle.]\r\n\r\n385. The various terms which define the position or direction of the\r\novule (erect, ascending, etc.) apply equally to the seed: so also the\r\nterms anatropous, orthotropous, campylotropous, etc., as already defined\r\n(320, 321), and such terms as\r\n\r\nHILUM, or _Scar_ left where the seed-stalk or funiculus falls away, or\r\nwhere the seed was attached directly to the placenta when there is no\r\nseed-stalk.\r\n\r\nRHAPHE, the line or ridge which runs from the hilum to the chalaza in\r\nanatropous and amphitropous seeds.\r\n\r\nCHALAZA, the place where the seed-coats and the kernel or nucleus are\r\norganically connected,--at the hilum in orthotropous and campylotropous\r\nseeds, at the extremity of the rhaphe or tip of the seed in other kinds.\r\n\r\nMICROPYLE, answering to the _Foramen_ or orifice of the ovule. Compare\r\nthe accompanying figures and those of the ovules, Fig. 341-355.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 420. Seed of a Violet (anatropous): _a_, hilum;\r\n_b_, rhaphe; _c_, chalaza.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 421. Seed of a Larkspur (also anatropous); the parts\r\nlettered as in the last.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 422. The same, cut through lengthwise: _a_, the\r\nhilum; _c_, chalaza; _d_, outer seed coat; _e_, inner seed-coat; _f_,\r\nthe albumen; _g_, the minute embryo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 423. Seed of a St. John's-wort, divided lengthwise;\r\nhere the whole kernel is embryo.]\r\n\r\n386. =The Kernel, or Nucleus=, is the whole body of the seed within the\r\ncoats. In many seeds the kernel is all _Embryo_; in others a large part\r\nof it is the _Albumen_. For example, in Fig. 423, it is wholly embryo;\r\nin Fig. 422, all but the small speck (_g_) is albumen.\r\n\r\n387. =The Albumen or Endosperm= of the seed is sufficiently\r\ncharacterized and its office explained in Sect. III., 31-35.\r\n\r\n388. =The Embryo= or _Germ_, which is the rudimentary plantlet and the\r\nfinal result of blossoming, and its development in germination have been\r\nextensively illustrated in Sections II. and III. Its essential parts are\r\nthe _Radicle_ and the _Cotyledons_.\r\n\r\n389. =Its Radicle or Caulicle= (the former is the term long and\r\ngenerally used in botanical descriptions, but the latter is the more\r\ncorrect one, for it is the initial stem, which merely gives origin to\r\nthe root), as to its position in the seed, always points to and lies\r\nnear the micropyle. In relation to the pericarp it is\r\n\r\n_Superior_, when it points to the apex of the fruit or cell, and\r\n\r\n_Inferior_, when it points to its base, or downward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 424. Embryo of Calycanthus; upper part cut away, to\r\nshow the convolute cotyledons.]\r\n\r\n390. =The Cotyledons= have already been illustrated as respects their\r\nnumber,--giving the important distinction of _Dicotyledonous_,\r\n_Polycotyledonous_ and _Monocotyledonous_ embryos (36-43),--also as\r\nregards their thickness, whether _foliaceous_ or _fleshy_; and some of\r\nthe very various shapes and adaptations to the seed have been figured.\r\nThey may be straight, or folded, or rolled up. In the latter case the\r\ncotyledons may be rolled up as it were from one margin, as in\r\nCalycanthus (Fig. 424), or from apex to base in a flat spiral, or they\r\nmay be both folded (_plicate_) and rolled up (_convolute_), as in Sugar\r\nMaple (Fig. 11.) In one very natural family, the Cruciferae, two\r\ndifferent modes prevail in the way the two cotyledons are brought round\r\nagainst the radicle. In one series they are\r\n\r\n_Accumbent_, that is, the edges of the flat cotyledons lie against the\r\nradicle, as in Fig. 425, 426. In another they are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 425. Seed of Bitter Cress, Barbarea, cut across to\r\nshow the accumbent cotyledons. 426. Embryo of same, whole.]\r\n\r\n_Incumbent_, or with the plane of the cotyledons brought up in the\r\nopposite direction, so that the back of one of them lies against the\r\nradicle, as shown in Fig. 427, 428.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 427. Seed of a Sisymbrium, cut across to show the\r\nincumbent cotyledons. 428. Embryo of the same, detached whole.]\r\n\r\n391. As to the situation of the embryo with respect to the albumen of\r\nthe seed, when this is present in any quantity, the embryo may be\r\n_Axile_, that is occupying the axis or centre, either for most of its\r\nlength, as in Violet (Fig. 429), Barberry (Fig. 48), and Pine (Fig. 56);\r\nand in these it is straight. But it may be variously curved or coiled in\r\nthe albumen, as in Helianthemum (Fig. 430), in a Potato-seed (Fig. 50),\r\nor Onion-seed (Fig. 60), and Linden (Fig. 414); or it may be coiled\r\naround the outside of the albumen, partly or into a circle, as in\r\nChickweed (Fig. 431, 432) and in Mirabilis (Fig. 52). The latter mode\r\nprevails in Campylotropous seeds. In the cereal grains, such as Indian\r\nCorn (Fig. 67) and Rice (Fig. 430a), and in all other Grasses, the\r\nembryo is straight and applied to the outside of the abundant albumen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 429. Section of seed of Violet; anatropous with\r\nstraight axile embryo in the albumen. 430.

Seed of a Chickweed, campylotropous. 432.\r\nSection of same, showing slender embryo coiled around the outside of the\r\nalbumen of the kernel.]\r\n\r\n392. The matured seed, with embryo ready to germinate and reproduce the\r\nkind, completes the cycle of the vegetable life in a phanerogamous\r\nplant, the account of which began with the seed and seedling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection XVI. VEGETABLE LIFE AND WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n393. The following simple outlines of the anatomy and physiology of\r\nplants (3) are added to the preceding structural part for the better\r\npreparation of students in descriptive and systematic botany; also to\r\ngive to all learners some general idea of the life, growth, intimate\r\nstructure, and action of the beings which compose so large a part of\r\norganic nature. Those who would extend and verify the facts and\r\nprinciples here outlined will use the Physiological Botany of the\r\n\"Botanical Text Book,\" by Professor Goodale, or some similar book.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE AND GROWTH.\r\n\r\n394. =Growth= _is the increase of a living thing in size and substance_.\r\nIt appears so natural that plants and animals should grow, that one\r\nrarely thinks of it as requiring explanation. It seems enough to say\r\nthat a thing is so because it grew so. Growth from the seed, the\r\ngermination and development of an embryo into a plantlet, and at length\r\ninto a mature plant (as illustrated in Sections II. and III.), can be\r\nfollowed by ordinary observation. But the embryo is already a miniature\r\nplantlet, sometimes with hardly any visible distinction of parts, but\r\noften one which has already made very considerable growth in the seed.\r\nTo investigate the formation and growth of the embryo itself requires\r\nwell-trained eyes and hands, and the expert use of a good compound\r\nmicroscope. So this is beyond the reach of a beginner.\r\n\r\n395. Moreover, although observation may show that a seedling, weighing\r\nonly two or three grains, may double its bulk and weight every week of\r\nits early growth, and may in time produce a huge amount of vegetable\r\nmatter, it is still to be asked what this vegetable matter is, where it\r\ncame from, and by what means plants are able to increase and accumulate\r\nit, and build it up into the fabric of herbs and shrubs and lofty trees.\r\n\r\n396. =Protoplasm.= All this fabric was built up under life, but only a\r\nsmall portion of it is at any one time alive. As growth proceeds, life\r\nis passed on from the old to the new parts, much as it has passed on\r\nfrom parent to offspring, from generation to generation in unbroken\r\ncontinuity. _Protoplasm_ is the common name of that plant-stuff in which\r\nlife essentially resides. All growth depends upon it; for it has the\r\npeculiar power of growing and multiplying and building up a living\r\nstructure,--the animal no less than the vegetable structure, for it is\r\nessentially the same in both. Indeed, all the animal protoplasm comes\r\nprimarily from the vegetable, which has the prerogative of producing it;\r\nand the protoplasm of plants furnishes all that portion of the food of\r\nanimals which forms their flesh and living fabric.\r\n\r\n397. The very simplest plants (if such may specifically be called plants\r\nrather than animals, or one may say, the simplest living things) are\r\nmere particles, or pellets, or threads, or even indefinite masses of\r\nprotoplasm of vague form, which possess powers of motion or of changing\r\ntheir shape, of imbibing water, air, and even other matters, and of\r\nassimilating these into plant-stuff for their own growth and\r\nmultiplication. Their growth is increase in substance by incorporation\r\nof that which they take in and assimilate. Their multiplication is by\r\nspontaneous division of their substance or body into two or more, each\r\ncapable of continuing the process.\r\n\r\n398. The embryo of a phanerogamous plant at its beginning (344) is\r\nessentially such a globule of protoplasm, which soon constricts itself\r\ninto two and more such globules, which hold together inseparably in a\r\nrow; then the last of the row divides without separation in the two\r\nother planes, to form a compound mass, each grain or globule of which\r\ngoes on to double itself as it grows; and the definite shaping of this\r\nstill increasing mass builds up the embryo into its form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 433-436. Figures to illustrate the earlier stages in\r\nthe formation of an embryo; a single mass of protoplasm (Fig. 433)\r\ndividing into two, three, and then into more incipient cells, which by\r\ncontinued multiplication build up an embryo.]\r\n\r\n399. =Cell-walls.= While this growth was going on, each grain of the\r\nforming structure formed and clothed itself with a coat, thin and\r\ntransparent, of something different from protoplasm,--something which\r\nhardly and only transiently, if at all, partakes of the life and action.\r\nThe protoplasm forms the living organism; the coat is a kind of\r\nprotective covering or shell. The protoplasm, like the flesh of animals\r\nwhich it gives rise to, is composed of four chemical elements: Carbon,\r\nHydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. The coating is of the nature of wood\r\n(is, indeed, that which makes wood), and has only the three elements,\r\nCarbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen, in its composition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 437. Magnified view of some of a simple fresh water\r\nAlga, the Tetraspora lubrica, each sphere of which may answer to an\r\nindividual plant.]\r\n\r\n400. Although the forming structure of an embryo in the fertilized ovule\r\nis very minute and difficult to see, there are many simple plants of\r\nlowest grade, abounding in pools of water, which more readily show the\r\nearlier stages or simplest states of plant-growth. One of these, which\r\nis common in early spring, requires only moderate magnifying power to\r\nbring to view what is shown in Fig. 437. In a slimy mass which holds all\r\nloosely together, little spheres of green vegetable matter are seen,\r\nassembled in fours, and these fours themselves in clusters of fours. A\r\ntransient inspection shows, what prolonged watching would confirm, that\r\neach sphere divides first in one plane, then in the other, to make four,\r\nsoon acquiring the size of the original, and so on, producing successive\r\ngroups of fours. These pellets each form on their surface a transparent\r\nwall, like that just described. The delicate wall is for some time\r\ncapable of expansive growth, but is from the first much firmer than the\r\nprotoplasm within; through it the latter imbibes surrounding moisture,\r\nwhich becomes a watery sap, occupying vacuities in the protoplasmic mass\r\nwhich enlarge or run together as the periphery increases and distends.\r\nWhen full grown the protoplasm may become a mere lining to the wall, or\r\nsome of it central, as a nucleus, this usually connected with the\r\nwall-lining by delicate threads of the same substance. So, when full\r\ngrown, the wall with its lining--a vesicle, containing liquid or some\r\nsolid matters and in age mostly air--naturally came to be named a Cell.\r\nBut the name was suggested by, and first used only for, cells in\r\ncombination or built up into a fabric, much as a wall is built of\r\nbricks, that is, into a\r\n\r\n401. =Cellular Structure or Tissue.= Suppose numerous cells like those\r\nof Fig. 437 to be heaped up like a pile of cannon-balls, and as they\r\ngrew, to be compacted together while soft and yielding; they would\r\nflatten where they touched, and each sphere, being touched by twelve\r\nsurrounding ones would become twelve-sided. Fig. 438 would represent one\r\nof them. Suppose the contiguous faces to be united into one wall or\r\npartition between adjacent cavities, and a _cellular structure_ would be\r\nformed, like that shown in Fig. 439. Roots, stems, leaves, and the whole\r\nof phanerogamous plants are a fabric of countless numbers of such cells.\r\nNo such exact regularity in size and shape is ever actually found; but a\r\nnearly truthful magnified view of a small portion of a slice of the\r\nflower-stalk of a Calla Lily (Fig. 440) shows a fairly corresponding\r\nstructure; except that, owing to the great air-spaces of the interior,\r\nthe fabric may be likened rather to a stack of chimneys than to a solid\r\nfabric. In young and partly transparent parts one may discern the\r\ncellular structure by looking down directly on the surface, as of a\r\nforming root. (Fig. 82, 441, 442).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 438. Diagram of a vegetable cell, such as it would\r\nbe if when spherical it were equally pressed by similar surrounding\r\ncells in a heap.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 439. Ideal construction of cellular tissue so\r\nformed, in section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 440. Magnified view of a portion of a transverse\r\nslice of stem of Calla Lily. The great spaces are tubular air-channels\r\nbuilt up by the cells.]\r\n\r\n402. The substance of which cell-walls are mainly composed is called\r\nCELLULOSE. It is essentially the same in the stem of a delicate leaf or\r\npetal and in the wood of an Oak, except that in the latter the walls are\r\nmuch thickened and the calibre small. The protoplasm of each living\r\ncell appears to be completely shut up and isolated in its shell of\r\ncellulose; but microscopic investigation has brought to view, in many\r\ncases, minute threads of protoplasm which here and there traverse the\r\ncell-wall through minute pores, thus connecting the living portion of\r\none cell with that of adjacent cells. (See Fig. 447, &c.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 441. Much magnified small portion of young root of a\r\nseedling Maple (such as of Fig. 82); and 442, a few cells of same more\r\nmagnified. The prolongations from the back of some of the cells are root\r\nhairs.]\r\n\r\n403. The hairs of plants are cells formed on the surface; either\r\nelongated single cells (like the root-hairs of Fig. 441, 442), or a row\r\nof shorter cells. Cotton fibres are long and simple cells growing from\r\nthe surface of the seed.\r\n\r\n404. The size of the cells of which common plants are made up varies\r\nfrom about the thirtieth to the thousandth of an inch in diameter. An\r\nordinary size of short or roundish cells is from 1/300 to 1/500 of an\r\ninch; so that there may generally be from 27 to 125 millions of cells in\r\nthe compass of a cubic inch!\r\n\r\n405. Some parts are built up as a compact structure; in others cells are\r\narranged so as to build up regular air-channels, as in the stems of\r\naquatic and other water-loving plants (Fig. 440), or to leave irregular\r\nspaces, as in the lower part of most leaves, where the cells only here\r\nand there come into close contact (Fig. 443).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 443. Magnified section through the thickness of a\r\nleaf of Florida Star-Anise.]\r\n\r\n406. All such soft cellular tissue, like this of leaves, that of pith,\r\nand of the green bark, is called PARENCHYMA, while fibrous and woody\r\nparts are composed of PROSENCHYMA, that is, of peculiarly transformed\r\n\r\n407. =Strengthening Cells.= Common cellular tissue, which makes up the\r\nwhole structure of all very young plants, and the whole of Mosses and\r\nother vegetables of the lowest grade, even when full grown, is too\r\ntender or too brittle to give needful strength and toughness for plants\r\nwhich are to rise to any considerable height and support themselves. In\r\nthese needful strength is imparted, and the conveyance of sap through\r\nthe plant is facilitated, by the change, as they are formed, of some\r\ncells into thicker-walled and tougher tubes, and by the running together\r\nof some of these, or the prolongation of others, into hollow fibres or\r\ntubes of various size. Two sorts of such transformed cells go together,\r\nand essentially form the\r\n\r\n408. =Wood.= This is found in all common herbs, as well as in shrubs and\r\ntrees, but the former have much less of it in proportion to the softer\r\ncellular tissue. It is formed very early in the growth of the root,\r\nstem, and leaves,--traces of it appearing in large embryos even while\r\nyet in the seed. Those cells that lengthen, and at the same time thicken\r\ntheir walls form the proper WOODY FIBRE or WOOD-CELLS; those of larger\r\nsize and thinner walls, which are thickened only in certain parts so as\r\nto have peculiar markings, and which often are seen to be made up of a\r\nrow of cylindrical cells, with the partitions between absorbed or broken\r\naway, are called DUCTS, or sometimes VESSELS. There are all gradations\r\nbetween wood-cells and ducts, and between both these and common cells.\r\nBut in most plants the three kinds are fairly distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 444. Magnified wood-cells of the bark (bast-cells)\r\nof Basswood, one and part of another. 445. Some wood cells from the wood\r\n(and below part of a duct); and 446, a detached wood-cell of the same;\r\nequally magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 447. Some wood cells from Buttonwood, Platanus,\r\nhighly magnified, a whole cell and lower end of another on the left; a\r\ncell cut half away lengthwise, and half of another on the right; some\r\npores or pits (_a_) seen on the left; while _b b_ mark sections through\r\nthese on the cut surface. When living and young the protoplasm extends\r\ninto these and by minuter perforations connects across them. In age the\r\npits become open passages, facilitating the passage of sap and air.]\r\n\r\n409. The proper cellular tissue, or _parenchyma_, is the ground-work of\r\nroot, stem, and leaves; this is traversed, chiefly lengthwise, by the\r\nstrengthening and conducting tissue, wood-cells and duct-cells, in the\r\nform of bundles or threads, which, in the stems and stalks of herbs are\r\nfewer and comparatively scattered, but in shrubs and trees so numerous\r\nand crowded that in the stems and all permanent parts they make a solid\r\nmass of wood. They extend into and ramify in the leaves, spreading out\r\nin a horizontal plane, as the framework of ribs and veins, which\r\nsupports the softer cellular portion or parenchyma.\r\n\r\n410. =Wood-Cells, or Woody Fibres=, consist of tubes, commonly between\r\none and two thousandths, but in Pine-wood sometimes two or three\r\nhundredths, of an inch in diameter. Those from the tough bark of the\r\nBasswood, shown in Fig. 444, are only the fifteen-hundredth of an inch\r\nwide. Those of Buttonwood (Fig. 447) are larger, and are here highly\r\nmagnified besides. The figures show the way wood-cells are commonly put\r\ntogether, namely, with their tapering ends overlapping each\r\nother,--spliced together, as it were,--thus giving more strength and\r\ntoughness. In hard woods, such as Hickory and Oak, the walls of these\r\ntubes are very thick, as well as dense; while in soft woods, such as\r\nWhite Pine and Basswood, they are thinner.\r\n\r\n411. Wood-cells in the bark are generally longer, finer, and tougher\r\nthan those of the proper wood, and appear more like fibres. For example,\r\nFig. 446 represents a cell of the wood of Basswood of average length,\r\nand Fig. 444 one (and part of another) of the fibrous bark, both drawn\r\nto the same scale. As these long cells form the principal part of\r\nfibrous bark, or _bast_, they are named _Bast-cells_ or _Bast-fibres_.\r\nThese give the great toughness and flexibility to the inner bark of\r\nBasswood (i. e. Bast-wood) and of Leatherwood; and they furnish the\r\ninvaluable fibres of flax and hemp; the proper wood of their stems being\r\ntender, brittle, and destroyed by the processes which separate for use\r\nthe tough and slender bast-cells. In Leatherwood (Dirca) the bast-cells\r\nare remarkably slender. A view of one, if magnified on the scale of Fig.\r\n444, would be a foot and a half long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 448. Magnified bit of a pine shaving, taken parallel\r\nwith the silver grain. 449. Separate whole wood-cell, more magnified.\r\n450. Same, still more magnified; both sections represented: _a_, disks\r\nin section, _b_, in face.]\r\n\r\n412. The wood-cells of Pines, and more or less of all other Coniferous\r\ntrees, have on two of their sides very peculiar disk-shaped markings\r\n(Fig. 448-450) by which that kind of wood is recognizable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 451, 452. A large and a smaller dotted duct from\r\nGrape-Vine.]\r\n\r\n413. =Ducts=, also called VESSELS, are mostly larger than wood-cells:\r\nindeed, some of them, as in Red Oak, have calibre large enough to be\r\ndiscerned on a cross section by the naked eye. They make the visible\r\nporosity of such kinds of wood. This is particularly the case with\r\n\r\n_Dotted_ ducts (Fig. 451, 452), the surface of which appears as if\r\nriddled with round or oval pores. Such ducts are commonly made up of a\r\nrow of large cells more or less confluent into a tube.\r\n\r\n_Scalariform_ ducts (Fig. 458, 459), common in Ferns, and generally\r\nangled by mutual pressure in the bundles, have transversely elongated\r\nthin places, parallel with each other, giving a ladder-like appearance,\r\nwhence the name.\r\n\r\n_Annular_ ducts (Fig. 457) are marked with cross lines or rings, which\r\nare thickened portions of the cell-wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 453, 454. Spiral ducts which uncoil into a single\r\nthread. 455. Spiral duct which tears up as a band. 456. An annular duct,\r\nwith variations above. 457. Loose spiral duct passing into annular. 458.\r\nScalariform ducts of a Fern; part of a bundle, prismatic by pressure.\r\n459. One torn into a band.]\r\n\r\n_Spiral_ ducts or vessels (Fig. 453-455) have thin walls, strengthened\r\nby a spiral fibre adherent within. This is as delicate and as strong as\r\nspider-web: when uncoiled by pulling apart, it tears up and annihilates\r\nthe cell-wall. The uncoiled threads are seen by gently pulling apart\r\nmany leaves, such as those of Amaryllis, or the stalk of a Strawberry\r\nleaflet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 460. Milk Vessels of Dandelion, with cells of the\r\ncommon cellular tissue. 461. Others from the same older and gorged with\r\nmilky juice. All highly magnified.]\r\n\r\n_Laticiferous ducts_, _Vessels of the Latex_, or _Milk-vessels_ are\r\npeculiar branching tubes which hold _latex_ or milky juice in certain\r\nplants. It is very difficult to see them, and more so to make out their\r\nnature. They are peculiar in branching and inosculating, so as to make a\r\nnet-work of tubes, running in among the cellular tissue; and they are\r\nvery small, except when gorged and old (Fig. 460, 461).\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. CELL-CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n414. The living contents of young and active cells are mainly protoplasm\r\nwith water or watery sap which this has imbibed. Old and effete cells\r\nare often empty of solid matter, containing only water with whatever may\r\nbe dissolved in it, or air, according to the time and circumstances. All\r\nthe various products which plants in general elaborate, or which\r\nparticular plants specially elaborate, out of the common food which they\r\nderive from the soil and the air, are contained in the cells, and in the\r\ncells they are produced.\r\n\r\n415. =Sap= is a general name for the principal liquid contents,--_Crude\r\nsap_, for that which the plant takes in, _Elaborated sap_ for what it\r\nhas digested or assimilated. They must be undistinguishably mixed in the\r\ncells.\r\n\r\n416. Among the solid matters into which cells convert some of their\r\nelaborated sap two are general and most important. These are\r\n_Chlorophyll_ and _Starch_.\r\n\r\n417. =Chlorophyll= (meaning _leaf-green_) is what gives the green color\r\nto herbage. It consists of soft grains of rather complex nature, partly\r\nwax-like, partly protoplasmic. These abound in the cells of all common\r\nleaves and the green rind of plants, wherever exposed to the light. The\r\ngreen color is seen through the transparent skin of the leaf and the\r\nwalls of the containing cells. Chlorophyll is essential to ordinary\r\nassimilation in plants: by its means, under the influence of sunlight,\r\nthe plant converts crude sap into vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n418. Far the largest part of all vegetable matter produced is that which\r\ngoes to build up the plant's fabric or cellular structure, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly. There is no one good name for this most\r\nimportant product of vegetation. In its final state of cell-walls, the\r\npermanent fabric of herb and shrub and tree, it is called _Cellulose_\r\n(408): in its most soluble form it is _Sugar_ of one or another kind; in\r\na less soluble form it is _Dextrine_, a kind of liquefied starch: in the\r\nform of solid grains stored up in the cells it is _Starch_. By a series\r\nof slight chemical changes (mainly a variation in the water entering\r\ninto the composition), one of these forms is converted into another.\r\n\r\n419. =Starch= (_Farina_ or _Fecula_) is the form in which this common\r\nplant material is, as it were, laid by for future use. It consists of\r\nsolid grains, somewhat different in form in different plants, in size\r\nvarying from 1/300 to 1/4000 of an inch, partly translucent when wet,\r\nand of a pearly lustre. From the concentric lines, which commonly appear\r\nunder the microscope, the grains seem to be made up of layer over layer.\r\nWhen loose they are commonly oval, as in potato-starch (Fig. 462): when\r\nmuch compacted the grains may become angular (Fig. 463).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 462. Some magnified starch-grains, in two cells of a\r\npotato. 463. Some cells of the albumen or floury part of Indian Corn,\r\nfilled with starch-grains.]\r\n\r\n420. The starch in a potato was produced in the foliage. In the soluble\r\nform of dextrine, or that of sugar, it was conveyed through the cells of\r\nthe herbage and stalks to a subterranean shoot, and there stored up in\r\nthe tuber. When the potato sprouts, the starch in the vicinity of\r\ndeveloping buds or eyes is changed back again, first into mucilaginous\r\ndextrine, then into sugar, dissolved in the sap, and in this form it is\r\nmade to flow to the growing parts, where it is laid down into cellulose\r\nor cell-wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 464. Four cells from dried Onion-peel, each holding\r\na crystal of different shape, one of them twinned. 465. Some cells from\r\nstalk of Rhubarb-plant, three containing chlorophyll; two (one torn\r\nacross) with rhaphides. 466. Rhaphides in a cell, from Arisaema, with\r\nsmall cells surrounding. 467.

A detached cell, with\r\nrhaphides being forced out, as happens when put in water.]\r\n\r\n421. Besides these cell-contents which are in obvious and essential\r\nrelation to nutrition, there are others the use of which is\r\nproblematical. Of such the commonest are\r\n\r\n422. =Crystals.= These when slender or needle-shaped are called\r\nRHAPHIDES. They are of inorganic matter, usually of oxalate or phosphate\r\nor sulphate of lime. Some, at least of the latter, may be direct\r\ncrystallizations of what is taken in dissolved in the water absorbed,\r\nbut others must be the result of some elaboration in the plant. Some\r\nplants have hardly any; others abound in them, especially in the foliage\r\nand bark. In Locust-bark almost every cell holds a crystal; so that in a\r\nsquare inch not thicker than writing-paper there may be over a million\r\nand a half of them. When needle-shaped (rhaphides), as in stalks of\r\nCalla-Lily, Rhubarb, or Four-o'clock, they are usually packed in\r\nsheaf-like bundles. (Fig. 465, 466.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3. ANATOMY OF ROOTS AND STEMS.\r\n\r\n423. This is so nearly the same that an account of the internal\r\nstructure of stems may serve for the root also.\r\n\r\n424. At the beginning, either in the embryo or in an incipient shoot\r\nfrom a bud, the whole stem is of tender cellular tissue or parenchyma.\r\nBut wood (consisting of wood-cells and ducts or vessels) begins to be\r\nformed in the earliest growth; and is from the first arranged in two\r\nways, making two general kinds of wood. The difference is obvious even\r\nin herbs, but is more conspicuous in the enduring stems of shrubs and\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n425. On one or the other of these two types the stems of all\r\nphanerogamous plants are constructed. In one, the wood is made up of\r\nseparate threads, scattered here and there throughout the whole diameter\r\nof the stem. In the other, the wood is all collected to form a layer (in\r\na slice across the stem appearing as a ring) between a central cellular\r\npart which has none in it, the _Pith_, and an outer cellular part, the\r\n_Bark_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 471. Diagram of structure of Palm or Yucca. 472.\r\nStructure of a Corn stalk, in transverse and longitudinal section. 473.\r\nSame of a small Palm stem. The dots on the cross sections represent cut\r\nends of the woody bundles or threads.]\r\n\r\n426. An Asparagus-shoot and a Corn-stalk for herbs, and a rattan for a\r\nwoody kind, represent the first kind. To it belong all plants with\r\nmonocotyledonous embryo (40). A Bean-stalk and the stem of any common\r\nshrub or tree represent the second; and to it belong all plants with\r\ndicotyledonous or polycotyledonous embryo. The first has been called,\r\nnot very properly, _Endogenous_, which means inside-growing; the second,\r\nproperly enough, _Exogenous_, or outside-growing.\r\n\r\n427. =Endogenous Stems=, those of Monocotyls (40), attain their greatest\r\nsize and most characteristic development in Palms and Dragon-trees,\r\ntherefore chiefly in warm climates, although the Palmetto and some\r\nYuccas become trees along the southern borders of the United States. In\r\nsuch stems the woody bundles are more numerous and crowded toward the\r\ncircumference, and so the harder wood is outside; while in an exogenous\r\nstem the oldest and hardest wood is toward the centre. An endogenous\r\nstem has no clear distinction of pith, bark, and wood, concentrically\r\narranged, no silver grain, no annual layers, no bark that peels off\r\nclean from the wood. Yet old stems of Yuccas and the like, that continue\r\nto increase in diameter, do form a sort of layers and a kind of scaly\r\nbark when old. Yuccas show well the curving of the woody bundles (Fig.\r\n471) which below taper out and are lost at the rind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 474. Short piece of stem of Flax, magnified, showing\r\nthe bark, wood, and pith in a cross section.]\r\n\r\n428. =Exogenous Stems=, those of Dicotyls (37), or of plants coming from\r\ndicotyledonous and also polycotyledonous embryos, have a structure which\r\nis familiar in the wood of our ordinary trees and shrubs. It is the same\r\nin an herbaceous shoot (such as a Flax-stem, Fig. 474) as in a\r\nMaple-stem of the first year's growth, except that the woody layer is\r\ncommonly thinner or perhaps reduced to a circle of bundles. It was so in\r\nthe tree-stem at the beginning. The wood all forms in a cylinder,--in\r\ncross section a ring--around a central cellular part, dividing the\r\ncellular core within, the pith, from a cellular bark without. As the\r\nwood-bundles increase in number and in size, they press upon each other\r\nand become wedge-shaped in the cross section; and they continue to grow\r\nfrom the outside, next the bark, so that they become very thin wedges or\r\nplates. Between the plates or wedges are very thin plates (in cross\r\nsection lines) of much compressed cellular tissue, which connect the\r\npith with the bark. The plan of a one-year-old woody stem of this kind\r\nis exhibited in the figures, which are essentially diagrams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 475. Diagram of a cross section of a very young\r\nexogenous stem, showing six woody bundles or wedges. 476. Same later,\r\nwith wedges increased to twelve. 477. Still later, the wedges filling\r\nthe space, separated only by the thin lines, or medullary rays, running\r\nfrom pith to bark.]\r\n\r\n429. When such a stem grows on from year to year, it adds annually a\r\nlayer of wood outside the preceding one, between that and the bark.\r\nThis is exogenous growth, or outside-growing, as the name denotes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 478. Piece of a stem of Soft Maple, of a year old,\r\ncut crosswise and lengthwise.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 479. A portion of the same, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 480. A small piece of the same, taken from one side,\r\nreaching from the bark to the pith, and highly magnified: _a_, a small\r\nbit of the pith; _b_, spiral ducts of what is called the _medullary\r\nsheath_; _c_, the wood; _d_, _d_, dotted ducts in the wood; _e_, _e_,\r\nannular ducts; _f_, the liber or inner bark; _g_, the green bark; _h_,\r\nthe corky layer; _i_, the skin, or epidermis; _j_, one of the medullary\r\nrays, or plates of silver grain, seen on the cross-section.]\r\n\r\n430. Some new bark is formed every year, as well as new wood, the former\r\ninside, as the latter is outside of that of the year preceding. The ring\r\nor zone of tender forming tissue between the bark and the wood has been\r\ncalled the _Cambium Layer_. _Cambium_ is an old name of the\r\nphysiologists for nutritive juice. And this thin layer is so gorged with\r\nrich nutritive sap when spring growth is renewed, that the bark then\r\nseems to be loose from the wood and a layer of viscid sap (or _cambium_)\r\nto be poured out between the two. But there is all the while a\r\nconnection of the bark and the wood by delicate cells, rapidly\r\nmultiplying and growing.\r\n\r\n431. =The Bark= of a year-old stem consists of three parts, more or less\r\ndistinct, namely,--beginning next the wood,--\r\n\r\n1. The LIBER or FIBROUS BARK, the _Inner Bark_. This contains some\r\nwood-cells, or their equivalent, commonly in the form of bast or\r\nbast-cells (411, Fig. 444), such as those of Basswood or Linden, and\r\namong herbs those of flax and hemp, which are spun and woven or made\r\ninto cordage. It also contains cells which are named _sieve_-cells, on\r\naccount of numerous slits and pores in their walls, by which the\r\nprotoplasm of contiguous cells communicates. In woody stems, whenever a\r\nnew layer of wood is formed, some new liber or inner bark is also formed\r\noutside of it.\r\n\r\n2. The GREEN BARK or _Middle Bark_. This consists of cellular tissue\r\nonly, and contains the same green matter (_chlorophyll_, 417) as the\r\nleaves. In woody stems, before the season's growth is completed, it\r\nbecomes covered by\r\n\r\n3. The CORKY LAYER or _Outer Bark_, the cells of which contain no\r\nchlorophyll, and are of the nature of _cork_. Common cork is the thick\r\ncorky layer of the bark of the Cork-Oak of Spain. It is this which gives\r\nto the stems or twigs of shrubs and trees the aspect and the color\r\npeculiar to each,--light gray in the Ash, purple in the Red Maple, red\r\nin several Dogwoods, etc.\r\n\r\n4. The EPIDERMIS, or skin of the plant, consisting of a layer of\r\nthick-sided empty cells, which may be considered to be the outermost\r\nlayer, or in most herbaceous stems the only layer, of cork-cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 481. Magnified view of surface of a bit of young\r\nMaple wood from which the bark has been torn away, showing the\r\nwood-cells and the bark-ends of medullary rays.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 482. Section in the opposite direction, from bark\r\n(on the left) to beginning of pith (on the right), and a medullary ray\r\nextending from one to the other.]\r\n\r\n432. The green layer of bark seldom grows much after the first season.\r\nSometimes the corky layer grows and forms new layers, inside of the old,\r\nfor years, as in the Cork-Oak, the Sweet Gum-tree, and the White and the\r\nPaper Birch. But it all dies after a while; and the continual\r\nenlargement of the wood within finally stretches it more than it can\r\nbear, and sooner or later cracks and rends it, while the weather acts\r\npowerfully upon its surface; so the older bark perishes and falls away\r\npiecemeal year by year.\r\n\r\n433. So on old trunks only the inner bark remains. This is renewed every\r\nyear from within and so kept alive, while the older and outer layers\r\ndie, are fissured and rent by the distending trunk, weathered and worn,\r\nand thrown off in fragments,--in some trees slowly, so that the bark of\r\nold trunks may acquire great thickness; in others, more rapidly. In\r\nHoneysuckles and Grape-Vines, the layers of liber loosen and die when\r\nonly a year or two old. The annual layers of liber are sometimes as\r\ndistinct as those of the wood, but often not so.\r\n\r\n434. =The Wood= of an exogenous trunk, having the old growths covered\r\nby the new, remains nearly unchanged in age, except from decay. Wherever\r\nthere is an annual suspension and renewal of growth, as in temperate\r\nclimates, the annual growths are more or less distinctly marked, in the\r\nform of concentric rings on the cross section, so that the age of the\r\ntree may be known by counting them. Over twelve hundred layers have been\r\ncounted on the stumps of Sequoias in California, and it is probable that\r\nsome trees now living antedate the Christian era.\r\n\r\n435. The reason why the annual growths are distinguishable is, that the\r\nwood formed at the beginning of the season is more or less different in\r\nthe size or character of the cells from that of the close. In Oak,\r\nChestnut, etc., the first wood of the season abounds in dotted ducts,\r\nthe calibre of which is many times greater than that of the proper\r\nwood-cells.\r\n\r\n436. =Sap-wood, or Alburnum.= This is the newer wood, living or recently\r\nalive, and taking part in the conveyance of sap. Sooner or later, each\r\nlayer, as it becomes more and more deeply covered by the newer ones and\r\nfarther from the region of growth, is converted into\r\n\r\n437. =Heart-wood, or Duramen.= This is drier, harder, more solid, and\r\nmuch more durable as timber, than sap-wood. It is generally of a\r\ndifferent color, and it exhibits in different species the hue peculiar\r\nto each, such as reddish in Red-Cedar, brown in Black-Walnut, black in\r\nEbony, etc. The change of sap-wood into heart-wood results from the\r\nthickening of the walls of the wood-cells by the deposition of hard\r\nmatter, lining the tubes and diminishing their calibre; and by the\r\ndeposition of a vegetable coloring-matter peculiar to each species. The\r\nheart-wood, being no longer a living part, may decay, and often does so,\r\nwithout the least injury to the tree, except by diminishing the strength\r\nof the trunk, and so rendering it more liable to be overthrown.\r\n\r\n438. =The Living Parts of a Tree=, of the exogenous kind, are only\r\nthese: first, the rootlets at one extremity; second, the buds and leaves\r\nof the season at the other; and third, a zone consisting of the newest\r\nwood and the newest bark, connecting the rootlets with the buds or\r\nleaves, however widely separated these may be,--in the tallest trees\r\nfrom two to four hundred feet apart. And these parts of the tree are all\r\nrenewed every year. No wonder, therefore, that trees may live so long,\r\nsince they annually reproduce everything that is essential to their life\r\nand growth, and since only a very small part of their bulk is alive at\r\nonce. The tree survives, but nothing now living has been so long. In it,\r\nas elsewhere, life is a transitory thing, ever abandoning the _old_, and\r\nrenewed in the _young_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4. ANATOMY OF LEAVES.\r\n\r\n439. The wood in leaves is the framework of ribs, veins, and veinlets\r\n(125), serving not only to strengthen them, but also to bring in the\r\nsap, and to distribute it throughout every part. The cellular portion is\r\nthe green pulp, and is nearly the same as the green layer of the bark.\r\nSo that the leaf may properly enough be regarded as a sort of expansion\r\nof the fibrous and green layers of the bark. It has no proper corky\r\nlayer; but the whole is covered by a transparent skin or _epidermis_,\r\nresembling that of the stem.\r\n\r\n440. The cells of the leaf are of various forms, rarely so compact as to\r\nform a close cellular tissue, usually loosely arranged, at least in the\r\nlower part, so as to give copious intervening spaces or air passages,\r\ncommunicating throughout the whole interior (Fig. 443, 483). The green\r\ncolor is given by the chlorophyll (417), seen through the very\r\ntransparent walls of the cells and through the translucent epidermis of\r\nthe leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 483. Magnified section of a leaf of White Lily, to\r\nexhibit the cellular structure, both of upper and lower stratum, the\r\nair-passages of the lower, and the epidermis or skin, in section, also a\r\nlittle of that of the lower face, with some of its stomates.]\r\n\r\n441. In ordinary leaves, having an upper and under surface, the green\r\ncells form two distinct strata, of different arrangement. Those of the\r\nupper stratum are oblong or cylindrical, and stand endwise to the\r\nsurface of the leaf, usually close together, leaving hardly any vacant\r\nspaces; those of the lower are commonly irregular in shape, most of them\r\nwith their longer diameter parallel to the face of the leaf, and are\r\nvery loosely arranged, leaving many and wide air-chambers. The green\r\ncolor of the lower is therefore diluted, and paler than that of the\r\nupper face of the leaf. The upper part of the leaf is so constructed as\r\nto bear the direct action of the sunshine; the lower so as to afford\r\nfreer circulation of air, and to facilitate transpiration. It\r\ncommunicates more directly than the upper with the external air by means\r\nof _Stomates_.\r\n\r\n442. =The Epidermis= or skin of leaves and all young shoots is best seen\r\nin the foliage. It may readily be stripped off from the surface of a\r\nLily-leaf, and still more so from more fleshy and soft leaves, such as\r\nthose of Houseleek. The epidermis is usually composed of a single\r\nlayer, occasionally of two or three layers, of empty cells, mostly of\r\nirregular outline. The sinuous lines which traverse it, and may be\r\ndiscerned under low powers of the microscope (Fig. 487), are the\r\nboundaries of the epidermal cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 484. Small portion of epidermis of the lower face of\r\na White-Lily leaf, with stomata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 485. One of these, more magnified, in the closed\r\nstate. 486. Another stoma, open.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 487. Small portion of epidermis of the Garden\r\nBalsam, highly magnified, showing very sinuous-walled cells, and three\r\nstomata.]\r\n\r\n443. =Breathing-pores, or Stomates, Stomata= (singular, a\r\n_Stoma_,--literally, a mouth) are openings through the epidermis into\r\nthe air-chambers or intercellular passages, always between and guarded\r\nby a pair of thin-walled guardian cells. Although most abundant in\r\nleaves, especially on their lower face (that which is screened from\r\ndirect sunlight), they are found on most other green parts. They\r\nestablish a direct communication between the external air and that in\r\nthe loose interior of the leaf. Their guardian cells or lips, which are\r\nsoft and delicate, like those of the green pulp within, by their greater\r\nor less turgidity open or close the orifice as the moisture or dryness\r\nvaries.\r\n\r\n444. In the White Lily the stomata are so remarkably large that they may\r\nbe seen by a simple microscope of moderate power, and may be discerned\r\neven by a good hand lens. There are about 60,000 of them to the square\r\ninch of the epidermis of the lower face of this Lily-leaf, and only\r\nabout 3000 to the same space on the upper face. It is computed that an\r\naverage leaf of an Apple-tree has on its lower face about 100,000 of\r\nthese mouths.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 5. PLANT FOOD AND ASSIMILATION.\r\n\r\n445. Only plants are capable of originating organizable matter, or the\r\nmaterials which compose the structure of vegetables and animals. The\r\nessential and peculiar work of plants is to take up portions of earth\r\nand air (water belonging to both) upon which animals cannot live at all,\r\nand to convert them into something organizable; that is, into something\r\nthat, under life, may be built up into vegetable and animal structures.\r\nAll the food of animals is produced by plants. Animals live upon\r\nvegetables, directly or at second hand, the carnivorous upon the\r\nherbivorous; and vegetables live upon earth and air, immediately or at\r\nsecond hand.\r\n\r\n446. =The Food of plants=, then, primarily, is earth and air. This is\r\nevident enough from the way in which they live. Many plants will\r\nflourish in pure sand or powdered chalk, or on the bare face of a rock\r\nor wall, watered merely with rain. And almost any plant may be made to\r\ngrow from the seed in moist sand, and increase its weight many times,\r\neven if it will not come to perfection. Many naturally live suspended\r\nfrom the branches of trees high in the air, and nourished by it alone,\r\nnever having any connection with the soil; and some which naturally grow\r\non the ground, like the Live-forever of the gardens, when pulled up by\r\nthe roots and hung in the air will often flourish the whole summer long.\r\n\r\n447. It is true that fast-growing plants, or those which produce much\r\nvegetable matter in one season (especially in such concentrated form as\r\nto be useful as food for man or the higher animals) will come to\r\nmaturity only in an enriched soil. But what is a rich soil? One which\r\ncontains decomposing vegetable matter, or some decomposing animal\r\nmatter; that is, in either case, some decomposing organic matter\r\nformerly produced by plants. Aided by this, grain-bearing and other\r\nimportant vegetables will grow more rapidly and vigorously, and make a\r\ngreater amount of nourishing matter, than they could if left to do the\r\nwhole work at once from the beginning. So that in these cases also all\r\nthe organic or organizable matter was made by plants, and made out of\r\nearth and air. Far the larger and most essential part was air and water.\r\n\r\n448. Two kinds of material are taken in and used by plants; of which the\r\nfirst, although more or less essential to perfect plant-growth, are in a\r\ncertain sense subsidiary, if not accidental, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Earthy constituents_, those which are left in the form of ashes when a\r\nleaf or a stick of wood is burned in the open air. These consist of some\r\n_potash_ (or _soda_ in a marine plant), some _silex_ (the same as\r\nflint), and a little _lime_, _alumine_, or _magnesia_, _iron_ or\r\n_manganese_, _sulphur_, _phosphorus_, etc.,--some or all of these in\r\nvariable and usually minute proportions. They are such materials as\r\nhappen to be dissolved, in small quantity, in the water taken up by the\r\nroots; and when that is consumed by the plant, or flies off pure (as it\r\nlargely does) by exhalation, the earthy matter is left behind in the\r\ncells,--just as it is left incrusting the sides of a teakettle in which\r\nmuch hard water has been boiled. Naturally, therefore, there is more\r\nearthy matter (i. e. more ashes) in the leaves than in any other part\r\n(sometimes as much as seven per cent, when the wood contains only two\r\nper cent); because it is through the leaves that most of the water\r\nescapes from the plant. Some of this earthy matter incrusts the\r\ncell-walls, some goes to form crystals or rhaphides, which abound in\r\nmany plants (422), some enters into certain special vegetable products,\r\nand some appears to be necessary to the well-being of the higher orders\r\nof plants, although forming no necessary part of the proper vegetable\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n_The essential constituents_ of the organic fabric are those which are\r\ndissipated into air and vapor in complete burning. They make up from 88\r\nto 99 per cent of the leaf or stem, and essentially the whole both of\r\nthe cellulose of the walls and the protoplasm of the contents. Burning\r\ngives these materials of the plant's structure back to the air, mainly\r\nin the same condition in which the plant took them, the same condition\r\nwhich is reached more slowly in natural decay. The chemical elements of\r\nthe cell-walls (or cellulose, 402), as also of starch, sugar, and all\r\nthat class of organizable cell-material, are carbon, hydrogen, and\r\noxygen (399). The same, with nitrogen, are the constituents of\r\nprotoplasm, or the truly vital part of vegetation.\r\n\r\n449. These chemical elements out of which organic matters are composed\r\nare supplied to the plant by water, carbonic acid, and some combinations\r\nof nitrogen.\r\n\r\n_Water_, far more largely than anything else, is imbibed by the roots;\r\nalso more or less by the foliage in the form of vapor. Water consists of\r\noxygen and hydrogen; and cellulose or plant-wall, starch, sugar, etc.,\r\nhowever different in their qualities, agree in containing these two\r\nelements in the same relative proportions as in water.\r\n\r\n_Carbonic acid_ gas (Carbon dioxide) is one of the components of the\r\natmosphere,--a small one, ordinarily only about 1/2500 of its\r\nbulk,--sufficient for the supply of vegetation, but not enough to be\r\ninjurious to animals, as it would be if accumulated. Every current or\r\nbreeze of air brings to the leaves expanded in it a succession of fresh\r\natoms of carbonic acid, which it absorbs through its multitudinous\r\nbreathing-pores. This gas is also taken up by water. So it is brought to\r\nthe ground by rain, and is absorbed by the roots of plants, either as\r\ndissolved in the water they imbibe, or in the form of gas in the\r\ninterstices of the soil. Manured ground, that is, soil containing\r\ndecomposing vegetable or animal matters, is constantly giving out this\r\ngas into the interstices of the soil, whence the roots of the growing\r\ncrop absorb it. Carbonic acid thus supplied, primarily from the air, is\r\nthe source of the carbon which forms much the largest part of the\r\nsubstance of every plant. The proportion of carbon may be roughly\r\nestimated by charring some wood or foliage; that is, by heating it out\r\nof contact with the air, so as to decompose and drive off all the other\r\nconstituents of the fabric, leaving the large bulk of charcoal or carbon\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen_, the remaining plant-element, is a gas which makes up more\r\nthan two thirds of the atmosphere, is brought into the foliage and also\r\nto the roots (being moderately soluble in water) in the same ways as is\r\ncarbonic acid. The nitrogen which, mixed with oxygen, a little carbonic\r\nacid, and vapor of water, constitutes the air we breathe, is the source\r\nof this fourth plant-element. But it is very doubtful if ordinary plants\r\ncan use any nitrogen gas directly as food; that is, if they can directly\r\ncause it to combine with the other elements so as to form protoplasm.\r\nBut when combined with hydrogen (forming ammonia), or when combined with\r\noxygen (nitric acid and nitrates) plants appropriate it with avidity.\r\nAnd several natural processes are going on in which nitrogen of the air\r\nis so combined and supplied to the soil in forms directly available to\r\nthe plant. The most efficient is _nitrification_, the formation of nitre\r\n(nitrate of potash) in the soil, especially in all fertile soils,\r\nthrough the action of a bacterial ferment.\r\n\r\n450. =Assimilation= in plants is the conversion of these inorganic\r\nsubstances--essentially, water, carbonic acid, and some form of combined\r\nor combinable nitrogen--into vegetable matter. This most dilute food the\r\nliving plant concentrates and assimilates to itself. Only plants are\r\ncapable of converting these mineral into organizable matters; and this\r\nall-important work is done by them (so far as all ordinary vegetation is\r\nconcerned) only\r\n\r\n451. _Under the light of the sun, acting upon green parts or foliage_,\r\nthat is, upon the chlorophyll, or upon what answers to chlorophyll,\r\nwhich these parts contain. The sun in some way supplies a power which\r\nenables the living plant to originate these peculiar chemical\r\ncombinations,--to organize matter into forms which are alone capable of\r\nbeing endowed with life. The proof of this proposition is simple; and it\r\nshows at the same time, in the simplest way, what a plant does with the\r\nwater and carbonic acid it consumes. Namely, 1st, it is only in sunshine\r\nor bright daylight that the green parts of plants give out oxygen\r\ngas,--then they regularly do so; and 2d, the giving out of this oxygen\r\ngas is required to render the chemical composition of water and carbonic\r\nacid the same as that of _cellulose_, that is, of the plant's permanent\r\nfabric. This shows why plants spread out so large a surface of foliage.\r\nLeaves are so many workshops, full of machinery worked by sun-power. The\r\nemission of oxygen gas from any sun-lit foliage is seen by placing some\r\nof this under water, or by using an aquatic plant, by collecting the air\r\nbubbles which rise, and by noting that a taper burns brighter in this\r\nair. Or a leafy plant in a glass globe may be supplied with a certain\r\nsmall percentage of carbonic acid gas, and after proper exposure to\r\nsunshine, the air on being tested will be found to contain less carbonic\r\nacid and just so much the more oxygen gas.\r\n\r\n452. Now if the plant is making cellulose or any equivalent\r\nsubstance,--that is, is making the very materials of its fabric and\r\ngrowth, as must generally be the case,--all this oxygen gas given off by\r\nthe leaves comes from the decomposition of carbonic acid taken in by the\r\nplant. For cellulose, and also starch, dextrine, sugar, and the like are\r\ncomposed of carbon along with oxygen and hydrogen in just the\r\nproportions to form water. And the carbonic acid and water taken in,\r\nless the oxygen which the carbon brought with it as carbonic acid, and\r\nwhich is given off from the foliage in sunshine, just represents the\r\nmanufactured article, cellulose.\r\n\r\n453. It comes to the same if the first product of assimilation is sugar,\r\nor dextrine which is a sort of soluble starch, or starch itself. And in\r\nthe plant all these forms are readily changed into one another. In the\r\ntiny seedling, as fast as this assimilated matter is formed it is used\r\nin growth, that is, in the formation of cell-walls. After a time some or\r\nmuch of the product may be accumulated in store for future growth, as\r\nin the root of the turnip, or the tuber of the potato, or the seed of\r\ncorn or pulse. This store is mainly in the form of starch. When growth\r\nbegins anew, this starch is turned into dextrine or into sugar, in\r\nliquid form, and used to nourish and build up the germinating embryo or\r\nthe new shoot, where it is at length converted into cellulose and used\r\nto build up plant-structure.\r\n\r\n454. But that which builds plant-fabric is not the cellular structure\r\nitself; the work is done by the living protoplasm which dwells within\r\nthe walls. This also has to take and to assimilate its proper food, for\r\nits own maintenance and growth. Protoplasm assimilates, along with the\r\nother three elements, the nitrogen of the plant's food. This comes\r\nprimarily from the vast stock in the atmosphere, but mainly through the\r\nearth, where it is accumulated through various processes in a fertile\r\nsoil,--mainly, so far as concerns crops, from the decomposition of\r\nformer vegetables and animals. This protoplasm, which is formed at the\r\nsame time as the simpler cellulose, is essentially the same as the flesh\r\nof animals, and the source of it. It is the common basis of vegetable\r\nand of animal life.\r\n\r\n455. _So plant-assimilation produces all the food and fabric of\r\nanimals._ Starch, sugar, the oils (which are, as it were, these\r\nfarinaceous matters more deoxidated), chlorophyll, and the like, and\r\neven cellulose itself, form the food of herbivorous animals and much of\r\nthe food of man. When digested they enter into the blood, undergo\r\nvarious transformations, and are at length decomposed into carbonic acid\r\nand water, and exhaled from the lungs in respiration,--in other words,\r\nare given back to the air by the animal as the very same materials which\r\nthe plant took from the air as its food,--are given back to the air in\r\nthe same form that they would have taken if the vegetable matter had\r\nbeen left to decay where it grew, or if it had been set on fire and\r\nburned; and with the same result, too, as to the heat,--the heat in this\r\ncase producing and maintaining the proper temperature of the animal.\r\n\r\n456. The protoplasm and other products containing nitrogen (gluten,\r\nlegumine, etc.), and which are most accumulated in grains and seeds (for\r\nthe nourishment of their embryos when they germinate), compose the most\r\nnutritious vegetable food consumed by animals; they form their proper\r\nflesh and sinews, while the earthy constituents of the plant form the\r\nearthy matter of the bones, etc. At length decomposed, in the secretions\r\nand excretions, these nitrogenous constituents are through successive\r\nchanges finally resolved into mineral matter, into carbonic acid, water,\r\nand ammonia or some nitrates,--into exactly or essentially the same\r\nmaterials which the plants took up and assimilated. Animals depend upon\r\nvegetables absolutely and directly for their subsistence; also\r\nindirectly, because\r\n\r\n457. _Plants purify the air for animals._ In the very process by which\r\nthey create food they take from the air carbonic acid gas, injurious to\r\nanimal respiration, which is continually poured into it by the breathing\r\nof all animals, by all decay, by the burning of fuel and all other\r\nordinary combustion; and they restore an equal bulk of life-sustaining\r\noxygen needful for the respiration of animals,--needful, also, in a\r\ncertain measure, for plants in any work they do. For in plants, as well\r\nas in animals, work is done at a certain cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 6. PLANT WORK AND MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n458. As the organic basis and truly living material of plants is\r\nidentical with that of animals, so is the life at bottom essentially the\r\nsame; but in animals something is added at every rise from the lowest to\r\nhighest organisms. Action and work in living beings require movement.\r\n\r\n459. Living things move; those not living are only moved. Plants move as\r\ntruly as do animals. The latter, nourished as they are upon organized\r\nfood, which has been prepared for them by plants, and is found only here\r\nand there, must needs have the power of going after it, of collecting\r\nit, or at least of taking it in; which requires them to make spontaneous\r\nmovements. But ordinary plants, with their wide-spread surface, always\r\nin contact with the earth and air on which they feed,--the latter\r\neverywhere the same, and the former very much so,--might be thought to\r\nhave no need of movement. Ordinary plants, indeed, have no locomotion;\r\nsome float, but most are rooted to the spot where they grew. Yet\r\nprobably all of them execute various movements which must be as truly\r\nself-caused as are those of the lower grades of animals,--movements\r\nwhich are overlooked only because too slow to be directly observed.\r\nNevertheless, the motion of the hour-hand and of the minute-hand of a\r\nwatch is not less real than that of the second-hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 488. Two individuals of an Oscillaria, magnified.]\r\n\r\n460. =Locomotion.= Moreover, many microscopic plants living in water are\r\nseen to move freely, if not briskly, under the microscope; and so\r\nlikewise do more conspicuous aquatic plants in their embryo-like or\r\nseedling state. Even at maturity, species of Oscillaria (such as in Fig.\r\n488, minute worm-shaped plants of fresh waters, taking this name from\r\ntheir oscillating motions) freely execute three different kinds of\r\nmovement, the very delicate investing coat of cellulose not impeding the\r\naction of the living protoplasm within. Even when this coat is firmer\r\nand hardened with a siliceous deposit, such crescent-shaped or\r\nboat-shaped one-celled plants as _Closterium_ or _Naricula_ are able in\r\nsome way to move along from place to place in the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 489. A few cells of a leaf of Naias flexilis, highly\r\nmagnified: the arrows indicate the courses of the circulating currents.]\r\n\r\n461. =Movements in Cells=, =or Cell-circulation=, sometimes called\r\n_Cyclosis_, has been detected in so many plants, especially in\r\ncomparatively transparent aquatic plants and in hairs on the surface of\r\nland plants (where it is easiest to observe), that it may be inferred to\r\ntake place in all cells during the most active part of their life. This\r\nmotion is commonly a streaming movement of threads of protoplasm,\r\ncarrying along solid granules by which the action may be observed and\r\nthe rate measured, or in some cases it is a rotation of the whole\r\nprotoplasmic contents of the cell. A comparatively low magnifying power\r\nwill show it in the cells of Nitella and Chara (which are cryptogamous\r\nplants); and under a moderate power it is well seen in the Tape Grass of\r\nfresh water, Vallisneria, and in Naias flexilis (Fig. 489). Minute\r\nparticles and larger greenish globules are seen to be carried along, as\r\nif in a current, around the cell, passing up one side, across the end,\r\ndown the other and across the bottom, completing the circuit sometimes\r\nwithin a minute or less when well warmed. To see it well in the cell,\r\nwhich like a string of beads form the hairs on the stamens of\r\nSpiderwort, a high magnifying power is needed.\r\n\r\n462. =Transference of Liquid from Cell to Cell=, and so from place to\r\nplace in the plant, the absorption of water by the rootlets, and the\r\nexhalation of the greater part of it from the foliage,--these and\r\nsimilar operations are governed by the physical laws which regulate the\r\ndiffusion of fluids, but are controlled by the action of living\r\nprotoplasm. Equally under vital control are the various chemical\r\ntransformations which attend assimilation and growth, and which involve\r\nnot only molecular movements but conveyance. Growth itself, which is the\r\nformation and shaping of new parts, implies the direction of internal\r\nactivities to definite ends.\r\n\r\n463. =Movements of Organs.= The living protoplasm, in all but the lowest\r\ngrade of plants, is enclosed and to common appearance isolated in\r\nseparate cells, the walls of which can only in their earliest state be\r\nsaid to be alive. Still plants are able to cause the protoplasm of\r\nadjacent cells to act in concert, and by their combined action to effect\r\nmovements in roots, stems, or leaves, some of them very slow and\r\ngradual, some manifest and striking. Such movements are brought about\r\nthrough individually minute changes in the form or tension in the\r\nprotoplasm of the innumerable cells which make up the structure of the\r\norgan. Some of the slower movements are effected during growth, and may\r\nbe explained by inequality of growth on the two sides of the bending\r\norgan. But the more rapid changes of position, and some of the slow\r\nones, cannot be so explained.\r\n\r\n464. =Root-movements.= In its growth a root turns or bends away from\r\nthe light and toward the centre of the earth, so that in lengthening it\r\nburies itself in the soil where it is to live and act. Every one must\r\nhave observed this in the germination of seeds. Careful observations\r\nhave shown that the tip of a growing root also makes little sweeps or\r\nshort movements from side to side. By this means it more readily\r\ninsinuates itself into yielding portions of the soil. The root-tips will\r\nalso turn toward moisture, and so secure the most favorable positions in\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n465. =Stem-movements.= The root end of the caulicle or first joint of\r\nstem (that below the cotyledons) acts like the root, in turning downward\r\nin germination (making a complete bend to do so if it happens to point\r\nupward as the seed lies in the ground), while the other end turns or\r\npoints skyward. These opposite positions are taken in complete darkness\r\nas readily as in the light, in dryness as much as in moisture:\r\ntherefore, so far as these movements are physical, the two portions of\r\nthe same internode appear to be oppositely affected by gravitation or\r\nother influences.\r\n\r\n466. Rising into the air, the stem and green shoots generally, while\r\nyoung and pliable, bend or direct themselves toward the light, or toward\r\nthe stronger light when unequally illuminated; while roots turn toward\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\n467. Many growing stems have also a movement of _Nutation_, that is, of\r\nnodding successively in different directions. This is brought about by a\r\ntemporary increase of turgidity of the cells along one side, thus bowing\r\nthe stem over to the opposite side; and this line of turgescence travels\r\nround the shoot continually, from right to left or from left to right\r\naccording to the species: thus the shoot bends to all points of the\r\ncompass in succession. Commonly this nutation is slight or hardly\r\nobservable. It is most marked in\r\n\r\n468. =Twining Stems= (Fig. 90). The growing upper end of such stems, as\r\nis familiar in the Hop, Pole Beans, and Morning-Glory, turns over in an\r\ninclined or horizontal direction, thus stretching out to reach a\r\nneighboring support, and by the continual change in the direction of the\r\nnodding, sweeps the whole circle, the sweeps being the longer as the\r\nstem lengthens. When it strikes against a support, such as a stem or\r\nbranch of a neighboring plant, the motion is arrested at the contact,\r\nbut continues at the growing apex beyond, and this apex is thus made to\r\nwind spirally around the supporting body.\r\n\r\n469. =Leaf-movements= are all but universal. The presentation by most\r\nleaves of their upper surface to the light, from whatever direction that\r\nmay come, is an instance; for when turned upside down they twist or bend\r\nround on the stalk to recover this normal position. Leaves, and the\r\nleaflets of compound leaves, change this position at nightfall, or when\r\nthe light is withdrawn; they then take what is called their sleeping\r\nposture, resuming the diurnal position when daylight returns. This is\r\nvery striking in Locust-trees, in the Sensitive Plant (Fig. 490), and\r\nin Woodsorrel. Young seedlings droop or close their leaves at night in\r\nplants which are not thus affected in the adult foliage. All this is\r\nthought to be a protection against the cold by nocturnal radiation.\r\n\r\n470. Various plants climb by a coiling movement of their leaves or their\r\nleaf-stalks. Familiar examples are seen in Clematis, Maurandia,\r\nTropaeolum, and in a Solanum which is much cultivated in greenhouses\r\n(Fig. 172). In the latter, and in other woody plants which climb in this\r\nway, the petioles thicken and harden after they have grasped their\r\nsupport, thus securing a very firm hold.\r\n\r\n471. =Tendril movements.= Tendrils are either leaves or stems (98, 168),\r\nspecially developed for climbing purposes. Cobaea is a good example of\r\npartial transformation; some of the leaflets are normal, some of the\r\nsame leaf are little tendrils, and some intermediate in character. The\r\nPassion-flowers give good examples of simple stem-tendrils (Fig. 92);\r\nGrape-Vines, of branched ones. Most tendrils make revolving sweeps, like\r\nthose of twining stems. Those of some Passion-flowers, in sultry\r\nweather, are apt to move fast enough for the movement actually to be\r\nseen for a part of the circuit, as plainly as that of the second-hand of\r\na watch. Two herbaceous species, Passiflora gracilis and P. sicyoides\r\n(the first an annual, the second a strong-rooted perennial of the\r\neasiest cultivation), are admirable for illustration both of revolving\r\nmovements and of sensitive coiling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 490. Piece of stem of Sensitive Plant (Mimosa\r\npudica), with two leaves, the lower open, the upper in the closed\r\nstate.]\r\n\r\n472. =Movements under Irritation.= The most familiar case is that of the\r\nSensitive Plant (Fig. 490). The leaves suddenly take their nocturnal\r\nposition when roughly touched or when shocked by a jar. The leaflets\r\nclose in pairs, the four outspread partial petioles come closer\r\ntogether, and the common petiole is depressed. The seat of the movements\r\nis at the base of the leaf-stalk and stalklets. Schrankia, a near\r\nrelative of the Sensitive Plant, acts in the same way, but is slower.\r\nThese are not anomalous actions, but only extreme manifestations of a\r\nfaculty more or less common in foliage. In Locust and Honey-Locusts for\r\nexample, repeated jars will slowly produce similar effects.\r\n\r\n473. Leaf-stalks and tendrils are adapted to their uses in climbing by\r\na similar sensitiveness. The coiling of the leaf-stalk is in response to\r\na kind of irritation produced by contact with the supporting body. This\r\nmay be shown by gentle rubbing or prolonged pressure upon the upper face\r\nof the leaf-stalk, which is soon followed by a curvature. Tendrils are\r\nstill more sensitive to contact or light friction. This causes the free\r\nend of the tendril to coil round the support, and the sensitiveness,\r\npropagated downward along the tendril, causes that side of it to become\r\nless turgescent or the opposite side more so, thus throwing the tendril\r\ninto coils. This shortening draws the plant up to the support. Tendrils\r\nwhich have not laid hold will at length commonly coil spontaneously, in\r\na simple coil, from the free apex downward. In Sicyos, Echinocystis, and\r\nthe above mentioned Passion-flowers (471), the tendril is so sensitive,\r\nunder a high summer temperature, that it will curve and coil promptly\r\nafter one or two light strokes by the hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 491. Portion of stem and leaves of Telegraph-plant\r\n(Desmodium gyrans), almost of natural size.]\r\n\r\n474. Among spontaneous movements the most singular are those of\r\nDesmodium gyrans of India, sometimes called Telegraph-plant, which is\r\ncultivated on account of this action. Of its three leaflets, the larger\r\n(terminal) one moves only by drooping at nightfall and rising with the\r\ndawn. But its two small lateral leaflets, when in a congenial high\r\ntemperature, by day and by night move upward and downward in a\r\nsuccession of jerks, stopping occasionally, as if to recover from\r\nexhaustion. In most plant-movements some obviously useful purpose is\r\nsubserved: this of Desmodium gyrans is a riddle.\r\n\r\n475. =Movements in Flowers= are very various. The most remarkable are in\r\nsome way connected with fertilization (Sect. XIII.). Some occur under\r\nirritation: the stamens of Barberry start forward when touched at the\r\nbase inside: those of many polyandrous flowers (of Sparmannia very\r\nstrikingly) spread outwardly when lightly brushed: the two lips or lobes\r\nof the stigma in Mimulus close after a touch. Some are automatic and\r\nare connected with dichogamy (339): the style of Sabbatia and of\r\nlarge-flowered species of Epilobium bends over strongly to one side or\r\nturns downward when the blossom opens, but slowly erects itself a day or\r\ntwo later.\r\n\r\n476. =Extraordinary Movements connected with Capture of Insects.= The\r\nmost striking cases are those of Drosera and Dionaea; for an account of\r\nwhich see \"How Plants Behave,\" and Goodale's \"Physiological Botany.\"\r\n\r\n477. The upper face of the leaves of the common species of Drosera, or\r\nSundew, is beset with stout bristles, having a glandular tip. This tip\r\nsecretes a drop of a clear but very viscid liquid, which glistens like a\r\ndew-drop in the sun; whence the popular name. When a fly or other small\r\ninsect, attracted by the liquid, alights upon the leaf, the viscid drops\r\nare so tenacious that they hold it fast. In struggling it only becomes\r\nmore completely entangled. Now the neighboring bristles, which have not\r\nbeen touched, slowly bend inward from all sides toward the captured\r\ninsect, and bring their sticky apex against its body, thus increasing\r\nthe number of bonds. Moreover, the blade of the leaf commonly aids in\r\nthe capture by becoming concave, its sides or edges turning inward,\r\nwhich brings still more of the gland-tipped bristles into contact with\r\nthe captive's body. The insect perishes; the clear liquid disappears,\r\napparently by absorption into the tissue of the leaf. It is thought that\r\nthe absorbed secretion takes with it some of the juices of the insect or\r\nthe products of its decomposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 492. Plant of Dionaea muscipula, or Venus's Fly-trap,\r\nreduced in size.]\r\n\r\n478. Dionaea muscipula, the most remarkable vegetable fly-trap (Fig. 176,\r\n492), is related to the Sundews, and has a more special and active\r\napparatus for fly-catching, formed of the summit of the leaf. The two\r\nhalves of this rounded body move as if they were hinged upon the midrib;\r\ntheir edges are fringed with spiny but not glandular bristles, which\r\ninterlock when the organ closes. Upon the face are two or three short\r\nand delicate bristles, which are sensitive. They do not themselves move\r\nwhen touched, but they propagate the sensitiveness to the organ itself,\r\ncausing it to close with a quick movement. In a fresh and vigorous\r\nleaf, under a high summer temperature, and when the trap lies widely\r\nopen, a touch of any one of the minute bristles on the face, by the\r\nfinger or any extraneous body, springs the trap (so to say), and it\r\ncloses suddenly; but after an hour or so it opens again. When a fly or\r\nother small insect alights on the trap, it closes in the same manner,\r\nand so quickly that the intercrossing marginal bristles obstruct the\r\negress of the insect, unless it be a small one and not worth taking.\r\nAfterwards and more slowly it completely closes, and presses down upon\r\nthe prey; then some hidden glands pour out a glairy liquid, which\r\ndissolves out the juices of the insect's body; next all is re-absorbed\r\ninto the plant, and the trap opens to repeat the operation. But the same\r\nleaf perhaps never captures more than two or three insects. It ages\r\ninstead, becomes more rigid and motionless, or decays away.\r\n\r\n479. That some few plants should thus take animal food will appear less\r\nsurprising when it is considered that hosts of plants of the lower\r\ngrade, known as Fungi, moulds, rusts, ferments, Bacteria, etc., live\r\nupon animal or other organized matter, either decaying or living. That\r\nplants should execute movements in order to accomplish the ends of their\r\nexistence is less surprising now when it is known that the living\r\nsubstance of plants and animals is essentially the same; that the beings\r\nof both kingdoms partake of a common life, to which, as they rise in the\r\nscale, other and higher endowments are successively superadded.\r\n\r\n480. =Work uses up material and energy= in plants as well as in animals.\r\nThe latter live and work by the consumption and decomposition of that\r\nwhich plants have assimilated into organizable matter through an energy\r\nderived from the sun, and which is, so to say, stored up in the\r\nassimilated products. In every internal action, as well as in every\r\nmovement and exertion, some portion of this assimilated matter is\r\ntransformed and of its stored energy expended. The steam-engine is an\r\norganism for converting the sun's radiant energy, stored up by plants in\r\nthe fuel, into mechanical work. An animal is an engine fed by vegetable\r\nfuel in the same or other forms, from the same source, by the\r\ndecomposition of which it also does mechanical work. The plant is the\r\nproducer of food and accumulator of solar energy or force. But the\r\nplant, like the animal, is a consumer whenever and by so much as it does\r\nany work except its great work of assimilation. Every internal change\r\nand movement, every transformation, such as that of starch into sugar\r\nand of sugar into cell-walls, as well as every movement of parts which\r\nbecomes externally visible, is done at the expense of a certain amount\r\nof its assimilated matter and of its stored energy; that is, by the\r\ndecomposition or combustion of sugar or some such product into carbonic\r\nacid and water, which is given back to the air, just as in the animal it\r\nis given back to the air in respiration. So the respiration of plants is\r\nas real and as essential as that of animals. But what plants consume or\r\ndecompose in their life and action is of insignificant amount in\r\ncomparison with what they compose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection XVII. CRYPTOGAMOUS OR FLOWERLESS PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n481. Even the beginner in botany should have some general idea of what\r\ncryptogamous plants are, and what are the obvious distinctions of the\r\nprincipal families. Although the lower grades are difficult, and need\r\nspecial books and good microscopes for their study, the higher orders,\r\nsuch as Ferns, may be determined almost as readily as phanerogamous\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n482. Linnaeus gave to this lower grade of plants the name of\r\n_Cryptogamia_, thereby indicating that their organs answering to stamens\r\nand pistils, if they had any, were recondite and unknown. There is no\r\nvalid reason why this long-familiar name should not be kept up, along\r\nwith the counterpart one of _Phanerogamia_ (6), although organs\r\nanalogous to stamens and pistil, or rather to pollen and ovule, have\r\nbeen discovered in all the higher and most of the lower grades of this\r\nseries of plants. So also the English synonymous name of _Flowerless\r\nPlants_ is both good and convenient: for they have not flowers in the\r\nproper sense. The essentials of flowers are stamens and pistils, giving\r\nrise to seeds, and the essential of a seed is an embryo (8).\r\nCryptogamous or Flowerless plants are propagated by SPORES; and a spore\r\nis not an embryo-plantlet, but mostly a single plant-cell (399).\r\n\r\n483. =Vascular Cryptogams=, which compose the higher orders of this\r\nseries of plants, have stems and (usually) leaves, constructed upon the\r\ngeneral plan of ordinary plants; that is, they have wood (wood-cells and\r\nvessels, 408) in the stem and leaves, in the latter as a frame work of\r\nveins. But the lower grades, having only the more elementary cellular\r\nstructure, are called _Cellular Cryptogams_. Far the larger number of\r\nthe former are Ferns: wherefore that class has been called\r\n\r\n484. =Pteridophyta, Pteridophytes= in English form, meaning\r\n_Fern-plants_,--that is, Ferns and their relatives. They are mainly\r\nHorsetails, Ferns, Club-Mosses, and various aquatics which have been\r\ncalled _Hydropterides_, i. e. Water-Ferns.\r\n\r\n485. =Horsetails=, _Equisetaceae_, is the name of a family which consists\r\nonly (among now-living plants) of _Equisetum_, the botanical name of\r\nHorsetail and Scouring Rush. They have hollow stems, with partitions at\r\nthe nodes; the leaves consist only of a whorl of scales at each node,\r\nthese coalescent into a sheath: from the axils of these leaf-scales, in\r\nmany species, branches grow out, which are similar to the stem but on a\r\nmuch smaller scale, close-jointed, and with the tips of the leaves more\r\napparent. At the apex of the stem appears the _fructification_, as it is\r\ncalled for lack of a better term, in the form of a short spike or head.\r\nThis consists of a good number of stalked shields, bearing on their\r\ninner or under face several wedge-shaped spore-cases. The spore-cases\r\nwhen they ripen open down the inner side and discharge a great number\r\nof green spores of a size large enough to be well seen by a hand-glass.\r\nThe spores are aided in their discharge and dissemination by four\r\nclub-shaped threads attached to one part of them. These are hygrometric:\r\nwhen moist they are rolled up over the spore; when dry they straighten,\r\nand exhibit lively movements, closing over the spore when breathed upon,\r\nand unrolling promptly a moment after as they dry. (See Fig. 493-498.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 493. Upper part of a stem of a Horsetail, Equisetum\r\nsylvaticum. 494.

A section of the trunk of a Tree-Fern.]\r\n\r\n486. =Ferns, or Filices=, a most attractive family of plants, are very\r\nnumerous and varied. In warm and equable climates some rise into\r\nforest-trees, with habit of Palms; but most of them are perennial herbs.\r\nThe wood of a Fern-trunk is very different, however, from that of a\r\npalm, or of any exogenous stem either. A section is represented in Fig.\r\n500. The curved plates of wood each terminate upward in a leaf-stalk.\r\nThe subterranean trunk or stem of any strong-growing herbaceous Fern\r\nshows a similar structure. Most Ferns are circinate in the bud; that is,\r\nare rolled up in the manner shown in Fig. 197. Uncoiling as they grow,\r\nthey have some likeness to a crosier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 501. The Walking-Fern, Camptosorus, reduced in size,\r\nshowing its fruit-dots on the veins approximated in pairs. 502.

The fructification of Ferns is borne on the back or under side of\r\nthe leaves. The early botanists thought this such a peculiarity that\r\nthey always called a Fern-leaf a FROND, and its petiole a STIPE. Usage\r\ncontinues these terms, although they are superfluous. The fruit of Ferns\r\nconsists of SPORE-CASES, technically SPORANGIA, which grow out of the\r\nveins of the leaf. Sometimes these are distributed over the whole lower\r\nsurface of the leaf or frond, or over the whole surface when there are\r\nno proper leaf-blades to the frond, but all is reduced to stalks.\r\nCommonly the spore-cases occupy only detached spots or lines, each of\r\nwhich is called a SORUS, or in English merely a Fruit-dot. In many Ferns\r\nthese fruit-dots are naked; in others they are produced under a\r\nscale-like bit of membrane, called an INDUSIUM. In Maidenhair-Ferns a\r\nlittle lobe of the leaf is folded back over each fruit-dot, to serve as\r\nits shield or indusium. In the true Brake or Bracken (Pteris) the whole\r\nedge of the fruit-bearing part of the leaf is folded back over it like a\r\nhem.\r\n\r\n488. The form and structure of the spore-cases can be made out with a\r\ncommon hand magnifying glass. The commonest kind (shown in Fig. 503) has\r\na stalk formed of a row of jointed cells, and is itself composed of a\r\nlayer of thin-walled cells, but is incompletely surrounded by a border\r\nof thicker-walled cells, forming the RING. This extends from the stalk\r\nup one side of the spore-case, round its summit, descends on the other\r\nside, but there gradually vanishes. In ripening and drying the shrinking\r\nof the cells of the ring on the outer side causes it to straighten; in\r\ndoing so it tears the spore-case open on the weaker side and discharges\r\nthe minute spores that fill it, commonly with a jerk which scatters them\r\nto the wind. Another kind of spore-case (Fig. 507) is stalkless, and has\r\nits ring-cells forming a kind of cap at the top: at maturity it splits\r\nfrom top to bottom by a regular dehiscence. A third kind is of firm\r\ntexture and opens across into two valves, like a clam-shell (Fig. 508a):\r\nthis kind makes an approach to the next family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 509. A young prothallus of a Maiden-hair, moderately\r\nenlarged, and an older one with the first fern-leaf developed from near\r\nthe notch. 510. Middle portion of the young one, much magnified, showing\r\nbelow, partly among the rootlets, the _antheridia_ or fertilizing\r\norgans, and above, near the notch, three _pistillidia_ to be\r\nfertilized.]\r\n\r\n489. The spores germinate on moistened ground. In a conservatory they\r\nmay be found germinating on a damp wall or on the edges of a\r\nwell-watered flower-pot. Instead of directly forming a fern-plantlet,\r\nthe spore grows first into a body which closely resembles a small\r\nLiverwort. This is named a PROTHALLUS (Fig. 509): from some point of\r\nthis a bud appears to originate, which produces the first fern-leaf,\r\nsoon followed by a second and third, and so the stem and leaves of the\r\nplant are set up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 511. Lycopodium Carolinianum, of nearly natural\r\nsize. 512. Inside view of one of the bracts and spore-case, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 513.

Section of a spore-case containing macrospores, equally\r\nmagnified; at the right three macrospores more magnified.]\r\n\r\n490. Investigation of this prothallus under the microscope resulted in\r\nthe discovery of a wholly unsuspected kind of fertilization, taking\r\nplace at this germinating stage of the plant. On the under side of the\r\nprothallus two kinds of organs appear (Fig. 510). One may be likened to\r\nan open and depressed ovule, with a single cell at bottom answering to\r\nnucleus; the other, to an anther; but instead of pollen, it discharges\r\ncorkscrew-shaped microscopic filaments, which bear some cilia of extreme\r\ntenuity, by the rapid vibration of which the filaments move freely over\r\na wet surface. These filaments travel over the surface of the\r\nprothallus, and even to other prothalli (for there are natural hybrid\r\nFerns), reach and enter the ovule-like cavities, and fertilize the\r\ncell. This thereupon sets up a growth, forms a vegetable bud, and so\r\ndevelops the new plant.\r\n\r\n491. An essentially similar process of fertilization has been discovered\r\nin the preceding and the following families of Pteridophytes; but it is\r\nmostly subterranean and very difficult to observe.\r\n\r\n492. =Club-Mosses or Lycopodiums.= Some of the common kinds, called\r\nGround Pine, are familiar, being largely used for Christmas wreaths and\r\nother decoration. They are low evergreens, some creeping, all with\r\nconsiderable wood in their stems: this thickly beset with small leaves.\r\nIn the axils of some of these leaves, or more commonly, in the axils of\r\npeculiar leaves changed into bracts (as in Fig. 511, 512) spore-cases\r\nappear, as roundish or kidney-shaped bodies, of firm texture, opening\r\nround the top into two valves, and discharging a great quantity of a\r\nvery fine yellow powder, the spores.\r\n\r\n493. The Selaginellas have been separated from Lycopodium, which they\r\nmuch resemble, because they produce two kinds of spores, in separate\r\nspore-cases. One kind (MICROSPORES) is just that of Lycopodium; the\r\nother consists of only four large spores (MACROSPORES), in a spore-case\r\nwhich usually breaks in pieces at maturity (Fig. 513-515).\r\n\r\n494. =The Quillworts, Isoetes= (Fig. 516-519), are very unlike Club\r\nMosses in aspect, but have been associated with them. They look more\r\nlike Rushes, and live in water, or partly out of it. A very short stem,\r\nlike a corm, bears a cluster of roots underneath; above it is covered by\r\nthe broad bases of a cluster of awl-shaped or thread-shaped leaves. The\r\nspore-cases are immersed in the bases of the leaves. The outer\r\nleaf-bases contain numerous macrospores; the inner are filled with\r\ninnumerable microspores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 520. Plant of Marsilia quadrifoliata, reduced in\r\nsize; at the right a pair of sporocarps of about natural size.]\r\n\r\n495. =The Pillworts= (_Marsilia_ and _Pilularia_) are low aquatics,\r\nwhich bear globular or pill-shaped fruit (SPOROCARPS) on the lower part\r\nof their leaf-stalks or on their slender creeping stems. The leaves of\r\nthe commoner species of Marsilia might be taken for four-leaved Clover.\r\n(See Fig. 520.) The sporocarps are usually raised on a short stalk.\r\nWithin they are divided lengthwise by a partition, and then crosswise by\r\nseveral partitions. These partitions bear numerous delicate sacs or\r\nspore-cases of two kinds, intermixed. The larger ones contain each a\r\nlarge spore, or macrospore; the smaller contain numerous microspores,\r\nimmersed in mucilage. At maturity the fruit bursts or splits open at\r\ntop, and the two kinds of spores are discharged. The large ones in\r\ngermination produce a small prothallus; upon which the contents of the\r\nmicrospores act in the same way as in Ferns, and with a similar result.\r\n\r\n496. =Azolla= is a little floating plant, looking like a small Liverwort\r\nor Moss. Its branches are covered with minute and scale-shaped leaves.\r\nOn the under side of the branches are found egg-shaped thin-walled\r\nsporocarps of two kinds. The small ones open across and discharge\r\nmicrospores; the larger burst irregularly, and bring to view globose\r\nspore-cases, attached to the bottom of the sporocarp by a slender stalk.\r\nThese delicate spore-cases burst and set free about four macrospores,\r\nwhich are fertilized at germination, in the manner of the Pillworts and\r\nQuillworts. (See Fig. 521-526.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 521. Small plant of Azolla Caroliniana. 522.

Many of the lower kinds are mere plates, or ribbons, or\r\nsimple rows of cells, or even single cells. But their highest orders\r\nfollow the plan of Ferns and phanerogamous plants in having stem and\r\nleaves for their upward growth, and commonly roots, or at least\r\nrootlets, to attach them to the soil, or to trunks, or to other bodies\r\non which they grow. Plants of this grade are chiefly Mosses. So as a\r\nwhole they take the name of\r\n\r\n498. =Bryophyta, Bryophytes= in English form, Bryum being the Greek name\r\nof a Moss. These plants are of two principal kinds: true Mosses\r\n(_Musci_, which is their Latin name in the plural); and Hepatic Mosses,\r\nor Liverworts (_Hepaticae_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 527. Single plant of Physcomitrium pyriforme,\r\nmagnified. 528. Top of a leaf, cut across; it consists of a single layer\r\nof cells.]\r\n\r\n499. =Mosses or Musci.= The pale Peat-mosses (species of Sphagnum, the\r\nprincipal component of sphagnous bogs) and the strong-growing Hair-cap\r\nMoss (Polytrichum) are among the larger and commoner representatives of\r\nthis numerous family; while Fountain Moss (Fontinalis) in running water\r\nsometimes attains the length of a yard or more. On the other hand, some\r\nare barely individually distinguishable to the naked eye. Fig. 527\r\nrepresents a common little Moss, enlarged to about twelve times its\r\nnatural size; and by its side is part of a leaf, much magnified, showing\r\nthat it is composed of cellular tissue (parenchyma-cells) only. The\r\nleaves of Mosses are always simple, distinct, and sessile on the stem.\r\nThe fructification is an urn-shaped spore-case, in this as in most cases\r\nraised on a slender stalk. The spore-case loosely bears on its summit a\r\nthin and pointed cap, like a candle-extinguisher, called a _Calyptra_.\r\nDetaching this, it is found that the spore-case is like a pyxis (376),\r\nthat is, the top at maturity comes off as a lid (_Operculum_); and that\r\nthe interior is filled with a green powder, the spores, which are\r\ndischarged through the open mouth. In most Mosses there is a fringe of\r\none or two rows of teeth or membrane around this mouth or orifice, the\r\n_Peristome_. When moist the peristome closes hygrometrically over the\r\norifice more or less; when drier the teeth or processes commonly bend\r\noutward or recurve; and then the spores more readily escape. In Hair-cap\r\nMoss a membrane is stretched quite across the mouth, like a drum-head,\r\nretaining the spores until this wears away. See Figures 527-541 for\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n500. Fertilization in Mosses is by the analogues of stamens and pistils,\r\nwhich are hidden in the axils of leaves, or in the cluster of leaves at\r\nthe end of the stem. The analogue of the anther (_Antheridium_) is a\r\ncellular sac, which in bursting discharges innumerable delicate cells\r\nfloating in a mucilaginous liquid; each of these bursts and sets free a\r\nvibratile self-moving thread. These threads, one or more, reach the\r\norifice of the pistil-shaped body, the _Pistillidium_, and act upon a\r\nparticular cell at its base within. This cell in its growth develops\r\ninto the spore-case and its stalk (when there is any), carrying on its\r\nsummit the wall of the pistillidium, which becomes the calyptra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 529.

Those of\r\nthe moss-like kind (sometimes called Scale-Mosses) have their tender\r\nspore-cases splitting into four valves; and with their spores are\r\nintermixed some slender spiral and very hygrometric threads (called\r\n_Elaters_) which are thought to aid in the dispersion of the spores.\r\n(Fig. 542-544.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 542. Fructification of a Jungermannia, magnified;\r\nits cellular spore-stalk, surrounded at base by some of the leaves, at\r\nsummit the 4-valved spore-case opening, discharging spores and elaters.\r\n543.

One of the frondose Liverworts, Steetzia,\r\notherwise like a Jungermannia; the spore-case not yet protruded from its\r\nsheath.]\r\n\r\n502. Marchantia, the commonest and largest of the true Liverworts, forms\r\nlarge green plates or fronds on damp and shady ground, and sends up from\r\nsome part of the upper face a stout stalk, ending in a several-lobed\r\numbrella-shaped body, under the lobes of which hang several thin-walled\r\nspore-cases, which burst open and discharge spores and elaters. Riccia\r\nnatans (Fig. 545) consists of wedge-shaped or heart-shaped fronds, which\r\nfloat free in pools of still water. The under face bears copious\r\nrootlets; in the substance of the upper face are the spore-cases, their\r\npointed tips merely projecting: there they burst open, and discharge\r\ntheir spores. These are comparatively few and large, and are in fours;\r\nso they are very like the macrospores of Pillworts or Quillworts.\r\n\r\n503. =Thallophyta, or Thallophytes= in English form. This is the name\r\nfor the lower class of Cellular Cryptogams,--plants in which there is no\r\nmarked distinction into root, stem, and leaves. Roots in any proper\r\nsense they never have, as organs for absorbing, although some of the\r\nlarger Seaweeds (such as the Sea Colander, Fig. 553) have them as\r\nholdfasts. Instead of axis and foliage, there is a stratum of frond, in\r\nsuch plants commonly called a THALLUS (by a strained use of a Greek and\r\nLatin word which means a green shoot or bough), which may have any kind\r\nof form, leaf-like, stem-like, branchy, extended to a flat plate, or\r\ngathered into a sphere, or drawn out into threads, or reduced to a\r\nsingle row of cells, or even reduced to single cells. Indeed,\r\nThallophytes are so multifarious, so numerous in kinds, so protean in\r\ntheir stages and transformations, so recondite in their fructification,\r\nand many so microscopic in size, either of the plant itself or its\r\nessential organs, that they have to be elaborately described in separate\r\nbooks and made subjects of special study.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 545, 546. Two plants of Riccia natans, about natural\r\nsize. 547. Magnified section of a part of the frond, showing two\r\nimmersed spore-cases, and one emptied space. 548.

Nevertheless, it may be well to try to give some general idea of\r\nwhat Algae and Lichens and Fungi are. Linnaeus had them all under the\r\norders of Algae and Fungi. Afterwards the Lichens were separated; but of\r\nlate it has been made most probable that a Lichen consists of an Alga\r\nand a Fungus conjoined. At least it must be so in some of the ambiguous\r\nforms. Botanists are in the way of bringing out new classifications of\r\nthe Thallophytes, as they come to understand their structure and\r\nrelations better. Here, it need only be said that\r\n\r\n505. Lichens live in the air, that is, on the ground, or on rocks,\r\ntrunks, walls, and the like, and grow when moistened by rains. They\r\nassimilate air, water, and some earthy matter, just as do ordinary\r\nplants. Algae, or Seaweeds, live in water, and live the same kind of life\r\nas do ordinary plants. Fungi, whatever medium they inhabit, live as\r\nanimals do, upon organic matter,--upon what other plants have\r\nassimilated, or upon the products of their decay. True as these general\r\ndistinctions are, it is no less true that these orders run together in\r\ntheir lowest forms; and that Algae and Fungi may be traced down into\r\nforms so low and simple that no clear line can be drawn between them;\r\nand even into forms of which it is uncertain whether they should be\r\ncalled plants or animals. It is as well to say that they are not high\r\nenough in rank to be distinctively either the one or the other. On the\r\nother hand there is a peculiar group of plants, which in simplicity of\r\ncomposition resemble the simpler Algae, while in fructification and in\r\nthe arrangements of their simple cells into stem and branches they seem\r\nto be of a higher order, viz.:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 550. Branch of a Chara, about natural size. 551. A\r\nfruiting portion, magnified, showing the structure; a sporocarp, and an\r\nantheridium. 552. Outlines of a portion of the stem in section, showing\r\nthe central cell and the outer or cortical cells.]\r\n\r\n506. =Characeae.= These are aquatic herbs, of considerable size,\r\nabounding in ponds. The simpler kinds (Nitella) have the stem formed of\r\na single row of tubular cells, and at the nodes, or junction of the\r\ncells, a whorl of similar branches. Chara (Fig. 550-552) is the same,\r\nexcept that the cells which make up the stem and the principal branches\r\nare strengthened by a coating of many smaller tubular cells, applied to\r\nthe surface of the main or central cell. The fructification consists of\r\na globular sporocarp of considerable size, which is spirally enwrapped\r\nby tubular cells twisted around it: by the side of this is a smaller and\r\nglobular antheridium. The latter breaks up into eight shield-shaped\r\npieces, with an internal stalk, and bearing long and ribbon shaped\r\nfilaments, which consist of a row of delicate cells, each of which\r\ndischarges a free-moving microscopic thread (the analogue of the pollen\r\nor pollen-tube), nearly in the manner of Ferns and Mosses. One of these\r\nthreads reaches and fertilizes a cell at the apex of the nucleus or\r\nsolid body of the sporocarp. This subsequently germinates and forms a\r\nnew individual.\r\n\r\n507. =Algae or Seaweeds.= The proper Seaweeds may be studied by the aid\r\nof Professor Farlow's \"Marine Algae of New England;\" the fresh-water\r\nspecies, by Prof. H. C. Woods's \"Fresh-water Algae of North America,\" a\r\nlarger and less accessible volume. A few common forms are here very\r\nbriefly mentioned and illustrated, to give an idea of the family. But\r\nthey are of almost endless diversity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 553. Agarum Turneri, Sea Colander (so called from\r\nthe perforations with which the frond, as it grows, becomes riddled);\r\nvery much reduced in size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 554. Upper end of a Rockweed, Fucus vesiculosus,\r\nreduced half or more, _b_, the fructification.]\r\n\r\n508. The common Rockweed (Fucus vesiculosus, Fig. 554, abounding between\r\nhigh and low water mark on the coast), the rarer Sea Colander (Agarum\r\nTurneri, Fig. 553), and Laminaria, of which the larger forms are called\r\nDevil's Aprons, are good representatives of the olive green or brownish\r\nSeaweeds. They are attached either by a disk-like base or by root-like\r\nholdfasts to the rocks or stones on which they grow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 555. Magnified section through a fertile conceptacle\r\nof Rockweed, showing the large spores in the midst of threads of cells.\r\n556. Similar section of a sterile conceptacle, containing slender\r\nantheridia. From Farlow's \"Marine Algae of New England.\"]\r\n\r\n509. The hollow and inflated places in the Fucus vesiculosus or Rockweed\r\n(Fig. 554) are air-bladders for buoyancy. The fructification forms in\r\nthe substance of the tips of the frond: the rough dots mark the places\r\nwhere the conceptacles open. The spores and the fertilizing cells are in\r\ndifferent plants. Sections of the two kinds of conceptacles are given in\r\nFig. 555 and 556. The contents of the conceptacles are discharged\r\nthrough a small orifice which in each figure is at the margin of the\r\npage. The large spores are formed eight together in a mother-cell. The\r\nminute motile filaments of the antheridia fertilize the large spores\r\nafter injection into the water: and then the latter promptly acquire a\r\ncell-wall and germinate.\r\n\r\n510. The Florideae or Rose-red series of marine Algae (which, however, are\r\nsometimes green or brownish) are the most attractive to amateurs. The\r\ndelicate Porphyra or Laver is in some countries eaten as a delicacy, and\r\nthe cartilaginous Chondrus crispus has been largely used for jelly.\r\nBesides their conceptacles, which contain true spores (Fig. 560), they\r\nmostly have a fructification in _Tetraspores_, that is, of spores\r\noriginating in fours (Fig. 559).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 557. Small plant of Chondrus crispus, or Carrageen\r\nMoss, reduced in size, in fruit; the spots represent the fructification,\r\nconsisting of numerous tetraspores in bunches in the substance of the\r\nplant. 558.

A few of the cells more\r\nhighly magnified: the cells are gelatinous and thick-walled.]\r\n\r\n511. The Grass-green Algae sometimes form broad membranous fronds, such\r\nas those of the common Ulva of the sea-shore, but most of them form mere\r\nthreads, either simple or branched. To this division belong almost all\r\nthe Fresh-water Algae, such as those which constitute the silky threads\r\nor green slime of running streams or standing pools, and which were all\r\ncalled Confervas before their immense diversity was known. Some are\r\nformed of a single row of cells, developed each from the end of another.\r\nOthers branch, the top of one cell producing more than one new one (Fig.\r\n564). Others, of a kind which is very common in fresh water, simple\r\nthreads made of a line of cells, have the chlorophyll and protoplasm of\r\neach cell arranged in spiral lines or bands. They form spores in a\r\npeculiar way, which gives to this family the designation of conjugating\r\nAlgae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 564. The growing end of a branching Conferva\r\n(Cladophora glomerata), much magnified; showing how, by a kind of\r\nbudding growth, a new cell is formed by a cross partition separating the\r\nnewer tip from the older part below; also, how the branches arise.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 565. Two magnified individuals of a Spirogyra,\r\nforming spores by conjugation; a completed spore at base: above,\r\nsuccessive stages of the conjugation are represented.]\r\n\r\n512. At a certain time two parallel threads approach each other more\r\nclosely; contiguous parts of a cell of each thread bulge or grow out,\r\nand unite when they meet; the cell-wall partitions between them are\r\nabsorbed so as to open a free communication; the spiral band of green\r\nmatter in both cells breaks up; the whole of that of one cell passes\r\nover into the other; and of the united contents a large green spore is\r\nformed. Soon the old cells decay, and the spore set free is ready to\r\ngerminate. Fig. 565 represents several stages of the conjugating\r\nprocess, which, however, would never be found all together like this in\r\none pair of threads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 566. Closterium acutum, a common Desmid, moderately\r\nmagnified. It is a single firm-walled cell, filled with green\r\nprotoplasmic matter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 567. More magnified view of three stages of the\r\nconjugation of a pair of the same.]\r\n\r\n513. Desmids and Diatomes, which are microscopic one-celled plants of\r\nthe same class, conjugate in the same way, as is shown in a Closterium\r\nby Fig. 566, 567. Here the whole living contents of two individuals are\r\nincorporated into one spore, for a fresh start. A reproduction which\r\ncosts the life of two individuals to make a single new one would be\r\nfatal to the species if there were not a provision for multiplication by\r\nthe prompt division of the new-formed individual into two, and these\r\nagain into two, and so on in geometrical ratio. And the costly process\r\nwould be meaningless if there were not some real advantage in such a\r\nfresh start, that is, in sexes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 568.

There are other Algae of the grass-green series which consist of\r\nsingle cells, but which by continued growth form plants of considerable\r\nsize. Three kinds of these are represented in Fig. 568-574.\r\n\r\n515. =Lichens=, Latin _Lichenes_, are to be studied in the works of the\r\nlate Professor Tuckerman, but a popular exposition is greatly needed.\r\nThe subjoined illustrations (Fig. 575-580) may simply indicate what some\r\nof the commoner forms are like. The cup, or shield-shaped spot, or knob,\r\nwhich bears the fructification is named the _Apothecium_. This is mainly\r\ncomposed of slender sacs (_Asci_), having thread-shaped cells\r\nintermixed; and each ascus contains few or several spores, which are\r\ncommonly double or treble. Most Lichens are flat expansions of grayish\r\nhue; some of them foliaceous in texture, but never of bright green\r\ncolor; more are crustaceous; some are wholly pulverulent and nearly\r\nformless. But in several the vegetation lengthens into an axis (as in\r\nFig. 580), or imitates stem and branches or threads, as in the\r\nReindeer-Moss on the ground in our northern woods, and the Usnea hanging\r\nfrom the boughs of old trees overhead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 575. A stone on which various Lichens are growing,\r\nsuch as (passing from left to right) a Parmelia, a Sticta, and on the\r\nright, Lecidia geographica, so called from its patches resembling the\r\noutline of islands or continents as depicted upon maps. 576.

The true vegetation of common Fungi consists of\r\nslender cells which form what is called a _Mycelium_. These filamentous\r\ncells lengthen and branch, growing by the absorption through their\r\nwhole surface of the decaying, or organizable, or living matter which\r\nthey feed upon. In a Mushroom (Agaricus), a knobby mass is at length\r\nformed, which develops into a stout stalk (_Stipe_), bearing the cap\r\n(_Pileus_): the under side of the cap is covered by the _Hymenium_, in\r\nthis genus consisting of radiating plates, the gills or _Lamellae_; and\r\nthese bear the powdery spores in immense numbers. Under the microscope,\r\nthe gills are found to be studded with projecting cells, each of which,\r\nat the top, produces four stalked spores. These form the powder which\r\ncollects on a sheet of paper upon which a mature Mushroom is allowed to\r\nrest for a day or two. (Fig. 581-586.)\r\n\r\n517. The esculent Morel, also Sphaeria (Fig. 585, 586), and many other\r\nFungi bear their spores in sacs (asci) exactly in the manner of Lichens\r\n(515).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 581. Agaricus campestris, the common edible\r\nMushroom. 582. Section of cap and stalk. 583. Minute portion of a\r\nsection of a gill, showing some spore-bearing cells, much magnified.\r\n584.

Two of the asci and\r\ncontained double spores, quite like those of a Lichen; much magnified.]\r\n\r\n518. Of the Moulds, one of the commoner is the Bread-Mould (Fig. 587).\r\nIn fruiting it sends up a slender stalk, which bears a globular sac;\r\nthis bursts at maturity and discharges innumerable spores. The blue\r\nCheese-Mould (Fig. 588) bears a cluster of branches at top, each of\r\nwhich is a row of naked spores, like a string of beads, all breaking\r\napart at maturity. Botrytis (Fig. 589), the fruiting stalk of which\r\nbranches, and each branch is tipped with a spore, is one of the many\r\nmoulds which live and feed upon the juices of other plants or of\r\nanimals, and are often very destructive. The extremely numerous kinds of\r\nsmut, rust, mildew, the ferments, bacteria, and the like, many of them\r\nvery destructive to other vegetable and to animal life, are also low\r\nforms of the class of Fungi.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 587.

CLASSIFICATION AND NOMENCLATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n519. Classification, in botany, is the consideration of plants in\r\nrespect to their kinds and relationships. Some system of Nomenclature,\r\nor naming, is necessary for fixing and expressing botanical knowledge so\r\nas to make it available. The vast multiplicity of plants and the various\r\ndegrees of their relationship imperatively require order and system, not\r\nonly as to _names_ for designating the kinds of plants, but also as to\r\n_terms_ for defining their differences. Nomenclature is concerned with\r\nthe names of plants. Terminology supplies names of organs or parts, and\r\nterms to designate their differences.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. KINDS AND RELATIONSHIP.\r\n\r\n520. Plants and animals have two great peculiarities: 1st, they form\r\nthemselves; and 2d, they multiply themselves. They reproduce their kind\r\nin a continued succession of\r\n\r\n521. =Individuals.= Mineral things occur as _masses_, which are\r\ndivisible into smaller and still smaller ones without alteration of\r\nproperties. But organic things (vegetables and animals) exist as\r\n_individual beings_. Each owes its existence to a parent, and produces\r\nsimilar individuals in its turn. So each individual is a link of a\r\nchain; and to this chain the natural-historian applies the name of\r\n\r\n522. =Species.= All the descendants from the same stock therefore\r\ncompose one species. And it was from our observing that the several\r\nsorts of plants or animals steadily reproduce themselves, or, in other\r\nwords, keep up a succession of similar individuals, that the idea of\r\nspecies originated. There are few species, however, in which man has\r\nactually observed the succession for many generations. It could seldom\r\nbe proved that all the White Pine trees or White Oaks of any forest came\r\nfrom the same stock. But observation having familiarized us with the\r\ngeneral fact that individuals proceeding from the same stock are\r\nessentially alike, we infer from their close resemblance that these\r\nsimilar individuals belong to the same species. That is, we infer it\r\nwhen the individuals are as much like each other as those are which we\r\nknow, or confidently suppose, to have sprung from the same stock.\r\n\r\n523. Identity in species is inferred from close similarity in all\r\nessential respects, or whenever the differences, however considerable,\r\nare not known or reasonably supposed to have been originated in the\r\ncourse of time under changed conditions. No two individuals are exactly\r\nalike; a tendency to variation pervades all living things. In\r\ncultivation, where variations are looked after and cared for, very\r\nstriking differences come to light; and if in wild nature they are less\r\ncommon or less conspicuous, it is partly because they are uncared for.\r\nWhen such variant forms are pretty well marked they are called\r\n\r\n524. =Varieties.= The White Oak, for example, presents two or three\r\nvarieties in the shape of the leaves, although they may be all alike\r\nupon each particular tree. The question often arises, and it is often\r\nhard to answer, whether the difference in a particular case is that of a\r\nvariety, or is specific. If the former, it may commonly be proved by\r\nfinding such intermediate degrees of difference in various individuals\r\nas to show that no clear distinction can be drawn between them; or else\r\nby observing the variety to vary back again in some of its offspring.\r\nThe sorts of Apples, Pears, Potatoes, and the like, show that\r\ndifferences which are permanent in the individual, and continue\r\nunchanged through a long series of generations when propagated by\r\ndivision (as by offsets, cuttings, grafts, bulbs, tubers, etc.), are not\r\nlikely to be reproduced by seed. Still they sometimes are so, and\r\nperhaps always tend in that direction. For the fundamental law in\r\norganic nature is that offspring shall be like parent.\r\n\r\nRACES are such strongly marked varieties, capable of coming true to\r\nseed. The different sorts of Wheat, Maize, Peas, Radishes, etc., are\r\nfamiliar examples. By selecting those individuals of a species which\r\nhave developed or inherited any desirable peculiarity, keeping them from\r\nmingling with their less promising brethren, and selecting again the\r\nmost promising plants raised from their seeds, the cultivator may in a\r\nfew generations render almost any variety transmissible by seed, so long\r\nas it is cared for and kept apart. In fact, this is the way the\r\ncultivated domesticated races, so useful to man, have been fixed and\r\npreserved. Races, in fact, can hardly, if at all, be said to exist\r\nindependently of man. But man does not really produce them. Such\r\npeculiarities--often surprising enough--now and then originate, we know\r\nnot how (the plant _sports_, as the gardeners say); they are only\r\npreserved, propagated, and generally further developed, by the\r\ncultivator's skilful care. If left alone, they are likely to dwindle and\r\nperish, or else revert to the original form of the species. Vegetable\r\nraces are commonly annuals, which can be kept up only by seed, or herbs\r\nof which a succession of generations can be had every year or two, and\r\nso the education by selection be completed without great lapse of time.\r\nBut all fruit-trees could probably be fixed into races in an equal\r\nnumber of generations.\r\n\r\nBUD-VARIETIES are those which spring from buds instead of seed. They are\r\nuncommon to any marked extent. They are sometimes called _Sports_, but\r\nthis name is equally applied to variations among seedlings.\r\n\r\nCROSS-BREEDS, strictly so-called, are the variations which come from\r\ncross-fertilizing one variety of a species with another.\r\n\r\nHYBRIDS are the varieties, if they may be so called,--which come from\r\nthe crossing of species (331). Only nearly related species can be\r\nhybridized; and the resulting progeny is usually self-sterile, but not\r\nalways. Hybrid plants, however, may often be fertilized and made\r\nprolific by the pollen of one or the other parent. This produces another\r\nkind of cross-breeds.\r\n\r\n525. Species are the units in classification. Varieties, although of\r\nutmost importance in cultivation and of considerable consequence in the\r\nflora of any country, are of less botanical significance. For they are\r\napt to be indefinite and to shade off one form into another. But\r\nspecies, the botanist _expects_ to be distinct. Indeed, the practical\r\ndifference to the botanist between species and varieties is the definite\r\nlimitation of the one and the indefiniteness of the other. The\r\nbotanist's determination is partly a matter of observation, partly of\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n526. In an enlarged view, varieties may be incipient species; and nearly\r\nrelated species probably came from a common stock in earlier times. For\r\nthere is every reason to believe that existing vegetation came from the\r\nmore or less changed vegetation of a preceding geological era. However\r\nthat may be, species are regarded as permanent and essentially unchanged\r\nin their succession of individuals through the actual ages.\r\n\r\n527. There are, at nearly the lowest computation, as many as one hundred\r\nthousand species of phanerogamous plants, and the cryptogamous species\r\nare thought to be still more numerous. They are all connected by\r\nresemblances or relationships, near and remote, which show that they are\r\nall parts of one system, realizations in nature, as we may affirm, of\r\nthe conception of One Mind. As we survey them, they do not form a single\r\nand connected chain, stretching from the lowest to the highest organized\r\nspecies, although there obviously are lower and higher grades. But the\r\nspecies throughout group themselves, as it were, into clusters or\r\nconstellations, and these into still more comprehensive clusters, and so\r\non, with gaps between. It is this clustering which is the ground of the\r\nrecognition of _kinds_ of species, that is, of groups of species of\r\nsuccessive grades or degree of generality; such as that of similar\r\nspecies into _Genera_, of genera into _Families_ or _Orders_, of orders\r\ninto _Classes_. In classification the sequence, proceeding from higher\r\nor more general to lower or special, is always CLASS, ORDER, GENUS,\r\nSPECIES, VARIETY (if need be).\r\n\r\n528. =Genera= (in the singular, _Genus_) are assemblages of closely\r\nrelated species, in which the essential parts are all constructed on the\r\nsame particular type or plan. White Oak, Red Oak, Scarlet Oak, Live Oak,\r\netc., are so many species of the Oak genus (Latin, _Quercus_). The\r\nChestnuts compose another genus; the Beeches another. The Apple, Pear,\r\nand Crab are species of one genus, the Quince represents another, the\r\nvarious species of Hawthorn a third. In the animal kingdom the common\r\ncat, the wild-cat, the panther, the tiger, the leopard, and the lion are\r\nspecies of the cat kind or genus; while the dog, the jackal, the\r\ndifferent species of wolf, and the foxes, compose another genus. Some\r\ngenera are represented by a vast number of species, others by few, very\r\nmany by only one known species. For the genus may be as perfectly\r\nrepresented in one species as in several, although, if this were the\r\ncase throughout, genera and species would of course be identical. The\r\nBeech genus and the Chestnut genus would be just as distinct from the\r\nOak genus even if but one Beech and Chestnut were known; as indeed was\r\nonce the case.\r\n\r\n529. =Orders= are groups of genera that resemble each other; that is,\r\nthey are to genera what genera are to species. As familiar\r\nillustrations, the Oak, Chestnut, and Beech genera, along with the Hazel\r\ngenus and the Hornbeams, all belong to one order. The Birches and the\r\nAlders make another; the Poplars and Willows, another; the Walnuts (with\r\nthe Butternut) and the Hickories, still another. The Apple genus, the\r\nQuince and the Hawthorns, along with the Plums and Cherries and the\r\nPeach, the Raspberry with the Blackberry, the Strawberry, the Rose,\r\nbelong to a large order, which takes its name from the Rose. Most\r\nbotanists use the names \"Order\" and \"Family\" synonymously; the latter\r\nmore popularly, as \"the Rose Family,\" the former more technically, as\r\n\"Order _Rosaceae_.\"\r\n\r\n530. But when the two are distinguished, as is common in zoology, Family\r\nis of lower grade than Order.\r\n\r\n531. =Classes= are still more comprehensive assemblages, or great\r\ngroups. Thus, in modern botany, the Dicotyledonous plants compose one\r\nclass, the Monocotyledonous plants another (36-40).\r\n\r\n532. These four grades, Class, Order, Genus, Species, are of universal\r\nuse. Variety comes in upon occasion. For, although a species may have no\r\nrecognized varieties, a genus implies at least one species belonging to\r\nit; every genus is of some order, and every order of some class.\r\n\r\n533. But these grades by no means exhaust the resources of\r\nclassification, nor suffice for the elucidation of all the distinctions\r\nwhich botanists recognize. In the first place, a higher grade than that\r\nof class is needful for the most comprehensive of divisions, that of all\r\nplants into the two _Series_ of Phanerogamous and Cryptogamous (6); and\r\nin natural history there are the two _Kingdoms_ or _Realms_, the\r\nVegetable and the Animal.\r\n\r\n534. Moreover, the stages of the scaffolding have been variously\r\nextended, as required, by the recognition of assemblages lower than\r\nclass but higher than order, viz. _Subclass_ and _Cohort_; or lower than\r\norder, a _Suborder_; or between this and genus, a _Tribe_; or between\r\nthis and tribe, a _Subtribe_; or between genus and species, a\r\n_Subgenus_; and by some a species has been divided into _Subspecies_,\r\nand a variety into _Subvarieties_. Last of all are _Individuals_.\r\nSuffice it to remember that the following are the principal grades in\r\nclassification, with the proper sequence; also that only those here\r\nprinted in small capitals are fundamental and universal in botany:--\r\n\r\n  SERIES,\r\n      CLASS, Subclass, Cohort,\r\n          ORDER, or FAMILY, Suborder, Tribe, Subtribe,\r\n              GENUS, Subgenus or Section,\r\n                  SPECIES, Variety.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. NAMES, TERMS, AND CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\n535. The name of a plant is the name of its genus followed by that of\r\nthe species. The name of the genus answers to the surname (or family\r\nname); that of the species to the baptismal name of a person. Thus\r\n_Quercus_ is the name of the Oak genus; _Quercus alba_, that of the\r\nWhite Oak, _Q. rubra_, that of Red Oak, _Q. nigra_, that of the\r\nBlack-Jack, etc. Botanical names being Latin or Latinized, the adjective\r\nname of the species comes after that of the genus.\r\n\r\n536. =Names of Genera= are of one word, a substantive. The older ones\r\nare mostly classical Latin, or Greek adopted into Latin; such as\r\n_Quercus_ for the Oak genus, _Fagus_ for the Beech, _Corylus_, the\r\nHazel, and the like. But as more genera became known, botanists had new\r\nnames to make or borrow. Many are named from some appearance or property\r\nof the flowers, leaves, or other parts of the plant. To take a few\r\nexamples from the early pages of the \"Manual of the Botany of the\r\nNorthern United States,\"--the genus _Hepatica_ comes from the shape of\r\nthe leaf, resembling that of the liver. _Myosurus_ means mouse-tail.\r\n_Delphinium_ is from delphin, a dolphin, and alludes to the shape of the\r\nflower, which was thought to resemble the classical figures of the\r\ndolphin. _Xanthorrhiza_ is from two Greek words meaning yellow-root, the\r\ncommon name of the plant. _Cimicifuga_ is formed of two Latin words\r\nmeaning to drive away bugs, i. e. Bugbane, the Siberian species being\r\nused to keep away such vermin. _Sanguinaria_, the Bloodroot, is named\r\nfrom the blood-like color of its juice. Other genera are dedicated to\r\ndistinguished botanists or promoters of science, and bear their names:\r\nsuch are _Magnolia_, which commemorates the early French botanist,\r\nMagnol; and _Jeffersonia_, named after President Jefferson, who sent the\r\nfirst exploring expedition over the Rocky Mountains. Others bear the\r\nname of the discoverer of the plant; as, _Sarracenia_, dedicated to Dr.\r\nSarrazin, of Quebec, who was one of the first to send the common\r\nPitcher-plant to the botanists of Europe; and _Claytonia_, first made\r\nknown by the early Virginian botanist Clayton.\r\n\r\n537. =Names of Species.= The name of a species is also a single word,\r\nappended to that of the genus. It is commonly an adjective, and\r\ntherefore agrees with the generic name in case, gender, etc. Sometimes\r\nit relates to the country the species inhabits; as, Claytonia\r\n_Virginica_, first made known from Virginia; Sanguinaria _Canadensis_,\r\nfrom Canada, etc. More commonly it denotes some obvious or\r\ncharacteristic trait of the species; as, for example, in Sarracenia, our\r\nnorthern species is named _purpurea_, from the purple blossoms, while a\r\nmore southern one is named _flava_, because its petals are yellow; the\r\nspecies of Jeffersonia is called _diphylla_, meaning two-leaved, because\r\nits leaf is divided into two leaflets. Some species are named after the\r\ndiscoverer, or in compliment to a botanist who has made them known; as,\r\nMagnolia _Fraseri_, named after the botanist Fraser, one of the first\r\nto find this species; and Sarracenia _Drummondii_, for a Pitcher-plant\r\nfound by Mr. Drummond in Florida. Such personal specific names are of\r\ncourse written with a capital initial letter. Occasionally some old\r\nsubstantive name is used for the species; as Magnolia _Umbrella_, the\r\nUmbrella tree, and Ranunculus _Flammula_. These are also written with a\r\ncapital initial, and need not accord with the generic name in gender.\r\nGeographical specific names, such as _Canadensis_, _Caroliniana_,\r\n_Americana_, in the later usage are by some written without a capital\r\ninitial, but the older usage is better, or at least more accordant with\r\nEnglish orthography.\r\n\r\n538. =Varietal Names=, when any are required, are made on the plan of\r\nspecific names, and follow these, with the prefix _var_. Ranunculus\r\nFlammula, var. _reptans_, the creeping variety: R. abortivus, var.\r\n_micranthus_, the small-flowered variety of the species.\r\n\r\n539. In recording the name of a plant it is usual to append the name, or\r\nan abbreviation of the name, of the botanist who first published it; and\r\nin a flora or other systematic work, this reference to the source of the\r\nname is completed by a further citation of the name of the book, the\r\nvolume and page where it was first published. So \"_Ranunculus acris_,\r\nL.,\" means that this Buttercup was first so named and described by\r\nLinnaeus; \"_R. multifidus_, Pursh,\" that this species was so named and\r\npublished by Pursh. The suffix is no part of the name, but is an\r\nabbreviated reference, to be added or omitted as convenience or\r\ndefiniteness may require. The authority for a generic name is similarly\r\nrecorded. Thus, \"_Ranunculus_, L.,\" means that the genus was so named by\r\nLinnaeus; \"_Myosurus_, Dill.,\" that the Mouse-tail was established as a\r\ngenus under this name by Dillenius; _Caulophyllum_, Michx., that the\r\nBlue Cohosh was published under this name by Michaux. The full reference\r\nin the last-named instance would be, \"in Flora Boreali-Americana, first\r\nvolume, 205th page,\"--in the customary abbreviation, \"Michx. Fl. i.\r\n205.\"\r\n\r\n540. =Names of Orders= are given in the plural number, and are commonly\r\nformed by prolonging the name of a genus of the group taken as a\r\nrepresentative of it. For example, the order of which the Buttercup or\r\nCrowfoot genus, _Ranunculus_, is the representative, takes from it the\r\nname of _Ranunculaceae_; meaning _Plantae Ranunculaceae_ when written out\r\nin full, that is, Ranunculaceous Plants. Some old descriptive names of\r\norders are kept up, such as _Cruciferae_ for the order to which Cress and\r\nMustard belong, from the cruciform appearance of their expanded corolla,\r\nand _Umbelliferae_, from the flowers being in umbels.\r\n\r\n541. =Names of Tribes=, also of suborders, subtribes, and the like, are\r\nplurals of the name of the typical genus, less prolonged, usually in\r\n_eae_, _ineae_, _ideae_, etc. Thus the proper Buttercup tribe is\r\n_Ranunculeae_, of the Clematis tribe, _Clematideae_. While the Rose family\r\nis _Rosaceae_, the special Rose tribe is _Roseae_.\r\n\r\n542. =Names of Classes, etc.= For these see the following synopsis of\r\nthe actual classification adopted, p. 183.\r\n\r\n543. So a plant is named in two words, the generic and the specific\r\nnames, to which may be added a third, that of the variety, upon\r\noccasion. The generic name is peculiar: obviously it must not be used\r\ntwice over in botany. The specific name must not be used twice over in\r\nthe same genus, but is free for any other genus. A _Quercus alba_, or\r\nWhite Oak, is no hindrance to _Betula alba_, or White Birch; and so of\r\nother names.\r\n\r\n544. =Characters and Descriptions.= Plants are _characterized_ by a\r\nterse statement, in botanical terms, of their peculiarities or\r\ndistinguishing marks. The character of the order should include nothing\r\nwhich is common to the whole class it belongs to; that of the genus,\r\nnothing which is common to the order; that of the species nothing which\r\nis shared with all other species of the genus; and so of other\r\ndivisions. _Descriptions_ may enter into complete details of the whole\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n545. =Terminology=, also called _Glossology_, is nomenclature applied to\r\norgans or parts, and their forms or modifications. Each organ or special\r\npart has a substantive name of its own: shapes and other modifications\r\nof an organ or part are designated by adjective terms, or, when the\r\nforms are peculiar, substantive names are given to them. By the correct\r\nuse of such botanical terms, and by proper subordination of the\r\ncharacters under the order, genus, species, etc., plants may be\r\ndescribed and determined with much precision. The classical language of\r\nbotany is Latin. While modern languages have their own names and terms,\r\nthese usually lack the precision of the Latin or Latinized botanical\r\nterminology. Fortunately, this Latinized terminology has been largely\r\nadopted and incorporated into the English technical language of botany,\r\nthus securing precision. And these terms are largely the basis of\r\nspecific names of plants.\r\n\r\n546. A glossary or vocabulary of the principal botanical terms used in\r\nphanerogamous and vascular cryptogamous botany is appended to this\r\nvolume, to which the student may refer, as occasion arises.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3. SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n547. Two systems of classification used to be recognized in botany,--the\r\nartificial and the natural; but only the latter is now thought to\r\ndeserve the name of a system.\r\n\r\n548. Artificial classifications have for object merely the ascertaining\r\nof the name and place of a plant. They do not attempt to express\r\nrelationships, but serve as a kind of dictionary. They distribute the\r\ngenera and species according to some one peculiarity or set of\r\npeculiarities (just as a dictionary distributes words according to their\r\nfirst letters), disregarding all other considerations. At present an\r\nartificial classification in botany is needed only as a key to the\r\nnatural orders,--as an aid in referring an unknown plant to its proper\r\nfamily; and such keys are still very needful, at least for the beginner.\r\nFormerly, when the orders themselves were not clearly made out, an\r\nartificial classification was required to lead the student down to the\r\ngenus. Two such classifications were long in vogue: First, that of\r\nTournefort, founded mainly on the leaves of the flower, the calyx and\r\ncorolla: this was the prevalent system throughout the first half of the\r\neighteenth century; but it has long since gone by. It was succeeded by\r\nthe well-known\r\n\r\n549. =Artificial System of Linnaeus=, which was founded on the stamens\r\nand pistils. It consists of twenty-four classes, and of a variable\r\nnumber of orders; the classes founded mainly on the number and\r\ndisposition of the stamens; the orders partly upon the number of styles\r\nor stigmas, partly upon other considerations. Useful and popular as this\r\nsystem was down to a time within the memory of still surviving\r\nbotanists, it is now completely obsolete. But the tradition of it\r\nsurvives in the names of its classes, Monandria, Diandria, Triandria,\r\netc., which are familiar in terminology in the adjective terms\r\nmonandrous, diandrous, triandrous, etc. (284); also of the orders,\r\nMonogynia, Digynia, Trigynia, etc., preserved in the form of monogynous,\r\ndigynous, trigynous, etc. (301); and in the name Cryptogamia, that of\r\nthe 24th class, which is continued for the lower series in the natural\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\n550. =Natural System.= A genuine system of botany consists of the orders\r\nor families, duly arranged under their classes, and having the tribes,\r\nthe genera, and the species arranged in them according to their\r\nrelationships. This, when properly carried out, is the _Natural System_;\r\nbecause it is intended to express, as well as possible, the various\r\ndegrees of relationship among plants, as presented in nature; that is,\r\nto rank those species and those genera, etc., next to each other in the\r\nclassification which are really most alike in all respects, or, in other\r\nwords, which are constructed most nearly on the same particular plan.\r\n\r\n551. There can be only _one_ natural system of botany, if by this term\r\nis meant the plan according to which the vegetable creation was called\r\ninto being, with all its grades and diversities among the species, as\r\nwell of past as of the present time. But there may be many natural\r\nsystems, if we mean the attempts of men to interpret and express that\r\nplan,--systems which will vary with advancing knowledge, and with the\r\njudgment and skill of different botanists. These must all be very\r\nimperfect, bear the impress of individual minds, and be shaped by the\r\ncurrent philosophy of the age. But the endeavor always is to make the\r\nclassification answer to Nature, as far as any system can which has to\r\nbe expressed in a definite and serial arrangement.\r\n\r\n552. So, although the classes, orders, genera, etc., are natural, or as\r\nnatural as the systematist can make them, their grouping or order of\r\narrangement in a book, must necessarily be in great measure artificial.\r\nIndeed, it is quite impossible to arrange the orders, or even the few\r\nclasses, in a single series, and yet have each group stand next to its\r\nnearest relatives on both sides.\r\n\r\n553. Especially it should be understood that, although phanerogamous\r\nplants are of higher grade than cryptogamous, and angiospermous or\r\nordinary phanerogamous higher than the gymnospermous, yet there is no\r\nculmination in the vegetable kingdom, nor any highest or lowest order of\r\nphanerogamous plants.\r\n\r\n554. The particular system most largely used at present in the\r\nclassification of the orders is essentially the following:--\r\n\r\nSERIES I. PHANEROGAMIA: PHANEROGAMOUS OR FLOWERING PLANTS.\r\n\r\n  CLASS I. DICOTYLEDONES ANGIOSPERMEAE, called for shortness in\r\n  English, DICOTYLEDONS or DICOTYLS. Ovules in a closed ovary.\r\n  Embryo dicotyledonous. Stem with exogenous plan of growth. Leaves\r\n  reticulate-veined,\r\n\r\n    _Artificial Division I._ POLYPETALAE, with petals mostly present\r\n    and distinct. Orders about 80 in number, _Ranunculaceae_ to\r\n    _Cornaceae_.\r\n\r\n    _Artificial Division II._ GAMOPETALAE, with gamopetalous corolla.\r\n    Orders about 45, _Caprifoliaceae_ to _Plantaginaceae_.\r\n\r\n    _Artificial Division III._ APETALAE or INCOMPLETAE, with perianth,\r\n    when present, of calyx only. Orders about 35 in number, from\r\n    _Nyctaginaceae_ to _Salicaceae_.\r\n\r\n  CLASS II. DICOTYLEDONES GYMNOSPERMEAE, in English GYMNOSPERMS. No\r\n  ovary or pericarp, but ovules and seeds naked, and no proper calyx\r\n  nor corolla. Embryo dicotyledonous or polycotyledonous. Stem with\r\n  exogenous plan of growth. Leaves mostly parallel-veined. Consists\r\n  of order _Gnetaceae_, which strictly connects with Angiospermous\r\n  Dicotyls, of _Coniferae_, and of _Cycadaceae_.\r\n\r\n  CLASS III. MONOCOTYLEDONES, in English MONOCOTYLEDONS or\r\n  MONOCOTYLS. Angiospermous. Embryo monocotyledonous. Stem with\r\n  endogenous plan of growth. Leaves mostly parallel-veined.\r\n\r\n    _Division I._ PETALOIDEAE. Perianth complete, having the\r\n    equivalent of both calyx and corolla, and all the inner series\r\n    corolline. About 18 orders.\r\n\r\n    _Division II._ CALYCINAE. Perianth complete (in two series) but\r\n    not corolline, mostly thickish or glumaceous. Chiefly two\r\n    orders, _Juncaceae_, the true Rushes, and _Palmae_, Palms.\r\n\r\n    _Division III._ SPADICIFLORAE or NUDIFLORAE. Perianth none, or\r\n    rudimentary and incomplete: inflorescence spadiceous. Of five\r\n    orders, _Typhaceae_ and _Aroideae_ the principal.\r\n\r\n    _Division IV._ GLUMACEAE. Perianth none, or very rudimentary:\r\n    glumaceous bracts to the flowers. Orders mainly _Cyperaceae_ and\r\n    _Gramineae_.\r\n\r\nSERIES II. CRYPTOGAMIA: CRYPTOGAMOUS OR FLOWERLESS PLANTS.\r\n\r\n  CLASS I. PTERIDOPHYTA, PTERIDOPHYTES (484).\r\n\r\n  CLASS II. BRYOPHYTA, BRYOPHYTES (498).\r\n\r\n  CLASS III. THALLOPHYTA, THALLOPHYTES (503).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX. BOTANICAL WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n555. Some hints and brief instructions for the collection, examination,\r\nand preservation of specimens are added. They are especially intended\r\nfor the assistance of those who have not the advantage of a teacher.\r\nThey apply to phanerogamous plants and Ferns only, and to systematic\r\nbotany.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 1. COLLECTION, OR HERBORIZATION.\r\n\r\n556. As much as possible, plants should be examined in the living state,\r\nor when freshly gathered. But dried specimens should be prepared for\r\nmore leisurely examination and for comparison. To the working botanist\r\ngood dried specimens are indispensable.\r\n\r\n557. =Botanical Specimens=, to be complete, should have root or\r\nrootstock, stem, leaves, flowers, both open and in bud, and fruit.\r\nSometimes these may all be obtained at one gathering; more commonly two\r\nor three gatherings at different times are requisite, especially for\r\ntrees and shrubs.\r\n\r\n558. =In Herborizing=, a good knife and a narrow and strong trowel are\r\nneeded; but a very strong knife will serve instead of a trowel or small\r\npick for digging out bulbs, tubers, and the like. To carry the\r\nspecimens, either the tin box (_vasculum_) or a portfolio, or both are\r\nrequired. The tin box is best for the collection of specimens to be used\r\nfresh, as in the class-room; also for very thick or fleshy plants. The\r\nportfolio is indispensable for long expeditions, and is best for\r\nspecimens which are to be preserved in the herbarium.\r\n\r\n559. The _Vasculum_, or _Botanical Collecting-box_, is made of tin, in\r\nshape like a candle-box, only flatter, or the smaller sizes like an\r\nEnglish sandwich-case; the lid opening for nearly the whole length of\r\none side of the box. Any portable tin box of convenient size, and\r\ncapable of holding specimens a foot or fifteen inches long, will answer\r\nthe purpose. The box should shut close, so that the specimens may not\r\nwilt: then it will keep leafy branches and most flowers perfectly fresh\r\nfor a day or two, especially if slightly moistened. They should not be\r\nwet.\r\n\r\n560. _The Portfolio_ is best made of two pieces of solid binder's-board,\r\ncovered with enamel cloth, which also forms the back, and fastened by\r\nstraps and buckles. It may be from a foot to twenty inches long, from\r\nnine to eleven or twelve inches wide. It should contain a needful\r\nquantity of smooth but strong and pliable paper (thin so-called Manilla\r\npaper is best), either fastened at the back as in a book, or loose in\r\nfolded sheets when not very many specimens are required. As soon as\r\ngathered, the specimens should be separately laid between the leaves or\r\nin the folded sheets, and kept under moderate pressure in the closed\r\nportfolio.\r\n\r\n561. Of small herbs, especially annuals, the whole plant, root and all,\r\nshould be taken for a specimen. Of larger ones branches will suffice,\r\nwith some leaves from near the root. Enough of the root or subterranean\r\npart of the plant should be collected to show whether it is an annual, a\r\nbiennial, or a perennial. Thick roots, bulbs, tubers, or branches of\r\nspecimens intended to be pressed should be thinned with a knife, or cut\r\ninto slices. Keep the specimens within the length of fifteen or sixteen\r\ninches, by folding, or when that cannot be done, by cutting into\r\nlengths.\r\n\r\n562. =For Drying Specimens= a good supply of soft and unsized paper is\r\nwanted; and some convenient means of applying considerable pressure. To\r\nmake good dried botanical specimens, dry them as rapidly as possible\r\nbetween many thicknesses of sun-dried paper to absorb their moisture,\r\nunder as much pressure as can be given without crushing the more\r\ndelicate parts. This pressure may be had by a botanical press, of which\r\nvarious forms have been contrived; or by weights placed upon a\r\nboard,--from forty to eighty or a hundred pounds, according to the\r\nquantity of specimens drying at the time. For use while travelling, a\r\ngood portable press may be made of thick binders' boards for the sides,\r\nand the pressure may be applied by strong straps with buckles. Still\r\nbetter, on some accounts, are portable presses made of wire network,\r\nwhich allow the dampness to escape by evaporation between the meshes.\r\nFor herborization in a small way, a light wire-press may be taken into\r\nthe field and made to serve also as a portfolio.\r\n\r\n563. It is well to have two kinds of paper, namely, _driers_ of bibulous\r\npaper, stitched into pads (or the pads may be of thick carpet-paper, cut\r\nto size) and thin smooth paper, folded once; the specimens to be laid\r\ninto the fold, either when gathered or on returning from the excursion.\r\nThese sheets are to hold the specimens until they are quite dry. Every\r\nday, or at first even twice a day, the specimens, left undisturbed in\r\ntheir sheets, are to be shifted into fire-dried or sun-dried fresh\r\ndriers, and the pressure renewed, while the moist sheets are spread out\r\nto dry, so as to take their turn again at the next shifting. This course\r\nmust be continued until the specimens are no longer moist to the touch.\r\nGood and comely specimens are either made or spoiled within the first\r\ntwenty-four or thirty-six hours. After that, when plenty of driers are\r\nused, it may not be necessary to change them so frequently.\r\n\r\n564. Succulent plants, which long refuse to part with life and moisture,\r\nand Spruces and some other evergreens which are apt to cast off their\r\nleaves, may be plunged for a moment into boiling water, all but the\r\nflowers. Delicate flowers may be encased in thin tissue paper when put\r\ninto the press. Thick parts, like the heads of Sunflowers and Thistles,\r\nmay be cut in two or into slices.\r\n\r\n565. Dried specimens may be packed in bundles, either in folded paper or\r\nupon single half-sheets. It is better that such paper should not be\r\nbibulous. The packages should be well wrapped or kept in close cases.\r\n\r\n566. =Poisoning= is necessary if specimens are to be permanently\r\npreserved from the depredation of insects. The usual application is an\r\nalmost saturated solution of corrosive sublimate in 95 per cent alcohol,\r\nfreely applied with a large and soft brush, or the specimens dipped into\r\nsome of the solution poured into a large and flat dish; the wetted\r\nspecimens to be transferred for a short time to driers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 2. HERBARIUM.\r\n\r\n567. The botanist's collection of dried specimens, ticketed with their\r\nnames, place, and time of collection, and systematically arranged under\r\ntheir genera, orders, etc., forms a _Hortus Siccus_ or _Herbarium_. It\r\ncomprises not only the specimens which the proprietor has himself\r\ncollected, but those which he acquires through friendly exchanges, or in\r\nother ways. The specimens of an herbarium may be kept in folded sheets\r\nof paper; or they may be fastened on half-sheets of thick and white\r\npaper, either by gummed slips, or by glue applied to the specimens\r\nthemselves. The former is best for private and small herbaria; the\r\nlatter for large ones which are much turned over. Each sheet should be\r\nappropriated to one species; two or more different plants should never\r\nbe attached to the same sheet. The generic and specific name of the\r\nplant should be added to the lower right-hand corner, either written on\r\nthe sheet, or on a ticket pasted down; and the time of collection, the\r\nlocality, the color of the flowers, and any other information which the\r\nspecimens themselves do not afford, should be duly recorded upon the\r\nsheet or the ticket. The sheets of the herbarium should all be of\r\nexactly the same dimensions. The herbarium of Linnaeus is on paper of the\r\ncommon foolscap size, about eleven inches long and seven wide. This is\r\ntoo small. Sixteen and three eighths inches by eleven and a half inches\r\nis an approved size.\r\n\r\n568. The sheets containing the species of each genus are to be placed in\r\n_genus-covers_, made of a full sheet of thick paper (such as the\r\nstrongest Manilla-hemp paper), to be when folded of the same dimensions\r\nas the species-sheet but slightly wider: the name of the genus is to be\r\nwritten on one of the lower corners. These are to be arranged under the\r\norders to which they belong, and the whole kept in closed cases or\r\ncabinets, either laid flat in compartments, like \"pigeon-holes,\" or else\r\nplaced in thick portfolios, arranged like folio volumes. All should be\r\nkept, as much as practicable, in dust-proof and insect-proof cases or\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n569. Fruits, tubers, and other hard parts, too thick for the herbarium,\r\nmay be kept in pasteboard or light wooden boxes, in a collection apart.\r\nSmall loose fruits, seeds, detached flowers, and the like may be\r\nconveniently preserved in paper capsules or envelopes, attached to the\r\nherbarium-sheets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 3. INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINATION OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n570. =The Implements= required are a hand magnifying glass, a pocket\r\nlens of an inch or two focus, or a glass of two lenses, one of the lower\r\nand the other of the higher power; and a sharp penknife for dissection.\r\nWith these and reasonable perseverance the structure of the flowers and\r\nfructification of most phanerogamous plants and Ferns can be made out.\r\nBut for ease and comfort, as well as for certainty and right training,\r\nthe student should have some kind of simple stage microscope, and under\r\nthis make all dissections of small parts. Without it the student will be\r\napt to fall into the bad habit of guessing where he ought to ascertain.\r\n\r\n571. The simple microscope may be reduced to a good lens or doublet, of\r\nan inch focus, mounted over a glass stage, so that it can be moved up\r\nand down and also sidewise, and with (or without) a little mirror\r\nunderneath. A better one would have one or two additional lenses (say of\r\nhalf and of a quarter inch focus), a pretty large stage, on the glass of\r\nwhich several small objects can be placed and conveniently brought under\r\nthe lens; and its height or that of the lens should be adjustable by a\r\nrack-work; also a swivel-mounted little mirror beneath, which is needed\r\nfor minute objects to be viewed by transmitted light.\r\n\r\n572. For dissecting and displaying small parts on the stage of the\r\nmicroscope, besides a thin-bladed knife, the only tools needed are a\r\ngood stock of common needles of various sizes, mounted in handles, and\r\none or more saddler's-needles, which, being triangular, may be ground to\r\nsharp edges convenient for dissection. Also a pair of delicate-pointed\r\nforceps; those with curved points used by the dentist are most\r\nconvenient. A cup of clean water is indispensable, with which to moisten\r\nor wet, or in which occasionally to float delicate parts. Small flowers,\r\nbuds, fruits, and seeds of dried specimens can be dissected quite as\r\nwell as fresh ones. They have only to be soaked in warm or boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n573. The compound microscope is rarely necessary except in cryptogamic\r\nbotany and vegetable anatomy; but it is very useful and convenient,\r\nespecially for the examination of pollen. To the advanced botanist it is\r\na necessity, to all students of botany an aid and delight.\r\n\r\n574. =Analysis.= A few directions and hints may be given. The most\r\nimportant is this: In studying an unknown plant, make a complete\r\nexamination of all its parts, and form a clear idea of its floral\r\nstructure and that of its fruit, from pericarp down to the embryo, or as\r\nfar as the materials in hand allow, before taking a step toward finding\r\nout its name and relationship by means of the keys or other helps which\r\nthe Manuals and Floras provide. If it is the name merely that is wanted,\r\nthe shorter way is to ask some one who already knows it. To verify the\r\npoints of structure one by one as they happen to occur in an artificial\r\nkey, without any preparatory investigation, is a usual but is not the\r\nbest nor the surest way. It is well to make drawings or outline\r\nsketches of the smaller parts, and especially diagrams of the plan of\r\nthe flower, such as those of Fig. 225, 227, 241, 244, 275-277. For\r\nthese, cross sections of the flower-bud or flower are to be made: and\r\nlongitudinal sections, such as Fig. 270-274, are equally important. The\r\ndissection even of small seeds is not difficult after some practice.\r\nCommonly they need to be soaked or boiled.\r\n\r\n575. The right appreciation of characters and terms used in description\r\nneeds practice and calls for judgment. Plants do not grow exactly by\r\nrule and plummet, and measurements must be taken loosely. Difference of\r\nsoil and situation are responded to by considerable variations, and\r\nother divergences occur which cannot be accounted for by the\r\nsurroundings, nor be anticipated in general descriptions. Annuals may be\r\nvery depauperate in dry soils or seasons, or very large when\r\nparticularly well nourished. Warm and arid situations promote, and wet\r\nones are apt to diminish pubescence. Salt water causes increased\r\nsucculence. The color of flowers is apt to be lighter in shade, and\r\nbrighter in open and elevated situations. A color or hue not normal to\r\nthe species now and then occurs, which nothing in the conditions will\r\naccount for. _A white-flowered variation of any other colored blossom\r\nmay always be expected_; this, though it may be notable, no more\r\nindicates a distinct variety of the species than an albino would a\r\nvariety of the human species. The numerical plan is subject to variation\r\nin some flowers; those on the plan of five may now and then vary to four\r\nor to six. Variations of the outline or lobing of leaves are so familiar\r\nthat they do not much mislead. Only wider and longer observation\r\nsuffices to prevent or correct mistakes in botanical study. But the\r\nweighing of evidence and the balancing of probabilities, no less than\r\nthe use of the well-ordered and logical system of classification, give\r\nas excellent training to the judgment as the search for the facts\r\nthemselves does to the observing powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSec. 4. SIGNS AND ABBREVIATIONS.\r\n\r\n576. For a full account of these, whether of former or actual use, see\r\n\"Structural Botany\" of the \"Botanical Text Book,\" pp. 367, 392, as also\r\nfor the principles which govern the accentuation of names. It is needful\r\nhere to explain only those used in the Manuals and Floras of this\r\ncountry, for which the present volume is an introduction and companion.\r\nThey are not numerous.\r\n\r\n577. In arranging the species, at least those of a large genus, the\r\ndivisions are denoted and graduated as follows: The sign Sec. is prefixed\r\nto sections of the highest rank: these sections when they have names\r\naffixed to them (as Prunus Sec. Cerasus) may be called subgenera. When the\r\ndivisions of a genus are not of such importance, or when divisions are\r\nmade under the subgenus itself, the most comprehensive ones are marked\r\nby asterisks, * for the first, * * for the second, and so on.\r\nSubdivisions are marked with a prefixed +; those under this head with\r\n++; and those under this with =, if there be so many grades. A similar\r\nnotation is followed in the synopsis of the genera of an order.\r\n\r\n578. The interrogation point is used in botany to indicate doubt. Thus\r\n_Clematis crispa_, L.? expresses a doubt whether the plant in question\r\nis really the _Clematis crispa_ of Linnaeus. _Clematis? polypetala_\r\nexpresses a doubt whether the plant so named is really a Clematis. On\r\nthe other hand the exclamation point (!) is used to denote certainty\r\nwhenever there is special need to affirm this.\r\n\r\n579. For size or height, the common signs of degrees, minutes, and\r\nseconds, have been used, thus, 1 deg., 2', 3\", stand respectively for a\r\nfoot, two inches, and three lines or twelfths of an inch. A better way,\r\nwhen such brevity is needed, is to write 1^{ft}. 2^{in}. 3^{l}.\r\n\r\n580. Signs for duration used by Linnaeus were [Symbol for Sun] for an\r\nannual, [Symbol for Mars] for a biennial, [Symbol for Jupiter] for a\r\nperennial herb, [Symbol like numeral 5 without the top bar] for a shrub\r\nor tree. DeCandolle brought in [Symbol for Sun] for a plant that died\r\nafter once flowering, [Symbol with numeral 1 in a circle] if annual,\r\n[Symbol with numeral 2 in a circle] if biennial.\r\n\r\n581. To indicate sexes, [Symbol for Male] means staminate or male plant\r\nor blossom; [Symbol for Female], pistillate or female; [Symbol like that\r\nfor Mercury, but with two inverted breve accents over it], perfect or\r\nhermaphrodite.\r\n\r\n582. To save room it is not uncommon to use [Symbol for infinity] in\r\nplace of \"many;\" thus, \"Stamens [Symbol for infinity],\" for stamens\r\nindefinitely numerous: \"[Symbol for infinity] flora\" for pluriflora or\r\nmany-flowered. Still more common is the form \"Stamens 5-20,\" or \"Calyx\r\n4-5-parted,\" for stamens from five to twenty, calyx four-parted or\r\nfive-parted, and the like. Such abbreviations hardly need explanation.\r\n\r\n583. The same may be said of such abbreviations as _Cal._ for calyx,\r\n_Cor._ for corolla, _Pet._ for petals, _St._ for stamens, _Pist._ for\r\npistil, _Hab._ for habitat, meaning place of growth, _Herb._ for\r\nherbarium, _Hort._ for garden. Also _l. c._, loco citato, which avoids\r\nrepetition of volume and page.\r\n\r\n584. \"Structural Botany\" has six pages of abbreviations of the names of\r\nbotanists, mostly of botanical authors. As they are not of much\r\nconsequence to the beginner, while the more advanced botanist will know\r\nthe names in full, or know where to find them, only a selection is here\r\nappended.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] For fuller directions in many particulars, see \"Structural Botany,\"\r\npp. 370-374.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABBREVIATIONS OF THE NAMES OF BOTANISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Adans._          = Adanson.\r\n  _Ait._              Aiton.\r\n  _All._              Allioni.\r\n  _Andr._             Andrews.\r\n  _Arn._              Arnott.\r\n  _Aub._              Aublet.\r\n  _Bartr._            Bartram.\r\n  _Beauv._            Palisot de Beauvois.\r\n  _Benth._            Bentham.\r\n  _Bernh._            Bernhardi.\r\n  _Bigel._            Jacob Bigelow.\r\n  _Bong._             Bongard.\r\n  _Bonpl._            Bonpland.\r\n  _Br._ or _R.
