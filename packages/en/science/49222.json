The case I know will interest you, and no one else could\r\ndeal with it so well. In fact, no ordinary professional man could deal\r\nwith it at all, for I know of no treatment or medicine that can restore\r\na lost sense of humour!”\r\n\r\n“You begin to interest me with your ‘case,’” he replied, and made\r\nhimself comfortable to listen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sivendson drew a sigh of contentment as she watched him go to the\r\ntube and heard him tell the servant he was not to be disturbed.\r\n\r\n“I believe you have read my thoughts already,” she said; “your\r\nintuitive knowledge of what goes on in other people’s minds is\r\npositively uncanny.”\r\n\r\nHer friend shook his head and smiled as he drew his chair up to a\r\nconvenient position and prepared to listen attentively to what she had\r\nto say. He closed his eyes, as he always did when he wished to absorb\r\nthe real meaning of a recital that might be inadequately expressed,\r\nfor by this method he found it easier to set himself in tune with the\r\nliving thoughts that lay behind the broken words.\r\n\r\nBy his friends John Silence was regarded as an eccentric, because\r\nhe was rich by accident, and by choice--a doctor. That a man of\r\nindependent means should devote his time to doctoring, chiefly\r\ndoctoring folk who could not pay, passed their comprehension entirely.\r\nThe native nobility of a soul whose first desire was to help those who\r\ncould not help themselves, puzzled them. After that, it irritated them,\r\nand, greatly to his own satisfaction, they left him to his own devices.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence was a free-lance, though, among doctors, having neither\r\nconsulting-room, bookkeeper, nor professional manner. He took no\r\nfees, being at heart a genuine philanthropist, yet at the same time\r\ndid no harm to his fellow-practitioners, because he only accepted\r\nunremunerative cases, and cases that interested him for some very\r\nspecial reason. He argued that the rich could pay, and the very poor\r\ncould avail themselves of organised charity, but that a very large\r\nclass of ill-paid, self-respecting workers, often followers of the\r\narts, could not afford the price of a week’s comforts merely to be told\r\nto travel. And it was these he desired to help: cases often requiring\r\nspecial and patient study--things no doctor can give for a guinea, and\r\nthat no one would dream of expecting him to give.\r\n\r\nBut there was another side to his personality and practice, and one\r\nwith which we are now more directly concerned; for the cases that\r\nespecially appealed to him were of no ordinary kind, but rather of that\r\nintangible, elusive, and difficult nature best described as psychical\r\nafflictions; and, though he would have been the last person himself to\r\napprove of the title, it was beyond question that he was known more or\r\nless generally as the “Psychic Doctor.”\r\n\r\nIn order to grapple with cases of this peculiar kind, he had submitted\r\nhimself to a long and severe training, at once physical, mental, and\r\nspiritual. What precisely this training had been, or where undergone,\r\nno one seemed to know,--for he never spoke of it, as, indeed, he\r\nbetrayed no single other characteristic of the charlatan,--but the fact\r\nthat it had involved a total disappearance from the world for five\r\nyears, and that after he returned and began his singular practice no\r\none ever dreamed of applying to him the so easily acquired epithet of\r\nquack, spoke much for the seriousness of his strange quest and also for\r\nthe genuineness of his attainments.\r\n\r\nFor the modern psychical researcher he felt the calm tolerance of the\r\n“man who knows.” There was a trace of pity in his voice--contempt he\r\nnever showed--when he spoke of their methods.\r\n\r\n“This classification of results is uninspired work at best,” he said\r\nonce to me, when I had been his confidential assistant for some years.\r\n“It leads nowhere, and after a hundred years will lead nowhere. It is\r\nplaying with the wrong end of a rather dangerous toy. Far better, it\r\nwould be, to examine the causes, and then the results would so easily\r\nslip into place and explain themselves. For the sources are accessible,\r\nand open to all who have the courage to lead the life that alone makes\r\npractical investigation safe and possible.”\r\n\r\nAnd towards the question of clairvoyance, too, his attitude was\r\nsignificantly sane, for he knew how extremely rare the genuine power\r\nwas, and that what is commonly called clairvoyance is nothing more than\r\na keen power of visualising.\r\n\r\n“It connotes a slightly increased sensibility, nothing more,” he would\r\nsay. “The true clairvoyant deplores his power, recognising that it adds\r\na new horror to life, and is in the nature of an affliction. And you\r\nwill find this always to be the real test.”\r\n\r\nThus it was that John Silence, this singularly developed doctor, was\r\nable to select his cases with a clear knowledge of the difference\r\nbetween mere hysterical delusion and the kind of psychical affliction\r\nthat claimed his special powers. It was never necessary for him to\r\nresort to the cheap mysteries of divination; for, as I have heard him\r\nobserve, after the solution of some peculiarly intricate problem--\r\n\r\n“Systems of divination, from geomancy down to reading by tea-leaves,\r\nare merely so many methods of obscuring the outer vision, in order\r\nthat the inner vision may become open. Once the method is mastered, no\r\nsystem is necessary at all.”\r\n\r\nAnd the words were significant of the methods of this remarkable man,\r\nthe keynote of whose power lay, perhaps, more than anything else,\r\nin the knowledge, first, that thought can act at a distance, and,\r\nsecondly, that thought is dynamic and can accomplish material results.\r\n\r\n“Learn how to _think_,” he would have expressed it, “and you have\r\nlearned to tap power at its source.”\r\n\r\nTo look at--he was now past forty--he was sparely built, with speaking\r\nbrown eyes in which shone the light of knowledge and self-confidence,\r\nwhile at the same time they made one think of that wondrous gentleness\r\nseen most often in the eyes of animals. A close beard concealed the\r\nmouth without disguising the grim determination of lips and jaw,\r\nand the face somehow conveyed an impression of transparency, almost\r\nof light, so delicately were the features refined away. On the\r\nfine forehead was that indefinable touch of peace that comes from\r\nidentifying the mind with what is permanent in the soul, and letting\r\nthe impermanent slip by without power to wound or distress; while, from\r\nhis manner,--so gentle, quiet, sympathetic,--few could have guessed the\r\nstrength of purpose that burned within like a great flame.\r\n\r\n“I think I should describe it as a psychical case,” continued the\r\nSwedish lady, obviously trying to explain herself very intelligently,\r\n“and just the kind you like. I mean a case where the cause is hidden\r\ndeep down in some spiritual distress, and----”\r\n\r\n“But the symptoms first, please, my dear Svenska,” he interrupted, with\r\na strangely compelling seriousness of manner, “and your deductions\r\nafterwards.”\r\n\r\nShe turned round sharply on the edge of her chair and looked him in the\r\nface, lowering her voice to prevent her emotion betraying itself too\r\nobviously.\r\n\r\n“In my opinion there’s only one symptom,” she half whispered, as though\r\ntelling something disagreeable--“fear--simply fear.”\r\n\r\n“Physical fear?”\r\n\r\n“I think not; though how can I say? I think it’s a horror in the\r\npsychical region. It’s no ordinary delusion; the man is quite sane; but\r\nhe lives in mortal terror of something----”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean by his ‘psychical region,’” said the\r\ndoctor, with a smile; “though I suppose you wish me to understand that\r\nhis spiritual, and not his mental, processes are affected. Anyhow, try\r\nand tell me briefly and pointedly what you know about the man, his\r\nsymptoms, his need for help, _my_ peculiar help, that is, and all that\r\nseems vital in the case. I promise to listen devotedly.”\r\n\r\n“I am trying,” she continued earnestly, “but must do so in my own words\r\nand trust to your intelligence to disentangle as I go along. He is a\r\nyoung author, and lives in a tiny house off Putney Heath somewhere. He\r\nwrites humorous stories--quite a genre of his own: Pender--you must\r\nhave heard the name--Felix Pender? Oh, the man had a great gift, and\r\nmarried on the strength of it; his future seemed assured. I say ‘had,’\r\nfor quite suddenly his talent utterly failed him. Worse, it became\r\ntransformed into its opposite. He can no longer write a line in the\r\nold way that was bringing him success----”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence opened his eyes for a second and looked at her.\r\n\r\n“He still writes, then? The force has not gone?” he asked briefly, and\r\nthen closed his eyes again to listen.\r\n\r\n“He works like a fury,” she went on, “but produces nothing”--she\r\nhesitated a moment--“nothing that he can use or sell. His earnings have\r\npractically ceased, and he makes a precarious living by book-reviewing\r\nand odd jobs--very odd, some of them. Yet, I am certain his talent has\r\nnot really deserted him finally, but is merely----”\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs. Sivendson hesitated for the appropriate word.\r\n\r\n“In abeyance,” he suggested, without opening his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Obliterated,” she went on, after a moment to weigh the word, “merely\r\nobliterated by something else----”\r\n\r\n“By some _one_ else?”\r\n\r\n“I wish I knew. All I can say is that he is haunted, and temporarily\r\nhis sense of humour is shrouded--gone--replaced by something dreadful\r\nthat writes other things. Unless something competent is done, he will\r\nsimply starve to death. Yet he is afraid to go to a doctor for fear of\r\nbeing pronounced insane; and, anyhow, a man can hardly ask a doctor to\r\ntake a guinea to restore a vanished sense of humour, can he?”\r\n\r\n“Has he tried any one at all----?”\r\n\r\n“Not doctors yet. He tried some clergymen and religious people; but\r\nthey _know_ so little and have so little intelligent sympathy. And\r\nmost of them are so busy balancing on their own little pedestals----”\r\n\r\nJohn Silence stopped her tirade with a gesture.\r\n\r\n“And how is it that you know so much about him?” he asked gently.\r\n\r\n“I know Mrs. Pender well--I knew her before she married him----”\r\n\r\n“And is she a cause, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least. She is devoted; a woman very well educated, though\r\nwithout being really intelligent, and with so little sense of humour\r\nherself that she always laughs at the wrong places. But she has\r\nnothing to do with the cause of his distress; and, indeed, has chiefly\r\nguessed it from observing him, rather than from what little he has\r\ntold her. And he, you know, is a really lovable fellow, hard-working,\r\npatient--altogether worth saving.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence opened his eyes and went over to ring for tea. He did\r\nnot know very much more about the case of the humorist than when he\r\nfirst sat down to listen; but he realised that no amount of words from\r\nhis Swedish friend would help to reveal the real facts. A personal\r\ninterview with the author himself could alone do that.\r\n\r\n“All humorists are worth saving,” he said with a smile, as she poured\r\nout tea. “We can’t afford to lose a single one in these strenuous days.\r\nI will go and see your friend at the first opportunity.”\r\n\r\nShe thanked him elaborately, effusively, with many words, and he, with\r\nmuch difficulty, kept the conversation thenceforward strictly to the\r\nteapot.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a result of this conversation, and a little more he had\r\ngathered by means best known to himself and his secretary, he was\r\nwhizzing in his motor-car one afternoon a few days later up the Putney\r\nHill to have his first interview with Felix Pender, the humorous writer\r\nwho was the victim of some mysterious malady in his “psychical region”\r\nthat had obliterated his sense of the comic and threatened to wreck his\r\nlife and destroy his talent. And his desire to help was probably of\r\nequal strength with his desire to know and to investigate.\r\n\r\nThe motor stopped with a deep purring sound, as though a great black\r\npanther lay concealed within its hood, and the doctor--the “psychic\r\ndoctor,” as he was sometimes called--stepped out through the gathering\r\nfog, and walked across the tiny garden that held a blackened fir tree\r\nand a stunted laurel shrubbery. The house was very small, and it was\r\nsome time before any one answered the bell. Then, suddenly, a light\r\nappeared in the hall, and he saw a pretty little woman standing on\r\nthe top step begging him to come in. She was dressed in grey, and the\r\ngaslight fell on a mass of deliberately brushed light hair. Stuffed,\r\ndusty birds, and a shabby array of African spears, hung on the wall\r\nbehind her. A hat-rack, with a bronze plate full of very large cards,\r\nled his eye swiftly to a dark staircase beyond. Mrs. Pender had round\r\neyes like a child’s, and she greeted him with an effusiveness that\r\nbarely concealed her emotion, yet strove to appear naturally cordial.\r\nEvidently she had been looking out for his arrival, and had outrun the\r\nservant girl. She was a little breathless.\r\n\r\n“I hope you’ve not been kept waiting--I think it’s _most_ good of you\r\nto come----” she began, and then stopped sharp when she saw his face in\r\nthe gaslight. There was something in Dr. Silence’s look that did not\r\nencourage mere talk. He was in earnest now, if ever man was.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, Mrs. Pender,” he said, with a quiet smile that won\r\nconfidence, yet deprecated unnecessary words, “the fog delayed me a\r\nlittle. I am glad to see you.”\r\n\r\nThey went into a dingy sitting-room at the back of the house, neatly\r\nfurnished but depressing. Books stood in a row upon the mantelpiece.\r\nThe fire had evidently just been lit. It smoked in great puffs into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Sivendson said she thought you might be able to come,” ventured\r\nthe little woman again, looking up engagingly into his face and\r\nbetraying anxiety and eagerness in every gesture. “But I hardly dared\r\nto believe it. I think it is really too good of you. My husband’s case\r\nis so peculiar that--well, you know, I am quite sure any _ordinary_\r\ndoctor would say at once the asylum----”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t he in, then?” asked Dr. Silence gently.\r\n\r\n“In the asylum?” she gasped. “Oh dear, no--not yet!”\r\n\r\n“In the house, I meant,” he laughed.\r\n\r\nShe gave a great sigh.\r\n\r\n“He’ll be back any minute now,” she replied, obviously relieved to see\r\nhim laugh; “but the fact is, we didn’t expect you so early--I mean, my\r\nhusband hardly thought you would come at all.”\r\n\r\n“I am always delighted to come--when I am really wanted, and can be of\r\nhelp,” he said quickly; “and, perhaps, it’s all for the best that your\r\nhusband is out, for now that we are alone you can tell me something\r\nabout his difficulties. So far, you know, I have heard very little.”\r\n\r\nHer voice trembled as she thanked him, and when he came and took a\r\nchair close beside her she actually had difficulty in finding words\r\nwith which to begin.\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” she began timidly, and then continuing with a\r\nnervous incoherent rush of words, “he will be simply delighted that\r\nyou’ve really come, because he said you were the only person he would\r\nconsent to see at all--the only doctor, I mean. But, of course, he\r\ndoesn’t know how frightened I am, or how much I have noticed. He\r\npretends with me that it’s just a nervous breakdown, and I’m sure he\r\ndoesn’t realise all the odd things I’ve noticed him doing. But the main\r\nthing, I suppose----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the main thing, Mrs. Pender,” he said encouragingly, noticing her\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n“----is that he thinks we are not alone in the house. That’s the chief\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me more facts--just facts.”\r\n\r\n“It began last summer when I came back from Ireland; he had been here\r\nalone for six weeks, and I thought him looking tired and queer--ragged\r\nand scattered about the face, if you know what I mean, and his manner\r\nworn out. He said he had been writing hard, but his inspiration had\r\nsomehow failed him, and he was dissatisfied with his work. His sense of\r\nhumour was leaving him, or changing into something else, he said. There\r\nwas something in the house, he declared, that”--she emphasised the\r\nwords--“prevented his feeling funny.”\r\n\r\n“Something in the house that prevented his feeling funny,” repeated the\r\ndoctor. “Ah, now we’re getting to the heart of it!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she resumed vaguely; “that’s what he kept saying.”\r\n\r\n“And what was it he _did_ that you thought strange?” he asked\r\nsympathetically. “Be brief, or he may be here before you finish.”\r\n\r\n“Very small things, but significant it seemed to me. He changed his\r\nworkroom from the library, as we call it, to the sitting-room. He\r\nsaid all his characters became wrong and terrible in the library;\r\nthey altered, so that he felt like writing tragedies--vile, debased\r\ntragedies, the tragedies of broken souls. But now he says the same of\r\nthe smoking-room, and he’s gone back to the library.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“You see, there’s so little I can tell you,” she went on, with\r\nincreasing speed and countless gestures. “I mean it’s only very small\r\nthings he does and says that are queer. What frightens me is that he\r\nassumes there is some one else in the house all the time--some one I\r\nnever see. He does not actually say so, but on the stairs I’ve seen him\r\nstanding aside to let some one pass; I’ve seen him open a door to let\r\nsome one in or out; and often in our bedroom he puts chairs about as\r\nthough for some one else to sit in. Oh--oh yes, and once or twice,” she\r\ncried--“once or twice----”\r\n\r\nShe paused, and looked about her with a startled air.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Once or twice,” she resumed hurriedly, as though she heard a sound\r\nthat alarmed her, “I’ve heard him running--coming in and out of the\r\nrooms breathless as if something were after him----”\r\n\r\nThe door opened while she was still speaking, cutting her words off in\r\nthe middle, and a man came into the room. He was dark and clean-shaven\r\nsallow rather, with the eyes of imagination, and dark hair growing\r\nscantily about the temples. He was dressed in a shabby tweed suit, and\r\nwore an untidy flannel collar at the neck. The dominant expression of\r\nhis face was startled--hunted; an expression that might any moment\r\nleap into the dreadful stare of terror and announce a total loss of\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\nThe moment he saw his visitor a smile spread over his worn features,\r\nand he advanced to shake hands.\r\n\r\n“I hoped you would come; Mrs. Sivendson said you might be able to find\r\ntime,” he said simply. His voice was thin and reedy. “I am very glad to\r\nsee you, Dr. Silence. It is ‘Doctor,’ is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I am entitled to the description,” laughed the other, “but I\r\nrarely get it. You know, I do not practise as a regular thing; that is,\r\nI only take cases that specially interest me, or----”\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence, for the men exchanged a glance of\r\nsympathy that rendered it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n“I have heard of your great kindness.”\r\n\r\n“It’s my hobby,” said the other quickly, “and my privilege.”\r\n\r\n“I trust you will still think so when you have heard what I have to\r\ntell you,” continued the author, a little wearily. He led the way\r\nacross the hall into the little smoking-room where they could talk\r\nfreely and undisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn the smoking-room, the door shut and privacy about them, Pender’s\r\nattitude changed somewhat, and his manner became very grave. The doctor\r\nsat opposite, where he could watch his face. Already, he saw, it\r\nlooked more haggard. Evidently it cost him much to refer to his trouble\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n“What I have is, in my belief, a profound spiritual affliction,” he\r\nbegan quite bluntly, looking straight into the other’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“I saw that at once,” Dr. Silence said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you saw that, of course; my atmosphere must convey that much to\r\nany one with psychic perceptions. Besides which, I feel sure from all\r\nI’ve heard, that you are really a soul-doctor, are you not, more than a\r\nhealer merely of the body?”\r\n\r\n“You think of me too highly,” returned the other; “though I prefer\r\ncases, as you know, in which the spirit is disturbed first, the body\r\nafterwards.”\r\n\r\n“I understand, yes. Well, I have experienced a curious disturbance\r\nin--_not_ in my physical region primarily. I mean my nerves are all\r\nright, and my body is all right I have no delusions exactly, but my\r\nspirit is tortured by a calamitous fear which first came upon me in a\r\nstrange manner.”\r\n\r\nJohn Silence leaned forward a moment and took the speaker’s hand and\r\nheld it in his own for a few brief seconds, closing his eyes as he\r\ndid so. He was not feeling his pulse, or doing any of the things that\r\ndoctors ordinarily do; he was merely absorbing into himself the main\r\nnote of the man’s mental condition, so as to get completely his own\r\npoint of view, and thus be able to treat his case with true sympathy. A\r\nvery close observer might perhaps have noticed that a slight tremor ran\r\nthrough his frame after he had held the hand for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n“Tell me quite frankly, Mr. Pender,” he said soothingly, releasing the\r\nhand, and with deep attention in his manner, “tell me all the steps\r\nthat led to the beginning of this invasion. I mean tell me what the\r\nparticular drug was, and why you took it, and how it affected you----”\r\n\r\n“Then you know it began with a drug!” cried the author, with\r\nundisguised astonishment.\r\n\r\n“I only know from what I observe in you, and in its effect upon myself.\r\nYou are in a surprising psychical condition. Certain portions of your\r\natmosphere are vibrating at a far greater rate than others. This is the\r\neffect of a drug, but of no ordinary drug. Allow me to finish, please.\r\nIf the higher rate of vibration spreads all over, you will become, of\r\ncourse, permanently cognisant of a much larger world than the one you\r\nknow normally. If, on the other hand, the rapid portion sinks back to\r\nthe usual rate, you will lose these occasional increased perceptions\r\nyou now have.”\r\n\r\n“You amaze me!” exclaimed the author; “for your words exactly describe\r\nwhat I have been feeling----”\r\n\r\n“I mention this only in passing, and to give you confidence before\r\nyou approach the account of your real affliction,” continued the\r\ndoctor. “All perception, as you know, is the result of vibrations; and\r\nclairvoyance simply means becoming sensitive to an increased scale of\r\nvibrations. The awakening of the inner senses we hear so much about\r\nmeans no more than that. Your partial clairvoyance is easily explained.\r\nThe only thing that puzzles me is how you managed to procure the drug,\r\nfor it is not easy to get in pure form, and no adulterated tincture\r\ncould have given you the terrific impetus I see you have acquired. But,\r\nplease proceed now and tell me your story in your own way.”\r\n\r\n“This _Cannabis indica_,” the author went on, “came into my possession\r\nlast autumn while my wife was away. I need not explain how I got it,\r\nfor that has no importance; but it was the genuine fluid extract, and\r\nI could not resist the temptation to make an experiment. One of its\r\neffects, as you know, is to induce torrential laughter----”\r\n\r\n“Yes; sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“----I am a writer of humorous tales, and I wished to increase my own\r\nsense of laughter--to see the ludicrous from an abnormal point of view.\r\nI wished to study it a bit, if possible, and----”\r\n\r\n“Tell me!”\r\n\r\n“I took an experimental dose. I starved for six hours to hasten the\r\neffect, locked myself into this room, and gave orders not to be\r\ndisturbed. Then I swallowed the stuff and waited.”\r\n\r\n“And the effect?”\r\n\r\n“I waited one hour, two, three, four, five hours. Nothing happened. No\r\nlaughter came, but only a great weariness instead. Nothing in the room\r\nor in my thoughts came within a hundred miles of a humorous aspect.”\r\n\r\n“Always a most uncertain drug,” interrupted the doctor. “We make very\r\nsmall use of it on that account.”\r\n\r\n“At two o’clock in the morning I felt so hungry and tired that I\r\ndecided to give up the experiment and wait no longer. I drank some\r\nmilk and went upstairs to bed. I felt flat and disappointed. I fell\r\nasleep at once and must have slept for about an hour, when I awoke\r\nsuddenly with a great noise in my ears. It was the noise of my\r\nown laughter! I was simply shaking with merriment. At first I was\r\nbewildered and thought I had been laughing in dreams, but a moment\r\nlater I remembered the drug, and was delighted to think that after\r\nall I had got an effect. It had been working all along, only I had\r\nmiscalculated the time. The only unpleasant thing _then_ was an odd\r\nfeeling that I had not waked naturally, but had been wakened by some\r\none else--deliberately. This came to me as a certainty in the middle of\r\nmy noisy laughter and distressed me.”\r\n\r\n“Any impression who it could have been?” asked the doctor, now\r\nlistening with close attention to every word, very much on the alert.\r\n\r\nPender hesitated and tried to smile. He brushed his hair from his\r\nforehead with a nervous gesture.\r\n\r\n“You must tell me all your impressions, even your fancies; they are\r\nquite as important as your certainties.”\r\n\r\n“I had a vague idea that it was some one connected with my forgotten\r\ndream, some one who had been at me in my sleep, some one of great\r\nstrength and great ability--of great force--quite an unusual\r\npersonality--and, I was certain, too--a woman.”\r\n\r\n“A good woman?” asked John Silence quietly.\r\n\r\nPender started a little at the question and his sallow face flushed;\r\nit seemed to surprise him. But he shook his head quickly with an\r\nindefinable look of horror.\r\n\r\n“Evil,” he answered briefly, “appallingly evil, and yet mingled with\r\nthe sheer wickedness of it was also a certain perverseness--the\r\nperversity of the unbalanced mind.”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment and looked up sharply at his interlocutor. A\r\nshade of suspicion showed itself in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“No,” laughed the doctor, “you need not fear that I’m merely humouring\r\nyou, or think you mad. Far from it. Your story interests me exceedingly\r\nand you furnish me unconsciously with a number of clues as you tell it.\r\nYou see, I possess some knowledge of my own as to these psychic byways.”\r\n\r\n“I was shaking with such violent laughter,” continued the narrator,\r\nreassured in a moment, “though with no clear idea what was amusing me,\r\nthat I had the greatest difficulty in getting up for the matches, and\r\nwas afraid I should frighten the servants overhead with my explosions.\r\nWhen the gas was lit I found the room empty, of course, and the door\r\nlocked as usual. Then I half dressed and went out on to the landing,\r\nmy hilarity better under control, and proceeded to go downstairs. I\r\nwished to record my sensations. I stuffed a handkerchief into my mouth\r\nso as not to scream aloud and communicate my hysterics to the entire\r\nhousehold.”\r\n\r\n“And the presence of this--this----?”\r\n\r\n“It was hanging about me all the time,” said Pender, “but for the\r\nmoment it seemed to have withdrawn. Probably, too, my laughter killed\r\nall other emotions.”\r\n\r\n“And how long did you take getting downstairs?”\r\n\r\n“I was just coming to that I see you know all my ‘symptoms’ in advance,\r\nas it were; for, of course, I thought I should never get to the bottom.\r\nEach step seemed to take five minutes, and crossing the narrow hall at\r\nthe foot of the stairs--well, I could have sworn it was half an hour’s\r\njourney had not my watch certified that it was a few seconds. Yet I\r\nwalked fast and tried to push on. It was no good. I walked apparently\r\nwithout advancing, and at that rate it would have taken me a week to\r\nget down Putney Hill.”\r\n\r\n“An experimental dose radically alters the scale of time and space\r\nsometimes----”\r\n\r\n“But, when at last I got into my study and lit the gas, the change came\r\nhorridly, and sudden as a flash of lightning. It was like a douche of\r\nicy water, and in the middle of this storm of laughter----”\r\n\r\n“Yes; what?” asked the doctor, leaning forward and peering into his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“----I was overwhelmed with terror,” said Pender, lowering his reedy\r\nvoice at the mere recollection of it.\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment and mopped his forehead. The scared, hunted look in\r\nhis eyes now dominated the whole face. Yet, all the time, the corners\r\nof his mouth hinted of possible laughter as though the recollection of\r\nthat merriment still amused him. The combination of fear and laughter\r\nin his face was very curious, and lent great conviction to his story;\r\nit also lent a bizarre expression of horror to his gestures.\r\n\r\n“Terror, was it?” repeated the doctor soothingly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, terror; for, though the Thing that woke me seemed to have gone,\r\nthe memory of it still frightened me, and I collapsed into a chair.\r\nThen I locked the door and tried to reason with myself, but the\r\ndrug made my movements so prolonged that it took me five minutes to\r\nreach the door, and another five to get back to the chair again. The\r\nlaughter, too, kept bubbling up inside me--great wholesome laughter\r\nthat shook me like gusts of wind--so that even my terror almost made\r\nme laugh. Oh, but I may tell you, Dr. Silence, it was altogether vile,\r\nthat mixture of fear and laughter, altogether vile!\r\n\r\n“Then, all at once, the things in the room again presented their\r\nfunny side to me and set me off laughing more furiously than ever.\r\nThe bookcase was ludicrous, the arm-chair a perfect clown, the way\r\nthe clock looked at me on the mantelpiece too comic for words; the\r\narrangement of papers and inkstand on the desk tickled me till I roared\r\nand shook and held my sides and the tears streamed down my cheeks. And\r\nthat footstool! Oh, that absurd footstool!”\r\n\r\nHe lay back in his chair, laughing to himself and holding up his hands\r\nat the thought of it, and at the sight of him Dr. Silence laughed too.\r\n\r\n“Go on, please,” he said, “I quite understand. I know something myself\r\nof the hashish laughter.”\r\n\r\nThe author pulled himself together and resumed, his face growing\r\nquickly grave again.\r\n\r\n“So, you see, side by side with this extravagant, apparently causeless\r\nmerriment, there was also an extravagant, apparently causeless terror.\r\nThe drug produced the laughter, I knew; but what brought in the terror\r\nI could not imagine. Everywhere behind the fun lay the fear. It was\r\nterror masked by cap and bells; and I became the playground for two\r\nopposing emotions, armed and fighting to the death. Gradually, then,\r\nthe impression grew in me that this fear was caused by the invasion--so\r\nyou called it just now--of the ‘person’ who had wakened me: she was\r\nutterly evil; inimical to my soul, or at least to all in me that wished\r\nfor good. There I stood, sweating and trembling, laughing at everything\r\nin the room, yet all the while with this white terror mastering my\r\nheart. And this creature was putting--putting her----”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated again, using his handkerchief freely.\r\n\r\n“Putting what?”\r\n\r\n“----putting ideas into my mind,” he went on, glancing nervously about\r\nthe room. “Actually tapping my thought-stream so as to switch off the\r\nusual current and inject her own. How mad that sounds! I know it,\r\nbut it’s true. It’s the only way I can express it. Moreover, while\r\nthe operation terrified me, the skill with which it was accomplished\r\nfilled me afresh with laughter at the clumsiness of men by comparison.\r\nOur ignorant, bungling methods of teaching the minds of others, of\r\ninculcating ideas, and so on, overwhelmed me with laughter when I\r\nunderstood this superior and diabolical method. Yet my laughter seemed\r\nhollow and ghastly, and ideas of evil and tragedy trod close upon the\r\nheels of the comic. Oh, doctor, I tell you again, it was unnerving!”\r\n\r\nJohn Silence sat with his head thrust forward to catch every word of\r\nthe story which the other continued to pour out in nervous, jerky\r\nsentences and lowered voice.\r\n\r\n“You _saw_ nothing--no one--all this time?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Not with my eyes. There was no visual hallucination. But in my mind\r\nthere began to grow the vivid picture of a woman--large, dark-skinned,\r\nwith white teeth and masculine features, and one eye--the left--so\r\ndrooping as to appear almost closed. Oh, such a face----!”\r\n\r\n“A face you would recognise again?”\r\n\r\nPender laughed dreadfully.\r\n\r\n“I wish I could forget it,” he whispered, “I only wish I could forget\r\nit!” Then he sat forward in his chair suddenly, and grasped the\r\ndoctor’s hand with an emotional gesture.\r\n\r\n“I _must_ tell you how grateful I am for your patience and sympathy,”\r\nhe cried, with a tremor in his voice, “and--that you do not think\r\nme mad. I have told no one else a quarter of all this, and the\r\nmere freedom of speech--the relief of sharing my affliction with\r\nanother--has helped me already more than I can possibly say.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence pressed his hand and looked steadily into the frightened\r\neyes. His voice was very gentle when he replied.\r\n\r\n“Your case, you know, is very singular, but of absorbing interest to\r\nme,” he said, “for it threatens, not your physical existence, but\r\nthe temple of your psychical existence--the inner life. Your mind\r\nwould not be permanently affected here and now, in this world; but in\r\nthe existence after the body is left behind, you might wake up with\r\nyour spirit so twisted, so distorted, so befouled, that you would be\r\n_spiritually insane_--a far more radical condition than merely being\r\ninsane here.”\r\n\r\nThere came a strange hush over the room, and between the two men\r\nsitting there facing one another.\r\n\r\n“Do you really mean--Good Lord!” stammered the author as soon as he\r\ncould find his tongue.\r\n\r\n“What I mean in detail will keep till a little later, and I need only\r\nsay now that I should not have spoken in this way unless I were quite\r\npositive of being able to help you. Oh, there’s no doubt as to that,\r\nbelieve me. In the first place, I am very familiar with the workings\r\nof this extraordinary drug, this drug which has had the chance effect\r\nof opening you up to the forces of another region; and, in the second,\r\nI have a firm belief in the reality of super-sensuous occurrences as\r\nwell as considerable knowledge of psychic processes acquired by long\r\nand painful experiment. The rest is, or should be, merely sympathetic\r\ntreatment and practical application. The hashish has partially opened\r\nanother world to you by increasing your rate of psychical vibration,\r\nand thus rendering you abnormally sensitive. Ancient forces attached to\r\nthis house have attacked you. For the moment I am only puzzled as to\r\ntheir precise nature; for were they of an ordinary character, I should\r\nmyself be psychic enough to feel them. Yet I am conscious of feeling\r\nnothing as yet. But now, please continue, Mr. Pender, and tell me the\r\nrest of your wonderful story; and when you have finished, I will talk\r\nabout the means of cure.”\r\n\r\nPender shifted his chair a little closer to the friendly doctor and\r\nthen went on in the same nervous voice with his narrative.\r\n\r\n“After making some notes of my impressions I finally got upstairs again\r\nto bed. It was four o’clock in the morning. I laughed all the way\r\nup--at the grotesque banisters, the droll physiognomy of the staircase\r\nwindow, the burlesque grouping of the furniture, and the memory of that\r\noutrageous footstool in the room below; but nothing more happened to\r\nalarm or disturb me, and I woke late in the morning after a dreamless\r\nsleep, none the worse for my experiment except for a slight headache\r\nand a coldness of the extremities due to lowered circulation.”\r\n\r\n“Fear gone, too?” asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“I seemed to have forgotten it, or at least ascribed it to mere\r\nnervousness. It’s reality had gone, anyhow for the time, and all\r\nthat day I wrote and wrote and wrote. My sense of laughter seemed\r\nwonderfully quickened and my characters acted without effort out of\r\nthe heart of true humour. I was exceedingly pleased with this result\r\nof my experiment But when the stenographer had taken her departure and\r\nI came to read over the pages she had typed out, I recalled her sudden\r\nglances of surprise and the odd way she had looked up at me while I was\r\ndictating. I was amazed at what I read and could hardly believe I had\r\nuttered it.”\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\n“It was so distorted. The words, indeed, were mine so far as I could\r\nremember, but the meanings seemed strange. It frightened me. The sense\r\nwas so altered. At the very places where my characters were intended to\r\ntickle the ribs, only curious emotions of sinister amusement resulted.\r\nDreadful innuendoes had managed to creep into the phrases. There was\r\nlaughter of a kind, but it was bizarre, horrible, distressing; and\r\nmy attempt at analysis only increased my dismay. The story, as it\r\nread then, made me shudder, for by virtue of these slight changes it\r\nhad come somehow to hold the soul of horror, of horror disguised as\r\nmerriment. The framework of humour was there, if you understand me, but\r\nthe characters had turned sinister, and their laughter was evil.”\r\n\r\n“Can you show me this writing?”\r\n\r\nThe author shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I destroyed it,” he whispered. “But, in the end, though of course\r\nmuch perturbed about it, I persuaded myself that it was due to some\r\nafter-effect of the drug, a sort of reaction that gave a twist to my\r\nmind and made me read macabre interpretations into words and situations\r\nthat did not properly hold them.”\r\n\r\n“And, meanwhile, did the presence of this person leave you?”\r\n\r\n“No; that stayed more or less. When my mind was actively employed I\r\nforgot it, but when idle, dreaming, or doing nothing in particular,\r\nthere she was beside me, influencing my mind horribly----”\r\n\r\n“In what way, precisely?” interrupted the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Evil, scheming thoughts came to me, visions of crime, hateful pictures\r\nof wickedness, and the kind of bad imagination that so far has been\r\nforeign, indeed impossible, to my normal nature----”\r\n\r\n“The pressure of the Dark Powers upon the personality,” murmured the\r\ndoctor, making a quick note.\r\n\r\n“Eh? I didn’t quite catch----”\r\n\r\n“Pray, go on. I am merely making notes; you shall know their purport\r\nfully later.”\r\n\r\n“Even when my wife returned I was still aware of this Presence in the\r\nhouse; it associated itself with my inner personality in most intimate\r\nfashion; and outwardly I always felt oddly constrained to be polite and\r\nrespectful towards it--to open doors, provide chairs and hold myself\r\ncarefully deferential when it was about. It became very compelling at\r\nlast, and, if I failed in any little particular, I seemed to know that\r\nit pursued me about the house, from one room to another, haunting my\r\nvery soul in its inmost abode. It certainly came before my wife so far\r\nas my attentions were concerned.\r\n\r\n“But, let me first finish the story of my experimental dose, for I took\r\nit again the third night, and underwent a very similar experience,\r\ndelayed like the first in coming, and then carrying me off my feet\r\nwhen it did come with a rush of this false demon-laughter. This time,\r\nhowever, there was a reversal of the changed scale of space and\r\ntime; it shortened, instead of lengthened, so that I dressed and got\r\ndownstairs in about twenty seconds, and the couple of hours I stayed\r\nand worked in the study passed literally like a period of ten minutes.”\r\n\r\n“That is often true of an overdose,” interjected the doctor, “and you\r\nmay go a mile in a few minutes, or a few yards in a quarter of an hour.\r\nIt is quite incomprehensible to those who have never experienced it,\r\nand is a curious proof that time and space are merely forms of thought.”\r\n\r\n“This time,” Pender went on, talking more and more rapidly in his\r\nexcitement, “another extraordinary effect came to me, and I experienced\r\na curious changing of the senses, so that I perceived external things\r\nthrough one large main sense-channel instead of through the five\r\ndivisions known as sight, smell, touch, and so forth. You will, I\r\nknow, understand me when I tell you that I _heard_ sights and _saw_\r\nsounds. No language can make this comprehensible, of course, and I\r\ncan only say, for instance, that the striking of the clock I saw as a\r\nvisible picture in the air before me. I saw the sounds of the tinkling\r\nbell. And in precisely the same way I heard the colours in the room,\r\nespecially the colours of those books in the shelf behind you. Those\r\nred bindings I heard in deep sounds, and the yellow covers of the\r\nFrench bindings next to them made a shrill, piercing note not unlike\r\nthe chattering of starlings. That brown bookcase muttered, and those\r\ngreen curtains opposite kept up a constant sort of rippling sound like\r\nthe lower notes of a wood-horn. But I only was conscious of these\r\nsounds when I looked steadily at the different objects, and thought\r\nabout them. The room, you understand, was not full of a chorus of\r\nnotes; but when I concentrated my mind upon a colour, I heard, as well\r\nas saw, it.”\r\n\r\n“That is a known, though rarely-obtained, effect of _Cannabis indica_,”\r\nobserved the doctor. “And it provoked laughter again, did it?”\r\n\r\n“Only the muttering of the cupboard-bookcase made me laugh. It was so\r\nlike a great animal trying to get itself noticed, and made me think\r\nof a performing bear--which is full of a kind of pathetic humour, you\r\nknow. But this mingling of the senses produced no confusion in my\r\nbrain. On the contrary, I was unusually clear-headed and experienced\r\nan intensification of consciousness, and felt marvellously alive and\r\nkeen-minded.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, when I took up a pencil in obedience to an impulse to\r\nsketch--a talent not normally mine--I found that I could draw nothing\r\nbut heads, nothing, in fact, but one head--always the same--the head\r\nof a dark-skinned woman, with huge and terrible features and a very\r\ndrooping left eye; and so well drawn, too, that I was amazed, as you\r\nmay imagine----”\r\n\r\n“And the expression of the face----?”\r\n\r\nPender hesitated a moment for words, casting about with his hands in\r\nthe air and hunching his shoulders. A perceptible shudder ran over him.\r\n\r\n“What I can only describe as--_blackness_,” he replied in a low tone;\r\n“the face of a dark and evil soul.”\r\n\r\n“You destroyed that, too?” queried the doctor sharply.\r\n\r\n“No; I have kept the drawings,” he said, with a laugh, and rose to get\r\nthem from a drawer in the writing-desk behind him.\r\n\r\n“Here is all that remains of the pictures, you see,” he added, pushing\r\na number of loose sheets under the doctor’s eyes; “nothing but a few\r\nscrawly lines. That’s all I found the next morning. I had really drawn\r\nno heads at all--nothing but those lines and blots and wriggles. The\r\npictures were entirely subjective, and existed only in my mind which\r\nconstructed them out of a few wild strokes of the pen. Like the altered\r\nscale of space and time it was a complete delusion. These all passed,\r\nof course, with the passing of the drug’s effects. But the other thing\r\ndid not pass. I mean, the presence of that Dark Soul remained with me.\r\nIt is here still. It is real. I don’t know how I can escape from it.”\r\n\r\n“It is attached to the house, not to you personally. You must leave the\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Only I cannot afford to leave the house, for my work is my sole\r\nmeans of support, and--well, you see, since this change I cannot even\r\nwrite. They are horrible, these mirthless tales I now write, with their\r\nmockery of laughter, their diabolical suggestion. Horrible! I shall go\r\nmad if this continues.”\r\n\r\nHe screwed his face up and looked about the room as though he expected\r\nto see some haunting shape.\r\n\r\n“The influence in this house, induced by my experiment, has killed in\r\na flash, in a sudden stroke, the sources of my humour, and, though I\r\nstill go on writing funny tales--I have a certain name, you know--my\r\ninspiration has dried up, and much of what I write I have to burn--yes,\r\ndoctor, to burn, before any one sees it.”\r\n\r\n“As utterly alien to your own mind and personality?”\r\n\r\n“Utterly! As though some one else had written it----”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“And shocking!” He passed his hand over his eyes a moment and let the\r\nbreath escape softly through his teeth. “Yet most damnably clever in\r\nthe consummate way the vile suggestions are insinuated under cover of\r\na kind of high drollery. My stenographer left me, of course--and I’ve\r\nbeen afraid to take another----”\r\n\r\nJohn Silence got up and began to walk about the room leisurely without\r\nspeaking; he appeared to be examining the pictures on the wall and\r\nreading the names of the books lying about. Presently he paused on the\r\nhearthrug, with his back to the fire, and turned to look his patient\r\nquietly in the eyes. Pender’s face was grey and drawn; the hunted\r\nexpression dominated it; the long recital had told upon him.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mr. Pender,” he said, a curious glow showing about his\r\nfine, quiet face, “thank you for the sincerity and frankness of your\r\naccount. But I think now there is nothing further I need ask you.” He\r\nindulged in a long scrutiny of the author’s haggard features, drawing\r\npurposely the man’s eyes to his own and then meeting them with a look\r\nof power and confidence calculated to inspire even the feeblest soul\r\nwith courage. “And, to begin with,” he added, smiling pleasantly, “let\r\nme assure you without delay that you need have no alarm, for you are no\r\nmore insane or deluded than I myself am----”\r\n\r\nPender heaved a deep sigh and tried to return the smile.\r\n\r\n“----and this is simply a case, so far as I can judge at present, of a\r\nvery singular psychical invasion, and a very sinister one, too, if you\r\nperhaps understand what I mean----”\r\n\r\n“It’s an odd expression; you used it before, you know,” said the\r\nauthor wearily, yet eagerly listening to every word of the diagnosis,\r\nand deeply touched by the intelligent sympathy which did not at once\r\nindicate the lunatic asylum.\r\n\r\n“Possibly,” returned the other, “and an odd affliction too, you’ll\r\nallow, yet one not unknown to the nations of antiquity, nor to those\r\nmoderns, perhaps, who recognise the freedom of action under certain\r\npathogenic conditions between this world and another.”\r\n\r\n“And you think,” asked Pender hastily, “that it is all primarily due to\r\nthe _Cannabis_? There is nothing radically amiss with myself--nothing\r\nincurable, or----?”\r\n\r\n“Due entirely to the overdose,” Dr. Silence replied emphatically, “to\r\nthe drug’s direct action upon your psychical being. It rendered you\r\nultra-sensitive and made you respond to an increased rate of vibration.\r\nAnd, let me tell you, Mr. Pender, that your experiment might have had\r\nresults far more dire. It has brought you into touch with a somewhat\r\nsingular class of Invisible, but of one, I think, chiefly human in\r\ncharacter. You might, however, just as easily have been drawn out of\r\nhuman range altogether, and the results of such a contingency would\r\nhave been exceedingly terrible. Indeed, you would not now be here to\r\ntell the tale. I need not alarm you on that score, but mention it as\r\na warning you will not misunderstand or underrate after what you have\r\nbeen through.\r\n\r\n“You look puzzled. You do not quite gather what I am driving at; and\r\nit is not to be expected that you should, for you, I suppose, are\r\nthe nominal Christian with the nominal Christian’s lofty standard of\r\nethics, and his utter ignorance of spiritual possibilities. Beyond\r\na somewhat childish understanding of ‘spiritual wickedness in high\r\nplaces,’ you probably have no conception of what is possible once you\r\nbreak down the slender gulf that is mercifully fixed between you and\r\nthat Outer World. But my studies and training have taken me far outside\r\nthese orthodox trips, and I have made experiments that I could scarcely\r\nspeak to you about in language that would be intelligible to you.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment to note the breathless interest of Pender’s face and\r\nmanner. Every word he uttered was calculated; he knew exactly the value\r\nand effect of the emotions he desired to waken in the heart of the\r\nafflicted being before him.\r\n\r\n“And from certain knowledge I have gained through various experiences,”\r\nhe continued calmly, “I can diagnose your case as I said before to be\r\none of psychical invasion.”\r\n\r\n“And the nature of this--er--invasion?” stammered the bewildered writer\r\nof humorous tales.\r\n\r\n“There is no reason why I should not say at once that I do not yet\r\nquite know,” replied Dr. Silence. “I may first have to make one or two\r\nexperiments----”\r\n\r\n“On me?” gasped Pender, catching his breath.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly,” the doctor said, with a grave smile, “but with your\r\nassistance, perhaps. I shall want to test the conditions of the\r\nhouse--to ascertain, if possible, the character of the forces, of this\r\nstrange personality that has been haunting you----”\r\n\r\n“At present you have no idea exactly who--what--why----” asked the\r\nother in a wild flurry of interest, dread and amazement.\r\n\r\n“I have a very good idea, but no proof rather,” returned the doctor.\r\n“The effects of the drug in altering the scale of time and space, and\r\nmerging the senses have nothing primarily to do with the invasion. They\r\ncome to any one who is fool enough to take an experimental dose. It is\r\nthe other features of your case that are unusual. You see, you are now\r\nin touch with certain violent emotions, desires, purposes, still active\r\nin this house, that were produced in the past by some powerful and evil\r\npersonality that lived here. How long ago, or why they still persist\r\nso forcibly, I cannot positively say. But I should judge that they are\r\nmerely forces acting automatically with the momentum of their terrific\r\noriginal impetus.”\r\n\r\n“Not directed by a living being, a conscious will, you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly not--but none the less dangerous on that account, and more\r\ndifficult to deal with. I cannot explain to you in a few minutes the\r\nnature of such things, for you have not made the studies that would\r\nenable you to follow me; but I have reason to believe that on the\r\ndissolution at death of a human being, its forces may still persist\r\nand continue to act in a blind, unconscious fashion. As a rule they\r\nspeedily dissipate themselves, but in the case of a very powerful\r\npersonality they may last a long time. And, in some cases--of which I\r\nincline to think this is one--these forces may coalesce with certain\r\nnon-human entities who thus continue their life indefinitely and\r\nincrease their strength to an unbelievable degree. If the original\r\npersonality was evil, the beings attracted to the left-over forces\r\nwill also be evil. In this case, I think there has been an unusual and\r\ndreadful aggrandisement of the thoughts and purposes left behind long\r\nago by a woman of consummate wickedness and great personal power of\r\ncharacter and intellect. Now, do you begin to see what I am driving at\r\na little?”\r\n\r\nPender stared fixedly at his companion, plain horror showing in his\r\neyes. But he found nothing to say, and the doctor continued--\r\n\r\n“In your case, predisposed by the action of the drug, you have\r\nexperienced the rush of these forces in undiluted strength. They\r\nwholly obliterate in you the sense of humour, fancy, imagination,--all\r\nthat makes for cheerfulness and hope. They seek, though perhaps\r\nautomatically only, to oust your own thoughts and establish themselves\r\nin their place. You are the victim of a psychical invasion. At the same\r\ntime, you have become clairvoyant in the true sense. You are also a\r\nclairvoyant victim.”\r\n\r\nPender mopped his face and sighed. He left his chair and went over to\r\nthe fireplace to warm himself.\r\n\r\n“You must think me a quack to talk like this, or a madman,” laughed\r\nDr. Silence. “But never mind that. I have come to help you, and I can\r\nhelp you if you will do what I tell you. It is very simple: you must\r\nleave this house at once. Oh, never mind the difficulties; we will deal\r\nwith those together. I can place another house at your disposal, or\r\nI would take the lease here off your hands, and later have it pulled\r\ndown. Your case interests me greatly, and I mean to see you through, so\r\nthat you have no anxiety, and can drop back into your old groove of\r\nwork to-morrow! The drug has provided you, and therefore me, with a\r\nshort-cut to a very interesting experience. I am grateful to you.”\r\n\r\nThe author poked the fire vigorously, emotion rising in him like a\r\ntide. He glanced towards the door nervously.\r\n\r\n“There is no need to alarm your wife or to tell her the details of\r\nour conversation,” pursued the other quietly. “Let her know that you\r\nwill soon be in possession again of your sense of humour and your\r\nhealth, and explain that I am lending you another house for six months.\r\nMeanwhile I may have the right to use this house for a night or two for\r\nmy experiment. Is that understood between us?”\r\n\r\n“I can only thank you from the bottom of my heart,” stammered Pender,\r\nunable to find words to express his gratitude.\r\n\r\nThen he hesitated for a moment, searching the doctor’s face anxiously.\r\n\r\n“And your experiment with the house?” he said at length.\r\n\r\n“Of the simplest character, my dear Mr. Pender. Although I am myself an\r\nartificially trained psychic, and consequently aware of the presence\r\nof discarnate entities as a rule, I have so far felt nothing here at\r\nall. This makes me sure that the forces acting here are of an unusual\r\ndescription. What I propose to do is to make an experiment with a view\r\nof drawing out this evil, coaxing it from its lair, so to speak, in\r\norder that it may _exhaust itself through me_ and become dissipated for\r\never. I have already been inoculated,” he added; “I consider myself to\r\nbe immune.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens above!” gasped the author, collapsing on to a chair.\r\n\r\n“Hell beneath! might be a more appropriate exclamation,” the doctor\r\nlaughed. “But, seriously, Mr. Pender, this is what I propose to\r\ndo--with your permission.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course,” cried the other, “you have my permission and my\r\nbest wishes for success. I can see no possible objection, but----”\r\n\r\n“But what?”\r\n\r\n“I pray to Heaven you will not undertake this experiment alone, will\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear, no; not alone.”\r\n\r\n“You will take a companion with good nerves, and reliable in case of\r\ndisaster, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I shall bring two companions,” the doctor said.\r\n\r\n“Ah, that’s better. I feel easier. I am sure you must have among your\r\nacquaintances men who----”\r\n\r\n“I shall not think of bringing men, Mr. Pender.”\r\n\r\nThe other looked up sharply.\r\n\r\n“No, or women either; or children.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand. Who will you bring, then?”\r\n\r\n“Animals,” explained the doctor, unable to prevent a smile at his\r\ncompanion’s expression of surprise--“two animals, a cat and a dog.”\r\n\r\nPender stared as if his eyes would drop out upon the floor, and then\r\nled the way without another word into the adjoining room where his wife\r\nwas awaiting them for tea.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA few days later the humorist and his wife, with minds greatly\r\nrelieved, moved into a small furnished house placed at their free\r\ndisposal in another part of London; and John Silence, intent upon his\r\napproaching experiment, made ready to spend a night in the empty house\r\non the top of Putney Hill. Only two rooms were prepared for occupation:\r\nthe study on the ground floor and the bedroom immediately above it;\r\nall other doors were to be locked, and no servant was to be left in\r\nthe house. The motor had orders to call for him at nine o’clock the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nAnd, meanwhile, his secretary had instructions to look up the past\r\nhistory and associations of the place, and learn everything he could\r\nconcerning the character of former occupants, recent or remote.\r\n\r\nThe animals, by whose sensitiveness he intended to test any unusual\r\nconditions in the atmosphere of the building, Dr. Silence selected\r\nwith care and judgment. He believed (and had already made curious\r\nexperiments to prove it) that animals were more often, and more truly,\r\nclairvoyant than human beings. Many of them, he felt convinced,\r\npossessed powers of perception far superior to that mere keenness of\r\nthe senses common to all dwellers in the wilds where the senses grow\r\nspecially alert; they had what he termed “animal clairvoyance,” and\r\nfrom his experiments with horses, dogs, cats, and even birds, he had\r\ndrawn certain deductions, which, however, need not be referred to in\r\ndetail here.\r\n\r\nCats, in particular, he believed, were almost continuously conscious of\r\na larger field of vision, too detailed even for a photographic camera,\r\nand quite beyond the reach of normal human organs. He had, further,\r\nobserved that while dogs were usually terrified in the presence of such\r\nphenomena, cats on the other hand were soothed and satisfied. They\r\nwelcomed manifestations as something belonging peculiarly to their own\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nHe selected his animals, therefore, with wisdom so that they might\r\nafford a differing test, each in its own way, and that one should not\r\nmerely communicate its own excitement to the other. He took a dog and a\r\ncat.\r\n\r\nThe cat he chose, now full grown, had lived with him since kittenhood,\r\na kittenhood of perplexing sweetness and audacious mischief. Wayward\r\nit was and fanciful, ever playing its own mysterious games in the\r\ncorners of the room, jumping at invisible nothings, leaping sideways\r\ninto the air and falling with tiny mocassined feet on to another part\r\nof the carpet, yet with an air of dignified earnestness which showed\r\nthat the performance was necessary to its own well-being, and not done\r\nmerely to impress a stupid human audience. In the middle of elaborate\r\nwashing it would look up, startled, as though to stare at the approach\r\nof some Invisible, cocking its little head sideways and putting out a\r\nvelvet pad to inspect cautiously. Then it would get absent-minded, and\r\nstare with equal intentness in another direction (just to confuse the\r\nonlookers), and suddenly go on furiously washing its body again, but in\r\nquite a new place. Except for a white patch on its breast it was coal\r\nblack. And its name was--Smoke.\r\n\r\n“Smoke” described its temperament as well as its appearance. Its\r\nmovements, its individuality, its posing as a little furry mass of\r\nconcealed mysteries, its elfin-like elusiveness, all combined to\r\njustify its name; and a subtle painter might have pictured it as a\r\nwisp of floating smoke, the fire below betraying itself at two points\r\nonly--the glowing eyes.\r\n\r\nAll its forces ran to intelligence--secret intelligence, the wordless,\r\nincalculable intuition of the Cat. It was, indeed, _the_ cat for the\r\nbusiness in hand.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the dog was not so simple, for the doctor owned many;\r\nbut after much deliberation he chose a collie, called Flame from his\r\nyellow coat. True, it was a trifle old, and stiff in the joints, and\r\neven beginning to grow deaf, but, on the other hand, it was a very\r\nparticular friend of Smoke’s, and had fathered it from kittenhood\r\nupwards so that a subtle understanding existed between them. It was\r\nthis that turned the balance in its favour, this and its courage.\r\nMoreover, though good-tempered, it was a terrible fighter, and its\r\nanger when provoked by a righteous cause was a fury of fire, and\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nIt had come to him quite young, straight from the shepherd, with the\r\nair of the hills yet in its nostrils, and was then little more than\r\nskin and bones and teeth. For a collie it was sturdily built, its nose\r\nblunter than most, its yellow hair stiff rather than silky, and it had\r\nfull eyes, unlike the slit eyes of its breed. Only its master could\r\ntouch it, for it ignored strangers, and despised their pattings--when\r\nany dared to pat it. There was something patriarchal about the old\r\nbeast. He was in earnest, and went through life with tremendous\r\nenergy and big things in view, as though he had the reputation of his\r\nwhole race to uphold. And to watch him fighting against odds was to\r\nunderstand why he was terrible.\r\n\r\nIn his relations with Smoke he was always absurdly gentle; also he\r\nwas fatherly; and at the same time betrayed a certain diffidence or\r\nshyness. He recognised that Smoke called for strong yet respectful\r\nmanagement. The cat’s circuitous methods puzzled him, and his elaborate\r\npretences perhaps shocked the dog’s liking for direct, undisguised\r\naction. Yet, while he failed to comprehend these tortuous feline\r\nmysteries, he was never contemptuous or condescending; and he presided\r\nover the safety of his furry black friend somewhat as a father,\r\nloving but intuitive, might superintend the vagaries of a wayward and\r\ntalented child. And, in return, Smoke rewarded him with exhibitions of\r\nfascinating and audacious mischief.\r\n\r\nAnd these brief descriptions of their characters are necessary for the\r\nproper understanding of what subsequently took place.\r\n\r\nWith Smoke sleeping in the folds of his fur coat, and the collie lying\r\nwatchful on the seat opposite, John Silence went down in his motor\r\nafter dinner on the night of November 15th.\r\n\r\nAnd the fog was so dense that they were obliged to travel at quarter\r\nspeed the entire way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was after ten o’clock when he dismissed the motor and entered the\r\ndingy little house with the latchkey provided by Pender. He found the\r\nhall gas turned low, and a fire in the study. Books and food had also\r\nbeen placed ready by the servant according to instructions. Coils of\r\nfog rushed in after him through the opened door and filled the hall and\r\npassage with its cold discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe first thing Dr. Silence did was to lock up Smoke in the study with\r\na saucer of milk before the fire, and then make a search of the house\r\nwith Flame. The dog ran cheerfully behind him all the way while he\r\ntried the doors of the other rooms to make sure they were locked. He\r\nnosed about into corners and made little excursions on his own account.\r\nHis manner was expectant. He knew there must be something unusual about\r\nthe proceeding, because it was contrary to the habits of his whole\r\nlife not to be asleep at this hour on the mat in front of the fire. He\r\nkept looking up into his master’s face, as door after door was tried,\r\nwith an expression of intelligent sympathy, but at the same time a\r\ncertain air of disapproval. Yet everything his master did was good in\r\nhis eyes, and he betrayed as little impatience as possible with all\r\nthis unnecessary journeying to and fro. If the doctor was pleased to\r\nplay this sort of game at such an hour of the night, it was surely not\r\nfor him to object. So he played it too; and was very busy and earnest\r\nabout it into the bargain.\r\n\r\nAfter an uneventful search they came down again to the study, and here\r\nDr. Silence discovered Smoke washing his face calmly in front of the\r\nfire. The saucer of milk was licked dry and clean; the preliminary\r\nexamination that cats always make in new surroundings had evidently\r\nbeen satisfactorily concluded. He drew an arm-chair up to the fire,\r\nstirred the coals into a blaze, arranged the table and lamp to his\r\nsatisfaction for reading, and then prepared surreptitiously to watch\r\nthe animals. He wished to observe them carefully without their being\r\naware of it.\r\n\r\nNow, in spite of their respective ages, it was the regular custom of\r\nthese two to play together every night before sleep. Smoke always made\r\nthe advances, beginning with grave impudence to pat the dog’s tail, and\r\nFlame played cumbrously, with condescension. It was his duty, rather\r\nthan pleasure; he was glad when it was over, and sometimes he was very\r\ndetermined and refused to play at all.\r\n\r\nAnd this night was one of the occasions on which he was firm.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, looking cautiously over the top of his book, watched\r\nthe cat begin the performance. It started by gazing with an innocent\r\nexpression at the dog where he lay with nose on paws and eyes wide open\r\nin the middle of the floor. Then it got up and made as though it meant\r\nto walk to the door, going deliberately and very softly. Flame’s eyes\r\nfollowed it until it was beyond the range of sight, and then the cat\r\nturned sharply and began patting his tail tentatively with one paw.\r\nThe tail moved slightly in reply, and Smoke changed paws and tapped\r\nit again. The dog, however, did not rise to play as was his wont, and\r\nthe cat fell to patting it briskly with both paws. Flame still lay\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nThis puzzled and bored the cat, and it went round and stared hard into\r\nits friend’s face to see what was the matter. Perhaps some inarticulate\r\nmessage flashed from the dog’s eyes into its own little brain, making\r\nit understand that the programme for the night had better not begin\r\nwith play. Perhaps it only realised that its friend was immovable. But,\r\nwhatever the reason, its usual persistence thenceforward deserted it,\r\nand it made no further attempts at persuasion. Smoke yielded at once to\r\nthe dog’s mood; it sat down where it was and began to wash.\r\n\r\nBut the washing, the doctor noted, was by no means its real purpose;\r\nit only used it to mask something else; it stopped at the most busy\r\nand furious moments and began to stare about the room. Its thoughts\r\nwandered absurdly. It peered intently at the curtains; at the shadowy\r\ncorners; at empty space above; leaving its body in curiously awkward\r\npositions for whole minutes together. Then it turned sharply and stared\r\nwith a sudden signal of intelligence at the dog, and Flame at once\r\nrose somewhat stiffly to his feet and began to wander aimlessly and\r\nrestlessly to and fro about the floor. Smoke followed him, padding\r\nquietly at his heels. Between them they made what seemed to be a\r\ndeliberate search of the room.\r\n\r\nAnd, here, as he watched them, noting carefully every detail of\r\nthe performance over the top of his book, yet making no effort to\r\ninterfere, it seemed to the doctor that the first beginnings of a\r\nfaint distress betrayed themselves in the collie, and in the cat the\r\nstirrings of a vague excitement.\r\n\r\nHe observed them closely. The fog was thick in the air, and the\r\ntobacco smoke from his pipe added to its density; the furniture at the\r\nfar end stood mistily, and where the shadows congregated in hanging\r\nclouds under the ceiling, it was difficult to see clearly at all; the\r\nlamplight only reached to a level of five feet from the floor, above\r\nwhich came layers of comparative darkness, so that the room appeared\r\ntwice as lofty as it actually was. By means of the lamp and the fire,\r\nhowever, the carpet was everywhere clearly visible.\r\n\r\nThe animals made their silent tour of the floor, sometimes the dog\r\nleading, sometimes the cat; occasionally they looked at one another\r\nas though exchanging signals; and once or twice, in spite of the\r\nlimited space, he lost sight of one or other among the fog and the\r\nshadows. Their curiosity, it appeared to him, was something more than\r\nthe excitement lurking in the unknown territory of a strange room;\r\nyet, so far, it was impossible to test this, and he purposely kept his\r\nmind quietly receptive lest the smallest mental excitement on his part\r\nshould communicate itself to the animals and thus destroy the value of\r\ntheir independent behaviour.\r\n\r\nThey made a very thorough journey, leaving no piece of furniture\r\nunexamined, or unsmelt. Flame led the way, walking slowly with lowered\r\nhead, and Smoke followed demurely at his heels, making a transparent\r\npretence of not being interested, yet missing nothing. And, at length,\r\nthey returned, the old collie first, and came to rest on the mat\r\nbefore the fire. Flame rested his muzzle on his master’s knee, smiling\r\nbeatifically while he patted the yellow head and spoke his name; and\r\nSmoke, coming a little later, pretending he came by chance, looked from\r\nthe empty saucer to his face, lapped up the milk when it was given him\r\nto the last drop, and then sprang upon his knees and curled round for\r\nthe sleep it had fully earned and intended to enjoy.\r\n\r\nSilence descended upon the room. Only the breathing of the dog upon the\r\nmat came through the deep stillness, like the pulse of time marking\r\nthe minutes; and the steady drip, drip of the fog outside upon the\r\nwindow-ledges dismally testified to the inclemency of the night beyond.\r\nAnd the soft crashings of the coals as the fire settled down into the\r\ngrate became less and less audible as the fire sank and the flames\r\nresigned their fierceness.\r\n\r\nIt was now well after eleven o’clock, and Dr. Silence devoted himself\r\nagain to his book. He read the words on the printed page and took\r\nin their meaning superficially, yet without starting into life\r\nthe correlations of thought and suggestion that should accompany\r\ninteresting reading. Underneath, all the while, his mental energies\r\nwere absorbed in watching, listening, waiting for what might come.\r\nHe was not over sanguine himself, yet he did not wish to be taken\r\nby surprise. Moreover, the animals, his sensitive barometers, had\r\nincontinently gone to sleep.\r\n\r\nAfter reading a dozen pages, however, he realised that his mind was\r\nreally occupied in reviewing the features of Pender’s extraordinary\r\nstory, and that it was no longer necessary to steady his imagination\r\nby studying the dull paragraphs detailed in the pages before him. He\r\nlaid down his book accordingly, and allowed his thoughts to dwell upon\r\nthe features of the Case. Speculations as to the meaning, however, he\r\nrigorously suppressed, knowing that such thoughts would act upon his\r\nimagination like wind upon the glowing embers of a fire.\r\n\r\nAs the night wore on the silence grew deeper and deeper, and only\r\nat rare intervals he heard the sound of wheels on the main road a\r\nhundred yards away, where the horses went at a walking pace owing to\r\nthe density of the fog. The echo of pedestrian footsteps no longer\r\nreached him, the clamour of occasional voices no longer came down the\r\nside street The night, muffled by fog, shrouded by veils of ultimate\r\nmystery, hung about the haunted villa like a doom. Nothing in the house\r\nstirred. Stillness, in a thick blanket, lay over the upper storeys.\r\nOnly the mist in the room grew more dense, he thought, and the damp\r\ncold more penetrating. Certainly, from time to time, he shivered.\r\n\r\nThe collie, now deep in slumber, moved occasionally,--grunted, sighed,\r\nor twitched his legs in dreams. Smoke lay on his knees, a pool of warm,\r\nblack fur, only the closest observation detecting the movement of his\r\nsleek sides. It was difficult to distinguish exactly where his head and\r\nbody joined in that circle of glistening hair; only a black satin nose\r\nand a tiny tip of pink tongue betrayed the secret.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence watched him, and felt comfortable. The collie’s breathing\r\nwas soothing. The fire was well built, and would burn for another two\r\nhours without attention. He was not conscious of the least nervousness.\r\nHe particularly wished to remain in his ordinary and normal state of\r\nmind, and to force nothing. If sleep came naturally, he would let it\r\ncome--and even welcome it. The coldness of the room, when the fire\r\ndied down later, would be sure to wake him again; and it would then be\r\ntime enough to carry these sleeping barometers up to bed. From various\r\npsychic premonitions he knew quite well that the night would not pass\r\nwithout adventure; but he did not wish to force its arrival; and he\r\nwished to remain normal, and let the animals remain normal, so that,\r\nwhen it came, it would be unattended by excitement or by any straining\r\nof the attention. Many experiments had made him wise. And, for the\r\nrest, he had no fear.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after a time, he did fall asleep as he had expected, and\r\nthe last thing he remembered, before oblivion slipped up over his eyes\r\nlike soft wool, was the picture of Flame stretching all four legs at\r\nonce, and sighing noisily as he sought a more comfortable position for\r\nhis paws and muzzle upon the mat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a good deal later when he became aware that a weight lay upon\r\nhis chest, and that something was pencilling over his face and mouth. A\r\nsoft touch on the cheek woke him. Something was patting him.\r\n\r\nHe sat up with a jerk, and found himself staring straight into a pair\r\nof brilliant eyes, half green, half black. Smoke’s face lay level with\r\nhis own; and the cat had climbed up with its front paws upon his chest.\r\n\r\nThe lamp had burned low and the fire was nearly out, yet Dr. Silence\r\nsaw in a moment that the cat was in an excited state. It kneaded with\r\nits front paws into his chest, shifting from one to the other. He felt\r\nthem prodding against him. It lifted a leg very carefully and patted\r\nhis cheek gingerly. Its fur, he saw, was standing ridgewise upon its\r\nback; the ears were flattened back somewhat; the tail was switching\r\nsharply. The cat, of course, had wakened him with a purpose, and the\r\ninstant he realised this, he set it upon the arm of the chair and\r\nsprang up with a quick turn to face the empty room behind him. By some\r\ncurious instinct, his arms of their own accord assumed an attitude\r\nof defence in front of him, as though to ward off something that\r\nthreatened his safety. Yet nothing was visible. Only shapes of fog hung\r\nabout rather heavily in the air, moving slightly to and fro.\r\n\r\nHis mind was now fully alert, and the last vestiges of sleep gone. He\r\nturned the lamp higher and peered about him. Two things he became aware\r\nof at once: one, that Smoke, while excited, was _pleasurably_ excited;\r\nthe other, that the collie was no longer visible upon the mat at his\r\nfeet. He had crept away to the corner of the wall farthest from the\r\nwindow, and lay watching the room with wide-open eyes, in which lurked\r\nplainly something of alarm.\r\n\r\nSomething in the dog’s behaviour instantly struck Dr. Silence as\r\nunusual, and, calling him by name, he moved across to pat him. Flame\r\ngot up, wagged his tail, and came over slowly to the rug, uttering a\r\nlow sound that was half growl, half whine. He was evidently perturbed\r\nabout something, and his master was proceeding to administer comfort\r\nwhen his attention was suddenly drawn to the antics of his other\r\nfour-footed companion, the cat.\r\n\r\nAnd what he saw filled him with something like amazement.\r\n\r\nSmoke had jumped down from the back of the arm-chair and now occupied\r\nthe middle of the carpet, where, with tail erect and legs stiff as\r\nramrods, it was steadily pacing backwards and forwards in a narrow\r\nspace, uttering, as it did so, those curious little guttural sounds of\r\npleasure that only an animal of the feline species knows how to make\r\nexpressive of supreme happiness. Its stiffened legs and arched back\r\nmade it appear larger than usual, and the black visage wore a smile of\r\nbeatific joy. Its eyes blazed magnificently; it was in an ecstasy.\r\n\r\nAt the end of every few paces it turned sharply and stalked back again\r\nalong the same line, padding softly, and purring like a roll of little\r\nmuffled drums. It behaved precisely as though it were rubbing against\r\nthe ankles of some one who remained invisible. A thrill ran down the\r\ndoctor’s spine as he stood and stared. His experiment was growing\r\ninteresting at last.\r\n\r\nHe called the collie’s attention to his friend’s performance to see\r\nwhether he too was aware of anything standing there upon the carpet;\r\nand the dog’s behaviour was significant and corroborative. He came\r\nas far as his master’s knees and then stopped dead, refusing to\r\ninvestigate closely. In vain Dr. Silence urged him; he wagged his\r\ntail, whined a little, and stood in a half-crouching attitude, staring\r\nalternately at the cat and at his master’s face. He was, apparently,\r\nboth puzzled and alarmed, and the whine went deeper and deeper down\r\ninto his throat till it changed into an ugly snarl of awakening anger.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor called to him in a tone of command he had never known\r\nto be disregarded; but still the dog, though springing up in response,\r\ndeclined to move nearer. He made tentative motions, pranced a little\r\nlike a dog about to take to water, pretended to bark, and ran to and\r\nfro on the carpet. So far there was no actual fear in his manner, but\r\nhe was uneasy and anxious, and nothing would induce him to go within\r\ntouching distance of the walking cat. Once he made a complete circuit,\r\nbut always carefully out of reach; and in the end he returned to his\r\nmaster’s legs and rubbed vigorously against him. Flame did not like the\r\nperformance at all: that much was quite clear.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes John Silence watched the performance of the cat\r\nwith profound attention and without interfering. Then he called to the\r\nanimal by name.\r\n\r\n“Smoke, you mysterious beastie, what in the world are you about?” he\r\nsaid, in a coaxing tone.\r\n\r\nThe cat looked up at him for a moment, smiling in its ecstasy, blinking\r\nits eyes, but too happy to pause. He spoke to it again. He called to it\r\nseveral times, and each time it turned upon him its blazing eyes, drunk\r\nwith inner delight, opening and shutting its lips, its body large and\r\nrigid with excitement. Yet it never for one instant paused in its short\r\njourneys to and fro.\r\n\r\nHe noted exactly what it did: it walked, he saw, the same number of\r\npaces each time, some six or seven steps, and then it turned sharply\r\nand retraced them. By the pattern of the great roses in the carpet\r\nhe measured it. It kept to the same direction and the same line. It\r\nbehaved precisely as though it were rubbing against something solid.\r\nUndoubtedly, there was something standing there on that strip of\r\ncarpet, something invisible to the doctor, something that alarmed the\r\ndog, yet caused the cat unspeakable pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Smokie!” he called again, “Smokie, you black mystery, what is it\r\nexcites you so?”\r\n\r\nAgain the cat looked up at him for a brief second, and then continued\r\nits sentry-walk, blissfully happy, intensely preoccupied. And, for an\r\ninstant, as he watched it, the doctor was aware that a faint uneasiness\r\nstirred in the depths of his own being, focusing itself for the moment\r\nupon this curious behaviour of the uncanny creature before him.\r\n\r\nThere rose in him quite a new realisation of the mystery connected\r\nwith the whole feline tribe, but especially with that common member\r\nof it, the domestic cat--their hidden lives, their strange aloofness,\r\ntheir incalculable subtlety. How utterly remote from anything that\r\nhuman beings understood lay the sources of their elusive activities.\r\nAs he watched the indescribable bearing of the little creature mincing\r\nalong the strip of carpet under his eyes, coquetting with the powers\r\nof darkness, welcoming, maybe, some fearsome visitor, there stirred in\r\nhis heart a feeling strangely akin to awe. Its indifference to human\r\nkind, its serene superiority to the obvious, struck him forcibly with\r\nfresh meaning; so remote, so inaccessible seemed the secret purposes of\r\nits real life, so alien to the blundering honesty of other animals.\r\nIts absolute poise of bearing brought into his mind the opium-eater’s\r\nwords that “no dignity is perfect which does not at some point ally\r\nitself with the mysterious”; and he became suddenly aware that the\r\npresence of the dog in this foggy, haunted room on the top of Putney\r\nHill was uncommonly welcome to him. He was glad to feel that Flame’s\r\ndependable personality was with him. The savage growling at his heels\r\nwas a pleasant sound. He was glad to hear it. That marching cat made\r\nhim uneasy.\r\n\r\nFinding that Smoke paid no further attention to his words, the doctor\r\ndecided upon action. Would it rub against his leg, too? He would take\r\nit by surprise and see.\r\n\r\nHe stepped quickly forward and placed himself upon the exact strip of\r\ncarpet where it walked.\r\n\r\nBut no cat is ever taken by surprise! The moment he occupied the space\r\nof the Intruder, setting his feet on the woven roses midway in the line\r\nof travel, Smoke suddenly stopped purring and sat down. It lifted up\r\nits face with the most innocent stare imaginable of its green eyes. He\r\ncould have sworn it laughed. It was a perfect child again. In a single\r\nsecond it had resumed its simple, domestic manner; and it gazed at him\r\nin such a way that he almost felt Smoke was the normal being, and _his_\r\nwas the eccentric behaviour that was being watched. It was consummate,\r\nthe manner in which it brought about this change so easily and so\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n“Superb little actor!” he laughed in spite of himself, and stooped to\r\nstroke the shining black back. But, in a flash, as he touched its fur,\r\nthe cat turned and spat at him viciously, striking at his hand with\r\none paw. Then, with a hurried scutter of feet, it shot like a shadow\r\nacross the floor and a moment later was calmly sitting over by the\r\nwindow-curtains washing its face as though nothing interested it in the\r\nwhole world but the cleanness of its cheeks and whiskers.\r\n\r\nJohn Silence straightened himself up and drew a long breath. He\r\nrealised that the performance was temporarily at an end. The\r\ncollie, meanwhile, who had watched the whole proceeding with marked\r\ndisapproval, had now lain down again upon the mat by the fire, no\r\nlonger growling. It seemed to the doctor just as though something that\r\nhad entered the room while he slept, alarming the dog, yet bringing\r\nhappiness to the cat, had now gone out again, leaving all as it was\r\nbefore. Whatever it was that excited its blissful attentions had\r\nretreated for the moment.\r\n\r\nHe realised this intuitively. Smoke evidently realised it, too, for\r\npresently he deigned to march back to the fireplace and jump upon his\r\nmaster’s knees. Dr. Silence, patient and determined, settled down once\r\nmore to his book. The animals soon slept; the fire blazed cheerfully;\r\nand the cold fog from outside poured into the room through every\r\navailable chink and cranny.\r\n\r\nFor a long time silence and peace reigned in the room and Dr. Silence\r\navailed himself of the quietness to make careful notes of what had\r\nhappened. He entered for future use in other cases an exhaustive\r\nanalysis of what he had observed, especially with regard to the\r\neffect upon the two animals. It is impossible here, nor would it be\r\nintelligible to the reader unversed in the knowledge of the region\r\nknown to a scientifically trained psychic like Dr. Silence, to\r\ndetail these observations. But to him it was clear, up to a certain\r\npoint--and for the rest he must still wait and watch. So far, at least,\r\nhe realised that while he slept in the chair--that is, while his will\r\nwas dormant--the room had suffered intrusion from what he recognised\r\nas an intensely active Force, and might later be forced to acknowledge\r\nas something more than merely a blind force, namely, a distinct\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nSo far it had affected himself scarcely at all, but had acted directly\r\nupon the simpler organisms of the animals. It stimulated keenly the\r\ncentres of the cat’s psychic being, inducing a state of instant\r\nhappiness (intensifying its consciousness probably in the same way\r\na drug or stimulant intensifies that of a human being); whereas it\r\nalarmed the less sensitive dog, causing it to feel a vague apprehension\r\nand distress.\r\n\r\nHis own sudden action and exhibition of energy had served to disperse\r\nit temporarily, yet he felt convinced--the indications were not lacking\r\neven while he sat there making notes--that it still remained near to\r\nhim, conditionally if not spatially, and was, as it were, gathering\r\nforce for a second attack.\r\n\r\nAnd, further, he intuitively understood that the relations between the\r\ntwo animals had undergone a subtle change: that the cat had become\r\nimmeasurably superior, confident, sure of itself in its own peculiar\r\nregion, whereas Flame had been weakened by an attack he could not\r\ncomprehend and knew not how to reply to. Though not yet afraid, he was\r\ndefiant--ready to act against a fear that he felt to be approaching. He\r\nwas no longer fatherly and protective towards the cat. Smoke held the\r\nkey to the situation; and both he and the cat knew it.\r\n\r\nThus, as the minutes passed, John Silence sat and waited, keenly on\r\nthe alert, wondering how soon the attack would be renewed, and at what\r\npoint it would be diverted from the animals and directed upon himself.\r\n\r\nThe book lay on the floor beside him, his notes were complete. With one\r\nhand on the cat’s fur, and the dog’s front paws resting against his\r\nfeet, the three of them dozed comfortably before the hot fire while the\r\nnight wore on and the silence deepened towards midnight.\r\n\r\nIt was well after one o’clock in the morning when Dr. Silence turned\r\nthe lamp out and lighted the candle preparatory to going up to bed.\r\nThen Smoke suddenly woke with a loud sharp purr and sat up. It neither\r\nstretched, washed nor turned: it listened. And the doctor, watching it,\r\nrealised that a certain indefinable change had come about that very\r\nmoment in the room. A swift readjustment of the forces within the four\r\nwalls had taken place--a new disposition of their personal equations.\r\nThe balance was destroyed, the former harmony gone. Smoke, most\r\nsensitive of barometers, had been the first to feel it, but the dog was\r\nnot slow to follow suit, for on looking down he noted that Flame was no\r\nlonger asleep. He was lying with eyes wide open, and that same instant\r\nhe sat up on his great haunches and began to growl.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence was in the act of taking the matches to re-light the lamp\r\nwhen an audible movement in the room behind made him pause. Smoke\r\nleaped down from his knee and moved forward a few paces across the\r\ncarpet. Then it stopped and stared fixedly; and the doctor stood up on\r\nthe rug to watch.\r\n\r\nAs he rose the sound was repeated, and he discovered that it was not\r\nin the room as he first thought, but outside, and that it came from\r\nmore directions than one. There was a rushing, sweeping noise against\r\nthe window-panes, and simultaneously a sound of something brushing\r\nagainst the door--out in the hall. Smoke advanced sedately across the\r\ncarpet, twitching his tail, and sat down within a foot of the door. The\r\ninfluence that had destroyed the harmonious conditions of the room had\r\napparently moved in advance of its cause. Clearly, something was about\r\nto happen.\r\n\r\nFor the first time that night John Silence hesitated; the thought of\r\nthat dark narrow hall-way, choked with fog, and destitute of human\r\ncomfort, was unpleasant. He became aware of a faint creeping of his\r\nflesh. He knew, of course, that the actual opening of the door was not\r\nnecessary to the invasion of the room that was about to take place,\r\nsince neither doors nor windows, nor any other solid barriers could\r\ninterpose an obstacle to what was seeking entrance. Yet the opening of\r\nthe door would be significant and symbolic, and he distinctly shrank\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nBut for a moment only. Smoke, turning with a show of impatience,\r\nrecalled him to his purpose, and he moved past the sitting, watching\r\ncreature, and deliberately opened the door to its full width.\r\n\r\nWhat subsequently happened, happened in the feeble and flickering light\r\nof the solitary candle on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nThrough the opened door he saw the hall, dimly lit and thick with fog.\r\nNothing, of course, was visible--nothing but the hat-stand, the African\r\nspears in dark lines upon the wall and the high-backed wooden chair\r\nstanding grotesquely underneath on the oilcloth floor. For one instant\r\nthe fog seemed to move and thicken oddly; but he set that down to the\r\nscore of the imagination. The door had opened upon nothing.\r\n\r\nYet Smoke apparently thought otherwise, and the deep growling of the\r\ncollie from the mat at the back of the room seemed to confirm his\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nFor, proud and self-possessed, the cat had again risen to his feet,\r\nand having advanced to the door, was now ushering some one slowly into\r\nthe room. Nothing could have been more evident. He paced from side to\r\nside, bowing his little head with great _empressement_ and holding his\r\nstiffened tail aloft like a flagstaff. He turned this way and that,\r\nmincing to and fro, and showing signs of supreme satisfaction. He was\r\nin his element. He welcomed the intrusion, and apparently reckoned that\r\nhis companions, the doctor and the dog, would welcome it likewise.\r\n\r\nThe Intruder had returned for a second attack.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence moved slowly backwards and took up his position on the\r\nhearthrug, keying himself up to a condition of concentrated attention.\r\n\r\nHe noted that Flame stood beside him, facing the room, with body\r\nmotionless, and head moving swiftly from side to side with a curious\r\nswaying movement. His eyes were wide open, his back rigid, his neck and\r\njaws thrust forward, his legs tense and ready to leap. Savage, ready\r\nfor attack or defence, yet dreadfully puzzled and perhaps already a\r\nlittle cowed, he stood and stared, the hair on his spine and sides\r\npositively bristling outwards as though a wind played through them. In\r\nthe dim firelight he looked like a great yellow-haired wolf, silent,\r\neyes shooting dark fire, exceedingly formidable. It was Flame, the\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\nSmoke, meanwhile, advanced from the door towards the middle of the\r\nroom, adopting the very slow pace of an invisible companion. A few\r\nfeet away it stopped and began to smile and blink its eyes. There\r\nwas something deliberately coaxing in its attitude as it stood there\r\nundecided on the carpet, clearly wishing to effect some sort of\r\nintroduction between the Intruder and its canine friend and ally.\r\nIt assumed its most winning manners, purring, smiling, looking\r\npersuasively from one to the other, and making quick tentative steps\r\nfirst in one direction and then in the other. There had always existed\r\nsuch perfect understanding between them in everything. Surely Flame\r\nwould appreciate Smoke’s intentions now, and acquiesce.\r\n\r\nBut the old collie made no advances. He bared his teeth, lifting\r\nhis lips till the gums showed, and stood stockstill with fixed eyes\r\nand heaving sides. The doctor moved a little farther back, watching\r\nintently the smallest movement, and it was just then he divined\r\nsuddenly from the cat’s behaviour and attitude that it was not only a\r\nsingle companion it had ushered into the room, but _several_. It kept\r\ncrossing over from one to the other, looking up at each in turn. It\r\nsought to win over the dog to friendliness with them all. The original\r\nIntruder had come back with reinforcements. And at the same time he\r\nfurther realised that the Intruder was something more than a blindly\r\nacting force, impersonal though destructive. It was a Personality, and\r\nmoreover a great personality. And it was accompanied for the purposes\r\nof assistance by a host of other personalities, minor in degree, but\r\nsimilar in kind.\r\n\r\nHe braced himself in the corner against the mantelpiece and waited,\r\nhis whole being roused to defence, for he was now fully aware that\r\nthe attack had spread to include himself as well as the animals,\r\nand he must be on the alert. He strained his eyes through the foggy\r\natmosphere, trying in vain to see what the cat and dog saw; but the\r\ncandlelight threw an uncertain and flickering light across the room and\r\nhis eyes discerned nothing. On the floor Smoke moved softly in front of\r\nhim like a black shadow, his eyes gleaming as he turned his head, still\r\ntrying with many insinuating gestures and much purring to bring about\r\nthe introductions he desired.\r\n\r\nBut it was all in vain. Flame stood riveted to one spot, motionless as\r\na figure carved in stone.\r\n\r\nSome minutes passed, during which only the cat moved, and then there\r\ncame a sharp change. Flame began to back towards the wall. He moved\r\nhis head from side to side as he went, sometimes turning to snap at\r\nsomething almost behind him. _They_ were advancing upon him, trying to\r\nsurround him. His distress became very marked from now onwards, and\r\nit seemed to the doctor that his anger merged into genuine terror and\r\nbecame overwhelmed by it. The savage growl sounded perilously like a\r\nwhine, and more than once he tried to dive past his master’s legs, as\r\nthough hunting for a way of escape. He was trying to avoid something\r\nthat everywhere blocked the way.\r\n\r\nThis terror of the indomitable fighter impressed the doctor enormously;\r\nyet also painfully; stirring his impatience; for he had never before\r\nseen the dog show signs of giving in, and it distressed him to witness\r\nit. He knew, however, that he was not giving in easily, and understood\r\nthat it was really impossible for him to gauge the animal’s sensations\r\nproperly at all. What Flame felt, and saw, must be terrible indeed to\r\nturn him all at once into a coward. He faced something that made him\r\nafraid of more than his life merely. The doctor spoke a few quick words\r\nof encouragement to him, and stroked the bristling hair. But without\r\nmuch success. The collie seemed already beyond the reach of comfort\r\nsuch as that, and the collapse of the old dog followed indeed very\r\nspeedily after this.\r\n\r\nAnd Smoke, meanwhile, remained behind, watching the advance, but not\r\njoining in it; sitting, pleased and expectant, considering that all\r\nwas going well and as it wished. It was kneading on the carpet with\r\nits front paws--slowly, laboriously, as though its feet were dipped in\r\ntreacle. The sound its claws made as they caught in the threads was\r\ndistinctly audible. It was still smiling, blinking, purring.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the collie uttered a poignant short bark and leaped heavily to\r\none side. His bared teeth traced a line of whiteness through the gloom.\r\nThe next instant he dashed past his master’s legs, almost upsetting his\r\nbalance, and shot out into the room, where he went blundering wildly\r\nagainst walls and furniture. But that bark was significant; the doctor\r\nhad heard it before and knew what it meant: for it was the cry of the\r\nfighter against odds and it meant that the old beast had found his\r\ncourage again. Possibly it was only the courage of despair, but at any\r\nrate the fighting would be terrific. And Dr. Silence understood, too,\r\nthat he dared not interfere. Flame must fight his own enemies in his\r\nown way.\r\n\r\nBut the cat, too, had heard that dreadful bark; and it, too, had\r\nunderstood. This was more than it had bargained for. Across the dim\r\nshadows of that haunted room there must have passed some secret signal\r\nof distress between the animals. Smoke stood up and looked swiftly\r\nabout him. He uttered a piteous meow and trotted smartly away into the\r\ngreater darkness by the windows. What his object was only those endowed\r\nwith the spirit-like intelligence of cats might know. But, at any rate,\r\nhe had at last ranged himself on the side of his friend. And the little\r\nbeast meant business.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the collie managed to gain the door. The doctor saw\r\nhim rush through into the hall like a flash of yellow light. He shot\r\nacross the oilcloth, and tore up the stairs, but in another second he\r\nappeared again, flying down the steps and landing at the bottom in a\r\ntumbling heap, whining, cringing, terrified. The doctor saw him slink\r\nback into the room again and crawl round by the wall towards the cat.\r\nWas, then, even the staircase occupied? Did _They_ stand also in the\r\nhall? Was the whole house crowded from floor to ceiling?\r\n\r\nThe thought came to add to the keen distress he felt at the sight of\r\nthe collie’s discomfiture. And, indeed, his own personal distress had\r\nincreased in a marked degree during the past minutes, and continued\r\nto increase steadily to the climax. He recognised that the drain on\r\nhis own vitality grew steadily, and that the attack was now directed\r\nagainst himself even more than against the defeated dog, and the too\r\nmuch deceived cat.\r\n\r\nIt all seemed so rapid and uncalculated after that--the events that\r\ntook place in this little modern room at the top of Putney Hill between\r\nmidnight and sunrise--that Dr. Silence was hardly able to follow and\r\nremember it all. It came about with such uncanny swiftness and terror;\r\nthe light was so uncertain; the movements of the black cat so difficult\r\nto follow on the dark carpet, and the doctor himself so weary and taken\r\nby surprise--that he found it almost impossible to observe accurately,\r\nor to recall afterwards precisely what it was he had seen or in what\r\norder the incidents had taken place. He never could understand what\r\ndefect of vision on his part made it seem as though the cat had\r\nduplicated itself at first, and then increased indefinitely, so that\r\nthere were at least a dozen of them darting silently about the floor,\r\nleaping softly on to chairs and tables, passing like shadows from the\r\nopen door to the end of the room, all black as sin, with brilliant\r\ngreen eyes flashing fire in all directions. It was like the reflections\r\nfrom a score of mirrors placed round the walls at different angles.\r\nNor could he make out at the time why the size of the room seemed to\r\nhave altered, grown much larger, and why it extended away behind him\r\nwhere ordinarily the wall should have been. The snarling of the enraged\r\nand terrified collie sounded sometimes so far away; the ceiling seemed\r\nto have raised itself so much higher than before, and much of the\r\nfurniture had changed in appearance and shifted marvellously.\r\n\r\nIt was all so confused and confusing, as though the little room he knew\r\nhad become merged and transformed into the dimensions of quite another\r\nchamber, that came to him, with its host of cats and its strange\r\ndistances, in a sort of vision.\r\n\r\nBut these changes came about a little later, and at a time when his\r\nattention was so concentrated upon the proceedings of Smoke and the\r\ncollie, that he only observed them, as it were, subconsciously. And the\r\nexcitement, the flickering candlelight, the distress he felt for the\r\ncollie, and the distorting atmosphere of fog were the poorest possible\r\nallies to careful observation.\r\n\r\nAt first he was only aware that the dog was repeating his short\r\ndangerous bark from time to time, snapping viciously at the empty\r\nair, a foot or so from the ground. Once, indeed, he sprang upwards\r\nand forwards, working furiously with teeth and paws, and with a noise\r\nlike wolves fighting, but only to dash back the next minute against\r\nthe wall behind him. Then, after lying still for a bit, he rose to a\r\ncrouching position as though to spring again, snarling horribly and\r\nmaking short half-circles with lowered head. And Smoke all the while\r\nmeowed piteously by the window as though trying to draw the attack upon\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the rush of the whole dreadful business seemed to turn\r\naside from the dog and direct itself upon his own person. The collie\r\nhad made another spring and fallen back with a crash into the corner,\r\nwhere he made noise enough in his savage rage to waken the dead before\r\nhe fell to whining and then finally lay still. And directly afterwards\r\nthe doctor’s own distress became intolerably acute. He had made a half\r\nmovement forward to come to the rescue when a veil that was denser\r\nthan mere fog seemed to drop down over the scene, draping room, walls,\r\nanimals and fire in a mist of darkness and folding also about his own\r\nmind. Other forms moved silently across the field of vision, forms\r\nthat he recognised from previous experiments, and welcomed not. Unholy\r\nthoughts began to crowd into his brain, sinister suggestions of evil\r\npresented themselves seductively. Ice seemed to settle about his heart,\r\nand his mind trembled. He began to lose memory--memory of his identity,\r\nof where he was, of what he ought to do. The very foundations of his\r\nstrength were shaken. His will seemed paralysed.\r\n\r\nAnd it was then that the room filled with this horde of cats, all dark\r\nas the night, all silent, all with lamping eyes of green fire. The\r\ndimensions of the place altered and shifted. He was in a much larger\r\nspace. The whining of the dog sounded far away, and all about him the\r\ncats flew busily to and fro, silently playing their tearing, rushing\r\ngame of evil, weaving the pattern of their dark purpose upon the floor.\r\nHe strove hard to collect himself and remember the words of power he\r\nhad made use of before in similar dread positions where his dangerous\r\npractice had sometimes led; but he could recall nothing consecutively;\r\na mist lay over his mind and memory; he felt dazed and his forces\r\nscattered. The deeps within were too troubled for healing power to come\r\nout of them.\r\n\r\nIt was glamour, of course, he realised afterwards, the strong glamour\r\nthrown upon his imagination by some powerful personality behind the\r\nveil; but at the time he was not sufficiently aware of this and, as\r\nwith all true glamour, was unable to grasp where the true ended and\r\nthe false began. He was caught momentarily in the same vortex that\r\nhad sought to lure the cat to destruction through its delight, and\r\nthreatened utterly to overwhelm the dog through its terror.\r\n\r\nThere came a sound in the chimney behind him like wind booming and\r\ntearing its way down. The windows rattled. The candle flickered and\r\nwent out. The glacial atmosphere closed round him with the cold of\r\ndeath, and a great rushing sound swept by overhead as though the\r\nceiling had lifted to a great height. He heard the door shut. Far\r\naway it sounded. He felt lost, shelterless in the depths of his soul.\r\nYet still he held out and resisted while the climax of the fight came\r\nnearer and nearer.... He had stepped into the stream of forces awakened\r\nby Pender and he knew that he must withstand them to the end or come to\r\na conclusion that it was not good for a man to come to. Something from\r\nthe region of utter cold was upon him.\r\n\r\nAnd then quite suddenly, through the confused mists about him, there\r\nslowly rose up the Personality that had been all the time directing\r\nthe battle. Some force entered his being that shook him as the\r\ntempest shakes a leaf, and close against his eyes--clean level with\r\nhis face--he found himself staring into the wreck of a vast dark\r\nCountenance, a countenance that was terrible even in its ruin.\r\n\r\nFor ruined it was, and terrible it was, and the mark of spiritual\r\nevil was branded everywhere upon its broken features. Eyes, face and\r\nhair rose level with his own, and for a space of time he never could\r\nproperly measure, or determine, these two, a man and a woman, looked\r\nstraight into each other’s visages and down into each other’s hearts.\r\n\r\nAnd John Silence, the soul with the good, unselfish motive, held his\r\nown against the dark discarnate woman whose motive was pure evil, and\r\nwhose soul was on the side of the Dark Powers.\r\n\r\nIt was the climax that touched the depth of power within him and began\r\nto restore him slowly to his own. He was conscious, of course, of\r\neffort, and yet it seemed no superhuman one, for he had recognised the\r\ncharacter of his opponent’s power, and he called upon the good within\r\nhim to meet and overcome it. The inner forces stirred and trembled\r\nin response to his call. They did not at first come readily as was\r\ntheir habit, for under the spell of glamour they had already been\r\ndiabolically lulled into inactivity, but come they eventually did,\r\nrising out of the inner spiritual nature he had learned with so much\r\ntime and pain to awaken to life. And power and confidence came with\r\nthem. He began to breathe deeply and regularly, and at the same time\r\nto absorb into himself the forces opposed to him, and to _turn them to\r\nhis own account_. By ceasing to resist, and allowing the deadly stream\r\nto pour into him unopposed, he used the very power supplied by his\r\nadversary and thus enormously increased his own.\r\n\r\nFor this spiritual alchemy he had learned. He understood that force\r\nultimately is everywhere one and the same; it is the motive behind\r\nthat makes it good or evil; and his motive was entirely unselfish. He\r\nknew--provided he was not first robbed of self-control--how vicariously\r\nto absorb these evil radiations into himself and change them magically\r\ninto his own good purposes. And, since his motive was pure and his soul\r\nfearless, they could not work him harm.\r\n\r\nThus he stood in the main stream of evil unwittingly attracted by\r\nPender, deflecting its course upon himself; and after passing through\r\nthe purifying filter of his own unselfishness these energies could only\r\nadd to his store of experience, of knowledge, and therefore of power.\r\nAnd, as his self-control returned to him, he gradually accomplished\r\nthis purpose, even though trembling while he did so.\r\n\r\nYet the struggle was severe, and in spite of the freezing chill of the\r\nair, the perspiration poured down his face. Then, by slow degrees, the\r\ndark and dreadful countenance faded, the glamour passed from his soul,\r\nthe normal proportions returned to walls and ceiling, the forms melted\r\nback into the fog, and the whirl of rushing shadow-cats disappeared\r\nwhence they came.\r\n\r\nAnd with the return of the consciousness of his own identity John\r\nSilence was restored to the full control of his own will-power. In a\r\ndeep, modulated voice he began to utter certain rhythmical sounds that\r\nslowly rolled through the air like a rising sea, filling the room with\r\npowerful vibratory activities that whelmed all irregularities of lesser\r\nvibrations in its own swelling tone. He made certain sigils, gestures\r\nand movements at the same time. For several minutes he continued to\r\nutter these words, until at length the growing volume dominated the\r\nwhole room and mastered the manifestation of all that opposed it. For\r\njust as he understood the spiritual alchemy that can transmute evil\r\nforces by raising them into higher channels, so he knew from long study\r\nthe occult use of sound, and its direct effect upon the plastic region\r\nwherein the powers of spiritual evil work their fell purposes. Harmony\r\nwas restored first of all to his own soul, and thence to the room and\r\nall its occupants.\r\n\r\nAnd, after himself, the first to recognise it was the old dog lying\r\nin his corner. Flame began suddenly uttering sounds of pleasure, that\r\n“something” between a growl and a grunt that dogs make upon being\r\nrestored to their master’s confidence. Dr. Silence heard the thumping\r\nof the collie’s tail against the ground. And the grunt and the thumping\r\ntouched the depth of affection in the man’s heart, and gave him some\r\ninkling of what agonies the dumb creature had suffered.\r\n\r\nNext, from the shadows by the window, a somewhat shrill purring\r\nannounced the restoration of the cat to its normal state. Smoke was\r\nadvancing across the carpet. He seemed very pleased with himself, and\r\nsmiled with an expression of supreme innocence. He was no shadow-cat,\r\nbut real and full of his usual and perfect self-possession. He marched\r\nalong, picking his way delicately, but with a stately dignity that\r\nsuggested his ancestry with the majesty of Egypt. His eyes no longer\r\nglared; they shone steadily before him; they radiated, not excitement,\r\nbut knowledge. Clearly he was anxious to make amends for the mischief\r\nto which he had unwittingly lent himself owing to his subtle and\r\nelectric constitution.\r\n\r\nStill uttering his sharp high purrings he marched up to his master and\r\nrubbed vigorously against his legs. Then he stood on his hind feet and\r\npawed his knees and stared beseechingly up into his face. He turned his\r\nhead towards the corner where the collie still lay, thumping his tail\r\nfeebly and pathetically.\r\n\r\nJohn Silence understood. He bent down and stroked the creature’s living\r\nfur, noting the line of bright blue sparks that followed the motion of\r\nhis hand down its back. And then they advanced together towards the\r\ncorner where the dog was.\r\n\r\nSmoke went first and put his nose gently against his friend’s muzzle,\r\npurring while he rubbed, and uttering little soft sounds of affection\r\nin his throat. The doctor lit the candle and brought it over. He\r\nsaw the collie lying on its side against the wall; it was utterly\r\nexhausted, and foam still hung about its jaws. Its tail and eyes\r\nresponded to the sound of its name, but it was evidently very weak and\r\novercome. Smoke continued to rub against its cheek and nose and eyes,\r\nsometimes even standing on its body and kneading into the thick yellow\r\nhair. Flame replied from time to time by little licks of the tongue,\r\nmost of them curiously misdirected.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Silence felt intuitively that something disastrous had\r\nhappened, and his heart was wrung. He stroked the dear body, feeling\r\nit over for bruises or broken bones, but finding none. He fed it with\r\nwhat remained of the sandwiches and milk, but the creature clumsily\r\nupset the saucer and lost the sandwiches between its paws, so that the\r\ndoctor had to feed it with his own hand. And all the while Smoke meowed\r\npiteously.\r\n\r\nThen John Silence began to understand. He went across to the farther\r\nside of the room and called aloud to it.\r\n\r\n“Flame, old man! come!”\r\n\r\nAt any other time the dog would have been upon him in an instant,\r\nbarking and leaping to the shoulder. And even now he got up, though\r\nheavily and awkwardly, to his feet. He started to run, wagging his\r\ntail more briskly. He collided first with a chair, and then ran\r\nstraight into a table. Smoke trotted close at his side, trying his very\r\nbest to guide him. But it was useless. Dr. Silence had to lift him up\r\ninto his own arms and carry him like a baby. For he was blind.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was a week later when John Silence called to see the author in his\r\nnew house, and found him well on the way to recovery and already busy\r\nagain with his writing. The haunted look had left his eyes, and he\r\nseemed cheerful and confident.\r\n\r\n“Humour restored?” laughed the doctor, as soon as they were comfortably\r\nsettled in the room overlooking the Park.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had no trouble since I left that dreadful place,” returned Pender\r\ngratefully; “and thanks to you----”\r\n\r\nThe doctor stopped him with a gesture.\r\n\r\n“Never mind that,” he said, “we’ll discuss your new plans afterwards,\r\nand my scheme for relieving you of the house and helping you settle\r\nelsewhere. Of course it must be pulled down, for it’s not fit for any\r\nsensitive person to live in, and any other tenant might be afflicted\r\nin the same way you were. Although, personally, I think the evil has\r\nexhausted itself by now.”\r\n\r\nHe told the astonished author something of his experiences in it with\r\nthe animals.\r\n\r\n“I don’t pretend to understand,” Pender said, when the account was\r\nfinished, “but I and my wife are intensely relieved to be free of it\r\nall. Only I must say I should like to know something of the former\r\nhistory of the house. When we took it six months ago I heard no word\r\nagainst it.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence drew a typewritten paper from his pocket.\r\n\r\n“I can satisfy your curiosity to some extent,” he said, running\r\nhis eye over the sheets, and then replacing them in his coat; “for\r\nby my secretary’s investigations I have been able to check certain\r\ninformation obtained in the hypnotic trance by a ‘sensitive’ who helps\r\nme in such cases. The former occupant who haunted you appears to have\r\nbeen a woman of singularly atrocious life and character who finally\r\nsuffered death by hanging, after a series of crimes that appalled the\r\nwhole of England and only came to light by the merest chance. She came\r\nto her end in the year 1798, for it was not this particular house she\r\nlived in, but a much larger one that then stood upon the site it now\r\noccupies, and was then, of course, not in London, but in the country.\r\nShe was a person of intellect, possessed of a powerful, trained will,\r\nand of consummate audacity, and I am convinced availed herself of the\r\nresources of the lower magic to attain her ends. This goes far to\r\nexplain the virulence of the attack upon yourself, and why she is still\r\nable to carry on after death the evil practices that formed her main\r\npurpose during life.”\r\n\r\n“You think that after death a soul can still consciously direct----”\r\ngasped the author.\r\n\r\n“I think, as I told you before, that the forces of a powerful\r\npersonality may still persist after death in the line of their original\r\nmomentum,” replied the doctor; “and that strong thoughts and purposes\r\ncan still react upon suitably prepared brains long after their\r\noriginators have passed away.\r\n\r\n“If you knew anything of magic,” he pursued, “you would know that\r\nthought is dynamic, and that it may call into existence forms and\r\npictures that may well exist for hundreds of years. For, not far\r\nremoved from the region of our human life, is another region where\r\nfloats the waste and drift of all the centuries, the limbo of the\r\nshells of the dead; a densely populated region crammed with horror and\r\nabomination of all descriptions, and sometimes galvanised into active\r\nlife again by the will of a trained manipulator, a mind versed in the\r\npractices of lower magic. That this woman understood its vile commerce,\r\nI am persuaded, and the forces she set going during her life have\r\nsimply been accumulating ever since, and would have continued to do so\r\nhad they not been drawn down upon yourself, and afterwards discharged\r\nand satisfied through me.\r\n\r\n“Anything might have brought down the attack, for, besides drugs,\r\nthere are certain violent emotions, certain moods of the soul, certain\r\nspiritual fevers, if I may so call them, which directly open the inner\r\nbeing to a cognisance of this astral region I have mentioned. In your\r\ncase it happened to be a peculiarly potent drug that did it.\r\n\r\n“But now, tell me,” he added, after a pause, handing to the perplexed\r\nauthor a pencil-drawing he had made of the dark countenance that had\r\nappeared to him during the night on Putney Hill--“tell me if you\r\nrecognise this face?”\r\n\r\nPender looked at the drawing closely, greatly astonished. He shuddered\r\na little as he looked.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” he said, “it is the face I kept trying to draw--dark,\r\nwith the great mouth and jaw, and the drooping eye. That is the woman.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence then produced from his pocket-book an old-fashioned woodcut\r\nof the same person which his secretary had unearthed from the records\r\nof the Newgate Calendar. The woodcut and the pencil drawing were two\r\ndifferent aspects of the same dreadful visage. The men compared them\r\nfor some moments in silence.\r\n\r\n“It makes me thank God for the limitations of our senses,” said\r\nPender quietly, with a sigh; “continuous clairvoyance must be a sore\r\naffliction.”\r\n\r\n“It is indeed,” returned John Silence significantly, “and if all\r\nthe people nowadays who claim to be clairvoyant were really so, the\r\nstatistics of suicide and lunacy would be considerably higher than they\r\nare. It is little wonder,” he added, “that your sense of humour was\r\nclouded, with the mind-forces of that dead monster trying to use your\r\nbrain for their dissemination. You have had an interesting adventure,\r\nMr. Felix Pender, and, let me add, a fortunate escape.”\r\n\r\nThe author was about to renew his thanks when there came a sound of\r\nscratching at the door, and the doctor sprang up quickly.\r\n\r\n“It’s time for me to go. I left my dog on the step, but I suppose----”\r\n\r\nBefore he had time to open the door, it had yielded to the pressure\r\nbehind it and flew wide open to admit a great yellow-haired collie.\r\nThe dog, wagging his tail and contorting his whole body with delight,\r\ntore across the floor and tried to leap up upon his owner’s breast. And\r\nthere was laughter and happiness in the old eyes; for they were clear\r\nagain as the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE II\r\n\r\nANCIENT SORCERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThere are, it would appear, certain wholly unremarkable persons, with\r\nnone of the characteristics that invite adventure, who yet once or\r\ntwice in the course of their smooth lives undergo an experience so\r\nstrange that the world catches its breath--and looks the other way! And\r\nit was cases of this kind, perhaps, more than any other, that fell into\r\nthe widespread net of John Silence, the psychic doctor, and, appealing\r\nto his deep humanity, to his patience, and to his great qualities of\r\nspiritual sympathy, led often to the revelation of problems of the\r\nstrangest complexity, and of the profoundest possible human interest.\r\n\r\nMatters that seemed almost too curious and fantastic for belief he\r\nloved to trace to their hidden sources. To unravel a tangle in the\r\nvery soul of things--and to release a suffering human soul in the\r\nprocess--was with him a veritable passion. And the knots he untied\r\nwere, indeed, often passing strange.\r\n\r\nThe world, of course, asks for some plausible basis to which it can\r\nattach credence--something it can, at least, pretend to explain.\r\nThe adventurous type it can understand: such people carry about\r\nwith them an adequate explanation of their exciting lives, and their\r\ncharacters obviously drive them into the circumstances which produce\r\nthe adventures. It expects nothing else from them, and is satisfied.\r\nBut dull, ordinary folk have no right to out-of-the-way experiences,\r\nand the world having been led to expect otherwise, is disappointed\r\nwith them, not to say shocked. Its complacent judgment has been rudely\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\n“Such a thing happen to _that_ man!” it cries--“a commonplace person\r\nlike that! It is too absurd! There must be something wrong!”\r\n\r\nYet there could be no question that something did actually happen to\r\nlittle Arthur Vezin, something of the curious nature he described to\r\nDr. Silence. Outwardly, or inwardly, it happened beyond a doubt, and in\r\nspite of the jeers of his few friends who heard the tale, and observed\r\nwisely that “such a thing might perhaps have come to Iszard, that\r\ncrack-brained Iszard, or to that odd fish Minski, but it could never\r\nhave happened to commonplace little Vezin, who was fore-ordained to\r\nlive and die according to scale.”\r\n\r\nBut, whatever his method of death was, Vezin certainly did not “live\r\naccording to scale” so far as this particular event in his otherwise\r\nuneventful life was concerned; and to hear him recount it, and watch\r\nhis pale delicate features change, and hear his voice grow softer\r\nand more hushed as he proceeded, was to know the conviction that his\r\nhalting words perhaps failed sometimes to convey. He lived the thing\r\nover again each time he told it. His whole personality became muffled\r\nin the recital. It subdued him more than ever, so that the tale became\r\na lengthy apology for an experience that he deprecated. He appeared to\r\nexcuse himself and ask your pardon for having dared to take part in so\r\nfantastic an episode. For little Vezin was a timid, gentle, sensitive\r\nsoul, rarely able to assert himself, tender to man and beast, and\r\nalmost constitutionally unable to say No, or to claim many things that\r\nshould rightly have been his. His whole scheme of life seemed utterly\r\nremote from anything more exciting than missing a train or losing an\r\numbrella on an omnibus. And when this curious event came upon him he\r\nwas already more years beyond forty than his friends suspected or he\r\ncared to admit.\r\n\r\nJohn Silence, who heard him speak of his experience more than once,\r\nsaid that he sometimes left out certain details and put in others;\r\nyet they were all obviously true. The whole scene was unforgettably\r\ncinematographed on to his mind. None of the details were imagined\r\nor invented. And when he told the story with them all complete, the\r\neffect was undeniable. His appealing brown eyes shone, and much of the\r\ncharming personality, usually so carefully repressed, came forward and\r\nrevealed itself. His modesty was always there, of course, but in the\r\ntelling he forgot the present and allowed himself to appear almost\r\nvividly as he lived again in the past of his adventure.\r\n\r\nHe was on the way home when it happened, crossing northern France from\r\nsome mountain trip or other where he buried himself solitary-wise\r\nevery summer. He had nothing but an unregistered bag in the rack, and\r\nthe train was jammed to suffocation, most of the passengers being\r\nunredeemed holiday English. He disliked them, not because they were\r\nhis fellow-countrymen, but because they were noisy and obtrusive,\r\nobliterating with their big limbs and tweed clothing all the quieter\r\ntints of the day that brought him satisfaction and enabled him to melt\r\ninto insignificance and forget that he was anybody. These English\r\nclashed about him like a brass band, making him feel vaguely that he\r\nought to be more self-assertive and obstreperous, and that he did not\r\nclaim insistently enough all kinds of things that he didn’t want and\r\nthat were really valueless, such as corner seats, windows up or down,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nSo that he felt uncomfortable in the train, and wished the journey were\r\nover and he was back again living with his unmarried sister in Surbiton.\r\n\r\nAnd when the train stopped for ten panting minutes at the little\r\nstation in northern France, and he got out to stretch his legs on the\r\nplatform, and saw to his dismay a further batch of the British Isles\r\ndebouching from another train, it suddenly seemed impossible to him to\r\ncontinue the journey. Even _his_ flabby soul revolted, and the idea of\r\nstaying a night in the little town and going on next day by a slower,\r\nemptier train, flashed into his mind. The guard was already shouting\r\n“_en voiture_” and the corridor of his compartment was already packed\r\nwhen the thought came to him. And, for once, he acted with decision and\r\nrushed to snatch his bag.\r\n\r\nFinding the corridor and steps impassable, he tapped at the window\r\n(for he had a corner seat) and begged the Frenchman who sat opposite\r\nto hand his luggage out to him, explaining in his wretched French that\r\nhe intended to break the journey there. And this elderly Frenchman, he\r\ndeclared, gave him a look, half of warning, half of reproach, that to\r\nhis dying day he could never forget; handed the bag through the window\r\nof the moving train; and at the same time poured into his ears a long\r\nsentence, spoken rapidly and low, of which he was able to comprehend\r\nonly the last few words: “_à cause du sommeil et à cause des chats_.”\r\n\r\nIn reply to Dr. Silence, whose singular psychic acuteness at once\r\nseized upon this Frenchman as a vital point in the adventure,\r\nVezin admitted that the man had impressed him favourably from the\r\nbeginning, though without being able to explain why. They had sat\r\nfacing one another during the four hours of the journey, and though\r\nno conversation had passed between them--Vezin was timid about his\r\nstuttering French--he confessed that his eyes were being continually\r\ndrawn to his face, almost, he felt, to rudeness, and that each, by a\r\ndozen nameless little politenesses and attentions, had evinced the\r\ndesire to be kind. The men liked each other and their personalities\r\ndid not clash, or would not have clashed had they chanced to come to\r\nterms of acquaintance. The Frenchman, indeed, seemed to have exercised\r\na silent protective influence over the insignificant little Englishman,\r\nand without words or gestures betrayed that he wished him well and\r\nwould gladly have been of service to him.\r\n\r\n“And this sentence that he hurled at you after the bag?” asked John\r\nSilence, smiling that peculiarly sympathetic smile that always melted\r\nthe prejudices of his patient, “were you unable to follow it exactly?”\r\n\r\n“It was so quick and low and vehement,” explained Vezin, in his small\r\nvoice, “that I missed practically the whole of it. I only caught the\r\nfew words at the very end, because he spoke them so clearly, and his\r\nface was bent down out of the carriage window so near to mine.”\r\n\r\n“_‘A cause du sommeil et à cause des chats’?_” repeated Dr. Silence, as\r\nthough half speaking to himself.\r\n\r\n“That’s it exactly,” said Vezin; “which, I take it, means something\r\nlike ‘because of sleep and because of the cats,’ doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, that’s how I should translate it,” the doctor observed\r\nshortly, evidently not wishing to interrupt more than necessary.\r\n\r\n“And the rest of the sentence--all the first part I couldn’t\r\nunderstand, I mean--was a warning not to do something--not to stop in\r\nthe town, or at some particular place in the town, perhaps. That was\r\nthe impression it made on me.”\r\n\r\nThen, of course, the train rushed off, and left Vezin standing on the\r\nplatform alone and rather forlorn.\r\n\r\nThe little town climbed in straggling fashion up a sharp hill rising\r\nout of the plain at the back of the station, and was crowned by the\r\ntwin towers of the ruined cathedral peeping over the summit. From the\r\nstation itself it looked uninteresting and modern, but the fact was\r\nthat the mediæval position lay out of sight just beyond the crest. And\r\nonce he reached the top and entered the old streets, he stepped clean\r\nout of modern life into a bygone century. The noise and bustle of the\r\ncrowded train seemed days away. The spirit of this silent hill-town,\r\nremote from tourists and motor-cars, dreaming its own quiet life under\r\nthe autumn sun, rose up and cast its spell upon him. Long before he\r\nrecognised this spell he acted under it. He walked softly, almost on\r\ntiptoe, down the winding narrow streets where the gables all but met\r\nover his head, and he entered the doorway of the solitary inn with a\r\ndeprecating and modest demeanour that was in itself an apology for\r\nintruding upon the place and disturbing its dream.\r\n\r\nAt first, however, Vezin said, he noticed very little of all this. The\r\nattempt at analysis came much later. What struck him then was only the\r\ndelightful contrast of the silence and peace after the dust and noisy\r\nrattle of the train. He felt soothed and stroked like a cat.\r\n\r\n“Like a cat, you said?” interrupted John Silence, quickly catching him\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“Yes. At the very start I felt that.” He laughed apologetically. “I\r\nfelt as though the warmth and the stillness and the comfort made me\r\npurr. It seemed to be the general mood of the whole place--then.”\r\n\r\nThe inn, a rambling ancient house, the atmosphere of the old coaching\r\ndays still about it, apparently did not welcome him too warmly. He felt\r\nhe was only tolerated, he said. But it was cheap and comfortable, and\r\nthe delicious cup of afternoon tea he ordered at once made him feel\r\nreally very pleased with himself for leaving the train in this bold,\r\noriginal way. For to him it had seemed bold and original. He felt\r\nsomething of a dog. His room, too, soothed him with its dark panelling\r\nand low irregular ceiling, and the long sloping passage that led to it\r\nseemed the natural pathway to a real Chamber of Sleep--a little dim\r\ncubby hole out of the world where noise could not enter. It looked\r\nupon the courtyard at the back. It was all very charming, and made\r\nhim think of himself as dressed in very soft velvet somehow, and the\r\nfloors seemed padded, the walls provided with cushions. The sounds of\r\nthe streets could not penetrate there. It was an atmosphere of absolute\r\nrest that surrounded him.\r\n\r\nOn engaging the two-franc room he had interviewed the only person\r\nwho seemed to be about that sleepy afternoon, an elderly waiter with\r\nDundreary whiskers and a drowsy courtesy, who had ambled lazily towards\r\nhim across the stone yard; but on coming downstairs again for a little\r\npromenade in the town before dinner he encountered the proprietress\r\nherself. She was a large woman whose hands, feet, and features seemed\r\nto swim towards him out of a sea of person. They emerged, so to speak.\r\nBut she had great dark, vivacious eyes that counteracted the bulk of\r\nher body, and betrayed the fact that in reality she was both vigorous\r\nand alert. When he first caught sight of her she was knitting in a low\r\nchair against the sunlight of the wall, and something at once made him\r\nsee her as a great tabby cat, dozing, yet awake, heavily sleepy, and\r\nyet at the same time prepared for instantaneous action. A great mouser\r\non the watch occurred to him.\r\n\r\nShe took him in with a single comprehensive glance that was polite\r\nwithout being cordial. Her neck, he noticed, was extraordinarily supple\r\nin spite of its proportions, for it turned so easily to follow him, and\r\nthe head it carried bowed so very flexibly.\r\n\r\n“But when she looked at me, you know,” said Vezin, with that little\r\napologetic smile in his brown eyes, and that faintly deprecating\r\ngesture of the shoulders that was characteristic of him, “the odd\r\nnotion came to me that really she had intended to make quite a\r\ndifferent movement, and that with a single bound she could have leaped\r\nat me across the width of that stone yard and pounced upon me like some\r\nhuge cat upon a mouse.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed a little soft laugh, and Dr. Silence made a note in his book\r\nwithout interrupting, while Vezin proceeded in a tone as though he\r\nfeared he had already told too much and more than we could believe.\r\n\r\n“Very soft, yet very active she was, for all her size and mass, and I\r\nfelt she knew what I was doing even after I had passed and was behind\r\nher back. She spoke to me, and her voice was smooth and running. She\r\nasked if I had my luggage, and was comfortable in my room, and then\r\nadded that dinner was at seven o’clock, and that they were very early\r\npeople in this little country town. Clearly, she intended to convey\r\nthat late hours were not encouraged.”\r\n\r\nEvidently, she contrived by voice and manner to give him the impression\r\nthat here he would be “managed,” that everything would be arranged and\r\nplanned for him, and that he had nothing to do but fall into the groove\r\nand obey. No decided action or sharp personal effort would be looked\r\nfor from him. It was the very reverse of the train. He walked quietly\r\nout into the street feeling soothed and peaceful. He realised that he\r\nwas in a _milieu_ that suited him and stroked him the right way. It was\r\nso much easier to be obedient. He began to purr again, and to feel that\r\nall the town purred with him.\r\n\r\nAbout the streets of that little town he meandered gently, falling\r\ndeeper and deeper into the spirit of repose that characterised it. With\r\nno special aim he wandered up and down, and to and fro. The September\r\nsunshine fell slantingly over the roofs. Down winding alleyways,\r\nfringed with tumbling gables and open casements, he caught fairylike\r\nglimpses of the great plain below, and of the meadows and yellow copses\r\nlying like a dream-map in the haze. The spell of the past held very\r\npotently here, he felt.\r\n\r\nThe streets were full of picturesquely garbed men and women, all busy\r\nenough, going their respective ways; but no one took any notice of him\r\nor turned to stare at his obviously English appearance. He was even\r\nable to forget that with his tourist appearance he was a false note in\r\na charming picture, and he melted more and more into the scene, feeling\r\ndelightfully insignificant and unimportant and unselfconscious. It was\r\nlike becoming part of a softly-coloured dream which he did not even\r\nrealise to be a dream.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side the hill fell away more sharply, and the plain\r\nbelow ran off rather suddenly into a sea of gathering shadows in which\r\nthe little patches of woodland looked like islands and the stubble\r\nfields like deep water. Here he strolled along the old ramparts of\r\nancient fortifications that once had been formidable, but now were\r\nonly vision-like with their charming mingling of broken grey walls\r\nand wayward vine and ivy. From the broad coping on which he sat for a\r\nmoment, level with the rounded tops of clipped plane trees, he saw the\r\nesplanade far below lying in shadow. Here and there a yellow sunbeam\r\ncrept in and lay upon the fallen yellow leaves, and from the height\r\nhe looked down and saw that the townsfolk were walking to and fro in\r\nthe cool of the evening. He could just hear the sound of their slow\r\nfootfalls, and the murmur of their voices floated up to him through the\r\ngaps between the trees. The figures looked like shadows as he caught\r\nglimpses of their quiet movements far below.\r\n\r\nHe sat there for some time pondering, bathed in the waves of murmurs\r\nand half-lost echoes that rose to his ears, muffled by the leaves of\r\nthe plane trees. The whole town, and the little hill out of which it\r\ngrew as naturally as an ancient wood, seemed to him like a being lying\r\nthere half asleep on the plain and crooning to itself as it dozed.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, as he sat lazily melting into its dream, a sound of\r\nhorns and strings and wood instruments rose to his ears, and the town\r\nband began to play at the far end of the crowded terrace below to\r\nthe accompaniment of a very soft, deep-throated drum. Vezin was very\r\nsensitive to music, knew about it intelligently, and had even ventured,\r\nunknown to his friends, upon the composition of quiet melodies with\r\nlow-running chords which he played to himself with the soft pedal when\r\nno one was about. And this music floating up through the trees from an\r\ninvisible and doubtless very picturesque band of the townspeople wholly\r\ncharmed him. He recognised nothing that they played, and it sounded as\r\nthough they were simply improvising without a conductor. No definitely\r\nmarked time ran through the pieces, which ended and began oddly after\r\nthe fashion of wind through an Æolian harp. It was part of the place\r\nand scene, just as the dying sunlight and faintly-breathing wind were\r\npart of the scene and hour, and the mellow notes of old-fashioned\r\nplaintive horns, pierced here and there by the sharper strings, all\r\nhalf smothered by the continuous booming of the deep drum, touched his\r\nsoul with a curiously potent spell that was almost too engrossing to be\r\nquite pleasant.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain queer sense of bewitchment in it all. The music\r\nseemed to him oddly unartificial. It made him think of trees swept by\r\nthe wind, of night breezes singing among wires and chimney-stacks, or\r\nin the rigging of invisible ships; or--and the simile leaped up in his\r\nthoughts with a sudden sharpness of suggestion--a chorus of animals,\r\nof wild creatures, somewhere in desolate places of the world, crying\r\nand singing as animals will, to the moon. He could fancy he heard the\r\nwailing, half-human cries of cats upon the tiles at night, rising and\r\nfalling with weird intervals of sound, and this music, muffled by\r\ndistance and the trees, made him think of a queer company of these\r\ncreatures on some roof far away in the sky, uttering their solemn music\r\nto one another and the moon in chorus.\r\n\r\nIt was, he felt at the time, a singular image to occur to him, yet it\r\nexpressed his sensation pictorially better than anything else. The\r\ninstruments played such impossibly odd intervals, and the crescendos\r\nand diminuendos were so very suggestive of cat-land on the tiles at\r\nnight, rising swiftly, dropping without warning to deep notes again,\r\nand all in such strange confusion of discords and accords. But, at the\r\nsame time a plaintive sweetness resulted on the whole, and the discords\r\nof these half-broken instruments were so singular that they did not\r\ndistress his musical soul like fiddles out of tune.\r\n\r\nHe listened a long time, wholly surrendering himself as his character\r\nwas, and then strolled homewards in the dusk as the air grew chilly.\r\n\r\n“There was nothing to alarm?” put in Dr. Silence briefly.\r\n\r\n“Absolutely nothing,” said Vezin; “but you know it was all so\r\nfantastical and charming that my imagination was profoundly impressed.\r\nPerhaps, too,” he continued, gently explanatory, “it was this stirring\r\nof my imagination that caused other impressions; for, as I walked back,\r\nthe spell of the place began to steal over me in a dozen ways, though\r\nall intelligible ways. But there were other things I could not account\r\nfor in the least, even then.”\r\n\r\n“Incidents, you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly incidents, I think. A lot of vivid sensations crowded\r\nthemselves upon my mind and I could trace them to no causes. It was\r\njust after sunset and the tumbled old buildings traced magical outlines\r\nagainst an opalescent sky of gold and red. The dusk was running down\r\nthe twisted streets. All round the hill the plain pressed in like a\r\ndim sea, its level rising with the darkness. The spell of this kind of\r\nscene, you know, can be very moving, and it was so that night. Yet I\r\nfelt that what came to me had nothing directly to do with the mystery\r\nand wonder of the scene.”\r\n\r\n“Not merely the subtle transformations of the spirit that come with\r\nbeauty,” put in the doctor, noticing his hesitation.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” Vezin went on, duly encouraged and no longer so fearful\r\nof our smiles at his expense. “The impressions came from somewhere\r\nelse. For instance, down the busy main street where men and women were\r\nbustling home from work, shopping at stalls and barrows, idly gossiping\r\nin groups, and all the rest of it, I saw that I aroused no interest and\r\nthat no one turned to stare at me as a foreigner and stranger. I was\r\nutterly ignored, and my presence among them excited no special interest\r\nor attention.\r\n\r\n“And then, quite suddenly, it dawned upon me with conviction that\r\nall the time this indifference and inattention were merely feigned.\r\nEverybody as a matter of fact was watching me closely. Every movement\r\nI made was known and observed. Ignoring me was all a pretence--an\r\nelaborate pretence.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment and looked at us to see if we were smiling, and then\r\ncontinued, reassured--\r\n\r\n“It is useless to ask me how I noticed this, because I simply cannot\r\nexplain it. But the discovery gave me something of a shock. Before I\r\ngot back to the inn, however, another curious thing rose up strongly in\r\nmy mind and forced my recognition of it as true. And this, too, I may\r\nas well say at once, was equally inexplicable to me. I mean I can only\r\ngive you the fact, as fact it was to me.”\r\n\r\nThe little man left his chair and stood on the mat before the fire.\r\nHis diffidence lessened from now onwards, as he lost himself again in\r\nthe magic of the old adventure. His eyes shone a little already as he\r\ntalked.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he went on, his soft voice rising somewhat with his excitement,\r\n“I was in a shop when it came to me first--though the idea must have\r\nbeen at work for a long time subconsciously to appear in so complete\r\na form all at once. I was buying socks, I think,” he laughed, “and\r\nstruggling with my dreadful French, when it struck me that the woman in\r\nthe shop did not care two pins whether I bought anything or not. She\r\nwas indifferent whether she made a sale or did not make a sale. She was\r\nonly pretending to sell.\r\n\r\n“This sounds a very small and fanciful incident to build upon what\r\nfollows. But really it was not small. I mean it was the spark that lit\r\nthe line of powder and ran along to the big blaze in my mind.\r\n\r\n“For the whole town, I suddenly realised, was something other than I\r\nso far saw it. The real activities and interests of the people were\r\nelsewhere and otherwise than appeared. Their true lives lay somewhere\r\nout of sight behind the scenes. Their busy-ness was but the outward\r\nsemblance that masked their actual purposes. They bought and sold, and\r\nate and drank, and walked about the streets, yet all the while the main\r\nstream of their existence lay somewhere beyond my ken, underground, in\r\nsecret places. In the shops and at the stalls they did not care whether\r\nI purchased their articles or not; at the inn, they were indifferent\r\nto my staying or going; their life lay remote from my own, springing\r\nfrom hidden, mysterious sources, coursing out of sight, unknown. It\r\nwas all a great elaborate pretence, assumed possibly for my benefit,\r\nor possibly for purposes of their own. But the main current of their\r\nenergies ran elsewhere. I almost felt as an unwelcome foreign substance\r\nmight be expected to feel when it has found its way into the human\r\nsystem and the whole body organises itself to eject it or to absorb it.\r\nThe town was doing this very thing to me.\r\n\r\n“This bizarre notion presented itself forcibly to my mind as I walked\r\nhome to the inn, and I began busily to wonder wherein the true life of\r\nthis town could lie and what were the actual interests and activities\r\nof its hidden life.\r\n\r\n“And, now that my eyes were partly opened, I noticed other things\r\ntoo that puzzled me, first of which, I think, was the extraordinary\r\nsilence of the whole place. Positively, the town was muffled. Although\r\nthe streets were paved with cobbles the people moved about silently,\r\nsoftly, with padded feet, like cats. Nothing made noise. All was\r\nhushed, subdued, muted. The very voices were quiet, low-pitched like\r\npurring. Nothing clamorous, vehement or emphatic seemed able to live\r\nin the drowsy atmosphere of soft dreaming that soothed this little\r\nhill-town into its sleep. It was like the woman at the inn--an outward\r\nrepose screening intense inner activity and purpose.\r\n\r\n“Yet there was no sign of lethargy or sluggishness anywhere about it.\r\nThe people were active and alert. Only a magical and uncanny softness\r\nlay over them all like a spell.”\r\n\r\nVezin passed his hand across his eyes for a moment as though the memory\r\nhad become very vivid. His voice had run off into a whisper so that\r\nwe heard the last part with difficulty. He was telling a true thing\r\nobviously, yet something that he both liked and hated telling.\r\n\r\n“I went back to the inn,” he continued presently in a louder voice,\r\n“and dined. I felt a new strange world about me. My old world of\r\nreality receded. Here, whether I liked it or no, was something new and\r\nincomprehensible. I regretted having left the train so impulsively.\r\nAn adventure was upon me, and I loathed adventures as foreign to my\r\nnature. Moreover, this was the beginning apparently of an adventure\r\nsomewhere deep within me, in a region I could not check or measure,\r\nand a feeling of alarm mingled itself with my wonder--alarm for the\r\nstability of what I had for forty years recognised as my ‘personality.’\r\n\r\n“I went upstairs to bed, my mind teeming with thoughts that were\r\nunusual to me, and of rather a haunting description. By way of\r\nrelief I kept thinking of that nice, prosaic noisy train and all\r\nthose wholesome, blustering passengers. I almost wished I were with\r\nthem again. But my dreams took me elsewhere. I dreamed of cats, and\r\nsoft-moving creatures, and the silence of life in a dim muffled world\r\nbeyond the senses.”\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nVezin stayed on from day to day, indefinitely, much longer than he\r\nhad intended. He felt in a kind of dazed, somnolent condition. He did\r\nnothing in particular, but the place fascinated him and he could not\r\ndecide to leave. Decisions were always very difficult for him and he\r\nsometimes wondered how he had ever brought himself to the point of\r\nleaving the train. It seemed as though some one else must have arranged\r\nit for him, and once or twice his thoughts ran to the swarthy Frenchman\r\nwho had sat opposite. If only he could have understood that long\r\nsentence ending so strangely with “_à cause du sommeil et à cause des\r\nchats_.” He wondered what it all meant.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hushed softness of the town held him prisoner and he\r\nsought in his muddling, gentle way to find out where the mystery\r\nlay, and what it was all about. But his limited French and his\r\nconstitutional hatred of active investigation made it hard for him to\r\nbuttonhole anybody and ask questions. He was content to observe, and\r\nwatch, and remain negative.\r\n\r\nThe weather held on calm and hazy, and this just suited him. He\r\nwandered about the town till he knew every street and alley. The\r\npeople suffered him to come and go without let or hindrance, though\r\nit became clearer to him every day that he was never free himself from\r\nobservation. The town watched him as a cat watches a mouse. And he got\r\nno nearer to finding out what they were all so busy with or where the\r\nmain stream of their activities lay. This remained hidden. The people\r\nwere as soft and mysterious as cats.\r\n\r\nBut that he was continually under observation became more evident from\r\nday to day.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when he strolled to the end of the town and entered a\r\nlittle green public garden beneath the ramparts and seated himself upon\r\none of the empty benches in the sun, he was quite alone--at first.\r\nNot another seat was occupied; the little park was empty, the paths\r\ndeserted. Yet, within ten minutes of his coming, there must have been\r\nfully twenty persons scattered about him, some strolling aimlessly\r\nalong the gravel walks, staring at the flowers, and others seated on\r\nthe wooden benches enjoying the sun like himself. None of them appeared\r\nto take any notice of him; yet he understood quite well they had all\r\ncome there to watch. They kept him under close observation. In the\r\nstreet they had seemed busy enough, hurrying upon various errands; yet\r\nthese were suddenly all forgotten and they had nothing to do but loll\r\nand laze in the sun, their duties unremembered. Five minutes after\r\nhe left, the garden was again deserted, the seats vacant. But in the\r\ncrowded street it was the same thing again; he was never alone. He was\r\never in their thoughts.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, too, he began to see how it was he was so cleverly watched,\r\nyet without the appearance of it. The people did nothing _directly_.\r\nThey behaved _obliquely_. He laughed in his mind as the thought thus\r\nclothed itself in words, but the phrase exactly described it. They\r\nlooked at him from angles which naturally should have led their sight\r\nin another direction altogether. Their movements were oblique, too,\r\nso far as these concerned himself. The straight, direct thing was\r\nnot their way evidently. They did nothing obviously. If he entered a\r\nshop to buy, the woman walked instantly away and busied herself with\r\nsomething at the farther end of the counter, though answering at once\r\nwhen he spoke, showing that she knew he was there and that this was\r\nonly her way of attending to him. It was the fashion of the cat she\r\nfollowed. Even in the dining-room of the inn, the be-whiskered and\r\ncourteous waiter, lithe and silent in all his movements, never seemed\r\nable to come straight to his table for an order or a dish. He came\r\nby zigzags, indirectly, vaguely, so that he appeared to be going to\r\nanother table altogether, and only turned suddenly at the last moment,\r\nand was there beside him.\r\n\r\nVezin smiled curiously to himself as he described how he began to\r\nrealise these things. Other tourists there were none in the hostel, but\r\nhe recalled the figures of one or two old men, inhabitants, who took\r\ntheir _déjeuner_ and dinner there, and remembered how fantastically\r\nthey entered the room in similar fashion. First, they paused in\r\nthe doorway, peering about the room, and then, after a temporary\r\ninspection, they came in, as it were, sideways, keeping close to the\r\nwalls so that he wondered which table they were making for, and at the\r\nlast minute making almost a little quick run to their particular seats.\r\nAnd again he thought of the ways and methods of cats.\r\n\r\nOther small incidents, too, impressed him as all part of this queer,\r\nsoft town with its muffled, indirect life, for the way some of the\r\npeople appeared and disappeared with extraordinary swiftness puzzled\r\nhim exceedingly. It may have been all perfectly natural, he knew, yet\r\nhe could not make it out how the alleys swallowed them up and shot\r\nthem forth in a second of time when there were no visible doorways or\r\nopenings near enough to explain the phenomenon. Once he followed two\r\nelderly women who, he felt, had been particularly examining him from\r\nacross the street--quite near the inn this was--and saw them turn the\r\ncorner a few feet only in front of him. Yet when he sharply followed\r\non their heels he saw nothing but an utterly deserted alley stretching\r\nin front of him with no sign of a living thing. And the only opening\r\nthrough which they could have escaped was a porch some fifty yards\r\naway, which not the swiftest human runner could have reached in time.\r\n\r\nAnd in just such sudden fashion people appeared when he never expected\r\nthem. Once when he heard a great noise of fighting going on behind a\r\nlow wall, and hurried up to see what was going on, what should he see\r\nbut a group of girls and women engaged in vociferous conversation which\r\ninstantly hushed itself to the normal whispering note of the town when\r\nhis head appeared over the wall. And even then none of them turned\r\nto look at him directly, but slunk off with the most unaccountable\r\nrapidity into doors and sheds across the yard. And their voices, he\r\nthought, had sounded so like, so strangely like, the angry snarling of\r\nfighting animals, almost of cats.\r\n\r\nThe whole spirit of the town, however, continued to evade him as\r\nsomething elusive, protean, screened from the outer world, and at the\r\nsame time intensely, genuinely vital; and, since he now formed part of\r\nits life, this concealment puzzled and irritated him; more--it began\r\nrather to frighten him.\r\n\r\nOut of the mists that slowly gathered about his ordinary surface\r\nthoughts, there rose again the idea that the inhabitants were waiting\r\nfor him to declare himself, to take an attitude, to do this, or to do\r\nthat; and that when he had done so they in their turn would at length\r\nmake some direct response, accepting or rejecting him. Yet the vital\r\nmatter concerning which his decision was awaited came no nearer to him.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice he purposely followed little processions or groups of\r\nthe citizens in order to find out, if possible, on what purpose they\r\nwere bent; but they always discovered him in time and dwindled away,\r\neach individual going his or her own way. It was always the same: he\r\nnever could learn what their main interest was. The cathedral was ever\r\nempty, the old church of St. Martin, at the other end of the town,\r\ndeserted. They shopped because they had to, and not because they wished\r\nto. The booths stood neglected, the stalls unvisited, the little cafés\r\ndesolate. Yet the streets were always full, the townsfolk ever on the\r\nbustle.\r\n\r\n“Can it be,” he thought to himself, yet with a deprecating laugh that\r\nhe should have dared to think anything so odd, “can it be that these\r\npeople are people of the twilight, that they live only at night their\r\nreal life, and come out honestly only with the dusk? That during the\r\nday they make a sham though brave pretence, and after the sun is down\r\ntheir true life begins? Have they the souls of night-things, and is the\r\nwhole blessed town in the hands of the cats?”\r\n\r\nThe fancy somehow electrified him with little shocks of shrinking and\r\ndismay. Yet, though he affected to laugh, he knew that he was beginning\r\nto feel more than uneasy, and that strange forces were tugging with a\r\nthousand invisible cords at the very centre of his being. Something\r\nutterly remote from his ordinary life, something that had not waked for\r\nyears, began faintly to stir in his soul, sending feelers abroad into\r\nhis brain and heart, shaping queer thoughts and penetrating even into\r\ncertain of his minor actions. Something exceedingly vital to himself,\r\nto his soul, hung in the balance.\r\n\r\nAnd, always when he returned to the inn about the hour of sunset,\r\nhe saw the figures of the townsfolk stealing through the dusk from\r\ntheir shop doors, moving sentry-wise to and fro at the corners of\r\nthe streets, yet always vanishing silently like shadows at his near\r\napproach. And as the inn invariably closed its doors at ten o’clock he\r\nhad never yet found the opportunity he rather half-heartedly sought to\r\nsee for himself what account the town could give of itself at night.\r\n\r\n“----_à cause du sommeil et à cause des chats_”--the words now rang in\r\nhis ears more and more often, though still as yet without any definite\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nMoreover, something made him sleep like the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was, I think, on the fifth day--though in this detail his story\r\nsometimes varied--that he made a definite discovery which increased\r\nhis alarm and brought him up to a rather sharp climax. Before that he\r\nhad already noticed that a change was going forward and certain subtle\r\ntransformations being brought about in his character which modified\r\nseveral of his minor habits. And he had affected to ignore them. Here,\r\nhowever, was something he could no longer ignore; and it startled him.\r\n\r\nAt the best of times he was never very positive, always negative\r\nrather, compliant and acquiescent; yet, when necessity arose he was\r\ncapable of reasonably vigorous action and could take a strongish\r\ndecision. The discovery he now made that brought him up with such a\r\nsharp turn was that this power had positively dwindled to nothing.\r\nHe found it impossible to make up his mind. For, on this fifth day,\r\nhe realised that he had stayed long enough in the town and that for\r\nreasons he could only vaguely define to himself it was wiser _and\r\nsafer_ that he should leave.\r\n\r\nAnd he found that he could not leave!\r\n\r\nThis is difficult to describe in words, and it was more by gesture and\r\nthe expression of his face that he conveyed to Dr. Silence the state\r\nof impotence he had reached. All this spying and watching, he said,\r\nhad as it were spun a net about his feet so that he was trapped and\r\npowerless to escape; he felt like a fly that had blundered into the\r\nintricacies of a great web; he was caught, imprisoned, and could not\r\nget away. It was a distressing sensation. A numbness had crept over\r\nhis will till it had become almost incapable of decision. The mere\r\nthought of vigorous action--action towards escape--began to terrify\r\nhim. All the currents of his life had turned inwards upon himself,\r\nstriving to bring to the surface something that lay buried almost\r\nbeyond reach, determined to force his recognition of something he had\r\nlong forgotten--forgotten years upon years, centuries almost ago. It\r\nseemed as though a window deep within his being would presently open\r\nand reveal an entirely new world, yet somehow a world that was not\r\nunfamiliar. Beyond that, again, he fancied a great curtain hung; and\r\nwhen that too rolled up he would see still farther into this region and\r\nat last understand something of the secret life of these extraordinary\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n“Is this why they wait and watch?” he asked himself with rather a\r\nshaking heart, “for the time when I shall join them--or refuse to join\r\nthem? Does the decision rest with me after all, and not with them?”\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this point that the sinister character of the adventure\r\nfirst really declared itself, and he became genuinely alarmed. The\r\nstability of his rather fluid little personality was at stake, he felt,\r\nand something in his heart turned coward.\r\n\r\nWhy otherwise should he have suddenly taken to walking stealthily,\r\nsilently, making as little sound as possible, for ever looking behind\r\nhim? Why else should he have moved almost on tiptoe about the passages\r\nof the practically deserted inn, and when he was abroad have found\r\nhimself deliberately taking advantage of what cover presented itself?\r\nAnd why, if he was not afraid, should the wisdom of staying indoors\r\nafter sundown have suddenly occurred to him as eminently desirable?\r\nWhy, indeed?\r\n\r\nAnd, when John Silence gently pressed him for an explanation of these\r\nthings, he admitted apologetically that he had none to give.\r\n\r\n“It was simply that I feared something might happen to me unless I kept\r\na sharp look-out. I felt afraid. It was instinctive,” was all he could\r\nsay. “I got the impression that the whole town was after me--wanted me\r\nfor something; and that if it got me I should lose myself, or at least\r\nthe Self I knew, in some unfamiliar state of consciousness. But I am\r\nnot a psychologist, you know,” he added meekly, “and I cannot define it\r\nbetter than that.”\r\n\r\nIt was while lounging in the courtyard half an hour before the evening\r\nmeal that Vezin made this discovery, and he at once went upstairs to\r\nhis quiet room at the end of the winding passage to think it over\r\nalone. In the yard it was empty enough, true, but there was always the\r\npossibility that the big woman whom he dreaded would come out of some\r\ndoor, with her pretence of knitting, to sit and watch him. This had\r\nhappened several times, and he could not endure the sight of her. He\r\nstill remembered his original fancy, bizarre though it was, that she\r\nwould spring upon him the moment his back was turned and land with one\r\nsingle crushing leap upon his neck. Of course it was nonsense, but then\r\nit haunted him, and once an idea begins to do that it ceases to be\r\nnonsense. It has clothed itself in reality.\r\n\r\nHe went upstairs accordingly. It was dusk, and the oil lamps had not\r\nyet been lit in the passages. He stumbled over the uneven surface of\r\nthe ancient flooring, passing the dim outlines of doors along the\r\ncorridor--doors that he had never once seen opened--rooms that seemed\r\nnever occupied. He moved, as his habit now was, stealthily and on\r\ntiptoe.\r\n\r\nHalf-way down the last passage to his own chamber there was a sharp\r\nturn, and it was just here, while groping round the walls with\r\noutstretched hands, that his fingers touched something that was\r\nnot wall--something that moved. It was soft and warm in texture,\r\nindescribably fragrant, and about the height of his shoulder; and he\r\nimmediately thought of a furry, sweet-smelling kitten. The next minute\r\nhe knew it was something quite different.\r\n\r\nInstead of investigating, however,--his nerves must have been too\r\noverwrought for that, he said,--he shrank back as closely as possible\r\nagainst the wall on the other side. The thing, whatever it was, slipped\r\npast him with a sound of rustling, and retreating with light footsteps\r\ndown the passage behind him, was gone. A breath of warm, scented air\r\nwas wafted to his nostrils.\r\n\r\nVezin caught his breath for an instant and paused, stockstill, half\r\nleaning against the wall--and then almost ran down the remaining\r\ndistance and entered his room with a rush, locking the door hurriedly\r\nbehind him. Yet it was not fear that made him run: it was excitement,\r\npleasurable excitement. His nerves were tingling, and a delicious glow\r\nmade itself felt all over his body. In a flash it came to him that this\r\nwas just what he had felt twenty-five years ago as a boy when he was\r\nin love for the first time. Warm currents of life ran all over him and\r\nmounted to his brain in a whirl of soft delight. His mood was suddenly\r\nbecome tender, melting, loving.\r\n\r\nThe room was quite dark, and he collapsed upon the sofa by the window,\r\nwondering what had happened to him and what it all meant. But the only\r\nthing he understood clearly in that instant was that something in him\r\nhad swiftly, magically changed: he no longer wished to leave, or to\r\nargue with himself about leaving. The encounter in the passage-way\r\nhad changed all that. The strange perfume of it still hung about him,\r\nbemusing his heart and mind. For he knew that it was a girl who had\r\npassed him, a girl’s face that his fingers had brushed in the darkness,\r\nand he felt in some extraordinary way as though he had been actually\r\nkissed by her, kissed full upon the lips.\r\n\r\nTrembling, he sat upon the sofa by the window and struggled to collect\r\nhis thoughts. He was utterly unable to understand how the mere passing\r\nof a girl in the darkness of a narrow passage-way could communicate\r\nso electric a thrill to his whole being that he still shook with the\r\nsweetness of it. Yet, there it was! And he found it as useless to deny\r\nas to attempt analysis. Some ancient fire had entered his veins, and\r\nnow ran coursing through his blood; and that he was forty-five instead\r\nof twenty did not matter one little jot. Out of all the inner turmoil\r\nand confusion emerged the one salient fact that the mere atmosphere,\r\nthe merest casual touch, of this girl, unseen, unknown in the darkness,\r\nhad been sufficient to stir dormant fires in the centre of his heart,\r\nand rouse his whole being from a state of feeble sluggishness to one of\r\ntearing and tumultuous excitement.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, however, the number of Vezin’s years began to assert\r\ntheir cumulative power; he grew calmer; and when a knock came at\r\nlength upon his door and he heard the waiter’s voice suggesting that\r\ndinner was nearly over, he pulled himself together and slowly made his\r\nway downstairs into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nEvery one looked up as he entered, for he was very late, but he took\r\nhis customary seat in the far corner and began to eat. The trepidation\r\nwas still in his nerves, but the fact that he had passed through the\r\ncourtyard and hall without catching sight of a petticoat served to calm\r\nhim a little. He ate so fast that he had almost caught up with the\r\ncurrent stage of the table d’hôte, when a slight commotion in the room\r\ndrew his attention.\r\n\r\nHis chair was so placed that the door and the greater portion of the\r\nlong _salle à manger_ were behind him, yet it was not necessary to\r\nturn round to know that the same person he had passed in the dark\r\npassage had now come into the room. He felt the presence long before he\r\nheard or saw any one. Then he became aware that the old men, the only\r\nother guests, were rising one by one in their places, and exchanging\r\ngreetings with some one who passed among them from table to table. And\r\nwhen at length he turned with his heart beating furiously to ascertain\r\nfor himself, he saw the form of a young girl, lithe and slim, moving\r\ndown the centre of the room and making straight for his own table in\r\nthe corner. She moved wonderfully, with sinuous grace, like a young\r\npanther, and her approach filled him with such delicious bewilderment\r\nthat he was utterly unable to tell at first what her face was like, or\r\ndiscover what it was about the whole presentment of the creature that\r\nfilled him anew with trepidation and delight.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Ma’mselle est de retour!” he heard the old waiter murmur at his\r\nside, and he was just able to take in that she was the daughter of the\r\nproprietress, when she was upon him, and he heard her voice. She was\r\naddressing him. Something of red lips he saw and laughing white teeth,\r\nand stray wisps of fine dark hair about the temples; but all the rest\r\nwas a dream in which his own emotion rose like a thick cloud before\r\nhis eyes and prevented his seeing accurately, or knowing exactly what\r\nhe did. He was aware that she greeted him with a charming little bow;\r\nthat her beautiful large eyes looked searchingly into his own; that the\r\nperfume he had noticed in the dark passage again assailed his nostrils,\r\nand that she was bending a little towards him and leaning with one\r\nhand on the table at his side. She was quite close to him--that was\r\nthe chief thing he knew--explaining that she had been asking after the\r\ncomfort of her mother’s guests, and was now introducing herself to the\r\nlatest arrival--himself.\r\n\r\n“M’sieur has already been here a few days,” he heard the waiter say;\r\nand then her own voice, sweet as singing, replied--\r\n\r\n“Ah, but M’sieur is not going to leave us just yet, I hope. My mother\r\nis too old to look after the comfort of our guests properly, but now\r\nI am here I will remedy all that.” She laughed deliciously. “M’sieur\r\nshall be well looked after.”\r\n\r\nVezin, struggling with his emotion and desire to be polite, half rose\r\nto acknowledge the pretty speech, and to stammer some sort of reply,\r\nbut as he did so his hand by chance touched her own that was resting\r\nupon the table, and a shock that was for all the world like a shock of\r\nelectricity, passed from her skin into his body. His soul wavered and\r\nshook deep within him. He caught her eyes fixed upon his own with a\r\nlook of most curious intentness, and the next moment he knew that he\r\nhad sat down wordless again on his chair, that the girl was already\r\nhalf-way across the room, and that he was trying to eat his salad with\r\na dessert-spoon and a knife.\r\n\r\nLonging for her return, and yet dreading it, he gulped down the\r\nremainder of his dinner, and then went at once to his bedroom to be\r\nalone with his thoughts. This time the passages were lighted, and he\r\nsuffered no exciting contretemps; yet the winding corridor was dim with\r\nshadows, and the last portion, from the bend of the walls onwards,\r\nseemed longer than he had ever known it. It ran downhill like the\r\npathway on a mountain side, and as he tiptoed softly down it he felt\r\nthat by rights it ought to have led him clean out of the house into\r\nthe heart of a great forest. The world was singing with him. Strange\r\nfancies filled his brain, and once in the room, with the door securely\r\nlocked, he did not light the candles, but sat by the open window\r\nthinking long, long thoughts that came unbidden in troops to his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThis part of the story he told to Dr. Silence, without special coaxing,\r\nit is true, yet with much stammering embarrassment. He could not in\r\nthe least understand, he said, how the girl had managed to affect him\r\nso profoundly, and even before he had set eyes upon her. For her mere\r\nproximity in the darkness had been sufficient to set him on fire. He\r\nknew nothing of enchantments, and for years had been a stranger to\r\nanything approaching tender relations with any member of the opposite\r\nsex, for he was encased in shyness, and realised his overwhelming\r\ndefects only too well. Yet this bewitching young creature came to him\r\ndeliberately. Her manner was unmistakable, and she sought him out on\r\nevery possible occasion. Chaste and sweet she was undoubtedly, yet\r\nfrankly inviting; and she won him utterly with the first glance of her\r\nshining eyes, even if she had not already done so in the dark merely by\r\nthe magic of her invisible presence.\r\n\r\n“You felt she was altogether wholesome and good?” queried the doctor.\r\n“You had no reaction of any sort--for instance, of alarm?”\r\n\r\nVezin looked up sharply with one of his inimitable little apologetic\r\nsmiles. It was some time before he replied. The mere memory of the\r\nadventure had suffused his shy face with blushes, and his brown eyes\r\nsought the floor again before he answered.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I can quite say that,” he explained presently. “I\r\nacknowledged certain qualms, sitting up in my room afterwards. A\r\nconviction grew upon me that there was something about her--how shall I\r\nexpress it?--well, something unholy. It is not impurity in any sense,\r\nphysical or mental, that I mean, but something quite indefinable that\r\ngave me a vague sensation of the creeps. She drew me, and at the same\r\ntime repelled me, more than--than----”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, blushing furiously, and unable to finish the sentence.\r\n\r\n“Nothing like it has ever come to me before or since,” he concluded,\r\nwith lame confusion. “I suppose it was, as you suggested just now,\r\nsomething of an enchantment. At any rate, it was strong enough to make\r\nme feel that I would stay in that awful little haunted town for years\r\nif only I could see her every day, hear her voice, watch her wonderful\r\nmovements, and sometimes, perhaps, touch her hand.”\r\n\r\n“Can you explain to me what you felt was the source of her power?” John\r\nSilence asked, looking purposely anywhere but at the narrator.\r\n\r\n“I am surprised that _you_ should ask me such a question,” answered\r\nVezin, with the nearest approach to dignity he could manage. “I think\r\nno man can describe to another convincingly wherein lies the magic of\r\nthe woman who ensnares him. I certainly cannot. I can only say this\r\nslip of a girl bewitched me, and the mere knowledge that she was living\r\nand sleeping in the same house filled me with an extraordinary sense of\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n“But there’s one thing I can tell you,” he went on earnestly, his eyes\r\naglow, “namely, that she seemed to sum up and synthesise in herself\r\nall the strange hidden forces that operated so mysteriously in the\r\ntown and its inhabitants. She had the silken movements of the panther,\r\ngoing smoothly, silently to and fro, and the same indirect, oblique\r\nmethods as the townsfolk, screening, like them, secret purposes of\r\nher own--purposes that I was sure had _me_ for their objective. She\r\nkept me, to my terror and delight, ceaselessly under observation, yet\r\nso carelessly, so consummately, that another man less sensitive, if I\r\nmay say so”--he made a deprecating gesture--“or less prepared by what\r\nhad gone before, would never have noticed it at all. She was always\r\nstill, always reposeful, yet she seemed to be everywhere at once, so\r\nthat I never could escape from her. I was continually meeting the stare\r\nand laughter of her great eyes, in the corners of the rooms, in the\r\npassages, calmly looking at me through the windows, or in the busiest\r\nparts of the public streets.”\r\n\r\nTheir intimacy, it seems, grew very rapidly after this first encounter\r\nwhich had so violently disturbed the little man’s equilibrium. He was\r\nnaturally very prim, and prim folk live mostly in so small a world that\r\nanything violently unusual may shake them clean out of it, and they\r\ntherefore instinctively distrust originality. But Vezin began to forget\r\nhis primness after awhile. The girl was always modestly behaved, and\r\nas her mother’s representative she naturally had to do with the guests\r\nin the hotel. It was not out of the way that a spirit of camaraderie\r\nshould spring up. Besides, she was young, she was charmingly pretty,\r\nshe was French, and--she obviously liked him.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there was something indescribable--a certain\r\nindefinable atmosphere of other places, other times--that made him try\r\nhard to remain on his guard, and sometimes made him catch his breath\r\nwith a sudden start. It was all rather like a delirious dream, half\r\ndelight, half dread, he confided in a whisper to Dr. Silence; and more\r\nthan once he hardly knew quite what he was doing or saying, as though\r\nhe were driven forward by impulses he scarcely recognised as his own.\r\n\r\nAnd though the thought of leaving presented itself again and again to\r\nhis mind, it was each time with less insistence, so that he stayed on\r\nfrom day to day, becoming more and more a part of the sleepy life of\r\nthis dreamy mediæval town, losing more and more of his recognisable\r\npersonality. Soon, he felt, the Curtain within would roll up with an\r\nawful rush, and he would find himself suddenly admitted into the\r\nsecret purposes of the hidden life that lay behind it all. Only, by\r\nthat time, he would have become transformed into an entirely different\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nAnd, meanwhile, he noticed various little signs of the intention\r\nto make his stay attractive to him: flowers in his bedroom, a more\r\ncomfortable arm-chair in the corner, and even special little extra\r\ndishes on his private table in the dining-room. Conversations, too,\r\nwith “Mademoiselle Ilsé” became more and more frequent and pleasant,\r\nand although they seldom travelled beyond the weather, or the details\r\nof the town, the girl, he noticed, was never in a hurry to bring them\r\nto an end, and often contrived to interject little odd sentences that\r\nhe never properly understood, yet felt to be significant.\r\n\r\nAnd it was these stray remarks, full of a meaning that evaded him, that\r\npointed to some hidden purpose of her own and made him feel uneasy.\r\nThey all had to do, he felt sure, with reasons for his staying on in\r\nthe town indefinitely.\r\n\r\n“And has M’sieur not even yet come to a decision?” she said softly in\r\nhis ear, sitting beside him in the sunny yard before _déjeuner_, the\r\nacquaintance having progressed with significant rapidity. “Because, if\r\nit’s so difficult, we must all try together to help him!”\r\n\r\nThe question startled him, following upon his own thoughts. It was\r\nspoken with a pretty laugh, and a stray bit of hair across one eye, as\r\nshe turned and peered at him half roguishly. Possibly he did not quite\r\nunderstand the French of it, for her near presence always confused\r\nhis small knowledge of the language distressingly. Yet the words, and\r\nher manner, and something else that lay behind it all in her mind,\r\nfrightened him. It gave such point to his feeling that the town was\r\nwaiting for him to make his mind up on some important matter.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, her voice, and the fact that she was there so close\r\nbeside him in her soft dark dress, thrilled him inexpressibly.\r\n\r\n“It is true I find it difficult to leave,” he stammered, losing his\r\nway deliciously in the depths of her eyes, “and especially now that\r\nMademoiselle Ilsé has come.”\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at the success of his sentence, and quite delighted\r\nwith the little gallantry of it. But at the same time he could have\r\nbitten his tongue off for having said it.\r\n\r\n“Then after all you like our little town, or you would not be pleased\r\nto stay on,” she said, ignoring the compliment.\r\n\r\n“I am enchanted with it, and enchanted with you,” he cried, feeling\r\nthat his tongue was somehow slipping beyond the control of his brain.\r\nAnd he was on the verge of saying all manner of other things of the\r\nwildest description, when the girl sprang lightly up from her chair\r\nbeside him, and made to go.\r\n\r\n“It is _soupe à l’onion_ to-day!” she cried, laughing back at him\r\nthrough the sunlight, “and I must go and see about it. Otherwise, you\r\nknow, M’sieur will not enjoy his dinner, and then, perhaps, he will\r\nleave us!”\r\n\r\nHe watched her cross the courtyard, moving with all the grace and\r\nlightness of the feline race, and her simple black dress clothed her,\r\nhe thought, exactly like the fur of the same supple species. She turned\r\nonce to laugh at him from the porch with the glass door, and then\r\nstopped a moment to speak to her mother, who sat knitting as usual in\r\nher corner seat just inside the hall-way.\r\n\r\nBut how was it, then, that the moment his eye fell upon this ungainly\r\nwoman, the pair of them appeared suddenly as other than they were?\r\nWhence came that transforming dignity and sense of power that enveloped\r\nthem both as by magic? What was it about that massive woman that\r\nmade her appear instantly regal, and set her on a throne in some\r\ndark and dreadful scenery, wielding a sceptre over the red glare of\r\nsome tempestuous orgy? And why did this slender stripling of a girl,\r\ngraceful as a willow, lithe as a young leopard, assume suddenly an air\r\nof sinister majesty, and move with flame and smoke about her head, and\r\nthe darkness of night beneath her feet?\r\n\r\nVezin caught his breath and sat there transfixed. Then, almost\r\nsimultaneously with its appearance, the queer notion vanished again,\r\nand the sunlight of day caught them both, and he heard her laughing to\r\nher mother about the _soupe à l’onion_, and saw her glancing back at\r\nhim over her dear little shoulder with a smile that made him think of a\r\ndew-kissed rose bending lightly before summer airs.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the onion soup was particularly excellent that day,\r\nbecause he saw another cover laid at his small table and, with\r\nfluttering heart, heard the waiter murmur by way of explanation that\r\n“Ma’mselle Ilsé would honour M’sieur to-day at _déjeuner_, as her\r\ncustom sometimes is with her mother’s guests.”\r\n\r\nSo actually she sat by him all through that delirious meal, talking\r\nquietly to him in easy French, seeing that he was well looked after,\r\nmixing the salad-dressing, and even helping him with her own hand.\r\nAnd, later in the afternoon, while he was smoking in the courtyard,\r\nlonging for a sight of her as soon as her duties were done, she came\r\nagain to his side, and when he rose to meet her, she stood facing him a\r\nmoment, full of a perplexing sweet shyness before she spoke--\r\n\r\n“My mother thinks you ought to know more of the beauties of our little\r\ntown, and _I_ think so too! Would M’sieur like me to be his guide,\r\nperhaps? I can show him everything, for our family has lived here for\r\nmany generations.”\r\n\r\nShe had him by the hand, indeed, before he could find a single word\r\nto express his pleasure, and led him, all unresisting, out into the\r\nstreet, yet in such a way that it seemed perfectly natural she should\r\ndo so, and without the faintest suggestion of boldness or immodesty.\r\nHer face glowed with the pleasure and interest of it, and with her\r\nshort dress and tumbled hair she looked every bit the charming child of\r\nseventeen that she was, innocent and playful, proud of her native town,\r\nand alive beyond her years to the sense of its ancient beauty.\r\n\r\nSo they went over the town together, and she showed him what she\r\nconsidered its chief interest: the tumble-down old house where her\r\nforebears had lived; the sombre, aristocratic-looking mansion where her\r\nmother’s family dwelt for centuries, and the ancient market-place where\r\nseveral hundred years before the witches had been burnt by the score.\r\nShe kept up a lively running stream of talk about it all, of which he\r\nunderstood not a fiftieth part as he trudged along by her side, cursing\r\nhis forty-five years and feeling all the yearnings of his early manhood\r\nrevive and jeer at him. And, as she talked, England and Surbiton\r\nseemed very far away indeed, almost in another age of the world’s\r\nhistory. Her voice touched something immeasurably old in him, something\r\nthat slept deep. It lulled the surface parts of his consciousness to\r\nsleep, allowing what was far more ancient to awaken. Like the town,\r\nwith its elaborate pretence of modern active life, the upper layers\r\nof his being became dulled, soothed, muffled, and what lay underneath\r\nbegan to stir in its sleep. That big Curtain swayed a little to and\r\nfro. Presently it might lift altogether....\r\n\r\nHe began to understand a little better at last. The mood of the town\r\nwas reproducing itself in him. In proportion as his ordinary external\r\nself became muffled, that inner secret life, that was far more real and\r\nvital, asserted itself. And this girl was surely the high-priestess of\r\nit all, the chief instrument of its accomplishment. New thoughts, with\r\nnew interpretations, flooded his mind as she walked beside him through\r\nthe winding streets, while the picturesque old gabled town, softly\r\ncoloured in the sunset, had never appeared to him so wholly wonderful\r\nand seductive.\r\n\r\nAnd only one curious incident came to disturb and puzzle him, slight\r\nin itself, but utterly inexplicable, bringing white terror into the\r\nchild’s face and a scream to her laughing lips. He had merely pointed\r\nto a column of blue smoke that rose from the burning autumn leaves\r\nand made a picture against the red roofs, and had then run to the\r\nwall and called her to his side to watch the flames shooting here and\r\nthere through the heap of rubbish. Yet, at the sight of it, as though\r\ntaken by surprise, her face had altered dreadfully, and she had turned\r\nand run like the wind, calling out wild sentences to him as she ran,\r\nof which he had not understood a single word, except that the fire\r\napparently frightened her, and she wanted to get quickly away from it,\r\nand to get him away too.\r\n\r\nYet five minutes later she was as calm and happy again as though\r\nnothing had happened to alarm or waken troubled thoughts in her, and\r\nthey had both forgotten the incident.\r\n\r\nThey were leaning over the ruined ramparts together listening to\r\nthe weird music of the band as he had heard it the first day of his\r\narrival. It moved him again profoundly as it had done before, and\r\nsomehow he managed to find his tongue and his best French. The girl\r\nleaned across the stones close beside him. No one was about. Driven by\r\nsome remorseless engine within he began to stammer something--he hardly\r\nknew what--of his strange admiration for her. Almost at the first word\r\nshe sprang lightly off the wall and came up smiling in front of him,\r\njust touching his knees as he sat there. She was hatless as usual, and\r\nthe sun caught her hair and one side of her cheek and throat.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m _so_ glad!” she cried, clapping her little hands softly in his\r\nface, “so very glad, because that means that if you like me you must\r\nalso like what I do, and what I belong to.”\r\n\r\nAlready he regretted bitterly having lost control of himself. Something\r\nin the phrasing of her sentence chilled him. He knew the fear of\r\nembarking upon an unknown and dangerous sea.\r\n\r\n“You will take part in our real life, I mean,” she added softly,\r\nwith an indescribable coaxing of manner, as though she noticed his\r\nshrinking. “You will come back to us.”\r\n\r\nAlready this slip of a child seemed to dominate him; he felt her power\r\ncoming over him more and more; something emanated from her that stole\r\nover his senses and made him aware that her personality, for all its\r\nsimple grace, held forces that were stately, imposing, august. He saw\r\nher again moving through smoke and flame amid broken and tempestuous\r\nscenery, alarmingly strong, her terrible mother by her side. Dimly this\r\nshone through her smile and appearance of charming innocence.\r\n\r\n“You will, I know,” she repeated, holding him with her eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were quite alone up there on the ramparts, and the sensation that\r\nshe was overmastering him stirred a wild sensuousness in his blood. The\r\nmingled abandon and reserve in her attracted him furiously, and all of\r\nhim that was man rose up and resisted the creeping influence, at the\r\nsame time acclaiming it with the full delight of his forgotten youth.\r\nAn irresistible desire came to him to question her, to summon what\r\nstill remained to him of his own little personality in an effort to\r\nretain the right to his normal self.\r\n\r\nThe girl had grown quiet again, and was now leaning on the broad wall\r\nclose beside him, gazing out across the darkening plain, her elbows on\r\nthe coping, motionless as a figure carved in stone. He took his courage\r\nin both hands.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Ilsé,” he said, unconsciously imitating her own purring\r\nsoftness of voice, yet aware that he was utterly in earnest, “what is\r\nthe meaning of this town, and what is this real life you speak of? And\r\nwhy is it that the people watch me from morning to night? Tell me what\r\nit all means? And, tell me,” he added more quickly with passion in his\r\nvoice, “what you really are--yourself?”\r\n\r\nShe turned her head and looked at him through half-closed eyelids, her\r\ngrowing inner excitement betraying itself by the faint colour that ran\r\nlike a shadow across her face.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,”--he faltered oddly under her gaze--“that I have some\r\nright to know----”\r\n\r\nSuddenly she opened her eyes to the full. “You love me, then?” she\r\nasked softly.\r\n\r\n“I swear,” he cried impetuously, moved as by the force of a rising\r\ntide, “I never felt before--I have never known any other girl who----”\r\n\r\n“Then you _have_ the right to know,” she calmly interrupted his\r\nconfused confession; “for love shares all secrets.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, and a thrill like fire ran swiftly through him. Her words\r\nlifted him off the earth, and he felt a radiant happiness, followed\r\nalmost the same instant in horrible contrast by the thought of death.\r\nHe became aware that she had turned her eyes upon his own and was\r\nspeaking again.\r\n\r\n“The real life I speak of,” she whispered, “is the old, old life\r\nwithin, the life of long ago, the life to which you, too, once\r\nbelonged, and to which you still belong.”\r\n\r\nA faint wave of memory troubled the deeps of his soul as her low\r\nvoice sank into him. What she was saying he knew instinctively to be\r\ntrue, even though he could not as yet understand its full purport.\r\nHis present life seemed slipping from him as he listened, merging his\r\npersonality in one that was far older and greater. It was this loss of\r\nhis present self that brought to him the thought of death.\r\n\r\n“You came here,” she went on, “with the purpose of seeking it, and the\r\npeople felt your presence and are waiting to know what you decide,\r\nwhether you will leave them without having found it, or whether----”\r\n\r\nHer eyes remained fixed upon his own, but her face began to change,\r\ngrowing larger and darker with an expression of age.\r\n\r\n“It is their thoughts constantly playing about your soul that makes\r\nyou feel they watch you. They do not watch you with their eyes. The\r\npurposes of their inner life are calling to you, seeking to claim you.\r\nYou were all part of the same life long, long ago, and now they want\r\nyou back again among them.”\r\n\r\nVezin’s timid heart sank with dread as he listened; but the girl’s\r\neyes held him with a net of joy so that he had no wish to escape. She\r\nfascinated him, as it were, clean out of his normal self.\r\n\r\n“Alone, however, the people could never have caught and held you,”\r\nshe resumed. “The motive force was not strong enough; it has faded\r\nthrough all these years. But I”--she paused a moment and looked at him\r\nwith complete confidence in her splendid eyes--“I possess the spell to\r\nconquer you and hold you: the spell of old love. I can win you back\r\nagain and make you live the old life with me, for the force of the\r\nancient tie between us, if I choose to use it, is irresistible. And\r\nI do choose to use it I still want you. And you, dear soul of my dim\r\npast”--she pressed closer to him so that her breath passed across his\r\neyes, and her voice positively sang--“I mean to have you, for you love\r\nme and are utterly at my mercy.”\r\n\r\nVezin heard, and yet did not hear; understood, yet did not understand.\r\nHe had passed into a condition of exaltation. The world was beneath his\r\nfeet, made of music and flowers, and he was flying somewhere far above\r\nit through the sunshine of pure delight. He was breathless and giddy\r\nwith the wonder of her words. They intoxicated him. And, still, the\r\nterror of it all, the dreadful thought of death, pressed ever behind\r\nher sentences. For flames shot through her voice out of black smoke and\r\nlicked at his soul.\r\n\r\nAnd they communicated with one another, it seemed to him, by a process\r\nof swift telepathy, for his French could never have compassed all he\r\nsaid to her. Yet she understood perfectly, and what she said to him was\r\nlike the recital of verses long since known. And the mingled pain and\r\nsweetness of it as he listened were almost more than his little soul\r\ncould hold.\r\n\r\n“Yet I came here wholly by chance----” he heard himself saying.\r\n\r\n“No,” she cried with passion, “you came here because I called to you. I\r\nhave called to you for years, and you came with the whole force of the\r\npast behind you. You had to come, for I own you, and I claim you.”\r\n\r\nShe rose again and moved closer, looking at him with a certain\r\ninsolence in the face--the insolence of power.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set behind the towers of the old cathedral and the darkness\r\nrose up from the plain and enveloped them. The music of the band had\r\nceased. The leaves of the plane trees hung motionless, but the chill\r\nof the autumn evening rose about them and made Vezin shiver. There\r\nwas no sound but the sound of their voices and the occasional soft\r\nrustle of the girl’s dress. He could hear the blood rushing in his\r\nears. He scarcely realised where he was or what he was doing. Some\r\nterrible magic of the imagination drew him deeply down into the tombs\r\nof his own being, telling him in no unfaltering voice that her words\r\nshadowed forth the truth. And this simple little French maid, speaking\r\nbeside him with so strange authority, he saw curiously alter into quite\r\nanother being. As he stared into her eyes, the picture in his mind grew\r\nand lived, dressing itself vividly to his inner vision with a degree\r\nof reality he was compelled to acknowledge. As once before, he saw her\r\ntall and stately, moving through wild and broken scenery of forests and\r\nmountain caverns, the glare of flames behind her head and clouds of\r\nshifting smoke about her feet. Dark leaves encircled her hair, flying\r\nloosely in the wind, and her limbs shone through the merest rags of\r\nclothing. Others were about her too, and ardent eyes on all sides cast\r\ndelirious glances upon her, but her own eyes were always for One only,\r\none whom she held by the hand. For she was leading the dance in some\r\ntempestuous orgy to the music of chanting voices, and the dance she led\r\ncircled about a great and awful Figure on a throne, brooding over the\r\nscene through lurid vapours, while innumerable other wild faces and\r\nforms crowded furiously about her in the dance. But the one she held by\r\nthe hand he knew to be himself, and the monstrous shape upon the throne\r\nhe knew to be her mother.\r\n\r\nThe vision rose within him, rushing to him down the long years\r\nof buried time, crying aloud to him with the voice of memory\r\nreawakened.... And then the scene faded away and he saw the clear\r\ncircle of the girl’s eyes gazing steadfastly into his own, and she\r\nbecame once more the pretty little daughter of the innkeeper, and he\r\nfound his voice again.\r\n\r\n“And you,” he whispered tremblingly--“you child of visions and\r\nenchantment, how is it that you so bewitch me that I loved you even\r\nbefore I saw?”\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up beside him with an air of rare dignity.\r\n\r\n“The call of the Past,” she said; “and besides,” she added proudly, “in\r\nthe real life I am a princess----”\r\n\r\n“A princess!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“----and my mother is a queen!”\r\n\r\nAt this, little Vezin utterly lost his head. Delight tore at his heart\r\nand swept him into sheer ecstasy. To hear that sweet singing voice, and\r\nto see those adorable little lips utter such things, upset his balance\r\nbeyond all hope of control. He took her in his arms and covered her\r\nunresisting face with kisses.\r\n\r\nBut even while he did so, and while the hot passion swept him, he\r\nfelt that she was soft and loathsome, and that her answering kisses\r\nstained his very soul.... And when, presently, she had freed herself\r\nand vanished into the darkness, he stood there, leaning against the\r\nwall in a state of collapse, creeping with horror from the touch of\r\nher yielding body, and inwardly raging at the weakness that he already\r\ndimly realised must prove his undoing.\r\n\r\nAnd from the shadows of the old buildings into which she disappeared\r\nthere rose in the stillness of the night a singular, long-drawn cry,\r\nwhich at first he took for laughter, but which later he was sure he\r\nrecognised as the almost human wailing of a cat.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nFor a long time Vezin leant there against the wall, alone with his\r\nsurging thoughts and emotions. He understood at length that he had\r\ndone the one thing necessary to call down upon him the whole force of\r\nthis ancient Past. For in those passionate kisses he had acknowledged\r\nthe tie of olden days, and had revived it. And the memory of that soft\r\nimpalpable caress in the darkness of the inn corridor came back to him\r\nwith a shudder. The girl had first mastered him, and then led him to\r\nthe one act that was necessary for her purpose. He had been waylaid,\r\nafter the lapse of centuries--caught, and conquered.\r\n\r\nDimly he realised this, and sought to make plans for his escape. But,\r\nfor the moment at any rate, he was powerless to manage his thoughts or\r\nwill, for the sweet, fantastic madness of the whole adventure mounted\r\nto his brain like a spell, and he gloried in the feeling that he was\r\nutterly enchanted and moving in a world so much larger and wilder than\r\nthe one he had ever been accustomed to.\r\n\r\nThe moon, pale and enormous, was just rising over the sea-like plain,\r\nwhen at last he rose to go. Her slanting rays drew all the houses into\r\nnew perspective, so that their roofs, already glistening with dew,\r\nseemed to stretch much higher into the sky than usual, and their gables\r\nand quaint old towers lay far away in its purple reaches.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral appeared unreal in a silver mist. He moved softly,\r\nkeeping to the shadows; but the streets were all deserted and very\r\nsilent; the doors were closed, the shutters fastened. Not a soul was\r\nastir. The hush of night lay over everything; it was like a town of\r\nthe dead, a churchyard with gigantic and grotesque tombstones.\r\n\r\nWondering where all the busy life of the day had so utterly disappeared\r\nto, he made his way to a back door that entered the inn by means of\r\nthe stables, thinking thus to reach his room unobserved. He reached\r\nthe courtyard safely and crossed it by keeping close to the shadow of\r\nthe wall. He sidled down it, mincing along on tiptoe, just as the old\r\nmen did when they entered the _salle à manger_. He was horrified to\r\nfind himself doing this instinctively. A strange impulse came to him,\r\ncatching him somehow in the centre of his body--an impulse to drop upon\r\nall fours and run swiftly and silently. He glanced upwards and the idea\r\ncame to him to leap up upon his window-sill overhead instead of going\r\nround by the stairs. This occurred to him as the easiest, and most\r\nnatural way. It was like the beginning of some horrible transformation\r\nof himself into something else. He was fearfully strung up.\r\n\r\nThe moon was higher now, and the shadows very dark along the side of\r\nthe street where he moved. He kept among the deepest of them, and\r\nreached the porch with the glass doors.\r\n\r\nBut here there was light; the inmates, unfortunately, were still about.\r\nHoping to slip across the hall unobserved and reach the stairs, he\r\nopened the door carefully and stole in. Then he saw that the hall was\r\nnot empty. A large dark thing lay against the wall on his left. At\r\nfirst he thought it must be household articles. Then it moved, and he\r\nthought it was an immense cat, distorted in some way by the play of\r\nlight and shadow. Then it rose straight up before him and he saw that\r\nit was the proprietress.\r\n\r\nWhat she had been doing in this position he could only venture a\r\ndreadful guess, but the moment she stood up and faced him he was aware\r\nof some terrible dignity clothing her about that instantly recalled the\r\ngirl’s strange saying that she was a queen. Huge and sinister she stood\r\nthere under the little oil lamp; alone with him in the empty hall. Awe\r\nstirred in his heart, and the roots of some ancient fear. He felt that\r\nhe must bow to her and make some kind of obeisance. The impulse was\r\nfierce and irresistible, as of long habit. He glanced quickly about\r\nhim. There was no one there. Then he deliberately inclined his head\r\ntowards her. He bowed.\r\n\r\n“Enfin! M’sieur s’est donc décidé. C’est bien alors. J’en suis\r\ncontente.”\r\n\r\nHer words came to him sonorously as through a great open space.\r\n\r\nThen the great figure came suddenly across the flagged hall at him and\r\nseized his trembling hands. Some overpowering force moved with her and\r\ncaught him.\r\n\r\n“On pourrait faire un p’tit tour ensemble, n’est-ce pas? Nous y allons\r\ncette nuit et il faut s’exercer un peu d’avance pour cela. Ilsé, Ilsé,\r\nviens donc ici. Viens vite!”\r\n\r\nAnd she whirled him round in the opening steps of some dance that\r\nseemed oddly and horribly familiar. They made no sound on the stones,\r\nthis strangely assorted couple. It was all soft and stealthy. And\r\npresently, when the air seemed to thicken like smoke, and a red glare\r\nas of flame shot through it, he was aware that some one else had joined\r\nthem and that his hand the mother had released was now tightly held\r\nby the daughter. Ilsé had come in answer to the call, and he saw her\r\nwith leaves of vervain twined in her dark hair, clothed in tattered\r\nvestiges of some curious garment, beautiful as the night, and horribly,\r\nodiously, loathsomely seductive.\r\n\r\n“To the Sabbath! to the Sabbath!” they cried. “On to the Witches’\r\nSabbath!”\r\n\r\nUp and down that narrow hall they danced, the women on each side of\r\nhim, to the wildest measure he had ever imagined, yet which he dimly,\r\ndreadfully remembered, till the lamp on the wall flickered and went\r\nout, and they were left in total darkness. And the devil woke in his\r\nheart with a thousand vile suggestions and made him afraid.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they released his hands and he heard the voice of the mother\r\ncry that it was time, and they must go. Which way they went he did\r\nnot pause to see. He only realised that he was free, and he blundered\r\nthrough the darkness till he found the stairs and then tore up them to\r\nhis room as though all hell was at his heels.\r\n\r\nHe flung himself on the sofa, with his face in his hands, and groaned.\r\nSwiftly reviewing a dozen ways of immediate escape, all equally\r\nimpossible, he finally decided that the only thing to do for the moment\r\nwas to sit quiet and wait. He must see what was going to happen. At\r\nleast in the privacy of his own bedroom he would be fairly safe. The\r\ndoor was locked. He crossed over and softly opened the window which\r\ngave upon the courtyard and also permitted a partial view of the hall\r\nthrough the glass doors.\r\n\r\nAs he did so the hum and murmur of a great activity reached his ears\r\nfrom the streets beyond--the sound of footsteps and voices muffled by\r\ndistance. He leaned out cautiously and listened. The moonlight was\r\nclear and strong now, but his own window was in shadow, the silver\r\ndisc being still behind the house. It came to him irresistibly that\r\nthe inhabitants of the town, who a little while before had all been\r\ninvisible behind closed doors, were now issuing forth, busy upon some\r\nsecret and unholy errand. He listened intently.\r\n\r\nAt first everything about him was silent, but soon he became aware of\r\nmovements going on in the house itself. Rustlings and cheepings came\r\nto him across that still, moonlit yard. A concourse of living beings\r\nsent the hum of their activity into the night. Things were on the move\r\neverywhere. A biting, pungent odour rose through the air, coming he\r\nknew not whence. Presently his eyes became glued to the windows of\r\nthe opposite wall where the moonshine fell in a soft blaze. The roof\r\noverhead, and behind him, was reflected clearly in the panes of glass,\r\nand he saw the outlines of dark bodies moving with long footsteps over\r\nthe tiles and along the coping. They passed swiftly and silently,\r\nshaped like immense cats, in an endless procession across the pictured\r\nglass, and then appeared to leap down to a lower level where he lost\r\nsight of them. He just caught the soft thudding of their leaps.\r\nSometimes their shadows fell upon the white wall opposite, and then\r\nhe could not make out whether they were the shadows of human beings\r\nor of cats. They seemed to change swiftly from one to the other. The\r\ntransformation looked horribly real, for they leaped like human beings,\r\nyet changed swiftly in the air immediately afterwards, and dropped like\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe yard, too, beneath him, was now alive with the creeping movements\r\nof dark forms all stealthily drawing towards the porch with the glass\r\ndoors. They kept so closely to the wall that he could not determine\r\ntheir actual shape, but when he saw that they passed on to the great\r\ncongregation that was gathering in the hall, he understood that these\r\nwere the creatures whose leaping shadows he had first seen reflected in\r\nthe window-panes opposite. They were coming from all parts of the town,\r\nreaching the appointed meeting-place across the roofs and tiles, and\r\nspringing from level to level till they came to the yard.\r\n\r\nThen a new sound caught his ear, and he saw that the windows all about\r\nhim were being softly opened, and that to each window came a face. A\r\nmoment later figures began dropping hurriedly down into the yard. And\r\nthese figures, as they lowered themselves down from the windows, were\r\nhuman, he saw; but once safely in the yard they fell upon all fours and\r\nchanged in the swiftest possible second into--cats--huge, silent cats.\r\nThey ran in streams to join the main body in the hall beyond.\r\n\r\nSo, after all, the rooms in the house had not been empty and unoccupied.\r\n\r\nMoreover, what he saw no longer filled him with amazement. For he\r\nremembered it all. It was familiar. It had all happened before just\r\nso, hundreds of times, and he himself had taken part in it and known\r\nthe wild madness of it all. The outline of the old building changed,\r\nthe yard grew larger, and he seemed to be staring down upon it from\r\na much greater height through smoky vapours. And, as he looked, half\r\nremembering, the old pains of long ago, fierce and sweet, furiously\r\nassailed him, and the blood stirred horribly as he heard the Call of\r\nthe Dance again in his heart and tasted the ancient magic of Ilsé\r\nwhirling by his side.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he started back. A great lithe cat had leaped softly up from\r\nthe shadows below on to the sill close to his face, and was staring\r\nfixedly at him with the eyes of a human. “Come,” it seemed to say,\r\n“come with us to the Dance! Change as of old! Transform yourself\r\nswiftly and come!” Only too well he understood the creature’s soundless\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nIt was gone again in a flash with scarcely a sound of its padded feet\r\non the stones, and then others dropped by the score down the side of\r\nthe house, past his very eyes, all changing as they fell and darting\r\naway rapidly, softly, towards the gathering point. And again he felt\r\nthe dreadful desire to do likewise; to murmur the old incantation,\r\nand then drop upon hands and knees and run swiftly for the great\r\nflying leap into the air. Oh, how the passion of it rose within him\r\nlike a flood, twisting his very entrails, sending his heart’s desire\r\nflaming forth into the night for the old, old Dance of the Sorcerers\r\nat the Witches’ Sabbath! The whirl of the stars was about him; once\r\nmore he met the magic of the moon. The power of the wind, rushing\r\nfrom precipice and forest, leaping from cliff to cliff across the\r\nvalleys, tore him away.... He heard the cries of the dancers and their\r\nwild laughter, and with this savage girl in his embrace he danced\r\nfuriously about the dim Throne where sate the Figure with the sceptre\r\nof majesty....\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, all became hushed and still, and the fever died down a\r\nlittle in his heart. The calm moonlight flooded a courtyard empty and\r\ndeserted. They had started. The procession was off into the sky. And he\r\nwas left behind--alone.\r\n\r\nVezin tiptoed softly across the room and unlocked the door. The murmur\r\nfrom the streets, growing momentarily as he advanced, met his ears. He\r\nmade his way with the utmost caution down the corridor. At the head of\r\nthe stairs he paused and listened. Below him, the hall where they had\r\ngathered was dark and still, but through opened doors and windows on\r\nthe far side of the building came the sound of a great throng moving\r\nfarther and farther into the distance.\r\n\r\nHe made his way down the creaking wooden stairs, dreading yet longing\r\nto meet some straggler who should point the way, but finding no one;\r\nacross the dark hall, so lately thronged with living, moving things,\r\nand out through the opened front doors into the street. He could not\r\nbelieve that he was really left behind, really forgotten, that he had\r\nbeen purposely permitted to escape. It perplexed him.\r\n\r\nNervously he peered about him, and up and down the street; then, seeing\r\nnothing, advanced slowly down the pavement.\r\n\r\nThe whole town, as he went, showed itself empty and deserted, as\r\nthough a great wind had blown everything alive out of it. The doors\r\nand windows of the houses stood open to the night; nothing stirred;\r\nmoonlight and silence lay over all. The night lay about him like a\r\ncloak. The air, soft and cool, caressed his cheek like the touch of a\r\ngreat furry paw. He gained confidence and began to walk quickly, though\r\nstill keeping to the shadowed side. Nowhere could he discover the\r\nfaintest sign of the great unholy exodus he knew had just taken place.\r\nThe moon sailed high over all in a sky, cloudless and serene.\r\n\r\nHardly realising where he was going, he crossed the open market-place\r\nand so came to the ramparts, whence he knew a pathway descended to the\r\nhigh road and along which he could make good his escape to one of the\r\nother little towns that lay to the northward, and so to the railway.\r\n\r\nBut first he paused and gazed out over the scene at his feet where the\r\ngreat plain lay like a silver map of some dream country. The still\r\nbeauty of it entered his heart, increasing his sense of bewilderment\r\nand unreality. No air stirred, the leaves of the plane trees stood\r\nmotionless, the near details were defined with the sharpness of day\r\nagainst dark shadows, and in the distance the fields and woods melted\r\naway into haze and shimmering mistiness.\r\n\r\nBut the breath caught in his throat and he stood stockstill as though\r\ntransfixed when his gaze passed from the horizon and fell upon the near\r\nprospect in the depth of the valley at his feet. The whole lower slopes\r\nof the hill, that lay hid from the brightness of the moon, were aglow,\r\nand through the glare he saw countless moving forms, shifting thick and\r\nfast between the openings of the trees; while overhead, like leaves\r\ndriven by the wind, he discerned flying shapes that hovered darkly one\r\nmoment against the sky and then settled down with cries and weird\r\nsinging through the branches into the region that was aflame.\r\n\r\nSpellbound, he stood and stared for a time that he could not measure.\r\nAnd then, moved by one of the terrible impulses that seemed to control\r\nthe whole adventure, he climbed swiftly upon the top of the broad\r\ncoping, and balanced a moment where the valley gaped at his feet. But\r\nin that very instant, as he stood hovering, a sudden movement among the\r\nshadows of the houses caught his eye, and he turned to see the outline\r\nof a large animal dart swiftly across the open space behind him, and\r\nland with a flying leap upon the top of the wall a little lower down.\r\nIt ran like the wind to his feet and then rose up beside him upon the\r\nramparts. A shiver seemed to run through the moonlight, and his sight\r\ntrembled for a second. His heart pulsed fearfully. Ilsé stood beside\r\nhim, peering into his face.\r\n\r\nSome dark substance, he saw, stained the girl’s face and skin, shining\r\nin the moonlight as she stretched her hands towards him; she was\r\ndressed in wretched tattered garments that yet became her mightily; rue\r\nand vervain twined about her temples; her eyes glittered with unholy\r\nlight. He only just controlled the wild impulse to take her in his arms\r\nand leap with her from their giddy perch into the valley below.\r\n\r\n“See!” she cried, pointing with an arm on which the rags fluttered in\r\nthe rising wind towards the forest aglow in the distance. “See where\r\nthey await us! The woods are alive! Already the Great Ones are there,\r\nand the dance will soon begin! The salve is here! Anoint yourself and\r\ncome!”\r\n\r\nThough a moment before the sky was clear and cloudless, yet even while\r\nshe spoke the face of the moon grew dark and the wind began to toss\r\nin the crests of the plane trees at his feet. Stray gusts brought the\r\nsounds of hoarse singing and crying from the lower slopes of the hill,\r\nand the pungent odour he had already noticed about the courtyard of the\r\ninn rose about him in the air.\r\n\r\n“Transform, transform!” she cried again, her voice rising like a song.\r\n“Rub well your skin before you fly. Come! Come with me to the Sabbath,\r\nto the madness of its furious delight, to the sweet abandonment of\r\nits evil worship! See! the Great Ones are there, and the terrible\r\nSacraments prepared. The Throne is occupied. Anoint and come! Anoint\r\nand come!”\r\n\r\nShe grew to the height of a tree beside him, leaping upon the wall with\r\nflaming eyes and hair strewn upon the night. He too began to change\r\nswiftly. Her hands touched the skin of his face and neck, streaking him\r\nwith the burning salve that sent the old magic into his blood with the\r\npower before which fades all that is good.\r\n\r\nA wild roar came up to his ears from the heart of the wood, and the\r\ngirl, when she heard it, leaped upon the wall in the frenzy of her\r\nwicked joy.\r\n\r\n“Satan is there!” she screamed, rushing upon him and striving to draw\r\nhim with her to the edge of the wall. “Satan has come! The Sacraments\r\ncall us! Come, with your dear apostate soul, and we will worship and\r\ndance till the moon dies and the world is forgotten!”\r\n\r\nJust saving himself from the dreadful plunge, Vezin struggled to\r\nrelease himself from her grasp, while the passion tore at his reins and\r\nall but mastered him. He shrieked aloud, not knowing what he said, and\r\nthen he shrieked again. It was the old impulses, the old awful habits\r\ninstinctively finding voice; for though it seemed to him that he merely\r\nshrieked nonsense, the words he uttered really had meaning in them, and\r\nwere intelligible. It was the ancient call. And it was heard below. It\r\nwas answered.\r\n\r\nThe wind whistled at the skirts of his coat as the air round him\r\ndarkened with many flying forms crowding upwards out of the valley. The\r\ncrying of hoarse voices smote upon his ears, coming closer. Strokes of\r\nwind buffeted him, tearing him this way and that along the crumbling\r\ntop of the stone wall; and Ilsé clung to him with her long shining\r\narms, smooth and bare, holding him fast about the neck. But not Ilsé\r\nalone, for a dozen of them surrounded him, dropping out of the air.\r\nThe pungent odour of the anointed bodies stifled him, exciting him to\r\nthe old madness of the Sabbath, the dance of the witches and sorcerers\r\ndoing honour to the personified Evil of the world.\r\n\r\n“Anoint and away! Anoint and away!” they cried in wild chorus about\r\nhim. “To the Dance that never dies! To the sweet and fearful fantasy of\r\nevil!”\r\n\r\nAnother moment and he would have yielded and gone, for his will turned\r\nsoft and the flood of passionate memory all but overwhelmed him,\r\nwhen--so can a small thing alter the whole course of an adventure--he\r\ncaught his foot upon a loose stone in the edge of the wall, and\r\nthen fell with a sudden crash on to the ground below. But he fell\r\ntowards the houses, in the open space of dust and cobble stones, and\r\nfortunately not into the gaping depth of the valley on the farther side.\r\n\r\nAnd they, too, came in a tumbling heap about him, like flies upon a\r\npiece of food, but as they fell he was released for a moment from\r\nthe power of their touch, and in that brief instant of freedom there\r\nflashed into his mind the sudden intuition that saved him. Before he\r\ncould regain his feet he saw them scrabbling awkwardly back upon the\r\nwall, as though bat-like they could only fly by dropping from a height,\r\nand had no hold upon him in the open. Then, seeing them perched there\r\nin a row like cats upon a roof, all dark and singularly shapeless,\r\ntheir eyes like lamps, the sudden memory came back to him of Ilsé’s\r\nterror at the sight of fire.\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash he found his matches and lit the dead leaves that lay\r\nunder the wall.\r\n\r\nDry and withered, they caught fire at once, and the wind carried the\r\nflame in a long line down the length of the wall, licking upwards as\r\nit ran; and with shrieks and wailings, the crowded row of forms upon\r\nthe top melted away into the air on the other side, and were gone with\r\na great rush and whirring of their bodies down into the heart of the\r\nhaunted valley, leaving Vezin breathless and shaken in the middle of\r\nthe deserted ground.\r\n\r\n“Ilsé!” he called feebly; “Ilsé!” for his heart ached to think that she\r\nwas really gone to the great Dance without him, and that he had lost\r\nthe opportunity of its fearful joy. Yet at the same time his relief\r\nwas so great, and he was so dazed and troubled in mind with the whole\r\nthing, that he hardly knew what he was saying, and only cried aloud in\r\nthe fierce storm of his emotion....\r\n\r\nThe fire under the wall ran its course, and the moonlight came out\r\nagain, soft and clear, from its temporary eclipse. With one last\r\nshuddering look at the ruined ramparts, and a feeling of horrid wonder\r\nfor the haunted valley beyond, where the shapes still crowded and flew,\r\nhe turned his face towards the town and slowly made his way in the\r\ndirection of the hotel.\r\n\r\nAnd as he went, a great wailing of cries, and a sound of howling,\r\nfollowed him from the gleaming forest below, growing fainter and\r\nfainter with the bursts of wind as he disappeared between the houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n“It may seem rather abrupt to you, this sudden tame ending,” said\r\nArthur Vezin, glancing with flushed face and timid eyes at Dr. Silence\r\nsitting there with his notebook, “but the fact is--er--from that moment\r\nmy memory seems to have failed rather. I have no distinct recollection\r\nof how I got home or what precisely I did.\r\n\r\n“It appears I never went back to the inn at all. I only dimly recollect\r\nracing down a long white road in the moonlight, past woods and\r\nvillages, still and deserted, and then the dawn came up, and I saw the\r\ntowers of a biggish town and so came to a station.\r\n\r\n“But, long before that, I remember pausing somewhere on the road and\r\nlooking back to where the hill-town of my adventure stood up in the\r\nmoonlight, and thinking how exactly like a great monstrous cat it lay\r\nthere upon the plain, its huge front paws lying down the two main\r\nstreets, and the twin and broken towers of the cathedral marking its\r\ntorn ears against the sky. That picture stays in my mind with the\r\nutmost vividness to this day.\r\n\r\n“Another thing remains in my mind from that escape--namely, the sudden\r\nsharp reminder that I had not paid my bill, and the decision I made,\r\nstanding there on the dusty highroad, that the small baggage I had left\r\nbehind would more than settle for my indebtedness.\r\n\r\n“For the rest, I can only tell you that I got coffee and bread at a\r\ncafé on the outskirts of this town I had come to, and soon after found\r\nmy way to the station and caught a train later in the day. That same\r\nevening I reached London.”\r\n\r\n“And how long altogether,” asked John Silence quietly, “do you think\r\nyou stayed in the town of the adventure?”\r\n\r\nVezin looked up sheepishly.\r\n\r\n“I was coming to that,” he resumed, with apologetic wrigglings of his\r\nbody. “In London I found that I was a whole week out in my reckoning of\r\ntime. I had stayed over a week in the town, and it ought to have been\r\nSeptember 15th,--instead of which it was only September 10th!”\r\n\r\n“So that, in reality, you had only stayed a night or two in the inn?”\r\nqueried the doctor.\r\n\r\nVezin hesitated before replying. He shuffled upon the mat.\r\n\r\n“I must have gained time somewhere,” he said at length--“somewhere or\r\nsomehow. I certainly had a week to my credit. I can’t explain it. I can\r\nonly give you the fact.”\r\n\r\n“And this happened to you last year, since when you have never been\r\nback to the place?”\r\n\r\n“Last autumn, yes,” murmured Vezin; “and I have never dared to go\r\nback. I think I never want to.”\r\n\r\n“And, tell me,” asked Dr. Silence at length, when he saw that the\r\nlittle man had evidently come to the end of his words and had nothing\r\nmore to say, “had you ever read up the subject of the old witchcraft\r\npractices during the Middle Ages, or been at all interested in the\r\nsubject?”\r\n\r\n“Never!” declared Vezin emphatically. “I had never given a thought to\r\nsuch matters so far as I know----”\r\n\r\n“Or to the question of reincarnation, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Never--before my adventure; but I have since,” he replied\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, something still on the man’s mind that he wished\r\nto relieve himself of by confession, yet could with difficulty bring\r\nhimself to mention; and it was only after the sympathetic tactfulness\r\nof the doctor had provided numerous openings that he at length availed\r\nhimself of one of them, and stammered that he would like to show him\r\nthe marks he still had on his neck where, he said, the girl had touched\r\nhim with her anointed hands.\r\n\r\nHe took off his collar after infinite fumbling hesitation, and lowered\r\nhis shirt a little for the doctor to see. And there, on the surface of\r\nthe skin, lay a faint reddish line across the shoulder and extending\r\na little way down the back towards the spine. It certainly indicated\r\nexactly the position an arm might have taken in the act of embracing.\r\nAnd on the other side of the neck, slightly higher up, was a similar\r\nmark, though not quite so clearly defined.\r\n\r\n“That was where she held me that night on the ramparts,” he whispered,\r\na strange light coming and going in his eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was some weeks later when I again found occasion to consult John\r\nSilence concerning another extraordinary case that had come under my\r\nnotice, and we fell to discussing Vezin’s story. Since hearing it,\r\nthe doctor had made investigations on his own account, and one of his\r\nsecretaries had discovered that Vezin’s ancestors had actually lived\r\nfor generations in the very town where the adventure came to him. Two\r\nof them, both women, had been tried and convicted as witches, and had\r\nbeen burned alive at the stake. Moreover, it had not been difficult to\r\nprove that the very inn where Vezin stayed was built about 1700 upon\r\nthe spot where the funeral pyres stood and the executions took place.\r\nThe town was a sort of headquarters for all the sorcerers and witches\r\nof the entire region, and after conviction they were burnt there\r\nliterally by scores.\r\n\r\n“It seems strange,” continued the doctor, “that Vezin should have\r\nremained ignorant of all this; but, on the other hand, it was not the\r\nkind of history that successive generations would have been anxious to\r\nkeep alive, or to repeat to their children. Therefore I am inclined to\r\nthink he still knows nothing about it.\r\n\r\n“The whole adventure seems to have been a very vivid revival of the\r\nmemories of an earlier life, caused by coming directly into contact\r\nwith the living forces still intense enough to hang about the place,\r\nand, by a most singular chance too, with the very souls who had taken\r\npart with him in the events of that particular life. For the mother\r\nand daughter who impressed him so strangely must have been leading\r\nactors, with himself, in the scenes and practices of witchcraft which\r\nat that period dominated the imaginations of the whole country.\r\n\r\n“One has only to read the histories of the times to know that\r\nthese witches claimed the power of transforming themselves into\r\nvarious animals, both for the purposes of disguise and also to\r\nconvey themselves swiftly to the scenes of their imaginary orgies.\r\nLycanthropy, or the power to change themselves into wolves, was\r\neverywhere believed in, and the ability to transform themselves into\r\ncats by rubbing their bodies with a special salve or ointment provided\r\nby Satan himself, found equal credence. The witchcraft trials abound in\r\nevidences of such universal beliefs.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence quoted chapter and verse from many writers on the subject,\r\nand showed how every detail of Vezin’s adventure had a basis in the\r\npractices of those dark days.\r\n\r\n“But that the entire affair took place subjectively in the man’s own\r\nconsciousness, I have no doubt,” he went on, in reply to my questions;\r\n“for my secretary who has been to the town to investigate, discovered\r\nhis signature in the visitors’ book, and proved by it that he had\r\narrived on September 8th, and left suddenly without paying his bill.\r\nHe left two days later, and they still were in possession of his dirty\r\nbrown bag and some tourist clothes. I paid a few francs in settlement\r\nof his debt, and have sent his luggage on to him. The daughter was\r\nabsent from home, but the proprietress, a large woman very much as he\r\ndescribed her, told my secretary that he had seemed a very strange,\r\nabsent-minded kind of gentleman, and after his disappearance she had\r\nfeared for a long time that he had met with a violent end in the\r\nneighbouring forest where he used to roam about alone.\r\n\r\n“I should like to have obtained a personal interview with the daughter\r\nso as to ascertain how much was subjective and how much actually took\r\nplace with her as Vezin told it. For her dread of fire and the sight of\r\nburning must, of course, have been the intuitive memory of her former\r\npainful death at the stake, and have thus explained why he fancied more\r\nthan once that he saw her through smoke and flame.”\r\n\r\n“And that mark on his skin, for instance?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“Merely the marks produced by hysterical brooding,” he replied, “like\r\nthe stigmata of the _religieuses_, and the bruises which appear on\r\nthe bodies of hypnotised subjects who have been told to expect them.\r\nThis is very common and easily explained. Only it seems curious that\r\nthese marks should have remained so long in Vezin’s case. Usually they\r\ndisappear quickly.”\r\n\r\n“Obviously he is still thinking about it all, brooding, and living it\r\nall over again,” I ventured.\r\n\r\n“Probably. And this makes me fear that the end of his trouble is not\r\nyet. We shall hear of him again. It is a case, alas! I can do little to\r\nalleviate.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence spoke gravely and with sadness in his voice.\r\n\r\n“And what do you make of the Frenchman in the train?” I asked\r\nfurther--“the man who warned him against the place, _à cause du sommeil\r\net à cause des chats_? Surely a very singular incident?”\r\n\r\n“A _very_ singular incident indeed,” he made answer slowly, “and one I\r\ncan only explain on the basis of a highly improbable coincidence----”\r\n\r\n“Namely?”\r\n\r\n“That the man was one who had himself stayed in the town and undergone\r\nthere a similar experience. I should like to find this man and ask him.\r\nBut the crystal is useless here, for I have no slightest clue to go\r\nupon, and I can only conclude that some singular psychic affinity, some\r\nforce still active in his being out of the same past life, drew him\r\nthus to the personality of Vezin, and enabled him to fear what might\r\nhappen to him, and thus to warn him as he did.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he presently continued, half talking to himself, “I suspect in\r\nthis case that Vezin was swept into the vortex of forces arising out of\r\nthe intense activities of a past life, and that he lived over again a\r\nscene in which he had often played a leading part centuries before. For\r\nstrong actions set up forces that are so slow to exhaust themselves,\r\nthey may be said in a sense never to die. In this case they were not\r\nvital enough to render the illusion complete, so that the little man\r\nfound himself caught in a very distressing confusion of the present\r\nand the past; yet he was sufficiently sensitive to recognise that it\r\nwas true, and to fight against the degradation of returning, even in\r\nmemory, to a former and lower state of development.\r\n\r\n“Ah yes!” he continued, crossing the floor to gaze at the darkening\r\nsky, and seemingly quite oblivious of my presence, “subliminal\r\nup-rushes of memory like this can be exceedingly painful, and sometimes\r\nexceedingly dangerous. I only trust that this gentle soul may soon\r\nescape from this obsession of a passionate and tempestuous past. But I\r\ndoubt it, I doubt it.”\r\n\r\nHis voice was hushed with sadness as he spoke, and when he turned back\r\ninto the room again there was an expression of profound yearning upon\r\nhis face, the yearning of a soul whose desire to help is sometimes\r\ngreater than his power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE III\r\n\r\nTHE NEMESIS OF FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBy some means which I never could fathom, John Silence always contrived\r\nto keep the compartment to himself, and as the train had a clear run\r\nof two hours before the first stop, there was ample time to go over\r\nthe preliminary facts of the case. He had telephoned to me that very\r\nmorning, and even through the disguise of the miles of wire the thrill\r\nof incalculable adventure had sounded in his voice.\r\n\r\n“As if it were an ordinary country visit,” he called, in reply to my\r\nquestion; “and don’t forget to bring your gun.”\r\n\r\n“With blank cartridges, I suppose?” for I knew his rigid principles\r\nwith regard to the taking of life, and guessed that the guns were\r\nmerely for some obvious purpose of disguise.\r\n\r\nThen he thanked me for coming, mentioned the train, snapped down the\r\nreceiver, and left me vibrating with the excitement of anticipation\r\nto do my packing. For the honour of accompanying Dr. John Silence on\r\none of his big cases was what many would have considered an empty\r\nhonour--and risky. Certainly the adventure held all manner of\r\npossibilities, and I arrived at Waterloo with the feelings of a man who\r\nis about to embark on some dangerous and peculiar mission in which the\r\ndangers he expects to run will not be the ordinary dangers to life and\r\nlimb, but of some secret character difficult to name and still more\r\ndifficult to cope with.\r\n\r\n“The Manor House has a high sound,” he told me, as we sat with our\r\nfeet up and talked, “but I believe it is little more than an overgrown\r\nfarmhouse in the desolate heather country beyond D----, and its owner,\r\nColonel Wragge, a retired soldier with a taste for books, lives there\r\npractically alone, I understand, with an elderly invalid sister. So you\r\nneed not look forward to a lively visit, unless the case provides some\r\nexcitement of its own.”\r\n\r\n“Which is likely?”\r\n\r\nBy way of reply he handed me a letter marked “Private.” It was dated a\r\nweek ago, and signed “Yours faithfully, Horace Wragge.”\r\n\r\n“He heard of me, you see, through Captain Anderson,” the doctor\r\nexplained modestly, as though his fame were not almost world-wide; “you\r\nremember that Indian obsession case----”\r\n\r\nI read the letter. Why it should have been marked private was difficult\r\nto understand. It was very brief, direct, and to the point. It referred\r\nby way of introduction to Captain Anderson, and then stated quite\r\nsimply that the writer needed help of a peculiar kind and asked for a\r\npersonal interview--a morning interview, since it was impossible for\r\nhim to be absent from the house at night. The letter was dignified\r\neven to the point of abruptness, and it is difficult to explain how\r\nit managed to convey to me the impression of a strong man, shaken\r\nand perplexed. Perhaps the restraint of the wording, and the mystery\r\nof the affair had something to do with it; and the reference to the\r\nAnderson case, the horror of which lay still vivid in my memory, may\r\nhave touched the sense of something rather ominous and alarming. But,\r\nwhatever the cause, there was no doubt that an impression of serious\r\nperil rose somehow out of that white paper with the few lines of firm\r\nwriting, and the spirit of a deep uneasiness ran between the words and\r\nreached the mind without any visible form of expression.\r\n\r\n“And when you saw him----?” I asked, returning the letter as the train\r\nrushed clattering noisily through Clapham Junction.\r\n\r\n“I have not seen him,” was the reply. “The man’s mind was charged to\r\nthe brim when he wrote that; full of vivid mental pictures. Notice\r\nthe restraint of it. For the main character of his case psychometry\r\ncould be depended upon, and the scrap of paper his hand has touched\r\nis sufficient to give to another mind--a sensitive and sympathetic\r\nmind--clear mental pictures of what is going on. I think I have a very\r\nsound general idea of his problem.”\r\n\r\n“So there may be excitement after all?”\r\n\r\nJohn Silence waited a moment before he replied.\r\n\r\n“Something very serious is amiss there,” he said gravely, at length.\r\n“Some one--not himself, I gather,--has been meddling with a rather\r\ndangerous kind of gunpowder. So--yes, there may be excitement, as you\r\nput it.”\r\n\r\n“And my duties?” I asked, with a decidedly growing interest. “Remember,\r\nI am your ‘assistant.’”\r\n\r\n“Behave like an intelligent confidential secretary. Observe everything,\r\nwithout seeming to. Say nothing--nothing that means anything. Be\r\npresent at all interviews. I may ask a good deal of you, for if my\r\nimpressions are correct this is----”\r\n\r\nHe broke off suddenly.\r\n\r\n“But I won’t tell you my impressions yet,” he resumed after a moment’s\r\nthought. “Just watch and listen as the case proceeds. Form your\r\nown impressions and cultivate your intuitions. We come as ordinary\r\nvisitors, of course,” he added, a twinkle showing for an instant in his\r\neye; “hence, the guns.”\r\n\r\nThough disappointed not to hear more, I recognised the wisdom of\r\nhis words and knew how valueless my impressions would be once the\r\npowerful suggestion of having heard his own lay behind them. I likewise\r\nreflected that intuition joined to a sense of humour was of more use to\r\na man than double the quantity of mere “brains,” as such.\r\n\r\nBefore putting the letter away, however, he handed it back, telling me\r\nto place it against my forehead for a few moments and then describe any\r\npictures that came spontaneously into my mind.\r\n\r\n“Don’t deliberately look for anything. Just imagine you see the inside\r\nof the eyelid, and wait for pictures that rise against its dark screen.”\r\n\r\nI followed his instructions, making my mind as nearly a blank as\r\npossible. But no visions came. I saw nothing but the lines of light\r\nthat pass to and fro like the changes of a kaleidoscope across the\r\nblackness. A momentary sensation of warmth came and went curiously.\r\n\r\n“You see--what?” he asked presently.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” I was obliged to admit disappointedly; “nothing but the\r\nusual flashes of light one always sees. Only, perhaps, they are more\r\nvivid than usual.”\r\n\r\nHe said nothing by way of comment or reply.\r\n\r\n“And they group themselves now and then,” I continued, with painful\r\ncandour, for I longed to see the pictures he had spoken of, “group\r\nthemselves into globes and round balls of fire, and the lines that\r\nflash about sometimes look like triangles and crosses--almost like\r\ngeometrical figures. Nothing more.”\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes again, and gave him back the letter.\r\n\r\n“It makes my head hot,” I said, feeling somehow unworthy for not seeing\r\nanything of interest. But the look in his eyes arrested my attention at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“That sensation of heat is important,” he said significantly.\r\n\r\n“It was certainly real, and rather uncomfortable,” I replied, hoping\r\nhe would expand and explain. “There was a distinct feeling of\r\nwarmth--internal warmth somewhere--oppressive in a sense.”\r\n\r\n“That is interesting,” he remarked, putting the letter back in his\r\npocket, and settling himself in the corner with newspapers and books.\r\nHe vouchsafed nothing more, and I knew the uselessness of trying to\r\nmake him talk. Following his example I settled likewise with magazines\r\ninto my corner. But when I closed my eyes again to look for the\r\nflashing lights and the sensation of heat, I found nothing but the\r\nusual phantasmagoria of the day’s events--faces, scenes, memories,--and\r\nin due course I fell asleep and then saw nothing at all of any kind.\r\n\r\nWhen we left the train, after six hours’ travelling, at a little\r\nwayside station standing without trees in a world of sand and heather,\r\nthe late October shadows had already dropped their sombre veil upon the\r\nlandscape, and the sun dipped almost out of sight behind the moorland\r\nhills. In a high dogcart, behind a fast horse, we were soon rattling\r\nacross the undulating stretches of an open and bleak country, the keen\r\nair stinging our cheeks and the scents of pine and bracken strong\r\nabout us. Bare hills were faintly visible against the horizon, and the\r\ncoachman pointed to a bank of distant shadows on our left where he told\r\nus the sea lay. Occasional stone farmhouses, standing back from the\r\nroad among straggling fir trees, and large black barns that seemed to\r\nshift past us with a movement of their own in the gloom, were the only\r\nsigns of humanity and civilisation that we saw, until at the end of a\r\nbracing five miles the lights of the lodge gates flared before us and\r\nwe plunged into a thick grove of pine trees that concealed the Manor\r\nHouse up to the moment of actual arrival.\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge himself met us in the hall. He was the typical army\r\nofficer who had seen service, real service, and found himself in the\r\nprocess. He was tall and well built, broad in the shoulders, but lean\r\nas a greyhound, with grave eyes, rather stern, and a moustache turning\r\ngrey. I judged him to be about sixty years of age, but his movements\r\nshowed a suppleness of strength and agility that contradicted the\r\nyears. The face was full of character and resolution, the face of a man\r\nto be depended upon, and the straight grey eyes, it seemed to me, wore\r\na veil of perplexed anxiety that he made no attempt to disguise. The\r\nwhole appearance of the man at once clothed the adventure with gravity\r\nand importance. A matter that gave such a man cause for serious alarm,\r\nI felt, must be something real and of genuine moment.\r\n\r\nHis speech and manner, as he welcomed us, were like his letter, simple\r\nand sincere. He had a nature as direct and undeviating as a bullet.\r\nThus, he showed plainly his surprise that Dr. Silence had not come\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n“My confidential secretary, Mr. Hubbard,” the doctor said, introducing\r\nme, and the steady gaze and powerful shake of the hand I then\r\nreceived were well calculated, I remember thinking, to drive home the\r\nimpression that here was a man who was not to be trifled with, and\r\nwhose perplexity must spring from some very real and tangible cause.\r\nAnd, quite obviously, he was relieved that we had come. His welcome was\r\nunmistakably genuine.\r\n\r\nHe led us at once into a room, half library, half smoking-room,\r\nthat opened out of the low-ceilinged hall. The Manor House gave the\r\nimpression of a rambling and glorified farmhouse, solid, ancient,\r\ncomfortable, and wholly unpretentious. And so it was. Only the heat of\r\nthe place struck me as unnatural. This room with the blazing fire may\r\nhave seemed uncomfortably warm after the long drive through the night\r\nair; yet it seemed to me that the hall itself, and the whole atmosphere\r\nof the house, breathed a warmth that hardly belonged to well-filled\r\ngrates or the pipes of hot air and water. It was not the heat of the\r\ngreenhouse; it was an oppressive heat that somehow got into the head\r\nand mind. It stirred a curious sense of uneasiness in me, and I caught\r\nmyself thinking of the sensation of warmth that had emanated from the\r\nletter in the train.\r\n\r\nI heard him thanking Dr. Silence for having come; there was no\r\npreamble, and the exchange of civilities was of the briefest\r\ndescription. Evidently here was a man who, like my companion, loved\r\naction rather than talk. His manner was straightforward and direct. I\r\nsaw him in a flash: puzzled, worried, harassed into a state of alarm by\r\nsomething he could not comprehend; forced to deal with things he would\r\nhave preferred to despise, yet facing it all with dogged seriousness\r\nand making no attempt to conceal that he felt secretly ashamed of his\r\nincompetence.\r\n\r\n“So I cannot offer you much entertainment beyond that of my own\r\ncompany, and the queer business that has been going on here, and is\r\nstill going on,” he said, with a slight inclination of the head towards\r\nme by way of including me in his confidence.\r\n\r\n“I think, Colonel Wragge,” replied John Silence impressively, “that we\r\nshall none of us find the time hang heavy. I gather we shall have our\r\nhands full.”\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at one another for the space of some seconds, and\r\nthere was an indefinable quality in their silence which for the first\r\ntime made me admit a swift question into my mind; and I wondered a\r\nlittle at my rashness in coming with so little reflection into a big\r\ncase of this incalculable doctor. But no answer suggested itself, and\r\nto withdraw was, of course, inconceivable. The gates had closed behind\r\nme now, and the spirit of the adventure was already besieging my mind\r\nwith its advance guard of a thousand little hopes and fears.\r\n\r\nExplaining that he would wait till after dinner to discuss anything\r\nserious, as no reference was ever made before his sister, he led the\r\nway upstairs and showed us personally to our rooms; and it was just as\r\nI was finishing dressing that a knock came at my door and Dr. Silence\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nHe was always what is called a serious man, so that even in moments of\r\ncomedy you felt he never lost sight of the profound gravity of life,\r\nbut as he came across the room to me I caught the expression of his\r\nface and understood in a flash that he was now in his most grave and\r\nearnest mood. He looked almost troubled. I stopped fumbling with my\r\nblack tie and stared.\r\n\r\n“It _is_ serious,” he said, speaking in a low voice, “more so even than\r\nI imagined. Colonel Wragge’s control over his thoughts concealed a\r\ngreat deal in my psychometrising of the letter. I looked in to warn you\r\nto keep yourself well in hand--generally speaking.”\r\n\r\n“Haunted house?” I asked, conscious of a distinct shiver down my back.\r\n\r\nBut he smiled gravely at the question.\r\n\r\n“Haunted House of Life more likely,” he replied, and a look came into\r\nhis eyes which I had only seen there when a human soul was in the toils\r\nand he was thick in the fight of rescue. He was stirred in the deeps.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Wragge--or the sister?” I asked hurriedly, for the gong was\r\nsounding.\r\n\r\n“Neither directly,” he said from the door. “Something far older,\r\nsomething very, very remote indeed. This thing has to do with the ages,\r\nunless I am mistaken greatly, the ages on which the mists of memory\r\nhave long lain undisturbed.”\r\n\r\nHe came across the floor very quickly with a finger on his lips,\r\nlooking at me with a peculiar searchingness of gaze.\r\n\r\n“Are you aware yet of anything--odd here?” he asked in a whisper.\r\n“Anything you cannot quite define, for instance. Tell me, Hubbard, for\r\nI want to know all your impressions. They may help me.”\r\n\r\nI shook my head, avoiding his gaze, for there was something in the eyes\r\nthat scared me a little. But he was so in earnest that I set my mind\r\nkeenly searching.\r\n\r\n“Nothing yet,” I replied truthfully, wishing I could confess to a real\r\nemotion; “nothing but the strange heat of the place.”\r\n\r\nHe gave a little jump forward in my direction.\r\n\r\n“The heat again, that’s it!” he exclaimed, as though glad of my\r\ncorroboration. “And how would you describe it, perhaps?” he asked\r\nquickly, with a hand on the door knob.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t seem like ordinary physical heat,” I said, casting about in\r\nmy thoughts for a definition.\r\n\r\n“More a mental heat,” he interrupted, “a glowing of thought and desire,\r\na sort of feverish warmth of the spirit. Isn’t that it?”\r\n\r\nI admitted that he had exactly described my sensations.\r\n\r\n“Good!” he said, as he opened the door, and with an indescribable\r\ngesture that combined a warning to be ready with a sign of praise for\r\nmy correct intuition, he was gone.\r\n\r\nI hurried after him, and found the two men waiting for me in front of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n“I ought to warn you,” our host was saying as I came in, “that my\r\nsister, whom you will meet at dinner, is not aware of the real object\r\nof your visit. She is under the impression that we are interested in\r\nthe same line of study--folklore--and that your researches have led to\r\nmy seeking acquaintance. She comes to dinner in her chair, you know. It\r\nwill be a great pleasure to her to meet you both. We have few visitors.”\r\n\r\nSo that on entering the dining-room we were prepared to find Miss\r\nWragge already at her place, seated in a sort of bath-chair. She was\r\na vivacious and charming old lady, with smiling expression and bright\r\neyes, and she chatted all through dinner with unfailing spontaneity.\r\nShe had that face, unlined and fresh, that some people carry through\r\nlife from the cradle to the grave; her smooth plump cheeks were\r\nall pink and white, and her hair, still dark, was divided into two\r\nglossy and sleek halves on either side of a careful parting. She wore\r\ngold-rimmed glasses, and at her throat was a large scarab of green\r\njasper that made a very handsome brooch.\r\n\r\nHer brother and Dr. Silence talked little, so that most of the\r\nconversation was carried on between herself and me, and she told me a\r\ngreat deal about the history of the old house, most of which I fear I\r\nlistened to with but half an ear.\r\n\r\n“And when Cromwell stayed here,” she babbled on, “he occupied the very\r\nrooms upstairs that used to be mine. But my brother thinks it safer for\r\nme to sleep on the ground floor now in case of fire.”\r\n\r\nAnd this sentence has stayed in my memory only because of the sudden\r\nway her brother interrupted her and instantly led the conversation\r\non to another topic. The passing reference to fire seemed to have\r\ndisturbed him, and thenceforward he directed the talk himself.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to believe that this lively and animated old lady,\r\nsitting beside me and taking so eager an interest in the affairs of\r\nlife, was practically, we understood, without the use of her lower\r\nlimbs, and that her whole existence for years had been passed between\r\nthe sofa, the bed, and the bath-chair in which she chatted so naturally\r\nat the dinner-table. She made no allusion to her affliction until the\r\ndessert was reached, and then, touching a bell, she made us a witty\r\nlittle speech about leaving us “like time, on noiseless feet,” and was\r\nwheeled out of the room by the butler and carried off to her apartments\r\nat the other end of the house.\r\n\r\nAnd the rest of us were not long in following suit, for Dr. Silence and\r\nmyself were quite as eager to learn the nature of our errand as our\r\nhost was to impart it to us. He led us down a long flagged passage to a\r\nroom at the very end of the house, a room provided with double doors,\r\nand windows, I saw, heavily shuttered. Books lined the walls on every\r\nside, and a large desk in the bow window was piled up with volumes,\r\nsome open, some shut, some showing scraps of paper stuck between the\r\nleaves, and all smothered in a general cataract of untidy foolscap and\r\nloose half sheets.\r\n\r\n“My study and workroom,” explained Colonel Wragge, with a delightful\r\ntouch of innocent pride, as though he were a very serious scholar.\r\nHe placed arm-chairs for us round the fire. “Here,” he added\r\nsignificantly, “we shall be safe from interruption and can talk\r\nsecurely.”\r\n\r\nDuring dinner the manner of the doctor had been all that was natural\r\nand spontaneous, though it was impossible for me, knowing him as I\r\ndid, not to be aware that he was subconsciously very keenly alert and\r\nalready receiving upon the ultra-sensitive surface of his mind various\r\nand vivid impressions; and there was now something in the gravity\r\nof his face, as well as in the significant tone of Colonel Wragge’s\r\nspeech, and something, too, in the fact that we three were shut away in\r\nthis private chamber about to listen to things probably strange, and\r\ncertainly mysterious--something in all this that touched my imagination\r\nsharply and sent an undeniable thrill along my nerves. Taking the chair\r\nindicated by my host, I lit my cigar and waited for the opening of the\r\nattack, fully conscious that we were now too far gone in the adventure\r\nto admit of withdrawal, and wondering a little anxiously where it was\r\ngoing to lead.\r\n\r\nWhat I expected precisely, it is hard to say. Nothing definite,\r\nperhaps. Only the sudden change was dramatic. A few hours before the\r\nprosaic atmosphere of Piccadilly was about me, and now I was sitting in\r\na secret chamber of this remote old building waiting to hear an account\r\nof things that held possibly the genuine heart of terror. I thought of\r\nthe dreary moors and hills outside, and the dark pine copses soughing\r\nin the wind of night; I remembered my companion’s singular words up in\r\nmy bedroom before dinner; and then I turned and noted carefully the\r\nstern countenance of the Colonel as he faced us and lit his big black\r\ncigar before speaking.\r\n\r\nThe threshold of an adventure, I reflected as I waited for the first\r\nwords, is always the most thrilling moment--until the climax comes.\r\n\r\nBut Colonel Wragge hesitated--mentally--a long time before he began.\r\nHe talked briefly of our journey, the weather, the country, and other\r\ncomparatively trivial topics, while he sought about in his mind for an\r\nappropriate entry into the subject that was uppermost in the thoughts\r\nof all of us. The fact was he found it a difficult matter to speak of\r\nat all, and it was Dr. Silence who finally showed him the way over the\r\nhedge.\r\n\r\n“Mr Hubbard will take a few notes when you are ready--you won’t\r\nobject,” he suggested; “I can give my undivided attention in this way.”\r\n\r\n“By all means,” turning to reach some of the loose sheets on the\r\nwriting table, and glancing at me. He still hesitated a little, I\r\nthought. “The fact is,” he said apologetically, “I wondered if it\r\nwas quite fair to trouble you so soon. The daylight might suit you\r\nbetter to hear what I have to tell. Your sleep, I mean, might be less\r\ndisturbed, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“I appreciate your thoughtfulness,” John Silence replied with his\r\ngentle smile, taking command as it were from that moment, “but really\r\nwe are both quite immune. There is nothing, I think, that could prevent\r\neither of us sleeping, except--an outbreak of fire, or some such very\r\nphysical disturbance.”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge raised his eyes and looked fixedly at him. This\r\nreference to an outbreak of fire I felt sure was made with a purpose.\r\nIt certainly had the desired effect of removing from our host’s manner\r\nthe last signs of hesitancy.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me,” he said. “Of course, I know nothing of your methods in\r\nmatters of this kind--so, perhaps, you would like me to begin at once\r\nand give you an outline of the situation?”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence bowed his agreement. “I can then take my precautions\r\naccordingly,” he added calmly.\r\n\r\nThe soldier looked up for a moment as though he did not quite gather\r\nthe meaning of these words; but he made no further comment and\r\nturned at once to tackle a subject on which he evidently talked with\r\ndiffidence and unwillingness.\r\n\r\n“It’s all so utterly out of my line of things,” he began, puffing out\r\nclouds of cigar smoke between his words, “and there’s so little to tell\r\nwith any real evidence behind it, that it’s almost impossible to make\r\na consecutive story for you. It’s the total cumulative effect that is\r\nso--so disquieting.” He chose his words with care, as though determined\r\nnot to travel one hair’s breadth beyond the truth.\r\n\r\n“I came into this place twenty years ago when my elder brother died,”\r\nhe continued, “but could not afford to live here then. My sister, whom\r\nyou met at dinner, kept house for him till the end, and during all\r\nthese years, while I was seeing service abroad, she had an eye to the\r\nplace--for we never got a satisfactory tenant--and saw that it was not\r\nallowed to go to ruin. I myself took possession, however, only a year\r\nago.\r\n\r\n“My brother,” he went on, after a perceptible pause, “spent much of\r\nhis time away, too. He was a great traveller, and filled the house\r\nwith stuff he brought home from all over the world. The laundry--a\r\nsmall detached building beyond the servants’ quarters--he turned into a\r\nregular little museum. The curios and things I have cleared away--they\r\ncollected dust and were always getting broken--but the laundry-house\r\nyou shall see tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge spoke with such deliberation and with so many pauses\r\nthat this beginning took him a long time. But at this point he came to\r\na full stop altogether. Evidently there was something he wished to say\r\nthat cost him considerable effort. At length he looked up steadily into\r\nmy companion’s face.\r\n\r\n“May I ask you--that is, if you won’t think it strange,” he said, and a\r\nsort of hush came over his voice and manner, “whether you have noticed\r\nanything at all unusual--anything queer, since you came into the house?”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence answered without a moment’s hesitation.\r\n\r\n“I have,” he said. “There is a curious sensation of heat in the place.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed the other, with a slight start. “You _have_ noticed it.\r\nThis unaccountable heat----”\r\n\r\n“But its cause, I gather, is not in the house itself--but outside,” I\r\nwas astonished to hear the doctor add.\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge rose from his chair and turned to unhook a framed map\r\nthat hung upon the wall. I got the impression that the movement was\r\nmade with the deliberate purpose of concealing his face.\r\n\r\n“Your diagnosis, I believe, is amazingly accurate,” he said after a\r\nmoment, turning round with the map in his hands. “Though, of course, I\r\ncan have no idea how you should guess----”\r\n\r\nJohn Silence shrugged his shoulders expressively. “Merely my\r\nimpression,” he said. “If you pay attention to impressions, and do not\r\nallow them to be confused by deductions of the intellect, you will\r\noften find them surprisingly, uncannily, accurate.”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge resumed his seat and laid the map upon his knees. His\r\nface was very thoughtful as he plunged abruptly again into his story.\r\n\r\n“On coming into possession,” he said, looking us alternately in\r\nthe face, “I found a crop of stories of the most extraordinary and\r\nimpossible kind I had ever heard--stories which at first I treated with\r\namused indifference, but later was forced to regard seriously, if only\r\nto keep my servants. These stories I thought I traced to the fact of my\r\nbrother’s death--and, in a way, I think so still.”\r\n\r\nHe leant forward and handed the map to Dr. Silence.\r\n\r\n“It’s an old plan of the estate,” he explained, “but accurate enough\r\nfor our purpose, and I wish you would note the position of the\r\nplantations marked upon it, especially those near the house. That\r\none,” indicating the spot with his finger, “is called the Twelve Acre\r\nPlantation. It was just there, on the side nearest the house, that my\r\nbrother and the head keeper met their deaths.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke as a man forced to recognise facts that he deplored, and would\r\nhave preferred to leave untouched--things he personally would rather\r\nhave treated with ridicule if possible. It made his words peculiarly\r\ndignified and impressive, and I listened with an increasing uneasiness\r\nas to the sort of help the doctor would look to me for later. It seemed\r\nas though I were a spectator of some drama of mystery in which any\r\nmoment I might be summoned to play a part.\r\n\r\n“It was twenty years ago,” continued the Colonel, “but there was much\r\ntalk about it at the time, unfortunately, and you may, perhaps, have\r\nheard of the affair. Stride, the keeper, was a passionate, hot-tempered\r\nman, but I regret to say, so was my brother, and quarrels between them\r\nseem to have been frequent.”\r\n\r\n“I do not recall the affair,” said the doctor. “May I ask what was the\r\ncause of death?” Something in his voice made me prick up my ears for\r\nthe reply.\r\n\r\n“The keeper, it was said, from suffocation. And at the inquest the\r\ndoctors averred that both men had been dead the same length of time\r\nwhen found.”\r\n\r\n“And your brother?” asked John Silence, noticing the omission, and\r\nlistening intently.\r\n\r\n“Equally mysterious,” said our host, speaking in a low voice with\r\neffort. “But there was one distressing feature I think I ought to\r\nmention. For those who saw the face--I did not see it myself--and\r\nthough Stride carried a gun its chambers were undischarged----” He\r\nstammered and hesitated with confusion. Again that sense of terror\r\nmoved between his words. He stuck.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the chief listener sympathetically.\r\n\r\n“My brother’s face, they said, looked as though it had been scorched.\r\nIt had been swept, as it were, by something that burned--blasted. It\r\nwas, I am told, quite dreadful. The bodies were found lying side by\r\nside, faces downwards, both pointing away from the wood, as though they\r\nhad been in the act of running, and not more than a dozen yards from\r\nits edge.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence made no comment. He appeared to be studying the map\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n“I did not see the face myself,” repeated the other, his manner somehow\r\nexpressing the sense of awe he contrived to keep out of his voice,\r\n“but my sister unfortunately did, and her present state I believe to\r\nbe entirely due to the shock it gave to her nerves. She never can be\r\nbrought to refer to it, naturally, and I am even inclined to think that\r\nthe memory has mercifully been permitted to vanish from her mind. But\r\nshe spoke of it at the time as a face swept by flame--blasted.”\r\n\r\nJohn Silence looked up from his contemplation of the map, but with the\r\nair of one who wished to listen, not to speak, and presently Colonel\r\nWragge went on with his account. He stood on the mat, his broad\r\nshoulders hiding most of the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n“They all centred about this particular plantation, these stories. That\r\nwas to be expected, for the people here are as superstitious as Irish\r\npeasantry, and though I made one or two examples among them to stop the\r\nfoolish talk, it had no effect, and new versions came to my ears every\r\nweek. You may imagine how little good dismissals did, when I tell you\r\nthat the servants dismissed themselves. It was not the house servants,\r\nbut the men who worked on the estate outside. The keepers gave notice\r\none after another, none of them with any reason I could accept; the\r\nforesters refused to enter the wood, and the beaters to beat in it.\r\nWord flew all over the countryside that Twelve Acre Plantation was a\r\nplace to be avoided, day or night.\r\n\r\n“There came a point,” the Colonel went on, now well in his swing, “when\r\nI felt compelled to make investigations on my own account. I could\r\nnot kill the thing by ignoring it; so I collected and analysed the\r\nstories at first hand. For this Twelve Acre Wood, you will see by the\r\nmap, comes rather near home. Its lower end, if you will look, almost\r\ntouches the end of the back lawn, as I will show you tomorrow, and its\r\ndense growth of pines forms the chief protection the house enjoys from\r\nthe east winds that blow up from the sea. And in olden days, before my\r\nbrother interfered with it and frightened all the game away, it was one\r\nof the best pheasant coverts on the whole estate.”\r\n\r\n“And what form, if I may ask, did this interference take?” asked Dr.\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n“In detail, I cannot tell you, for I do not know--except that I\r\nunderstand it was the subject of his frequent differences with the head\r\nkeeper; but during the last two years of his life, when he gave up\r\ntravelling and settled down here, he took a special interest in this\r\nwood, and for some unaccountable reason began to build a low stone wall\r\nround it. This wall was never finished, but you shall see the ruins\r\ntomorrow in the daylight.”\r\n\r\n“And the result of your investigations--these stories, I mean?” the\r\ndoctor broke in, anxious to keep him to the main issues.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’m coming to that,” he said slowly, “but the wood first, for\r\nthis wood out of which they grew like mushrooms has nothing in any way\r\npeculiar about it. It is very thickly grown, and rises to a clearer\r\npart in the centre, a sort of mound where there is a circle of large\r\nboulders--old Druid stones, I’m told. At another place there’s a small\r\npond. There’s nothing distinctive about it that I could mention--just\r\nan ordinary pine-wood, a very ordinary pine-wood--only the trees are a\r\nbit twisted in the trunks, some of ’em, and very dense. Nothing more.\r\n\r\n“And the stories? Well, none of them had anything to do with my poor\r\nbrother, or the keeper, as you might have expected; and they were all\r\nodd--such odd things, I mean, to invent or imagine. I never could make\r\nout how these people got such notions into their heads.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment to relight his cigar.\r\n\r\n“There’s no regular path through it,” he resumed, puffing vigorously,\r\n“but the fields round it are constantly used, and one of the gardeners\r\nwhose cottage lies over that way declared he often saw moving lights in\r\nit at night, and luminous shapes like globes of fire over the tops of\r\nthe trees, skimming and floating, and making a soft hissing sound--most\r\nof ’em said that, in fact--and another man saw shapes flitting in and\r\nout among the trees, things that were neither men nor animals, and all\r\nfaintly luminous. No one ever pretended to see human forms--always\r\nqueer, huge things they could not properly describe. Sometimes the\r\nwhole wood was lit up, and one fellow--he’s still here and you shall\r\nsee him--has a most circumstantial yarn about having seen great stars\r\nlying on the ground round the edge of the wood at regular intervals----”\r\n\r\n“What kind of stars?” put in John Silence sharply, in a sudden way that\r\nmade me start.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know quite; ordinary stars, I think he said, only very\r\nlarge, and apparently blazing as though the ground was alight. He was\r\ntoo terrified to go close and examine, and he has never seen them\r\nsince.”\r\n\r\nHe stooped and stirred the fire into a welcome blaze--welcome for its\r\nblaze of light rather than for its heat. In the room there was already\r\na strange pervading sensation of warmth that was oppressive in its\r\neffect and far from comforting.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he went on, straightening up again on the mat, “this was\r\nall commonplace enough--this seeing lights and figures at night. Most\r\nof these fellows drink, and imagination and terror between them may\r\naccount for almost anything. But others saw things in broad daylight.\r\nOne of the woodmen, a sober, respectable man, took the shortcut home to\r\nhis midday meal, and swore he was followed the whole length of the wood\r\nby something that never showed itself, but dodged from tree to tree,\r\nalways keeping out of sight, yet solid enough to make the branches sway\r\nand the twigs snap on the ground. And it made a noise, he declared--but\r\nreally”--the speaker stopped and gave a short laugh--“it’s too\r\nabsurd----”\r\n\r\n“_Please!_” insisted the doctor; “for it is these small details that\r\ngive me the best clues always.”\r\n\r\n“----it made a crackling noise, he said, like a bonfire. Those were his\r\nvery words: like the crackling of a bonfire,” finished the soldier,\r\nwith a repetition of his short laugh.\r\n\r\n“Most interesting,” Dr. Silence observed gravely. “Please omit nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes” he went on, “and it was soon after that the fires began--the\r\nfires in the wood. They started mysteriously burning in the patches of\r\ncoarse white grass that cover the more open parts of the plantation. No\r\none ever actually saw them start, but many, myself among the number,\r\nhave seen them burning and smouldering. They are always small and\r\ncircular in shape, and for all the world like a picnic fire. The head\r\nkeeper has a dozen explanations, from sparks flying out of the house\r\nchimneys to the sunlight focusing through a dewdrop, but none of them,\r\nI must admit, convince me as being in the least likely or probable.\r\nThey are most singular, I consider, most singular, these mysterious\r\nfires, and I am glad to say that they come only at rather long\r\nintervals and never seem to spread.\r\n\r\n“But the keeper had other queer stories as well, and about things that\r\nare verifiable. He declared that no life ever willingly entered the\r\nplantation; more, that no life existed in it at all. No birds nested in\r\nthe trees, or flew into their shade. He set countless traps, but never\r\ncaught so much as a rabbit or a weasel. Animals avoided it, and more\r\nthan once he had picked up dead creatures round the edges that bore no\r\nobvious signs of how they had met their death.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, he told me one extraordinary tale about his retriever\r\nchasing some invisible creature across the field one day when he was\r\nout with his gun. The dog suddenly pointed at something in the field at\r\nhis feet, and then gave chase, yelping like a mad thing. It followed\r\nits imaginary quarry to the borders of the wood, and then went in--a\r\nthing he had never known it to do before. The moment it crossed the\r\nedge--it is darkish in there even in daylight--it began fighting\r\nin the most frenzied and terrific fashion. It made him afraid to\r\ninterfere, he said. And at last, when the dog came out, hanging its\r\ntail down and panting, he found something like white hair stuck to its\r\njaws, and brought it to show me. I tell you these details because----”\r\n\r\n“They are important, believe me,” the doctor stopped him. “And you have\r\nit still, this hair?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“It disappeared in the oddest way,” the Colonel explained. “It was\r\ncurious looking stuff, something like asbestos, and I sent it to be\r\nanalysed by the local chemist. But either the man got wind of its\r\norigin, or else he didn’t like the look of it for some reason, because\r\nhe returned it to me and said it was neither animal, vegetable, nor\r\nmineral, so far as he could make out, and he didn’t wish to have\r\nanything to do with it. I put it away in paper, but a week later, on\r\nopening the package--it was gone! Oh, the stories are simply endless. I\r\ncould tell you hundreds all on the same lines.”\r\n\r\n“And personal experiences of your own, Colonel Wragge?” asked John\r\nSilence earnestly, his manner showing the greatest possible interest\r\nand sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe soldier gave an almost imperceptible start. He looked distinctly\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, I think,” he said slowly, “nothing--er--I should like to rely\r\non. I mean nothing I have the right to speak of, perhaps--yet.”\r\n\r\nHis mouth closed with a snap. Dr. Silence, after waiting a little to\r\nsee if he would add to his reply, did not seek to press him on the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he resumed presently, and as though he would speak\r\ncontemptuously, yet dared not, “this sort of thing has gone on at\r\nintervals ever since. It spreads like wildfire, of course, mysterious\r\nchatter of this kind, and people began trespassing all over the estate,\r\ncoming to see the wood, and making themselves a general nuisance.\r\nNotices of man-traps and spring-guns only seemed to increase their\r\npersistence; and--think of it,” he snorted, “some local Research\r\nSociety actually wrote and asked permission for one of their members\r\nto spend a night in the wood! Bolder fools, who didn’t write for\r\nleave, came and took away bits of bark from the trees and gave them\r\nto clairvoyants, who invented in their turn a further batch of tales.\r\nThere was simply no end to it all.”\r\n\r\n“Most distressing and annoying, I can well believe,” interposed the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n“Then suddenly the phenomena ceased as mysteriously as they had begun,\r\nand the interest flagged. The tales stopped. People got interested in\r\nsomething else. It all seemed to die out. This was last July. I can\r\ntell you exactly, for I’ve kept a diary more or less of what happened.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“But now, quite recently, within the past three weeks, it has all\r\nrevived again with a rush--with a kind of furious attack, so to speak.\r\nIt has really become unbearable. You may imagine what it means, and the\r\ngeneral state of affairs, when I say that the possibility of leaving\r\nhas occurred to me.”\r\n\r\n“Incendiarism?” suggested Dr. Silence, half under his breath, but not\r\nso low that Colonel Wragge did not hear him.\r\n\r\n“By Jove, sir, you take the very words out of my mouth!” exclaimed\r\nthe astonished man, glancing from the doctor to me and from me to the\r\ndoctor, and rattling the money in his pocket as though some explanation\r\nof my friend’s divining powers were to be found that way.\r\n\r\n“It’s only that you are thinking very vividly,” the doctor said\r\nquietly, “and your thoughts form pictures in my mind before you utter\r\nthem. It’s merely a little elementary thought-reading.”\r\n\r\nHis intention, I saw, was not to perplex the good man, but to impress\r\nhim with his powers so as to ensure obedience later.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! I had no idea----” He did not finish the sentence, and\r\ndived again abruptly into his narrative.\r\n\r\n“I did not see anything myself, I must admit, but the stories of\r\nindependent eye-witnesses were to the effect that lines of light, like\r\nstreams of thin fire, moved through the wood and sometimes were seen\r\nto shoot out precisely as flames might shoot out--in the direction of\r\nthis house. There,” he explained, in a louder voice that made me jump,\r\npointing with a thick finger to the map, “where the westerly fringe of\r\nthe plantation comes up to the end of the lower lawn at the back of\r\nthe house--where it links on to those dark patches, which are laurel\r\nshrubberies, running right up to the back premises--that’s where these\r\nlights were seen. They passed from the wood to the shrubberies, and\r\nin this way reached the house itself. Like silent rockets, one man\r\ndescribed them, rapid as lightning and exceedingly bright.”\r\n\r\n“And this evidence you spoke of?”\r\n\r\n“They actually reached the sides of the house. They’ve left a mark of\r\nscorching on the walls--the walls of the laundry building at the other\r\nend. You shall see ’em tomorrow.” He pointed to the map to indicate the\r\nspot, and then straightened himself and glared about the room as though\r\nhe had said something no one could believe and expected contradiction.\r\n\r\n“Scorched--just as the faces were,” the doctor murmured, looking\r\nsignificantly at me.\r\n\r\n“Scorched--yes,” repeated the Colonel, failing to catch the rest of the\r\nsentence in his excitement.\r\n\r\nThere was a prolonged silence in the room, in which I heard the\r\ngurgling of the oil in the lamp and the click of the coals and the\r\nheavy breathing of our host. The most unwelcome sensations were\r\ncreeping about my spine, and I wondered whether my companion would\r\nscorn me utterly if I asked to sleep on the sofa in his room. It was\r\neleven o’clock, I saw by the clock on the mantelpiece. We had crossed\r\nthe dividing line and were now well in the movement of the adventure.\r\nThe fight between my interest and my dread became acute. But, even if\r\nturning back had been possible, I think the interest would have easily\r\ngained the day.\r\n\r\n“I have enemies, of course,” I heard the Colonel’s rough voice break\r\ninto the pause presently, “and have discharged a number of servants----”\r\n\r\n“It’s not that,” put in John Silence briefly.\r\n\r\n“You think not? In a sense I am glad, and yet--there are some things\r\nthat can be met and dealt with----”\r\n\r\nHe left the sentence unfinished, and looked down at the floor with\r\nan expression of grim severity that betrayed a momentary glimpse of\r\ncharacter. This fighting man loathed and abhorred the thought of an\r\nenemy he could not see and come to grips with. Presently he moved over\r\nand sat down in the chair between us. Something like a sigh escaped\r\nhim. Dr. Silence said nothing.\r\n\r\n“My sister, of course, is kept in ignorance, as far as possible, of all\r\nthis,” he said disconnectedly, and as if talking to himself. “But even\r\nif she knew, she would find matter-of-fact explanations. I only wish I\r\ncould. I’m sure they exist.”\r\n\r\nThere came then an interval in the conversation that was very\r\nsignificant. It did not seem a real pause, or the silence real silence,\r\nfor both men continued to think so rapidly and strongly that one almost\r\nimagined their thoughts clothed themselves in words in the air of the\r\nroom. I was more than a little keyed up with the strange excitement\r\nof all I had heard, but what stimulated my nerves more than anything\r\nelse was the obvious fact that the doctor was clearly upon the trail of\r\ndiscovery. In his mind at that moment, I believe, he had already solved\r\nthe nature of this perplexing psychical problem. His face was like a\r\nmask, and he employed the absolute minimum of gesture and words. All\r\nhis energies were directed inwards, and by those incalculable methods\r\nand processes he had mastered with such infinite patience and study, I\r\nfelt sure he was already in touch with the forces behind these singular\r\nphenomena and laying his deep plans for bringing them into the open,\r\nand then effectively dealing with them.\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge meanwhile grew more and more fidgety. From time to time\r\nhe turned towards my companion, as though about to speak, yet always\r\nchanging his mind at the last moment. Once he went over and opened\r\nthe door suddenly, apparently to see if any one were listening at\r\nthe keyhole, for he disappeared a moment between the two doors, and I\r\nthen heard him open the outer one. He stood there for some seconds and\r\nmade a noise as though he were sniffing the air like a dog. Then he\r\nclosed both doors cautiously and came back to the fireplace. A strange\r\nexcitement seemed growing upon him. Evidently he was trying to make up\r\nhis mind to say something that he found it difficult to say. And John\r\nSilence, as I rightly judged, was waiting patiently for him to choose\r\nhis own opportunity and his own way of saying it. At last he turned and\r\nfaced us, squaring his great shoulders, and stiffening perceptibly.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence looked up sympathetically.\r\n\r\n“Your own experiences help me most,” he observed quietly.\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” the Colonel said, speaking very low, “this past week\r\nthere have been outbreaks of fire in the house itself. Three separate\r\noutbreaks--and all--in my sister’s room.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” the doctor said, as if this was just what he had expected to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n“Utterly unaccountable--all of them,” added the other, and then sat\r\ndown. I began to understand something of the reason of his excitement.\r\nHe was realising at last that the “natural” explanation he had held to\r\nall along was becoming impossible, and he hated it. It made him angry.\r\n\r\n“Fortunately,” he went on, “she was out each time and does not know.\r\nBut I have made her sleep now in a room on the ground floor.”\r\n\r\n“A wise precaution,” the doctor said simply. He asked one or two\r\nquestions. The fires had started in the curtains--once by the window\r\nand once by the bed. The third time smoke had been discovered by the\r\nmaid coming from the cupboard, and it was found that Miss Wragge’s\r\nclothes hanging on the hooks were smouldering. The doctor listened\r\nattentively, but made no comment.\r\n\r\n“And now can you tell me,” he said presently, “what your own feeling\r\nabout it is--your general impression?”\r\n\r\n“It sounds foolish to say so,” replied the soldier, after a moment’s\r\nhesitation, “but I feel exactly as I have often felt on active service\r\nin my Indian campaigns: just as if the house and all in it were in a\r\nstate of siege; as though a concealed enemy were encamped about us--in\r\nambush somewhere.” He uttered a soft nervous laugh. “As if the next\r\nsign of smoke would precipitate a panic--a dreadful panic.”\r\n\r\nThe picture came before me of the night shadowing the house, and the\r\ntwisted pine trees he had described crowding about it, concealing some\r\npowerful enemy; and, glancing at the resolute face and figure of the\r\nold soldier, forced at length to his confession, I understood something\r\nof all he had been through before he sought the assistance of John\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n“And tomorrow, unless I am mistaken, is full moon,” said the doctor\r\nsuddenly, watching the other’s face for the effect of his apparently\r\ncareless words.\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge gave an uncontrollable start, and his face for the first\r\ntime showed unmistakable pallor.\r\n\r\n“What in the world----?” he began, his lip quivering.\r\n\r\n“Only that I am beginning to see light in this extraordinary affair,”\r\nreturned the other calmly, “and, if my theory is correct, each month\r\nwhen the moon is at the full should witness an increase in the activity\r\nof the phenomena.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see the connection,” Colonel Wragge answered almost savagely,\r\n“but I am bound to say my diary bears you out.” He wore the most\r\npuzzled expression I have ever seen upon an honest face, but he\r\nabhorred this additional corroboration of an explanation that perplexed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I confess,” he repeated; “I cannot see the connection.”\r\n\r\n“Why should you?” said the doctor, with his first laugh that evening.\r\nHe got up and hung the map upon the wall again. “But I do--because\r\nthese things are my special study--and let me add that I have yet\r\nto come across a problem that is not natural, and has not a natural\r\nexplanation. It’s merely a question of how much one knows--and admits.”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge eyed him with a new and curious respect in his face. But\r\nhis feelings were soothed. Moreover, the doctor’s laugh and change of\r\nmanner came as a relief to all, and broke the spell of grave suspense\r\nthat had held us so long. We all rose and stretched our limbs, and took\r\nlittle walks about the room.\r\n\r\n“I am glad, Dr. Silence, if you will allow me to say so, that you are\r\nhere,” he said simply, “very glad indeed. And now I fear I have kept\r\nyou both up very late,” with a glance to include me, “for you must be\r\ntired, and ready for your beds. I have told you all there is to tell,”\r\nhe added, “and tomorrow you must feel perfectly free to take any steps\r\nyou think necessary.”\r\n\r\nThe end was abrupt, yet natural, for there was nothing more to say, and\r\nneither of these men talked for mere talking’s sake.\r\n\r\nOut in the cold and chilly hall he lit our candles and took us\r\nupstairs. The house was at rest and still, every one asleep. We moved\r\nsoftly. Through the windows on the stairs we saw the moonlight falling\r\nacross the lawn, throwing deep shadows. The nearer pine trees were just\r\nvisible in the distance, a wall of impenetrable blackness.\r\n\r\nOur host came for a moment to our rooms to see that we had everything.\r\nHe pointed to a coil of strong rope lying beside the window, fastened\r\nto the wall by means of an iron ring. Evidently it had been recently\r\nput in.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think we shall need it,” Dr. Silence said, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“I trust not,” replied our host gravely. “I sleep quite close to you\r\nacross the landing,” he whispered, pointing to his door, “and if\r\nyou--if you want anything in the night you will know where to find me.”\r\n\r\nHe wished us pleasant dreams and disappeared down the passage into his\r\nroom, shading the candle with his big muscular hand from the draughts.\r\n\r\nJohn Silence stopped me a moment before I went.\r\n\r\n“You know what it is?” I asked, with an excitement that even overcame\r\nmy weariness.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “I’m almost sure. And you?”\r\n\r\n“Not the smallest notion.”\r\n\r\nHe looked disappointed, but not half as disappointed as I felt.\r\n\r\n“Egypt,” he whispered, “Egypt!”\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNothing happened to disturb me in the night--nothing, that is, except a\r\nnightmare in which Colonel Wragge chased me amid thin streaks of fire,\r\nand his sister always prevented my escape by suddenly rising up out of\r\nthe ground in her chair--dead. The deep baying of dogs woke me once,\r\njust before the dawn, it must have been, for I saw the window frame\r\nagainst the sky; there was a flash of lightning, too, I thought, as I\r\nturned over in bed. And it was warm, for October oppressively warm.\r\n\r\nIt was after eleven o’clock when our host suggested going out with\r\nthe guns, these, we understood, being a somewhat thin disguise for\r\nour true purpose. Personally, I was glad to be in the open air, for\r\nthe atmosphere of the house was heavy with presentiment. The sense\r\nof impending disaster hung over all. Fear stalked the passages, and\r\nlurked in the corners of every room. It was a house haunted, but really\r\nhaunted; not by some vague shadow of the dead, but by a definite\r\nthough incalculable influence that was actively alive, and dangerous.\r\nAt the least smell of smoke the entire household quivered. An odour\r\nof burning, I was convinced, would paralyse all the inmates. For the\r\nservants, though professedly ignorant by the master’s unspoken orders,\r\nyet shared the common dread; and the hideous uncertainty, joined with\r\nthis display of so spiteful and calculated a spirit of malignity,\r\nprovided a kind of black doom that draped not only the walls, but also\r\nthe minds of the people living within them.\r\n\r\nOnly the bright and cheerful vision of old Miss Wragge being pushed\r\nabout the house in her noiseless chair, chatting and nodding briskly\r\nto every one she met, prevented us from giving way entirely to the\r\ndepression which governed the majority. The sight of her was like a\r\ngleam of sunshine through the depths of some ill-omened wood, and just\r\nas we went out I saw her being wheeled along by her attendant into the\r\nsunshine of the back lawn, and caught her cheery smile as she turned\r\nher head and wished us good sport.\r\n\r\nThe morning was October at its best. Sunshine glistened on the\r\ndew-drenched grass and on leaves turned golden-red. The dainty\r\nmessengers of coming hoar-frost were already in the air, asearch for\r\npermanent winter quarters. From the wide moors that everywhere swept up\r\nagainst the sky, like a purple sea splashed by the occasional grey of\r\nrocky clefts, there stole down the cool and perfumed wind of the west.\r\nAnd the keen taste of the sea ran through all like a master-flavour,\r\nborne over the spaces perhaps by the seagulls that cried and circled\r\nhigh in the air.\r\n\r\nBut our host took little interest in this sparkling beauty, and had\r\nno thought of showing off the scenery of his property. His mind was\r\notherwise intent, and, for that matter, so were our own.\r\n\r\n“Those bleak moors and hills stretch unbroken for hours,” he said, with\r\na sweep of the hand; “and over there, some four miles,” pointing in\r\nanother direction, “lies S---- Bay, a long, swampy inlet of the sea,\r\nhaunted by myriads of seabirds. On the other side of the house are the\r\nplantations and pine-woods. I thought we would get the dogs and go\r\nfirst to the Twelve Acre Wood I told you about last night. It’s quite\r\nnear.”\r\n\r\nWe found the dogs in the stable, and I recalled the deep baying of the\r\nnight when a fine bloodhound and two great Danes leaped out to greet\r\nus. Singular companions for guns, I thought to myself, as we struck out\r\nacross the fields and the great creatures bounded and ran beside us,\r\nnose to ground.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was scanty. John Silence’s grave face did not\r\nencourage talk. He wore the expression I knew well--that look of\r\nearnest solicitude which meant that his whole being was deeply absorbed\r\nand preoccupied. Frightened, I had never seen him, but anxious\r\noften--it always moved me to witness it--and he was anxious now.\r\n\r\n“On the way back you shall see the laundry building,” Colonel Wragge\r\nobserved shortly, for he, too, found little to say. “We shall attract\r\nless attention then.”\r\n\r\nYet not all the crisp beauty of the morning seemed able to dispel the\r\nfeelings of uneasy dread that gathered increasingly about our minds as\r\nwe went.\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes a clump of pine trees concealed the house from\r\nview, and we found ourselves on the outskirts of a densely-grown\r\nplantation of conifers. Colonel Wragge stopped abruptly, and, producing\r\na map from his pocket, explained once more very briefly its position\r\nwith regard to the house. He showed how it ran up almost to the walls\r\nof the laundry building--though at the moment beyond our actual\r\nview--and pointed to the windows of his sister’s bedroom where the\r\nfires had been. The room, now empty, looked straight on to the wood.\r\nThen, glancing nervously about him, and calling the dogs to heel,\r\nhe proposed that we should enter the plantation and make as thorough\r\nexamination of it as we thought worth while. The dogs, he added, might\r\nperhaps be persuaded to accompany us a little way--and he pointed to\r\nwhere they cowered at his feet--but he doubted it. “Neither voice\r\nnor whip will get them very far, I’m afraid,” he said. “I know by\r\nexperience.”\r\n\r\n“If you have no objection,” replied Dr. Silence, with decision, and\r\nspeaking almost for the first time, “we will make our examination\r\nalone--Mr. Hubbard and myself. It will be best so.”\r\n\r\nHis tone was absolutely final, and the Colonel acquiesced so politely\r\nthat even a less intuitive man than myself must have seen that he was\r\ngenuinely relieved.\r\n\r\n“You doubtless have good reasons,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Merely that I wish to obtain my impressions uncoloured. This delicate\r\nclue I am working on might be so easily blurred by the thought-currents\r\nof another mind with strongly preconceived ideas.”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly. I understand,” rejoined the soldier, though with an\r\nexpression of countenance that plainly contradicted his words. “Then I\r\nwill wait here with the dogs; and we’ll have a look at the laundry on\r\nour way home.”\r\n\r\nI turned once to look back as we clambered over the low stone wall\r\nbuilt by the late owner, and saw his straight, soldierly figure\r\nstanding in the sunlit field watching us with a curiously intent look\r\non his face. There was something to me incongruous, yet distinctly\r\npathetic, in the man’s efforts to meet all far-fetched explanations\r\nof the mystery with contempt, and at the same time in his stolid,\r\nunswerving investigation of it all. He nodded at me and made a gesture\r\nof farewell with his hand. That picture of him, standing in the\r\nsunshine with his big dogs, steadily watching us, remains with me to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence led the way in among the twisted trunks, planted closely\r\ntogether in serried ranks, and I followed sharp at his heels. The\r\nmoment we were out of sight he turned and put down his gun against the\r\nroots of a big tree, and I did likewise.\r\n\r\n“We shall hardly want these cumbersome weapons of murder,” he observed,\r\nwith a passing smile.\r\n\r\n“You are sure of your clue, then?” I asked at once, bursting with\r\ncuriosity, yet fearing to betray it lest he should think me unworthy.\r\nHis own methods were so absolutely simple and untheatrical.\r\n\r\n“I am sure of my clue,” he answered gravely. “And I think we have come\r\njust in time. You shall know in due course. For the present--be content\r\nto follow and observe. And think steadily. The support of your mind\r\nwill help me.”\r\n\r\nHis voice had that quiet mastery in it which leads men to face death\r\nwith a sort of happiness and pride. I would have followed him anywhere\r\nat that moment. At the same time his words conveyed a sense of dread\r\nseriousness. I caught the thrill of his confidence; but also, in this\r\nbroad light of day, I felt the measure of alarm that lay behind.\r\n\r\n“You still have no strong impressions?” he asked. “Nothing happened in\r\nthe night, for instance? No vivid dreamings?”\r\n\r\nHe looked closely for my answer, I was aware.\r\n\r\n“I slept almost an unbroken sleep. I was tremendously tired, you know,\r\nand, but for the oppressive heat----”\r\n\r\n“Good! You still notice the heat, then,” he said to himself, rather\r\nthan expecting an answer. “And the lightning?” he added, “that\r\nlightning out of a clear sky--that flashing--did you notice _that_?”\r\n\r\nI answered truly that I thought I had seen a flash during a moment of\r\nwakefulness, and he then drew my attention to certain facts before\r\nmoving on.\r\n\r\n“You remember the sensation of warmth when you put the letter to your\r\nforehead in the train; the heat generally in the house last evening,\r\nand, as you now mention, in the night. You heard, too, the Colonel’s\r\nstories about the appearances of fire in this wood and in the house\r\nitself, and the way his brother and the gamekeeper came to their deaths\r\ntwenty years ago.”\r\n\r\nI nodded, wondering what in the world it all meant.\r\n\r\n“And you get no clue from these facts?” he asked, a trifle surprised.\r\n\r\nI searched every corner of my mind and imagination for some inkling of\r\nhis meaning, but was obliged to admit that I understood nothing so far.\r\n\r\n“Never mind; you will later. And now,” he added, “we will go over the\r\nwood and see what we can find.”\r\n\r\nHis words explained to me something of his method. We were to keep our\r\nminds alert and report to each other the least fancy that crossed the\r\npicture-gallery of our thoughts. Then, just as we started, he turned\r\nagain to me with a final warning.\r\n\r\n“And, for your safety,” he said earnestly, “imagine _now_--and for that\r\nmatter, imagine always until we leave this place--imagine with the\r\nutmost keenness, that you are surrounded by a shell that protects you.\r\nPicture yourself inside a protective envelope, and build it up with the\r\nmost intense imagination you can evoke. Pour the whole force of your\r\nthought and will into it. Believe vividly all through this adventure\r\nthat such a shell, constructed of your thought, will and imagination,\r\nsurrounds you completely, and that nothing can pierce it to attack.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke with dramatic conviction, gazing hard at me as though to\r\nenforce his meaning, and then moved forward and began to pick his way\r\nover the rough, tussocky ground into the wood. And meanwhile, knowing\r\nthe efficacy of his prescription, I adopted it to the best of my\r\nability.\r\n\r\nThe trees at once closed about us like the night. Their branches met\r\noverhead in a continuous tangle, their stems crept closer and closer,\r\nthe brambly undergrowth thickened and multiplied. We tore our trousers,\r\nscratched our hands, and our eyes filled with fine dust that made it\r\nmost difficult to avoid the clinging, prickly network of branches and\r\ncreepers. Coarse white grass that caught our feet like string grew here\r\nand there in patches. It crowned the lumps of peaty growth that stuck\r\nup like human heads, fantastically dressed, thrusting up at us out of\r\nthe ground with crests of dead hair. We stumbled and floundered among\r\nthem. It was hard going, and I could well conceive it impossible to\r\nfind a way at all in the night-time. We jumped, when possible, from\r\ntussock to tussock, and it seemed as though we were springing among\r\nheads on a battlefield, and that this dead white grass concealed eyes\r\nthat turned to stare as we passed.\r\n\r\nHere and there the sunlight shot in with vivid spots of white light,\r\ndazzling the sight, but only making the surrounding gloom deeper by\r\ncontrast And on two occasions we passed dark circular places in the\r\ngrass where fires had eaten their mark and left a ring of ashes. Dr.\r\nSilence pointed to them, but without comment and without pausing, and\r\nthe sight of them woke in me a singular realisation of the dread that\r\nlay so far only just out of sight in this adventure.\r\n\r\nIt was exhausting work, and heavy going. We kept close together. The\r\nwarmth, too, was extraordinary. Yet it did not seem the warmth of the\r\nbody due to violent exertion, but rather an inner heat of the mind that\r\nlaid glowing hands of fire upon the heart and set the brain in a kind\r\nof steady blaze. When my companion found himself too far in advance,\r\nhe waited for me to come up. The place had evidently been untouched by\r\nhand of man, keeper, forester or sportsman, for many a year; and my\r\nthoughts, as we advanced painfully, were not unlike the state of the\r\nwood itself--dark, confused, full of a haunting wonder and the shadow\r\nof fear.\r\n\r\nBy this time all signs of the open field behind us were hid. No\r\nsingle gleam penetrated. We might have been groping in the heart of\r\nsome primeval forest. Then, suddenly, the brambles and tussocks and\r\nstring-like grass came to an end; the trees opened out; and the ground\r\nbegan to slope upwards towards a large central mound. We had reached\r\nthe middle of the plantation, and before us stood the broken Druid\r\nstones our host had mentioned. We walked easily up the little hill,\r\nbetween the sparser stems, and, resting upon one of the ivy-covered\r\nboulders, looked round upon a comparatively open space, as large,\r\nperhaps, as a small London Square.\r\n\r\nThinking of the ceremonies and sacrifices this rough circle of\r\nprehistoric monoliths might have witnessed, I looked up into my\r\ncompanion’s face with an unspoken question. But he read my thought and\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n“Our mystery has nothing to do with these dead symbols,” he said,\r\n“but with something perhaps even more ancient, and of another country\r\naltogether.”\r\n\r\n“Egypt?” I said half under my breath, hopelessly puzzled, but recalling\r\nhis words in my bedroom.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. Mentally I still floundered, but he seemed intensely\r\npreoccupied and it was no time for asking questions; so while his words\r\ncircled unintelligibly in my mind I looked round at the scene before\r\nme, glad of the opportunity to recover breath and some measure of\r\ncomposure. But hardly had I time to notice the twisted and contorted\r\nshapes of many of the pine trees close at hand when Dr. Silence leaned\r\nover and touched me on the shoulder. He pointed down the slope. And the\r\nlook I saw in his eyes keyed up every nerve in my body to its utmost\r\npitch.\r\n\r\nA thin, almost imperceptible column of blue smoke was rising among the\r\ntrees some twenty yards away at the foot of the mound. It curled up and\r\nup, and disappeared from sight among the tangled branches overhead. It\r\nwas scarcely thicker than the smoke from a small brand of burning wood.\r\n\r\n“Protect yourself! Imagine your shell strongly,” whispered the doctor\r\nsharply, “and follow me closely.”\r\n\r\nHe rose at once and moved swiftly down the slope towards the smoke,\r\nand I followed, afraid to remain alone. I heard the soft crunching of\r\nour steps on the pine needles. Over his shoulder I watched the thin\r\nblue spiral, without once taking my eyes off it. I hardly know how\r\nto describe the peculiar sense of vague horror inspired in me by the\r\nsight of that streak of smoke pencilling its way upwards among the\r\ndark trees. And the sensation of increasing heat as we approached was\r\nphenomenal. It was like walking towards a glowing yet invisible fire.\r\n\r\nAs we drew nearer his pace slackened. Then he stopped and pointed, and\r\nI saw a small circle of burnt grass upon the ground. The tussocks were\r\nblackened and smouldering, and from the centre rose this line of smoke,\r\npale, blue, steady. Then I noticed a movement of the atmosphere beside\r\nus, as if the warm air were rising and the cooler air rushing in to\r\ntake its place: a little centre of wind in the stillness. Overhead the\r\nboughs stirred and trembled where the smoke disappeared. Otherwise, not\r\na tree sighed, not a sound made itself heard. The wood was still as a\r\ngraveyard. A horrible idea came to me that the course of nature was\r\nabout to change without warning, _had_ changed a little already, that\r\nthe sky would drop, or the surface of the earth crash inwards like a\r\nbroken bubble. Something, certainly, reached up to the citadel of my\r\nreason, causing its throne to shake.\r\n\r\nJohn Silence moved forward again. I could not see his face, but his\r\nattitude was plainly one of resolution, of muscles and mind ready for\r\nvigorous action. We were within ten feet of the blackened circle when\r\nthe smoke of a sudden ceased to rise, and vanished. The tail of the\r\ncolumn disappeared in the air above, and at the same instant it seemed\r\nto me that the sensation of heat passed from my face, and the motion\r\nof the wind was gone. The calm spirit of the fresh October day resumed\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nSide by side we advanced and examined the place. The grass was\r\nsmouldering, the ground still hot. The circle of burned earth was a\r\nfoot to a foot and a half in diameter. It looked like an ordinary\r\npicnic fire-place. I bent down cautiously to look, but in a second\r\nI sprang back with an involuntary cry of alarm, for, as the doctor\r\nstamped on the ashes to prevent them spreading, a sound of hissing rose\r\nfrom the spot as though he had kicked a living creature. This hissing\r\nwas faintly audible in the air. It moved past us, away towards the\r\nthicker portion of the wood in the direction of our field, and in a\r\nsecond Dr. Silence had left the fire and started in pursuit.\r\n\r\nAnd then began the most extraordinary hunt of invisibility I can ever\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\nHe went fast even at the beginning, and, of course, it was perfectly\r\nobvious that he was following something. To judge by the poise of his\r\nhead he kept his eyes steadily at a certain level--just above the\r\nheight of a man--and the consequence was he stumbled a good deal over\r\nthe roughness of the ground. The hissing sound had stopped. There was\r\nno sound of any kind, and what he saw to follow was utterly beyond me.\r\nI only know, that in mortal dread of being left behind, and with a\r\nbiting curiosity to see whatever there was to be seen, I followed as\r\nquickly as I could, and even then barely succeeded in keeping up with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd, as we went, the whole mad jumble of the Colonel’s stories ran\r\nthrough my brain, touching a sense of frightened laughter that was only\r\nheld in check by the sight of this earnest, hurrying figure before me.\r\nFor John Silence at work inspired me with a kind of awe. He looked\r\nso diminutive among these giant twisted trees, while yet I knew that\r\nhis purpose and his knowledge were so great, and even in hurry he was\r\ndignified. The fancy that we were playing some queer, exaggerated game\r\ntogether met the fact that we were two men dancing upon the brink of\r\nsome possible tragedy, and the mingling of the two emotions in my mind\r\nwas both grotesque and terrifying.\r\n\r\nHe never turned in his mad chase, but pushed rapidly on, while I panted\r\nafter him like a figure in some unreasoning nightmare. And, as I ran,\r\nit came upon me that he had been aware all the time, in his quiet,\r\ninternal way, of many things that he had kept for his own secret\r\nconsideration; he had been watching, waiting, planning from the very\r\nmoment we entered the shade of the wood. By some inner, concentrated\r\nprocess of mind, dynamic if not actually magical, he had been in direct\r\ncontact with the source of the whole adventure, the very essence of the\r\nreal mystery. And now the forces were moving to a climax. Something\r\nwas about to happen, something important, something possibly dreadful.\r\nEvery nerve, every sense, every significant gesture of the plunging\r\nfigure before me proclaimed the fact just as surely as the skies, the\r\nwinds, and the face of the earth tell the birds the time to migrate and\r\nwarn the animals that danger lurks and they must move.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments we reached the foot of the mound and entered the\r\ntangled undergrowth that lay between us and the sunlight of the field.\r\nHere the difficulties of fast travelling increased a hundredfold. There\r\nwere brambles to dodge, low boughs to dive under, and countless tree\r\ntrunks closing up to make a direct path impossible. Yet Dr. Silence\r\nnever seemed to falter or hesitate. He went, diving, jumping, dodging,\r\nducking, but ever in the same main direction, following a clean trail.\r\nTwice I tripped and fell, and both times, when I picked myself up\r\nagain, I saw him ahead of me, still forcing a way like a dog after\r\nits quarry. And sometimes, like a dog, he stopped and pointed--human\r\npointing it was, psychic pointing,--and each time he stopped to point I\r\nheard that faint high hissing in the air beyond us. The instinct of an\r\ninfallible dowser possessed him, and he made no mistakes.\r\n\r\nAt length, abruptly, I caught up with him, and found that we stood\r\nat the edge of the shallow pond Colonel Wragge had mentioned in his\r\naccount the night before. It was long and narrow, filled with dark\r\nbrown water, in which the trees were dimly reflected. Not a ripple\r\nstirred its surface.\r\n\r\n“Watch!” he cried out, as I came up. “It’s going to cross. It’s bound\r\nto betray itself. The water is its natural enemy, and we shall see the\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\nAnd, even as he spoke, a thin line like the track of a water-spider,\r\nshot swiftly across the shiny surface; there was a ghost of steam in\r\nthe air above; and immediately I became aware of an odour of burning.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence turned and shot a glance at me that made me think of\r\nlightning. I began to shake all over.\r\n\r\n“Quick!” he cried with excitement, “to the trail again! We must run\r\nround. It’s going to the house!”\r\n\r\nThe alarm in his voice quite terrified me. Without a false step I\r\ndashed round the slippery banks and dived again at his heels into the\r\nsea of bushes and tree trunks. We were now in the thick of the very\r\ndense belt that ran round the outer edge of the plantation, and the\r\nfield was near; yet so dark was the tangle that it was some time before\r\nthe first shafts of white sunlight became visible. The doctor now ran\r\nin zigzags. He was following something that dodged and doubled quite\r\nwonderfully, yet had begun, I fancied, to move more slowly than before.\r\n\r\n“Quick!” he cried. “In the light we shall lose it!”\r\n\r\nI still saw nothing, heard nothing, caught no suggestion of a trail;\r\nyet this man, guided by some interior divining that seemed infallible,\r\nmade no false turns, though how we failed to crash headlong into the\r\ntrees has remained a mystery to me ever since. And then, with a sudden\r\nrush, we found ourselves on the skirts of the wood with the open field\r\nlying in bright sunshine before our eyes.\r\n\r\n“Too late!” I heard him cry, a note of anguish in his voice. “It’s\r\nout--and, by God, it’s making for the house!”\r\n\r\nI saw the Colonel standing in the field with his dogs where we had left\r\nhim. He was bending double, peering into the wood where he heard us\r\nrunning, and he straightened up like a bent whip released. John Silence\r\ndashed passed, calling him to follow.\r\n\r\n“We shall lose the trail in the light,” I heard him cry as he ran. “But\r\nquick! We may yet get there in time!”\r\n\r\nThat wild rush across the open field, with the dogs at our heels,\r\nleaping and barking, and the elderly Colonel behind us running as\r\nthough for his life, shall I ever forget it? Though I had only vague\r\nideas of the meaning of it all, I put my best foot forward, and, being\r\nthe youngest of the three, I reached the house an easy first. I drew\r\nup, panting, and turned to wait for the others. But, as I turned,\r\nsomething moving a little distance away caught my eye, and in that\r\nmoment I swear I experienced the most overwhelming and singular shock\r\nof surprise and terror I have ever known, or can conceive as possible.\r\n\r\nFor the front door was open, and the waist of the house being narrow, I\r\ncould see through the hall into the dining-room beyond, and so out on\r\nto the back lawn, and there I saw no less a sight than the figure of\r\nMiss Wragge--running. Even at that distance it was plain that she had\r\nseen me, and was coming fast towards me, running with the frantic gait\r\nof a terror-stricken woman. She had recovered the use of her legs.\r\n\r\nHer face was a livid grey, as of death itself, but the general\r\nexpression was one of laughter, for her mouth was gaping, and her eyes,\r\nalways bright shone with the light of a wild merriment that seemed the\r\nmerriment of a child, yet was singularly ghastly. And that very second,\r\nas she fled past me into her brother’s arms behind, I smelt again most\r\nunmistakably the odour of burning, and to this day the smell of smoke\r\nand fire can come very near to turning me sick with the memory of what\r\nI had seen.\r\n\r\nFast on her heels, too, came the terrified attendant, more mistress of\r\nherself, and able to speak--which the old lady could not do--but with a\r\nface almost, if not quite, as fearful.\r\n\r\n“We were down by the bushes in the sun,”--she gasped and screamed in\r\nreply to Colonel Wragge’s distracted questionings,--“I was wheeling the\r\nchair as usual when she shrieked and leaped--I don’t know exactly--I\r\nwas too frightened to see--Oh, my God! she jumped clean out of the\r\nchair--_and ran!_ There was a blast of hot air from the wood, and she\r\nhid her face and jumped. She didn’t make a sound--she didn’t cry out,\r\nor make a sound. She just ran.”\r\n\r\nBut the nightmare horror of it all reached the breaking point a few\r\nminutes later, and while I was still standing in the hall temporarily\r\nbereft of speech and movement; for while the doctor, the Colonel and\r\nthe attendant were half-way up the staircase, helping the fainting\r\nwoman to the privacy of her room, and all in a confused group of dark\r\nfigures, there sounded a voice behind me, and I turned to see the\r\nbutler, his face dripping with perspiration, his eyes starting out of\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n“The laundry’s on fire!” he cried; “the laundry building’s a-caught!”\r\n\r\nI remember his odd expression “a-caught,” and wanting to laugh, but\r\nfinding my face rigid and inflexible.\r\n\r\n“The devil’s about again, s’help me Gawd!” he cried, in a voice thin\r\nwith terror, running about in circles.\r\n\r\nAnd then the group on the stairs scattered as at the sound of a shot,\r\nand the Colonel and Dr. Silence came down three steps at a time,\r\nleaving the afflicted Miss Wragge to the care of her single attendant.\r\n\r\nWe were out across the front lawn in a moment and round the corner\r\nof the house, the Colonel leading, Silence and I at his heels, and\r\nthe portly butler puffing some distance in the rear, getting more and\r\nmore mixed in his addresses to God and the devil; and the moment we\r\npassed the stables and came into view of the laundry building, we saw a\r\nwicked-looking volume of smoke pouring out of the narrow windows, and\r\nthe frightened women-servants and grooms running hither and thither,\r\ncalling aloud as they ran.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the master restored order instantly, and this retired\r\nsoldier, poor thinker perhaps, but capable man of action, had the\r\nmatter in hand from the start. He issued orders like a martinet, and,\r\nalmost before I could realise it, there were streaming buckets on the\r\nscene and a line of men and women formed between the building and the\r\nstable pump.\r\n\r\n“Inside,” I heard John Silence cry, and the Colonel followed him\r\nthrough the door, while I was just quick enough at their heels to hear\r\nhim add, “the smoke’s the worst part of it. There’s no fire yet, I\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\nAnd, true enough, there was no fire. The interior was thick with smoke,\r\nbut it speedily cleared and not a single bucket was used upon the floor\r\nor walls. The air was stifling, the heat fearful.\r\n\r\n“There’s precious little to burn in here; it’s all stone,” the Colonel\r\nexclaimed, coughing. But the doctor was pointing to the wooden covers\r\nof the great cauldron in which the clothes were washed, and we saw that\r\nthese were smouldering and charred. And when we sprinkled half a bucket\r\nof water on them the surrounding bricks hissed and fizzed and sent up\r\nclouds of steam. Through the open door and windows this passed out with\r\nthe rest of the smoke, and we three stood there on the brick floor\r\nstaring at the spot and wondering, each in our own fashion, how in the\r\nname of natural law the place could have caught fire or smoked at all.\r\nAnd each was silent--myself from sheer incapacity and befuddlement, the\r\nColonel from the quiet pluck that faces all things yet speaks little,\r\nand John Silence from the intense mental grappling with this latest\r\nmanifestation of a profound problem that called for concentration of\r\nthought rather than for any words.\r\n\r\nThere was really nothing to say. The facts were indisputable.\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge was the first to utter.\r\n\r\n“My sister,” he said briefly, and moved off. In the yard I heard him\r\nsending the frightened servants about their business in an excellently\r\nmatter-of-fact voice, scolding some one roundly for making such a big\r\nfire and letting the flues get over-heated, and paying no heed to the\r\nstammering reply that no fire had been lit there for several days. Then\r\nhe dispatched a groom on horseback for the local doctor.\r\n\r\nThen Dr. Silence turned and looked at me. The absolute control he\r\npossessed, not only over the outward expression of emotion by gesture,\r\nchange of colour, light in the eyes, and so forth, but also, as I well\r\nknew, over its very birth in his heart, the mask-like face of the dead\r\nhe could assume at will, made it extremely difficult to know at any\r\ngiven moment what was at work in his inner consciousness. But now, when\r\nhe turned and looked at me, there was no sphinx-expression there, but\r\nrather the keen, triumphant face of a man who had solved a dangerous\r\nand complicated problem, and saw his way to a clean victory.\r\n\r\n“_Now_ do you guess?” he asked quietly, as though it were the simplest\r\nmatter in the world, and ignorance were impossible.\r\n\r\nI could only stare stupidly and remain silent. He glanced down at the\r\ncharred cauldron-lids, and traced a figure in the air with his finger.\r\nBut I was too excited, or too mortified, or still too dazed, perhaps,\r\nto see what it was he outlined, or what it was he meant to convey. I\r\ncould only go on staring and shaking my puzzled head.\r\n\r\n“A fire-elemental,” he cried, “a fire-elemental of the most powerful\r\nand malignant kind----”\r\n\r\n“A what?” thundered the voice of Colonel Wragge behind us, having\r\nreturned suddenly and overheard.\r\n\r\n“It’s a fire-elemental,” repeated Dr. Silence more calmly, but\r\nwith a note of triumph in his voice he could not keep out, “and a\r\nfire-elemental enraged.”\r\n\r\nThe light began to dawn in my mind at last. But the Colonel--who had\r\nnever heard the term before, and was besides feeling considerably\r\nworked-up for a plain man with all this mystery he knew not how to\r\ngrapple with--the Colonel stood, with the most dumfoundered look ever\r\nseen on a human countenance, and continued to roar, and stammer, and\r\nstare.\r\n\r\n“And why,” he began, savage with the desire to find something visible\r\nhe could fight--“why, in the name of all the blazes----?” and then\r\nstopped as John Silence moved up and took his arm.\r\n\r\n“There, my dear Colonel Wragge,” he said gently, “you touch the heart\r\nof the whole thing. You ask ‘Why.’ That is precisely our problem.” He\r\nheld the soldier’s eyes firmly with his own. “And that, too, I think,\r\nwe shall soon know. Come and let us talk over a plan of action--that\r\nroom with the double doors, perhaps.”\r\n\r\nThe word “action” calmed him a little, and he led the way, without\r\nfurther speech, back into the house, and down the long stone passage to\r\nthe room where we had heard his stories on the night of our arrival.\r\nI understood from the doctor’s glance that my presence would not make\r\nthe interview easier for our host, and I went upstairs to my own\r\nroom--shaking.\r\n\r\nBut in the solitude of my room the vivid memories of the last hour\r\nrevived so mercilessly that I began to feel I should never in my whole\r\nlife lose the dreadful picture of Miss Wragge running--that dreadful\r\nhuman climax after all the non-human mystery in the wood--and I was not\r\nsorry when a servant knocked at my door and said that Colonel Wragge\r\nwould be glad if I would join them in the little smoking-room.\r\n\r\n“I think it is better you should be present,” was all Colonel Wragge\r\nsaid as I entered the room. I took the chair with my back to the\r\nwindow. There was still an hour before lunch, though I imagine that\r\nthe usual divisions of the day hardly found a place in the thoughts of\r\nany one of us.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the room was what I might call electric. The Colonel\r\nwas positively bristling; he stood with his back to the fire, fingering\r\nan unlit black cigar, his face flushed, his being obviously roused\r\nand ready for action. He hated this mystery. It was poisonous to his\r\nnature, and he longed to meet something face to face--something he\r\ncould gauge and fight. Dr. Silence, I noticed at once, was sitting\r\nbefore the map of the estate which was spread upon a table. I knew\r\nby his expression the state of his mind. He was in the thick of it\r\nall, knew it, delighted in it, and was working at high pressure. He\r\nrecognised my presence with a lifted eyelid, and the flash of the eye,\r\ncontrasted with his stillness and composure, told me volumes.\r\n\r\n“I was about to explain to our host briefly what seems to me afoot in\r\nall this business,” he said without looking up, “when he asked that you\r\nshould join us so that we can all work together.” And, while signifying\r\nmy assent, I caught myself wondering what quality it was in the calm\r\nspeech of this undemonstrative man that was so full of power, so\r\ncharged with the strange, virile personality behind it, and that seemed\r\nto inspire us with his own confidence as by a process of radiation.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hubbard,” he went on gravely, turning to the soldier, “knows\r\nsomething of my methods, and in more than one--er--interesting\r\nsituation has proved of assistance. What we want now”--and here he\r\nsuddenly got up and took his place on the mat beside the Colonel, and\r\nlooked hard at him--“is men who have self-control, who are sure of\r\nthemselves, whose minds at the critical moment will emit positive\r\nforces, instead of the wavering and uncertain currents due to negative\r\nfeelings--due, for instance, to fear.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at us each in turn. Colonel Wragge moved his feet farther\r\napart, and squared his shoulders; and I felt guilty but said nothing,\r\nconscious that my latent store of courage was being deliberately hauled\r\nto the front. He was winding me up like a clock.\r\n\r\n“So that, in what is yet to come,” continued our leader, “each of us\r\nwill contribute his share of power, and ensure success for my plan.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not afraid of anything I can _see_,” said the Colonel bluntly.\r\n\r\n“I’m ready,” I heard myself say, as it were automatically, “for\r\nanything,” and then added, feeling the declaration was lamely\r\ninsufficient, “and everything.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence left the mat and began walking to and fro about the room,\r\nboth hands plunged deep into the pockets of his shooting-jacket.\r\nTremendous vitality streamed from him. I never took my eyes off the\r\nsmall, moving figure; small, yes,--and yet somehow making me think of\r\na giant plotting the destruction of worlds. And his manner was gentle,\r\nas always, soothing almost, and his words uttered quietly without\r\nemphasis or emotion. Most of what he said was addressed, though not too\r\nobviously, to the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“The violence of this sudden attack,” he said softly, pacing to and\r\nfro beneath the bookcase at the end of the room, “is due, of course,\r\npartly to the fact that to-night the moon is at the full”--here he\r\nglanced at me for a moment--“and partly to the fact that we have all\r\nbeen so deliberately concentrating upon the matter. Our thinking, our\r\ninvestigation, has stirred it into unusual activity. I mean that the\r\nintelligent force behind these manifestations has realised that some\r\none is busied about its destruction. And it is now on the defensive:\r\nmore, it is aggressive.”\r\n\r\n“But ‘it’--what is ‘it’?” began the soldier, fuming. “What, in the name\r\nof all that’s dreadful, _is_ a fire-elemental?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot give you at this moment,” replied Dr. Silence, turning to\r\nhim, but undisturbed by the interruption, “a lecture on the nature and\r\nhistory of magic, but can only say that an Elemental is the active\r\nforce behind the elements,--whether earth, air, water, _or fire_,--it\r\nis impersonal in its essential nature, but can be focused, personified,\r\nensouled, so to say, by those who know how--by magicians, if you\r\nwill--for certain purposes of their own, much in the same way that\r\nsteam and electricity can be harnessed by the practical man of this\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n“Alone, these blind elemental energies can accomplish little, but\r\ngoverned and directed by the trained will of a powerful manipulator\r\nthey may become potent activities for good or evil. They are the basis\r\nof all magic, and it is the motive behind them that constitutes the\r\nmagic ‘black’ or ‘white’; they can be the vehicles of curses or of\r\nblessings, for a curse is nothing more than the thought of a violent\r\nwill perpetuated. And in such cases--cases like this--the conscious,\r\ndirecting will of the mind that is using the elemental stands always\r\nbehind the phenomena----”\r\n\r\n“You think that my brother----!” broke in the Colonel, aghast.\r\n\r\n“Has nothing whatever to do with it--directly. The fire-elemental that\r\nhas here been tormenting you and your household was sent upon its\r\nmission long before you, or your family, or your ancestors, or even the\r\nnation you belong to--unless I am much mistaken--was even in existence.\r\nWe will come to that a little later; after the experiment I propose to\r\nmake we shall be more positive. At present I can only say we have to\r\ndeal now, not only with the phenomenon of Attacking Fire merely, but\r\nwith the vindictive and enraged intelligence that is directing it from\r\nbehind the scenes--vindictive and enraged,”--he repeated the words.\r\n\r\n“That explains----” began Colonel Wragge, seeking furiously for words\r\nhe could not find quickly enough.\r\n\r\n“Much,” said John Silence, with a gesture to restrain him.\r\n\r\nHe stopped a moment in the middle of his walk, and a deep silence\r\ncame down over the little room. Through the windows the sunlight\r\nseemed less bright, the long line of dark hills less friendly, making\r\nme think of a vast wave towering to heaven and about to break and\r\noverwhelm us. Something formidable had crept into the world about us.\r\nFor, undoubtedly, there was a disquieting thought, holding terror as\r\nwell as awe, in the picture his words conjured up: the conception of a\r\nhuman will reaching its deathless hand, spiteful and destructive, down\r\nthrough the ages, to strike the living and afflict the innocent.\r\n\r\n“But what _is_ its object?” burst out the soldier, unable to restrain\r\nhimself longer in the silence. “Why does it come from that plantation?\r\nAnd why should it attack us, or any one in particular?” Questions\r\nbegan to pour from him in a stream.\r\n\r\n“All in good time,” the doctor answered quietly, having let him run\r\non for several minutes. “But I must first discover positively what,\r\nor who, it is that directs this particular fire-elemental. And, to\r\ndo that, we must first”--he spoke with slow deliberation--“seek to\r\ncapture--to confine by visibility--to limit its sphere in a concrete\r\nform.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens almighty!” exclaimed the soldier, mixing his words in his\r\nunfeigned surprise.\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” pursued the other calmly; “for in so doing I think we\r\ncan release it from the purpose that binds it, restore it to its\r\nnormal condition of latent fire, and also”--he lowered his voice\r\nperceptibly--“also discover the face and form of the Being that ensouls\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“The man behind the gun!” cried the Colonel, beginning to understand\r\nsomething, and leaning forward so as not to miss a single syllable.\r\n\r\n“I mean that in the last resort, before it returns to the womb of\r\npotential fire, it will probably assume the face and figure of its\r\nDirector, of the man of magical knowledge who originally bound it with\r\nhis incantations and sent it forth upon its mission of centuries.”\r\n\r\nThe soldier sat down and gasped openly in his face, breathing hard; but\r\nit was a very subdued voice that framed the question.\r\n\r\n“And how do you propose to make it visible? How capture and confine it?\r\nWhat d’ye mean, Dr. John Silence?”\r\n\r\n“By furnishing it with the materials for a form. By the process of\r\nmaterialisation simply. Once limited by dimensions, it will become\r\nslow, heavy, visible. We can then dissipate it. Invisible fire, you\r\nsee, is dangerous and incalculable; locked up in a form we can perhaps\r\nmanage it. We must betray it--to its death.”\r\n\r\n“And this material?” we asked in the same breath, although I think I\r\nhad already guessed.\r\n\r\n“Not pleasant, but effective,” came the quiet reply; “the exhalations\r\nof freshly-spilled blood.”\r\n\r\n“Not human blood!” cried Colonel Wragge, starting up from his chair\r\nwith a voice like an explosion. I thought his eyes would start from\r\ntheir sockets.\r\n\r\nThe face of Dr. Silence relaxed in spite of himself, and his\r\nspontaneous little laugh brought a welcome though momentary relief.\r\n\r\n“The days of human sacrifice, I hope, will never come again,” he\r\nexplained. “Animal blood will answer the purpose, and we can make the\r\nexperiment as pleasant as possible. Only, the blood must be freshly\r\nspilled and strong with the vital emanations that attract this peculiar\r\nclass of elemental creature. Perhaps--perhaps if some pig on the estate\r\nis ready for the market----”\r\n\r\nHe turned to hide a smile; but the passing touch of comedy found\r\nno echo in the mind of our host, who did not understand how to\r\nchange quickly from one emotion to another. Clearly he was debating\r\nmany things laboriously in his honest brain. But, in the end, the\r\nearnestness and scientific disinterestedness of the doctor, whose\r\ninfluence over him was already very great, won the day, and he\r\npresently looked up more calmly, and observed shortly that he thought\r\nperhaps the matter could be arranged.\r\n\r\n“There are other and pleasanter methods,” Dr. Silence went on to\r\nexplain, “but they require time and preparation, and things have gone\r\nmuch too far, in my opinion, to admit of delay. And the process need\r\ncause you no distress: we sit round the bowl and await results. Nothing\r\nmore. The emanations of blood--which, as Levi says, is the first\r\nincarnation of the universal fluid--furnish the materials out of which\r\nthe creatures of discarnate life, spirits if you prefer, can fashion\r\nthemselves a temporary appearance. The process is old, and lies at\r\nthe root of all blood sacrifice. It was known to the priests of Baal,\r\nand it is known to the modern ecstasy dancers who cut themselves to\r\nproduce objective phantoms who dance with them. And the least gifted\r\nclairvoyant could tell you that the forms to be seen in the vicinity of\r\nslaughterhouses, or hovering above the deserted battlefield, are--well,\r\nsimply beyond all description. I do not mean,” he added, noticing the\r\nuneasy fidgeting of his host, “that anything in our laundry-experiment\r\nneed appear to terrify us, for this case seems a comparatively simple\r\none, and it is only the vindictive character of the intelligence\r\ndirecting this fire-elemental that causes anxiety and makes for\r\npersonal danger.”\r\n\r\n“It is curious,” said the Colonel, with a sudden rush of words,\r\ndrawing a deep breath, and as though speaking of things distasteful\r\nto him, “that during my years among the Hill Tribes of Northern India\r\nI came across--personally came across--instances of the sacrifices of\r\nblood to certain deities being stopped suddenly, and all manner of\r\ndisasters happening until they were resumed. Fires broke out in the\r\nhuts, and even on the clothes, of the natives--and--and I admit I\r\nhave read, in the course of my studies,”--he made a gesture towards\r\nhis books and heavily laden table,--“of the Yezidis of Syria evoking\r\nphantoms by means of cutting their bodies with knives during their\r\nwhirling dances--enormous globes of fire which turned into monstrous\r\nand terrible forms--and I remember an account somewhere, too, how the\r\nemaciated forms and pallid countenances of the spectres, that appeared\r\nto the Emperor Julian, claimed to be the true Immortals, and told him\r\nto renew the sacrifices of blood ‘for the fumes of which, since the\r\nestablishment of Christianity, they had been pining’--that these were\r\nin reality the phantoms evoked by the rites of blood.”\r\n\r\nBoth Dr. Silence and myself listened in amazement, for this sudden\r\nspeech was so unexpected, and betrayed so much more knowledge than we\r\nhad either of us suspected in the old soldier.\r\n\r\n“Then perhaps you have read, too,” said the doctor, “how the Cosmic\r\nDeities of savage races, elemental in their nature, have been kept\r\nalive through many ages by these blood rites?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered; “that is new to me.”\r\n\r\n“In any case,” Dr. Silence added, “I am glad you are not wholly\r\nunfamiliar with the subject, for you will now bring more sympathy, and\r\ntherefore more help, to our experiment. For, of course, in this case,\r\nwe only want the blood to tempt the creature from its lair and enclose\r\nit in a form----”\r\n\r\n“I quite understand. And I only hesitated just now,” he went on,\r\nhis words coming much more slowly, as though he felt he had already\r\nsaid too much, “because I wished to be quite sure it was no mere\r\ncuriosity, but an actual sense of necessity that dictated this horrible\r\nexperiment.”\r\n\r\n“It is your safety, and that of your household, and of your sister,\r\nthat is at stake,” replied the doctor. “Once I have _seen_, I hope to\r\ndiscover whence this elemental comes, and what its real purpose is.”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge signified his assent with a bow.\r\n\r\n“And the moon will help us,” the other said, “for it will be full in\r\nthe early hours of the morning, and this kind of elemental-being is\r\nalways most active at the period of full moon. Hence, you see, the clue\r\nfurnished by your diary.”\r\n\r\nSo it was finally settled. Colonel Wragge would provide the materials\r\nfor the experiment, and we were to meet at midnight. How he would\r\ncontrive at that hour--but that was his business. I only know we\r\nboth realised that he would keep his word, and whether a pig died at\r\nmidnight, or at noon, was after all perhaps only a question of the\r\nsleep and personal comfort of the executioner.\r\n\r\n“To-night, then, in the laundry,” said Dr. Silence finally, to clinch\r\nthe plan; “we three alone--and at midnight, when the household is\r\nasleep and we shall be free from disturbance.”\r\n\r\nHe exchanged significant glances with our host, who, at that moment,\r\nwas called away by the announcement that the family doctor had arrived,\r\nand was ready to see him in his sister’s room.\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of the afternoon John Silence disappeared. I had my\r\nsuspicions that he made a secret visit to the plantation and also to\r\nthe laundry building; but, in any case, we saw nothing of him, and\r\nhe kept strictly to himself. He was preparing for the night, I felt\r\nsure, but the nature of his preparations I could only guess. There was\r\nmovement in his room, I heard, and an odour like incense hung about the\r\ndoor, and knowing that he regarded rites as the vehicles of energies,\r\nmy guesses were probably not far wrong.\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge, too, remained absent the greater part of the afternoon,\r\nand, deeply afflicted, had scarcely left his sister’s bedside, but in\r\nresponse to my inquiry when we met for a moment at tea-time, he told me\r\nthat although she had moments of attempted speech, her talk was quite\r\nincoherent and hysterical, and she was still quite unable to explain\r\nthe nature of what she had seen. The doctor, he said, feared she had\r\nrecovered the use of her limbs, only to lose that of her memory, and\r\nperhaps even of her mind.\r\n\r\n“Then the recovery of her legs, I trust, may be permanent, at any\r\nrate,” I ventured, finding it difficult to know what sympathy to offer.\r\nAnd he replied with a curious short laugh, “Oh yes; about that there\r\ncan be no doubt whatever.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was due merely to the chance of my overhearing a fragment of\r\nconversation--unwillingly, of course--that a little further light was\r\nthrown upon the state in which the old lady actually lay. For, as I\r\ncame out of my room, it happened that Colonel Wragge and the doctor\r\nwere going downstairs together, and their words floated up to my ears\r\nbefore I could make my presence known by so much as a cough.\r\n\r\n“Then you must find a way,” the doctor was saying with decision; “for\r\nI cannot insist too strongly upon that--and at all costs she must be\r\nkept quiet. These attempts to go out must be prevented--if necessary,\r\nby force. This desire to visit some wood or other she keeps talking\r\nabout is, of course, hysterical in nature. It cannot be permitted for a\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\n“It shall not be permitted,” I heard the soldier reply, as they reached\r\nthe hall below.\r\n\r\n“It has impressed her mind for some reason----” the doctor went on, by\r\nway evidently of soothing explanation, and then the distance made it\r\nimpossible for me to hear more.\r\n\r\nAt dinner Dr. Silence was still absent, on the public plea of a\r\nheadache, and though food was sent to his room, I am inclined to\r\nbelieve he did not touch it, but spent the entire time fasting.\r\n\r\nWe retired early, desiring that the household should do likewise, and\r\nI must confess that at ten o’clock when I bid my host a temporary\r\ngood-night, and sought my room to make what mental preparation I could,\r\nI realised in no very pleasant fashion that it was a singular and\r\nformidable assignation, this midnight meeting in the laundry building,\r\nand that there were moments in every adventure of life when a wise\r\nman, and one who knew his own limitations, owed it to his dignity\r\nto withdraw discreetly. And, but for the character of our leader, I\r\nprobably should have then and there offered the best excuse I could\r\nthink of, and have allowed myself quietly to fall asleep and wait for\r\nan exciting story in the morning of what had happened. But with a man\r\nlike John Silence, such a lapse was out of the question, and I sat\r\nbefore my fire counting the minutes and doing everything I could think\r\nof to fortify my resolution and fasten my will at the point where I\r\ncould be reasonably sure that my self-control would hold against all\r\nattacks of men, devils, or elementals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAt a quarter before midnight, clad in a heavy ulster, and with\r\nslippered feet, I crept cautiously from my room and stole down the\r\npassage to the top of the stairs. Outside the doctor’s door I waited\r\na moment to listen. All was still; the house in utter darkness; no\r\ngleam of light beneath any door; only, down the length of the corridor,\r\nfrom the direction of the sick-room, came faint sounds of laughter\r\nand incoherent talk that were not things to reassure a mind already\r\nhalf a-tremble, and I made haste to reach the hall and let myself out\r\nthrough the front door into the night.\r\n\r\nThe air was keen and frosty, perfumed with night smells, and\r\nexquisitely fresh; all the million candles of the sky were alight, and\r\na faint breeze rose and fell with far-away sighings in the tops of the\r\npine trees. My blood leaped for a moment in the spaciousness of the\r\nnight, for the splendid stars brought courage; but the next instant,\r\nas I turned the corner of the house, moving stealthily down the gravel\r\ndrive, my spirits sank again ominously. For, yonder, over the funereal\r\nplumes of the Twelve Acre Plantation, I saw the huge and yellow face\r\nof the full moon just rising in the east, staring down like some vast\r\nBeing come to watch upon the progress of our doom. Seen through the\r\ndistorting vapours of the earth’s atmosphere, her face looked weirdly\r\nunfamiliar, her usual expression of benignant vacancy somehow a-twist.\r\nI slipped along by the shadows of the wall, keeping my eyes upon the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe laundry-house, as already described, stood detached from the other\r\noffices, with laurel shrubberies crowding thickly behind it, and the\r\nkitchen-garden so close on the other side that the strong smells of\r\nsoil and growing things came across almost heavily. The shadows of the\r\nhaunted plantation, hugely lengthened by the rising moon behind them,\r\nreached to the very walls and covered the stone tiles of the roof with\r\na dark pall. So keenly were my senses alert at this moment that I\r\nbelieve I could fill a chapter with the endless small details of the\r\nimpression I received--shadows, odour, shapes, sounds--in the space of\r\nthe few seconds I stood and waited before the closed wooden door.\r\n\r\nThen I became aware of some one moving towards me through the\r\nmoonlight, and the figure of John Silence, without overcoat and\r\nbareheaded, came quickly and without noise to join me. His eyes, I saw\r\nat once, were wonderfully bright, and so marked was the shining pallor\r\nof his face that I could hardly tell when he passed from the moonlight\r\ninto the shade.\r\n\r\nHe passed without a word, beckoning me to follow, and then pushed the\r\ndoor open, and went in.\r\n\r\nThe chill air of the place met us like that of an underground vault;\r\nand the brick floor and whitewashed walls, streaked with damp and\r\nsmoke, threw back the cold in our faces. Directly opposite gaped the\r\nblack throat of the huge open fireplace, the ashes of wood fires\r\nstill piled and scattered about the hearth, and on either side of\r\nthe projecting chimney-column were the deep recesses holding the big\r\ntwin cauldrons for boiling clothes. Upon the lids of these cauldrons\r\nstood the two little oil lamps, shaded red, which gave all the light\r\nthere was, and immediately in front of the fireplace there was a small\r\ncircular table with three chairs set about it. Overhead, the narrow\r\nslit windows, high up the walls, pointed to a dim network of wooden\r\nrafters half lost among the shadows, and then came the dark vault of\r\nthe roof. Cheerless and unalluring, for all the red light, it certainly\r\nwas, reminding me of some unused conventicle, bare of pews or pulpit,\r\nugly and severe, and I was forcibly struck by the contrast between the\r\nnormal uses to which the place was ordinarily put, and the strange and\r\nmediæval purpose which had brought us under its roof to-night.\r\n\r\nPossibly an involuntary shudder ran over me, for my companion turned\r\nwith a confident look to reassure me, and he was so completely master\r\nof himself that I at once absorbed from his abundance, and felt the\r\nchinks of my failing courage beginning to close up. To meet his eye in\r\nthe presence of danger was like finding a mental railing that guided\r\nand supported thought along the giddy edges of alarm.\r\n\r\n“I am quite ready,” I whispered, turning to listen for approaching\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\nHe nodded, still keeping his eyes on mine. Our whispers sounded hollow\r\nas they echoed overhead among the rafters.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you are here,” he said. “Not all would have the courage.\r\nKeep your thoughts controlled, and imagine the protective shell round\r\nyou--round your _inner_ being.”\r\n\r\n“I’m all right,” I repeated, cursing my chattering teeth.\r\n\r\nHe took my hand and shook it, and the contact seemed to shake into me\r\nsomething of his supreme confidence. The eyes and hands of a strong man\r\ncan touch the soul. I think he guessed my thought, for a passing smile\r\nflashed about the corners of his mouth.\r\n\r\n“You will feel more comfortable,” he said, in a low tone, “when\r\nthe chain is complete. The Colonel we can count on, of course.\r\nRemember, though,” he added warningly, “he may perhaps become\r\ncontrolled--possessed--when the thing comes, because he won’t know how\r\nto resist. And to explain the business to such a man----!” He shrugged\r\nhis shoulders expressively. “But it will only be temporary, and I will\r\nsee that no harm comes to him.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced round at the arrangements with approval.\r\n\r\n“Red light,” he said, indicating the shaded lamps, “has the lowest rate\r\nof vibration. Materialisations are dissipated by strong light--won’t\r\nform, or hold together--in rapid vibrations.”\r\n\r\nI was not sure that I approved altogether of this dim light, for in\r\ncomplete darkness there is something protective--the knowledge that one\r\ncannot be seen, probably--which a half-light destroys, but I remembered\r\nthe warning to keep my thoughts steady, and forbore to give them\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThere was a step outside, and the figure of Colonel Wragge stood in the\r\ndoorway. Though entering on tiptoe, he made considerable noise and\r\nclatter, for his free movements were impeded by the burden he carried,\r\nand we saw a large yellowish bowl held out at arms’ length from his\r\nbody, the mouth covered with a white cloth. His face, I noted, was\r\nrigidly composed. He, too, was master of himself. And, as I thought of\r\nthis old soldier moving through the long series of alarms, worn with\r\nwatching and wearied with assault, unenlightened yet undismayed, even\r\ndown to the dreadful shock of his sister’s terror, and still showing\r\nthe dogged pluck that persists in the face of defeat, I understood what\r\nDr. Silence meant when he described him as a man “to be counted on.”\r\n\r\nI think there was nothing beyond this rigidity of his stern features,\r\nand a certain greyness of the complexion, to betray the turmoil of the\r\nemotions that was doubtless going on within; and the quality of these\r\ntwo men, each in his own way, so keyed me up that, by the time the door\r\nwas shut and we had exchanged silent greetings, all the latent courage\r\nI possessed was well to the fore, and I felt as sure of myself as I\r\nknew I ever could feel.\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge set the bowl carefully in the centre of the table.\r\n\r\n“Midnight,” he said shortly, glancing at his watch, and we all three\r\nmoved to our chairs.\r\n\r\nThere, in the middle of that cold and silent place, we sat, with\r\nthe vile bowl before us, and a thin, hardly perceptible steam\r\nrising through the damp air from the surface of the white cloth and\r\ndisappearing upwards the moment it passed beyond the zone of red light\r\nand entered the deep shadows thrown forward by the projecting wall of\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had indicated our respective places, and I found myself\r\nseated with my back to the door and opposite the black hearth. The\r\nColonel was on my left, and Dr. Silence on my right, both half facing\r\nme, the latter more in shadow than the former. We thus divided the\r\nlittle table into even sections, and sitting back in our chairs we\r\nawaited events in silence.\r\n\r\nFor something like an hour I do not think there was even the faintest\r\nsound within those four walls and under the canopy of that vaulted\r\nroof. Our slippers made no scratching on the gritty floor, and our\r\nbreathing was suppressed almost to nothing; even the rustle of our\r\nclothes as we shifted from time to time upon our seats was inaudible.\r\nSilence smothered us absolutely--the silence of night, of listening,\r\nthe silence of a haunted expectancy. The very gurgling of the lamps was\r\ntoo soft to be heard, and if light itself had sound, I do not think we\r\nshould have noticed the silvery tread of the moonlight as it entered\r\nthe high narrow windows and threw upon the floor the slender traces of\r\nits pallid footsteps.\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge and the doctor, and myself too for that matter, sat thus\r\nlike figures of stone, without speech and without gesture. My eyes\r\npassed in ceaseless journeys from the bowl to their faces, and from\r\ntheir faces to the bowl. They might have been masks, however, for all\r\nthe signs of life they gave; and the light steaming from the horrid\r\ncontents beneath the white cloth had long ceased to be visible.\r\n\r\nThen presently, as the moon rose higher, the wind rose with it. It\r\nsighed, like the lightest of passing wings, over the roof; it crept\r\nmost softly round the walls; it made the brick floor like ice beneath\r\nour feet. With it I saw mentally the desolate moorland flowing like\r\na sea about the old house, the treeless expanse of lonely hills, the\r\nnearer copses, sombre, and mysterious in the night. _The_ plantation,\r\ntoo, in particular I saw, and imagined I heard the mournful whisperings\r\nthat must now be a-stirring among its tree-tops as the breeze played\r\ndown between the twisted stems. In the depth of the room behind us the\r\nshafts of moonlight met and crossed in a growing network.\r\n\r\nIt was after an hour of this wearing and unbroken attention, and I\r\nshould judge about one o’clock in the morning, when the baying of\r\nthe dogs in the stable-yard first began, and I saw John Silence move\r\nsuddenly in his chair and sit up in an attitude of attention. Every\r\nforce in my being instantly leaped into the keenest vigilance. Colonel\r\nWragge moved too, though slowly, and without raising his eyes from the\r\ntable before him.\r\n\r\nThe doctor stretched his arm out and took the white cloth from the bowl.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps imagination that persuaded me the red glare of the lamps\r\ngrew fainter and the air over the table before us thickened. I had been\r\nexpecting something for so long that the movement of my companions,\r\nand the lifting of the cloth, may easily have caused the momentary\r\ndelusion that something hovered in the air before my face, touching\r\nthe skin of my cheeks with a silken run. But it was certainly not a\r\ndelusion that the Colonel looked up at the same moment and glanced over\r\nhis shoulder, as though his eyes followed the movements of something\r\nto and fro about the room, and that he then buttoned his overcoat more\r\ntightly about him and his eyes sought my own face first, and then the\r\ndoctor’s. And it was no delusion that his face seemed somehow to have\r\nturned dark, become spread as it were with a shadowy blackness. I saw\r\nhis lips tighten and his expression grow hard and stern, and it came to\r\nme then with a rush that, of course, this man had told us but a part of\r\nthe experiences he had been through in the house, and that there was\r\nmuch more he had never been able to bring himself to reveal at all.\r\nI felt sure of it. The way he turned and stared about him betrayed a\r\nfamiliarity with other things than those he had described to us. It was\r\nnot merely a sight of fire he looked for; it was a sight of something\r\nalive, intelligent, something able to evade his searching; it was _a\r\nperson_. It was the watch for the ancient Being who sought to obsess\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd the way in which Dr. Silence answered his look--though it was only\r\nby a glance of subtlest sympathy--confirmed my impression.\r\n\r\n“We may be ready now,” I heard him say in a whisper, and I understood\r\nthat his words were intended as a steadying warning, and braced myself\r\nmentally to the utmost of my power.\r\n\r\nYet long before Colonel Wragge had turned to stare about the room, and\r\nlong before the doctor had confirmed my impression that things were at\r\nlast beginning to stir, I had become aware in most singular fashion\r\nthat the place held more than our three selves. With the rising of the\r\nwind this increase to our numbers had first taken place. The baying of\r\nthe hounds almost seemed to have signalled it. I cannot say how it may\r\nbe possible to realise that an empty place has suddenly become--not\r\nempty, when the new arrival is nothing that appeals to any one of the\r\nsenses; for this recognition of an “invisible,” as of the change in the\r\nbalance of personal forces in a human group, is indefinable and beyond\r\nproof. Yet it is unmistakable. And I knew perfectly well at what given\r\nmoment the atmosphere within these four walls became charged with the\r\npresence of other living beings besides ourselves. And, on reflection,\r\nI am convinced that both my companions knew it too.\r\n\r\n“Watch the light,” said the doctor under his breath, and, then I knew\r\ntoo that it was no fancy of my own that had turned the air darker, and\r\nthe way he turned to examine the face of our host sent an electric\r\nthrill of wonder and expectancy shivering along every nerve in my body.\r\n\r\nYet it was no kind of terror that I experienced, but rather a sort of\r\nmental dizziness, and a sensation as of being suspended in some remote\r\nand dreadful altitude where things might happen, indeed were about to\r\nhappen, that had never before happened within the ken of man. Horror\r\nmay have formed an ingredient, but it was not chiefly horror, and in no\r\nsense ghostly horror.\r\n\r\nUncommon thoughts kept beating on my brain like tiny hammers, soft yet\r\npersistent, seeking admission; their unbidden tide began to wash along\r\nthe far fringes of my mind, the currents of unwonted sensations to rise\r\nover the remote frontiers of my consciousness. I was aware of thoughts,\r\nand the fantasies of thoughts, that I never knew before existed.\r\nPortions of my being stirred that had never stirred before, and things\r\nancient and inexplicable rose to the surface and beckoned me to follow.\r\nI felt as though I were about to fly off, at some immense tangent,\r\ninto an outer space hitherto unknown even in dreams. And so singular\r\nwas the result produced upon me that I was uncommonly glad to anchor my\r\nmind, as well as my eyes, upon the masterful personality of the doctor\r\nat my side, for there, I realised, I could draw always upon the forces\r\nof sanity and safety.\r\n\r\nWith a vigorous effort of will I returned to the scene before me, and\r\ntried to focus my attention, with steadier thoughts, upon the table,\r\nand upon the silent figures seated round it. And then I saw that\r\ncertain changes had come about in the place where we sat.\r\n\r\nThe patches of moonlight on the floor, I noted, had become curiously\r\nshaded; the faces of my companions opposite were not so clearly\r\nvisible as before; and the forehead and cheeks of Colonel Wragge were\r\nglistening with perspiration. I realised further, that an extraordinary\r\nchange had come about in the temperature of the atmosphere. The\r\nincreased warmth had a painful effect, not alone on Colonel Wragge, but\r\nupon all of us. It was oppressive and unnatural. We gasped figuratively\r\nas well as actually.\r\n\r\n“You are the first to feel it,” said Dr. Silence in low tones, looking\r\nacross at him. “You are in more intimate touch, of course----”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was trembling, and appeared to be in considerable distress.\r\nHis knees shook, so that the shuffling of his slippered feet became\r\naudible. He inclined his head to show that he had heard, but made no\r\nother reply. I think, even then, he was sore put to it to keep himself\r\nin hand. I knew what he was struggling against. As Dr. Silence had\r\nwarned me, he was about to be obsessed, and was savagely, though\r\nvainly, resisting.\r\n\r\nBut, meanwhile, a curious and whirling sense of exhilaration began\r\nto come over me. The increasing heat was delightful, bringing a\r\nsensation of intense activity, of thoughts pouring through the mind\r\nat high speed, of vivid pictures in the brain, of fierce desires and\r\nlightning energies alive in every part of the body. I was conscious of\r\nno physical distress, such as the Colonel felt, but only of a vague\r\nfeeling that it might all grow suddenly too intense--that I might be\r\nconsumed--that my personality as well as my body, might become resolved\r\ninto the flame of pure spirit. I began to live at a speed too intense\r\nto last. It was as if a thousand ecstasies besieged me----\r\n\r\n“Steady!” whispered the voice of John Silence in my ear, and I looked\r\nup with a start to see that the Colonel had risen from his chair. The\r\ndoctor rose too. I followed suit, and for the first time saw down into\r\nthe bowl. To my amazement and horror I saw that the contents were\r\ntroubled. The blood was astir with movement.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the experiment was witnessed by us standing. It came, too,\r\nwith a curious suddenness. There was no more dreaming, for me at any\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the figure of Colonel Wragge standing there beside\r\nme, upright and unshaken, squarely planted on his feet, looking about\r\nhim, puzzled beyond belief, yet full of a fighting anger. Framed by\r\nthe white walls, the red glow of the lamps upon his streaming cheeks,\r\nhis eyes glowing against the deathly pallor of his skin, breathing\r\nhard and making convulsive efforts of hands and body to keep himself\r\nunder control, his whole being roused to the point of savage fighting,\r\nyet with nothing visible to get at anywhere--he stood there, immovable\r\nagainst odds. And the strange contrast of the pale skin and the burning\r\nface I had never seen before, or wish to seen again.\r\n\r\nBut what has left an even sharper impression on my memory was the\r\nblackness that then began crawling over his face, obliterating the\r\nfeatures, concealing their human outline, and hiding him inch by\r\ninch from view. This was my first realisation that the process of\r\nmaterialisation was at work. His visage became shrouded. I moved from\r\none side to the other to keep him in view, and it was only then I\r\nunderstood that, properly speaking, the blackness was not upon the\r\ncountenance of Colonel Wragge, but that something had inserted itself\r\nbetween me and him, thus screening his face with the effect of a dark\r\nveil. Something that apparently rose through the floor was passing\r\nslowly into the air above the table and above the bowl. The blood in\r\nthe bowl, moreover, was considerably less than before.\r\n\r\nAnd, with this change in the air before us, there came at the same\r\ntime a further change, I thought, in the face of the soldier. One-half\r\nwas turned towards the red lamps, while the other caught the pale\r\nillumination of the moonlight falling aslant from the high windows,\r\nso that it was difficult to estimate this change with accuracy of\r\ndetail. But it seemed to me that, while the features--eyes, nose,\r\nmouth--remained the same, the life informing them had undergone some\r\nprofound transformation. The signature of a new power had crept into\r\nthe face and left its traces there--an expression dark, and in some\r\nunexplained way, terrible.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he opened his mouth and spoke, and the sound of this\r\nchanged voice, deep and musical though it was, made me cold and set\r\nmy heart beating with uncomfortable rapidity. The Being, as he had\r\ndreaded, was already in control of his brain, using his mouth.\r\n\r\n“I see a blackness like the blackness of Egypt before my face,” said\r\nthe tones of this unknown voice that seemed half his own and half\r\nanother’s. “And out of this darkness they come, they come.”\r\n\r\nI gave a dreadful start. The doctor turned to look at me for an\r\ninstant, and then turned to centre his attention upon the figure of our\r\nhost, and I understood in some intuitive fashion that he was there to\r\nwatch over the strangest contest man ever saw--to watch over and, if\r\nnecessary, to protect.\r\n\r\n“He is being controlled--possessed,” he whispered to me through the\r\nshadows. His face wore a wonderful expression, half triumph, half\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nEven as Colonel Wragge spoke, it seemed to me that this visible\r\ndarkness began to increase, pouring up thickly out of the ground by\r\nthe hearth, rising up in sheets and veils, shrouding our eyes and\r\nfaces. It stole up from below--an awful blackness that seemed to drink\r\nin all the radiations of light in the building, leaving nothing but\r\nthe ghost of a radiance in their place. Then, out of this rising sea\r\nof shadows, issued a pale and spectral light that gradually spread\r\nitself about us, and from the heart of this light I saw the shapes of\r\nfire crowd and gather. And these were not human shapes, or the shapes\r\nof anything I recognised as alive in the world, but outlines of fire\r\nthat traced globes, triangles, crosses, and the luminous bodies of\r\nvarious geometrical figures. They grew bright, faded, and then grew\r\nbright again with an effect almost of pulsation. They passed swiftly\r\nto and fro through the air, rising and falling, and particularly in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the Colonel, often gathering about his\r\nhead and shoulders, and even appearing to settle upon him like giant\r\ninsects of flame. They were accompanied, moreover, by a faint sound of\r\nhissing--the same sound we had heard that afternoon in the plantation.\r\n\r\n“The fire-elementals that precede their master,” the doctor said in an\r\nundertone. “Be ready.”\r\n\r\nAnd while this weird display of the shapes of fire alternately flashed\r\nand faded, and the hissing echoed faintly among the dim rafters\r\noverhead, we heard the awful voice issue at intervals from the lips of\r\nthe afflicted soldier. It was a voice of power, splendid in some way I\r\ncannot describe, and with a certain sense of majesty in its cadences,\r\nand, as I listened to it with quickly-beating heart, I could fancy it\r\nwas some ancient voice of Time itself, echoing down immense corridors\r\nof stone, from the depths of vast temples, from the very heart of\r\nmountain tombs.\r\n\r\n“I have seen my divine Father, Osiris,” thundered the great tones. “I\r\nhave scattered the gloom of the night. I have burst through the earth,\r\nand am one with the starry Deities!”\r\n\r\nSomething grand came into the soldier’s face. He was staring fixedly\r\nbefore him, as though seeing nothing.\r\n\r\n“Watch,” whispered Dr. Silence in my ear, and his whisper seemed to\r\ncome from very far away.\r\n\r\nAgain the mouth opened and the awesome voice issued forth.\r\n\r\n“Thoth,” it boomed, “has loosened the bandages of Set which fettered my\r\nmouth. I have taken my place in the great winds of heaven.”\r\n\r\nI heard the little wind of night, with its mournful voice of ages,\r\nsighing round the walls and over the roof.\r\n\r\n“Listen!” came from the doctor at my side, and the thunder of the voice\r\ncontinued--\r\n\r\n“I have hidden myself with you, O ye stars that never diminish. I\r\nremember my name--in--the--House--of--Fire!”\r\n\r\nThe voice ceased and the sound died away. Something about the face and\r\nfigure of Colonel Wragge relaxed, I thought. The terrible look passed\r\nfrom his face. The Being that obsessed him was gone.\r\n\r\n“The great Ritual,” said Dr. Silence aside to me, very low, “the Book\r\nof the Dead. Now it’s leaving him. Soon the blood will fashion it a\r\nbody.”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge, who had stood absolutely motionless all this time,\r\nsuddenly swayed, so that I thought he was going to fall,--and, but for\r\nthe quick support of the doctor’s arm, he probably would have fallen,\r\nfor he staggered as in the beginning of collapse.\r\n\r\n“I am drunk with the wine of Osiris,” he cried,--and it was half with\r\nhis own voice this time--“but Horus, the Eternal Watcher, is about my\r\npath--for--safety.” The voice dwindled and failed, dying away into\r\nsomething almost like a cry of distress.\r\n\r\n“Now, watch closely,” said Dr. Silence, speaking loud, “for after the\r\ncry will come the Fire!”\r\n\r\nI began to tremble involuntarily; an awful change had come without\r\nwarning into the air; my legs grew weak as paper beneath my weight and\r\nI had to support myself by leaning on the table. Colonel Wragge, I\r\nsaw, was also leaning forward with a kind of droop. The shapes of fire\r\nhad vanished all, but his face was lit by the red lamps and the pale\r\nshifting moonlight rose behind him like mist.\r\n\r\nWe were both gazing at the bowl, now almost empty; the Colonel stooped\r\nso low I feared every minute he would lose his balance and drop into\r\nit; and the shadow, that had so long been in process of forming, now at\r\nlength began to assume material outline in the air before us.\r\n\r\nThen John Silence moved forward quickly. He took his place between us\r\nand the shadow. Erect, formidable, absolute master of the situation, I\r\nsaw him stand there, his face calm and almost smiling, and fire in his\r\neyes. His protective influence was astounding and incalculable. Even\r\nthe abhorrent dread I felt at the sight of the creature growing into\r\nlife and substance before us, lessened in some way so that I was able\r\nto keep my eyes fixed on the air above the bowl without too vivid a\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nBut as it took shape, rising out of nothing as it were, and growing\r\nmomentarily more defined in outline, a period of utter and wonderful\r\nsilence settled down upon the building and all it contained. A hush of\r\nages, like the sudden centre of peace at the heart of the travelling\r\ncyclone, descended through the night, and out of this hush, as out of\r\nthe emanations of the steaming blood, issued the form of the ancient\r\nbeing who had first sent the elemental of fire upon its mission. It\r\ngrew and darkened and solidified before our eyes. It rose from just\r\nbeyond the table so that the lower portions remained invisible, but I\r\nsaw the outline limn itself upon the air, as though slowly revealed by\r\nthe rising of a curtain. It apparently had not then quite concentrated\r\nto the normal proportions, but was spread out on all sides into space,\r\nhuge, though rapidly condensing, for I saw the colossal shoulders, the\r\nneck, the lower portion of the dark jaws, the terrible mouth, and then\r\nthe teeth and lips--and, as the veil seemed to lift further upon the\r\ntremendous face--I saw the nose and cheek bones. In another moment I\r\nshould have looked straight into the eyes----\r\n\r\nBut what Dr. Silence did at that moment was so unexpected, and took me\r\nso by surprise, that I have never yet properly understood its nature,\r\nand he has never yet seen fit to explain in detail to me. He uttered\r\nsome sound that had a note of command in it--and, in so doing, stepped\r\nforward and intervened between me and the face. The figure, just\r\nnearing completeness, he therefore hid from my sight--and I have always\r\nthought purposely hid from my sight.\r\n\r\n“The fire!” he cried out. “The fire! Beware!”\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden roar as of flame from the very mouth of the pit,\r\nand for the space of a single second all grew light as day. A blinding\r\nflash passed across my face, and there was heat for an instant that\r\nseemed to shrivel skin, and flesh, and bone. Then came steps, and I\r\nheard Colonel Wragge utter a great cry, wilder than any human cry I\r\nhave ever known. The heat sucked all the breath out of my lungs with a\r\nrush, and the blaze of light, as it vanished, swept my vision with it\r\ninto enveloping darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen I recovered the use of my senses a few moments later I saw that\r\nColonel Wragge with a face of death, its whiteness strangely stained,\r\nhad moved closer to me. Dr. Silence stood beside him, an expression of\r\ntriumph and success in his eyes. The next minute the soldier tried to\r\nclutch me with his hand. Then he reeled, staggered, and, unable to save\r\nhimself, fell with a great crash upon the brick floor.\r\n\r\nAfter the sheet of flame, a wind raged round the building as though it\r\nwould lift the roof off, but then passed as suddenly as it came. And in\r\nthe intense calm that followed I saw that the form had vanished, and\r\nthe doctor was stooping over Colonel Wragge upon the floor, trying to\r\nlift him to a sitting position.\r\n\r\n“Light,” he said quietly, “more light. Take the shades off.”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge sat up and the glare of the unshaded lamps fell upon\r\nhis face. It was grey and drawn, still running heat, and there was a\r\nlook in the eyes and about the corners of the mouth that seemed in this\r\nshort space of time to have added years to its age. At the same time,\r\nthe expression of effort and anxiety had left it. It showed relief.\r\n\r\n“Gone!” he said, looking up at the doctor in a dazed fashion, and\r\nstruggling to his feet. “Thank God! it’s gone at last.” He stared\r\nround the laundry as though to find out where he was. “Did it control\r\nme--take possession of me? Did I talk nonsense?” he asked bluntly.\r\n“After the heat came, I remember nothing----”\r\n\r\n“You’ll feel yourself again in a few minutes,” the doctor said. To my\r\ninfinite horror I saw that he was surreptitiously wiping sundry dark\r\nstains from the face. “Our experiment has been a success and----”\r\n\r\nHe gave me a swift glance to hide the bowl, standing between me and our\r\nhost while I hurriedly stuffed it down under the lid of the nearest\r\ncauldron.\r\n\r\n“----and none of us the worse for it,” he finished.\r\n\r\n“And fires?” he asked, still dazed, “there’ll be no more fires?”\r\n\r\n“It is dissipated--partly, at any rate,” replied Dr. Silence cautiously.\r\n\r\n“And the man behind the gun,” he went on, only half realising what he\r\nwas saying, I think; “have you discovered _that_?”\r\n\r\n“A form materialised,” said the doctor briefly. “I know for certain now\r\nwhat the directing intelligence was behind it all.”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge pulled himself together and got upon his feet. The words\r\nconveyed no clear meaning to him yet. But his memory was returning\r\ngradually, and he was trying to piece together the fragments into a\r\nconnected whole. He shivered a little, for the place had grown suddenly\r\nchilly. The air was empty again, lifeless.\r\n\r\n“You feel all right again now,” Dr. Silence said, in the tone of a man\r\nstating a fact rather than asking a question.\r\n\r\n“Thanks to you--both, yes.” He drew a deep breath, and mopped his face,\r\nand even attempted a smile. He made me think of a man coming from the\r\nbattlefield with the stains of fighting still upon him, but scornful of\r\nhis wounds. Then he turned gravely towards the doctor with a question\r\nin his eyes. Memory had returned and he was himself again.\r\n\r\n“Precisely what I expected,” the doctor said calmly; “a fire-elemental\r\nsent upon its mission in the days of Thebes, centuries before Christ,\r\nand to-night, for the first time all these thousands of years, released\r\nfrom the spell that originally bound it.”\r\n\r\nWe stared at him in amazement, Colonel Wragge opening his lips for\r\nwords that refused to shape themselves.\r\n\r\n“And, if we dig,” he continued significantly, pointing to the floor\r\nwhere the blackness had poured up, “we shall find some underground\r\nconnection--a tunnel most likely--leading to the Twelve Acre Wood. It\r\nwas made by--your predecessor.”\r\n\r\n“A tunnel made by my brother!” gasped the soldier. “Then my sister\r\nshould know--she lived here with him----” He stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\nJohn Silence inclined his head slowly. “I think so,” he said quietly.\r\n“Your brother, no doubt, was as much tormented as you have been,”\r\nhe continued after a pause in which Colonel Wragge seemed deeply\r\npreoccupied with his thoughts, “and tried to find peace by burying it\r\nin the wood, and surrounding the wood then, like a large magic circle,\r\nwith the enchantments of the old formulæ. So the stars the man saw\r\nblazing----”\r\n\r\n“But burying _what_?” asked the soldier faintly, stepping backwards\r\ntowards the support of the wall.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence regarded us both intently for a moment before he replied.\r\nI think he weighed in his mind whether to tell us now, or when the\r\ninvestigation was absolutely complete.\r\n\r\n“The mummy,” he said softly, after a moment; “the mummy that your\r\nbrother took from its resting-place of centuries, and brought\r\nhome--here.”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge dropped down upon the nearest chair, hanging\r\nbreathlessly on every word. He was far too amazed for speech.\r\n\r\n“The mummy of some important person--a priest most likely--protected\r\nfrom disturbance and desecration by the ceremonial magic of the time.\r\nFor they understood how to attach to the mummy, to lock up with it in\r\nthe tomb, an elemental force that would direct itself even after ages\r\nupon any one who dared to molest it. In this case it was an elemental\r\nof fire.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence crossed the floor and turned out the lamps one by one. He\r\nhad nothing more to say for the moment. Following his example, I folded\r\nthe table together and took up the chairs, and our host, still dazed\r\nand silent, mechanically obeyed him and moved to the door.\r\n\r\nWe removed all traces of the experiment, taking the empty bowl back to\r\nthe house concealed beneath an ulster.\r\n\r\nThe air was cool and fragrant as we walked to the house, the stars\r\nbeginning to fade overhead and a fresh wind of early morning blowing up\r\nout of the east where the sky was already hinting of the coming day. It\r\nwas after five o’clock.\r\n\r\nStealthily we entered the front hall and locked the door, and as we\r\nwent on tiptoe upstairs to our rooms, the Colonel, peering at us over\r\nhis candle as he nodded good-night, whispered that if we were ready\r\nthe digging should be begun that very day.\r\n\r\nThen I saw him steal along to his sister’s room and disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBut not even the mysterious references to the mummy, or the prospect of\r\na revelation by digging, were able to hinder the reaction that followed\r\nthe intense excitement of the past twelve hours, and I slept the sleep\r\nof the dead, dreamless and undisturbed. A touch on the shoulder woke\r\nme, and I saw Dr. Silence standing beside the bed, dressed to go out.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said, “it’s tea-time. You’ve slept the best part of a dozen\r\nhours.”\r\n\r\nI sprang up and made a hurried toilet, while my companion sat and\r\ntalked. He looked fresh and rested, and his manner was even quieter\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Wragge has provided spades and pickaxes. We’re going out to\r\nunearth this mummy at once,” he said; “and there’s no reason we should\r\nnot get away by the morning train.”\r\n\r\n“I’m ready to go to-night, if you are,” I said honestly.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Silence shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I must see this through to the end,” he said gravely, and in a tone\r\nthat made me think he still anticipated serious things, perhaps. He\r\nwent on talking while I dressed.\r\n\r\n“This case is really typical of all stories of mummy-haunting, and\r\nnone of them are cases to trifle with,” he explained, “for the mummies\r\nof important people--kings, priests, magicians--were laid away with\r\nprofoundly significant ceremonial, and were very effectively protected,\r\nas you have seen, against desecration, and especially against\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n“The general belief,” he went on, anticipating my questions, “held,\r\nof course, that the perpetuity of the mummy guaranteed that of its\r\nKa,--the owner’s spirit,--but it is not improbable that the magical\r\nembalming was also used to retard reincarnation, the preservation of\r\nthe body preventing the return of the spirit to the toil and discipline\r\nof earth-life; and, in any case, they knew how to attach powerful\r\nguardian-forces to keep off trespassers. And any one who dared to\r\nremove the mummy, or especially to unwind it--well,” he added, with\r\nmeaning, “you have seen--and you _will_ see.”\r\n\r\nI caught his face in the mirror while I struggled with my collar. It\r\nwas deeply serious. There could be no question that he spoke of what he\r\nbelieved and knew.\r\n\r\n“The traveller-brother who brought it here must have been haunted too,”\r\nhe continued, “for he tried to banish it by burial in the wood, making\r\na magic circle to enclose it. Something of genuine ceremonial he must\r\nhave known, for the stars the man saw were of course the remains of the\r\nstill flaming pentagrams he traced at intervals in the circle. Only he\r\ndid not know enough, or possibly was ignorant that the mummy’s guardian\r\nwas a fire-force. Fire cannot be enclosed by fire, though, as you saw,\r\nit can be released by it.”\r\n\r\n“Then that awful figure in the laundry?” I asked, thrilled to find him\r\nso communicative.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly the actual Ka of the mummy operating always behind its\r\nagent, the elemental, and most likely thousands of years old.”\r\n\r\n“And Miss Wragge----?” I ventured once more.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Miss Wragge,” he repeated with increased gravity, “Miss Wragge----”\r\n\r\nA knock at the door brought a servant with word that tea was ready,\r\nand the Colonel had sent to ask if we were coming down. The thread was\r\nbroken. Dr. Silence moved to the door and signed to me to follow. But\r\nhis manner told me that in any case no real answer would have been\r\nforthcoming to my question.\r\n\r\n“And the place to dig in,” I asked, unable to restrain my curiosity,\r\n“will you find it by some process of divination or----?”\r\n\r\nHe paused at the door and looked back at me, and with that he left me\r\nto finish my dressing.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark when the three of us silently made our way to the\r\nTwelve Acre Plantation; the sky was overcast, and a black wind came out\r\nof the east. Gloom hung about the old house and the air seemed full of\r\nsighings. We found the tools ready laid at the edge of the wood, and\r\neach shouldering his piece, we followed our leader at once in among the\r\ntrees. He went straight forward for some twenty yards and then stopped.\r\nAt his feet lay the blackened circle of one of the burned places. It\r\nwas just discernible against the surrounding white grass.\r\n\r\n“There are three of these,” he said, “and they all lie in a line with\r\none another. Any one of them will tap the tunnel that connects the\r\nlaundry--the former Museum--with the chamber where the mummy now lies\r\nburied.”\r\n\r\nHe at once cleared away the burnt grass and began to dig; we all began\r\nto dig. While I used the pick, the others shovelled vigorously. No\r\none spoke. Colonel Wragge worked the hardest of the three. The soil\r\nwas light and sandy, and there were only a few snake-like roots and\r\noccasional loose stones to delay us. The pick made short work of these.\r\nAnd meanwhile the darkness settled about us and the biting wind swept\r\nroaring through the trees overhead.\r\n\r\nThen, quite suddenly, without a cry, Colonel Wragge disappeared up to\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\n“The tunnel!” cried the doctor, helping to drag him out, red,\r\nbreathless, and covered with sand and perspiration. “Now, let me lead\r\nthe way.” And he slipped down nimbly into the hole, so that a moment\r\nlater we heard his voice, muffled by sand and distance, rising up to us.\r\n\r\n“Hubbard, you come next, and then Colonel Wragge--if he wishes,” we\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n“I’ll follow you, of course,” he said, looking at me as I scrambled in.\r\n\r\nThe hole was bigger now, and I got down on all-fours in a channel not\r\nmuch bigger than a large sewer-pipe and found myself in total darkness.\r\nA minute later a heavy thud, followed by a cataract of loose sand,\r\nannounced the arrival of the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“Catch hold of my heel,” called Dr. Silence, “and Colonel Wragge can\r\ntake yours.”\r\n\r\nIn this slow, laborious fashion we wormed our way along a tunnel\r\nthat had been roughly dug out of the shifting sand, and was shored up\r\nclumsily by means of wooden pillars and posts. Any moment, it seemed to\r\nme, we might be buried alive. We could not see an inch before our eyes,\r\nbut had to grope our way feeling the pillars and the walls. It was\r\ndifficult to breathe, and the Colonel behind me made but slow progress,\r\nfor the cramped position of our bodies was very severe.\r\n\r\nWe had travelled in this way for ten minutes, and gone perhaps as much\r\nas ten yards, when I lost my grasp of the doctor’s heel.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” I heard his voice, sounding above me somewhere. He was standing\r\nup in a clear space, and the next moment I was standing beside him.\r\nColonel Wragge came heavily after, and he too rose up and stood. Then\r\nDr. Silence produced his candles and we heard preparations for striking\r\nmatches.\r\n\r\nYet even before there was light, an indefinable sensation of awe came\r\nover us all. In this hole in the sand, some three feet under ground,\r\nwe stood side by side, cramped and huddled, struck suddenly with an\r\noverwhelming apprehension of something ancient, something formidable,\r\nsomething incalculably wonderful, that touched in each one of us a\r\nsense of the sublime and the terrible even before we could see an inch\r\nbefore our faces. I know not how to express in language this singular\r\nemotion that caught us here in utter darkness, touching no sense\r\ndirectly, it seemed, yet with the recognition that before us in the\r\nblackness of this underground night there lay something that was mighty\r\nwith the mightiness of long past ages.\r\n\r\nI felt Colonel Wragge press in closely to my side, and I understood the\r\npressure and welcomed it. No human touch, to me at least, has ever been\r\nmore eloquent.\r\n\r\nThen the match flared, a thousand shadows fled on black wings, and I\r\nsaw John Silence fumbling with the candle, his face lit up grotesquely\r\nby the flickering light below it.\r\n\r\nI had dreaded this light, yet when it came there was apparently nothing\r\nto explain the profound sensations of dread that preceded it. We stood\r\nin a small vaulted chamber in the sand, the sides and roof shored with\r\nbars of wood, and the ground laid roughly with what seemed to be tiles.\r\nIt was six feet high, so that we could all stand comfortably, and may\r\nhave been ten feet long by eight feet wide. Upon the wooden pillars at\r\nthe side I saw that Egyptian hieroglyphics had been rudely traced by\r\nburning.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence lit three candles and handed one to each of us. He placed a\r\nfourth in the sand against the wall on his right, and another to mark\r\nthe entrance to the tunnel. We stood and stared about us, instinctively\r\nholding our breath.\r\n\r\n“Empty, by God!” exclaimed Colonel Wragge. His voice trembled with\r\nexcitement. And then, as his eyes rested on the ground, he added, “And\r\nfootsteps--look--footsteps in the sand!”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence said nothing. He stooped down and began to make a search\r\nof the chamber, and as he moved, my eyes followed his crouching figure\r\nand noted the queer distorted shadows that poured over the walls and\r\nceiling after him. Here and there thin trickles of loose sand ran\r\nfizzing down the sides. The atmosphere, heavily charged with faint yet\r\npungent odours, lay utterly still, and the flames of the candles might\r\nhave been painted on the air for all the movement they betrayed.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I watched, it was almost necessary to persuade myself forcibly\r\nthat I was only standing upright with difficulty in this little\r\nsand-hole of a modern garden in the south of England, for it seemed to\r\nme that I stood, as in vision, at the entrance of some vast rock-hewn\r\nTemple far, far down the river of Time. The illusion was powerful,\r\nand persisted. Granite columns, that rose to heaven, piled themselves\r\nabout me, majestically uprearing, and a roof like the sky itself spread\r\nabove a line of colossal figures that moved in shadowy procession along\r\nendless and stupendous aisles. This huge and splendid fantasy, borne I\r\nknew not whence, possessed me so vividly that I was actually obliged to\r\nconcentrate my attention upon the small stooping figure of the doctor,\r\nas he groped about the walls, in order to keep the eye of imagination\r\non the scene before me.\r\n\r\nBut the limited space rendered a long search out of the question, and\r\nhis footsteps, instead of shuffling through loose sand, presently\r\nstruck something of a different quality that gave forth a hollow and\r\nresounding echo. He stooped to examine more closely.\r\n\r\nHe was standing exactly in the centre of the little chamber when this\r\nhappened, and he at once began scraping away the sand with his feet. In\r\nless than a minute a smooth surface became visible--the surface of a\r\nwooden covering. The next thing I saw was that he had raised it and was\r\npeering down into a space below. Instantly, a strong odour of nitre\r\nand bitumen, mingled with the strange perfume of unknown and powdered\r\naromatics, rose up from the uncovered space and filled the vault,\r\nstinging the throat and making the eyes water and smart.\r\n\r\n“The mummy!” whispered Dr. Silence, looking up into our faces over his\r\ncandle; and as he said the word I felt the soldier lurch against me,\r\nand heard his breathing in my very ear.\r\n\r\n“The mummy!” he repeated under his breath, as we pressed forward to\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say exactly why the sight should have stirred in\r\nme so prodigious an emotion of wonder and veneration, for I have had\r\nnot a little to do with mummies, have unwound scores of them, and even\r\nexperimented magically with not a few. But there was something in the\r\nsight of that grey and silent figure, lying in its modern box of lead\r\nand wood at the bottom of this sandy grave, swathed in the bandages of\r\ncenturies and wrapped in the perfumed linen that the priests of Egypt\r\nhad prayed over with their mighty enchantments thousands of years\r\nbefore--something in the sight of it lying there and breathing its own\r\nspice-laden atmosphere even in the darkness of its exile in this remote\r\nland, something that pierced to the very core of my being and touched\r\nthat root of awe which slumbers in every man near the birth of tears\r\nand the passion of true worship.\r\n\r\nI remember turning quickly from the Colonel, lest he should see my\r\nemotion, yet fail to understand its cause, turn and clutch John Silence\r\nby the arm, and then fall trembling to see that he, too, had lowered\r\nhis head and was hiding his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nA kind of whirling storm came over me, rising out of I know not what\r\nutter deeps of memory, and in a whiteness of vision I heard the magical\r\nold chauntings from the Book of the Dead, and saw the Gods pass by in\r\ndim procession, the mighty, immemorial Beings who were yet themselves\r\nonly the personified attributes of the true Gods, the God with the\r\nEyes of Fire, the God with the Face of Smoke. I saw again Anubis, the\r\ndog-faced deity, and the children of Horus, eternal watcher of the\r\nages, as they swathed Osiris, the first mummy of the world, in the\r\nscented and mystic bands, and I tasted again something of the ecstasy\r\nof the justified soul as it embarked in the golden Boat of Ra, and\r\njourneyed onwards to rest in the fields of the blessed.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as Dr. Silence, with infinite reverence, stooped and touched\r\nthe still face, so dreadfully staring with its painted eyes, there rose\r\nagain to our nostrils wave upon wave of this perfume of thousands of\r\nyears, and time fled backwards like a thing of naught, showing me in\r\nhaunted panorama the most wonderful dream of the whole world.\r\n\r\nA gentle hissing became audible in the air, and the doctor moved\r\nquickly backwards. It came close to our faces and then seemed to play\r\nabout the walls and ceiling.\r\n\r\n“The last of the Fire--still waiting for its full accomplishment,” he\r\nmuttered; but I heard both words and hissing as things far away, for I\r\nwas still busy with the journey of the soul through the Seven Halls of\r\nDeath, listening for echoes of the grandest ritual ever known to men.\r\n\r\nThe earthen plates covered with hieroglyphics still lay beside the\r\nmummy, and round it, carefully arranged at the points of the compass,\r\nstood the four jars with the heads of the hawk, the jackal, the\r\ncynocephalus, and man, the jars in which were placed the hair, the nail\r\nparings, the heart, and other special portions of the body. Even the\r\namulets, the mirror, the blue clay statues of the Ka, and the lamp with\r\nseven wicks were there. Only the sacred scarabæus was missing.\r\n\r\n“Not only has it been torn from its ancient resting-place,” I heard Dr.\r\nSilence saying in a solemn voice as he looked at Colonel Wragge with\r\nfixed gaze, “but it has been partially unwound,”--he pointed to the\r\nwrappings of the breast,--“and--the scarabæus has been removed from the\r\nthroat.”\r\n\r\nThe hissing, that was like the hissing of an invisible flame, had\r\nceased; only from time to time we heard it as though it passed\r\nbackwards and forwards in the tunnel; and we stood looking into each\r\nother’s faces without speaking.\r\n\r\nPresently Colonel Wragge made a great effort and braced himself. I\r\nheard the sound catch in his throat before the words actually became\r\naudible.\r\n\r\n“My sister,” he said, very low. And then there followed a long pause,\r\nbroken at length by John Silence.\r\n\r\n“It must be replaced,” he said significantly.\r\n\r\n“I knew nothing,” the soldier said, forcing himself to speak the words\r\nhe hated saying. “Absolutely nothing.”\r\n\r\n“It must be returned,” repeated the other, “if it is not now too late.\r\nFor I fear--I fear----”\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge made a movement of assent with his head.\r\n\r\n“It shall be,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe place was still as the grave.\r\n\r\nI do not know what it was then that made us all three turn round with\r\nso sudden a start, for there was no sound audible to my ears, at least.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was on the point of replacing the lid over the mummy, when\r\nhe straightened up as if he had been shot.\r\n\r\n“There’s something coming,” said Colonel Wragge under his breath, and\r\nthe doctor’s eyes, peering down the small opening of the tunnel, showed\r\nme the true direction.\r\n\r\nA distant shuffling noise became distinctly audible coming from a point\r\nabout half-way down the tunnel we had so laboriously penetrated.\r\n\r\n“It’s the sand falling in,” I said, though I knew it was foolish.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the Colonel calmly, in a voice that seemed to have the ring\r\nof iron, “I’ve heard it for some time past. It is something alive--and\r\nit is coming nearer.”\r\n\r\nHe stared about him with a look of resolution that made his face almost\r\nnoble. The horror in his heart was overmastering, yet he stood there\r\nprepared for anything that might come.\r\n\r\n“There’s no other way out,” John Silence said.\r\n\r\nHe leaned the lid against the sand, and waited. I knew by the mask-like\r\nexpression of his face, the pallor, and the steadiness of the eyes,\r\nthat he anticipated something that might be very terrible--appalling.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel and myself stood on either side of the opening. I still\r\nheld my candle and was ashamed of the way it shook, dripping the\r\ngrease all over me; but the soldier had set his into the sand just\r\nbehind his feet.\r\n\r\nThoughts of being buried alive, of being smothered like rats in a trap,\r\nof being caught and done to death by some invisible and merciless force\r\nwe could not grapple with, rushed into my mind. Then I thought of\r\nfire--of suffocation--of being roasted alive. The perspiration began to\r\npour from my face.\r\n\r\n“Steady!” came the voice of Dr. Silence to me through the vault.\r\n\r\nFor five minutes, that seemed fifty, we stood waiting, looking from\r\neach other’s faces to the mummy, and from the mummy to the hole, and\r\nall the time the shuffling sound, soft and stealthy, came gradually\r\nnearer. The tension, for me at least, was very near the breaking point\r\nwhen at last the cause of the disturbance reached the edge. It was\r\nhidden for a moment just behind the broken rim of soil. A jet of sand,\r\nshaken by the close vibration, trickled down on to the ground; I have\r\nnever in my life seen anything fall with such laborious leisure. The\r\nnext second, uttering a cry of curious quality, it came into view.\r\n\r\nAnd it was far more distressingly horrible than anything I had\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nFor the sight of some Egyptian monster, some god of the tombs, or\r\neven of some demon of fire, I think I was already half prepared; but\r\nwhen, instead, I saw the white visage of Miss Wragge framed in that\r\nround opening of sand, followed by her body crawling on all-fours, her\r\neyes bulging and reflecting the yellow glare of the candles, my first\r\ninstinct was to turn and run like a frantic animal seeking a way of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Silence, who seemed no whit surprised, caught my arm and\r\nsteadied me, and we both saw the Colonel then drop upon his knees and\r\ncome thus to a level with his sister. For more than a whole minute, as\r\nthough struck in stone, the two faces gazed silently at each other:\r\nher’s, for all the dreadful emotion in it, more like a gargoyle than\r\nanything human; and his, white and blank with an expression that was\r\nbeyond either astonishment or alarm. She looked up; he looked down. It\r\nwas a picture in a nightmare, and the candle, stuck in the sand close\r\nto the hole, threw upon it the glare of impromptu footlights.\r\n\r\nThen John Silence moved forward and spoke in a voice that was very low,\r\nyet perfectly calm and natural.\r\n\r\n“I am glad you have come,” he said. “You are the one person whose\r\npresence at this moment is most required. And I hope that you may yet\r\nbe in time to appease the anger of the Fire, and to bring peace again\r\nto your household, and,” he added lower still so that no one heard it\r\nbut myself, “_safety to yourself_.”\r\n\r\nAnd while her brother stumbled backwards, crushing a candle into the\r\nsand in his awkwardness, the old lady crawled farther into the vaulted\r\nchamber and slowly rose upon her feet.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the wrapped figure of the mummy I was fully prepared\r\nto see her scream and faint, but on the contrary, to my complete\r\namazement, she merely bowed her head and dropped quietly upon her\r\nknees. Then, after a pause of more than a minute, she raised her eyes\r\nto the roof and her lips began to mutter as in prayer. Her right hand,\r\nmeanwhile, which had been fumbling for some time at her throat,\r\nsuddenly came away, and before the gaze of all of us she held it out,\r\npalm upwards, over the grey and ancient figure outstretched below. And\r\nin it we beheld glistening the green jasper of the stolen scarabæus.\r\n\r\nHer brother, leaning heavily against the wall behind, uttered a sound\r\nthat was half cry, half exclamation, but John Silence, standing\r\ndirectly in front of her, merely fixed his eyes on her and pointed\r\ndownwards to the staring face below.\r\n\r\n“Replace it,” he said sternly, “where it belongs.”\r\n\r\nMiss Wragge was kneeling at the feet of the mummy when this happened.\r\nWe three men all had our eyes riveted on what followed. Only the reader\r\nwho by some remote chance may have witnessed a line of mummies, freshly\r\nlaid from their tombs upon the sand, slowly stir and bend as the heat\r\nof the Egyptian sun warms their ancient bodies into the semblance of\r\nlife, can form any conception of the ultimate horror we experienced\r\nwhen the silent figure before us moved in its grave of lead and sand.\r\nSlowly, before our eyes, it writhed, and, with a faint rustling of the\r\nimmemorial cerements, rose up, and, through sightless and bandaged\r\neyes, stared across the yellow candle-light at the woman who had\r\nviolated it.\r\n\r\nI tried to move--her brother tried to move--but the sand seemed to hold\r\nour feet. I tried to cry--her brother tried to cry--but the sand seemed\r\nto fill our lungs and throat. We could only stare--and, even so, the\r\nsand seemed to rise like a desert storm and cloud our vision....\r\n\r\nAnd when I managed at length to open my eyes again, the mummy was lying\r\nonce more upon its back, motionless, the shrunken and painted face\r\nupturned towards the ceiling, and the old lady had tumbled forward and\r\nwas lying in the semblance of death with her head and arms upon its\r\ncrumbling body.\r\n\r\nBut upon the wrappings of the throat I saw the green jasper of the\r\nsacred scarabæus shining again like a living eye.\r\n\r\nColonel Wragge and the doctor recovered themselves long before I did,\r\nand I found myself helping them clumsily and unintelligently to raise\r\nthe frail body of the old lady, while John Silence carefully replaced\r\nthe covering over the grave and scraped back the sand with his foot,\r\nwhile he issued brief directions.\r\n\r\nI heard his voice as in a dream; but the journey back along that\r\ncramped tunnel, weighted by a dead woman, blinded with sand, suffocated\r\nwith heat, was in no sense a dream. It took us the best part of half\r\nan hour to reach the open air. And, even then, we had to wait a\r\nconsiderable time for the appearance of Dr. Silence. We carried her\r\nundiscovered into the house and up to her own room.\r\n\r\n“The mummy will cause no further disturbance,” I heard Dr. Silence say\r\nto our host later that evening as we prepared to drive for the night\r\ntrain, “provided always,” he added significantly, “that you, and yours,\r\ncause _it_ no disturbance.”\r\n\r\nIt was in a dream, too, that we left.\r\n\r\n“You did not see her face, I know,” he said to me as we wrapped our\r\nrugs about us in the empty compartment. And when I shook my head, quite\r\nunable to explain the instinct that had come to me not to look, he\r\nturned towards me, his face pale, and genuinely sad.\r\n\r\n“Scorched and blasted,” he whispered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE IV\r\n\r\nSECRET WORSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nHarris, the silk merchant, was in South Germany on his way home from\r\na business trip when the idea came to him suddenly that he would take\r\nthe mountain railway from Strassbourg and run down to revisit his old\r\nschool after an interval of something more than thirty years. And it\r\nwas to this chance impulse of the junior partner in Harris Brothers of\r\nSt. Paul’s Churchyard that John Silence owed one of the most curious\r\ncases of his whole experience, for at that very moment he happened to\r\nbe tramping these same mountains with a holiday knapsack, and from\r\ndifferent points of the compass the two men were actually converging\r\ntowards the same inn.\r\n\r\nNow, deep down in the heart that for thirty years had been concerned\r\nchiefly with the profitable buying and selling of silk, this school had\r\nleft the imprint of its peculiar influence, and, though perhaps unknown\r\nto Harris, had strongly coloured the whole of his subsequent existence.\r\nIt belonged to the deeply religious life of a small Protestant\r\ncommunity (which it is unnecessary to specify), and his father had\r\nsent him there at the age of fifteen, partly because he would learn\r\nthe German requisite for the conduct of the silk business, and partly\r\nbecause the discipline was strict, and discipline was what his soul and\r\nbody needed just then more than anything else.\r\n\r\nThe life, indeed, had proved exceedingly severe, and young Harris\r\nbenefited accordingly; for though corporal punishment was unknown,\r\nthere was a system of mental and spiritual correction which somehow\r\nmade the soul stand proudly erect to receive it, while it struck at the\r\nvery root of the fault and taught the boy that his character was being\r\ncleaned and strengthened, and that he was not merely being tortured in\r\na kind of personal revenge.\r\n\r\nThat was over thirty years ago, when he was a dreamy and impressionable\r\nyouth of fifteen; and now, as the train climbed slowly up the winding\r\nmountain gorges, his mind travelled back somewhat lovingly over the\r\nintervening period, and forgotten details rose vividly again before him\r\nout of the shadows. The life there had been very wonderful, it seemed\r\nto him, in that remote mountain village, protected from the tumults\r\nof the world by the love and worship of the devout Brotherhood that\r\nministered to the needs of some hundred boys from every country in\r\nEurope. Sharply the scenes came back to him. He smelt again the long\r\nstone corridors, the hot pinewood rooms, where the sultry hours of\r\nsummer study were passed with bees droning through open windows in the\r\nsunshine, and German characters struggling in the mind with dreams of\r\nEnglish lawns--and then the sudden awful cry of the master in German--\r\n\r\n“Harris, stand up! You sleep!”\r\n\r\nAnd he recalled the dreadful standing motionless for an hour, book in\r\nhand, while the knees felt like wax and the head grew heavier than a\r\ncannon-ball.\r\n\r\nThe very smell of the cooking came back to him--the daily _Sauerkraut_,\r\nthe watery chocolate on Sundays, the flavour of the stringy meat\r\nserved twice a week at _Mittagessen_; and he smiled to think again of\r\nthe half-rations that was the punishment for speaking English. The\r\nvery odour of the milk-bowls,--the hot sweet aroma that rose from the\r\nsoaking peasant-bread at the six-o’clock breakfast,--came back to him\r\npungently, and he saw the huge _Speisesaal_ with the hundred boys in\r\ntheir school uniform, all eating sleepily in silence, gulping down\r\nthe coarse bread and scalding milk in terror of the bell that would\r\npresently cut them short--and, at the far end where the masters sat,\r\nhe saw the narrow slit windows with the vistas of enticing field and\r\nforest beyond.\r\n\r\nAnd this, in turn, made him think of the great barn-like room on the\r\ntop floor where all slept together in wooden cots, and he heard in\r\nmemory the clamour of the cruel bell that woke them on winter mornings\r\nat five o’clock and summoned them to the stone-flagged _Waschkammer_,\r\nwhere boys and masters alike, after scanty and icy washing, dressed in\r\ncomplete silence.\r\n\r\nFrom this his mind passed swiftly, with vivid picture-thoughts,\r\nto other things, and with a passing shiver he remembered how\r\nthe loneliness of never being alone had eaten into him, and how\r\neverything--work, meals, sleep, walks, leisure--was done with his\r\n“division” of twenty other boys and under the eyes of at least two\r\nmasters. The only solitude possible was by asking for half an hour’s\r\npractice in the cell-like music rooms, and Harris smiled to himself as\r\nhe recalled the zeal of his violin studies.\r\n\r\nThen, as the train puffed laboriously through the great pine forests\r\nthat cover these mountains with a giant carpet of velvet, he found the\r\npleasanter layers of memory giving up their dead, and he recalled with\r\nadmiration the kindness of the masters, whom all addressed as Brother,\r\nand marvelled afresh at their devotion in burying themselves for years\r\nin such a place, only to leave it, in most cases, for the still rougher\r\nlife of missionaries in the wild places of the world.\r\n\r\nHe thought once more of the still, religious atmosphere that hung\r\nover the little forest community like a veil, barring the distressful\r\nworld; of the picturesque ceremonies at Easter, Christmas, and New\r\nYear; of the numerous feast-days and charming little festivals. The\r\n_Beschehr-Fest_, in particular, came back to him,--the feast of gifts\r\nat Christmas,--when the entire community paired off and gave presents,\r\nmany of which had taken weeks to make or the savings of many days to\r\npurchase. And then he saw the midnight ceremony in the church at New\r\nYear, with the shining face of the _Prediger_ in the pulpit,--the\r\nvillage preacher who, on the last night of the old year, saw in the\r\nempty gallery beyond the organ loft the faces of all who were to die\r\nin the ensuing twelve months, and who at last recognised himself among\r\nthem, and, in the very middle of his sermon, passed into a state of\r\nrapt ecstasy and burst into a torrent of praise.\r\n\r\nThickly the memories crowded upon him. The picture of the small village\r\ndreaming its unselfish life on the mountain-tops, clean, wholesome,\r\nsimple, searching vigorously for its God, and training hundreds of\r\nboys in the grand way, rose up in his mind with all the power of an\r\nobsession. He felt once more the old mystical enthusiasm, deeper than\r\nthe sea and more wonderful than the stars; he heard again the winds\r\nsighing from leagues of forest over the red roofs in the moonlight; he\r\nheard the Brothers’ voices talking of the things beyond this life as\r\nthough they had actually experienced them in the body; and, as he sat\r\nin the jolting train, a spirit of unutterable longing passed over his\r\nseared and tired soul, stirring in the depths of him a sea of emotions\r\nthat he thought had long since frozen into immobility.\r\n\r\nAnd the contrast pained him,--the idealistic dreamer then, the man of\r\nbusiness now,--so that a spirit of unworldly peace and beauty known\r\nonly to the soul in meditation laid its feathered finger upon his\r\nheart, moving strangely the surface of the waters.\r\n\r\nHarris shivered a little and looked out of the window of his empty\r\ncarriage. The train had long passed Hornberg, and far below the streams\r\ntumbled in white foam down the limestone rocks. In front of him, dome\r\nupon dome of wooded mountain stood against the sky. It was October,\r\nand the air was cool and sharp, wood-smoke and damp moss exquisitely\r\nmingled in it with the subtle odours of the pines. Overhead, between\r\nthe tips of the highest firs, he saw the first stars peeping, and the\r\nsky was a clean, pale amethyst that seemed exactly the colour all these\r\nmemories clothed themselves with in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his corner and sighed. He was a heavy man, and he had\r\nnot known sentiment for years; he was a big man, and it took much to\r\nmove him, literally and figuratively; he was a man in whom the dreams\r\nof God that haunt the soul in youth, though overlaid by the scum that\r\ngathers in the fight for money, had not, as with the majority, utterly\r\ndied the death.\r\n\r\nHe came back into this little neglected pocket of the years, where\r\nso much fine gold had collected and lain undisturbed, with all his\r\nsemi-spiritual emotions aquiver; and, as he watched the mountain-tops\r\ncome nearer, and smelt the forgotten odours of his boyhood, something\r\nmelted on the surface of his soul and left him sensitive to a degree he\r\nhad not known since, thirty years before, he had lived here with his\r\ndreams, his conflicts, and his youthful suffering.\r\n\r\nA thrill ran through him as the train stopped with a jolt at a tiny\r\nstation and he saw the name in large black lettering on the grey stone\r\nbuilding, and below it, the number of metres it stood above the level\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\n“The highest point on the line!” he exclaimed. “How well I remember\r\nit--Sommerau--Summer Meadow. The very next station is mine!”\r\n\r\nAnd, as the train ran downhill with brakes on and steam shut off, he\r\nput his head out of the window and one by one saw the old familiar\r\nlandmarks in the dusk. They stared at him like dead faces in a dream.\r\nQueer, sharp feelings, half poignant, half sweet, stirred in his heart.\r\n\r\n“There’s the hot, white road we walked along so often with the two\r\nBrüder always at our heels,” he thought; “and there, by Jove, is the\r\nturn through the forest to ‘_Die Galgen_,’ the stone gallows where they\r\nhanged the witches in olden days!”\r\n\r\nHe smiled a little as the train slid past.\r\n\r\n“And there’s the copse where the Lilies of the Valley powdered the\r\nground in spring; and, I swear,”--he put his head out with a sudden\r\nimpulse,--“if that’s not the very clearing where Calame, the French\r\nboy, chased the swallow-tail with me, and Bruder Pagel gave us\r\nhalf-rations for leaving the road without permission, and for shouting\r\nin our mother tongues!” And he laughed again as the memories came back\r\nwith a rush, flooding his mind with vivid detail.\r\n\r\nThe train stopped, and he stood on the grey gravel platform like a man\r\nin a dream. It seemed half a century since he last waited there with\r\ncorded wooden boxes, and got into the train for Strassbourg and home\r\nafter the two years’ exile. Time dropped from him like an old garment\r\nand he felt a boy again. Only, things looked so much smaller than his\r\nmemory of them; shrunk and dwindled they looked, and the distances\r\nseemed on a curiously smaller scale.\r\n\r\nHe made his way across the road to the little Gasthaus, and, as he\r\nwent, faces and figures of former schoolfellows,--German, Swiss,\r\nItalian, French, Russian,--slipped out of the shadowy woods and\r\nsilently accompanied him. They flitted by his side, raising their eyes\r\nquestioningly, sadly, to his. But their names he had forgotten. Some\r\nof the Brothers, too, came with them, and most of these he remembered\r\nby name--Bruder Röst, Bruder Pagel, Bruder Schliemann, and the bearded\r\nface of the old preacher who had seen himself in the haunted gallery\r\nof those about to die--Bruder Gysin. The dark forest lay all about\r\nhim like a sea that any moment might rush with velvet waves upon the\r\nscene and sweep all the faces away. The air was cool and wonderfully\r\nfragrant, but with every perfumed breath came also a pallid memory....\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of the underlying sadness inseparable from such an\r\nexperience, it was all very interesting, and held a pleasure peculiarly\r\nits own, so that Harris engaged his room and ordered supper feeling\r\nwell pleased with himself, and intending to walk up to the old school\r\nthat very evening. It stood in the centre of the community’s village,\r\nsome four miles distant through the forest, and he now recollected for\r\nthe first time that this little Protestant settlement dwelt isolated\r\nin a section of the country that was otherwise Catholic. Crucifixes\r\nand shrines surrounded the clearing like the sentries of a beleaguring\r\narmy. Once beyond the square of the village, with its few acres of\r\nfield and orchard, the forest crowded up in solid phalanxes, and beyond\r\nthe rim of trees began the country that was ruled by the priests of\r\nanother faith. He vaguely remembered, too, that the Catholics had\r\nshowed sometimes a certain hostility towards the little Protestant\r\noasis that flourished so quietly and benignly in their midst. He had\r\nquite forgotten this. How trumpery it all seemed now with his wide\r\nexperience of life and his knowledge of other countries and the great\r\noutside world. It was like stepping back, not thirty years, but three\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nThere were only two others besides himself at supper. One of them, a\r\nbearded, middle-aged man in tweeds, sat by himself at the far end,\r\nand Harris kept out of his way because he was English. He feared he\r\nmight be in business, possibly even in the silk business, and that\r\nhe would perhaps talk on the subject. The other traveller, however,\r\nwas a Catholic priest. He was a little man who ate his salad with a\r\nknife, yet so gently that it was almost inoffensive, and it was the\r\nsight of “the cloth” that recalled his memory of the old antagonism.\r\nHarris mentioned by way of conversation the object of his sentimental\r\njourney, and the priest looked up sharply at him with raised eyebrows\r\nand an expression of surprise and suspicion that somehow piqued him. He\r\nascribed it to his difference of belief.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” went on the silk merchant, pleased to talk of what his mind was\r\nso full, “and it was a curious experience for an English boy to be\r\ndropped down into a school of a hundred foreigners. I well remember the\r\nloneliness and intolerable Heimweh of it at first.” His German was very\r\nfluent.\r\n\r\nThe priest opposite looked up from his cold veal and potato salad and\r\nsmiled. It was a nice face. He explained quietly that he did not belong\r\nhere, but was making a tour of the parishes of Württemberg and Baden.\r\n\r\n“It was a strict life,” added Harris. “We English, I remember, used to\r\ncall it _Gefängnisleben_--prison life!”\r\n\r\nThe face of the other, for some unaccountable reason, darkened. After a\r\nslight pause, and more by way of politeness than because he wished to\r\ncontinue the subject, he said quietly--\r\n\r\n“It was a flourishing school in those days, of course. Afterwards,\r\nI have heard----” He shrugged his shoulders slightly, and the odd\r\nlook--it almost seemed a look of alarm--came back into his eyes. The\r\nsentence remained unfinished.\r\n\r\nSomething in the tone of the man seemed to his listener uncalled\r\nfor--in a sense reproachful, singular. Harris bridled in spite of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“It has changed?” he asked. “I can hardly believe----”\r\n\r\n“You have not heard, then?” observed the priest gently, making a\r\ngesture as though to cross himself, yet not actually completing it.\r\n“You have not heard what happened there before it was abandoned----?”\r\n\r\nIt was very childish, of course, and perhaps he was overtired and\r\noverwrought in some way, but the words and manner of the little priest\r\nseemed to him so offensive--so disproportionately offensive--that he\r\nhardly noticed the concluding sentence. He recalled the old bitterness\r\nand the old antagonism, and for a moment he almost lost his temper.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” he interrupted with a forced laugh, “_Unsinn!_ You must\r\nforgive me, sir, for contradicting you. But I was a pupil there\r\nmyself. I was at school there. There was no place like it. I cannot\r\nbelieve that anything serious could have happened to--to take away its\r\ncharacter. The devotion of the Brothers would be difficult to equal\r\nanywhere----”\r\n\r\nHe broke off suddenly, realising that his voice had been raised unduly\r\nand that the man at the far end of the table might understand German;\r\nand at the same moment he looked up and saw that this individual’s\r\neyes were fixed upon his face intently. They were peculiarly bright.\r\nAlso they were rather wonderful eyes, and the way they met his own\r\nserved in some way he could not understand to convey both a reproach\r\nand a warning. The whole face of the stranger, indeed, made a vivid\r\nimpression upon him, for it was a face, he now noticed for the first\r\ntime, in whose presence one would not willingly have said or done\r\nanything unworthy. Harris could not explain to himself how it was he\r\nhad not become conscious sooner of its presence.\r\n\r\nBut he could have bitten off his tongue for having so far forgotten\r\nhimself. The little priest lapsed into silence. Only once he said,\r\nlooking up and speaking in a low voice that was not intended to be\r\noverheard, but that evidently _was_ overheard, “You will find it\r\ndifferent.” Presently he rose and left the table with a polite bow that\r\nincluded both the others.\r\n\r\nAnd, after him, from the far end rose also the figure in the tweed\r\nsuit, leaving Harris by himself.\r\n\r\nHe sat on for a bit in the darkening room, sipping his coffee and\r\nsmoking his fifteen-pfennig cigar, till the girl came in to light the\r\noil lamps. He felt vexed with himself for his lapse from good manners,\r\nyet hardly able to account for it. Most likely, he reflected, he\r\nhad been annoyed because the priest had unintentionally changed the\r\npleasant character of his dream by introducing a jarring note. Later he\r\nmust seek an opportunity to make amends. At present, however, he was\r\ntoo impatient for his walk to the school, and he took his stick and hat\r\nand passed out into the open air.\r\n\r\nAnd, as he crossed before the Gasthaus, he noticed that the priest\r\nand the man in the tweed suit were engaged already in such deep\r\nconversation that they hardly noticed him as he passed and raised his\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nHe started off briskly, well remembering the way, and hoping to reach\r\nthe village in time to have a word with one of the Brüder. They might\r\neven ask him in for a cup of coffee. He felt sure of his welcome, and\r\nthe old memories were in full possession once more. The hour of return\r\nwas a matter of no consequence whatever.\r\n\r\nIt was then just after seven o’clock, and the October evening was\r\ndrawing in with chill airs from the recesses of the forest. The road\r\nplunged straight from the railway clearing into its depths, and in a\r\nvery few minutes the trees engulfed him and the clack of his boots\r\nfell dead and echoless against the serried stems of a million firs. It\r\nwas very black; one trunk was hardly distinguishable from another. He\r\nwalked smartly, swinging his holly stick. Once or twice he passed a\r\npeasant on his way to bed, and the guttural “Gruss Got,” unheard for\r\nso long, emphasised the passage of time, while yet making it seem as\r\nnothing. A fresh group of pictures crowded his mind. Again the figures\r\nof former schoolfellows flitted out of the forest and kept pace by his\r\nside, whispering of the doings of long ago. One reverie stepped hard\r\nupon the heels of another. Every turn in the road, every clearing of\r\nthe forest, he knew, and each in turn brought forgotten associations to\r\nlife. He enjoyed himself thoroughly.\r\n\r\nHe marched on and on. There was powdered gold in the sky till the moon\r\nrose, and then a wind of faint silver spread silently between the\r\nearth and stars. He saw the tips of the fir trees shimmer, and heard\r\nthem whisper as the breeze turned their needles towards the light. The\r\nmountain air was indescribably sweet. The road shone like the foam of a\r\nriver through the gloom. White moths flitted here and there like silent\r\nthoughts across his path, and a hundred smells greeted him from the\r\nforest caverns across the years.\r\n\r\nThen, when he least expected it, the trees fell away abruptly on both\r\nsides, and he stood on the edge of the village clearing.\r\n\r\nHe walked faster. There lay the familiar outlines of the houses,\r\nsheeted with silver; there stood the trees in the little central square\r\nwith the fountain and small green lawns; there loomed the shape of\r\nthe church next to the Gasthof der Brüdergemeinde; and just beyond,\r\ndimly rising into the sky, he saw with a sudden thrill the mass of\r\nthe huge school building, blocked castle-like with deep shadows in\r\nthe moonlight, standing square and formidable to face him after the\r\nsilences of more than a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nHe passed quickly down the deserted village street and stopped close\r\nbeneath its shadow, staring up at the walls that had once held\r\nhim prisoner for two years--two unbroken years of discipline and\r\nhomesickness. Memories and emotions surged through his mind; for the\r\nmost vivid sensations of his youth had focused about this spot, and\r\nit was here he had first begun to live and learn values. Not a single\r\nfootstep broke the silence, though lights glimmered here and there\r\nthrough cottage windows; but when he looked up at the high walls of\r\nthe school, draped now in shadow, he easily imagined that well-known\r\nfaces crowded to the windows to greet him--closed windows that really\r\nreflected only moonlight and the gleam of stars.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the old school building, standing foursquare to the\r\nworld, with its shuttered windows, its lofty, tiled roof, and the\r\nspiked lightning-conductors pointing like black and taloned fingers\r\nfrom the corners. For a long time he stood and stared. Then,\r\npresently, he came to himself again, and realised to his joy that a\r\nlight still shone in the windows of the _Bruderstube_.\r\n\r\nHe turned from the road and passed through the iron railings; then\r\nclimbed the twelve stone steps and stood facing the black wooden door\r\nwith the heavy bars of iron, a door he had once loathed and dreaded\r\nwith the hatred and passion of an imprisoned soul, but now looked upon\r\ntenderly with a sort of boyish delight.\r\n\r\nAlmost timorously he pulled the rope and listened with a tremor of\r\nexcitement to the clanging of the bell deep within the building. And\r\nthe long-forgotten sound brought the past before him with such a\r\nvivid sense of reality that he positively shivered. It was like the\r\nmagic bell in the fairy-tale that rolls back the curtain of Time and\r\nsummons the figures from the shadows of the dead. He had never felt so\r\nsentimental in his life. It was like being young again. And, at the\r\nsame time, he began to bulk rather large in his own eyes with a certain\r\nspurious importance. He was a big man from the world of strife and\r\naction. In this little place of peaceful dreams would he, perhaps, not\r\ncut something of a figure?\r\n\r\n“I’ll try once more,” he thought after a long pause, seizing the iron\r\nbell-rope, and was just about to pull it when a step sounded on the\r\nstone passage within, and the huge door slowly swung open.\r\n\r\nA tall man with a rather severe cast of countenance stood facing him in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“I must apologise--it is somewhat late,” he began a trifle pompously,\r\n“but the fact is I am an old pupil. I have only just arrived and really\r\ncould not restrain myself.” His German seemed not quite so fluent as\r\nusual. “My interest is so great. I was here in ’70.”\r\n\r\nThe other opened the door wider and at once bowed him in with a smile\r\nof genuine welcome.\r\n\r\n“I am Bruder Kalkmann,” he said quietly in a deep voice. “I myself was\r\na master here about that time. It is a great pleasure always to welcome\r\na former pupil.” He looked at him very keenly for a few seconds,\r\nand then added, “I think, too, it is splendid of you to come--very\r\nsplendid.”\r\n\r\n“It is a very great pleasure,” Harris replied, delighted with his\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nThe dimly-lighted corridor with its flooring of grey stone, and the\r\nfamiliar sound of a German voice echoing through it,--with the peculiar\r\nintonation the Brothers always used in speaking,--all combined to lift\r\nhim bodily, as it were, into the dream-atmosphere of long-forgotten\r\ndays. He stepped gladly into the building and the door shut with the\r\nfamiliar thunder that completed the reconstruction of the past. He\r\nalmost felt the old sense of imprisonment, of aching nostalgia, of\r\nhaving lost his liberty.\r\n\r\nHarris sighed involuntarily and turned towards his host, who returned\r\nhis smile faintly and then led the way down the corridor.\r\n\r\n“The boys have retired,” he explained, “and, as you remember, we keep\r\nearly hours here. But, at least, you will join us for a little while in\r\nthe _Bruderstube_ and enjoy a cup of coffee.” This was precisely what\r\nthe silk merchant had hoped, and he accepted with an alacrity that he\r\nintended to be tempered by graciousness. “And tomorrow,” continued the\r\nBruder, “you must come and spend a whole day with us. You may even find\r\nacquaintances, for several pupils of your day have come back here as\r\nmasters.”\r\n\r\nFor one brief second there passed into the man’s eyes a look that\r\nmade the visitor start. But it vanished as quickly as it came. It was\r\nimpossible to define. Harris convinced himself it was the effect of a\r\nshadow cast by the lamp they had just passed on the wall. He dismissed\r\nit from his mind.\r\n\r\n“You are very kind, I’m sure,” he said politely. “It is perhaps a\r\ngreater pleasure to me than you can imagine to see the place again.\r\nAh,”--he stopped short opposite a door with the upper half of glass\r\nand peered in--“surely there is one of the music rooms where I used to\r\npractise the violin. How it comes back to me after all these years!”\r\n\r\nBruder Kalkmann stopped indulgently, smiling, to allow his guest a\r\nmoment’s inspection.\r\n\r\n“You still have the boys’ orchestra? I remember I used to play ‘_zweite\r\nGeige_’ in it. Bruder Schliemann conducted at the piano. Dear me, I can\r\nsee him now with his long black hair and--and----” He stopped abruptly.\r\nAgain the odd, dark look passed over the stern face of his companion.\r\nFor an instant it seemed curiously familiar.\r\n\r\n“We still keep up the pupils’ orchestra,” he said, “but Bruder\r\nSchliemann, I am sorry to say----” he hesitated an instant, and then\r\nadded, “Bruder Schliemann is dead.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, indeed,” said Harris quickly. “I am sorry to hear it.” He was\r\nconscious of a faint feeling of distress, but whether it arose from\r\nthe news of his old music teacher’s death, or--from something else--he\r\ncould not quite determine. He gazed down the corridor that lost itself\r\namong shadows. In the street and village everything had seemed so\r\nmuch smaller than he remembered, but here, inside the school building,\r\neverything seemed so much bigger. The corridor was loftier and longer,\r\nmore spacious and vast, than the mental picture he had preserved. His\r\nthoughts wandered dreamily for an instant.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up and saw the face of the Bruder watching him with a smile\r\nof patient indulgence.\r\n\r\n“Your memories possess you,” he observed gently, and the stern look\r\npassed into something almost pitying.\r\n\r\n“You are right,” returned the man of silk, “they do. This was the most\r\nwonderful period of my whole life in a sense. At the time I hated\r\nit----” He hesitated, not wishing to hurt the Brother’s feelings.\r\n\r\n“According to English ideas it seemed strict, of course,” the other\r\nsaid persuasively, so that he went on.\r\n\r\n“----Yes, partly that; and partly the ceaseless nostalgia, and the\r\nsolitude which came from never being really alone. In English schools\r\nthe boys enjoy peculiar freedom, you know.”\r\n\r\nBruder Kalkmann, he saw, was listening intently.\r\n\r\n“But it produced one result that I have never wholly lost,” he\r\ncontinued self-consciously, “and am grateful for.”\r\n\r\n“_Ach! Wie so, denn?_”\r\n\r\n“The constant inner pain threw me headlong into your religious life, so\r\nthat the whole force of my being seemed to project itself towards the\r\nsearch for a deeper satisfaction--a real resting-place for the soul.\r\nDuring my two years here I yearned for God in my boyish way as perhaps\r\nI have never yearned for anything since. Moreover, I have never quite\r\nlost that sense of peace and inward joy which accompanied the search. I\r\ncan never quite forget this school and the deep things it taught me.”\r\n\r\nHe paused at the end of his long speech, and a brief silence fell\r\nbetween them. He feared he had said too much, or expressed himself\r\nclumsily in the foreign language, and when Bruder Kalkmann laid a hand\r\nupon his shoulder, he gave a little involuntary start.\r\n\r\n“So that my memories perhaps do possess me rather strongly,” he added\r\napologetically; “and this long corridor, these rooms, that barred and\r\ngloomy front door, all touch chords that--that----” His German failed\r\nhim and he glanced at his companion with an explanatory smile and\r\ngesture. But the brother had removed the hand from his shoulder and was\r\nstanding with his back to him, looking down the passage.\r\n\r\n“Naturally, naturally so,” he said hastily without turning round. “_Es\r\nist doch selbstverständlich._ We shall all understand.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned suddenly, and Harris saw that his face had turned most\r\noddly and disagreeably sinister. It may only have been the shadows\r\nagain playing their tricks with the wretched oil lamps on the wall,\r\nfor the dark expression passed instantly as they retraced their steps\r\ndown the corridor, but the Englishman somehow got the impression that\r\nhe had said something to give offence, something that was not quite to\r\nthe other’s taste. Opposite the door of the _Bruderstube_ they stopped.\r\nHarris realised that it was late and he had possibly stayed talking too\r\nlong. He made a tentative effort to leave, but his companion would not\r\nhear of it.\r\n\r\n“You must have a cup of coffee with us,” he said firmly as though he\r\nmeant it, “and my colleagues will be delighted to see you. Some of them\r\nwill remember you, perhaps.”\r\n\r\nThe sound of voices came pleasantly through the door, men’s voices\r\ntalking together. Bruder Kalkmann turned the handle and they entered a\r\nroom ablaze with light and full of people.\r\n\r\n“Ah,--but your name?” he whispered, bending down to catch the reply;\r\n“you have not told me your name yet.”\r\n\r\n“Harris,” said the Englishman quickly as they went in. He felt nervous\r\nas he crossed the threshold, but ascribed the momentary trepidation\r\nto the fact that he was breaking the strictest rule of the whole\r\nestablishment, which forbade a boy under severest penalties to come\r\nnear this holy of holies where the masters took their brief leisure.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, of course--Harris,” repeated the other as though he\r\nremembered it “Come in, Herr Harris, come in, please. Your visit will\r\nbe immensely appreciated. It is really very fine, very wonderful of you\r\nto have come in this way.”\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind them and, in the sudden light which made his\r\nsight swim for a moment, the exaggeration of the language escaped his\r\nattention. He heard the voice of Bruder Kalkmann introducing him. He\r\nspoke very loud, indeed, unnecessarily,--absurdly loud, Harris thought.\r\n\r\n“Brothers,” he announced, “it is my pleasure and privilege to introduce\r\nto you Herr Harris from England. He has just arrived to make us a\r\nlittle visit, and I have already expressed to him on behalf of us all\r\nthe satisfaction we feel that he is here. He was, as you remember, a\r\npupil in the year ’70.”\r\n\r\nIt was a very formal, a very German introduction, but Harris rather\r\nliked it. It made him feel important and he appreciated the tact that\r\nmade it almost seem as though he had been expected.\r\n\r\nThe black forms rose and bowed; Harris bowed; Kalkmann bowed. Every one\r\nwas very polite and very courtly. The room swam with moving figures;\r\nthe light dazzled him after the gloom of the corridor; there was thick\r\ncigar smoke in the atmosphere. He took the chair that was offered to\r\nhim between two of the Brothers, and sat down, feeling vaguely that his\r\nperceptions were not quite as keen and accurate as usual. He felt a\r\ntrifle dazed perhaps, and the spell of the past came strongly over him,\r\nconfusing the immediate present and making everything dwindle oddly to\r\nthe dimensions of long ago. He seemed to pass under the mastery of a\r\ngreat mood that was a composite reproduction of all the moods of his\r\nforgotten boyhood.\r\n\r\nThen he pulled himself together with a sharp effort and entered into\r\nthe conversation that had begun again to buzz round him. Moreover,\r\nhe entered into it with keen pleasure, for the Brothers--there were\r\nperhaps a dozen of them in the little room--treated him with a charm\r\nof manner that speedily made him feel one of themselves. This, again,\r\nwas a very subtle delight to him. He felt that he had stepped out\r\nof the greedy, vulgar, self-seeking world, the world of silk and\r\nmarkets and profit-making--stepped into the cleaner atmosphere where\r\nspiritual ideals were paramount and life was simple and devoted.\r\nIt all charmed him inexpressibly, so that he realised--yes, in a\r\nsense--the degradation of his twenty years’ absorption in business.\r\nThis keen atmosphere under the stars where men thought only of their\r\nsouls, and of the souls of others, was too rarefied for the world he\r\nwas now associated with. He found himself making comparisons to his\r\nown disadvantage,--comparisons with the mystical little dreamer that\r\nhad stepped thirty years before from the stern peace of this devout\r\ncommunity, and the man of the world that he had since become,--and\r\nthe contrast made him shiver with a keen regret and something like\r\nself-contempt.\r\n\r\nHe glanced round at the other faces floating towards him through\r\ntobacco smoke--this acrid cigar smoke he remembered so well: how keen\r\nthey were, how strong, placid, touched with the nobility of great aims\r\nand unselfish purposes. At one or two he looked particularly. He hardly\r\nknew why. They rather fascinated him. There was something so very stern\r\nand uncompromising about them, and something, too, oddly, subtly,\r\nfamiliar, that yet just eluded him. But whenever their eyes met his own\r\nthey held undeniable welcome in them; and some held more--a kind of\r\nperplexed admiration, he thought, something that was between esteem and\r\ndeference. This note of respect in all the faces was very flattering to\r\nhis vanity.\r\n\r\nCoffee was served presently, made by a black-haired Brother who sat\r\nin the corner by the piano and bore a marked resemblance to Bruder\r\nSchliemann, the musical director of thirty years ago. Harris exchanged\r\nbows with him when he took the cup from his white hands, which he\r\nnoticed were like the hands of a woman. He lit a cigar, offered to him\r\nby his neighbour, with whom he was chatting delightfully, and who, in\r\nthe glare of the lighted match, reminded him sharply for a moment of\r\nBruder Pagel, his former room-master.\r\n\r\n“_Es ist wirklich merkwürdig_,” he said, “how many resemblances I see,\r\nor imagine. It is really _very_ curious!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the other, peering at him over his coffee cup, “the\r\nspell of the place is wonderfully strong. I can well understand that\r\nthe old faces rise before your mind’s eye--almost to the exclusion of\r\nourselves perhaps.”\r\n\r\nThey both laughed pleasantly. It was soothing to find his mood\r\nunderstood and appreciated. And they passed on to talk of the mountain\r\nvillage, its isolation, its remoteness from worldly life, its peculiar\r\nfitness for meditation and worship, and for spiritual development--of a\r\ncertain kind.\r\n\r\n“And your coming back in this way, Herr Harris, has pleased us all so\r\nmuch,” joined in the Bruder on his left. “We esteem you for it most\r\nhighly. We honour you for it.”\r\n\r\nHarris made a deprecating gesture. “I fear, for my part, it is only a\r\nvery selfish pleasure,” he said a trifle unctuously.\r\n\r\n“Not all would have had the courage,” added the one who resembled\r\nBruder Pagel.\r\n\r\n“You mean,” said Harris, a little puzzled, “the disturbing\r\nmemories----?”\r\n\r\nBruder Pagel looked at him steadily, with unmistakable admiration and\r\nrespect. “I mean that most men hold so strongly to life, and can give\r\nup so little for their beliefs,” he said gravely.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman felt slightly uncomfortable. These worthy men really\r\nmade too much of his sentimental journey. Besides, the talk was getting\r\na little out of his depth. He hardly followed it.\r\n\r\n“The worldly life still has _some_ charms for me,” he replied\r\nsmilingly, as though to indicate that sainthood was not yet quite\r\nwithin his grasp.\r\n\r\n“All the more, then, must we honour you for so freely coming,” said the\r\nBrother on his left; “so unconditionally!”\r\n\r\nA pause followed, and the silk merchant felt relieved when the\r\nconversation took a more general turn, although he noted that it never\r\ntravelled very far from the subject of his visit and the wonderful\r\nsituation of the lonely village for men who wished to develop their\r\nspiritual powers and practise the rites of a high worship. Others\r\njoined in, complimenting him on his knowledge of the language,\r\nmaking him feel utterly at his ease, yet at the same time a little\r\nuncomfortable by the excess of their admiration. After all, it was such\r\na very small thing to do, this sentimental journey.\r\n\r\nThe time passed along quickly; the coffee was excellent, the cigars\r\nsoft and of the nutty flavour he loved. At length, fearing to outstay\r\nhis welcome, he rose reluctantly to take his leave. But the others\r\nwould not hear of it. It was not often a former pupil returned to visit\r\nthem in this simple, unaffected way. The night was young. If necessary\r\nthey could even find him a corner in the great _Schlafzimmer_ upstairs.\r\nHe was easily persuaded to stay a little longer. Somehow he had become\r\nthe centre of the little party. He felt pleased, flattered, honoured.\r\n\r\n“And perhaps Bruder Schliemann will play something for us--now.”\r\n\r\nIt was Kalkmann speaking, and Harris started visibly as he heard the\r\nname, and saw the black-haired man by the piano turn with a smile. For\r\nSchliemann was the name of his old music director, who was dead. Could\r\nthis be his son? They were so exactly alike.\r\n\r\n“If Bruder Meyer has not put his Amati to bed, I will accompany him,”\r\nsaid the musician suggestively, looking across at a man whom Harris had\r\nnot yet noticed, and who, he now saw, was the very image of a former\r\nmaster of that name.\r\n\r\nMeyer rose and excused himself with a little bow, and the Englishman\r\nquickly observed that he had a peculiar gesture as though his neck had\r\na false join on to the body just below the collar and feared it might\r\nbreak. Meyer of old had this trick of movement. He remembered how the\r\nboys used to copy it.\r\n\r\nHe glanced sharply from face to face, feeling as though some silent,\r\nunseen process were changing everything about him. All the faces seemed\r\noddly familiar. Pagel, the Brother he had been talking with, was of\r\ncourse the image of Pagel, his former room-master; and Kalkmann, he now\r\nrealised for the first time, was the very twin of another master whose\r\nname he had quite forgotten, but whom he used to dislike intensely in\r\nthe old days. And, through the smoke, peering at him from the corners\r\nof the room, he saw that all the Brothers about him had the faces he\r\nhad known and lived with long ago--Röst, Fluheim, Meinert, Rigel, Gysin.\r\n\r\nHe stared hard, suddenly grown more alert, and everywhere saw, or\r\nfancied he saw, strange likenesses, ghostly resemblances,--more, the\r\nidentical faces of years ago. There was something queer about it all,\r\nsomething not quite right, something that made him feel uneasy. He\r\nshook himself, mentally and actually, blowing the smoke from before his\r\neyes with a long breath, and as he did so he noticed to his dismay that\r\nevery one was fixedly staring. They were watching him.\r\n\r\nThis brought him to his senses. As an Englishman, and a foreigner, he\r\ndid not wish to be rude, or to do anything to make himself foolishly\r\nconspicuous and spoil the harmony of the evening. He was a guest, and a\r\nprivileged guest at that. Besides, the music had already begun. Bruder\r\nSchliemann’s long white fingers were caressing the keys to some purpose.\r\n\r\nHe subsided into his chair and smoked with half-closed eyes that yet\r\nsaw everything.\r\n\r\nBut the shudder had established itself in his being, and, whether he\r\nwould or not, it kept repeating itself. As a town, far up some inland\r\nriver, feels the pressure of the distant sea, so he became aware that\r\nmighty forces from somewhere beyond his ken were urging themselves\r\nup against his soul in this smoky little room. He began to feel\r\nexceedingly ill at ease.\r\n\r\nAnd as the music filled the air his mind began to clear. Like a lifted\r\nveil there rose up something that had hitherto obscured his vision.\r\nThe words of the priest at the railway inn flashed across his brain\r\nunbidden: “You will find it different.” And also, though why he\r\ncould not tell, he saw mentally the strong, rather wonderful eyes of\r\nthat other guest at the supper-table, the man who had overheard his\r\nconversation, and had later got into earnest talk with the priest. He\r\ntook out his watch and stole a glance at it. Two hours had slipped by.\r\nIt was already eleven o’clock.\r\n\r\nSchliemann, meanwhile, utterly absorbed in his music, was playing a\r\nsolemn measure. The piano sang marvellously. The power of a great\r\nconviction, the simplicity of great art, the vital spiritual message\r\nof a soul that had found itself--all this, and more, were in the\r\nchords, and yet somehow the music was what can only be described as\r\nimpure--atrociously and diabolically impure. And the piece itself,\r\nalthough Harris did not recognise it as anything familiar, was surely\r\nthe music of a Mass--huge, majestic, sombre? It stalked through the\r\nsmoky room with slow power, like the passage of something that was\r\nmighty, yet profoundly intimate, and as it went there stirred into each\r\nand every face about him the signature of the enormous forces of which\r\nit was the audible symbol. The countenances round him turned sinister,\r\nbut not idly, negatively sinister: they grew dark with purpose. He\r\nsuddenly recalled the face of Bruder Kalkmann in the corridor earlier\r\nin the evening. The motives of their secret souls rose to the eyes, and\r\nmouths, and foreheads, and hung there for all to see like the black\r\nbanners of an assembly of ill-starred and fallen creatures. Demons--was\r\nthe horrible word that flashed through his brain like a sheet of fire.\r\n\r\nWhen this sudden discovery leaped out upon him, for a moment he lost\r\nhis self-control. Without waiting to think and weigh his extraordinary\r\nimpression, he did a very foolish but a very natural thing. Feeling\r\nhimself irresistibly driven by the sudden stress to some kind of\r\naction, he sprang to his feet--and screamed! To his own utter\r\namazement he stood up and shrieked aloud!\r\n\r\nBut no one stirred. No one, apparently, took the slightest notice of\r\nhis absurdly wild behaviour. It was almost as if no one but himself\r\nhad heard the scream at all--as though the music had drowned it and\r\nswallowed it up--as though after all perhaps he had not really screamed\r\nas loudly as he imagined, or had not screamed at all.\r\n\r\nThen, as he glanced at the motionless, dark faces before him, something\r\nof utter cold passed into his being, touching his very soul.... All\r\nemotion cooled suddenly, leaving him like a receding tide. He sat down\r\nagain, ashamed, mortified, angry with himself for behaving like a fool\r\nand a boy. And the music, meanwhile, continued to issue from the white\r\nand snake-like fingers of Bruder Schliemann, as poisoned wine might\r\nissue from the weirdly-fashioned necks of antique phials.\r\n\r\nAnd, with the rest of them, Harris drank it in.\r\n\r\nForcing himself to believe that he had been the victim of some kind of\r\nillusory perception, he vigorously restrained his feelings. Then the\r\nmusic presently ceased, and every one applauded and began to talk at\r\nonce, laughing, changing seats, complimenting the player, and behaving\r\nnaturally and easily as though nothing out of the way had happened.\r\nThe faces appeared normal once more. The Brothers crowded round their\r\nvisitor, and he joined in their talk and even heard himself thanking\r\nthe gifted musician.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time, he found himself edging towards the door, nearer\r\nand nearer, changing his chair when possible, and joining the groups\r\nthat stood closest to the way of escape.\r\n\r\n“I must thank you all _tausendmal_ for my little reception and the\r\ngreat pleasure--the very great honour you have done me,” he began in\r\ndecided tones at length, “but I fear I have trespassed far too long\r\nalready on your hospitality. Moreover, I have some distance to walk to\r\nmy inn.”\r\n\r\nA chorus of voices greeted his words. They would not hear of his\r\ngoing,--at least not without first partaking of refreshment. They\r\nproduced pumpernickel from one cupboard, and rye-bread and sausage from\r\nanother, and all began to talk again and eat. More coffee was made,\r\nfresh cigars lighted, and Bruder Meyer took out his violin and began to\r\ntune it softly.\r\n\r\n“There is always a bed upstairs if Herr Harris will accept it,” said\r\none.\r\n\r\n“And it is difficult to find the way out now, for all the doors are\r\nlocked,” laughed another loudly.\r\n\r\n“Let us take our simple pleasures as they come,” cried a third. “Bruder\r\nHarris will understand how we appreciate the honour of this last visit\r\nof his.”\r\n\r\nThey made a dozen excuses. They all laughed, as though the politeness\r\nof their words was but formal, and veiled thinly--more and more\r\nthinly--a very different meaning.\r\n\r\n“And the hour of midnight draws near,” added Bruder Kalkmann with a\r\ncharming smile, but in a voice that sounded to the Englishman like the\r\ngrating of iron hinges.\r\n\r\nTheir German seemed to him more and more difficult to understand.\r\nHe noted that they called him “Bruder” too, classing him as one of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly he had a flash of keener perception, and\r\nrealised with a creeping of his flesh that he had all along\r\nmisinterpreted--grossly misinterpreted all they had been saying. They\r\nhad talked about the beauty of the place, its isolation and remoteness\r\nfrom the world, its peculiar fitness for certain kinds of spiritual\r\ndevelopment and worship--yet hardly, he now grasped, in the sense in\r\nwhich he had taken the words. They had meant something different.\r\nTheir spiritual powers, their desire for loneliness, their passion\r\nfor worship, were not the powers, the solitude, or the worship that\r\n_he_ meant and understood. He was playing a part in some horrible\r\nmasquerade; he was among men who cloaked their lives with religion in\r\norder to follow their real purposes unseen of men.\r\n\r\nWhat did it all mean? How had he blundered into so equivocal a\r\nsituation? Had he blundered into it at all? Had he not rather been led\r\ninto it, deliberately led? His thoughts grew dreadfully confused, and\r\nhis confidence in himself began to fade. And why, he suddenly thought\r\nagain, were they so impressed by the mere fact of his coming to revisit\r\nhis old school? What was it they so admired and wondered at in his\r\nsimple act? Why did they set such store upon his having the courage to\r\ncome, to “give himself so freely,” “unconditionally” as one of them had\r\nexpressed it with such a mockery of exaggeration?\r\n\r\nFear stirred in his heart most horribly, and he found no answer to any\r\nof his questionings. Only one thing he now understood quite clearly:\r\nit was their purpose to keep him here. They did not intend that he\r\nshould go. And from this moment he realised that they were sinister,\r\nformidable and, in some way he had yet to discover, inimical to\r\nhimself, inimical to his life. And the phrase one of them had used a\r\nmoment ago--“this _last_ visit of his”--rose before his eyes in letters\r\nof flame.\r\n\r\nHarris was not a man of action, and had never known in all the course\r\nof his career what it meant to be in a situation of real danger. He\r\nwas not necessarily a coward, though, perhaps, a man of untried nerve.\r\nHe realised at last plainly that he was in a very awkward predicament\r\nindeed, and that he had to deal with men who were utterly in earnest.\r\nWhat their intentions were he only vaguely guessed. His mind, indeed,\r\nwas too confused for definite ratiocination, and he was only able to\r\nfollow blindly the strongest instincts that moved in him. It never\r\noccurred to him that the Brothers might all be mad, or that he himself\r\nmight have temporarily lost his senses and be suffering under some\r\nterrible delusion. In fact, nothing occurred to him--he realised\r\nnothing--except that he meant to escape--and the quicker the better. A\r\ntremendous revulsion of feeling set in and overpowered him.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, without further protest for the moment, he ate his\r\npumpernickel and drank his coffee, talking meanwhile as naturally and\r\npleasantly as he could, and when a suitable interval had passed, he\r\nrose to his feet and announced once more that he must now take his\r\nleave. He spoke very quietly, but very decidedly. No one hearing him\r\ncould doubt that he meant what he said. He had got very close to the\r\ndoor by this time.\r\n\r\n“I regret,” he said, using his best German, and speaking to a hushed\r\nroom, “that our pleasant evening must come to an end, but it is now\r\ntime for me to wish you all good-night.” And then, as no one said\r\nanything, he added, though with a trifle less assurance, “And I thank\r\nyou all most sincerely for your hospitality.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” replied Kalkmann instantly, rising from his chair\r\nand ignoring the hand the Englishman had stretched out to him, “it is\r\nwe who have to thank you; and we do so most gratefully and sincerely.”\r\n\r\nAnd at the same moment at least half a dozen of the Brothers took up\r\ntheir position between himself and the door.\r\n\r\n“You are very good to say so,” Harris replied as firmly as he could\r\nmanage, noticing this movement out of the corner of his eye, “but\r\nreally I had no conception that--my little chance visit could have\r\nafforded you so much pleasure.” He moved another step nearer the door,\r\nbut Bruder Schliemann came across the room quickly and stood in front\r\nof him. His attitude was uncompromising. A dark and terrible expression\r\nhad come into his face.\r\n\r\n“But it was _not_ by chance that you came, Bruder Harris,” he said so\r\nthat all the room could hear; “surely we have not misunderstood your\r\npresence here?” He raised his black eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” the Englishman hastened to reply. “I was--I am delighted\r\nto be here. I told you what pleasure it gave me to find myself among\r\nyou. Do not misunderstand me, I beg.” His voice faltered a little, and\r\nhe had difficulty in finding the words. More and more, too, he had\r\ndifficulty in understanding _their_ words.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” interposed Bruder Kalkmann in his iron bass, “_we_ have\r\nnot misunderstood. You have come back in the spirit of true and\r\nunselfish devotion. You offer yourself freely, and we all appreciate\r\nit. It is your willingness and nobility that have so completely won our\r\nveneration and respect.” A faint murmur of applause ran round the room.\r\n“What we all delight in--what our great Master will especially delight\r\nin--is the value of your spontaneous and voluntary----”\r\n\r\nHe used a word Harris did not understand. He said “_Opfer_.” The\r\nbewildered Englishman searched his brain for the translation, and\r\nsearched in vain. For the life of him he could not remember what it\r\nmeant. But the word, for all his inability to translate it, touched his\r\nsoul with ice. It was worse, far worse, than anything he had imagined.\r\nHe felt like a lost, helpless creature, and all power to fight sank out\r\nof him from that moment.\r\n\r\n“It is magnificent to be such a willing----” added Schliemann, sidling\r\nup to him with a dreadful leer on his face. He made use of the same\r\nword--“_Opfer_.”\r\n\r\nGod! What could it all mean? “Offer himself!” “True spirit of\r\ndevotion!” “Willing,” “unselfish,” “magnificent!” _Opfer, Opfer,\r\nOpfer!_ What in the name of heaven did it mean, that strange,\r\nmysterious word that struck such terror into his heart?\r\n\r\nHe made a valiant effort to keep his presence of mind and hold his\r\nnerves steady. Turning, he saw that Kalkmann’s face was a dead white.\r\nKalkmann! He understood that well enough. _Kalkmann_ meant “Man of\r\nChalk”; he knew that. But what did “_Opfer_” mean? That was the real\r\nkey to the situation. Words poured through his disordered mind in an\r\nendless stream--unusual, rare words he had perhaps heard but once in\r\nhis life--while “_Opfer_,” a word in common use, entirely escaped him.\r\nWhat an extraordinary mockery it all was!\r\n\r\nThen Kalkmann, pale as death, but his face hard as iron, spoke a few\r\nlow words that he did not catch, and the Brothers standing by the walls\r\nat once turned the lamps down so that the room became dim. In the half\r\nlight he could only just discern their faces and movements.\r\n\r\n“It is time,” he heard Kalkmann’s remorseless voice continue just\r\nbehind him. “The hour of midnight is at hand. Let us prepare. He comes!\r\nHe comes; Bruder Asmodelius comes!” His voice rose to a chant.\r\n\r\nAnd the sound of that name, for some extraordinary reason, was\r\nterrible--utterly terrible; so that Harris shook from head to foot as\r\nhe heard it. Its utterance filled the air like soft thunder, and a hush\r\ncame over the whole room. Forces rose all about him, transforming the\r\nnormal into the horrible, and the spirit of craven fear ran through all\r\nhis being, bringing him to the verge of collapse.\r\n\r\n_Asmodelius! Asmodelius!_ The name was appalling. For he understood at\r\nlast to whom it referred and the meaning that lay between its great\r\nsyllables. At the same instant, too, he suddenly understood the meaning\r\nof that unremembered word. The import of the word “_Opfer_” flashed\r\nupon his soul like a message of death.\r\n\r\nHe thought of making a wild effort to reach the door, but the weakness\r\nof his trembling knees, and the row of black figures that stood\r\nbetween, dissuaded him at once. He would have screamed for help, but\r\nremembering the emptiness of the vast building, and the loneliness of\r\nthe situation, he understood that no help could come that way, and he\r\nkept his lips closed. He stood still and did nothing. But he knew now\r\nwhat was coming.\r\n\r\nTwo of the brothers approached and took him gently by the arm.\r\n\r\n“Bruder Asmodelius accepts you,” they whispered; “are you ready?”\r\n\r\nThen he found his tongue and tried to speak. “But what have I to do\r\nwith this Bruder Asm--Asmo----?” he stammered, a desperate rush of\r\nwords crowding vainly behind the halting tongue.\r\n\r\nThe name refused to pass his lips. He could not pronounce it as they\r\ndid. He could not pronounce it at all. His sense of helplessness then\r\nentered the acute stage, for this inability to speak the name produced\r\na fresh sense of quite horrible confusion in his mind, and he became\r\nextraordinarily agitated.\r\n\r\n“I came here for a friendly visit,” he tried to say with a great\r\neffort, but, to his intense dismay, he heard his voice saying something\r\nquite different, and actually making use of that very word they had all\r\nused: “I came here as a willing _Opfer_,” he heard his own voice say,\r\n“and _I am quite ready_.”\r\n\r\nHe was lost beyond all recall now! Not alone his mind, but the very\r\nmuscles of his body had passed out of control. He felt that he was\r\nhovering on the confines of a phantom or demon-world,--a world in which\r\nthe name they had spoken constituted the Master-name, the word of\r\nultimate power.\r\n\r\nWhat followed he heard and saw as in a nightmare.\r\n\r\n“In the half light that veils all truth, let us prepare to worship and\r\nadore,” chanted Schliemann, who had preceded him to the end of the room.\r\n\r\n“In the mists that protect our faces before the Black Throne, let us\r\nmake ready the willing victim,” echoed Kalkmann in his great bass.\r\n\r\nThey raised their faces, listening expectantly, as a roaring sound,\r\nlike the passing of mighty projectiles, filled the air, far, far away,\r\nvery wonderful, very forbidding. The walls of the room trembled.\r\n\r\n“He comes! He comes! He comes!” chanted the Brothers in chorus.\r\n\r\nThe sound of roaring died away, and an atmosphere of still and utter\r\ncold established itself over all. Then Kalkmann, dark and unutterably\r\nstern, turned in the dim light and faced the rest.\r\n\r\n“Asmodelius, our _Hauptbruder_, is about us,” he cried in a voice that\r\neven while it shook was yet a voice of iron; “Asmodelius is about us.\r\nMake ready.”\r\n\r\nThere followed a pause in which no one stirred or spoke. A tall Brother\r\napproached the Englishman; but Kalkmann held up his hand.\r\n\r\n“Let the eyes remain uncovered,” he said, “in honour of so freely\r\ngiving himself.” And to his horror Harris then realised for the first\r\ntime that his hands were already fastened to his sides.\r\n\r\nThe Brother retreated again silently, and in the pause that followed\r\nall the figures about him dropped to their knees, leaving him standing\r\nalone, and as they dropped, in voices hushed with mingled reverence and\r\nawe, they cried softly, odiously, appallingly, the name of the Being\r\nwhom they momentarily expected to appear.\r\n\r\nThen, at the end of the room, where the windows seemed to have\r\ndisappeared so that he saw the stars, there rose into view far up\r\nagainst the night sky, grand and terrible, the outline of a man. A\r\nkind of grey glory enveloped it so that it resembled a steel-cased\r\nstatue, immense, imposing, horrific in its distant splendour; while,\r\nat the same time, the face was so spiritually mighty, yet so proudly,\r\nso austerely sad, that Harris felt as he stared, that the sight was\r\nmore than his eyes could meet, and that in another moment the power\r\nof vision would fail him altogether, and he must sink into utter\r\nnothingness.\r\n\r\nSo remote and inaccessible hung this figure that it was impossible to\r\ngauge anything as to its size, yet at the same time so strangely close,\r\nthat when the grey radiance from its mightily broken visage, august and\r\nmournful, beat down upon his soul, pulsing like some dark star with the\r\npowers of spiritual evil, he felt almost as though he were looking into\r\na face no farther removed from him in space than the face of any one of\r\nthe Brothers who stood by his side.\r\n\r\nAnd then the room filled and trembled with sounds that Harris\r\nunderstood full well were the failing voices of others who had preceded\r\nhim in a long series down the years. There came first a plain, sharp\r\ncry, as of a man in the last anguish, choking for his breath, and\r\nyet, with the very final expiration of it, breathing the name of the\r\nWorship--of the dark Being who rejoiced to hear it. The cries of the\r\nstrangled; the short, running gasp of the suffocated; and the smothered\r\ngurgling of the tightened throat, all these, and more, echoed back\r\nand forth between the walls, the very walls in which he now stood a\r\nprisoner, a sacrificial victim. The cries, too, not alone of the broken\r\nbodies, but--far worse--of beaten, broken souls. And as the ghastly\r\nchorus rose and fell, there came also the faces of the lost and unhappy\r\ncreatures to whom they belonged, and, against that curtain of pale grey\r\nlight, he saw float past him in the air, an array of white and piteous\r\nhuman countenances that seemed to beckon and gibber at him as though he\r\nwere already one of themselves.\r\n\r\nSlowly, too, as the voices rose, and the pallid crew sailed past, that\r\ngiant form of grey descended from the sky and approached the room that\r\ncontained the worshippers and their prisoner. Hands rose and sank about\r\nhim in the darkness, and he felt that he was being draped in other\r\ngarments than his own; a circlet of ice seemed to run about his head,\r\nwhile round the waist, enclosing the fastened arms, he felt a girdle\r\ntightly drawn. At last, about his very throat, there ran a soft and\r\nsilken touch which, better than if there had been full light, and a\r\nmirror held to his face, he understood to be the cord of sacrifice--and\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Brothers, still prostrate upon the floor, began\r\nagain their mournful, yet impassioned chanting, and as they did so a\r\nstrange thing happened. For, apparently without moving or altering its\r\nposition, the huge Figure seemed, at once and suddenly, to be inside\r\nthe room, almost beside him, and to fill the space around him to the\r\nexclusion of all else.\r\n\r\nHe was now beyond all ordinary sensations of fear, only a drab feeling\r\nas of death--the death of the soul--stirred in his heart. His thoughts\r\nno longer even beat vainly for escape. The end was near, and he knew\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe dreadfully chanting voices rose about him in a wave: “We worship!\r\nWe adore! We offer!” The sounds filled his ears and hammered, almost\r\nmeaningless, upon his brain.\r\n\r\nThen the majestic grey face turned slowly downwards upon him, and his\r\nvery soul passed outwards and seemed to become absorbed in the sea\r\nof those anguished eyes. At the same moment a dozen hands forced him\r\nto his knees, and in the air before him he saw the arm of Kalkmann\r\nupraised, and felt the pressure about his throat grow strong.\r\n\r\nIt was in this awful moment, when he had given up all hope, and the\r\nhelp of gods or men seemed beyond question, that a strange thing\r\nhappened. For before his fading and terrified vision, there slid, as\r\nin a dream of light,--yet without apparent rhyme or reason--wholly\r\nunbidden and unexplained,--the face of that other man at the supper\r\ntable of the railway inn. And the sight, even mentally, of that strong,\r\nwholesome, vigorous English face, inspired him suddenly with a new\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nIt was but a flash of fading vision before he sank into a dark and\r\nterrible death, yet, in some inexplicable way, the sight of that face\r\nstirred in him unconquerable hope and the certainty of deliverance. It\r\nwas a face of power, a face, he now realised, of simple goodness such\r\nas might have been seen by men of old on the shores of Galilee; a face,\r\nby heaven, that could conquer even the devils of outer space.\r\n\r\nAnd, in his despair and abandonment, he called upon it, and called with\r\nno uncertain accents. He found his voice in this overwhelming moment\r\nto some purpose; though the words he actually used, and whether they\r\nwere in German or English, he could never remember. Their effect,\r\nnevertheless, was instantaneous. The Brothers understood, and that grey\r\nFigure of evil understood.\r\n\r\nFor a second the confusion was terrific. There came a great shattering\r\nsound. It seemed that the very earth trembled. But all Harris\r\nremembered afterwards was that voices rose about him in the clamour of\r\nterrified alarm--\r\n\r\n“A man of power is among us! A man of God!”\r\n\r\nThe vast sound was repeated--the rushing through space as of huge\r\nprojectiles--and he sank to the floor of the room, unconscious. The\r\nentire scene had vanished, vanished like smoke over the roof of a\r\ncottage when the wind blows.\r\n\r\nAnd, by his side, sat down a slight, un-German figure,--the figure of\r\nthe stranger at the inn,--the man who had the “rather wonderful eyes.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Harris came to himself he felt cold. He was lying under the open\r\nsky, and the cool air of field and forest was blowing upon his face.\r\nHe sat up and looked about him. The memory of the late scene was\r\nstill horribly in his mind, but no vestige of it remained. No walls\r\nor ceiling enclosed him; he was no longer in a room at all. There\r\nwere no lamps turned low, no cigar smoke, no black forms of sinister\r\nworshippers, no tremendous grey Figure hovering beyond the windows.\r\n\r\nOpen space was about him, and he was lying on a pile of bricks and\r\nmortar, his clothes soaked with dew, and the kind stars shining\r\nbrightly overhead. He was lying, bruised and shaken, among the\r\nheaped-up débris of a ruined building.\r\n\r\nHe stood up and stared about him. There, in the shadowy distance, lay\r\nthe surrounding forest, and here, close at hand, stood the outline of\r\nthe village buildings. But, underfoot, beyond question, lay nothing\r\nbut the broken heaps of stones that betokened a building long since\r\ncrumbled to dust. Then he saw that the stones were blackened, and\r\nthat great wooden beams, half burnt, half rotten, made lines through\r\nthe general débris. He stood, then, among the ruins of a burnt and\r\nshattered building, the weeds and nettles proving conclusively that it\r\nhad lain thus for many years.\r\n\r\nThe moon had already set behind the encircling forest, but the stars\r\nthat spangled the heavens threw enough light to enable him to make\r\nquite sure of what he saw. Harris, the silk merchant, stood among these\r\nbroken and burnt stones and shivered.\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly became aware that out of the gloom a figure had risen\r\nand stood beside him. Peering at him, he thought he recognised the face\r\nof the stranger at the railway inn.\r\n\r\n“Are _you_ real?” he asked in a voice he hardly recognised as his own.\r\n\r\n“More than real--I’m friendly,” replied the stranger; “I followed you\r\nup here from the inn.”\r\n\r\nHarris stood and stared for several minutes without adding anything.\r\nHis teeth chattered. The least sound made him start; but the simple\r\nwords in his own language, and the tone in which they were uttered,\r\ncomforted him inconceivably.\r\n\r\n“You’re English too, thank God,” he said inconsequently. “These German\r\ndevils----” He broke off and put a hand to his eyes. “But what’s\r\nbecome of them all--and the room--and--and----” The hand travelled\r\ndown to his throat and moved nervously round his neck. He drew a long,\r\nlong breath of relief. “Did I dream everything--everything?” he said\r\ndistractedly.\r\n\r\nHe stared wildly about him, and the stranger moved forward and took his\r\narm. “Come,” he said soothingly, yet with a trace of command in the\r\nvoice, “we will move away from here. The high-road, or even the woods\r\nwill be more to your taste, for we are standing now on one of the most\r\nhaunted--and most terribly haunted--spots of the whole world.”\r\n\r\nHe guided his companion’s stumbling footsteps over the broken masonry\r\nuntil they reached the path, the nettles stinging their hands, and\r\nHarris feeling his way like a man in a dream. Passing through the\r\ntwisted iron railing they reached the path, and thence made their way\r\nto the road, shining white in the night. Once safely out of the ruins,\r\nHarris collected himself and turned to look back.\r\n\r\n“But, how is it possible?” he exclaimed, his voice still shaking.\r\n“How can it be possible? When I came in here I saw the building in\r\nthe moonlight. They opened the door. I saw the figures and heard the\r\nvoices and touched, yes touched their very hands, and saw their damned\r\nblack faces, saw them far more plainly than I see you now.” He was\r\ndeeply bewildered. The glamour was still upon his eyes with a degree\r\nof reality stronger than the reality even of normal life. “Was I so\r\nutterly deluded?”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the words of the stranger, which he had only half heard\r\nor understood, returned to him.\r\n\r\n“Haunted?” he asked, looking hard at him; “haunted, did you say?” He\r\npaused in the roadway and stared into the darkness where the building\r\nof the old school had first appeared to him. But the stranger hurried\r\nhim forward.\r\n\r\n“We shall talk more safely farther on,” he said. “I followed you from\r\nthe inn the moment I realised where you had gone. When I found you it\r\nwas eleven o’clock----”\r\n\r\n“Eleven o’clock,” said Harris, remembering with a shudder.\r\n\r\n“----I saw you drop. I watched over you till you recovered\r\nconsciousness of your own accord, and now--now I am here to guide you\r\nsafely back to the inn. I have broken the spell--the glamour----”\r\n\r\n“I owe you a great deal, sir,” interrupted Harris again, beginning\r\nto understand something of the stranger’s kindness, “but I don’t\r\nunderstand it all. I feel dazed and shaken.” His teeth still chattered,\r\nand spells of violent shivering passed over him from head to foot. He\r\nfound that he was clinging to the other’s arm. In this way they passed\r\nbeyond the deserted and crumbling village and gained the high-road that\r\nled homewards through the forest.\r\n\r\n“That school building has long been in ruins,” said the man at his side\r\npresently; “it was burnt down by order of the Elders of the community\r\nat least ten years ago. The village has been uninhabited ever since.\r\nBut the simulacra of certain ghastly events that took place under\r\nthat roof in past days still continue. And the ‘shells’ of the chief\r\nparticipants still enact there the dreadful deeds that led to its final\r\ndestruction, and to the desertion of the whole settlement. They were\r\ndevil-worshippers!”\r\n\r\nHarris listened with beads of perspiration on his forehead that did\r\nnot come alone from their leisurely pace through the cool night.\r\nAlthough he had seen this man but once before in his life, and had\r\nnever before exchanged so much as a word with him, he felt a degree of\r\nconfidence and a subtle sense of safety and well-being in his presence\r\nthat were the most healing influences he could possibly have wished\r\nafter the experience he had been through. For all that, he still felt\r\nas if he were walking in a dream, and though he heard every word that\r\nfell from his companion’s lips, it was only the next day that the full\r\nimport of all he said became fully clear to him. The presence of this\r\nquiet stranger, the man with the wonderful eyes which he felt now,\r\nrather than saw, applied a soothing anodyne to his shattered spirit\r\nthat healed him through and through. And this healing influence,\r\ndistilled from the dark figure at his side, satisfied his first\r\nimperative need, so that he almost forgot to realise how strange and\r\nopportune it was that the man should be there at all.\r\n\r\nIt somehow never occurred to him to ask his name, or to feel any undue\r\nwonder that one passing tourist should take so much trouble on behalf\r\nof another. He just walked by his side, listening to his quiet words,\r\nand allowing himself to enjoy the very wonderful experience after his\r\nrecent ordeal, of being helped, strengthened, blessed. Only once,\r\nremembering vaguely something of his reading of years ago, he turned to\r\nthe man beside him, after some more than usually remarkable words, and\r\nheard himself, almost involuntarily it seemed, putting the question:\r\n“Then are you a Rosicrucian, sir, perhaps?” But the stranger had\r\nignored the words, or possibly not heard them, for he continued with\r\nhis talk as though unconscious of any interruption, and Harris became\r\naware that another somewhat unusual picture had taken possession of his\r\nmind, as they walked there side by side through the cool reaches of the\r\nforest, and that he had found his imagination suddenly charged with the\r\nchildhood memory of Jacob wrestling with an angel,--wrestling all night\r\nwith a being of superior quality whose strength eventually became his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n“It was your abrupt conversation with the priest at supper that first\r\nput me upon the track of this remarkable occurrence,” he heard the\r\nman’s quiet voice beside him in the darkness, “and it was from him\r\nI learned after you left the story of the devil-worship that became\r\nsecretly established in the heart of this simple and devout little\r\ncommunity.”\r\n\r\n“Devil-worship! Here----!” Harris stammered, aghast.\r\n\r\n“Yes--here;--conducted secretly for years by a group of Brothers before\r\nunexplained disappearances in the neighbourhood led to its discovery.\r\nFor where could they have found a safer place in the whole wide world\r\nfor their ghastly traffic and perverted powers than here, in the very\r\nprecincts--under cover of the very shadow of saintliness and holy\r\nliving?”\r\n\r\n“Awful, awful!” whispered the silk merchant, “and when I tell you the\r\nwords they used to me----”\r\n\r\n“I know it all,” the stranger said quietly. “I saw and heard\r\neverything. My plan first was to wait till the end and then to take\r\nsteps for their destruction, but in the interest of your personal\r\nsafety,”--he spoke with the utmost gravity and conviction,--“in the\r\ninterest of the safety of your soul, I made my presence known when I\r\ndid, and before the conclusion had been reached----”\r\n\r\n“My safety! The danger, then, was real. They were alive and----” Words\r\nfailed him. He stopped in the road and turned towards his companion,\r\nthe shining of whose eyes he could just make out in the gloom.\r\n\r\n“It was a concourse of the shells of violent men, spiritually-developed\r\nbut evil men, seeking after death--the death of the body--to prolong\r\ntheir vile and unnatural existence. And had they accomplished their\r\nobject you, in turn, at the death of your body, would have passed into\r\ntheir power and helped to swell their dreadful purposes.”\r\n\r\nHarris made no reply. He was trying hard to concentrate his mind upon\r\nthe sweet and common things of life. He even thought of silk and St.\r\nPaul’s Churchyard and the faces of his partners in business.\r\n\r\n“For you came all prepared to be caught,” he heard the other’s\r\nvoice like some one talking to him from a distance; “your deeply\r\nintrospective mood had already reconstructed the past so vividly, so\r\nintensely, that you were _en rapport_ at once with any forces of those\r\ndays that chanced still to be lingering. And they swept you up all\r\nunresistingly.”\r\n\r\nHarris tightened his hold upon the stranger’s arm as he heard. At the\r\nmoment he had room for one emotion only. It did not seem to him odd\r\nthat this stranger should have such intimate knowledge of his mind.\r\n\r\n“It is, alas, chiefly the evil emotions that are able to leave their\r\nphotographs upon surrounding scenes and objects,” the other added, “and\r\nwho ever heard of a place haunted by a noble deed, or of beautiful and\r\nlovely ghosts revisiting the glimpses of the moon? It is unfortunate.\r\nBut the wicked passions of men’s hearts alone seem strong enough to\r\nleave pictures that persist; the good are ever too lukewarm.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger sighed as he spoke. But Harris, exhausted and shaken as\r\nhe was to the very core, paced by his side, only half listening. He\r\nmoved as in a dream still. It was very wonderful to him, this walk\r\nhome under the stars in the early hours of the October morning, the\r\npeaceful forest all about them, mist rising here and there over the\r\nsmall clearings, and the sound of water from a hundred little invisible\r\nstreams filling in the pauses of the talk. In after life he always\r\nlooked back to it as something magical and impossible, something that\r\nhad seemed too beautiful, too curiously beautiful, to have been quite\r\ntrue. And, though at the time he heard and understood but a quarter of\r\nwhat the stranger said, it came back to him afterwards, staying with\r\nhim till the end of his days, and always with a curious, haunting sense\r\nof unreality, as though he had enjoyed a wonderful dream of which he\r\ncould recall only faint and exquisite portions.\r\n\r\nBut the horror of the earlier experience was effectually dispelled; and\r\nwhen they reached the railway inn, somewhere about three o’clock in\r\nthe morning, Harris shook the stranger’s hand gratefully, effusively,\r\nmeeting the look of those rather wonderful eyes with a full heart, and\r\nwent up to his room, thinking in a hazy, dream-like way of the words\r\nwith which the stranger had brought their conversation to an end as\r\nthey left the confines of the forest--\r\n\r\n“And if thought and emotion can persist in this way so long after\r\nthe brain that sent them forth has crumbled into dust, how vitally\r\nimportant it must be to control their very birth in the heart, and\r\nguard them with the keenest possible restraint.”\r\n\r\nBut Harris, the silk merchant, slept better than might have been\r\nexpected, and with a soundness that carried him half-way through the\r\nday. And when he came downstairs and learned that the stranger had\r\nalready taken his departure, he realised with keen regret that he had\r\nnever once thought of asking his name.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he signed in the visitors’ book,” said the girl in reply to his\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nAnd he turned over the blotted pages and found there, the last entry,\r\nin a very delicate and individual handwriting--\r\n\r\n“_John Silence_, London.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE V\r\n\r\nTHE CAMP OF THE DOG\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIslands of all shapes and sizes troop northward from Stockholm by the\r\nhundred, and the little steamer that threads their intricate mazes in\r\nsummer leaves the traveller in a somewhat bewildered state as regards\r\nthe points of the compass when it reaches the end of its journey at\r\nWaxholm. But it is only after Waxholm that the true islands begin, so\r\nto speak, to run wild, and start up the coast on their tangled course\r\nof a hundred miles of deserted loveliness, and it was in the very heart\r\nof this delightful confusion that we pitched our tents for a summer\r\nholiday. A veritable wilderness of islands lay about us: from the mere\r\nround button of a rock that bore a single fir, to the mountainous\r\nstretch of a square mile, densely wooded, and bounded by precipitous\r\ncliffs; so close together often that a strip of water ran between no\r\nwider than a country lane, or, again, so far that an expanse stretched\r\nlike the open sea for miles.\r\n\r\nAlthough the larger islands boasted farms and fishing stations, the\r\nmajority were uninhabited. Carpeted with moss and heather, their\r\ncoast-lines showed a series of ravines and clefts and little sandy\r\nbays, with a growth of splendid pine-woods that came down to the\r\nwater’s edge and led the eye through unknown depths of shadow and\r\nmystery into the very heart of primitive forest.\r\n\r\nThe particular islands to which we had camping rights by virtue\r\nof paying a nominal sum to a Stockholm merchant lay together in a\r\npicturesque group far beyond the reach of the steamer, one being a mere\r\nreef with a fringe of fairy-like birches, and two others, cliff-bound\r\nmonsters rising with wooded heads out of the sea. The fourth, which we\r\nselected because it enclosed a little lagoon suitable for anchorage,\r\nbathing, night-lines, and what-not, shall have what description is\r\nnecessary as the story proceeds; but, so far as paying rent was\r\nconcerned, we might equally well have pitched our tents on any one of a\r\nhundred others that clustered about us as thickly as a swarm of bees.\r\n\r\nIt was in the blaze of an evening in July, the air clear as crystal,\r\nthe sea a cobalt blue, when we left the steamer on the borders of\r\ncivilisation and sailed away with maps, compasses, and provisions for\r\nthe little group of dots in the Skärgård that were to be our home for\r\nthe next two months. The dinghy and my Canadian canoe trailed behind\r\nus, with tents and dunnage carefully piled aboard, and when the point\r\nof cliff intervened to hide the steamer and the Waxholm hotel we\r\nrealised for the first time that the horror of trains and houses was\r\nfar behind us, the fever of men and cities, the weariness of streets\r\nand confined spaces. The wilderness opened up on all sides into endless\r\nblue reaches, and the map and compasses were so frequently called\r\ninto requisition that we went astray more often than not and progress\r\nwas enchantingly slow. It took us, for instance, two whole days to\r\nfind our crescent-shaped home, and the camps we made on the way were\r\nso fascinating that we left them with difficulty and regret, for each\r\nisland seemed more desirable than the one before it, and over all lay\r\nthe spell of haunting peace, remoteness from the turmoil of the world,\r\nand the freedom of open and desolate spaces.\r\n\r\nAnd so many of these spots of world-beauty have I sought out and\r\ndwelt in, that in my mind remains only a composite memory of their\r\nfaces, a true map of heaven, as it were, from which this particular\r\none stands forth with unusual sharpness because of the strange things\r\nthat happened there, and also, I think, because anything in which John\r\nSilence played a part has a habit of fixing itself in the mind with a\r\nliving and lasting quality of vividness.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, Dr. Silence was not of the party. Some private\r\ncase in the interior of Hungary claimed his attention, and it was not\r\ntill later--the 15th of August, to be exact--that I had arranged to\r\nmeet him in Berlin and then return to London together for our harvest\r\nof winter work. All the members of our party, however, were known to\r\nhim more or less well, and on this third day as we sailed through the\r\nnarrow opening into the lagoon and saw the circular ridge of trees in a\r\ngold and crimson sunset before us, his last words to me when we parted\r\nin London for some unaccountable reason came back very sharply to my\r\nmemory, and recalled the curious impression of prophecy with which I\r\nhad first heard them:\r\n\r\n“Enjoy your holiday and store up all the force you can,” he had said as\r\nthe train slipped out of Victoria; “and we will meet in Berlin on the\r\n15th--unless you should send for me sooner.”\r\n\r\nAnd now suddenly the words returned to me so clearly that it seemed\r\nI almost heard his voice in my ear: “Unless you should send for me\r\nsooner;” and returned, moreover, with a significance I was wholly at a\r\nloss to understand that touched somewhere in the depths of my mind a\r\nvague sense of apprehension that they had all along been intended in\r\nthe nature of a prophecy.\r\n\r\nIn the lagoon, then, the wind failed us this July evening, as was only\r\nnatural behind the shelter of the belt of woods, and we took to the\r\noars, all breathless with the beauty of this first sight of our island\r\nhome, yet all talking in somewhat hushed voices of the best place to\r\nland, the depth of water, the safest place to anchor, to put up the\r\ntents in, the most sheltered spot for the camp-fires, and a dozen\r\nthings of importance that crop up when a home in the wilderness has\r\nactually to be made.\r\n\r\nAnd during this busy sunset hour of unloading before the dark, the\r\nsouls of my companions adopted the trick of presenting themselves very\r\nvividly anew before my mind, and introducing themselves afresh.\r\n\r\nIn reality, I suppose, our party was in no sense singular. In the\r\nconventional life at home they certainly seemed ordinary enough,\r\nbut suddenly, as we passed through these gates of the wilderness,\r\nI saw them more sharply than before, with characters stripped of\r\nthe atmosphere of men and cities. A complete change of setting\r\noften furnishes a startlingly new view of people hitherto held for\r\nwell-known; they present another facet of their personalities. I seemed\r\nto see my own party almost as new people--people I had not known\r\nproperly hitherto, people who would drop all disguises and henceforth\r\nreveal themselves as they really were. And each one seemed to say: “Now\r\nyou will see me as I am. You will see me here in this primitive life\r\nof the wilderness without clothes. All my masks and veils I have left\r\nbehind in the abodes of men. So, look out for surprises!”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Timothy Maloney helped me to put up the tents, long\r\npractice making the process easy, and while he drove in pegs and\r\ntightened ropes, his coat off, his flannel collar flying open without\r\na tie, it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that he was cut out\r\nfor the life of a pioneer rather than the church. He was fifty years\r\nof age, muscular, blue-eyed and hearty, and he took his share of the\r\nwork, and more, without shirking. The way he handled the axe in cutting\r\ndown saplings for the tent-poles was a delight to see, and his eye in\r\njudging the level was unfailing.\r\n\r\nBullied as a young man into a lucrative family living, he had in turn\r\nbullied his mind into some semblance of orthodox beliefs, doing the\r\nhonours of the little country church with an energy that made one think\r\nof a coal-heaver tending china; and it was only in the past few years\r\nthat he had resigned the living and taken instead to cramming young men\r\nfor their examinations. This suited him better. It enabled him, too, to\r\nindulge his passion for spells of “wild life,” and to spend the summer\r\nmonths of most years under canvas in one part of the world or another\r\nwhere he could take his young men with him and combine “reading” with\r\nopen air.\r\n\r\nHis wife usually accompanied him, and there was no doubt she enjoyed\r\nthe trips, for she possessed, though in less degree, the same joy of\r\nthe wilderness that was his own distinguishing characteristic. The only\r\ndifference was that while he regarded it as the real life, she regarded\r\nit as an interlude. While he camped out with his heart and mind, she\r\nplayed at camping out with her clothes and body. None the less, she\r\nmade a splendid companion, and to watch her busy cooking dinner over\r\nthe fire we had built among the stones was to understand that her heart\r\nwas in the business for the moment and that she was happy even with the\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maloney at home, knitting in the sun and believing that the world\r\nwas made in six days, was one woman; but Mrs. Maloney, standing with\r\nbare arms over the smoke of a wood fire under the pine trees, was\r\nanother; and Peter Sangree, the Canadian pupil, with his pale skin,\r\nand his loose, though not ungainly figure, stood beside her in very\r\nunfavourable contrast as he scraped potatoes and sliced bacon with\r\nslender white fingers that seemed better suited to hold a pen than a\r\nknife. She ordered him about like a slave, and he obeyed, too, with\r\nwilling pleasure, for in spite of his general appearance of debility he\r\nwas as happy to be in camp as any of them.\r\n\r\nBut more than any other member of the party, Joan Maloney, the\r\ndaughter, was the one who seemed a natural and genuine part of the\r\nlandscape, who belonged to it all just in the same way that the trees\r\nand the moss and the grey rocks running out into the water belonged to\r\nit. For she was obviously in her right and natural setting, a creature\r\nof the wilds, a gipsy in her own home.\r\n\r\nTo any one with a discerning eye this would have been more or less\r\napparent, but to me, who had known her during all the twenty-two\r\nyears of her life and was familiar with the ins and outs of her\r\nprimitive, utterly un-modern type, it was strikingly clear. To see\r\nher there made it impossible to imagine her again in civilisation. I\r\nlost all recollection of how she looked in a town. The memory somehow\r\nevaporated. This slim creature before me, flitting to and fro with the\r\ngrace of the woodland life, swift, supple, adroit, on her knees blowing\r\nthe fire, or stirring the frying-pan through a veil of smoke, suddenly\r\nseemed the only way I had ever really seen her. Here she was at home;\r\nin London she became some one concealed by clothes, an artificial doll\r\noverdressed and moving by clockwork, only a portion of her alive. Here\r\nshe was alive all over.\r\n\r\nI forget altogether how she was dressed, just as I forget how any\r\nparticular tree was dressed, or how the markings ran on any one of the\r\nboulders that lay about the Camp. She looked just as wild and natural\r\nand untamed as everything else that went to make up the scene, and more\r\nthan that I cannot say.\r\n\r\nPretty, she was decidedly not. She was thin, skinny, dark-haired, and\r\npossessed of great physical strength in the form of endurance. She had,\r\ntoo, something of the force and vigorous purpose of a man, tempestuous\r\nsometimes and wild to passionate, frightening her mother, and puzzling\r\nher easy-going father with her storms of waywardness, while at the same\r\ntime she stirred his admiration by her violence. A pagan of the pagans\r\nshe was besides, and with some haunting suggestion of old-world pagan\r\nbeauty about her dark face and eyes. Altogether an odd and difficult\r\ncharacter, but with a generosity and high courage that made her very\r\nlovable.\r\n\r\nIn town life she always seemed to me to feel cramped, bored, a devil\r\nin a cage, in her eyes a hunted expression as though any moment she\r\ndreaded to be caught. But up in these spacious solitudes all this\r\ndisappeared. Away from the limitations that plagued and stung her, she\r\nwould show at her best, and as I watched her moving about the Camp\r\nI repeatedly found myself thinking of a wild creature that had just\r\nobtained its freedom and was trying its muscles.\r\n\r\nPeter Sangree, of course, at once went down before her. But she was so\r\nobviously beyond his reach, and besides so well able to take care of\r\nherself, that I think her parents gave the matter but little thought,\r\nand he himself worshipped at a respectful distance, keeping admirable\r\ncontrol of his passion in all respects save one; for at his age the\r\neyes are difficult to master, and the yearning, almost the devouring,\r\nexpression often visible in them was probably there unknown even to\r\nhimself. He, better than any one else, understood that he had fallen in\r\nlove with something most hard of attainment, something that drew him\r\nto the very edge of life, and almost beyond it. It, no doubt, was a\r\nsecret and terrible joy to him, this passionate worship from afar; only\r\nI think he suffered more than any one guessed, and that his want of\r\nvitality was due in large measure to the constant stream of unsatisfied\r\nyearning that poured for ever from his soul and body. Moreover, it\r\nseemed to me, who now saw them for the first time together, that there\r\nwas an unnamable something--an elusive quality of some kind--that\r\nmarked them as belonging to the same world, and that although the girl\r\nignored him she was secretly, and perhaps unknown to herself, drawn by\r\nsome attribute very deep in her own nature to some quality equally deep\r\nin his.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the party when we first settled down into our two\r\nmonths’ camp on the island in the Baltic Sea. Other figures flitted\r\nfrom time to time across the scene, and sometimes one reading man,\r\nsometimes another, came to join us and spend his four hours a day in\r\nthe clergyman’s tent, but they came for short periods only, and they\r\nwent without leaving much trace in my memory, and certainly they played\r\nno important part in what subsequently happened.\r\n\r\nThe weather favoured us that night, so that by sunset the tents were\r\nup, the boats unloaded, a store of wood collected and chopped into\r\nlengths, and the candle-lanterns hung round ready for lighting on the\r\ntrees. Sangree, too, had picked deep mattresses of balsam boughs for\r\nthe women’s beds, and had cleared little paths of brushwood from their\r\ntents to the central fireplace. All was prepared for bad weather. It\r\nwas a cosy supper and a well-cooked one that we sat down to and ate\r\nunder the stars, and, according to the clergyman, the only meal fit to\r\neat we had seen since we left London a week before.\r\n\r\nThe deep stillness, after that roar of steamers, trains, and tourists,\r\nheld something that thrilled, for as we lay round the fire there was\r\nno sound but the faint sighing of the pines and the soft lapping of\r\nthe waves along the shore and against the sides of the boat in the\r\nlagoon. The ghostly outline of her white sails was just visible\r\nthrough the trees, idly rocking to and fro in her calm anchorage,\r\nher sheets flapping gently against the mast. Beyond lay the dim blue\r\nshapes of other islands floating in the night, and from all the great\r\nspaces about us came the murmur of the sea and the soft breathing of\r\ngreat woods. The odours of the wilderness--smells of wind and earth,\r\nof trees and water, clean, vigorous, and mighty--were the true odours\r\nof a virgin world unspoilt by men, more penetrating and more subtly\r\nintoxicating than any other perfume in the whole world. Oh!--and\r\ndangerously strong, too, no doubt, for some natures!\r\n\r\n“Ahhh!” breathed out the clergyman after supper, with an indescribable\r\ngesture of satisfaction and relief. “Here there is freedom, and room\r\nfor body and mind to turn in. Here one can work and rest and play. Here\r\none can be alive and absorb something of the earth-forces that never\r\nget within touching-distance in the cities. By George, I shall make a\r\npermanent camp here and come when it is time to die!”\r\n\r\nThe good man was merely giving vent to his delight at being under\r\ncanvas. He said the same thing every year, and he said it often. But it\r\nmore or less expressed the superficial feelings of us all. And when, a\r\nlittle later, he turned to compliment his wife on the fried potatoes,\r\nand discovered that she was snoring, with her back against a tree,\r\nhe grunted with content at the sight and put a ground-sheet over her\r\nfeet, as if it were the most natural thing in the world for her to fall\r\nasleep after dinner, and then moved back to his own corner, smoking his\r\npipe with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAnd I, smoking mine too, lay and fought against the most delicious\r\nsleep imaginable, while my eyes wandered from the fire to the stars\r\npeeping through the branches, and then back again to the group about\r\nme. The Rev. Timothy soon let his pipe go out, and succumbed as his\r\nwife had done, for he had worked hard and eaten well. Sangree, also\r\nsmoking, leaned against a tree with his gaze fixed on the girl, a\r\ndepth of yearning in his face that he could not hide, and that really\r\ndistressed me for him. And Joan herself, with wide staring eyes, alert,\r\nfull of the new forces of the place, evidently keyed up by the magic of\r\nfinding herself among all the things her soul recognised as “home,” sat\r\nrigid by the fire, her thoughts roaming through the spaces, the blood\r\nstirring about her heart. She was as unconscious of the Canadian’s gaze\r\nas she was that her parents both slept. She looked to me more like a\r\ntree, or something that had grown out of the island, than a living\r\ngirl of the century; and when I spoke across to her in a whisper and\r\nsuggested a tour of investigation, she started and looked up at me as\r\nthough she heard a voice in her dreams.\r\n\r\nSangree leaped up and joined us, and without waking the others we three\r\nwent over the ridge of the island and made our way down to the shore\r\nbehind. The water lay like a lake before us still coloured by the\r\nsunset. The air was keen and scented, wafting the smell of the wooded\r\nislands that hung about us in the darkening air. Very small waves\r\ntumbled softly on the sand. The sea was sown with stars, and everywhere\r\nbreathed and pulsed the beauty of the northern summer night. I confess\r\nI speedily lost consciousness of the human presences beside me, and I\r\nhave little doubt Joan did too. Only Sangree felt otherwise, I suppose\r\nfor presently we heard him sighing; and I can well imagine that he\r\nabsorbed the whole wonder and passion of the scene into his aching\r\nheart, to swell the pain there that was more searching even than the\r\npain at the sight of such matchless and incomprehensible beauty.\r\n\r\nThe splash of a fish jumping broke the spell.\r\n\r\n“I wish we had the canoe now,” remarked Joan; “we could paddle out to\r\nthe other islands.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” I said; “wait here and I’ll go across for it,” and was\r\nturning to feel my way back through the darkness when she stopped me in\r\na voice that meant what it said.\r\n\r\n“No; Mr. Sangree will get it. We will wait here and cooee to guide him.”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian was off in a moment, for she had only to hint of her\r\nwishes and he obeyed.\r\n\r\n“Keep out from shore in case of rocks,” I cried out as he went, “and\r\nturn to the right out of the lagoon. That’s the shortest way round by\r\nthe map.”\r\n\r\nMy voice travelled across the still waters and woke echoes in the\r\ndistant islands that came back to us like people calling out of space.\r\nIt was only thirty or forty yards over the ridge and down the other\r\nside to the lagoon where the boats lay, but it was a good mile to coast\r\nround the shore in the dark to where we stood and waited. We heard him\r\nstumbling away among the boulders, and then the sounds suddenly ceased\r\nas he topped the ridge and went down past the fire on the other side.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t want to be left alone with him” the girl said presently in a\r\nlow voice. “I’m always afraid he’s going to say or do something----”\r\nShe hesitated a moment, looking quickly over her shoulder towards the\r\nridge where he had just disappeared--“something that might lead to\r\nunpleasantness.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n“_You_ frightened, Joan!” I exclaimed, with genuine surprise. “This is\r\na new light on your wicked character. I thought the human being who\r\ncould frighten you did not exist.” Then I suddenly realised she was\r\ntalking seriously--looking to me for help of some kind--and at once I\r\ndropped the teasing attitude.\r\n\r\n“He’s very far gone, I think, Joan,” I added gravely. “You must be kind\r\nto him, whatever else you may feel. He’s exceedingly fond of you.”\r\n\r\n“I know, but I can’t help it,” she whispered, lest her voice should\r\ncarry in the stillness; “there’s something about him that--that makes\r\nme feel creepy and half afraid.”\r\n\r\n“But, poor man, it’s not his fault if he is delicate and sometimes\r\nlooks like death,” I laughed gently, by way of defending what I felt to\r\nbe a very innocent member of my sex.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but it’s not that I mean,” she answered quickly; “it’s something\r\nI feel about him, something in his soul, something he hardly knows\r\nhimself, but that may come out if we are much together. It draws me, I\r\nfeel, tremendously. It stirs what is wild in me--deep down--oh, very\r\ndeep down,--yet at the same time makes me feel afraid.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose his thoughts are always playing about you,” I said, “but\r\nhe’s nice-minded and----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” she interrupted impatiently, “I can trust myself absolutely\r\nwith him. He’s gentle and singularly pure-minded. But there’s something\r\nelse that----” She stopped again sharply to listen. Then she came up\r\nclose beside me in the darkness, whispering--\r\n\r\n“You know, Mr. Hubbard, sometimes my intuitions warn me a little too\r\nstrongly to be ignored. Oh yes, you needn’t tell me again that it’s\r\ndifficult to distinguish between fancy and intuition. I know all that.\r\nBut I also know that there’s something deep down in that man’s soul\r\nthat calls to something deep down in mine. And at present it frightens\r\nme. Because I cannot make out what it is; and I know, I _know_, he’ll\r\ndo something some day that--that will shake my life to the very\r\nbottom.” She laughed a little at the strangeness of her own description.\r\n\r\nI turned to look at her more closely, but the darkness was too great to\r\nshow her face. There was an intensity, almost of suppressed passion, in\r\nher voice that took me completely by surprise.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Joan,” I said, a little severely; “you know him well. He’s\r\nbeen with your father for months now.”\r\n\r\n“But that was in London; and up here it’s different--I mean, I feel\r\nthat it may be different. Life in a place like this blows away the\r\nrestraints of the artificial life at home. I know, oh, I know what I’m\r\nsaying. I feel all untied in a place like this; the rigidity of one’s\r\nnature begins to melt and flow. Surely _you_ must understand what I\r\nmean!”\r\n\r\n“Of course I understand,” I replied, yet not wishing to encourage her\r\nin her present line of thought, “and it’s a grand experience--for a\r\nshort time. But you’re overtired to-night, Joan, like the rest of us.\r\nA few days in this air will set you above all fears of the kind you\r\nmention.”\r\n\r\nThen, after a moment’s silence, I added, feeling I should estrange her\r\nconfidence altogether if I blundered any more and treated her like a\r\nchild--\r\n\r\n“I think, perhaps, the true explanation is that you pity him for loving\r\nyou, and at the same time you feel the repulsion of the healthy,\r\nvigorous animal for what is weak and timid. If he came up boldly and\r\ntook you by the throat and shouted that he would force you to love\r\nhim--well, then you would feel no fear at all. You would know exactly\r\nhow to deal with him. Isn’t it, perhaps, something of that kind?”\r\n\r\nThe girl made no reply, and when I took her hand I felt that it\r\ntrembled a little and was cold.\r\n\r\n“It’s not his love that I’m afraid of,” she said hurriedly, for at this\r\nmoment we heard the dip of a paddle in the water, “it’s something in\r\nhis very soul that terrifies me in a way I have never been terrified\r\nbefore,--yet fascinates me. In town I was hardly conscious of his\r\npresence. But the moment we got away from civilisation, it began to\r\ncome. He seems so--so _real_ up here. I dread being alone with him. It\r\nmakes me feel that something must burst and tear its way out--that he\r\nwould do something--or I should do something--I don’t know exactly what\r\nI mean, probably,--but that I should let myself go and scream----”\r\n\r\n“Joan!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed,” she laughed shortly; “I shan’t do anything silly,\r\nbut I wanted to tell you my feelings in case I needed your help. When\r\nI have intuitions as strong as this they are never wrong, only I don’t\r\nknow yet what it means exactly.”\r\n\r\n“You must hold out for the month, at any rate,” I said in as\r\nmatter-of-fact a voice as I could manage, for her manner had somehow\r\nchanged my surprise to a subtle sense of alarm. “Sangree only stays the\r\nmonth, you know. And, anyhow, you are such an odd creature yourself\r\nthat you should feel generously towards other odd creatures,” I ended\r\nlamely, with a forced laugh.\r\n\r\nShe gave my hand a sudden pressure. “I’m glad I’ve told you at any\r\nrate,” she said quickly under her breath, for the canoe was now gliding\r\nup silently like a ghost to our feet, “and I’m glad you’re here too,”\r\nshe added as we moved down towards the water to meet it.\r\n\r\nI made Sangree change into the bows and got into the steering seat\r\nmyself, putting the girl between us so that I could watch them both by\r\nkeeping their outlines against the sea and stars. For the intuitions\r\nof certain folk--women and children usually, I confess--I have always\r\nfelt a great respect that has more often than not been justified by\r\nexperience; and now the curious emotion stirred in me by the girl’s\r\nwords remained somewhat vividly in my consciousness. I explained it in\r\nsome measure by the fact that the girl, tired out by the fatigue of\r\nmany days’ travel, had suffered a vigorous reaction of some kind from\r\nthe strong, desolate scenery, and further, perhaps, that she had been\r\ntreated to my own experience of seeing the members of the party in a\r\nnew light--the Canadian, being partly a stranger, more vividly than the\r\nrest of us. But, at the same time, I felt it was quite possible that\r\nshe had sensed some subtle link between his personality and her own,\r\nsome quality that she had hitherto ignored and that the routine of town\r\nlife had kept buried out of sight. The only thing that seemed difficult\r\nto explain was the fear she had spoken of, and this I hoped the\r\nwholesome effects of camp-life and exercise would sweep away naturally\r\nin the course of time.\r\n\r\nWe made the tour of the island without speaking. It was all too\r\nbeautiful for speech. The trees crowded down to the shore to hear us\r\npass. We saw their fine dark heads, bowed low with splendid dignity\r\nto watch us, forgetting for a moment that the stars were caught in\r\nthe needled network of their hair. Against the sky in the west, where\r\nstill lingered the sunset gold, we saw the wild toss of the horizon,\r\nshaggy with forest and cliff, gripping the heart like the motive in\r\na symphony, and sending the sense of beauty all a-shiver through the\r\nmind--all these surrounding islands standing above the water like low\r\nclouds, and like them seeming to post along silently into the engulfing\r\nnight. We heard the musical drip-drip of the paddle, and the little\r\nwash of our waves on the shore, and then suddenly we found ourselves at\r\nthe opening of the lagoon again, having made the complete circuit of\r\nour home.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Timothy had awakened from sleep and was singing to\r\nhimself; and the sound of his voice as we glided down the fifty yards\r\nof enclosed water was pleasant to hear and undeniably wholesome. We saw\r\nthe glow of the fire up among the trees on the ridge, and his shadow\r\nmoving about as he threw on more wood.\r\n\r\n“There you are!” he called aloud. “Good again! Been setting the\r\nnight-lines, eh? Capital! And your mother’s still fast asleep, Joan.”\r\n\r\nHis cheery laugh floated across the water; he had not been in the least\r\ndisturbed by our absence, for old campers are not easily alarmed.\r\n\r\n“Now, remember,” he went on, after we had told our little tale of\r\ntravel by the fire, and Mrs. Maloney had asked for the fourth time\r\nexactly where her tent was and whether the door faced east or south,\r\n“every one takes their turn at cooking breakfast, and one of the men is\r\nalways out at sunrise to catch it first. Hubbard, I’ll toss you which\r\nyou do in the morning and which I do!” He lost the toss. “Then I’ll\r\ncatch it,” I said, laughing at his discomfiture, for I knew he loathed\r\nstirring porridge. “And mind you don’t burn it as you did every blessed\r\ntime last year on the Volga,” I added by way of reminder.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maloney’s fifth interruption about the door of her tent, and her\r\nfurther pointed observation that it was past nine o’clock, set us\r\nlighting lanterns and putting the fire out for safety.\r\n\r\nBut before we separated for the night the clergyman had a time-honoured\r\nlittle ritual of his own to go through that no one had the heart to\r\ndeny him. He always did this. It was a relic of his pulpit habits.\r\nHe glanced briefly from one to the other of us, his face grave and\r\nearnest, his hands lifted to the stars and his eyes all closed and\r\npuckered up beneath a momentary frown. Then he offered up a short,\r\nalmost inaudible prayer, thanking Heaven for our safe arrival, begging\r\nfor good weather, no illness or accidents, plenty of fish, and strong\r\nsailing winds.\r\n\r\nAnd then, unexpectedly--no one knew why exactly--he ended up with an\r\nabrupt request that nothing from the kingdom of darkness should be\r\nallowed to afflict our peace, and no evil thing come near to disturb us\r\nin the night-time.\r\n\r\nAnd while he uttered these last surprising words, so strangely unlike\r\nhis usual ending, it chanced that I looked up and let my eyes wander\r\nround the group assembled about the dying fire. And it certainly seemed\r\nto me that Sangree’s face underwent a sudden and visible alteration.\r\nHe was staring at Joan, and as he stared the change ran over it like a\r\nshadow and was gone. I started in spite of myself, for something oddly\r\nconcentrated, potent, collected, had come into the expression usually\r\nso scattered and feeble. But it was all swift as a passing meteor, and\r\nwhen I looked a second time his face was normal and he was looking\r\namong the trees.\r\n\r\nAnd Joan, luckily, had not observed him, her head being bowed and her\r\neyes tightly closed while her father prayed.\r\n\r\n“The girl has a vivid imagination indeed,” I thought, half laughing,\r\nas I lit the lanterns, “if her thoughts can put a glamour upon mine in\r\nthis way;” and yet somehow, when we said good-night, I took occasion to\r\ngive her a few vigorous words of encouragement, and went to her tent\r\nto make sure I could find it quickly in the night in case anything\r\nhappened. In her quick way the girl understood and thanked me, and\r\nthe last thing I heard as I moved off to the men’s quarters was Mrs.\r\nMaloney crying that there were beetles in her tent, and Joan’s laughter\r\nas she went to help her turn them out.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the island was silent as the grave, but for the\r\nmournful voices of the wind as it sighed up from the sea. Like white\r\nsentries stood the three tents of the men on one side of the ridge,\r\nand on the other side, half hidden by some birches, whose leaves just\r\nshivered as the breeze caught them, the women’s tents, patches of\r\nghostly grey, gathered more closely together for mutual shelter and\r\nprotection. Something like fifty yards of broken ground, grey rock,\r\nmoss and lichen, lay between, and over all lay the curtain of the night\r\nand the great whispering winds from the forests of Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nAnd the very last thing, just before floating away on that mighty\r\nwave that carries one so softly off into the deeps of forgetfulness,\r\nI again heard the voice of John Silence as the train moved out of\r\nVictoria Station; and by some subtle connection that met me on the very\r\nthreshold of consciousness there rose in my mind simultaneously the\r\nmemory of the girl’s half-given confidence, and of her distress. As by\r\nsome wizardry of approaching dreams they seemed in that instant to be\r\nrelated; but before I could analyse the why and the wherefore, both\r\nsank away out of sight again, and I was off beyond recall.\r\n\r\n“Unless you should send for me sooner.”\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhether Mrs. Maloney’s tent door opened south or east I think she\r\nnever discovered, for it is quite certain she always slept with the\r\nflap tightly fastened; I only know that my own little “five by seven,\r\nall silk” faced due east, because next morning the sun, pouring in as\r\nonly the wilderness sun knows how to pour, woke me early, and a moment\r\nlater, with a short run over soft moss and a flying dive from the\r\ngranite ledge, I was swimming in the most sparkling water imaginable.\r\n\r\nIt was barely four o’clock, and the sun came down a long vista of blue\r\nislands that led out to the open sea and Finland. Nearer by rose the\r\nwooded domes of our own property, still capped and wreathed with smoky\r\ntrails of fast-melting mist, and looking as fresh as though it was the\r\nmorning of Mrs. Maloney’s Sixth Day and they had just issued, clean and\r\nbrilliant, from the hands of the great Architect.\r\n\r\nIn the open spaces the ground was drenched with dew, and from the sea a\r\ncool salt wind stole in among the trees and set the branches trembling\r\nin an atmosphere of shimmering silver. The tents shone white where the\r\nsun caught them in patches. Below lay the lagoon, still dreaming of\r\nthe summer night; in the open the fish were jumping busily, sending\r\nmusical ripples towards the shore; and in the air hung the magic of\r\ndawn--silent, incommunicable.\r\n\r\nI lit the fire, so that an hour later the clergyman should find good\r\nashes to stir his porridge over, and then set forth upon an examination\r\nof the island, but hardly had I gone a dozen yards when I saw a figure\r\nstanding a little in front of me where the sunlight fell in a pool\r\namong the trees.\r\n\r\nIt was Joan. She had already been up an hour, she told me, and had\r\nbathed before the last stars had left the sky. I saw at once that the\r\nnew spirit of this solitary region had entered into her, banishing the\r\nfears of the night, for her face was like the face of a happy denizen\r\nof the wilderness, and her eyes stainless and shining. Her feet were\r\nbare, and drops of dew she had shaken from the branches hung in her\r\nloose-flying hair. Obviously she had come into her own.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been all over the island,” she announced laughingly, “and there\r\nare two things wanting.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a good judge, Joan. What are they?”\r\n\r\n“There’s no animal life, and there’s no--water.”\r\n\r\n“They go together,” I said. “Animals don’t bother with a rock like this\r\nunless there’s a spring on it.”\r\n\r\nAnd as she led me from place to place, happy and excited, leaping\r\nadroitly from rock to rock, I was glad to note that my first\r\nimpressions were correct. She made no reference to our conversation of\r\nthe night before. The new spirit had driven out the old. There was no\r\nroom in her heart for fear or anxiety, and Nature had everything her\r\nown way.\r\n\r\nThe island, we found, was some three-quarters of a mile from point\r\nto point, built in a circle, or wide horseshoe, with an opening of\r\ntwenty feet at the mouth of the lagoon. Pine-trees grew thickly all\r\nover, but here and there were patches of silver birch, scrub oak, and\r\nconsiderable colonies of wild raspberry and gooseberry bushes. The two\r\nends of the horseshoe formed bare slabs of smooth granite running into\r\nthe sea and forming dangerous reefs just below the surface, but the\r\nrest of the island rose in a forty-foot ridge and sloped down steeply\r\nto the sea on either side, being nowhere more than a hundred yards wide.\r\n\r\nThe outer shore-line was much indented with numberless coves and bays\r\nand sandy beaches, with here and there caves and precipitous little\r\ncliffs against which the sea broke in spray and thunder. But the inner\r\nshore, the shore of the lagoon, was low and regular, and so well\r\nprotected by the wall of trees along the ridge that no storm could ever\r\nsend more than a passing ripple along its sandy marges. Eternal shelter\r\nreigned there.\r\n\r\nOn one of the other islands, a few hundred yards away--for the rest of\r\nthe party slept late this first morning, and we took to the canoe--we\r\ndiscovered a spring of fresh water untainted by the brackish flavour of\r\nthe Baltic, and having thus solved the most important problem of the\r\nCamp, we next proceeded to deal with the second--fish. And in half an\r\nhour we reeled in and turned homewards, for we had no means of storage,\r\nand to clean more fish than may be stored or eaten in a day is no wise\r\noccupation for experienced campers.\r\n\r\nAnd as we landed towards six o’clock we heard the clergyman singing as\r\nusual and saw his wife and Sangree shaking out their blankets in the\r\nsun, and dressed in a fashion that finally dispelled all memories of\r\nstreets and civilisation.\r\n\r\n“The Little People lit the fire for me,” cried Maloney, looking natural\r\nand at home in his ancient flannel suit and breaking off in the middle\r\nof his singing, “so I’ve got the porridge going--and this time it’s\r\n_not_ burnt.”\r\n\r\nWe reported the discovery of water and held up the fish.\r\n\r\n“Good! Good again!” he cried. “We’ll have the first decent breakfast\r\nwe’ve had this year. Sangree’ll clean ’em in no time, and the Bo’sun’s\r\nMate----”\r\n\r\n“Will fry them to a turn,” laughed the voice of Mrs. Maloney, appearing\r\non the scene in a tight blue jersey and sandals, and catching up the\r\nfrying-pan. Her husband always called her the Bo’sun’s Mate in Camp,\r\nbecause it was her duty, among others, to pipe all hands to meals.\r\n\r\n“And as for you, Joan,” went on the happy man, “you look like the\r\nspirit of the island, with moss in your hair and wind in your eyes,\r\nand sun and stars mixed in your face.” He looked at her with delighted\r\nadmiration. “Here, Sangree, take these twelve, there’s a good fellow,\r\nthey’re the biggest; and we’ll have ’em in butter in less time than you\r\ncan say Baltic island!”\r\n\r\nI watched the Canadian as he slowly moved off to the cleaning pail.\r\nHis eyes were drinking in the girl’s beauty, and a wave of passionate,\r\nalmost feverish, joy passed over his face, expressive of the ecstasy of\r\ntrue worship more than anything else. Perhaps he was thinking that he\r\nstill had three weeks to come with that vision always before his eyes;\r\nperhaps he was thinking of his dreams in the night. I cannot say. But\r\nI noticed the curious mingling of yearning and happiness in his eyes,\r\nand the strength of the impression touched my curiosity. Something in\r\nhis face held my gaze for a second, something to do with its intensity.\r\nThat so timid, so gentle a personality should conceal so virile a\r\npassion almost seemed to require explanation.\r\n\r\nBut the impression was momentary, for that first breakfast in Camp\r\npermitted no divided attentions, and I dare swear that the porridge,\r\nthe tea, the Swedish “flatbread,” and the fried fish flavoured with\r\npoints of frizzled bacon, were better than any meal eaten elsewhere\r\nthat day in the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe first clear day in a new camp is always a furiously busy one, and\r\nwe soon dropped into the routine upon which in large measure the real\r\ncomfort of every one depends. About the cooking-fire, greatly improved\r\nwith stones from the shore, we built a high stockade consisting of\r\nupright poles thickly twined with branches, the roof lined with moss\r\nand lichen and weighted with rocks, and round the interior we made low\r\nwooden seats so that we could lie round the fire even in rain and eat\r\nour meals in peace. Paths, too, outlined themselves from tent to tent,\r\nfrom the bathing places and the landing stage, and a fair division of\r\nthe island was decided upon between the quarters of the men and the\r\nwomen. Wood was stacked, awkward trees and boulders removed, hammocks\r\nslung, and tents strengthened. In a word, Camp was established, and\r\nduties were assigned and accepted as though we expected to live on\r\nthis Baltic island for years to come and the smallest detail of the\r\nCommunity life was important.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as the Camp came into being, this sense of a community\r\ndeveloped, proving that we were a definite whole, and not merely\r\nseparate human beings living for a while in tents upon a desert island.\r\nEach fell willingly into the routine. Sangree, as by natural selection,\r\ntook upon himself the cleaning of the fish and the cutting of the wood\r\ninto lengths sufficient for a day’s use. And he did it well. The pan\r\nof water was never without a fish, cleaned and scaled, ready to fry\r\nfor whoever was hungry; the nightly fire never died down for lack of\r\nmaterial to throw on without going farther afield to search.\r\n\r\nAnd Timothy, once reverend, caught the fish and chopped down the\r\ntrees. He also assumed responsibility for the condition of the boat,\r\nand did it so thoroughly that nothing in the little cutter was ever\r\nfound wanting. And when, for any reason, his presence was in demand,\r\nthe first place to look for him was--in the boat, and there, too, he\r\nwas usually found, tinkering away with sheets, sails, or rudder and\r\nsinging as he tinkered.\r\n\r\nNor was the “reading” neglected; for most mornings there came a sound\r\nof droning voices from the white tent by the raspberry bushes, which\r\nsignified that Sangree, the tutor, and whatever other man chanced to be\r\nin the party at the time, were hard at it with history or the classics.\r\n\r\nAnd while Mrs. Maloney, also by natural selection, took charge of\r\nthe larder and the kitchen, the mending and general supervision of\r\nthe rough comforts, she also made herself peculiarly mistress of the\r\nmegaphone which summoned to meals and carried her voice easily from one\r\nend of the island to the other; and in her hours of leisure she daubed\r\nthe surrounding scenery on to a sketching block with all the honesty\r\nand devotion of her determined but unreceptive soul.\r\n\r\nJoan, meanwhile, Joan, elusive creature of the wilds, became I know\r\nnot exactly what. She did plenty of work in the Camp, yet seemed to\r\nhave no very precise duties. She was everywhere and anywhere. Sometimes\r\nshe slept in her tent, sometimes under the stars with a blanket. She\r\nknew every inch of the island and kept turning up in places where she\r\nwas least expected--for ever wandering about, reading her books in\r\nsheltered corners, making little fires on sunless days to “worship by\r\nto the gods,” as she put it, ever finding new pools to dive and bathe\r\nin, and swimming day and night in the warm and waveless lagoon like a\r\nfish in a huge tank. She went bare-legged and bare-footed, with her\r\nhair down and her skirts caught up to the knees, and if ever a human\r\nbeing turned into a jolly savage within the compass of a single week,\r\nJoan Maloney was certainly that human being. She ran wild.\r\n\r\nSo completely, too, was she possessed by the strong spirit of the\r\nplace that the little human fear she had yielded to so strangely on\r\nour arrival seemed to have been utterly dispossessed. As I hoped and\r\nexpected, she made no reference to our conversation of the first\r\nevening. Sangree bothered her with no special attentions, and after\r\nall they were very little together. His behaviour was perfect in that\r\nrespect, and I, for my part, hardly gave the matter another thought.\r\nJoan was ever a prey to vivid fancies of one kind or another, and this\r\nwas one of them. Mercifully for the happiness of all concerned, it had\r\nmelted away before the spirit of busy, active life and deep content\r\nthat reigned over the island. Every one was intensely alive, and peace\r\nwas upon all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the effect of the camp-life began to tell. Always a searching\r\ntest of character, its results, sooner or later, are infallible, for\r\nit acts upon the soul as swiftly and surely as the hypo bath upon the\r\nnegative of a photograph. A readjustment of the personal forces takes\r\nplace quickly; some parts of the personality go to sleep, others wake\r\nup: but the first sweeping change that the primitive life brings about\r\nis that the artificial portions of the character shed themselves one\r\nafter another like dead skins. Attitudes and poses that seemed genuine\r\nin the city, drop away. The mind, like the body, grows quickly hard,\r\nsimple, uncomplex. And in a camp as primitive and close to nature as\r\nours was, these effects became speedily visible.\r\n\r\nSome folk, of course, who talk glibly about the simple life when it\r\nis safely out of reach, betray themselves in camp by for ever peering\r\nabout for the artificial excitements of civilisation which they miss.\r\nSome get bored at once; some grow slovenly; some reveal the animal in\r\nmost unexpected fashion; and some, the select few, find themselves in\r\nvery short order and are happy.\r\n\r\nAnd, in our little party, we could flatter ourselves that we all\r\nbelonged to the last category, so far as the general effect was\r\nconcerned. Only there were certain other changes as well, varying with\r\neach individual, and all interesting to note.\r\n\r\nIt was only after the first week or two that these changes became\r\nmarked, although this is the proper place, I think, to speak of them.\r\nFor, having myself no other duty than to enjoy a well-earned holiday,\r\nI used to load my canoe with blankets and provisions and journey forth\r\non exploration trips among the islands of several days together; and\r\nit was on my return from the first of these--when I rediscovered the\r\nparty, so to speak--that these changes first presented themselves\r\nvividly to me, and in one particular instance produced a rather curious\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nIn a word, then, while every one had grown wilder, naturally wilder,\r\nSangree, it seemed to me, had grown much wilder, and what I can only\r\ncall unnaturally wilder. He made me think of a savage.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, he had changed immensely in mere physical appearance,\r\nand the full brown cheeks, the brighter eyes of absolute health, and\r\nthe general air of vigour and robustness that had come to replace his\r\ncustomary lassitude and timidity, had worked such an improvement that I\r\nhardly knew him for the same man. His voice, too, was deeper and his\r\nmanner bespoke for the first time a greater measure of confidence in\r\nhimself. He now had some claims to be called nice-looking, or at least\r\nto a certain air of virility that would not lessen his value in the\r\neyes of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, was natural enough, and most welcome. But,\r\naltogether apart from this physical change, which no doubt had also\r\nbeen going forward in the rest of us, there was a subtle note in his\r\npersonality that came to me with a degree of surprise that almost\r\namounted to shock.\r\n\r\nAnd two things--as he came down to welcome me and pull up the\r\ncanoe--leaped up in my mind unbidden, as though connected in some way\r\nI could not at the moment divine--first, the curious judgment formed\r\nof him by Joan; and secondly, that fugitive expression I had caught in\r\nhis face while Maloney was offering up his strange prayer for special\r\nprotection from Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe delicacy of manner and feature--to call it by no milder term--which\r\nhad always been a distinguishing characteristic of the man, had been\r\nreplaced by something far more vigorous and decided, that yet utterly\r\neluded analysis. The change which impressed me so oddly was not easy\r\nto name. The others--singing Maloney, the bustling Bo’sun’s Mate, and\r\nJoan, that fascinating half-breed of undine and salamander--all showed\r\nthe effects of a life so close to nature; but in their case the change\r\nwas perfectly natural and what was to be expected, whereas with Peter\r\nSangree, the Canadian, it was something unusual and unexpected.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to explain how he managed gradually to convey to my\r\nmind the impression that something in him had turned savage, yet this,\r\nmore or less, is the impression that he did convey. It was not that\r\nhe seemed really less civilised, or that his character had undergone\r\nany definite alteration, but rather that something in him, hitherto\r\ndormant, had awakened to life. Some quality, latent till now--so\r\nfar, at least, as we were concerned, who, after all, knew him but\r\nslightly--had stirred into activity and risen to the surface of his\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nAnd while, for the moment, this seemed as far as I could get, it was\r\nbut natural that my mind should continue the intuitive process and\r\nacknowledge that John Silence, owing to his peculiar faculties, and the\r\ngirl, owing to her singularly receptive temperament, might each in a\r\ndifferent way have divined this latent quality in his soul, and feared\r\nits manifestation later.\r\n\r\nOn looking back to this painful adventure, too, it now seems equally\r\nnatural that the same process, carried to its logical conclusion,\r\nshould have wakened some deep instinct in me that, wholly without\r\ndirection from my will, set itself sharply and persistently upon the\r\nwatch from that very moment. Thenceforward the personality of Sangree\r\nwas never far from my thoughts, and I was for ever analysing and\r\nsearching for the explanation that took so long in coming.\r\n\r\n“I declare, Hubbard, you’re tanned like an aboriginal, and you look\r\nlike one, too,” laughed Maloney.\r\n\r\n“And I can return the compliment,” was my reply, as we all gathered\r\nround a brew of tea to exchange news and compare notes.\r\n\r\nAnd later, at supper, it amused me to observe that the distinguished\r\ntutor, once clergyman, did not eat his food quite as “nicely” as he did\r\nat home--he devoured it; that Mrs. Maloney ate more, and, to say the\r\nleast, with less delay, than was her custom in the select atmosphere\r\nof her English dining-room; and that while Joan attacked her tin\r\nplateful with genuine avidity, Sangree, the Canadian, bit and gnawed\r\nat his, laughing and talking and complimenting the cook all the while,\r\nand making me think with secret amusement of a starved animal at its\r\nfirst meal. While, from their remarks about myself, I judged that I had\r\nchanged and grown wild as much as the rest of them.\r\n\r\nIn this and in a hundred other little ways the change showed, ways\r\ndifficult to define in detail, but all proving--not the coarsening\r\neffect of leading the primitive life, but, let us say, the more direct\r\nand unvarnished methods that became prevalent. For all day long we\r\nwere in the bath of the elements--wind, water, sun--and just as the\r\nbody became insensible to cold and shed unnecessary clothing, the mind\r\ngrew straightforward and shed many of the disguises required by the\r\nconventions of civilisation.\r\n\r\nAnd in each, according to temperament and character, there stirred the\r\nlife-instincts that were natural, untamed, and, in a sense--savage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSo it came about that I stayed with our island party, putting off\r\nmy second exploring trip from day to day, and I think that this\r\nfar-fetched instinct to watch Sangree was really the cause of my\r\npostponement.\r\n\r\nFor another ten days the life of the Camp pursued its even and\r\ndelightful way, blessed by perfect summer weather, a good harvest\r\nof fish, fine winds for sailing, and calm, starry nights. Maloney’s\r\nselfish prayer had been favourably received. Nothing came to disturb\r\nor perplex. There was not even the prowling of night animals to vex\r\nthe rest of Mrs. Maloney; for in previous camps it had often been her\r\npeculiar affliction that she heard the porcupines scratching against\r\nthe canvas, or the squirrels dropping fir-cones in the early morning\r\nwith a sound of miniature thunder upon the roof of her tent. But on\r\nthis island there was not even a squirrel or a mouse. I think two toads\r\nand a small and harmless snake were the only living creatures that had\r\nbeen discovered during the whole of the first fortnight. And these two\r\ntoads in all probability were not two toads, but one toad.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, came the terror that changed the whole aspect of the\r\nplace--the devastating terror.\r\n\r\nIt came, at first, gently, but from the very start it made me realise\r\nthe unpleasant loneliness of our situation, our remote isolation in\r\nthis wilderness of sea and rock, and how the islands in this tideless\r\nBaltic ocean lay about us like the advance guard of a vast besieging\r\narmy. Its entry, as I say, was gentle, hardly noticeable, in fact,\r\nto most of us: singularly undramatic it certainly was. But, then, in\r\nactual life this is often the way the dreadful climaxes move upon us,\r\nleaving the heart undisturbed almost to the last minute, and then\r\noverwhelming it with a sudden rush of horror. For it was the custom at\r\nbreakfast to listen patiently while each in turn related the trivial\r\nadventures of the night--how they slept, whether the wind shook their\r\ntent, whether the spider on the ridge pole had moved, whether they had\r\nheard the toad, and so forth--and on this particular morning Joan, in\r\nthe middle of a little pause, made a truly novel announcement:\r\n\r\n“In the night I heard the howling of a dog,” she said, and then flushed\r\nup to the roots of her hair when we burst out laughing. For the idea\r\nof there being a dog on this forsaken island that was only able to\r\nsupport a snake and two toads was distinctly ludicrous, and I remember\r\nMaloney, half-way through his burnt porridge, capping the announcement\r\nby declaring that he had heard a “Baltic turtle” in the lagoon, and his\r\nwife’s expression of frantic alarm before the laughter undeceived her.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning Joan repeated the story with additional and\r\nconvincing detail.\r\n\r\n“Sounds of whining and growling woke me,” she said, “and I distinctly\r\nheard sniffing under my tent, and the scratching of paws.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Timothy! Can it be a porcupine?” exclaimed the Bo’sun’s Mate with\r\ndistress, forgetting that Sweden was not Canada.\r\n\r\nBut the girl’s voice had sounded to me in quite another key, and\r\nlooking up I saw that her father and Sangree were staring at her hard.\r\nThey, too, understood that she was in earnest, and had been struck by\r\nthe serious note in her voice.\r\n\r\n“Rubbish, Joan! You are always dreaming something or other wild,” her\r\nfather said a little impatiently.\r\n\r\n“There’s not an animal of any size on the whole island,” added Sangree\r\nwith a puzzled expression. He never took his eyes from her face.\r\n\r\n“But there’s nothing to prevent one swimming over,” I put in briskly,\r\nfor somehow a sense of uneasiness that was not pleasant had woven\r\nitself into the talk and pauses. “A deer, for instance, might easily\r\nland in the night and take a look round----”\r\n\r\n“Or a bear!” gasped the Bo’sun’s Mate, with a look so portentous that\r\nwe all welcomed the laugh.\r\n\r\nBut Joan did not laugh. Instead, she sprang up and called to us to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n“There,” she said, pointing to the ground by her tent on the side\r\nfarthest from her mother’s; “there are the marks close to my head. You\r\ncan see for yourselves.”\r\n\r\nWe saw plainly. The moss and lichen--for earth there was hardly\r\nany--had been scratched up by paws. An animal about the size of a large\r\ndog it must have been, to judge by the marks. We stood and stared in a\r\nrow.\r\n\r\n“Close to my head,” repeated the girl, looking round at us. Her face,\r\nI noticed, was very pale, and her lip seemed to quiver for an instant.\r\nThen she gave a sudden gulp--and burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing had come about in the brief space of a few minutes, and\r\nwith a curious sense of inevitableness, moreover, as though it had all\r\nbeen carefully planned from all time and nothing could have stopped it.\r\nIt had all been rehearsed before--had actually happened before, as the\r\nstrange feeling sometimes has it; it seemed like the opening movement\r\nin some ominous drama, and that I knew exactly what would happen next.\r\nSomething of great moment was impending.\r\n\r\nFor this sinister sensation of coming disaster made itself felt from\r\nthe very beginning, and an atmosphere of gloom and dismay pervaded the\r\nentire Camp from that moment forward.\r\n\r\nI drew Sangree to one side and moved away, while Maloney took the\r\ndistressed girl into her tent, and his wife followed them, energetic\r\nand greatly flustered.\r\n\r\nFor thus, in undramatic fashion, it was that the terror I have\r\nspoken of first attempted the invasion of our Camp, and, trivial and\r\nunimportant though it seemed, every little detail of this opening scene\r\nis photographed upon my mind with merciless accuracy and precision.\r\nIt happened exactly as described. This was exactly the language used.\r\nI see it written before me in black and white. I see, too, the faces\r\nof all concerned with the sudden ugly signature of alarm where before\r\nhad been peace. The terror had stretched out, so to speak, a first\r\ntentative feeler towards us and had touched the hearts of each with a\r\nhorrid directness. And from this moment the Camp changed.\r\n\r\nSangree in particular was visibly upset. He could not bear to see the\r\ngirl distressed, and to hear her actually cry was almost more than he\r\ncould stand. The feeling that he had no right to protect her hurt him\r\nkeenly, and I could see that he was itching to do something to help,\r\nand liked him for it. His expression said plainly that he would tear in\r\na thousand pieces anything that dared to injure a hair of her head.\r\n\r\nWe lit our pipes and strolled over in silence to the men’s quarters,\r\nand it was his odd Canadian expression “Gee whiz!” that drew my\r\nattention to a further discovery.\r\n\r\n“The brute’s been scratching round my tent too,” he cried, as he\r\npointed to similar marks by the door and I stooped down to examine\r\nthem. We both stared in amazement for several minutes without speaking.\r\n\r\n“Only I sleep like the dead,” he added, straightening up again, “and so\r\nheard nothing, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nWe traced the paw-marks from the mouth of his tent in a direct line\r\nacross to the girl’s, but nowhere else about the Camp was there a\r\nsign of the strange visitor. The deer, dog, or whatever it was that\r\nhad twice favoured us with a visit in the night, had confined its\r\nattentions to these two tents. And, after all, there was really\r\nnothing out of the way about these visits of an unknown animal, for\r\nalthough our own island was destitute of life, we were in the heart\r\nof a wilderness, and the mainland and larger islands must be swarming\r\nwith all kinds of four-footed creatures, and no very prolonged swimming\r\nwas necessary to reach us. In any other country it would not have\r\ncaused a moment’s interest--interest of the kind we felt, that is.\r\nIn our Canadian camps the bears were for ever grunting about among\r\nthe provision bags at night, porcupines scratching unceasingly, and\r\nchipmunks scuttling over everything.\r\n\r\n“My daughter is overtired, and that’s the truth of it,” explained\r\nMaloney presently when he rejoined us and had examined in turn the\r\nother paw-marks. “She’s been overdoing it lately, and camp-life, you\r\nknow, always means a great excitement to her. It’s natural enough. If\r\nwe take no notice she’ll be all right.” He paused to borrow my tobacco\r\npouch and fill his pipe, and the blundering way he filled it and\r\nspilled the precious weed on the ground visibly belied the calm of his\r\neasy language. “You might take her out for a bit of fishing, Hubbard,\r\nlike a good chap; she’s hardly up to the long day in the cutter. Show\r\nher some of the other islands in your canoe, perhaps. Eh?”\r\n\r\nAnd by lunch-time the cloud had passed away as suddenly, and as\r\nsuspiciously, as it had come.\r\n\r\nBut in the canoe, on our way home, having till then purposely ignored\r\nthe subject uppermost in our minds, she suddenly spoke to me in a way\r\nthat again touched the note of sinister alarm--the note that kept on\r\nsounding and sounding until finally John Silence came with his great\r\nvibrating presence and relieved it; yes, and even after he came, too,\r\nfor a while.\r\n\r\n“I’m ashamed to ask it,” she said abruptly, as she steered me home,\r\nher sleeves rolled up, her hair blowing in the wind, “and ashamed of\r\nmy silly tears too, because I really can’t make out what caused them;\r\nbut, Mr. Hubbard, I want you to promise me not to go off for your long\r\nexpeditions--just yet. I beg it of you.” She was so in earnest that\r\nshe forgot the canoe, and the wind caught it sideways and made us roll\r\ndangerously. “I have tried hard not to ask this,” she added, bringing\r\nthe canoe round again, “but I simply can’t help myself.”\r\n\r\nIt was a good deal to ask, and I suppose my hesitation was plain; for\r\nshe went on before I could reply, and her beseeching expression and\r\nintensity of manner impressed me very forcibly.\r\n\r\n“For another two weeks only----”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sangree leaves in a fortnight,” I said, seeing at once what she\r\nwas driving at, but wondering if it was best to encourage her or not.\r\n\r\n“If I knew you were to be on the island till then,” she said, her face\r\nalternately pale and blushing, and her voice trembling a little, “I\r\nshould feel so much happier.”\r\n\r\nI looked at her steadily, waiting for her to finish.\r\n\r\n“And safer,” she added almost in a whisper; “especially--at night, I\r\nmean.”\r\n\r\n“Safer, Joan?” I repeated, thinking I had never seen her eyes so soft\r\nand tender. She nodded her head, keeping her gaze fixed on my face.\r\n\r\nIt was really difficult to refuse, whatever my thoughts and judgment\r\nmay have been, and somehow I understood that she spoke with good\r\nreason, though for the life of me I could not have put it into words.\r\n\r\n“Happier--and safer,” she said gravely, the canoe giving a dangerous\r\nlurch as she leaned forward in her seat to catch my answer. Perhaps,\r\nafter all, the wisest way was to grant her request and make light of\r\nit, easing her anxiety without too much encouraging its cause.\r\n\r\n“All right, Joan, you queer creature; I promise,” and the instant look\r\nof relief in her face, and the smile that came back like sunlight to\r\nher eyes, made me feel that, unknown to myself and the world, I was\r\ncapable of considerable sacrifice after all.\r\n\r\n“But, you know, there’s nothing to be afraid of,” I added sharply; and\r\nshe looked up in my face with the smile women use when they know we are\r\ntalking idly, yet do not wish to tell us so.\r\n\r\n“_You_ don’t feel afraid, I know,” she observed quietly.\r\n\r\n“Of course not; why should I?”\r\n\r\n“So, if you will just humour me this once I--I will never ask anything\r\nfoolish of you again as long as I live,” she said gratefully.\r\n\r\n“You have my promise,” was all I could find to say.\r\n\r\nShe headed the nose of the canoe for the lagoon lying a quarter of a\r\nmile ahead, and paddled swiftly; but a minute or two later she paused\r\nagain and stared hard at me with the dripping paddle across the thwarts.\r\n\r\n“You’ve not heard anything at night yourself, have you?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I never hear anything at night,” I replied shortly, “from the moment I\r\nlie down till the moment I get up.”\r\n\r\n“That dismal howling, for instance,” she went on, determined to get\r\nit out, “far away at first and then getting closer, and stopping just\r\noutside the Camp?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not.”\r\n\r\n“Because, sometimes I think I almost dreamed it.”\r\n\r\n“Most likely you did,” was my unsympathetic response.\r\n\r\n“And you don’t think father has heard it either, then?”\r\n\r\n“No. He would have told me if he had.”\r\n\r\nThis seemed to relieve her mind a little. “I know mother hasn’t,” she\r\nadded, as if speaking to herself, “for she hears nothing--ever.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was two nights after this conversation that I woke out of deep\r\nsleep and heard sounds of screaming. The voice was really horrible,\r\nbreaking the peace and silence with its shrill clamour. In less than\r\nten seconds I was half dressed and out of my tent. The screaming had\r\nstopped abruptly, but I knew the general direction, and ran as fast as\r\nthe darkness would allow over to the women’s quarters, and on getting\r\nclose I heard sounds of suppressed weeping. It was Joan’s voice. And\r\njust as I came up I saw Mrs. Maloney, marvellously attired, fumbling\r\nwith a lantern. Other voices became audible in the same moment behind\r\nme, and Timothy Maloney arrived, breathless, less than half dressed,\r\nand carrying another lantern that had gone out on the way from being\r\nbanged against a tree. Dawn was just breaking, and a chill wind blew in\r\nfrom the sea. Heavy black clouds drove low overhead.\r\n\r\nThe scene of confusion may be better imagined than described. Questions\r\nin frightened voices filled the air against this background of\r\nsuppressed weeping. Briefly--Joan’s silk tent had been torn, and the\r\ngirl was in a state bordering upon hysterics. Somewhat reassured by\r\nour noisy presence, however,--for she was plucky at heart,--she pulled\r\nherself together and tried to explain what had happened; and her broken\r\nwords, told there on the edge of night and morning upon this wild\r\nisland ridge, were oddly thrilling and distressingly convincing.\r\n\r\n“Something touched me and I woke,” she said simply, but in a voice\r\nstill hushed and broken with the terror of it, “something pushing\r\nagainst the tent; I felt it through the canvas. There was the same\r\nsniffing and scratching as before, and I felt the tent give a little\r\nas when wind shakes it. I heard breathing--very loud, very heavy\r\nbreathing--and then came a sudden great tearing blow, and the canvas\r\nripped open close to my face.”\r\n\r\nShe had instantly dashed out through the open flap and screamed at\r\nthe top of her voice, thinking the creature had actually got into the\r\ntent. But nothing was visible, she declared, and she heard not the\r\nfaintest sound of an animal making off under cover of the darkness.\r\nThe brief account seemed to exercise a paralysing effect upon us all\r\nas we listened to it. I can see the dishevelled group to this day, the\r\nwind blowing the women’s hair, and Maloney craning his head forward to\r\nlisten, and his wife, open-mouthed and gasping, leaning against a pine\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n“Come over to the stockade and we’ll get the fire going,” I said;\r\n“that’s the first thing,” for we were all shaking with the cold in\r\nour scanty garments. And at that moment Sangree arrived wrapped in a\r\nblanket and carrying his gun; he was still drunken with sleep.\r\n\r\n“The dog again,” Maloney explained briefly, forestalling his questions;\r\n“been at Joan’s tent. Torn it, by Gad! this time. It’s time we did\r\nsomething.” He went on mumbling confusedly to himself.\r\n\r\nSangree gripped his gun and looked about swiftly in the darkness. I\r\nsaw his eyes flame in the glare of the flickering lanterns. He made a\r\nmovement as though to start out and hunt--and kill. Then his glance\r\nfell on the girl crouching on the ground, her face hidden in her\r\nhands, and there leaped into his features an expression of savage\r\nanger that transformed them. He could have faced a dozen lions with a\r\nwalking-stick at that moment, and again I liked him for the strength of\r\nhis anger, his self-control, and his hopeless devotion.\r\n\r\nBut I stopped him going off on a blind and useless chase.\r\n\r\n“Come and help me start the fire, Sangree,” I said, anxious also to\r\nrelieve the girl of our presence; and a few minutes later the ashes,\r\nstill glowing from the night’s fire, had kindled the fresh wood,\r\nand there was a blaze that warmed us well while it also lit up the\r\nsurrounding trees within a radius of twenty yards.\r\n\r\n“I heard nothing,” he whispered; “what in the world do you think it is?\r\nIt surely can’t be only a dog!”\r\n\r\n“We’ll find that out later,” I said, as the others came up to the\r\ngrateful warmth; “the first thing is to make as big a fire as we can.”\r\n\r\nJoan was calmer now, and her mother had put on some warmer, and less\r\nmiraculous, garments. And while they stood talking in low voices\r\nMaloney and I slipped off to examine the tent. There was little enough\r\nto see, but that little was unmistakable. Some animal had scratched up\r\nthe ground at the head of the tent, and with a great blow of a powerful\r\npaw--a paw clearly provided with good claws--had struck the silk and\r\ntorn it open. There was a hole large enough to pass a fist and arm\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n“It can’t be far away,” Maloney said excitedly. “We’ll organise a hunt\r\nat once; this very minute.”\r\n\r\nWe hurried back to the fire, Maloney talking boisterously about his\r\nproposed hunt. “There’s nothing like prompt action to dispel alarm,” he\r\nwhispered in my ear; and then turned to the rest of us.\r\n\r\n“We’ll hunt the island from end to end at once,” he said, with\r\nexcitement; “that’s what we’ll do. The beast can’t be far away. And the\r\nBosun’s Mate and Joan must come too, because they can’t be left alone.\r\nHubbard, you take the right shore, and you, Sangree, the left, and\r\nI’ll go in the middle with the women. In this way we can stretch clean\r\nacross the ridge, and nothing bigger than a rabbit can possibly escape\r\nus.” He was extraordinarily excited, I thought. Anything affecting\r\nJoan, of course, stirred him prodigiously. “Get your guns and we’ll\r\nstart the drive at once,” he cried. He lit another lantern and handed\r\none each to his wife and Joan, and while I ran to fetch my gun I heard\r\nhim singing to himself with the excitement of it all.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the dawn had come on quickly. It made the flickering lanterns\r\nlook pale. The wind, too, was rising, and I heard the trees moaning\r\noverhead and the waves breaking with increasing clamour on the shore.\r\nIn the lagoon the boat dipped and splashed, and the sparks from the\r\nfire were carried aloft in a stream and scattered far and wide.\r\n\r\nWe made our way to the extreme end of the island, measured our\r\ndistances carefully, and then began to advance. None of us spoke.\r\nSangree and I, with cocked guns, watched the shore lines, and all\r\nwithin easy touch and speaking distance. It was a slow and blundering\r\ndrive, and there were many false alarms, but after the best part of\r\nhalf an hour we stood on the farther end, having made the complete\r\ntour, and without putting up so much as a squirrel. Certainly there was\r\nno living creature on that island but ourselves.\r\n\r\n“_I_ know what it is!” cried Maloney, looking out over the dim expanse\r\nof grey sea, and speaking with the air of a man making a discovery;\r\n“it’s a dog from one of the farms on the larger islands”--he pointed\r\nseawards where the archipelago thickened--“and it’s escaped and turned\r\nwild. Our fires and voices attracted it, and it’s probably half starved\r\nas well as savage, poor brute!”\r\n\r\nNo one said anything in reply, and he began to sing again very low to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe point where we stood--a huddled, shivering group--faced the wider\r\nchannels that led to the open sea and Finland. The grey dawn had broken\r\nin earnest at last, and we could see the racing waves with their angry\r\ncrests of white. The surrounding islands showed up as dark masses\r\nin the distance, and in the east, almost as Maloney spoke, the sun\r\ncame up with a rush in a stormy and magnificent sky of red and gold.\r\nAgainst this splashed and gorgeous background black clouds, shaped\r\nlike fantastic and legendary animals, filed past swiftly in a tearing\r\nstream, and to this day I have only to close my eyes to see again that\r\nvivid and hurrying procession in the air. All about us the pines made\r\nblack splashes against the sky. It was an angry sunrise. Rain, indeed,\r\nhad already begun to fall in big drops.\r\n\r\nWe turned, as by a common instinct, and, without speech, made our way\r\nback slowly to the stockade, Maloney humming snatches of his songs,\r\nSangree in front with his gun, prepared to shoot at a moment’s notice,\r\nand the women floundering in the rear with myself and the extinguished\r\nlanterns.\r\n\r\nYet it was only a dog!\r\n\r\nReally, it was most singular when one came to reflect soberly upon\r\nit all. Events, say the occultists, have souls, or at least that\r\nagglomerate life due to the emotions and thoughts of all concerned\r\nin them, so that cities, and even whole countries, have great\r\nastral shapes which may become visible to the eye of vision; and\r\ncertainly here, the soul of this drive--this vain, blundering, futile\r\ndrive--stood somewhere between ourselves and--laughed.\r\n\r\nAll of us heard that laugh, and all of us tried hard to smother the\r\nsound, or at least to ignore it. Every one talked at once, loudly, and\r\nwith exaggerated decision, obviously trying to say something plausible\r\nagainst heavy odds, striving to explain naturally that an animal might\r\nso easily conceal itself from us, or swim away before we had time to\r\nlight upon its trail. For we all spoke of that “trail” as though it\r\nreally existed, and we had more to go upon than the mere marks of\r\npaws about the tents of Joan and the Canadian. Indeed, but for these,\r\nand the torn tent, I think it would, of course, have been possible to\r\nignore the existence of this beast intruder altogether.\r\n\r\nAnd it was here, under this angry dawn, as we stood in the shelter of\r\nthe stockade from the pouring rain, weary yet so strangely excited--it\r\nwas here, out of this confusion of voices and explanations, that--very\r\nstealthily--the ghost of something horrible slipped in and stood among\r\nus. It made all our explanations seem childish and untrue; the false\r\nrelation was instantly exposed. Eyes exchanged quick, anxious glances,\r\nquestioning, expressive of dismay. There was a sense of wonder, of\r\npoignant distress, and of trepidation. Alarm stood waiting at our\r\nelbows. We shivered.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, as we looked into each other’s faces, came the long,\r\nunwelcome pause in which this new arrival established itself in our\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nAnd, without further speech, or attempt at explanation, Maloney moved\r\noff abruptly to mix the porridge for an early breakfast; Sangree to\r\nclean the fish; myself to chop wood and tend the fire; Joan and her\r\nmother to change their wet garments; and, most significant of all, to\r\nprepare her mother’s tent for its future complement of two.\r\n\r\nEach went to his duty, but hurriedly, awkwardly, silently; and this new\r\narrival, this shape of terror and distress stalked, viewless, by the\r\nside of each.\r\n\r\n“If only I could have traced that dog,” I think was the thought in the\r\nminds of all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut in Camp, where every one realises how important the individual\r\ncontribution is to the comfort and well-being of all, the mind speedily\r\nrecovers tone and pulls itself together.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, a day of heavy and ceaseless rain, we kept more or less\r\nto our tents, and though there were signs of mysterious conferences\r\nbetween the three members of the Maloney family, I think that most of\r\nus slept a good deal and stayed alone with his thoughts. Certainly, I\r\ndid, because when Maloney came to say that his wife invited us all to a\r\nspecial “tea” in her tent, he had to shake me awake before I realised\r\nthat he was there at all.\r\n\r\nAnd by supper-time we were more or less even-minded again, and almost\r\njolly. I only noticed that there was an undercurrent of what is best\r\ndescribed as “jumpiness,” and that the merest snapping of a twig, or\r\nplop of a fish in the lagoon, was sufficient to make us start and look\r\nover our shoulders. Pauses were rare in our talk, and the fire was\r\nnever for one instant allowed to get low. The wind and rain had ceased,\r\nbut the dripping of the branches still kept up an excellent imitation\r\nof a downpour. In particular, Maloney was vigilant and alert, telling\r\nus a series of tales in which the wholesome humorous element was\r\nespecially strong. He lingered, too, behind with me after Sangree had\r\ngone to bed, and while I mixed myself a glass of hot Swedish punch, he\r\ndid a thing I had never known him do before--he mixed one for himself,\r\nand then asked me to light him over to his tent. We said nothing on\r\nthe way, but I felt that he was glad of my companionship.\r\n\r\nI returned alone to the stockade, and for a long time after that kept\r\nthe fire blazing, and sat up smoking and thinking. I hardly knew why;\r\nbut sleep was far from me for one thing, and for another, an idea\r\nwas taking form in my mind that required the comfort of tobacco and\r\na bright fire for its growth. I lay against a corner of the stockade\r\nseat, listening to the wind whispering and to the ceaseless drip-drip\r\nof the trees. The night, otherwise, was very still, and the sea quiet\r\nas a lake. I remember that I was conscious, peculiarly conscious, of\r\nthis host of desolate islands crowding about us in the darkness, and\r\nthat we were the one little spot of humanity in a rather wonderful kind\r\nof wilderness.\r\n\r\nBut this, I think, was the only symptom that came to warn me of\r\nhighly strung nerves, and it certainly was not sufficiently alarming\r\nto destroy my peace of mind. One thing, however, did come to disturb\r\nmy peace, for just as I finally made ready to go, and had kicked the\r\nembers of the fire into a last effort, I fancied I saw, peering at me\r\nround the farther end of the stockade wall, a dark and shadowy mass\r\nthat might have been--that strongly resembled, in fact--the body of a\r\nlarge animal. Two glowing eyes shone for an instant in the middle of\r\nit. But the next second I saw that it was merely a projecting mass of\r\nmoss and lichen in the wall of our stockade, and the eyes were a couple\r\nof wandering sparks from the dying ashes I had kicked. It was easy\r\nenough, too, to imagine I saw an animal moving here and there between\r\nthe trees, as I picked my way stealthily to my tent. Of course, the\r\nshadows tricked me.\r\n\r\nAnd though it was after one o’clock, Maloney’s light was still burning,\r\nfor I saw his tent shining white among the pines.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in the short space between consciousness and\r\nsleep--that time when the body is low and the voices of the submerged\r\nregion tell sometimes true--that the idea which had been all this\r\nwhile maturing reached the point of an actual decision, and I suddenly\r\nrealised that I had resolved to send word to Dr. Silence. For, with\r\na sudden wonder that I had hitherto been so blind, the unwelcome\r\nconviction dawned upon me all at once that some dreadful thing was\r\nlurking about us on this island, and that the safety of at least one\r\nof us was threatened by something monstrous and unclean that was too\r\nhorrible to contemplate. And, again remembering those last words of his\r\nas the train moved out of the platform, I understood that Dr. Silence\r\nwould hold himself in readiness to come.\r\n\r\n“Unless you should send for me sooner,” he had said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI found myself suddenly wide awake. It is impossible to say what woke\r\nme, but it was no gradual process, seeing that I jumped from deep sleep\r\nto absolute alertness in a single instant. I had evidently slept for an\r\nhour and more, for the night had cleared, stars crowded the sky, and\r\na pallid half-moon just sinking into the sea threw a spectral light\r\nbetween the trees.\r\n\r\nI went outside to sniff the air, and stood upright. A curious\r\nimpression that something was astir in the Camp came over me, and when\r\nI glanced across at Sangree’s tent, some twenty feet away, I saw that\r\nit was moving. He too, then, was awake and restless, for I saw the\r\ncanvas sides bulge this way and that as he moved within.\r\n\r\nThen the flap pushed forward. He was coming out, like myself, to sniff\r\nthe air; and I was not surprised, for its sweetness after the rain was\r\nintoxicating. And he came on all fours, just as I had done. I saw a\r\nhead thrust round the edge of the tent.\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw that it was not Sangree at all. It was an animal. And\r\nthe same instant I realised something else too--it was _the_ animal;\r\nand its whole presentment for some unaccountable reason was unutterably\r\nmalefic.\r\n\r\nA cry I was quite unable to suppress escaped me, and the creature\r\nturned on the instant and stared at me with baleful eyes. I could\r\nhave dropped on the spot, for the strength all ran out of my body\r\nwith a rush. Something about it touched in me the living terror that\r\ngrips and paralyses. If the mind requires but the tenth of a second\r\nto form an impression, I must have stood there stockstill for several\r\nseconds while I seized the ropes for support and stared. Many and vivid\r\nimpressions flashed through my mind, but not one of them resulted in\r\naction, because I was in instant dread that the beast any moment would\r\nleap in my direction and be upon me. Instead, however, after what\r\nseemed a vast period, it slowly turned its eyes from my face, uttered a\r\nlow whining sound, and came out altogether into the open.\r\n\r\nThen, for the first time, I saw it in its entirety and noted two\r\nthings: it was about the size of a large dog, but at the same time it\r\nwas utterly unlike any animal that I had ever seen. Also, that the\r\nquality that had impressed me first as being malefic, was really only\r\nits singular and original strangeness. Foolish as it may sound, and\r\nimpossible as it is for me to adduce proof, I can only say that the\r\nanimal seemed to me then to be--not real.\r\n\r\nBut all this passed through my mind in a flash, almost subconsciously,\r\nand before I had time to check my impressions, or even properly verify\r\nthem; I made an involuntary movement, catching the tight rope in my\r\nhand so that it twanged like a banjo string, and in that instant the\r\ncreature turned the corner of Sangree’s tent and was gone into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, my senses in some measure returned to me, and I\r\nrealised only one thing: it had been inside his tent!\r\n\r\nI dashed out, reached the door in half a dozen strides, and looked in.\r\nThe Canadian, thank God! lay upon his bed of branches. His arm was\r\nstretched outside, across the blankets, the fist tightly clenched, and\r\nthe body had an appearance of unusual rigidity that was alarming. On\r\nhis face there was an expression of effort, almost of painful effort,\r\nso far as the uncertain light permitted me to see, and his sleep seemed\r\nto be very profound. He looked, I thought, so stiff, so unnaturally\r\nstiff, and in some indefinable way, too, he looked smaller--shrunken.\r\n\r\nI called to him to wake, but called many times in vain. Then I decided\r\nto shake him, and had already moved forward to do so vigorously when\r\nthere came a sound of footsteps padding softly behind me, and I felt a\r\nstream of hot breath burn my neck as I stooped. I turned sharply. The\r\ntent door was darkened and something silently swept in. I felt a rough\r\nand shaggy body push past me, and knew that the animal had returned. It\r\nseemed to leap forward between me and Sangree--in fact, to leap upon\r\nSangree, for its dark body hid him momentarily from view, and in that\r\nmoment my soul turned sick and coward with a horror that rose from the\r\nvery dregs and depth of life, and gripped my existence at its central\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nThe creature seemed somehow to melt away into him, almost as though\r\nit belonged to him and were a part of himself, but in the same\r\ninstant--that instant of extraordinary confusion and terror in my\r\nmind--it seemed to pass over and behind him, and, in some utterly\r\nunaccountable fashion, it was gone! And the Canadian woke and sat up\r\nwith a start.\r\n\r\n“Quick! You fool!” I cried, in my excitement, “the beast has been in\r\nyour tent, here at your very throat while you sleep like the dead. Up,\r\nman! Get your gun! Only this second it disappeared over there behind\r\nyour head. Quick! or Joan----!”\r\n\r\nAnd somehow the fact that he was there, wide-awake now, to corroborate\r\nme, brought the additional conviction to my own mind that this was no\r\nanimal, but some perplexing and dreadful form of life that drew upon my\r\ndeeper knowledge, that much reading had perhaps assented to, but that\r\nhad never yet come within actual range of my senses.\r\n\r\nHe was up in a flash, and out. He was trembling, and very white. We\r\nsearched hurriedly, feverishly, but found only the traces of paw-marks\r\npassing from the door of his own tent across the moss to the women’s.\r\nAnd the sight of the tracks about Mrs. Maloney’s tent, where Joan now\r\nslept, set him in a perfect fury.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what it is, Hubbard, this beast?” he hissed under his\r\nbreath at me; “it’s a damned wolf, that’s what it is--a wolf lost among\r\nthe islands, and starving to death--desperate. So help me God, I\r\nbelieve it’s that!”\r\n\r\nHe talked a lot of rubbish in his excitement. He declared he would\r\nsleep by day and sit up every night until he killed it. Again his rage\r\ntouched my admiration; but I got him away before he made enough noise\r\nto wake the whole Camp.\r\n\r\n“I have a better plan than that,” I said, watching his face closely. “I\r\ndon’t think this is anything we can deal with. I’m going to send for\r\nthe only man I know who can help. We’ll go to Waxholm this very morning\r\nand get a telegram through.”\r\n\r\nSangree stared at me with a curious expression as the fury died out of\r\nhis face and a new look of alarm took its place.\r\n\r\n“John Silence,” I said, “will know----”\r\n\r\n“You think it’s something--of that sort?” he stammered.\r\n\r\n“I am sure of it.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s pause. “That’s worse, far worse than anything\r\nmaterial,” he said, turning visibly paler. He looked from my face to\r\nthe sky, and then added with sudden resolution, “Come; the wind’s\r\nrising. Let’s get off at once. From there you can telephone to\r\nStockholm and get a telegram sent without delay.”\r\n\r\nI sent him down to get the boat ready, and seized the opportunity\r\nmyself to run and wake Maloney. He was sleeping very lightly, and\r\nsprang up the moment I put my head inside his tent. I told him briefly\r\nwhat I had seen, and he showed so little surprise that I caught myself\r\nwondering for the first time whether he himself had seen more going on\r\nthan he had deemed wise to communicate to the rest of us.\r\n\r\nHe agreed to my plan without a moment’s hesitation, and my last\r\nwords to him were to let his wife and daughter think that the great\r\npsychic doctor was coming merely as a chance visitor, and not with any\r\nprofessional interest.\r\n\r\nSo, with frying-pan, provisions, and blankets aboard, Sangree and I\r\nsailed out of the lagoon fifteen minutes later, and headed with a good\r\nbreeze for the direction of Waxholm and the borders of civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAlthough nothing John Silence did ever took me, properly speaking, by\r\nsurprise, it was certainly unexpected to find a letter from Stockholm\r\nwaiting for me. “I have finished my Hungary business,” he wrote, “and\r\nam here for ten days. Do not hesitate to send if you need me. If you\r\ntelephone any morning from Waxholm I can catch the afternoon steamer.”\r\n\r\nMy years of intercourse with him were full of “coincidences” of this\r\ndescription, and although he never sought to explain them by claiming\r\nany magical system of communication with my mind, I have never doubted\r\nthat there actually existed some secret telepathic method by which he\r\nknew my circumstances and gauged the degree of my need. And that this\r\npower was independent of time in the sense that it saw into the future,\r\nalways seemed to me equally apparent.\r\n\r\nSangree was as much relieved as I was, and within an hour of sunset\r\nthat very evening we met him on the arrival of the little coasting\r\nsteamer, and carried him off in the dinghy to the camp we had prepared\r\non a neighbouring island, meaning to start for home early next morning.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, when supper was over and we were smoking round the\r\nfire, “let me hear your story.” He glanced from one to the other,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n“You tell it, Mr. Hubbard,” Sangree interrupted abruptly, and went\r\noff a little way to wash the dishes, yet not so far as to be out of\r\nearshot. And while he splashed with the hot water, and scraped the tin\r\nplates with sand and moss, my voice, unbroken by a single question from\r\nDr. Silence, ran on for the next half-hour with the best account I\r\ncould give of what had happened.\r\n\r\nMy listener lay on the other side of the fire, his face half hidden\r\nby a big sombrero; sometimes he glanced up questioningly when a\r\npoint needed elaboration, but he uttered no single word till I had\r\nreached the end, and his manner all through the recital was grave and\r\nattentive. Overhead, the wash of the wind in the pine branches filled\r\nin the pauses; the darkness settled down over the sea, and the stars\r\ncame out in thousands, and by the time I finished the moon had risen to\r\nflood the scene with silver. Yet, by his face and eyes, I knew quite\r\nwell that the doctor was listening to something he had expected to\r\nhear, even if he had not actually anticipated all the details.\r\n\r\n“You did well to send for me,” he said very low, with a significant\r\nglance at me when I finished; “very well,”--and for one swift second\r\nhis eye took in Sangree,--“for what we have to deal with here is\r\nnothing more than a werewolf--rare enough, I am glad to say, but often\r\nvery sad, and sometimes very terrible.”\r\n\r\nI jumped as though I had been shot, but the next second was heartily\r\nashamed of my want of control; for this brief remark, confirming as\r\nit did my own worst suspicions, did more to convince me of the gravity\r\nof the adventure than any number of questions or explanations. It\r\nseemed to draw close the circle about us, shutting a door somewhere\r\nthat locked us in with the animal and the horror, and turning the key.\r\nWhatever it was had now to be faced and dealt with.\r\n\r\n“No one has been actually injured so far?” he asked aloud, but in a\r\nmatter-of-fact tone that lent reality to grim possibilities.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens, no!” cried the Canadian, throwing down his dish-cloths\r\nand coming forward into the circle of firelight. “Surely there can be\r\nno question of this poor starved beast injuring anybody, can there?”\r\n\r\nHis hair straggled untidily over his forehead, and there was a gleam in\r\nhis eyes that was not all reflection from the fire. His words made me\r\nturn sharply. We all laughed a little, short, forced laugh.\r\n\r\n“I trust not, indeed,” Dr. Silence said quietly. “But what makes you\r\nthink the creature is starved?” He asked the question with his eyes\r\nstraight on the other’s face. The prompt question explained to me why\r\nI had started, and I waited with just a tremor of excitement for the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nSangree hesitated a moment, as though the question took him by\r\nsurprise. But he met the doctor’s gaze unflinchingly across the fire,\r\nand with complete honesty.\r\n\r\n“Really,” he faltered, with a little shrug of the shoulders, “I can\r\nhardly tell you. The phrase seemed to come out of its own accord. I\r\nhave felt from the beginning that it was in pain and--starved, though\r\nwhy I felt this never occurred to me till you asked.”\r\n\r\n“You really know very little about it, then?” said the other, with a\r\nsudden gentleness in his voice.\r\n\r\n“No more than that,” Sangree replied, looking at him with a puzzled\r\nexpression that was unmistakably genuine. “In fact, nothing at all,\r\nreally,” he added, by way of further explanation.\r\n\r\n“I am glad of that,” I heard the doctor murmur under his breath, but\r\nso low that I only just caught the words, and Sangree missed them\r\naltogether, as evidently he was meant to do.\r\n\r\n“And now,” he cried, getting on his feet and shaking himself with a\r\ncharacteristic gesture, as though to shake out the horror and the\r\nmystery, “let us leave the problem till to-morrow and enjoy this wind\r\nand sea and stars. I’ve been living lately in the atmosphere of many\r\npeople, and feel that I want to wash and be clean. I propose a swim and\r\nthen bed. Who’ll second me?” And two minutes later we were all diving\r\nfrom the boat into cool, deep water, that reflected a thousand moons as\r\nthe waves broke away from us in countless ripples.\r\n\r\nWe slept in blankets under the open sky, Sangree and I taking the\r\noutside places, and were up before sunrise to catch the dawn wind.\r\nHelped by this early start we were half-way home by noon, and then the\r\nwind shifted to a few points behind us so that we fairly ran. In and\r\nout among a thousand islands, down narrow channels where we lost the\r\nwind, out into open spaces where we had to take in a reef, racing along\r\nunder a hot and cloudless sky, we flew through the very heart of the\r\nbewildering and lonely scenery.\r\n\r\n“A real wilderness,” cried Dr. Silence from his seat in the bows where\r\nhe held the jib sheet. His hat was off, his hair tumbled in the wind,\r\nand his lean brown face gave him the touch of an Oriental. Presently\r\nhe changed places with Sangree, and came down to talk with me by the\r\ntiller.\r\n\r\n“A wonderful region, all this world of islands,” he said, waving his\r\nhand to the scenery rushing past us, “but doesn’t it strike you there’s\r\nsomething lacking?”\r\n\r\n“It’s--hard,” I answered, after a moment’s reflection. “It has a\r\nsuperficial, glittering prettiness, without----” I hesitated to find\r\nthe word I wanted.\r\n\r\nJohn Silence nodded his head with approval.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” he said. “The picturesqueness of stage scenery that is not\r\nreal, not alive. It’s like a landscape by a clever painter, yet without\r\ntrue imagination. Soulless--that’s the word you wanted.”\r\n\r\n“Something like that,” I answered, watching the gusts of wind on the\r\nsails. “Not dead so much, as without soul. That’s it.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he went on, in a voice calculated, it seemed to me, not\r\nto reach our companion in the bows, “to live long in a place like\r\nthis--long and alone--might bring about a strange result in some men.”\r\n\r\nI suddenly realised he was talking with a purpose and pricked up my\r\nears.\r\n\r\n“There’s no life here. These islands are mere dead rocks pushed up from\r\nbelow the sea--not living land; and there’s nothing really alive on\r\nthem. Even the sea, this tideless, brackish sea, neither salt water nor\r\nfresh, is dead. It’s all a pretty image of life without the real heart\r\nand soul of life. To a man with too strong desires who came here and\r\nlived close to nature, strange things might happen.”\r\n\r\n“Let her out a bit,” I shouted to Sangree, who was coming aft. “The\r\nwind’s gusty and we’ve got hardly any ballast.”\r\n\r\nHe went back to the bows, and Dr. Silence continued--\r\n\r\n“Here, I mean, a long sojourn would lead to deterioration, to\r\ndegeneration. The place is utterly unsoftened by human influences, by\r\nany humanising associations of history, good or bad. This landscape has\r\nnever awakened into life; it’s still dreaming in its primitive sleep.”\r\n\r\n“In time,” I put in, “you mean a man living here might become brutal?”\r\n\r\n“The passions would run wild, selfishness become supreme, the instincts\r\ncoarsen and turn savage probably.”\r\n\r\n“But----”\r\n\r\n“In other places just as wild, parts of Italy for instance, where there\r\nare other moderating influences, it could not happen. The character\r\nmight grow wild, savage too in a sense, but with a human wildness one\r\ncould understand and deal with. But here, in a hard place like this, it\r\nmight be otherwise.” He spoke slowly, weighing his words carefully.\r\n\r\nI looked at him with many questions in my eyes, and a precautionary cry\r\nto Sangree to stay in the fore part of the boat, out of earshot.\r\n\r\n“First of all there would come callousness to pain, and indifference\r\nto the rights of others. Then the soul would turn savage, not from\r\npassionate human causes, or with enthusiasm, but by deadening down into\r\na kind of cold, primitive, emotionless savagery--by turning, like the\r\nlandscape, soulless.”\r\n\r\n“And a man with strong desires, you say, might change?”\r\n\r\n“Without being aware of it, yes; he might turn savage, his instincts\r\nand desires turn animal. And if”--he lowered his voice and turned for\r\na moment towards the bows, and then continued in his most weighty\r\nmanner--“owing to delicate health or other predisposing causes, his\r\nDouble--you know what I mean, of course--his etheric Body of Desire, or\r\nastral body, as some term it--that part in which the emotions, passions\r\nand desires reside--if this, I say, were for some constitutional reason\r\nloosely joined to his physical organism, there might well take place an\r\noccasional projection----”\r\n\r\nSangree came aft with a sudden rush, his face aflame, but whether with\r\nwind or sun, or with what he had heard, I cannot say. In my surprise\r\nI let the tiller slip and the cutter gave a great plunge as she came\r\nsharply into the wind and flung us all together in a heap on the\r\nbottom. Sangree said nothing, but while he scrambled up and made the\r\njib sheet fast my companion found a moment to add to his unfinished\r\nsentence the words, too low for any ear but mine--\r\n\r\n“Entirely unknown to himself, however.”\r\n\r\nWe righted the boat and laughed, and then Sangree produced the map\r\nand explained exactly where we were. Far away on the horizon, across\r\nan open stretch of water, lay a blue cluster of islands with our\r\ncrescent-shaped home among them and the safe anchorage of the lagoon.\r\nAn hour with this wind would get us there comfortably, and while Dr.\r\nSilence and Sangree fell into conversation, I sat and pondered over the\r\nstrange suggestions that had just been put into my mind concerning\r\nthe “Double,” and the possible form it might assume when dissociated\r\ntemporarily from the physical body.\r\n\r\nThe whole way home these two chatted, and John Silence was as gentle\r\nand sympathetic as a woman. I did not hear much of their talk, for the\r\nwind grew occasionally to the force of a hurricane and the sails and\r\ntiller absorbed my attention; but I could see that Sangree was pleased\r\nand happy, and was pouring out intimate revelations to his companion in\r\nthe way that most people did--when John Silence wished them to do so.\r\n\r\nBut it was quite suddenly, while I sat all intent upon wind and sails,\r\nthat the true meaning of Sangree’s remark about the animal flared up in\r\nme with its full import. For his admission that he knew it was in pain\r\nand starved was in reality nothing more or less than a revelation of\r\nhis deeper self. It was in the nature of a confession. He was speaking\r\nof something that he knew positively, something that was beyond\r\nquestion or argument, something that had to do directly with himself.\r\n“Poor starved beast” he had called it in words that had “come out of\r\ntheir own accord,” and there had not been the slightest evidence of any\r\ndesire to conceal or explain away. He had spoken instinctively--from\r\nhis heart, and as though about his own self.\r\n\r\nAnd half an hour before sunset we raced through the narrow opening of\r\nthe lagoon and saw the smoke of the dinner-fire blowing here and there\r\namong the trees, and the figures of Joan and the Bo’sun’s Mate running\r\ndown to meet us at the landing-stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nEverything changed from the moment John Silence set foot on that\r\nisland; it was like the effect produced by calling in some big doctor,\r\nsome great arbiter of life and death, for consultation. The sense of\r\ngravity increased a hundredfold. Even inanimate objects took upon\r\nthemselves a subtle alteration, for the setting of the adventure--this\r\ndeserted bit of sea with its hundreds of uninhabited islands--somehow\r\nturned sombre. An element that was mysterious, and in a sense\r\ndisheartening, crept unbidden into the severity of grey rock and dark\r\npine forest and took the sparkle from the sunshine and the sea.\r\n\r\nI, at least, was keenly aware of the change, for my whole being\r\nshifted, as it were, a degree higher, becoming keyed up and alert.\r\nThe figures from the background of the stage moved forward a little\r\ninto the light--nearer to the inevitable action. In a word this man’s\r\narrival intensified the whole affair.\r\n\r\nAnd, looking back down the years to the time when all this happened,\r\nit is clear to me that he had a pretty sharp idea of the meaning of it\r\nfrom the very beginning. How much he knew beforehand by his strange\r\ndivining powers, it is impossible to say, but from the moment he came\r\nupon the scene and caught within himself the note of what was going on\r\namongst us, he undoubtedly held the true solution of the puzzle and had\r\nno need to ask questions. And this certitude it was that set him in\r\nsuch an atmosphere of power and made us all look to him instinctively;\r\nfor he took no tentative steps, made no false moves, and while the rest\r\nof us floundered he moved straight to the climax. He was indeed a true\r\ndiviner of souls.\r\n\r\nI can now read into his behaviour a good deal that puzzled me at the\r\ntime, for though I had dimly guessed the solution, I had no idea how\r\nhe would deal with it. And the conversations I can reproduce almost\r\nverbatim, for, according to my invariable habit, I kept full notes of\r\nall he said.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Maloney, foolish and dazed; to Joan, alarmed, yet plucky;\r\nand to the clergyman, moved by his daughter’s distress below his\r\nusual shallow emotions, he gave the best possible treatment in the\r\nbest possible way, yet all so easily and simply as to make it appear\r\nnaturally spontaneous. For he dominated the Bo’sun’s Mate, taking the\r\nmeasure of her ignorance with infinite patience; he keyed up Joan,\r\nstirring her courage and interest to the highest point for her own\r\nsafety; and the Reverend Timothy he soothed and comforted, while\r\nobtaining his implicit obedience, by taking him into his confidence,\r\nand leading him gradually to a comprehension of the issue that was\r\nbound to follow.\r\n\r\nAnd Sangree--here his wisdom was most wisely calculated--he neglected\r\noutwardly because inwardly he was the object of his unceasing and most\r\nconcentrated attention. Under the guise of apparent indifference his\r\nmind kept the Canadian under constant observation.\r\n\r\nThere was a restless feeling in the Camp that evening and none of us\r\nlingered round the fire after supper as usual. Sangree and I busied\r\nourselves with patching up the torn tent for our guest and with finding\r\nheavy stones to hold the ropes, for Dr. Silence insisted on having it\r\npitched on the highest point of the island ridge, just where it was\r\nmost rocky and there was no earth for pegs. The place, moreover, was\r\nmidway between the men’s and women’s tents, and, of course, commanded\r\nthe most comprehensive view of the Camp.\r\n\r\n“So that if your dog comes,” he said simply, “I may be able to catch\r\nhim as he passes across.”\r\n\r\nThe wind had gone down with the sun and an unusual warmth lay over the\r\nisland that made sleep heavy, and in the morning we assembled at a\r\nlate breakfast, rubbing our eyes and yawning. The cool north wind had\r\ngiven way to the warm southern air that sometimes came up with haze and\r\nmoisture across the Baltic, bringing with it the relaxing sensations\r\nthat produced enervation and listlessness.\r\n\r\nAnd this may have been the reason why at first I failed to notice that\r\nanything unusual was about, and why I was less alert than normally; for\r\nit was not till after breakfast that the silence of our little party\r\nstruck me and I discovered that Joan had not yet put in an appearance.\r\nAnd then, in a flash, the last heaviness of sleep vanished and I saw\r\nthat Maloney was white and troubled and his wife could not hold a plate\r\nwithout trembling.\r\n\r\nA desire to ask questions was stopped in me by a swift glance from\r\nDr. Silence, and I suddenly understood in some vague way that they\r\nwere waiting till Sangree should have gone. How this idea came to me I\r\ncannot determine, but the soundness of the intuition was soon proved,\r\nfor the moment he moved off to his tent, Maloney looked up at me and\r\nbegan to speak in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“You slept through it all,” he half whispered.\r\n\r\n“Through what?” I asked, suddenly thrilled with the knowledge that\r\nsomething dreadful had happened.\r\n\r\n“We didn’t wake you for fear of getting the whole Camp up,” he went on,\r\nmeaning, by the Camp, I supposed, Sangree. “It was just before dawn\r\nwhen the screams woke me.”\r\n\r\n“The dog again?” I asked, with a curious sinking of the heart.\r\n\r\n“Got right into the tent,” he went on, speaking passionately but very\r\nlow, “and woke my wife by scrambling all over her. Then she realised\r\nthat Joan was struggling beside her. And, by God! the beast had torn\r\nher arm; scratched all down the arm she was, and bleeding.”\r\n\r\n“Joan injured?” I gasped.\r\n\r\n“Merely scratched--this time,” put in John Silence, speaking for the\r\nfirst time; “suffering more from shock and fright than actual wounds.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it a mercy the doctor was here,” said Mrs. Maloney, looking as\r\nif she would never know calmness again. “I think we should both have\r\nbeen killed.”\r\n\r\n“It has been a most merciful escape,” Maloney said, his pulpit\r\nvoice struggling with his emotion. “But, of course, we cannot risk\r\nanother--we must strike Camp and get away at once----”\r\n\r\n“Only poor Mr. Sangree must not know what has happened. He is so\r\nattached to Joan and would be so terribly upset,” added the Bo’sun’s\r\nMate distractedly, looking all about in her terror.\r\n\r\n“It is perhaps advisable that Mr. Sangree should not know what has\r\noccurred,” Dr. Silence said with quiet authority, “but I think, for the\r\nsafety of all concerned, it will be better not to leave the island just\r\nnow.” He spoke with great decision and Maloney looked up and followed\r\nhis words closely.\r\n\r\n“If you will agree to stay here a few days longer, I have no doubt\r\nwe can put an end to the attentions of your strange visitor, and\r\nincidentally have the opportunity of observing a most singular and\r\ninteresting phenomenon----”\r\n\r\n“What!” gasped Mrs. Maloney, “a phenomenon?--you mean that you know\r\nwhat it is?”\r\n\r\n“I am quite certain I know what it is,” he replied very low, for we\r\nheard the footsteps of Sangree approaching, “though I am not so certain\r\nyet as to the best means of dealing with it. But in any case it is not\r\nwise to leave precipitately----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Timothy, does he think it’s a devil----?” cried the Bo’sun’s Mate\r\nin a voice that even the Canadian must have heard.\r\n\r\n“In my opinion,” continued John Silence, looking across at me and the\r\nclergyman, “it is a case of modern lycanthropy with other complications\r\nthat may----” He left the sentence unfinished, for Mrs. Maloney got up\r\nwith a jump and fled to her tent fearful she might hear a worse thing,\r\nand at that moment Sangree turned the corner of the stockade and came\r\ninto view.\r\n\r\n“There are footmarks all round the mouth of my tent,” he said with\r\nexcitement. “The animal has been here again in the night. Dr. Silence,\r\nyou really must come and see them for yourself. They’re as plain on the\r\nmoss as tracks in snow.”\r\n\r\nBut later in the day, while Sangree went off in the canoe to fish\r\nthe pools near the larger islands, and Joan still lay, bandaged and\r\nresting, in her tent, Dr. Silence called me and the tutor and proposed\r\na walk to the granite slabs at the far end. Mrs. Maloney sat on\r\na stump near her daughter, and busied herself energetically with\r\nalternate nursing and painting.\r\n\r\n“We’ll leave you in charge,” the doctor said with a smile that was\r\nmeant to be encouraging, “and when you want us for lunch, or anything,\r\nthe megaphone will always bring us back in time.”\r\n\r\nFor, though the very air was charged with strange emotions, every one\r\ntalked quietly and naturally as with a definite desire to counteract\r\nunnecessary excitement.\r\n\r\n“I’ll keep watch,” said the plucky Bo’sun’s Mate, “and meanwhile I find\r\ncomfort in my work.” She was busy with the sketch she had begun on the\r\nday after our arrival. “For even a tree,” she added proudly, pointing\r\nto her little easel, “is a symbol of the divine, and the thought makes\r\nme feel safer.” We glanced for a moment at a daub which was more like\r\nthe symptom of a disease than a symbol of the divine--and then took the\r\npath round the lagoon.\r\n\r\nAt the far end we made a little fire and lay round it in the shadow of\r\na big boulder. Maloney stopped his humming suddenly and turned to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“And what do you make of it all?” he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” replied John Silence, making himself comfortable\r\nagainst the rock, “it is of human origin, this animal; it is undoubted\r\nlycanthropy.”\r\n\r\nHis words had the effect precisely of a bombshell. Maloney listened as\r\nthough he had been struck.\r\n\r\n“You puzzle me utterly,” he said, sitting up closer and staring at him.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” replied the other, “but if you’ll listen to me for a few\r\nmoments you may be less puzzled at the end--or more. It depends how\r\nmuch you know. Let me go further and say that you have underestimated,\r\nor miscalculated, the effect of this primitive wild life upon all of\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?” asked the clergyman, bristling a trifle.\r\n\r\n“It is strong medicine for any town-dweller, and for some of you it has\r\nbeen too strong. One of you has gone wild.” He uttered these last words\r\nwith great emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Gone savage,” he added, looking from one to the other.\r\n\r\nNeither of us found anything to reply.\r\n\r\n“To say that the brute has awakened in a man is not a mere metaphor\r\nalways,” he went on presently.\r\n\r\n“Of course not!”\r\n\r\n“But, in the sense I mean, may have a very literal and terrible\r\nsignificance,” pursued Dr. Silence. “Ancient instincts that no one\r\ndreamed of, least of all their possessor, may leap forth----”\r\n\r\n“Atavism can hardly explain a roaming animal with teeth and claws and\r\nsanguinary instincts,” interrupted Maloney with impatience.\r\n\r\n“The term is of your own choice,” continued the doctor equably, “not\r\nmine, and it is a good example of a word that indicates a result while\r\nit conceals the process; but the explanation of this beast that haunts\r\nyour island and attacks your daughter is of far deeper significance\r\nthan mere atavistic tendencies, or throwing back to animal origin,\r\nwhich I suppose is the thought in your mind.”\r\n\r\n“You spoke just now of lycanthropy,” said Maloney, looking bewildered\r\nand anxious to keep to plain facts evidently, “I think I have come\r\nacross the word, but really--really--it can have no actual significance\r\nto-day, can it? These superstitions of mediæval times can hardly----”\r\n\r\nHe looked round at me with his jolly red face, and the expression of\r\nastonishment and dismay on it would have made me shout with laughter at\r\nany other time. Laughter, however, was never farther from my mind than\r\nat this moment when I listened to Dr. Silence as he carefully suggested\r\nto the clergyman the very explanation that had gradually been forcing\r\nitself upon my own mind.\r\n\r\n“However mediæval ideas may have exaggerated the idea is not of much\r\nimportance to us now,” he said quietly, “when we are face to face with\r\na modern example of what, I take it, has always been a profound fact.\r\nFor the moment let us leave the name of any one in particular out of\r\nthe matter and consider certain possibilities.”\r\n\r\nWe all agreed with that at any rate. There was no need to speak of\r\nSangree, or of any one else, until we knew a little more.\r\n\r\n“The fundamental fact in this most curious case,” he went on, “is that\r\nthe ‘Double’ of a man----”\r\n\r\n“You mean the astral body? I’ve heard of that, of course,” broke in\r\nMaloney with a snort of triumph.\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” said the other, smiling, “no doubt you have;--that this\r\nDouble, or fluidic body of a man, as I was saying, has the power under\r\ncertain conditions of projecting itself and becoming visible to others.\r\nCertain training will accomplish this, and certain drugs likewise;\r\nillnesses, too, that ravage the body may produce temporarily the result\r\nthat death produces permanently, and let loose this counterpart of a\r\nhuman being and render it visible to the sight of others.\r\n\r\n“Every one, of course, knows this more or less to-day; but it is not so\r\ngenerally known, and probably believed by none who have not witnessed\r\nit, that this fluidic body can, under certain conditions, assume other\r\nforms than human, and that such other forms may be determined by the\r\ndominating thought and wish of the owner. For this Double, or astral\r\nbody as you call it, is really the seat of the passions, emotions and\r\ndesires in the psychical economy. It is the Passion Body; and, in\r\nprojecting itself, it can often assume a form that gives expression to\r\nthe overmastering desire that moulds it; for it is composed of such\r\ntenuous matter that it lends itself readily to the moulding by thought\r\nand wish.”\r\n\r\n“I follow you perfectly,” said Maloney, looking as if he would much\r\nrather be chopping firewood elsewhere and singing.\r\n\r\n“And there are some persons so constituted,” the doctor went on with\r\nincreasing seriousness, “that the fluid body in them is but loosely\r\nassociated with the physical, persons of poor health as a rule, yet\r\noften of strong desires and passions; and in these persons it is easy\r\nfor the Double to dissociate itself during deep sleep from their\r\nsystem, and, driven forth by some consuming desire, to assume an animal\r\nform and seek the fulfilment of that desire.”\r\n\r\nThere, in broad daylight, I saw Maloney deliberately creep closer to\r\nthe fire and heap the wood on. We gathered in to the heat, and to each\r\nother, and listened to Dr. Silence’s voice as it mingled with the swish\r\nand whirr of the wind about us, and the falling of the little waves.\r\n\r\n“For instance, to take a concrete example,” he resumed; “suppose some\r\nyoung man, with the delicate constitution I have spoken of, forms an\r\noverpowering attachment to a young woman, yet perceives that it is not\r\nwelcomed, and is man enough to repress its outward manifestations.\r\nIn such a case, supposing his Double be easily projected, the very\r\nrepression of his love in the daytime would add to the intense force of\r\nhis desire when released in deep sleep from the control of his will,\r\nand his fluidic body might issue forth in monstrous or animal shape and\r\nbecome actually visible to others. And, if his devotion were dog-like\r\nin its fidelity, yet concealing the fires of a fierce passion beneath,\r\nit might well assume the form of a creature that seemed to be half dog,\r\nhalf wolf----”\r\n\r\n“A werewolf, you mean?” cried Maloney, pale to the lips as he listened.\r\n\r\nJohn Silence held up a restraining hand. “A werewolf,” he said, “is a\r\ntrue psychical fact of profound significance, however absurdly it may\r\nhave been exaggerated by the imaginations of a superstitious peasantry\r\nin the days of unenlightenment, for a werewolf is nothing but the\r\nsavage, and possibly sanguinary, instincts of a passionate man scouring\r\nthe world in his fluidic body, his passion body, his body of desire. As\r\nin the case at hand, he may not know it----”\r\n\r\n“It is not necessarily deliberate, then?” Maloney put in quickly, with\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n“----It is hardly ever deliberate. It is the desires released in sleep\r\nfrom the control of the will finding a vent. In all savage races it has\r\nbeen recognised and dreaded, this phenomenon styled ‘Wehr Wolf,’ but\r\nto-day it is rare. And it is becoming rarer still, for the world grows\r\ntame and civilised, emotions have become refined, desires lukewarm, and\r\nfew men have savagery enough left in them to generate impulses of such\r\nintense force, and certainly not to project them in animal form.”\r\n\r\n“By Gad!” exclaimed the clergyman breathlessly, and with increasing\r\nexcitement, “then I feel I must tell you--what has been given to me in\r\nconfidence--that Sangree has in him an admixture of savage blood--of\r\nRed Indian ancestry----”\r\n\r\n“Let us stick to our supposition of a man as described,” the doctor\r\nstopped him calmly, “and let us imagine that he has in him this\r\nadmixture of savage blood; and further, that he is wholly unaware of\r\nhis dreadful physical and psychical infirmity; and that he suddenly\r\nfinds himself leading the primitive life together with the object of\r\nhis desires; with the result that the strain of the untamed wild-man in\r\nhis blood----”\r\n\r\n“Red Indian, for instance,” from Maloney.\r\n\r\n“Red Indian, perfectly,” agreed the doctor; “the result, I say, that\r\nthis savage strain in him is awakened and leaps into passionate life.\r\nWhat then?”\r\n\r\nHe looked hard at Timothy Maloney, and the clergyman looked hard at him.\r\n\r\n“The wild life such as you lead it here on this island, for instance,\r\nmight quickly awaken his savage instincts--his buried instincts--and\r\nwith profoundly disquieting results.”\r\n\r\n“You mean his Subtle Body, as you call it, might issue forth\r\nautomatically in deep sleep and seek the object of its desire?” I said,\r\ncoming to Maloney’s aid, who was finding it more and more difficult to\r\nget words.\r\n\r\n“Precisely;--yet the desire of the man remaining utterly\r\nunmalefic--pure and wholesome in every sense----”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” I heard the clergyman gasp.\r\n\r\n“The lover’s desire for union run wild, run savage, tearing its way out\r\nin primitive, untamed fashion, I mean,” continued the doctor, striving\r\nto make himself clear to a mind bounded by conventional thought and\r\nknowledge; “for the desire to possess, remember, may easily become\r\nimportunate, and, embodied in this animal form of the Subtle Body which\r\nacts as its vehicle, may go forth to tear in pieces all that obstructs,\r\nto reach to the very heart of the loved object and seize it. _Au fond_,\r\nit is nothing more than the aspiration for union, as I said--the\r\nsplendid and perfectly clean desire to absorb utterly into itself----”\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment and looked into Maloney’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“To bathe in the very heart’s blood of the one desired,” he added with\r\ngrave emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe fire spurted and crackled and made me start, but Maloney found\r\nrelief in a genuine shudder, and I saw him turn his head and look about\r\nhim from the sea to the trees. The wind dropped just at that moment and\r\nthe doctor’s words rang sharply through the stillness.\r\n\r\n“Then it might even kill?” stammered the clergyman presently in a\r\nhushed voice, and with a little forced laugh by way of protest that\r\nsounded quite ghastly.\r\n\r\n“In the last resort it might kill,” repeated Dr. Silence. Then, after\r\nanother pause, during which he was clearly debating how much or how\r\nlittle it was wise to give to his audience, he continued: “And if the\r\nDouble does not succeed in getting back to its physical body, that\r\nphysical body would wake an imbecile--an idiot--or perhaps never wake\r\nat all.”\r\n\r\nMaloney sat up and found his tongue.\r\n\r\n“You mean that if this fluid animal thing, or whatever it is, should be\r\nprevented getting back, the man might never wake again?” he asked, with\r\nshaking voice.\r\n\r\n“He might be dead,” replied the other calmly. The tremor of a positive\r\nsensation shivered in the air about us.\r\n\r\n“Then isn’t that the best way to cure the fool--the brute----?”\r\nthundered the clergyman, half rising to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Certainly it would be an easy and undiscoverable form of murder,” was\r\nthe stern reply, spoken as calmly as though it were a remark about the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nMaloney collapsed visibly, and I gathered the wood over the fire and\r\ncoaxed up a blaze.\r\n\r\n“The greater part of the man’s life--of his vital forces--goes out with\r\nthis Double,” Dr. Silence resumed, after a moment’s consideration, “and\r\na considerable portion of the actual material of his physical body. So\r\nthe physical body that remains behind is depleted, not only of force,\r\nbut of matter. You would see it small, shrunken, dropped together, just\r\nlike the body of a materialising medium at a séance. Moreover, any mark\r\nor injury inflicted upon this Double will be found exactly reproduced\r\nby the phenomenon of repercussion upon the shrunken physical body lying\r\nin its trance----”\r\n\r\n“An injury inflicted upon the one you say would be reproduced also on\r\nthe other?” repeated Maloney, his excitement growing again.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied the other quietly; “for there exists all\r\nthe time a continuous connection between the physical body and the\r\nDouble--a connection of matter, though of exceedingly attenuated,\r\npossibly of etheric, matter. The wound _travels_, so to speak, from one\r\nto the other, and if this connection were broken the result would be\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\n“Death,” repeated Maloney to himself, “death!” He looked anxiously at\r\nour faces, his thoughts evidently beginning to clear.\r\n\r\n“And this solidity?” he asked presently, after a general pause; “this\r\ntearing of tents and flesh; this howling, and the marks of paws? You\r\nmean that the Double----?”\r\n\r\n“Has sufficient material drawn from the depleted body to produce\r\nphysical results? Certainly!” the doctor took him up. “Although to\r\nexplain at this moment such problems as the passage of matter through\r\nmatter would be as difficult as to explain how the thought of a mother\r\ncan actually break the bones of the child unborn.”\r\n\r\nDr. Silence pointed out to sea, and Maloney, looking wildly about\r\nhim, turned with a violent start. I saw a canoe, with Sangree in the\r\nstern-seat, slowly coming into view round the farther point. His hat\r\nwas off, and his tanned face for the first time appeared to me--to us\r\nall, I think--as though it were the face of some one else. He looked\r\nlike a wild man. Then he stood up in the canoe to make a cast with the\r\nrod, and he looked for all the world like an Indian. I recalled the\r\nexpression of his face as I had seen it once or twice, notably on that\r\noccasion of the evening prayer, and an involuntary shudder ran down my\r\nspine.\r\n\r\nAt that very instant he turned and saw us where we lay, and his face\r\nbroke into a smile, so that his teeth showed white in the sun. He\r\nlooked in his element, and exceedingly attractive. He called out\r\nsomething about his fish, and soon after passed out of sight into the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\nFor a time none of us said a word.\r\n\r\n“And the cure?” ventured Maloney at length.\r\n\r\n“Is not to quench this savage force,” replied Dr. Silence, “but to\r\nsteer it better, and to provide other outlets. This is the solution\r\nof all these problems of accumulated force, for this force is the raw\r\nmaterial of usefulness, and should be increased and cherished, not\r\nby separating it from the body by death, but by raising it to higher\r\nchannels. The best and quickest cure of all,” he went on, speaking very\r\ngently and with a hand upon the clergyman’s arm, “is to lead it towards\r\nits object, provided that object is not unalterably hostile--to let it\r\nfind rest where----”\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, and the eyes of the two men met in a single glance\r\nof comprehension.\r\n\r\n“Joan?” Maloney exclaimed, under his breath.\r\n\r\n“Joan!” replied John Silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe all went to bed early. The day had been unusually warm, and after\r\nsunset a curious hush descended on the island. Nothing was audible but\r\nthat faint, ghostly singing which is inseparable from a pine-wood even\r\non the stillest day--a low, searching sound, as though the wind had\r\nhair and trailed it o’er the world.\r\n\r\nWith the sudden cooling of the atmosphere a sea fog began to form. It\r\nappeared in isolated patches over the water, and then these patches\r\nslid together and a white wall advanced upon us. Not a breath of air\r\nstirred; the firs stood like flat metal outlines; the sea became as\r\noil. The whole scene lay as though held motionless by some huge weight\r\nin the air; and the flames from our fire--the largest we had ever\r\nmade--rose upwards, straight as a church steeple.\r\n\r\nAs I followed the rest of our party tent-wards, having kicked the\r\nembers of the fire into safety, the advance guard of the fog was\r\ncreeping slowly among the trees, like white arms feeling their way.\r\nMingled with the smoke was the odour of moss and soil and bark, and\r\nthe peculiar flavour of the Baltic, half salt, half brackish, like the\r\nsmell of an estuary at low water.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say why it seemed to me that this deep stillness\r\nmasked an intense activity; perhaps in every mood lies the suggestion\r\nof its opposite, so that I became aware of the contrast of furious\r\nenergy, for it was like moving through the deep pause before a\r\nthunderstorm, and I trod gently lest by breaking a twig or moving\r\na stone I might set the whole scene into some sort of tumultuous\r\nmovement. Actually, no doubt, it was nothing more than a result of\r\noverstrung nerves.\r\n\r\nThere was no more question of undressing and going to bed than there\r\nwas of undressing and going to bathe. Some sense in me was alert and\r\nexpectant. I sat in my tent and waited. And at the end of half an hour\r\nor so my waiting was justified, for the canvas suddenly shivered,\r\nand some one tripped over the ropes that held it to the earth. John\r\nSilence came in.\r\n\r\nThe effect of his quiet entry was singular and prophetic: it was just\r\nas though the energy lying behind all this stillness had pressed\r\nforward to the edge of action. This, no doubt, was merely the\r\nquickening of my own mind, and had no other justification; for the\r\npresence of John Silence always suggested the near possibility of\r\nvigorous action, and, as a matter of fact, he came in with nothing more\r\nthan a nod and a significant gesture.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a corner of my ground-sheet, and I pushed the blanket\r\nover so that he could cover his legs. He drew the flap of the tent\r\nafter him and settled down, but hardly had he done so when the canvas\r\nshook a second time, and in blundered Maloney.\r\n\r\n“Sitting in the dark?” he said self-consciously, pushing his head\r\ninside, and hanging up his lantern on the ridge-pole nail. “I just\r\nlooked in for a smoke. I suppose----”\r\n\r\nHe glanced round, caught the eye of Dr. Silence, and stopped. He\r\nput his pipe back into his pocket and began to hum softly--that\r\nunder-breath humming of a nondescript melody I knew so well and had\r\ncome to hate.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence leaned forward, opened the lantern and blew the light out.\r\n“Speak low,” he said, “and don’t strike matches. Listen for sounds\r\nand movements about the Camp, and be ready to follow me at a moment’s\r\nnotice.” There was light enough to distinguish our faces easily, and I\r\nsaw Maloney glance again hurriedly at both of us.\r\n\r\n“Is the Camp asleep?” the doctor asked presently, whispering.\r\n\r\n“Sangree is,” replied the clergyman, in a voice equally low. “I can’t\r\nanswer for the women; I think they’re sitting up.”\r\n\r\n“That’s for the best.” And then he added: “I wish the fog would thin a\r\nbit and let the moon through; later--we may want it.”\r\n\r\n“It is lifting now, I think,” Maloney whispered back. “It’s over the\r\ntops of the trees already.”\r\n\r\nI cannot say what it was in this commonplace exchange of remarks\r\nthat thrilled. Probably Maloney’s swift acquiescence in the doctor’s\r\nmood had something to do with it; for his quick obedience certainly\r\nimpressed me a good deal. But, even without that slight evidence,\r\nit was clear that each recognised the gravity of the occasion, and\r\nunderstood that sleep was impossible and sentry duty was the order of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n“Report to me,” repeated John Silence once again, “the least sound, and\r\ndo nothing precipitately.”\r\n\r\nHe shifted across to the mouth of the tent and raised the flap,\r\nfastening it against the pole so that he could see out. Maloney stopped\r\nhumming and began to force the breath through his teeth with a kind\r\nof faint hissing, treating us to a medley of church hymns and popular\r\nsongs of the day.\r\n\r\nThen the tent trembled as though some one had touched it.\r\n\r\n“That’s the wind rising,” whispered the clergyman, and pulled the flap\r\nopen as far as it would go. A waft of cold damp air entered and made us\r\nshiver, and with it came a sound of the sea as the first wave washed\r\nits way softly along the shores.\r\n\r\n“It’s got round to the north,” he added, and following his voice came\r\na long-drawn whisper that rose from the whole island as the trees sent\r\nforth a sighing response. “The fog’ll move a bit now. I can make out a\r\nlane across the sea already.”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Dr. Silence, for Maloney’s voice had risen above a\r\nwhisper, and we settled down again to another long period of watching\r\nand waiting, broken only by the occasional rubbing of shoulders against\r\nthe canvas as we shifted our positions, and the increasing noise of\r\nwaves on the outer coast-line of the island. And over all whirred the\r\nmurmur of wind sweeping the tops of the trees like a great harp, and\r\nthe faint tapping on the tent as drops fell from the branches with a\r\nsharp pinging sound.\r\n\r\nWe had sat for something over an hour in this way, and Maloney and I\r\nwere finding it increasingly hard to keep awake, when suddenly Dr.\r\nSilence rose to his feet and peered out. The next minute he was gone.\r\n\r\nRelieved of the dominating presence, the clergyman thrust his face\r\nclose into mine. “I don’t much care for this waiting game,” he\r\nwhispered, “but Silence wouldn’t hear of my sitting up with the others;\r\nhe said it would prevent anything happening if I did.”\r\n\r\n“He knows,” I answered shortly.\r\n\r\n“No doubt in the world about that,” he whispered back; “it’s this\r\n‘Double’ business, as he calls it, or else it’s obsession as the Bible\r\ndescribes it. But it’s bad, whichever it is, and I’ve got my Winchester\r\noutside ready cocked, and I brought this too.” He shoved a pocket Bible\r\nunder my nose. At one time in his life it had been his inseparable\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“One’s useless and the other’s dangerous,” I replied under my breath,\r\nconscious of a keen desire to laugh, and leaving him to choose. “Safety\r\nlies in following our leader----”\r\n\r\n“I’m not thinking of myself,” he interrupted sharply; “only, if\r\nanything happens to Joan to-night I’m going to shoot first--and pray\r\nafterwards!”\r\n\r\nMaloney put the book back into his hip-pocket, and peered out of the\r\ndoorway. “What is he up to now, in the devil’s name, I wonder!” he\r\nadded; “going round Sangree’s tent and making gestures. How weird he\r\nlooks disappearing in and out of the fog.”\r\n\r\n“Just trust him and wait,” I said quickly, for the doctor was already\r\non his way back. “Remember, he has the knowledge, and knows what he’s\r\nabout. I’ve been with him through worse cases than this.”\r\n\r\nMaloney moved back as Dr. Silence darkened the doorway and stooped to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\n“His sleep is very deep,” he whispered, seating himself by the door\r\nagain. “He’s in a cataleptic condition, and the Double may be released\r\nany minute now. But I’ve taken steps to imprison it in the tent, and it\r\ncan’t get out till I permit it. Be on the watch for signs of movement.”\r\nThen he looked hard at Maloney. “But no violence, or shooting,\r\nremember, Mr. Maloney, unless you want a murder on your hands. Anything\r\ndone to the Double acts by repercussion upon the physical body. You had\r\nbetter take out the cartridges at once.”\r\n\r\nHis voice was stern. The clergyman went out, and I heard him emptying\r\nthe magazine of his rifle. When he returned he sat nearer the door than\r\nbefore, and from that moment until we left the tent he never once took\r\nhis eyes from the figure of Dr. Silence, silhouetted there against sky\r\nand canvas.\r\n\r\nAnd, meanwhile, the wind came steadily over the sea and opened the mist\r\ninto lanes and clearings, driving it about like a living thing.\r\n\r\nIt must have been well after midnight when a low booming sound drew my\r\nattention; but at first the sense of hearing was so strained that it\r\nwas impossible exactly to locate it, and I imagined it was the thunder\r\nof big guns far out at sea carried to us by the rising wind. Then\r\nMaloney, catching hold of my arm and leaning forward, somehow brought\r\nthe true relation, and I realised the next second that it was only a\r\nfew feet away.\r\n\r\n“Sangree’s tent,” he exclaimed in a loud and startled whisper.\r\n\r\nI craned my head round the corner, but at first the effect of the\r\nfog was so confusing that every patch of white driving about before\r\nthe wind looked like a moving tent and it was some seconds before I\r\ndiscovered the one patch that held steady. Then I saw that it was\r\nshaking all over, and the sides, flapping as much as the tightness of\r\nthe ropes allowed, were the cause of the booming sound we had heard.\r\nSomething alive was tearing frantically about inside, banging against\r\nthe stretched canvas in a way that made me think of a great moth\r\ndashing against the walls and ceiling of a room. The tent bulged and\r\nrocked.\r\n\r\n“It’s trying to get out, by Jupiter!” muttered the clergyman, rising to\r\nhis feet and turning to the side where the unloaded rifle lay. I sprang\r\nup too, hardly knowing what purpose was in my mind, but anxious to be\r\nprepared for anything. John Silence, however, was before us both, and\r\nhis figure slipped past and blocked the doorway of the tent. And there\r\nwas some quality in his voice next minute when he began to speak that\r\nbrought our minds instantly to a state of calm obedience.\r\n\r\n“First--the women’s tent,” he said low, looking sharply at Maloney,\r\n“and if I need your help, I’ll call.”\r\n\r\nThe clergyman needed no second bidding. He dived past me and was out\r\nin a moment. He was labouring evidently under intense excitement. I\r\nwatched him picking his way silently over the slippery ground, giving\r\nthe moving tent a wide berth, and presently disappearing among the\r\nfloating shapes of fog.\r\n\r\nDr. Silence turned to me. “You heard those footsteps about half an hour\r\nago?” he asked significantly.\r\n\r\n“I heard nothing.”\r\n\r\n“They were extraordinarily soft--almost the soundless tread of a wild\r\ncreature. But now, follow me closely,” he added, “for we must waste\r\nno time if I am to save this poor man from his affliction and lead\r\nhis werewolf Double to its rest. And, unless I am much mistaken”--he\r\npeered at me through the darkness, whispering with the utmost\r\ndistinctness--“Joan and Sangree are absolutely made for one another.\r\nAnd I think she knows it too--just as well as he does.”\r\n\r\nMy head swam a little as I listened, but at the same time something\r\ncleared in my brain and I saw that he was right. Yet it was all so\r\nweird and incredible, so remote from the commonplace facts of life\r\nas commonplace people know them; and more than once it flashed upon\r\nme that the whole scene--people, words, tents, and all the rest of\r\nit--were delusions created by the intense excitement of my own mind\r\nsomehow, and that suddenly the sea-fog would clear off and the world\r\nbecome normal again.\r\n\r\nThe cold air from the sea stung our cheeks sharply as we left the close\r\natmosphere of the little crowded tent. The sighing of the trees, the\r\nwaves breaking below on the rocks, and the lines and patches of mist\r\ndriving about us seemed to create the momentary illusion that the whole\r\nisland had broken loose and was floating out to sea like a mighty raft.\r\n\r\nThe doctor moved just ahead of me, quickly and silently; he was making\r\nstraight for the Canadian’s tent where the sides still boomed and shook\r\nas the creature of sinister life raced and tore about impatiently\r\nwithin. A little distance from the door he paused and held up a hand to\r\nstop me. We were, perhaps, a dozen feet away.\r\n\r\n“Before I release it, you shall see for yourself,” he said, “that the\r\nreality of the werewolf is beyond all question. The matter of which\r\nit is composed is, of course, exceedingly attenuated, but you are\r\npartially clairvoyant--and even if it is not dense enough for normal\r\nsight you will see something.”\r\n\r\nHe added a little more I could not catch. The fact was that the\r\ncuriously strong vibrating atmosphere surrounding his person somewhat\r\nconfused my senses. It was the result, of course, of his intense\r\nconcentration of mind and forces, and pervaded the entire Camp and all\r\nthe persons in it. And as I watched the canvas shake and heard it boom\r\nand flap I heartily welcomed it. For it was also protective.\r\n\r\nAt the back of Sangree’s tent stood a thin group of pine trees, but\r\nin front and at the sides the ground was comparatively clear. The\r\nflap was wide open and any ordinary animal would have been out and\r\naway without the least trouble. Dr. Silence led me up to within a few\r\nfeet, evidently careful not to advance beyond a certain limit, and then\r\nstooped down and signalled to me to do the same. And looking over his\r\nshoulder I saw the interior lit faintly by the spectral light reflected\r\nfrom the fog, and the dim blot upon the balsam boughs and blankets\r\nsignifying Sangree; while over him, and round him, and up and down him,\r\nflew the dark mass of “something” on four legs, with pointed muzzle and\r\nsharp ears plainly visible against the tent sides, and the occasional\r\ngleam of fiery eyes and white fangs.\r\n\r\nI held my breath and kept utterly still, inwardly and outwardly,\r\nfor fear, I suppose, that the creature would become conscious of my\r\npresence; but the distress I felt went far deeper than the mere sense\r\nof personal safety, or the fact of watching something so incredibly\r\nactive and real. I became keenly aware of the dreadful psychic calamity\r\nit involved. The realisation that Sangree lay confined in that narrow\r\nspace with this species of monstrous projection of himself--that he was\r\nwrapped there in the cataleptic sleep, all unconscious that this thing\r\nwas masquerading with his own life and energies--added a distressing\r\ntouch of horror to the scene. In all the cases of John Silence--and\r\nthey were many and often terrible--no other psychic affliction has\r\never, before or since, impressed me so convincingly with the pathetic\r\nimpermanence of the human personality, with its fluid nature, and with\r\nthe alarming possibilities of its transformations.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he whispered, after we had watched for some minutes the frantic\r\nefforts to escape from the circle of thought and will that held it\r\nprisoner, “come a little farther away while I release it.”\r\n\r\nWe moved back a dozen yards or so. It was like a scene in some\r\nimpossible play, or in some ghastly and oppressive nightmare from which\r\nI should presently awake to find the blankets all heaped up upon my\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nBy some method undoubtedly mental, but which, in my confusion and\r\nexcitement, I failed to understand, the doctor accomplished his\r\npurpose, and the next minute I heard him say sharply under his breath,\r\n“It’s out! Now, watch!”\r\n\r\nAt this very moment a sudden gust from the sea blew aside the mist, so\r\nthat a lane opened to the sky, and the moon, ghastly and unnatural as\r\nthe effect of stage limelight, dropped down in a momentary gleam upon\r\nthe door of Sangree’s tent, and I perceived that something had moved\r\nforward from the interior darkness and stood clearly defined upon the\r\nthreshold. And, at the same moment, the tent ceased its shuddering and\r\nheld still.\r\n\r\nThere, in the doorway, stood an animal, with neck and muzzle thrust\r\nforward, its head poking into the night, its whole body poised in that\r\nattitude of intense rigidity that precedes the spring into freedom,\r\nthe running leap of attack. It seemed to be about the size of a calf,\r\nleaner than a mastiff, yet more squat than a wolf, and I can swear that\r\nI saw the fur ridged sharply upon its back. Then its upper lip slowly\r\nlifted, and I saw the whiteness of its teeth.\r\n\r\nSurely no human being ever stared as hard as I did in those next few\r\nminutes. Yet, the harder I stared the clearer appeared the amazing and\r\nmonstrous apparition. For, after all, it was Sangree--and yet it was\r\nnot Sangree. It was the head and face of an animal, and yet it was the\r\nface of Sangree: the face of a wild dog, a wolf, and yet his face. The\r\neyes were sharper, narrower, more fiery, yet they were his eyes--his\r\neyes run wild; the teeth were longer, whiter, more pointed--yet they\r\nwere his teeth, his teeth grown cruel; the expression was flaming,\r\nterrible, exultant--yet it was his expression carried to the border of\r\nsavagery--his expression as I had already surprised it more than once,\r\nonly dominant now, fully released from human constraint, with the mad\r\nyearning of a hungry and importunate soul. It was the soul of Sangree,\r\nthe long suppressed, deeply loving Sangree, expressed in its single and\r\nintense desire--pure utterly and utterly wonderful.\r\n\r\nYet, at the same time, came the feeling that it was all an illusion.\r\nI suddenly remembered the extraordinary changes the human face can\r\nundergo in circular insanity, when it changes from melancholia to\r\nelation; and I recalled the effect of hascheesh, which shows the human\r\ncountenance in the form of the bird or animal to which in character\r\nit most approximates; and for a moment I attributed this mingling of\r\nSangree’s face with a wolf to some kind of similar delusion of the\r\nsenses. I was mad, deluded, dreaming! The excitement of the day, and\r\nthis dim light of stars and bewildering mist combined to trick me. I\r\nhad been amazingly imposed upon by some false wizardry of the senses.\r\nIt was all absurd and fantastic; it would pass.\r\n\r\nAnd then, sounding across this sea of mental confusion like a bell\r\nthrough a fog, came the voice of John Silence bringing me back to a\r\nconsciousness of the reality of it all--\r\n\r\n“Sangree--in his Double!”\r\n\r\nAnd when I looked again more calmly, I plainly saw that it was indeed\r\nthe face of the Canadian, but his face turned animal, yet mingled with\r\nthe brute expression a curiously pathetic look like the soul seen\r\nsometimes in the yearning eyes of a dog,--the face of an animal shot\r\nwith vivid streaks of the human.\r\n\r\nThe doctor called to him softly under his breath--\r\n\r\n“Sangree! Sangree, you poor afflicted creature! Do you know me? Can you\r\nunderstand what it is you’re doing in your ‘Body of Desire’?”\r\n\r\nFor the first time since its appearance the creature moved. Its ears\r\ntwitched and it shifted the weight of its body on to the hind legs.\r\nThen, lifting its head and muzzle to the sky, it opened its long jaws\r\nand gave vent to a dismal and prolonged howling.\r\n\r\nBut, when I heard that howling rise to heaven, the breath caught and\r\nstrangled in my throat and it seemed that my heart missed a beat; for,\r\nthough the sound was entirely animal, it was at the same time entirely\r\nhuman. But, more than that, it was the cry I had so often heard in the\r\nWestern States of America where the Indians still fight and hunt and\r\nstruggle--it was the cry of the Redskin!\r\n\r\n“The Indian blood!” whispered John Silence, when I caught his arm for\r\nsupport; “the ancestral cry.”\r\n\r\nAnd that poignant, beseeching cry, that broken human voice, mingling\r\nwith the savage howl of the brute beast, pierced straight to my\r\nvery heart and touched there something that no music, no voice,\r\npassionate or tender, of man, woman or child has ever stirred before\r\nor since for one second into life. It echoed away among the fog and\r\nthe trees and lost itself somewhere out over the hidden sea. And some\r\npart of myself--something that was far more than the mere act of\r\nintense listening--went out with it, and for several minutes I lost\r\nconsciousness of my surroundings and felt utterly absorbed in the pain\r\nof another stricken fellow-creature.\r\n\r\nAgain the voice of John Silence recalled me to myself.\r\n\r\n“Hark!” he said aloud. “Hark!”\r\n\r\nHis tone galvanised me afresh. We stood listening side by side.\r\n\r\nFar across the island, faintly sounding through the trees and\r\nbrushwood, came a similar, answering cry. Shrill, yet wonderfully\r\nmusical, shaking the heart with a singular wild sweetness that defies\r\ndescription, we heard it rise and fall upon the night air.\r\n\r\n“It’s across the lagoon,” Dr. Silence cried, but this time in full\r\ntones that paid no tribute to caution. “It’s Joan! She’s answering him!”\r\n\r\nAgain the wonderful cry rose and fell, and that same instant the animal\r\nlowered its head, and, muzzle to earth, set off on a swift easy canter\r\nthat took it off into the mist and out of our sight like a thing of\r\nwind and vision.\r\n\r\nThe doctor made a quick dash to the door of Sangree’s tent, and,\r\nfollowing close at his heels, I peered in and caught a momentary\r\nglimpse of the small, shrunken body lying upon the branches but half\r\ncovered by the blankets--the cage from which most of the life, and not\r\na little of the actual corporeal substance, had escaped into that other\r\nform of life and energy, the body of passion and desire.\r\n\r\nBy another of those swift, incalculable processes which at this stage\r\nof my apprenticeship I failed often to grasp, Dr. Silence reclosed the\r\ncircle about the tent and body.\r\n\r\n“Now it cannot return till I permit it,” he said, and the next second\r\nwas off at full speed into the woods, with myself close behind him.\r\nI had already had some experience of my companion’s ability to run\r\nswiftly through a dense wood, and I now had the further proof of his\r\npower almost to see in the dark. For, once we left the open space\r\nabout the tents, the trees seemed to absorb all the remaining vestiges\r\nof light, and I understood that special sensibility that is said to\r\ndevelop in the blind--the sense of obstacles.\r\n\r\nAnd twice as we ran we heard the sound of that dismal howling drawing\r\nnearer and nearer to the answering faint cry from the point of the\r\nisland whither we were going.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, the trees fell away, and we emerged, hot and\r\nbreathless, upon the rocky point where the granite slabs ran bare into\r\nthe sea. It was like passing into the clearness of open day. And there,\r\nsharply defined against sea and sky, stood the figure of a human being.\r\nIt was Joan.\r\n\r\nI at once saw that there was something about her appearance that was\r\nsingular and unusual, but it was only when we had moved quite close\r\nthat I recognised what caused it. For while the lips wore a smile that\r\nlit the whole face with a happiness I had never seen there before, the\r\neyes themselves were fixed in a steady, sightless stare as though they\r\nwere lifeless and made of glass.\r\n\r\nI made an impulsive forward movement, but Dr. Silence instantly dragged\r\nme back.\r\n\r\n“No,” he cried, “don’t wake her!”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I replied aloud, struggling in his grasp.\r\n\r\n“She’s asleep. It’s somnambulistic. The shock might injure her\r\npermanently.”\r\n\r\nI turned and peered closely into his face. He was absolutely calm. I\r\nbegan to understand a little more, catching, I suppose, something of\r\nhis strong thinking.\r\n\r\n“Walking in her sleep, you mean?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded. “She’s on her way to meet him. From the very beginning he\r\nmust have drawn her--irresistibly.”\r\n\r\n“But the torn tent and the wounded flesh?”\r\n\r\n“When she did not sleep deep enough to enter the somnambulistic trance\r\nhe missed her--he went instinctively and in all innocence to seek her\r\nout--with the result, of course, that she woke and was terrified----”\r\n\r\n“Then in their heart of hearts they love?” I asked finally.\r\n\r\nJohn Silence smiled his inscrutable smile: “Profoundly,” he answered,\r\n“and as simply as only primitive souls can love. If only they both come\r\nto realise it in their normal waking states his Double will cease these\r\nnocturnal excursions. He will be cured, and at rest.”\r\n\r\nThe words had hardly left his lips when there was a sound of rustling\r\nbranches on our left, and the very next instant the dense brushwood\r\nparted where it was darkest and out rushed the swift form of an animal\r\nat full gallop. The noise of feet was scarcely audible, but in that\r\nutter stillness I heard the heavy panting breath and caught the swish\r\nof the low bushes against its sides. It went straight towards Joan--and\r\nas it went the girl lifted her head and turned to meet it. And the same\r\ninstant a canoe that had been creeping silently and unobserved round\r\nthe inner shore of the lagoon, emerged from the shadows and defined\r\nitself upon the water with a figure at the middle thwart. It was\r\nMaloney.\r\n\r\nIt was only afterwards I realised that we were invisible to him where\r\nwe stood against the dark background of trees; the figures of Joan and\r\nthe animal he saw plainly, but not Dr. Silence and myself standing just\r\nbeyond them. He stood up in the canoe and pointed with his right arm. I\r\nsaw something gleam in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Stand aside, Joan girl, or you’ll get hit,” he shouted, his voice\r\nringing horribly through the deep stillness, and the same instant a\r\npistol-shot cracked out with a burst of flame and smoke, and the figure\r\nof the animal, with one tremendous leap into the air, fell back in the\r\nshadows and disappeared like a shape of night and fog. Instantly, then,\r\nJoan opened her eyes, looked in a dazed fashion about her, and pressing\r\nboth hands against her heart, fell with a sharp cry into my arms that\r\nwere just in time to catch her.\r\n\r\nAnd an answering cry sounded across the lagoon--thin, wailing, piteous.\r\nIt came from Sangree’s tent.\r\n\r\n“Fool!” cried Dr. Silence, “you’ve wounded him!” and before we could\r\nmove or realise quite what it meant, he was in the canoe and half-way\r\nacross the lagoon.\r\n\r\nSome kind of similar abuse came in a torrent from my lips too--though\r\nI cannot remember the actual words--as I cursed the man for his\r\ndisobedience and tried to make the girl comfortable on the ground. But\r\nthe clergyman was more practical. He was spreading his coat over her\r\nand dashing water on her face.\r\n\r\n“It’s not Joan I’ve killed at any rate,” I heard him mutter as she\r\nturned and opened her eyes and smiled faintly up in his face. “I swear\r\nthe bullet went straight.”\r\n\r\nJoan stared at him; she was still dazed and bewildered, and still\r\nimagined herself with the companion of her trance. The strange lucidity\r\nof the somnambulist still hung over her brain and mind, though\r\noutwardly she appeared troubled and confused.\r\n\r\n“Where has he gone to? He disappeared so suddenly, crying that he was\r\nhurt,” she asked, looking at her father as though she did not recognise\r\nhim. “And if they’ve done anything to him--they have done it to me\r\ntoo--for he is more to me than----”\r\n\r\nHer words grew vaguer and vaguer as she returned slowly to her normal\r\nwaking state, and now she stopped altogether, as though suddenly aware\r\nthat she had been surprised into telling secrets. But all the way back,\r\nas we carried her carefully through the trees, the girl smiled and\r\nmurmured Sangree’s name and asked if he was injured, until it finally\r\nbecame clear to me that the wild soul of the one had called to the\r\nwild soul of the other and in the secret depths of their beings the\r\ncall had been heard and understood. John Silence was right. In the\r\nabyss of her heart, too deep at first for recognition, the girl loved\r\nhim, and had loved him from the very beginning. Once her normal waking\r\nconsciousness recognised the fact they would leap together like twin\r\nflames, and his affliction would be at an end; his intense desire would\r\nbe satisfied; he would be cured.\r\n\r\nAnd in Sangree’s tent Dr. Silence and I sat up for the remainder of the\r\nnight--this wonderful and haunted night that had shown us such strange\r\nglimpses of a new heaven and a new hell--for the Canadian tossed upon\r\nhis balsam boughs with high fever in his blood, and upon each cheek a\r\ndark and curious contusion showed, throbbing with severe pain although\r\nthe skin was not broken and there was no outward and visible sign of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n“Maloney shot straight, you see,” whispered Dr. Silence to me after the\r\nclergyman had gone to his tent, and had put Joan to sleep beside her\r\nmother, who, by the way, had never once awakened. “The bullet must have\r\npassed clean through the face, for both cheeks are stained. He’ll wear\r\nthese marks all his life--smaller, but always there. They’re the most\r\ncurious scars in the world, these scars transferred by repercussion\r\nfrom an injured Double. They’ll remain visible until just before his\r\ndeath, and then with the withdrawal of the subtle body they will\r\ndisappear finally.”\r\n\r\nHis words mingled in my dazed mind with the sighs of the troubled\r\nsleeper and the crying of the wind about the tent. Nothing seemed to\r\nparalyse my powers of realisation so much as these twin stains of\r\nmysterious significance upon the face before me.\r\n\r\nIt was odd, too, how speedily and easily the Camp resigned itself\r\nagain to sleep and quietness, as though a stage curtain had suddenly\r\ndropped down upon the action and concealed it; and nothing contributed\r\nso vividly to the feeling that I had been a spectator of some kind of\r\nvisionary drama as the dramatic nature of the change in the girl’s\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nYet, as a matter of fact, the change had not been so sudden and\r\nrevolutionary as appeared. Underneath, in those remoter regions\r\nof consciousness where the emotions, unknown to their owners, do\r\nsecretly mature, and owe thence their abrupt revelation to some abrupt\r\npsychological climax, there can be no doubt that Joan’s love for the\r\nCanadian had been growing steadily and irresistibly all the time. It\r\nhad now rushed to the surface so that she recognised it; that was all.\r\n\r\nAnd it has always seemed to me that the presence of John Silence,\r\nso potent, so quietly efficacious, produced an effect, if one may\r\nsay so, of a psychic forcing-house, and hastened incalculably the\r\nbringing together of these two “wild” lovers. In that sudden awakening\r\nhad occurred the very psychological climax required to reveal the\r\npassionate emotion accumulated below. The deeper knowledge had leaped\r\nacross and transferred itself to her ordinary consciousness, and in\r\nthat shock the collision of the personalities had shaken them to the\r\ndepths and shown her the truth beyond all possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\n“He’s sleeping quietly now,” the doctor said, interrupting my\r\nreflections. “If you will watch alone for a bit I’ll go to Maloney’s\r\ntent and help him to arrange his thoughts.” He smiled in anticipation\r\nof that “arrangement.” “He’ll never quite understand how a wound on the\r\nDouble can transfer itself to the physical body, but at least I can\r\npersuade him that the less he talks and ‘explains’ tomorrow, the sooner\r\nthe forces will run their natural course now to peace and quietness.”\r\n\r\nHe went away softly, and with the removal of his presence Sangree,\r\nsleeping heavily, turned over and groaned with the pain of his broken\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAnd it was in the still hour just before the dawn, when all the islands\r\nwere hushed, the wind and sea still dreaming, and the stars visible\r\nthrough clearing mists, that a figure crept silently over the ridge and\r\nreached the door of the tent where I dozed beside the sufferer, before\r\nI was aware of its presence. The flap was cautiously lifted a few\r\ninches and in looked--Joan.\r\n\r\nThat same instant Sangree woke and sat up on his bed of branches. He\r\nrecognised her before I could say a word, and uttered a low cry. It was\r\npain and joy mingled, and this time all human. And the girl too was no\r\nlonger walking in her sleep, but fully aware of what she was doing. I\r\nwas only just able to prevent him springing from his blankets.\r\n\r\n“Joan, Joan!” he cried, and in a flash she answered him, “I’m here--I’m\r\nwith you always now,” and had pushed past me into the tent and flung\r\nherself upon his breast.\r\n\r\n“I knew you would come to me in the end,” I heard him whisper.\r\n\r\n“It was all too big for me to understand at first,” she murmured, “and\r\nfor a long time I was frightened----”\r\n\r\n“But not now!” he cried louder; “you don’t feel afraid now of--of\r\nanything that’s in me----”\r\n\r\n“I fear nothing,” she cried, “nothing, nothing!”\r\n\r\nI led her outside again. She looked steadily into my face with eyes\r\nshining and her whole being transformed. In some intuitive way,\r\nsurviving probably from the somnambulism, she knew or guessed as much\r\nas I knew.\r\n\r\n“You must talk tomorrow with John Silence,” I said gently, leading her\r\ntowards her own tent. “He understands everything.”\r\n\r\nI left her at the door, and as I went back softly to take up my place\r\nof sentry again with the Canadian, I saw the first streaks of dawn\r\nlighting up the far rim of the sea behind the distant islands.\r\n\r\nAnd, as though to emphasise the eternal closeness of comedy to tragedy,\r\ntwo small details rose out of the scene and impressed me so vividly\r\nthat I remember them to this very day. For in the tent where I had\r\njust left Joan, all aquiver with her new happiness, there rose plainly\r\nto my ears the grotesque sounds of the Bo’sun’s Mate heavily snoring,\r\noblivious of all things in heaven or hell; and from Maloney’s tent, so\r\nstill was the night, where I looked across and saw the lantern’s glow,\r\nthere came to me, through the trees, the monotonous rising and falling\r\nof a human voice that was beyond question the sound of a man praying to\r\nhis God.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by_ MORRISON & GIBB LIMITED _Edinburgh_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\n  Punctuation has been standardised.
