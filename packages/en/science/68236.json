We could wax rhapsodical\r\n           in our praise, as the story is one of the finest\r\n         pieces of literature it has been our good fortune to\r\n            read. The theme is original, and yet fantastic\r\n            enough to make it rise head and shoulders above\r\n          many contemporary scientifiction stories. You will\r\n             not regret having read this marvellous tale._\r\n\r\n\r\nWest of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep\r\nwoods that no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the\r\ntrees slope fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without\r\never having caught the glint of sunlight. On the gentler slopes there\r\nare farms, ancient and rocky, with squat, moss-coated cottages brooding\r\neternally over old New England secrets in the lee of great ledges; but\r\nthese are all vacant now, the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled\r\nsides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs.\r\n\r\nThe old folk have gone away, and foreigners do not like to live there.\r\nFrench-Canadians have tried it, Italians have tried it, and the Poles\r\nhave come and departed. It is not because of anything that can be seen\r\nor heard or handled, but because of something that is imagined. The\r\nplace is not good for imagination, and does not bring restful dreams at\r\nnight. It must be this which keeps the foreigners away, for old Ammi\r\nPierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the strange\r\ndays. Ammi, whose head has been a little queer for years, is the only\r\none who still remains, or who ever talks of the strange days; and he\r\ndares to do this because his house is so near the open fields and the\r\ntravelled roads around Arkham.\r\n\r\nThere was once a road over the hills and through the valleys, that ran\r\nstraight where the blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it\r\nand a new road was laid curving far toward the south. Traces of the\r\nold one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness,\r\nand some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are\r\nflooded for the new reservoir. Then the dark woods will be cut down and\r\nthe blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will\r\nmirror the sky and ripple in the sun. And the secrets of the strange\r\ndays will be one with the deep's secrets; one with the hidden lore of\r\nold ocean, and all the mystery of primal earth.\r\n\r\nWhen I went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir\r\nthey told me the place was evil. They told me this in Arkham, and\r\nbecause that is a very old town full of witch legends I thought the\r\nevil must be something which grandmas had whispered to children\r\nthrough centuries. The name \"blasted heath\" seemed to me very odd\r\nand theatrical, and I wondered how it had come into the folklore of\r\na Puritan people. Then I saw that dark westward tangle of glens and\r\nslopes for myself, and ceased to wonder at anything besides its own\r\nelder mystery. It was morning when I saw it, but shadow lurked always\r\nthere. The trees grew too thickly, and their trunks were too big for\r\nany healthy New England wood. There was too much silence in the dim\r\nalleys between them, and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and\r\nmattings of infinite years of decay.\r\n\r\nIn the open spaces, mostly along the line of the old road, there were\r\nlittle hillside farms; sometimes with all the buildings standing,\r\nsometimes with only one or two, and sometimes with only a lone chimney\r\nor fast-filling cellar. Weeds and briers reigned, and furtive wild\r\nthings rustled in the undergrowth. Upon everything was a haze of\r\nrestlessness and oppression; a touch of the unreal and the grotesque,\r\nas if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry. I did\r\nnot wonder that the foreigners would not stay, for this was no region\r\nto sleep in. It was too much like a landscape of Salvator Rosa; too\r\nmuch like some forbidden woodcut in a tale of terror.\r\n\r\nBut even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath. I knew it the\r\nmoment I came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley; for no other\r\nname could fit such thing, or any other thing fit such a name. It\r\nwas as if the poet had coined the phrase from having seen this one\r\nparticular region. It must, I thought as I viewed it, be the outcome\r\nof a fire; but why had nothing new ever grown over those five acres of\r\ngrey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten\r\nby acid in the woods and fields? It lay largely to the north of the\r\nancient road line, but encroached a little on the other side. I felt\r\nan odd reluctance about approaching, and did so at last only because\r\nmy business took me through and past it. There was no vegetation of\r\nany kind on that broad expanse, but only a fine grey dust or ash which\r\nno wind seemed ever to blow about. The trees near it were sickly\r\nand stunted, and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim.\r\nAs I walked hurriedly by I saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an\r\nold chimney and cellar on my right, and the yawning black maw of an\r\nabandoned well whose stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the\r\nhues of the sunlight. Even the long, dark woodland climb beyond seemed\r\nwelcome in contrast, and I marvelled no more at the frightened whispers\r\nof Arkham people. There had been no house or ruin near; even in the\r\nold days the place must have been lonely and remote. And at twilight,\r\ndreading to repass that ominous spot, I walked circuitously back to the\r\ntown by the curving road on the south. I vaguely wished some clouds\r\nwould gather, for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had\r\ncrept into my soul.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath,\r\nand what was meant by that phrase \"strange days\" which so many\r\nevasively muttered. I could not, however, get any good answers, except\r\nthat all the mystery was much more recent than I had dreamed. It was\r\nnot a matter of old legendry at all, but something within the lifetime\r\nof those who spoke. It had happened in the 'eighties, and a family had\r\ndisappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact; and because\r\nthey all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce's crazy tales,\r\nI sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone in\r\nthe ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very\r\nthick. It was a fearsomely ancient place, and had begun to exude the\r\nfaint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long.\r\nOnly with persistent knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he\r\nshuffled timidly to the door I could tell he was not glad to see me. He\r\nwas not so feeble as I had expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious\r\nway, and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn\r\nand dismal.\r\n\r\nNot knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned\r\na matter of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague\r\nquestions about the district. He was far brighter and more educated\r\nthan I had been led to think, and before I knew it had grasped quite\r\nas much of the subject as any man I had talked with in Arkham. He was\r\nnot like other rustics I had known in the sections where reservoirs\r\nwere to be. From him there were no protests at the miles of old wood\r\nand farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there would have been\r\nhad not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief\r\nwas all that he showed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys\r\nthrough which he had roamed all his life. They were better under water\r\nnow--better under water since the strange days. And with this opening\r\nhis husky voice sank low, while his body leaned forward and his right\r\nforefinger began to point shakily and impressively.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was then that I heard the story, and as the rambling voice scraped\r\nand whispered on I shivered again and again despite the summer day.\r\nOften I had to recall the speaker from ramblings, piece out scientific\r\npoints which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors'\r\ntalk, or bridge over gaps, where his sense of logic and continuity\r\nbroke down. When he was done I did not wonder that his mind had snapped\r\na trifle, or that the folk of Arkham would not speak much of the\r\nblasted heath. I hurried back before sunset to my hotel, unwilling to\r\nhave the stars come out above me in the open; and the next day returned\r\nto Boston to give up my position. I could not go into that dim chaos\r\nof old forest and slope again, or face another time that grey blasted\r\nheath where the black well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and\r\nstones. The reservoir will soon be built now, and all those elder\r\nsecrets will lie safe forever under watery fathoms. But even then I do\r\nnot believe I would like to visit that country by night--at least not\r\nwhen the sinister stars are out; and nothing could bribe me to drink\r\nthe new city water of Arkham.\r\n\r\nIt all began, old Ammi said, with the meteorite. Before that time there\r\nhad been no wild legends at all since the witch trials, and even then\r\nthese western woods were not feared half so much as the small island\r\nin the Miskatonic where the devil held court beside a curious stone\r\naltar older than the Indians. These were not haunted woods, and their\r\nfantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange days. Then there\r\nhad come that white noontide cloud, that string of explosions in the\r\nair, and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood. And by\r\nnight all Arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky\r\nand bedded itself in the ground beside the well at the Nahum Gardner\r\nplace. That was the house which had stood where the blasted heath was\r\nto come--the trim white Nahum Gardner house amidst its fertile gardens\r\nand orchards.\r\n\r\nNahum had come to town to tell people about the stone, and had dropped\r\nin at Ammi Pierce's on the way. Ammi was forty then, and all the queer\r\nthings were fixed very strongly in his mind. He and his wife had gone\r\nwith the three professors from Miskatonic University who hastened out\r\nthe next morning to see the weird visitor from unknown stellar space,\r\nand had wondered why Nahum had called it so large the day before. It\r\nhad shrunk, Nahum said as he pointed out the big brownish mound above\r\nthe ripped earth and charred grass near the archaic well-sweep in his\r\nfront yard; but the wise men answered that stones do not shrink. Its\r\nheat lingered persistently, and Nahum declared it had glowed faintly in\r\nthe night. The professors tried it with a geologist's hammer and found\r\nit was oddly soft. It was, in truth, so soft as to be almost plastic;\r\nand they gouged rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the\r\ncollege for testing. They took it in an old pail borrowed from Nahum's\r\nkitchen, for even the small piece refused to grow cool. On the trip\r\nback they stopped at Ammi's to rest, and seemed thoughtful when Mrs.\r\nPierce remarked that the fragment was growing smaller and burning the\r\nbottom of the pail. Truly, it was not large, but perhaps they had taken\r\nless than they thought.\r\n\r\nThe day after that--all this was in June of '82--the professors had\r\ntrooped out again in a great excitement. As they passed Ammi's they\r\ntold him what queer things the specimen had done, and how it had\r\nfaded wholly away when they put it in a glass beaker. The beaker had\r\ngone, too, and the wise men talked of the strange stone's affinity\r\nfor silicon. It had acted quite unbelievably in that well-ordered\r\nlaboratory; doing nothing at all and showing no occluded gases when\r\nheated on charcoal, being wholly negative in the borax bead, and soon\r\nproving itself absolutely non-volatile at any producible temperature,\r\nincluding that of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. On an anvil it appeared\r\nhighly malleable, and in the dark its luminosity was very marked.\r\nStubbornly refusing to grow cool, it soon had the college in a state\r\nof real excitement; and when upon heating before the spectroscope it\r\ndisplayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum\r\nthere was much breathless talk of new elements, bizarre optical\r\nproperties, and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to\r\nsay when faced by the unknown.\r\n\r\nHot as it was, they tested it in a crucible with all the proper\r\nreagents. Water did nothing. Hydrochloric acid was the same. Nitric\r\nacid and even aqua regia merely hissed and spattered against its torrid\r\ninvulnerability. Ammi had difficulty in recalling all these things, but\r\nrecognized some solvents as I mentioned them in the usual order of use.\r\nThere were ammonia and caustic soda, alcohol and ether, nauseous carbon\r\ndisulphide and a dozen others; but although the weight grew steadily\r\nless as time passed, and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling,\r\nthere was no change in the solvents to show that they had attacked\r\nthe substance at all. It was a metal, though, beyond a doubt. It was\r\nmagnetic, for one thing; and after its immersion in the acid solvents\r\nthere seemed to be faint traces of the WidmÃ¤nstÃ¤tten figures found\r\non meteoric iron. When the cooling had grown very considerable, the\r\ntesting was carried on in glass; and it was in a glass beaker that they\r\nleft all the chips made of the original fragment during the work. The\r\nnext morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace, and only a\r\ncharred spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had been.\r\n\r\nAll this the professors told Ammi as they paused at his door, and\r\nonce more he went with them to see the stony messenger from the\r\nstars, though this time his wife did not accompany him. It had now\r\nmost certainly shrunk, and even the sober professors could not doubt\r\nthe truth of what they saw. All around the dwindling brown lump near\r\nthe well was a vacant space, except where the earth had caved in;\r\nand whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before, it\r\nwas now scarcely five. It was still hot, and the sages studied its\r\nsurface curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer\r\nand chisel. They gouged deeply this time, and as they pried away\r\nthe smaller mass they saw that the core of the thing was not quite\r\nhomogeneous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured\r\nglobule embedded in the substance. The colour, which resembled some\r\nof the bands in the meteor's strange spectrum, was almost impossible\r\nto describe; and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at\r\nall. Its texture was glossy, and upon tapping it appeared to promise\r\nboth brittleness and hollowness. One of the professors gave it a smart\r\nblow with a hammer, and it burst with a nervous little pop. Nothing was\r\nemitted, and all trace of the thing vanished with the puncturing. It\r\nleft behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across, and all\r\nthought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing\r\nsubstance wasted away.\r\n\r\nConjecture was vain; so after a futile attempt to find additional\r\nglobules by drilling, the seekers left again with their new\r\nspecimen--which proved, however, as baffling in the laboratory as\r\nits predecessor. Aside from being almost plastic, having heat,\r\nmagnetism, and slight luminosity, cooling slightly in powerful acids,\r\npossessing an unknown spectrum, wasting away in air, and attacking\r\nsilicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result, it presented\r\nno identifying features whatsoever; and at the end of the tests the\r\ncollege scientists were forced to own that they could not place it. It\r\nwas nothing of this earth, but a piece of the great outside; and as\r\nsuch dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside laws.\r\n\r\nThat night there was a thunderstorm, and when the professors went out\r\nto Nahum's the next day they met with a bitter disappointment. The\r\nstone, magnetic as it had been, must have had some peculiar electrical\r\nproperty; for it had \"drawn the lightning,\" as Nahum said, with a\r\nsingular persistence. Six times within an hour the farmer saw the\r\nlightning strike the furrow in the front yard, and when the storm was\r\nover nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient well-sweep,\r\nhalf-chocked with caved-in earth. Digging had borne no fruit, and the\r\nscientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment. The failure was\r\ntotal; so that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and\r\ntest again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead. That\r\nfragment lasted a week, at the end of which nothing of value had been\r\nlearned of it. When it had gone, no residue was left behind, and in\r\ntime the professors felt scarcely sure they had indeed seen with waking\r\neyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs outside; that lone,\r\nweird message from other universes and other realms of matter, force,\r\nand entity.\r\n\r\nAs was natural, the Arkham papers made much of the incident with its\r\ncollegiate sponsoring, and sent reporters to talk with Nahum Gardner\r\nand his family. At least one Boston daily also sent a scribe, and Nahum\r\nquickly became a kind of local celebrity. He was a lean, genial person\r\nof about fifty, living with his wife and three sons on the pleasant\r\nfarmstead in the valley. He and Ammi exchanged visits frequently, as\r\ndid their wives; and Ammi had nothing but praise for him after all\r\nthese years. He seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had\r\nattracted, and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks.\r\nThat July and August were hot; and Nahum worked hard at his haying in\r\nthe ten-acre pasture across Chapman's Brook; his rattling wain wearing\r\ndeep ruts in the shadowy lanes between. The labour tired him more than\r\nit had in other years, and he felt that age was beginning to tell on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen fell the time of fruit and harvest. The pears and apples slowly\r\nripened, and Nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never\r\nbefore. The fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss,\r\nand in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the\r\nfuture crop. But with the ripening came sore disappointment, for of all\r\nthat gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was\r\nfit to eat. Into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had crept\r\na stealthy bitterness and sickishness, so that even the smallest of\r\nbites induced a lasting disgust. It was the same with the melons and\r\ntomatoes, and Nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost. Quick to\r\nconnect events, he declared that the meteorite had poisoned the soil,\r\nand thanked Heaven that most of the other crops were in the upland lot\r\nalong the road.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWinter came early, and was very cold. Ammi saw Nahum less often than\r\nusual, and observed that he had begun to look worried. The rest of his\r\nfamily too, seemed to have grown taciturn; and were far from steady\r\nin their churchgoing or their attendance at the various social events\r\nof the countryside. For this reserve or melancholy no cause could be\r\nfound, though all the household confessed now and then to poorer health\r\nand a feeling of vague disquiet. Nahum himself gave the most definite\r\nstatement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about certain\r\nfootprints in the snow. They were the usual winter prints of red\r\nsquirrels, white rabbits, and foxes, but the brooding farmer professed\r\nto see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement.\r\nHe was never specific, but appeared to think that they were not as\r\ncharacteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and\r\nfoxes as they ought to be. Ammi listened without interest to this talk\r\nuntil one night when he drove past Nahum's house in his sleigh on the\r\nway back from Clark's Corners. There had been a moon, and a rabbit had\r\nrun across the road; and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than\r\neither Ammi or his horse liked. The latter, indeed, had almost run away\r\nwhen brought up by a firm rein. Thereafter Ammi gave Nahum's tales\r\nmore respect, and wondered why the Gardner dogs seemed so cowed and\r\nquivering every morning. They had, it developed, nearly lost the spirit\r\nto bark.\r\n\r\nIn February the McGregor boys from Meadow Hill were out shooting\r\nwoodchucks, and not far from the Gardner place bagged a very peculiar\r\nspecimen. The proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a\r\nqueer way impossible to describe, while its face had taken on an\r\nexpression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before. The boys were\r\ngenuinely frightened, and threw the thing away at once, so that only\r\ntheir grotesque tales of it ever reached the people of the countryside.\r\nBut the shying of horses near Nahum's house had now become an\r\nacknowledged thing, and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend\r\nwas fast taking form.\r\n\r\nPeople vowed that the snow melted faster around Nahum's than it did\r\nanywhere else, and early in March there was an awed discussion in\r\nPotter's general store at Clark's Corners. Stephen Rice had driven past\r\nGardner's in the morning, and had noticed the skunk-cabbages coming\r\nup through the mud by the woods across the road. Never were things of\r\nsuch size seen before, and they held strange colours that could not\r\nbe put into any words. Their shapes were monstrous, and the horse had\r\nsnorted at an odour which struck Stephen as wholly unprecedented. That\r\nafternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth, and\r\nall agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy\r\nworld. The bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned, and it\r\nwent from mouth to mouth that there was poison in Nahum's ground. Of\r\ncourse it was the meteorite; and remembering how strange the men from\r\nthe college had found that stone to be, several farmers spoke about the\r\nmatter to them.\r\n\r\nOne day they paid Nahum a visit; but having no love of wild tales and\r\nfolklore were very conservative in what they inferred. The plants were\r\ncertainly odd, but all skunk-cabbages are more or less odd in shape\r\nand hue. Perhaps some mineral element from the stone had entered the\r\nsoil, but it would soon be washed away. And as for the footprints and\r\nfrightened horses--of course this was mere country talk which such\r\na phenomenon as the aerolite would be certain to start. There was\r\nreally nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip, for\r\nsuperstitious rustics will say and believe anything. And so all through\r\nthe strange days the professors stayed away in contempt. Only one\r\nof them, when given two phials of dust for analysis in a police job\r\nover a year and a half later, recalled that the queer colour of that\r\nskunk-cabbage had been very like one of the anomalous bands of light\r\nshown by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope, and like the\r\nbrittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss. The samples\r\nin this analysis case gave the same odd bands at first, though later\r\nthey lost the property.\r\n\r\nThe trees budded prematurely around Nahum's, and at night they swayed\r\nominously in the wind. Nahum's second son Thaddeus, a lad of fifteen,\r\nswore that they swayed also when there was no wind; but even the\r\ngossips would not credit this. Certainly, however, restlessness was\r\nin the air. The entire Gardner family developed the habit of stealthy\r\nlistening, though not for any sound which they could consciously\r\nname. The listening was, indeed, rather a product of moments when\r\nconsciousness seemed half to slip away. Unfortunately such moments\r\nincreased week by week, till it became common speech that \"something\r\nwas wrong with all Nahum's folks.\" When the early saxifrage came out it\r\nhad another strange colour; not quite like that of the skunk-cabbage,\r\nbut plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it. Nahum\r\ntook some blossoms to Arkham and showed them to the editor of the\r\n_Gazette_, but that dignitary did no more than write a humorous article\r\nabout them, in which the dark fears of rustics were held up to polite\r\nridicule. It was a mistake of Nahum's to tell a stolid city man about\r\nthe way the great, overgrown mourning-cloak butterflies behaved in\r\nconnection with these saxifrages.\r\n\r\nApril brought a kind of madness to the country folk, and began that\r\ndisuse of the road past Nahum's which led to its ultimate abandonment.\r\nIt was next the vegetation. All the orchard trees blossomed forth in\r\nstrange colours, and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent\r\npasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could\r\nconnect with the proper flora of the region. No sane wholesome colours\r\nwere anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but\r\neverywhere were those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased,\r\nunderlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth.\r\nThe \"Dutchman's breeches\" became a thing of sinister menace, and the\r\nbloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the\r\nGardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting\r\nfamiliarity, and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule\r\nin the meteor. Nahum ploughed and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the\r\nupland lot, but did nothing with the land around the house. He knew it\r\nwould be of no use, and hoped that the summer's strange growths would\r\ndraw all the poison from the soil. He was prepared for almost anything\r\nnow, and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting\r\nto be heard. The shunning of his house by neighbours told on him, of\r\ncourse; but it told on his wife more. The boys were better off, being\r\nat school each day; but they could not help being frightened by the\r\ngossip. Thaddeus, an especially sensitive youth, suffered the most.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn May the insects came, and Nahum's place became a nightmare of\r\nbuzzing and crawling. Most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in\r\ntheir aspects and motions, and their nocturnal habits contradicted all\r\nformer experience. The Gardners took to watching at night--watching in\r\nall directions at random for something they could not tell what. It was\r\nthen that they all owned that Thaddeus had been right about the trees.\r\nMrs. Gardner was the next to see it from the window as she watched the\r\nswollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky. The boughs surely\r\nmoved, and there was no wind. It must be the sap. Strangeness had come\r\ninto everything growing now. Yet it was none of Nahum's family at all\r\nwho made the next discovery. Familiarity had dulled them, and what they\r\ncould not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from Bolton who\r\ndrove by one night in ignorance of the country legends. What he told in\r\nArkham was given a short paragraph in the _Gazette_; and it was there\r\nthat all the farmers, Nahum included, saw it first. The night had been\r\ndark and the buggy-lamps faint, but around a farm in the valley which\r\neveryone knew from the account must be Nahum's, the darkness had been\r\nless thick. A dim though distinct luminosity seemed to inhere in all\r\nthe vegetation, grass, leaves, and blossoms alike, while at one moment\r\na detached piece of the phosphorescence appeared to stir furtively in\r\nthe yard near the barn.\r\n\r\nThe grass had so far seemed untouched, and the cows were freely\r\npastured in the lot near the house, but toward the end of May the milk\r\nbegan to be bad. Then Nahum had the cows driven to the uplands, after\r\nwhich this trouble ceased. Not long after this the change in grass and\r\nleaves became apparent to the eye. All the verdure was going grey,\r\nand was developing a highly singular quality of brittleness. Ammi\r\nwas now the only person who ever visited the place, and his visits\r\nwere becoming fewer and fewer. When school closed the Gardners were\r\nvirtually cut off from the world, and sometimes let Ammi do their\r\nerrands in town. They were failing curiously both physically and\r\nmentally, and no one was surprised when the news of Mrs. Gardner's\r\nmadness stole around.\r\n\r\nIt happened in June, about the anniversary of the meteor's fall, and\r\nthe poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not\r\ndescribe. In her raving there was not a single specific noun, but\r\nonly verbs and pronouns. Things moved and changed and fluttered, and\r\nears tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds. Something\r\nwas taken away--she was being drained of something--something was\r\nfastening itself on her that ought not to be--someone must make it\r\nkeep off--nothing was ever still in the night--the walls and windows\r\nshifted. Nahum did not send her to the county asylum, but let her\r\nwander about the house as long as she was harmless to herself and\r\nothers. Even when her expression changed he did nothing. But when the\r\nboys grew afraid of her, and Thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she\r\nmade faces at him, he decided to keep her locked in the attic. By July\r\nshe had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours, and before that month\r\nwas over Nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly luminous in the\r\ndark, as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby vegetation.\r\n\r\nIt was a little before this that the horses had stampeded. Something\r\nhad aroused them in the night, and their neighing and kicking in their\r\nstalls had been terrible. There seemed virtually nothing to do to calm\r\nthem, and when Nahum opened the stable door they all bolted out like\r\nfrightened woodland deer. It took a week to track all four, and when\r\nfound they were seen to be quite useless and unmanageable. Something\r\nhad snapped in their brains, and each one had to be shot for its own\r\ngood. Nahum borrowed a horse from Ammi for his haying, but found it\r\nwould not approach the barn. It shied, balked, and whinnied, and in\r\nthe end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men\r\nused their own strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft\r\nfor convenient pitching. And all the while the vegetation was turning\r\ngrey and brittle. Even the flowers whose hues had been so strange\r\nwere graying now, and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and\r\ntasteless. The asters and goldenrod bloomed grey and distorted, and\r\nthe roses and zinnias and hollyhocks in the front yard were such\r\nblasphemous-looking things that Nahum's oldest boy Zenas cut them down.\r\nThe strangely puffed insects died about that time, even the bees that\r\nhad left their hives and taken to the woods.\r\n\r\nBy September all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish\r\npowder, and Nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison\r\nwas out of the soil. His wife now had spells of terrific screaming,\r\nand he and the boys were in a constant state of nervous tension.\r\nThey shunned people now, and when school opened the boys did not go.\r\nBut it was Ammi, on one of his rare visits, who first realized that\r\nthe well water was no longer good. It had an evil taste that was not\r\nexactly fetid nor exactly salty, and Ammi advised his friend to dig\r\nanother well on higher ground to use till the soil was good again.\r\nNahum, however, ignored the warning, for he had by that time become\r\ncalloused to strange and unpleasant things. He and the boys continued\r\nto use the tainted supply, drinking it as listlessly and mechanically\r\nas they ate their meagre and ill-cooked meals and did their thankless\r\nand monotonous chores through the aimless days. There was something of\r\nstolid resignation about them all, as if they walked half in another\r\nworld between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom.\r\n\r\nThaddeus went mad in September after a visit to the well. He had gone\r\nwith a pail and had come back empty-handed, shrieking and waving his\r\narms, and sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about\r\n\"the moving colours down there.\" Two in one family was pretty bad,\r\nbut Nahum was very brave about it. He let the boy run about for a\r\nweek until he began stumbling and hurting himself, and then he shut\r\nhim in an attic room across the hall from his mother's. The way they\r\nscreamed at each other from behind their locked doors was very\r\nterrible, especially to little Merwin, who fancied they talked in some\r\nterrible language that was not of earth. Merwin was getting frightfully\r\nimaginative, and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of\r\nthe brother who had been his greatest playmate.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced.\r\nPoultry turned greyish and died very quickly, their meat being found\r\ndry and noisome upon cutting. Hogs grew inordinately fat, then suddenly\r\nbegan to undergo loathsome changes which no one could explain. Their\r\nmeat was of course useless, and Nahum was at his wit's end. No rural\r\nveterinary would approach his place, and the city veterinary from\r\nArkham was openly baffled. The swine began growing grey and brittle\r\nand falling to pieces before they died, and their eyes and muzzles\r\ndeveloped singular alterations. It was very inexplicable, for they had\r\nnever been fed from the tainted vegetation. Then something struck the\r\ncows. Certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily\r\nshrivelled or compressed, and atrocious collapses or disintegrations\r\nwere common. In the last stages--and death was always the result--there\r\nwould be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs.\r\nThere could be no question of poison, for all the cases occurred in a\r\nlocked and undisturbed barn. No bites of prowling things could have\r\nbrought the virus, for what live beast of earth can pass through solid\r\nobstacles? It must be only natural disease--yet what disease could\r\nwreak such results was beyond any mind's guessing. When the harvest\r\ncame there was not an animal surviving on the place, for the stock\r\nand poultry were dead and the dogs had run away. These dogs, three\r\nin number, had all vanished one night and were never heard of again.\r\nThe five cats had left some time before, but their going was scarcely\r\nnoticed since there now seemed to be no mice, and only Mrs. Gardner had\r\nmade pets of the graceful felines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth of October Nahum staggered into Ammi's house with\r\nhideous news. The death had come to poor Thaddeus in his attic room,\r\nand it had come in a way which could not be told. Nahum had dug a grave\r\nin the railed family plot behind the farm, and had put therein what\r\nhe found. There could have been nothing from outside, for the small\r\nbarred window and locked door were intact; but it was much as it had\r\nbeen in the barn. Ammi and his wife consoled the stricken man as best\r\nthey could, but shuddered as they did so. Stark terror seemed to cling\r\nround the Gardners and all they touched, and the very presence of one\r\nin the house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnameable. Ammi\r\naccompanied Nahum home with the greatest reluctance, and did what he\r\nmight to calm the hysterical sobbing of little Merwin. Zenas needed no\r\ncalming. He had come of late to do nothing but stare into space and\r\nobey what his father told him; and Ammi thought that his fate was very\r\nmerciful. Now and then Merwin's screams were answered faintly from the\r\nattic, and in response to an inquiring look Nahum said that his wife\r\nwas getting very feeble. When night approached, Ammi managed to get\r\naway; for not even friendship could make him stay in that spot when the\r\nfaint glow of the vegetation began and the trees may or may not have\r\nswayed without wind. It was really lucky for Ammi that he was not more\r\nimaginative. Even as things were, his mind was bent ever so slightly;\r\nbut had he been able to connect and reflect upon all the portents\r\naround him he must inevitably have turned a total maniac. In the\r\ntwilight he hastened home, the screams of the mad woman and the nervous\r\nchild ringing horrible in his ears.\r\n\r\nThree days later Nahum burst into Ammi's kitchen in the early morning,\r\nand in the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale once\r\nmore, while Mrs. Pierce listened in a clutching fright. It was little\r\nMerwin this time. He was gone. He had gone out late at night with a\r\nlantern and pail for water, and had never come back. He'd been going\r\nto pieces for days, and hardly knew what he was about. Screamed at\r\neverything. There had been a frantic shriek from the yard then, but\r\nbefore the father could get to the door the boy was gone. There was no\r\nglow from the lantern he had taken, and of the child himself no trace.\r\nAt the time Nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too; but when\r\ndawn came, and the man had plodded back from his all-night search of\r\nthe woods and fields, he had found some very curious things near the\r\nwell. There was a crushed and apparently somewhat melted mass of iron\r\nwhich had certainly been the lantern; while a bent pail and twisted\r\niron hoops beside it, both half-fused, seemed to hint at the remnants\r\nof the pail. That was all. Nahum was past imagining, Mrs. Pierce was\r\nblank, and Ammi, when he had reached home and heard the tale, could\r\ngive no guess. Merwin was gone, and there would be no use in telling\r\nthe people around, who shunned all Gardners now. No use, either, in\r\ntelling the city people at Arkham who laughed at everything. Thad was\r\ngone, and now Merwin was gone. Something was creeping and creeping and\r\nwaiting to be seen and heard. Nahum would go soon, and he wanted Ammi\r\nto look after his wife and Zenas if they survived him. It must all be a\r\njudgment of some sort; though he could not fancy what for, since he had\r\nalways walked uprightly in the Lord's ways so far as he knew.\r\n\r\nFor over two weeks Ammi saw nothing of Nahum; and then, worried about\r\nwhat might have happened, he overcame his fears and paid the Gardner\r\nplace a visit. There was no smoke from the great chimney, and for a\r\nmoment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst. The aspect of the\r\nwhole farm was shocking--greyish withered grass and leaves on the\r\nground, vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and\r\ngables, and great bare trees clawing up at the grey November sky with\r\na studied malevolence which Ammi could not but feel had come from some\r\nsubtle change in the tilt of the branches. But Nahum was alive, after\r\nall. He was weak, and lying in a couch in the low-ceiled kitchen,\r\nbut perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to Zenas. The\r\nroom was deadly cold; and as Ammi visibly shivered, the host shouted\r\nhuskily to Zenas for more wood. Wood, indeed, was sorely needed; since\r\nthe cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty, with a cloud of soot\r\nblowing about in the chill wind that came down the chimney. Presently\r\nNahum asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable,\r\nand then Ammi saw what had happened. The stoutest cord had broken at\r\nlast, and the hapless farmer's mind was proof against more sorrow.\r\n\r\nQuestioning tactfully, Ammi could get no clear data at all about the\r\nmissing Zenas. \"In the well--he lives in the well--\" was all that the\r\nclouded father would say. Then there flashed across the visitor's mind\r\na sudden thought of the mad wife, and he changed his line of inquiry.\r\n\"Nabby? Why, here she is!\" was the surprised response of poor Nahum,\r\nand Ammi soon saw that he must search for himself. Leaving the harmless\r\nbabbler on the couch, he took the keys from their nail beside the door\r\nand climbed the creaking stairs to the attic. It was very close and\r\nnoisome up there, and no sound could be heard from any direction. Of\r\nthe four doors in sight, only one was locked, and on this he tried\r\nvarious keys on the ring he had taken. The third key proved the right\r\none, and after some fumbling Ammi threw open the low white door.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark inside, for the window was small and half-obscured\r\nby the crude wooden bars; and Ammi could see nothing at all on the\r\nwide-planked floor. The stench was beyond enduring, and before\r\nproceeding further he had to retreat to another room and return\r\nwith his lungs filled with breathable air. When he did enter he saw\r\nsomething dark in the corner, and upon seeing it more clearly he\r\nscreamed outright. While he screamed he thought a momentary cloud\r\neclipsed the window, and a second later he felt himself brushed as if\r\nby some hateful current of vapour. Strange colours danced before his\r\neyes; and had not a present horror numbed him he would have thought of\r\nthe globule in the meteor that the geologist's hammer had shattered,\r\nand of the morbid vegetation that had sprouted in the spring. As it\r\nwas he thought only of the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted\r\nhim, and which all too clearly had shared the nameless fate of young\r\nThaddeus and the livestock. But the terrible thing about the horror was\r\nthat it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to crumble.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmmi would give me no added particulars of this scene, but the shape\r\nin the corners does not re-appear in his tale as a moving object.\r\nThere are things which cannot be mentioned, and what is done in common\r\nhumanity is sometimes cruelly judged by the law. I gathered that no\r\nmoving thing was left in that attic room, and that to leave anything\r\ncapable of motion there would have been a deed so monstrous as to damn\r\nany accountable being to eternal torment. Anyone but a stolid farmer\r\nwould have fainted or gone mad, but Ammi walked conscious through that\r\nlow doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him. There would be\r\nNahum to deal with now; he must be fed and tended, and removed to some\r\nplace where he could be cared for.\r\n\r\nCommencing his descent of the dark stairs, Ammi heard a thud below him.\r\nHe even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off, and recalled\r\nnervously the clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful\r\nroom above. What presence had his cry and entry started up? Halted by\r\nsome vague fear, he heard still further sounds below. Indubitably there\r\nwas a sort of heavy dragging, and a most detestably sticky noise as\r\nof some fiendish and unclean species of suction. With an associative\r\nsense goaded to feverish heights, he thought unaccountably of what he\r\nhad seen upstairs. Good God! What eldritch dream-world was this into\r\nwhich he had blundered? He dared move neither backward nor forward, but\r\nstood there trembling at the black curve of the boxed-in staircase.\r\nEvery trifle of the scene burned itself into his brain. The sounds, the\r\nsense of dread expectancy, the darkness, the steepness of the narrow\r\nsteps--and merciful Heaven!--the faint but unmistakable luminosity of\r\nall the woodwork in sight; steps, sides, exposed laths, and beams alike.\r\n\r\nThen there burst forth a frantic whinny from Ammi's horse outside,\r\nfollowed at once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway. In\r\nanother moment horse and buggy had gone beyond earshot, leaving the\r\nfrightened man on the dark stairs to guess what had sent them. But that\r\nwas not all. There had been another sound out there. A sort of liquid\r\nsplash--water--it must have been the well. He had left Hero untied\r\nnear it, and a buggy-wheel must have brushed the coping and knocked in\r\na stone. And still the pale phosphorescense glowed in that detestably\r\nancient woodwork. God! how old the house was! Most of it built before\r\n1700.\r\n\r\nA feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly, and\r\nAmmi's grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic\r\nfor some purpose. Slowly nerving himself, he finished his descent and\r\nwalked boldly toward the kitchen. But he did not complete the walk,\r\nbecause what he sought was no longer there. It had come to meet him,\r\nand it was still alive after a fashion. Whether it had crawled or\r\nwhether it had been dragged by any external forces, Ammi could not\r\nsay; but the death had been at it. Everything had happened in the last\r\nhalf-hour, but collapse, greying, and disintegration were already far\r\nadvanced. There was a horrible brittleness, and dry fragments were\r\nscaling off. Ammi could not touch it, but looked horrifiedly into the\r\ndistorted parody that had been a face. \"What was it, Nahum--what\r\nwas it?\" He whispered, and the cleft, bulging lips were just able to\r\ncrackle out a final answer.\r\n\r\n\"Nothin' ... nothin' ... the colour ... it burns ... cold an' wet, but\r\nit burns ... it lived in the well.... I seen it ... a kind o' smoke ...\r\njest like the flowers last spring ... the well shone at night.... Thad\r\nan' Merwin an' Zenas ... everything alive ... suckin' the life out of\r\neverything ... in that stone ... it must o' come in that stone ...\r\npizened the whole place ... dun't know what it wants ... that round\r\nthing them men from the college dug outen the stone ... they smashed\r\nit ... it was that same colour ... jest the same, like the flowers an'\r\nplants ... must a' ben more of 'em ... seeds ... seeds ... they\r\ngrowed ... I seen it the fust time this week ... must a' got strong\r\non Zenas ... he was a big boy, full o' life ... it beats down your\r\nmind an' then gits ye ... burns ye up ... in the well water ... you\r\nwas right about that ... evil water ... Zenas never come back from the\r\nwell ... can't git away ... draws ye ... ye know summ'at's comin', but\r\n'tain't no use ... I seen it time an' agin Zenas was took ... whar's\r\nNabby, Ammi? ... my head's no good ... dun't know how long sence I fed\r\nher ... it'll git her ef we ain't keerful ... jest a colour ... her\r\nface is gittin' to hev that colour sometimes towards night ... an' it\r\nburns an' sucks ... it come from some place whar things ain't as they\r\nis here ... one o' them professors said so ... he was right ... look\r\nout, Ammi, it'll do suthin' more ... sucks the life out....\"\r\n\r\nBut that was all. That which spoke could speak no more because it had\r\ncompletely caved in. Ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was\r\nleft and reeled out the back door into the fields. He climbed the slope\r\nto the ten-acre pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the\r\nwoods. He could not pass that well from which his horses had run away.\r\nHe had looked at it through the window, and had seen that no stone\r\nwas missing from the rim. Then the lurching buggy had not dislodged\r\nanything after all--the splash had been something else--something which\r\nwent into the well after it had done with poor Nahum....\r\n\r\nWhen Ammi reached his house the horses and buggy had arrived before\r\nhim and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety. Reassuring her without\r\nexplanations, he set out at once for Arkham and notified the\r\nauthorities that the Gardner family was no more. He indulged in no\r\ndetails, but merely told of the deaths of Nahum and Nabby, that of\r\nThaddeus being already known, and mentioned that the cause seemed to\r\nbe the same strange ailment which had killed the livestock. He also\r\nstated that Merwin and Zenas had disappeared. There was considerable\r\nquestioning at the police station, and in the end Ammi was compelled\r\nto take three officers to the Gardner farm, together with the coroner,\r\nthe medical examiner, and the veterinary who had treated the diseased\r\nanimals. He went much against his will, for the afternoon was advancing\r\nand he feared the fall of night over that accursed place, but it was\r\nsome comfort to have so many people with him.\r\n\r\nThe six men drove out in a democrat-wagon, following Ammi's buggy, and\r\narrived at the pest-ridden farmhouse about four o'clock. Used as the\r\nofficers were to gruesome experiences, not one remained unmoved at\r\nwhat was found in the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on\r\nthe floor below. The whole aspect of the farm with its grey desolation\r\nwas terrible enough, but those two crumbling objects were beyond all\r\nbounds. No one could look long at them, and even the medical examiner\r\nadmitted that there was very little to examine. Specimens could be\r\nanalysed, of course, so he busied himself in obtaining them--and here\r\nit develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college\r\nlaboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken. Under the\r\nspectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum, in which many\r\nof the baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange\r\nmeteor had yielded in the previous year. The property of emitting this\r\nspectrum vanished in a month, the dust thereafter consisting mainly of\r\nalkaline phosphates and carbonates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmmi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they\r\nmeant to do anything then and there. It was getting toward sunset, and\r\nhe was anxious to be away. But he could not help glancing nervously\r\nat the stony curb by the great sweep, and when a detective questioned\r\nhim he admitted that Nahum had feared something down there--so much so\r\nthat he had never even thought of searching it for Merwin or Zenas.\r\nAfter that nothing would do but that they empty and explore the well\r\nimmediately, so Ammi had to wait trembling while pail after pail of\r\nrank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside.\r\nThe men sniffed in disgust at the fluid, and toward the last held their\r\nnoses against the foetor they were uncovering. It was not so long a\r\njob as they had feared it would be, since the water was phenomenally\r\nlow. There is no need to speak too exactly of what they found. Merwin\r\nand Zenas were both there, in part, though the vestiges were mainly\r\nskeletal. There were also a small deer and a large dog in about the\r\nsame state, and a number of bones of smaller animals. The ooze and\r\nslime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling, and a man\r\nwho descended on hand-holds with a long pole found that he could sink\r\nthe wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting\r\nany solid obstruction.\r\n\r\nTwilight had now fallen, and lanterns were brought from the house.\r\nThen, when it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the\r\nwell, everyone went indoors and conferred in the ancient sitting-room\r\nwhile the intermittent light of a spectral half-moon played wanly on\r\nthe grey desolation outside. The men were frankly nonplussed by the\r\nentire case, and could find no convincing common element to link the\r\nstrange vegetable conditions, the unknown disease of livestock and\r\nhumans, and the unaccountable deaths of Merwin and Zenas in the tainted\r\nwell. They had heard the common country talk, it is true; but could not\r\nbelieve that anything contrary to natural law had occurred. No doubt\r\nthe meteor had poisoned the soil, but the illness of person and animals\r\nwho had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another matter. Was it the\r\nwell water? Very possibly. It might be a good idea to analyse it. But\r\nwhat peculiar madness could have made both boys jump into the well?\r\nTheir deeds were so similar--and the fragments showed that they had\r\nboth suffered from the grey brittle death. Why was everything so grey\r\nand brittle?\r\n\r\nIt was the coroner, seated near a window overlooking the yard, who\r\nfirst noticed the glow about the well. Night had fully set in, and all\r\nthe abhorrent grounds seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful\r\nmoonbeams; but this new glow was something definite and distinct, and\r\nappeared to shoot up from the black pit like a softened ray from a\r\nsearchlight, giving dull reflections in the little ground pools where\r\nthe water had been emptied. It had a very queer colour, and as all the\r\nmen clustered round the window Ammi gave a violent start. For this\r\nstrange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue. He had\r\nseen that colour before, and feared to think what it might mean. He\r\nhad seen it in the nasty brittle globule in that aerolite two summers\r\nago, had seen it in the crazy vegetation of the springtime, and had\r\nthought he had seen it for an instant that very morning against the\r\nsmall barred window of that terrible attic room where nameless things\r\nhad happened. It had flashed there a second, and a clammy and hateful\r\ncurrent of vapour had brushed past him--and then poor Nahum had been\r\ntaken by something of that colour. He had said so at the last--said it\r\nwas like the globule and the plants. After that had come the runaway\r\nin the yard and the splash in the well--and now that well was belching\r\nforth to the night a pale insidious beam of the same demoniac tint.\r\n\r\nIt does credit to the alertness of Ammi's mind that he puzzled even\r\nat that tense moment over a point which was essentially scientific.\r\nHe could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same impression from\r\na vapour glimpsed in the daytime, against a window opening in the\r\nmorning sky, and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent\r\nmist against the black and blasted landscape. It wasn't right--it was\r\nagainst Nature--and he thought of those terrible last words of his\r\nstricken friend, \"It come from some place whar things ain't as they is\r\nhere ... one o' them professors said so....\"\r\n\r\nAll three horses outside, tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by\r\nthe road, were now neighing and pawing frantically. The wagon driver\r\nstarted for the door to do something, but Ammi laid a shaky hand on his\r\nshoulder. \"Dun't go out thar,\" he whispered. \"They's more to this nor\r\nwhat we know. Nahum said somethin' lived in the well that sucks your\r\nlife out. He said it must be some'at growed from a round ball like one\r\nwe all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago June. Sucks an'\r\nburns, he said, an' is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar\r\nnow, that ye can hardly see an' can't tell what it is. Nahum thought it\r\nfeeds on everything livin' an' gits stronger all the time. He said he\r\nseen it this last week. It must be somethin' from away off in the sky\r\nlike the men from the college last year says the meteor stone was. The\r\nway it's made an' the way it works ain't like no way o' God's world.\r\nIt's some'at from beyond.\"\r\n\r\nSo the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger\r\nand the hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy. It was\r\ntruly an awful moment; with terror in that ancient and accursed house\r\nitself, four monstrous sets of fragments--two from the house and two\r\nfrom the well--in the woodshed behind, and that shaft of unknown and\r\nunholy iridescence from the slimy depths in front. Ammi had restrained\r\nthe driver on impulse, forgetting how uninjured he himself was after\r\nthe clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic room, but\r\nperhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did. No one will ever\r\nknow what was abroad that night; and though the blasphemy from beyond\r\nhad not so far hurt any human of unweakened mind, there is no telling\r\nwhat it might not have done at that last moment, and with its seemingly\r\nincreased strength and the special signs of purpose it was soon to\r\ndisplay beneath the half-clouded moonlit sky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short, sharp\r\ngasp. The others looked at him, and then quickly followed his own\r\ngaze upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly\r\narrested. There was no need for words. What had been disputed in\r\ncountry gossip was disputable no longer, and it is because of the\r\nthing which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on,\r\nthat strange days are never talked about in Arkham. It is necessary to\r\npremise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening. One did\r\narise not long afterward, but there was absolutely none then. Even\r\nthe dry tips of the lingering hedge-mustard, grey and blighted, and\r\nthe fringe on the roof of the standing democrat-wagon were unstirred.\r\nAnd yet amid that tense, godless calm the high bare boughs of all\r\nthe trees in the yard were moving. They were twitching morbidly and\r\nspasmodically, clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the\r\nmoonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked\r\nby some allied and bodiless line of linkage with sub-terrene horrors\r\nwrithing and struggling below the black roots.\r\n\r\nNot a man breathed for several seconds. Then a cloud of darker depth\r\npassed over the moon, and the silhouette of clutching branches faded\r\nout momentarily. At this there was a general cry; muffled with awe,\r\nbut husky and almost identical from every throat. For the terror had\r\nnot faded with the silhouette, and in a fearsome instant of deeper\r\ndarkness the watchers saw wriggling at the treetop height a thousand\r\ntiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each bough like\r\nthe fire of St. Elmo or the flames that come down on the apostles'\r\nheads at Pentecost. It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural\r\nlight, like a glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish\r\nsarabands over an accursed marsh; and its colour was that same nameless\r\nintrusion which Ammi had come to recognise and dread. All the while\r\nthe shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and\r\nbrighter, bringing to the minds of the huddled men, a sense of doom and\r\nabnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could\r\nform. It was no longer _shining_ out; it was _pouring_ out; and as the\r\nshapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow\r\ndirectly into the sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ... and in the fearsome instant of deeper darkness, the\r\nwatchers saw wriggling at that treetop height, a thousand tiny points\r\nof faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each bough like the fire\r\nof St. Elmo ... and all the while the shaft of phosphorescence from\r\nthe well was getting brighter and brighter and bringing to the minds\r\nof the huddled men, a sense of doom and abnormality.... It was no\r\nlonger shining out; it was pouring out; and as the shapeless stream of\r\nunplaceable colour left the well, it seemed to flow directly into the\r\nsky.]\r\n\r\nThe veterinary shivered, and walked to the front door to drop the heavy\r\nextra bar across it. Ammi shook no less, and had to tug and point for\r\nlack of a controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the\r\ngrowing luminosity of the trees. The neighing and stamping of the\r\nhorses had become utterly frightful, but not a soul of that group in\r\nthe old house would have ventured forth for any earthly reward. With\r\nthe moments the shining of the trees increased, while their restless\r\nbranches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality. The wood\r\nof the well-sweep was shining now, and presently a policeman dumbly\r\npointed to some wooden sheds and beehives near the stone wall on the\r\nwest. They were commencing to shine, too, though the tethered vehicles\r\nof the visitors seemed so far unaffected. Then there was a wild\r\ncommotion and clopping in the road, and as Ammi quenched the lamp for\r\nbetter seeing they realized that the span of frantic grays had broken\r\ntheir sapling and run off with the democrat-wagon.\r\n\r\nThe shock served to loosen several tongues, and embarrassed whispers\r\nwere exchanged. \"It spreads on everything organic that's been around\r\nhere,\" muttered the medical examiner. No one replied, but the man who\r\nhad been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred\r\nup something intangible. \"It was awful,\" he added. \"There was no bottom\r\nat all. Just ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking\r\nunder there.\" Ammi's horse still pawed and screamed deafeningly in\r\nthe road outside, and nearly drowned its owner's faint quaver as he\r\nmumbled his formless reflections. \"It come from that stone--it growed\r\ndown thar--it got everything livin'--it fed itself on 'em, mind and\r\nbody--Thad an' Merwin, Zenas an' Nabby--Nahum was the last--they all\r\ndrunk the water--it got strong on 'em--it come from beyond, whar things\r\nain't like they be here--now it's goin' home--\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger\r\nand began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which\r\neach spectator later described differently, there came from poor\r\ntethered Hero such a sound as no man before or since ever heard from\r\na horse. Every person in that low-pitched sitting-room stopped his\r\nears, and Ammi turned away from the window in horror and nausea. Words\r\ncould not convey it--when Ammi looked out again the hapless beast lay\r\nhuddled inert on the moonlit ground between the splintered shafts of\r\nthe buggy. That was the last of Hero till they buried him next day.\r\nBut the present was no time to mourn, for almost at this instant a\r\ndetective silently called attention to something terrible in the very\r\nroom with them. In the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a\r\nfaint phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment. It\r\nglowed on the broad-planked floor where the rag carpet left it bare,\r\nand shimmered over the sashes of the small-paned windows. It ran up\r\nand down the exposed corner-posts, coruscated about the shelf and\r\nmantel, and infected the very doors and furniture. Each minute saw it\r\nstrengthen, and at last it was very plain that healthy living things\r\nmust leave that house.\r\n\r\nAmmi showed them the back door and the path up through the fields to\r\nthe ten-acre pasture. They walked and stumbled as in a dream, and did\r\nnot dare look back till they were far away on the high ground. They\r\nwere glad of the path, for they could not have gone the front way, by\r\nthat well. It was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds, and\r\nthose shining orchard trees with their gnarled, fiendish contours; but\r\nthank Heaven the branches did their worst twisting high up. The moon\r\nwent under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic bridge\r\nover Chapman's Brook, and it was blind groping from there to the open\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen they looked back toward the valley and the distant Gardner place\r\nat the bottom they saw a fearsome sight. All the farm was shining\r\nwith the hideous unknown blend of colour; trees, buildings, and even\r\nsuch grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey\r\nbrittleness. The boughs were all straining skyward, tipped with tongues\r\nof foul flame, and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were\r\ncreeping about the ridgepoles of the house, barn and sheds. It was a\r\nscene from a vision of Fuseli, and over all the rest reigned that riot\r\nof luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of\r\ncryptic poison from the well--seething, feeling, lapping, reaching,\r\nscintillating, straining, and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and\r\nunrecognizable chromaticism.\r\n\r\nThen without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the\r\nsky like a rocket or meteor, leaving behind no trail and disappearing\r\nthrough a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any\r\nman could gasp or cry out. No watcher can ever forget that sight, and\r\nAmmi stared blankly at the stars of Cygnus, Deneb twinkling above the\r\nothers, where the unknown colour had melted into the Milky Way. But his\r\ngaze was the next moment called swiftly to earth by the crackling in\r\nthe valley. It was just that. Only a wooden ripping and crackling, and\r\nnot an explosion, as so many others of the party vowed. Yet the outcome\r\nwas the same, for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up\r\nfrom that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of\r\nunnatural sparks and substance; blurring the glance of the few who saw\r\nit, and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such\r\ncoloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown.\r\nThrough quickly re-closing vapours they followed the great morbidity\r\nthat had vanished, and in another second they had vanished too. Behind\r\nand below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return, and\r\nall about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black,\r\nfrore gusts from interstellar space. It shrieked and howled, and lashed\r\nthe fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy, till soon the\r\ntrembling party realized it would be no use waiting for the moon to\r\nshow what was left down there at Nahum's.\r\n\r\nToo awed even to hint theories, the seven shaking men trudged back\r\ntoward Arkham by the north road. Ammi was worse than his fellows,\r\nand begged them to see him inside his own kitchen, instead of\r\nkeeping straight on to town. He did not wish to cross the blighted,\r\nwind-whipped woods alone to his home on the main road. For he had had\r\nan added shock that the others were spared, and was crushed for ever\r\nwith a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years to come.\r\nAs the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set\r\ntheir faces toward the road, Ammi had looked back an instant at the\r\nshadowed valley of desolation so lately sheltering his ill-starred\r\nfriend. And from that stricken, far-away spot he had seen something\r\nfeebly rise, only to sink down again upon the place from which the\r\ngreat shapeless horror had shot into the sky. It was just a colour--but\r\nnot any colour of our earth or heavens. And because Ammi recognized\r\nthat colour, and knew that this last faint remnant must still lurk down\r\nthere in the well, he has never been quite right since.\r\n\r\nAmmi would never go near the place again. It is forty-four years now\r\nsince the horror happened, but he has never been there, and will be\r\nglad when the new reservoir blots it out. I shall be glad, too, for I\r\ndo not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of\r\nthat abandoned well I passed. I hope the water will always be very\r\ndeep--but even so, I shall never drink it. I do not think I shall visit\r\nthe Arkham country hereafter. Three of the men who had been with Ammi\r\nreturned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight, but there were\r\nnot any real ruins. Only the bricks of the chimney, the stones of the\r\ncellar, some mineral and metallic litter here and there, and the rim\r\nof that nefandous well. Save for Ammi's dead horse, which they towed\r\naway and buried, and the buggy which they shortly returned to him,\r\neverything that had ever been living had gone. Five eldritch acres of\r\ndusty grey desert remained, nor has anything ever grown there since.\r\nTo this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid\r\nin the woods and fields, and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in\r\nspite of the rural tales have named it \"the blasted heath.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rural tales are queer. They might be even queerer if city men\r\nand college chemists could be interested enough to analyze the water\r\nfrom that disused well, or the grey dust that no wind seems ever to\r\ndisperse. Botanists, too, ought to study the stunted flora on the\r\nborders of that spot, for they might shed light on the country notion\r\nthat the blight is spreading--little by little, perhaps an inch a year.\r\nPeople say the colour of the neighboring herbage is not quite right\r\nin the spring, and that wild things leave queer prints in the light\r\nwinter snow. Snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as\r\nit is elsewhere. Horses--the few that are left in this motor age--grow\r\nskittish in the silent valley; and hunters cannot depend on their dogs\r\ntoo near the splotch of greyish dust.\r\n\r\nThey say the mental influences are very bad, too; numbers went queer in\r\nthe years after Nahum's taking, and always they lacked the power to get\r\naway. Then the stronger-minded folk all left the region, and only the\r\nforeigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads. They could\r\nnot stay, though; and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours\r\ntheir wild, weird stories of whispered magic have given them. Their\r\ndreams at night, they protest, are very horrible in that grotesque\r\ncountry; and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir\r\na morbid fancy. No traveler has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in\r\nthose deep ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose\r\nmystery is as much of the spirits as of the eye. I myself am curious\r\nabout the sensation I derived from my one lone walk before Ammi told\r\nme his tale. When twilight came I had vaguely wished some clouds would\r\ngather, for odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept\r\ninto my soul.\r\n\r\nDo not ask me for my opinion. I do not know--that is all. There was no\r\none but Ammi to question; for Arkham people will not talk about the\r\nstrange days, and all three professors who saw the aerolite and its\r\ncoloured globule are dead. There were other globules--depend upon that.\r\nOne must have fed itself and escaped, and probably there was another\r\nwhich was too late. No doubt it is still down the well--I know there\r\nwas something wrong with the sunlight I saw above that miasmal brink.\r\nThe rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year, so perhaps there is\r\na kind of growth or nourishment even now. But whatever demon hatchling\r\nis there, it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly\r\nspread. Is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air?\r\nOne of the current Arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move\r\nas they ought not to do at night.\r\n\r\nWhat it is, only God knows. In terms of matter I suppose the thing\r\nAmmi described would be called a gas, but this gas obeyed laws that\r\nare not of our cosmos. This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as\r\nshine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories.\r\nThis was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our\r\nastronomers measure or deem too vast to measure. It was just a colour\r\nout of space--a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity\r\nbeyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns\r\nthe brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open\r\nbefore our frenzied eyes.\r\n\r\nI doubt very much if Ammi consciously lied to me, and I do not think\r\nhis tale was all a freak of madness as the townsfolk had forewarned.\r\nSomething terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor,\r\nand something terrible--though I know not in what proportion--still\r\nremains. I shall be glad to see the water come. Meanwhile I hope\r\nnothing will happen to Ammi. He saw so much of the thing--and its\r\ninfluence was so insidious. Why has he never been able to move away?\r\nHow clearly he recalled those dying words of Nahum's--\"can't git\r\naway--draws ye--ye know summ'at's comin', but 'tain't no use--\" Ammi is\r\nsuch a good old man--when the reservoir gang gets to work I must write\r\nthe chief engineer to keep a sharp watch on him. I would hate to think\r\nof him as the grey, twisted, brittle monstrosity which persists more\r\nand more in troubling my sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END",
