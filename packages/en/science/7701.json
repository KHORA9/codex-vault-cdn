He begins his career of philosopher with blind faith in\r\nCondillac and Materialism. As an intellect severely conscientious in the\r\npursuit of truth expands amidst the perplexities it revolves, phenomena\r\nwhich cannot be accounted for by Condillac’s sensuous theories open\r\nto his eye. To the first rudimentary life of man, the animal life,\r\n“characterized by impressions, appetites, movements, organic in their\r\norigin and ruled by the Law of Necessity,” (1) he is compelled to add,\r\n“the second, or human life, from which Free-will and Self-consciousness\r\nemerge.” He thus arrives at the union of mind and matter; but still a\r\nsomething is wanted,--some key to the marvels which neither of these\r\nconditions of vital being suffices to explain. And at last the grand\r\nself-completing Thinker attains to the Third Life of Man in Man’s Soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “There are not,” says this philosopher, towards the close of his last\r\n    and loftiest work,--“there are not only two principles opposed to\r\n    each other in Man,--there are three.  For there are in him three\r\n    lives and three orders of faculties.  Though all should be in accord\r\n    and in harmony between the sensitive and the active faculties\r\n    which constitute Man, there would still be a nature superior, a\r\n    third life which would not be satisfied; which would make felt\r\n    (ferait sentir) the truth that there is another happiness, another\r\n    wisdom, another perfection, at once above the greatest human\r\n    happiness, above the highest wisdom, or intellectual and moral\r\n    perfection of which the human being is susceptible.” (2)\r\n\r\nNow, as Philosophy and Romance both take their origin in the Principle\r\nof Wonder, so in the “Strange Story” submitted to the Public it will be\r\nseen that Romance, through the freest exercise of its wildest vagaries,\r\nconducts its bewildered hero towards the same goal to which Philosophy\r\nleads its luminous Student, through far grander portents of Nature, far\r\nhigher visions of Supernatural Power, than Fable can yield to Fancy.\r\nThat goal is defined in these noble words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “The relations (rapports) which exist between the elements and the\r\n    products of the three lives of Man are the subjects of meditation,\r\n    the fairest and finest, but also the most difficult.  The Stoic\r\n    Philosophy shows us all which can be most elevated in active life;\r\n    but it makes abstraction of the animal nature, and absolutely fails\r\n    to recognize all which belongs to the life of the spirit.\r\n    Its practical morality is beyond the forces of humanity.  Christianity\r\n    alone embraces the whole Man.  It dissimulates none of the sides of\r\n    his nature, and avails itself of his miseries and his weakness in\r\n    order to conduct him to his end in showing him all the want that he\r\n    has of a succor more exalted.” (3)\r\n\r\nIn the passages thus quoted, I imply one of the objects for which this\r\ntale has been written; and I cite them, with a wish to acknowledge one\r\nof those priceless obligations which writings the lightest and most\r\nfantastic often incur to reasoners the most serious and profound.\r\n\r\nBut I here construct a romance which should have, as a romance, some\r\ninterest for the general reader. I do not elaborate a treatise submitted\r\nto the logic of sages. And it is only when “in fairy fiction drest” that\r\nRomance gives admission to “truths severe.”\r\n\r\nI venture to assume that none will question my privilege to avail\r\nmyself of the marvellous agencies which have ever been at the legitimate\r\ncommand of the fabulist.\r\n\r\nTo the highest form of romantic narrative, the Epic, critics, indeed,\r\nhave declared that a supernatural machinery is indispensable. That the\r\nDrama has availed itself of the same license as the Epic, it would be\r\nunnecessary to say to the countrymen of Shakspeare, or to the generation\r\nthat is yet studying the enigmas of Goethe’s “Faust.” Prose Romance has\r\nimmemorially asserted, no less than the Epic or the Drama, its heritage\r\nin the Realm of the Marvellous. The interest which attaches to the\r\nsupernatural is sought in the earliest Prose Romance which modern times\r\ntake from the ancient, and which, perhaps, had its origin in the lost\r\nNovels of Miletus; (4) and the right to invoke such interest has, ever\r\nsince, been maintained by Romance through all varieties of form\r\nand fancy,--from the majestic epopee of “Telemaque” to the graceful\r\nfantasies of “Undine,” or the mighty mockeries of “Gulliver’s Travels”\r\n down to such comparatively commonplace elements of wonder as yet\r\npreserve from oblivion “The Castle of Otranto” and “The Old English\r\nBaron.”\r\n\r\nNow, to my mind, the true reason why a supernatural agency is\r\nindispensable to the conception of the Epic, is that the Epic is the\r\nhighest and the completest form in which Art can express either Man or\r\nNature, and that without some gleams of the supernatural, Man is not man\r\nnor Nature, nature.\r\n\r\nIt is said, by a writer to whom an eminent philosophical critic justly\r\napplies the epithets of “pious and profound:” (5)\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Is it unreasonable to confess that we believe in God, not by reason\r\n    of the Nature which conceals Him, but by reason of the Supernatural\r\n    in Man which alone reveals and proves Him to exist?...  Man reveals\r\n    God: for Man, by his intelligence, rises above Nature; and in virtue\r\n    of this intelligence is conscious of himself as a power not only\r\n    independent of, but opposed to, Nature, and capable of resisting,\r\n    conquering, and controlling her.”(6)\r\n\r\nIf the meaning involved in the argument, of which I have here made but\r\nscanty extracts, be carefully studied, I think that we shall find\r\ndeeper reasons than the critics who dictated canons of taste to the last\r\ncentury discovered,--why the supernatural is indispensable to the Epic,\r\nand why it is allowable to all works of imagination, in which Art looks\r\non Nature with Man’s inner sense of a something beyond and above her.\r\n\r\nBut the Writer who, whether in verse or prose, would avail himself of\r\nsuch sources of pity or terror as flow from the Marvellous, can only\r\nattain his object in proportion as the wonders he narrates are of a kind\r\nto excite the curiosity of the age he addresses.\r\n\r\nIn the brains of our time, the faculty of Causation is very markedly\r\ndeveloped. People nowadays do not delight in the Marvellous according to\r\nthe old childlike spirit. They say in one breath, “Very extraordinary!”\r\n and in the next breath ask, “How do you account for it?” If the Author\r\nof this work has presumed to borrow from science some elements of\r\ninterest for Romance, he ventures to hope that no thoughtful reader--and\r\ncertainly no true son of science--will be disposed to reproach him. In\r\nfact, such illustrations from the masters of Thought were essential to\r\nthe completion of the purpose which pervades the work.\r\n\r\nThat purpose, I trust, will develop itself in proportion as the story\r\napproaches the close; and whatever may appear violent or melodramatic\r\nin the catastrophe, will, perhaps, be found, by a reader capable of\r\nperceiving the various symbolical meanings conveyed in the story,\r\nessential to the end in which those meanings converge, and towards which\r\nthe incidents that give them the character and interest of of fiction,\r\nhave been planned and directed from the commencement.\r\n\r\nOf course, according to the most obvious principles of art, the narrator\r\nof a fiction must be as thoroughly in earnest as if he were the narrator\r\nof facts. One could not tell the most extravagant fairy-tale so as to\r\nrouse and sustain the attention of the most infantine listener, if the\r\ntale were told as if the taleteller did not believe in it. But when the\r\nreader lays down this “Strange Story,” perhaps he will detect, through\r\nall the haze of romance, the outlines of these images suggested to his\r\nreason: Firstly, the image of sensuous, soulless Nature, such as\r\nthe Materialist had conceived it; secondly, the image of Intellect,\r\nobstinately separating all its inquiries from the belief in the\r\nspiritual essence and destiny of man, and incurring all kinds of\r\nperplexity and resorting to all kinds of visionary speculation before it\r\nsettles at last into the simple faith which unites the philosopher and\r\nthe infant; and thirdly, the image of the erring but pure-thoughted\r\nvisionary, seeking over-much on this earth to separate soul from mind,\r\ntill innocence itself is led astray by a phantom, and reason is lost in\r\nthe space between earth and the stars. Whether in these pictures there\r\nbe any truth worth the implying, every reader must judge for himself;\r\nand if he doubt or deny that there be any such truth, still, in the\r\nprocess of thought which the doubt or denial enforces, he may chance on\r\na truth which it pleases himself to discover.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Most of the Fables of AEsop,”--thus says Montaigne in his\r\n    charming essay “Of Books”(7)--“have several senses and meanings, of\r\n    which the Mythologists choose some one that tallies with the fable.\r\n    But for the most part ‘t is only what presents itself at the first\r\n    view, and is superficial; there being others more lively, essential,\r\n    and internal, into which they had not been able to penetrate;\r\n    and”--adds Montaigne--“the case is the very same with me.”\r\n\r\n(1) OEuvres inedites de Maine de Biran, vol. i.

I had studied at Edinburgh and at Paris, and\r\nhad borne away from both those illustrious schools of medicine whatever\r\nguarantees for future distinction the praise of professors may concede\r\nto the ambition of students. On becoming a member of the College of\r\nPhysicians, I made a tour of the principal cities of Europe, taking\r\nletters of introduction to eminent medical men, and gathering from many\r\ntheories and modes of treatment hints to enlarge the foundations of\r\nunprejudiced and comprehensive practice. I had resolved to fix my\r\nultimate residence in London. But before this preparatory tour was\r\ncompleted, my resolve was changed by one of those unexpected events\r\nwhich determine the fate man in vain would work out for himself. In\r\npassing through the Tyro, on my way into the north of Italy, I found in\r\na small inn, remote from medical attendance, an English traveller seized\r\nwith acute inflammation of the lungs, and in a state of imminent danger.\r\nI devoted myself to him night and day; and, perhaps more through careful\r\nnursing than active remedies, I had the happiness to effect his complete\r\nrecovery. The traveller proved to be Julius Faber, a physician of great\r\ndistinction, contented to reside, where he was born, in the provincial\r\ncity of L----, but whose reputation as a profound and original\r\npathologist was widely spread, and whose writings had formed no\r\nunimportant part of my special studies. It was during a short holiday\r\nexcursion, from which he was about to return with renovated vigour, that\r\nhe had been thus stricken down. The patient so accidentally met with\r\nbecame the founder of my professional fortunes. He conceived a warm\r\nattachment for me,--perhaps the more affectionate because he was a\r\nchildless bachelor, and the nephew who would succeed to his wealth\r\nevinced no desire to succeed to the toils by which the wealth had been\r\nacquired. Thus, having an heir for the one, he had long looked about for\r\nan heir to the other, and now resolved on finding that heir in me.\r\nSo when we parted Dr. Faber made me promise to correspond with him\r\nregularly, and it was not long before he disclosed by letter the\r\nplans he had formed in my favour. He said that he was growing old;\r\nhis practice was beyond his strength; he needed a partner; he was not\r\ndisposed to put up to sale the health of patients whom he had learned to\r\nregard as his children: money was no object to him, but it was an object\r\nclose at his heart that the humanity he had served, and the reputation\r\nhe had acquired, should suffer no loss in his choice of a successor. In\r\nfine, he proposed that I should at once come to L---- as his partner,\r\nwith the view of succeeding to his entire practice at the end of two\r\nyears, when it was his intention to retire.\r\n\r\nThe opening into fortune thus afforded to me was one that rarely\r\npresents itself to a young man entering upon an overcrowded profession;\r\nand to an aspirant less allured by the desire of fortune than the hope\r\nof distinction, the fame of the physician who thus generously offered\r\nto me the inestimable benefits of his long experience and his cordial\r\nintroduction was in itself an assurance that a metropolitan practice is\r\nnot essential to a national renown.\r\n\r\nI went, then, to L----, and before the two years of my partnership had\r\nexpired, my success justified my kind friend’s selection, and far more\r\nthan realized my own expectations. I was fortunate in effecting\r\nsome notable cures in the earliest cases submitted to me, and it is\r\neverything in the career of a physician when good luck wins betimes for\r\nhim that confidence which patients rarely accord except to lengthened\r\nexperience. To the rapid facility with which my way was made, some\r\ncircumstances apart from professional skill probably contributed. I was\r\nsaved from the suspicion of a medical adventurer by the accidents of\r\nbirth and fortune. I belonged to an ancient family (a branch of the once\r\npowerful border-clan of the Fenwicks) that had for many generations held\r\na fair estate in the neighbourhood of Windermere. As an only son I had\r\nsucceeded to that estate on attaining my majority, and had sold it to\r\npay off the debts which had been made by my father, who had the costly\r\ntastes of an antiquary and collector. The residue on the sale insured me\r\na modest independence apart from the profits of a profession; and as I\r\nhad not been legally bound to defray my father’s debts, so I obtained\r\nthat character for disinterestedness and integrity which always in\r\nEngland tends to propitiate the public to the successes achieved by\r\nindustry or talent. Perhaps, too, any professional ability I might\r\npossess was the more readily conceded, because I had cultivated with\r\nassiduity the sciences and the scholarship which are collaterally\r\nconnected with the study of medicine. Thus, in a word, I established\r\na social position which came in aid of my professional repute, and\r\nsilenced much of that envy which usually embitters and sometimes impedes\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nDr. Faber retired at the end of the two years agreed upon. He went\r\nabroad; and being, though advanced in years, of a frame still robust,\r\nand habits of mind still inquiring and eager, he commenced a lengthened\r\ncourse of foreign travel, during which our correspondence, at first\r\nfrequent, gradually languished, and finally died away.\r\n\r\nI succeeded at once to the larger part of the practice which the labours\r\nof thirty years had secured to my predecessor. My chief rival was a\r\nDr. Lloyd, a benevolent, fervid man, not without genius, if genius be\r\npresent where judgment is absent; not without science, if that may be\r\nscience which fails in precision,--one of those clever desultory men\r\nwho, in adopting a profession, do not give up to it the whole force and\r\nheat of their minds. Men of that kind habitually accept a mechanical\r\nroutine, because in the exercise of their ostensible calling their\r\nimaginative faculties are drawn away to pursuits more alluring.\r\nTherefore, in their proper vocation they are seldom bold or\r\ninventive,--out of it they are sometimes both to excess. And when they\r\ndo take up a novelty in their own profession they cherish it with an\r\nobstinate tenacity, and an extravagant passion, unknown to those quiet\r\nphilosophers who take up novelties every day, examine them with the\r\nsobriety of practised eyes, to lay down altogether, modify in part, or\r\naccept in whole, according as inductive experiment supports or destroys\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nDr. Lloyd had been esteemed a learned naturalist long before he was\r\nadmitted to be a tolerable physician. Amidst the privations of his\r\nyouth he had contrived to form, and with each succeeding year he had\r\nperseveringly increased, a zoological collection of creatures, not\r\nalive, but, happily for the beholder, stuffed or embalmed. From what I\r\nhave said, it will be truly inferred that Dr. Lloyd’s early career as\r\na physician had not been brilliant; but of late years he had gradually\r\nrather aged than worked himself into that professional authority and\r\nstation which time confers on a thoroughly respectable man whom no one\r\nis disposed to envy, and all are disposed to like.\r\n\r\nNow in L---- there were two distinct social circles,--that of the\r\nwealthy merchants and traders, and that of a few privileged families\r\ninhabiting a part of the town aloof from the marts of commerce, and\r\ncalled the Abbey Hill. These superb Areopagites exercised over the wives\r\nand daughters of the inferior citizens to whom all of L----, except the\r\nAbbey Hill, owed its prosperity, the same kind of mysterious influence\r\nwhich the fine ladies of May Fair and Belgravia are reported to hold\r\nover the female denizens of Bloomsbury and Marylebone.\r\n\r\nAbbey Hill was not opulent; but it was powerful by a concentration\r\nof its resources in all matters of patronage. Abbey Hill had its own\r\nmilliner and its own draper, its own confectioner, butcher, baker, and\r\ntea-dealer; and the patronage of Abbey Hill was like the patronage\r\nof royalty,--less lucrative in itself than as a solemn certificate of\r\ngeneral merit. The shops on which Abbey Hill conferred its custom\r\nwere certainly not the cheapest, possibly not the best; but they were\r\nundeniably the most imposing. The proprietors were decorously pompous,\r\nthe shopmen superciliously polite. They could not be more so if they had\r\nbelonged to the State, and been paid by a public which they benefited\r\nand despised. The ladies of Low Town (as the city subjacent to the Hill\r\nhad been styled from a date remote in the feudal ages) entered those\r\nshops with a certain awe, and left them with a certain pride. There they\r\nhad learned what the Hill approved; there they had bought what the Hill\r\nhad purchased. It is much in this life to be quite sure that we are in\r\nthe right, whatever that conviction may cost us. Abbey Hill had been\r\nin the habit of appointing, amongst other objects of patronage, its own\r\nphysician. But that habit had fallen into disuse during the latter years\r\nof my predecessor’s practice. His superiority over all other medical\r\nmen in the town had become so incontestable, that, though he was\r\nemphatically the doctor of Low Town, the head of its hospitals and\r\ninfirmaries, and by birth related to its principal traders, still as\r\nAbbey Hill was occasionally subject to the physical infirmities of\r\nmeaner mortals, so on those occasions it deemed it best not to push\r\nthe point of honour to the wanton sacrifice of life. Since Low Town\r\npossessed one of the most famous physicians in England, Abbey Hill\r\nmagnanimously resolved not to crush him by a rival. Abbey Hill let him\r\nfeel its pulse.\r\n\r\nWhen my predecessor retired, I had presumptuously expected that the Hill\r\nwould have continued to suspend its normal right to a special physician,\r\nand shown to me the same generous favour it had shown to him, who had\r\ndeclared me worthy to succeed to his honours. I had the more excuse for\r\nthis presumption because the Hill had already allowed me to visit a fair\r\nproportion of its invalids, had said some very gracious things to me\r\nabout the great respectability of the Fenwick family, and sent me some\r\ninvitations to dinner, and a great many invitations to tea.\r\n\r\nBut my self-conceit received a notable check. Abbey Hill declared that\r\nthe time had come to reassert its dormant privilege; it must have a\r\ndoctor of its own choosing,--a doctor who might, indeed, be permitted\r\nto visit Low Town from motives of humanity or gain, but who must\r\nemphatically assert his special allegiance to Abbey Hill by fixing\r\nhis home on that venerable promontory. Miss Brabazon, a spinster of\r\nuncertain age but undoubted pedigree, with small fortune but high nose,\r\nwhich she would pleasantly observe was a proof of her descent from\r\nHumphrey Duke of Gloucester (with whom, indeed, I have no doubt, in\r\nspite of chronology, that she very often dined), was commissioned to\r\ninquire of me diplomatically, and without committing Abbey Hill too much\r\nby the overture, whether I would take a large and antiquated mansion, in\r\nwhich abbots were said to have lived many centuries ago, and which was\r\nstill popularly styled Abbots’ House, situated on the verge of the Hill,\r\nas in that case the “Hill” would think of me.\r\n\r\n“It is a large house for a single man, I allow,” said Miss Brabazon,\r\ncandidly; and then added, with a sidelong glance of alarming sweetness,\r\n“but when Dr. Fenwick has taken his true position (so old a family!)\r\namongst us, he need not long remain single, unless he prefer it.”\r\n\r\nI replied, with more asperity than the occasion called for, that I had\r\nno thought of changing my residence at present, and if the Hill wanted\r\nme, the Hill must send for me.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards Dr. Lloyd took Abbots’ House, and in less than a\r\nweek was proclaimed medical adviser to the Hill. The election had been\r\ndecided by the fiat of a great lady, who reigned supreme on the sacred\r\neminence, under the name and title of Mrs. Colonel Poyntz.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Fenwick,” said this lady, “is a clever young man and a gentleman,\r\nbut he gives himself airs,--the Hill does not allow any airs but its\r\nown. Besides, he is a new comer: resistance to new comers, and, indeed,\r\nto all things new, except caps and novels, is one of the bonds that keep\r\nold established societies together. Accordingly, it is by my advice that\r\nDr. Lloyd has taken Abbots’ House; the rent would be too high for his\r\nmeans if the Hill did not feel bound in honour to justify the trust he\r\nhas placed in its patronage. I told him that all my friends, when they\r\nwere in want of a doctor, would send for him; those who are my friends\r\nwill do so. What the Hill does, plenty of common people down there will\r\ndo also,--so that question is settled!” And it was settled.\r\n\r\nDr. Lloyd, thus taken by the hand, soon extended the range of his visits\r\nbeyond the Hill, which was not precisely a mountain of gold to doctors,\r\nand shared with myself, though in a comparatively small degree, the much\r\nmore lucrative practice of Low Town.\r\n\r\nI had no cause to grudge his success, nor did I. But to my theories of\r\nmedicine his diagnosis was shallow, and his prescriptions obsolete. When\r\nwe were summoned to a joint consultation, our views as to the proper\r\ncourse of treatment seldom agreed. Doubtless he thought I ought to have\r\ndeferred to his seniority in years; but I held the doctrine which youth\r\ndeems a truth and age a paradox,--namely, that in science the young men\r\nare the practical elders, inasmuch as they are schooled in the latest\r\nexperiences science has gathered up, while their seniors are cramped by\r\nthe dogmas they were schooled to believe when the world was some decades\r\nthe younger.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my reputation continued rapidly to advance; it became more\r\nthan local; my advice was sought even by patients from the metropolis.\r\nThat ambition, which, conceived in early youth, had decided my career\r\nand sweetened all its labours,--the ambition to take a rank and leave\r\na name as one of the great pathologists to whom humanity accords a\r\ngrateful, if calm, renown,--saw before it a level field and a certain\r\ngoal.\r\n\r\nI know not whether a success far beyond that usually attained at the age\r\nI had reached served to increase, but it seemed to myself to justify,\r\nthe main characteristic of my moral organization,--intellectual pride.\r\n\r\nThough mild and gentle to the sufferers under my care, as a necessary\r\nelement of professional duty, I was intolerant of contradiction from\r\nthose who belonged to my calling, or even from those who, in general\r\nopinion, opposed my favourite theories. I had espoused a school of\r\nmedical philosophy severely rigid in its inductive logic. My creed was\r\nthat of stern materialism. I had a contempt for the understanding of men\r\nwho accepted with credulity what they could not explain by reason. My\r\nfavourite phrase was “common-sense.” At the same time I had no prejudice\r\nagainst bold discovery, and discovery necessitates conjecture, but\r\nI dismissed as idle all conjecture that could not be brought to a\r\npractical test.\r\n\r\nAs in medicine I had been the pupil of Broussais, so in metaphysics I\r\nwas the disciple of Condillac. I believed with that philosopher that\r\n“all our knowledge we owe to Nature; that in the beginning we can\r\nonly instruct ourselves through her lessons; and that the whole art of\r\nreasoning consists in continuing as she has compelled us to commence.”\r\n Keeping natural philosophy apart from the doctrines of revelation, I\r\nnever assailed the last; but I contended that by the first no accurate\r\nreasoner could arrive at the existence of the soul as a third principle\r\nof being equally distinct from mind and body. That by a miracle man\r\nmight live again, was a question of faith and not of understanding. I\r\nleft faith to religion, and banished it from philosophy. How define with\r\na precision to satisfy the logic of philosophy what was to live again?\r\nThe body? We know that the body rests in its grave till by the process\r\nof decomposition its elemental parts enter into other forms of\r\nmatter. The mind? But the mind was as clearly the result of the bodily\r\norganization as the music of the harpsichord is the result of the\r\ninstrumental mechanism. The mind shared the decrepitude of the body in\r\nextreme old age, and in the full vigour of youth a sudden injury to the\r\nbrain might forever destroy the intellect of a Plato or a Shakspeare.\r\nBut the third principle,--the soul,--the something lodged within the\r\nbody, which yet was to survive it? Where was that soul hidden out of\r\nthe ken of the anatomist? When philosophers attempted to define it, were\r\nthey not compelled to confound its nature and its actions with those\r\nof the mind? Could they reduce it to the mere moral sense, varying\r\naccording to education, circumstances, and physical constitution? But\r\neven the moral sense in the most virtuous of men may be swept away by\r\na fever. Such at the time I now speak of were the views I held,--views\r\ncertainly not original nor pleasing; but I cherished them with as fond a\r\ntenacity as if they had been consolatory truths of which I was the\r\nfirst discoverer. I was intolerant to those who maintained opposite\r\ndoctrines,--despised them as irrational, or disliked them as\r\ninsincere. Certainly if I had fulfilled the career which my ambition\r\npredicted,--become the founder of a new school in pathology, and summed\r\nup my theories in academical lectures,--I should have added another\r\nauthority, however feeble, to the sects which circumscribe the interest\r\nof man to the life that has its close in his grave.\r\n\r\nPossibly that which I have called my intellectual pride was more\r\nnourished than I should have been willing to grant by the self-reliance\r\nwhich an unusual degree of physical power is apt to bestow. Nature had\r\nblessed me with the thews of an athlete. Among the hardy youths of\r\nthe Northern Athens I had been preeminently distinguished for feats\r\nof activity and strength. My mental labours, and the anxiety which\r\nis inseparable from the conscientious responsibilities of the medical\r\nprofession, kept my health below the par of keen enjoyment, but had in\r\nno way diminished my rare muscular force. I walked through the crowd\r\nwith the firm step and lofty crest of the mailed knight of old, who\r\nfelt himself, in his casement of iron, a match against numbers. Thus the\r\nsense of a robust individuality, strong alike in disciplined reason\r\nand animal vigour, habituated to aid others, needing no aid for itself,\r\ncontributed to render me imperious in will and arrogant in opinion. Nor\r\nwere such defects injurious to me in my profession; on the contrary,\r\naided as they were by a calm manner, and a presence not without that\r\nkind of dignity which is the livery of self-esteem, they served to\r\nimpose respect and to inspire trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nI had been about six years at L---- when I became suddenly involved in\r\na controversy with Dr. Lloyd. Just as this ill-fated man appeared at the\r\nculminating point of his professional fortunes, he had the imprudence\r\nto proclaim himself not only an enthusiastic advocate of mesmerism as a\r\ncurative process, but an ardent believer of the reality of somnambular\r\nclairvoyance as an invaluable gift of certain privileged organizations.\r\nTo these doctrines I sternly opposed myself,--the more sternly, perhaps,\r\nbecause on these doctrines Dr. Lloyd founded an argument for the\r\nexistence of soul, independent of mind, as of matter, and built\r\nthereon a superstructure of physiological fantasies, which, could it\r\nbe substantiated, would replace every system of metaphysics on which\r\nrecognized philosophy condescends to dispute.\r\n\r\nAbout two years before he became a disciple rather of Puysegur than\r\nMesmer (for Mesmer hard little faith in that gift of clairvoyance of\r\nwhich Puysegur was, I believe, at least in modern times, the first\r\naudacious asserter), Dr. Lloyd had been afflicted with the loss of a\r\nwife many years younger than himself, and to whom he had been tenderly\r\nattached. And this bereavement, in directing the hopes that consoled\r\nhim to a world beyond the grave, had served perhaps to render him more\r\ncredulous of the phenomena in which he greeted additional proofs of\r\npurely spiritual existence. Certainly, if, in controverting the notions\r\nof another physiologist, I had restricted myself to that fair antagonism\r\nwhich belongs to scientific disputants anxious only for the truth, I\r\nshould need no apology for sincere conviction and honest argument; but\r\nwhen, with condescending good-nature, as if to a man much younger than\r\nhimself, who was ignorant of the phenomena which he nevertheless denied,\r\nDr. Lloyd invited me to attend his seances and witness his cures, my\r\namour propre became aroused and nettled, and it seemed to me necessary\r\nto put down what I asserted to be too gross an outrage on common-sense\r\nto justify the ceremony of examination. I wrote, therefore, a small\r\npamphlet on the subject, in which I exhausted all the weapons that irony\r\ncan lend to contempt. Dr. Lloyd replied; and as he was no very skilful\r\narguer, his reply injured him perhaps more than my assault. Meanwhile,\r\nI had made some inquiries as to the moral character of his favourite\r\nclairvoyants. I imagined that I had learned enough to justify me in\r\ntreating them as flagrant cheats, and himself as their egregious dupe.\r\n\r\nLow Town soon ranged itself, with very few exceptions, on my side. The\r\nHill at first seemed disposed to rally round its insulted physician, and\r\nto make the dispute a party question, in which the Hill would have been\r\nsignally worsted, when suddenly the same lady paramount, who had secured\r\nto Dr. Lloyd the smile of the Eminence, spoke forth against him, and the\r\nEminence frowned.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Lloyd,” said the Queen of the Hill, “is an amiable creature, but on\r\nthis subject decidedly cracked. Cracked poets may be all the better for\r\nbeing cracked,--cracked doctors are dangerous. Besides, in deserting\r\nthat old-fashioned routine, his adherence to which made his claim to\r\nthe Hill’s approbation, and unsettling the mind of the Hill with wild\r\nrevolutionary theories, Dr. Lloyd has betrayed the principles on which\r\nthe Hill itself rests its social foundations. Of those principles Dr.\r\nFenwick has made himself champion; and the Hill is bound to support him.\r\nThere, the question is settled!”\r\n\r\nAnd it was settled.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment Mrs. Colonel Poyntz thus issued the word of command,\r\nDr. Lloyd was demolished. His practice was gone, as well as his repute.\r\nMortification or anger brought on a stroke of paralysis which, disabling\r\nmy opponent, put an end to our controversy. An obscure Dr. Jones, who\r\nhad been the special pupil and protege of Dr. Lloyd, offered himself as\r\na candidate for the Hill’s tongues and pulses. The Hill gave him little\r\nencouragement. It once more suspended its electoral privileges, and,\r\nwithout insisting on calling me up to it, the Hill quietly called me\r\nin whenever its health needed other advice than that of its visiting\r\napothecary. Again it invited me, sometimes to dinner, often to tea; and\r\nagain Miss Brabazon assured me by a sidelong glance that it was no fault\r\nof hers if I were still single.\r\n\r\nI had almost forgotten the dispute which had obtained for me so\r\nconspicuous a triumph, when one winter’s night I was roused from sleep\r\nby a summons to attend Dr Lloyd, who, attacked by a second stroke a few\r\nhours previously, had, on recovering sense, expressed a vehement desire\r\nto consult the rival by whom he had suffered so severely. I dressed\r\nmyself in haste and hurried to his house.\r\n\r\nA February night, sharp and bitter; an iron-gray frost below, a spectral\r\nmelancholy moon above. I had to ascend the Abbey Hill by a steep, blind\r\nlane between high walls. I passed through stately gates, which stood\r\nwide open, into the garden ground that surrounded the old Abbots’\r\nHouse. At the end of a short carriage-drive the dark and gloomy building\r\ncleared itself from leafless skeleton trees,--the moon resting keen and\r\ncold on its abrupt gables and lofty chimney-stacks. An old woman-servant\r\nreceived me at the door, and, without saying a word, led me through a\r\nlong low hall, and up dreary oak stairs, to a broad landing, at which\r\nshe paused for a moment, listening. Round and about hall, staircase, and\r\nlanding were ranged the dead specimens of the savage world which it had\r\nbeen the pride of the naturalist’s life to collect. Close where I stood\r\nyawned the open jaws of the fell anaconda, its lower coils hidden, as\r\nthey rested on the floor below, by the winding of the massive stairs.\r\nAgainst the dull wainscot walls were pendent cases stored with grotesque\r\nunfamiliar mummies, seen imperfectly by the moon that shot through the\r\nwindow-panes, and the candle in the old woman’s hand. And as now she\r\nturned towards me, nodding her signal to follow, and went on up the\r\nshadowy passage, rows of gigantic birds--ibis and vulture, and huge sea\r\nglaucus--glared at me in the false light of their hungry eyes.\r\n\r\nSo I entered the sick-room, and the first glance told me that my art was\r\npowerless there.\r\n\r\nThe children of the stricken widower were grouped round his bed, the\r\neldest apparently about fifteen, the youngest four; one little girl--the\r\nonly female child--was clinging to her father’s neck, her face pressed\r\nto his bosom, and in that room her sobs alone were loud.\r\n\r\nAs I passed the threshold, Dr. Lloyd lifted his face, which had been\r\nbent over the weeping child, and gazed on me with an aspect of strange\r\nglee, which I failed to interpret. Then as I stole towards him softly\r\nand slowly, he pressed his lips on the long fair tresses that streamed\r\nwild over his breast, motioned to a nurse who stood beside his pillow to\r\ntake the child away, and in a voice clearer than I could have expected\r\nin one on whose brow lay the unmistakable hand of death, he bade\r\nthe nurse and the children quit the room. All went sorrowfully, but\r\nsilently, save the little girl, who, borne off in the nurse’s arms,\r\ncontinued to sob as if her heart were breaking.\r\n\r\nI was not prepared for a scene so affecting; it moved me to the quick.\r\nMy eyes wistfully followed the children so soon to be orphans, as one\r\nafter one went out into the dark chill shadow, and amidst the bloodless\r\nforms of the dumb brute nature, ranged in grisly vista beyond the\r\ndeath-room of man. And when the last infant shape had vanished, and the\r\ndoor closed with a jarring click, my sight wandered loiteringly around\r\nthe chamber before I could bring myself to fix it on the broken form,\r\nbeside which I now stood in all that glorious vigour of frame which had\r\nfostered the pride of my mind. In the moment consumed by my mournful\r\nsurvey, the whole aspect of the place impressed itself ineffaceably\r\non lifelong remembrance. Through the high, deepsunken casement, across\r\nwhich the thin, faded curtain was but half drawn, the moonlight rushed,\r\nand then settled on the floor in one shroud of white glimmer, lost under\r\nthe gloom of the death-bed. The roof was low, and seemed lower still\r\nby heavy intersecting beams, which I might have touched with my lifted\r\nhand. And the tall guttering candle by the bedside, and the flicker from\r\nthe fire struggling out through the fuel but newly heaped on it, threw\r\ntheir reflection on the ceiling just over my head in a reek of quivering\r\nblackness, like an angry cloud.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I felt my arm grasped; with his left hand (the right side was\r\nalready lifeless) the dying man drew me towards him nearer and nearer,\r\ntill his lips almost touched my ear, and, in a voice now firm, now\r\nsplitting into gasp and hiss, thus he said, “I have summoned you to gaze\r\non your own work! You have stricken down my life at the moment when it\r\nwas most needed by my children, and most serviceable to mankind. Had\r\nI lived a few years longer, my children would have entered on manhood,\r\nsafe from the temptations of want and undejected by the charity\r\nof strangers. Thanks to you, they will be penniless orphans.\r\nFellow-creatures afflicted by maladies your pharmacopoeia had failed\r\nto reach came to me for relief, and they found it. ‘The effect of\r\nimagination,’ you say. What matters, if I directed the imagination to\r\ncure? Now you have mocked the unhappy ones out of their last chance of\r\nlife. They will suffer and perish. Did you believe me in error? Still\r\nyou knew that my object was research into truth. You employed against\r\nyour brother in art venomous drugs and a poisoned probe. Look at me! Are\r\nyou satisfied with your work?”\r\n\r\nI sought to draw back and pluck my arm from the dying man’s grasp. I\r\ncould not do so without using a force that would have been inhuman. His\r\nlips drew nearer still to my ear.\r\n\r\n“Vain pretender, do not boast that you brought a genius for epigram to\r\nthe service of science. Science is lenient to all who offer experiment\r\nas the test of conjecture. You are of the stuff of which inquisitors are\r\nmade. You cry that truth is profaned when your dogmas are questioned.\r\nIn your shallow presumption you have meted the dominions of nature, and\r\nwhere your eye halts its vision, you say, ‘There nature must close;’\r\nin the bigotry which adds crime to presumption, you would stone the\r\ndiscoverer who, in annexing new realms to her chart, unsettles your\r\narbitrary landmarks. Verily, retribution shall await you! In those\r\nspaces which your sight has disdained to explore you shall yourself be\r\na lost and bewildered straggler. Hist! I see them already! The gibbering\r\nphantoms are gathering round you!”\r\n\r\nThe man’s voice stopped abruptly; his eye fixed in a glazing stare;\r\nhis hand relaxed its hold; he fell back on his pillow. I stole from the\r\nroom; on the landing-place I met the nurse and the old woman-servant.\r\nHappily the children were not there. But I heard the wail of the female\r\nchild from some room not far distant.\r\n\r\nI whispered hurriedly to the nurse, “All is over!” passed again under\r\nthe jaws of the vast anaconda, and on through the blind lane between the\r\ndead walls, on through the ghastly streets, under the ghastly moon, went\r\nback to my solitary home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before I could shake off the impression made on me by\r\nthe words and the look of that dying man.\r\n\r\nIt was not that my conscience upbraided me. What had I done? Denounced\r\nthat which I held, in common with most men of sense in or out of my\r\nprofession, to be one of those illusions by which quackery draws profit\r\nfrom the wonder of ignorance. Was I to blame if I refused to treat\r\nwith the grave respect due to asserted discovery in legitimate science\r\npretensions to powers akin to the fables of wizards? Was I to descend\r\nfrom the Academe of decorous science to examine whether a slumbering\r\nsibyl could read from a book placed at her back, or tell me at L----\r\nwhat at that moment was being done by my friend at the Antipodes?\r\n\r\nAnd what though Dr. Lloyd himself might be a worthy and honest man, and\r\na sincere believer in the extravagances for which he demanded an equal\r\ncredulity in others, do not honest men every day incur the penalty\r\nof ridicule if, from a defect of good sense, they make themselves\r\nridiculous? Could I have foreseen that a satire so justly provoked\r\nwould inflict so deadly a wound? Was I inhumanly barbarous because the\r\nantagonist destroyed was morbidly sensitive? My conscience, therefore,\r\nmade me no reproach, and the public was as little severe as my\r\nconscience. The public had been with me in our contest; the public knew\r\nnothing of my opponent’s deathbed accusations; the public knew only that\r\nI had attended him in his last moments; it saw me walk beside the bier\r\nthat bore him to his grave; it admired the respect to his memory which\r\nI evinced in the simple tomb that I placed over his remains, inscribed\r\nwith an epitaph that did justice to his unquestionable benevolence and\r\nintegrity; above all, it praised the energy with which I set on foot a\r\nsubscription for his orphan children, and the generosity with which I\r\nheaded that subscription by a sum that was large in proportion to my\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nTo that sum I did not, indeed, limit my contribution. The sobs of the\r\npoor female child rang still on my heart. As her grief had been keener\r\nthan that of her brothers, so she might be subjected to sharper trials\r\nthan they, when the time came for her to fight her own way through the\r\nworld; therefore I secured to her, but with such precautions that the\r\ngift could not be traced to my hand, a sum to accumulate till she was\r\nof marriageable age, and which then might suffice for a small wedding\r\nportion; or if she remained single, for an income that would place\r\nher beyond the temptation of want, or the bitterness of a servile\r\ndependence.\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Lloyd should have died in poverty was a matter of surprise at\r\nfirst, for his profits during the last few years had been considerable,\r\nand his mode of life far from extravagant. But just before the date of\r\nour controversy he had been induced to assist the brother of his lost\r\nwife, who was a junior partner in a London bank, with the loan of his\r\naccumulated savings. This man proved dishonest; he embezzled that and\r\nother sums intrusted to him, and fled the country. The same sentiment of\r\nconjugal affection which had cost Dr. Lloyd his fortune kept him silent\r\nas to the cause of the loss. It was reserved for his executors to\r\ndiscover the treachery of the brother-in-law whom he, poor man, would\r\nhave generously screened from additional disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of L----, a wealthy and public-spirited merchant, purchased\r\nthe museum, which Dr. Lloyd’s passion for natural history had induced\r\nhim to form; and the sum thus obtained, together with that raised\r\nby subscription, sufficed not only to discharge all debts due by the\r\ndeceased, but to insure to the orphans the benefits of an education that\r\nmight fit at least the boys to enter fairly armed into that game, more\r\nof skill than of chance, in which Fortune is really so little blinded\r\nthat we see, in each turn of her wheel, wealth and its honours pass away\r\nfrom the lax fingers of ignorance and sloth, to the resolute grasp of\r\nlabour and knowledge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a relation in a distant county undertook the charge of the\r\norphans; they disappeared from the scene, and the tides of life in a\r\ncommercial community soon flowed over the place which the dead man had\r\noccupied in the thoughts of his bustling townsfolk.\r\n\r\nOne person at L----, and only one, appeared to share and inherit the\r\nrancour with which the poor physician had denounced me on his death-bed.\r\nIt was a gentleman named Vigors, distantly related to the deceased,\r\nand who had been, in point of station, the most eminent of Dr. Lloyd’s\r\npartisans in the controversy with myself, a man of no great scholastic\r\nacquirements, but of respectable abilities. He had that kind of power\r\nwhich the world concedes to respectable abilities when accompanied\r\nwith a temper more than usually stern, and a moral character more than\r\nusually austere. His ruling passion was to sit in judgment upon others;\r\nand being a magistrate, he was the most active and the most rigid of all\r\nthe magistrates L---- had ever known.\r\n\r\nMr. Vigors at first spoke of me with great bitterness, as having ruined,\r\nand in fact killed, his friend, by the uncharitable and unfair acerbity\r\nwhich he declared I had brought into what ought to have been an\r\nunprejudiced examination of simple matter of fact. But finding no\r\nsympathy in these charges, he had the discretion to cease from making\r\nthem, contenting himself with a solemn shake of his head if he heard my\r\nname mentioned in terms of praise, and an oracular sentence or two,\r\nsuch as “Time will show,” “All’s well that ends well,” etc. Mr. Vigors,\r\nhowever, mixed very little in the more convivial intercourse of\r\nthe townspeople. He called himself domestic; but, in truth, he was\r\nungenial,--a stiff man, starched with self-esteem. He thought that his\r\ndignity of station was not sufficiently acknowledged by the merchants of\r\nLow Town, and his superiority of intellect not sufficiently recognized\r\nby the exclusives of the Hill. His visits were, therefore, chiefly\r\nconfined to the houses of neighbouring squires, to whom his reputation\r\nas a magistrate, conjoined with his solemn exterior, made him one of\r\nthose oracles by which men consent to be awed on condition that the awe\r\nis not often inflicted. And though he opened his house three times\r\na week, it was only to a select few, whom he first fed and then\r\nbiologized. Electro-biology was very naturally the special entertainment\r\nof a man whom no intercourse ever pleased in which his will was not\r\nimposed upon others. Therefore he only invited to his table persons whom\r\nhe could stare into the abnegation of their senses, willing to say that\r\nbeef was lamb, or brandy was coffee, according as he willed them to say.\r\nAnd, no doubt, the persons asked would have said anything he willed,\r\nso long as they had, in substance, as well as in idea, the beef and the\r\nbrandy, the lamb and the coffee. I did not, then, often meet Mr. Vigors\r\nat the houses in which I occasionally spent my evenings. I heard of his\r\nenmity as a man safe in his home hears the sough of a wind on a common\r\nwithout. If now and then we chanced to pass in the streets, he looked\r\nup at me (he was a small man walking on tiptoe) with a sullen scowl of\r\ndislike; and from the height of my stature, I dropped upon the small man\r\nand sullen scowl the affable smile of supreme indifference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nI had now arrived at that age when an ambitious man, satisfied with\r\nhis progress in the world without, begins to feel in the cravings of\r\nunsatisfied affection the void of a solitary hearth. I resolved to\r\nmarry, and looked out for a wife. I had never hitherto admitted into my\r\nlife the passion of love. In fact, I had regarded that passion, even\r\nin my earlier youth, with a certain superb contempt,--as a malady\r\nengendered by an effeminate idleness, and fostered by a sickly\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nI wished to find in a wife a rational companion, an affectionate and\r\ntrustworthy friend. No views of matrimony could be less romantic, more\r\nsoberly sensible, than those which I conceived. Nor were my requirements\r\nmercenary or presumptuous. I cared not for fortune; I asked nothing\r\nfrom connections. My ambition was exclusively professional; it could be\r\nserved by no titled kindred, accelerated by no wealthy dower. I was\r\nno slave to beauty. I did not seek in a wife the accomplishments of a\r\nfinishing-school teacher.\r\n\r\nHaving decided that the time had come to select my helpmate, I imagined\r\nthat I should find no difficulty in a choice that my reason would\r\napprove. But day upon day, week upon week, passed away, and though among\r\nthe families I visited there were many young ladies who possessed more\r\nthan the qualifications with which I conceived that I should be amply\r\ncontented, and by whom I might flatter myself that my proposals would\r\nnot be disdained, I saw not one to whose lifelong companionship I should\r\nnot infinitely have preferred the solitude I found so irksome.\r\n\r\nOne evening, in returning home from visiting a poor female patient whom\r\nI attended gratuitously, and whose case demanded more thought than that\r\nof any other in my list,--for though it had been considered hopeless in\r\nthe hospital, and she had come home to die, I felt certain that I could\r\nsave her, and she seemed recovering under my care,--one evening--it was\r\nthe fifteenth of May--I found myself just before the gates of the house\r\nthat had been inhabited by Dr. Lloyd. Since his death the house had been\r\nunoccupied; the rent asked for it by the proprietor was considered high;\r\nand from the sacred Hill on which it was situated, shyness or pride\r\nbanished the wealthier traders. The garden gates stood wide open, as\r\nthey had stood on the winter night on which I had passed through them\r\nto the chamber of death. The remembrance of that deathbed came vividly\r\nbefore me, and the dying man’s fantastic threat rang again in my\r\nstartled ears. An irresistible impulse, which I could not then account\r\nfor, and which I cannot account for now,--an impulse the reverse of that\r\nwhich usually makes us turn away with quickened step from a spot that\r\nrecalls associations of pain,--urged me on through the open gates up the\r\nneglected grass-grown road, urged me to look, under the weltering sun of\r\nthe joyous spring, at that house which I had never seen but in the gloom\r\nof a winter night, under the melancholy moon. As the building came in\r\nsight, with dark-red bricks, partially overgrown with ivy, I perceived\r\nthat it was no longer unoccupied. I saw forms passing athwart the open\r\nwindows; a van laden with articles of furniture stood before the door;\r\na servant in livery was beside it giving directions to the men who were\r\nunloading. Evidently some family was just entering into possession.\r\nI felt somewhat ashamed of my trespass, and turned round quickly to\r\nretrace my steps. I had retreated but a few yards, when I saw before me,\r\nat the entrance gates, Mr. Vigors, walking beside a lady apparently of\r\nmiddle age; while, just at hand, a path cut through the shrubs gave view\r\nof a small wicketgate at the end of the grounds. I felt unwilling not\r\nonly to meet the lady, whom I guessed to be the new occupier, and to\r\nwhom I should have to make a somewhat awkward apology for intrusion, but\r\nstill more to encounter the scornful look of Mr. Vigors in what appeared\r\nto my pride a false or undignified position. Involuntarily, therefore, I\r\nturned down the path which would favour my escape unobserved. When about\r\nhalf way between the house and the wicket-gate, the shrubs that had\r\nclothed the path on either side suddenly opened to the left, bringing\r\ninto view a circle of sward, surrounded by irregular fragments of old\r\nbrickwork partially covered with ferns, creepers, or rockplants, weeds,\r\nor wild flowers; and, in the centre of the circle, a fountain, or rather\r\nwell, over which was built a Gothic monastic dome, or canopy, resting\r\non small Norman columns, time-worn, dilapidated. A large willow overhung\r\nthis unmistakable relic of the ancient abbey. There was an air of\r\nantiquity, romance, legend about this spot, so abruptly disclosed amidst\r\nthe delicate green of the young shrubberies. But it was not the ruined\r\nwall nor the Gothic well that chained my footstep and charmed my eye.\r\n\r\nIt was a solitary human form, seated amidst the mournful ruins.\r\n\r\nThe form was so slight, the face so young, that at the first glance I\r\nmurmured to myself, “What a lovely child!” But as my eye lingered\r\nit recognized in the upturned thoughtful brow, in the sweet, serious\r\naspect, in the rounded outlines of that slender shape, the inexpressible\r\ndignity of virgin woman.\r\n\r\nA book was on her lap, at her feet a little basket, half-filled with\r\nviolets and blossoms culled from the rock-plants that nestled amidst the\r\nruins. Behind her, the willow, like an emerald waterfall, showered down\r\nits arching abundant green, bough after bough, from the tree-top to the\r\nsward, descending in wavy verdure, bright towards the summit, in the\r\nsmile of the setting sun, and darkening into shadow as it neared the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nShe did not notice, she did not see me; her eyes were fixed upon the\r\nhorizon, where it sloped farthest into space, above the treetops and\r\nthe ruins,--fixed so intently that mechanically I turned my own gaze to\r\nfollow the flight of hers. It was as if she watched for some expected,\r\nfamiliar sign to grow out from the depths of heaven; perhaps to greet,\r\nbefore other eyes beheld it, the ray of the earliest star.\r\n\r\nThe birds dropped from the boughs on the turf around her so fearlessly\r\nthat one alighted amidst the flowers in the little basket at her feet.\r\nThere is a famous German poem, which I had read in my youth, called the\r\nMaiden from Abroad, variously supposed to be an allegory of Spring, or\r\nof Poetry, according to the choice of commentators: it seemed to me\r\nas if the poem had been made for her. Verily, indeed, in her, poet\r\nor painter might have seen an image equally true to either of those\r\nadornments of the earth; both outwardly a delight to sense, yet both\r\nwakening up thoughts within us, not sad, but akin to sadness.\r\n\r\nI heard now a step behind me, and a voice which I recognized to be that\r\nof Mr. Vigors. I broke from the charm by which I had been so lingeringly\r\nspell-bound, hurried on confusedly, gained the wicket-gate, from which a\r\nshort flight of stairs descended into the common thoroughfare. And there\r\nthe every-day life lay again before me. On the opposite side, houses,\r\nshops, church-spires; a few steps more, and the bustling streets! How\r\nimmeasurably far from, yet how familiarly near to, the world in which we\r\nmove and have being is that fairy-land of romance which opens out from\r\nthe hard earth before us, when Love steals at first to our side, fading\r\nback into the hard earth again as Love smiles or sighs its farewell!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAnd before that evening I had looked on Mr. Vigors with supreme\r\nindifference! What importance he now assumed in my eyes! The lady with\r\nwhom I had seen him was doubtless the new tenant of that house in which\r\nthe young creature by whom my heart was so strangely moved evidently had\r\nher home. Most probably the relation between the two ladies was that\r\nof mother and daughter. Mr. Vigors, the friend of one, might himself be\r\nrelated to both, might prejudice them against me, might--Here, starting\r\nup, I snapped the thread of conjecture, for right before my eyes, on the\r\ntable beside which I had seated myself on entering my room, lay a card\r\nof invitation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n            MRS. POYNTZ.\r\n              At Home,\r\n         Wednesday, May 15th.\r\n      Early.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz,--Mrs. Colonel Poyntz, the Queen of the Hill? There, at her\r\nhouse, I could not fail to learn all about the new comers, who could\r\nnever without her sanction have settled on her domain.\r\n\r\nI hastily changed my dress, and, with beating heart, wound my way up the\r\nvenerable eminence.\r\n\r\nI did not pass through the lane which led direct to Abbots’ House (for\r\nthat old building stood solitary amidst its grounds a little apart\r\nfrom the spacious platform on which the society of the Hill was\r\nconcentrated), but up the broad causeway, with vistaed gaslamps; the\r\ngayer shops still-unclosed, the tide of busy life only slowly ebbing\r\nfrom the still-animated street, on to a square, in which the four main\r\nthoroughfares of the city converged, and which formed the boundary of\r\nLow Town. A huge dark archway, popularly called Monk’s Gate, at the\r\nangle of this square, made the entrance to Abbey Hill. When the arch was\r\npassed, one felt at once that one was in the town of a former day. The\r\npavement was narrow and rugged; the shops small, their upper stories\r\nprojecting, with here and there plastered fronts, quaintly arabesque.\r\nAn ascent, short, but steep and tortuous, conducted at once to the old\r\nAbbey Church, nobly situated in a vast quadrangle, round which were\r\nthe genteel and gloomy dwellings of the Areopagites of the Hill. More\r\ngenteel and less gloomy than the rest--lights at the windows and flowers\r\non the balcony--stood forth, flanked by a garden wall at either side,\r\nthe mansion of Mrs. Colonel Poyntz.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the drawing-room, I heard the voice of the hostess; it\r\nwas a voice clear, decided, metallic, bell-like, uttering these words:\r\n“Taken Abbots’ House? I will tell you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz was seated on the sofa; at her right sat fat Mrs. Bruce, who\r\nwas a Scotch lord’s grand-daughter; at her left thin Miss Brabazon,\r\nwho was an Irish baronet’s niece. Around her--a few seated, many\r\nstanding--had grouped all the guests, save two old gentlemen, who had\r\nremained aloof with Colonel Poyntz near the whist-table, waiting for the\r\nfourth old gentleman who was to make up the rubber, but who was at that\r\nmoment spell-bound in the magic circle which curiosity, that strongest\r\nof social demons, had attracted round the hostess.\r\n\r\n“Taken Abbots’ House? I will tell you.--Ah, Dr. Fenwick, charmed to see\r\nyou. You know Abbots’ House is let at last? Well, Miss Brabazon, dear,\r\nyou ask who has taken it. I will inform you,--a particular friend of\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! Dear me!” said Miss Brabazon, looking confused. “I hope I did\r\nnot say anything to--”\r\n\r\n“Wound my feelings. Not in the least. You said your uncle Sir Phelim\r\nemployed a coachmaker named Ashleigh, that Ashleigh was an uncommon\r\nname, though Ashley was a common one; you intimated an appalling\r\nsuspicion that the Mrs. Ashleigh who had come to the Hill was the coach\r\nmaker’s widow. I relieve your mind,--she is not; she is the widow of\r\nGilbert Ashleigh, of Kirby Hall.”\r\n\r\n“Gilbert Ashleigh,” said one of the guests, a bachelor, whose parents\r\nhad reared him for the Church, but who, like poor Goldsmith, did not\r\nthink himself good enough for it, a mistake of over-modesty, for he\r\nmatured into a very harmless creature. “Gilbert Ashleigh? I was at\r\nOxford with him,--a gentleman commoner of Christ Church. Good-looking\r\nman, very; sapped--”\r\n\r\n“Sapped! what’s that?--Oh, studied. That he did all his life. He married\r\nyoung,--Anne Chaloner; she and I were girls together; married the same\r\nyear. They settled at Kirby Hall--nice place, but dull. Poyntz and I\r\nspent a Christmas there. Ashleigh when he talked was charming, but he\r\ntalked very little. Anne, when she talked, was commonplace, and she\r\ntalked very much. Naturally, poor thing,---she was so happy. Poyntz and\r\nI did not spend another Christmas there. Friendship is long, but life is\r\nshort. Gilbert Ashleigh’s life was short indeed; he died in the seventh\r\nyear of his marriage, leaving only one child, a girl. Since then, though\r\nI never spent another Christmas at Kirby Hall, I have frequently spent a\r\nday there, doing my best to cheer up Anne. She was no longer talkative,\r\npoor dear. Wrapped up in her child, who has now grown into a beautiful\r\ngirl of eighteen--such eyes, her father’s--the real dark blue--rare;\r\nsweet creature, but delicate; not, I hope, consumptive, but delicate;\r\nquiet, wants life. My girl Jane adores her. Jane has life enough for\r\ntwo.”\r\n\r\n“Is Miss Ashleigh the heiress to Kirby Hall?” asked Mrs. Bruce, who had\r\nan unmarried son.\r\n\r\n“No. Kirby Hall passed to Ashleigh Sumner, the male heir, a cousin.\r\nAnd the luckiest of cousins! Gilbert’s sister, showy woman (indeed all\r\nshow), had contrived to marry her kinsman, Sir Walter Ashleigh Haughton,\r\nthe head of the Ashleigh family,--just the man made to be the reflector\r\nof a showy woman! He died years ago, leaving an only son, Sir James,\r\nwho was killed last winter, by a fall from his horse. And here, again,\r\nAshleigh Summer proved to be the male heir-at-law. During the minority\r\nof this fortunate youth, Mrs. Ashleigh had rented Kirby Hall of his\r\nguardian. He is now just coming of age, and that is why she leaves.\r\nLilian Ashleigh will have, however, a very good fortune,--is what we\r\ngenteel paupers call an heiress. Is there anything more you want to\r\nknow?”\r\n\r\nSaid thin Miss Brabazon, who took advantage of her thinness to wedge\r\nherself into every one’s affairs, “A most interesting account. What\r\na nice place Abbots’ House could be made with a little taste! So\r\naristocratic! Just what I should like if I could afford it!\r\nThe drawing-room should be done up in the Moorish style, with\r\ngeranium-coloured silk curtains, like dear Lady L----‘s boudoir at\r\nTwickenham. And Mrs. Ashleigh has taken the house on lease too, I\r\nsuppose!” Here Miss Brabazon fluttered her fan angrily, and then\r\nexclaimed, “But what on earth brings Mrs. Ashleigh here?”\r\n\r\nAnswered Mrs. Colonel Poyntz, with the military frankness by which she\r\nkept her company in good humour, as well as awe,--\r\n\r\n“Why do any of us come here? Can any one tell me?”\r\n\r\nThere was a blank silence, which the hostess herself was the first to\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\n“None of us present can say why we came here. I can tell you why Mrs.\r\nAshleigh came. Our neighbour, Mr. Vigors, is a distant connection of\r\nthe late Gilbert Ashleigh, one of the executors to his will, and the\r\nguardian to the heir-at-law. About ten days ago Mr. Vigors called on me,\r\nfor the first time since I felt it my duty to express my disapprobation\r\nof the strange vagaries so unhappily conceived by our poor dear friend\r\nDr. Lloyd. And when he had taken his chair, just where you now sit,\r\nDr. Fenwick, he said in a sepulchral voice, stretching out two fingers,\r\nso,--as if I were one of the what-do-you-call-’ems who go to sleep when\r\nhe bids them, ‘Marm, you know Mrs. Ashleigh? You correspond with her?’\r\n‘Yes, Mr. Vigors; is there any crime in that? You look as if there\r\nwere.’ ‘No crime, marm,’ said the man, quite seriously. ‘Mrs.\r\nAshleigh is a lady of amiable temper, and you are a woman of masculine\r\nunderstanding.’”\r\n\r\nHere there was a general titter. Mrs. Colonel Poyntz hushed it with a\r\nlook of severe surprise. “What is there to laugh at? All women would be\r\nmen if they could. If my understanding is masculine, so much the better\r\nfor me. I thanked Mr. Vigors for his very handsome compliment, and he\r\nthen went on to say that though Mrs. Ashleigh would now have to leave\r\nKirby Hall in a very few weeks, she seemed quite unable to make up her\r\nmind where to go; that it had occurred to him that, as Miss Ashleigh was\r\nof an age to see a little of the world, she ought not to remain buried\r\nin the country; while, being of quiet mind, she recoiled from the\r\ndissipation of London. Between the seclusion of the one and the turmoil\r\nof the other, the society of L---- was a happy medium. He should be glad\r\nof my opinion. He had put off asking for it, because he owned his belief\r\nthat I had behaved unkindly to his lamented friend, Dr. Lloyd; but he\r\nnow found himself in rather an awkward position. His ward, young Sumner,\r\nhad prudently resolved on fixing his country residence at Kirby Hall,\r\nrather than at Haughton Park, the much larger seat which had so suddenly\r\npassed to his inheritance, and which he could not occupy without a vast\r\nestablishment, that to a single man, so young, would be but a cumbersome\r\nand costly trouble. Mr. Vigors was pledged to his ward to obtain him\r\npossession of Kirby Hall, the precise day agreed upon, but Mrs. Ashleigh\r\ndid not seem disposed to stir,--could not decide where else to go. Mr.\r\nVigors was loth to press hard on his old friend’s widow and child. It\r\nwas a thousand pities Mrs Ashleigh could not make up her mind; she had\r\nhad ample time for preparation. A word from me at this moment would\r\nbe an effective kindness. Abbots’ House was vacant, with a garden so\r\nextensive that the ladies would not miss the country. Another party was\r\nafter it, but--‘Say no more,’ I cried; ‘no party but my dear old friend\r\nAnne Ashleigh shall have Abbots’ House. So that question is settled.’\r\nI dismissed Mr. Vigors, sent for my carriage, that is, for Mr. Barker’s\r\nyellow fly and his best horses,--and drove that very day to Kirby Hall,\r\nwhich, though not in this county, is only twenty-five miles distant. I\r\nslept there that night. By nine o’clock the next morning I had secured\r\nMrs. Ashleigh’s consent, on the promise to save her all trouble; came\r\nback, sent for the landlord, settled the rent, lease, agreement; engaged\r\nForbes’ vans to remove the furniture from Kirby Hall; told Forbes to\r\nbegin with the beds. When her own bed came, which was last night, Anne\r\nAshleigh came too. I have seen her this morning. She likes the place,\r\nso does Lilian. I asked them to meet you all here to-night; but Mrs.\r\nAshleigh was tired. The last of the furniture was to arrive today;\r\nand though dear Mrs. Ashleigh is an undecided character, she is not\r\ninactive. But it is not only the planning where to put tables and chairs\r\nthat would have tried her today: she has had Mr. Vigors on her hands\r\nall the afternoon, and he has been--here’s her little note--what are the\r\nwords? No doubt ‘most overpowering and oppressive;’ no, ‘most kind and\r\nattentive,’--different words, but, as applied to Mr. Vigors, they mean\r\nthe same thing.\r\n\r\n“And now, next Monday---we must leave them in peace till then--you will\r\nall call on the Ashleighs. The Hill knows what is due to itself; it\r\ncannot delegate to Mr. Vigors, a respectable man indeed, but who does\r\nnot belong to its set, its own proper course of action towards those\r\nwho would shelter themselves on its bosom. The Hill cannot be kind and\r\nattentive, overpowering or oppressive by proxy. To those newborn into\r\nits family circle it cannot be an indifferent godmother; it has towards\r\nthem all the feelings of a mother,--or of a stepmother, as the case may\r\nbe. Where it says ‘This can be no child of mine,’ it is a stepmother\r\nindeed; but in all those whom I have presented to its arms, it has\r\nhitherto, I am proud to say, recognized desirable acquaintances, and to\r\nthem the Hill has been a mother. And now, my dear Mr. Sloman, go to your\r\nrubber; Poyntz is impatient, though he don’t show it. Miss Brabazon,\r\nlove, we all long to see you seated at the piano,--you play so divinely!\r\nSomething gay, if you please; something gay, but not very noisy,--Mr.\r\nLeopold Symthe will turn the leaves for you. Mrs. Bruce, your own\r\nfavourite set at vingt-un, with four new recruits. Dr. Fenwick, you are\r\nlike me, don’t play cards, and don’t care for music; sit here, and talk\r\nor not, as you please, while I knit.”\r\n\r\nThe other guests thus disposed of, some at the card-tables, some round\r\nthe piano, I placed myself at Mrs. Poyntz’s side, on a seat niched in\r\nthe recess of a window which an evening unusually warm for the month of\r\nMay permitted to be left open. I was next to one who had known Lilian\r\nas a child, one from whom I had learned by what sweet name to call\r\nthe image which my thoughts had already shrined. How much that I still\r\nlonged to know she could tell me! But in what form of question could I\r\nlead to the subject, yet not betray my absorbing interest in it? Longing\r\nto speak, I felt as if stricken dumb; stealing an unquiet glance towards\r\nthe face beside me, and deeply impressed with that truth which the Hill\r\nhad long ago reverently acknowledged,--namely, that Mrs. Colonel Poyntz\r\nwas a very superior woman, a very powerful creature.\r\n\r\nAnd there she sat knitting, rapidly, firmly; a woman somewhat on the\r\nother side of forty, complexion a bronze paleness, hair a bronze brown,\r\nin strong ringlets cropped short behind,--handsome hair for a man; lips\r\nthat, when closed, showed inflexible decision, when speaking, became\r\nsupple and flexible with an easy humour and a vigilant finesse; eyes\r\nof a red hazel, quick but steady,--observing, piercing, dauntless eyes;\r\naltogether a fine countenance,--would have been a very fine countenance\r\nin a man; profile sharp, straight, clear-cut, with an expression, when\r\nin repose, like that of a sphinx; a frame robust, not corpulent; of\r\nmiddle height, but with an air and carriage that made her appear tall;\r\npeculiarly white firm hands, indicative of vigorous health, not a vein\r\nvisible on the surface.\r\n\r\nThere she sat knitting, knitting, and I by her side, gazing now on\r\nherself, now on her work, with a vague idea that the threads in the\r\nskein of my own web of love or of life were passing quick through those\r\nnoiseless fingers. And, indeed, in every web of romance, the fondest,\r\none of the Parcae is sure to be some matter-of-fact She, Social Destiny,\r\nas little akin to romance herself as was this worldly Queen of the Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nI have given a sketch of the outward woman of Mrs. Colonel Poyntz. The\r\ninner woman was a recondite mystery deep as that of the sphinx, whose\r\nfeatures her own resembled. But between the outward and the inward woman\r\nthere is ever a third woman,--the conventional woman,--such as the whole\r\nhuman being appears to the world,--always mantled, sometimes masked.\r\n\r\nI am told that the fine people of London do not recognize the title\r\nof “Mrs. Colonel.” If that be true, the fine people of London must be\r\nclearly in the wrong, for no people in the universe could be finer than\r\nthe fine people of Abbey Hill; and they considered their sovereign had\r\nas good a right to the title of Mrs. Colonel as the Queen of England has\r\nto that of “our Gracious Lady.” But Mrs. Poyntz herself never assumed\r\nthe title of Mrs. Colonel; it never appeared on her cards,--any more\r\nthan the title of “Gracious Lady” appears on the cards which convey the\r\ninvitation that a Lord Steward or Lord Chamberlain is commanded by\r\nher Majesty to issue. To titles, indeed, Mrs. Poyntz evinced no\r\nsuperstitious reverence. Two peeresses, related to her, not distantly,\r\nwere in the habit of paying her a yearly visit which lasted two or three\r\ndays. The Hill considered these visits an honour to its eminence. Mrs.\r\nPoyntz never seemed to esteem them an honour to herself; never boasted\r\nof them; never sought to show off her grand relations, nor put herself\r\nthe least out of the way to receive them. Her mode of life was free from\r\nostentation. She had the advantage of being a few hundreds a year\r\nricher than any other inhabitant of the Hill; but she did not devote her\r\nsuperior resources to the invidious exhibition of superior splendour.\r\nLike a wise sovereign, the revenues of her exchequer were applied to the\r\nbenefit of her subjects, and not to the vanity of egotistical parade. As\r\nno one else on the Hill kept a carriage, she declined to keep one. Her\r\nentertainments were simple, but numerous. Twice a week she received the\r\nHill, and was genuinely at home to it. She contrived to make her parties\r\nproverbially agreeable. The refreshments were of the same kind as those\r\nwhich the poorest of her old maids of honour might proffer; but they\r\nwere better of their kind, the best of their kind,--the best tea, the\r\nbest lemonade, the best cakes. Her rooms had an air of comfort, which\r\nwas peculiar to them. They looked like rooms accustomed to receive, and\r\nreceive in a friendly way; well warmed, well lighted, card-tables and\r\npiano each in the place that made cards and music inviting; on the walls\r\na few old family portraits, and three or four other pictures said to be\r\nvaluable and certainly pleasing,--two Watteaus, a Canaletti, a Weenix;\r\nplenty of easy-chairs and settees covered with a cheerful chintz,--in\r\nthe arrangement of the furniture generally an indescribable careless\r\nelegance. She herself was studiously plain in dress, more conspicuously\r\nfree from jewelry and trinkets than any married lady on the Hill. But\r\nI have heard from those who were authorities on such a subject that she\r\nwas never seen in a dress of the last year’s fashion. She adopted the\r\nmode as it came out, just enough to show that she was aware it was out;\r\nbut with a sober reserve, as much as to say, “I adopt the fashion as far\r\nas it suits myself; I do not permit the fashion to adopt me.” In short,\r\nMrs. Colonel Poyntz was sometimes rough, sometimes coarse, always\r\nmasculine, and yet somehow or other masculine in a womanly way; but she\r\nwas never vulgar because never affected. It was impossible not to allow\r\nthat she was a thorough gentlewoman, and she could do things that\r\nlower other gentlewomen, without any loss of dignity. Thus she was an\r\nadmirable mimic, certainly in itself the least ladylike condescension of\r\nhumour. But when she mimicked, it was with so tranquil a gravity, or so\r\nroyal a good humour, that one could only say, “What talents for society\r\ndear Mrs. Colonel has!” As she was a gentlewoman emphatically, so the\r\nother colonel, the he-colonel, was emphatically a gentleman; rather shy,\r\nbut not cold; hating trouble of every kind, pleased to seem a cipher in\r\nhis own house. If the sole study of Mrs. Colonel had been to make\r\nher husband comfortable, she could not have succeeded better than by\r\nbringing friends about him and then taking them off his hands. Colonel\r\nPoyntz, the he-colonel, had seen, in his youth, actual service; but had\r\nretired from his profession many years ago, shortly after his marriage.\r\nHe was a younger brother of one of the principal squires in the country;\r\ninherited the house he lived in, with some other valuable property in\r\nand about L----, from an uncle; was considered a good landlord; and\r\npopular in Low Town, though he never interfered in its affairs. He was\r\npunctiliously neat in his dress; a thin youthful figure, crowned with a\r\nthick youthful wig. He never seemed to read anything but the newspapers\r\nand the “Meteorological Journal:” was supposed to be the most\r\nweatherwise man in all L----. He had another intellectual\r\npredilection,--whist; but in that he had less reputation for wisdom.\r\nPerhaps it requires a rarer combination of mental faculties to win\r\nan odd trick than to divine a fall in the glass. For the rest, the\r\nhe-colonel, many years older than his wife, despite the thin youthful\r\nfigure, was an admirable aid-de-camp to the general in command, Mrs.\r\nColonel; and she could not have found one more obedient, more devoted,\r\nor more proud of a distinguished chief.\r\n\r\nIn giving to Mrs. Colonel Poyntz the appellation of Queen of the Hill,\r\nlet there be no mistake. She was not a constitutional sovereign; her\r\nmonarchy was absolute. All her proclamations had the force of laws.\r\n\r\nSuch ascendancy could not have been attained without considerable\r\ntalents for acquiring and keeping it. Amidst all her off-hand, brisk,\r\nimperious frankness, she had the ineffable discrimination of tact.\r\nWhether civil or rude, she was never civil or rude but what she carried\r\npublic opinion along with her. Her knowledge of general society must\r\nhave been limited, as must be that of all female sovereigns; but she\r\nseemed gifted with an intuitive knowledge of human nature, which she\r\napplied to her special ambition of ruling it. I have not a doubt that if\r\nshe had been suddenly transferred, a perfect stranger, to the world of\r\nLondon, she would have soon forced her way to its selectest circles,\r\nand, when once there, held her own against a duchess.\r\n\r\nI have said that she was not affected: this might be one cause of her\r\nsway over a set in which nearly every other woman was trying rather to\r\nseem, than to be, a somebody.\r\n\r\nBut if Mrs. Colonel Poyntz was not artificial, she was artful, or\r\nperhaps I might more justly say artistic. In all she said and did there\r\nwere conduct, system, plan. She could be a most serviceable friend, a\r\nmost damaging enemy; yet I believe she seldom indulged in strong likings\r\nor strong hatreds. All was policy,--a policy akin to that of a grand\r\nparty chief, determined to raise up those whom, for any reason of state,\r\nit was prudent to favour, and to put down those whom, for any reason of\r\nstate, it was expedient to humble or to crush.\r\n\r\nEver since the controversy with Dr. Lloyd, this lady had honoured me\r\nwith her benignest countenance; and nothing could be more adroit\r\nthan the manner in which, while imposing me on others as an oracular\r\nauthority, she sought to subject to her will the oracle itself.\r\n\r\nShe was in the habit of addressing me in a sort of motherly way, as if\r\nshe had the deepest interest in my welfare, happiness, and reputation.\r\nAnd thus, in every compliment, in every seeming mark of respect, she\r\nmaintained the superior dignity of one who takes from responsible\r\nstation the duty to encourage rising merit; so that, somehow or other,\r\ndespite all that pride which made me believe that I needed no helping\r\nhand to advance or to clear my way through the world, I could not shake\r\noff from my mind the impression that I was mysteriously patronized by\r\nMrs. Colonel Poyntz.\r\n\r\nWe might have sat together five minutes, side by side in silence as\r\ncomplete as if in the cave of Trophonius--when without looking up from\r\nher work, Mrs. Poyntz said abruptly,--\r\n\r\n“I am thinking about you, Dr. Fenwick. And you--are thinking about some\r\nother woman. Ungrateful man!”\r\n\r\n“Unjust accusation! My very silence should prove how intently my\r\nthoughts were fixed on you, and on the weird web which springs under\r\nyour hand in meshes that bewilder the gaze and snare the attention.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz looked up at me for a moment--one rapid glance of the bright\r\nred hazel eye--and said,--\r\n\r\n“Was I really in your thoughts? Answer truly.”\r\n\r\n“Truly, I answer, you were.”\r\n\r\n“That is strange! Who can it be?”\r\n\r\n“Who can it be? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“If you were thinking of me, it was in connection with some other\r\nperson,--some other person of my own sex. It is certainly not poor dear\r\nMiss Brabazon. Who else can it be?”\r\n\r\nAgain the red eye shot over me, and I felt my cheek redden beneath it.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” she said, lowering her voice; “you are in love!”\r\n\r\n“In love!--I! Permit me to ask you why you think so?”\r\n\r\n“The signs are unmistakable; you are altered in your manner, even in the\r\nexpression of your face, since I last saw you; your manner is generally\r\nquiet and observant,--it is now restless and distracted; your expression\r\nof face is generally proud and serene,--it is now humbled and\r\ntroubled. You have something on your mind! It is not anxiety for your\r\nreputation,--that is established; nor for your fortune,--that is made;\r\nit is not anxiety for a patient or you would scarcely be here. But\r\nanxiety it is,--an anxiety that is remote from your profession, that\r\ntouches your heart and is new to it!”\r\n\r\nI was startled, almost awed; but I tried to cover my confusion with a\r\nforced laugh.\r\n\r\n“Profound observer! Subtle analyst! You have convinced me that I must\r\nbe in love, though I did not suspect it before. But when I strive to\r\nconjecture the object, I am as much perplexed as yourself; and with you,\r\nI ask, who can it be?”\r\n\r\n“Whoever it be,” said Mrs. Poyntz, who had paused, while I spoke, from\r\nher knitting, and now resumed it very slowly and very carefully, as if\r\nher mind and her knitting worked in unison together,--“whoever it be,\r\nlove in you would be serious; and, with or without love, marriage is\r\na serious thing to us all. It is not every pretty girl that would suit\r\nAllen Fenwick.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! is there any pretty girl whom Allen Fenwick would suit?”\r\n\r\n“Tut! You should be above the fretful vanity that lays traps for a\r\ncompliment. Yes; the time has come in your life and your career when\r\nyou would do well to marry. I give my consent to that,” she added with\r\na smile as if in jest, and a slight nod as if in earnest. The knitting\r\nhere went on more decidedly, more quickly. “But I do not yet see the\r\nperson. No! ‘T is a pity, Allen Fenwick” (whenever Mrs. Poyntz called\r\nme by my Christian name, she always assumed her majestic motherly\r\nmanner),--“a pity that, with your birth, energies, perseverance,\r\ntalents, and, let me add, your advantages of manner and person,--a pity\r\nthat you did not choose a career that might achieve higher fortunes and\r\nlouder fame than the most brilliant success can give to a provincial\r\nphysician. But in that very choice you interest me. My choice has been\r\nmuch the same,--a small circle, but the first in it. Yet, had I been a\r\nman, or had my dear Colonel been a man whom it was in the power of a\r\nwoman’s art to raise one step higher in that metaphorical ladder which\r\nis not the ladder of the angels, why, then--what then? No matter! I\r\nam contented. I transfer my ambition to Jane. Do you not think her\r\nhandsome?”\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt of that,” said I, carelessly and naturally.\r\n\r\n“I have settled Jane’s lot in my own mind,” resumed Mrs. Poyntz,\r\nstriking firm into another row of knitting. “She will marry a country\r\ngentleman of large estate. He will go into parliament. She will study\r\nhis advancement as I study Poyntz’s comfort. If he be clever, she will\r\nhelp to make him a minister; if he be not clever, his wealth will make\r\nher a personage, and lift him into a personage’s husband. And, now that\r\nyou see I have no matrimonial designs on you, Allen Fenwick, think if it\r\nwill be worth while to confide in me. Possibly I may be useful--”\r\n\r\n“I know not how to thank you; but, as yet, I have nothing to confide.”\r\n\r\nWhile thus saying, I turned my eyes towards the open window beside which\r\nI sat. It was a beautiful soft night, the May moon in all her splendour.\r\nThe town stretched, far and wide, below with all its numberless\r\nlights,--below, but somewhat distant; an intervening space was covered,\r\nhere, by the broad quadrangle (in the midst of which stood, massive and\r\nlonely, the grand old church), and, there, by the gardens and scattered\r\ncottages or mansions that clothed the sides of the hill.\r\n\r\n“Is not that house,” I said, after a short pause, “yonder with the three\r\ngables, the one in which--in which poor Dr. Lloyd lived--Abbots’ House?”\r\n\r\nI spoke abruptly, as if to intimate my desire to change the subject of\r\nconversation. My hostess stopped her knitting, half rose, looked forth.\r\n\r\n“Yes. But what a lovely night! How is it that the moon blends into\r\nharmony things of which the sun only marks the contrast? That stately\r\nold church tower, gray with its thousand years, those vulgar tile-roofs\r\nand chimney-pots raw in the freshness of yesterday,--now, under the\r\nmoonlight, all melt into one indivisible charm!”\r\n\r\nAs my hostess thus spoke, she had left her seat, taking her work with\r\nher, and passed from the window into the balcony. It was not often that\r\nMrs. Poyntz condescended to admit what is called “sentiment” into\r\nthe range of her sharp, practical, worldly talk; but she did so at\r\ntimes,--always, when she did, giving me the notion of an intellect much\r\ntoo comprehensive not to allow that sentiment has a place in this life,\r\nbut keeping it in its proper place, by that mixture of affability and\r\nindifference with which some high-born beauty allows the genius, but\r\nchecks the presumption, of a charming and penniless poet. For a few\r\nminutes her eyes roved over the scene in evident enjoyment; then, as\r\nthey slowly settled upon the three gables of Abbots’ House, her face\r\nregained that something of hardness which belonged to its decided\r\ncharacter; her fingers again mechanically resumed her knitting, and she\r\nsaid, in her clear, unsoftened, metallic chime of voice, “Can you guess\r\nwhy I took so much trouble to oblige Mr. Vigors and locate Mrs. Ashleigh\r\nyonder?”\r\n\r\n“You favoured us with a full explanation of your reasons.”\r\n\r\n“Some of my reasons; not the main one. People who undertake the task\r\nof governing others, as I do, be their rule a kingdom or a hamlet, must\r\nadopt a principle of government and adhere to it. The principle that\r\nsuits best with the Hill is Respect for the Proprieties. We have not\r\nmuch money; entre nous, we have no great rank. Our policy is, then, to\r\nset up the Proprieties as an influence which money must court and rank\r\nis afraid of. I had learned just before Mr. Vigors called on me that\r\nLady Sarah Bellasis entertained the idea of hiring Abbots’ House.\r\nLondon has set its face against her; a provincial town would be more\r\ncharitable. An earl’s daughter, with a good income and an awfully bad\r\nname, of the best manners and of the worst morals, would have made sad\r\nhavoc among the Proprieties. How many of our primmest old maids would\r\nhave deserted tea and Mrs. Poyntz for champagne and her ladyship! The\r\nHill was never in so imminent a danger. Rather than Lady Sarah Bellasis\r\nshould have had that house, I would have taken it myself, and stocked it\r\nwith owls.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Ashleigh turned up just in the critical moment. Lady Sarah is\r\nfoiled, the Proprieties safe, and so that question is settled.”\r\n\r\n“And it will be pleasant to have your early friend so near you.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz lifted her eyes full upon me.\r\n\r\n“Do you know Mrs. Ashleigh?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least.”\r\n\r\n“She has many virtues and few ideas. She is commonplace weak, as I\r\nam commonplace strong. But commonplace weak can be very lovable. Her\r\nhusband, a man of genius and learning, gave her his whole heart,--a\r\nheart worth having; but he was not ambitious, and he despised the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“I think you said your daughter was very much attached to Miss Ashleigh?\r\nDoes her character resemble her mother’s?”\r\n\r\nI was afraid while I spoke that I should again meet Mrs. Poyntz’s\r\nsearching gaze, but she did not this time look up from her work.\r\n\r\n“No; Lilian is anything but commonplace.”\r\n\r\n“You described her as having delicate health; you implied a hope that\r\nshe was not consumptive. I trust that there is no serious reason for\r\napprehending a constitutional tendency which at her age would require\r\nthe most careful watching!”\r\n\r\n“I trust not. If she were to die--Dr. Fenwick, what is the matter?”\r\n\r\nSo terrible had been the picture which this woman’s words had brought\r\nbefore me, that I started as if my own life had received a shock.\r\n\r\n“I beg pardon,” I said falteringly, pressing my hand to my heart; “a\r\nsudden spasm here,--it is over now. You were saying that--that--”\r\n\r\n“I was about to say-” and here Mrs. Poyntz laid her hand lightly on\r\nmine,--“I was about to say that if Lilian Ashleigh were to die, I should\r\nmourn for her less than I might for one who valued the things of the\r\nearth more. But I believe there is no cause for the alarm my words so\r\ninconsiderately excited in you. Her mother is watchful and devoted; and\r\nif the least thing ailed Lilian, she would call in medical advice. Mr.\r\nVigors would, I know, recommend Dr. Jones.”\r\n\r\nClosing our conference with those stinging words, Mrs. Poyntz here\r\nturned back into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nI remained some minutes on the balcony, disconcerted, enraged. With\r\nwhat consummate art had this practised diplomatist wound herself into my\r\nsecret! That she had read my heart better than myself was evident from\r\nthat Parthian shaft, barbed with Dr. Jones, which she had shot over her\r\nshoulder in retreat. That from the first moment in which she had decoyed\r\nme to her side, she had detected “the something” on my mind, was perhaps\r\nbut the ordinary quickness of female penetration. But it was with no\r\nordinary craft that the whole conversation afterwards had been so shaped\r\nas to learn the something, and lead me to reveal the some one to whom\r\nthe something was linked. For what purpose? What was it to her? What\r\nmotive could she have beyond the mere gratification of curiosity?\r\nPerhaps, at first, she thought I had been caught by her daughter’s showy\r\nbeauty, and hence the half-friendly, half-cynical frankness with which\r\nshe had avowed her ambitious projects for that young lady’s matrimonial\r\nadvancement. Satisfied by my manner that I cherished no presumptuous\r\nhopes in that quarter, her scrutiny was doubtless continued from that\r\npleasure in the exercise of a wily intellect which impels schemers and\r\npoliticians to an activity for which, without that pleasure itself,\r\nthere would seem no adequate inducement. And besides, the ruling passion\r\nof this petty sovereign was power; and if knowledge be power, there is\r\nno better instrument of power over a contumacious subject than that hold\r\non his heart which is gained in the knowledge of its secret.\r\n\r\nBut “secret”! Had it really come to this? Was it possible that the mere\r\nsight of a human face, never beheld before, could disturb the whole\r\ntenor of my life,--a stranger of whose mind and character I knew\r\nnothing, whose very voice I had never heard? It was only by the\r\nintolerable pang of anguish that had rent my heart in the words,\r\ncarelessly, abruptly spoken, “if she were to die,” that I had felt how\r\nthe world would be changed to me, if indeed that face were seen in it no\r\nmore! Yes, secret it was no longer to myself, I loved! And like all on\r\nwhom love descends, sometimes softly, slowly, with the gradual wing of\r\nthe cushat settling down into its nest, sometimes with the swoop of the\r\neagle on his unsuspecting quarry, I believed that none ever before loved\r\nas I loved; that such love was an abnormal wonder, made solely for\r\nme, and I for it. Then my mind insensibly hushed its angrier and more\r\nturbulent thoughts, as my gaze rested upon the roof-tops of Lilian’s\r\nhome, and the shimmering silver of the moonlit willow, under which I had\r\nseen her gazing into the roseate heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the drawing-room, the party was evidently about to\r\nbreak up. Those who had grouped round the piano were now assembled round\r\nthe refreshment-table. The cardplayers had risen, and were settling or\r\ndiscussing gains and losses. While I was searching for my hat, which\r\nI had somewhere mislaid, a poor gentleman, tormented by tic-doloureux,\r\ncrept timidly up to me,--the proudest and the poorest of all the\r\nhidalgos settled on the Hill. He could not afford a fee for a\r\nphysician’s advice; but pain had humbled his pride, and I saw at a\r\nglance that he was considering how to take a surreptitious advantage of\r\nsocial intercourse, and obtain the advice without paying the fee. The\r\nold man discovered the hat before I did, stooped, took it up, extended\r\nit to me with the profound bow of the old school, while the other hand,\r\nclenched and quivering, was pressed into the hollow of his cheek,\r\nand his eyes met mine with wistful mute entreaty. The instinct of my\r\nprofession seized me at once. I could never behold suffering without\r\nforgetting all else in the desire to relieve it.\r\n\r\n“You are in pain,” said I, softly. “Sit down and describe the symptoms.\r\nHere, it is true, I am no professional doctor, but I am a friend who is\r\nfond of doctoring, and knows something about it.”\r\n\r\nSo we sat down a little apart from the other guests, and after a few\r\nquestions and answers, I was pleased to find that his “tic” did not\r\nbelong to the less curable kind of that agonizing neuralgia. I was\r\nespecially successful in my treatment of similar sufferings, for which I\r\nhad discovered an anodyne that was almost specific. I wrote on a leaf of\r\nmy pocketbook a prescription which I felt sure would be efficacious, and\r\nas I tore it out and placed it in his hand, I chanced to look up, and\r\nsaw the hazel eyes of my hostess fixed upon me with a kinder and softer\r\nexpression than they often condescended to admit into their cold and\r\npenetrating lustre. At that moment, however, her attention was drawn\r\nfrom me to a servant, who entered with a note, and I heard him say,\r\nthough in an undertone, “From Mrs. Ashleigh.”\r\n\r\nShe opened the note, read it hastily, ordered the servant to wait\r\nwithout the door, retired to her writing-table, which stood near the\r\nplace at which I still lingered, rested her face on her hand, and seemed\r\nmusing. Her meditation was very soon over. She turned her head, and to\r\nmy surprise, beckoned to me. I approached.\r\n\r\n“Sit here,” she whispered: “turn your back towards those people, who are\r\nno doubt watching us. Read this.”\r\n\r\nShe placed in my hand the note she had just received. It contained but a\r\nfew words, to this effect:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MARGARET,--I am so distressed.  Since I wrote to you a few\r\n   hours ago, Lilian is taken suddenly ill, and I fear seriously.  What\r\n   medical man should I send for?  Let my servant have his name and\r\n   address.\r\n\r\n                                                    A.  A.\r\n\r\nI sprang from my seat.\r\n\r\n“Stay,” said Mrs. Poyntz. “Would you much care if I sent the servant to\r\nDr. Jones?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, madam, you are cruel! What have I done that you should become my\r\nenemy?”\r\n\r\n“Enemy! No. You have just befriended one of my friends. In this world\r\nof fools intellect should ally itself with intellect. No; I am not your\r\nenemy! But you have not yet asked me to be your friend.”\r\n\r\nHere she put into my hands a note she had written while thus speaking.\r\n“Receive your credentials. If there be any cause for alarm, or if I can\r\nbe of use, send for me.” Resuming the work she had suspended, but with\r\nlingering, uncertain fingers, she added, “So far, then, this is settled.\r\nNay, no thanks; it is but little that is settled as yet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes I was once more in the grounds of that old gable\r\nhouse; the servant, who went before me, entered them by the stairs and\r\nthe wicket-gate of the private entrance; that way was the shortest.\r\nSo again I passed by the circling glade and the monastic well,--sward,\r\ntrees, and ruins all suffused in the limpid moonlight.\r\n\r\nAnd now I was in the house; the servant took up-stairs the note with\r\nwhich I was charged, and a minute or two afterwards returned and\r\nconducted me to the corridor above, in which Mrs. Ashleigh received me.\r\nI was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n“Your daughter--is--is--not seriously ill, I hope. What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” she said, under her breath. “Will you step this way for a\r\nmoment?” She passed through a doorway to the right. I followed her,\r\nand as she placed on the table the light she had been holding, I looked\r\nround with a chill at the heart,--it was the room in which Dr. Lloyd had\r\ndied. Impossible to mistake. The furniture indeed was changed, there was\r\nno bed in the chamber; but the shape of the room, the position of the\r\nhigh casement, which was now wide open, and through which the moonlight\r\nstreamed more softly than on that drear winter night, the great square\r\nbeams intersecting the low ceiling,--all were impressed vividly on my\r\nmemory. The chair to which Mrs. Ashleigh beckoned me was placed just on\r\nthe spot where I had stood by the bedhead of the dying man.\r\n\r\nI shrank back,--I could not have seated myself there. So I remained\r\nleaning against the chimney-piece, while Mrs. Ashleigh told her story.\r\n\r\nShe said that on their arrival the day before, Lilian had been in more\r\nthan usually good health and spirits, delighted with the old house,\r\nthe grounds, and especially the nook by the Monk’s Well, at which Mrs.\r\nAshleigh had left her that evening in order to make some purchases in\r\nthe town, in company with Mr. Vigors. When Mrs. Ashleigh returned, she\r\nand Mr. Vigors had sought Lilian in that nook, and Mrs. Ashleigh then\r\ndetected, with a mother’s eye, some change in Lilian which alarmed her.\r\nShe seemed listless and dejected, and was very pale; but she denied that\r\nshe felt unwell. On regaining the house she had sat down in the room in\r\nwhich we then were,--“which,” said Mrs. Ashleigh, “as it is not required\r\nfor a sleeping-room, my daughter, who is fond of reading, wished to fit\r\nup as her own morning-room, or study. I left her here and went into the\r\ndrawing-room below with Mr. Vigors. When he quitted me, which he did\r\nvery soon, I remained for nearly an hour giving directions about the\r\nplacing of furniture, which had just arrived, from our late residence.\r\nI then went up-stairs to join my daughter, and to my terror found her\r\napparently lifeless in her chair. She had fainted away.”\r\n\r\nI interrupted Mrs. Ashleigh here. “Has Miss Ashleigh been subject to\r\nfainting fits?”\r\n\r\n“No, never. When she recovered she seemed bewildered, disinclined to\r\nspeak. I got her to bed, and as she then fell quietly to sleep, my mind\r\nwas relieved. I thought it only a passing effect of excitement, in a\r\nchange of abode; or caused by something like malaria in the atmosphere\r\nof that part of the grounds in which I had found her seated.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely. The hour of sunset at this time of year is trying to\r\ndelicate constitutions. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“About three quarters of an hour ago she woke up with a loud cry, and\r\nhas been ever since in a state of great agitation, weeping violently,\r\nand answering none of my questions. Yet she does not seem light-headed,\r\nbut rather what we call hysterical.”\r\n\r\n“You will permit me now to see her. Take comfort; in all you tell me I\r\nsee nothing to warrant serious alarm.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTo the true physician there is an inexpressible sanctity in the sick\r\nchamber. At its threshold the more human passions quit their hold on\r\nhis heart. Love there would be profanation; even the grief permitted to\r\nothers he must put aside. He must enter that room--a calm intelligence.\r\nHe is disabled for his mission if he suffer aught to obscure the\r\nkeen quiet glance of his science. Age or youth, beauty or deformity,\r\ninnocence or guilt, merge their distinctions in one common\r\nattribute--human suffering appealing to human skill.\r\n\r\nWoe to the households in which the trusted Healer feels not on his\r\nconscience the solemn obligations of his glorious art! Reverently as in\r\na temple, I stood in the virgin’s chamber. When her mother placed her\r\nhand in mine, and I felt the throb of its pulse, I was aware of no\r\nquicker beat of my own heart. I looked with a steady eye on the face\r\nmore beautiful from the flush that deepened the delicate hues of\r\nthe young cheek, and the lustre that brightened the dark blue of the\r\nwandering eyes. She did not at first heed me, did not seem aware of\r\nmy presence; but kept murmuring to herself words which I could not\r\ndistinguish.\r\n\r\nAt length, when I spoke to her, in that low, soothing tone which we\r\nlearn at the sick-bed, the expression of her face altered suddenly; she\r\npassed the hand I did not hold over her forehead, turned round, looked\r\nat me full and long, with unmistakable surprise, yet not as if the\r\nsurprise displeased her,--less the surprise which recoils from the\r\nsight of a stranger than that which seems doubtfully to recognize an\r\nunexpected friend. Yet on the surprise there seemed to creep something\r\nof apprehension, of fear; her hand trembled, her voice quivered, as she\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n“Can it be, can it be? Am I awake? Mother, who is this?”\r\n\r\n“Only a kind visitor, Dr. Fenwick, sent by Mrs. Poyntz, for I was uneasy\r\nabout you, darling. How are you now?”\r\n\r\n“Better. Strangely better.”\r\n\r\nShe removed her hand gently from mine, and with an involuntary modest\r\nshrinking turned towards Mrs. Ashleigh, drawing her mother towards\r\nherself, so that she became at once hidden from me.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that there was here no delirium, nor even more than the slight\r\nand temporary fever which often accompanies a sudden nervous attack in\r\nconstitutions peculiarly sensitive, I retired noiselessly from the\r\nroom, and went, not into that which had been occupied by the ill-fated\r\nNaturalist, but down-stairs into the drawing-room, to write my\r\nprescription. I had already sent the servant off with it to the\r\nchemist’s before Mrs. Ashleigh joined me.\r\n\r\n“She seems recovering surprisingly; her forehead is cooler; she\r\nis perfectly self-possessed, only she cannot account for her own\r\nseizure,--cannot account either for the fainting or the agitation with\r\nwhich she awoke from sleep.”\r\n\r\n“I think I can account for both. The first room in which she\r\nentered--that in which she fainted--had its window open; the sides of\r\nthe window are overgrown with rank creeping plants in full blossom. Miss\r\nAshleigh had already predisposed herself to injurious effects from the\r\neffluvia by fatigue, excitement, imprudence in sitting out at the fall\r\nof a heavy dew. The sleep after the fainting fit was the more disturbed,\r\nbecause Nature, always alert and active in subjects so young, was\r\nmaking its own effort to right itself from an injury. Nature has nearly\r\nsucceeded. What I have prescribed will a little aid and accelerate that\r\nwhich Nature has yet to do, and in a day or two I do not doubt that your\r\ndaughter will be perfectly restored. Only let me recommend care to avoid\r\nexposure to the open air during the close of the day. Let her avoid also\r\nthe room in which she was first seized, for it is a strange phenomenon\r\nin nervous temperaments that a nervous attack may, without visible\r\ncause, be repeated in the same place where it was first experienced. You\r\nhad better shut up the chamber for at least some weeks, burn fires in\r\nit, repaint and paper it, sprinkle chloroform. You are not, perhaps,\r\naware that Dr. Lloyd died in that room after a prolonged illness. Suffer\r\nme to wait till your servant returns with the medicine, and let me\r\nemploy the interval in asking you a few questions. Miss Ashleigh, you\r\nsay, never had a fainting fit before. I should presume that she is not\r\nwhat we call strong. But has she ever had any illness that alarmed you?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“No great liability to cold and cough, to attacks of the chest or\r\nlungs?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. Still I have feared that she may have a tendency to\r\nconsumption. Do you think so? Your questions alarm me!”\r\n\r\n“I do not think so; but before I pronounce a positive opinion, one\r\nquestion more. You say you have feared a tendency to consumption. Is\r\nthat disease in her family? She certainly did not inherit it from you.\r\nBut on her father’s side?”\r\n\r\n“Her father,” said Mrs. Ashleigh, with tears in her eyes, “died young,\r\nbut of brain fever, which the medical men said was brought on by over\r\nstudy.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, my dear madam. What you say confirms my belief that your\r\ndaughter’s constitution is the very opposite to that in which the seeds\r\nof consumption lurk. It is rather that far nobler constitution,\r\nwhich the keenness of the nervous susceptibility renders delicate but\r\nelastic,--as quick to recover as it is to suffer.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, thank you, Dr. Fenwick, for what you say. You take a load\r\nfrom my heart; for Mr. Vigors, I know, thinks Lilian consumptive, and\r\nMrs. Poyntz has rather frightened me at times by hints to the same\r\neffect. But when you speak of nervous susceptibility, I do not quite\r\nunderstand you. My daughter is not what is commonly called nervous. Her\r\ntemper is singularly even.”\r\n\r\n“But if not excitable, should you also say that she is not\r\nimpressionable? The things which do not disturb her temper may, perhaps,\r\ndeject her spirits. Do I make myself understood?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think I understand your distinction; but I am not quite sure\r\nif it applies. To most things that affect the spirits she is not more\r\nsensitive than other girls, perhaps less so; but she is certainly very\r\nimpressionable in some things.”\r\n\r\n“In what?”\r\n\r\n“She is more moved than any one I ever knew by objects in external\r\nnature, rural scenery, rural sounds, by music, by the books that she\r\nreads,--even books that are not works of imagination. Perhaps in all\r\nthis she takes after her poor father, but in a more marked degree,--at\r\nleast, I observe it more in her; for he was very silent and reserved.\r\nAnd perhaps also her peculiarities have been fostered by the seclusion\r\nin which she has been brought up. It was with a view to make her a\r\nlittle more like girls of her own age that our friend, Mrs. Poyntz,\r\ninduced me to come here. Lilian was reconciled to this change; but she\r\nshrank from the thoughts of London, which I should have preferred. Her\r\npoor father could not endure London.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Ashleigh is fond of reading?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she is fond of reading, but more fond of musing. She will sit by\r\nherself for hours without book or work, and seem as abstracted as if in\r\na dream. She was so even in her earliest childhood. Then she would tell\r\nme what she had been conjuring up to herself. She would say that she had\r\nseen--positively seen--beautiful lands far away from earth; flowers and\r\ntrees not like ours. As she grew older this visionary talk displeased\r\nme, and I scolded her, and said that if others heard her, they would\r\nthink that she was not only silly but very untruthful. So of late years\r\nshe never ventures to tell me what, in such dreamy moments, she suffers\r\nherself to imagine; but the habit of musing continues still. Do you not\r\nagree with Mrs. Poyntz that the best cure would be a little cheerful\r\nsociety amongst other young people?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said I, honestly, though with a jealous pang. “But here\r\ncomes the medicine. Will you take it up to her, and then sit with her\r\nhalf an hour or so? By that time I expect she will be asleep. I will\r\nwait here till you return. Oh, I can amuse myself with the newspapers\r\nand books on your table. Stay! one caution: be sure there are no flowers\r\nin Miss Ashleigh’s sleeping-room. I think I saw a treacherous rose-tree\r\nin a stand by the window. If so, banish it.”\r\n\r\nLeft alone, I examined the room in which, oh, thought of joy! I had\r\nsurely now won the claim to become a privileged guest. I touched the\r\nbooks Lilian must have touched; in the articles of furniture, as yet\r\nso hastily disposed that the settled look of home was not about them,\r\nI still knew that I was gazing on things which her mind must associate\r\nwith the history of her young life. That luteharp must be surely hers,\r\nand the scarf, with a girl’s favourite colours,--pure white and pale\r\nblue,--and the bird-cage, and the childish ivory work-case, with\r\nimplements too pretty for use,--all spoke of her.\r\n\r\nIt was a blissful, intoxicating revery, which Mrs. Ashleigh’s entrance\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nLilian was sleeping calmly. I had no excuse to linger there any longer.\r\n\r\n“I leave you, I trust, with your mind quite at ease,” said I. “You will\r\nallow me to call to-morrow, in the afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, gratefully.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashleigh held out her hand as I made towards the door.\r\n\r\nIs there a physician who has not felt at times how that ceremonious fee\r\nthrows him back from the garden-land of humanity into the market-place\r\nof money,--seems to put him out of the pale of equal friendship, and\r\nsay, “True, you have given health and life. Adieu! there, you are paid\r\nfor it!” With a poor person there would have been no dilemma, but\r\nMrs. Ashleigh was affluent: to depart from custom here was almost\r\nimpertinence. But had the penalty of my refusal been the doom of never\r\nagain beholding Lilian, I could not have taken her mother’s gold. So I\r\ndid not appear to notice the hand held out to me, and passed by with a\r\nquickened step.\r\n\r\n“But, Dr. Fenwick, stop!”\r\n\r\n“No, ma’am, no! Miss Ashleigh would have recovered as soon without me.\r\nWhenever my aid is really wanted, then--but Heaven grant that time may\r\nnever come! We will talk again about her to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nI was gone,--now in the garden ground, odorous with blossoms; now in the\r\nlane, inclosed by the narrow walls; now in the deserted streets, over\r\nwhich the moon shone full as in that winter night when I hurried from\r\nthe chamber of death. But the streets were not ghastly now, and the moon\r\nwas no longer Hecate, that dreary goddess of awe and spectres, but the\r\nsweet, simple Lady of the Stars, on whose gentle face lovers have gazed\r\never since (if that guess of astronomers be true) she was parted from\r\nearth to rule the tides of its deeps from afar, even as love, from love\r\ndivided, rules the heart that yearns towards it with mysterious law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWith what increased benignity I listened to the patients who visited me\r\nthe next morning! The whole human race seemed to be worthier of love,\r\nand I longed to diffuse amongst all some rays of the glorious hope that\r\nhad dawned upon my heart. My first call, when I went forth, was on the\r\npoor young woman from whom I had been returning the day before, when an\r\nimpulse, which seemed like a fate, had lured me into the grounds where I\r\nhad first seen Lilian. I felt grateful to this poor patient; without her\r\nLilian herself might be yet unknown to me.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s brother, a young man employed in the police, and whose pay\r\nsupported a widowed mother and the suffering sister, received me at the\r\nthreshold of the cottage.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir, she is so much better to-day; almost free from pain. Will she\r\nlive now; can she live?”\r\n\r\n“If my treatment has really done the good you say; if she be really\r\nbetter under it, I think her recovery may be pronounced. But I must\r\nfirst see her.”\r\n\r\nThe girl was indeed wonderfully better. I felt that my skill was\r\nachieving a signal triumph; but that day even my intellectual pride was\r\nforgotten in the luxurious unfolding of that sense of heart which had so\r\nnewly waked into blossom.\r\n\r\nAs I recrossed the threshold, I smiled on the brother, who was still\r\nlingering there,--\r\n\r\n“Your sister is saved, Wady. She needs now chiefly wine, and good though\r\nlight nourishment; these you will find at my house; call there for them\r\nevery day.”\r\n\r\n“God bless you, sir! If ever I can serve you--” His tongue faltered, he\r\ncould say no more.\r\n\r\nServe me, Allen Fenwick--that poor policeman! Me, whom a king could not\r\nserve! What did I ask from earth but Fame and Lilian’s heart? Thrones\r\nand bread man wins from the aid of others; fame and woman’s heart he can\r\nonly gain through himself.\r\n\r\nSo I strode gayly up the hill, through the iron gates, into the fairy\r\nground, and stood before Lilian’s home.\r\n\r\nThe man-servant, on opening the door, seemed somewhat confused, and said\r\nhastily before I spoke,--\r\n\r\n“Not at home, sir; a note for you.”\r\n\r\nI turned the note mechanically in my hand; I felt stunned.\r\n\r\n“Not at home! Miss Ashleigh cannot be out. How is she?”\r\n\r\n“Better, sir, thank you.”\r\n\r\nI still could not open the note; my eyes turned wistfully towards\r\nthe windows of the house, and there--at the drawing-room window--I\r\nencountered the scowl of Mr. Vigors. I coloured with resentment, divined\r\nthat I was dismissed, and walked away with a proud crest and a firm\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nWhen I was out of the gates, in the blind lane, I opened the note. It\r\nbegan formally. “Mrs. Ashleigh presents her compliments,” and went on to\r\nthank me, civilly enough, for my attendance the night before, would not\r\ngive me the trouble to repeat my visit, and inclosed a fee, double the\r\namount of the fee prescribed by custom. I flung the money, as an asp\r\nthat had stung me, over the high wall, and tore the note into shreds.\r\nHaving thus idly vented my rage, a dull gnawing sorrow came heavily down\r\nupon all other emotions, stifling and replacing them. At the mouth of\r\nthe lane I halted. I shrank from the thought of the crowded streets\r\nbeyond; I shrank yet more from the routine of duties, which stretched\r\nbefore me in the desert into which daily life was so suddenly smitten. I\r\nsat down by the roadside, shading my dejected face with a nervous hand.\r\nI looked up as the sound of steps reached my ear, and saw Dr. Jones\r\ncoming briskly along the lane, evidently from Abbots’ House. He must\r\nhave been there at the very time I had called. I was not only dismissed\r\nbut supplanted. I rose before he reached the spot on which I had seated\r\nmyself, and went my way into the town, went through my allotted round of\r\nprofessional visits; but my attentions were not so tenderly devoted,\r\nmy skill so genially quickened by the glow of benevolence, as my poorer\r\npatients had found them in the morning. I have said how the physician\r\nshould enter the sick-room. “A Calm Intelligence!” But if you strike a\r\nblow on the heart, the intellect suffers. Little worth, I suspect, was\r\nmy “calm intelligence” that day. Bichat, in his famous book upon Life\r\nand Death, divides life into two classes,--animal and organic. Man’s\r\nintellect, with the brain for its centre, belongs to life animal; his\r\npassions to life organic, centred in the heart, in the viscera. Alas!\r\nif the noblest passions through which alone we lift ourselves into the\r\nmoral realm of the sublime and beautiful really have their centre in the\r\nlife which the very vegetable, that lives organically, shares with us!\r\nAnd, alas! if it be that life which we share with the vegetable, that\r\ncan cloud, obstruct, suspend, annul that life centred in the brain,\r\nwhich we share with every being howsoever angelic, in every star\r\nhowsoever remote, on whom the Creator bestows the faculty of thought!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly I remembered Mrs. Poyntz. I ought to call on her. So I\r\nclosed my round of visits at her door. The day was then far advanced,\r\nand the servant politely informed me that Mrs. Poyntz was at dinner. I\r\ncould only leave my card, with a message that I would pay my respects to\r\nher the next day. That evening I received from her this note:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Dear Dr. Fenwick,--I regret much that I cannot have the pleasure of\r\n   seeing you to-morrow.  Poyntz and I are going to visit his brother, at\r\n   the other end of the county, and we start early.  We shall be away some\r\n   days.  Sorry to hear from Mrs. Ashleigh that she has been persuaded by\r\n   Mr. Vigors to consult Dr. Jones about Lilian. Vigors and Jones both\r\n   frighten the poor mother, and insist upon consumptive tendencies.\r\n   Unluckily, you seem to have said there was little the matter.  Some\r\n   doctors train their practice as some preachers fill their churches,--by\r\n   adroit use of the appeals to terror.  You do not want patients, Dr.\r\n   Jones does.  And, after all, better perhaps as it is.\r\n                           Yours, etc.\r\n                                                 M. Poyntz.\r\n\r\nTo my more selfish grief, anxiety for Lilian was now added. I had seen\r\nmany more patients die from being mistreated for consumption than from\r\nconsumption itself. And Dr. Jones was a mercenary, cunning, needy man,\r\nwith much crafty knowledge of human foibles, but very little skill in\r\nthe treatment of human maladies. My fears were soon confirmed. A few\r\ndays after I heard from Miss Brabazon that Miss Ashleigh was seriously\r\nill, kept her room. Mrs. Ashleigh made this excuse for not immediately\r\nreturning the visits which the Hill had showered upon her. Miss Brabazon\r\nhad seen Dr. Jones, who had shaken his head, said it was a serious case;\r\nbut that time and care (his time and his care!) might effect wonders.\r\n\r\nHow stealthily at the dead of the night I would climb the Hill and look\r\ntowards the windows of the old sombre house,--one window, in which a\r\nlight burned dim and mournful, the light of a sick-room,--of hers!\r\n\r\nAt length Mrs. Poyntz came back, and I entered her house, having fully\r\nresolved beforehand on the line of policy to be adopted towards the\r\npotentate whom I hoped to secure as an ally. It was clear that neither\r\ndisguise nor half-confidence would baffle the penetration of so keen an\r\nintellect, nor propitiate the good will of so imperious and resolute a\r\ntemper. Perfect frankness here was the wisest prudence; and after\r\nall, it was most agreeable to my own nature, and most worthy of my own\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I found Mrs. Poyntz alone, and taking in both mine the hand\r\nshe somewhat coldly extended to me, I said, with the earnestness of\r\nsuppressed emotion,--\r\n\r\n“You observed when I last saw you, that I had not yet asked you to be\r\nmy friend. I ask it now. Listen to me with all the indulgence you can\r\nvouchsafe, and let me at least profit by your counsel if you refuse to\r\ngive me your aid.”\r\n\r\nRapidly, briefly, I went on to say how I had first seen Lilian, and how\r\nsudden, how strange to myself, had been the impression which that first\r\nsight of her had produced.\r\n\r\n“You remarked the change that had come over me,” said I; “you divined\r\nthe cause before I divined it myself,--divined it as I sat there beside\r\nyou, thinking that through you I might see, in the freedom of social\r\nintercourse, the face that was then haunting me. You know what has\r\nsince passed. Miss Ashleigh is ill; her case is, I am convinced,\r\nwholly misunderstood. All other feelings are merged in one sense of\r\nanxiety,--of alarm. But it has become due to me, due to all, to incur\r\nthe risk of your ridicule even more than of your reproof, by stating to\r\nyou thus candidly, plainly, bluntly, the sentiment which renders alarm\r\nso poignant, and which, if scarcely admissible to the romance of some\r\nwild dreamy boy, may seem an unpardonable folly in a man of my years and\r\nmy sober calling,--due to me, to you, to Mrs. Ashleigh, because still\r\nthe dearest thing in life to me is honour. And if you, who know Mrs.\r\nAshleigh so intimately, who must be more or less aware of her plans or\r\nwishes for her daughter’s future,--if you believe that those plans or\r\nwishes lead to a lot far more ambitious than an alliance with me could\r\noffer to Miss Ashleigh, then aid Mr. Vigors in excluding me from the\r\nhouse; aid me in suppressing a presumptuous, visionary passion. I cannot\r\nenter that house without love and hope at my heart; and the threshold\r\nof that house I must not cross if such love and such hope would be a sin\r\nand a treachery in the eyes of its owner. I might restore Miss Ashleigh\r\nto health; her gratitude might--I cannot continue. This danger must\r\nnot be to me nor to her, if her mother has views far above such a\r\nson-in-law. And I am the more bound to consider all this while it is yet\r\ntime, because I heard you state that Miss Ashleigh had a fortune, was\r\nwhat would be here termed an heiress. And the full consciousness that\r\nwhatever fame one in my profession may live to acquire, does not\r\nopen those vistas of social power and grandeur which are opened\r\nby professions to my eyes less noble in themselves,--that full\r\nconsciousness, I say, was forced upon me by certain words of your own.\r\nFor the rest, you know my descent is sufficiently recognized as that\r\namidst well-born gentry to have rendered me no mesalliance to families\r\nthe most proud of their ancestry, if I had kept my hereditary estate and\r\navoided the career that makes me useful to man. But I acknowledge that\r\non entering a profession such as mine--entering any profession except\r\nthat of arms or the senate--all leave their pedigree at its door, an\r\nerased or dead letter. All must come as equals, high-born or low-born,\r\ninto that arena in which men ask aid from a man as he makes himself; to\r\nthem his dead forefathers are idle dust. Therefore, to the advantage of\r\nbirth I cease to have a claim. I am but a provincial physician, whose\r\nstation would be the same had he been a cobbler’s son. But gold retains\r\nits grand privilege in all ranks. He who has gold is removed from\r\nthe suspicion that attaches to the greedy fortune-hunter. My private\r\nfortune, swelled by my savings, is sufficient to secure to any one I\r\nmarried a larger settlement than many a wealthy squire can make. I need\r\nno fortune with a wife; if she have one, it would be settled on herself.\r\nPardon these vulgar details. Now, have I made myself understood?”\r\n\r\n“Fully,” answered the Queen of the Hill, who had listened to me quietly,\r\nwatchfully, and without one interruption, “fully; and you have done\r\nwell to confide in me with so generous an unreserve. But before I say\r\nfurther, let me ask, what would be your advice for Lilian, supposing\r\nthat you ought not to attend her? You have no trust in Dr. Jones;\r\nneither have I. And Annie Ashleigh’s note received to-day, begging me\r\nto call, justifies your alarm. Still you think there is no tendency to\r\nconsumption?”\r\n\r\n“Of that I am certain so far as my slight glimpse of a case that to me,\r\nhowever, seems a simple and not uncommon one, will permit. But in\r\nthe alternative you put--that my own skill, whatever its worth, is\r\nforbidden--my earnest advice is that Mrs. Ashleigh should take her\r\ndaughter at once to London, and consult there those great authorities to\r\nwhom I cannot compare my own opinion or experience; and by their counsel\r\nabide.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz shaded her eyes with her hand for a few moments, and seemed\r\nin deliberation with herself. Then she said, with her peculiar smile,\r\nhalf grave, half ironical,--\r\n\r\n“In matters more ordinary you would have won me to your side long ago.\r\nThat Mr. Vigors should have presumed to cancel my recommendation to a\r\nsettler on the Hill was an act of rebellion, and involved the honour\r\nof my prerogative; but I suppressed my indignation at an affront so\r\nunusual, partly out of pique against yourself, but much more, I think,\r\nout of regard for you.”\r\n\r\n“I understand. You detected the secret of my heart; you knew that Mrs.\r\nAshleigh would not wish to see her daughter the wife of a provincial\r\nphysician.”\r\n\r\n“Am I sure, or are you sure, that the daughter herself would accept that\r\nfate; or if she accepted it, would not repent?”\r\n\r\n“Do you not think me the vainest of men when I say this,--that I cannot\r\nbelieve I should be so enthralled by a feeling at war with my reason,\r\nunfavoured by anything I can detect in my habits of mind, or even by the\r\ndreams of a youth which exalted science and excluded love, unless I was\r\nintimately convinced that Miss Ashleigh’s heart was free, that I could\r\nwin, and that I could keep it! Ask me why I am convinced of this, and I\r\ncan tell you no more why I think that she could love me than I can tell\r\nyou why I love her!”\r\n\r\n“I am of the world, worldly; but I am a woman, womanly,--though I may\r\nnot care to be thought it. And, therefore, though what you say is,\r\nregarded in a worldly point of view, sheer nonsense, regarded in a\r\nwomanly point of view, it is logically sound. But still you cannot know\r\nLilian as I do. Your nature and hers are in strong contrast. I do not\r\nthink she is a safe wife for you. The purest, the most innocent creature\r\nimaginable, certainly that, but always in the seventh heaven; and you\r\nin the seventh heaven just at this moment, but with an irresistible\r\ngravitation to the solid earth, which will have its way again when\r\nthe honeymoon is over--I do not believe you two would harmonize by\r\nintercourse. I do not believe Lilian would sympathize with you, and I am\r\nsure you could not sympathize with her throughout the long dull course\r\nof this workday life. And, therefore, for your sake, as well as hers, I\r\nwas not displeased to find that Dr. Jones had replaced you; and now, in\r\nreturn for your frankness, I say frankly, do not go again to that house.\r\nConquer this sentiment, fancy, passion, whatever it be. And I will\r\nadvise Mrs. Ashleigh to take Lilian to town. Shall it be so settled?”\r\n\r\nI could not speak. I buried my face in my hands--misery, misery,\r\ndesolation!\r\n\r\nI know not how long I remained thus silent, perhaps many minutes. At\r\nlength I felt a cold, firm, but not ungentle hand placed upon mine; and\r\na clear, full, but not discouraging voice said to me,--\r\n\r\n“Leave me to think well over this conversation, and to ponder well the\r\nvalue of all you have shown that you so deeply feel. The interests of\r\nlife do not fill both scales of the balance. The heart, which does not\r\nalways go in the same scale with the interests, still has its weight in\r\nthe scale opposed to them. I have heard a few wise men say, as many a\r\nsilly woman says, ‘Better be unhappy with one we love, than be happy\r\nwith one we love not.’ Do you say that too?”\r\n\r\n“With every thought of my brain, every beat of my pulse, I say it.”\r\n\r\n“After that answer, all my questionings cease. You shall hear from me\r\nto-morrow. By that time, I shall have seen Annie and Lilian. I shall\r\nhave weighed both scales of the balance,--and the heart here, Allen\r\nFenwick, seems very heavy. Go, now. I hear feet on the stairs, Poyntz\r\nbringing up some friendly gossiper; gossipers are spies.”\r\n\r\nI passed my hand over my eyes, tearless, but how tears would have\r\nrelieved the anguish that burdened them! and, without a word, went down\r\nthe stairs, meeting at the landing-place Colonel Poyntz and the old man\r\nwhose pain my prescription had cured. The old man was whistling a merry\r\ntune, perhaps first learned on the playground. He broke from it to\r\nthank, almost to embrace me, as I slid by him. I seized his jocund\r\nblessing as a good omen, and carried it with me as I passed into the\r\nbroad sunlight. Solitary--solitary! Should I be so evermore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nThe next day I had just dismissed the last of my visiting patients, and\r\nwas about to enter my carriage and commence my round, when I received a\r\ntwisted note containing but these words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Call on me to-day, as soon as you can.\r\n\r\n                                           M. Poyntz.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards I was in Mrs. Poyntz’s drawing-room.\r\n\r\n“Well, Allen Fenwick” said she, “I do not serve friends by halves. No\r\nthanks! I but adhere to a principle I have laid down for myself. I spent\r\nlast evening with the Ashleighs. Lilian is certainly much altered,--very\r\nweak, I fear very ill, and I believe very unskillfully treated by Dr.\r\nJones. I felt that it was my duty to insist on a change of physician;\r\nbut there was something else to consider before deciding who that\r\nphysician should be. I was bound, as your confidante, to consult your\r\nown scruples of honour. Of course I could not say point-blank to Mrs.\r\nAshleigh, ‘Dr. Fenwick admires your daughter, would you object to him\r\nas a son-in-law?’ Of course I could not touch at all on the secret with\r\nwhich you intrusted me; but I have not the less arrived at a conclusion,\r\nin agreement with my previous belief, that not being a woman of the\r\nworld, Annie Ashleigh has none of the ambition which women of the world\r\nwould conceive for a daughter who has a good fortune and considerable\r\nbeauty; that her predominant anxiety is for her child’s happiness, and\r\nher predominant fear is that her child will die. She would never oppose\r\nany attachment which Lilian might form; and if that attachment were for\r\none who had preserved her daughter’s life, I believe her own heart would\r\ngratefully go with her daughter’s. So far, then, as honour is concerned,\r\nall scruples vanish.”\r\n\r\nI sprang from my seat, radiant with joy. Mrs. Poyntz dryly continued:\r\n“You value yourself on your common-sense, and to that I address a few\r\nwords of counsel which may not be welcome to your romance. I said that\r\nI did not think you and Lilian would suit each other in the long\r\nrun; reflection confirms me in that supposition. Do not look at me so\r\nincredulously and so sadly. Listen, and take heed. Ask yourself what, as\r\na man whose days are devoted to a laborious profession, whose ambition\r\nis entwined with its success, whose mind must be absorbed in its\r\npursuits,--ask yourself what kind of a wife you would have sought to\r\nwin; had not this sudden fancy for a charming face rushed over your\r\nbetter reason, and obliterated all previous plans and resolutions.\r\nSurely some one with whom your heart would have been quite at rest; by\r\nwhom your thoughts would have been undistracted from the channels into\r\nwhich your calling should concentrate their flow; in short, a serene\r\ncompanion in the quiet holiday of a trustful home! Is it not so?”\r\n\r\n“You interpret my own thoughts when they have turned towards marriage.\r\nBut what is there in Lilian Ashleigh that should mar the picture you\r\nhave drawn?”\r\n\r\n“What is there in Lilian Ashleigh which in the least accords with the\r\npicture? In the first place, the wife of a young physician should not\r\nbe his perpetual patient. The more he loves her, and the more worthy she\r\nmay be of love, the more her case will haunt him wherever he goes. When\r\nhe returns home, it is not to a holiday; the patient he most cares for,\r\nthe anxiety that most gnaws him, awaits him there.”\r\n\r\n“But, good heavens! why should Lilian Ashleigh be a perpetual patient?\r\nThe sanitary resources of youth are incalculable. And--”\r\n\r\n“Let me stop you; I cannot argue against a physician in love! I will\r\ngive up that point in dispute, remaining convinced that there is\r\nsomething in Lilian’s constitution which will perplex, torment, and\r\nbaffle you. It was so with her father, whom she resembles in face and in\r\ncharacter. He showed no symptoms of any grave malady. His outward form\r\nwas, like Lilian’s, a model of symmetry, except in this, that, like\r\nhers, it was too exquisitely delicate; but when seemingly in the midst\r\nof perfect health, at any slight jar on the nerves he would become\r\nalarmingly ill. I was sure that he would die young, and he did so.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, but Mrs. Ashleigh said that his death was from brain-fever, brought\r\non by over-study. Rarely, indeed, do women so fatigue the brain. No\r\nfemale patient, in the range of my practice, ever died of purely mental\r\nexertion.”\r\n\r\n“Of purely mental exertion, no; but of heart emotion, many female\r\npatients, perhaps? Oh, you own that! I know nothing about nerves; but I\r\nsuppose that, whether they act on the brain or the heart, the result\r\nto life is much the same if the nerves be too finely strung for life’s\r\ndaily wear and tear. And this is what I mean, when I say you and Lilian\r\nwill not suit. As yet, she is a mere child; her nature undeveloped, and\r\nher affections therefore untried. You might suppose that you had won her\r\nheart; she might believe that she gave it to you, and both be deceived.\r\nIf fairies nowadays condescended to exchange their offspring with those\r\nof mortals, and if the popular tradition did not represent a fairy\r\nchangeling as an ugly peevish creature, with none of the grace of its\r\nparents, I should be half inclined to suspect that Lilian was one of the\r\nelfin people. She never seems at home on earth; and I do not think she\r\nwill ever be contented with a prosaic earthly lot. Now I have told you\r\nwhy I do not think she will suit you. I must leave it to yourself to\r\nconjecture how far you would suit her. I say this in due season, while\r\nyou may set a guard upon your impulse; while you may yet watch, and\r\nweigh, and meditate; and from this moment on that subject I say no more.\r\nI lend advice, but I never throw it away.”\r\n\r\nShe came here to a dead pause, and began putting on her bonnet and\r\nscarf, which lay on the table beside her. I was a little chilled by her\r\nwords, and yet more by the blunt, shrewd, hard look and manner which\r\naided the effect of their delivery; but the chill melted away in the\r\nsudden glow of my heart when she again turned towards me and said,--\r\n\r\n“Of course you guess, from these preliminary cautions, that you are\r\ngoing into danger? Mrs. Ashleigh wishes to consult you about Lilian, and\r\nI propose to take you to her house.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my friend, my dear friend, how can I ever repay you?” I caught her\r\nhand, the white firm hand, and lifted it to my lips.\r\n\r\nShe drew it somewhat hastily away, and laying it gently on my shoulder,\r\nsaid, in a soft voice, “Poor Allen, how little the world knows either\r\nof us! But how little perhaps we know ourselves! Come, your carriage is\r\nhere? That is right; we must put down Dr. Jones publicly and in all our\r\nstate.”\r\n\r\nIn the carriage Mrs. Poyntz told me the purport of that conversation\r\nwith Mrs. Ashleigh to which I owed my re-introduction to Abbots’ House.\r\nIt seems that Mr. Vigors had called early the morning after my first\r\nvisit! had evinced much discomposure on hearing that I had been\r\nsummoned! dwelt much on my injurious treatment of Dr. Lloyd, whom,\r\nas distantly related to himself, and he (Mr. Vigors) being distantly\r\nconnected with the late Gilbert Ashleigh, he endeavoured to fasten upon\r\nhis listener as one of her husband’s family, whose quarrel she was bound\r\nin honour to take up. He spoke of me as an infidel “tainted with French\r\ndoctrines,” and as a practitioner rash and presumptuous; proving his own\r\nfreedom from presumption and rashness by flatly deciding that my opinion\r\nmust be wrong. Previously to Mrs. Ashleigh’s migration to L----, Mr.\r\nVigors had interested her in the pretended phenomena of mesmerism. He\r\nhad consulted a clairvoyante, much esteemed by poor Dr. Lloyd, as\r\nto Lilian’s health, and the clairvoyante had declared her to be\r\nconstitutionally predisposed to consumption. Mr. Vigors persuaded Mrs.\r\nAshleigh to come at once with him and see this clairvoyante herself,\r\narmed with a lock of Lilian’s hair and a glove she had worn, as the\r\nmedia of mesmerical rapport.\r\n\r\nThe clairvoyante, one of those I had publicly denounced as an impostor,\r\nnaturally enough denounced me in return. On being asked solemnly by\r\nMr. Vigors “to look at Dr. Fenwick and see if his influence would be\r\nbeneficial to the subject,” the sibyl had become violently agitated, and\r\nsaid that, “when she looked at us together, we were enveloped in a black\r\ncloud; that this portended affliction and sinister consequences; that\r\nour rapport was antagonistic.” Mr. Vigors then told her to dismiss my\r\nimage, and conjure up that of Dr. Jones. Therewith the somnambule became\r\nmore tranquil, and said: “Dr. Jones would do well if he would be guided\r\nby higher lights than his own skill, and consult herself daily as to the\r\nproper remedies. The best remedy of all would be mesmerism. But since\r\nDr. Lloyd’s death, she did not know of a mesmerist, sufficiently gifted,\r\nin affinity with the patient.” In fine, she impressed and awed Mrs.\r\nAshleigh, who returned in haste, summoned Dr. Jones, and dismissed\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n“I could not have conceived Mrs. Ashleigh to be so utterly wanting in\r\ncommon-sense,” said I. “She talked rationally enough when I saw her.”\r\n\r\n“She has common-sense in general, and plenty of the sense most common,”\r\n answered Mrs. Poyntz; “but she is easily led and easily frightened\r\nwherever her affections are concerned, and therefore, just as easily as\r\nshe had been persuaded by Mr. Vigors and terrified by the somnambule,\r\nI persuaded her against the one, and terrified her against the other. I\r\nhad positive experience on my side, since it was clear that Lilian had\r\nbeen getting rapidly worse under Dr. Jones’s care. The main obstacles\r\nI had to encounter in inducing Mrs. Ashleigh to consult you again\r\nwere, first, her reluctance to disoblige Mr. Vigors, as a friend and\r\nconnection of Lilian’s father; and, secondly, her sentiment of shame\r\nin re-inviting your opinion after having treated you with so little\r\nrespect. Both these difficulties I took on myself. I bring you to her\r\nhouse, and, on leaving you, I shall go on to Mr. Vigors, and tell him\r\nwhat is done is my doing, and not to be undone by him; so that matter\r\nis settled. Indeed, if you were out of the question, I should not suffer\r\nMr. Vigors to re-introduce all these mummeries of clairvoyance and\r\nmesmerism into the precincts of the Hill. I did not demolish a man I\r\nreally liked in Dr. Lloyd, to set up a Dr. Jones, whom I despise, in his\r\nstead. Clairvoyance on Abbey Hill, indeed! I saw enough of it before.”\r\n\r\n“True; your strong intellect detected at once the absurdity of the whole\r\npretence,--the falsity of mesmerism, the impossibility of clairvoyance.”\r\n\r\n“No, my strong intellect did nothing of the kind. I do not know whether\r\nmesmerism be false or clairvoyance impossible; and I don’t wish to know.\r\nAll I do know is, that I saw the Hill in great danger,--young ladies\r\nallowing themselves to be put to sleep by gentlemen, and pretending\r\nthey had no will of their own against such fascination! Improper and\r\nshocking! And Miss Brabazon beginning to prophesy, and Mrs. Leopold\r\nSmythe questioning her maid (whom Dr. Lloyd declared to be highly\r\ngifted) as to all the secrets of her friends. When I saw this, I said,\r\n‘The Hill is becoming demoralized; the Hill is making itself ridiculous;\r\nthe Hill must be saved!’ I remonstrated with Dr. Lloyd as a friend; he\r\nremained obdurate. I annihilated him as an enemy, not to me but to the\r\nState. I slew my best lover for the good of Rome. Now you know why I\r\ntook your part,--not because I have any opinion, one way or the other,\r\nas to the truth or falsehood of what Dr. Lloyd asserted; but I have a\r\nstrong opinion that, whether they be true or false, his notions were\r\nthose which are not to be allowed on the Hill. And so, Allen Fenwick,\r\nthat matter was settled.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps at another time I might have felt some little humiliation\r\nto learn that I had been honoured with the influence of this great\r\npotentate not as a champion of truth, but as an instrument of policy;\r\nand I might have owned to some twinge of conscience in having assisted\r\nto sacrifice a fellow-seeker after science--misled, no doubt, but\r\npreferring his independent belief to his worldly interest--and sacrifice\r\nhim to those deities with whom science is ever at war,--the Prejudices\r\nof a Clique sanctified into the Proprieties of the World. But at that\r\nmoment the words I heard made no perceptible impression on my mind. The\r\ngables of Abbots’ House were visible above the evergreens and lilacs;\r\nanother moment, and the carriage stopped at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashleigh received us in the dining-room. Her manner to me, at\r\nfirst, was a little confused and shy. But my companion soon communicated\r\nsomething of her own happy ease to her gentler friend. After a short\r\nconversation we all three went to Lilian, who was in a little room on\r\nthe ground-floor, fitted up as her study. I was glad to perceive that my\r\ninterdict of the deathchamber had been respected.\r\n\r\nShe reclined on a sofa near the window, which was, however, jealously\r\nclosed; the light of the bright May-day obscured by blinds and\r\ncurtains; a large fire on the hearth; the air of the room that of a\r\nhot-house,--the ignorant, senseless, exploded system of nursing into\r\nconsumption those who are confined on suspicion of it! She did not heed\r\nus as we entered noiselessly; her eyes were drooped languidly on the\r\nfloor, and with difficulty I suppressed the exclamation that rose to my\r\nlips on seeing her. She seemed within the last few days so changed, and\r\non the aspect of the countenance there was so profound a melancholy!\r\nBut as she slowly turned at the sound of our footsteps, and her eyes met\r\nmine, a quick blush came into the wan cheek, and she half rose, but sank\r\nback as if the effort exhausted her. There was a struggle for breath,\r\nand a low hollow cough. Was it possible that I had been mistaken, and\r\nthat in that cough was heard the warning knell of the most insidious\r\nenemy to youthful life?\r\n\r\nI sat down by her side; I lured her on to talk of indifferent\r\nsubjects,--the weather, the gardens, the bird in the cage, which was\r\nplaced on the table near her. Her voice, at first low and feeble, became\r\ngradually stronger, and her face lighted up with a child’s innocent,\r\nplayful smile. No, I had not been mistaken! That was no lymphatic,\r\nnerveless temperament, on which consumption fastens as its lawful prey;\r\nhere there was no hectic pulse, no hurried waste of the vital flame.\r\nQuietly and gently I made my observations, addressed my questions,\r\napplied my stethoscope; and when I turned my face towards her mother’s\r\nanxious, eager eyes, that face told my opinion; for her mother sprang\r\nforward, clasped my hand, and said, through her struggling tears,--\r\n\r\n“You smile! You see nothing to fear?”\r\n\r\n“Fear! No, indeed! You will soon be again yourself, Miss Ashleigh, will\r\nyou not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, with her sweet laugh, “I shall be well now very soon.\r\nBut may I not have the window open; may I not go into the garden? I so\r\nlong for fresh air.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, darling,” exclaimed Mrs. Ashleigh, “not while the east winds\r\nlast. Dr. Jones said on no account. On no account, Dr. Fenwick, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Will you take my arm, Miss Ashleigh, for a few turns up and down\r\nthe room?” said I. “We will then see how far we may rebel against Dr.\r\nJones.”\r\n\r\nShe rose with some little effort, but there was no cough. At first\r\nher step was languid; it became lighter and more elastic after a few\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\n“Let her come out,” said I to Mrs. Ashleigh. “The wind is not in the\r\neast, and, while we are out, pray bid your servant lower to the last bar\r\nin the grate that fire,--only fit for Christmas.”\r\n\r\n“But--”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no buts! He is a poor doctor who is not a stern despot.”\r\n\r\nSo the straw hat and mantle were sent for. Lilian was wrapped with\r\nunnecessary care, and we all went forth into the garden. Involuntarily\r\nwe took the way to the Monk’s Well, and at every step Lilian seemed to\r\nrevive under the bracing air and temperate sun. We paused by the well.\r\n\r\n“You do not feel fatigued, Miss Ashleigh?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“But your face seems changed. It is grown sadder.”\r\n\r\n“Not sadder.”\r\n\r\n“Sadder than when I first saw it,--saw it when you were seated here!” I\r\nsaid this in a whisper. I felt her hand tremble as it lay on my arm.\r\n\r\n“You saw me seated here!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I will tell you how some day.”\r\n\r\nLilian lifted her eyes to mine, and there was in them that same surprise\r\nwhich I had noticed on my first visit,--a surprise that perplexed me,\r\nblended with no displeasure, but yet with a something of vague alarm.\r\n\r\nWe soon returned to the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashleigh made me a sign to follow her into the drawing-room,\r\nleaving Mrs. Poyntz with Lilian.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said she, tremblingly.\r\n\r\n“Permit me to see Dr. Jones’s prescriptions. Thank you. Ay, I thought\r\nso. My dear madam, the mistake here has been in depressing nature\r\ninstead of strengthening; in narcotics instead of stimulants. The main\r\nstimulants which leave no reaction are air and light. Promise me that I\r\nmay have my own way for a week,--that all I recommend will be implicitly\r\nheeded?”\r\n\r\n“I promise. But that cough,--you noticed it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The nervous system is terribly lowered, and nervous exhaustion is\r\na strange impostor; it imitates all manner of complaints with which\r\nit has no connection. The cough will soon disappear! But pardon my\r\nquestion. Mrs. Poyntz tells me that you consulted a clairvoyants about\r\nyour daughter. Does Miss Ashleigh know that you did so?”\r\n\r\n“No; I did not tell her.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad of that. And pray, for Heaven’s sake, guard her against all\r\nthat may set her thinking on such subjects. Above all, guard her against\r\nconcentring attention on any malady that your fears erroneously ascribe\r\nto her. It is amongst the phenomena of our organization that you cannot\r\nclosely rivet your consciousness on any part of the frame, however\r\nhealthy, but it will soon begin to exhibit morbid sensibility. Try\r\nto fix all your attention on your little finger for half an hour, and\r\nbefore the half hour is over the little finger will be uneasy, probably\r\neven painful. How serious, then, is the danger to a young girl, at the\r\nage in which imagination is most active, most intense, if you force\r\nupon her a belief that she is in danger of a mortal disease! It is a\r\npeculiarity of youth to brood over the thought of early death much more\r\nresignedly, much more complacently, than we do in maturer years. Impress\r\non a young imaginative girl, as free from pulmonary tendencies as you\r\nand I are, the conviction that she must fade away into the grave, and\r\nthough she may not actually die of consumption, you instil slow poison\r\ninto her system. Hope is the natural aliment of youth. You impoverish\r\nnourishment where you discourage hope. As soon as this temporary illness\r\nis over, reject for your daughter the melancholy care which seems to her\r\nown mind to mark her out from others of her age. Rear her for the air,\r\nwhich is the kindest life-giver; to sleep with open windows: to be out\r\nat sunrise. Nature will do more for her than all our drugs can do. You\r\nhave been hitherto fearing Nature; now trust to her.”\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Poyntz joined us, and having, while I had been speaking,\r\nwritten my prescription and some general injunctions, I closed my advice\r\nwith an appeal to that powerful protectress.\r\n\r\n“This, my dear madam, is a case in which I need your aid, and I ask\r\nit. Miss Ashleigh should not be left with no other companion than her\r\nmother. A change of faces is often as salutary as a change of air.\r\nIf you could devote an hour or two this very evening to sit with Miss\r\nAshleigh, to talk to her with your usual cheerfulness, and--”\r\n\r\n“Annie,” interrupted Mrs. Poyntz, “I will come and drink tea with you at\r\nhalf-past seven, and bring my knitting; and perhaps, if you ask him, Dr.\r\nFenwick will come too! He can be tolerably entertaining when he likes\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“It is too great a tax on his kindness, I fear,” said Mrs. Ashleigh.\r\n“But,” she added cordially, “I should be grateful indeed if he would\r\nspare us an hour of his time.”\r\n\r\nI murmured an assent which I endeavoured to make not too joyous.\r\n\r\n“So that matter is settled,” said Mrs. Poyntz; “and now I shall go to\r\nMr. Vigors and prevent his further interference.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but, Margaret, pray don’t offend him,--a connection of my poor\r\ndear Gilbert’s. And so tetchy! I am sure I do not know how you’ll manage\r\nto--”\r\n\r\n“To get rid of him? Never fear. As I manage everything and everybody,”\r\n said Mrs. Poyntz, bluntly. So she kissed her friend on the forehead,\r\ngave me a gracious nod, and, declining the offer of my carriage, walked\r\nwith her usual brisk, decided tread down the short path towards the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashleigh timidly approached me, and again the furtive hand\r\nbashfully insinuated the hateful fee.\r\n\r\n“Stay,” said I; “this is a case which needs the most constant watching.\r\nI wish to call so often that I should seem the most greedy of doctors if\r\nmy visits were to be computed at guineas. Let me be at ease to effect\r\nmy cure; my pride of science is involved in it. And when amongst all the\r\nyoung ladies of the Hill you can point to none with a fresher bloom, or\r\na fairer promise of healthful life, than the patient you intrust to my\r\ncare, why, then the fee and the dismissal. Nay, nay; I must refer you to\r\nour friend Mrs. Poyntz. It was so settled with her before she brought me\r\nhere to displace Dr. Jones.” Therewith I escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nIn less than a week Lilian was convalescent; in less than a fortnight\r\nshe regained her usual health,--nay, Mrs. Ashleigh declared that she\r\nhad never known her daughter appear so cheerful and look so well. I had\r\nestablished a familiar intimacy at Abbots’ House; most of my evenings\r\nwere spent there. As horse exercise formed an important part of my\r\nadvice, Mrs. Ashleigh had purchased a pretty and quiet horse for her\r\ndaughter; and, except the weather was very unfavourable, Lilian now\r\nrode daily with Colonel Poyntz, who was a notable equestrian, and often\r\naccompanied by Miss Jane Poyntz, and other young ladies of the Hill.\r\nI was generally relieved from my duties in time to join her as she\r\nreturned homewards. Thus we made innocent appointments, openly, frankly,\r\nin her mother’s presence, she telling me beforehand in what direction\r\nexcursions had been planned with Colonel Poyntz, and I promising to fall\r\nin with the party--if my avocations would permit. At my suggestion,\r\nMrs. Ashleigh now opened her house almost every evening to some of the\r\nneighbouring families; Lilian was thus habituated to the intercourse of\r\nyoung persons of her own age. Music and dancing and childlike games made\r\nthe old house gay. And the Hill gratefully acknowledged to Mrs. Poyntz,\r\n“that the Ashleighs were indeed a great acquisition.”\r\n\r\nBut my happiness was not uncheckered. In thus unselfishly surrounding\r\nLilian with others, I felt the anguish of that jealousy which is\r\ninseparable from those earlier stages of love, when the lover as yet\r\nhas won no right to that self-confidence which can only spring from the\r\nassurance that he is loved.\r\n\r\nIn these social reunions I remained aloof from Lilian. I saw her courted\r\nby the gay young admirers whom her beauty and her fortune drew around\r\nher,--her soft face brightening in the exercise of the dance, which the\r\ngravity of my profession rather than my years forbade to join; and her\r\nlaugh, so musically subdued, ravishing my ear and fretting my heart\r\nas if the laugh were a mockery on my sombre self and my presumptuous\r\ndreams. But no, suddenly, shyly, her eyes would steal away from those\r\nabout her, steal to the corner in which I sat, as if they missed me,\r\nand, meeting my own gaze, their light softened before they turned away;\r\nand the colour on her cheek would deepen, and to her lip there came a\r\nsmile different from the smile that it shed on others. And then--and\r\nthen--all jealousy, all sadness vanished, and I felt the glory which\r\nblends with the growing belief that we are loved.\r\n\r\nIn that diviner epoch of man’s mysterious passion, when ideas of\r\nperfection and purity, vague and fugitive before, start forth and\r\nconcentre themselves round one virgin shape,--that rises out from the\r\nsea of creation, welcomed by the Hours and adorned by the Graces,--how\r\nthe thought that this archetype of sweetness and beauty singles himself\r\nfrom the millions, singles himself for her choice, ennobles and lifts\r\nup his being! Though after-experience may rebuke the mortal’s illusion,\r\nthat mistook for a daughter of Heaven a creature of clay like himself,\r\nyet for a while the illusion has grandeur. Though it comes from the\r\nsenses which shall later oppress and profane it, the senses at first\r\nshrink into shade, awed and hushed by the presence that charms them. All\r\nthat is brightest and best in the man has soared up like long-dormant\r\ninstincts of Heaven, to greet and to hallow what to him seems life’s\r\nfairest dream of the heavenly! Take the wings from the image of Love,\r\nand the god disappears from the form!\r\n\r\nThus, if at moments jealous doubt made my torture, so the moment’s\r\nrelief from it sufficed for my rapture. But I had a cause for disquiet\r\nless acute but less varying than jealousy.\r\n\r\nDespite Lilian’s recovery from the special illness which had more\r\nimmediately absorbed my care, I remained perplexed as to its cause\r\nand true nature. To her mother I gave it the convenient epithet of\r\n“nervous;” but the epithet did not explain to myself all the symptoms I\r\nclassified by it. There was still, at times, when no cause was apparent\r\nor conjecturable, a sudden change in the expression of her countenance,\r\nin the beat of her pulse; the eye would become fixed, the bloom would\r\nvanish, the pulse would sink feebler and feebler till it could be\r\nscarcely felt; yet there was no indication of heart disease, of\r\nwhich such sudden lowering of life is in itself sometimes a warning\r\nindication. The change would pass away after a few minutes, during which\r\nshe seemed unconscious, or, at least, never spoke--never appeared to\r\nheed what was said to her. But in the expression of her countenance\r\nthere was no character of suffering or distress; on the contrary,\r\na wondrous serenity, that made her beauty more beauteous, her very\r\nyouthfulness younger; and when this spurious or partial kind of syncope\r\npassed, she recovered at once without effort, without acknowledging\r\nthat she had felt faint or unwell, but rather with a sense of recruited\r\nvitality, as the weary obtain from a sleep. For the rest her spirits\r\nwere more generally light and joyous than I should have premised from\r\nher mother’s previous description. She would enter mirthfully into the\r\nmirth of young companions round her: she had evidently quick perception\r\nof the sunny sides of life; an infantine gratitude for kindness; an\r\ninfantine joy in the trifles that amuse only those who delight in tastes\r\npure and simple. But when talk rose into graver and more contemplative\r\ntopics, her attention became earnest and absorbed; and sometimes a rich\r\neloquence, such as I have never before nor since heard from lips so\r\nyoung, would startle me first into a wondering silence, and soon into a\r\ndisapproving alarm: for the thoughts she then uttered seemed to me too\r\nfantastic, too visionary, too much akin to the vagaries of a wild though\r\nbeautiful imagination. And then I would seek to check, to sober,\r\nto distract fancies with which my reason had no sympathy, and the\r\nindulgence of which I regarded as injurious to the normal functions of\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nWhen thus, sometimes with a chilling sentence, sometimes with a\r\nhalf-sarcastic laugh, I would repress outpourings frank and musical\r\nas the songs of a forest-bird, she would look at me with a kind of\r\nplaintive sorrow,--often sigh and shiver as she turned away. Only in\r\nthose modes did she show displeasure; otherwise ever sweet and docile,\r\nand ever, if, seeing that I had pained her, I asked forgiveness,\r\nhumbling herself rather to ask mine, and brightening our reconciliation\r\nwith her angel smile. As yet I had not dared to speak of love; as yet I\r\ngazed on her as the captive gazes on the flowers and the stars through\r\nthe gratings of his cell, murmuring to himself, “When shall the doors\r\nunclose?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nIt was with a wrath suppressed in the presence of the fair ambassadress,\r\nthat Mr. Vigors had received from Mrs. Poyntz the intelligence that I\r\nhad replaced Dr. Jones at Abbots’ House not less abruptly than Dr. Jones\r\nhad previously supplanted me. As Mrs. Poyntz took upon herself the whole\r\nresponsibility of this change, Mr. Vigors did not venture to condemn it\r\nto her face; for the Administrator of Laws was at heart no little in awe\r\nof the Autocrat of Proprieties; as Authority, howsoever established, is\r\nin awe of Opinion, howsoever capricious.\r\n\r\nTo the mild Mrs. Ashleigh the magistrate’s anger was more decidedly\r\nmanifested. He ceased his visits; and in answer to a long and\r\ndeprecatory letter with which she endeavoured to soften his resentment\r\nand win him back to the house, he replied by an elaborate combination\r\nof homily and satire. He began by excusing himself from accepting\r\nher invitations, on the ground that his time was valuable, his habits\r\ndomestic; and though ever willing to sacrifice both time and habits\r\nwhere he could do good, he owed it to himself and to mankind to\r\nsacrifice neither where his advice was rejected and his opinion\r\ncontemned. He glanced briefly, but not hastily, at the respect with\r\nwhich her late husband had deferred to his judgment, and the benefits\r\nwhich that deference had enabled him to bestow. He contrasted the\r\nhusband’s deference with the widow’s contumely, and hinted at the\r\nevils which the contumely would not permit him to prevent. He could\r\nnot presume to say what women of the world might think due to deceased\r\nhusbands, but even women of the world generally allowed the claims of\r\nliving children, and did not act with levity where their interests were\r\nconcerned, still less where their lives were at stake. As to Dr. Jones,\r\nhe, Mr. Vigors, had the fullest confidence in his skill. Mrs. Ashleigh\r\nmust judge for herself whether Mrs. Poyntz was as good an authority upon\r\nmedical science as he had no doubt she was upon shawls and ribbons. Dr.\r\nJones was a man of caution and modesty; he did not indulge in the\r\nhollow boasts by which charlatans decoy their dupes; but Dr. Jones had\r\nprivately assured him that though the case was one that admitted of no\r\nrash experiments, he had no fear of the result if his own prudent system\r\nwere persevered in. What might be the consequences of any other system,\r\nDr. Jones would not say, because he was too high-minded to express his\r\ndistrust of the rival who had made use of underhand arts to supplant\r\nhim. But Mr. Vigors was convinced, from other sources of information\r\n(meaning, I presume, the oracular prescience of his clairvoyants), that\r\nthe time would come when the poor young lady would herself insist on\r\ndiscarding Dr. Fenwick, and when “that person” would appear in a very\r\ndifferent light to many who now so fondly admired and so reverentially\r\ntrusted him. When that time arrived, he, Mr. Vigors, might again be of\r\nuse; but, meanwhile, though he declined to renew his intimacy at Abbots’\r\nHouse, or to pay unavailing visits of mere ceremony, his interest in\r\nthe daughter of his old friend remained undiminished, nay, was rather\r\nincreased by compassion; that he should silently keep his eye upon\r\nher; and whenever anything to her advantage suggested itself to him,\r\nhe should not be deterred by the slight with which Mrs. Ashleigh\r\nhad treated his judgment from calling on her, and placing before her\r\nconscience as a mother his ideas for her child’s benefit, leaving to\r\nherself then, as now, the entire responsibility of rejecting the advice\r\nwhich he might say, without vanity, was deemed of some value by those\r\nwho could distinguish between sterling qualities and specious pretences.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashleigh’s was that thoroughly womanly nature which instinctively\r\nleans upon others. She was diffident, trustful, meek, affectionate. Not\r\nquite justly had Mrs. Poyntz described her as “commonplace weak,” for\r\nthough she might be called weak, it was not because she was commonplace;\r\nshe had a goodness of heart, a sweetness of disposition, to which\r\nthat disparaging definition could not apply. She could only be called\r\ncommonplace inasmuch as in the ordinary daily affairs of life she had a\r\ngreat deal of ordinary daily commonplace good-sense. Give her a routine\r\nto follow, and no routine could be better adhered to. In the allotted\r\nsphere of a woman’s duties she never seemed in fault. No household, not\r\neven Mrs. Poyntz’s, was more happily managed. The old Abbots’ House had\r\nmerged its original antique gloom in the softer character of pleasing\r\nrepose. All her servants adored Mrs. Ashleigh; all found it a pleasure\r\nto please her; her establishment had the harmony of clockwork; comfort\r\ndiffused itself round her like quiet sunshine round a sheltered spot.\r\nTo gaze on her pleasing countenance, to listen to the simple talk that\r\nlapsed from her guileless lips, in even, slow, and lulling murmur, was\r\nin itself a respite from “eating cares.” She was to the mind what the\r\ncolour of green is to the eye. She had, therefore, excellent sense in\r\nall that relates to every-day life. There, she needed not to consult\r\nanother; there, the wisest might have consulted her with profit. But\r\nthe moment anything, however trivial in itself, jarred on the routine to\r\nwhich her mind had grown wedded, the moment an incident hurried her out\r\nof the beaten track of woman’s daily life, then her confidence forsook\r\nher; then she needed a confidant, an adviser; and by that confidant\r\nor adviser she could be credulously lured or submissively controlled.\r\nTherefore, when she lost, in Mr. Vigors, the guide she had been\r\naccustomed to consult whenever she needed guidance, she turned;\r\nhelplessly and piteously, first to Mrs. Poyntz, and then yet more\r\nimploringly to me, because a woman of that character is never quite\r\nsatisfied without the advice of a man; and where an intimacy more\r\nfamiliar than that of his formal visits is once established with a\r\nphysician, confidence in him grows fearless and rapid, as the natural\r\nresult of sympathy concentrated on an object of anxiety in common\r\nbetween himself and the home which opens its sacred recess to his\r\nobservant but tender eye. Thus Mrs. Ashleigh had shown me Mr. Vigors’s\r\nletter, and, forgetting that I might not be as amiable as herself,\r\nbesought me to counsel her how to conciliate and soften her lost\r\nhusband’s friend and connection. That character clothed him with dignity\r\nand awe in her soft forgiving eyes. So, smothering my own resentment,\r\nless perhaps at the tone of offensive insinuation against myself than\r\nat the arrogance with which this prejudiced intermeddler implied to a\r\nmother the necessity of his guardian watch over a child under her\r\nown care, I sketched a reply which seemed to me both dignified and\r\nplacatory, abstaining from all discussion, and conveying the assurance\r\nthat Mrs. Ashleigh would be at all times glad to hear, and disposed to\r\nrespect, whatever suggestion so esteemed a friend of her husband would\r\nkindly submit to her for the welfare of her daughter.\r\n\r\nThere all communication had stopped for about a month since the date of\r\nmy reintroduction to Abbots’ House. One afternoon I unexpectedly met Mr.\r\nVigors at the entrance of the blind lane, I on my way to Abbots’ House,\r\nand my first glance at his face told me that he was coming from it, for\r\nthe expression of that face was more than usually sinister; the sullen\r\nscowl was lit into significant menace by a sneer of unmistakable\r\ntriumph. I felt at once that he had succeeded in some machination\r\nagainst me, and with ominous misgivings quickened my steps.\r\n\r\nI found Mrs. Ashleigh seated alone in front of the house, under a large\r\ncedar-tree that formed a natural arbour in the centre of the sunny lawn.\r\nShe was perceptibly embarrassed as I took my seat beside her.\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said I, forcing a smile, “that Mr. Vigors has not been telling\r\nyou that I shall kill my patient, or that she looks much worse than she\r\ndid under Dr. Jones’s care?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said. “He owned cheerfully that Lilian had grown quite strong,\r\nand said, without any displeasure, that he had heard how gay she had\r\nbeen, riding out and even dancing,--which is very kind in him, for he\r\ndisapproves of dancing, on principle.”\r\n\r\n“But still I can see he has said something to vex or annoy you; and, to\r\njudge by his countenance when I met him in the lane, I should conjecture\r\nthat that something was intended to lower the confidence you so kindly\r\nrepose in me.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you not; he did not mention your name, either to me or to\r\nLilian. I never knew him more friendly; quite like old times. He is a\r\ngood man at heart, very, and was much attached to my poor husband.”\r\n\r\n“Did Mr. Ashleigh profess a very high opinion of Mr. Vigors?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t quite know that, because my dear Gilbert never spoke to\r\nme much about him. Gilbert was naturally very silent. But he shrank from\r\nall trouble--all worldly affairs--and Mr. Vigors managed his estate, and\r\ninspected his steward’s books, and protected him through a long lawsuit\r\nwhich he had inherited from his father. It killed his father. I don’t\r\nknow what we should have done without Mr. Vigors, and I am so glad he\r\nhas forgiven me.”\r\n\r\n“Hem! Where is Miss Ashleigh? Indoors?”\r\n\r\n“No; somewhere in the grounds. But, my dear Dr. Fenwick, do not leave me\r\nyet; you are so very, very kind, and somehow I have grown to look upon\r\nyou quite as an old friend. Something has happened which has put me out,\r\nquite put me out.”\r\n\r\nShe said this wearily and feebly, closing her eyes as if she were indeed\r\nput out in the sense of extinguished.\r\n\r\n“The feeling of friendship you express,” said I, with earnestness, “is\r\nreciprocal. On my side it is accompanied by a peculiar gratitude. I am\r\na lonely man, by a lonely fireside, no parents, no near kindred, and in\r\nthis town, since Dr. Faber left it, without cordial intimacy till I knew\r\nyou. In admitting me so familiarly to your hearth, you have given me\r\nwhat I have never known before since I came to man’s estate,--a glimpse\r\nof the happy domestic life; the charm and relief to eye, heart, and\r\nspirit which is never known but in households cheered by the face of\r\nwoman. Thus my sentiment for you and yours is indeed that of an old\r\nfriend; and in any private confidence you show me, I feel as if I were\r\nno longer a lonely man, without kindred, without home.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashleigh seemed much moved by these words, which my heart had\r\nforced from my lips; and, after replying to me with simple unaffected\r\nwarmth of kindness, she rose, took my arm, and continued thus as we\r\nwalked slowly to and fro the lawn: “You know, perhaps, that my poor\r\nhusband left a sister, now a widow like myself, Lady Haughton.”\r\n\r\n“I remember that Mrs. Poyntz said you had such a sister-in-law, but I\r\nnever heard you mention Lady Haughton till now. Well!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Vigors has brought me a letter from her, and it is that which\r\nhas put me out. I dare say you have not heard me speak before of Lady\r\nHaughton, for I am ashamed to say I had almost forgotten her existence.\r\nShe is many years older than my husband was; of a very different\r\ncharacter. Only came once to see him after our marriage. Hurt me by\r\nridiculing him as a bookworm; offended him by looking a little down on\r\nme, as a nobody without spirit and fashion, which was quite true. And,\r\nexcept by a cold and unfeeling letter of formal condolence after I lost\r\nmy dear Gilbert, I have never heard from her since I have been a widow,\r\ntill to-day. But, after all, she is my poor husband’s sister, and his\r\neldest sister, and Lilian’s aunt; and, as Mr. Vigors says, ‘Duty is\r\nduty.’”\r\n\r\nHad Mrs. Ashleigh said “Duty is torture,” she could not have uttered the\r\nmaxim with more mournful and despondent resignation.\r\n\r\n“And what does this lady require of you, which Mr. Vigors deems it your\r\nduty to comply with?”\r\n\r\n“Dear me! What penetration! You have guessed the exact truth. But I\r\nthink you will agree with Mr. Vigors. Certainly I have no option; yes, I\r\nmust do it.”\r\n\r\n“My penetration is in fault now. Do what? Pray explain.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Lady Haughton, six months ago, lost her only son, Sir James. Mr.\r\nVigors says he was a very fine young man, of whom any mother would have\r\nbeen proud. I had heard he was wild; Mr. Vigors says, however, that he\r\nwas just going to reform, and marry a young lady whom his mother chose\r\nfor him, when, unluckily, he would ride a steeplechase, not being\r\nquite sober at the time, and broke his neck. Lady Haughton has been, of\r\ncourse, in great grief. She has retired to Brighton; and she wrote to me\r\nfrom thence, and Mr. Vigors brought the letter. He will go back to her\r\nto-day.”\r\n\r\n“Will go back to Lady Haughton? What! Has he been to her? Is he, then,\r\nas intimate with Lady Haughton as he was with her brother?”\r\n\r\n“No; but there has been a long and constant correspondence. She had a\r\nsettlement on the Kirby Estate,--a sum which was not paid off during\r\nGilbert’s life; and a very small part of the property went to Sir James,\r\nwhich part Mr. Ashleigh Sumner, the heir-at-law to the rest of the\r\nestate, wished Mr. Vigors, as his guardian, to buy during his minority,\r\nand as it was mixed up with Lady Haughton’s settlement her consent was\r\nnecessary as well as Sir James’s. So there was much negotiation, and,\r\nsince then, Ashleigh Sumner has come into the Haughton property, on poor\r\nSir James’s decease; so that complicated all affairs between Mr. Vigors\r\nand Lady Haughton, and he has just been to Brighton to see her. And\r\npoor Lady Haughton, in short, wants me and Lilian to go and visit her.\r\nI don’t like it at all. But you said the other day you thought sea air\r\nmight be good for Lilian during the heat of the summer, and she seems\r\nwell enough now for the change. What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“She is well enough, certainly. But Brighton is not the place I would\r\nrecommend for the summer; it wants shade, and is much hotter than L----”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but unluckily Lady Haughton foresaw that objection, and she has a\r\njointure-house some miles from Brighton, and near the sea. She says the\r\ngrounds are well wooded, and the place is proverbially cool and healthy,\r\nnot far from St. Leonard’s Forest. And, in short, I have written to say\r\nwe will come. So we must, unless, indeed, you positively forbid it.”\r\n\r\n“When do you think of going?”\r\n\r\n“Next Monday. Mr. Vigors would make me fix the day. If you knew how I\r\ndislike moving when I am once settled; and I do so dread Lady Haughton,\r\nshe is so fine, and so satirical! But Mr. Vigors says she is very much\r\naltered, poor thing! I should like to show you her letter, but I had\r\njust sent it to Margaret--Mrs. Poyntz--a minute or two before you came.\r\nShe knows something of Lady Haughton. Margaret knows everybody. And we\r\nshall have to go in mourning for poor Sir James, I suppose; and Margaret\r\nwill choose it, for I am sure I can’t guess to what extent we should\r\nbe supposed to mourn. I ought to have gone in mourning before--poor\r\nGilbert’s nephew--but I am so stupid, and I had never seen him. And--But\r\noh, this is kind! Margaret herself,--my dear Margaret!”\r\n\r\nWe had just turned away from the house, in our up-and-down walk; and\r\nMrs. Poyntz stood immediately fronting us. “So, Anne, you have actually\r\naccepted this invitation--and for Monday next?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Did I do wrong?”\r\n\r\n“What does Dr. Fenwick say? Can Lilian go with safety?”\r\n\r\nI could not honestly say she might not go with safety, but my heart sank\r\nlike lead as I answered,--\r\n\r\n“Miss Ashleigh does not now need merely medical care; but more than half\r\nher cure has depended on keeping her spirits free from depression. She\r\nmay miss the cheerful companionship of your daughter, and other young\r\nladies of her own age. A very melancholy house, saddened by a recent\r\nbereavement, without other guests; a hostess to whom she is a stranger,\r\nand whom Mrs. Ashleigh herself appears to deem formidable,--certainly\r\nthese do not make that change of scene which a physician would\r\nrecommend. When I spoke of sea air being good for Miss Ashleigh, I\r\nthought of our own northern coasts at a later time of the year, when\r\nI could escape myself for a few weeks and attend her. The journey to a\r\nnorthern watering-place would be also shorter and less fatiguing; the\r\nair there more invigorating.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt that would be better,” said Mrs. Poyntz, dryly; “but so far\r\nas your objections to visiting Lady Haughton have been stated, they\r\nare groundless. Her house will not be melancholy; she will have other\r\nguests, and Lilian will find companions, young like herself,--young\r\nladies--and young gentlemen too!”\r\n\r\nThere was something ominous, something compassionate, in the look which\r\nMrs. Poyntz cast upon me, in concluding her speech, which in itself was\r\ncalculated to rouse the fears of a lover. Lilian away from me, in\r\nthe house of a worldly-fine lady--such as I judged Lady Haughton to\r\nbe--surrounded by young gentlemen, as well as young ladies, by admirers,\r\nno doubt, of a higher rank and more brilliant fashion than she had yet\r\nknown! I closed my eyes, and with strong effort suppressed a groan.\r\n\r\n“My dear Annie, let me satisfy myself that Dr. Fenwick really does\r\nconsent to this journey. He will say to me what he may not to you.\r\nPardon me, then, if I take him aside for a few minutes. Let me find you\r\nhere again under this cedar-tree.”\r\n\r\nPlacing her arm in mine, and without waiting for Mrs. Ashleigh’s answer,\r\nMrs. Poyntz drew me into the more sequestered walk that belted the lawn;\r\nand when we were out of Mrs. Ashleigh’s sight and hearing, said,--\r\n\r\n“From what you have now seen of Lilian Ashleigh, do you still desire to\r\ngain her as your wife?”\r\n\r\n“Still? Oh, with an intensity proportioned to the fear with which I now\r\ndread that she is about to pass away from my eyes--from my life!”\r\n\r\n“Does your judgment confirm the choice of your heart? Reflect before you\r\nanswer.”\r\n\r\n“Such selfish judgment as I had before I knew her would not confirm\r\nbut oppose it. The nobler judgment that now expands all my reasonings,\r\napproves and seconds my heart. No, no; do not smile so sarcastically.\r\nThis is not the voice of a blind and egotistical passion. Let me\r\nexplain myself if I can. I concede to you that Lilian’s character is\r\nundeveloped; I concede to you, that amidst the childlike freshness and\r\ninnocence of her nature, there is at times a strangeness, a mystery,\r\nwhich I have not yet traced to its cause. But I am certain that the\r\nintellect is organically as sound as the heart, and that intellect and\r\nheart will ultimately--if under happy auspices--blend in that felicitous\r\nunion which constitutes the perfection of woman. But it is because\r\nshe does, and may for years, may perhaps always, need a more devoted,\r\nthoughtful care than natures less tremulously sensitive, that my\r\njudgment sanctions my choice; for whatever is best for her is best for\r\nme. And who would watch over her as I should?”\r\n\r\n“You have never yet spoken to Lilian as lovers speak?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, indeed.”\r\n\r\n“And, nevertheless, you believe that your affection would not be\r\nunreturned?”\r\n\r\n“I thought so once; I doubt now,--yet, in doubting, hope. But why do you\r\nalarm me with these questions? You, too, forebode that in this visit I\r\nmay lose her forever?”\r\n\r\n“If you fear that, tell her so, and perhaps her answer may dispel your\r\nfear.”\r\n\r\n“What! now, already, when she has scarcely known me a month. Might I not\r\nrisk all if too premature?”\r\n\r\n“There is no almanac for love. With many women love is born the moment\r\nthey know they are beloved. All wisdom tells us that a moment once gone\r\nis irrevocable. Were I in your place, I should feel that I approached a\r\nmoment that I must not lose. I have said enough; now I shall rejoin Mrs.\r\nAshleigh.”\r\n\r\n“Stay--tell me first what Lady Haughton’s letter really contains to\r\nprompt the advice with which you so transport, and yet so daunt, me when\r\nyou proffer it.”\r\n\r\n“Not now; later, perhaps,--not now. If you wish to see Lilian alone, she\r\nis by the Old Monk’s Well; I saw her seated there as I passed that way\r\nto the house.”\r\n\r\n“One word more,--only one. Answer this question frankly, for it is one\r\nof honour. Do you still believe that my suit to her daughter would not\r\nbe disapproved of by Mrs. Ashleigh?”\r\n\r\n“At this moment I am sure it would not; a week hence I might not give\r\nyou the same answer.”\r\n\r\nSo she passed on with her quick but measured tread, back through the\r\nshady walk, on to the open lawn, till the last glimpse of her pale gray\r\nrobe disappeared under the boughs of the cedar-tree. Then, with a\r\nstart, I broke the irresolute, tremulous suspense in which I had vainly\r\nendeavoured to analyze my own mind, solve my own doubts, concentrate my\r\nown will, and went the opposite way, skirting the circle of that haunted\r\nground,--as now, on one side its lofty terrace, the houses of the\r\nneighbouring city came full and close into view, divided from my\r\nfairy-land of life but by the trodden murmurous thoroughfare winding low\r\nbeneath the ivied parapets; and as now, again, the world of men abruptly\r\nvanished behind the screening foliage of luxuriant June.\r\n\r\nAt last the enchanted glade opened out from the verdure, its borders\r\nfragrant with syringa and rose and woodbine; and there, by the gray\r\nmemorial of the gone Gothic age, my eyes seemed to close their unquiet\r\nwanderings, resting spell-bound on that image which had become to me the\r\nincarnation of earth’s bloom and youth.\r\n\r\nShe stood amidst the Past, backed by the fragments of walls which man\r\nhad raised to seclude him from human passion, locking, under those lids\r\nso downcast, the secret of the only knowledge I asked from the boundless\r\nFuture.\r\n\r\nAh! what mockery there is in that grand word, the world’s fierce\r\nwar-cry,--Freedom! Who has not known one period of life, and that so\r\nsolemn that its shadows may rest over all life hereafter, when one\r\nhuman creature has over him a sovereignty more supreme and absolute than\r\nOrient servitude adores in the symbols of diadem and sceptre? What crest\r\nso haughty that has not bowed before a hand which could exalt or humble!\r\nWhat heart so dauntless that has not trembled to call forth the voice\r\nat whose sound open the gates of rapture or despair! That life alone is\r\nfree which rules, and suffices for itself. That life we forfeit when we\r\nlove!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nHow did I utter it? By what words did my heart make itself known? I\r\nremember not. All was as a dream that falls upon a restless, feverish\r\nnight, and fades away as the eyes unclose on the peace of a cloudless\r\nheaven, on the bliss of a golden sun. A new morrow seemed indeed upon\r\nthe earth when I woke from a life-long yesterday,--her dear hand in\r\nmine, her sweet face bowed upon my breast.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was that melodious silence in which there is no sound\r\naudible from without; yet within us there is heard a lulling celestial\r\nmusic, as if our whole being, grown harmonious with the universe, joined\r\nfrom its happy deeps in the hymn that unites the stars.\r\n\r\nIn that silence our two hearts seemed to make each other understood, to\r\nbe drawing nearer and nearer, blending by mysterious concord into the\r\ncompleteness of a solemn union, never henceforth to be rent asunder.\r\n\r\nAt length I said softly: “And it was here on this spot that I first saw\r\nyou,--here that I for the first time knew what power to change our world\r\nand to rule our future goes forth from the charm of a human face!”\r\n\r\nThen Lilian asked me timidly, and without lifting her eyes, how I had\r\nso seen her, reminding me that I promised to tell her, and had never yet\r\ndone so.\r\n\r\nAnd then I told her of the strange impulse that had led me into the\r\ngrounds, and by what chance my steps had been diverted down the path\r\nthat wound to the glade; how suddenly her form had shone upon my\r\neyes, gathering round itself the rose hues of the setting sun, and how\r\nwistfully those eyes had followed her own silent gaze into the distant\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nAs I spoke, her hand pressed mine eagerly, convulsively, and, raising\r\nher face from my breast, she looked at me with an intent, anxious\r\nearnestness. That look!--twice before it had thrilled and perplexed me.\r\n\r\n“What is there in that look, oh, my Lilian, which tells me that there\r\nis something that startles you,--something you wish to confide, and yet\r\nshrink from explaining? See how, already, I study the fair book from\r\nwhich the seal has been lifted! but as yet you must aid me to construe\r\nits language.”\r\n\r\n“If I shrink from explaining, it is only because I fear that I cannot\r\nexplain so as to be understood or believed. But you have a right to know\r\nthe secrets of a life which you would link to your own. Turn your face\r\naside from me; a reproving look, an incredulous smile, chill--oh, you\r\ncannot guess how they chill me, when I would approach that which to me\r\nis so serious and so solemnly strange.”\r\n\r\nI turned my face away, and her voice grew firmer as, after a brief\r\npause, she resumed,--\r\n\r\n“As far back as I can remember in my infancy, there have been moments\r\nwhen there seems to fall a soft hazy veil between my sight and the\r\nthings around it, thickening and deepening till it has the likeness\r\nof one of those white fleecy clouds which gather on the verge of the\r\nhorizon when the air is yet still, but the winds are about to rise; and\r\nthen this vapour or veil will suddenly open, as clouds open, and let in\r\nthe blue sky.”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” I said gently, for here she came to a stop. She continued,\r\nspeaking somewhat more hurriedly,--\r\n\r\n“Then, in that opening, strange appearances present them selves to\r\nme, as in a vision. In my childhood these were chiefly landscapes of\r\nwonderful beauty. I could but faintly describe them then; I could not\r\nattempt to describe them now, for they are almost gone from my memory.\r\nMy dear mother chid me for telling her what I saw, so I did not impress\r\nit on my mind by repeating it. As I grew up, this kind of vision--if\r\nI may so call it--became much less frequent, or much less distinct; I\r\nstill saw the soft veil fall, the pale cloud form and open, but often\r\nwhat may then have appeared was entirely forgotten when I recovered\r\nmyself, waking as from a sleep. Sometimes, however, the recollection\r\nwould be vivid and complete; sometimes I saw the face of my lost father;\r\nsometimes I heard his very voice, as I had seen and heard him in my\r\nearly childhood, when he would let me rest for hours beside him as he\r\nmused or studied, happy to be so quietly near him, for I loved him, oh,\r\nso dearly! and I remember him so distinctly, though I was only in my\r\nsixth year when he died. Much more recently--indeed, within the last few\r\nmonths--the images of things to come are reflected on the space that\r\nI gaze into as clearly as in a glass. Thus, for weeks before I came\r\nhither, or knew that such a place existed, I saw distinctly the old\r\nHouse, yon trees, this sward, this moss-grown Gothic fount; and, with\r\nthe sight, an impression was conveyed to me that in the scene before me\r\nmy old childlike life would pass into some solemn change. So that when I\r\ncame here, and recognized the picture in my vision, I took an affection\r\nfor the spot,--an affection not without awe, a powerful, perplexing\r\ninterest, as one who feels under the influence of a fate of which a\r\nprophetic glimpse has been vouchsafed. And in that evening, when you\r\nfirst saw me, seated here--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Lilian, on that evening--”\r\n\r\n“I saw you also, but in my vision--yonder, far in the deeps of\r\nspace,--and--and my heart was stirred as it had never been before; and\r\nnear where your image grew out from the cloud I saw my father’s face,\r\nand I heard his voice, not in my ear, but as in my heart, whispering--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Lilian--whispering--what?”\r\n\r\n“These words,--only these,--‘Ye will need one another.’ But then,\r\nsuddenly, between my upward eyes and the two forms they had beheld,\r\nthere rose from the earth, obscuring the skies, a vague, dusky vapour,\r\nundulous, and coiling like a vast serpent,--nothing, indeed, of its\r\nshape and figure definite, but of its face one abrupt glare; a flash\r\nfrom two dread luminous eyes, and a young head, like the Medusa’s,\r\nchanging, more rapidly than I could have drawn breath, into a grinning\r\nskull. Then my terror made me bow my head, and when I raised it again,\r\nall that I had seen was vanished. But the terror still remained, even\r\nwhen I felt my mother’s arm round me and heard her voice. And then, when\r\nI entered the house, and sat down again alone, the recollection of what\r\nI had seen--those eyes, that face, that skull--grew on me stronger and\r\nstronger till I fainted, and remember no more, until my eyes, opening,\r\nsaw you by my side, and in my wonder there was not terror. No, a sense\r\nof joy, protection, hope, yet still shadowed by a kind of fear or awe,\r\nin recognizing the countenance which had gleamed on me from the skies\r\nbefore the dark vapour had risen, and while my father’s voice had\r\nmurmured, ‘Ye will need one another.’ And now--and now--will you love\r\nme less that you know a secret in my being which I have told to no\r\nother,--cannot construe to myself? Only--only, at least, do not mock me;\r\ndo not disbelieve me! Nay, turn from me no longer now: now I ask to meet\r\nyour eyes. Now, before our hands can join again, tell me that you do not\r\ndespise me as untruthful, do not pity me as insane.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, hush!” I said, drawing her to my breast. “Of all you tell me\r\nwe will talk hereafter. The scales of our science have no weights fine\r\nenough for the gossamer threads of a maiden’s pure fancies. Enough for\r\nme--for us both--if out from all such illusions start one truth, told\r\nto you, lovely child, from the heavens; told to me, ruder man, on the\r\nearth; repeated by each pulse of this heart that woos you to hear and\r\nto trust,--now and henceforth through life unto death, ‘Each has need of\r\nthe other,’--I of you, I of you! my Lilian! my Lilian!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the previous assurance of Mrs. Poyntz, it was not without an\r\nuneasy apprehension that I approached the cedar-tree, under which Mrs.\r\nAshleigh still sat, her friend beside her. I looked on the fair creature\r\nwhose arm was linked in mine. So young, so singularly lovely, and with\r\nall the gifts of birth and fortune which bend avarice and ambition the\r\nmore submissively to youth and beauty, I felt as if I had wronged what a\r\nparent might justly deem her natural lot.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if your mother should disapprove!” said I, falteringly. Lilian\r\nleaned on my arm less lightly. “If I had thought so,” she said with her\r\nsoft blush, “should I be thus by your side?”\r\n\r\nSo we passed under the boughs of the dark tree, and Lilian left me and\r\nkissed Mrs. Ashleigh’s cheek; then, seating herself on the turf, laid\r\nher head on her mother’s lap. I looked on the Queen of the Hill, whose\r\nkeen eye shot over me. I thought there was a momentary expression of\r\npain or displeasure on her countenance; but it passed. Still\r\nthere seemed to me something of irony, as well as of triumph or\r\ncongratulation, in the half-smile with which she quitted her seat, and\r\nin the tone with which she whispered, as she glided by me to the open\r\nsward, “So, then, it is settled.”\r\n\r\nShe walked lightly and quickly down the lawn. When she was out of sight\r\nI breathed more freely. I took the seat which she had left, by Mrs.\r\nAshleigh’s side, and said, “A little while ago I spoke of myself as a\r\nman without kindred, without home, and now I come to you and ask for\r\nboth.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashleigh looked at me benignly, then raised her daughter’s face\r\nfrom her lap, and whispered, “Lilian;” and Lilian’s lips moved, but I\r\ndid not hear her answer. Her mother did. She took Lilian’s hand, simply\r\nplaced it in mine, and said, “As she chooses, I choose; whom she loves,\r\nI love.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nFrom that evening till the day Mrs. Ashleigh and Lilian went on the\r\ndreaded visit, I was always at their house, when my avocations allowed\r\nme to steal to it; and during those few days, the happiest I had ever\r\nknown, it seemed to me that years could not have more deepened my\r\nintimacy with Lilian’s exquisite nature, made me more reverential of its\r\npurity, or more enamoured of its sweetness. I could detect in her but\r\none fault, and I rebuked myself for believing that it was a fault.\r\nWe see many who neglect the minor duties of life, who lack watchful\r\nforethought and considerate care for others, and we recognize the\r\ncause of this failing in levity or egotism. Certainly, neither of those\r\ntendencies of character could be ascribed to Lilian. Yet still in daily\r\ntrifles there was something of that neglect, some lack of that care and\r\nforethought. She loved her mother with fondness and devotion, yet it\r\nnever occurred to her to aid in those petty household cares in which her\r\nmother centred so much of habitual interest. She was full of tenderness\r\nand pity to all want and suffering, yet many a young lady on the Hill\r\nwas more actively beneficent,--visiting the poor in their sickness, or\r\ninstructing their children in the Infant Schools. I was persuaded\r\nthat her love for me was deep and truthful; it was clearly void of all\r\nambition; doubtless she would have borne, unflinching and contented,\r\nwhatever the world considers to be a sacrifice and privation,--yet I\r\nshould never have expected her to take her share in the troubles\r\nof ordinary life. I could never have applied to her the homely but\r\nsignificant name of helpmate. I reproach myself while I write for\r\nnoticing such defect--if defect it were--in what may be called the\r\npractical routine of our positive, trivial, human existence. No doubt it\r\nwas this that had caused Mrs. Poyntz’s harsh judgment against the wisdom\r\nof my choice. But such chiller shade upon Lilian’s charming nature was\r\nreflected from no inert, unamiable self-love. It was but the consequence\r\nof that self-absorption which the habit of revery had fostered. I\r\ncautiously abstained from all allusion to those visionary deceptions,\r\nwhich she had confided to me as the truthful impressions of spirit, if\r\nnot of sense. To me any approach to what I termed “superstition” was\r\ndispleasing; any indulgence of fantasies not within the measured\r\nand beaten track of healthful imagination more than displeased me in\r\nher,--it alarmed. I would not by a word encourage her in persuasions\r\nwhich I felt it would be at present premature to reason against, and\r\ncruel indeed to ridicule. I was convinced that of themselves these\r\nmists round her native intelligence, engendered by a solitary and musing\r\nchildhood, would subside in the fuller daylight of wedded life. She\r\nseemed pained when she saw how resolutely I shunned a subject dear to\r\nher thoughts. She made one or two timid attempts to renew it, but\r\nmy grave looks sufficed to check her. Once or twice indeed, on such\r\noccasions, she would turn away and leave me, but she soon came back;\r\nthat gentle heart could not bear one unkindlier shade between itself\r\nand what it loved. It was agreed that our engagement should be, for the\r\npresent, confided only to Mrs. Poyntz. When Mrs. Ashleigh and Lilian\r\nreturned, which would be in a few weeks at furthest, it should be\r\nproclaimed; and our marriage could take place in the autumn, when I\r\nshould be most free for a brief holiday from professional toils.\r\n\r\nSo we parted-as lovers part. I felt none of those jealous fears\r\nwhich, before we were affianced, had made me tremble at the thought of\r\nseparation, and had conjured up irresistible rivals. But it was with a\r\nsettled, heavy gloom that I saw her depart. From earth was gone a glory;\r\nfrom life a blessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nDuring the busy years of my professional career, I had snatched leisure\r\nfor some professional treatises, which had made more or less sensation,\r\nand one of them, entitled “The Vital Principle; its Waste and Supply,”\r\n had gained a wide circulation among the general public. This last\r\ntreatise contained the results of certain experiments, then new in\r\nchemistry, which were adduced in support of a theory I entertained as to\r\nthe re-invigoration of the human system by principles similar to\r\nthose which Liebig has applied to the replenishment of an exhausted\r\nsoil,--namely, the giving back to the frame those essentials to its\r\nnutrition, which it has lost by the action or accident of time; or\r\nsupplying that special pabulum or energy in which the individual\r\norganism is constitutionally deficient; and neutralizing or\r\ncounterbalancing that in which it super-abounds,--a theory upon which\r\nsome eminent physicians have more recently improved with signal success.\r\nBut on these essays, slight and suggestive, rather than dogmatic, I set\r\nno value. I had been for the last two years engaged on a work of much\r\nwider range, endeared to me by a far bolder ambition,--a work upon which\r\nI fondly hoped to found an enduring reputation as a severe and\r\noriginal physiologist. It was an Inquiry into Organic Life, similar in\r\ncomprehensiveness of survey to that by which the illustrious Muller, of\r\nBerlin, has enriched the science of our age; however inferior, alas! to\r\nthat august combination of thought and learning in the judgment which\r\nchecks presumption, and the genius which adorns speculation. But at that\r\nday I was carried away by the ardour of composition, and I admired my\r\nperformance because I loved my labour. This work had been entirely laid\r\naside for the last agitated month; now that Lilian was gone, I resumed\r\nit earnestly, as the sole occupation that had power and charm enough to\r\nrouse me from the aching sense of void and loss.\r\n\r\nThe very night of the day she went, I reopened my manuscript. I had left\r\noff at the commencement of a chapter Upon Knowledge as derived from our\r\nSenses. As my convictions on this head were founded on the well-known\r\narguments of Locke and Condillac against innate ideas, and on the\r\nreasonings by which Hume has resolved the combination of sensations\r\ninto a general idea to an impulse arising merely out of habit, so I set\r\nmyself to oppose, as a dangerous concession to the sentimentalities or\r\nmysticism of a pseudo-philosophy, the doctrine favoured by most of our\r\nrecent physiologists, and of which some of the most eminent of German\r\nmetaphysicians have accepted the substance, though refining into a\r\nsubtlety its positive form,--I mean the doctrine which Muller himself\r\nhas expressed in these words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “That innate ideas may exist cannot in the slightest degree be denied:\r\n    it is, indeed, a fact.  All the ideas of animals, which are induced by\r\n    instinct, are innate and immediate: something presented to the mind, a\r\n    desire to attain which is at the same time given.  The new-born lamb\r\n    and foal have such innate ideas, which lead them to follow their\r\n    mother and suck the teats.  Is it not in some measure the same with\r\n    the intellectual ideas of man?” (1)\r\n\r\nTo this question I answered with an indignant “No!” A “Yes” would have\r\nshaken my creed of materialism to the dust. I wrote on rapidly, warmly.\r\nI defined the properties and meted the limits of natural laws, which I\r\nwould not admit that a Deity himself could alter. I clamped and soldered\r\ndogma to dogma in the links of my tinkered logic, till out from my page,\r\nto my own complacent eye, grew Intellectual Man, as the pure formation\r\nof his material senses; mind, or what is called soul, born from and\r\nnurtured by them alone; through them to act, and to perish with the\r\nmachine they moved. Strange, that at the very time my love for Lilian\r\nmight have taught me that there are mysteries in the core of the\r\nfeelings which my analysis of ideas could not solve, I should so\r\nstubbornly have opposed as unreal all that could be referred to the\r\nspiritual! Strange, that at the very time when the thought that I might\r\nlose from this life the being I had known scarce a month had just before\r\nso appalled me, I should thus complacently sit down to prove that,\r\naccording to the laws of the nature which my passion obeyed, I must\r\nlose for eternity the blessing I now hoped I had won to my life! But how\r\ndistinctly dissimilar is man in his conduct from man in his systems!\r\nSee the poet reclined under forest boughs, conning odes to his mistress;\r\nfollow him out into the world; no mistress ever lived for him there!(2)\r\nSee the hard man of science, so austere in his passionless problems;\r\nfollow him now where the brain rests from its toil, where the heart\r\nfinds its Sabbath--what child is so tender, so yielding, and soft?\r\n\r\nBut I had proved to my own satisfaction that poet and sage are dust,\r\nand no more, when the pulse ceases to beat. And on that consolatory\r\nconclusion my pen stopped.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, beside me I distinctly heard a sigh,--a compassionate,\r\nmournful sigh. The sound was unmistakable. I started from my seat,\r\nlooked round, amazed to discover no one,--no living thing! The windows\r\nwere closed, the night was still. That sigh was not the wail of the\r\nwind. But there, in the darker angle of the room, what was that? A\r\nsilvery whiteness, vaguely shaped as a human form, receding, fading,\r\ngone! Why, I know not--for no face was visible, no form, if form it\r\nwere, more distinct than the colourless outline,--why, I know not, but\r\nI cried aloud, “Lilian! Lilian!” My voice came strangely back to my own\r\near; I paused, then smiled and blushed at my folly. “So I, too, have\r\nlearned what is superstition,” I muttered to myself. “And here is an\r\nanecdote at my own expense (as Muller frankly tells us anecdotes of the\r\nillusions which would haunt his eyes, shut or open),--an anecdote I may\r\nquote when I come to my chapter on the Cheats of the Senses and Spectral\r\nPhantasms.” I went on with my book, and wrote till the lights waned in\r\nthe gray of the dawn. And I said then, in the triumph of my pride, as\r\nI laid myself down to rest, “I have written that which allots with\r\nprecision man’s place in the region of nature; written that which\r\nwill found a school, form disciples; and race after race of those\r\nwho cultivate truth through pure reason shall accept my bases if they\r\nenlarge my building.” And again I heard the sigh, but this time it\r\ncaused no surprise. “Certainly,” I murmured, “a very strange thing is\r\nthe nervous system!” So I turned on my pillow, and, wearied out, fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n(1) Muller’s “Elements of Physiology,” vol. ii. p. 134.

It was rarely indeed that persons\r\nso far from the town, when of no higher rank than this applicant, asked\r\nmy services.\r\n\r\nBut it was my principle to go wherever I was summoned; my profession\r\nwas not gain, it was healing, to which gain was the incident, not\r\nthe essential. This case the messenger reported as urgent. I went on\r\nhorseback, and rode fast; but swiftly as I cantered through the village\r\nthat skirted the approach to Sir Philip Derval’s park, the evident care\r\nbestowed on the accommodation of the cottagers forcibly struck me. I\r\nfelt that I was on the lands of a rich, intelligent, and beneficent\r\nproprietor. Entering the park, and passing before the manor-house, the\r\ncontrast between the neglect and the decay of the absentee’s stately\r\nHall and the smiling homes of his villagers was disconsolately mournful.\r\n\r\nAn imposing pile, built apparently by Vanbrugh, with decorated\r\npilasters, pompous portico, and grand perron (or double flight of stairs\r\nto the entrance), enriched with urns and statues, but discoloured,\r\nmildewed, chipped, half-hidden with unpruned creepers and ivy. Most of\r\nthe windows were closed with shutters, decaying for want of paint; in\r\nsome of the casements the panes were broken; the peacock perched on the\r\nshattered balustrade, that fenced a garden overgrown with weeds. The\r\nsun glared hotly on the place, and made its ruinous condition still more\r\npainfully apparent. I was glad when a winding in the park-road shut\r\nthe house from my sight. Suddenly I emerged through a copse of ancient\r\nyew-trees, and before me there gleamed, in abrupt whiteness, a building\r\nevidently designed for the family mausoleum, classical in its outline,\r\nwith the blind iron door niched into stone walls of massive thickness,\r\nand surrounded by a funereal garden of roses and evergreens, fenced with\r\nan iron rail, party-gilt.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness with which this House of the Dead came upon me heightened\r\nalmost into pain, if not into awe, the dismal impression which the\r\naspect of the deserted home in its neighbourhood had made. I spurred my\r\nhorse, and soon arrived at the door of my patient, who lived in a fair\r\nbrick house at the other extremity of the park.\r\n\r\nI found my patient, a man somewhat advanced in years, but of a robust\r\nconformation, in bed: he had been seized with a fit, which was supposed\r\nto be apoplectic, a few hours before; but was already sensible, and out\r\nof immediate danger. After I had prescribed a few simple remedies, I\r\ntook aside the patient’s wife, and went with her to the parlour below\r\nstairs, to make some inquiry about her husband’s ordinary regimen and\r\nhabits of life. These seemed sufficiently regular; I could discover no\r\napparent cause for the attack, which presented symptoms not familiar to\r\nmy experience. “Has your husband ever had such fits before?”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“Had he experienced any sudden emotion? Had he heard any unexpected\r\nnews; or had anything happened to put him out?”\r\n\r\nThe woman looked much disturbed at these inquiries. I pressed them more\r\nurgently. At last she burst into tears, and clasping my hand, said, “Oh,\r\ndoctor, I ought to tell you--I sent for you on purpose--yet I fear you\r\nwill not believe me: my good man has seen a ghost!”\r\n\r\n“A ghost!” said I, repressing a smile. “Well, tell me all, that I may\r\nprevent the ghost coming again.”\r\n\r\nThe woman’s story was prolix. Its substance was this. Her husband,\r\nhabitually an early riser, had left his bed that morning still earlier\r\nthan usual, to give directions about some cattle that were to be sent\r\nfor sale to a neighbouring fair. An hour afterwards he had been found by\r\na shepherd, near the mausoleum, apparently lifeless. On being removed to\r\nhis own house, he had recovered speech, and bidding all except his wife\r\nleave the room, he then told her that on walking across the park towards\r\nthe cattle-sheds, he had seen what appeared to him at first a pale light\r\nby the iron door of the mausoleum. On approaching nearer, this light\r\nchanged into the distinct and visible form of his master, Sir Philip\r\nDerval, who was then abroad,--supposed to be in the East, where he had\r\nresided for many years. The impression on the steward’s mind was so\r\nstrong, that he called out, “Oh, Sir Philip!” when looking still\r\nmore intently, he perceived that the face was that of a corpse. As he\r\ncontinued to gaze, the apparition seemed gradually to recede, as\r\nif vanishing into the sepulchre itself. He knew no more; he became\r\nunconscious. It was the excess of the poor woman’s alarm, on hearing\r\nthis strange tale, that made her resolve to send for me instead of the\r\nparish apothecary. She fancied so astounding a cause for her husband’s\r\nseizure could only be properly dealt with by some medical man reputed\r\nto have more than ordinary learning; and the steward himself objected to\r\nthe apothecary in the immediate neighbourhood, as more likely to annoy\r\nhim by gossip than a physician from a comparative distance.\r\n\r\nI took care not to lose the confidence of the good wife by parading too\r\nquickly my disbelief in the phantom her husband declared that he had\r\nseen; but as the story itself seemed at once to decide the nature of the\r\nfit to be epileptic, I began to tell her of similar delusions which, in\r\nmy experience, had occurred to those subjected to epilepsy, and\r\nfinally soothed her into the conviction that the apparition was clearly\r\nreducible to natural causes. Afterwards, I led her on to talk about\r\nSir Philip Derval, less from any curiosity I felt about the absent\r\nproprietor than from a desire to re-familiarize her own mind to his\r\nimage as a living man. The steward had been in the service of Sir\r\nPhilip’s father, and had known Sir Philip himself from a child. He was\r\nwarmly attached to his master, whom the old woman described as a man of\r\nrare benevolence and great eccentricity, which last she imputed to his\r\nstudious habits. He had succeeded to the title and estates as a minor.\r\nFor the first few years after attaining his majority, he had mixed much\r\nin the world. When at Derval Court his house had been filled with gay\r\ncompanions, and was the scene of lavish hospitality; but the estate\r\nwas not in proportion to the grandeur of the mansion, still less to the\r\nexpenditure of the owner. He had become greatly embarrassed; and some\r\nlove disappointment (so it was rumoured) occurring simultaneously with\r\nhis pecuniary difficulties, he had suddenly changed his way of life,\r\nshut himself up from his old friends, lived in seclusion, taking to\r\nbooks and scientific pursuits, and as the old woman said vaguely and\r\nexpressively, “to odd ways.” He had gradually by an economy that,\r\ntowards himself, was penurious, but which did not preclude much\r\njudicious generosity to others, cleared off his debts; and, once more\r\nrich, he had suddenly quitted the country, and taken to a life of\r\ntravel. He was now about forty-eight years old, and had been eighteen\r\nyears abroad. He wrote frequently to his steward, giving him minute and\r\nthoughtful instructions in regard to the employment, comforts, and homes\r\nof the peasantry, but peremptorily ordering him to spend no money on the\r\ngrounds and mansion, stating as a reason why the latter might be allowed\r\nto fall into decay, his intention to pull it down whenever he returned\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nI stayed some time longer than my engagements well warranted at my\r\npatient’s house, not leaving till the sufferer, after a quiet sleep, had\r\nremoved from his bed to his armchair, taken food, and seemed perfectly\r\nrecovered from his attack.\r\n\r\nRiding homeward, I mused on the difference that education makes, even\r\npathologically, between man and man. Here was a brawny inhabitant of\r\nrural fields, leading the healthiest of lives, not conscious of the\r\nfaculty we call imagination, stricken down almost to Death’s door by\r\nhis fright at an optical illusion, explicable, if examined, by the same\r\nsimple causes which had impressed me the night before with a moment’s\r\nbelief in a sound and a spectre,--me who, thanks to sublime education,\r\nwent so quietly to sleep a few minutes after, convinced that no phantom,\r\nthe ghostliest that ear ever heard or eye ever saw, can be anything else\r\nbut a nervous phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nThat evening I went to Mrs. Poyntz’s; it was one of her ordinary\r\n“reception nights,” and I felt that she would naturally expect my\r\nattendance as “a proper attention.”\r\n\r\nI joined a group engaged in general conversation, of which Mrs. Poyntz\r\nherself made the centre, knitting as usual,--rapidly while she talked,\r\nslowly when she listened.\r\n\r\nWithout mentioning the visit I had paid that morning, I turned the\r\nconversation on the different country places in the neighbourhood, and\r\nthen incidentally asked, “What sort of a man is Sir Philip Derval? Is it\r\nnot strange that he should suffer so fine a place to fall into decay?”\r\n The answers I received added little to the information I had already\r\nobtained. Mrs. Poyntz knew nothing of Sir Philip Derval, except as a man\r\nof large estates, whose rental had been greatly increased by a rise in\r\nthe value of property he possessed in the town of L----, and which lay\r\ncontiguous to that of her husband. Two or three of the older inhabitants\r\nof the Hill had remembered Sir Philip in his early days, when he was\r\ngay, high-spirited, hospitable, lavish. One observed that the only\r\nperson in L---- whom he had admitted to his subsequent seclusion was\r\nDr. Lloyd, who was then without practice, and whom he had employed as an\r\nassistant in certain chemical experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere a gentleman struck into the conversation. He was a stranger to\r\nme and to L----, a visitor to one of the dwellers on the Hill, who had\r\nasked leave to present him to its queen as a great traveller and an\r\naccomplished antiquary.\r\n\r\nSaid this gentleman: “Sir Philip Derval? I know him. I met him in the\r\nEast. He was then still, I believe, very fond of chemical science; a\r\nclever, odd, philanthropical man; had studied medicine, or at least\r\npractised it; was said to have made many marvellous cures. I became\r\nacquainted with him in Aleppo. He had come to that town, not much\r\nfrequented by English travellers, in order to inquire into the murder of\r\ntwo men, of whom one was his friend and the other his countryman.”\r\n\r\n“This is interesting,” said Mrs. Poyntz, dryly. “We who live on this\r\ninnocent Hill all love stories of crime; murder is the pleasantest\r\nsubject you could have hit on. Pray give us the details.”\r\n\r\n“So encouraged,” said the traveller, good-humouredly, “I will not\r\nhesitate to communicate the little I know. In Aleppo there had lived for\r\nsome years a man who was held by the natives in great reverence. He had\r\nthe reputation of extraordinary wisdom, but was difficult of access;\r\nthe lively imagination of the Orientals invested his character with\r\nthe fascinations of fable,--in short, Haroun of Aleppo was popularly\r\nconsidered a magician. Wild stories were told of his powers, of his\r\npreternatural age, of his hoarded treasures. Apart from such disputable\r\ntitles to homage, there seemed no question, from all I heard, that his\r\nlearning was considerable, his charities extensive, his manner of life\r\nirreproachably ascetic. He appears to have resembled those Arabian sages\r\nof the Gothic age to whom modern science is largely indebted,--a mystic\r\nenthusiast, but an earnest scholar. A wealthy and singular Englishman,\r\nlong resident in another part of the East, afflicted by some languishing\r\ndisease, took a journey to Aleppo to consult this sage, who, among\r\nhis other acquirements, was held to have discovered rare secrets in\r\nmedicine,--his countrymen said in ‘charms.’ One morning, not long after\r\nthe Englishman’s arrival, Haroun was found dead in his bed, apparently\r\nstrangled, and the Englishman, who lodged in another part of the town,\r\nhad disappeared; but some of his clothes, and a crutch on which he\r\nhabitually supported himself, were found a few miles distant from\r\nAleppo, near the roadside. There appeared no doubt that he, too, had\r\nbeen murdered, but his corpse could not be discovered. Sir Philip Derval\r\nhad been a loving disciple of this Sage of Aleppo, to whom he assured me\r\nhe owed not only that knowledge of medicine which, by report, Sir\r\nPhilip possessed, but the insight into various truths of nature, on the\r\npromulgation of which, it was evident, Sir Philip cherished the ambition\r\nto found a philosophical celebrity for himself.”\r\n\r\n“Of what description were those truths of nature?” I asked, somewhat\r\nsarcastically.\r\n\r\n“Sir, I am unable to tell you, for Sir Philip did not inform me, nor\r\ndid I much care to ask; for what may be revered as truths in Asia are\r\nusually despised as dreams in Europe. To return to my story: Sir\r\nPhilip had been in Aleppo a little time before the murder; had left the\r\nEnglishman under the care of Haroun. He returned to Aleppo on hearing\r\nthe tragic events I have related, and was busy in collecting such\r\nevidence as could be gleaned, and instituting inquiries after our\r\nmissing countryman at the time I myself chanced to arrive in the city.\r\nI assisted in his researches, but without avail. The assassins remained\r\nundiscovered. I do not myself doubt that they were mere vulgar robbers.\r\nSir Philip had a darker suspicion of which he made no secret to me; but\r\nas I confess that I thought the suspicion groundless, you will pardon\r\nme if I do not repeat it. Whether since I left the East the Englishman’s\r\nremains have been discovered, I know not. Very probably; for I\r\nunderstand that his heirs have got hold of what fortune he left,--less\r\nthan was generally supposed. But it was reported that he had buried\r\ngreat treasures, a rumour, however absurd, not altogether inconsistent\r\nwith his character.”\r\n\r\n“What was his character?” asked Mrs. Poyntz.\r\n\r\n“One of evil and sinister repute. He was regarded with terror by the\r\nattendants who had accompanied him to Aleppo. But he had lived in a\r\nvery remote part of the East, little known to Europeans, and, from all I\r\ncould learn, had there established an extraordinary power, strengthened\r\nby superstitious awe. He was said to have studied deeply that knowledge\r\nwhich the philosophers of old called ‘occult,’ not, like the Sage\r\nof Aleppo, for benevolent, but for malignant ends. He was accused of\r\nconferring with evil spirits, and filling his barbaric court (for\r\nhe lived in a kind of savage royalty) with charmers and sorcerers. I\r\nsuspect, after all, that he was only, like myself, an ardent antiquary,\r\nand cunningly made use of the fear he inspired in order to secure his\r\nauthority, and prosecute in safety researches into ancient sepulchres or\r\ntemples. His great passion was, indeed, in excavating such remains, in\r\nhis neighbourhood; with what result I know not, never having penetrated\r\nso far into regions infested by robbers and pestiferous with malaria. He\r\nwore the Eastern dress, and always carried jewels about him. I came\r\nto the conclusion that for the sake of these jewels he was murdered,\r\nperhaps by some of his own servants (and, indeed, two at least of his\r\nsuite were missing), who then at once buried his body, and kept their\r\nown secret. He was old, very infirm; could never have got far from the\r\ntown without assistance.”\r\n\r\n“You have not yet told us his name,” said Mrs. Poyntz.\r\n\r\n“His name was Grayle.”\r\n\r\n“Grayle!” exclaimed Mrs. Poyntz, dropping her work. “Louis Grayle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; Louis Grayle. You could not have known him?”\r\n\r\n“Known him! No; but I have often heard my father speak of him. Such,\r\nthen, was the tragic end of that strong dark creature, for whom, as a\r\nyoung girl in the nursery, I used to feel a kind of fearful admiring\r\ninterest?”\r\n\r\n“It is your turn to narrate now,” said the traveller.\r\n\r\nAnd we all drew closer round our hostess, who remained silent some\r\nmoments, her brow thoughtful, her work suspended.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said she at last, looking round us with a lofty air, which\r\nseemed half defying, “force and courage are always fascinating, even\r\nwhen they are quite in the wrong. I go with the world, because the world\r\ngoes with me; if it did not--” Here she stopped for a moment, clenched\r\nthe firm white hand, and then scornfully waved it, left the sentence\r\nunfinished, and broke into another.\r\n\r\n“Going with the world, of course we must march over those who stand\r\nagainst it. But when one man stands single-handed against our march, we\r\ndo not despise him; it is enough to crush. I am very glad I did not see\r\nLouis Grayle when I was a girl of sixteen.” Again she paused a moment,\r\nand resumed: “Louis Grayle was the only son of a usurer, infamous for\r\nthe rapacity with which he had acquired enormous wealth. Old Grayle\r\ndesired to rear his heir as a gentleman; sent him to Eton. Boys are\r\nalways aristocratic; his birth was soon thrown in his teeth; he was\r\nfierce; he struck boys bigger than himself,--fought till he was\r\nhalf killed. My father was at school with him; described him as\r\na tiger-whelp. One day he--still a fag--struck a sixth-form boy.\r\nSixth-form boys do not fight fags; they punish them. Louis Grayle was\r\nordered to hold out his hand to the cane; he received the blow, drew\r\nforth his schoolboy knife, and stabbed the punisher. After that, he left\r\nEton. I don’t think he was publicly expelled--too mere a child for that\r\nhonour--but he was taken or sent away; educated with great care under\r\nthe first masters at home. When he was of age to enter the University,\r\nold Grayle was dead. Louis was sent by his guardians to Cambridge, with\r\nacquirements far exceeding the average of young men, and with unlimited\r\ncommand of money. My father was at the same college, and described him\r\nagain,--haughty, quarrelsome, reckless, handsome, aspiring, brave.\r\nDoes that kind of creature interest you, my dears?” (appealing to the\r\nladies).\r\n\r\n“La!” said Miss Brabazon; “a horrid usurer’s son!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, true; the vulgar proverb says it is good to be born with a silver\r\nspoon in one’s mouth: so it is when one has one’s own family crest on\r\nit; but when it is a spoon on which people recognize their family\r\ncrest, and cry out, ‘Stolen from our plate chest,’ it is a heritage that\r\noutlaws a babe in his cradle. However, young men at college who want\r\nmoney are less scrupulous about descent than boys at Eton are. Louis\r\nGrayle found, while at college, plenty of wellborn acquaintances willing\r\nto recover from him some of the plunder his father had extorted from\r\ntheirs. He was too wild to distinguish himself by academical honours,\r\nbut my father said that the tutors of the college declared there were\r\nnot six undergraduates in the University who knew as much hard and dry\r\nscience as wild Louis Grayle. He went into the world, no doubt, hoping\r\nto shine; but his father’s name was too notorious to admit the son into\r\ngood society. The Polite World, it is true, does not examine a scutcheon\r\nwith the nice eye of a herald, nor look upon riches with the stately\r\ncontempt of a stoic; still the Polite World has its family pride and\r\nits moral sentiment. It does not like to be cheated,--I mean, in\r\nmoney matters; and when the son of a man who has emptied its purse and\r\nforeclosed on its acres rides by its club-windows, hand on haunch, and\r\nhead in the air, no lion has a scowl more awful, no hyena a laugh more\r\ndread, than that same easy, good-tempered, tolerant, polite, well-bred\r\nWorld which is so pleasant an acquaintance, so languid a friend, and--so\r\nremorseless an--enemy. In short, Louis Grayle claimed the right to be\r\ncourted,--he was shunned; to be admired,--he was loathed. Even his old\r\ncollege acquaintances were shamed out of knowing him. Perhaps he\r\ncould have lived through all this had he sought to glide quietly into\r\nposition; but he wanted the tact of the well-bred, and strove to storm\r\nhis way, not to steal it. Reduced for companions to needy parasites,\r\nhe braved and he shocked all decorous opinion by that ostentation of\r\nexcess, which made Richelieus and Lauzuns the rage. But then Richelieus\r\nand Lauzuns were dukes! He now very naturally took the Polite World into\r\nhate,--gave it scorn for scorn. He would ally himself with Democracy;\r\nhis wealth could not get him into a club, but it would buy him into\r\nparliament; he could not be a Lauzun, nor, perhaps, a Mirabeau, but he\r\nmight be a Danton. He had plenty of knowledge and audacity, and with\r\nknowledge and audacity a good hater is sure to be eloquent. Possibly,\r\nthen, this poor Louis Grayle might have made a great figure, left his\r\nmark on his age and his name in history; but in contesting the borough,\r\nwhich he was sure to carry, he had to face an opponent in a real fine\r\ngentleman whom his father had ruined, cool and highbred, with a tongue\r\nlike a rapier, a sneer like an adder. A quarrel of course; Louis Grayle\r\nsent a challenge. The fine gentleman, known to be no coward (fine\r\ngentlemen never are), was at first disposed to refuse with contempt. But\r\nGrayle had made himself the idol of the mob; and at a word from Grayle,\r\nthe fine gentleman might have been ducked at a pump, or tossed in\r\na blanket,--that would have made him ridiculous; to be shot at is a\r\ntrifle, to be laughed at is serious. He therefore condescended to accept\r\nthe challenge, and my father was his second.\r\n\r\n“It was settled, of course, according to English custom, that both\r\ncombatants should fire at the same time, and by signal. The antagonist\r\nfired at the right moment; his ball grazed Louis Grayle’s temple. Louis\r\nGrayle had not fired. He now seemed to the seconds to take slow and\r\ndeliberate aim. They called out to him not to fire; they were rushing to\r\nprevent him, when the trigger was pulled, and his opponent fell dead on\r\nthe field. The fight was, therefore, considered unfair; Louis Grayle was\r\ntried for his life: he did not stand the trial in person.(1) He escaped\r\nto the Continent; hurried on to some distant uncivilized lands; could\r\nnot be traced; reappeared in England no more. The lawyer who conducted\r\nhis defence pleaded skilfully. He argued that the delay in firing was\r\nnot intentional, therefore not criminal,--the effect of the stun which\r\nthe wound in the temple had occasioned. The judge was a gentleman, and\r\nsummed up the evidence so as to direct the jury to a verdict against\r\nthe low wretch who had murdered a gentleman; but the jurors were not\r\ngentlemen, and Grayle’s advocate had of course excited their sympathy\r\nfor a son of the people, whom a gentleman had wantonly insulted. The\r\nverdict was manslaughter; but the sentence emphatically marked the\r\naggravated nature of the homicide,--three years’ imprisonment. Grayle\r\neluded the prison, but he was a man disgraced and an exile,--his\r\nambition blasted, his career an outlaw’s, and his age not yet\r\ntwenty-three. My father said that he was supposed to have changed his\r\nname; none knew what had become of him. And so this creature, brilliant\r\nand daring, whom if born under better auspices we might now be all\r\nfawning on, cringing to,--after living to old age, no one knows\r\nhow,--dies murdered at Aleppo, no one, you say, knows by whom.”\r\n\r\n“I saw some account of his death in the papers about three years ago,”\r\n said one of the party; “but the name was misspelled, and I had no idea\r\nthat it was the same man who had fought the duel which Mrs. Colonel\r\nPoyntz has so graphically described. I have a very vague recollection of\r\nthe trial; it took place when I was a boy, more than forty years since.\r\nThe affair made a stir at the time, but was soon forgotten.”\r\n\r\n“Soon forgotten,” said Mrs. Poyntz; “ay, what is not? Leave your place\r\nin the world for ten minutes, and when you come back somebody else has\r\ntaken it; but when you leave the world for good, who remembers that you\r\nhad ever a place even in the parish register?”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said I, “a great poet has said, finely and truly,\r\n\r\n\r\n   “‘The sun of Homer shines upon us still.’”\r\n\r\n“But it does not shine upon Homer; and learned folks tell me that we\r\nknow no more who and what Homer was, if there was ever a single Homer\r\nat all, or rather, a whole herd of Homers, than we know about the man in\r\nthe moon,--if there be one man there, or millions of men. Now, my dear\r\nMiss Brabazon, it will be very kind in you to divert our thoughts\r\ninto channels less gloomy. Some pretty French air--Dr. Fenwick, I have\r\nsomething to say to you.” She drew me towards the window. “So Annie\r\nAshleigh writes me word that I am not to mention your engagement. Do you\r\nthink it quite prudent to keep it a secret?”\r\n\r\n“I do not see how prudence is concerned in keeping it secret one way or\r\nthe other,--it is a mere matter of feeling. Most people wish to abridge,\r\nas far as they can, the time in which their private arrangements are the\r\ntopic of public gossip.”\r\n\r\n“Public gossip is sometimes the best security for the due completion of\r\nprivate arrangements. As long as a girl is not known to be engaged,\r\nher betrothed must be prepared for rivals. Announce the engagement, and\r\nrivals are warned off.”\r\n\r\n“I fear no rivals.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not? Bold man! I suppose you will write to Lilian?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, and constantly. By-the-way, Mrs. Ashleigh, before she went,\r\nasked me to send her back Lady Haughton’s letter of invitation. What\r\nfor,--to show to you?”\r\n\r\n“Very likely. Have you the letter still? May I see it?”\r\n\r\n“Not just at present. When Lilian or Mrs. Ashleigh writes to you, come\r\nand tell me how they like their visit, and what other guests form the\r\nparty.”\r\n\r\nTherewith she turned away and conversed apart with the traveller.\r\n\r\nHer words disquieted me, and I felt that they were meant to do so,\r\nwherefore I could not guess. But there is no language on earth which has\r\nmore words with a double meaning than that spoken by the Clever Woman,\r\nwho is never so guarded as when she appears to be frank.\r\n\r\nAs I walked home thoughtfully, I was accosted by a young man, the son\r\nof one of the wealthiest merchants in the town. I had attended him with\r\nsuccess some months before, in a rheumatic fever: he and his family were\r\nmuch attached to me.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear Fenwick, I am so glad to see you; I owe you an\r\nobligation of which you are not aware,--an exceedingly pleasant\r\ntravelling-companion. I came with him to-day from London, where I have\r\nbeen sight-seeing and holidaymaking for the last fortnight.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you mean that you kindly bring me a patient?”\r\n\r\n“No, only an admirer. I was staying at Fenton’s Hotel. It so happened\r\none day that I had left in the coffee-room your last work on the Vital\r\nPrinciple, which, by the by, the bookseller assures me is selling\r\nimmensely among readers as non-professional as myself. Coming into the\r\ncoffee-room again, I found a gentleman reading the book. I claimed it\r\npolitely; he as politely tendered his excuse for taking it. We made\r\nacquaintance on the spot. The next day we were intimate. He expressed\r\ngreat interest and curiosity about your theory and your experiments. I\r\ntold him I knew you. You may guess if I described you as less clever in\r\nyour practice than you are in your writings; and, in short, he came\r\nwith me to L----, partly to see our flourishing town, principally on my\r\npromise to introduce him to you. My mother, you know, has what she calls\r\na dejeuner tomorrow,--dejeuner and dance. You will be there?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you for reminding me of her invitation. I will avail myself of\r\nit if I can. Your new friend will be present? Who and what is he,--a\r\nmedical student?”\r\n\r\n“No, a mere gentleman at ease, but seems to have a good deal of general\r\ninformation. Very young, apparently very rich, wonderfully good-looking.\r\nI am sure you will like him; everybody must.”\r\n\r\n“It is quite enough to prepare me to like him that he is a friend of\r\nyours.” And so we shook hands and parted.\r\n\r\n(1) Mrs. Poyntz here makes a mistake in law which, though very evident,\r\nher listeners do not seem to have noticed. Her mistake will be referred\r\nto later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon of the following day before I was able to\r\njoin the party assembled at the merchant’s house; it was a villa about\r\ntwo miles out of the town, pleasantly situated amidst flower-gardens\r\ncelebrated in the neighbourhood for their beauty. The breakfast had been\r\nlong over; the company was scattered over the lawn,--some formed into\r\na dance on the smooth lawn; some seated under shady awnings; others\r\ngliding amidst parterres, in which all the glow of colour took a glory\r\nyet more vivid under the flush of a brilliant sunshine; and the ripple\r\nof a soft western breeze. Music, loud and lively, mingled with the\r\nlaughter of happy children, who formed much the larger number of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nStanding at the entrance of an arched trellis, that led from the hardier\r\nflowers of the lawn to a rare collection of tropical plants under a\r\nlofty glass dome (connecting, as it were, the familiar vegetation of the\r\nNorth with that of the remotest East), was a form that instantaneously\r\ncaught and fixed my gaze. The entrance of the arcade was covered with\r\nparasite creepers, in prodigal luxuriance, of variegated gorgeous\r\ntints,--scarlet, golden, purple; and the form, an idealized picture of\r\nman’s youth fresh from the hand of Nature, stood literally in a frame of\r\nblooms.\r\n\r\nNever have I seen human face so radiant as that young man’s. There was\r\nin the aspect an indescribable something that literally dazzled. As one\r\ncontinued to gaze, it was with surprise; one was forced to acknowledge\r\nthat in the features themselves there was no faultless regularity; nor\r\nwas the young man’s stature imposing, about the middle height. But the\r\neffect of the whole was not less transcendent. Large eyes, unspeakably\r\nlustrous; a most harmonious colouring; an expression of contagious\r\nanimation and joyousness; and the form itself so critically fine, that\r\nthe welded strength of its sinews was best shown in the lightness and\r\ngrace of its movements.\r\n\r\nHe was resting one hand carelessly on the golden locks of a child that\r\nhad nestled itself against his knees, looking up to his face in that\r\nsilent loving wonder with which children regard something too strangely\r\nbeautiful for noisy admiration; he himself was conversing with the\r\nhost, an old gray-haired, gouty man, propped on his crutched stick, and\r\nlistening with a look of mournful envy. To the wealth of the old man all\r\nthe flowers in that garden owed their renewed delight in the summer\r\nair and sun. Oh, that his wealth could renew to himself one hour of the\r\nyouth whose incarnation stood beside him, Lord, indeed, of Creation; its\r\nsplendour woven into his crown of beauty, its enjoyments subject to his\r\nsceptre of hope and gladness.\r\n\r\nI was startled by the hearty voice of the merchant’s son. “Ah, my dear\r\nFenwick, I was afraid you would not come,--you are late. There is\r\nthe new friend of whom I spoke to you last night; let me now make you\r\nacquainted with him.” He drew my arm in his, and led me up to the\r\nyoung man, where he stood under the arching flowers, and whom he then\r\nintroduced to me by the name of Margrave.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more frankly cordial than Mr. Margrave’s manner. In a\r\nfew minutes I found myself conversing with him familiarly, as if we\r\nhad been reared in the same home, and sported together in the same\r\nplayground. His vein of talk was peculiar, off-hand, careless, shifting\r\nfrom topic to topic with a bright rapidity.\r\n\r\nHe said that he liked the place; proposed to stay in it some weeks;\r\nasked my address, which I gave to him; promised to call soon at an\r\nearly hour, while my time was yet free from professional visits. I\r\nendeavoured, when I went away, to analyze to myself the fascination\r\nwhich this young stranger so notably exercised over all who approached\r\nhim; and it seemed to me, ever seeking to find material causes for all\r\nmoral effects, that it rose from the contagious vitality of that rarest\r\nof all rare gifts in highly-civilized circles,--perfect health; that\r\nhealth which is in itself the most exquisite luxury; which, finding\r\nhappiness in the mere sense of existence, diffuses round it, like an\r\natmosphere, the harmless hilarity of its bright animal being. Health,\r\nto the utmost perfection, is seldom known after childhood; health to the\r\nutmost cannot be enjoyed by those who overwork the brain, or admit the\r\nsure wear and tear of the passions. The creature I had just seen gave\r\nme the notion of youth in the golden age of the poets,--the youth of the\r\ncareless Arcadian, before nymph or shepherdess had vexed his heart with\r\na sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe house I occupied at L---- was a quaint, old-fashioned building, a\r\ncorner-house. One side, in which was the front entrance, looked upon\r\na street which, as there were no shops in it, and it was no direct\r\nthoroughfare to the busy centres of the town, was always quiet, and\r\nat some hours of the day almost deserted. The other side of the house\r\nfronted a lane; opposite to it was the long and high wall of the garden\r\nto a Young Ladies’ Boarding-school. My stables adjoined the house,\r\nabutting on a row of smaller buildings, with little gardens before them,\r\nchiefly occupied by mercantile clerks and retired tradesmen. By the lane\r\nthere was a short and ready access both to the high turnpike-road, and\r\nto some pleasant walks through green meadows and along the banks of a\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThis house I had inhabited since my arrival at L----, and it had to\r\nme so many attractions, in a situation sufficiently central to be\r\nconvenient for patients, and yet free from noise, and favourable to\r\nready outlet into the country for such foot or horse exercise as my\r\nprofessional avocations would allow me to carve for myself out of what\r\nthe Latin poet calls the “solid day,” that I had refused to change it\r\nfor one better suited to my increased income; but it was not a house\r\nwhich Mrs. Ashleigh would have liked for Lilian. The main objection to\r\nit in the eyes of the “genteel” was, that it had formerly belonged to a\r\nmember of the healing profession who united the shop of an apothecary\r\nto the diploma of a surgeon; but that shop had given the house a special\r\nattraction to me; for it had been built out on the side of the house\r\nwhich fronted the lane, occupying the greater portion of a small gravel\r\ncourt, fenced from the road by a low iron palisade, and separated\r\nfrom the body of the house itself by a short and narrow corridor that\r\ncommunicated with the entrance-hall. This shop I turned into a rude\r\nstudy for scientific experiments, in which I generally spent some early\r\nhours of the morning, before my visiting patients began to arrive. I\r\nenjoyed the stillness of its separation from the rest of the house; I\r\nenjoyed the glimpse of the great chestnut-trees, which overtopped the\r\nwall of the school-garden; I enjoyed the ease with which, by opening the\r\nglazed sash-door, I could get out, if disposed for a short walk, into\r\nthe pleasant fields; and so completely had I made this sanctuary my own,\r\nthat not only my man-servant knew that I was never to be disturbed when\r\nin it, except by the summons of a patient, but even the housemaid\r\nwas forbidden to enter it with broom or duster, except upon special\r\ninvitation. The last thing at night, before retiring to rest, it was the\r\nman-servant’s business to see that the sash-window was closed, and the\r\ngate to the iron palisade locked; but during the daytime I so often went\r\nout of the house by that private way that the gate was then very seldom\r\nlocked, nor the sash-door bolted from within. In the town of L----\r\nthere was little apprehension of house-robberies,--especially in the\r\ndaylight,--and certainly in this room, cut off from the main\r\nbuilding, there was nothing to attract a vulgar cupidity. A few of the\r\napothecary’s shelves and cases still remained on the walls, with, here\r\nand there, a bottle of some chemical preparation for experiment; two or\r\nthree worm-eaten, wooden chairs; two or three shabby old tables; an\r\nold walnut-tree bureau without a lock, into which odds and ends were\r\nconfusedly thrust, and sundry ugly-looking inventions of mechanical\r\nscience, were, assuredly, not the articles which a timid proprietor\r\nwould guard with jealous care from the chances of robbery. It will be\r\nseen later why I have been thus prolix in description. The morning after\r\nI had met the young stranger by whom I had been so favourably impressed,\r\nI was up as usual, a little before the sun, and long before any of my\r\nservants were astir. I went first into the room I have mentioned, and\r\nwhich I shall henceforth designate as my study, opened the window,\r\nunlocked the gate, and sauntered for some minutes up and down the silent\r\nlane skirting the opposite wall, and overhung by the chestnut-trees\r\nrich in the garniture of a glorious summer; then, refreshed for work,\r\nI re-entered my study, and was soon absorbed in the examination of\r\nthat now well-known machine, which was then, to me at least, a\r\nnovelty,--invented, if I remember right, by Dubois-Reymond, so\r\ndistinguished by his researches into the mysteries of organic\r\nelectricity. It is a wooden cylinder fixed against the edge of a table;\r\non the table two vessels filled with salt and water are so placed that,\r\nas you close your hands on the cylinder, the forefinger of each hand\r\ncan drop into the water; each of the vessels has a metallic plate,\r\nand communicates by wires with a galvanometer with its needle. Now the\r\ntheory is, that if you clutch the cylinder firmly with the right hand,\r\nleaving the left perfectly passive, the needle in the galvanometer will\r\nmove from west to south; if, in like manner, you exert the left arm,\r\nleaving the right arm passive, the needle will deflect from west to\r\nnorth. Hence, it is argued that the electric current is induced through\r\nthe agency of the nervous system, and that, as human Will produces the\r\nmuscular contraction requisite, so is it human Will that causes\r\nthe deflection of the needle. I imagine that if this theory were\r\nsubstantiated by experiment, the discovery might lead to some sublime\r\nand unconjectured secrets of science. For human Will, thus actively\r\neffective on the electric current, and all matter, animate or inanimate,\r\nhaving more or less of electricity, a vast field became opened to\r\nconjecture. By what series of patient experimental deduction might not\r\nscience arrive at the solution of problems which the Newtonian law of\r\ngravitation does not suffice to solve; and--But here I halt. At the\r\ndate which my story has reached, my mind never lost itself long in the\r\nCloudland of Guess.\r\n\r\nI was dissatisfied with my experiment. The needle stirred, indeed,\r\nbut erratically, and not in directions which, according to the theory,\r\nshould correspond to my movement. I was about to dismiss the trial with\r\nsome uncharitable contempt of the foreign philosopher’s dogmas, when\r\nI heard a loud ring at my street-door. While I paused to conjecture\r\nwhether my servant was yet up to attend to the door, and which of my\r\npatients was the most likely to summon me at so unseasonable an hour,\r\na shadow darkened my window. I looked up, and to my astonishment beheld\r\nthe brilliant face of Mr. Margrave. The sash to the door was already\r\npartially opened; he raised it higher, and walked into the room. “Was it\r\nyou who rang at the street-door, and at this hour?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and observing, after I had rung, that all the shutters were still\r\nclosed, I felt ashamed of my own rash action, and made off rather than\r\nbrave the reproachful face of some injured housemaid, robbed of her\r\nmorning dreams. I turned down that pretty lane,--lured by the green\r\nof the chestnut-trees,--caught sight of you through the window, took\r\ncourage, and here I am! You forgive me?” While thus speaking, he\r\ncontinued to move along the littered floor of the dingy room, with the\r\nundulating restlessness of some wild animal in the confines of its den,\r\nand he now went on, in short fragmentary sentences, very slightly linked\r\ntogether, but smoothed, as it were, into harmony by a voice musical and\r\nfresh as a sky lark’s warble. “Morning dreams, indeed! dreams that waste\r\nthe life of such a morning. Rosy magnificence of a summer dawn! Do you\r\nnot pity the fool who prefers to lie a bed, and to dream rather than to\r\nlive? What! and you, strong man, with those noble limbs, in this den! Do\r\nyou not long for a rush through the green of the fields, a bath in the\r\nblue of the river?”\r\n\r\nHere he came to a pause, standing, still in the gray light of the\r\ngrowing day, with eyes whose joyous lustre forestalled the sun’s, and\r\nlips which seemed to laugh even in repose.\r\n\r\nBut presently those eyes, as quick as they were bright, glanced over the\r\nwalls, the floor, the shelves, the phials, the mechanical inventions,\r\nand then rested full on my cylinder fixed to the table. He approached,\r\nexamined it curiously, asked what it was. I explained. To gratify him\r\nI sat down and renewed my experiment, with equally ill success. The\r\nneedle, which should have moved from west to south, describing an angle\r\nof from thirty degrees to forty or even fifty degrees, only made a few\r\ntroubled, undecided oscillations.\r\n\r\n“Tut,” cried the young man, “I see what it is; you have a wound in your\r\nright hand.”\r\n\r\nThat was true; I had burned my band a few days before in a chemical\r\nexperiment, and the sore had not healed.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, “and what does that matter?”\r\n\r\n“Everything; the least scratch in the skin of the hand produces chemical\r\nactions on the electric current, independently of your will. Let me\r\ntry.”\r\n\r\nHe took my place, and in a moment the needle in the galvanometer\r\nresponded to his grasp on the cylinder, exactly as the inventive\r\nphilosopher had stated to be the due result of the experiment.\r\n\r\nI was startled.\r\n\r\n“But how came you, Mr. Margrave, to be so well acquainted with a\r\nscientific process little known, and but recently discovered?”\r\n\r\n“I well acquainted! not so. But I am fond of all experiments that relate\r\nto animal life. Electricity, especially, is full of interest.”\r\n\r\nOn that I drew him out (as I thought), and he talked volubly. I was\r\namazed to find this young man, in whose brain I had conceived thought\r\nkept one careless holiday, was evidently familiar with the physical\r\nsciences, and especially with chemistry, which was my own study by\r\npredilection. But never had I met with a student in whom a knowledge so\r\nextensive was mixed up with notions so obsolete or so crotchety. In one\r\nsentence he showed that he had mastered some late discovery by Faraday\r\nor Liebig; in the next sentence he was talking the wild fallacies\r\nof Cardan or Van Helmont. I burst out laughing at some paradox about\r\nsympathetic powders, which he enounced as if it were a recognized truth.\r\n\r\n“Pray tell me,” said I, “who was your master in physics; for a cleverer\r\npupil never had a more crack-brained teacher.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered, with his merry laugh, “it is not the teacher’s fault.\r\nI am a mere parrot; just cry out a few scraps of learning picked up here\r\nand there. But, however, I am fond of all researches into Nature; all\r\nguesses at her riddles. To tell you the truth, one reason why I have\r\ntaken to you so heartily is not only that your published work caught my\r\nfancy in the dip which I took into its contents (pardon me if I say dip,\r\nI never do more than dip into any book), but also because young ----\r\ntells me that which all whom I have met in this town confirm; namely,\r\nthat you are one of those few practical chemists who are at once\r\nexceedingly cautious and exceedingly bold,--willing to try every new\r\nexperiment, but submitting experiment to rigid tests. Well, I have an\r\nexperiment running wild in this giddy head of mine, and I want you,\r\nsome day when at leisure, to catch it, fix it as you have fixed that\r\ncylinder, make something of it. I am sure you can.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Something akin to the theories in your work. You would replenish or\r\npreserve to each special constitution the special substance that may\r\nfail to the equilibrium of its health. But you own that in a large\r\nproportion of cases the best cure of disease is less to deal with the\r\ndisease itself than to support and stimulate the whole system, so as to\r\nenable Nature to cure the disease and restore the impaired equilibrium\r\nby her own agencies. Thus, if you find that in certain cases of nervous\r\ndebility a substance like nitric acid is efficacious, it is because\r\nthe nitric acid has a virtue in locking up, as it were, the nervous\r\nenergy,--that is, preventing all undue waste. Again, in some cases of\r\nwhat is commonly called feverish cold, stimulants like ammonia assist\r\nNature itself to get rid of the disorder that oppresses its normal\r\naction; and, on the same principle, I apprehend, it is contended that\r\na large average of human lives is saved in those hospitals which\r\nhave adopted the supporting system of ample nourishment and alcoholic\r\nstimulants.”\r\n\r\n“Your medical learning surprises me,” said I, smiling; “and without\r\npausing to notice where it deals somewhat superficially with disputable\r\npoints in general, and my own theory in particular, I ask you for the\r\ndeduction you draw from your premises.”\r\n\r\n“It is simply this: that to all animate bodies, however various, there\r\nmust be one principle in common,--the vital principle itself. What if\r\nthere be one certain means of recruiting that principle; and what if\r\nthat secret can be discovered?”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! The old illusion of the mediaeval empirics.”\r\n\r\n“Not so. But the mediaeval empirics were great discoverers. You sneer at\r\nVan Helmont, who sought, in water, the principle of all things; but Van\r\nHelmont discovered in his search those invisible bodies called gases.\r\nNow the principle of life must be certainly ascribed to a gas.(1) And\r\nwhat ever is a gas chemistry should not despair of producing! But I can\r\nargue no longer now,--never can argue long at a stretch; we are wasting\r\nthe morning; and, joy! the sun is up! See! Out! come out! out! and greet\r\nthe great Lifegiver face to face.”\r\n\r\nI could not resist the young man’s invitation. In a few minutes we\r\nwere in the quiet lane under the glinting chestnut-trees. Margrave was\r\nchanting, low, a wild tune,--words in a strange language.\r\n\r\n“What words are those,--no European language, I think; for I know a\r\nlittle of most of the languages which are spoken in our quarter of the\r\nglobe, at least by its more civilized races.”\r\n\r\n“Civilized race! What is civilization? Those words were uttered by men\r\nwho founded empires when Europe itself was not civilized! Hush, is it\r\nnot a grand old air?” and lifting his eyes towards the sun, he gave vent\r\nto a voice clear and deep as a mighty bell! The air was grand; the words\r\nhad a sonorous swell that suited it, and they seemed to me jubilant and\r\nyet solemn. He stopped abruptly as a path from the lane had led us into\r\nthe fields, already half-bathed in sunlight, dews glittering on the\r\nhedgerows.\r\n\r\n“Your song,” said I, “would go well with the clash of cymbals or the\r\npeal of the organ. I am no judge of melody, but this strikes me as that\r\nof a religious hymn.”\r\n\r\n“I compliment you on the guess. It is a Persian fire-worshipper’s hymn\r\nto the sun. The dialect is very different from modern Persian. Cyrus the\r\nGreat might have chanted it on his march upon Babylon.”\r\n\r\n“And where did you learn it?”\r\n\r\n“In Persia itself.”\r\n\r\n“You have travelled much, learned much,--and are so young and so fresh.\r\nIs it an impertinent question if I ask whether your parents are yet\r\nliving, or are you wholly lord of yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you for the question,--pray make my answer known in the town.\r\nParents I have not,--never had.”\r\n\r\n“Never had parents!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I ought rather to say that no parents ever owned me. I am a\r\nnatural son, a vagabond, a nobody. When I came of age I received an\r\nanonymous letter, informing me that a sum--I need not say what, but\r\nmore than enough for all I need--was lodged at an English banker’s in\r\nmy name; that my mother had died in my infancy; that my father was also\r\ndead--but recently; that as I was a child of love, and he was unwilling\r\nthat the secret of my birth should ever be traced, he had provided for\r\nme, not by will, but in his life, by a sum consigned to the trust of the\r\nfriend who now wrote to me; I need give myself no trouble to learn more.\r\nFaith, I never did! I am young, healthy, rich,--yes, rich! Now you know\r\nall, and you had better tell it, that I may win no man’s courtesy and no\r\nmaiden’s love upon false pretences. I have not even a right, you see, to\r\nthe name I bear. Hist! let me catch that squirrel.”\r\n\r\nWith what a panther-like bound he sprang! The squirrel eluded his grasp,\r\nand was up the oak-tree; in a moment he was up the oak-tree too. In\r\namazement I saw him rising from bough to bough; saw his bright eyes and\r\nglittering teeth through the green leaves. Presently I heard the sharp\r\npiteous cry of the squirrel, echoed by the youth’s merry laugh; and\r\ndown, through that maze of green, Hargrave came, dropping on the grass\r\nand bounding up, as Mercury might have bounded with his wings at his\r\nheels.\r\n\r\n“I have caught him. What pretty brown eyes!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the gay expression of his face changed to that of a savage; the\r\nsquirrel had wrenched itself half-loose, and bitten him. The poor brute!\r\nIn an instant its neck was wrung, its body dashed on the ground;\r\nand that fair young creature, every feature quivering with rage, was\r\nstamping his foot on his victim again and again! It was horrible. I\r\ncaught him by the arm indignantly. He turned round on me like a wild\r\nbeast disturbed from its prey,--his teeth set, his hand lifted, his eyes\r\nlike balls of fire.\r\n\r\n“Shame!” said I, calmly; “shame on you!”\r\n\r\nHe continued to gaze on me a moment or so, his eye glaring, his breath\r\npanting; and then, as if mastering himself with an involuntary effort,\r\nhis arm dropped to his side, and he said quite humbly, “I beg your\r\npardon; indeed I do. I was beside myself for a moment; I cannot bear\r\npain;” and he looked in deep compassion for himself at his wounded hand.\r\n“Venomous brute!” And he stamped again on the body of the squirrel,\r\nalready crushed out of shape.\r\n\r\nI moved away in disgust, and walked on.\r\n\r\nBut presently I felt my arm softly drawn aside, and a voice, dulcet as\r\nthe coo of a dove, stole its way into my ears. There was no resisting\r\nthe charm with which this extraordinary mortal could fascinate even\r\nthe hard and the cold; nor them, perhaps, the least. For as you see in\r\nextreme old age, when the heart seems to have shrunk into itself, and\r\nto leave but meagre and nipped affections for the nearest relations if\r\ngrown up, the indurated egotism softens at once towards a playful child;\r\nor as you see in middle life, some misanthrope, whose nature has been\r\nsoured by wrong and sorrow, shrink from his own species, yet make\r\nfriends with inferior races, and respond to the caress of a dog,--so,\r\nfor the worldling or the cynic, there was an attraction in the freshness\r\nof this joyous favourite of Nature,--an attraction like that of a\r\nbeautiful child, spoilt and wayward, or of a graceful animal, half\r\ndocile, half fierce.\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, with a smile, as I felt all displeasure gone, “such\r\nindulgence of passion for such a trifle is surely unworthy a student of\r\nphilosophy!”\r\n\r\n“Trifle,” he said dolorously. “But I tell you it is pain; pain is no\r\ntrifle. I suffer. Look!”\r\n\r\nI looked at the hand, which I took in mine. The bite no doubt had been\r\nsharp; but the hand that lay in my own was that which the Greek sculptor\r\ngives to a gladiator; not large (the extremities are never large\r\nin persons whose strength comes from the just proportion of all the\r\nmembers, rather than the factitious and partial force which continued\r\nmuscular exertion will give to one part of the frame, to the comparative\r\nweakening of the rest), but with the firm-knit joints, the solid\r\nfingers, the finished nails, the massive palm, the supple polished skin,\r\nin which we recognize what Nature designs the human hand to be,--the\r\nskilled, swift, mighty doer of all those marvels which win Nature\r\nherself from the wilderness.\r\n\r\n“It is strange,” said I, thoughtfully; “but your susceptibility to\r\nsuffering confirms my opinion, which is different from the popular\r\nbelief,--namely, that pain is most acutely felt by those in whom the\r\nanimal organization being perfect, and the sense of vitality exquisitely\r\nkeen, every injury or lesion finds the whole system rise, as it were, to\r\nrepel the mischief and communicate the consciousness of it to all those\r\nnerves which are the sentinels to the garrison of life. Yet my theory\r\nis scarcely borne out by general fact. The Indian savages must have a\r\nhealth as perfect as yours; a nervous system as fine,--witness their\r\nmarvellous accuracy of ear, of eye, of scent, probably also of touch;\r\nyet they are indifferent to physical pain; or must I mortify your pride\r\nby saying that they have some moral quality defective in you which\r\nenables them to rise superior to it?”\r\n\r\n“The Indian savages,” said Margrave, sullenly, “have not a health\r\nas perfect as mine, and in what you call vitality--the blissful\r\nconsciousness of life--they are as sticks and stones compared to me.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“Because I have lived with them. It is a fallacy to suppose that the\r\nsavage has a health superior to that of the civilized man,--if the\r\ncivilized man be but temperate; and even if not, he has the stamina\r\nthat can resist for years the effect of excesses which would destroy the\r\nsavage in a month. As to the savage’s fine perceptions of sense, such\r\ndo not come from exquisite equilibrium of system, but are hereditary\r\nattributes transmitted from race to race, and strengthened by training\r\nfrom infancy. But is a pointer stronger and healthier than a mastiff,\r\nbecause the pointer through long descent and early teaching creeps\r\nstealthily to his game and stands to it motionless? I will talk of this\r\nlater; now I suffer! Pain, pain! Has life any ill but pain?”\r\n\r\nIt so happened that I had about me some roots of the white lily, which I\r\nmeant, before returning home, to leave with a patient suffering from one\r\nof those acute local inflammations, in which that simple remedy often\r\naffords great relief. I cut up one of these roots, and bound the cooling\r\nleaves to the wounded hand with my handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“There,” said I. “Fortunately if you feel pain more sensibly than\r\nothers, you will recover from it more quickly.” And in a few minutes my\r\ncompanion felt perfectly relieved, and poured out his gratitude with an\r\nextravagance of expression and a beaming delight of countenance which\r\npositively touched me.\r\n\r\n“I almost feel,” said I, “as I do when I have stilled an infant’s\r\nwailing, and restored it smiling to its mother’s breast.”\r\n\r\n“You have done so. I am an infant, and Nature is my mother. Oh, to be\r\nrestored to the full joy of life, the scent of wild flowers, the song of\r\nbirds, and this air--summer air--summer air!”\r\n\r\nI know not why it was, but at that moment, looking at him and hearing\r\nhim, I rejoiced that Lilian was not at L----. “But I came out to bathe.\r\nCan we not bathe in that stream?”\r\n\r\n“No. You would derange the bandage round your hand; and for all bodily\r\nills, from the least to the gravest, there is nothing like leaving\r\nNature at rest the moment we have hit on the means which assist her own\r\nefforts at cure.”\r\n\r\n“I obey, then; but I so love the water.”\r\n\r\n“You swim, of course?”\r\n\r\n“Ask the fish if it swim. Ask the fish if it can escape me! I delight to\r\ndive down--down; to plunge after the startled trout, as an otter does;\r\nand then to get amongst those cool, fragrant reeds and bulrushes, or\r\nthat forest of emerald weed which one sometimes finds waving under clear\r\nrivers. Man! man! could you live but an hour of my life you would know\r\nhow horrible a thing it is to die!”\r\n\r\n“Yet the dying do not think so; they pass away calm and smiling, as you\r\nwill one day.”\r\n\r\n“I--I! die one day--die!” and he sank on the grass, and buried his face\r\namongst the herbage, sobbing aloud.\r\n\r\nBefore I could get through half a dozen words I meant to soothe, he\r\nhad once more bounded up, dashed the tears from his eyes, and was again\r\nsinging some wild, barbaric chant. Abstracting itself from the appeal to\r\nits outward sense by melodies of which the language was unknown, my mind\r\nsoon grew absorbed in meditative conjectures on the singular nature,\r\nso wayward, so impulsive, which had forced intimacy on a man grave and\r\npractical as myself.\r\n\r\nI was puzzled how to reconcile so passionate a childishness, so\r\nundisciplined a want of self-control, with an experience of mankind so\r\nextended by travel, with an education desultory and irregular indeed,\r\nbut which must, at some time or other, have been familiarized to severe\r\nreasonings and laborious studies. In Margrave there seemed to be wanting\r\nthat mysterious something which is needed to keep our faculties, however\r\nseverally brilliant, harmoniously linked together,--as the string by\r\nwhich a child mechanically binds the wildflowers it gathers, shaping\r\nthem at choice into the garland or the chain.\r\n\r\n(1) “According to the views we have mentioned, we must ascribe life to\r\na gas, that is, to an aeriform body.”--Liebig: “Organic Chemistry,”\r\n Mayfair’s translation, p.363.--It is perhaps not less superfluous to add\r\nthat Liebig does not support the views “according to which life must be\r\nascribed to a gas,” than it would be to state, had Dugald Stewart been\r\nquoted as writing, “According to the views we have mentioned the mind\r\nis but a bundle of impressions,” that Dugald Stewart was not supporting,\r\nbut opposing, the views of David Hume. The quotation is merely meant to\r\nshow, in the shortest possible compass, that there are views entertained\r\nby speculative reasoners of our day which, according to Liebig, would\r\nlead to the inference at which Margrave so boldly arrives. Margrave\r\nis, however, no doubt, led to his belief by his reminiscences of Van\r\nHelmont, to whose discovery of gas he is referring. Van Helmont plainly\r\naffirms “that the arterial spirit of our life is of the nature of a\r\ngas;” and in the same chapter (on the fiction of elementary complexions\r\nand mixtures) says, “Seeing that the spirit of our life, since it is a\r\ngas, is most mightily and swiftly affected by any other gas,” etc. He\r\nrepeats the same dogma in his treatise on “Long Life,” and indeed very\r\ngenerally throughout his writings, observing, in his chapter on the\r\nVital Air, that the spirit of life is a salt, sharp vapour, made of the\r\narterial blood, etc. Liebig, therefore, in confuting some modern notions\r\nas to the nature of contagion by miasma, is leading their reasonings\r\nback to that assumption in the Brawn of physiological science by which\r\nthe discoverer of gas exalted into the principle of life the substance\r\nto which he first gave the name, now so familiarly known. It is\r\nnevertheless just to Van Helmont to add that his conception of the vital\r\nprinciple was very far from being as purely materialistic as it\r\nwould seem to those unacquainted with his writings; for he carefully\r\ndistinguishes that principle of life which he ascribes to a gas, and by\r\nwhich he means the sensuous animal life, from the intellectual immortal\r\nprinciple of soul. Van Helmont, indeed, was a sincere believer of Divine\r\nRevelation. “The Lord Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life,” says\r\nwith earnest humility this daring genius, in that noble chapter “On\r\nthe completing of the mind by the ‘prayer of silence,’ and the loving\r\noffering tip of the heart, soul, and strength to the obedience of\r\nthe Divine will,” from which some of the most eloquent of recent\r\nphilosophers, arguing against materialism, have borrowed largely in\r\nsupport and in ornament of their lofty cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nMy intercourse with Margrave grew habitual and familiar. He came to\r\nmy house every morning before sunrise; in the evenings we were again\r\nbrought together: sometimes in the houses to which we were both invited,\r\nsometimes at his hotel, sometimes in my own home.\r\n\r\nNothing more perplexed me than his aspect of extreme youthfulness,\r\ncontrasted with the extent of the travels, which, if he were to be\r\nbelieved, had left little of the known world unexplored. One day I asked\r\nhim bluntly how old he was.\r\n\r\n“How old do I look? How old should you suppose me to be?”\r\n\r\n“I should have guessed you to be about twenty, till you spoke of having\r\ncome of age some years ago.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a sign of longevity when a man looks much younger than he is?”\r\n\r\n“Conjoined with other signs, certainly!”\r\n\r\n“Have I the other signs?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a magnificent, perhaps a matchless, constitutional organization.\r\nBut you have evaded my question as to your age; was it an impertinence\r\nto put it?”\r\n\r\n“No. I came of age--let me see--three years ago.”\r\n\r\n“So long since? Is it possible? I wish I had your secret!”\r\n\r\n“Secret! What secret?”\r\n\r\n“The secret of preserving so much of boyish freshness in the wear and\r\ntear of man-like passions and man-like thoughts.”\r\n\r\n“You are still young yourself,--under forty?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! some years under forty.”\r\n\r\n“And Nature gave you a grander frame and a finer symmetry of feature\r\nthan she bestowed on me.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! pooh! You have the beauty that must charm the eyes of woman, and\r\nthat beauty in its sunny forenoon of youth. Happy man! if you love and\r\nwish to be sure that you are loved again.”\r\n\r\n“What you call love--the unhealthy sentiment, the feverish folly--left\r\nbehind me, I think forever, when--”\r\n\r\n“Ay, indeed,--when?”\r\n\r\n“I came of age!”\r\n\r\n“Hoary cynic! and you despise love! So did I once. Your time may come.”\r\n\r\n“I think not. Does any animal, except man, love its fellow she-animal as\r\nman loves woman?”\r\n\r\n“As man loves woman? No, I suppose not.”\r\n\r\n“And why should the subject animals be wiser than their king? But to\r\nreturn: you would like to have my youth and my careless enjoyment of\r\nyouth?”\r\n\r\n“Can you ask,--who would not?” Margrave looked at me for a moment with\r\nunusual seriousness, and then, in the abrupt changes common to his\r\ncapricious temperament, began to sing softly one of his barbaric\r\nchants,--a chant different from any I had heard him sing before, made,\r\neither by the modulation of his voice or the nature of the tune, so\r\nsweet that, little as music generally affected me, this thrilled to my\r\nvery heart’s core. I drew closer and closer to him, and murmured when he\r\npaused,--\r\n\r\n“Is not that a love-song?”\r\n\r\n“No;” said he, “it is the song by which the serpent-charmer charms the\r\nserpent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nIncreased intimacy with my new acquaintance did not diminish the charm\r\nof his society, though it brought to light some startling defects,\r\nboth in his mental and moral organization. I have before said that\r\nhis knowledge, though it had swept over a wide circuit and dipped into\r\ncurious, unfrequented recesses, was desultory and erratic. It certainly\r\nwas not that knowledge, sustained and aspiring, which the poet assures\r\nus is “the wing on which we mount to heaven.” So, in his faculties\r\nthemselves there were singular inequalities, or contradictions. His\r\npower of memory in some things seemed prodigious, but when examined it\r\nwas seldom accurate; it could apprehend, but did not hold together with\r\na binding grasp what metaphysicians call “complex ideas.” He thus seemed\r\nunable to put it to any steadfast purpose in the sciences of which\r\nit retained, vaguely and loosely, many recondite principles. For\r\nthe sublime and beautiful in literature he had no taste whatever. A\r\npassionate lover of nature, his imagination had no response to the arts\r\nby which nature is expressed or idealized; wholly unaffected by poetry\r\nor painting. Of the fine arts, music alone attracted and pleased him.\r\nHis conversation was often eminently suggestive, touching on much,\r\nwhether in books or mankind, that set one thinking; but I never remember\r\nhim to have uttered any of those lofty or tender sentiments which form\r\nthe connecting links between youth and genius; for if poets sing to the\r\nyoung, and the young hail their own interpreters in poets, it is because\r\nthe tendency of both is to idealize the realities of life,--finding\r\neverywhere in the real a something that is noble or fair, and making the\r\nfair yet fairer, and the noble nobler still.\r\n\r\nIn Margrave’s character there seemed no special vices, no special\r\nvirtues; but a wonderful vivacity, joyousness, animal good-humour. He\r\nwas singularly temperate, having a dislike to wine, perhaps from that\r\npurity of taste which belongs to health absolutely perfect. No healthful\r\nchild likes alcohol; no animal, except man, prefers wine to water.\r\n\r\nBut his main moral defect seemed to me in a want of sympathy, even where\r\nhe professed attachment. He who could feel so acutely for himself,\r\nbe unmanned by the bite of a squirrel, and sob at the thought that he\r\nshould one day die, was as callous to the sufferings of another as a\r\ndeer who deserts and butts from him a wounded comrade.\r\n\r\nI give an instance of this hardness of heart where I should have least\r\nexpected to find it in him.\r\n\r\nHe had met and joined me as I was walking to visit a patient on the\r\noutskirts of the town, when we fell in with a group of children, just\r\nlet loose for an hour or two from their day-school. Some of these\r\nchildren joyously recognized him as having played with them at their\r\nhomes; they ran up to him, and he seemed as glad as themselves at the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nHe suffered them to drag him along with them, and became as merry and\r\nsportive as the youngest of the troop.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, laughing, “if you are going to play at leap-frog, pray\r\ndon’t let it be on the high road, or you will be run over by carts\r\nand draymen; see that meadow just in front to the left,--off with you\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart,” cried Margrave, “while you pay your visit. Come\r\nalong, boys.”\r\n\r\nA little urchin, not above six years old, but who was lame, began to\r\ncry; he could not run,--he should be left behind.\r\n\r\nMargrave stooped. “Climb on my shoulder, little one, and I’ll be your\r\nhorse.”\r\n\r\nThe child dried its tears, and delightedly obeyed. “Certainly,” said I\r\nto myself, “Margrave, after all, must have a nature as gentle as it is\r\nsimple. What other young man, so courted by all the allurements that\r\nsteal innocence from pleasure, would stop in the thoroughfares to play\r\nwith children?”\r\n\r\nThe thought had scarcely passed through my mind when I heard a scream of\r\nagony. Margrave had leaped the railing that divided the meadow from the\r\nroad, and, in so doing, the poor child, perched on his shoulder, had,\r\nperhaps from surprise or fright, loosened its hold and fallen heavily;\r\nits cries were piteous. Margrave clapped his hands to his ears, uttered\r\nan exclamation of anger, and not even stopping to lift up the boy, or\r\nexamine what the hurt was, called to the other children to come on, and\r\nwas soon rolling with them on the grass, and pelting them with daisies.\r\nWhen I came up, only one child remained by the sufferer,-his little\r\nbrother, a year older than himself. The child had fallen on his arm,\r\nwhich was not broken, but violently contused. The pain must have been\r\nintense. I carried the child to his home, and had to remain there some\r\ntime. I did not see Margrave till the next morning. When he then called,\r\nI felt so indignant that I could scarcely speak to him. When at last\r\nI rebuked him for his inhumanity, he seemed surprised; with difficulty\r\nremembered the circumstance, and then merely said, as if it were the\r\nmost natural confession in the world,\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing so discordant as a child’s wail. I hate discords. I am\r\npleased with the company of children; but they must be children who\r\nlaugh and play. Well, why do you look at me so sternly? What have I said\r\nto shock you?”\r\n\r\n“Shock me! you shock manhood itself! Go; I cannot talk to you now. I am\r\nbusy.”\r\n\r\nBut he did not go; and his voice was so sweet, and his ways so winning,\r\nthat disgust insensibly melted into that sort of forgiveness one accords\r\n(let me repeat the illustration) to the deer that forsakes its comrade.\r\nThe poor thing knows no better. And what a graceful beautiful thing this\r\nwas!\r\n\r\nThe fascination--I can give it no other name--which Margrave exercised,\r\nwas not confined to me; it was universal,--old, young, high, low, man,\r\nwoman, child, all felt it. Never in Low Town had stranger, even the most\r\ndistinguished by fame, met with a reception so cordial, so flattering.\r\nHis frank confession that he was a natural son, far from being to his\r\ninjury, served to interest people more in him, and to prevent all those\r\ninquiries in regard to his connections and antecedents which would\r\notherwise have been afloat. To be sure, he was evidently rich,--at least\r\nhe had plenty of money. He lived in the best rooms in the principal\r\nhotel; was very hospitable; entertained the families with whom he had\r\ngrown intimate; made them bring their children,--music and dancing\r\nafter dinner. Among the houses in which he had established familiar\r\nacquaintance was that of the mayor of the town, who had bought Dr.\r\nLloyd’s collection of subjects in natural history. To that collection\r\nthe mayor had added largely by a very recent purchase. He had arranged\r\nthese various specimens, which his last acquisitions had enriched by\r\nthe interesting carcasses of an elephant and a hippopotamus, in a large\r\nwooden building contiguous to his dwelling, which had been constructed\r\nby a former proprietor (a retired fox-hunter) as a riding-house; and\r\nbeing a man who much affected the diffusion of knowledge, he proposed\r\nto open this museum to the admiration of the general public, and, at\r\nhis death, to bequeath it to the Athenaeum or Literary Institute of\r\nhis native town. Margrave, seconded by the influence of the mayor’s\r\ndaughters, had scarcely been three days at L---- before he had persuaded\r\nthis excellent and public-spirited functionary to inaugurate the opening\r\nof his museum by the popular ceremony of a ball. A temporary corridor\r\nshould unite the drawing-rooms, which were on the ground floor, with\r\nthe building that contained the collection; and thus the fete would be\r\nelevated above the frivolous character of a fashionable amusement, and\r\nconsecrated to the solemnization of an intellectual institute. Dazzled\r\nby the brilliancy of this idea, the mayor announced his intention to\r\ngive a ball that should include the surrounding neighbourhood, and be\r\nworthy, in all expensive respects, of the dignity of himself and the\r\noccasion. A night had been fixed for the ball,--a night that became\r\nmemorable indeed to me! The entertainment was anticipated with a lively\r\ninterest, in which even the Hill condescended to share. The Hill did\r\nnot much patronize mayors in general; but when a Mayor gave a ball for\r\na purpose so patriotic, and on a scale so splendid, the Hill liberally\r\nacknowledged that Commerce was, on the whole, a thing which the Eminence\r\nmight, now and then, condescend to acknowledge without absolutely\r\nderogating from the rank which Providence had assigned to it amongst the\r\nHigh Places of earth. Accordingly, the Hill was permitted by its Queen\r\nto honour the first magistrate of Low Town by a promise to attend\r\nhis ball. Now, as this festivity had originated in the suggestion of\r\nMargrave, so, by a natural association of ideas, every one, in talking\r\nof the ball, talked also of Margrave.\r\n\r\nThe Hill had at first affected to ignore a stranger whose debut had been\r\nmade in the mercantile circle of Low Town. But the Queen of the Hill now\r\nsaid, sententiously, “This new man in a few days has become a Celebrity.\r\nIt is the policy of the Hill to adopt Celebrities, if the Celebrities\r\npay respect to the Proprieties. Dr. Fenwick is requested to procure Mr.\r\nMargrave the advantage of being known to the Hill.”\r\n\r\nI found it somewhat difficult to persuade Margrave to accept the Hill’s\r\ncondescending overture. He seemed to have a dislike to all societies\r\npretending to aristocratic distinction,--a dislike expressed with a\r\nfierceness so unwonted, that it made one suppose he had, at some time\r\nor other, been subjected to mortification by the supercilious airs that\r\nblow upon heights so elevated. However, he yielded to my instances, and\r\naccompanied me one evening to Mrs. Poyntz’s house. The Hill was encamped\r\nthere for the occasion. Mrs. Poyntz was exceedingly civil to him, and\r\nafter a few commonplace speeches, hearing that he was fond of music,\r\nconsigned him to the caressing care of Miss Brabazon, who was at\r\nthe head of the musical department in the Queen of the Hill’s\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz retired to her favourite seat near the window, inviting me\r\nto sit beside her; and while she knitted in silence, in silence my eye\r\nglanced towards Margrave, in the midst of the group assembled round the\r\npiano.\r\n\r\nWhether he was in more than usually high spirits, or whether he was\r\nactuated by a malign and impish desire to upset the established laws of\r\ndecorum by which the gayeties of the Hill were habitually subdued into\r\na serene and somewhat pensive pleasantness, I know not; but it was not\r\nmany minutes before the orderly aspect of the place was grotesquely\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nMiss Brabazon having come to the close of a complicated and dreary\r\nsonata, I heard Margrave abruptly ask her if she could play the\r\nTarantella, that famous Neapolitan air which is founded on the legendary\r\nbelief that the bite of the tarantula excites an irresistible desire to\r\ndance. On that highbred spinster’s confession that she was ignorant of\r\nthe air, and had not even heard of the legend, Margrave said, “Let me\r\nplay it to you, with variations of my own.” Miss Brabazon graciously\r\nyielded her place at the instrument. Margrave seated himself,--there was\r\ngreat curiosity to hear his performance. Margrave’s fingers rushed over\r\nthe keys, and there was a general start, the prelude was so unlike any\r\nknown combination of harmonious sounds. Then he began a chant--song I\r\ncan scarcely call it--words certainly not in Italian, perhaps in some\r\nuncivilized tongue, perhaps in impromptu gibberish. And the torture of\r\nthe instrument now commenced in good earnest: it shrieked, it groaned,\r\nwilder and noisier. Beethoven’s Storm, roused by the fell touch of\r\na German pianist, were mild in comparison; and the mighty voice,\r\ndominating the anguish of the cracking keys, had the full diapason of a\r\nchorus. Certainly I am no judge of music, but to my ear the discord was\r\nterrific,--to the ears of better informed amateurs it seemed ravishing.\r\nAll were spellbound; even Mrs. Poyntz paused from her knitting, as the\r\nFates paused from their web at the lyre of Orpheus. To this breathless\r\ndelight, however, soon succeeded a general desire for movement. To my\r\namazement, I beheld these formal matrons and sober fathers of families\r\nforming themselves into a dance, turbulent as a children’s ball at\r\nChristmas; and when, suddenly desisting from his music, Margrave started\r\nup, caught the skeleton hand of lean Miss Brabazon, and whirled her\r\ninto the centre of the dance, I could have fancied myself at a witch’s\r\nsabbat. My eye turned in scandalized alarm towards Mrs. Poyntz. That\r\ngreat creature seemed as much astounded as myself. Her eyes were fixed\r\non the scene in a stare of positive stupor. For the first time, no\r\ndoubt, in her life, she was overcome, deposed, dethroned. The awe of her\r\npresence was literally whirled away. The dance ceased as suddenly as it\r\nhad begun. Darting from the galvanized mummy whom he had selected as his\r\npartner, Margrave shot to Mrs. Poyntz’s side, and said, “Ten thousand\r\npardons for quitting you so soon, but the clock warns me that I have an\r\nengagement elsewhere.” In another moment he was gone.\r\n\r\nThe dance halted, people seemed slowly returning to their senses,\r\nlooking at each other bashfully and ashamed.\r\n\r\n“I could not help it, dear,” sighed Miss Brabazon at last, sinking into\r\na chair, and casting her deprecating, fainting eyes upon the hostess.\r\n\r\n“It is witchcraft,” said fat Mrs. Bruce, wiping her forehead.\r\n\r\n“Witchcraft!” echoed Mrs. Poyntz; “it does indeed look like it. An\r\namazing and portentous exhibition of animal spirits, and not to be\r\nendured by the Proprieties. Where on earth can that young savage have\r\ncome from?”\r\n\r\n“From savage lands,” said I,--“so he says.”\r\n\r\n“Do not bring him here again,” said Mrs. Poyntz. “He would soon turn the\r\nHill topsy-turvy. But how charming! I should like to see more of him,”\r\n she added, in an under voice, “if he would call on me some morning, and\r\nnot in the presence of those for whose Proprieties I am responsible.\r\nJane must be out in her ride with the colonel.”\r\n\r\nMargrave never again attended the patrician festivities of the Hill.\r\nInvitations were poured upon him, especially by Miss Brabazon and the\r\nother old maids, but in vain.\r\n\r\n“Those people,” said he, “are too tamed and civilized for me; and so\r\nfew young persons among them. Even that girl Jane is only young on the\r\nsurface; inside, as old as the World or her mother. I like youth, real\r\nyouth,--I am young, I am young!”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, I observed he would attach himself to some young person,\r\noften to some child, as if with cordial and special favour, yet for\r\nnot more than an hour or so, never distinguishing them by the same\r\npreference when he next met them. I made that remark to him, in rebuke\r\nof his fickleness, one evening when he had found me at work on my\r\nAmbitious Book, reducing to rule and measure the Laws of Nature.\r\n\r\n“It is not fickleness,” said he,--“it is necessity.”\r\n\r\n“Necessity! Explain yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I seek to find what I have not found,” said he; “it is my necessity\r\nto seek it, and among the young; and disappointed in one, I turn to the\r\nother. Necessity again. But find it at last I must.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you mean what the young usually seek in the young; and if,\r\nas you said the other day, you have left love behind you, you now wander\r\nback to re-find it.”\r\n\r\n“Tush! If I may judge by the talk of young fools, love may be found\r\nevery day by him who looks out for it. What I seek is among the rarest\r\nof all discoveries. You might aid me to find it, and in so doing aid\r\nyourself to a knowledge far beyond all that your formal experiments can\r\nbestow.”\r\n\r\n“Prove your words, and command my services,” said I, smiling somewhat\r\ndisdainfully.\r\n\r\n“You told me that you had examined into the alleged phenomena of animal\r\nmagnetism, and proved some persons who pretend to the gift which the\r\nScotch call second sight to be bungling impostors. You were right. I\r\nhave seen the clairvoyants who drive their trade in this town; a common\r\ngipsy could beat them in their own calling. But your experience must\r\nhave shown you that there are certain temperaments in which the gift\r\nof the Pythoness is stored, unknown to the possessor, undetected by the\r\ncommon observer; but the signs of which should be as apparent to the\r\nmodern physiologist, as they were to the ancient priest.”\r\n\r\n“I at least, as a physiologist, am ignorant of the signs: what are\r\nthey?”\r\n\r\n“I should despair of making you comprehend them by mere verbal\r\ndescription. I could guide your observation to distinguish them\r\nunerringly were living subjects before us. But not one in a million has\r\nthe gift to an extent available for the purposes to which the wise would\r\napply it. Many have imperfect glimpses; few, few indeed, the unveiled,\r\nlucent sight. They who have but the imperfect glimpses mislead and\r\ndupe the minds that consult them, because, being sometimes marvellously\r\nright, they excite a credulous belief in their general accuracy; and as\r\nthey are but translators of dreams in their own brain, their assurances\r\nare no more to be trusted than are the dreams of commonplace sleepers.\r\nBut where the gift exists to perfection, he who knows how to direct and\r\nto profit by it should be able to discover all that he desires to know\r\nfor the guidance and preservation of his own life. He will be forewarned\r\nof every danger, forearmed in the means by which danger is avoided.\r\nFor the eye of the true Pythoness matter has no obstruction, space no\r\nconfines, time no measurement.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Margrave, you may well say that creatures so gifted are rare;\r\nand, for my part, I would as soon search for a unicorn, as, to use your\r\naffected expression, for a Pythoness.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, whenever there come across the course of your practice\r\nsome young creature to whom all the evil of the world is as yet unknown,\r\nto whom the ordinary cares and duties of the world are strange and\r\nunwelcome; who from the earliest dawn of reason has loved to sit apart\r\nand to muse; before whose eyes visions pass unsolicited; who converses\r\nwith those who are not dwellers on the earth, and beholds in the space\r\nlandscapes which the earth does not reflect--”\r\n\r\n“Margrave, Margrave! of whom do you speak?”\r\n\r\n“Whose frame, though exquisitely sensitive, has still a health and\r\na soundness in which you recognize no disease; whose mind has a\r\ntruthfulness that you know cannot deceive you, and a simple intelligence\r\ntoo clear to deceive itself; who is moved to a mysterious degree by\r\nall the varying aspects of external nature,--innocently joyous,\r\nor unaccountably sad,--when, I say, such a being comes across your\r\nexperience, inform me; and the chances are that the true Pythoness is\r\nfound.”\r\n\r\nI had listened with vague terror, and with more than one exclamation of\r\namazement, to descriptions which brought Lilian Ashleigh before me;\r\nand I now sat mute, bewildered, breathless, gazing upon Margrave, and\r\nrejoicing that, at least, Lilian he had never seen.\r\n\r\nHe returned my own gaze steadily, searchingly, and then, breaking into a\r\nslight laugh, resumed:--\r\n\r\n“You call my word ‘Pythoness’ affected. I know of no better. My\r\nrecollections of classic anecdote and history are confused and dim;\r\nbut somewhere I have read or heard that the priests of Delphi were\r\naccustomed to travel chiefly into Thrace or Thessaly, in search of the\r\nvirgins who might fitly administer their oracles, and that the oracles\r\ngradually ceased in repute as the priests became unable to discover the\r\norganization requisite in the priestesses, and supplied by craft and\r\nimposture, or by such imperfect fragmentary developments as belong now\r\nto professional clairvoyants, the gifts which Nature failed to afford.\r\nIndeed, the demand was one that mast have rapidly exhausted so limited\r\na supply. The constant strain upon faculties so wearying to the vital\r\nfunctions in their relentless exercise, under the artful stimulants by\r\nwhich the priests heightened their power, was mortal, and no Pythoness\r\never retained her life more than three years from the time that her gift\r\nwas elaborately trained and developed.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! I know of no classical authority for the details you so\r\nconfidently cite. Perhaps some such legends may be found in the\r\nAlexandrian Platonists, but those mystics are no authority on such a\r\nsubject. After all;” I added, recovering from my first surprise, or awe,\r\n“the Delphic oracles were proverbially ambiguous, and their responses\r\nmight be read either way,--a proof that the priests dictated the verses,\r\nthough their arts on the unhappy priestess might throw her into real\r\nconvulsions, and the real convulsions, not the false gift, might shorten\r\nher life. Enough of such idle subjects! Yet no! one question more. If\r\nyou found your Pythoness, what then?”\r\n\r\n“What then? Why, through her aid I might discover the process of an\r\nexperiment which your practical science would assist me to complete.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me of what kind is your experiment; and precisely because such\r\nlittle science as I possess is exclusively practical, I may assist you\r\nwithout the help of the Pythoness.”\r\n\r\nMargrave was silent for some minutes, passing his hand several times\r\nacross his forehead, which was a frequent gesture of his, and then\r\nrising, he answered, in listless accents,--\r\n\r\n“I cannot say more now, my brain is fatigued; and you are not yet in the\r\nright mood to hear me. By the way, how close and reserved you are with\r\nme!”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“You never told me that you were engaged to be married. You leave me,\r\nwho thought to have won your friendship, to hear what concerns you so\r\nintimately from a comparative stranger.”\r\n\r\n“Who told you?”\r\n\r\n“That woman with eyes that pry and lips that scheme, to whose house you\r\ntook me.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Poyntz! is it possible? When?”\r\n\r\n“This afternoon. I met her in the street; she stopped me, and, after\r\nsome unmeaning talk, asked if I had seen you lately; if I did not find\r\nyou very absent and distracted: no wonder;--you were in love. The young\r\nlady was away on a visit, and wooed by a dangerous rival.”\r\n\r\n“Wooed by a dangerous rival!”\r\n\r\n“Very rich, good-looking, young. Do you fear him? You turn pale.”\r\n\r\n“I do not fear, except so far as he who loves truly, loves humbly,\r\nand fears not that another may be preferred, but that another may be\r\nworthier of preference than himself. But that Mrs. Poyntz should tell\r\nyou all this does amaze me. Did she mention the name of the young lady?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; Lilian Ashleigh. Henceforth be more frank with me. Who knows? I\r\nmay help you. Adieu!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nWhen Margrave had gone, I glanced at the clock,--not yet nine. I\r\nresolved to go at once to Mrs. Poyntz. It was not an evening on\r\nwhich she received, but doubtless she would see me. She owed me an\r\nexplanation. How thus carelessly divulge a secret she had been enjoined\r\nto keep; and this rival, of whom I was ignorant? It was no longer a\r\nmatter of wonder that Margrave should have described Lilian’s peculiar\r\nidiosyncrasies in his sketch of his fabulous Pythoness. Doubtless Mrs.\r\nPoyntz had, with unpardonable levity of indiscretion, revealed all of\r\nwhich she disapproved in my choice. But for what object? Was this\r\nher boasted friendship for me? Was it consistent with the regard she\r\nprofessed for Mrs. Ashleigh and Lilian? Occupied by these perplexed and\r\nindignant thoughts, I arrived at Mrs. Poyntz’s house, and was admitted\r\nto her presence. She was fortunately alone; her daughter and the colonel\r\nhad gone to some party on the Hill. I would not take the hand she held\r\nout to me on entrance; seated myself in stern displeasure, and proceeded\r\nat once to inquire if she had really betrayed to Mr. Margrave the secret\r\nof my engagement to Lilian.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Allen Fenwick; I have this day told, not only Mr. Margrave, but\r\nevery person I met who is likely to tell it to some one else, the secret\r\nof your engagement to Lilian Ashleigh. I never promised to conceal it;\r\non the contrary, I wrote word to Anne Ashleigh that I would therein\r\nact as my own judgment counselled me. I think my words to you were that\r\n‘public gossip was sometimes the best security for the completion of\r\nprivate engagements.’”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that Mrs. or Miss Ashleigh recoils from the engagement with\r\nme, and that I should meanly compel them both to fulfil it by calling in\r\nthe public to censure them--if--if--Oh, madam, this is worldly artifice\r\nindeed!”\r\n\r\n“Be good enough to listen to me quietly. I have never yet showed you the\r\nletter to Mrs. Ashleigh, written by Lady Haughton, and delivered by Mr.\r\nVigors. That letter I will now show to you; but before doing so I must\r\nenter into a preliminary explanation. Lady Haughton is one of those\r\nwomen who love power, and cannot obtain it except through wealth and\r\nstation,--by her own intellect never obtain it. When her husband died\r\nshe was reduced from an income of twelve thousand a year to a jointure\r\nof twelve hundred, but with the exclusive guardianship of a young son, a\r\nminor, and adequate allowances for the charge; she continued, therefore,\r\nto preside as mistress over the establishments in town and country;\r\nstill had the administration of her son’s wealth and rank. She stinted\r\nhis education, in order to maintain her ascendancy over him. He became\r\na brainless prodigal, spendthrift alike of health and fortune. Alarmed,\r\nshe saw that, probably, he would die young and a beggar; his only hope\r\nof reform was in marriage. She reluctantly resolved to marry him to a\r\npenniless, well-born, soft-minded young lady whom she knew she could\r\ncontrol; just before this marriage was to take place he was killed by\r\na fall from his horse. The Haughton estate passed to his cousin, the\r\nluckiest young man alive,--the same Ashleigh Sumner who had already\r\nsucceeded, in default of male issue, to poor Gilbert Ashleigh’s\r\nlanded possessions. Over this young man Lady Haughton could expect no\r\ninfluence. She would be a stranger in his house. But she had a niece!\r\nMr. Vigors assured her the niece was beautiful. And if the niece\r\ncould become Mrs. Ashleigh Sumner, then Lady Haughton would be a less\r\nunimportant Nobody in the world, because she would still have her\r\nnearest relation in a Somebody at Haughton Park. Mr. Vigors has his\r\nown pompous reasons for approving an alliance which he might help to\r\naccomplish. The first step towards that alliance was obviously to bring\r\ninto reciprocal attraction the natural charms of the young lady and the\r\nacquired merits of the young gentleman. Mr. Vigors could easily induce\r\nhis ward to pay a visit to Lady Haughton, and Lady Haughton had only to\r\nextend her invitations to her niece; hence the letter to Mrs. Ashleigh,\r\nof which Mr. Vigors was the bearer, and hence my advice to you, of which\r\nyou can now understand the motive. Since you thought Lilian Ashleigh the\r\nonly woman you could love, and since I thought there were other women in\r\nthe world who might do as well for Ashleigh Sumner, it seemed to me\r\nfair for all parties that Lilian should not go to Lady Haughton’s in\r\nignorance of the sentiments with which she had inspired you. A girl can\r\nseldom be sure that she loves until she is sure that she is loved.\r\nAnd now,” added Mrs. Poyntz, rising and walking across the room to\r\nher bureau,--“now I will show you Lady Haughton’s invitation to Mrs.\r\nAshleigh. Here it is!”\r\n\r\nI ran my eye over the letter, which she thrust into my hand, resuming\r\nher knitting-work while I read.\r\n\r\nThe letter was short, couched in conventional terms of hollow affection.\r\nThe writer blamed herself for having so long neglected her brother’s\r\nwidow and child; her heart had been wrapped up too much in the son she\r\nhad lost; that loss had made her turn to the ties of blood still left to\r\nher; she had heard much of Lilian from their common friend, Mr. Vigors;\r\nshe longed to embrace so charming a niece. Then followed the invitation\r\nand the postscript. The postscript ran thus, so far as I can remember:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Whatever my own grief at my irreparable bereavement, I am no egotist;\r\n    I keep my sorrow to myself.  You will find some pleasant guests at my\r\n    house, among others our joint connection, young Ashleigh Sumner.”\r\n\r\n“Woman’s postscripts are proverbial for their significance,” said Mrs.\r\nPoyntz, when I had concluded the letter and laid it on the table; “and\r\nif I did not at once show you this hypocritical effusion, it was simply\r\nbecause at the name Ashleigh Sumner its object became transparent,\r\nnot perhaps to poor Anne Ashleigh nor to innocent Lilian, but to my\r\nknowledge of the parties concerned, as it ought to be to that shrewd\r\nintelligence which you derive partly from nature, partly from the\r\ninsight into life which a true physician cannot fail to acquire. And if\r\nI know anything of you, you would have romantically said, had you seen\r\nthe letter at first, and understood its covert intention, ‘Let me not\r\nshackle the choice of the woman I love, and to whom an alliance so\r\ncoveted in the eyes of the world might, if she were left free, be\r\nproffered.’”\r\n\r\n“I should not have gathered from the postscript all that you see in it;\r\nbut had its purport been so suggested to me, you are right, I should\r\nhave so said. Well, and as Mr. Margrave tells me that you informed him\r\nthat I have a rival, I am now to conclude that the rival is Mr. Ashleigh\r\nSumner?”\r\n\r\n“Has not Mrs. Ashleigh or Lilian mentioned him in writing to you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, both; Lilian very slightly, Mrs. Ashleigh with some praise, as a\r\nyoung man of high character, and very courteous to her.”\r\n\r\n“Yet, though I asked you to come and tell me who were the guests at Lady\r\nHaughton’s, you never did so.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me; but of the guests I thought nothing, and letters addressed\r\nto my heart seemed to me too sacred to talk about. And Ashleigh Sumner\r\nthen courts Lilian! How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I know everything that concerns me; and here, the explanation is\r\nsimple. My aunt, Lady Delafield, is staying with Lady Haughton. Lady\r\nDelafield is one of the women of fashion who shine by their own light;\r\nLady Haughton shines by borrowed light, and borrows every ray she can\r\nfind.”\r\n\r\n“And Lady Delafield writes you word--”\r\n\r\n“That Ashleigh Sumner is caught by Lilian’s beauty.”\r\n\r\n“And Lilian herself--”\r\n\r\n“Women like Lady Delafield do not readily believe that any girl\r\ncould refuse Ashleigh Sumner; considered in himself, he is steady and\r\ngood-looking; considered as owner of Kirby Hall and Haughton Park, he\r\nhas, in the eyes of any sensible mother, the virtues of Cato and the\r\nbeauty of Antinous.”\r\n\r\nI pressed my hand to my heart; close to my heart lay a letter from\r\nLilian, and there was no word in that letter which showed that her heart\r\nwas gone from mine. I shook my head gently, and smiled in confiding\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz surveyed me with a bent brow and a compressed lip.\r\n\r\n“I understand your smile,” she said ironically. “Very likely Lilian may\r\nbe quite untouched by this young man’s admiration, but Anne Ashleigh may\r\nbe dazzled by so brilliant a prospect for her daughter; and, in short, I\r\nthought it desirable to let your engagement be publicly known throughout\r\nthe town to-day. That information will travel; it will reach Ashleigh\r\nSumner through Mr. Vigors, or others in this neighbourhood, with whom I\r\nknow that he corresponds. It will bring affairs to a crisis, and before\r\nit may be too late. I think it well that Ashleigh Sumner should leave\r\nthat house; if he leave it for good, so much the better. And, perhaps,\r\nthe sooner Lilian returns to L---- the lighter your own heart will be.”\r\n\r\n“And for these reasons you have published the secret of--”\r\n\r\n“Your engagement? Yes. Prepare to be congratulated wherever you go. And\r\nnow if you hear either from mother or daughter that Ashleigh Sumner has\r\nproposed, and been, let us say, refused, I do not doubt that, in the\r\npride of your heart, you will come and tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Rely upon it, I will; but before I take leave, allow me to ask why you\r\ndescribed to a young man like Mr. Margrave--, whose wild and strange\r\nhumours you have witnessed and not approved--any of those traits of\r\ncharacter in Miss Ashleigh which distinguish her from other girls of her\r\nage?”\r\n\r\n“I? You mistake. I said nothing to him of her character. I mentioned her\r\nname, and said she was beautiful, that was all.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, you said that she was fond of musing, of solitude; that in her\r\nfancies she believed in the reality of visions which might flit before\r\nher eyes as they flit before the eyes of all imaginative dreamers.”\r\n\r\n“Not a word did I say to Mr. Margrave of such peculiarities in Lilian;\r\nnot a word more than what I have told you, on my honour!”\r\n\r\nStill incredulous, but disguising my incredulity with that convenient\r\nsmile by which we accomplish so much of the polite dissimulation\r\nindispensable to the decencies of civilized life, I took my departure,\r\nreturned home, and wrote to Lilian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe conversation with Mrs. Poyntz left my mind restless and disquieted.\r\nI had no doubt, indeed, of Lilian’s truth; but could I be sure that\r\nthe attentions of a young man, with advantages of fortune so brilliant,\r\nwould not force on her thoughts the contrast of the humbler lot and the\r\nduller walk of life in which she had accepted as companion a man removed\r\nfrom her romantic youth less by disparity of years than by gravity\r\nof pursuits? And would my suit now be as welcomed as it had been by a\r\nmother even so unworldly as Mrs. Ashleigh? Why, too, should both mother\r\nand daughter have left me so unprepared to hear that I had a rival; why\r\nnot have implied some consoling assurance that such rivalry need not\r\ncause me alarm? Lilian’s letters, it is true, touched but little on any\r\nof the persons round her; they were filled with the outpourings of\r\nan ingenuous heart, coloured by the glow of a golden fancy. They were\r\nwritten as if in the wide world we two stood apart alone, consecrated\r\nfrom the crowd by the love that, in linking us together, had hallowed\r\neach to the other. Mrs. Ashleigh’s letters were more general and\r\ndiffusive,--detailed the habits of the household, sketched the guests,\r\nintimated her continued fear of Lady Haughton, but had said nothing more\r\nof Mr. Ashleigh Sumner than I had repeated to Mrs. Poyntz. However, in\r\nmy letter to Lilian I related the intelligence that had reached me, and\r\nimpatiently I awaited her reply.\r\n\r\nThree days after the interview with Mrs. Poyntz, and two days before the\r\nlong-anticipated event of the mayor’s ball, I was summoned to attend\r\na nobleman who had lately been added to my list of patients, and whose\r\nresidence was about twelve miles from L----. The nearest way was through\r\nSir Philip Derval’s park. I went on horseback, and proposed to stop on\r\nthe way to inquire after the steward, whom I had seen but once since his\r\nfit, and that was two days after it, when he called himself at my\r\nhouse to thank me for my attendance, and to declare that he was quite\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nAs I rode somewhat fast through the park, I came, however, upon the\r\nsteward, just in front of the house. I reined in my horse and accosted\r\nhim. He looked very cheerful.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, in a whisper, “I have heard from Sir Philip; his letter\r\nis dated since--since-my good woman told you what I saw,--well, since\r\nthen. So that it must have been all a delusion of mine, as you told her.\r\nAnd yet, well--well--we will not talk of it, doctor; but I hope you have\r\nkept the secret. Sir Philip would not like to hear of it, if he comes\r\nback.”\r\n\r\n“Your secret is quite safe with me. But is Sir Philip likely to come\r\nback?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so, doctor. His letter is dated Paris, and that’s nearer home\r\nthan he has been for many years; and--but bless me! some one is coming\r\nout of the house,--a young gentleman! Who can it be?”\r\n\r\nI looked, and to my surprise I saw Margrave descending the stately\r\nstairs that led from the front door. The steward turned towards him,\r\nand I mechanically followed, for I was curious to know what had brought\r\nMargrave to the house of the long-absent traveller.\r\n\r\nIt was easily explained. Mr. Margrave had heard at L---- much of the\r\npictures and internal decorations of the mansion. He had, by dint\r\nof coaxing (he said, with his enchanting laugh), persuaded the old\r\nhousekeeper to show him the rooms.\r\n\r\n“It is against Sir Philip’s positive orders to show the house to any\r\nstranger, sir; and the housekeeper has done very wrong,” said the\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\n“Pray don’t scold her. I dare say Sir Philip would not have refused me a\r\npermission he might not give to every idle sightseer. Fellow-travellers\r\nhave a freemasonry with each other; and I have been much in the same\r\nfar countries as himself. I heard of him there, and could tell you more\r\nabout him, I dare say, than you know yourself.”\r\n\r\n“You, sir! pray do then.”\r\n\r\n“The next time I come,” said Margrave, gayly; and, with a nod to me,\r\nhe glided off through the trees of the neighbouring grove, along the\r\nwinding footpath that led to the lodge.\r\n\r\n“A very cool gentleman,” muttered the steward; “but what pleasant ways\r\nhe has! You seem to know him, sir. Who is he, may I ask?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Margrave,--a visitor at L----, and he has been a great traveller,\r\nas he says; perhaps he met Sir Philip abroad.”\r\n\r\n“I must go and hear what he said to Mrs. Gates; excuse me, sir, but I am\r\nso anxious about Sir Philip.”\r\n\r\n“If it be not too great a favour, may I be allowed the same privilege\r\ngranted to Mr. Margrave? To judge by the outside of the house, the\r\ninside must be worth seeing; still, if it be against Sir Philip’s\r\npositive orders--”\r\n\r\n“His orders were, not to let the Court become a show-house,--to admit\r\nnone without my consent; but I should be ungrateful indeed, doctor, if I\r\nrefused that consent to you.”\r\n\r\nI tied my horse to the rusty gate of the terrace-walk, and followed\r\nthe steward up the broad stairs of the terrace. The great doors were\r\nunlocked. We entered a lofty hall with a domed ceiling; at the back of\r\nthe hall the grand staircase ascended by a double flight. The design was\r\nundoubtedly Vanbrugh’s,--an architect who, beyond all others, sought\r\nthe effect of grandeur less in space than in proportion; but Vanbrugh’s\r\ndesigns need the relief of costume and movement, and the forms of a more\r\npompous generation, in the bravery of velvets and laces, glancing amid\r\nthose gilded columns, or descending with stately tread those broad\r\npalatial stairs. His halls and chambers are so made for festival and\r\nthrong, that they become like deserted theatres, inexpressibly desolate,\r\nas we miss the glitter of the lamps and the movement of the actors.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper had now appeared,--a quiet, timid old woman. She excused\r\nherself for admitting Margrave--not very intelligibly. It was plain\r\nto see that she had, in truth, been unable to resist what the steward\r\ntermed his “pleasant ways.”\r\n\r\nAs if to escape from a scolding, she talked volubly all the time,\r\nbustling nervously through the rooms, along which I followed her\r\nguidance with a hushed footstep. The principal apartments were on the\r\nground-floor, or rather, a floor raised some ten or fifteen feet above\r\nthe ground; they had not been modernized since the date in which they\r\nwere built. Hangings of faded silk; tables of rare marble, and mouldered\r\ngilding; comfortless chairs at drill against the walls; pictures, of\r\nwhich connoisseurs alone could estimate the value, darkened by dust or\r\nblistered by sun and damp, made a general character of discomfort. On\r\nnot one room, on not one nook, still lingered some old smile of home.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I gathered from the housekeeper’s rambling answers to\r\nquestions put to her by the steward, as I moved on, glancing at the\r\npictures, that Margrave’s visit that day was not his first. He had been\r\nto the house twice before,--his ostensible excuse that he was an amateur\r\nin pictures (though, as I had before observed, for that department of\r\nart he had no taste); but each time he had talked much of Sir Philip. He\r\nsaid that though not personally known to him, he had resided in the same\r\ntowns abroad, and had friends equally intimate with Sir Philip; but when\r\nthe steward inquired if the visitor had given any information as to\r\nthe absentee, it became very clear that Margrave had been rather asking\r\nquestions than volunteering intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe had now come to the end of the state apartments, the last of which\r\nwas a library. “And,” said the old woman, “I don’t wonder the gentleman\r\nknew Sir Philip, for he seemed a scholar, and looked very hard over the\r\nbooks, especially those old ones by the fireplace, which Sir Philip,\r\nHeaven bless him, was always poring into.”\r\n\r\nMechanically I turned to the shelves by the fireplace, and examined the\r\nvolumes ranged in that department. I found they contained the works\r\nof those writers whom we may class together under the title of\r\nmystics,--Iamblichus and Plotinus; Swedenborg and Behmen; Sandivogius,\r\nVan Helmont, Paracelsus, Cardan. Works, too, were there, by writers less\r\nrenowned, on astrology, geomancy, chiromancy, etc. I began to understand\r\namong what class of authors Margrave had picked up the strange notions\r\nwith which he was apt to interpolate the doctrines of practical\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n“I suppose this library was Sir Philip’s usual sitting-room?” said I.\r\n\r\n“No, sir; he seldom sat here. This was his study;” and the old woman\r\nopened a small door, masked by false book backs. I followed her into a\r\nroom of moderate size, and evidently of much earlier date than the rest\r\nof the house. “It is the only room left of an older mansion,” said the\r\nsteward in answer to my remark. “I have heard it was spared on account\r\nof the chimneypiece. But there is a Latin inscription which will tell\r\nyou all about it. I don’t know Latin myself.”\r\n\r\nThe chimneypiece reached to the ceiling. The frieze of the lower part\r\nrested on rude stone caryatides; the upper part was formed of oak panels\r\nvery curiously carved in the geometrical designs favoured by the taste\r\nprevalent in the reigns of Elizabeth and James, but different from any\r\nI had ever seen in the drawings of old houses,--and I was not quite\r\nunlearned in such matters, for my poor father was a passionate antiquary\r\nin all that relates to mediaeval art. The design in the oak panels was\r\ncomposed of triangles interlaced with varied ingenuity, and enclosed in\r\ncircular bands inscribed with the signs of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\nOn the stone frieze supported by the caryatides, immediately under the\r\nwoodwork, was inserted a metal plate, on which was written, in Latin, a\r\nfew lines to the effect that “in this room, Simon Forman, the seeker\r\nof hidden truth, taking refuge from unjust persecution, made those\r\ndiscoveries in nature which he committed, for the benefit of a wiser\r\nage, to the charge of his protector and patron, the worshipful Sir Miles\r\nDerval, knight.”\r\n\r\nForman! The name was not quite unfamiliar to me; but it was not without\r\nan effort that my memory enabled me to assign it to one of the most\r\nnotorious of those astrologers or soothsayers whom the superstition of\r\nan earlier age alternately persecuted and honoured.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the room was more cheerful than the statelier\r\nchambers I had hitherto passed through, for it had still the look of\r\nhabitation,--the armchair by the fireplace; the kneehole writing-table\r\nbeside it; the sofa near the recess of a large bay-window, with\r\nbook-prop and candlestick screwed to its back; maps, coiled in their\r\ncylinders, ranged under the cornice; low strong safes, skirting\r\ntwo sides of the room, and apparently intended to hold papers and\r\ntitle-deeds, seals carefully affixed to their jealous locks. Placed on\r\nthe top of these old-fashioned receptacles were articles familiar to\r\nmodern use,--a fowling-piece here, fishing-rods there, two or three\r\nsimple flower-vases, a pile of music books, a box of crayons. All\r\nin this room seemed to speak of residence and ownership,--of the\r\nidiosyncrasies of a lone single man, it is true, but of a man of one’s\r\nown time,--a country gentleman of plain habits but not uncultivated\r\ntastes.\r\n\r\nI moved to the window; it opened by a sash upon a large balcony, from\r\nwhich a wooden stair wound to a little garden, not visible in front of\r\nthe house, surrounded by a thick grove of evergreens, through which\r\none broad vista was cut, and that vista was closed by a view of the\r\nmausoleum.\r\n\r\nI stepped out into the garden,--a patch of sward with a fountain in the\r\ncentre, and parterres, now more filled with weeds than flowers. At the\r\nleft corner was a tall wooden summer-house or pavilion,--its door wide\r\nopen. “Oh, that’s where Sir Philip used to study many a long summer’s\r\nnight,” said the steward.\r\n\r\n“What! in that damp pavilion?”\r\n\r\n“It was a pretty place enough then, sir; but it is very old,--they say\r\nas old as the room you have just left.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I must look at it, then.”\r\n\r\nThe walls of this summer-house had once been painted in the arabesques\r\nof the Renaissance period; but the figures were now scarcely traceable.\r\nThe woodwork had started in some places, and the sunbeams stole through\r\nthe chinks and played on the floor, which was formed from old tiles\r\nquaintly tessellated and in triangular patterns; similar to those I\r\nhad observed in the chimneypiece. The room in the pavilion was large,\r\nfurnished with old worm-eaten tables and settles. “It was not only here\r\nthat Sir Philip studied, but sometimes in the room above,” said the\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\n“How do you get to the room above? Oh, I see; a stair case in the\r\nangle.” I ascended the stairs with some caution, for they were crooked\r\nand decayed; and, on entering the room above, comprehended at once why\r\nSir Philip had favoured it.\r\n\r\nThe cornice of the ceiling rested on pilasters, within which the\r\ncompartments were formed into open unglazed arches, surrounded by a\r\nrailed balcony. Through these arches, on three sides of the room, the\r\neye commanded a magnificent extent of prospect. On the fourth side the\r\nview was bounded by the mausoleum. In this room was a large telescope;\r\nand on stepping into the balcony, I saw that a winding stair mounted\r\nthence to a platform on the top of the pavilion,--perhaps once used as\r\nan observatory by Forman himself.\r\n\r\n“The gentleman who was here to-day was very much pleased with this\r\nlook-out, sir,” said the housekeeper. “Who would not be? I suppose Sir\r\nPhilip has a taste for astronomy.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say, sir,” said the steward, looking grave; “he likes most\r\nout-of-the-way things.”\r\n\r\nThe position of the sun now warned me that my time pressed, and that I\r\nshould have to ride fast to reach my new patient at the hour appointed.\r\nI therefore hastened back to my horse, and spurred on, wondering\r\nwhether, in the chain of association which so subtly links our pursuits\r\nin manhood to our impressions in childhood, it was the Latin inscription\r\non the chimneypiece that had originally biassed Sir Philip Derval’s\r\nliterary taste towards the mystic jargon of the books at which I had\r\ncontemptuously glanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nI did not see Margrave the following day, but the next morning, a little\r\nafter sunrise, he walked into my study, according to his ordinary habit.\r\n\r\n“So you know something about Sir Philip Derval?” said I. “What sort of a\r\nman is he?”\r\n\r\n“Hateful!” cried Margrave; and then checking himself, burst out into\r\nhis merry laugh. “Just like my exaggerations! I am not acquainted with\r\nanything to his prejudice. I came across his track once or twice in the\r\nEast. Travellers are always apt to be jealous of each other.”\r\n\r\n“You are a strange compound of cynicism and credulity; but I should have\r\nfancied that you and Sir Philip would have been congenial spirits, when\r\nI found, among his favourite books, Van Helmont and Paracelsus. Perhaps\r\nyou, too, study Swedenborg, or, worse still, Ptolemy and Lilly?”\r\n\r\n“Astrologers? No! They deal with the future! I live for the day; only I\r\nwish the day never had a morrow!”\r\n\r\n“Have you not, then that vague desire for the something beyond,--that\r\nnot unhappy, but grand discontent with the limits of the immediate\r\nPresent, from which man takes his passion for improvement and progress,\r\nand from which some sentimental philosophers have deduced an argument in\r\nfavour of his destined immortality?”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said Margrave, with as vacant a stare as that of a peasant whom\r\none has addressed in Hebrew. “What farrago of words is this? I do not\r\ncomprehend you.”\r\n\r\n“With your natural abilities,” I asked with interest, “do you never feel\r\na desire for fame?”\r\n\r\n“Fame? Certainly not. I cannot even understand it!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, would you have no pleasure in the thought that you had\r\nrendered a service to humanity?”\r\n\r\nMargrave looked bewildered; after a moment’s pause, he took from the\r\ntable a piece of bread that chanced to be there, opened the window, and\r\nthrew the crumbs into the lane. The sparrows gathered round the crumbs.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Margrave, “the sparrows come to that dull pavement for the\r\nbread that recruits their lives in this world; do you believe that one\r\nsparrow would be silly enough to fly to a house-top for the sake of some\r\nbenefit to other sparrows, or to be chirruped about after he was dead?\r\nI care for science as the sparrow cares for bread,--it may help me to\r\nsomething good for my own life; and as for fame and humanity, I care\r\nfor them as the sparrow cares for the general interest and posthumous\r\napprobation of sparrows!”\r\n\r\n“Margrave, there is one thing in you that perplexes me more than\r\nall else--human puzzle as you are--in your many eccentricities and\r\nself-contradictions.”\r\n\r\n“What is that one thing in me most perplexing?”\r\n\r\n“This: that in your enjoyment of Nature you have all the freshness of a\r\nchild, but when you speak of Man and his objects in the world, you talk\r\nin the vein of some worn-out and hoary cynic. At such times, were I\r\nto close my eyes, I should say to myself, ‘What weary old man is thus\r\nventing his spleen against the ambition which has failed, and the love\r\nwhich has forsaken him?’ Outwardly the very personation of youth, and\r\nrevelling like a butterfly in the warmth of the sun and the tints of the\r\nherbage, why have you none of the golden passions of the young,--their\r\nbright dreams of some impossible love, their sublime enthusiasm for\r\nsome unattainable glory? The sentiment you have just clothed in the\r\nillustration by which you place yourself on a level with the sparrows is\r\ntoo mean and too gloomy to be genuine at your age. Misanthropy is among\r\nthe dismal fallacies of gray beards. No man, till man’s energies leave\r\nhim, can divorce himself from the bonds of our social kind.”\r\n\r\n“Our kind! Your kind, possibly; but I--” He swept his hand over his\r\nbrow, and resumed, in strange, absent, and wistful accents: “I wonder\r\nwhat it is that is wanting here, and of which at moments I have a\r\ndim reminiscence.” Again he paused, and gazing on me, said with more\r\nappearance of friendly interest than I had ever before remarked in his\r\ncountenance, “You are not looking well. Despite your great physical\r\nstrength, you suffer like your own sickly patients.”\r\n\r\n“True! I suffer at this moment, but not from bodily pain.”\r\n\r\n“You have some cause of mental disquietude?”\r\n\r\n“Who in this world has not?”\r\n\r\n“I never have.”\r\n\r\n“Because you own you have never loved. Certainly, you never seem to care\r\nfor any one but yourself; and in yourself you find an unbroken sunny\r\nholiday,--high spirits, youth, health, beauty, wealth. Happy boy!”\r\n\r\nAt that moment my heart was heavy within me.\r\n\r\nMargrave resumed,--\r\n\r\n“Among the secrets which your knowledge places at the command of your\r\nart, what would you give for one which would enable you to defy and\r\nto deride a rival where you place your affections, which could lock to\r\nyourself, and imperiously control, the will of the being whom you desire\r\nto fascinate, by an influence paramount, transcendent?”\r\n\r\n“Love has that secret,” said I,--“and love alone.”\r\n\r\n“A power stronger than love can suspend, can change love itself. But if\r\nlove be the object or dream of your life, love is the rosy associate\r\nof youth and beauty. Beauty soon fades, youth soon departs. What if\r\nin nature there were means by which beauty and youth can be fixed into\r\nblooming duration,--means that could arrest the course, nay, repair the\r\neffects, of time on the elements that make up the human frame?”\r\n\r\n“Silly boy! Have the Rosicrucians bequeathed to you a prescription for\r\nthe elixir of life?”\r\n\r\n“If I had the prescription I should not ask your aid to discover its\r\ningredients.”\r\n\r\n“And is it in the hope of that notable discovery you have studied\r\nchemistry, electricity, and magnetism? Again I say, Silly boy!”\r\n\r\nMargrave did not heed my reply. His face was overcast, gloomy, troubled.\r\n\r\n“That the vital principle is a gas,” said he, abruptly, “I am fully\r\nconvinced. Can that gas be the one which combines caloric with oxygen?”\r\n\r\n“Phosoxygen? Sir Humphrey Davy demonstrates that gas not to be, as\r\nLavoisier supposed, caloric, but light, combined with oxygen; and he\r\nsuggests, not indeed that it is the vital principle itself, but the\r\npabulum of life to organic beings.” (1)\r\n\r\n“Does he?” said Margrave, his, face clearing up. “Possibly, possibly,\r\nthen, here we approach the great secret of secrets. Look you, Allen\r\nFenwick: I promise to secure to you unfailing security from all the\r\njealous fears that now torture your heart; if you care for that fame\r\nwhich to me is not worth the scent of a flower, the balm of a breeze,\r\nI will impart to you a knowledge which, in the hands of ambition, would\r\ndwarf into commonplace the boasted wonders of recognized science. I will\r\ndo all this, if, in return, but for one month you will give yourself up\r\nto my guidance in whatever experiments I ask, no matter how wild they\r\nmay seem to you.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Margrave, I reject your bribes as I would reject the moon and\r\nthe stars which a child might offer to me in exchange for a toy; but I\r\nmay give the child its toy for nothing, and I may test your experiments\r\nfor nothing some day when I have leisure.”\r\n\r\nI did not hear Margrave’s answer, for at that moment my servant entered\r\nwith letters. Lilian’s hand! Tremblingly, breathlessly, I broke the\r\nseal. Such a loving, bright, happy letter; so sweet in its gentle\r\nchiding of my wrongful fears! It was implied rather than said that\r\nAshleigh Sumner had proposed and been refused. He had now left the\r\nhouse. Lilian and her mother were coming back; in a few days we should\r\nmeet. In this letter were inclosed a few lines from Mrs. Ashleigh. She\r\nwas more explicit about my rival than Lilian had been. If no allusion\r\nto his attentions had been made to me before, it was from a delicate\r\nconsideration for myself. Mrs. Ashleigh said that “the young man had\r\nheard from L---- of our engagement, and--disbelieved it;” but, as Mrs.\r\nPoyntz had so shrewdly predicted, hurried at once to the avowal of his\r\nown attachment, and the offer of his own hand. On Lilian’s refusal his\r\npride had been deeply mortified. He had gone away manifestly in more\r\nanger than sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Lady Delafield, dear Margaret Poyntz’s aunt, had been most kind in\r\n    trying to soothe Lady Haughton’s disappointment, which was rudely\r\n    expressed,--so rudely,” added Mrs. Ashleigh, “that it gives us an\r\n    excuse to leave sooner than had been proposed,--which I am very glad\r\n    of.  Lady Delafield feels much for Mr. Sumner; has invited him to\r\n    visit her at a place she has near Worthing.  She leaves to-morrow in\r\n    order to receive him; promises to reconcile him to our rejection,\r\n    which, as he was my poor Gilbert’s heir, and was very friendly at\r\n    first, would be a great relief to my mind.  Lilian is well, and so\r\n    happy at the thoughts of coming back.”\r\n\r\nWhen I lifted my eyes from these letters I was as a new man, and the\r\nearth seemed a new earth. I felt as if I had realized Margrave’s idle\r\ndreams,--as if youth could never fade, love could never grow cold.\r\n\r\n“You care for no secrets of mine at this moment,” said Margrave,\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n“Secrets!” I murmured; “none now are worth knowing. I am loved! I am\r\nloved!”\r\n\r\n“I bide my time,” said Margrave; and as my eyes met his, I saw there\r\na look I had never seen in those eyes before, sinister, wrathful,\r\nmenacing. He turned away, went out through the sash-door of the study;\r\nand as he passed towards the fields under the luxuriant chestnut-trees,\r\nI heard his musical, barbaric chant,--the song by which the\r\nserpent-charmer charms the serpent,--sweet, so sweet, the very birds on\r\nthe boughs hushed their carol as if to listen.\r\n\r\n(1) See Sir Humphrey Davy on Heat, Light, and the Combinations of Light\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nI called that day on Mrs. Poyntz, and communicated to her the purport of\r\nthe glad news I had received.\r\n\r\nShe was still at work on the everlasting knitting, her firm fingers\r\nlinking mesh into mesh as she listened; and when I had done, she laid\r\nher skein deliberately down, and said, in her favourite characteristic\r\nformula,--\r\n\r\n“So at last?--that is settled!”\r\n\r\nShe rose and paced the room as men are apt to do in reflection, women\r\nrarely need such movement to aid their thoughts; her eyes were fixed\r\non the floor, and one hand was lightly pressed on the palm of the\r\nother,--the gesture of a musing reasoner who is approaching the close of\r\na difficult calculation.\r\n\r\nAt length she paused, fronting me, and said dryly,--\r\n\r\n“Accept my congratulations. Life smiles on you now; guard that smile,\r\nand when we meet next, may we be even firmer friends than we are now!”\r\n\r\n“When we meet next,--that will be to-night--you surely go to the mayor’s\r\ngreat ball? All the Hill descends to Low Town to-night.”\r\n\r\n“No; we are obliged to leave L---- this afternoon; in less than two\r\nhours we shall be gone,--a family engagement. We may be weeks away; you\r\nwill excuse me, then, if I take leave of you so unceremoniously. Stay,\r\na motherly word of caution. That friend of yours, Mr. Margrave! Moderate\r\nyour intimacy with him; and especially after you are married. There is\r\nin that stranger, of whom so little is known, a something which I cannot\r\ncomprehend,--a something that captivates and yet revolts. I find\r\nhim disturbing my thoughts, perplexing my conjectures, haunting my\r\nfancies,--I, plain woman of the world! Lilian is imaginative; beware of\r\nher imagination, even when sure of her heart. Beware of Margrave. The\r\nsooner he quits L---- the better, believe me, for your peace of mind.\r\nAdieu! I must prepare for our journey.”\r\n\r\n“That woman,” muttered I, on quitting her house, “seems to have some\r\nstrange spite against my poor Lilian, ever seeking to rouse my own\r\ndistrust of that exquisite nature which has just given me such proof of\r\nits truth. And yet--and yet--is that woman so wrong here? True! Margrave\r\nwith his wild notions, his strange beauty!--true--true--he might\r\ndangerously encourage that turn for the mystic and visionary which\r\ndistresses me in Lilian. Lilian should not know him. How induce him to\r\nleave L----? Ah, those experiments on which he asks my assistance! I\r\nmight commence them when he comes again, and then invent some excuse to\r\nsend him for completer tests to the famous chemists of Paris or Berlin.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nIt is the night of the mayor’s ball! The guests are assembling fast;\r\ncounty families twelve miles round have been invited, as well as the\r\nprincipal families of the town. All, before proceeding to the room set\r\napart for the dance, moved in procession through the museum,--homage to\r\nscience before pleasure!\r\n\r\nThe building was brilliantly lighted, and the effect was striking,\r\nperhaps because singular and grotesque. There, amidst stands of flowers\r\nand evergreens, lit up with coloured lamps, were grouped the dead\r\nrepresentatives of races all inferior--some deadly--to man. The fancy of\r\nthe ladies had been permitted to decorate and arrange these types of the\r\nanimal world. The tiger glared with glass eyes from amidst artificial\r\nreeds and herbage, as from his native jungle; the grisly white bear\r\npeered from a mimic iceberg. There, in front, stood the sage elephant,\r\nfacing a hideous hippopotamus; whilst an anaconda twined its long spire\r\nround the stem of some tropical tree in zinc. In glass cases, brought\r\ninto full light by festooned lamps, were dread specimens of the reptile\r\nrace,--scorpion and vampire, and cobra capella, with insects of gorgeous\r\nhues, not a few of them with venomed stings.\r\n\r\nBut the chief boast of the collection was in the varieties of the\r\nGenus Simia,--baboons and apes, chimpanzees, with their human visage,\r\nmockeries of man, from the dwarf monkeys perched on boughs lopped from\r\nthe mayor’s shrubberies, to the formidable ourangoutang, leaning on his\r\nhuge club.\r\n\r\nEvery one expressed to the mayor admiration, to each other antipathy,\r\nfor this unwonted and somewhat ghastly, though instructive, addition to\r\nthe revels of a ballroom.\r\n\r\nMargrave, of course, was there, and seemingly quite at home, gliding\r\nfrom group to group of gayly-dressed ladies, and brilliant with\r\na childish eagerness to play off the showman. Many of these grim\r\nfellow-creatures he declared he had seen, played, or fought with. He\r\nhad something true or false to say about each. In his high spirits he\r\ncontrived to make the tiger move, and imitated the hiss of the terribly\r\nanaconda. All that he did had its grace, its charm; and the buzz of\r\nadmiration and the flattering glances of ladies’ eyes followed him\r\nwherever he moved.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was a general feeling of relief when the mayor led the\r\nway from the museum into the ballroom. In provincial parties guests\r\narrive pretty much within the same hour, and so few who had once paid\r\ntheir respects to the apes and serpents, the hippopotamus and the tiger,\r\nwere disposed to repeat the visit, that long before eleven o’clock the\r\nmuseum was as free from the intrusion of human life as the wilderness in\r\nwhich its dead occupants had been born.\r\n\r\nI had gone my round through the rooms, and, little disposed to be\r\nsocial, had crept into the retreat of a window-niche, pleased to think\r\nmyself screened by its draperies,--not that I was melancholy, far from\r\nit; for the letter I had received that morning from Lilian had raised my\r\nwhole being into a sovereignty of happiness high beyond the reach of\r\nthe young pleasure-hunters, whose voices and laughter blended with that\r\nvulgar music.\r\n\r\nTo read her letter again I had stolen to my nook, and now, sure that\r\nnone saw me kiss it, I replaced it in my bosom. I looked through the\r\nparted curtain; the room was comparatively empty; but there, through the\r\nopen folding-doors, I saw the gay crowd gathered round the dancers,\r\nand there again, at right angles, a vista along the corridor afforded a\r\nglimpse of the great elephant in the deserted museum.\r\n\r\nPresently I heard, close beside me, my host’s voice.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a cool corner, a pleasant sofa, you can have it all to yourself.\r\nWhat an honour to receive you under my roof, and on this interesting\r\noccasion! Yes, as you say, there are great changes in L---- since you\r\nleft us. Society has much improved. I must look about and find some\r\npersons to introduce to you. Clever! oh, I know your tastes. We have\r\na wonderful man,--a new doctor. Carries all before him; very high\r\ncharacter, too; good old family, greatly looked up to, even apart from\r\nhis profession. Dogmatic a little,--a Sir Oracle,--‘Lets no dog bark;’\r\nyou remember the quotation,--Shakspeare. Where on earth is he? My dear\r\nSir Philip, I am sure you would enjoy his conversation.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip! Could it be Sir Philip Derval to whom the mayor was giving\r\na flattering yet scarcely propitiatory description of myself? Curiosity\r\ncombined with a sense of propriety in not keeping myself an unsuspected\r\nlistener; I emerged from the curtain, but silently, and reached the\r\ncentre of the room before the mayor perceived me. He then came up to me\r\neagerly, linked his arm in mine, and leading me to a gentleman seated on\r\na sofa, close by the window I had quitted, said,--\r\n\r\n“Doctor, I must present you to Sir Philip Derval, just returned to\r\nEngland, and not six hours in L----. If you would like to see the museum\r\nagain, Sir Philip, the doctor, I am sure, will accompany you.”\r\n\r\n“No, I thank you; it is painful to me at present to see, even under\r\nyour roof, the collection which my poor dear friend, Dr. Lloyd, was so\r\nproudly beginning to form when I left these parts.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, Sir Philip, Dr. Lloyd was a worthy man in his way, but sadly duped\r\nin his latter years; took to mesmerism, only think! But our young doctor\r\nhere showed him up, I can tell you.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip, who had acknowledged my first introduction to his\r\nacquaintance by the quiet courtesy with which a well-bred man goes\r\nthrough a ceremony that custom enables him to endure with equal ease and\r\nindifference, now evinced by a slight change of manner how little the\r\nmayor’s reference to my dispute with Dr. Lloyd advanced me in his good\r\nopinion. He turned away with a bow more formal than his first one, and\r\nsaid calmly,\r\n\r\n“I regret to hear that a man so simple-minded and so sensitive as Dr.\r\nLloyd should have provoked an encounter in which I can well conceive him\r\nto have been worsted. With your leave, Mr. Mayor, I will look into your\r\nballroom. I may perhaps find there some old acquaintances.”\r\n\r\nHe walked towards the dancers, and the mayor, linking his arm in mine,\r\nfollowed close behind, saying in his loud hearty tones,--\r\n\r\n“Come along, you too, Dr. Fenwick, my girls are there; you have not\r\nspoken to them yet.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip, who was then half way across the room, turned round\r\nabruptly, and, looking me full in the face, said,--\r\n\r\n“Fenwick, is your name Fenwick,--Allen Fenwick?”\r\n\r\n“That is my name, Sir Philip.”\r\n\r\n“Then permit me to shake you by the hand; you are no stranger, and no\r\nmere acquaintance to me. Mr. Mayor, we will look into your ballroom\r\nlater; do not let us keep you now from your other guests.”\r\n\r\nThe mayor, not in the least offended by being thus summarily dismissed,\r\nsmiled, walked on, and was soon lost amongst the crowd.\r\n\r\nSir Philip, still retaining my hand, reseated himself on the sofa, and\r\nI took my place by his side. The room was still deserted; now and then\r\na straggler from the ballroom looked in for a moment, and then sauntered\r\nback to the central place of attraction.\r\n\r\n“I am trying to guess,” said I, “how my name should be known to you.\r\nPossibly you may, in some visit to the Lakes, have known my father?”\r\n\r\n“No; I know none of your name but yourself,--if, indeed, as I doubt not,\r\nyou are the Allen Fenwick to whom I owe no small obligation. You were a\r\nmedical student at Edinburgh in the year ----?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“So! At that time there was also at Edinburgh a young man, named Richard\r\nStrahan. He lodged in a fourth flat in the Old Town.”\r\n\r\n“I remember him very well.”\r\n\r\n“And you remember, also, that a fire broke out at night in the house\r\nin which he lodged; that when it was discovered there seemed no hope\r\nof saving him. The flames wrapped the lower part of the house; the\r\nstaircase had given way. A boy, scarcely so old as himself, was the only\r\nhuman being in the crowd who dared to scale the ladder that even then\r\nscarcely reached the windows from which the smoke rolled in volumes;\r\nthat boy penetrated into the room, found the inmate almost insensible,\r\nrallied, supported, dragged him to the window, got him on the\r\nladder,--saved his life then: and his life later, by nursing with a\r\nwoman’s tenderness, through the fever caused by terror and excitement,\r\nthe fellow-creature he had rescued by a man’s daring. The name of that\r\ngallant student was Allen Fenwick, and Richard Strahan is my nearest\r\nliving relation. Are we friends now?”\r\n\r\nI answered confusedly. I had almost forgotten the circumstances referred\r\nto. Richard Strahan had not been one of my more intimate companions, and\r\nI had never seen nor heard of him since leaving college. I inquired what\r\nhad become of him.\r\n\r\n“He is at the Scotch Bar,” said Sir Philip, “and of course without\r\npractice. I understand that he has fair average abilities, but no\r\napplication. If I am rightly informed, he is, however, a thoroughly\r\nhonourable, upright man, and of an affectionate and grateful\r\ndisposition.”\r\n\r\n“I can answer for all you have said in his praise. He had the qualities\r\nyou name too deeply rooted in youth to have lost them now.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip remained for some moments in a musing silence; and I took\r\nadvantage of that silence to examine him with more minute attention than\r\nI had done before, much as the first sight of him had struck me.\r\n\r\nHe was somewhat below the common height,--so delicately formed that one\r\nmight call him rather fragile than slight. But in his carriage and air\r\nthere was remarkable dignity. His countenance was at direct variance\r\nwith his figure; for as delicacy was the attribute of the last, so power\r\nwas unmistakably the characteristic of the first. He looked fully\r\nthe age his steward had ascribed to him,--about forty-eight; at a\r\nsuperficial glance, more, for his hair was prematurely white,--not gray,\r\nbut white as snow. But his eyebrows were still jet black, and his eyes,\r\nequally dark, were serenely bright. His forehead was magnificent,--lofty\r\nand spacious, and with only one slight wrinkle between the brows. His\r\ncomplexion was sunburnt, showing no sign of weak health. The outline of\r\nhis lips was that which I have often remarked in men accustomed to\r\ngreat dangers, and contracting in such dangers the habit of\r\nself-reliance,--firm and quiet, compressed without an effort. And\r\nthe power of this very noble countenance was not intimidating, not\r\naggressive; it was mild, it was benignant. A man oppressed by some\r\nformidable tyranny, and despairing to find a protector, would, on seeing\r\nthat face, have said, “Here is one who can protect me, and who will!”\r\n\r\nSir Philip was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n“I have so many relations scattered over England, that fortunately not\r\none of them can venture to calculate on my property if I die childless,\r\nand therefore not one of them can feel himself injured when, a few weeks\r\nhence, he shall read in the newspapers that Philip Derval is married.\r\nBut for Richard Strahan at least, though I never saw him, I must do\r\nsomething before the newspapers make that announcement. His sister was\r\nvery dear to me.”\r\n\r\n“Your neighbours, Sir Philip, will rejoice at your marriage, since, I\r\npresume, it may induce you to settle amongst them at Derval Court.”\r\n\r\n“At Derval Court! No! I shall not settle there.” Again he paused a\r\nmoment or so, and then went on: “I have long lived a wandering life, and\r\nin it learned much that the wisdom of cities cannot teach. I return to\r\nmy native land with a profound conviction that the happiest life is the\r\nlife most in common with all. I have gone out of my way to do what I\r\ndeemed good, and to avert or mitigate what appeared to me evil. I pause\r\nnow and ask myself, whether the most virtuous existence be not that\r\nin which virtue flows spontaneously from the springs of quiet everyday\r\naction; when a man does good without restlessly seeking it, does good\r\nunconsciously, simply because he is good and he lives. Better, perhaps,\r\nfor me, if I had thought so long ago! And now I come back to England\r\nwith the intention of marrying, late in life though it be, and with such\r\nhopes of happiness as any matter-of-fact man may form. But my hope will\r\nnot be at Derval Court. I shall reside either in London or its immediate\r\nneighbourhood, and seek to gather round me minds by which I can correct,\r\nif I cannot confide to them, the knowledge I myself have acquired.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, if, as I have accidentally heard, you are fond of scientific\r\npursuits, I cannot wonder, that after so long an absence from England,\r\nyou should feel interest in learning what new discoveries have been\r\nmade, what new ideas are unfolding the germs of discoveries yet to be.\r\nBut, pardon me, if in answer to your concluding remark, I venture to say\r\nthat no man can hope to correct any error in his own knowledge, unless\r\nhe has the courage to confide the error to those who can correct. La\r\nPlace has said, ‘Tout se tient dans le chaine immense des verites;’\r\nand the mistake we make in some science we have specially cultivated is\r\noften only to be seen by the light of a separate science as specially\r\ncultivated by another. Thus, in the investigation of truth, frank\r\nexposition to congenial minds is essential to the earnest seeker.”\r\n\r\n“I am pleased with what you say,” said Sir Philip, “and I shall be still\r\nmore pleased to find in you the very confidant I require. But what was\r\nyour controversy with my old friend, Dr. Lloyd? Do I understand our host\r\nrightly, that it related to what in Europe has of late days obtained the\r\nname of mesmerism?”\r\n\r\nI had conceived a strong desire to conciliate the good opinion of a man\r\nwho had treated me with so singular and so familiar a kindness, and it\r\nwas sincerely that I expressed my regret at the acerbity with which I\r\nhad assailed Dr. Lloyd; but of his theories and pretensions I could not\r\ndisguise my contempt. I enlarged on the extravagant fallacies involved\r\nin a fabulous “clairvoyance,” which always failed when put to plain test\r\nby sober-minded examiners. I did not deny the effects of imagination on\r\ncertain nervous constitutions. “Mesmerism could cure nobody; credulity\r\ncould cure many. There was the well-known story of the old woman tried\r\nas a witch; she cured agues by a charm. She owned the impeachment, and\r\nwas ready to endure gibbet or stake for the truth of her talisman,--more\r\nthan a mesmerist would for the truth of his passes! And the charm was a\r\nscroll of gibberish sewn in an old bag and given to the woman in a freak\r\nby the judge himself when a young scamp on the circuit. But the charm\r\ncured? Certainly; just as mesmerism cures. Fools believed in it. Faith,\r\nthat moves mountains, may well cure agues.”\r\n\r\nThus I ran on, supporting my views with anecdote and facts, to which Sir\r\nPhilip listened with placid gravity.\r\n\r\nWhen I had come to an end he said: “Of mesmerism, as practised in\r\nEurope, I know nothing except by report. I can well understand that\r\nmedical men may hesitate to admit it amongst the legitimate resources of\r\northodox pathology; because, as I gather from what you and others say\r\nof its practice, it must, at the best, be far too uncertain in its\r\napplication to satisfy the requirements of science. Yet an examination\r\nof its pretensions may enable you to perceive the truth that lies hid\r\nin the powers ascribed to witchcraft; benevolence is but a weak agency\r\ncompared to malignity; magnetism perverted to evil may solve half the\r\nriddles of sorcery. On this, however, I say no more at present. But\r\nas to that which you appear to reject as the most preposterous and\r\nincredible pretension of the mesmerists, and which you designate by\r\nthe word ‘clairvoyance,’ it is clear to me that you have never yourself\r\nwitnessed even those very imperfect exhibitions which you decide at once\r\nto be imposture. I say imperfect, because it is only a limited number of\r\npersons whom the eye or the passes of the mesmerist can effect; and\r\nby such means, unaided by other means, it is rarely indeed that the\r\nmagnetic sleep advances beyond the first vague shadowy twilight-dawn of\r\nthat condition to which only in its fuller developments I would apply\r\nthe name of ‘trance.’ But still trance is as essential a condition of\r\nbeing as sleep or as waking, having privileges peculiar to itself. By\r\nmeans within the range of the science that explores its nature and its\r\nlaws, trance, unlike the clairvoyance you describe, is producible in\r\nevery human being, however unimpressible to mere mesmerism.”\r\n\r\n“Producible in every human being! Pardon me if I say that I will give\r\nany enchanter his own terms who will produce that effect upon me.”\r\n\r\n“Will you? You consent to have the experiment tried on yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Consent most readily.”\r\n\r\n“I will remember that promise. But to return to the subject. By the\r\nword ‘trance’ I do not mean exclusively the spiritual trance of the\r\nAlexandrian Platonists. There is one kind of trance,--that to which all\r\nhuman beings are susceptible,--in which the soul has no share: for of\r\nthis kind of trance, and it was of this I spoke, some of the inferior\r\nanimals are susceptible; and, therefore, trance is no more a proof of\r\nsoul than is the clairvoyance of the mesmerists, or the dream of our\r\nordinary sleep, which last has been called a proof of soul, though any\r\nman who has kept a dog must have observed that dogs dream as vividly as\r\nwe do. But in this trance there is an extraordinary cerebral activity, a\r\nprojectile force given to the mind, distinct from the soul, by which\r\nit sends forth its own emanations to a distance in spite of material\r\nobstacles, just as a flower, in an altered condition of atmosphere,\r\nsends forth the particles of its aroma. This should not surprise you.\r\nYour thought travels over land and sea in your waking state; thought,\r\ntoo, can travel in trance, and in trance may acquire an intensified\r\nforce. There is, however, another kind of trance which is truly called\r\nspiritual, a trance much more rare, and in which the soul entirely\r\nsupersedes the mere action of the mind.”\r\n\r\n“Stay!” said I; “you speak of the soul as something distinct from the\r\nmind. What the soul may be, I cannot pretend to conjecture; but I cannot\r\nseparate it from the intelligence!”\r\n\r\n“Can you not? A blow on the brain can destroy the intelligence! Do you\r\nthink it can destroy the soul?\r\n\r\n\r\n   ‘From Marlbro’s eyes the tears of dotage flow,\r\n    And Swift expires, a driveller and a show.’\r\n\r\n“Towards the close of his life even Kant’s giant intellect left him.\r\nDo you suppose that in these various archetypes of intellectual man\r\nthe soul was worn out by the years that loosened the strings, or made\r\ntuneless the keys, of the perishing instrument on which the mind\r\nmust rely for all notes of its music? If you cannot distinguish the\r\noperations of the mind from the essence of the soul, I know not by\r\nwhat rational inductions you arrive at the conclusion that the soul is\r\nimperishable.”\r\n\r\nI remained silent. Sir Philip fixed on me his dark eyes quietly and\r\nsearchingly, and, after a short pause, said,--\r\n\r\n“Almost every known body in nature is susceptible of three several\r\nstates of existence,--the solid, the liquid, the aeriform. These\r\nconditions depend on the quantity of heat they contain. The same object\r\nat one moment may be liquid; at the next moment solid; at the next\r\naeriform. The water that flows before your gaze may stop consolidated\r\ninto ice, or ascend into air as a vapour. Thus is man susceptible of\r\nthree states of existence,--the animal, the mental, the spiritual; and\r\naccording as he is brought into relation or affinity with that occult\r\nagency of the whole natural world, which we familiarly call heat, and\r\nwhich no science has yet explained, which no scale can weigh, and no eye\r\ndiscern, one or the other of these three states of being prevails, or is\r\nsubjected.”\r\n\r\nI still continued silent, for I was unwilling discourteously to say to a\r\nstranger so much older than myself, that he seemed to me to reverse\r\nall the maxims of the philosophy to which he made pretence, in founding\r\nspeculations audacious and abstruse upon unanalogous comparisons that\r\nwould have been fantastic even in a poet. And Sir Philip, after another\r\npause, resumed with a half smile,--\r\n\r\n“After what I have said, it will perhaps not very much surprise you\r\nwhen I add that but for my belief in the powers I ascribe to trance, we\r\nshould not be known to each other at this moment.”\r\n\r\n“How? Pray explain!”\r\n\r\n“Certain circumstances, which I trust to relate to you in detail\r\nhereafter, have imposed on me the duty to discover, and to bring human\r\nlaws to bear upon, a creature armed with terrible powers of evil. This\r\nmonster, for without metaphor, monster it is, not man like ourselves,\r\nhas, by arts superior to those of ordinary fugitives, however dexterous\r\nin concealment, hitherto for years eluded my research. Through the\r\ntrance of an Arab child, who, in her waking state, never heard of his\r\nexistence, I have learned that this being is in England, is in L----. I\r\nam here to encounter him. I expect to do so this very night, and under\r\nthis very roof.”\r\n\r\n“Sir Philip!”\r\n\r\n“And if you wonder, as you well may, why I have been talking to you with\r\nthis startling unreserve, know that the same Arab child, on whom I thus\r\nimplicitly rely, informs me that your life is mixed up with that of the\r\nbeing I seek to unmask and disarm,--to be destroyed by his arts or his\r\nagents, or to combine in the causes by which the destroyer himself shall\r\nbe brought to destruction.”\r\n\r\n“My life!--your Arab child named me, Allen Fenwick?”\r\n\r\n“My Arab child told me that the person in whom I should thus naturally\r\nseek an ally was he who had saved the life of the man whom I then meant\r\nfor my heir, if I died unmarried and childless. She told me that I\r\nshould not be many hours in this town, which she described minutely,\r\nbefore you would be made known to me. She described this house, with\r\nyonder lights, and yon dancers. In her trance she saw us sitting\r\ntogether, as we now sit. I accepted the invitation of our host, when he\r\nsuddenly accosted me on entering the town, confident that I should\r\nmeet you here, without even asking whether a person of your name were a\r\nresident in the place; and now you know why I have so freely unbosomed\r\nmyself of much that might well make you, a physician, doubt the\r\nsoundness of my understanding. The same infant, whose vision has been\r\nrealized up to this moment, has warned me also that I am here at great\r\nperil. What that peril may be I have declined to learn, as I have ever\r\ndeclined to ask from the future what affects only my own life on this\r\nearth. That life I regard with supreme indifference, conscious that\r\nI have only to discharge, while it lasts, the duties for which it is\r\nbestowed on me, to the best of my imperfect power; and aware that minds\r\nthe strongest and souls the purest may fall into the sloth habitual to\r\npredestinarians, if they suffer the action due to the present hour to be\r\nawed and paralyzed by some grim shadow on the future! It is only where,\r\nirrespectively of aught that can menace myself, a light not struck out\r\nof my own reason can guide me to disarm evil or minister to good, that\r\nI feel privileged to avail myself of those mirrors on which things,\r\nnear and far, reflect themselves calm and distinct as the banks and the\r\nmountain peak are reflected in the glass of a lake. Here, then, under\r\nthis roof, and by your side, I shall behold him who--Lo! the moment has\r\ncome,--I behold him now!”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke these last words, Sir Philip had risen, and, startled by\r\nhis action and voice, I involuntarily rose too. Resting one hand on\r\nmy shoulder, he pointed with the other towards the threshold of the\r\nballroom. There, the prominent figure of a gay group--the sole male\r\namidst a fluttering circle of silks and lawn, of flowery wreaths,\r\nof female loveliness and female frippery--stood the radiant image of\r\nMargrave. His eyes were not turned towards us. He was looking down, and\r\nhis light laugh came soft, yet ringing, through the general murmur.\r\n\r\nI turned my astonished gaze back to Sir Philip; yes, unmistakably it was\r\non Margrave that his look was fixed. Impossible to associate crime with\r\nthe image of that fair youth! Eccentric notions, fantastic speculations,\r\nvivacious egotism, defective benevolence,--yes. But crime! No!\r\nimpossible!\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” I said aloud. As I spoke, the group had moved on. Margrave\r\nwas no longer in sight. At the same moment some other guests came from\r\nthe ballroom, and seated themselves near us.\r\n\r\nSir Philip looked round, and, observing the deserted museum at the end\r\nof the corridor, drew me into it.\r\n\r\nWhen we were alone, he said in a voice quick and low, but decided,--\r\n\r\n“It is of importance that I should convince you at once of the nature\r\nof that prodigy which is more hostile to mankind than the wolf is to the\r\nsheepfold. No words of mine could at present suffice to clear your\r\nsight from the deception which cheats it. I must enable you to judge for\r\nyourself. It must be now and here. He will learn this night, if he has\r\nnot learned already, that I am in the town. Dim and confused though his\r\nmemories of myself may be, they are memories still; and he well knows\r\nwhat cause he has to dread me. I must put another in possession of his\r\nsecret. Another, and at once! For all his arts will be brought to bear\r\nagainst me, and I cannot foretell their issue. Go, then; enter that\r\ngiddy crowd, select that seeming young man, bring him hither. Take care\r\nonly not to mention my name; and when here, turn the key in the door, so\r\nas to prevent interruption,--five minutes will suffice.”\r\n\r\n“Am I sure that I guess whom you mean? The young light-hearted man,\r\nknown in this place under the name of Margrave? The young man with the\r\nradiant eyes, and the curls of a Grecian statue?”\r\n\r\n“The same; him whom I pointed out. Quick, bring him hither.”\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was too much roused to disobey. Had I conceived that\r\nMargrave, in the heat of youth, had committed some offence which placed\r\nhim in danger of the law and in the power of Sir Philip Derval, I\r\npossessed enough of the old borderer’s black-mail loyalty to have given\r\nthe man whose hand I had familiarly clasped a hint and a help to escape.\r\nBut all Sir Philip’s talk had been so out of the reach of common-sense,\r\nthat I rather expected to see him confounded by some egregious illusion\r\nthan Margrave exposed to any well-grounded accusation. All, then, that\r\nI felt as I walked into the ballroom and approached Margrave was that\r\ncuriosity which, I think, any one of my readers will acknowledge that,\r\nin my position, he himself would have felt.\r\n\r\nMargrave was standing near the dancers, not joining them, but talking\r\nwith a young couple in the ring. I drew him aside.\r\n\r\n“Come with me for a few minutes into the museum; I wish to talk to you.”\r\n\r\n“What about,--an experiment?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, an experiment.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am at your service.”\r\n\r\nIn a minute more, he had followed me into the desolate dead museum. I\r\nlooked round, but did not see Sir Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nMARGRAVE threw himself on a seat just under the great anaconda; I closed\r\nand locked the door. When I had done so, my eye fell on the young man’s\r\nface, and I was surprised to see that it had lost its colour; that\r\nit showed great anxiety, great distress; that his hands were visibly\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” he said in feeble tones, and raising himself half from\r\nhis seat as if with great effort. “Help me up! come away! Something in\r\nthis room is hostile to me, hostile, overpowering! What can it be?”\r\n\r\n“Truth and my presence,” answered a stern, low voice; and Sir Philip\r\nDerval, whose slight form the huge bulk of the dead elephant had before\r\nobscured from my view, came suddenly out from the shadow into the full\r\nrays of the lamps which lit up, as if for Man’s revel, that mocking\r\ncatacomb for the playmates of Nature which he enslaves for his service\r\nor slays for his sport. As Sir Philip spoke and advanced, Margrave sank\r\nback into his seat, shrinking, collapsing, nerveless; terror the most\r\nabject expressed in his staring eyes and parted lips. On the other hand,\r\nthe simple dignity of Sir Philip Derval’s bearing, and the mild power of\r\nhis countenance, were alike inconceivably heightened. A change had come\r\nover the whole man, the more impressive because wholly undefinable.\r\n\r\nHalting opposite Margrave he uttered some words in a language unknown to\r\nme, and stretched one hand over the young man’s head. Margrave at once\r\nbecame stiff and rigid, as if turned to stone. Sir Philip said to me,--\r\n\r\n“Place one of those lamps on the floor,--there, by his feet.”\r\n\r\nI took down one of the coloured lamps from the mimic tree round which\r\nthe huge anaconda coiled its spires, and placed it as I was told.\r\n\r\n“Take the seat opposite to him, and watch.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sir Philip had drawn from his breast-pocket a small\r\nsteel casket, and I observed, as he opened it, that the interior was\r\nsubdivided into several compartments, each with its separate lid; from\r\none of these he took and sprinkled over the flame of the lamp a few\r\ngrains of a powder, colourless and sparkling as diamond dust. In a\r\nsecond or so, a delicate perfume, wholly unfamiliar to my sense, rose\r\nfrom the lamp.\r\n\r\n“You would test the condition of trance; test it, and in the spirit.”\r\n\r\nAnd, as he spoke, his hand rested lightly on my head. Hitherto, amidst\r\na surprise not unmixed with awe, I had preserved a certain defiance, a\r\ncertain distrust. I had been, as it were, on my guard.\r\n\r\nBut as those words were spoken, as that hand rested on my head, as that\r\nperfume arose from the lamp, all power of will deserted me. My first\r\nsensation was that of passive subjugation; but soon I was aware of a\r\nstrange intoxicating effect from the odour of the lamp, round which\r\nthere now played a dazzling vapour. The room swam before me. Like a man\r\noppressed by a nightmare, I tried to move, to cry out, feeling that to\r\ndo so would suffice to burst the thrall that bound me: in vain.\r\n\r\nA time that seemed to me inexorably long, but which, as I found\r\nafterwards, could only have occupied a few seconds, elapsed in this\r\npreliminary state, which, however powerless, was not without a vague\r\nluxurious sense of delight. And then suddenly came pain,--pain, that in\r\nrapid gradations passed into a rending agony. Every bone, sinew, nerve,\r\nfibre of the body, seemed as if wrenched open, and as if some hitherto\r\nunconjectured Presence in the vital organization were forcing itself\r\nto light with all the pangs of travail. The veins seemed swollen to\r\nbursting, the heart labouring to maintain its action by fierce spasms. I\r\nfeel in this description how language fails me. Enough that the anguish\r\nI then endured surpassed all that I have ever experienced of physical\r\npain. This dreadful interval subsided as suddenly as it had commenced.\r\nI felt as if a something undefinable by any name had rushed from me,\r\nand in that rush that a struggle was over. I was sensible of the passive\r\nbliss which attends the release from torture, and then there grew on\r\nme a wonderful calm, and, in that calm, a consciousness of some lofty\r\nintelligence immeasurably beyond that which human memory gathers from\r\nearthly knowledge. I saw before me the still rigid form of Margrave, and\r\nmy sight seemed, with ease, to penetrate through its covering of flesh,\r\nand to survey the mechanism of the whole interior being.\r\n\r\n“View that tenement of clay which now seems so fair, as it was when I\r\nlast beheld it, three years ago, in the house of Haroun of Aleppo!”\r\n\r\nI looked, and gradually, and as shade after shade falls on the mountain\r\nside, while the clouds gather, and the sun vanishes at last, so the form\r\nand face on which I looked changed from exuberant youth into infirm old\r\nage,--the discoloured wrinkled skin, the bleared dim eye, the flaccid\r\nmuscles, the brittle sapless bones. Nor was the change that of age\r\nalone; the expression of the countenance had passed into gloomy\r\ndiscontent, and in every furrow a passion or a vice had sown the seeds\r\nof grief.\r\n\r\nAnd the brain now opened on my sight, with all its labyrinth of cells. I\r\nseemed to have the clew to every winding in the maze.\r\n\r\nI saw therein a moral world, charred and ruined, as, in some fable I\r\nhave read, the world of the moon is described to be; yet withal it was\r\na brain of magnificent formation. The powers abused to evil had been\r\noriginally of rare order,--imagination, and scope, the energies that\r\ndare, the faculties that discover. But the moral part of the brain had\r\nfailed to dominate the mental,--defective veneration of what is good\r\nor great; cynical disdain of what is right and just; in fine, a great\r\nintellect first misguided, then perverted, and now falling with the\r\ndecay of the body into ghastly but imposing ruins,--such was the world\r\nof that brain as it had been three years ago. And still continuing to\r\ngaze thereon, I observed three separate emanations of light,--the one of\r\na pale red hue, the second of a pale azure, the third a silvery spark.\r\n\r\nThe red light, which grew paler and paler as I looked, undulated from\r\nthe brain along the arteries, the veins, the nerves. And I murmured to\r\nmyself, “Is this the principle of animal life?”\r\n\r\nThe azure light equally permeated the frame, crossing and uniting with\r\nthe red, but in a separate and distinct ray, exactly as, in the outer\r\nworld, a ray of light crosses or unites with a ray of heat, though in\r\nitself a separate individual agency. And again I murmured to myself, “Is\r\nthis the principle of intellectual being, directing or influencing that\r\nof animal life; with it, yet not of it?”\r\n\r\nBut the silvery spark! What was that? Its centre seemed the brain; but\r\nI could fix it to no single organ. Nay, wherever I looked through the\r\nsystem, it reflected itself as a star reflects itself upon water. And I\r\nobserved that while the red light was growing feebler and feebler, and\r\nthe azure light was confused, irregular,--now obstructed, now hurrying,\r\nnow almost lost,--the silvery spark was unaltered, undisturbed. So\r\nindependent was it of all which agitated and vexed the frame, that I\r\nbecame strangely aware that if the heart stopped in its action, and the\r\nred light died out; if the brain were paralyzed, that energetic mind\r\nsmitten into idiotcy, and the azure light wandering objectless as a\r\nmeteor wanders over the morass,--still that silver spark would shine\r\nthe same, indestructible by aught that shattered its tabernacle. And\r\nI murmured to myself, “Can that starry spark speak the presence of the\r\nsoul? Does the silver light shine within creatures to which no life\r\nimmortal has been promised by Divine Revelation?”\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily I turned my sight towards the dead forms in the motley\r\ncollection, and lo, in my trance or my vision, life returned to them\r\nall!--to the elephant and the serpent; to the tiger, the vulture, the\r\nbeetle, the moth; to the fish and the polypus, and to yon mockery of man\r\nin the giant ape.\r\n\r\nI seemed to see each as it lived in its native realm of earth, or of\r\nair, or of water; and the red light played more or less warm through the\r\nstructure of each, and the azure light, though duller of hue, seemed to\r\nshoot through the red, and communicate to the creatures an intelligence\r\nfar inferior indeed to that of man, but sufficing to conduct the current\r\nof their will, and influence the cunning of their instincts. But in\r\nnone, from the elephant to the moth, from the bird in which brain was\r\nthe largest to the hybrid in which life seemed to live as in plants,--in\r\nnone was visible the starry silver spark. I turned my eyes from the\r\ncreatures around, back again to the form cowering under the huge\r\nanaconda, and in terror at the animation which the carcasses took in\r\nthe awful illusions of that marvellous trance; for the tiger moved as\r\nif scenting blood, and to the eyes of the serpent the dread fascination\r\nseemed slowly returning.\r\n\r\nAgain I gazed on the starry spark in the form of the man. And I murmured\r\nto myself, “But if this be the soul, why is it so undisturbed and\r\nundarkened by the sins which have left such trace and such ravage in the\r\nworld of the brain?” And gazing yet more intently on the spark, I became\r\nvaguely aware that it was not the soul, but the halo around the soul,\r\nas the star we see in heaven is not the star itself, but its circle of\r\nrays; and if the light itself was undisturbed and undarkened, it was\r\nbecause no sins done in the body could annihilate its essence, nor\r\naffect the eternity of its duration. The light was clear within the\r\nruins of its lodgment, because it might pass away, but could not be\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nBut the soul itself in the heart of the light reflected back on my own\r\nsoul within me its ineffable trouble, humiliation, and sorrow; for\r\nthose ghastly wrecks of power placed at its sovereign command it was\r\nresponsible, and, appalled by its own sublime fate of duration, was\r\nabout to carry into eternity the account of its mission in time. Yet\r\nit seemed that while the soul was still there, though so forlorn and so\r\nguilty, even the wrecks around it were majestic. And the soul, whatever\r\nsentence it might merit, was not among the hopelessly lost; for in its\r\nremorse and its shame, it might still have retained what could serve\r\nfor redemption. And I saw that the mind was storming the soul, in some\r\nterrible rebellious war,--all of thought, of passion, of desire, through\r\nwhich the azure light poured its restless flow, were surging up round\r\nthe starry spark, as in siege. And I could not comprehend the war, nor\r\nguess what it was that the mind demanded the soul to yield. Only the\r\ndistinction between the two was made intelligible by their antagonism.\r\nAnd I saw that the soul, sorely tempted, looked afar for escape from\r\nthe subjects it had ever so ill controlled, and who sought to reduce to\r\ntheir vassal the power which had lost authority as their king. I could\r\nfeel its terror in the sympathy of my own terror, the keenness of my own\r\nsupplicating pity. I knew that it was imploring release from the perils\r\nit confessed its want of strength to encounter. And suddenly the starry\r\nspark rose from the ruins and the tumult around it,--rose into space and\r\nvanished; and where my soul had recognized the presence of soul, there\r\nwas a void. But the red light burned still, becoming more and more\r\nvivid; and as it thus repaired and recruited its lustre, the whole\r\nanimal form, which had been so decrepit, grew restored from decay,\r\ngrew into vigour and youth: and I saw Margrave as I had seen him in\r\nthe waking world, the radiant image of animal life in the beauty of its\r\nfairest bloom.\r\n\r\nAnd over this rich vitality and this symmetric mechanism now reigned\r\nonly, with the animal life, the mind. The starry light fled and the soul\r\nvanished, still was left visible the mind,--mind, by which sensations\r\nconvey and cumulate ideas, and muscles obey volition; mind, as in those\r\nanimals that have more than the elementary, instincts; mind, as it might\r\nbe in men, were men not immortal. As my eyes, in the Vision, followed\r\nthe azure light, undulating as before, through the cells of the brain,\r\nand crossing the red amidst the labyrinth of the nerves, I perceived\r\nthat the essence of that azure light had undergone a change: it had lost\r\nthat faculty of continuous and concentred power by which man improves on\r\nthe works of the past, and weaves schemes to be developed in the future\r\nof remote generations; it had lost all sympathy in the past, because\r\nit had lost all conception of a future beyond the grave; it had lost\r\nconscience, it had lost remorse; the being it informed was no longer\r\naccountable through eternity for the employment of time. The azure light\r\nwas even more vivid in certain organs useful to the conservation of\r\nexistence, as in those organs I had observed it more vivid among some of\r\nthe inferior animals than it is in man,--secretiveness, destructiveness,\r\nand the ready perception of things immediate to the wants of the day;\r\nand the azure light was brilliant in cerebral cells, where before it had\r\nbeen dark, such as those which harbour mirthfulness and hope, for\r\nthere the light was recruited by the exuberant health of the joyous\r\nanimal-being. But it was lead-like, or dim, in the great social organs,\r\nthrough which man subordinates his own interest to that of his species,\r\nand utterly lost in those through which man is reminded of his duties to\r\nthe throne of his Maker.\r\n\r\nIn that marvellous penetration with which the Vision endowed me, I\r\nperceived that in this mind, though in energy far superior to many;\r\nthough retaining, from memories of the former existence, the relics of a\r\nculture wide and in some things profound; though sharpened and quickened\r\ninto formidable, if desultory, force whenever it schemed or aimed at the\r\nanimal self-conservation which now made its master--impulse or instinct;\r\nand though among the reminiscences of its state before its change\r\nwere arts which I could not comprehend, but which I felt were dark\r\nand terrible, lending to a will never checked by remorse arms that no\r\nhealthful philosophy has placed in the arsenal of disciplined genius;\r\nthough the mind in itself had an ally in a body as perfect in strength\r\nand elasticity as man can take from the favour of nature,--still, I say,\r\nI felt that the mind wanted the something without which men never could\r\nfound cities, frame laws, bind together, beautify, exalt the elements\r\nof this world, by creeds that habitually subject them to a reference to\r\nanother. The ant and the bee and the beaver congregate and construct;\r\nbut they do not improve. Man improves because the future impels onward\r\nthat which is not found in the ant, the bee, and the beaver,--that which\r\nwas gone from the being before me.\r\n\r\nI shrank appalled into myself, covered my face with my hands, and\r\ngroaned aloud: “Have I ever then doubted that soul is distinct from\r\nmind?”\r\n\r\nA hand here again touched my forehead, the light in the lamp was\r\nextinguished, I became insensible; and when I recovered I found myself\r\nback in the room in which I had first conversed with Sir Philip Derval,\r\nand seated, as before, on the sofa, by his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nMy recollections of all which I have just attempted to describe were\r\ndistinct and vivid; except with respect to time, it seemed to me as\r\nif many hours must have elapsed since I had entered the museum with\r\nMargrave; but the clock on the mantelpiece met my eyes as I turned them\r\nwistfully round the room; and I was indeed amazed to perceive that five\r\nminutes had sufficed for all which it has taken me so long to narrate,\r\nand which in their transit had hurried me through ideas and emotions so\r\nremote from anterior experience.\r\n\r\nTo my astonishment now succeeded shame and indignation,--shame that\r\nI, who had scoffed at the possibility of the comparatively credible\r\ninfluences of mesmeric action, should have been so helpless a puppet\r\nunder the hand of the slight fellow-man beside me, and so morbidly\r\nimpressed by phantasmagorieal illusions; indignation that, by some fumes\r\nwhich had special potency over the brain, I had thus been, as it were,\r\nconjured out of my senses; and looking full into the calm face at my\r\nside, I said, with a smile to which I sought to convey disdain,--\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you, Sir Philip Derval, on having learned in your\r\ntravels in the East so expert a familiarity with the tricks of its\r\njugglers.”\r\n\r\n“The East has a proverb,” answered Sir Philip, quietly, “that the\r\njuggler may learn much from the dervish, but the dervish can learn\r\nnothing from the juggler. You will pardon me, however, for the effect\r\nproduced on you for a few minutes, whatever the cause of it may be,\r\nsince it may serve to guard your whole life from calamities, to which\r\nit might otherwise have been exposed. And however you may consider that\r\nwhich you have just experienced to be a mere optical illusion, or the\r\nfigment of a brain super-excited by the fumes of a vapour, look within\r\nyourself, and tell me if you do not feel an inward and unanswerable\r\nconviction that there is more reason to shun and to fear the creature\r\nyou left asleep under the dead jaws of the giant serpent, than there\r\nwould be in the serpent itself, could hunger again move its coils, and\r\nvenom again arm its fangs.”\r\n\r\nI was silent, for I could not deny that that conviction had come to me.\r\n\r\n“Henceforth, when you recover from the confusion or anger which\r\nnow disturbs your impressions, you will be prepared to listen to my\r\nexplanations and my recital in a spirit far different from that with\r\nwhich you would have received them before you were subjected to the\r\nexperiment, which, allow me to remind you, you invited and defied. You\r\nwill now, I trust, be fitted to become my confidant and my assistant;\r\nyou will advise with me how, for the sake of humanity, we should act\r\ntogether against the incarnate lie, the anomalous prodigy which glides\r\nthrough the crowd in the image of joyous beauty. For the present I quit\r\nyou. I have an engagement, on worldly affairs, in the town this night.\r\nI am staying at L----, which I shall leave for Derval Court tomorrow\r\nevening. Come to me there the day after to-morrow, at any hour that may\r\nsuit you the best. Adieu!”\r\n\r\nHere Sir Philip Derval rose and left the room. I made no effort to\r\ndetain him. My mind was too occupied in striving to recompose itself and\r\naccount for the phenomena that had scared it, and for the strength of\r\nthe impressions it still retained.\r\n\r\nI sought to find natural and accountable causes for effects so abnormal.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon suggests that the ointments with which witches anointed\r\nthemselves might have had the effect of stopping the pores and\r\ncongesting the rain, and thus impressing the sleep of the unhappy dupes\r\nof their own imagination with dreams so vivid that, on waking, they were\r\nfirmly convinced that they had been borne through the air to the Sabbat.\r\n\r\nI remember also having heard a distinguished French traveller--whose\r\nveracity was unquestionable--say, that he had witnessed extraordinary\r\neffects produced on the sensorium by certain fumigations used by an\r\nAfrican pretender to magic. A person, of however healthy a brain;\r\nsubjected to the influence of these fumigations, was induced to believe\r\nthat he saw the most frightful apparitions.\r\n\r\nHowever extraordinary such effects, they were not incredible,--not at\r\nvariance with our notions of the known laws of nature. And to the vapour\r\nor the odours which a powder applied to a lamp had called forth, I was,\r\ntherefore, prepared to ascribe properties similar to those which Bacon’s\r\nconjecture ascribed to the witches’ ointment, and the French traveller\r\nto the fumigations of the African conjuror.\r\n\r\nBut, as I came to that conclusion, I was seized with an intense\r\ncuriosity to examine for myself those chemical agencies with which\r\nSir Philip Derval appeared so familiar; to test the contents in that\r\nmysterious casket of steel. I also felt a curiosity no less eager, but\r\nmore, in spite of myself, intermingled with fear, to learn all that Sir\r\nPhilip had to communicate of the past history of Margrave. I could but\r\nsuppose that the young man must indeed be a terrible criminal, for a\r\nperson of years so grave, and station so high, to intimate accusations\r\nso vaguely dark, and to use means so extraordinary, in order to enlist\r\nmy imagination rather than my reason against a youth in whom there\r\nappeared none of the signs which suspicion interprets into guilt.\r\n\r\nWhile thus musing, I lifted my eyes and saw Margrave himself there\r\nat the threshold of the ballroom,--there, where Sir Philip had first\r\npointed him out as the criminal he had come to L---- to seek and disarm;\r\nand now, as then, Margrave was the radiant centre of a joyous group. Not\r\nthe young boy-god Iacchus, amidst his nymphs, could, in Grecian frieze\r\nor picture, have seemed more the type of the sportive, hilarious\r\nvitality of sensuous nature. He must have passed unobserved by me, in my\r\npreoccupation of thought, from the museum and across the room in which\r\nI sat; and now there was as little trace in that animated countenance of\r\nthe terror it had exhibited at Sir Philip’s approach, as of the change\r\nit had undergone in my trance or my fantasy.\r\n\r\nBut he caught sight of me, left his young companions, came gayly to my\r\nside.\r\n\r\n“Did you not ask me to go with you into that museum about half an hour\r\nago, or did I dream that I went with you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you went with me into that museum.”\r\n\r\n“Then pray what dull theme did you select to set me asleep there?”\r\n\r\nI looked hard at him, and made no reply. Somewhat to my relief, I now\r\nheard my host’s voice,--\r\n\r\n“Why, Fenwick, what has become of Sir Philip Derval?”\r\n\r\n“He has left; he had business.” And, as I spoke, again I looked hard on\r\nMargrave.\r\n\r\nHis countenance now showed a change; not surprise, not dismay,\r\nbut rather a play of the lip, a flash of the eye, that indicated\r\ncomplacency,--even triumph.\r\n\r\n“So! Sir Philip Derval! He is in L----; he has been here to-night? So!\r\nas I expected.”\r\n\r\n“Did you expect it?” said our host. “No one else did. Who could have\r\ntold you?”\r\n\r\n“The movements of men so distinguished need never take us by surprise.\r\nI knew he was in Paris the other day. It is natural eno’ that he should\r\ncome here. I was prepared for his coming.”\r\n\r\nMargrave here turned away towards the window, which he threw open and\r\nlooked out.\r\n\r\n“There is a storm in the air,” said he, as he continued to gaze into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that Margrave was so wholly unconscious of what had\r\npassed in the museum as to include in oblivion even the remembrance of\r\nSir Philip Derval’s presence before he had been rendered insensible, or\r\nlaid asleep? Was it now only for the first time that he learned of\r\nSir Philip’s arrival in L----, and visit to that house? Was there any\r\nintimation of menace in his words and his aspect?\r\n\r\nI felt that the trouble of my thoughts communicated itself to my\r\ncountenance and manner; and, longing for solitude and fresh air, I\r\nquitted the house. When I found myself in the street I turned round and\r\nsaw Margrave still standing at the open window, but he did not appear to\r\nnotice me; his eyes seemed fixed abstractedly on space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nI walked on slowly and with the downcast brow of a man absorbed in\r\nmeditation. I had gained the broad place in which the main streets of\r\nthe town converged, when I was overtaken by a violent storm of rain. I\r\nsought shelter under the dark archway of that entrance to the district\r\nof Abbey Hill which was still called Monk’s Gate. The shadow within\r\nthe arch was so deep that I was not aware that I had a companion till\r\nI heard my own name, close at my side. I recognized the voice before I\r\ncould distinguish the form of Sir Philip Derval.\r\n\r\n“The storm will soon be over,” said he, quietly. “I saw it coming on in\r\ntime. I fear you neglected the first warning of those sable clouds, and\r\nmust be already drenched.”\r\n\r\nI made no reply, but moved involuntarily away towards the mouth of the\r\narch.\r\n\r\n“I see that you cherish a grudge against me!” resumed Sir Philip. “Are\r\nyou, then, by nature vindictive?”\r\n\r\nSomewhat softened by the friendly tone of this reproach, I answered,\r\nhalf in jest, half in earnest,--\r\n\r\n“You must own, Sir Philip, that I have some little reason for the\r\nuncharitable anger your question imputes to me. But I can forgive you,\r\non one condition.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“The possession for half an hour of that mysterious steel casket which\r\nyou carry about with you, and full permission to analyze and test its\r\ncontents.”\r\n\r\n“Your analysis of the contents,” returned Sir Philip, dryly, “would\r\nleave you as ignorant as before of the uses to which they can be\r\napplied; but I will own to you frankly, that it is my intention to\r\nselect some confidant among men of science, to whom I may safely\r\ncommunicate the wonderful properties which certain essences in that\r\ncasket possess. I invite your acquaintance, nay, your friendship, in the\r\nhope that I may find such a confidant in you. But the casket contains\r\nother combinations, which, if wasted, could not be resupplied,--at least\r\nby any process which the great Master from whom I received them placed\r\nwithin reach of my knowledge. In this they resemble the diamond; when\r\nthe chemist has found that the diamond affords no other substance by\r\nits combustion than pure carbonic-acid gas, and that the only chemical\r\ndifference between the costliest diamond and a lump of pure charcoal is\r\na proportion of hydrogen less than 1/100000 part of the weight of the\r\nsubstance, can the chemist make you a diamond?\r\n\r\n“These, then, the more potent, but also the more perilous of the\r\ncasket’s contents, shall be explored by no science, submitted to no\r\ntest. They are the keys to masked doors in the ramparts of Nature, which\r\nno mortal can pass through without rousing dread sentries never seen\r\nupon this side her wall. The powers they confer are secrets locked in\r\nmy breast, to be lost in my grave; as the casket which lies on my breast\r\nshall not be transferred to the hands of another, till all the rest\r\nof my earthly possessions pass away with my last breath in life and my\r\nfirst in eternity.”\r\n\r\n“Sir Philip Derval,” said I, struggling against the appeals to fancy\r\nor to awe, made in words so strange, uttered in a tone of earnest\r\nconviction, and heard amidst the glare of the lightning, the howl of the\r\nwinds, and the roll of the thunder,--“Sir Philip Derval, you accost\r\nme in a language which, but for my experience of the powers at your\r\ncommand, I should hear with the contempt that is due to the vaunts of a\r\nmountebank, or the pity we give to the morbid beliefs of his dupe. As it\r\nis, I decline the confidence with which you would favour me, subject to\r\nthe conditions which it seems you would impose. My profession abandons\r\nto quacks all drugs which may not be analyzed, all secrets which may not\r\nbe fearlessly told. I cannot visit you at Derval Court. I cannot trust\r\nmyself, voluntarily, again in the power of a man, who has arts of which\r\nI may not examine the nature, by which he can impose on my imagination\r\nand steal away my reason.”\r\n\r\n“Reflect well before you decide,” said Sir Philip, with a solemnity\r\nthat was stern. “If you refuse to be warned and to be armed by me, your\r\nreason and your imagination will alike be subjected to influences\r\nwhich I can only explain by telling you that there is truth in those\r\nimmemorial legends which depose to the existence of magic.”\r\n\r\n“Magic!”\r\n\r\n“There is magic of two kinds,--the dark and evil, appertaining to\r\nwitchcraft or necromancy; the pure and beneficent, which is but\r\nphilosophy, applied to certain mysteries in Nature remote from the\r\nbeaten tracks of science, but which deepened the wisdom of ancient\r\nsages, and can yet unriddle the myths of departed races.”\r\n\r\n“Sir Philip,” I said, with impatient and angry interruption, “if you\r\nthink that a jargon of this kind be worthy a man of your acquirements\r\nand station, it is at least a waste of time to address it to me. I am\r\nled to conclude that you desire to make use of me for some purpose which\r\nI have a right to suppose honest and blameless, because all you know of\r\nme is, that I rendered to your relation services which can not lower my\r\ncharacter in your eyes. If your object be, as you have intimated, to aid\r\nyou in exposing and disabling man whose antecedents have been those of\r\nguilt, and who threatens with danger the society which receives him,\r\nyou must give me proofs that are not reducible to magic; and you must\r\nprepossess me against the person you accuse, not by powders and fumes\r\nthat disorder the brain, but by substantial statements, such as justify\r\none man in condemning another. And, since you have thought fit to\r\nconvince me that there are chemical means at your disposal, by which the\r\nimagination can be so affected as to accept, temporarily, illusions for\r\nrealities, so I again demand, and now still more decidedly than before,\r\nthat while you address yourself to my reason, whether to explain your\r\nobject or to vindicate your charges against a man whom I have admitted\r\nto my acquaintance, you will divest yourself of all means and agencies\r\nto warp my judgment so illicit and fraudulent as those which you\r\nown yourself to possess. Let the casket, with all its contents, be\r\ntransferred to my hands, and pledge me your word that, in giving that\r\ncasket, you reserve to yourself no other means by which chemistry can be\r\nabused to those influences over physical organization, which ignorance\r\nor imposture may ascribe to--magic.”\r\n\r\n“I accept no conditions for my confidence, though I think the better of\r\nyou for attempting to make them. If I live, you will seek me yourself,\r\nand implore my aid. Meanwhile, listen to me, and--”\r\n\r\n“No; I prefer the rain and the thunder to the whispers that steal to my\r\near in the dark from one of whom I have reason to beware.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, I stepped forth, and at that moment the lightning flashed\r\nthrough the arch, and brought into full view the face of the man beside\r\nme. Seen by that glare, it was pale as the face of a corpse, but its\r\nexpression was compassionate and serene.\r\n\r\nI hesitated, for the expression of that hueless countenance touched me;\r\nit was not the face which inspires distrust or fear.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said I, gently; “grant my demand. The casket--”\r\n\r\n“It is no scruple of distrust that now makes that demand; it is a\r\ncuriosity which in itself is a fearful tempter. Did you now possess what\r\nat this moment you desire, how bitterly you would repent!”\r\n\r\n“Do you still refuse my demand?”\r\n\r\n“I refuse.”\r\n\r\n“If then you really need me, it is you who will repent.”\r\n\r\nI passed from the arch into the open space. The rain had passed, the\r\nthunder was more distant. I looked back when I had gained the opposite\r\nside of the way, at the angle of a street which led to my own house.\r\nAs I did so, again the skies lightened, but the flash was comparatively\r\nslight and evanescent; it did not penetrate the gloom of the arch; it\r\ndid not bring the form of Sir Philip into view; but, just under the base\r\nof the outer buttress to the gateway, I descried the outline of a\r\ndark figure, cowering down, huddled up for shelter, the outline so\r\nindistinct, and so soon lost to sight as the flash faded, that I\r\ncould not distinguish if it were man or brute. If it were some chance\r\npasser-by, who had sought refuge from the rain, and overheard any part\r\nof our strange talk, “the listener,” thought I with a half-smile, “must\r\nhave been mightily perplexed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nOn reaching my own home, I found my servant sitting up for me with the\r\ninformation that my attendance was immediately required. The little boy\r\nwhom Margrave’s carelessness had so injured, and for whose injury he had\r\nshown so little feeling, had been weakened by the confinement which\r\nthe nature of the injury required, and for the last few days had been\r\ngenerally ailing. The father had come to my house a few minutes before\r\nI reached it, in great distress of mind, saying that his child had been\r\nseized with fever, and had become delirious. Hearing that I was at the\r\nmayor’s house, he had hurried thither in search of me.\r\n\r\nI felt as if it were almost a relief to the troubled and haunting\r\nthoughts which tormented me, to be summoned to the exercise of a\r\nfamiliar knowledge. I hastened to the bedside of the little sufferer,\r\nand soon forgot all else in the anxious struggle for a human life. The\r\nstruggle promised to be successful; the worst symptoms began to yield\r\nto remedies prompt and energetic, if simple. I remained at the house,\r\nrather to comfort and support the parents, than because my continued\r\nattendance was absolutely needed, till the night was well-nigh gone; and\r\nall cause of immediate danger having subsided, I then found myself once\r\nmore in the streets. An atmosphere palely clear in the gray of dawn had\r\nsucceeded to the thunder-clouds of the stormy night; the streetlamps,\r\nhere and there, burned wan and still. I was walking slowly and wearily,\r\nso tired out that I was scarcely conscious of my own thoughts, when, in\r\na narrow lane, my feet stopped almost mechanically before a human form\r\nstretched at full length in the centre of the road right in my path. The\r\nform was dark in the shadow thrown from the neighbouring houses. “Some\r\npoor drunkard,” thought I, and the humanity inseparable from my calling\r\nnot allowing me to leave a fellow-creature thus exposed to the risk\r\nof being run over by the first drowsy wagoner who might pass along\r\nthe thoroughfare, I stooped to rouse and to lift the form. What was\r\nmy horror when my eyes met the rigid stare of a dead man’s. I started,\r\nlooked again; it was the face of Sir Philip Derval! He was lying on\r\nhis back, the countenance upturned, a dark stream oozing from the\r\nbreast,--murdered by two ghastly wounds, murdered not long since, the\r\nblood was still warm. Stunned and terror-stricken, I stood bending over\r\nthe body. Suddenly I was touched on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Hollo! what is this?” said a gruff voice.\r\n\r\n“Murder!” I answered in hollow accents, which sounded strangely to my\r\nown ear.\r\n\r\n“Murder! so it seems.” And the policeman who had thus accosted me lifted\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n“A gentleman by his dress. How did this happen? How did you come here?”\r\n and the policeman glanced suspiciously at me.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, there came up another policeman, in whom I\r\nrecognized the young man whose sister I had attended and cured.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Fenwick,” said the last, lifting his hat respectfully, and at the\r\nsound of my name his fellow-policeman changed his manner and muttered an\r\napology.\r\n\r\nI now collected myself sufficiently to state the name and rank of the\r\nmurdered man. The policemen bore the body to their station, to which I\r\naccompanied them. I then returned to my own house, and had scarcely sunk\r\non my bed when sleep came over me. But what a sleep! Never till then had\r\nI known how awfully distinct dreams can be. The phantasmagoria of the\r\nnaturalist’s collection revived. Life again awoke in the serpent and the\r\ntiger, the scorpion moved, and the vulture flapped its wings. And there\r\nwas Margrave, and there Sir Philip; but their position of power was\r\nreversed, and Margrave’s foot was on the breast of the dead man. Still\r\nI slept on till I was roused by the summons to attend on Mr. Vigors, the\r\nmagistrate to whom the police had reported the murder.\r\n\r\nI dressed hastily and went forth. As I passed through the street, I\r\nfound that the dismal news had already spread. I was accosted on my way\r\nto the magistrate by a hundred eager, tremulous, inquiring tongues.\r\n\r\nThe scanty evidence I could impart was soon given.\r\n\r\nMy introduction to Sir Philip at the mayor’s house, our accidental\r\nmeeting under the arch, my discovery of the corpse some hours afterwards\r\non my return from my patient, my professional belief that the deed must\r\nhave been done a very short time, perhaps but a few minutes, before I\r\nchanced upon its victim. But, in that case, how account for the long\r\ninterval that had elapsed between the time in which I had left Sir\r\nPhilip under the arch and the time in which the murder must have been\r\ncommitted? Sir Philip could not have been wandering through the streets\r\nall those hours. This doubt, however, was easily and speedily cleared\r\nup. A Mr. Jeeves, who was one of the principal solicitors in the town,\r\nstated that he had acted as Sir Philip’s legal agent and adviser\r\never since Sir Philip came of age, and was charged with the exclusive\r\nmanagement of some valuable house-property which the deceased had\r\npossessed in L----; that when Sir Philip had arrived in the town late in\r\nthe afternoon of the previous day, he had sent for Mr. Jeeves; informed\r\nhim that he, Sir Philip, was engaged to be married; that he wished to\r\nhave full and minute information as to the details of his house property\r\n(which had greatly increased in value since his absence from England),\r\nin connection with the settlements his marriage would render necessary;\r\nand that this information was also required by him in respect to a\r\ncodicil he desired to add to his will.\r\n\r\nHe had, accordingly, requested Mr. Jeeves to have all the books and\r\nstatements concerning the property ready for his inspection that night,\r\nwhen he would call, after leaving the ball which he had promised the\r\nmayor, whom he had accidentally met on entering the town, to attend.\r\nSir Philip had also asked Mr. Jeeves to detain one of his clerks in his\r\noffice, in order to serve, conjointly with Mr. Jeeves, as a witness to\r\nthe codicil he desired to add to his will. Sir Philip had accordingly\r\ncome to Mr. Jeeves’s house a little before midnight; had gone carefully\r\nthrough all the statements prepared for him, and had executed the fresh\r\ncodicil to his testament, which testament he had in their previous\r\ninterview given to Mr. Jeeves’s care, sealed up. Mr. Jeeves stated that\r\nSir Philip, though a man of remarkable talents and great acquirements,\r\nwas extremely eccentric, and of a very peremptory temper, and that the\r\nimportance attached to a promptitude for which there seemed no pressing\r\noccasion did not surprise him in Sir Philip as it might have done in an\r\nordinary client. Sir Philip said, indeed, that he should devote the\r\nnext morning to the draft for his wedding settlements, according to the\r\ninformation of his property which he had acquired; and after a visit of\r\nvery brief duration to Derval Court, should quit the neighbourhood and\r\nreturn to Paris, where his intended bride then was, and in which city it\r\nhad been settled that the marriage ceremony should take place.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeeves had, however, observed to him, that if he were so soon to\r\nbe married, it was better to postpone any revision of testamentary\r\nbequests, since after marriage he would have to make a new will\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Philip had simply answered,--\r\n\r\n“Life is uncertain; who can be sure of the morrow?”\r\n\r\nSir Philip’s visit to Mr. Jeeves’s house had lasted some hours, for\r\nthe conversation between them had branched off from actual business\r\nto various topics. Mr. Jeeves had not noticed the hour when Sir Philip\r\nwent; he could only say that as he attended him to the street-door, he\r\nobserved, rather to his own surprise, that it was close upon daybreak.\r\n\r\nSir Philip’s body had been found not many yards distant from the hotel\r\nat which he had put up, and to which, therefore, he was evidently\r\nreturning when he left Mr. Jeeves,--an old-fashioned hotel, which had\r\nbeen the principal one at L---- when Sir Philip left England, though now\r\noutrivalled by the new and more central establishment in which Margrave\r\nwas domiciled.\r\n\r\nThe primary and natural supposition was that Sir Philip had been\r\nmurdered for the sake of plunder; and this supposition was borne out by\r\nthe fact to which his valet deposed, namely,--\r\n\r\nThat Sir Philip had about his person, on going to the mayor’s house, a\r\npurse containing notes and sovereigns; and this purse was now missing.\r\n\r\nThe valet, who, though an Albanian, spoke English fluently, said that\r\nthe purse had a gold clasp, on which Sir Philip’s crest and initials\r\nwere engraved. Sir Philip’s watch was, however, not taken.\r\n\r\nAnd now, it was not without a quick beat of the heart that I heard\r\nthe valet declare that a steel casket, to which Sir Philip attached\r\nextraordinary value, and always carried about with him, was also\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nThe Albanian described this casket as of ancient Byzantine workmanship,\r\nopening with a peculiar spring, only known to Sir Philip, in whose\r\npossession it had been, so far as the servant knew, about three years:\r\nwhen, after a visit to Aleppo, in which the servant had not accompanied\r\nhim, he had first observed it in his master’s hands. He was asked if\r\nthis casket contained articles to account for the value Sir Philip set\r\non it,--such as jewels, bank-notes, letters of credit, etc. The man\r\nreplied that it might possibly do so; he had never been allowed the\r\nopportunity of examining its contents; but that he was certain the\r\ncasket held medicines, for he had seen Sir Philip take from it some\r\nsmall phials, by which he had performed great cures in the East, and\r\nespecially during a pestilence which had visited Damascus, just after\r\nSir Philip had arrived at that city on quitting Aleppo. Almost every\r\nEuropean traveller is supposed to be a physician; and Sir Philip was a\r\nman of great benevolence, and the servant firmly believed him also to be\r\nof great medical skill. After this statement, it was very naturally\r\nand generally conjectured that Sir Philip was an amateur disciple of\r\nhomoeopathy, and that the casket contained the phials or globules in use\r\namong homoeopathists.\r\n\r\nWhether or not Mr. Vigors enjoyed a vindictive triumph in making me feel\r\nthe weight of his authority, or whether his temper was ruffled in the\r\nexcitement of so grave a case, I cannot say, but his manner was stern\r\nand his tone discourteous in the questions which he addressed to me.\r\nNor did the questions themselves seem very pertinent to the object of\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n“Pray, Dr. Fenwick,” said he, knitting his brows, and fixing his eyes on\r\nme rudely, “did Sir Philip Derval in his conversation with you mention\r\nthe steel casket which it seems he carried about with him?”\r\n\r\nI felt my countenance change slightly as I answered, “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did he tell you what it contained?”\r\n\r\n“He said it contained secrets.”\r\n\r\n“Secrets of what nature,--medicinal or chemical? Secrets which a\r\nphysician might be curious to learn and covetous to possess?”\r\n\r\nThis question seemed to me so offensively significant that it roused my\r\nindignation, and I answered haughtily, that “a physician of any degree\r\nof merited reputation did not much believe in, and still less covet,\r\nthose secrets in his art which were the boast of quacks and pretenders.”\r\n\r\n“My question need not offend you, Dr. Fenwick. I put it in another\r\nshape: Did Sir Philip Derval so boast of the secrets contained in his\r\ncasket that a quack or pretender might deem such secrets of use to him?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly he might, if he believed in such a boast.”\r\n\r\n“Humph!--he might if he so believed. I have no more questions to put to\r\nyou at present, Dr. Fenwick.”\r\n\r\nLittle of any importance in connection with the deceased or his murder\r\ntranspired in the course of that day’s examination and inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe next day, a gentleman distantly related to the young lady to whom\r\nSir Philip was engaged, and who had been for some time in correspondence\r\nwith the deceased, arrived at L----. He had been sent for at the\r\nsuggestion of the Albanian servant, who said that Sir Philip had stayed\r\na day at this gentleman’s house in London, on his way to L----, from\r\nDover.\r\n\r\nThe new comer, whose name was Danvers, gave a more touching pathos to\r\nthe horror which the murder had excited. It seemed that the motives\r\nwhich had swayed Sir Philip in the choice of his betrothed were\r\nsingularly pure and noble. The young lady’s father--an intimate college\r\nfriend--had been visited by a sudden reverse of fortune, which had\r\nbrought on a fever that proved mortal. He had died some years ago,\r\nleaving his only child penniless, and had bequeathed her to the care and\r\nguardianship of Sir Philip.\r\n\r\nThe orphan received her education at a convent near Paris; and when\r\nSir Philip, a few weeks since, arrived in that city from the East, he\r\noffered her his hand and fortune.\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Mr. Danvers, “from the conversation I held with him\r\nwhen he came to me in London, that he was induced to this offer by the\r\nconscientious desire to discharge the trust consigned to him by his old\r\nfriend. Sir Philip was still of an age that could not permit him to take\r\nunder his own roof a female ward of eighteen, without injury to her\r\ngood name. He could only get over that difficulty by making the ward\r\nhis wife. ‘She will be safer and happier with the man she will love and\r\nhonour for her father’s sake,’ said the chivalrous gentleman, ‘than she\r\nwill be under any other roof I could find for her.’”\r\n\r\nAnd now there arrived another stranger to L----, sent for by Mr. Jeeves,\r\nthe lawyer,--a stranger to L----, but not to me; my old Edinburgh\r\nacquaintance, Richard Strahan.\r\n\r\nThe will in Mr. Jeeves’s keeping, with its recent codicil, was opened\r\nand read. The will itself bore date about six years anterior to the\r\ntestator’s tragic death: it was very short, and, with the exception of\r\na few legacies, of which the most important was L10,000 to his ward, the\r\nwhole of his property was left to Richard Strahan, on the condition that\r\nhe took the name and arms of Derval within a year from the date of Sir\r\nPhilip’s decease. The codicil, added to the will the night before his\r\ndeath, increased the legacy to the young lady from L10,000 to L30,000,\r\nand bequeathed an annuity of L100 a year to his Albanian servant.\r\nAccompanying the will, and within the same envelope, was a sealed\r\nletter, addressed to Richard Strahan, and dated at Paris two weeks\r\nbefore Sir Philip’s decease. Strahan brought that letter to me. It ran\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Richard Strahan, I advise you to pull down the house called Derval\r\n    Court, and to build another on a better site, the plans of which, to\r\n    be modified according to your own taste and requirements, will be\r\n    found among my papers.  This is a recommendation, not a command.  But\r\n    I strictly enjoin you entirely to demolish the more ancient part,\r\n    which was chiefly occupied by myself, and to destroy by fire, without\r\n    perusal, all the books and manuscripts found in the safes in my study.\r\n    I have appointed you my sole executor, as well as my heir, because I\r\n    have no personal friends in whom I can confide as I trust I may do in\r\n    the man I have never seen, simply because he will bear my name and\r\n    represent my lineage.  There will be found in my writing-desk, which\r\n    always accompanies me in my travels, an autobiographical work, a\r\n    record of my own life, comprising discoveries, or hints at discovery,\r\n    in science, through means little cultivated in our age.  You will not\r\n    be surprised that before selecting you as my heir and executor, from a\r\n    crowd of relations not more distant, I should have made inquiries in\r\n    order to justify my selection.  The result of those inquiries informs\r\n    me that you have not yourself the peculiar knowledge nor the habits of\r\n    mind that could enable you to judge of matters which demand the\r\n    attainments and the practice of science; but that you are of an\r\n    honest, affectionate nature, and will regard as sacred the last\r\n    injunctions of a benefactor.  I enjoin you, then, to submit the\r\n    aforesaid manuscript memoir to some man on whose character for\r\n    humanity and honour you can place confidential reliance, and who is\r\n    accustomed to the study of the positive sciences, more especially\r\n    chemistry, in connection with electricity and magnetism.  My desire is\r\n    that he shall edit and arrange this memoir for publication; and that,\r\n    wherever he feels a conscientious doubt whether any discovery, or hint\r\n    of discovery, therein contained would not prove more dangerous than\r\n    useful to mankind, he shall consult with any other three men of\r\n    science whose names are a guarantee for probity and knowledge, and\r\n    according to the best of his judgment, after such consultation,\r\n    suppress or publish the passage of which he has so doubted.  I own the\r\n    ambition which first directed me towards studies of a very unusual\r\n    character, and which has encouraged me in their pursuit through many\r\n    years of voluntary exile, in lands where they could be best\r\n    facilitated or aided,--the ambition of leaving behind me the renown of\r\n    a bold discoverer in those recesses of nature which philosophy has\r\n    hitherto abandoned to superstition.  But I feel, at the moment in\r\n    which I trace these lines, a fear lest, in the absorbing interest of\r\n    researches which tend to increase to a marvellous degree the power of\r\n    man over all matter, animate or inanimate, I may have blunted my own\r\n    moral perceptions; and that there may be much in the knowledge which I\r\n    sought and acquired from the pure desire of investigating hidden\r\n    truths, that could be more abused to purposes of tremendous evil than\r\n    be likely to conduce to benignant good.  And of this a mind\r\n    disciplined to severe reasoning, and uninfluenced by the enthusiasm\r\n    which has probably obscured my own judgment, should be the\r\n    unprejudiced arbiter.  Much as I have coveted and still do covet\r\n    that fame which makes the memory of one man the common inheritance of\r\n    all, I would infinitely rather that my name should pass away with my\r\n    breath, than that I should transmit to my fellowmen any portion of\r\n    a knowledge which the good might forbear to exercise and the bad might\r\n    unscrupulously pervert.  I bear about with me, wherever I wander, a\r\n    certain steel casket.  I received this casket, with its contents, from\r\n    a man whose memory I hold in profound veneration.  Should I live to\r\n    find a person whom, after minute and intimate trial of his character,\r\n    I should deem worthy of such confidence, it is my intention to\r\n    communicate to him the secret how to prepare and how to use such of\r\n    the powders and essences stored within that casket as I myself have\r\n    ventured to employ.  Others I have never tested, nor do I know how\r\n    they could be resupplied if lost or wasted.  But as the contents of\r\n    this casket, in the hands of any one not duly instructed as to the\r\n    mode of applying them, would either be useless, or conduce, through\r\n    inadvertent and ignorant misapplication, to the most dangerous\r\n    consequences; so, if I die without having found, and in writing named,\r\n    such a confidant as I have described above, I command you immediately\r\n    to empty all the powders and essences found therein into any running\r\n    stream of water, which will at once harmlessly dissolve them.  On\r\n    no account must they be cast into fire!\r\n\r\n   “This letter, Richard Strahan, will only come under your eyes in case\r\n    the plans and the hopes which I have formed for my earthly future\r\n    should be frustrated by the death on which I do not calculate, but\r\n    against the chances of which this will and this letter provide.  I am\r\n    about to revisit England, in defiance of a warning that I shall be\r\n    there subjected to some peril which I refused to have defined, because\r\n    I am unwilling that any mean apprehension of personal danger should\r\n    enfeeble my nerves in the discharge of a stern and solemn duty.  If I\r\n    overcome that peril, you will not be my heir; my testament will be\r\n    remodelled; this letter will be recalled and destroyed.  I shall form\r\n    ties which promise me the happiness I have never hitherto found,\r\n    though it is common to all men,--the affections of home, the caresses\r\n    of children, among whom I may find one to whom hereafter I may\r\n    bequeath, in my knowledge, a far nobler heritage than my lands.  In\r\n    that case, however, my first care would be to assure your own\r\n    fortunes.  And the sum which this codicil assures to my betrothed\r\n    would be transferred to yourself on my wedding-day.  Do you know why,\r\n    never having seen you, I thus select you for preference to all my\r\n    other kindred; why my heart, in writing thus, warms to your image?\r\n    Richard Strahan, your only sister, many years older than yourself--you\r\n    were then a child--was the object of my first love.  We were to have\r\n    been wedded, for her parents deceived me into the belief that she\r\n    returned my affection.  With a rare and nobler candour, she herself\r\n    informed me that her heart was given to another, who possessed not my\r\n    worldly gifts of wealth and station.  In resigning my claims to her\r\n    hand, I succeeded in propitiating her parents to her own choice.  I\r\n    obtained for her husband the living which he held, and I settled on\r\n    your sister the dower which, at her death, passed to you as the\r\n    brother to whom she had shown a mother’s love, and the interest of\r\n    which has secured you a modest independence.\r\n\r\n   “If these lines ever reach you, recognize my title to reverential\r\n    obedience to commands which may seem to you wild, perhaps irrational;\r\n    and repay, as if a debt due from your own lost sister, the affection\r\n    I have borne to you for her sake.”\r\n\r\nWhile I read this long and strange letter, Strahan sat by my side,\r\ncovering his face with his hands, and weeping with honest tears for the\r\nman whose death had made him powerful and rich.\r\n\r\n“You will undertake the trust ordained to me in this letter,” said he,\r\nstruggling to compose himself. “You will read and edit this memoir;\r\nyou are the very man he himself would have selected. Of your honour and\r\nhumanity there can be no doubt, and you have studied with success the\r\nsciences which he specifies as requisite for the discharge of the task\r\nhe commands.”\r\n\r\nAt this request, though I could not be wholly unprepared for it, my\r\nfirst impulse was that of a vague terror. It seemed to me as if I were\r\nbecoming more and more entangled in a mysterious and fatal web. But this\r\nimpulse soon faded in the eager yearnings of an ardent and irresistible\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nI promised to read the manuscript, and in order that I might fully imbue\r\nmy mind with the object and wish of the deceased, I asked leave to make\r\na copy of the letter I had just read. To this Strahan readily assented,\r\nand that copy I have transcribed in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\nI asked Strahan if he had yet found the manuscript. He said, “No, he\r\nhad not yet had the heart to inspect the papers left by the deceased.\r\nHe would now do so. He should go in a day or two to Derval Court, and\r\nreside there till the murderer was discovered, as doubtless he soon must\r\nbe through the vigilance of the police. Not till that discovery was made\r\nshould Sir Philip’s remains, though already placed in their coffin, be\r\nconsigned to the family vault.”\r\n\r\nStrahan seemed to have some superstitious notion that the murderer might\r\nbe more secure from justice if his victim were thrust unavenged into the\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nThe belief prevalent in the town ascribed the murder of Sir Philip to\r\nthe violence of some vulgar robber, probably not an inhabitant of L----.\r\nMr. Vigors did not favour that belief. He intimated an opinion, which\r\nseemed extravagant and groundless, that Sir Philip had been murdered,\r\nfor the sake not of the missing purse, but of the missing casket. It was\r\ncurrently believed that the solemn magistrate had consulted one of\r\nhis pretended clairvoyants, and that this impostor had gulled him\r\nwith assurances, to which he attached a credit that perverted into\r\negregiously absurd directions his characteristic activity and zeal.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the coroner’s inquest closed without casting any\r\nlight on so mysterious a tragedy.\r\n\r\nWhat were my own conjectures I scarcely dared to admit,--I certainly\r\ncould not venture to utter them; but my suspicions centred upon\r\nMargrave. That for some reason or other he had cause to dread Sir\r\nPhilip’s presence in L---- was clear, even to my reason. And how could\r\nmy reason reject all the influences which had been brought to bear on my\r\nimagination, whether by the scene in the museum or my conversation\r\nwith the deceased? But it was impossible to act on such\r\nsuspicions,--impossible even to confide them. Could I have told to any\r\nman the effect produced on me in the museum, he would have considered\r\nme a liar or a madman. And in Sir Philip’s accusations against Margrave,\r\nthere was nothing tangible,--nothing that could bear repetition. Those\r\naccusations, if analyzed, vanished into air. What did they imply?--that\r\nMargrave was a magician, a monstrous prodigy, a creature exceptional to\r\nthe ordinary conditions of humanity. Would the most reckless of mortals\r\nhave ventured to bring against the worst of characters such a charge,\r\non the authority of a deceased witness, and to found on evidence so\r\nfantastic the awful accusation of murder? But of all men, certainly I--a\r\nsober, practical physician--was the last whom the public could excuse\r\nfor such incredible implications; and certainly, of all men, the last\r\nagainst whom any suspicion of heinous crime would be readily entertained\r\nwas that joyous youth in whose sunny aspect life and conscience alike\r\nseemed to keep careless holiday. But I could not overcome, nor did I\r\nattempt to reason against, the horror akin to detestation, that had\r\nsucceeded to the fascinating attraction by which Margrave had before\r\nconciliated a liking founded rather on admiration than esteem.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid his visits I kept away from the study in which I had\r\nhabitually spent my mornings, and to which he had been accustomed to\r\nso ready an access; and if he called at the front door, I directed\r\nmy servant to tell him that I was either from home or engaged. He\r\ndid attempt for the first few days to visit me as before, but when my\r\nintention to shun him became thus manifest, desisted naturally enough,\r\nas any other man so pointedly repelled would have done.\r\n\r\nI abstained from all those houses in which I was likely to meet him,\r\nand went my professional round of visits in a close carriage, so that I\r\nmight not be accosted by him in his walks.\r\n\r\nOne morning, a very few days after Strahan had shown me Sir Philip\r\nDerval’s letter, I received a note from my old college acquaintance,\r\nstating that he was going to Derval Court that afternoon; that he should\r\ntake with him the memoir which he had found, and begging me to visit\r\nhim at his new home the next day, and commence my inspection of the\r\nmanuscript. I consented eagerly.\r\n\r\nThat morning, on going my round, my carriage passed by another drawn up\r\nto the pavement, and I recognized the figure of Margrave standing beside\r\nthe vehicle, and talking to some one seated within it. I looked back,\r\nas my own carriage whirled rapidly by, and saw with uneasiness and\r\nalarm that it was Richard Strahan to whom Margrave was thus familiarly\r\naddressing himself. How had the two made acquaintance?\r\n\r\nWas it not an outrage on Sir Philip Derval’s memory, that the heir he\r\nhad selected should be thus apparently intimate with the man whom he had\r\nso sternly denounced? I became still more impatient to read the memoir:\r\nin all probability it would give such explanations with respect to\r\nMargrave’s antecedents, as, if not sufficing to criminate him of legal\r\noffences, would at least effectually terminate any acquaintance between\r\nSir Philip’s successor and himself.\r\n\r\nAll my thoughts were, however, diverted to channels of far deeper\r\ninterest even than those in which my mind had of late been so\r\ntumultuously whirled along, when, on returning home, I found a note from\r\nMrs. Ashleigh. She and Lilian had just come back to L----, sooner than\r\nshe had led me to anticipate. Lilian had not seemed quite well the last\r\nday or two, and had been anxious to return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nLet me recall it--softly,--softly! Let me recall that evening spent\r\nwith her!--that evening, the last before darkness rose between us like a\r\nsolid wall.\r\n\r\nIt was evening, at the close of summer. The sun had set, the twilight\r\nwas lingering still. We were in the old monastic garden,--garden so\r\nquiet, so cool, so fragrant. She was seated on a bench under the one\r\ngreat cedar-tree that rose sombre in the midst of the grassy lawn with\r\nits little paradise of flowers. I had thrown myself on the sward at\r\nher feet; her hand so confidingly lay in the clasp of mine. I see her\r\nstill,--how young, how fair, how innocent!\r\n\r\nStrange, strange! So inexpressibly English; so thoroughly the creature\r\nof our sober, homely life! The pretty delicate white robe that I touch\r\nso timorously, and the ribbon-knots of blue that so well become the\r\nsoft colour of the fair cheek, the wavy silk of the brown hair! She is\r\nmurmuring low her answer to my trembling question.\r\n\r\n“As well as when last we parted? Do you love me as well still?”\r\n\r\n“There is no ‘still’ written here,” said she, softly pressing her hand\r\nto her heart. “Yesterday is as to-morrow in the Forever.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Lilian! if I could reply to you in words as akin to poetry as your\r\nown!”\r\n\r\n“Fie! you who affect not to care for poetry!”\r\n\r\n“That was before you went away; before I missed you from my eyes, from\r\nmy life; before I was quite conscious how precious you were to me, more\r\nprecious than common words can tell! Yes, there is one period in love\r\nwhen all men are poets, however the penury of their language may belie\r\nthe luxuriance of their fancies. What would become of me if you ceased\r\nto love me?”\r\n\r\n“Or of me, if you could cease to love?”\r\n\r\n“And somehow it seems to me this evening as if my heart drew nearer to\r\nyou,--nearer as if for shelter.”\r\n\r\n“It is sympathy,” said she, with tremulous eagerness,--“that sort of\r\nmysterious sympathy which I have often heard you deny or deride; for I,\r\ntoo, feel drawn nearer to you, as if there were a storm at hand. I was\r\noppressed by an indescribable terror in returning home, and the moment I\r\nsaw you there came a sense of protection.”\r\n\r\nHer head sank on my shoulder: we were silent some moments; then we both\r\nrose by the same involuntary impulse, and round her slight form I twined\r\nmy strong arm of man. And now we are winding slow under the lilacs and\r\nacacias that belt the lawn. Lilian has not yet heard of the murder,\r\nwhich forms the one topic of the town, for all tales of violence and\r\nblood affected her as they affect a fearful child. Mrs. Ashleigh,\r\ntherefore, had judiciously concealed from her the letters and the\r\njournals by which the dismal news had been carried to herself. I need\r\nscarcely say that the grim subject was not broached by me. In fact,\r\nmy own mind escaped from the events which had of late so perplexed\r\nand tormented it; the tranquillity of the scene, the bliss of Lilian’s\r\npresence, had begun to chase away even that melancholy foreboding which\r\nhad overshadowed me in the first moments of our reunion. So we came\r\ngradually to converse of the future,--of the day, not far distant, when\r\nwe two should be as one. We planned our bridal excursion. We would visit\r\nthe scenes endeared to her by song, to me by childhood,--the banks\r\nand waves of my native Windermere,--our one brief holiday before life\r\nreturned to labour, and hearts now so disquieted by hope and joy settled\r\ndown to the calm serenity of home.\r\n\r\nAs we thus talked, the moon, nearly rounded to her full, rose amidst\r\nskies without a cloud. We paused to gaze on her solemn haunting beauty,\r\nas where are the lovers who have not paused to gaze? We were then on the\r\nterrace walk, which commanded a view of the town below. Before us was\r\na parapet wall, low on the garden side, but inaccessible on the outer\r\nside, forming part of a straggling irregular street that made one of\r\nthe boundaries dividing Abbey Hill from Low Town. The lamps of the\r\nthoroughfares, in many a line and row beneath us, stretched far away,\r\nobscured, here and there, by intervening roofs and tall church towers.\r\nThe hum of the city came to our ears, low and mellowed into a lulling\r\nsound. It was not displeasing to be reminded that there was a world\r\nwithout, as close and closer we drew each to each,--worlds to one\r\nanother! Suddenly there carolled forth the song of a human voice,--a\r\nwild, irregular, half-savage melody, foreign, uncomprehended words,--air\r\nand words not new to me. I recognized the voice and chant of Margrave. I\r\nstarted, and uttered an angry exclamation.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” whispered Lilian, and I felt her frame shiver within my\r\nencircling arm. “Hush! listen! Yes; I have heard that voice before--last\r\nnight--”\r\n\r\n“Last night! you were not here; you were more than a hundred miles\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n“I heard it in a dream! Hush, hush!”\r\n\r\nThe song rose louder; impossible to describe its effect, in the midst\r\nof the tranquil night, chiming over the serried rooftops, and under\r\nthe solitary moon. It was not like the artful song of man, for it was\r\ndefective in the methodical harmony of tune; it was not like the song of\r\nthe wild-bird, for it had no monotony in its sweetness: it was wandering\r\nand various as the sounds from an AEolian harp. But it affected the\r\nsenses to a powerful degree, as in remote lands and in vast solitudes I\r\nhave since found the note of the mocking-bird, suddenly heard, affects\r\nthe listener half with delight, half with awe, as if some demon creature\r\nof the desert were mimicking man for its own merriment. The chant now\r\nhad changed into an air of defying glee, of menacing exultation; it\r\nmight have been the triumphant war-song of some antique barbarian race.\r\nThe note was sinister; a shadow passed through me, and Lilian had closed\r\nher eyes, and was sighing heavily; then with a rapid change, sweet as\r\nthe coo with which an Arab mother lulls her babe to sleep, the melody\r\ndied away. “There, there, look,” murmured Lilian, moving from me, “the\r\nsame I saw last night in sleep; the same I saw in the space above, on\r\nthe evening I first knew you!”\r\n\r\nHer eyes were fixed, her hand raised; my look followed hers, and rested\r\non the face and form of Margrave. The moon shone full upon him, so full\r\nas if concentrating all its light upon his image. The place on which\r\nhe stood (a balcony to the upper story of a house about fifty yards\r\ndistant) was considerably above the level of the terrace from which we\r\ngazed on him. His arms were folded on his breast, and he appeared to be\r\nlooking straight towards us. Even at that distance, the lustrous youth\r\nof his countenance appeared to me terribly distinct, and the light of\r\nhis wondrous eye seemed to rest upon us in one lengthened, steady ray\r\nthrough the limpid moonshine. Involuntarily I seized Lilian’s hand, and\r\ndrew her away almost by force, for she was unwilling to move, and as\r\nI led her back, she turned her head to look round; I, too, turned in\r\njealous rage! I breathed more freely. Margrave had disappeared!\r\n\r\n“How came he there? It is not his hotel. Whose house is it?” I said\r\naloud, though speaking to myself.\r\n\r\nLilian remained silent, her eyes fixed upon the ground as if in deep\r\nrevery. I took her hand; it did not return my pressure. I felt cut to\r\nthe heart when she drew coldly from me that hand, till then so frankly\r\ncordial. I stopped short: “Lilian, what is this? you are chilled towards\r\nme. Can the mere sound of that man’s voice, the mere glimpse of that\r\nman’s face, have--” I paused; I did not dare to complete my question.\r\n\r\nLilian lifted her eyes to mine, and I saw at once in those eyes a\r\nchange. Their look was cold; not haughty, but abstracted. “I do not\r\nunderstand you,” she said, in a weary, listless accent. “It is growing\r\nlate; I must go in.”\r\n\r\nSo we walked on moodily, no longer arm in arm, nor hand in hand. Then it\r\noccurred to me that, the next day, Lilian would be in that narrow world\r\nof society; that there she could scarcely fail to hear of Margrave, to\r\nmeet, to know him. Jealousy seized me with all its imaginary terrors,\r\nand amidst that jealousy, a nobler, purer apprehension for herself.\r\nHad I been Lilian’s brother instead of her betrothed, I should not have\r\ntrembled less to foresee the shadow of Margrave’s mysterious influence\r\npassing over a mind so predisposed to the charm which Mystery itself\r\nhas for those whose thoughts fuse their outlines in fancies, whose world\r\nmelts away into Dreamland. Therefore I spoke.\r\n\r\n“Lilian, at the risk of offending you-alas! I have never done so before\r\nthis night--I must address to you a prayer which I implore you not to\r\nregard as the dictate of a suspicion unworthy you and myself. The person\r\nwhom you have just heard and seen is, at present, much courted in the\r\ncircles of this town. I entreat you not to permit any one to introduce\r\nhim to you. I entreat you not to know him. I cannot tell you all my\r\nreasons for this petition; enough that I pledge you my honour that those\r\nreasons are grave. Trust, then, in my truth, as I trust in yours. Be\r\nassured that I stretch not the rights which your heart has bestowed\r\nupon mine in the promise I ask, as I shall be freed from all fear by a\r\npromise which I know will be sacred when once it is given.”\r\n\r\n“What promise?” asked Lilian, absently, as if she had not heard my\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“What promise? Why, to refuse all acquaintance with that man; his name\r\nis Margrave. Promise me, dearest, promise me.”\r\n\r\n“Why is your voice so changed?” said Lilian. “Its tone jars on my ear,”\r\n she added, with a peevishness so unlike her, that it startled me more\r\nthan it offended; and without a word further, she quickened her pace,\r\nand entered the house.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the evening we were both taciturn and distant towards\r\neach other. In vain Mrs. Ashleigh kindly sought to break down our mutual\r\nreserve. I felt that I had the right to be resentful, and I clung to\r\nthat right the more because Lilian made no attempt at reconciliation.\r\nThis, too, was wholly unlike herself, for her temper was ordinarily\r\nsweet,--sweet to the extreme of meekness; saddened if the slightest\r\nmisunderstanding between us had ever vexed me, and yearning to ask\r\nforgiveness if a look or a word had pained me. I was in hopes that,\r\nbefore I went away, peace between us would be restored. But long ere her\r\nusual hour for retiring to rest, she rose abruptly, and, complaining\r\nof fatigue and headache, wished me “good-night,” and avoided the hand I\r\nsorrowfully held out to her as I opened the door.\r\n\r\n“You must have been very unkind to poor Lilian,” said Mrs. Ashleigh,\r\nbetween jest and earnest, “for I never saw her so cross to you before.\r\nAnd the first day of her return, too!”\r\n\r\n“The fault is not mine,” said I, somewhat sullenly; “I did but ask\r\nLilian, and that as a humble prayer, not to make the acquaintance of\r\na stranger in this town against whom I have reasons for distrust and\r\naversion. I know not why that prayer should displease her.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I. Who is the stranger?”\r\n\r\n“A person who calls himself Margrave. Let me at least entreat you to\r\navoid him!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have no desire to make acquaintance with strangers. But, now\r\nLilian is gone, do tell me all about this dreadful murder. The servants\r\nare full of it, and I cannot keep it long concealed from Lilian. I was\r\nin hopes that you would have broken it to her.”\r\n\r\nI rose impatiently; I could not bear to talk thus of an event the\r\ntragedy of which was associated in my mind with circumstances so\r\nmysterious. I became agitated and even angry when Mrs. Ashleigh\r\npersisted in rambling woman-like inquiries,--“Who was suspected of\r\nthe deed? Who did I think had committed it? What sort of a man was Sir\r\nPhilip? What was that strange story about a casket?” Breaking from such\r\ninterrogations, to which I could give but abrupt and evasive answers, I\r\nseized my hat and took my departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nLetter from Allen Fenwick to Lilian Ashleigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “I have promised to go to Derval Court to-day, and shall not return\r\n    till to-morrow.  I cannot bear the thought that so many hours should\r\n    pass away with one feeling less kind than usual resting like a cloud\r\n    upon you and me.  Lilian, if I offended you, forgive me!  Send me one\r\n    line to say so!--one line which I can place next to my heart and\r\n    cover with grateful kisses till we meet again!”\r\n\r\nReply.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “I scarcely know what you mean, nor do I quite understand my own state\r\n    of mind at this moment.  It cannot be that I love you less--and\r\n    yet--but I will not write more now.  I feel glad that we shall not\r\n    meet for the next day or so, and then I hope to be quite recovered.  I\r\n    am not well at this moment.  Do not ask me to forgive you; but if it\r\n    is I who am in fault, forgive me, oh, forgive me, Allen!”\r\n\r\nAnd with this unsatisfactory note, not worn next to my heart, not\r\ncovered with kisses, but thrust crumpled into my desk like a creditor’s\r\nunwelcome bill, I flung myself on my horse and rode to Derval Court.\r\nI am naturally proud; my pride came now to my aid. I felt bitterly\r\nindignant against Lilian, so indignant that I resolved on my return to\r\nsay to her, “If in those words, ‘And yet,’ you implied a doubt whether\r\nyou loved me less, I cancel your vows, I give you back your freedom.”\r\n And I could have passed from her threshold with a firm foot, though with\r\nthe certainty that I should never smile again.\r\n\r\nDoes her note seem to you who may read these pages to justify such\r\nresentment? Perhaps not. But there is an atmosphere in the letters\r\nof the one we love which we alone--we who love--can feel, and in the\r\natmosphere of that letter I felt the chill of the coming winter.\r\n\r\nI reached the park lodge of Derval Court late in the day. I had occasion\r\nto visit some patients whose houses lay scattered many miles apart,\r\nand for that reason, as well as from the desire for some quick bodily\r\nexercise which is so natural an effect of irritable perturbation of\r\nmind, I had made the journey on horseback instead of using a carriage\r\nthat I could not have got through the lanes and field-paths by which\r\nalone the work set to myself could be accomplished in time.\r\n\r\nJust as I entered the park, an uneasy thought seized hold of me with\r\nthe strength which is ascribed to presentiments. I had passed through\r\nmy study (which has been so elaborately described) to my stables, as\r\nI generally did when I wanted my saddle-horse, and, in so doing, had\r\ndoubtless left open the gate to the iron palisade, and probably the\r\nwindow of the study itself. I had been in this careless habit for\r\nseveral years, without ever once having cause for self-reproach. As I\r\nbefore said, there was nothing in my study to tempt a thief; the\r\nstudy was shut out from the body of the house, and the servant sure at\r\nnightfall both to close the window and lock the gate; yet now, for the\r\nfirst time, I felt an impulse, urgent, keen, and disquieting, to ride\r\nback to the town, and see those precautions taken. I could not guess\r\nwhy, but something whispered to me that my neglect had exposed me to\r\nsome great danger. I even checked my horse and looked at my watch; too\r\nlate!--already just on the stroke of Strahan’s dinner-hour as fixed in\r\nhis note; my horse, too, was fatigued and spent: besides, what folly!\r\nwhat bearded man can believe in the warnings of a “presentiment”? I\r\npushed on, and soon halted before the old-fashioned flight of stairs\r\nthat led up to the Hall. Here I was accosted by the old steward; he had\r\njust descended the stairs, and as I dismounted he thrust his arm into\r\nmine unceremoniously, and drew me a little aside.\r\n\r\n“Doctor, I was right; it was his ghost that I saw by the iron door of\r\nthe mausoleum. I saw it again at the same place last night, but I had no\r\nfit then. Justice on his murderer! Blood for blood!”\r\n\r\n“Ay!” said I, sternly; for if I suspected Margrave before, I felt\r\nconvinced now that the inexpiable deed was his. Wherefore convinced?\r\nSimply because I now hated him more, and hate is so easily convinced!\r\n“Lilian! Lilian!” I murmured to myself that name; the flame of my hate\r\nwas fed by my jealousy. “Ay!” said I, sternly, “murder will out.”\r\n\r\n“What are the police about?” said the old man, querulously; “days pass\r\non days, and no nearer the truth. But what does the new owner care? He\r\nhas the rents and acres; what does he care for the dead? I will never\r\nserve another master. I have just told Mr. Strahan so. How do I know\r\nwhether he did not do the deed? Who else had an interest in it?”\r\n\r\n“Hush, hush!” I cried; “you do not know how wildly you are talking.”\r\n\r\nThe old man stared at me, shook his head, released my arm, and strode\r\naway.\r\n\r\nA labouring man came out of the garden, and having unbuckled the\r\nsaddle-bags, which contained the few things required for so short a\r\nvisit, I consigned my horse to his care, and ascended the perron.\r\nThe old housekeeper met me in the hall, and conducted me up the great\r\nstaircase, showed me into a bedroom prepared for me, and told me that\r\nMr. Strahan was already waiting dinner for me. I should find him in the\r\nstudy. I hastened to join him. He began apologizing, very unnecessarily,\r\nfor the state of his establishment. He had as yet engaged no new\r\nservants. The housekeeper with the help of a housemaid did all the work.\r\n\r\nRichard Strahan at college had been as little distinguishable from other\r\nyoung men as a youth neither rich nor poor, neither clever nor stupid,\r\nneither handsome nor ugly, neither audacious sinner nor formal saint,\r\npossibly could be.\r\n\r\nYet, to those who understood him well, he was not without some of those\r\nmoral qualities by which a youth of mediocre intellect often matures\r\ninto a superior man.\r\n\r\nHe was, as Sir Philip had been rightly informed, thoroughly honest\r\nand upright. But with a strong sense of duty, there was also a certain\r\nlatent hardness. He was not indulgent. He had outward frankness with\r\nacquaintances, but was easily roused to suspicion. He had much of the\r\nthriftiness and self-denial of the North countryman, and I have no doubt\r\nthat he had lived with calm content and systematic economy on an income\r\nwhich made him, as a bachelor, independent of his nominal profession,\r\nbut would not have sufficed, in itself, for the fitting maintenance of a\r\nwife and family. He was, therefore, still single.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me even during the few minutes in which we conversed before\r\ndinner was announced, that his character showed a new phase with his new\r\nfortunes. He talked in a grandiose style of the duties of station and\r\nthe woes of wealth. He seemed to be very much afraid of spending, and\r\nstill more appalled at the idea of being cheated. His temper, too, was\r\nruffled; the steward had given him notice to quit. Mr. Jeeves, who had\r\nspent the morning with him, had said the steward would be a great loss,\r\nand a steward at once sharp and honest was not to be easily found.\r\n\r\nWhat trifles can embitter the possession of great goods! Strahan had\r\ntaken a fancy to the old house; it was conformable to his notions, both\r\nof comfort and pomp, and Sir Philip had expressed a desire that the old\r\nhouse should be pulled down. Strahan had inspected the plans for the new\r\nmansion to which Sir Philip had referred, and the plans did not please\r\nhim; on the contrary, they terrified.\r\n\r\n“Jeeves says that I could not build such a house under L70,000 or\r\nL80,000, and then it will require twice the establishment which will\r\nsuffice for this. I shall be ruined,” cried the man who had just come\r\ninto possession of at least ten thousand a year.\r\n\r\n“Sir Philip did not enjoin you to pull down the old house; he only\r\nadvised you to do so. Perhaps he thought the site less healthy than\r\nthat which he proposes for a new building, or was aware of some other\r\ndrawback to the house, which you may discover later. Wait a little and\r\nsee before deciding.”\r\n\r\n“But, at all events, I suppose I must pull down this curious old\r\nroom,--the nicest part of the old house!”\r\n\r\nStrahan, as he spoke, looked wistfully round at the quaint oak\r\nchimneypiece; the carved ceiling; the well-built solid walls, with\r\nthe large mullion casement, opening so pleasantly on the sequestered\r\ngardens. He had ensconced himself in Sir Philip’s study, the chamber in\r\nwhich the once famous mystic, Forman, had found a refuge.\r\n\r\n“So cozey a room for a single man!” sighed Strahan. “Near the stables\r\nand dog-kennels, too! But I suppose I must pull it down. I am not bound\r\nto do so legally; it is no condition of the will. But in honour and\r\ngratitude I ought not to disobey poor Sir Philip’s positive injunction.”\r\n\r\n“Of that,” said I, gravely, “there cannot be a doubt.” Here our\r\nconversation was interrupted by Mrs. Gates, who informed us that dinner\r\nwas served in the library. Wine of great age was brought from the long\r\nneglected cellars; Strahan filled and re-filled his glass, and, warmed\r\ninto hilarity, began to talk of bringing old college friends around him\r\nin the winter season, and making the roof-tree ring with laughter and\r\nsong once more.\r\n\r\nTime wore away, and night had long set in, when Strahan at last rose\r\nfrom the table, his speech thick and his tongue unsteady. We returned to\r\nthe study, and I reminded my host of the special object of my visit to\r\nhim,--namely, the inspection of Sir Philip’s manuscript.\r\n\r\n“It is tough reading,” said Strahan; “better put it off till tomorrow.\r\nYou will stay here two or three days.”\r\n\r\n“No; I must return to L---- to-morrow. I cannot absent myself from\r\nmy patients. And it is the more desirable that no time should be lost\r\nbefore examining the contents of the manuscript, because probably they\r\nmay give some clew to the detection of the murderer.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you think that?” cried Strahan, startled from the drowsiness\r\nthat was creeping over him.\r\n\r\n“Because the manuscript may show that Sir Philip had some enemy, and who\r\nbut an enemy could have had a motive for such a crime? Come, bring forth\r\nthe book. You of all men are bound to be alert in every research\r\nthat may guide the retribution of justice to the assassin of your\r\nbenefactor.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes. I will offer a reward of L5,000 for the discovery. Allen,\r\nthat wretched old steward had the insolence to tell me that I was the\r\nonly man in the world who could have an interest in the death of his\r\nmaster; and he looked at me as if he thought that I had committed\r\nthe crime. You are right; it becomes me, of all men, to be alert. The\r\nassassin must be found. He must hang.”\r\n\r\nWhile thus speaking, Strahan had risen, unlocked a desk, which stood on\r\none of the safes, and drawn forth a thick volume, the contents of which\r\nwere protected by a clasp and lock. Strahan proceeded to open this lock\r\nby one of a bunch of keys, which he said had been found on Sir Philip’s\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n“There, Allen, this is the memoir. I need not tell you what store I\r\nplace on it,--not, between you and me, that I expect it will warrant\r\npoor Sir Philip’s high opinion of his own scientific discoveries; that\r\npart of his letter seems to me very queer, and very flighty. But he\r\nevidently set his heart on the publication of his work, in part if\r\nnot in whole; and, naturally, I must desire to comply with a wish so\r\ndistinctly intimated by one to whom I owe so much. I beg you, therefore,\r\nnot to be too fastidious. Some valuable hints in medicine, I have reason\r\nto believe, the manuscript will contain, and those may help you in your\r\nprofession, Allen.”\r\n\r\n“You have reason to believe! Why?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a charming young fellow, who, with most of the other gentry\r\nresident at L----, called on me at my hotel, told me that he had\r\ntravelled in the East, and had there heard much of Sir Philip’s\r\nknowledge of chemistry, and the cures it had enabled him to perform.”\r\n\r\n“You speak of Mr. Margrave. He called on you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You did not, I trust, mention to him the existence of Sir Philip’s\r\nmanuscript.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I did; and I said you had promised to examine it. He seemed\r\ndelighted at that, and spoke most highly of your peculiar fitness for\r\nthe task.”\r\n\r\n“Give me the manuscript,” said I, abruptly, “and after I have looked at\r\nit to-night, I may have something to say to you tomorrow in reference to\r\nMr. Margrave.”\r\n\r\n“There is the book,” said Strahan; “I have just glanced at it, and find\r\nmuch of it written in Latin; and I am ashamed to say that I have so\r\nneglected the little Latin I learned in our college days that I could\r\nnot construe what I looked at.”\r\n\r\nI sat down and placed the book before me; Strahan fell into a doze, from\r\nwhich he was wakened by the housekeeper, who brought in the tea-things.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Strahan, languidly, “do you find much in the book that\r\nexplains the many puzzling riddles in poor Sir Philip’s eccentric life\r\nand pursuits?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I. “Do not interrupt me.”\r\n\r\nStrahan again began to doze, and the housekeeper asked if we should want\r\nanything more that night, and if I thought I could find my way to my\r\nbedroom.\r\n\r\nI dismissed her impatiently, and continued to read. Strahan woke up\r\nagain as the clock struck eleven, and finding me still absorbed in the\r\nmanuscript, and disinclined to converse, lighted his candle, and telling\r\nme to replace the manuscript in the desk when I had done with it, and be\r\nsure to lock the desk and take charge of the key, which he took off the\r\nbunch and gave me, went upstairs, yawning.\r\n\r\nI was alone in the wizard Forman’s chamber, and bending over a stranger\r\nrecord than had ever excited my infant wonder, or, in later years,\r\nprovoked my sceptic smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nThe Manuscript was written in a small and peculiar handwriting, which,\r\nthough evidently by the same person whose letter to Strahan I had read,\r\nwas, whether from haste or some imperfection in the ink, much more hard\r\nto decipher. Those parts of the Memoir which related to experiments, or\r\nalleged secrets in Nature, that the writer intimated a desire to submit\r\nexclusively to scholars or men of science, were in Latin,--and Latin\r\nwhich, though grammatically correct, was frequently obscure. But all\r\nthat detained the eye and attention on the page necessarily served to\r\nimpress the contents more deeply on remembrance.\r\n\r\nThe narrative commenced with the writer’s sketch of his childhood. Both\r\nhis parents had died before he attained his seventh year. The orphan\r\nhad been sent by his guardians to a private school, and his holidays had\r\nbeen passed at Derval Court. Here his earliest reminiscences were those\r\nof the quaint old room, in which I now sat, and of his childish wonder\r\nat the inscription on the chimneypiece--who and what was the Simon\r\nForman who had there found a refuge from persecution? Of what nature\r\nwere the studies he had cultivated, and the discoveries he boasted to\r\nhave made?\r\n\r\nWhen he was about sixteen, Philip Derval had begun to read the many\r\nmystic books which the library contained; but without other result\r\non his mind than the sentiment of disappointment and disgust. The\r\nimpressions produced on the credulous imagination of childhood vanished.\r\nHe went to the University; was sent abroad to travel: and on his return\r\ntook that place in the circles of London which is so readily conceded to\r\na young idler of birth and fortune. He passed quickly over that period\r\nof his life, as one of extravagance and dissipation, from which he was\r\nfirst drawn by the attachment for his cousin to which his letter to\r\nStrahan referred. Disappointed in the hopes which that affection had\r\nconceived, and his fortune impaired, partly by some years of reckless\r\nprofusion, and partly by the pecuniary sacrifices at which he had\r\neffected his cousin’s marriage with another, he retired to Derval Court,\r\nto live there in solitude and seclusion. On searching for some old\r\ntitle-deeds required for a mortgage, he chanced upon a collection of\r\nmanuscripts much discoloured, and, in part, eaten away by moth or damp.\r\nThese, on examination, proved to be the writings of Forman. Some of\r\nthem were astrological observations and predictions; some were upon the\r\nnature of the Cabbala; some upon the invocation of spirits and the magic\r\nof the dark ages. All had a certain interest, for they were interspersed\r\nwith personal remarks, anecdotes of eminent actors in a very stirring\r\ntime, and were composed as Colloquies, in imitation of Erasmus,--the\r\nsecond person in the dialogue being Sir Miles Derval, the patron and\r\npupil; the first person being Forman, the philosopher and expounder.\r\n\r\nBut along with these shadowy lucubrations were treatises of a more\r\nuncommon and a more startling character,--discussions on various occult\r\nlaws of nature, and detailed accounts of analytical experiments. These\r\nopened a new, and what seemed to Sir Philip a practical, field of\r\ninquiry,--a true border-land between natural science and imaginative\r\nspeculation. Sir Philip had cultivated philosophical science at the\r\nUniversity; he resumed the study, and tested himself the truth of\r\nvarious experiments suggested by Forman. Some, to his surprise, proved\r\nsuccessful, some wholly failed. These lucubrations first tempted the\r\nwriter of the memoir towards the studies in which the remainder of his\r\nlife had been consumed. But he spoke of the lucubrations themselves\r\nas valuable only where suggestive of some truths which Forman had\r\naccidentally approached, without being aware of their true nature and\r\nimportance. They were debased by absurd puerilities, and vitiated by the\r\nvain and presumptuous ignorance which characterized the astrology of the\r\nmiddle ages. For these reasons the writer intimated his intention (if\r\nhe lived to return to England) to destroy Forman’s manuscripts, together\r\nwith sundry other books, and a few commentaries of his own upon studies\r\nwhich had for a while misled him,--all now deposited in the safes of the\r\nroom in which I sat.\r\n\r\nAfter some years passed in the retirement of Derval Court, Sir Philip\r\nwas seized with the desire to travel, and the taste he had imbibed for\r\noccult studies led him towards those Eastern lands in which they took\r\ntheir origin, and still retain their professors.\r\n\r\nSeveral pages of the manuscript were now occupied with minute statements\r\nof the writer’s earlier disappointment in the objects of his singular\r\nresearch. The so-called magicians, accessible to the curiosity of\r\nEuropean travellers, were either but ingenious jugglers, or produced\r\neffects that perplexed him by practices they had mechanically learned,\r\nbut of the rationale of which they were as ignorant as himself. It was\r\nnot till he had resided some considerable time in the East, and acquired\r\na familiar knowledge of its current languages and the social habits of\r\nits various populations, that he became acquainted with men in whom he\r\nrecognized earnest cultivators of the lore which tradition ascribes to\r\nthe colleges and priesthoods of the ancient world,--men generally living\r\nremote from others, and seldom to be bribed by money to exhibit their\r\nmarvels or divulge their secrets. In his intercourse with these sages,\r\nSir Philip arrived at the conviction that there does exist an art of\r\nmagic, distinct from the guile of the conjuror, and applying to certain\r\nlatent powers and affinities in nature,--a philosophy akin to that which\r\nwe receive in our acknowledged schools, inasmuch as it is equally based\r\non experiment, and produces from definite causes definite results. In\r\nsupport of this startling proposition, Sir Philip now devoted more than\r\nhalf his volume to the details of various experiments, to the process\r\nand result of which he pledged his guarantee as the actual operator. As\r\nmost of these alleged experiments appeared to me wholly incredible, and\r\nas all of them were unfamiliar to my practical experience, and\r\ncould only be verified or falsified by tests that would require no\r\ninconsiderable amount of time and care, I passed with little heed over\r\nthe pages in which they were set forth. I was impatient to arrive at\r\nthat part of the manuscript which might throw light on the mystery in\r\nwhich my interest was the keenest. What were the links which connected\r\nthe existence of Margrave with the history of Sir Philip Derval? Thus\r\nhurrying on, page after page, I suddenly, towards the end of the volume,\r\ncame upon a name that arrested all my attention,--Haroun of Aleppo. He\r\nwho has read the words addressed to me in my trance may well conceive\r\nthe thrill that shot through my heart when I came upon that name, and\r\nwill readily understand how much more vividly my memory retains that\r\npart of the manuscript to which I now proceed, than all which had gone\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “It was,” wrote Sir Philip, “in an obscure suburb of Aleppo that I at\r\n    length met with the wonderful man from whom I have acquired a\r\n    knowledge immeasurably more profound and occult than that which may be\r\n    tested in the experiments to which I have devoted so large a share of\r\n    this memoir.  Haroun of Aleppo had, indeed, mastered every secret in\r\n    nature which the nobler, or theurgic, magic seeks to fathom.\r\n\r\n   “He had discovered the great Principle of Animal Life, which had\r\n    hitherto baffled the subtlest anatomist.  Provided only that the great\r\n    organs were not irreparably destroyed, there was no disease that he\r\n    could not cure; no decrepitude to which he could not restore vigour:\r\n    yet his science was based on the same theory as that espoused by the\r\n    best professional practitioner of medicine, namely, that the true art\r\n    of healing is to assist nature to throw off the disease; to summon, as\r\n    it were, the whole system to eject the enemy that has fastened on a\r\n    part.  And thus his processes, though occasionally varying in the\r\n    means employed, all combined in this,--namely, the re-invigourating\r\n    and recruiting of the principle of life.”\r\n\r\nNo one knew the birth or origin of Haroun; no one knew his age. In\r\noutward appearance he was in the strength and prime of mature manhood;\r\nbut, according to testimonies in which the writer of the memoir\r\nexpressed a belief that, I need scarcely say, appeared to me egregiously\r\ncredulous, Haroun’s existence under the same name, and known by the same\r\nrepute, could be traced back to more than a hundred years. He told Sir\r\nPhilip that he had thrice renewed his own life, and had resolved to do\r\nso no more; he had grown weary of living on. With all his gifts, Haroun\r\nowned himself to be consumed by a profound melancholy. He complained\r\nthat there was nothing new to him under the sun; he said that, while\r\nhe had at his command unlimited wealth, wealth had ceased to bestow\r\nenjoyment, and he preferred living as simply as a peasant; he had tired\r\nout all the affections and all the passions of the human heart; he was\r\nin the universe as in a solitude. In a word, Haroun would often repeat,\r\nwith mournful solemnity: “‘The soul is not meant to inhabit this earth\r\nand in fleshy tabernacle for more than the period usually assigned to\r\nmortals; and when by art in repairing the walls of the body we so retain\r\nit, the soul repines, becomes inert or dejected. He only,” said Haroun,\r\n“would feel continued joy in continued existence who could preserve in\r\nperfection the sensual part of man, with such mind or reason as may\r\nbe independent of the spiritual essence, but whom soul itself has\r\nquitted!--man, in short, as the grandest of the animals, but without the\r\nsublime discontent of earth, which is the peculiar attribute of soul.”\r\n\r\nOne evening Sir Philip was surprised to find at Haroun’s house another\r\nEuropean. He paused in his narrative to describe this man. He said\r\nthat for three or four years previously he had heard frequent mention,\r\namongst the cultivators of magic, of an orientalized Englishman engaged\r\nin researches similar to his own, and to whom was ascribed a terrible\r\nknowledge in those branches of the art which, even in the East, are\r\ncondemned as instrumental to evil. Sir Philip here distinguished at\r\nlength, as he had so briefly distinguished in his conversation with me,\r\nbetween the two kinds of magic,--that which he alleged to be as pure\r\nfrom sin as any other species of experimental knowledge, and that by\r\nwhich the agencies of witchcraft are invoked for the purposes of guilt.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, to whom the culture of this latter and darker kind of\r\nmagic was ascribed, Sir Philip Derval had never hitherto come across. He\r\nnow met him at the house of Haroun; decrepit, emaciated, bowed down with\r\ninfirmities, and racked with pain. Though little more than sixty, his\r\naspect was that of extreme old age; but still on his face there were\r\nseen the ruins of a once singular beauty, and still, in his mind, there\r\nwas a force that contrasted the decay of the body. Sir Philip had never\r\nmet with an intellect more powerful and more corrupt. The son of a\r\nnotorious usurer, heir to immense wealth, and endowed with the talents\r\nwhich justify ambition, he had entered upon life burdened with the\r\nodium of his father’s name. A duel, to which he had been provoked by\r\nan ungenerous taunt on his origin, but in which a temperament fiercely\r\nvindictive had led him to violate the usages prescribed by the social\r\nlaws that regulate such encounters, had subjected him to a trial in\r\nwhich he escaped conviction either by a flaw in the technicalities of\r\nlegal procedure, or by the compassion of the jury;(1) but the moral\r\npresumptions against him were sufficiently strong to set an indelible\r\nbrand on his honour, and an insurmountable barrier to the hopes which\r\nhis early ambition had conceived. After this trial he had quitted his\r\ncountry, to return to it no more. Thenceforth, much of his life had been\r\npassed out of sight or conjecture of civilized men in remote regions and\r\namongst barbarous tribes. At intervals, however, he had reappeared in\r\nEuropean capitals; shunned by and shunning his equals, surrounded by\r\nparasites, amongst whom were always to be found men of considerable\r\nlearning, whom avarice or poverty subjected to the influences of\r\nhis wealth. For the last nine or ten years he had settled in Persia,\r\npurchased extensive lands, maintained the retinue, and exercised more\r\nthan the power of an Oriental prince. Such was the man who, prematurely\r\nworn out, and assured by physicians that he had not six weeks of life,\r\nhad come to Aleppo with the gaudy escort of an Eastern satrap, had\r\ncaused himself to be borne in his litter to the mud-hut of Haroun the\r\nSage, and now called on the magician, in whose art was his last hope, to\r\nreprieve him from the--grave.\r\n\r\nHe turned round to Sir Philip, when the latter entered the room, and\r\nexclaimed in English, “I am here because you are. Your intimacy with\r\nthis man was known to me. I took your character as the guarantee of his\r\nown. Tell me that I am no credulous dupe. Tell him that I, Louis Grayle,\r\nam no needy petitioner. Tell me of his wisdom; assure him of my wealth.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip looked inquiringly at Haroun, who remained seated on his\r\ncarpet in profound silence.\r\n\r\n“What is it you ask of Haroun?”\r\n\r\n“To live on--to live on! For every year of life he can give me, I will\r\nload these floors with gold.”\r\n\r\n“Gold will not tempt Haroun.”\r\n\r\n“What will?”\r\n\r\n“Ask him yourself; you speak his language.”\r\n\r\n“I have asked him; he vouchsafes me no answer.”\r\n\r\nHaroun here suddenly roused himself as from a revery. He drew from under\r\nhis robe a small phial, from which he let fall a single drop into a\r\ncup of water, and said, “Drink this; send to me tomorrow for such\r\nmedicaments as I may prescribe. Return hither yourself in three days;\r\nnot before!”\r\n\r\nWhen Grayle was gone, Sir Philip, moved to pity, asked Haroun if,\r\nindeed, it were within the compass of his art to preserve life in a\r\nframe that appeared so thoroughly exhausted. Haroun answered, “A\r\nfever may so waste the lamp of life that one ruder gust of air could\r\nextinguish the flame, yet the sick man recovers. This sick man’s\r\nexistence has been one long fever; this sick man can recover.”\r\n\r\n“You will aid him to do so?”\r\n\r\n“Three days hence I will tell you.”\r\n\r\nOn the third day Grayle revisited Haroun, and, at Haroun’s request,\r\nSir Philip came also. Grayle declared that he had already derived\r\nunspeakable relief from the remedies administered; he was lavish in\r\nexpressions of gratitude; pressed large gifts on Haroun, and seemed\r\npained when they were refused. This time Haroun conversed freely,\r\ndrawing forth Grayle’s own irregular, perverted, stormy, but powerful\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nI can best convey the general nature of Grayle’s share in the dialogue\r\nbetween himself, Haroun, and Derval--recorded in the narrative in words\r\nwhich I cannot trust my memory to repeat in detail--by stating the\r\neffect it produced on my own mind. It seemed, while I read, as if\r\nthere passed before me some convulsion of Nature,--a storm, an\r\nearthquake,--outcries of rage, of scorn, of despair, a despot’s\r\nvehemence of will, a rebel’s scoff at authority; yet, ever and anon,\r\nsome swell of lofty thought, some burst of passionate genius,--abrupt\r\nvariations from the vaunt of superb defiance to the wail of intense\r\nremorse.\r\n\r\nThe whole had in it, I know not what of uncouth but colossal,--like the\r\nchant, in the old lyrical tragedy, of one of those mythical giants, who,\r\nproud of descent from Night and Chaos, had held sway over the elements,\r\nwhile still crude and conflicting, to be crushed under the rocks,\r\nupheaved in their struggle, as Order and Harmony subjected a brightening\r\nCreation to the milder influences throned in Olympus. But it was not\r\ntill the later passages of the dialogue in which my interest was now\r\nabsorbed, that the language ascribed to this sinister personage lost\r\na gloomy pathos not the less impressive for the awe with which it was\r\nmingled. For, till then, it seemed to me as if in that tempestuous\r\nnature there were still broken glimpses of starry light; that a\r\ncharacter originally lofty, if irregular and fierce, had been embittered\r\nby early and continuous war with the social world, and had, in that\r\nwar, become maimed and distorted; that, under happier circumstances, its\r\nfiery strength might have been disciplined to good; that even now,\r\nwhere remorse was so evidently poignant, evil could not be irredeemably\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\nAt length all the dreary compassion previously inspired vanished in one\r\nunqualified abhorrence.\r\n\r\nThe subjects discussed changed from those which, relating to the common\r\nworld of men, were within the scope of my reason. Haroun led his\r\nwild guest to boast of his own proficiency in magic, and, despite my\r\nincredulity, I could not overcome the shudder with which fictions,\r\nhowever extravagant, that deal with that dark Unknown abandoned to the\r\nchimeras of poets, will, at night and in solitude, send through the\r\nveins of men the least accessible to imaginary terrors.\r\n\r\nGrayle spoke of the power he had exercised through the agency of evil\r\nspirits,--a power to fascinate and to destroy. He spoke of the aid\r\nrevealed to him, now too late, which such direful allies could afford,\r\nnot only to a private revenge, but to a kingly ambition. Had he acquired\r\nthe knowledge he declared himself to possess before the feebleness of\r\nthe decaying body made it valueless, how he could have triumphed over\r\nthat world which had expelled his youth from its pale! He spoke of means\r\nby which his influence could work undetected on the minds of others,\r\ncontrol agencies that could never betray, and baffle the justice that\r\ncould never discover. He spoke vaguely of a power by which a spectral\r\nreflection of the material body could be cast, like a shadow, to a\r\ndistance; glide through the walls of a prison, elude the sentinels of\r\na camp,--a power that he asserted to be when enforced by concentrated\r\nwill, and acting on the mind, where in each individual temptation\r\nfound mind the weakest--almost infallible in its effect to seduce or to\r\nappall. And he closed these and similar boasts of demoniacal arts, which\r\nI remember too obscurely to repeat, with a tumultuous imprecation on\r\ntheir nothingness to avail against the gripe of death. All this lore he\r\nwould communicate to Haroun, in return for what? A boon shared by the\r\nmeanest peasant,--life, common life; to breathe yet a while the air,\r\nfeel yet a while the sun.\r\n\r\nThen Haroun replied. He said, with a quiet disdain, that the dark art to\r\nwhich Grayle made such boastful pretence was the meanest of all abuses\r\nof knowledge, rightly abandoned, in all ages, to the vilest natures. And\r\nthen, suddenly changing his tone, he spoke, so far as I can remember the\r\nwords assigned to him in the manuscript, to this effect,--\r\n\r\n“Fallen and unhappy wretch, and you ask me for prolonged life!--a\r\nprolonged curse to the world and to yourself. Shall I employ spells to\r\nlengthen the term of the Pestilence, or profane the secrets of Nature to\r\nrestore vigour and youth to the failing energies of Crime?”\r\n\r\nGrayle, as if stunned by the rebuke, fell on his knees with despairing\r\nentreaties that strangely contrasted his previous arrogance. “And it\r\nwas,” he said, “because his life had been evil that he dreaded death. If\r\nlife could be renewed he would repent, he would change; he retracted his\r\nvaunts, he would forsake the arts he had boasted, he would re-enter the\r\nworld as its benefactor.”\r\n\r\n“So ever the wicked man lies to himself when appalled by the shadow of\r\ndeath,” answered Haroun. “But know, by the remorse which preys on thy\r\nsoul, that it is not thy soul that addresses this prayer to me. Couldst\r\nthou hear, through the storms of the Mind, the Soul’s melancholy\r\nwhisper, it would dissuade thee from a wish to live on. While I speak,\r\nI behold it, that Soul,--sad for the stains on its essence, awed by the\r\naccount it must render, but dreading, as the direst calamity, a renewal\r\nof years below, darker stains and yet heavier accounts! Whatever the\r\nsentence it may now undergo, it has a hope for mercy in the remorse\r\nwhich the mind vainly struggles to quell. But darker its doom if longer\r\nretained to earth, yoked to the mind that corrupts it, and enslaved to\r\nthe senses which thou bidst me restore to their tyrannous forces.”\r\n\r\nAnd Grayle bowed his head and covered his face with his hands in silence\r\nand in trembling.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Philip, seized with compassion, pleaded for him. “At least,\r\ncould not the soul have longer time on earth for repentance?” And while\r\nSir Philip was so pleading, Grayle fell prostrate in a swoon like that\r\nof death. When he recovered, his head was leaning on Haroun’s knee, and\r\nhis opening eyes fixed on the glittering phial which Haroun held, and\r\nfrom which his lips had been moistened.\r\n\r\n“Wondrous!” he murmured: “how I feel life flowing back to me. And that,\r\nthen, is the elixir! it is no fable!”\r\n\r\nHis hands stretched greedily as to seize the phial, and he cried\r\nimploringly, “More, more!” Haroun replaced the vessel in the folds of\r\nhis robe, and answered,--\r\n\r\n“I will not renew thy youth, but I will release thee from bodily\r\nsuffering: I will leave the mind and the soul free from the pangs of\r\nthe flesh, to reconcile, if yet possible, their long war. My skill may\r\nafford thee months yet for repentance; Seek, in that interval, to\r\natone for the evil of sixty years; apply thy wealth where it may most\r\ncompensate for injury done, most relieve the indigent, and most aid the\r\nvirtuous. Listen to thy remorse; humble thyself in prayer.”\r\n\r\nGrayle departed, sighing heavily and muttering to himself. The next day\r\nHaroun summoned Sir Philip Derval, and said to him,--\r\n\r\n“Depart to Damascus. In that city the Pestilence has appeared. Go\r\nthither thou, to heal and to save. In this casket are stored the surest\r\nantidotes to the poison of the plague. Of that essence, undiluted and\r\npure, which tempts to the undue prolongation of soul in the prison of\r\nflesh, this casket contains not a drop. I curse not my friend with so\r\nmournful a boon. Thou hast learned enough of my art to know by what\r\nsimples the health of the temperate is easily restored to its balance,\r\nand their path to the grave smoothed from pain. Not more should Man\r\ncovet from Nature for the solace and weal of the body. Nobler gifts far\r\nthan aught for the body this casket contains. Herein are the essences\r\nwhich quicken the life of those duplicate senses that lie dormant\r\nand coiled in their chrysalis web, awaiting the wings of a future\r\ndevelopment,--the senses by which we can see, though not with the eye,\r\nand hear, but not by the ear. Herein are the links between Man’s mind\r\nand Nature’s; herein are secrets more precious even than these,--those\r\nextracts of light which enable the Soul to distinguish itself from the\r\nMind, and discriminate the spiritual life, not more from life carnal\r\nthan life intellectual. Where thou seest some noble intellect, studious\r\nof Nature, intent upon Truth, yet ignoring the fact that all animal life\r\nhas a mind and Man alone on the earth ever asked, and has asked, from\r\nthe hour his step trod the earth, and his eye sought the Heaven, ‘Have\r\nI not a soul; can it perish?’--there, such aids to the soul, in the\r\ninnermost vision vouchsafed to the mind, thou mayst lawfully use. But\r\nthe treasures contained in this casket are like all which a mortal can\r\nwin from the mines he explores,--good or ill in their uses as they pass\r\nto the hands of the good or the evil. Thou wilt never confide them but\r\nto those who will not abuse! and even then, thou art an adept too versed\r\nin the mysteries of Nature not to discriminate between the powers that\r\nmay serve the good to good ends, and the powers that may tempt the\r\ngood--where less wise than experience has made thee and me--to the ends\r\nthat are evil; and not even to thy friend the most virtuous--if less\r\nproof against passion than thou and I have become--wilt thou confide\r\nsuch contents of the casket as may work on the fancy, to deafen the\r\nconscience and imperil the soul.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip took the casket, and with it directions for use, which he did\r\nnot detail. He then spoke to Haroun about Louis Grayle, who had inspired\r\nhim with a mingled sentiment of admiration and abhorrence, of pity and\r\nterror. And Haroun answered thus, repeating the words ascribed to\r\nhim, so far as I can trust, in regard to them--as to all else in this\r\nmarvellous narrative--to a memory habitually tenacious even in ordinary\r\nmatters, and strained to the utmost extent of its power, by the\r\nstrangeness of the ideas presented to it, and the intensity of my\r\npersonal interest in whatever admitted a ray into that cloud which,\r\ngathering fast over my reason, now threatened storm to my affections,--\r\n\r\n“When the mortal deliberately allies himself to the spirits of evil,\r\nhe surrenders the citadel of his being to the guard of its enemies; and\r\nthose who look from without can only dimly guess what passes within\r\nthe precincts abandoned to Powers whose very nature we shrink to\r\ncontemplate, lest our mere gaze should invite them. This man, whom thou\r\npitiest, is not yet everlastingly consigned to the fiends, because\r\nhis soul still struggles against them. His life has been one long war\r\nbetween his intellect, which is mighty, and his spirit, which is feeble.\r\nThe intellect, armed and winged by the passions, has besieged and\r\noppressed the soul; but the soul has never ceased to repine and to\r\nrepent. And at moments it has gained its inherent ascendancy, persuaded\r\nrevenge to drop the prey it had seized, turned the mind astray from\r\nhatred and wrath into unwonted paths of charity and love. In the long\r\ndesert of guilt, there have been green spots and fountains of good. The\r\nfiends have occupied the intellect which invoked them, but they have\r\nnever yet thoroughly mastered the soul which their presence appalls. In\r\nthe struggle that now passes within that breast, amidst the flickers of\r\nwaning mortality, only Allah, whose eye never slumbers, can aid.”\r\n\r\nHaroun then continued, in words yet more strange and yet more deeply\r\ngraved in my memory,--\r\n\r\n“There have been men (thou mayst have known such), who, after an illness\r\nin which life itself seemed suspended, have arisen, as out of a sleep,\r\nwith characters wholly changed. Before, perhaps, gentle and good and\r\ntruthful, they now become bitter, malignant, and false. To the persons\r\nand the things they had before loved, they evince repugnance and\r\nloathing. Sometimes this change is so marked and irrational that their\r\nkindred ascribe it to madness,--not the madness which affects them in\r\nthe ordinary business of life, but that which turns into harshness and\r\ndiscord the moral harmony that results from natures whole and complete.\r\nBut there are dervishes who hold that in that illness, which had for its\r\ntime the likeness of death, the soul itself has passed away, and an evil\r\ngenius has fixed itself into the body and the brain, thus left void of\r\ntheir former tenant, and animates them in the unaccountable change from\r\nthe past to the present existence. Such mysteries have formed no part\r\nof my study, and I tell you the conjecture received in the East without\r\nhazarding a comment whether of incredulity or belief. But if, in this\r\nwar between the mind which the fiends have seized, and the soul which\r\nimplores refuge of Allah; if, while the mind of yon traveller now\r\ncovets life lengthened on earth for the enjoyments it had perverted\r\nits faculties to seek and to find in sin, and covets so eagerly that it\r\nwould shrink from no crime and revolt from no fiend that could promise\r\nthe gift, the soul shudderingly implores to be saved from new guilt,\r\nand would rather abide by the judgment of Allah on the sins that have\r\ndarkened it than pass forever irredeemably away to the demons,--if this\r\nbe so, what if the soul’s petition be heard; what if it rise from the\r\nruins around it; what if the ruins be left to the witchcraft that seeks\r\nto rebuild them? There, if demons might enter, that which they sought\r\nas their prize has escaped them; that which they find would mock them by\r\nits own incompleteness even in evil. In vain might animal life the most\r\nperfect be given to the machine of the flesh; in vain might the mind,\r\nfreed from the check of the soul, be left to roam at will through a\r\nbrain stored with memories of knowledge and skilled in the command of\r\nits faculties; in vain, in addition to all that body and brain bestow on\r\nthe normal condition of man, might unhallowed reminiscences gather all\r\nthe arts and the charms of the sorcery by which the fiends tempted the\r\nsoul, before it fled, through the passions of flesh and the cravings of\r\nmind: the Thing, thus devoid of a soul, would be an instrument of evil,\r\ndoubtless,--but an instrument that of itself could not design, invent,\r\nand complete. The demons themselves could have no permanent hold on\r\nthe perishable materials. They might enter it for some gloomy end which\r\nAllah permits in his inscrutable wisdom; but they could leave it no\r\ntrace when they pass from it, because there is no conscience where\r\nsoul is wanting. The human animal without soul, but otherwise made\r\nfelicitously perfect in its mere vital organization, might ravage and\r\ndestroy, as the tiger and the serpent may destroy and ravage, and,\r\nthe moment after, would sport in the sunlight harmless and rejoicing,\r\nbecause, like the serpent and the tiger, it is incapable of remorse.”\r\n\r\n“Why startle my wonder,” said Derval, “with so fantastic an image?”\r\n\r\n“Because, possibly, the image may come into palpable form! I know, while\r\nI speak to thee, that this miserable man is calling to his aid the evil\r\nsorcery over which he boasts his control. To gain the end he desires, he\r\nmust pass through a crime. Sorcery whispers to him how to pass\r\nthrough it, secure from the detection of man. The soul resists, but\r\nin resisting, is weak against the tyranny of the mind to which it has\r\nsubmitted so long. Question me no more. But if I vanish from thine eyes,\r\nif thou hear that the death which, to my sorrow and in my foolishness I\r\nhave failed to recognize as the merciful minister of Heaven, has removed\r\nme at last from the earth, believe that the pale Visitant was welcome,\r\nand that I humbly accept as a blessed release the lot of our common\r\nhumanity.”\r\n\r\nSir Philip went to Damascus. There he found the pestilence raging, there\r\nhe devoted himself to the cure of the afflicted; in no single instance,\r\nso at least he declared, did the antidotes stored in the casket fail in\r\ntheir effect. The pestilence had passed, his medicaments were exhausted,\r\nwhen the news reached him that Haroun was no more. The Sage had been\r\nfound, one morning, lifeless in his solitary home, and, according to\r\npopular rumour, marks on his throat betrayed the murderous hand of the\r\nstrangler. Simultaneously, Louis Grayle had disappeared from the city,\r\nand was supposed to have shared the fate of Haroun, and been secretly\r\nburied by the assassins who had deprived him of life. Sir Philip\r\nhastened to Aleppo. There he ascertained that on the night in which\r\nHaroun died, Grayle did not disappear alone; with him were also missing\r\ntwo of his numerous suite,--the one, an Arab woman, named Ayesha, who\r\nhad for some years been his constant companion, his pupil and associate\r\nin the mystic practices to which his intellect had been debased, and who\r\nwas said to have acquired a singular influence over him, partly by\r\nher beauty and partly by the tenderness with which she had nursed him\r\nthrough his long decline; the other, an Indian, specially assigned\r\nto her service, of whom all the wild retainers of Grayle spoke with\r\ndetestation and terror. He was believed by them to belong to that\r\nmurderous sect of fanatics whose existence as a community has only\r\nrecently been made known to Europe, and who strangle their unsuspecting\r\nvictim in the firm belief that they thereby propitiate the favour of the\r\ngoddess they serve. The current opinion at Aleppo was, that if those\r\ntwo persons had conspired to murder Haroun, perhaps for the sake of the\r\ntreasures he was said to possess, it was still more certain that they\r\nhad made away with their own English lord, whether for the sake of the\r\njewels he wore about him, or for the sake of treasures less doubtful\r\nthan those imputed to Haroun, and of which the hiding-place would be to\r\nthem much better known.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “I did not share that opinion,” wrote the narrator, “for I assured\r\n    myself that Ayesha sincerely loved her awful master; and that love\r\n    need excite no wonder, for Louis Grayle was one whom if a woman, and\r\n    especially a woman of the East, had once loved, before old age and\r\n    infirmity fell on him, she would love and cherish still more devotedly\r\n    when it became her task to protect the being who, in his day of power\r\n    and command, had exalted his slave into the rank of his pupil and\r\n    companion.  And the Indian whom Grayle had assigned to her service was\r\n    allowed to have that brute kind of fidelity which, though it recoils\r\n    from no crime for a master, refuses all crime against him.\r\n\r\n   “I came to the conclusion that Haroun had been murdered by order\r\n    of Louis Grayle,--for the sake of the elixir of life,--murdered by\r\n    Juma the Strangler; and that Grayle himself had been aided in his\r\n    flight from Aleppo, and tended, through the effects of the\r\n    life-giving drug thus murderously obtained, by the womanly love of the\r\n    Arab woman Ayesha.  These convictions (since I could not, without\r\n    being ridiculed as the wildest of dupes, even hint at the vital\r\n    elixir) I failed to impress on the Eastern officials, or even on a\r\n    countryman of my own whom I chanced to find at Aleppo.  They only\r\n    arrived at what seemed the common-sense verdict,--namely, that Haroun\r\n    might have been strangled, or might have died in a fit (the body,\r\n    little examined, was buried long before I came to Aleppo); and that\r\n    Louis Grayle was murdered by his own treacherous dependents.  But all\r\n    trace of the fugitives was lost.\r\n\r\n   “And now,” wrote Sir Philip, “I will state by what means I discovered\r\n    that Louis Grayle still lived,--changed from age into youth; a new\r\n    form, a new being; realizing, I verily believe, the image which\r\n    Haroun’s words had raised up, in what then seemed to me the\r\n    metaphysics of fantasy,---criminal, without consciousness of crime;\r\n    the dreadest of the mere animal race; an incarnation of the blind\r\n    powers of Nature,--beautiful and joyous, wanton and terrible and\r\n    destroying!  Such as ancient myths have personified in the idols of\r\n    Oriental creeds; such as Nature, of herself, might form man in her\r\n    moments of favour, if man were wholly the animal, and spirit were no\r\n    longer the essential distinction between himself and the races to\r\n    which by superior formation and subtler perceptions he would still be\r\n    the king.\r\n\r\n   “But this being is yet more dire and portentous than the mere animal\r\n    man, for in him are not only the fragmentary memories of a pristine\r\n    intelligence which no mind, unaided by the presence of soul, could\r\n    have originally compassed, but amidst that intelligence are the\r\n    secrets of the magic which is learned through the agencies of spirits\r\n    the most hostile to our race.  And who shall say whether the fiends do\r\n    not enter at their will this void and deserted temple whence the soul\r\n    has departed, and use as their tools, passive and unconscious, all the\r\n    faculties which, skilful in sorcery, still place a mind at the\r\n    control of their malice?\r\n\r\n   “It was in the interest excited in me by the strange and terrible fate\r\n    that befell an Armenian family with which I was slightly acquainted,\r\n    that I first traced--in the creature I am now about to describe, and\r\n    whose course I devote myself to watch, and trust to bring to a\r\n    close--the murderer of Haroun for the sake of the elixir of youth.\r\n\r\n   “In this Armenian family there were three daughters; one of them--”\r\n\r\nI had just read thus far when a dim shadow fell over the page, and a\r\ncold air seemed to breathe on me,--cold, so cold, that my blood halted\r\nin my veins as if suddenly frozen! Involuntarily I started, and looked\r\nup, sure that some ghastly presence was in the room. And then, on the\r\nopposite side of the wall, I beheld an unsubstantial likeness of a human\r\nform. Shadow I call it, but the word is not strictly correct, for it was\r\nluminous, though with a pale shine. In some exhibition in London\r\nthere is shown a curious instance of optical illusion; at the end of\r\na corridor you see, apparently in strong light, a human skull. You are\r\nconvinced it is there as you approach; it is, however, only a reflection\r\nfrom a skull at a distance. The image before me was less vivid, less\r\nseemingly prominent than is the illusion I speak of. I was not deceived.\r\nI felt it was a spectrum, a phantasm; but I felt no less surely that it\r\nwas a reflection from an animate form,--the form and face of Margrave;\r\nit was there, distinct, unmistakable. Conceiving that he himself must\r\nbe behind me, I sought to rise, to turn round, to examine. I could not\r\nmove: limb and muscle were overmastered by some incomprehensible\r\nspell. Gradually my senses forsook me; I became unconscious as well as\r\nmotionless. When I recovered, I heard the clock strike three. I must\r\nhave been nearly two hours insensible! The candles before me were\r\nburning low. My eyes rested on the table; the dead man’s manuscript was\r\ngone!\r\n\r\n(1) The reader will here observe a discrepancy between Mrs. Poyntz’s\r\naccount and Sir Philip Derval’s narrative. According to the former,\r\nLouis Grayle was tried in his absence from England, and sentenced\r\nto three years’ imprisonment, which his flight enabled him to evade.\r\nAccording to the latter, Louis Grayle stood his trial, and obtained an\r\nacquittal. Sir Philip’s account must, at least, be nearer the truth than\r\nthe lady’s, because Louis Grayle could not, according to English law,\r\nhave been tried on a capital charge without being present in court. Mrs.\r\nPoyntz tells her story as a woman generally does tell a story,--sure to\r\nmake a mistake when she touches on a question of law; and--unconsciously\r\nperhaps to herself--the woman of the World warps the facts in her\r\nnarrative so as to save the personal dignity of the hero, who has\r\ncaptivated her interest, not from the moral odium of a great crime, but\r\nthe debasing position of a prisoner at the bar. Allen Fenwick, no doubt,\r\npurposely omits to notice the discrepancy between these two statements,\r\nor to animadvert on the mistake which, in the eyes of a lawyer, would\r\ndiscredit Mrs. Poyntz’s. It is consistent with some of the objects for\r\nwhich Allen Fenwick makes public his Strange Story, to invite the reader\r\nto draw his own inferences from the contradictions by which, even in the\r\nmost commonplace matters (and how much more in any tale of wonder!), a\r\nfact stated by one person is made to differ from the same fact stated by\r\nanother. The rapidity with which a truth becomes transformed into fable,\r\nwhen it is once sent on its travels from lip to lip, is illustrated\r\nby an amusement at this moment in fashion. The amusement is this: In a\r\nparty of eight or ten persons, let one whisper to another an account\r\nof some supposed transaction, or a piece of invented gossip relating to\r\nabsent persons, dead or alive; let the person, who thus first hears the\r\nstory, proceed to whisper it, as exactly as he can remember what he has\r\njust heard, to the next; the next does the same to his neighbour, and so\r\non, till the tale has run the round of the party. Each narrator, as soon\r\nas he has whispered his version of the tale, writes down what he has\r\nwhispered. And though, in this game, no one has had any interest to\r\nmisrepresent, but, on the contrary, each for his own credit’s sake\r\nstrives to repeat what he has heard as faithfully as he can, it will\r\nbe almost invariably found that the story told by the first person has\r\nreceived the most material alterations before it has reached the\r\neighth or the tenth. Sometimes the most important feature of the whole\r\nnarrative is altogether omitted; sometimes a feature altogether new and\r\npreposterously absurd has been added. At the close of the experiment one\r\nis tempted to exclaim, “How, after this, can any of those portions of\r\nhistory which the chronicler took from hearsay be believed?” But, above\r\nall, does not every anecdote of scandal which has passed, not through\r\nten lips, but perhaps through ten thousand, before it has reached us,\r\nbecome quite as perplexing to him who would get at the truth, as the\r\nmarvels he recounts are to the bewildered reason of Fenwick the Sceptic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nThe dead man’s manuscript was gone. But how? A phantom might delude my\r\neye, a human will, though exerted at a distance, might, if the tales\r\nof mesmerism be true, deprive me of movement and of consciousness; but\r\nneither phantom nor mesmeric will could surely remove from the table\r\nbefore me the material substance of the book that had vanished! Was I to\r\nseek explanation in the arts of sorcery ascribed to Louis Grayle in the\r\nnarrative? I would not pursue that conjecture. Against it my reason rose\r\nup half alarmed, half disdainful. Some one must have entered the room,\r\nsome one have removed the manuscript. I looked round. The windows were\r\nclosed, the curtains partly drawn over the shutters, as they were before\r\nmy consciousness had left me: all seemed undisturbed. Snatching up one\r\nof the candles, fast dying out, I went into the adjoining library, the\r\ndesolate state-rooms, into the entrance-hall, and examined the outer\r\ndoor, barred and locked! The robber had left no vestige of his stealthy\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nI resolved to go at once to Strahan’s room and tell him of the loss\r\nsustained. A deposit had been confided to me, and I felt as if there\r\nwere a slur on my honour every moment in which I kept its abstraction\r\nconcealed from him to whom I was responsible for the trust. I hastily\r\nascended the great staircase, grim with faded portraits, and found\r\nmyself in a long corridor opening on my own bedroom; no doubt also on\r\nStrahan’s. Which was his? I knew not. I opened rapidly door after door,\r\npeered into empty chambers, went blundering on, when to the right,\r\ndown a narrow passage. I recognized the signs of my host’s\r\nwhereabouts,--signs familiarly commonplace and vulgar; signs by\r\nwhich the inmate of any chamber in lodging-house or inn makes himself\r\nknown,--a chair before a doorway, clothes negligently thrown on it,\r\nbeside it a pair of shoes. And so ludicrous did such testimony of common\r\nevery-day life, of the habits which Strahan would necessarily have\r\ncontracted in his desultory unluxurious bachelor’s existence,--so\r\nludicrous, I say, did these homely details seem to me, so grotesquely at\r\nvariance with the wonders of which I had been reading, with the wonders\r\nyet more incredible of which I myself had been witness and victim, that\r\nas I turned down the passage, I heard my own unconscious half-hysterical\r\nlaugh; and, startled by the sound of that laugh as if it came from some\r\none else, I paused, my hand on the door, and asked myself: “Do I dream?\r\nAm I awake? And if awake what am I to say to the commonplace mortal I\r\nam about to rouse? Speak to him of a phantom! Speak to him of some weird\r\nspell over this strong frame! Speak to him of a mystic trance in which\r\nhas been stolen what he confided to me, without my knowledge! What will\r\nhe say? What should I have said a few days ago to any man who told such\r\na tale to me?” I did not wait to resolve these questions. I entered the\r\nroom. There was Strahan sound asleep on his bed. I shook him roughly. He\r\nstarted up, rubbed his eyes. “You, Allen,--you! What the deuce?--what ‘s\r\nthe matter?”\r\n\r\n“Strahan, I have been robbed!--robbed of the manuscript you lent me. I\r\ncould not rest till I had told you.”\r\n\r\n“Robbed, robbed! Are you serious?”\r\n\r\nBy this time Strahan had thrown off the bed-clothes, and sat upright,\r\nstaring at me.\r\n\r\nAnd then those questions which my mind had suggested while I was\r\nstanding at his door repeated themselves with double force. Tell this\r\nman, this unimaginative, hard-headed, raw-boned, sandy-haired North\r\ncountryman,--tell this man a story which the most credulous school-girl\r\nwould have rejected as a fable! Impossible!\r\n\r\n“I fell asleep,” said I, colouring and stammering, for the slightest\r\ndeviation from truth was painful to me, “and-and--when I awoke--the\r\nmanuscript was gone. Some one must have entered and committed the\r\ntheft--”\r\n\r\n“Some one entered the house at this hour of the night and then only\r\nstolen a manuscript which could be of no value to him! Absurd! If\r\nthieves have come in it must be for other objects,--for plate, for\r\nmoney. I will dress; we will see!”\r\n\r\nStrahan hurried on his clothes, muttering to himself and avoiding my\r\neye. He was embarrassed. He did not like to say to an old friend what\r\nwas on his mind; but I saw at once that he suspected I had resolved to\r\ndeprive him of the manuscript, and had invented a wild tale in order to\r\nconceal my own dishonesty.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he proceeded to search the house. I followed him in\r\nsilence, oppressed with my own thoughts, and longing for solitude in\r\nmy own chamber. We found no one, no trace of any one, nothing to\r\nexcite suspicion. There were but two female servants sleeping in the\r\nhouse,--the old housekeeper, and a country girl who assisted her. It was\r\nnot possible to suspect either of these persons; but in the course of\r\nour search we opened the doors of their rooms. We saw that they were\r\nboth in bed, both seemingly asleep: it seemed idle to wake and question\r\nthem. When the formality of our futile investigation was concluded,\r\nStrahan stopped at the door of my bedroom, and for the first time fixing\r\nhis eyes on me steadily, said,--\r\n\r\n“Allen Fenwick, I would have given half the fortune I have come\r\ninto rather than this had happened. The manuscript, as you know, was\r\nbequeathed to me as a sacred trust by a benefactor whose slightest wish\r\nit is my duty to observe religiously. If it contained aught valuable to\r\na man of your knowledge and profession, why, you were free to use its\r\ncontents. Let me hope, Allen, that the book will reappear to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nHe said no more, drew himself away from the hand I involuntarily\r\nextended, and walked quickly back towards his own room.\r\n\r\nAlone once more, I sank on a seat, buried my face in my hands, and\r\nstrove in vain to collect into some definite shape my own tumultuous\r\nand disordered thoughts. Could I attach serious credit to the marvellous\r\nnarrative I had read? Were there, indeed, such powers given to man, such\r\ninfluences latent in the calm routine of Nature? I could not believe\r\nit; I must have some morbid affection of the brain; I must be under an\r\nhallucination. Hallucination? The phantom, yes; the trance, yes. But\r\nstill, how came the book gone? That, at least, was not hallucination.\r\n\r\nI left my room the next morning with a vague hope that I should find the\r\nmanuscript somewhere in the study; that, in my own trance, I might\r\nhave secreted it, as sleep-walkers are said to secrete things, without\r\nremembrance of their acts in their waking state.\r\n\r\nI searched minutely in every conceivable place. Strahan found me still\r\nemployed in that hopeless task. He had breakfasted in his own room, and\r\nit was past eleven o’clock when he joined me. His manner was now hard,\r\ncold, and distant, and his suspicion so bluntly shown that my distress\r\ngave way to resentment.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” I cried indignantly, “that you, who have known me\r\nso well, can suspect me of an act so base, and so gratuitously base?\r\nPurloin, conceal a book confided to me, with full power to copy from it\r\nwhatever I might desire, use its contents in any way that might seem to\r\nme serviceable to science, or useful to me in my own calling!”\r\n\r\n“I have not accused you,” answered Strahan, sullenly. “But what are\r\nwe to say to Mr. Jeeves; to all others who know that this manuscript\r\nexisted? Will they believe what you tell me?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Jeeves,” I said, “cannot suspect a fellow-townsman, whose character\r\nis as high as mine, of untruth and theft. And to whom else have you\r\ncommunicated the facts connected with a memoir and a request of so\r\nextraordinary a nature?”\r\n\r\n“To young Margrave; I told you so!”\r\n\r\n“True, true. We need not go farther to find the thief. Margrave has been\r\nin this house more than once. He knows the position of the rooms. You\r\nhave named the robber!”\r\n\r\n“Tut! what on earth could a gay young fellow like Margrave want with\r\na work of such dry and recondite nature as I presume my poor kinsman’s\r\nmemoir must be?”\r\n\r\nI was about to answer, when the door was abruptly opened, and the\r\nservant-girl entered, followed by two men, in whom I recognized the\r\nsuperintendent of the L---- police and the same subordinate who had\r\nfound me by Sir Philip’s corpse.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent came up to me with a grave face, and whispered in my\r\near. I did not at first comprehend him. “Come with you,” I said, “and to\r\nMr. Vigors, the magistrate? I thought my deposition was closed.”\r\n\r\nThe superintendent shook his head. “I have the authority here, Dr.\r\nFenwick.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will come, of course. Has anything new transpired?”\r\n\r\nThe superintendent turned to the servant-girl, who was standing with\r\ngaping mouth and staring eyes.\r\n\r\n“Show us Dr. Fenwick’s room. You had better put up, sir, whatever things\r\nyou have brought here. I will go upstairs with you,” he whispered again.\r\n“Come, Dr. Fenwick, I am in the discharge of my duty.”\r\n\r\nSomething in the man’s manner was so sinister and menacing that I felt\r\nat once that some new and strange calamity had befallen me. I turned\r\ntowards Strahan. He was at the threshold, speaking in a low voice to\r\nthe subordinate policeman, and there was an expression of amazement and\r\nhorror in his countenance. As I came towards him he darted away without\r\na word.\r\n\r\nI went up the stairs, entered my bedroom, the superintendent close\r\nbehind me. As I took up mechanically the few things I had brought\r\nwith me, the police-officer drew them from me with an abruptness that\r\nappeared insolent, and deliberately searched the pockets of the coat\r\nwhich I had worn the evening before, then opened the drawers in the\r\nroom, and even pried into the bed.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked haughtily.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir. Duty. You are-”\r\n\r\n“Well, I am what?”\r\n\r\n“My prisoner; here is the warrant.”\r\n\r\n“Warrant! on what charge?”\r\n\r\n“The murder of Sir Philip Derval.”\r\n\r\n“I--I! Murder!” I could say no more.\r\n\r\nI must hurry over this awful passage in my marvellous record. It is\r\ntorture to dwell on the details; and indeed I have so sought to chase\r\nthem from my recollection, that they only come back to me in hideous\r\nfragments, like the incoherent remains of a horrible dream.\r\n\r\nAll that I need state is as follows: Early on the very morning on which\r\nI had been arrested, a man, a stranger in the town, had privately sought\r\nMr. Vigors, and deposed that on the night of the murder, he had been\r\ntaking refuge from a sudden storm under shelter of the eaves and\r\nbuttresses of a wall adjoining an old archway; that he had heard men\r\ntalking within the archway; had heard one say to the other, “You still\r\nbear me a grudge.” The other had replied, “I can forgive you on one\r\ncondition.” That he then lost much of the conversation that ensued,\r\nwhich was in a lower voice; but he gathered enough to know that the\r\ncondition demanded by the one was the possession of a casket which the\r\nother carried about with him; that there seemed an altercation on this\r\nmatter between the two men, which, to judge by the tones of voice, was\r\nangry on the part of the man demanding the casket; that, finally, this\r\nman said in a loud key, “Do you still refuse?” and on receiving the\r\nanswer, which the witness did not overhear, exclaimed threateningly, “It\r\nis you who will repent,” and then stepped forth from the arch into the\r\nstreet. The rain had then ceased, but by a broad flash of lightning\r\nthe witness saw distinctly the figure of the person thus quitting the\r\nshelter of the arch,--a man of tall stature, powerful frame, erect\r\ncarriage. A little time afterwards, witness saw a slighter and older man\r\ncome forth from the arch, whom he could only examine by the flickering\r\nray of the gas-lamp near the wall, the lightning having ceased, but whom\r\nhe fully believed to be the person he afterwards discovered to be Sir\r\nPhilip Derval.\r\n\r\nHe said that he himself had only arrived at the town a few hours before;\r\na stranger to L----, and indeed to England, having come from the United\r\nStates of America, where he had passed his life from childhood. He had\r\njourneyed on foot to L----, in the hope of finding there some distant\r\nrelatives. He had put up at a small inn, after which he had strolled\r\nthrough the town, when the storm had driven him to seek shelter. He had\r\nthen failed to find his way back to the inn, and after wandering about\r\nin vain, and seeing no one at that late hour of night of whom he could\r\nask the way, he had crept under a portico and slept for two or three\r\nhours. Waking towards the dawn, he had then got up, and again sought to\r\nfind his way to the inn, when he saw, in a narrow street before him,\r\ntwo men, one of whom he recognized as the taller of the two to whose\r\nconversation he had listened under the arch; the other he did not\r\nrecognize at the moment. The taller man seemed angry and agitated, and\r\nhe heard him say, “The casket; I will have it.” There then seemed to be\r\na struggle between these two persons, when the taller one struck down\r\nthe shorter, knelt on his breast, and he caught distinctly the gleam of\r\nsome steel instrument. That he was so frightened that he could not stir\r\nfrom the place, and that though he cried out, he believed his voice was\r\nnot heard. He then saw the taller man rise, the other resting on the\r\npavement motionless; and a minute or so afterwards beheld policemen\r\ncoming to the place, on which he, the witness, walked away. He did not\r\nknow that a murder had been committed; it might be only an assault; it\r\nwas no business of his, he was a stranger. He thought it best not to\r\ninterfere, the police having cognizance of the affair. He found out his\r\ninn; for the next few days he was absent from L---- in search of his\r\nrelations, who had left the town, many years ago, to fix their residence\r\nin one of the neighbouring villages.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, disappointed; none of these relations now survived. He\r\nhad now returned to L----, heard of the murder, was in doubt what to\r\ndo, might get himself into trouble if, a mere stranger, he gave\r\nan unsupported testimony. But, on the day before the evidence was\r\nvolunteered, as he was lounging in the streets, he had seen a gentleman\r\npass by on horseback, in whom he immediately recognized the man who,\r\nin his belief, was the murderer of Sir Philip Derval. He inquired of a\r\nbystander the name of the gentleman; the answer was “Dr. Fenwick.” That,\r\nthe rest of the day, he felt much disturbed in his mind, not liking to\r\nvolunteer such a charge against a man of apparent respectability and\r\nstation; but that his conscience would not let him sleep that night,\r\nand he had resolved at morning to go to the magistrate and make a clean\r\nbreast of it.\r\n\r\nThe story was in itself so improbable that any other magistrate but\r\nMr. Vigors would perhaps have dismissed it in contempt. But Mr. Vigors,\r\nalready so bitterly prejudiced against me, and not sorry, perhaps,\r\nto subject me to the humiliation of so horrible a charge, immediately\r\nissued his warrant to search my house. I was absent at Derval Court; the\r\nhouse was searched. In the bureau in my favourite study, which was left\r\nunlocked, the steel casket was discovered, and a large case-knife, on\r\nthe blade of which the stains of blood were still perceptible. On\r\nthis discovery I was apprehended; and on these evidences, and on the\r\ndeposition of this vagrant stranger, I was not, indeed, committed to\r\ntake my trial for murder, but placed in confinement, all bail for my\r\nappearance refused, and the examination adjourned to give time for\r\nfurther evidence and inquiries. I had requested the professional aid of\r\nMr. Jeeves. To my surprise and dismay, Mr. Jeeves begged me to excuse\r\nhim. He said he was pre-engaged by Mr. Strahan to detect and prosecute\r\nthe murderer of Sir P. Derval, and could not assist one accused of the\r\nmurder. I gathered from the little he said that Strahan had already been\r\nto him that morning and told him of the missing manuscript, that Strahan\r\nhad ceased to be my friend. I engaged another solicitor, a young man of\r\nability, and who professed personal esteem for me. Mr. Stanton (such\r\nwas the lawyer’s name) believed in my innocence; but he warned me that\r\nappearances were grave, he implored me to be perfectly frank with him.\r\nHad I held conversation with Sir Philip under the archway as reported by\r\nthe witness? Had I used such or similar words? Had the deceased said, “I\r\nhad a grudge against him”? Had I demanded the casket? Had I threatened\r\nSir Philip that he would repent? And of what,--his refusal?\r\n\r\nI felt myself grow pale, as I answered, “Yes; I thought such or similar\r\nexpressions had occurred in my conversation with the deceased.”\r\n\r\n“What was the reason of the grudge? What was the nature of this casket,\r\nthat I should so desire its possession?”\r\n\r\nThere, I became terribly embarrassed. What could I say to a keen,\r\nsensible, worldly man of law,--tell him of the powder and the fumes, of\r\nthe scene in the museum, of Sir Philip’s tale, of the implied identity\r\nof the youthful Margrave with the aged Grayle, of the elixir of life,\r\nand of magic arts? I--I tell such a romance! I,--the noted adversary of\r\nall pretended mysticism; I,--I a sceptical practitioner of medicine! Had\r\nthat manuscript of Sir Philip’s been available,--a substantial record\r\nof marvellous events by a man of repute for intellect and learning,--I\r\nmight perhaps have ventured to startle the solicitor of L------ with my\r\nrevelations. But the sole proof that all which the solicitor urged me\r\nto confide was not a monstrous fiction or an insane delusion had\r\ndisappeared; and its disappearance was a part of the terrible mystery\r\nthat enveloped the whole. I answered therefore, as composedly as I\r\ncould, that “I could have no serious grudge against Sir Philip, whom I\r\nhad never seen before that evening; that the words which applied to\r\nmy supposed grudge were lightly said by Sir Philip, in reference to a\r\nphysiological dispute on matters connected with mesmerical phenomena;\r\nthat the deceased had declared his casket, which he had shown me at the\r\nmayor’s house, contained drugs of great potency in medicine; that I had\r\nasked permission to test those drugs myself; and that when I said he\r\nwould repent of his refusal, I merely meant that he would repent of\r\nhis reliance on drugs not warranted by the experiments of professional\r\nscience.”\r\n\r\nMy replies seemed to satisfy the lawyer so far, but “how could I account\r\nfor the casket and the knife being found in my room?”\r\n\r\n“In no way but this; the window of my study is a door-window opening on\r\nthe lane, from which any one might enter the room. I was in the habit,\r\nnot only of going out myself that way, but of admitting through that\r\ndoor any more familiar private acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“Whom, for instance?”\r\n\r\nI hesitated a moment, and then said, with a significance I could not\r\nforbear, “Mr. Margrave! He would know the locale perfectly; he would\r\nknow that the door was rarely bolted from within during the daytime:\r\nhe could enter at all hours; he could place, or instruct any one to\r\ndeposit, the knife and casket in my bureau, which he knew I never kept\r\nlocked; it contained no secrets, no private correspondence,--chiefly\r\nsurgical implements, or such things as I might want for professional\r\nexperiments.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Margrave! But you cannot suspect him--a lively, charming young man,\r\nagainst whose character not a whisper was ever heard--of connivance with\r\nsuch a charge against you,--a connivance that would implicate him in the\r\nmurder itself; for if you are accused wrongfully, he who accuses you is\r\neither the criminal or the criminal’s accomplice, his instigator or his\r\ntool.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Stanton,” I said firmly, after a moment’s pause, “I do suspect\r\nMr. Margrave of a hand in this crime. Sir Philip, on seeing him at the\r\nmayor’s house, expressed a strong abhorrence of him, more than hinted\r\nat crimes he had committed, appointed me to come to Derval Court the\r\nday after that on which the murder was committed. Sir Philip had known\r\nsomething of this Margrave in the East; Margrave might dread exposure,\r\nrevelations--of what I know not; but, strange as it may seem to you,\r\nit is my conviction that this young man, apparently so gay and so\r\nthoughtless, is the real criminal, and in some way which I cannot\r\nconjecture has employed this lying vagabond in the fabrication of a\r\ncharge against myself. Reflect: of Mr. Margrave’s antecedents we know\r\nnothing; of them nothing was known even by the young gentleman who first\r\nintroduced him to the society of this town. If you would serve and\r\nsave me, it is to that quarter that you will direct your vigilant and\r\nunrelaxing researches.”\r\n\r\nI had scarcely so said when I repented my candour, for I observed in the\r\nface of Mr. Stanton a sudden revulsion of feeling, an utter incredulity\r\nof the accusation I had thus hazarded, and for the first time a doubt of\r\nmy own innocence. The fascination exercised by Margrave was universal;\r\nnor was it to be wondered at: for besides the charm of his joyous\r\npresence, he seemed so singularly free from even the errors common\r\nenough with the young,--so gay and boon a companion, yet a shunner of\r\nwine; so dazzling in aspect, so more than beautiful, so courted, so\r\nidolized by women, yet no tale of seduction, of profligacy, attached\r\nto his name! As to his antecedents, he had so frankly owned himself\r\na natural son, a nobody, a traveller, an idler; his expenses, though\r\nlavish, were so unostentatious, so regularly defrayed; he was so wholly\r\nthe reverse of the character assigned to criminals, that it seemed as\r\nabsurd to bring a charge of homicide against a butterfly or a goldfinch\r\nas against this seemingly innocent and delightful favourite of humanity\r\nand nature.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Stanton said little or nothing, and shortly afterwards left\r\nme, with a dry expression of hope that my innocence would be cleared\r\nin spite of evidence that, he was bound to say, was of the most serious\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nI was exhausted. I fell into a profound sleep early that night; it might\r\nbe a little after twelve when I woke, and woke as fully, as completely,\r\nas much restored to life and consciousness, as it was then my habit to\r\nbe at the break of day. And so waking, I saw, on the wall opposite\r\nmy bed, the same luminous phantom I had seen in the wizard’s study\r\nat Derval Court. I have read in Scandinavian legends of an apparition\r\ncalled the Scin-Laeca, or shining corpse. It is supposed in the northern\r\nsuperstition, sometimes to haunt sepulchres, sometimes to foretell doom.\r\nIt is the spectre of a human body seen in a phosphoric light; and\r\nso exactly did this phantom correspond to the description of such an\r\napparition in Scandinavian fable that I knew not how to give it a better\r\nname than that of Scin-Laeca,--the shining corpse.\r\n\r\nThere it was before me, corpse-like, yet not dead; there, as in the\r\nhaunted study of the wizard Forman!--the form and the face of Margrave.\r\nConstitutionally, my nerves are strong, and my temper hardy, and now\r\nI was resolved to battle against any impression which my senses might\r\nreceive from my own deluding fancies. Things that witnessed for the\r\nfirst time daunt us witnessed for the second time lose their terror.\r\nI rose from my bed with a bold aspect, I approached the phantom with a\r\nfirm step; but when within two paces of it, and my hand outstretched to\r\ntouch it, my arm became fixed in air, my feet locked to the ground. I\r\ndid not experience fear; I felt that my heart beat regularly, but an\r\ninvincible something opposed itself to me. I stood as if turned to\r\nstone. And then from the lips of this phantom there came a voice, but a\r\nvoice which seemed borne from a great distance,--very low, muffled, and\r\nyet distinct; I could not even be sure that my ear heard it, or whether\r\nthe sound was not conveyed to me by an inner sense.\r\n\r\n“I, and I alone, can save and deliver you,” said the voice. “I will do\r\nso; and the conditions I ask, in return, are simple and easy.”\r\n\r\n“Fiend or spectre, or mere delusion of my own brain,” cried I, “there\r\ncan be no compact between thee and me. I despise thy malice, I reject\r\nthy services; I accept no conditions to escape from the one or to obtain\r\nthe other.”\r\n\r\n“You may give a different answer when I ask again.”\r\n\r\nThe Scin-Laeca slowly waned, and, fading first into a paler shadow, then\r\nvanished. I rejoiced at the reply I had given. Two days elapsed before\r\nMr. Stanton again came to me; in the interval the Scin-Laeca did not\r\nreappear. I had mustered all my courage, all my common-sense, noted down\r\nall the weak points of the false evidence against me, and felt calm and\r\nsupported by the strength of my innocence.\r\n\r\nThe first few words of the solicitor dashed all my courage to the\r\nground; for I was anxious to hear news of Lilian, anxious to have\r\nsome message from her that might cheer and strengthen me, and my first\r\nquestion was this,--\r\n\r\n“Mr. Stanton, you are aware that I am engaged in marriage to Miss\r\nAshleigh. Your family are not unacquainted with her. What says, what\r\nthinks she of this monstrous charge against her betrothed?”\r\n\r\n“I was for two hours at Mrs. Ashleigh’s house last evening,” replied\r\nthe lawyer; “she was naturally anxious to see me as employed in your\r\ndefence. Who do you think was there? Who, eager to defend you, to\r\nexpress his persuasion of your innocence, to declare his conviction\r\nthat the real criminal would be soon discovered,--who but that same Mr.\r\nMargrave; whom, pardon me my frankness, you so rashly and groundlessly\r\nsuspected.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens! Do you say that he is received in that house; that he--he is\r\nfamiliarly admitted to her presence?”\r\n\r\n“My good sir, why these unjust prepossessions against a true friend? It\r\nwas as your friend that, as soon as the charge against you amazed\r\nand shocked the town of L----, Mr. Margrave called on Mrs. Ashleigh,\r\npresented to her by Miss Brabazon, and was so cheering and hopeful\r\nthat--”\r\n\r\n“Enough!” I exclaimed,--“enough!”\r\n\r\nI paced the room in a state of excitement and rage, which the lawyer in\r\nvain endeavoured to calm, until at length I halted abruptly: “Well, and\r\nyou saw Miss Ashleigh? What message does she send to me--her betrothed?”\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton looked confused. “Message! Consider, sir, Miss Ashleigh’s\r\nsituation--the delicacy--and--and--”\r\n\r\n“I understand, no message, no word, from a young lady so respectable to\r\na man accused of murder.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton was silent for some moments, and then said quietly, “Let us\r\nchange this subject; let us think of what more immediately presses. I\r\nsee you have been making some notes: may I look at them?”\r\n\r\nI composed myself and sat down. “This accuser! Have inquiries really\r\nbeen made as to himself, and his statement of his own proceedings? He\r\ncomes, he says, from America: in what ship? At what port did he land? Is\r\nthere any evidence to corroborate his story of the relations he tried to\r\ndiscover; of the inn at which he first put up, and to which he could not\r\nfind his way?”\r\n\r\n“Your suggestions are sensible, Dr. Fenwick. I have forestalled them. It\r\nis true that the man lodged at a small inn,--the Rising Sun; true\r\nthat he made inquiries about some relations of the name of Walls, who\r\nformerly resided at L----, and afterwards removed to a village ten\r\nmiles distant,--two brothers, tradesmen of small means but respectable\r\ncharacter. He at first refused to say at what seaport he landed, in what\r\nship he sailed. I suspect that he has now told a falsehood as to these\r\nmatters. I sent my clerk to Southampton, for it is there he said that\r\nhe was put on shore; we shall see: the man himself is detained in close\r\ncustody. I hear that his manner is strange and excitable; but that he\r\npreserves silence as much as possible. It is generally believed that\r\nhe is a bad character, perhaps a returned convict, and that this is the\r\ntrue reason why he so long delayed giving evidence, and has been since\r\nso reluctant to account for himself. But even if his testimony should\r\nbe impugned, should break down, still we should have to account for the\r\nfact that the casket and the case-knife were found in your bureau; for,\r\ngranting that a person could, in your absence, have entered your study\r\nand placed the articles in your bureau, it is clear that such a person\r\nmust have been well acquainted with your house, and this stranger to\r\nL---- could not have possessed that knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not. Mr. Margrave did possess it!”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Margrave again! oh, sir!”\r\n\r\nI arose and moved away with an impatient gesture. I could not trust\r\nmyself to speak. That night I did not sleep; I watched impatiently,\r\ngazing on the opposite wall for the gleam of the Scin-Laeca. But the\r\nnight passed away, and the spectre did not appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer came the next day, and with something like a smile on his\r\nlips. He brought me a few lines in pencil from Mrs. Ashleigh; they were\r\nkindly expressed, bade me be of good cheer; “she never for a moment\r\nbelieved in my guilt; Lilian bore up wonderfully under so terrible a\r\ntrial; it was an unspeakable comfort to both to receive the visits of a\r\nfriend so attached to me, and so confident of a triumphant refutation of\r\nthe hideous calumny under which I now suffered as Mr. Margrave!”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer had seen Margrave again,--seen him in that house. Margrave\r\nseemed almost domiciled there!\r\n\r\nI remained sullen and taciturn during this visit. I longed again for the\r\nnight. Night came. I heard the distant clock strike twelve, when again\r\nthe icy wind passed through my hair, and against the wall stood the\r\nluminous Shadow.\r\n\r\n“Have you considered?” whispered the voice, still as from afar. “I\r\nrepeat it,--I alone can save you.”\r\n\r\n“Is it among the conditions which you ask, in return, that I shall\r\nresign to you the woman I love?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Is it one of the conditions that I should commit some crime,--a crime\r\nperhaps heinous as that of which I am accused?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“With such reservations, I accept the conditions you may name, provided\r\nI, in my turn, may demand one condition from yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Name it.”\r\n\r\n“I ask you to quit this town. I ask you, meanwhile, to cease your visits\r\nto the house that holds the woman betrothed to me.”\r\n\r\n“I will cease those visits. And before many days are over, I will quit\r\nthis town.”\r\n\r\n“Now, then, say what you ask from me. I am prepared to concede it. And\r\nnot from fear for myself, but because I fear for the pure and innocent\r\nbeing who is under the spell of your deadly fascination. This is your\r\npower over me. You command me through my love for another. Speak.”\r\n\r\n“My conditions are simple. You will pledge yourself to desist from all\r\ncharges of insinuation against myself, of what nature soever. You will\r\nnot, when you meet me in the flesh, refer to what you have known of my\r\nlikeness in the Shadow. You will be invited to the house at which I may\r\nbe also a guest; you will come; you will meet and converse with me as\r\nguest speaks with guest in the house of a host.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“It is all.”\r\n\r\n“Then I pledge you my faith; keep your own.”\r\n\r\n“Fear not; sleep secure in the certainty that you will soon be released\r\nfrom these walls.”\r\n\r\nThe Shadow waned and faded. Darkness settled back, and a sleep, profound\r\nand calm, fell over me.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Stanton again visited me. He had received that morning\r\na note from Mr. Margrave, stating that he had left L---- to pursue, in\r\nperson, an investigation which he had already commenced through another,\r\naffecting the man who had given evidence against me, and that, if his\r\nhope should prove well founded, he trusted to establish my innocence,\r\nand convict the real murderer of Sir Philip Derval. In the research he\r\nthus volunteered, he had asked for, and obtained, the assistance of the\r\npoliceman Waby, who, grateful to me for saving the life of his sister,\r\nhad expressed a strong desire to be employed in my service.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my most cruel assailant was my old college friend, Richard\r\nStrahan. For Jeeves had spread abroad Strahan’s charge of purloining the\r\nmemoir which had been entrusted to me; and that accusation had done me\r\ngreat injury in public opinion, because it seemed to give probability to\r\nthe only motive which ingenuity could ascribe to the foul deed imputed\r\nto me. That motive had been first suggested by Mr. Vigors. Cases are\r\non record of men whose life had been previously blameless, who have\r\ncommitted a crime which seemed to belie their nature, in the monomania\r\nof some intense desire. In Spain, a scholar reputed of austere\r\nmorals murdered and robbed a traveller for money in order to purchase\r\nbooks,--books written, too, by Fathers of his Church! He was intent on\r\nsolving some problem of theological casuistry. In France, an antiquary,\r\nesteemed not more for his learning than for amiable and gentle\r\nqualities, murdered his most intimate friend for the possession of\r\na medal, without which his own collection was incomplete. These, and\r\nsimilar anecdotes, tending to prove how fatally any vehement desire,\r\nmorbidly cherished, may suspend the normal operations of reason and\r\nconscience, were whispered about by Dr. Lloyd’s vindictive partisan;\r\nand the inference drawn from them and applied to the assumptions against\r\nmyself was the more credulously received, because of that over-refining\r\nspeculation on motive and act which the shallow accept, in their\r\neagerness to show how readily they understand the profound.\r\n\r\nI was known to be fond of scientific, especially of chemical\r\nexperiments; to be eager in testing the truth of any novel invention.\r\nStrahan, catching hold of the magistrate’s fantastic hypothesis, went\r\nabout repeating anecdotes of the absorbing passion for analysis and\r\ndiscovery which had characterized me in youth as a medical student, and\r\nto which, indeed, I owed the precocious reputation I had obtained.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Derval, according not only to report, but to the direct\r\ntestimony of his servant, had acquired in the course of his travels many\r\nsecrets in natural science, especially as connected with the healing\r\nart,--his servant had deposed to the remarkable cures he had effected\r\nby the medicinals stored in the stolen casket. Doubtless Sir Philip,\r\nin boasting of these medicinals in the course of our conversation,\r\nhad excited my curiosity, inflamed my imagination; and thus when I\r\nafterwards suddenly met him in a lone spot, a passionate impulse had\r\nacted on a brain heated into madness by curiosity and covetous desire.\r\n\r\nAll these suppositions, reduced into system, were corroborated by\r\nStrahan’s charge that I had made away with the manuscript supposed to\r\ncontain the explanations of the medical agencies employed by Sir Philip,\r\nand had sought to shelter my theft by a tale so improbable, that a man\r\nof my reputed talent could not have hazarded it if in his sound\r\nsenses. I saw the web that had thus been spread around me by hostile\r\nprepossessions and ignorant gossip: how could the arts of Margrave\r\nscatter that web to the winds? I knew not, but I felt confidence in his\r\npromise and his power. Still, so great had been my alarm for Lilian,\r\nthat the hope of clearing my own innocence was almost lost in my joy\r\nthat Margrave, at least, was no longer in her presence, and that I had\r\nreceived his pledge to quit the town in which she lived.\r\n\r\nThus, hours rolled on hours, till, I think, on the third day from that\r\nnight in which I had last beheld the mysterious Shadow, my door\r\nwas hastily thrown open, a confused crowd presented itself at the\r\nthreshold,--the governor of the prison, the police superintendent,\r\nMr. Stanton, and other familiar faces shut out from me since my\r\nimprisonment. I knew at the first glance that I was no longer an outlaw\r\nbeyond the pale of human friendship. And proudly, sternly, as I had\r\nsupported myself hitherto in solitude and suspense, when I felt warm\r\nhands clasping mine, heard joyous voices proffering congratulations, saw\r\nin the eyes of all that my innocence had been cleared, the revulsion of\r\nemotion was too strong for me,--the room reeled on my sight, I fainted.\r\nI pass, as quickly as I can, over the explanations that crowded on me\r\nwhen I recovered, and that were publicly given in evidence in court next\r\nmorning. I had owed all to Margrave. It seems that he had construed\r\nto my favour the very supposition which had been bruited abroad to my\r\nprejudice. “For,” said he, “it is conjectured that Fenwick committed the\r\ncrime of which he is accused in the impulse of a disordered reason. That\r\nconjecture is based upon the probability that a madman alone could have\r\ncommitted a crime without adequate motive. But it seems quite clear that\r\nthe accused is not mad; and I see cause to suspect that the accuser is.”\r\n Grounding this assumption on the current reports of the witness’s\r\nmanner and bearing since he had been placed under official surveillance,\r\nMargrave had commissioned the policeman Waby to make inquiries in\r\nthe village to which the accuser asserted he had gone in quest of his\r\nrelations, and Waby had there found persons who remembered to have heard\r\nthat the two brothers named Walls lived less by the gains of the petty\r\nshop which they kept than by the proceeds of some property consigned to\r\nthem as the nearest of kin to a lunatic who had once been tried for\r\nhis life. Margrave had then examined the advertisements in the daily\r\nnewspapers. One of them, warning the public against a dangerous maniac,\r\nwho had effected his escape from an asylum in the west of England,\r\ncaught his attention. To that asylum he had repaired.\r\n\r\nThere he learned that the patient advertised was one whose propensity\r\nwas homicide, consigned for life to the asylum on account of a murder,\r\nfor which he had been tried. The description of this person exactly\r\ntallied with that of the pretended American. The medical superintendent\r\nof the asylum, hearing all particulars from Margrave, expressed a strong\r\npersuasion that the witness was his missing patient, and had himself\r\ncommitted the crime of which he had accused another. If so, the\r\nsuperintendent undertook to coax from him the full confession of all\r\nthe circumstances. Like many other madmen, and not least those whose\r\npropensity is to crime, the fugitive maniac was exceedingly cunning,\r\ntreacherous, secret, and habituated to trick and stratagem,--more subtle\r\nthan even the astute in possession of all their faculties, whether to\r\nachieve his purpose or to conceal it, and fabricate appearances against\r\nanother. But while, in ordinary conversation, he seemed rational enough\r\nto those who were not accustomed to study him, he had one hallucination\r\nwhich, when humoured, led him always, not only to betray himself, but to\r\nglory in any crime proposed or committed. He was under the belief that\r\nhe had made a bargain with Satan, who, in return for implicit obedience,\r\nwould bear him harmless through all the consequences of such submission,\r\nand finally raise him to great power and authority. It is no unfrequent\r\nillusion of homicidal maniacs to suppose they are under the influence\r\nof the Evil One, or possessed by a Demon. Murderers have assigned as the\r\nonly reason they themselves could give for their crime, that “the Devil\r\ngot into them,” and urged the deed. But the insane have, perhaps, no\r\nattribute more in common than that of superweening self-esteem. The\r\nmaniac who has been removed from a garret sticks straws in his hair\r\nand calls them a crown. So much does inordinate arrogance characterize\r\nmental aberration, that, in the course of my own practice, I have\r\ndetected, in that infirmity, the certain symptom of insanity, long\r\nbefore the brain had made its disease manifest even to the most familiar\r\nkindred.\r\n\r\nMorbid self-esteem accordingly pervaded the dreadful illusion by which\r\nthe man I now speak of was possessed. He was proud to be the protected\r\nagent of the Fallen Angel. And if that self-esteem were artfully\r\nappealed to, he would exult superbly in the evil he held himself ordered\r\nto perform, as if a special prerogative, an official rank and privilege;\r\nthen, he would be led on to boast gleefully of thoughts which the most\r\ncynical of criminals in whom intelligence was not ruined would shrink\r\nfrom owning; then, he would reveal himself in all his deformity with as\r\ncomplacent and frank a self-glorying as some vain good man displays in\r\nparading his amiable sentiments and his beneficent deeds.\r\n\r\n“If,” said the superintendent, “this be the patient who has escaped from\r\nme, and if his propensity to homicide has been, in some way, directed\r\ntowards the person who has been murdered, I shall not be with him a\r\nquarter of an hour before he will inform me how it happened, and detail\r\nthe arts he employed in shifting his crime upon another; all will be\r\ntold as minutely as a child tells the tale of some school-boy exploit,\r\nin which he counts on your sympathy, and feels sure of your applause.”\r\n\r\nMargrave brought this gentleman back to L----, took him to the mayor,\r\nwho was one of my warmest supporters: the mayor had sufficient influence\r\nto dictate and arrange the rest. The superintendent was introduced to\r\nthe room in which the pretended American was lodged. At his own desire\r\na select number of witnesses were admitted with him. Margrave excused\r\nhimself; he said candidly that he was too intimate a friend of mine to\r\nbe an impartial listener to aught that concerned me so nearly.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent proved right in his suspicions, and verified his\r\npromises. My false accuser was his missing patient; the man recognized\r\nDr. ---- with no apparent terror, rather with an air of condescension,\r\nand in a very few minutes was led to tell his own tale, with a gloating\r\ncomplacency both at the agency by which he deemed himself exalted, and\r\nat the dexterous cunning with which he had acquitted himself of the\r\ntask, that increased the horror of his narrative.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the mode of his escape, which was extremely ingenious, but\r\nof which the details, long in themselves, did not interest me, and\r\nI understood them too imperfectly to repeat. He had encountered a\r\nsea-faring traveller on the road, whom he had knocked down with a stone,\r\nand robbed of his glazed hat and pea-jacket, as well as of a small\r\nsum in coin, which last enabled him to pay his fare in a railway that\r\nconveyed him eighty miles away from the asylum. Some trifling remnant\r\nof this money still in his pocket, he then travelled on foot along the\r\nhigh-road till he came to a town about twenty miles distant from L----;\r\nthere he had stayed a day or two, and there he said “that the Devil had\r\ntold him to buy a case-knife, which he did.” “He knew by that order that\r\nthe Devil meant him to do something great.” “His Master,” as he called\r\nthe fiend, then directed him the road he should take. He came to L----,\r\nput up, as he had correctly stated before, at a small inn, wandered at\r\nnight about the town, was surprised by the sudden storm, took shelter\r\nunder the convent arch, overheard somewhat more of my conversation with\r\nSir Philip than he had previously deposed,--heard enough to excite his\r\ncuriosity as to the casket: “While he listened his Master told him he\r\nmust get possession of that casket.” Sir Philip had quitted the archway\r\nalmost immediately after I had done so, and he would then have attacked\r\nhim if he had not caught sight of a policeman going his rounds. He had\r\nfollowed Sir Philip to a house (Mr. Jeeves’s). “His Master told him\r\nto wait and watch.” He did so. When Sir Philip came forth, towards the\r\ndawn, he followed him, saw him enter a narrow street, came up to him,\r\nseized him by the arm, demanded all he had about him. Sir Philip tried\r\nto shake him off,--struck at him. What follows I spare the reader. The\r\ndeed was done. He robbed the dead man both of the casket and the\r\npurse that he found in the pockets; had scarcely done so when he heard\r\nfootsteps. He had just time to get behind the portico of a detached\r\nhouse at angles with the street when I came up. He witnessed, from his\r\nhiding-place, the brief conference between myself and the policemen,\r\nand when they moved on, bearing the body, stole unobserved away. He was\r\ngoing back towards the inn, when it occurred to him that it would be\r\nsafer if the casket and purse were not about his person; that he asked\r\nhis Master to direct him how to dispose of them: that his Master guided\r\nhim to an open yard (a stone-mason’s) at a very little distance from\r\nthe inn; that in this yard there stood an old wych-elm tree, from the\r\ngnarled roots of which the earth was worn away, leaving chinks and\r\nhollows, in one of which he placed the casket and purse, taking from the\r\nlatter only two sovereigns and some silver, and then heaping loose mould\r\nover the hiding-place. That he then repaired to his inn, and left\r\nit late in the morning, on the pretence of seeking for his\r\nrelations,--persons, indeed, who really had been related to him, but\r\nof whose death years ago he was aware. He returned to L---- a few days\r\nafterwards, and in the dead of the night went to take up the casket and\r\nthe money. He found the purse with its contents undisturbed; but the\r\nlid of the casket was unclosed. From the hasty glance he had taken of it\r\nbefore burying it, it had seemed to him firmly locked,--he was alarmed\r\nlest some one had been to the spot. But his Master whispered to him not\r\nto mind, told him that he might now take the casket, and would be guided\r\nwhat to do with it; that he did so, and, opening the lid, found the\r\ncasket empty-; that he took the rest of the money out of the purse, but\r\nthat he did not take the purse itself, for it had a crest and initials\r\non it, which might lead to the discovery of what had been done; that\r\nhe therefore left it in the hollow amongst the roots, heaping the mould\r\nover it as before; that in the course of the day he heard the people at\r\nthe inn talk of the murder, and that his own first impulse was to get\r\nout of the town immediately, but that his Master “made him too wise for\r\nthat,” and bade him stay; that passing through the streets, he saw me\r\ncome out of the sash-window door, go to a stable-yard on the other side\r\nof the house, mount on horseback and ride away; that he observed the\r\nsash-door was left partially open; that he walked by it and saw the\r\nroom empty; there was only a dead wall opposite; the place was solitary,\r\nunobserved; that his Master directed him to lift up the sash gently,\r\nenter the room, and deposit the knife and the casket in a large\r\nwalnut-tree bureau which stood unlocked near the window. All that\r\nfollowed--his visit to Mr. Vigors, his accusation against myself, his\r\nwhole tale--was, he said, dictated by his Master, who was highly pleased\r\nwith him, and promised to bring him safely through. And here he turned\r\nround with a hideous smile, as if for approbation of his notable\r\ncleverness and respect for his high employ.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeeves had the curiosity to request the keeper to inquire how, in\r\nwhat form, or in what manner, the Fiend appeared to the narrator, or\r\nconveyed his infernal dictates. The man at first refused to say; but\r\nit was gradually drawn from him that the Demon had no certain and\r\ninvariable form: sometimes it appeared to him in the form of a rat;\r\nsometimes even of a leaf, or a fragment of wood, or a rusty nail; but\r\nthat his Master’s voice always came to him distinctly, whatever shape he\r\nappeared in; only, he said, with an air of great importance, his Master,\r\nthis time, had graciously condescended, ever since he left the asylum,\r\nto communicate with him in a much more pleasing and imposing aspect than\r\nhe had ever done before,--in the form of a beautiful youth, or, rather,\r\nlike a bright rose-coloured shadow, in which the features of a young\r\nman were visible, and that he had heard the voice more distinctly than\r\nusual, though in a milder tone, and seeming to come to him from a great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAfter these revelations the man became suddenly disturbed. He shook from\r\nlimb to limb, he seemed convulsed with terror; he cried out that he had\r\nbetrayed the secret of his Master, who had warned him not to describe\r\nhis appearance and mode of communication, or he would surrender his\r\nservant to the tormentors. Then the maniac’s terror gave way to fury;\r\nhis more direful propensity made itself declared; he sprang into the\r\nmidst of his frightened listeners, seized Mr. Vigors by the throat, and\r\nwould have strangled him but for the prompt rush of the superintendent\r\nand his satellites. Foaming at the mouth, and horribly raving, he was\r\nthen manacled, a strait-waistcoat thrust upon him, and the group so\r\nleft him in charge of his captors. Inquiries were immediately directed\r\ntowards such circumstantial evidence as might corroborate the details he\r\nhad so minutely set forth. The purse, recognized as Sir Philip’s, by the\r\nvalet of the deceased, was found buried under the wych-elm. A policeman\r\ndespatched, express, to the town in which the maniac declared the knife\r\nto have been purchased, brought back word that a cutler in the place\r\nremembered perfectly to have sold such a knife to a seafaring man, and\r\nidentified the instrument when it was shown to him. From the chink of a\r\ndoor ajar, in the wall opposite my sash-window, a maid-servant, watching\r\nfor her sweetheart (a journeyman carpenter, who habitually passed that\r\nway on going home to dine), had, though unobserved by the murderer, seen\r\nhim come out of my window at a time that corresponded with the dates of\r\nhis own story, though she had thought nothing of it at the moment. He\r\nmight be a patient, or have called on business; she did not know that\r\nI was from home. The only point of importance not cleared up was that\r\nwhich related to the opening of the casket,--the disappearance of the\r\ncontents; the lock had been unquestionably forced. No one, however,\r\ncould suppose that some third person had discovered the hiding-place and\r\nforced open the casket to abstract its contents and then rebury it. The\r\nonly probable supposition was that the man himself had forced it open,\r\nand, deeming the contents of no value, had thrown them away before he\r\nhad hidden the casket and purse, and, in the chaos of his reason, had\r\nforgotten that he had so done. Who could expect that every link in a\r\nmadman’s tale would be found integral and perfect? In short, little\r\nimportance was attached to this solitary doubt. Crowds accompanied me\r\nto my door, when I was set free, in open court, stainless; it was\r\na triumphal procession. The popularity I had previously enjoyed,\r\nsuperseded for a moment by so horrible a charge, came back to me tenfold\r\nas with the reaction of generous repentance for a momentary doubt.\r\nOne man shared the public favour,--the young man whose acuteness had\r\ndelivered me from the peril, and cleared the truth from so awful a\r\nmystery; but Margrave had escaped from congratulation and compliment; he\r\nhad gone on a visit to Strahan, at Derval Court.\r\n\r\nAlone, at last, in the welcome sanctuary of my own home, what were my\r\nthoughts? Prominent amongst them all was that assertion of the madman,\r\nwhich had made me shudder when repeated to me: he had been guided to the\r\nmurder and to all the subsequent proceedings by the luminous shadow of\r\nthe beautiful youth,--the Scin-Laeca to which I had pledged myself. If\r\nSir Philip Derval could be believed, Margrave was possessed of powers,\r\nderived from fragmentary recollections of a knowledge acquired in a\r\nformer state of being, which would render his remorseless intelligence\r\ninfinitely dire and frustrate the endeavours of a reason, unassisted\r\nby similar powers, to thwart his designs or bring the law against his\r\ncrimes. Had he then the arts that could thus influence the minds of\r\nothers to serve his fell purposes, and achieve securely his own evil\r\nends through agencies that could not be traced home to himself?\r\n\r\nBut for what conceivable purpose had I been subjected as a victim to\r\ninfluences as much beyond my control as the Fate or Demoniac Necessity\r\nof a Greek Myth? In the legends of the classic world some august\r\nsufferer is oppressed by powers more than mortal, but with an ethical\r\nif gloomy vindication of his chastisement,--he pays the penalty of crime\r\ncommitted by his ancestors or himself, or he has braved, by arrogating\r\nequality with the gods, the mysterious calamity which the gods alone can\r\ninflict. But I, no descendant of Pelops, no OEdipus boastful of a wisdom\r\nwhich could interpret the enigmas of the Sphynx, while ignorant even of\r\nhis own birth--what had I done to be singled out from the herd of men\r\nfor trials and visitations from the Shadowland of ghosts and sorcerers?\r\nIt would be ludicrously absurd to suppose that Dr. Lloyd’s dying\r\nimprecation could have had a prophetic effect upon my destiny; to\r\nbelieve that the pretences of mesmerizers were specially favoured by\r\nProvidence, and that to question their assumptions was an offence of\r\nprofanation to be punished by exposure to preternatural agencies. There\r\nwas not even that congruity between cause and effect which fable seeks\r\nin excuse for its inventions. Of all men living, I, unimaginative\r\ndisciple of austere science, should be the last to become the sport\r\nof that witchcraft which even imagination reluctantly allows to the\r\nmachinery of poets, and science casts aside into the mouldy lumber-room\r\nof obsolete superstition.\r\n\r\nRousing my mind from enigmas impossible to solve, it was with intense\r\nand yet most melancholy satisfaction that I turned to the image of\r\nLilian, rejoicing, though with a thrill of awe, that the promise\r\nso mysteriously conveyed to my senses had, hereto, been already\r\nfulfilled,--Margrave had left the town; Lilian was no longer subjected\r\nto his evil fascination. But an instinct told me that that fascination\r\nhad already produced an effect adverse to all hope of happiness for me.\r\nLilian’s love for myself was gone. Impossible otherwise that she--in\r\nwhose nature I had always admired that generous devotion which is\r\nmore or less inseparable from the romance of youth--should have never\r\nconveyed to me one word of consolation in the hour of my agony and\r\ntrial; that she, who, till the last evening we had met, had ever been\r\nso docile, in the sweetness of a nature femininely submissive to my\r\nslightest wish, should have disregarded my solemn injunction, and\r\nadmitted Margrave to acquaintance, nay, to familiar intimacy,--at\r\nthe very time, too, when to disobey my injunctions was to embitter my\r\nordeal, and add her own contempt to the degradation imposed upon my\r\nhonour! No, her heart must be wholly gone from me; her very nature\r\nwholly warped. A union between us had become impossible. My love for\r\nher remained unshattered; the more tender, perhaps, for a sentiment of\r\ncompassion. But my pride was shocked, my heart was wounded. My love was\r\nnot mean and servile. Enough for me to think that she would be at\r\nleast saved from Margrave. Her life associated with his!--contemplation\r\nhorrible and ghastly!--from that fate she was saved. Later, she would\r\nrecover the effect of an influence happily so brief. She might form some\r\nnew attachment, some new tie; but love once withdrawn is never to be\r\nrestored--and her love was withdrawn from me. I had but to release her,\r\nwith my own lips, from our engagement,--she would welcome that release.\r\nMournful but firm in these thoughts and these resolutions, I sought Mrs.\r\nAshleigh’s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nIt was twilight when I entered, unannounced (as had been my wont in our\r\nfamiliar intercourse), the quiet sitting-room in which I expected to\r\nfind mother and child. But Lilian was there alone, seated by the open\r\nwindow, her hands crossed and drooping on her knee, her eye fixed upon\r\nthe darkening summer skies, in which the evening star had just stolen\r\nforth, bright and steadfast, near the pale sickle of a half-moon that\r\nwas dimly visible, but gave as yet no light.\r\n\r\nLet any lover imagine the reception he would expect to meet from his\r\nbetrothed coming into her presence after he had passed triumphant\r\nthrough a terrible peril to life and fame--and conceive what ice froze\r\nmy blood, what anguish weighed down my heart, when Lilian, turning\r\ntowards me, rose not, spoke not, gazed at me heedlessly as if at some\r\nindifferent stranger--and--and--But no matter. I cannot bear to recall\r\nit even now, at the distance of years! I sat down beside her, and took\r\nher hand, without pressing it; it rested languidly, passively in mine,\r\none moment; I dropped it then, with a bitter sigh.\r\n\r\n“Lilian,” I said quietly, “you love me no longer. Is it not so?”\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to mine, looked at me wistfully, and pressed her\r\nhand on her forehead; then said, in a strange voice, “Did I ever love\r\nyou? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Lilian, Lilian, rouse yourself; are you not, while you speak, under\r\nsome spell, some influence which you cannot describe nor account for?”\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment before she answered, calmly, “No! Again I ask what\r\ndo you mean?”\r\n\r\n“What do I mean? Do you forget that we are betrothed? Do you forget how\r\noften, and how recently, our vows of affection and constancy have been\r\nexchanged?”\r\n\r\n“No, I do not forget; but I must have deceived you and myself--”\r\n\r\n“It is true, then, that you love me no more?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so.”\r\n\r\n“But, oh, Lilian, is it that your heart is only closed to me; or\r\nis it--oh, answer truthfully--is it given to another,--to him--to\r\nhim--against whom I warned you, whom I implored you not to receive? Tell\r\nme, at least, that your love is not gone to Margrave--”\r\n\r\n“To him! love to him! Oh, no--no--”\r\n\r\n“What, then, is your feeling towards him?”\r\n\r\nLilian’s face grew visibly paler, even in that dim light. “I know not,”\r\n she said, almost in a whisper; “but it is partly awe--partly--”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Abhorrence!” she said almost fiercely, and rose to her feet, with a\r\nwild defying start.\r\n\r\n“If that be so,” I said gently, “you would not grieve were you never\r\nagain to see him--”\r\n\r\n“But I shall see him again,” she murmured in a tone of weary sadness,\r\nand sank back once more into her chair.\r\n\r\n“I think not,” said I, “and I hope not. And now hear me and heed me,\r\nLilian. It is enough for me, no matter what your feelings towards\r\nanother, to learn from yourself that the affection you once professed\r\nfor me is gone. I release you from your troth. If folks ask why we two\r\nhenceforth separate the lives we had agreed to join, you may say, if\r\nyou please, that you could not give your hand to a man who had known the\r\ntaint of a felon’s prison, even on a false charge. If that seems to you\r\nan ungenerous reason, we will leave it to your mother to find a better.\r\nFarewell! For your own sake I can yet feel happiness,--happiness to hear\r\nthat you do not love the man against whom I warn you still more solemnly\r\nthan before! Will you not give me your hand in parting--and have I not\r\nspoken your own wish?”\r\n\r\nShe turned away her face, and resigned her hand to me in silence.\r\nSilently I held it in mine, and my emotions nearly stifled me. One\r\nsymptom of regret, of reluctance, on her part, and I should have fallen\r\nat her feet, and cried, “Do not let us break a tie which our vows should\r\nhave made indisoluble; heed not my offers, wrung from a tortured heart!\r\nYou cannot have ceased to love me!” But no such symptom of relenting\r\nshowed itself in her, and with a groan I left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nI was just outside the garden door, when I felt an arm thrown round me,\r\nmy cheek kissed and wetted with tears. Could it be Lilian? Alas, no!\r\nIt was her mother’s voice, that, between laughing and crying, exclaimed\r\nhysterically: “This is joy, to see you again, and on these thresholds. I\r\nhave just come from your house; I went there on purpose to congratulate\r\nyou, and to talk to you about Lilian. But you have seen her?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I have but this moment left her. Come this way.” I drew Mrs.\r\nAshleigh back into the garden, along the old winding walk, which the\r\nshrubs concealed from view of the house. We sat down on a rustic seat\r\nwhere I had often sat with Lilian, midway between the house and the\r\nMonks’ Well. I told the mother what had passed between me and her\r\ndaughter; I made no complaint of Lilian’s coldness and change; I did not\r\nhint at its cause. “Girls of her age will change,” said I, “and all\r\nthat now remains is for us two to agree on such a tale to our curious\r\nneighbours as may rest the whole blame on me. Man’s name is of robust\r\nfibre; it could not push its way to a place in the world, if it could\r\nnot bear, without sinking, the load idle tongues may lay on it. Not so\r\nWoman’s Name: what is but gossip against Man, is scandal against Woman.”\r\n\r\n“Do not be rash, my dear Allen,” said Mrs. Ashleigh, in great distress.\r\n“I feel for you, I understand you; in your case I might act as you do. I\r\ncannot blame you. Lilian is changed,--changed unaccountably. Yet sure\r\nI am that the change is only on the surface, that her heart is really\r\nyours, as entirely and as faithfully as ever it was; and that later,\r\nwhen she recovers from the strange, dreamy kind of torpor which appears\r\nto have come over all her faculties and all her affections, she would\r\nawake with a despair which you cannot conjecture to the knowledge that\r\nyou had renounced her.”\r\n\r\n“I have not renounced her,” said I, impatiently; “I did but restore her\r\nfreedom of choice. But pass by this now, and explain to me more fully\r\nthe change in your daughter, which I gather from your words is not\r\nconfined to me.”\r\n\r\n“I wished to speak of it before you saw her, and for that reason came to\r\nyour house. It was on the morning in which we left her aunt’s to return\r\nhither that I first noticed some thing peculiar in her look and manner.\r\nShe seemed absorbed and absent, so much so that I asked her several\r\ntimes to tell me what made her so grave; but I could only get from her\r\nthat she had had a confused dream which she could not recall distinctly\r\nenough to relate, but that she was sure it boded evil. During the\r\njourney she became gradually more herself, and began to look forward\r\nwith delight to the idea of seeing you again. Well, you came that\r\nevening. What passed between you and her you know best. You complained\r\nthat she slighted your request to shun all acquaintance with Mr.\r\nMargrave. I was surprised that, whether your wish were reasonable or\r\nnot, she could have hesitated to comply with it. I spoke to her about it\r\nafter you had gone, and she wept bitterly at thinking she had displeased\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“She wept! You amaze me. Yet the next day what a note she returned to\r\nmine!”\r\n\r\n“The next day the change in her became very visible to me. She told me,\r\nin an excited manner, that she was convinced she ought not to marry you.\r\nThen came, the following day, the news of your committal. I heard of\r\nit, but dared not break it to her. I went to our friend the mayor, to\r\nconsult with him what to say, what to do; and to learn more distinctly\r\nthan I had done from terrified, incoherent servants, the rights of so\r\ndreadful a story. When I returned, I found, to my amazement, a young\r\nstranger in the drawing-room; it was Mr. Margrave,--Miss Brabazon\r\nhad brought him at his request. Lilian was in the room, too, and my\r\nastonishment was increased, when she said to me with a singular smile,\r\nvague but tranquil: ‘I know all about Allen Fenwick; Mr. Margrave has\r\ntold me all. He is a friend of Allen’s. He says there is no cause\r\nfor fear.’ Mr. Margrave then apologized to me for his intrusion in a\r\ncaressing, kindly manner, as if one of the family. He said he was so\r\nintimate with you that he felt that he could best break to Miss Ashleigh\r\ninformation she might receive elsewhere, for that he was the only man\r\nin the town who treated the charge with ridicule. You know the wonderful\r\ncharm of this young man’s manner. I cannot explain to you how it was,\r\nbut in a few moments I was as much at home with him as if he had been\r\nyour brother. To be brief, having once come, he came constantly. He\r\nhad moved, two days before you went to Derval Court, from his hotel to\r\napartments in Mr. ----‘s house, just opposite. We could see him on his\r\nbalcony from our terrace; he would smile to us and come across. I did\r\nwrong in slighting your injunction, and suffering Lilian to do so. I\r\ncould not help it, he was such a comfort to me,--to her, too--in her\r\ntribulation. He alone had no doleful words, wore no long face; he alone\r\nwas invariably cheerful. ‘Everything,’ he said, ‘would come right in a\r\nday or two.’”\r\n\r\n“And Lilian could not but admire this young man, he is so beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“Beautiful? Well, perhaps. But if you have a jealous feeling, you were\r\nnever more mistaken. Lilian, I am convinced, does more than dislike him;\r\nhe has inspired her with repugnance, with terror. And much as I own I\r\nlike him, in his wild, joyous, careless, harmless way, do not think I\r\nflatter you if I say that Mr. Margrave is not the man to make any girl\r\nuntrue to you,--untrue to a lover with infinitely less advantages than\r\nyou may pretend to. He would be a universal favourite, I grant; but\r\nthere is something in him, or a something wanting in him, which makes\r\nliking and admiration stop short of love. I know not why; perhaps,\r\nbecause, with all his good humour, he is so absorbed in himself, so\r\nintensely egotistical, so light; were he less clever, I should say so\r\nfrivolous. He could not make love, he could not say in the serious tone\r\nof a man in earnest, ‘I love you.’ He owned as much to me, and owned,\r\ntoo, that he knew not even what love was. As to myself, Mr. Margrave\r\nappears rich; no whisper against his character or his honour ever\r\nreached me. Yet were you out of the question, and were there no stain on\r\nhis birth, nay, were he as high in rank and wealth as he is favoured by\r\nNature in personal advantages, I confess I could never consent to trust\r\nhim with my daughter’s fate. A voice at my heart would cry, ‘No!’ It\r\nmay be an unreasonable prejudice, but I could not bear to see him touch\r\nLilian’s hand!”\r\n\r\n“Did she never, then--never suffer him even to take her hand?”\r\n\r\n“Never. Do not think so meanly of her as to suppose that she could be\r\ncaught by a fair face, a graceful manner. Reflect: just before she had\r\nrefused, for your sake, Ashleigh Sumner, whom Lady Haughton said ‘no\r\ngirl in her senses could refuse;’ and this change in Lilian really began\r\nbefore we returned to L----,--before she had even seen Mr. Margrave.\r\nI am convinced it is something in the reach of your skill as\r\nphysician,--it is on the nerves, the system. I will give you a proof\r\nof what I say, only do not betray me to her. It was during your\r\nimprisonment, the night before your release, that I was awakened by her\r\ncoming to my bedside. She was sobbing as if her heart would break. ‘O\r\nmother, mother!’ she cried, ‘pity me, help me! I am so wretched.’ ‘What\r\nis the matter, darling?’ ‘I have been so cruel to Allen, and I know I\r\nshall be so again. I cannot help it. Do not question me; only if we are\r\nseparated, if he cast me off, or I reject him, tell him some day perhaps\r\nwhen I am in my grave--not to believe appearances; and that I, in my\r\nheart of hearts, never ceased to love him!’”\r\n\r\n“She said that! You are not deceiving me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! how can you think so?”\r\n\r\n“There is hope still,” I murmured; and I bowed my head upon my hands,\r\nhot tears forcing their way through the clasped fingers.\r\n\r\n“One word more,” said I; “you tell me that Lilian has a repugnance to\r\nthis Margrave, and yet that she found comfort in his visits,--a comfort\r\nthat could not be wholly ascribed to cheering words he might say about\r\nmyself, since it is all but certain that I was not, at that time,\r\nuppermost in her mind. Can you explain this apparent contradiction?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot, otherwise than by a conjecture which you would ridicule.”\r\n\r\n“I can ridicule nothing now. What is your conjecture?”\r\n\r\n“I know how much you disbelieve in the stories one hears of animal\r\nmagnetism and electro-biology, otherwise--”\r\n\r\n“You think that Margrave exercises some power of that kind over Lilian?\r\nHas he spoken of such a power?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly; but he said that he was sure Lilian possessed a faculty\r\nthat he called by some hard name, not clairvoyance, but a faculty, which\r\nhe said, when I asked him to explain, was akin to prevision,--to second\r\nsight. Then he talked of the Priestesses who had administered the\r\nancient oracles. Lilian, he said, reminded him of them, with her deep\r\neyes and mysterious smile.”\r\n\r\n“And Lilian heard him? What said she?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing; she seemed in fear while she listened.”\r\n\r\n“He did not offer to try any of those arts practised by professional\r\nmesmerists and other charlatans?”\r\n\r\n“I thought he was about to do so, but I forestalled him, saying I never\r\nwould consent to any experiment of that kind, either on myself or my\r\ndaughter.”\r\n\r\n“And he replied--”\r\n\r\n“With his gay laugh, ‘that I was very foolish; that a person possessed\r\nof such a faculty as he attributed to Lilian would, if the faculty were\r\ndeveloped, be an invaluable adviser.’ He would have said more, but I\r\nbegged him to desist. Still I fancy at times--do not be angry--that he\r\ndoes somehow or other bewitch her, unconsciously to herself; for she\r\nalways knows when he is coming. Indeed, I am not sure that he does not\r\nbewitch myself, for I by no means justify my conduct in admitting him\r\nto an intimacy so familiar, and in spite of your wish; I have reproached\r\nmyself, resolved to shut my door on him, or to show by my manner that\r\nhis visits were unwelcome; yet when Lilian has said, in the drowsy\r\nlethargic tone which has come into her voice (her voice naturally\r\nearnest and impressive, though always low), ‘Mother, he will be here in\r\ntwo minutes; I wish to leave the room and cannot,’ I, too, have felt\r\nas if something constrained me against my will; as if, in short, I were\r\nunder that influence which Mr. Vigors--whom I will never forgive for his\r\nconduct to you--would ascribe to mesmerism. But will you not come in and\r\nsee Lilian again?”\r\n\r\n“No, not to-night; but watch and heed her, and if you see aught to make\r\nyou honestly believe that she regrets the rupture of the old tic from\r\nwhich I have released her--why, you know, Mrs. Ashleigh, that--that--”\r\n My voice failed; I wrung the good woman’s hand, and went my way.\r\n\r\nI had always till then considered Mrs. Ashleigh--if not as Mrs. Poyntz\r\ndescribed her--“commonplace weak”--still of an intelligence somewhat\r\nbelow mediocrity. I now regarded her with respect as well as grateful\r\ntenderness; her plain sense had divined what all my boasted knowledge\r\nhad failed to detect in my earlier intimacy with Margrave,--namely,\r\nthat in him there was a something present, or a something wanting, which\r\nforbade love and excited fear. Young, beautiful, wealthy, seemingly\r\nblameless in life as he was, she would not have given her daughter’s\r\nhand to him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nThe next day my house was filled with visitors. I had no notion that I\r\nhad so many friends. Mr. Vigors wrote me a generous and handsome letter,\r\nowning his prejudices against me on account of his sympathy with poor\r\nDr. Lloyd, and begging my pardon for what he now felt to have been\r\nharshness, if not distorted justice. But what most moved me was the\r\nentrance of Strahan, who rushed up to me with the heartiness of old\r\ncollege days. “Oh, my dear Allen, can you ever forgive me; that I should\r\nhave disbelieved your word,--should have suspected you of abstracting my\r\npoor cousin’s memoir?”\r\n\r\n“Is it found, then?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; you must thank Margrave. He, clever fellow, you know, came\r\nto me on a visit yesterday. He put me at once on the right scent. Only\r\nguess; but you never can! It was that wretched old housekeeper who\r\npurloined the manuscript. You remember she came into the room while you\r\nwere looking at the memoir. She heard us talk about it; her curiosity\r\nwas roused; she longed to know the history of her old master, under his\r\nown hand; she could not sleep; she heard me go up to bed; she thought\r\nyou might leave the book on the table when you, too, went to rest. She\r\nstole downstairs, peeped through the keyhole of the library, saw you\r\nasleep, the book lying before you, entered, took away the book softly,\r\nmeant to glance at its contents and to return it. You were sleeping so\r\nsoundly she thought you would not wake for an hour; she carried it into\r\nthe library, leaving the door open, and there began to pore over it. She\r\nstumbled first on one of the passages in Latin; she hoped to find some\r\npart in plain English, turned over the leaves, putting her candle close\r\nto them, for the old woman’s eyes were dim, when she heard you make some\r\nsound in your sleep. Alarmed, she looked round; you were moving uneasily\r\nin your seat, and muttering to yourself. From watching you she was soon\r\ndiverted by the consequences of her own confounded curiosity and folly.\r\nIn moving, she had unconsciously brought the poor manuscript close to\r\nthe candle; the leaves caught the flame; her own cap and hand burning\r\nfirst made her aware of the mischief done. She threw down the book; her\r\nsleeve was in flames; she had first to tear off the sleeve, which\r\nwas, luckily for her, not sewn to her dress. By the time she recovered\r\npresence of mind to attend to the book, half its leaves were reduced to\r\ntinder. She did not dare then to replace what was left of the manuscript\r\non your table; returned with it to her room, hid it, and resolved to\r\nkeep her own secret. I should never have guessed it; I had never\r\neven spoken to her of the occurrence; but when I talked over the\r\ndisappearance of the book to Margrave last night, and expressed my\r\ndisbelief of your story, he said, in his merry way: ‘But do you think\r\nthat Fenwick is the only person curious about your cousin’s odd ways\r\nand strange history? Why, every servant in the household would have been\r\nequally curious. You have examined your servants, of course?’ ‘No, I\r\nnever thought of it.’ ‘Examine them now, then. Examine especially that\r\nold housekeeper. I observe a great change in her manner since I came\r\nhere, weeks ago, to look over the house. She has something on her\r\nmind,--I see it in her eyes.’ Then it occurred to me, too, that the\r\nwoman’s manner had altered, and that she seemed always in a tremble and\r\na fidget. I went at once to her room, and charged her with stealing the\r\nbook. She fell on her knees, and told the whole story as I have told\r\nit to you, and as I shall take care to tell it to all to whom I have so\r\nfoolishly blabbed my yet more foolish suspicions of yourself. But can\r\nyou forgive me, old friend?”\r\n\r\n“Heartily, heartily! And the book is burned?”\r\n\r\n“See;” and he produced a mutilated manuscript. Strange, the part\r\nburned--reduced, indeed, to tinder--was the concluding part that related\r\nto Haroun,--to Grayle: no vestige of that part was left; the earlier\r\nportions were scorched and mutilated, though in some places still\r\ndecipherable; but as my eye hastily ran over those places, I saw only\r\nmangled sentences of the experimental problems which the writer had so\r\nminutely elaborated.\r\n\r\n“Will you keep the manuscript as it is, and as long as you like?” said\r\nStrahan.\r\n\r\n“No, no; I will have nothing more to do with it. Consult some other\r\nman of science. And so this is the old woman’s whole story? No\r\naccomplice,--none? No one else shared her curiosity and her task?”\r\n\r\n“No. Oddly enough, though, she made much the same excuse for her pitiful\r\nfolly that the madman made for his terrible crime; she said, ‘the Devil\r\nput it into her head.’ Of course he did, as he puts everything wrong\r\ninto any one’s head. That does not mend the matter.”\r\n\r\n“How! did she, too, say she saw a Shadow and heard a voice?”\r\n\r\n“No; not such a liar as that, and not mad enough for such a lie. But\r\nshe said that when she was in bed, thinking over the book, something\r\nirresistible urged her to get up and go down into the study; swore she\r\nfelt something lead her by the hand; swore, too, that when she first\r\ndiscovered the manuscript was not in English, something whispered in her\r\near to turn over the leaves and approach them to the candle. But I had\r\nno patience to listen to all this rubbish. I sent her out of the\r\nhouse, bag and baggage. But, alas! is this to be the end of all my wise\r\ncousin’s grand discoveries?”\r\n\r\nTrue, of labours that aspired to bring into the chart of science new\r\nworlds, of which even the traditionary rumour was but a voice from the\r\nland of fable--nought left but broken vestiges of a daring footstep! The\r\nhope of a name imperishable amidst the loftiest hierarchy of Nature’s\r\nsecret temple, with all the pomp of recorded experiment, that applied to\r\nthe mysteries of Egypt and Chaldaea the inductions of Bacon, the tests\r\nof Liebig--was there nothing left of this but what, here and there,\r\nsome puzzled student might extract, garbled, mutilated, perhaps\r\nunintelligible, from shreds of sentences, wrecks of problems! O mind of\r\nman, can the works, on which thou wouldst found immortality below, be\r\nannulled into smoke and tinder by an inch of candle in the hand of an\r\nold woman!\r\n\r\nWhen Strahan left me, I went out, but not yet to visit patients. I stole\r\nthrough by-paths into the fields; I needed solitude to bring my thoughts\r\ninto shape and order. What was delusion, and what not? Was I right or\r\nthe Public? Was Margrave really the most innocent and serviceable of\r\nhuman beings, kindly affectionate, employing a wonderful acuteness for\r\nbenignant ends? Was I, in truth, indebted to him for the greatest\r\nboon one man can bestow on another,--for life rescued, for fair name\r\njustified? Or had he, by some demoniac sorcery, guided the hand of the\r\nmurderer against the life of the person who alone could imperil his own?\r\nHad he, by the same dark spells, urged the woman to the act that had\r\ndestroyed the only record of his monstrous being,--the only evidence\r\nthat I was not the sport of an illusion in the horror with which he\r\ninspired me?\r\n\r\nBut if the latter supposition could be admissible, did he use his\r\nagents only to betray them afterwards to exposure, and that, without any\r\npossible clew to his own detection as the instigator? Then, there came\r\nover me confused recollections of tales of mediaeval witchcraft, which\r\nI had read in boyhood. Were there not on judicial record attestation and\r\nevidence, solemn and circumstantial, of powers analogous to those\r\nnow exercised by Margrave,--of sorcerers instigating to sin through\r\ninfluences ascribed to Demons; making their apparitions glide through\r\nguarded walls, their voices heard from afar in the solitude of dungeons\r\nor monastic cells; subjugating victims to their will, by means which\r\nno vigilance could have detected, if the victims themselves had not\r\nconfessed the witchcraft that had ensnared, courting a sure and infamous\r\ndeath in that confession, preferring such death to a life so haunted?\r\nWere stories so gravely set forth in the pomp of judicial evidence,\r\nand in the history of times comparatively recent, indeed to be massed,\r\npell-mell together, as a moles indigesta of senseless superstition,--all\r\nthe witnesses to be deemed liars; all the victims and tools of the\r\nsorcerers, lunatics; all the examiners or judges, with their solemn\r\ngradations--lay and clerical--from Commissions of Inquiry to Courts of\r\nAppeal,--to be despised for credulity, loathed for cruelty; or, amidst\r\nrecords so numerous, so imposingly attested, were there the fragments of\r\na terrible truth? And had our ancestors been so unwise in those laws we\r\nnow deem so savage, by which the world was rid of scourges more awful\r\nand more potent than the felon with his candid dagger? Fell instigators\r\nof the evil in men’s secret hearts, shaping into action the vague,\r\nhalf-formed desire, and guiding with agencies impalpable, unseen, their\r\nspell-bound instruments of calamity and death.\r\n\r\nSuch were the gloomy questions that I--by repute, the sternest advocate\r\nof common-sense against fantastic errors; by profession, the searcher\r\ninto flesh and blood, and tissue and nerve and sinew, for the causes\r\nof all that disease the mechanism of the universal human frame; I,\r\nself-boasting physician, sceptic, philosopher, materialist--revolved,\r\nnot amidst gloomy pines, under grim winter skies, but as I paced slow\r\nthrough laughing meadows, and by the banks of merry streams, in the\r\nripeness of the golden August: the hum of insects in the fragrant grass,\r\nthe flutter of birds amid the delicate green of boughs checkered by\r\nplayful sunbeams and gentle shadows, and ever in sight of the resorts of\r\nbusy workday man,--walls, roof-tops, church-spires rising high; there,\r\nwhite and modern, the handwriting of our race, in this practical\r\nnineteenth century, on its square plain masonry and Doric shafts, the\r\nTown-Hall, central in the animated marketplace. And I--I--prying into\r\nlong-neglected corners and dust-holes of memory for what my reason had\r\nflung there as worthless rubbish; reviving the jargon of French law, in\r\nthe proces verbal, against a Gille de Retz, or an Urbain Grandier, and\r\nsifting the equity of sentences on witchcraft!\r\n\r\nBursting the links of this ghastly soliloquy with a laugh at my own\r\nfolly, I struck into a narrow path that led back towards the city, by\r\na quiet and rural suburb; the path wound on through a wide and solitary\r\nchurchyard, at the base of the Abbey-hill. Many of the former dwellers\r\non that eminence now slept in the lowly burial-ground at its foot; and\r\nthe place, mournfully decorated with the tombs which still jealously\r\nmark distinctions of rank amidst the levelling democracy of the grave,\r\nwas kept trim with the care which comes half from piety, and half from\r\npride.\r\n\r\nI seated myself on a bench, placed between the clipped yew-trees that\r\nbordered the path from the entrance to the church porch, deeming vaguely\r\nthat my own perplexing thoughts might imbibe a quiet from the quiet of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\n“And oh,” I murmured to myself, “oh that I had one bosom friend to\r\nwhom I might freely confide all these torturing riddles which I cannot\r\nsolve,--one who could read my heart, light up its darkness, exorcise its\r\nspectres; one in whose wisdom I could welcome a guide through the Nature\r\nwhich now suddenly changes her aspect, opening out from the walls with\r\nwhich I had fenced and enclosed her as mine own formal garden;--all her\r\npathways, therein, trimmed to my footstep; all her blooms grouped and\r\nharmonized to my own taste in colour; all her groves, all her caverns,\r\nbut the soothing retreats of a Muse or a Science; opening out--opening\r\nout, desert on desert, into clewless and measureless space! Gone is the\r\ngarden! Were its confines too narrow for Nature? Be it so! The Desert\r\nreplaces the garden, but where ends the Desert? Reft from my senses are\r\nthe laws which gave order and place to their old questionless realm. I\r\nstand lost and appalled amidst Chaos. Did my Mind misconstrue the laws\r\nit deemed fixed and immutable? Be it so! But still Nature cannot be\r\nlawless; Creation is not a Chaos. If my senses deceive me in some\r\nthings, they are still unerring in others; if thus, in some things,\r\nfallacious, still, in other things, truthful. Are there within me senses\r\nfiner than those I have cultured, or without me vistas of knowledge\r\nwhich instincts, apart from my senses, divine? So long as I deal\r\nwith the Finite alone, my senses suffice me; but when the Infinite is\r\nobtruded upon me there, are my senses faithless deserters? If so, is\r\nthere aught else in my royal resources of Man--whose ambition it is,\r\nfrom the first dawn of his glory as Thinker, to invade and to subjugate\r\nNature,--is there aught else to supply the place of those traitors, the\r\nsenses, who report to my Reason, their judge and their sovereign, as\r\ntruths seen and heard tales which my Reason forfeits her sceptre if she\r\ndoes not disdain as lies? Oh, for a friend! oh, for a guide!”\r\n\r\nAnd as I so murmured, my eye fell upon the form of a kneeling child,--at\r\nthe farther end of the burial-ground, beside a grave with its new\r\nheadstone gleaming white amidst the older moss-grown tombs, a female\r\nchild, her head bowed, her hands clasped. I could see but the outline\r\nof her small form in its sable dress,--an infant beside the dead. My eye\r\nand my thoughts were turned from that silent figure, too absorbed in my\r\nown restless tumult of doubt and dread, for sympathy with the grief or\r\nthe consolation of a kneeling child. And yet I should have remembered\r\nthat tomb! Again I murmured with a fierce impatience, “Oh, for a friend!\r\noh, for a guide!”\r\n\r\nI heard steps on the walk under the yews; and an old man came in sight,\r\nslightly bent, with long gray hair, but still with enough of vigour for\r\nyears to come, in his tread, firm, though slow, in the unshrunken muscle\r\nof his limbs and the steady light of his clear blue eye. I started.\r\nWas it possible? That countenance, marked, indeed, with the lines of\r\nlaborious thought, but sweet in the mildness of humanity, and serene\r\nin the peace of conscience! I could not be mistaken. Julius Faber was\r\nbefore me,--the profound pathologist, to whom my own proud self-esteem\r\nacknowledged inferiority, without humiliation; the generous benefactor\r\nto whom I owed my own smooth entrance into the arduous road of fame\r\nand fortune. I had longed for a friend, a guide; what I sought stood\r\nsuddenly at my side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nExplanation on Faber’s part was short and simple. The nephew whom he\r\ndesigned as the heir to his wealth had largely outstripped the liberal\r\nallowance made to him, had incurred heavy debts; and in order to\r\nextricate himself from the debts, had plunged into ruinous speculations.\r\nFaber had come back to England to save his heir from prison or outlawry,\r\nat the expense of more than three-fourths of the destined inheritance.\r\nTo add to all, the young man had married a young lady without fortune;\r\nthe uncle only heard of this marriage on arriving in England.\r\nThe spendthrift was hiding from his creditors in the house of his\r\nfather-in-law, in one of the western counties. Faber there sought\r\nhim; and on becoming acquainted with his wife, grew reconciled to the\r\nmarriage, and formed hopes of his nephew’s future redemption. He\r\nspoke, indeed, of the young wife with great affection. She was good and\r\nsensible; willing and anxious to encounter any privation by which her\r\nhusband might reprieve the effects of his folly. “So,” said Faber, “on\r\nconsultation with this excellent creature--for my poor nephew is so\r\nbroken down by repentance, that others must think for him how to exalt\r\nrepentance into reform--my plans were determined. I shall remove my\r\nprodigal from all scenes of temptation. He has youth, strength, plenty\r\nof energy, hitherto misdirected. I shall take him from the Old World\r\ninto the New. I have decided on Australia. The fortune still left to me,\r\nsmall here, will be ample capital there. It is not enough to maintain us\r\nseparately, so we must all live together. Besides, I feel that, though\r\nI have neither the strength or the experience which could best serve a\r\nyoung settler on a strange soil, still, under my eye, my poor boy will\r\nbe at once more prudent and more persevering. We sail next week.”\r\n\r\nFaber spoke so cheerfully that I knew not how to express compassion;\r\nyet, at his age, after a career of such prolonged and distinguished\r\nlabour, to resign the ease and comforts of the civilized state for\r\nthe hardships and rudeness of an infant colony, seemed to me a dreary\r\nprospect; and, as delicately, as tenderly as I could to one whom I loved\r\nand honoured as a father, I placed at his disposal the fortune which, in\r\ngreat part, I owed to him,--pressing him at least to take from it enough\r\nto secure to himself, in his own country, a home suited to his years\r\nand worthy of his station. He rejected all my offers, however earnestly\r\nurged on him, with his usual modest and gentle dignity; and assuring me\r\nthat he looked forward with great interest to a residence in lands new\r\nto his experience, and affording ample scope for the hardy enjoyments\r\nwhich had always most allured his tastes, he hastened to change the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“And who, think you, is the admirable helpmate my scape-grace has had\r\nthe saving good luck to find? A daughter of the worthy man who undertook\r\nthe care of poor Dr. Lloyd’s orphans,--the orphans who owed so much to\r\nyour generous exertions to secure a provision for them; and that child,\r\nnow just risen from her father’s grave, is my pet companion, my darling\r\newe lamb,--Dr. Lloyd’s daughter Amy.”\r\n\r\nHere the child joined us, quickening her pace as she recognized the old\r\nman, and nestling to his side as she glanced wistfully towards myself.\r\nA winning, candid, lovable child’s face, somewhat melancholy, somewhat\r\nmore thoughtful than is common to the face of childhood, but calm,\r\nintelligent, and ineffably mild. Presently she stole from the old man,\r\nand put her hand in mine.\r\n\r\n“Are you not the kind gentleman who came to see him that night when he\r\npassed away from us, and who, they all say at home, was so good to my\r\nbrothers and me? Yes, I recollect you now.” And she put her pure face to\r\nmine, wooing me to kiss it.\r\n\r\nI kind! I good! I--I! Alas! she little knew, little guessed, the\r\nwrathful imprecation her father had bequeathed to me that fatal night!\r\n\r\nI did not dare to kiss Dr. Lloyd’s orphan daughter, but my tears fell\r\nover her hand. She took them as signs of pity, and, in her infant\r\nthankfulness, silently kissed me.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my friend!” I murmured to Faber, “I have much that I yearn to say\r\nto you--alone--alone! Come to my house with me, be at least my guest as\r\nlong as you stay in this town.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” said Faber, looking at me more intently than he had done\r\nbefore, and with the true eye of the practised Healer, at once soft and\r\npenetrating.\r\n\r\nHe rose, took my arm, and whispering a word in the ear of the little\r\ngirl, she went on before us, turning her head, as she gained the gate,\r\nfor another look at her father’s grave. As we walked to my house, Julius\r\nFaber spoke to me much of this child. Her brothers were all at school;\r\nshe was greatly attached to his nephew’s wife; she had become yet more\r\nattached to Faber himself, though on so short an acquaintance; it had\r\nbeen settled that she was to accompany the emigrants to Australia.\r\n\r\n“There,” said he, “the sum, that some munificent, but unknown friend\r\nof her father has settled on her, will provide her no mean dower for a\r\ncolonist’s wife, when the time comes for her to bring a blessing to\r\nsome other hearth than ours.” He went on to say that she had wished\r\nto accompany him to L----, in order to visit her father’s grave before\r\ncrossing the wide seas; “and she has taken such fond care of me all the\r\nway, that you might fancy I were the child of the two. I come back to\r\nthis town, partly to dispose of a few poor houses in it which still\r\nbelong to me, principally to bid you farewell before quitting the Old\r\nWorld, no doubt forever. So, on arriving to-day, I left Amy by herself\r\nin the churchyard while I went to your house, but you were from home.\r\nAnd now I must congratulate you on the reputation you have so rapidly\r\nacquired, which has even surpassed my predictions.”\r\n\r\n“You are aware,” said I, falteringly, “of the extraordinary charge from\r\nwhich that part of my reputation dearest to all men has just emerged!”\r\n\r\nHe had but seen a short account in a weekly journal, written after my\r\nrelease. He asked details, which I postponed.\r\n\r\nReaching my home, I hastened to provide for the comfort of my two\r\nunexpected guests; strove to rally myself, to be cheerful. Not till\r\nnight, when Julius Faber and I were alone together, did I touch on\r\nwhat was weighing at my heart. Then, drawing to his side, I told him\r\nall,--all of which the substance is herein written, from the deathscene\r\nin Dr. Lloyd’s chamber to the hour in which I had seen Dr. Lloyd’s child\r\nat her father’s grave. Some of the incidents and conversations which had\r\nmost impressed me I had already committed to writing, in the fear\r\nthat, otherwise, my fancy might forge for its own thraldom the links\r\nof reminiscence which my memory might let fall from its chain. Faber\r\nlistened with a silence only interrupted by short pertinent questions;\r\nand when I had done, he remained thoughtful for some moments; then the\r\ngreat physician replied thus:--\r\n\r\n“I take for granted your conviction of the reality of all you tell\r\nme, even of the Luminous Shadow, of the bodiless Voice; but, before\r\nadmitting the reality itself, we must abide by the old maxim, not to\r\naccept as cause to effect those agencies which belong to the\r\nMarvellous, when causes less improbable for the effect can be rationally\r\nconjectured. In this case are there not such causes? Certainly there\r\nare--”\r\n\r\n“There are?”\r\n\r\n“Listen; you are one of those men who attempt to stifle their own\r\nimagination. But in all completed intellect, imagination exists, and\r\nwill force its way; deny it healthful vents, and it may stray into\r\nmorbid channels. The death-room of Dr. Lloyd deeply impressed your\r\nheart, far more than your pride would own. This is clear from the\r\npains you took to exonerate your conscience, in your generosity to the\r\norphans. As the heart was moved, so was the imagination stirred; and,\r\nunaware to yourself, prepared for much that subsequently appealed to\r\nit. Your sudden love, conceived in the very grounds of the house so\r\nassociated with recollections in themselves strange and romantic;\r\nthe peculiar temperament and nature of the girl to whom your love was\r\nattracted; her own visionary beliefs, and the keen anxiety which infused\r\ninto your love a deeper poetry of sentiment,--all insensibly tended to\r\ninduce the imagination to dwell on the Wonderful; and, in overstriving\r\nto reconcile each rarer phenomenon to the most positive laws of Nature,\r\nyour very intellect could discover no solution but in the Preternatural.\r\n\r\n“You visit a man who tells you he has seen Sir Philip Derval’s ghost; on\r\nthat very evening, you hear a strange story, in which Sir Philip’s name\r\nis mixed up with a tale of murder, implicating two mysterious pretenders\r\nto magic,--Louis Grayle and the Sage of Aleppo. The tale so interests\r\nyour fancy that even the glaring impossibility of a not unimportant part\r\nof it escapes your notice,--namely, the account of a criminal trial in\r\nwhich the circumstantial evidence was more easily attainable than in all\r\nthe rest of the narrative, but which could not legally have taken place\r\nas told. Thus it is whenever the mind begins, unconsciously, to admit\r\nthe shadow of the Supernatural; the Obvious is lost to the eye that\r\nplunges its gaze into the Obscure. Almost immediately afterwards you\r\nbecome acquainted with a young stranger, whose traits of character\r\ninterest and perplex, attract yet revolt you. All this time you are\r\nengaged in a physiological work which severely tasks the brain, and in\r\nwhich you examine the intricate question of soul distinct from mind.\r\n\r\n“And, here, I can conceive a cause deep-hid amongst what metaphysicians\r\nwould call latent associations, for a train of thought which disposed\r\nyou to accept the fantastic impressions afterwards made on you by\r\nthe scene in the Museum and the visionary talk of Sir Philip Derval.\r\nDoubtless, when at college you first studied metaphysical speculation\r\nyou would have glanced over Beattie’s ‘Essay on Truth’ as one of the\r\nworks written in opposition to your favourite, David Hume.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I read the book, but I have long since forgotten its arguments.”\r\n\r\n“Well in that essay, Beattie(1) cites the extraordinary instance of\r\nSimon Browne, a learned and pious clergyman, who seriously disbelieved\r\nthe existence of his own soul; and imagined that, by interposition of\r\nDivine power, his soul was annulled, and nothing left but a principle of\r\nanimal life, which he held in common with the brutes! When, years ago, a\r\nthoughtful imaginative student, you came on that story, probably enough\r\nyou would have paused, revolved in your own mind and fancy what kind\r\nof a creature a man might be, if, retaining human life and merely\r\nhuman understanding, he was deprived of the powers and properties which\r\nreasoners have ascribed to the existence of soul. Something in this\r\nyoung man, unconsciously to yourself, revives that forgotten train of\r\nmeditative ideas. His dread of death as the final cessation of being,\r\nhis brute-like want of sympathy with his kind, his incapacity to\r\ncomprehend the motives which carry man on to scheme and to build for a\r\nfuture that extends beyond his grave,--all start up before you at the\r\nvery moment your reason is overtasked, your imagination fevered, in\r\nseeking the solution of problems which, to a philosophy based upon your\r\nsystem, must always remain insoluble. The young man’s conversation not\r\nonly thus excites your fancies,--it disturbs your affections. He speaks\r\nnot only of drugs that renew youth, but of charms that secure love. You\r\ntremble for your Lilian while you hear him! And the brain thus tasked,\r\nthe imagination thus inflamed, the heart thus agitated, you are\r\npresented to Sir Philip Derval, whose ghost your patient had supposed he\r\nsaw weeks ago.\r\n\r\n“This person, a seeker after an occult philosophy, which had possibly\r\nacquainted him with some secrets in nature beyond the pale of our\r\nconventional experience, though, when analyzed, they might prove to be\r\nquite reconcilable with sober science, startles you with an undefined\r\nmysterious charge against the young man who had previously seemed to you\r\ndifferent from ordinary mortals. In a room stored with the dead things\r\nof the brute soulless world, your brain becomes intoxicated with\r\nthe fumes of some vapour which produces effects not uncommon in the\r\nsuperstitious practices of the East; your brain, thus excited, brings\r\ndistinctly before you the vague impressions it had before received.\r\nMargrave becomes identified with the Louis Grayle of whom you had\r\npreviously heard an obscure and, legendary tale, and all the anomalies\r\nin his character are explained by his being that which you had\r\ncontended, in your physiological work, it was quite possible for man\r\nto be,--namely, mind and body without soul! You were startled by the\r\nmonster which man would be were your own theory possible; and in order\r\nto reconcile the contradictions in this very monster, you account\r\nfor knowledge, and for powers that mind without soul could not have\r\nattained, by ascribing to this prodigy broken memories of a former\r\nexistence, demon attributes from former proficiency in evil magic.\r\nMy friend, there is nothing here which your own study of morbid\r\nidiosyncracies should not suffice to solve.”\r\n\r\n“So, then,” said I, “you would reduce all that have affected my senses\r\nas realities into the deceit of illusions? But,” I added, in a whisper,\r\nterrified by my own question, “do not physiologists agree in this:\r\nnamely, that though illusory phantasms may haunt the sane as well as the\r\ninsane, the sane know that they are only illusions, and the insane do\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\n“Such a distinction,” answered Faber, “is far too arbitrary and rigid\r\nfor more than a very general and qualified acceptance. Muller, indeed,\r\nwho is perhaps the highest authority on such a subject, says, with\r\nprudent reserve, ‘When a person who is not insane sees spectres\r\nand believes, them to be real, his intellect must be imperfectly\r\nexercised.’(2) He would, indeed, be a bold physician who maintained that\r\nevery man who believed he had really seen a ghost was of unsound mind.\r\nIn Dr. Abercrombie’s interesting account of spectral illusions, he tells\r\nus of a servant-girl who believed she saw, at the foot of her bed,\r\nthe apparition of Curran, in a sailor’s jacket and an immense pair of\r\nwhiskers.(3) No doubt the spectre was an illusion, and Dr. Abercrombie\r\nvery ingeniously suggests the association of ideas by which the\r\napparition was conjured up with the grotesque adjuncts of the jacket\r\nand the whiskers; but the servant-girl, in believing the reality of the\r\napparition, was certainly not insane. When I read in the American\r\npublic journals(4) of ‘spirit manifestations,’ in which large numbers of\r\npersons, of at least the average degree of education, declare that they\r\nhave actually witnessed various phantasms, much more extraordinary\r\nthan all which you have confided to me, and arrive, at once, at the\r\nconclusion that they are thus put into direct communication with\r\ndeparted souls, I must assume that they are under an illusion; but I\r\nshould be utterly unwarranted in supposing that, because they credited\r\nthat illusion, they were insane. I should only say with Muller, that in\r\ntheir reasoning on the phenomena presented to them, ‘their intellect was\r\nimperfectly exercised.’ And an impression made on the senses, being in\r\nitself sufficiently rare to excite our wonder, may be strengthened till\r\nit takes the form of a positive fact, by various coincidences which\r\nare accepted as corroborative testimony, yet which are, nevertheless,\r\nnothing more than coincidences found in every day matters of business,\r\nbut only emphatically noticed when we can exclaim, ‘How astonishing!’\r\nIn your case such coincidences have been, indeed, very signal, and might\r\nwell aggravate the perplexities into which your reason was thrown. Sir\r\nPhilip Derval’s murder, the missing casket, the exciting nature of the\r\nmanuscript, in which a superstitious interest is already enlisted by\r\nyour expectation to find in it the key to the narrator’s boasted powers,\r\nand his reasons for the astounding denunciation of the man whom you\r\nsuspect to be his murderer,--in all this there is much to confirm, nay,\r\nto cause, an illusion; and for that very reason, when examined by strict\r\nlaws of evidence, in all this there is but additional proof that the\r\nillusion was--only illusion. Your affections contribute to strengthen\r\nyour fancy in its war on your reason. The girl you so passionately love\r\ndevelops, to your disquietude and terror, the visionary temperament\r\nwhich, at her age, is ever liable to fantastic caprices. She hears\r\nMargrave’s song, which you say has a wildness of charm that affects\r\nand thrills even you. Who does not know the power of music? and of all\r\nmusic, there is none so potential as that of the human voice. Thus, in\r\nsome languages, charm and song are identical expressions; and even when\r\na critic, in our own sober newspapers, extols a Malibran or a Grisi, you\r\nmay be sure that he will call her ‘enchantress.’ Well, this lady, your\r\nbetrothed, in whom the nervous system is extremely impressionable, hears\r\na voice which, even to your ear, is strangely melodious, and sees a form\r\nand face which, even to your eye, are endowed with a singular character\r\nof beauty. Her fancy is impressed by what she thus hears and sees; and\r\nimpressed the more because, by a coincidence not very uncommon, a face\r\nlike that which she beholds has before been presented to her in a dream\r\nor a revery. In the nobleness of genuine, confiding, reverential love,\r\nrather than impute to your beloved a levity of sentiment that would seem\r\nto you a treason, you accept the chimera of ‘magical fascination.’\r\nIn this frame of mind you sit down to read the memoir of a mystical\r\nenthusiast. Do you begin now to account for the Luminous Shadow? A\r\ndream! And a dream no less because your eyes were open and you believed\r\nyourself awake. The diseased imagination resembles those mirrors which,\r\nbeing themselves distorted, represent distorted pictures as correct.\r\n\r\n“And even this Memoir of Sir Philip Derval’s--can you be quite sure that\r\nyou actually read the part which relates to Haroun and Louis Grayle? You\r\nsay that, while perusing the manuscript, you saw the Luminous Shadow,\r\nand became insensible. The old woman says you were fast asleep. May you\r\nnot really have fallen into a slumber, and in that slumber have dreamed\r\nthe parts of the tale that relate to Grayle,--dreamed that you beheld\r\nthe Shadow? Do you remember what is said so well by Dr. Abercrombie,\r\nto authorize the explanation I suggest to you: ‘A person under the\r\ninfluence of some strong mental impression falls asleep for a few\r\nseconds, perhaps without being sensible of it: some scene or person\r\nappears in a dream, and he starts up under the conviction that it was a\r\nspectral appearance.’” (5)\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “the apparition was seen by me again, and when,\r\ncertainly, I was not sleeping.”\r\n\r\n“True; and who should know better than a physician so well read as\r\nyourself that a spectral illusion once beheld is always apt to return\r\nagain in the same form? Thus, Goethe was long haunted by one image,--the\r\nphantom of a flower unfolding itself, and developing new flowers.(6)\r\nThus, one of our most distinguished philosophers tells us of a lady\r\nknown to himself, who would see her husband, hear him move and speak,\r\nwhen he was not even in the house.(7) But instances of the facility with\r\nwhich phantasms, once admitted, repeat themselves to the senses, are\r\nnumberless. Many are recorded by Hibbert and Abercrombie, and\r\nevery physician in extensive practice can add largely, from his own\r\nexperience, to the list. Intense self-concentration is, in itself, a\r\nmighty magician. The magicians of the East inculcate the necessity\r\nof fast, solitude, and meditation for the due development of their\r\nimaginary powers. And I have no doubt with effect; because fast,\r\nsolitude, and meditation--in other words, thought or fancy intensely\r\nconcentred--will both raise apparitions and produce the invoker’s belief\r\nin them. Spinello, striving to conceive the image of Lucifer for his\r\npicture of the Fallen Angels, was at last actually haunted by the Shadow\r\nof the Fiend. Newton himself has been subjected to a phantom, though\r\nto him, Son of Light, the spectre presented was that of the sun! You\r\nremember the account that Newton gives to Locke of this visionary\r\nappearance. He says that ‘though he had looked at the sun with his\r\nright eye only, and not with the left, yet his fancy began to make an\r\nimpression upon his left eye as well as his right; for if he shut his\r\nright and looked upon the clouds, or a book, or any bright object with\r\nhis left eye, he could see the sun almost as plain as with the right, if\r\nhe did but intend his fancy a little while on it;’ nay, ‘for some months\r\nafter, as often as he began to meditate on the phenomena, the spectrum\r\nof the sun began to return, even though he lay in bed at midnight, with\r\nhis curtains drawn!’ Seeing, then, how any vivid impression once made\r\nwill recur, what wonder that you should behold in your prison the\r\nShining Shadow that had first startled you in a wizard’s chamber when\r\nporing over the records of a murdered visionary? The more minutely\r\nyou analyze your own hallucinations--pardon me the word--the more they\r\nassume the usual characteristics of a dream; contradictory, illogical,\r\neven in the marvels they represent. Can any two persons be more totally\r\nunlike each other, not merely as to form and years, but as to all the\r\nelements of character, than the Grayle of whom you read, or believe\r\nyou read, and the Margrave in whom you evidently think that Grayle is\r\nexistent still? The one represented, you say, as gloomy, saturnine, with\r\nvehement passions, but with an original grandeur of thought and will,\r\nconsumed by an internal remorse; the other you paint to me as a joyous\r\nand wayward darling of Nature, acute yet frivolous, free from even\r\nthe ordinary passions of youth, taking delight in innocent amusements,\r\nincapable of continuous study, without a single pang of repentance\r\nfor the crimes you so fancifully impute to him. And now, when your\r\nsuspicions, so romantically conceived, are dispelled by positive facts,\r\nnow, when it is clear that Margrave neither murdered Sir Philip Derval\r\nnor abstracted the memoir, you still, unconsciously to yourself, draw\r\non your imagination in order to excuse the suspicion your pride of\r\nintellect declines to banish, and suppose that this youthful sorcerer\r\ntempted the madman to the murder, the woman to the theft--”\r\n\r\n“But you forget the madman said ‘that he was led on by the Luminous\r\nShadow of a beautiful youth,’ that the woman said also that she was\r\nimpelled by some mysterious agency.”\r\n\r\n“I do not forget those coincidences; but how your learning would dismiss\r\nthem as nugatory were your imagination not disposed to exaggerate them!\r\nWhen you read the authentic histories of any popular illusion, such\r\nas the spurious inspirations of the Jansenist Convulsionaries, the\r\napparitions that invaded convents, as deposed in the trial of Urbain\r\nGrandier, the confessions of witches and wizards in places the\r\nmost remote from each other, or, at this day, the tales of\r\n‘spirit-manifestation’ recorded in half the towns and villages of\r\nAmerica,--do not all the superstitious impressions of a particular time\r\nhave a common family likeness? What one sees, another sees, though there\r\nhas been no communication between the two. I cannot tell you why these\r\nphantasms thus partake of the nature of an atmospheric epidemic; the\r\nfact remains incontestable. And strange as may be the coincidence\r\nbetween your impressions of a mystic agency and those of some other\r\nbrains not cognizant of the chimeras of your own, still, is it not\r\nsimpler philosophy to say, ‘They are coincidences of the same nature\r\nwhich made witches in the same epoch all tell much the same story of\r\nthe broomsticks they rode and the sabbats at which they danced to the\r\nfiend’s piping,’ and there leave the matter, as in science we must leave\r\nmany of the most elementary and familiar phenomena inexplicable as to\r\ntheir causes,--is not this, I say, more philosophical than to insist\r\nupon an explanation which accepts the supernatural rather than leave the\r\nextraordinary unaccounted for?”\r\n\r\n“As you speak,” said I, resting my downcast face upon my hand, “I should\r\nspeak to any patient who had confided to me the tale I have told to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“And yet the explanation does not wholly satisfy you? Very likely: to\r\nsome phenomena there is, as yet, no explanation. Perhaps Newton himself\r\ncould not explain quite to his own satisfaction why he was haunted at\r\nmidnight by the spectrum of a sun; though I have no doubt that some\r\nlater philosopher whose ingenuity has been stimulated by Newton’s\r\naccount, has, by this time, suggested a rational solution of\r\nthat enigma.(8) To return to your own case. I have offered such\r\ninterpretations of the mysteries that confound you as appear to me\r\nauthorized by physiological science. Should you adduce other facts which\r\nphysiological science wants the data to resolve into phenomena always\r\nnatural, however rare, still hold fast to that simple saying of Goethe:\r\n‘Mysteries are not necessarily miracles.’ And if all which physiological\r\nscience comprehends in its experience wholly fails us, I may then\r\nhazard certain conjectures in which, by acknowledging ignorance, one is\r\ncompelled to recognize the Marvellous (for as where knowledge enters,\r\nthe Marvellous recedes, so where knowledge falters, the Marvellous\r\nadvances); yet still, even in those conjectures, I will distinguish the\r\nMarvellous from the Supernatural. But, for the present, I advise you to\r\naccept the guess that may best quiet the fevered imagination which any\r\nbolder guess would only more excite.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said I, rising proudly to the full height of my\r\nstature, my head erect and my heart defying. “And so let this subject\r\nbe renewed no more between us. I will brood over it no more myself.\r\nI regain the unclouded realm of my human intelligence; and, in that\r\nintelligence, I mock the sorcerer and disdain the spectre.”\r\n\r\n(1) Beattie’s “Essay on Truth,” part i. c. ii. 3.

(15th edition.)\r\n\r\nThis author, not more to be admired for his intelligence than his\r\ncandour, and who is entitled to praise for a higher degree of original\r\nthought than that to which he modestly pretends, relates a curious\r\nanecdote illustrating “the analogy between dreaming and spectral\r\nillusion, which he received from the gentleman to which it occurred,--an\r\neminent medical friend:” “Having sat up late one evening, under\r\nconsiderable anxiety for one of his children, who was ill, he fell\r\nasleep in his chair, and had a frightful dream, in which the prominent\r\nfigure was an immense baboon. He awoke with the fright, got up\r\ninstantly, and walked to a table which was in the middle of the room.\r\nHe was then quite awake, and quite conscious of the articles around him;\r\nbut close by the wall in the end of the apartment he distinctly saw the\r\nbaboon making the same grimaces which he had seen in his dreams; and\r\nthis spectre continued visible for about half a minute.” Now, a man\r\nwho saw only a baboon would be quite ready to admit that it was but an\r\noptical illusion; but if, instead of a baboon, he had seen an intimate\r\nfriend, and that friend, by some coincidence of time, had died about\r\nthat date, he would be a very strong-minded man if he admitted for the\r\nmystery of seeing his friend the same natural solution which he would\r\nreadily admit for seeing a baboon.\r\n\r\n(6) See Muller’s observations on this phenomenon, “Physiology of the\r\nSenses,” Baley’s translation, p. 1395.\r\n\r\n(7) Sir David Brewster’s Letters on Natural Magic, p. 39.\r\n\r\n(8) Newton’s explanation is as follows: “This story I tell you to let\r\nyou understand, that in the observation related by Mr. Boyle, the man’s\r\nfancy probably concurred with the impression made by the sun’s light\r\nto produce that phantasm of the sun which he constantly saw in bright\r\nobjects, and so your question about the cause of this phantasm involves\r\nanother about the power of the fancy, which I must confess is too hard a\r\nknot for me to untie. To place this effect in a constant motion is hard,\r\nbecause the sun ought then to appear perpetually. It seems rather\r\nto consist in a disposition of the sensorium to move the imagination\r\nstrongly, and to be easily moved both by the imagination and by the\r\nlight as often as bright objects are looked upon.”--Letter from Sir I.\r\nNewton to Locke, Lord Kinq’s Life of Locke, vol. i. pp. 405-408.\r\n\r\nDr. Roget (Animal and Vegetable Physiology considered with reference to\r\nNatural Theology, “Bridgewater Treatise,” pp. 524, 525) thus refers to\r\nthis phenomenon, which he states “all of us may experience “:--\r\n\r\n“When the impressions are very vivid” (Dr. Roget is speaking of visual\r\nimpressions), “another phenomenon often takes place,--namely, their\r\nsubsequent recurrence after a certain interval, during which they are\r\nnot felt, and quite independently of any renewed application of the\r\ncause which had originally excited them.” (I mark by italics the words\r\nwhich more precisely coincide with Julius Faber’s explanations.) “If,\r\nfor example, we look steadfastly at the sun for a second or two, and\r\nthen immediately close our eyes, the image, or spectrum, of the sun\r\nremains for a long time present to the mind, as if the light were still\r\nacting on the retina. It then gradually fades and disappears; but if\r\nwe continue to keep the eyes shut, the same impression will, after\r\na certain time, recur, and again vanish: and this phenomenon will be\r\nrepeated at intervals, the sensation becoming fainter at each renewal.\r\nIt is probable that these reappearances of the image, after the\r\nlight which produced the original impression has been withdrawn, are\r\noccasioned by spontaneous affections of the retina itself which are\r\nconveyed to the sensorium. In other cases, where the impressions are\r\nless strong, the physical changes producing these changes are perhaps\r\nconfined to the sensorium.”\r\n\r\nIt may be said that there is this difference between the spectrum of the\r\nsun and such a phantom as that which perplexed Allen Fenwick,--namely,\r\nthat the sun has been actually beheld before its visionary appearance\r\ncan be reproduced, and that Allen Fenwick only imagines he has seen the\r\napparition which repeats itself to his fancy. “But there are grounds for\r\nthe suspicion” (says Dr. Hibbert, “Philosophy of Apparitions,” p. 250),\r\n“that when ideas of vision are vivified to the height of sensation, a\r\ncorresponding affection of the optic nerve accompanies the illusion.”\r\n Muller (“Physiology of the Senses,” p. 1392, Baley’s translation) states\r\nthe same opinion still more strongly; and Sir David Brewster, quoted\r\nby Dr. Hibbert (p. 251) says: “In examining these mental impressions, I\r\nhave found that they follow the motions of the eyeball exactly like the\r\nspectral impressions of luminous objects, and that they resemble them\r\nalso in their apparent immobility when the eye is displaced by an\r\nexternal force. If this result (which I state with much diffidence, from\r\nhaving only my own experience in its favour) shall be found generally\r\ntrue by others, it will follow that the objects of mental contemplation\r\nmay be seen as distinctly as external objects, and will occupy the same\r\nlocal position in the axis of vision, as if they had been formed by the\r\nagency of light.” Hence the impression of an image once conveyed to the\r\nsenses, no matter how, whether by actual or illusory vision, is liable\r\nto renewal, “independently of any renewed application of the cause which\r\nhad originally excited it,” and the image can be seen in that renewal\r\n“as distinctly as external objects,” for indeed “the revival of the\r\nfantastic figure really does affect those points of the retina which had\r\nbeen previously impressed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nJulius Faber and Amy Lloyd stayed in my house three days, I and in their\r\npresence I felt a healthful sense of security and peace. Amy wished to\r\nvisit her father’s house, and I asked Faber, in taking her there, to\r\nseize the occasion to see Lilian, that he might communicate to me his\r\nimpression of a case so peculiar. I prepared Mrs. Ashleigh for this\r\nvisit by a previous note. When the old man and the child came back, both\r\nbrought me comfort. Amy was charmed with Lilian, who had received her\r\nwith the sweetness natural to her real character, and I loved to hear\r\nLilian’s praise from those innocent lips.\r\n\r\nFaber’s report was still more calculated to console me.\r\n\r\n“I have seen, I have conversed with her long and familiarly. You were\r\nquite right,--there is no tendency to consumption in that exquisite, if\r\ndelicate, organization; nor do I see cause for the fear to which your\r\nstatement had pre-inclined me. That head is too nobly formed for any\r\nconstitutional cerebral infirmity. In its organization, ideality,\r\nwonder, veneration, are large, it is true, but they are balanced by\r\nother organs, now perhaps almost dormant, but which will come into\r\nplay as life passes from romance into duty. Something at this moment\r\nevidently oppresses her mind. In conversing with her, I observe\r\nabstraction, listlessness; but I am so convinced of her truthfulness,\r\nthat if she has once told you she returned your affection, and pledged\r\nto you her faith, I should, in your place, rest perfectly satisfied that\r\nwhatever be the cloud that now rests on her imagination, and for the\r\ntime obscures the idea of yourself, it will pass away.”\r\n\r\nFaber was a believer in the main divisions of phrenology, though he did\r\nnot accept all the dogmas of Gall and Spurzheim; while, to my mind,\r\nthe refutation of phrenology in its fundamental propositions had been\r\ntriumphantly established by the lucid arguments of Sir W. Hamilton.(1)\r\nBut when Faber rested on phrenological observations assurances in honour\r\nof Lilian, I forgot Sir W. Hamilton, and believed in phrenology. As\r\niron girders and pillars expand and contract with the mere variations\r\nof temperature, so will the strongest conviction on which the human\r\nintellect rests its judgment vary with the changes of the human heart;\r\nand the building is only safe where these variations are foreseen and\r\nallowed for by a wisdom intent on self-knowledge.(2)\r\n\r\nThere was much in the affection that had sprung up between Julius Faber\r\nand Amy Lloyd which touched my heart and softened all its emotions. This\r\nman, unblessed, like myself, by conjugal and parental ties, had, in his\r\nsolitary age, turned for solace to the love of a child, as I, in the\r\npride of manhood, had turned to the love of woman. But his love was\r\nwithout fear, without jealousy, without trouble. My sunshine came to\r\nme in a fitful ray, through clouds that had gathered over my noon; his\r\nsunshine covered all his landscape, hallowed and hallowing by the calm\r\nof declining day.\r\n\r\nAnd Amy was no common child. She had no exuberant imagination; she was\r\nhaunted by no whispers from Afar; she was a creature fitted for the\r\nearth,--to accept its duties and to gladden its cares. Her tender\r\nobservation, fine and tranquil, was alive to all the important household\r\ntrifles by which, at the earliest age, man’s allotted soother asserts\r\nher privilege to tend and to comfort. It was pleasant to see her\r\nmoving so noiselessly through the rooms I had devoted to her venerable\r\nprotector, knowing all his simple wants, and providing for them as if by\r\nthe mechanism of a heart exquisitely moulded to the loving uses of life.\r\nSometimes when I saw her setting his chair by the window (knowing, as\r\nI did, how much he habitually loved to be near the light) and smoothing\r\nhis papers (in which he was apt to be unmethodical), placing the mark\r\nin his book when he ceased to read, divining, almost without his glance,\r\nsome wish passing through his mind, and then seating herself at his\r\nfeet, often with her work--which was always destined for him or for one\r\nof her absent brothers,--now and then with the one small book that\r\nshe had carried with her, a selection of Bible stories compiled for\r\nchildren,--sometimes when I saw her thus, how I wished that Lilian,\r\ntoo, could have seen her, and have compared her own ideal fantasies with\r\nthose young developments of the natural heavenly Woman!\r\n\r\nBut was there nothing in that sight from which I, proud of my arid\r\nreason even in its perplexities, might have taken lessons for myself?\r\n\r\nOn the second evening of Faber’s visit I brought to him the draft of\r\ndeeds for the sale of his property. He had never been a man of business\r\nout of his profession; he was impatient to sell his property, and\r\ndisposed to accept an offer at half its value. I insisted on taking\r\non myself the task of negotiator; perhaps, too, in this office I was\r\negotistically anxious to prove to the great physician that which he\r\nbelieved to be my “hallucination” had in no way obscured my commonsense\r\nin the daily affairs of life. So I concluded, and in a few hours,\r\nterms for his property that were only just, but were infinitely more\r\nadvantageous than had appeared to himself to be possible. But as I\r\napproached him with the papers, he put his finger to his lips. Amy was\r\nstanding by him with her little book in her hand, and his own Bible lay\r\nopen on the table. He was reading to her from the Sacred Volume itself,\r\nand impressing on her the force and beauty of one of the Parables, the\r\nadaptation of which had perplexed her; when he had done, she kissed him,\r\nbade him goodnight, and went away to rest. Then said Faber thoughtfully,\r\nand as if to himself more than me,--\r\n\r\n“What a lovely bridge between old age and childhood is religion! How\r\nintuitively the child begins with prayer and worship on entering life,\r\nand how intuitively on quitting life the old man turns back to prayer\r\nand worship, putting himself again side by side with the infant!”\r\n\r\nI made no answer, but, after a pause, spoke of fines and freeholds,\r\ntitle-deeds and money; and when the business on hand was concluded,\r\nasked my learned guest if, before he departed, he would deign to look\r\nover the pages of my ambitious Physiological Work. There were parts of\r\nit on which I much desired his opinion, touching on subjects in which\r\nhis special studies made him an authority as high as our land possessed.\r\n\r\nHe made me bring him the manuscript, and devoted much of that night and\r\nthe next day to its perusal.\r\n\r\nWhen he gave it me back, which was not till the morning of his\r\ndeparture, he commenced with eulogies on the scope of its design, and\r\nthe manner of its execution, which flattered my vanity so much that\r\nI could not help exclaiming, “Then, at least, there is no trace of\r\n‘hallucination’ here!”\r\n\r\n“Alas, my poor Allen! here, perhaps, hallucination, or self-deception,\r\nis more apparent than in all the strange tales you confided to me. For\r\nhere is the hallucination of the man seated on the shores of Nature,\r\nand who would say to its measureless sea, ‘So far shalt thou go and no\r\nfarther;’ here is the hallucination of the creature, who, not content\r\nwith exploring the laws of the Creator, ends with submitting to his\r\ninterpretation of some three or four laws, in the midst of a code of\r\nwhich all the rest are in a language unknown to him, the powers and\r\nfree-will of the Lawgiver Himself; here is the hallucination by which\r\nNature is left Godless, because Man is left soulless. What would matter\r\nall our speculations on a Deity who would cease to exist for us when we\r\nare in the grave? Why mete out, like Archytas, the earth and the sea,\r\nand number the sands on the shore that divides them, if the end of this\r\nwisdom be a handful of dust sprinkled over a skull!\r\n\r\n\r\n   “‘Nec quidquam tibi prodest\r\n     Aerias tentasse dornos, animoque rotundum\r\n     Percurrisse polum naorituro.’\r\n\r\n“Your book is a proof of the soul that you fail to discover. Without a\r\nsoul, no man would work for a Future that begins for his fame when the\r\nbreath is gone from his body. Do you remember how you saw that little\r\nchild praying at the grave of her father? Shall I tell you that in her\r\nsimple orisons she prayed for the benefactor,--who had cared for\r\nthe orphan; who had reared over dust that tomb which, in a Christian\r\nburial-ground, is a mute but perceptible memorial of Christian hopes;\r\nthat the child prayed, haughty man, for you? And you sat by, knowing\r\nnought of this; sat by, amongst the graves, troubled and tortured with\r\nghastly doubts, vain of a reason that was sceptical of eternity, and yet\r\nshaken like a reed by a moment’s marvel. Shall I tell the child to pray\r\nfor you no more; that you disbelieve in a soul? If you do so, what is\r\nthe efficacy of prayer? Speak, shall I tell her this? Shall the infant\r\npray for you never more?”\r\n\r\nI was silent; I was thrilled.\r\n\r\n“Has it never occurred to you, who, in denying all innate perceptions\r\nas well as ideas, have passed on to deductions from which poor Locke,\r\nhumble Christian that he was, would have shrunk in dismay,--has it never\r\noccurred to you as a wonderful fact, that the easiest thing in the\r\nworld to teach a child is that which seems to metaphysical schoolmen the\r\nabstrusest of all problems? Read all those philosophers wrangling about\r\na First Cause, deciding on what are miracles, and then again deciding\r\nthat such miracles cannot be; and when one has answered another, and\r\nleft in the crucible of wisdom a caput mortuum of ignorance, then turn\r\nyour eyes, and look at the infant praying to the invisible God at his\r\nmother’s knees. This idea, so miraculously abstract, of a Power the\r\ninfant has never seen, that cannot be symbolled forth and explained to\r\nhim by the most erudite sage,--a Power, nevertheless, that watches\r\nover him, that hears him, that sees him, that will carry him across the\r\ngrave, that will enable him to live on forever,--this double mystery\r\nof a Divinity and of a Soul, the infant learns with the most facile\r\nreadiness, at the first glimpse of his reasoning faculty. Before you can\r\nteach him a rule in addition, before you can venture to drill him into\r\nhis horn-book, he leaps, with one intuitive spring of all his ideas,\r\nto the comprehension of the truths which are only incomprehensible to\r\nblundering sages! And you, as you stand before me, dare not say, ‘Let\r\nthe child pray for me no more!’ But will the Creator accept the child’s\r\nprayer for the man who refuses prayer for himself? Take my advice, pray!\r\nAnd in this counsel I do not overstep my province. I speak not as a\r\npreacher, but as a physician. For health is a word that comprehends\r\nour whole organization, and a just equilibrium of all faculties and\r\nfunctions is the condition of health. As in your Lilian the equilibrium\r\nis deranged by the over-indulgence of a spiritual mysticism which\r\nwithdraws from the nutriment of duty the essential pabulum of sober\r\nsense, so in you the resolute negation of disciplined spiritual\r\ncommunion between Thought and Divinity robs imagination of its noblest\r\nand safest vent. Thus, from opposite extremes, you and your Lilian meet\r\nin the same region of mist and cloud, losing sight of each other and of\r\nthe true ends of life, as her eyes only gaze on the stars and yours only\r\nbend to the earth. Were I advising her, I should say: ‘Your Creator has\r\nplaced the scene of your trial below, and not in the stars.’ Advising\r\nyou, I say: ‘But in the trial below, man should recognize education for\r\nheaven.’ In a word, I would draw somewhat more downward her fancy,\r\nraise somewhat more upward your reason. Take my advice then,--Pray.\r\nYour mental system needs the support of prayer in order to preserve its\r\nbalance. In the embarrassment and confusion of your senses, clearness\r\nof perception will come with habitual and tranquil confidence in Him who\r\nalike rules the universe and reads the heart. I only say here what\r\nhas been said much better before by a reasoner in whom all Students of\r\nNature recognize a guide. I see on your table the very volume of Bacon\r\nwhich contains the passage I commend to your reflection. Here it is.\r\nListen: ‘Take an example of a dog, and mark what a generosity and\r\ncourage he will put on when he finds himself maintained by a man who, to\r\nhim, is instead of a God, or melior natura, which courage is manifestly\r\nsuch as that creature, without that confidence of a better nature\r\nthan his own, could never attain. So man, when he resteth and assureth\r\nhimself upon Divine protection and favour, gathereth a force and faith\r\nwhich human nature could not obtain.’(3) You are silent, but your\r\ngesture tells me your doubt,--a doubt which your heart, so femininely\r\ntender, will not speak aloud lest you should rob the old man of a hope\r\nwith which your strength of manhood dispenses,--you doubt the efficacy\r\nof prayer! Pause and reflect, bold but candid inquirer into the laws\r\nof that guide you call Nature. If there were no efficacy in prayer;\r\nif prayer were as mere an illusion of superstitious fantasy as aught\r\nagainst which your reason now struggles, do you think that Nature\r\nherself would have made it amongst the most common and facile of all\r\nher dictates? Do you believe that if there really did not exist that\r\ntie between Man and his Maker--that link between life here and life\r\nhereafter which is found in what we call Soul alone--that wherever you\r\nlook through the universe, you would behold a child at Prayer? Nature\r\ninculcates nothing that is superfluous. Nature does not impel the\r\nleviathan or the lion, the eagle or the moth, to pray; she impels only\r\nman. Why? Because man only has soul, and Soul seeks to commune with the\r\nEverlasting, as a fountain struggles up to its source. Burn your book.\r\nIt would found you a reputation for learning and intellect and courage,\r\nI allow; but learning and intellect and courage wasted against a truth,\r\nlike spray against a rock! A truth valuable to the world, the world will\r\nnever part with. You will not injure the truth, but you will mislead\r\nand may destroy many, whose best security is in the truth which you so\r\neruditely insinuate to be a fable. Soul and Hereafter are the heritage\r\nof all men; the humblest, journeyman in those streets, the pettiest\r\ntrader behind those counters, have in those beliefs their prerogatives\r\nof royalty. You would dethrone and embrute the lords of the earth by\r\nyour theories. For my part, having given the greater part of my life\r\nto the study and analysis of facts, I would rather be the author of the\r\ntritest homily, or the baldest poem, that inculcated that imperishable\r\nessence of the soul to which I have neither scalpel nor probe, than be\r\nthe founder of the subtlest school, or the framer of the loftiest verse,\r\nthat robbed my fellow-men of their faith in a spirit that eludes the\r\ndissecting-knife,--in a being that escapes the grave-digger. Burn your\r\nbook! Accept This Book instead; Read and Pray.”\r\n\r\nHe placed his Bible in my hand, embraced me, and, an hour afterwards,\r\nthe old man and the child left my hearth solitary once more.\r\n\r\n(1) The summary of this distinguished lecturer’s objections to\r\nphrenology is to be found in the Appendix to vol i. of “Lectures on\r\nMetaphysics,” p. 404, et seq.

Accordingly, I placed before me the very book\r\nwhich Julius Faber had advised me to burn; I forced all my powers of\r\nmind to go again over the passages which contained the doctrines that\r\nhis admonition had censured; and before daybreak, I had stated the\r\nsubstance of his argument, and the logical reply to it, in an elaborate\r\naddition to my chapter on “Sentimental Philosophers.” While thus\r\nrejecting the purport of his parting counsels, I embodied in another\r\nportion of my work his views on my own “illusions;” and as here my\r\ncommonsense was in concord with his, I disposed of all my own previous\r\ndoubts in an addition to my favourite chapter “On the Cheats of the\r\nImagination.” And when the pen dropped from my hand, and the day-star\r\ngleamed through the window, my heart escaped from the labour of my mind,\r\nand flew back to the image of Lilian. The pride of the philosopher died\r\nout of me, the sorrow of the man reigned supreme, and I shrank from the\r\ncoming of the sun, despondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nNot till the law had completed its proceedings, and satisfied the public\r\nmind as to the murder of Sir Philip Derval, were the remains of the\r\ndeceased consigned to the family mausoleum. The funeral was, as may be\r\nsupposed, strictly private, and when it was over, the excitement caused\r\nby an event so tragical and singular subsided. New topics engaged the\r\npublic talk, and--in my presence, at least--the delicate consideration\r\ndue to one whose name had been so painfully mixed up in the dismal\r\nstory forbore a topic which I could not be expected to hear without\r\ndistressful emotion. Mrs. Ashleigh I saw frequently at my own house;\r\nshe honestly confessed that Lilian had not shown that grief at the\r\ncancelling of our engagement which would alone justify Mrs. Ashleigh in\r\nasking me again to see her daughter, and retract my conclusions against\r\nour union. She said that Lilian was quiet, not uncheerful, never spoke\r\nof me nor of Margrave, but seemed absent and pre-occupied as before,\r\ntaking pleasure in nothing that had been wont to please her; not in\r\nmusic, nor books, nor that tranquil pastime which women call work, and\r\nin which they find excuse to meditate, in idleness, their own fancies.\r\nShe rarely stirred out, even in the garden; when she did, her eyes\r\nseemed to avoid the house in which Margrave had lodged, and her steps\r\nthe old favourite haunt by the Monks’ Well. She would remain silent for\r\nlong hours together, but the silence did not appear melancholy. For\r\nthe rest, her health was more than usually good. Still Mrs. Ashleigh\r\npersisted in her belief that, sooner or later, Lilian would return to\r\nher former self, her former sentiments for me; and she entreated me not,\r\nas yet, to let the world know that our engagement was broken off. “For\r\nif,” she said, with good sense, “if it should prove not to be broken\r\noff, only suspended, and afterwards happily renewed, there will be two\r\nstories to tell when no story be needed. Besides, I should dread the\r\neffect on Lilian, if offensive gossips babbled to her on a matter that\r\nwould excite so much curiosity as the rupture of a union in which our\r\nneighbours have taken so general an interest.”\r\n\r\nI had no reason to refuse acquiescence in Mrs. Ashleigh’s request, but\r\nI did not share in her hopes; I felt that the fair prospects of my life\r\nwere blasted; I could never love another, never wed another; I resigned\r\nmyself to a solitary hearth, rejoiced, at least, that Margrave had not\r\nrevisited at Mrs. Ashleigh’s,--had not, indeed, reappeared in the\r\ntown. He was still staying with Strahan, who told me that his guest\r\nhad ensconced himself in Forman’s old study, and amused himself with\r\nreading--though not for long at a time--the curious old books and\r\nmanuscripts found in the library, or climbing trees like a schoolboy,\r\nand familiarizing himself with the deer and the cattle, which would\r\ngroup round him quite tame, and feed from his hand. Was this the\r\ndescription of a criminal? But if Sir Philip’s assertion were really\r\ntrue; if the criminal were man without soul; if without soul, man would\r\nhave no conscience, never be troubled by repentance, and the vague dread\r\nof a future world,--why, then, should not the criminal be gay despite\r\nhis crimes, as the white bear gambols as friskly after his meal on\r\nhuman flesh? These questions would haunt me, despite my determination to\r\naccept as the right solution of all marvels the construction put on my\r\nnarrative by Julius Faber.\r\n\r\nDays passed; I saw and heard nothing of Margrave. I began half to\r\nhope that, in the desultory and rapid changes of mood and mind which\r\ncharacterized his restless nature, he had forgotten my existence.\r\n\r\nOne morning I went out early on my rounds, when I met Straban\r\nunexpectedly.\r\n\r\n“I was in search of you,” he said, “for more than one person has told me\r\nthat you are looking ill and jaded. So you are! And the town now is hot\r\nand unhealthy. You must come to Derval Court for a week or so. You can\r\nride into town every day to see your patients. Don’t refuse. Margrave,\r\nwho is still with me, sends all kind messages, and bade me say that he\r\nentreats you to come to the house at which he also is a guest!”\r\n\r\nI started. What had the Scin-Laeca required of me, and obtained to that\r\ncondition my promise? “If you are asked to the house at which I also\r\nam a guest, you will come; you will meet and converse with me as\r\nguest speaks to guest in the house of a host!” Was this one of the\r\ncoincidences which my reason was bound to accept as coincidences, and\r\nnothing more? Tut, tut! Was I returning again to my “hallucinations”?\r\nGranting that Faber and common-sense were in the right, what was this\r\nMargrave? A man to whose friendship, acuteness, and energy I was under\r\nthe deepest obligations,--to whom I was indebted for active services\r\nthat had saved my life from a serious danger, acquitted my honour of a\r\nhorrible suspicion. “I thank you,” I said to Strahan, “I will come; not,\r\nindeed, for a week, but, at all events, for a day or two.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right; I will call for you in the carriage at six o’clock. You\r\nwill have done your day’s work by then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I will so arrange.”\r\n\r\nOn our way to Derval Court that evening, Strahan talked much about\r\nMargrave, of whom, nevertheless, he seemed to be growing weary.\r\n\r\n“His high spirits are too much for one,” said he; “and then so\r\nrestless,--so incapable of sustained quiet conversation. And, clever\r\nthough he is, he can’t help me in the least about the new house I shall\r\nbuild. He has no notion of construction. I don’t think he could build a\r\nbarn.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you did not like to demolish the old house, and would content\r\nyourself with pulling down the more ancient part of it?”\r\n\r\n“True. At first it seemed a pity to destroy so handsome a mansion; but\r\nyou see, since poor Sir Philip’s manuscript, on which he set such store,\r\nhas been too mutilated, I fear, to allow me to effect his wish with\r\nregard to it, I think I ought at least scrupulously to obey his other\r\nwhims. And, besides, I don’t know, there are odd noises about the old\r\nhouse. I don’t believe in haunted houses; still there is something\r\ndreary in strange sounds at the dead of night, even if made by rats, or\r\nwinds through decaying rafters. You, I remember at college, had a taste\r\nfor architecture, and can draw plans. I wish to follow out Sir Philip’s\r\ndesign, but on a smaller scale, and with more attention to comfort.”\r\n\r\nThus he continued to run on, satisfied to find me a silent and attentive\r\nlistener. We arrived at the mansion an hour before sunset, the westering\r\nlight shining full against the many windows cased in mouldering\r\npilasters, and making the general dilapidation of the old place yet more\r\nmournfully evident.\r\n\r\nIt was but a few minutes to the dinner-hour. I went up at once to the\r\nroom appropriated to me,--not the one I had before occupied. Strahan\r\nhad already got together a new establishment. I was glad to find in\r\nthe servant who attended me an old acquaintance. He had been in my own\r\nemploy when I first settled at L----, and left me to get married. He and\r\nhis wife were now both in Strahan’s service. He spoke warmly of his\r\nnew master and his contentment with his situation, while he unpacked my\r\ncarpet-bag and assisted me to change my dress. But the chief object of\r\nhis talk and his praise was Mr. Margrave.\r\n\r\n“Such a bright young gentleman, like the first fine day in May!”\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the drawing-room, Margrave and Strahan were both there.\r\nThe former was blithe and genial, as usual, in his welcome. At dinner,\r\nand during the whole evening till we retired severally to our own rooms,\r\nhe was the principal talker,--recounting incidents of travel, always\r\nvery loosely strung together, jesting, good-humouredly enough, at\r\nStrahan’s sudden hobby for building, then putting questions to me about\r\nmutual acquaintances, but never waiting for an answer; and every now\r\nand then, as if at random, startling us with some brilliant aphorism, or\r\nsome suggestion drawn from abstract science or unfamiliar erudition. The\r\nwhole effect was sparkling, but I could well understand that, if long\r\ncontinued, it would become oppressive. The soul has need of pauses of\r\nrepose,--intervals of escape, not only from the flesh, but even from the\r\nmind. A man of the loftiest intellect will experience times when\r\nmere intellect not only fatigues him, but amidst its most original\r\nconceptions, amidst its proudest triumphs, has a something trite and\r\ncommonplace compared with one of those vague intimations of a spiritual\r\ndestiny which are not within the ordinary domain of reason; and, gazing\r\nabstractedly into space, will leave suspended some problem of severest\r\nthought, or uncompleted some golden palace of imperial poetry, to\r\nindulge in hazy reveries, that do not differ from those of an innocent,\r\nquiet child! The soul has a long road to travel--from time through\r\neternity. It demands its halting hours of contemplation. Contemplation\r\nis serene. But with such wants of an immortal immaterial spirit,\r\nMargrave had no fellowship, no sympathy; and for myself, I need scarcely\r\nadd that the lines I have just traced I should not have written at the\r\ndate at which my narrative has now arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nI had no case that necessitated my return to L---- the following day.\r\nThe earlier hours of the forenoon I devoted to Strahan and his building\r\nplans. Margrave flitted in and out of the room fitfully as an April\r\nsunbeam, sometimes flinging himself on a sofa, and reading for a few\r\nminutes one of the volumes of the ancient mystics, in which Sir Philip’s\r\nlibrary was so rich. I remember it was a volume of Proclus. He read that\r\ncrabbed and difficult Greek with a fluency that surprised me. “I picked\r\nup the ancient Greek,” said he, “years ago, in learning the modern.”\r\n But the book soon tired him; then he would come and disturb us, archly\r\nenjoying Strahan’s peevishness at interruption; then he would throw open\r\nthe window and leap down, chanting one of his wild savage airs; and\r\nin another moment he was half hid under the drooping boughs of a broad\r\nlime-tree, amidst the antlers of deer that gathered fondly round him.\r\nIn the afternoon my host was called away to attend some visitors of\r\nimportance, and I found myself on the sward before the house, right in\r\nview of the mausoleum and alone with Margrave.\r\n\r\nI turned my eyes from that dumb House of Death wherein rested the corpse\r\nof the last lord of the soil, so strangely murdered, with a strong\r\ndesire to speak out to Margrave the doubts respecting himself that\r\ntortured me. But--setting aside the promise to the contrary, which I had\r\ngiven, or dreamed I had given, to the Luminous Shadow--to fulfil that\r\ndesire would have been impossible,--impossible to any one gazing on that\r\nradiant youthful face! I think I see him now as I saw him then: a white\r\ndoe, that even my presence could not scare away from him, clung lovingly\r\nto his side, looking up at him with her soft eyes. He stood there like\r\nthe incarnate principle of mythological sensuous life. I have before\r\napplied to him that illustration; let the repetition be pardoned.\r\nImpossible, I repeat it, to say to that creature, face to face, “Art\r\nthou the master of demoniac arts, and the instigator of secret murder?”\r\n As if from redundant happiness within himself, he was humming, or rather\r\ncooing, a strain of music, so sweet, so wildly sweet, and so unlike the\r\nmusic one hears from tutored lips in crowded rooms! I passed my hand\r\nover my forehead in bewilderment and awe.\r\n\r\n“Are there,” I said unconsciously,--“are there, indeed, such prodigies\r\nin Nature?”\r\n\r\n“Nature!” he cried, catching up the word; “talk to me of Nature! Talk of\r\nher, the wondrous blissful mother! Mother I may well call her. I am her\r\nspoiled child, her darling! But oh, to die, ever to die, ever to lose\r\nsight of Nature!--to rot senseless, whether under these turfs or within\r\nthose dead walls--”\r\n\r\nI could not resist the answer,--\r\n\r\n“Like yon murdered man! murdered, and by whom?”\r\n\r\n“By whom? I thought that was clearly proved.”\r\n\r\n“The hand was proved; what influence moved the hand?”\r\n\r\n“Tush! the poor wretch spoke of a Demon. Who can tell? Nature herself\r\nis a grand destroyer. See that pretty bird, in its beak a writhing worm!\r\nAll Nature’s children live to take life; none, indeed, so lavishly as\r\nman. What hecatombs slaughtered, not to satisfy the irresistible sting\r\nof hunger, but for the wanton ostentation of a feast, which he may\r\nscarcely taste, or for the mere sport that he finds in destroying! We\r\nspeak with dread of the beasts of prey: what beast of prey is so dire\r\na ravager as man,--so cruel and so treacherous? Look at yon flock\r\nof sheep, bred and fattened for the shambles; and this hind that I\r\ncaress,--if I were the park-keeper, and her time for my bullet had come,\r\nwould you think her life was the safer because, in my own idle whim, I\r\nhad tamed her to trust to the hand raised to slay her?”\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said I,--“a grim truth. Nature, on the surface so loving\r\nand so gentle, is full of terror in her deeps when our thought descends\r\ninto their abyss!”\r\n\r\nStrahan now joined us with a party of country visitors. “Margrave is\r\nthe man to show you the beauties of this park,” said he. “Margrave knows\r\nevery bosk and dingle, twisted old thorn-tree, or opening glade, in its\r\nintricate, undulating ground.”\r\n\r\nMargrave seemed delighted at this proposition; and as he led us through\r\nthe park, though the way was long, though the sun was fierce, no one\r\nseemed fatigued. For the pleasure he felt in pointing out detached\r\nbeauties which escaped an ordinary eye was contagious. He did not talk\r\nas talks the poet or the painter; but at some lovely effect of light\r\namongst the tremulous leaves, some sudden glimpse of a sportive rivulet\r\nbelow, he would halt, point it out to us in silence, and with a kind\r\nof childlike ecstasy in his own bright face, that seemed to reflect the\r\nlife and the bliss of the blithe summer day itself.\r\n\r\nThus seen, all my doubts in his dark secret nature faded away,--all my\r\nhorror, all my hate; it was impossible to resist the charm that breathed\r\nround him, not to feel a tender, affectionate yearning towards him as to\r\nsome fair happy child. Well might he call himself the Darling of Nature.\r\nWas he not the mysterious likeness of that awful Mother, beautiful as\r\nApollo in one aspect, direful as Typhon in another?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\n “What a strange-looking cane you have, sir!” said a little girl, who was one of the party, and who had entwined her arm round Margrave’s. “Let me look at it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Strahan, “that cane, or rather walking-staff, is worth\r\nlooking at. Margrave bought it in Egypt, and declares that it is very\r\nancient.”\r\n\r\nThis staff seemed constructed from a reed: looked at, it seemed light,\r\nin the hand it felt heavy; it was of a pale, faded yellow, wrought\r\nwith black rings at equal distances, and graven with half obliterated\r\ncharacters that seemed hieroglyphic. I remembered to have seen Margrave\r\nwith it before, but I had never noticed it with any attention until now,\r\nwhen it was passed from hand to hand. At the head of the cane there was\r\na large unpolished stone of a dark blue.\r\n\r\n“Is this a pebble or a jewel?” asked one of the party.\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you its name or nature,” said Margrave; “but it is said\r\nto cure the bite of serpents(1), and has other supposed virtues,--a\r\ntalisman, in short.”\r\n\r\nHe here placed the staff in my hands, and bade me look at it with care.\r\nThen he changed the conversation and renewed the way, leaving the\r\nstaff with me, till suddenly I forced it back on him. I could not have\r\nexplained why, but its touch, as it warmed in my clasp, seemed to send\r\nthrough my whole frame a singular thrill, and a sensation as if I no\r\nlonger felt my own weight,--as if I walked on air.\r\n\r\nOur rambles came to a close; the visitors went away; I re-entered the\r\nhouse through the sash-window of Forman’s study. Margrave threw his hat\r\nand staff on the table, and amused himself with examining minutely the\r\ntracery on the mantelpiece. Strahan and myself left him thus occupied,\r\nand, going into the adjoining library, resumed our task of examining the\r\nplans for the new house. I continued to draw outlines and sketches\r\nof various alterations, tending to simplify and contract Sir Philip’s\r\ngeneral design. Margrave soon joined us, and this time took his seat\r\npatiently beside our table, watching me use ruler and compass with\r\nunwonted attention.\r\n\r\n“I wish I could draw,” he said; “but I can do nothing useful.”\r\n\r\n“Rich men like you,” said Strahan, peevishly, “can engage others,\r\nand are better employed in rewarding good artists than in making bad\r\ndrawings themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can employ others; and--Fenwick, when you have finished with\r\nStrahan I will ask permission to employ you, though without reward; the\r\ntask I would impose will not take you a minute.”\r\n\r\nHe then threw himself back in his chair, and seemed to fall into a doze.\r\n\r\nThe dressing-bell rang; Strahan put away the plans,--indeed, they were\r\nnow pretty well finished and decided on. Margrave woke up as our host\r\nleft the room to dress, and drawing me towards another table in the\r\nroom, placed before me one of his favourite mystic books, and, pointing\r\nto an old woodcut, said,\r\n\r\n“I will ask you to copy this for me; it pretends to be a facsimile of\r\nSolomon’s famous seal. I have a whimsical desire to have a copy of it.\r\nYou observe two triangles interlaced and inserted in a circle?--the\r\npentacle, in short. Yes, just so. You need not add the astrological\r\ncharacters: they are the senseless superfluous accessories of the\r\ndreamer who wrote the book. But the pentacle itself has an intelligible\r\nmeaning; it belongs to the only universal language, the language of\r\nsymbol, in which all races that think--around, and above, and below\r\nus--can establish communion of thought. If in the external universe any\r\none constructive principle can be detected, it is the geometrical;\r\nand in every part of the world in which magic pretends to a written\r\ncharacter, I find that its hieroglyphics are geometrical figures. Is\r\nit not laughable that the most positive of all the sciences should thus\r\nlend its angles and circles to the use of--what shall I call it?--the\r\nignorance?--ay, that is the word--the ignorance of dealers in magic?”\r\n\r\nHe took up the paper, on which I had hastily described the triangles and\r\nthe circle, and left the room, chanting the serpent-charmer’s song.\r\n\r\n(1) The following description of a stone at Corfu, celebrated as an\r\nantidote to the venom of the serpent’s bite, was given to me by an\r\neminent scholar and legal functionary in that island:--\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION of THE BLUESTONE.--This stone is of an oval shape 1 2/10 in.\r\nlong, 7/10 broad, 3/10 thick, and, having been broken formerly, is now\r\nset in gold.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is bitten by a poisonous snake, the bite must be opened\r\nby a cut of a lancet or razor longways, and the stone applied within\r\ntwenty-four hours. The stone then attaches itself firmly on the wound,\r\nand when it has done its office falls off; the cure is then complete.\r\nThe stone must then be thrown into milk, whereupon it vomits the poison\r\nit has absorbed, which remains green on the top of the milk, and the\r\nstone is then again fit for use.\r\n\r\nThis stone has been from time immemorial in the family of Ventura, of\r\nCorfu, a house of Italian origin, and is notorious, so that peasants\r\nimmediately apply for its aid. Its virtue has not been impaired by the\r\nfracture. Its nature or composition is unknown.\r\n\r\nIn a case where two were stung at the same time by serpents, the stone\r\nwas applied to one, who recovered; but the other, for whom it could not\r\nbe used, died.\r\n\r\nIt never failed but once, and then it was applied after the twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nIts colour is so dark as not to be distinguished from black.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                P. M. COLQUHOUN.\r\n\r\nCorfu, 7th Nov., 1860.\r\n\r\nSir Emerson Tennent, in his popular and excellent work on Ceylon, gives\r\nan account of “snake stones” apparently similar to the one at Corfu,\r\nexcept that they are “intensely black and highly polished,” and which\r\nare applied, in much the same manner, to the wounds inflicted by the\r\ncobra-capella.\r\n\r\nQUERY.-Might it not be worth while to ascertain the chemical properties\r\nof these stones, and, if they be efficacious in the extraction of venom\r\nconveyed by a bite, might they not be as successful if applied to the\r\nbite of a mad dog as to that of a cobra-capella?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nWhen we separated for the night, which we did at eleven o’clock,\r\nMargrave said,--\r\n\r\n“Good-night and good-by. I must leave you to-morrow, Strahan, and before\r\nyour usual hour for rising. I took the liberty of requesting one of your\r\nmen to order me a chaise from L----. Pardon my seeming abruptness, but\r\nI always avoid long leave-takings, and I had fixed the date of my\r\ndeparture almost as soon as I accepted your invitation.”\r\n\r\n“I have no right to complain. The place must be dull indeed to a gay\r\nyoung fellow like you. It is dull even to me. I am meditating flight\r\nalready. Are you going back to L----?”\r\n\r\n“Not even for such things as I left at my lodgings. When I settle\r\nsomewhere and can give an address, I shall direct them to be sent to me.\r\nThere are, I hear, beautiful patches of scenery towards the north, only\r\nknown to pedestrian tourists. I am a good walker; and you know, Fenwick,\r\nthat I am also a child of Nature. Adieu to you both; and many thanks to\r\nyou, Strahan, for your hospitality.”\r\n\r\nHe left the room.\r\n\r\n“I am not sorry he is going,” said Strahan, after a pause, and with a\r\nquick breath as if of relief. “Do you not feel that he exhausts one? An\r\nexcess of oxygen, as you would say in a lecture.”\r\n\r\nI was alone in my own chamber; I felt indisposed for bed and for sleep;\r\nthe curious conversation I had held with Margrave weighed on me. In that\r\nconversation, we had indirectly touched upon the prodigies which I had\r\nnot brought myself to speak of with frank courage, and certainly nothing\r\nin Margrave’s manner had betrayed consciousness of my suspicions; on the\r\ncontrary, the open frankness with which he evinced his predilection for\r\nmystic speculation, or uttered his more unamiable sentiments, rather\r\ntended to disarm than encourage belief in gloomy secrets or sinister\r\npowers. And as he was about to quit the neighbourhood, he would not\r\nagain see Lilian, not even enter the town of L----. Was I to ascribe\r\nthis relief from his presence to the promise of the Shadow; or was I\r\nnot rather right in battling firmly against any grotesque illusion, and\r\naccepting his departure as a simple proof that my jealous fears had been\r\namongst my other chimeras, and that as he had really only visited\r\nLilian out of friendship to me, in my peril, so he might, with his\r\ncharacteristic acuteness, have guessed my jealousy, and ceased his\r\nvisits from a kindly motive delicately concealed? And might not the same\r\nmotive now have dictated the words which were intended to assure me\r\nthat L---- contained no attractions to tempt him to return to it? Thus,\r\ngradually soothed and cheered by the course to which my reflections led\r\nme, I continued to muse for hours. At length, looking at my watch, I\r\nwas surprised to find it was the second hour after midnight. I was just\r\nabout to rise from my chair to undress, and secure some hours of sleep,\r\nwhen the well-remembered cold wind passed through the room, stirring the\r\nroots of my hair; and before me stood, against the wall, the Luminous\r\nShadow.\r\n\r\n“Rise and follow me,” said the voice, sounding much nearer than it had\r\never done before.\r\n\r\nAnd at those words I rose mechanically, and like a sleepwalker.\r\n\r\n“Take up the light.”\r\n\r\nI took it. The Scin-Laeca glided along the wall towards the threshold,\r\nand motioned me to open the door. I did so. The Shadow flitted on\r\nthrough the corridor. I followed, with hushed footsteps, down a small\r\nstair into Forman’s study. In all my subsequent proceedings, about to be\r\nnarrated, the Shadow guided me, sometimes by voice, sometimes by sign.\r\nI obeyed the guidance, not only unresistingly, but without a desire to\r\nresist. I was unconscious either of curiosity or of awe,--only of a\r\ncalm and passive indifference, neither pleasurable nor painful. In this\r\nobedience, from which all will seemed extracted, I took into my hands\r\nthe staff which I had examined the day before, and which lay on the\r\ntable, just where Margrave had cast it on re-entering the house. I\r\nunclosed the shutter to the casement, lifted the sash, and, with the\r\nlight in my left hand, the staff in my right, stepped forth into the\r\ngarden. The night was still; the flame of the candle scarcely trembled\r\nin the air; the Shadow moved on before me towards the old pavilion\r\ndescribed in an earlier part of this narrative, and of which the\r\nmouldering doors stood wide open. I followed the Shadow into the\r\npavilion, up the crazy stair to the room above, with its four great\r\nblank unglazed windows, or rather arcades, north, south, east, and west.\r\nI halted on the middle of the floor: right before my eyes, through the\r\nvista made by breathless boughs, stood out from the moonlit air the\r\ndreary mausoleum. Then, at the command conveyed to me, I placed the\r\ncandle on a wooden settle, touched a spring in the handle of the staff;\r\na lid flew back, and I drew from the hollow, first a lump of some dark\r\nbituminous substance, next a smaller slender wand of polished steel, of\r\nwhich the point was tipped with a translucent material, which appeared\r\nto me like crystal. Bending down, still obedient to the direction\r\nconveyed to me, I described on the floor with the lump of bitumen (if\r\nI may so call it) the figure of the pentacle with the interlaced\r\ntriangles, in a circle nine feet in diameter, just as I had drawn it\r\nfor Margrave the evening before. The material used made the figure\r\nperceptible, in a dark colour of mingled black and red. I applied the\r\nflame of the candle to the circle, and immediately it became lambent\r\nwith a low steady splendour that rose about an inch from the floor; and\r\ngradually front this light there emanated a soft, gray, transparent mist\r\nand a faint but exquisite odour. I stood in the midst of the circle,\r\nand within the circle also, close by my side, stood the Scin-Laeca,--no\r\nlonger reflected on the wall, but apart from it, erect, rounded into\r\nmore integral and distinct form, yet impalpable, and from it there\r\nbreathed an icy air. Then lifting the wand, the broader end of which\r\nrested in the palm of my hand, the two forefingers closing lightly over\r\nit in a line parallel with the point, I directed it towards the wide\r\naperture before me, fronting the mausoleum. I repeated aloud some words\r\nwhispered to me in a language I knew not: those words I would not trace\r\non this paper, could I remember them. As they came to a close, I heard\r\na howl from the watch-dog in the yard,--a dismal, lugubrious howl.\r\nOther dogs in the distant village caught up the sound, and bayed in\r\na dirge-like chorus; and the howling went on louder and louder. Again\r\nstrange words were whispered to me, and I repeated them in mechanical\r\nsubmission; and when they, too, were ended, I felt the ground tremble\r\nbeneath me, and as my eyes looked straight forward down the vista, that,\r\nstretching from the casement, was bounded by the solitary mausoleum,\r\nvague formless shadows seemed to pass across the moonlight,--below,\r\nalong the sward, above, in the air; and then suddenly a terror, not\r\nbefore conceived, came upon me.\r\n\r\nAnd a third time words were whispered; but though I knew no more of\r\ntheir meaning than I did of those that had preceded them, I felt a\r\nrepugnance to utter them aloud. Mutely I turned towards the Scin-Laeca,\r\nand the expression of its face was menacing and terrible; my will became\r\nyet more compelled to the control imposed upon it, and my lips commenced\r\nthe formula again whispered into my ear, when I heard distinctly a voice\r\nof warning and of anguish, that murmured “Hold!” I knew the voice; it\r\nwas Lilian’s. I paused; I turned towards the quarter from which the\r\nvoice had come, and in the space afar I saw the features, the form\r\nof Lilian. Her arms were stretched towards me in supplication, her\r\ncountenance was deadly pale, and anxious with unutterable distress. The\r\nwhole image seemed in unison with the voice,--the look, the attitude,\r\nthe gesture of one who sees another in deadly peril, and cries,\r\n“Beware!”\r\n\r\nThis apparition vanished in a moment; but that moment sufficed to free\r\nmy mind from the constraint which had before enslaved it. I dashed the\r\nwand to the ground, sprang from the circle, rushed from the place. How\r\nI got into my own room I can remember not,--I know not; I have a\r\nvague reminiscence of some intervening wandering, of giant trees, of\r\nshroud-like moonlight, of the Shining Shadow and its angry aspect, of\r\nthe blind walls and the iron door of the House of the Dead, of spectral\r\nimages,--a confused and dreary phantasmagoria. But all I can recall with\r\ndistinctness is the sight of my own hueless face in the mirror in my\r\nown still room, by the light of the white moon through the window; and,\r\nsinking down, I said to myself, “This, at least, is an hallucination or\r\na dream!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nA heavy sleep came over me at daybreak, but I did not undress nor go to\r\nbed. The sun was high in the heavens when, on waking, I saw the servant\r\nwho had attended me bustling about the room.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir, I am afraid I disturbed you; but I have been\r\nthree times to see if you were not coming down, and I found you so\r\nsoundly asleep I did not like to wake you. Mr. Strahan has finished\r\nbreakfast, and gone out riding; Mr. Margrave has left,--left before six\r\no’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, he said he was going early.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; and he seemed so cross when he went. I could never have\r\nsupposed so pleasant a gentleman could put himself into such a passion!”\r\n\r\n“What was the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Why, his walking-stick could not be found; it was not in the hall. He\r\nsaid he had left it in the study; we could not find it there. At last he\r\nfound it himself in the old summerhouse, and said--I beg pardon--he said\r\nhe was sure you had taken it there: that some one, at all events, had\r\nbeen meddling with it. However, I am very glad it was found, since he\r\nseems to set such store on it.”\r\n\r\n“Did Mr. Margrave go himself into the summer-house to look for it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; no one else would have thought of such a place; no one likes\r\nto go there, even in the daytime.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, they say it is haunted since poor Sir Philip’s death; and,\r\nindeed, there are strange noises in every part of the house. I am\r\nafraid you had a bad night, sir,” continued the servant, with evident\r\ncuriosity, glancing towards the bed, which I had not pressed, and\r\ntowards the evening-dress which, while he spoke, I was rapidly changing\r\nfor that which I habitually wore in the morning. “I hope you did not\r\nfeel yourself ill?”\r\n\r\n“No! but it seems I fell asleep in my chair.”\r\n\r\n“Did you hear, sir, how the dogs howled about two o’clock in the\r\nmorning? They woke me. Very frightful!”\r\n\r\n“The moon was at her full. Dogs will bay at the moon.”\r\n\r\nI felt relieved to think that I should not find Strahan in the\r\nbreakfast-room; and hastening through the ceremony of a meal which I\r\nscarcely touched, I went out into the park unobserved, and creeping\r\nround the copses and into the neglected gardens, made my way to the\r\npavilion. I mounted the stairs; I looked on the floor of the upper room;\r\nyes, there still was the black figure of the pentacle, the circle. So,\r\nthen, it was not a dream! Till then I had doubted. Or might it not still\r\nbe so far a dream that I had walked in my sleep, and with an imagination\r\npreoccupied by my conversations with Margrave,--by the hieroglyphics\r\non the staff I had handled, by the very figure associated with\r\nsuperstitious practices which I had copied from some weird book at\r\nhis request, by all the strange impressions previously stamped on my\r\nmind,--might I not, in truth, have carried thither in sleep the staff,\r\ndescribed the circle, and all the rest been but visionary delusion?\r\nSurely, surely, so common-sense, and so Julius Faber would interpret the\r\nriddles that perplexed me! Be that as it may, my first thought was to\r\nefface the marks on the floor. I found this easier than I had ventured\r\nto hope. I rubbed the circle and the pentacle away from the boards with\r\nthe sole of my foot, leaving but an undistinguishable smudge behind. I\r\nknow not why, but I felt the more nervously anxious to remove all such\r\nevidences of my nocturnal visit to that room, because Margrave had so\r\nopenly gone thither to seek for the staff, and had so rudely named me to\r\nthe servant as having meddled with it. Might he not awake some suspicion\r\nagainst me? Suspicion, what of? I knew not, but I feared!\r\n\r\nThe healthful air of day gradually nerved my spirits and relieved my\r\nthoughts. But the place had become hateful to me. I resolved not to wait\r\nfor Strahan’s return, but to walk back to L----, and leave a message for\r\nmy host. It was sufficient excuse that I could not longer absent myself\r\nfrom my patients; accordingly I gave directions to have the few things\r\nwhich I had brought with me sent to my house by any servant who might\r\nbe going to L----, and was soon pleased to find myself outside the\r\npark-gates and on the high-road.\r\n\r\nI had not gone a mile before I met Strahan on horseback. He received\r\nmy apologies for not waiting his return to bid him farewell without\r\nobservation, and, dismounting, led his horse and walked beside me on\r\nmy road. I saw that there was something on his mind; at last he said,\r\nlooking down,--\r\n\r\n“Did you hear the dogs howl last night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes! the full moon!”\r\n\r\n“You were awake, then, at the time. Did you hear any other sound? Did\r\nyou see anything?”\r\n\r\n“What should I hear or see?”\r\n\r\nStrahan was silent for some moments; then he said, with great\r\nseriousness,--\r\n\r\n“I could not sleep when I went to bed last night; I felt feverish and\r\nrestless. Somehow or other, Margrave got into my head, mixed up in some\r\nstrange way with Sir Philip Derval. I heard the dogs howl, and at\r\nthe same time, or rather a few minutes later, I felt the whole house\r\ntremble, as a frail corner-house in London seems to tremble at night\r\nwhen a carriage is driven past it. The howling had then ceased, and\r\nceased as suddenly as it had begun. I felt a vague, superstitious alarm;\r\nI got up, and went to my window, which was unclosed (it is my habit\r\nto sleep with my windows open); the moon was very bright, and I saw, I\r\ndeclare I saw along the green alley that leads from the old part of\r\nthe house to the mausoleum--No, I will not say what I saw or believed I\r\nsaw,--you would ridicule me, and justly. But, whatever it might be, on\r\nthe earth without or in the fancy within my brain, I was so terrified,\r\nthat I rushed back to my bed, and buried my face in my pillow. I would\r\nhave come to you; but I did not dare to stir. I have been riding hard\r\nall the morning in order to recover my nerves. But I dread sleeping\r\nagain under that roof, and now that you and Margrave leave me, I shall\r\ngo this very day to London. I hope all that I have told you is no bad\r\nsign of any coming disease; blood to the head, eh?”\r\n\r\n“No; but imagination overstrained can produce wondrous effects. You do\r\nright to change the scene. Go to London at once, amuse yourself, and--”\r\n\r\n“Not return, till the old house is razed to the ground. That is my\r\nresolve. You approve? That’s well. All success to you, Fenwick. I will\r\ncanter back and get my portmanteau ready and the carriage out, in time\r\nfor the five o’clock train.”\r\n\r\nSo then he, too, had seen--what? I did not dare and I did not desire\r\nto ask him. But he, at least, was not walking in his sleep! Did we both\r\ndream, or neither?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nThere is an instance of the absorbing tyranny of every-day life which\r\nmust have struck all such of my readers as have ever experienced one of\r\nthose portents which are so at variance with every-day life, that the\r\nordinary epithet bestowed on them is “supernatural.”\r\n\r\nAnd be my readers few or many, there will be no small proportion of them\r\nto whom once, at least, in the course of their existence, a something\r\nstrange and eerie has occurred,--a something which perplexed and\r\nbaffled rational conjecture, and struck on those chords which vibrate to\r\nsuperstition. It may have been only a dream unaccountably verified,--an\r\nundefinable presentiment or forewarning; but up from such slighter and\r\nvaguer tokens of the realm of marvel, up to the portents of ghostly\r\napparitions or haunted chambers, I believe that the greater number of\r\npersons arrived at middle age, however instructed the class, however\r\ncivilized the land, however sceptical the period, to which they belong,\r\nhave either in themselves experienced, or heard recorded by intimate\r\nassociates whose veracity they accept as indisputable in all ordinary\r\ntransactions of life, phenomena which are not to be solved by the wit\r\nthat mocks them, nor, perhaps, always and entirely, to the contentment\r\nof the reason or the philosophy that explains them away. Such phenomena,\r\nI say, are infinitely more numerous than would appear from the instances\r\ncurrently quoted and dismissed with a jest; for few of those who have\r\nwitnessed them are disposed to own it, and they who only hear of them\r\nthrough others, however trustworthy, would not impugn their character\r\nfor common-sense by professing a belief to which common-sense is a\r\nmerciless persecutor. But he who reads my assertion in the quiet of his\r\nown room, will perhaps pause, ransack his memory, and find there, in\r\nsome dark corner which he excludes from “the babbling and remorseless\r\nday,” a pale recollection that proves the assertion not untrue.\r\n\r\nAnd it is, I say, an instance of the absorbing tyranny of everyday life,\r\nthat whenever some such startling incident disturbs its regular tenor of\r\nthought and occupation, that same every-day life hastens to bury in its\r\nsands the object which has troubled its surface; the more unaccountable,\r\nthe more prodigious, has been the phenomenon which has scared and\r\nastounded us, the more, with involuntary effort, the mind seeks to rid\r\nitself of an enigma which might disease the reason that tries to solve\r\nit. We go about our mundane business with renewed avidity; we feel the\r\nnecessity of proving to ourselves that we are still sober, practical\r\nmen, and refuse to be unfitted for the world which we know, by\r\nunsolicited visitations from worlds into which every glimpse is soon\r\nlost amid shadows. And it amazes us to think how soon such incidents,\r\nthough not actually forgotten, though they can be recalled--and recalled\r\ntoo vividly for health--at our will, are nevertheless thrust, as it\r\nwere, out of the mind’s sight as we cast into lumber-rooms the crutches\r\nand splints that remind us of a broken limb which has recovered its\r\nstrength and tone. It is a felicitous peculiarity in our organization,\r\nwhich all members of my profession will have noticed, how soon, when\r\na bodily pain is once passed, it becomes erased from the\r\nrecollection,--how soon and how invariably the mind refuses to linger\r\nover and recall it. No man freed an hour before from a raging toothache,\r\nthe rack of a neuralgia, seats himself in his armchair to recollect and\r\nponder upon the anguish he has undergone. It is the same with certain\r\nafflictions of the mind,--not with those that strike on our affections,\r\nor blast our fortunes, overshadowing our whole future with a sense of\r\nloss; but where a trouble or calamity has been an accident, an episode\r\nin our wonted life, where it affects ourselves alone, where it is\r\nattended with a sense of shame and humiliation, where the pain\r\nof recalling it seems idle, and if indulged would almost madden\r\nus,--agonies of that kind we do not brood over as we do over the death\r\nor falsehood of beloved friends, or the train of events by which we are\r\nreduced from wealth to penury. No one, for instance, who has escaped\r\nfrom a shipwreck, from the brink of a precipice, from the jaws of\r\na tiger, spends his days and nights in reviving his terrors past,\r\nre-imagining dangers not to occur again, or, if they do occur, from\r\nwhich the experience undergone can suggest no additional safeguards. The\r\ncurrent of our life, indeed, like that of the rivers, is most rapid in\r\nthe midmost channel, where all streams are alike comparatively slow in\r\nthe depth and along the shores in which each life, as each river, has a\r\ncharacter peculiar to itself. And hence, those who would sail with the\r\ntide of the world, as those who sail with the tide of a river, hasten\r\nto take the middle of the stream, as those who sail against the tide\r\nare found clinging to the shore. I returned to my habitual duties and\r\navocations with renewed energy; I did not suffer my thoughts to dwell on\r\nthe dreary wonders that had haunted me, from the evening I first met\r\nSir Philip Derval to the morning on which I had quitted the house of\r\nhis heir; whether realities or hallucinations, no guess of mine could\r\nunravel such marvels, and no prudence of mine guard me against their\r\nrepetition. But I had no fear that they would be repeated, any more than\r\nthe man who had gone through shipwreck, or the hairbreadth escape from\r\na fall down a glacier, fears again to be found in a similar peril.\r\nMargrave had departed, whither I knew not, and, with his departure,\r\nceased all sense of his influence. A certain calm within me, a\r\ntranquillizing feeling of relief, seemed to me like a pledge of\r\npermanent delivery.\r\n\r\nBut that which did accompany and haunt me, through all my occupations\r\nand pursuits, was the melancholy remembrance of the love I had lost in\r\nLilian. I heard from Mrs. Ashleigh, who still frequently visited\r\nme, that her daughter seemed much in the same quiet state of\r\nmind,--perfectly reconciled to our separation, seldom mentioning my\r\nname, if mentioning it, with indifference; the only thing remarkable in\r\nher state was her aversion to all society, and a kind of lethargy that\r\nwould come over her, often in the daytime. She would suddenly fall into\r\nsleep and so remain for hours, but a sleep that seemed very serene and\r\ntranquil, and from which she woke of herself. She kept much within her\r\nown room, and always retired to it when visitors were announced.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashleigh began reluctantly to relinquish the persuasion she had so\r\nlong and so obstinately maintained, that this state of feeling towards\r\nmyself--and, indeed, this general change in Lilian--was but temporary\r\nand abnormal; she began to allow that it was best to drop all thoughts\r\nof a renewed engagement,--a future union. I proposed to see Lilian in\r\nher presence and in my professional capacity; perhaps some physical\r\ncause, especially for this lethargy, might be detected and removed.\r\nMrs. Ashleigh owned to me that the idea had occurred to herself: she\r\nhad sounded Lilian upon it: but her daughter had so resolutely opposed\r\nit,--had said with so quiet a firmness “that all being over between us,\r\na visit from me would be unwelcome and painful,”--that Mrs. Ashleigh\r\nfelt that an interview thus deprecated would only confirm estrangement.\r\nOne day, in calling, she asked my advice whether it would not be better\r\nto try the effect of change of air and scene, and, in some other place,\r\nsome other medical opinion might be taken? I approved of this suggestion\r\nwith unspeakable sadness.\r\n\r\n“And,” said Mrs. Ashleigh, shedding tears, “if that experiment prove\r\nunsuccessful, I will write and let you know; and we must then consider\r\nwhat to say to the world as a reason why the marriage is broken off. I\r\ncan render this more easy by staying away. I will not return to L----\r\ntill the matter has ceased to be the topic of talk, and at a distance\r\nany excuse will be less questioned and seem more natural. But\r\nstill--still--let us hope still.”\r\n\r\n“Have you one ground for hope?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so; but you will think it very frail and fallacious.”\r\n\r\n“Name it, and let me judge.”\r\n\r\n“One night--in which you were on a visit to Derval Court--”\r\n\r\n“Ay, that night.”\r\n\r\n“Lilian woke me by a loud cry (she sleeps in the next room to me, and\r\nthe door was left open); I hastened to her bedside in alarm; she was\r\nasleep, but appeared extremely agitated and convulsed. She kept calling\r\non your name in a tone of passionate fondness, but as if in great\r\nterror. She cried, ‘Do not go, Allen--do not go--you know not what you\r\nbrave!--what you do!’ Then she rose in her bed, clasping her hands. Her\r\nface was set and rigid; I tried to awake her, but could not. After a\r\nlittle time, she breathed a deep sigh, and murmured, ‘Allen, Allen!\r\ndear love! did you not hear, did you not see me? What could thus baffle\r\nmatter and traverse space but love and soul? Can you still doubt me,\r\nAllen?--doubt that I love you now, shall love you evermore?--yonder,\r\nyonder, as here below?’ She then sank back on her pillow, weeping, and\r\nthen I woke her.”\r\n\r\n“And what did she say on waking?”\r\n\r\n“She did not remember what she had dreamed, except that she had passed\r\nthrough some great terror; but added, with a vague smile, ‘It is over,\r\nand I feel happy now.’ Then she turned round and fell asleep again, but\r\nquietly as a child, the tears dried, the smile resting.”\r\n\r\n“Go, my dear friend, go; take Lilian away from this place as soon as you\r\ncan; divert her mind with fresh scenes. I hope!--I do hope! Let me know\r\nwhere you fix yourself. I will seize a holiday,--I need one; I will\r\narrange as to my patients; I will come to the same place; she need not\r\nknow of it, but I must be by to watch, to hear your news of her. Heaven\r\nbless you for what you have said! I hope!--I do hope!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nSome days after, I received a few lines from Mrs. Ashleigh. Her\r\narrangements for departure were made. They were to start the next\r\nmorning. She had fixed on going into the north of Devonshire, and\r\nstaying some weeks either at Ilfracombe or Lynton, whichever place\r\nLilian preferred. She would write as soon as they were settled.\r\n\r\nI was up at my usual early hour the next morning. I resolved to go out\r\ntowards Mrs. Ashleigh’s house, and watch, unnoticed, where I might,\r\nperhaps, catch a glimpse of Lilian as the carriage that would convey her\r\nto the railway passed my hiding-place.\r\n\r\nI was looking impatiently at the clock; it was yet two hours before the\r\ntrain by which Mrs. Ashleigh proposed to leave. A loud ring at my bell!\r\nI opened the door. Mrs. Ashleigh rushed in, falling on my breast.\r\n\r\n“Lilian! Lilian!”\r\n\r\n“Heavens! What has happened?”\r\n\r\n“She has left! she is gone,--gone away! Oh, Allen, how?--whither? Advise\r\nme. What is to be done?”\r\n\r\n“Come in--compose yourself--tell me all,--clearly, quickly. Lilian\r\ngone,--gone away? Impossible! She must be hid somewhere in the\r\nhouse,--the garden; she, perhaps, did not like the journey. She may\r\nhave crept away to some young friend’s house. But I talk when you should\r\ntalk: tell me all.”\r\n\r\nLittle enough to tell! Lilian had seemed unusually cheerful the night\r\nbefore, and pleased at the thought of the excursion. Mother and daughter\r\nretired to rest early: Mrs. Ashleigh saw Lilian sleeping quietly before\r\nshe herself went to bed. She woke betimes in the morning, dressed\r\nherself, went into the next room to call Lilian--Lilian was not there.\r\nNo suspicion of flight occurred to her. Perhaps her daughter might be\r\nup already, and gone downstairs, remembering something she might wish\r\nto pack and take with her on the journey. Mrs. Ashleigh was confirmed\r\nin this idea when she noticed that her own room door was left open. She\r\nwent downstairs, met a maidservant in the hall, who told her, with alarm\r\nand surprise, that both the street and garden doors were found unclosed.\r\nNo one had seen Lilian. Mrs. Ashleigh now became seriously uneasy.\r\nOn remounting to her daughter’s room, she missed Lilian’s bonnet and\r\nmantle. The house and garden were both searched in vain. There could be\r\nno doubt that Lilian had gone,--must have stolen noiselessly at night\r\nthrough her mother’s room, and let herself out of the house and through\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\n“Do you think she could have received any letter, any message, any\r\nvisitor unknown to you?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot think it. Why do you ask? Oh, Allen, you do not believe there\r\nis any accomplice in this disappearance! No, you do not believe it. But\r\nmy child’s honour! What will the world think?”\r\n\r\nNot for the world cared I at that moment. I could think only of Lilian,\r\nand without one suspicion that imputed blame to her.\r\n\r\n“Be quiet, be silent; perhaps she has gone on some visit and will\r\nreturn. Meanwhile, leave inquiry to me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible that Lilian could wander far without being\r\nobserved. I soon ascertained that she had not gone away by the\r\nrailway--by any public conveyance--had hired no carriage; she must\r\ntherefore be still in the town, or have left it on foot. The greater\r\npart of the day was consumed in unsuccessful inquiries, and faint hopes\r\nthat she would return; meanwhile the news of her disappearance had\r\nspread: how could such news fail to do so?\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance of mine met me under the archway of Monks’ Gate. He\r\nwrung my hand and looked at me with great compassion.\r\n\r\n“I fear,” said he, “that we were all deceived in that young Margrave. He\r\nseemed so well conducted, in spite of his lively manners. But--”\r\n\r\n“But what?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Ashleigh was, perhaps, imprudent to admit him into her house\r\nso familiarly. He was certainly very handsome. Young ladies will be\r\nromantic.”\r\n\r\n“How dare you, sir!” I cried, choked with rage. “And without any\r\ncolouring to so calumnious a suggestion! Margrave has not been in the\r\ntown for many days. No one knows even where he is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, it is known where he is. He wrote to order the effects which\r\nhe had left here to be sent to Penrith.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“The letter arrived the day before yesterday. I happened to be calling\r\nat the house where he last lodged, when at L----, the house opposite\r\nMrs. Ashleigh’s garden. No doubt the servants in both houses gossip with\r\neach other. Miss Ashleigh could scarcely fail to hear of Mr. Margrave’s\r\naddress from her maid; and since servants will exchange gossip, they may\r\nalso convey letters. Pardon me, you know I am your friend.”\r\n\r\n“Not from the moment you breathe a word against my betrothed wife,” said\r\nI, fiercely.\r\n\r\nI wrenched myself from the clasp of the man’s hand, but his words still\r\nrang in my ears. I mounted my horse; I rode into the adjoining suburbs,\r\nthe neighbouring villages; there, however, I learned nothing, till,\r\njust at nightfall, in a hamlet about ten miles from L----, a labourer\r\ndeclared he had seen a young lady dressed as I described, who passed\r\nby him in a path through the fields a little before noon; that he was\r\nsurprised to see one so young, so well dressed, and a stranger to the\r\nneighbourhood (for he knew by sight the ladies of the few families\r\nscattered around) walking alone; that as he stepped out of the path to\r\nmake way for her, he looked hard into her face, and she did not heed\r\nhim,--seemed to gaze right before her, into space. If her expression had\r\nbeen less quiet and gentle, he should have thought, he could scarcely\r\nsay why, that she was not quite right in her mind; there was a strange\r\nunconscious stare in her eyes, as if she were walking in her sleep. Her\r\npace was very steady,--neither quick nor slow. He had watched her till\r\nshe passed out of sight, amidst a wood through which the path wound its\r\nway to a village at some distance.\r\n\r\nI followed up this clew. I arrived at the village to which my informant\r\ndirected me, but night had set in. Most of the houses were closed, so I\r\ncould glean no further information from the cottages or at the inn. But\r\nthe police superintendent of the district lived in the village, and to\r\nhim I gave instructions which I had not given, and, indeed, would have\r\nbeen disinclined to give, to the police at L----. He was intelligent\r\nand kindly; he promised to communicate at once with the different\r\npolice-stations for miles round, and with all delicacy and privacy. It\r\nwas not probable that Lilian could have wandered in one day much farther\r\nthan the place at which I then was; it was scarcely to be conceived that\r\nshe could baffle my pursuit and the practised skill of the police. I\r\nrested but a few hours, at a small public-house, and was on horseback\r\nagain at dawn. A little after sunrise I again heard of the wanderer. At\r\na lonely cottage, by a brick-kiln, in the midst of a wide common, she\r\nhad stopped the previous evening, and asked for a draught of milk. The\r\nwoman who gave it to her inquired if she had lost her way. She said\r\n“No;” and, only tarrying a few minutes, had gone across the common; and\r\nthe woman supposed she was a visitor at a gentleman’s house which was at\r\nthe farther end of the waste, for the path she took led to no town, no\r\nvillage. It occurred to me then that Lilian avoided all high-roads, all\r\nplaces, even the humblest, where men congregated together. But where\r\ncould she have passed the night? Not to fatigue the reader with the\r\nfruitless result of frequent inquiries, I will but say that at the end\r\nof the second day I had succeeded in ascertaining that I was still\r\non her track; and though I had ridden to and fro nearly double the\r\ndistance--coming back again to places I had left behind--it was at the\r\ndistance of forty miles from L---- that I last heard of her that second\r\nday. She had been sitting alone by a little brook only an hour before.\r\nI was led to the very spot by a woodman--it was at the hour of twilight\r\nwhen he beheld her; she was leaning her face on her hand, and seemed\r\nweary. He spoke to her; she did not answer, but rose and resumed her\r\nway along the banks of the streamlet. That night I put up at no inn; I\r\nfollowed the course of the brook for miles, then struck into every path\r\nthat I could conceive her to have taken,--in vain. Thus I consumed\r\nthe night on foot, tying my horse to a tree, for he was tired out, and\r\nreturning to him at sunrise. At noon, the third day, I again heard of\r\nher, and in a remote, savage part of the country. The features of the\r\nlandscape were changed; there was little foliage and little culture, but\r\nthe ground was broken into moulds and hollows, and covered with patches\r\nof heath and stunted brushwood. She had been seen by a shepherd, and\r\nhe made the same observation as the first who had guided me on her\r\ntrack,--she looked to him “like some one walking in her sleep.” An hour\r\nor two later, in a dell, amongst the furze-bushes, I chanced on a\r\nknot of ribbon. I recognized the colour Lilian habitually wore; I felt\r\ncertain that the ribbon was hers. Calculating the utmost speed I could\r\nascribe to her, she could not be far off, yet still I failed to discover\r\nher. The scene now was as solitary as a desert. I met no one on my way.\r\nAt length, a little after sunset, I found myself in view of the sea.\r\nA small town nestled below the cliffs, on which I was guiding my weary\r\nhorse. I entered the town, and while my horse was baiting went in search\r\nof the resident policeman. The information I had directed to be sent\r\nround the country had reached him; he had acted on it, but without\r\nresult. I was surprised to hear him address me by name, and looking at\r\nhim more narrowly, I recognized him for the policeman Waby. This young\r\nman had always expressed so grateful a sense of my attendance on his\r\nsister, and had, indeed, so notably evinced his gratitude in prosecuting\r\nwith Margrave the inquiries which terminated in the discovery of\r\nSir Philip Derval’s murderer, that I confided to him the name of the\r\nwanderer, of which he had not been previously informed; but which it\r\nwould be, indeed, impossible to conceal from him should the search in\r\nwhich his aid was asked prove successful,--as he knew Miss Ashleigh by\r\nsight. His face immediately became thoughtful. He paused a minute or\r\ntwo, and then said,--\r\n\r\n“I think I have it, but I do not like to say; I may pain you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Not by confidence; you pain me by concealment.”\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated still: I encouraged him, and then he spoke out\r\nfrankly.\r\n\r\n“Sir, did you never think it strange that Mr. Margrave should move from\r\nhis handsome rooms in the hotel to a somewhat uncomfortable lodging,\r\nfrom the window of which he could look down on Mrs. Ashleigh’s garden? I\r\nhave seen him at night in the balcony of that window, and when I noticed\r\nhim going so frequently into Mrs. Ashleigh’s house during your unjust\r\ndetention, I own, sir, I felt for you--”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! Mr. Margrave went to Mrs. Ashleigh’s house as my friend. He\r\nhas left L---- weeks ago. What has all this to do with--”\r\n\r\n“Patience, sir; hear me out. I was sent from L---- to this station (on\r\npromotion, sir) a fortnight since last Friday, for there has been a\r\ngood deal of crime hereabouts; it is a bad neighbourhood, and full of\r\nsmugglers. Some days ago, in watching quietly near a lonely house, of\r\nwhich the owner is a suspicious character down in my books, I saw, to my\r\namazement, Mr. Margrave come out of that house,--come out of a private\r\ndoor in it, which belongs to a part of the building not inhabited by the\r\nowner, but which used formerly, when the house was a sort of inn, to\r\nbe let to night lodgers of the humblest description. I followed him;\r\nhe went down to the seashore, walked about, singing to himself; then\r\nreturned to the house, and re-entered by the same door. I soon learned\r\nthat he lodged in the house,--had lodged there for several days. The\r\nnext morning, a fine yacht arrived at a tolerably convenient creek about\r\na mile from the house, and there anchored. Sailors came ashore, rambling\r\ndown to this town. The yacht belonged to Mr. Margrave; he had purchased\r\nit by commission in London. It is stored for a long voyage. He had\r\ndirected it to come to him in this out-of-the-way place, where no\r\ngentleman’s yacht ever put in before, though the creek or bay is handy\r\nenough for such craft. Well, sir, is it not strange that a rich young\r\ngentleman should come to this unfrequented seashore, put up with\r\naccommodation that must be of the rudest kind, in the house of a man\r\nknown as a desperate smuggler, suspected to be worse; order a yacht to\r\nmeet him here; is not all this strange? But would it be strange if he\r\nwere waiting for a young lady? And if a young lady has fled at night\r\nfrom her home, and has come secretly along bypaths, which must have\r\nbeen very fully explained to her beforehand, and is now near that young\r\ngentleman’s lodging, if not actually in it--if this be so, why, the\r\naffair is not so very strange after all. And now do you forgive me,\r\nsir?”\r\n\r\n“Where is this house? Lead me to it.”\r\n\r\n“You can hardly get to it except on foot; rough walking, sir, and about\r\nseven miles off by the shortest cut.”\r\n\r\n“Come, and at once; come quickly. We must be there before--before--”\r\n\r\n“Before the young lady can get to the place. Well, from what you say\r\nof the spot in which she was last seen, I think, on reflection, we may\r\neasily do that. I am at your service, sir. But I should warn you\r\nthat the owners of the house, man and wife, are both of villanous\r\ncharacter,--would do anything for money. Mr. Margrave, no doubt,\r\nhas money enough; and if the young lady chooses to go away with Mr.\r\nMargrave, you know I have no power to help it.”\r\n\r\n“Leave all that to me; all I ask of you is to show me the house.”\r\n\r\nWe were soon out of the town; the night had closed in; it was very dark,\r\nin spite of a few stars; the path was rugged and precipitous, sometimes\r\nskirting the very brink of perilous cliffs, sometimes delving down to\r\nthe seashore--there stopped by rock or wave--and painfully rewinding up\r\nthe ascent.\r\n\r\n“It is an ugly path, sir, but it saves four miles; and anyhow the road\r\nis a bad one.”\r\n\r\nWe came, at last, to a few wretched fishermen’s huts. The moon had now\r\nrisen, and revealed the squalor of poverty-stricken ruinous hovels; a\r\ncouple of boats moored to the shore, a moaning, fretful sea; and at a\r\ndistance a vessel, with lights on board, lying perfectly still at anchor\r\nin a sheltered curve of the bold rude shore. The policeman pointed to\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\n“The yacht, sir; the wind will be in her favour if she sails tonight.”\r\n\r\nWe quickened our pace as well as the nature of the path would permit,\r\nleft the huts behind us, and about a mile farther on came to a solitary\r\nhouse, larger than, from the policeman’s description of Margrave’s\r\nlodgement, I should have presupposed: a house that in the wilder parts\r\nof Scotland might be almost a laird’s; but even in the moonlight it\r\nlooked very dilapidated and desolate. Most of the windows were closed,\r\nsome with panes broken, stuffed with wisps of straw; there were the\r\nremains of a wall round the house; it was broken in some parts (only its\r\nfoundation left). On approaching the house I observed two doors,--one\r\non the side fronting the sea, one on the other side, facing a patch of\r\nbroken ground that might once have been a garden, and lay waste within\r\nthe enclosure of the ruined wall, encumbered with various litter; heaps\r\nof rubbish, a ruined shed, the carcass of a worn-out boat. This latter\r\ndoor stood wide open,--the other was closed. The house was still and\r\ndark, as if either deserted, or all within it retired to rest.\r\n\r\n“I think that open door leads at once to the rooms Mr. Margrave hires;\r\nhe can go in and out without disturbing the other inmates. They used to\r\nkeep, on the side which they inhabit, a beer-house, but the magistrates\r\nshut it up; still, it is a resort for bad characters. Now, sir, what\r\nshall we do?\r\n\r\n“Watch separately. You wait within the enclosure of the wall, hid by\r\nthose heaps of rubbish, near the door; none can enter but what you will\r\nobserve them. If you see her, you will accost and stop her, and call\r\naloud for me; I shall be in hearing. I will go back to the high part\r\nof the ground yonder--it seems to me that she must pass that way; and\r\nI would desire, if possible, to save her from the humiliation, the--the\r\nshame of coming within the precincts of that man’s abode. I feel I may\r\ntrust you now and hereafter. It is a great thing for the happiness and\r\nhonour of this poor young lady and her mother, that I may be able to\r\ndeclare that I did not take her from that man, from any man--from that\r\nhouse, from any house. You comprehend me, and will obey? I speak to you\r\nas a confidant,--a friend.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you with my whole heart, sir, for so doing. You saved my\r\nsister’s life, and the least I can do is to keep secret all that would\r\npain your life if blabbed abroad. I know what mischief folks’ tongues\r\ncan make. I will wait by the door, never fear, and will rather lose my\r\nplace than not strain all the legal power I possess to keep the young\r\nlady back from sorrow.”\r\n\r\nThis dialogue was interchanged in close hurried whisper behind the\r\nbroken wall, and out of all hearing. Waby now crept through a wide gap\r\ninto the inclosure, and nestled himself silently amidst the wrecks of\r\nthe broken boat, not six feet from the open door, and close to the wall\r\nof the house itself. I went back some thirty yards up the road, to the\r\nrising ground which I had pointed out to him. According to the best\r\ncalculation I could make--considering the pace at which I had cleared\r\nthe precipitous pathway, and reckoning from the place and time at which\r\nLilian had been last seen-she could not possibly have yet entered that\r\nhouse. I might presume it would be more than half an hour before she\r\ncould arrive; I was in hopes that, during the interval, Margrave might\r\nshow himself, perhaps at the door, or from the windows, or I might even\r\nby some light from the latter be guided to the room in which to find\r\nhim. If, after waiting a reasonable time, Lilian should fail to appear,\r\nI had formed my plan of action; but it was important for the success of\r\nthat plan that I should not lose myself in the strange house, nor bring\r\nits owners to Margrave’s aid,--that I should surprise him alone and\r\nunawares. Half an hour, three quarters, a whole hour thus passed. No\r\nsign of my poor wanderer; but signs there were of the enemy from whom\r\nI resolved, at whatever risk, to free and to save her. A window on the\r\nground-floor, to the left of the door, which had long fixed my attention\r\nbecause I had seen light through the chinks of the shutters, slowly\r\nunclosed, the shutters fell back, the casement opened, and I beheld\r\nMargrave distinctly; he held something in his hand that gleamed in the\r\nmoonlight, directed not towards the mound on which I stood, nor towards\r\nthe path I had taken, but towards an open space beyond the ruined wall\r\nto the right. Hid by a cluster of stunted shrubs I watched him with a\r\nheart that beat with rage, not with terror. He seemed so intent in his\r\nown gaze as to be unheeding or unconscious of all else. I stole from my\r\npost, and, still under cover, sometimes of the broken wall, sometimes of\r\nthe shaggy ridges that skirted the path, crept on, on till I reached the\r\nside of the house itself; then, there secure from his eyes, should he\r\nturn them, I stepped over the ruined wall, scarcely two feet high in\r\nthat place, on--on towards the door. I passed the spot on which the\r\npoliceman had shrouded himself; he was seated, his back against the ribs\r\nof the broken boat. I put my hand to his mouth that he might not cry out\r\nin surprise, and whispered in his ear; he stirred not. I shook him by\r\nthe arm: still he stirred not. A ray of the moon fell on his face. I\r\nsaw that he was in a profound slumber. Persuaded that it was no natural\r\nsleep, and that he had become useless to me, I passed him by. I was\r\nat the threshold of the open door, the light from the window close by\r\nfalling on the ground; I was in the passage; a glimmer came through the\r\nchinks of a door to the left; I turned the handle noiselessly, and, the\r\nnext moment, Margrave was locked in my grasp.\r\n\r\n“Call out,” I hissed in his ear, “and I strangle you before any one can\r\ncome to your help.”\r\n\r\nHe did not call out; his eye, fixed on mine as he writhed round, saw,\r\nperhaps, his peril if he did. His countenance betrayed fear, but as\r\nI tightened my grasp that expression gave way to one of wrath and\r\nfierceness; and as, in turn, I felt the grip of his hand, I knew that\r\nthe struggle between us would be that of two strong men, each equally\r\nbent on the mastery of the other.\r\n\r\nI was, as I have said before, endowed with an unusual degree of physical\r\npower, disciplined in early youth by athletic exercise and contest. In\r\nheight and in muscle I had greatly the advantage over my antagonist;\r\nbut such was the nervous vigour, the elastic energy of his incomparable\r\nframe, in which sinews seemed springs of steel, that had our encounter\r\nbeen one in which my strength was less heightened by rage, I believe\r\nthat I could no more have coped with him than the bison can cope with\r\nthe boa; but I was animated by that passion which trebles for a time\r\nall our forces,--which makes even the weak man a match for the strong.\r\nI felt that if I were worsted, disabled, stricken down, Lilian might be\r\nlost in losing her sole protector; and on the other hand, Margrave had\r\nbeen taken at the disadvantage of that surprise which will half unnerve\r\nthe fiercest of the wild beasts; while as we grappled, reeling and\r\nrocking to and fro in our struggle, I soon observed that his attention\r\nwas distracted,--that his eye was turned towards an object which he\r\nhad dropped involuntarily when I first seized him. He sought to drag me\r\ntowards that object, and when near it stooped to seize. It was a bright,\r\nslender, short wand of steel. I remembered when and where I had seen it,\r\nwhether in my waking state or in vision; and as his hand stole down to\r\ntake it from the floor, I set on the wand my strong foot. I cannot tell\r\nby what rapid process of thought and association I came to the belief\r\nthat the possession of a little piece of blunted steel would decide the\r\nconflict in favor of the possessor; but the struggle now was concentred\r\non the attainment of that seemingly idle weapon. I was becoming\r\nbreathless and exhausted, while Margrave seemed every moment to gather\r\nup new force, when collecting all my strength for one final effort, I\r\nlifted him suddenly high in the air, and hurled him to the farthest end\r\nof the cramped arena to which our contest was confined. He fell, and\r\nwith a force by which most men would have been stunned; but he recovered\r\nhimself with a quick rebound, and, as he stood facing me, there was\r\nsomething grand as well as terrible in his aspect. His eyes literally\r\nflamed, as those of a tiger; his rich hair, flung back from his knitted\r\nforehead, seemed to erect itself as an angry mane; his lips, slightly\r\nparted, showed the glitter of his set teeth; his whole frame seemed\r\nlarger in the tension of the muscles, and as, gradually relaxing his\r\nfirst defying and haughty attitude, he crouched as the panther crouches\r\nfor its deadly spring, I felt as if it were a wild beast, whose rush\r\nwas coming upon me,--wild beast, but still Man, the king of the animals,\r\nfashioned forth from no mixture of humbler races by the slow revolutions\r\nof time, but his royalty stamped on his form when the earth became fit\r\nfor his coming.(1)\r\n\r\nAt that moment I snatched up the wand, directed it towards him, and\r\nadvancing with a fearless stride, cried,--\r\n\r\n“Down to my feet, miserable sorcerer!”\r\n\r\nTo my own amaze, the effect was instantaneous. My terrible antagonist\r\ndropped to the floor as a dog drops at the word of his master. The\r\nmuscles of his frowning countenance relaxed, the glare of his wrathful\r\neyes grew dull and rayless; his limbs lay prostrate and unnerved, his\r\nhead rested against the wall, his arms limp and drooping by his side.\r\nI approached him slowly and cautiously; he seemed cast into a profound\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n“You are at my mercy now!” said I.\r\n\r\nHe moved his head as in sign of deprecating submission.\r\n\r\n“You hear and understand me? Speak!”\r\n\r\nHis lips faintly muttered, “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I command you to answer truly the questions I shall address to you.”\r\n\r\n“I must, while yet sensible of the power that has passed to your hand.”\r\n\r\n“Is it by some occult magnetic property in this wand that you have\r\nexercised so demoniac an influence over a creature so pure as Lilian\r\nAshleigh?”\r\n\r\n“By that wand and by other arts which you could not comprehend.”\r\n\r\n“And for what infamous object,--her seduction, her dishonour?”\r\n\r\n“No! I sought in her the aid of a gift which would cease did she cease\r\nto be pure. At first I but cast my influence upon her that through her\r\nI might influence yourself. I needed your help to discover a secret.\r\nCircumstances steeled your mind against me. I could no longer hope that\r\nyou would voluntarily lend yourself to my will. Meanwhile, I had found\r\nin her the light of a loftier knowledge than that of your science;\r\nthrough that knowledge, duly heeded and cultivated, I hoped to divine\r\nwhat I cannot of myself discover. Therefore I deepened over her mind\r\nthe spells I command; therefore I have drawn her hither as the loadstone\r\ndraws the steel, and therefore I would have borne her with me to the\r\nshores to which I was about this night to sail. I had cast the inmates\r\nof the house and all around it into slumber, in order that none might\r\nwitness her departure; had I not done so, I should have summoned others\r\nto my aid, in spite of your threat.”\r\n\r\n“And would Lilian Ashleigh have passively accompanied you, to her own\r\nirretrievable disgrace?”\r\n\r\n“She could not have helped it; she would have been unconscious of her\r\nacts; she was, and is, in a trance; nor, had she gone with me, would\r\nshe have waked from that state while she lived; that would not have been\r\nlong.”\r\n\r\n“Wretch! and for what object of unhallowed curiosity do you exert an\r\ninfluence which withers away the life of its victim?”\r\n\r\n“Not curiosity, but the instinct of self-preservation. I count on no\r\nlife beyond the grave. I would defy the grave, and live on.”\r\n\r\n“And was it to learn, through some ghastly agencies, the secret of\r\nrenewing existence, that you lured me by the shadow of your own image on\r\nthe night when we met last?”\r\n\r\nThe voice of Margrave here became very faint as he answered me, and his\r\ncountenance began to exhibit the signs of an exhaustion almost mortal.\r\n\r\n“Be quick,” he murmured, “or I die. The fluid which emanates from that\r\nwand, in the hand of one who envenoms that fluid with his own hatred\r\nand rage, will prove fatal to my life. Lower the wand from my forehead!\r\nlow--low,--lower still!”\r\n\r\n“What was the nature of that rite in which you constrained me to share?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say. You are killing me. Enough that you were saved from a\r\ngreat danger by the apparition of the protecting image vouchsafed to\r\nyour eye; otherwise you would--you would--Oh, release me! Away! away!”\r\n\r\nThe foam gathered to his lips; his limbs became fearfully convulsed.\r\n\r\n“One question more: where is Lilian at this moment? Answer that\r\nquestion, and I depart.”\r\n\r\nHe raised his head, made a visible effort to rally his strength, and\r\ngasped out,--\r\n\r\n“Yonder. Pass through the open space up the cliff, beside a thorn-tree;\r\nyou will find her there, where she halted when the wand dropped from my\r\nhand. But--but--beware! Ha! you will serve me yet, and through her! They\r\nsaid so that night, though you heard them not. They said it!” Here his\r\nface became death-like; he pressed his hand on his heart, and shrieked\r\nout, “Away! away! or you are my murderer!”\r\n\r\nI retreated to the other end of the room, turning the wand from him, and\r\nwhen I gained the door, looked back; his convulsions had ceased, but he\r\nseemed locked in a profound swoon.\r\n\r\nI left the room,--the house,--paused by Waby; he was still sleeping.\r\n“Awake!” I said, and touched him with the wand. He started up at once,\r\nrubbed his eyes, began stammering out excuses. I checked them, and bade\r\nhim follow me. I took the way up the open ground towards which Margrave\r\nhad pointed the wand, and there, motionless, beside a gnarled fantastic\r\nthorn-tree, stood Lilian. Her arms were folded across her breast; her\r\nface, seen by the moonlight, looked so innocent and so infantine, that I\r\nneeded no other evidence to tell me how unconscious she was of the peril\r\nto which her steps had been drawn. I took her gently by the hand. “Come\r\nwith me,” I said in a whisper, and she obeyed me silently, and with a\r\nplacid smile.\r\n\r\nRough though the way, she seemed unconscious of fatigue. I placed her\r\narm in mine, but she did not lean on it. We got back to the town. I\r\nobtained there an old chaise and a pair of horses. At morning Lilian was\r\nunder her mother’s roof. About the noon of that day fever seized her;\r\nshe became rapidly worse, and, to all appearance, in imminent danger.\r\nDelirium set in; I watched beside her night and day, supported by an\r\ninward conviction of her recovery, but tortured by the sight of her\r\nsufferings. On the third day a change for the better became visible; her\r\nsleep was calm, her breathing regular.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards she woke out of danger. Her eyes fell at once on me,\r\nwith all their old ineffable tender sweetness.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Allen, beloved, have I not been very ill? But I am almost well\r\nnow. Do not weep; I shall live for you,--for your sake.” And she bent\r\nforward, drawing my hand from my streaming eyes, and kissed me with a\r\nchild’s guileless kiss on my burning forehead.\r\n\r\n(1) And yet, even if we entirely omit the consideration of the soul,\r\nthat immaterial and immortal principle which is for a time united to his\r\nbody, and view him only in his merely animal character, man is still\r\nthe most excellent of animals.--Dr. Kidd, On the Adaptation of External\r\nNature to the Physical Condition of Man (Sect. iii. p. 18).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nLilian recovered, but the strange thing was this: all memory of the\r\nweeks that had elapsed since her return from visiting her aunt was\r\ncompletely obliterated; she seemed in profound ignorance of the charge\r\non which I had been confined,--perfectly ignorant even of the existence\r\nof Margrave. She had, indeed, a very vague reminiscence of her\r\nconversation with me in the garden,--the first conversation which had\r\never been embittered by a disagreement,--but that disagreement itself\r\nshe did not recollect. Her belief was that she had been ill and\r\nlight-headed since that evening. From that evening to the hour of her\r\nwaking, conscious and revived, all was a blank. Her love for me was\r\nrestored, as if its thread had never been broken. Some such instances of\r\noblivion after bodily illness or mental shock are familiar enough to the\r\npractice of all medical men;(1) and I was therefore enabled to appease\r\nthe anxiety and wonder of Mrs. Ashleigh, by quoting various examples of\r\nloss, or suspension, of memory. We agreed that it would be necessary\r\nto break to Lilian, though very cautiously, the story of Sir Philip\r\nDerval’s murder, and the charge to which I had been subjected. She could\r\nnot fail to hear of those events from others. How shall I express her\r\nwomanly terror, her loving, sympathizing pity, on hearing the tale,\r\nwhich I softened as well as I could?\r\n\r\n“And to think that I knew nothing of this!” she cried, clasping my hand;\r\n“to think that you were in peril, and that I was not by your side!”\r\n\r\nHer mother spoke of Margrave, as a visitor,--an agreeable, lively\r\nstranger; Lilian could not even recollect his name, but she seemed\r\nshocked to think that any visitor had been admitted while I was in\r\ncircumstances so awful! Need I say that our engagement was renewed?\r\nRenewed! To her knowledge and to her heart it had never been interrupted\r\nfor a moment. But oh! the malignity of the wrong world! Oh, that strange\r\nlust of mangling reputations, which seizes on hearts the least wantonly\r\ncruel! Let two idle tongues utter a tale against some third person,\r\nwho never offended the babblers, and how the tale spreads, like fire,\r\nlighted none know how, in the herbage of an American prairie! Who shall\r\nput it out?\r\n\r\nWhat right have we to pry into the secrets of other men’s hearths? True\r\nor false, the tale that is gabbled to us, what concern of ours can it\r\nbe? I speak not of cases to which the law has been summoned, which\r\nlaw has sifted, on which law has pronounced. But how, when the law is\r\nsilent, can we assume its verdicts? How be all judges where there has\r\nbeen no witness-box, no cross-examination, no jury? Yet, every day we\r\nput on our ermine, and make ourselves judges,--judges sure to condemn,\r\nand on what evidence? That which no court of law will receive. Somebody\r\nhas said something to somebody, which somebody repeats to everybody!\r\n\r\nThe gossip of L---- had set in full current against Lilian’s fair\r\nname. No ladies had called or sent to congratulate Mrs. Ashleigh on her\r\nreturn, or to inquire after Lilian herself during her struggle between\r\nlife and death.\r\n\r\nHow I missed the Queen of the Hill at this critical moment! How I longed\r\nfor aid to crush the slander, with which I knew not how to grapple,--aid\r\nin her knowledge of the world and her ascendancy over its judgments! I\r\nhad heard from her once since her absence, briefly but kindly expressing\r\nher amazement at the ineffable stupidity which could for a moment have\r\nsubjected me to a suspicion of Sir Philip Derval’s strange murder, and\r\ncongratulating me heartily on my complete vindication from so monstrous\r\na charge. To this letter no address was given. I supposed the omission\r\nto be accidental, but on calling at her house to inquire her direction,\r\nI found that the servants did not know it.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was my joy when just at this juncture I received a note from\r\nMrs. Poyntz, stating that she had returned the night before, and would\r\nbe glad to see me.\r\n\r\nI hastened to her house. “Ah,” thought I, as I sprang lightly up the\r\nascent to the Hill, “how the tattlers will be silenced by a word from\r\nher imperial lips!” And only just as I approached her door did it strike\r\nme how difficult--nay, how impossible--to explain to her--the hard\r\npositive woman, her who had, less ostensibly but more ruthlessly than\r\nmyself, destroyed Dr. Lloyd for his belief in the comparatively rational\r\npretensions of clairvoyance--all the mystical excuses for Lilian’s\r\nflight from her home? How speak to her--or, indeed, to any one--about\r\nan occult fascination and a magic wand? No matter: surely it would be\r\nenough to say that at the time Lilian had been light-headed, under the\r\ninfluence of the fever which had afterwards nearly proved fatal, The\r\nearly friend of Anne Ashleigh would not be a severe critic on any tale\r\nthat might right the good name of Anne Ashleigh’s daughter. So assured,\r\nwith a light heart and a cheerful face, I followed the servant into the\r\ngreat lady’s pleasant but decorous presence-chamber.\r\n\r\n(1) Such instances of suspense of memory are recorded in most\r\nphysiological and in some metaphysical works. Dr. Abercrombie notices\r\nsome, more or less similar to that related in the text: “A young lady\r\nwho was present at a catastrophe in Scotland, in which many people lost\r\ntheir lives by the fall of the gallery of a church, escaped without any\r\ninjury, but with the complete loss of the recollection of any of the\r\ncircumstances; and this extended not only to the accident, but to\r\neverything that had occurred to her for a certain time before going to\r\nchurch. A lady whom I attended some years ago in a protracted illness,\r\nin which her memory became much impaired, lost the recollection of a\r\nperiod of about ten or twelve years, but spoke with perfect consistency\r\nof things as they stood before that time.” Dr. Aberercmbie adds: “As far\r\nas I have been able to trace it, the principle in such cases seems to\r\nbe, that when the memory is impaired to a certain degree, the loss of\r\nit extends backward to some event or some period by which a particularly\r\ndeep impression had been made upon the mind.”--ABERCROMBIE: On the\r\nIntellectual Powers, pp. 118, 119 (15th edition).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz was on her favourite seat by the window, and for a wonder,\r\nnot knitting--that classic task seemed done; but she was smoothing and\r\nfolding the completed work with her white comely hand, and smiling\r\nover it, as if in complacent approval, when I entered the room. At the\r\nfire-side sat the he-colonel inspecting a newly-invented barometer;\r\nat another window, in the farthest recess of the room, stood Miss Jane\r\nPoyntz, with a young gentleman whom I had never before seen, but\r\nwho turned his eyes full upon me with a haughty look as the servant\r\nannounced my name. He was tall, well proportioned, decidedly handsome,\r\nbut with that expression of cold and concentred self-esteem in his\r\nvery attitude, as well as his countenance, which makes a man of merit\r\nunpopular, a man without merit ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe he-colonel, always punctiliously civil, rose from his seat, shook\r\nhands with me cordially, and said, “Coldish weather to-day; but we\r\nshall have rain to-morrow. Rainy seasons come in cycles. We are about to\r\ncommence a cycle of them with heavy showers.” He sighed, and returned to\r\nhis barometer.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane bowed to me graciously enough, but was evidently a little\r\nconfused,--a circumstance which might well attract my notice, for I had\r\nnever before seen that high-bred young lady deviate a hairsbreadth from\r\nthe even tenor of a manner admirable for a cheerful and courteous ease,\r\nwhich, one felt convinced, would be unaltered to those around her if an\r\nearthquake swallowed one up an inch before her feet.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman continued to eye me loftily, as the heir-apparent to\r\nsome celestial planet might eye an inferior creature from a half-formed\r\nnebula suddenly dropped upon his sublime and perfected, star.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz extended to me two fingers, and said frigidly, “Delighted to\r\nsee you again! How kind to attend so soon to my note!”\r\n\r\nMotioning me to a seat beside her, she here turned to her husband, and\r\nsaid, “Poyntz, since a cycle of rain begins tomorrow, better secure your\r\nride to-day. Take these young people with you. I want to talk with Dr.\r\nFenwick.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel carefully put away his barometer, and saying to his\r\ndaughter, “Come!” went forth. Jane followed her father; the young\r\ngentleman followed Jane.\r\n\r\nThe reception I had met chilled and disappointed me. I felt that Mrs.\r\nPoyntz was changed, and in her change the whole house seemed changed.\r\nThe very chairs looked civilly unfriendly, as if preparing to turn their\r\nbacks on me. However, I was not in the false position of an intruder; I\r\nhad been summoned; it was for Mrs. Poyntz to speak first, and I waited\r\nquietly for her to do so.\r\n\r\nShe finished the careful folding of her work, and then laid it at rest\r\nin the drawer of the table at which she sat. Having so done, she turned\r\nto me, and said,--\r\n\r\n“By the way, I ought to have introduced to you my young guest, Mr.\r\nAshleigh Sumner. You would like him. He has talents,--not showy, but\r\nsolid. He will succeed in public life.”\r\n\r\n“So that young man is Mr. Ashleigh Sumner? I do not wonder that Miss\r\nAshleigh rejected him.”\r\n\r\nI said this, for I was nettled, as well as surprised, at the coolness\r\nwith which a lady who had professed a friendship for me mentioned that\r\nfortunate young gentleman, with so complete an oblivion of all the\r\nantecedents that had once made his name painful to my ear.\r\n\r\nIn turn, my answer seemed to nettle Mrs. Poyntz.\r\n\r\n“I am not so sure that she did reject; perhaps she rather misunderstood\r\nhim; gallant compliments are not always proposals of marriage. However\r\nthat be, his spirits were not much damped by Miss Ashleigh’s disdain,\r\nnor his heart deeply smitten by her charms; for he is now very happy,\r\nvery much attached to another young lady, to whom he proposed three\r\ndays ago, at Lady Delafield’s, and not to make a mystery of what all our\r\nlittle world will know before tomorrow, that young lady is my daughter\r\nJane.”\r\n\r\n“Were I acquainted with Mr. Sumner, I should offer to him my sincere\r\ncongratulations.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz resumed, without heeding a reply more complimentary to Miss\r\nJane than to the object of her choice,--\r\n\r\n“I told you that I meant Jane to marry a rich country gentleman, and\r\nAshleigh Sumner is the very country gentleman I had then in my thoughts.\r\nHe is cleverer and more ambitious than I could have hoped; he will be a\r\nminister some day, in right of his talents, and a peer, if he wishes it,\r\nin right of his lands. So that matter is settled.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which my mind passed rapidly through links\r\nof reminiscence and reasoning, which led me to a mingled sentiment of\r\nadmiration for Mrs. Poyntz as a diplomatist and of distrust for Mrs.\r\nPoyntz as a friend. It was now clear why Mrs. Poyntz, before so little\r\ndisposed to approve my love, had urged me at once to offer my hand to\r\nLilian, in order that she might depart affianced and engaged to the\r\nhouse in which she would meet Mr. Ashleigh Sumner. Hence Mrs. Poyntz’s\r\nanxiety to obtain all the information I could afford her of the sayings\r\nand doings at Lady Haughton’s; hence, the publicity she had so suddenly\r\ngiven to my engagement; hence, when Mr. Sumner had gone away a rejected\r\nsuitor, her own departure from L----; she had seized the very moment\r\nwhen a vain and proud man, piqued by the mortification received from\r\none lady, falls the easier prey to the arts which allure his suit to\r\nanother. All was so far clear to me. And I--was my self-conceit less\r\negregious and less readily duped than that of yon glided popinjay’s!\r\nHow skilfully this woman had knitted me into her work with the noiseless\r\nturn of her white hands! and yet, forsooth, I must vaunt the superior\r\nscope of my intellect, and plumb all the fountains of Nature,--I, who\r\ncould not fathom the little pool of this female schemer’s mind!\r\n\r\nBut that was no time for resentment to her or rebuke to myself. She was\r\nnow the woman who could best protect and save from slander my innocent,\r\nbeloved Lilian. But how approach that perplexing subject?\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz approached it, and with her usual decision of purpose, which\r\nbore so deceitful a likeness to candour of mind.\r\n\r\n“But it was not to talk of my affairs that I asked you to call, Allen\r\nFenwick.” As she uttered my name, her voice softened, and her manner\r\ntook that maternal, caressing tenderness which had sometimes amused and\r\nsometimes misled me. “No, I do not forget that you asked me to be your\r\nfriend, and I take without scruple the license of friendship. What are\r\nthese stories that I have heard already about Lilian Ashleigh, to whom\r\nyou were once engaged?”\r\n\r\n“To whom I am still engaged.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible? Oh, then, of course the stories I have heard are all\r\nfalse. Very likely; no fiction in scandal ever surprises me. Poor dear\r\nLilian, then, never ran away from her mother’s house?”\r\n\r\nI smothered the angry pain which this mode of questioning caused me; I\r\nknew how important it was to Lilian to secure to her the countenance\r\nand support of this absolute autocrat; I spoke of Lilian’s long previous\r\ndistemper of mind; I accounted for it as any intelligent physician,\r\nunacquainted with all that I could not reveal, would account. Heaven\r\nforgive me for the venial falsehood, but I spoke of the terrible charge\r\nagainst myself as enough to unhinge for a time the intellect of a girl\r\nso acutely sensitive as Lilian; I sought to create that impression as to\r\nthe origin of all that might otherwise seem strange; and in this state\r\nof cerebral excitement she had wandered from home--but alone. I had\r\ntracked every step of her way; I had found and restored her to her home.\r\nA critical delirium had followed, from which she now rose, cured in\r\nhealth, unsuspicious that there could be a whisper against her name. And\r\nthen, with all the eloquence I could command, and in words as adapted as\r\nI could frame them to soften the heart of a woman, herself a mother, I\r\nimplored Mrs. Poyntz’s aid to silence all the cruelties of calumny, and\r\nextend her shield over the child of her own early friend.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to an end, I had taken, with caressing force, Mrs. Poyntz’s\r\nreluctant hands in mine. There were tears in my voice, tears in my eyes.\r\nAnd the sound of her voice in reply gave me hope, for it was unusually\r\ngentle. She was evidently moved. The hope was soon quelled.\r\n\r\n“Allen Fenwick,” she said, “you have a noble heart; I grieve to see how\r\nit abuses your reason. I cannot aid Lilian Ashleigh in the way you ask.\r\nDo not start back so indignantly. Listen to me as patiently as I have\r\nlistened to you. That when you brought back the unfortunate young\r\nwoman to her poor mother, her mind was disordered, and became yet more\r\ndangerously so, I can well believe; that she is now recovered, and\r\nthinks with shame, or refuses to think at all, of her imprudent flight,\r\nI can believe also; but I do not believe, the World cannot believe, that\r\nshe did not, knowingly and purposely, quit her mother’s roof, and in\r\nquest of that young stranger so incautiously, so unfeelingly admitted\r\nto her mother’s house during the very time you were detained on the\r\nmost awful of human accusations. Every one in the town knows that Mr.\r\nMargrave visited daily at Mrs. Ashleigh’s during that painful period;\r\nevery one in the town knows in what strange out-of-the-way place this\r\nyoung man had niched himself; and that a yacht was bought, and lying in\r\nwait there. What for? It is said that the chaise in which you brought\r\nMiss Ashleigh back to her home was hired in a village within an easy\r\nreach of Mr. Margrave’s lodging--of Mr. Margrave’s yacht. I rejoice that\r\nyou saved the poor girl from ruin; but her good name is tarnished; and\r\nif Anne Ashleigh, whom I sincerely pity, asks me my advice, I can but\r\ngive her this: ‘Leave L----, take your daughter abroad; and if she\r\nis not to marry Mr. Margrave, marry her as quietly and as quickly as\r\npossible to some foreigner.’”\r\n\r\n“Madam! madam! this, then, is your friendship to her--to me! Oh, shame\r\non you to insult thus an affianced husband! Shame on me ever to have\r\nthought you had a heart!”\r\n\r\n“A heart, man!” she exclaimed, almost fiercely, springing up, and\r\nstartling me with the change in her countenance and voice. “And little\r\nyou would have valued, and pitilessly have crushed this heart, if I had\r\nsuffered myself to show it to you! What right have you to reproach me?\r\nI felt a warm interest in your career, an unusual attraction in your\r\nconversation and society. Do you blame me for that, or should I blame\r\nmyself? Condemned to live amongst brainless puppets, my dull occupation\r\nto pull the strings that moved them, it was a new charm to my life\r\nto establish friendship and intercourse with intellect and spirit\r\nand courage. Ah! I understand that look, half incredulous, half\r\ninquisitive.”\r\n\r\n“Inquisitive, no; incredulous, yes! You desired my friendship, and how\r\ndoes your harsh judgment of my betrothed wife prove either to me or to\r\nher mother, whom you have known from your girlhood, the first duty of a\r\nfriend,--which is surely not that of leaving a friend’s side the moment\r\nthat he needs countenance in calumny, succour in trouble!”\r\n\r\n“It is a better duty to prevent the calumny and avert the trouble. Leave\r\naside Anne Ashleigh, a cipher that I can add or abstract from my sum\r\nof life as I please. What is my duty to yourself? It is plain. It is to\r\ntell you that your honour commands you to abandon all thoughts of Lilian\r\nAshleigh as your wife. Ungrateful that you are! Do you suppose it was no\r\nmortification to my pride of woman and friend, that you never approached\r\nme in confidence except to ask my good offices in promoting your\r\ncourtship to another; no shock to the quiet plans I had formed as to\r\nour familiar though harmless intimacy, to hear that you were bent on a\r\nmarriage in which my friend would be lost to me?”\r\n\r\n“Not lost! not lost! On the contrary, the regard I must suppose you had\r\nfor Lilian would have been a new link between our homes.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! Between me and that dreamy girl there could have been no\r\nsympathy, there could have grown up no regard. You would have been\r\nchained to your fireside, and--and--but no matter. I stifled my\r\ndisappointment as soon as I felt it,--stifled it, as all my life I\r\nhave stifled that which either destiny or duty--duty to myself as to\r\nothers--forbids me to indulge. Ah, do not fancy me one of the weak\r\ncriminals who can suffer a worthy liking to grow into a debasing love! I\r\nwas not in love with you, Allen Fenwick.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I was ever so presumptuous a coxcomb as to fancy it?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, more softly; “I was not so false to my household ties\r\nand to my own nature. But there are some friendships which are as\r\njealous as love. I could have cheerfully aided you in any choice which\r\nmy sense could have approved for you as wise; I should have been pleased\r\nto have found in such a wife my most intimate companion. But that silly\r\nchild!--absurd! Nevertheless, the freshness and enthusiasm of your love\r\ntouched me; you asked my aid, and I gave it. Perhaps I did believe\r\nthat when you saw more of Lilian Ashleigh you would be cured of a fancy\r\nconceived by the eye--I should have known better what dupes the wisest\r\nmen can be to the witcheries of a fair face and eighteen! When I found\r\nyour illusion obstinate, I wrenched myself away from a vain regret,\r\nturned to my own schemes and my own ambition, and smiled bitterly to\r\nthink that, in pressing you to propose so hastily to Lilian, I made your\r\nblind passion an agent in my own plans. Enough of this. I speak thus\r\nopenly and boldly to you now, because now I have not a sentiment that\r\ncan interfere with the dispassionate soundness of my counsels. I repeat,\r\nyou cannot now marry Lilian Ashleigh; I cannot take my daughter to visit\r\nher; I cannot destroy the social laws that I myself have set in my petty\r\nkingdom.”\r\n\r\n“Be it as you will. I have pleaded for her while she is still Lilian\r\nAshleigh. I plead for no one to whom I have once given my name. Before\r\nthe woman whom I have taken from the altar, I can place, as a shield\r\nsufficient, my strong breast of man. Who has so deep an interest in\r\nLilian’s purity as I have? Who is so fitted to know the exact truth\r\nof every whisper against her? Yet when I, whom you admit to have some\r\nreputation for shrewd intelligence,--I, who tracked her way,--I, who\r\nrestored her to her home,--when I, Allen Fenwick, am so assured of her\r\ninviolable innocence in thought as in deed, that I trust my honour to\r\nher keeping,--surely, surely, I confute the scandal which you yourself\r\ndo not believe, though you refuse to reject and to annul it?”\r\n\r\n“Do not deceive yourself, Allen Fenwick,” said she, still standing\r\nbeside me, her countenance now hard and stern. “Look where I stand, I am\r\nthe World! The World, not as satirists depreciate, or as optimists extol\r\nits immutable properties, its all-persuasive authority. I am the World!\r\nAnd my voice is the World’s voice when it thus warns you. Should you\r\nmake this marriage, your dignity of character and position would be\r\ngone! If you look only to lucre and professional success, possibly they\r\nmay not ultimately suffer. You have skill, which men need; their need\r\nmay still draw patients to your door and pour guineas into your purse.\r\nBut you have the pride, as well as the birth of a gentleman, and the\r\nwounds to that pride will be hourly chafed and never healed. Your strong\r\nbreast of man has no shelter to the frail name of woman. The World, in\r\nits health, will look down on your wife, though its sick may look up\r\nto you. This is not all. The World, in its gentlest mood of indulgence,\r\nwill say compassionately, ‘Poor man! how weak, and how deceived! What an\r\nunfortunate marriage!’ But the World is not often indulgent,--it looks\r\nmost to the motives most seen on the surface. And the World will more\r\nfrequently say, ‘No; much too clever a man to be duped! Miss Ashleigh\r\nhad money. A good match to the man who liked gold better than honour.’”\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet, with difficulty suppressing my rage; and,\r\nremembering it was a woman who spoke to me, “Farewell, madam,” said\r\nI, through my grinded teeth. “Were you, indeed, the Personation of The\r\nWorld, whose mean notions you mouth so calmly, I could not disdain\r\nyou more.” I turned to the door, and left her still standing erect and\r\nmenacing, the hard sneer on her resolute lip, the red glitter in her\r\nremorseless eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nIf ever my heart vowed itself to Lilian, the vow was now the most\r\ntrustful and the most sacred. I had relinquished our engagement before;\r\nbut then her affection seemed, no matter from what cause; so estranged\r\nfrom me, that though I might be miserable to lose her, I deemed that she\r\nwould be unhappy in our union. Then, too, she was the gem and darling of\r\nthe little world in which she lived; no whisper assailed her: now I knew\r\nthat she loved me; I knew that her estrangement had been involuntary;\r\nI knew that appearances wronged her, and that they never could be\r\nexplained. I was in the true position of man to woman: I was the shield,\r\nthe bulwark, the fearless confiding protector! Resign her now because\r\nthe world babbled, because my career might be impeded, because my good\r\nname might be impeached,--resign her, and, in that resignation, confirm\r\nall that was said against her! Could I do so, I should be the most\r\ncraven of gentlemen, the meanest of men!\r\n\r\nI went to Mrs. Ashleigh, and entreated her to hasten my union with her\r\ndaughter, and fix the marriage-day.\r\n\r\nI found the poor lady dejected and distressed. She was now sufficiently\r\nrelieved from the absorbing anxiety for Lilian to be aware of the change\r\non the face of that World which the woman I had just quitted personified\r\nand concentred; she had learned the cause from the bloodless lips of\r\nMiss Brabazon.\r\n\r\n“My child! my poor child!” murmured the mother. “And she so\r\nguileless,--so sensitive! Could she know what is said, it would kill\r\nher. She would never marry you, Allen,--she would never bring shame to\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\n“She never need learn the barbarous calumny. Give her to me, and at\r\nonce; patients, fortune, fame, are not found only at L----. Give her\r\nto me at once. But let me name a condition: I have a patrimonial\r\nindependence, I have amassed large savings, I have my profession and my\r\nrepute. I cannot touch her fortune--I cannot,--never can! Take it while\r\nyou live; when you die, leave it to accumulate for her children, if\r\nchildren she have; not to me; not to her--unless I am dead or ruined!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Allen, what a heart! what a heart! No, not heart, Allen,--that bird\r\nin its cage has a heart: soul--what a soul!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nHow innocent was Lilian’s virgin blush when I knelt to her, and prayed\r\nthat she would forestall the date that had been fixed for our union, and\r\nbe my bride before the breath of the autumn had withered the pomp of\r\nthe woodland and silenced the song of the birds! Meanwhile, I was so\r\nfearfully anxious that she should risk no danger of hearing, even\r\nof surmising, the cruel slander against her--should meet no cold\r\ncontemptuous looks, above all, should be safe from the barbed talk of\r\nMrs. Poyntz--that I insisted on the necessity of immediate change of air\r\nand scene. I proposed that we should all three depart, the next day, for\r\nthe banks of my own beloved and native Windermere. By that pure mountain\r\nair, Lilian’s health would be soon re-established; in the church\r\nhallowed to me by the graves of my fathers our vows should be plighted.\r\nNo calumny had ever cast a shadow over those graves. I felt as if my\r\nbride would be safer in the neighbourhood of my mother’s tomb.\r\n\r\nI carried my point: it was so arranged. Mrs. Ashleigh, however, was\r\nreluctant to leave before she had seen her dear friend, Margaret Poyntz.\r\nI had not the courage to tell her what she might expect to hear from\r\nthat dear friend, but, as delicately as I could, I informed her that I\r\nhad already seen the Queen of the Hill, and contradicted the gossip that\r\nhad reached her; but that as yet, like other absolute sovereigns, the\r\nQueen of the Hill thought it politic to go with the popular stream,\r\nreserving all check on its direction till the rush of its torrent might\r\nslacken; and that it would be infinitely wiser in Mrs. Ashleigh to\r\npostpone conversation with Mrs. Poyntz until Lilian’s return to L----\r\nas my wife. Slander by that time would have wearied itself out, and Mrs.\r\nPoyntz (assuming her friendship to Mrs. Ashleigh to be sincere) would\r\nthen be enabled to say with authority to her subjects, “Dr. Fenwick\r\nalone knows the facts of the story, and his marriage with Miss Ashleigh\r\nrefutes all the gossip to her prejudice.”\r\n\r\nI made that evening arrangements with a young and rising practitioner to\r\nsecure attendance on my patients during my absence. I passed the greater\r\npart of the night in drawing up memoranda to guide my proxy in each\r\ncase, however humble the sufferer. This task finished, I chanced, in\r\nsearching for a small microscope, the wonders of which I thought\r\nmight interest and amuse Lilian, to open a drawer in which I kept the\r\nmanuscript of my cherished Physiological Work, and, in so doing, my eye\r\nfell upon the wand which I had taken from Margrave. I had thrown it into\r\nthat drawer on my return home, after restoring Lilian to her mother’s\r\nhouse, and, in the anxiety which had subsequently preyed upon my mind,\r\nhad almost forgotten the strange possession I had as strangely acquired.\r\nThere it now lay, the instrument of agencies over the mechanism of\r\nnature which no doctrine admitted by my philosophy could accept, side by\r\nside with the presumptuous work which had analyzed the springs by which\r\nNature is moved, and decided the principles by which reason metes out,\r\nfrom the inch of its knowledge, the plan of the Infinite Unknown.\r\n\r\nI took up the wand and examined it curiously. It was evidently the work\r\nof an age far remote from our own, scored over with half-obliterated\r\ncharacters in some Eastern tongue, perhaps no longer extant. I found\r\nthat it was hollow within. A more accurate observation showed, in\r\nthe centre of this hollow, an exceedingly fine thread-like wire, the\r\nunattached end of which would slightly touch the palm when the wand was\r\ntaken into the hand. Was it possible that there might be a natural and\r\neven a simple cause for the effects which this instrument produced?\r\nCould it serve to collect, from that great focus of animal heat and\r\nnervous energy which is placed in the palm of the human hand, some such\r\nlatent fluid as that which Reichenbach calls the “odic,” and which,\r\naccording to him, “rushes through and pervades universal Nature”? After\r\nall, why not? For how many centuries lay unknown all the virtues of\r\nthe loadstone and the amber? It is but as yesterday that the forces of\r\nvapour have become to men genii more powerful than those conjured up by\r\nAladdin; that light, at a touch, springs forth from invisible air; that\r\nthought finds a messenger swifter than the wings of the fabled Afrite.\r\nAs, thus musing, my hand closed over the wand, I felt a wild thrill\r\nthrough my frame. I recoiled; I was alarmed lest (according to the plain\r\ncommon-sense theory of Julius Faber) I might be preparing my imagination\r\nto form and to credit its own illusions. Hastily I laid down the wand.\r\nBut then it occurred to me that whatever its properties, it had so\r\nserved the purposes of the dread Fascinator from whom it had been\r\ntaken, that he might probably seek to repossess himself of it; he might\r\ncontrive to enter my house in my absence; more prudent to guard in my\r\nown watchful keeping the incomprehensible instrument of incomprehensible\r\narts. I resolved, therefore, to take the wand with me, and placed it\r\nin my travelling-trunk, with such effects as I selected for use in the\r\nexcursion that was to commence with the morrow. I now lay down to rest,\r\nbut I could not sleep. The recollections of the painful interview with\r\nMrs. Poyntz became vivid and haunting. It was clear that the sentiment\r\nshe had conceived for me was that of no simple friendship,--something\r\nmore or something less, but certainly something else; and this\r\nconviction brought before me that proud hard face, disturbed by a\r\npang wrestled against but not subdued, and that clear metallic voice,\r\ntroubled by the quiver of an emotion which, perhaps, she had never\r\nanalyzed to herself. I did not need her own assurance to know that this\r\nsentiment was not to be confounded with a love which she would have\r\ndespised as a weakness and repelled as a crime; it was an inclination\r\nof the intellect, not a passion of the heart. But still it admitted a\r\njealousy little less keen than that which has love for its cause,--so\r\ntrue it is that jealousy is never absent where self-love is always\r\npresent. Certainly, it was no susceptibility of sober friendship which\r\nhad made the stern arbitress of a coterie ascribe to her interest in\r\nme her pitiless judgment of Lilian. Strangely enough, with the image of\r\nthis archetype of conventional usages and the trite social life, came\r\nthat of the mysterious Margrave, surrounded by all the attributes with\r\nwhich superstition clothes the being of the shadowy border-land that\r\nlies beyond the chart of our visual world itself. By what link were\r\ncreatures so dissimilar riveted together in the metaphysical chain of\r\nassociation? Both had entered into the record of my life when my life\r\nadmitted its own first romance of love. Through the aid of this cynical\r\nschemer I had been made known to Lilian. At her house I had heard the\r\ndark story of that Louis Grayle, with whom, in mocking spite of my\r\nreason, conjectures, which that very reason must depose itself before\r\nit could resolve into distempered fancies, identified the enigmatical\r\nMargrave. And now both she, the representative of the formal world most\r\nopposed to visionary creeds, and he, who gathered round him all the\r\nterrors which haunt the realm of fable, stood united against me,--foes\r\nwith whom the intellect I had so haughtily cultured knew not how to\r\ncope. Whatever assault I might expect from either, I was unable\r\nto assail again. Alike, then, in this, are the Slander and the\r\nPhantom,--that which appalls us most in their power over us is our\r\nimpotence against them.\r\n\r\nBut up rose the sun, chasing the shadows from the earth, and brightening\r\ninsensibly the thoughts of man. After all, Margrave had been baffled\r\nand defeated, whatever the arts he had practised and the secrets he\r\npossessed. It was, at least, doubtful whether his evil machinations\r\nwould be renewed. He had seemed so incapable of long-sustained fixity\r\nof purpose, that it was probable he was already in pursuit of some new\r\nagent or victim; and as to this commonplace and conventional spectre,\r\nthe so-called World, if it is everywhere to him whom it awes, it is\r\nnowhere to him who despises it. What was the good or bad word of a Mrs.\r\nPoyntz to me? Ay, but to Lilian? There, indeed, I trembled; but still,\r\neven in trembling, it was sweet to think that my home would be her\r\nshelter,--my choice her vindication. Ah! how unutterably tender and\r\nreverential Love becomes when it assumes the duties of the guardian, and\r\nhallows its own heart into a sanctuary of refuge for the beloved!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful lake! We two are on its grassy margin,--twilight melting\r\ninto night; the stars stealing forth, one after one. What a wonderful\r\nchange is made within us when we come from our callings amongst men,\r\nchafed, wearied, wounded; gnawed by our cares, perplexed by the doubts\r\nof our very wisdom, stung by the adder that dwells in cities,--Slander;\r\nnay, even if renowned, fatigued with the burden of the very names that\r\nwe have won! What a change is made within us when suddenly we find\r\nourselves transported into the calm solitudes of Nature,--into scenes\r\nfamiliar to our happy dreaming childhood; back, back from the dusty\r\nthoroughfares of our toil-worn manhood to the golden fountain of our\r\nyouth! Blessed is the change, even when we have no companion beside us\r\nto whom the heart can whisper its sense of relief and joy. But if the\r\none in whom all our future is garnered up be with us there, instead of\r\nthat weary World which has so magically vanished away from the eye and\r\nthe thought, then does the change make one of those rare epochs of life\r\nin which the charm is the stillness. In the pause from all by which our\r\nown turbulent struggles for happiness trouble existence, we feel with a\r\nrapt amazement how calm a thing it is to be happy. And so as the night,\r\nin deepening, brightened, Lilian and I wandered by the starry lake.\r\nConscious of no evil in ourselves, how secure we felt from evil! A\r\nfew days more--a few days more, and we two should be as one! And that\r\nthought we uttered in many forms of words, brooding over it in the long\r\nintervals of enamoured silence.\r\n\r\nAnd when we turned back to the quiet inn at which we had taken up our\r\nabode, and her mother, with her soft face, advanced to meet us, I said\r\nto Lilian,--\r\n\r\n“Would that in these scenes we could fix our home for life, away and\r\nafar from the dull town we have left behind us, with the fret of its\r\nwearying cares and the jar of its idle babble!”\r\n\r\n“And why not, Allen? Why not? But no, you would not be happy.”\r\n\r\n“Not be happy, and with you? Sceptic, by what reasoning do you arrive at\r\nthat ungracious conclusion?”\r\n\r\n“The heart loves repose and the soul contemplation, but the mind needs\r\naction. Is it not so?”\r\n\r\n“Where learned you that aphorism, out of place on such rosy lips?”\r\n\r\n“I learned it in studying you,” murmured Lilian, tenderly.\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Ashleigh joined us. For the first time I slept under the same\r\nroof as Lilian. And I forgot that the universe contained an enigma to\r\nsolve or an enemy to fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nTwenty days--the happiest my life had ever known--thus glided on. Apart\r\nfrom the charm which love bestows on the beloved, there was that in\r\nLilian’s conversation which made her a delightful companion. Whether it\r\nwas that, in this pause from the toils of my career, my mind could\r\nmore pliantly supple itself to her graceful imagination, or that her\r\nimagination was less vague and dreamy amidst those rural scenes, which\r\nrealized in their loveliness and grandeur its long-conceived ideals,\r\nthan it had been in the petty garden-ground neighboured by the stir and\r\nhubbub of the busy town,--in much that I had once slighted or contemned\r\nas the vagaries of undisciplined fancy, I now recognized the sparkle\r\nand play of an intuitive genius, lighting up many a depth obscure to\r\ninstructed thought. It is with some characters as with the subtler and\r\nmore ethereal order of poets,--to appreciate them we must suspend the\r\ncourse of artificial life; in the city we call them dreamers, on the\r\nmountain-top we find them interpreters.\r\n\r\nIn Lilian, the sympathy with Nature was not, as in Margrave, from the\r\njoyous sense of Nature’s lavish vitality; it was refined into exquisite\r\nperception of the diviner spirit by which that vitality is informed.\r\nThus, like the artist, from outward forms of beauty she drew forth the\r\ncovert types, lending to things the most familiar exquisite meanings\r\nunconceived before. For it is truly said by a wise critic of old, that\r\n“the attribute of Art is to suggest infinitely more than it expresses;”\r\n and such suggestions, passing from the artist’s innermost thought into\r\nthe mind that receives them, open on and on into the Infinite of Ideas,\r\nas a moonlit wave struck by a passing oar impels wave upon wave along\r\none track of light.\r\n\r\nSo the days glided by, and brought the eve of our bridal morn. It had\r\nbeen settled that, after the ceremony (which was to be performed by\r\nlicense in the village church, at no great distance, which adjoined my\r\npaternal home, now passed away to strangers), we should make a short\r\nexcursion into Scotland, leaving Mrs. Ashleigh to await our return at\r\nthe little inn.\r\n\r\nI had retired to my own room to answer some letters from anxious\r\npatients, and having finished these I looked into my trunk for a\r\nGuide-Book to the North, which I had brought with me. My hand came upon\r\nMargrave’s wand, and remembering that strange thrill which had passed\r\nthrough me when I last handled it, I drew it forth, resolved to examine\r\ncalmly if I could detect the cause of the sensation. It was not now\r\nthe time of night in which the imagination is most liable to credulous\r\nimpressions, nor was I now in the anxious and jaded state of mind in\r\nwhich such impressions may be the more readily conceived. The sun was\r\nslowly setting over the delicious landscape; the air cool and serene; my\r\nthoughts collected,--heart and conscience alike at peace. I took, then,\r\nthe wand, and adjusted it to the palm of the hand as I had done before.\r\nI felt the slight touch of the delicate wire within, and again the\r\nthrill! I did not this time recoil; I continued to grasp the wand, and\r\nsought deliberately to analyze my own sensations in the contact. There\r\ncame over me an increased consciousness of vital power; a certain\r\nexhilaration, elasticity, vigour, such as a strong cordial may produce\r\non a fainting man. All the forces of my frame seemed refreshed,\r\nredoubled; and as such effects on the physical system are ordinarily\r\naccompanied by correspondent effects on the mind, so I was sensible of a\r\nproud elation of spirits,--a kind of defying, superb self-glorying. All\r\nfear seemed blotted out from my thought, as a weakness impossible to\r\nthe grandeur and might which belong to Intellectual Man; I felt as if\r\nit were a royal delight to scorn Earth and its opinions, brave Hades\r\nand its spectres. Rapidly this new-born arrogance enlarged itself\r\ninto desires vague but daring. My mind reverted to the wild phenomena\r\nassociated with its memories of Margrave. I said half-aloud, “if a\r\ncreature so beneath myself in constancy of will and completion of\r\nthought can wrest from Nature favours so marvellous, what could not be\r\nwon from her by me, her patient persevering seeker? What if there be\r\nspirits around and about, invisible to the common eye, but whom we can\r\nsubmit to our control; and what if this rod be charged with some occult\r\nfluid, that runs through all creation, and can be so disciplined as to\r\nestablish communication wherever life and thought can reach to beings\r\nthat live and think? So would the mystics of old explain what perplexes\r\nme. Am I sure that the mystics of old duped them selves or their pupils?\r\nThis, then, this slight wand, light as a reed in my grasp, this, then,\r\nwas the instrument by which Margrave sent his irresistible will through\r\nair and space, and by which I smote himself, in the midst of his\r\ntiger-like wrath, into the helplessness of a sick man’s swoon! Can the\r\ninstrument at this distance still control him; if now meditating evil,\r\ndisarm and disable his purpose?” Involuntarily, as I revolved these\r\nideas, I stretched forth the wand, with a concentred energy of desire\r\nthat its influence should reach Margrave and command him. And since I\r\nknew not his whereabout, yet was vaguely aware that, according to any\r\nconceivable theory by which the wand could be supposed to carry its\r\nimagined virtues to definite goals in distant space, it should be\r\npointed in the direction of the object it was intended to affect, so I\r\nslowly moved the wand as if describing a circle; and thus, in some point\r\nof the circle--east, west, north, or south--the direction could not fail\r\nto be true. Before I had performed half the circle, the wand of itself\r\nstopped, resisting palpably the movement of my hand to impel it onward.\r\nHad it, then, found the point to which my will was guiding it, obeying\r\nmy will by some magnetic sympathy never yet comprehended by any\r\nrecognized science? I know not; but I had not held it thus fixed for\r\nmany seconds, before a cold air, well remembered, passed by me, stirring\r\nthe roots of my hair; and, reflected against the opposite wall, stood\r\nthe hateful Scin-Laeca. The Shadow was dimmer in its light than when\r\nbefore beheld, and the outline of the features was less distinct; still\r\nit was the unmistakable lemur, or image, of Margrave.\r\n\r\nAnd a voice was conveyed to my senses, saying, as from a great distance,\r\nand in weary yet angry accents,\r\n\r\n“You have summoned me? Wherefore?”\r\n\r\nI overcame the startled shudder with which, at first, I beheld the\r\nShadow and heard the Voice.\r\n\r\n“I summoned you not,” said I; “I sought but to impose upon you my will,\r\nthat you should persecute, with your ghastly influences, me and mine\r\nno more. And now, by whatever authority this wand bestows on me, I so\r\nabjure and command you!”\r\n\r\nI thought there was a sneer of disdain on the lip through which the\r\nanswer seemed to come,--\r\n\r\n“Vain and ignorant, it is but a shadow you command. My body you have\r\ncast into a sleep, and it knows not that the shadow is here; nor, when\r\nit wakes, will the brain be aware of one reminiscence of the words that\r\nyou utter or the words that you hear.”\r\n\r\n“What, then, is this shadow that simulates the body? Is it that which in\r\npopular language is called the soul?”\r\n\r\n“It is not: soul is no shadow.”\r\n\r\n“What then?”\r\n\r\n“Ask not me. Use the wand to invoke Intelligences higher than mine.”\r\n\r\n“And how?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you not. Of yourself you may learn, if you guide the wand\r\nby your own pride of will and desire; but in the hands of him who has\r\nlearned not the art, the wand has its dangers. Again I say you have\r\nsummoned me! Wherefore?”\r\n\r\n“Lying shade, I summoned thee not.”\r\n\r\n“So wouldst thou say to the demons, did they come in their terrible\r\nwrath, when the bungler, who knows not the springs that he moves, calls\r\nthem up unawares, and can neither control nor dispel. Less revengeful\r\nthan they, I leave thee unharmed, and depart.”\r\n\r\n“Stay. If, as thou sayest, no command I address to thee--to thee, who\r\nart only the image or shadow--can have effect on the body and mind of\r\nthe being whose likeness thou art, still thou canst tell me what passes\r\nnow in his brain. Does it now harbour schemes against me through the\r\nwoman I love? Answer truly.”\r\n\r\n“I reply for the sleeper, of whom I am more than a likeness, though only\r\nthe shadow. His thought speaks thus: ‘I know, Allen Fenwick, that in\r\nthee is the agent I need for achieving the end that I seek. Through the\r\nwoman thou lovest, I hope to subject thee. A grief that will harrow thy\r\nheart is at hand; when that grief shall befall, thou wilt welcome my\r\ncoming. In me alone thy hope will be placed; through me alone wilt thou\r\nseek a path out of thy sorrow. I shall ask my conditions: they will make\r\nthee my tool and my slave!’”\r\n\r\nThe shadow waned,--it was gone. I did not seek to detain it, nor, had I\r\nsought, could I have known by what process. But a new idea now possessed\r\nme. This shadow, then, that had once so appalled and controlled me,\r\nwas, by its own confession, nothing more than a shadow! It had spoken of\r\nhigher Intelligences; from them I might learn what the Shadow could\r\nnot reveal. As I still held the wand firmer and firmer in my grasp, my\r\nthoughts grew haughtier and bolder. Could the wand, then, bring those\r\nloftier beings thus darkly referred to before me? With that thought,\r\nintense and engrossing, I guided the wand towards the space, opening\r\nboundless and blue from the casement that let in the skies. The wand no\r\nlonger resisted my hand.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments I felt the floors of the room vibrate; the air was\r\ndarkened; a vaporous, hazy cloud seemed to rise from the ground without\r\nthe casement; an awe, infinitely more deep and solemn than that which\r\nthe Scin-Laeca had caused in its earliest apparition, curdled through my\r\nveins, and stilled the very beat of my heart.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I heard, without, the voice of Lilian, singing a simple,\r\nsacred song which I had learned at my mother’s knees, and taught to her\r\nthe day before: singing low, and as with a warning angel’s voice. By an\r\nirresistible impulse I dashed the wand to the ground, and bowed my head\r\nas I had bowed it when my infant mind comprehended, without an effort,\r\nmysteries more solemn than those which perplexed me now. Slowly I raised\r\nmy eyes, and looked round; the vaporous, hazy cloud had passed away, or\r\nmelted into the ambient rose-tints amidst which the sun had sunk.\r\n\r\nThen, by one of those common reactions from a period of overstrained\r\nexcitement, there succeeded to that sentiment of arrogance and daring\r\nwith which these wild, half-conscious invocations had been fostered and\r\nsustained, a profound humility, a warning fear.\r\n\r\n“What!” said I, inly, “have all those sound resolutions, which my reason\r\nfounded on the wise talk of Julius Faber, melted away in the wrack of\r\nhaggard, dissolving fancies! Is this my boasted intellect, my vaunted\r\nscience! I--I, Allen Fenwick, not only the credulous believer, but the\r\nblundering practitioner, of an evil magic! Grant what may be possible,\r\nhowever uncomprehended,--grant that in this accursed instrument of\r\nantique superstition there be some real powers--chemical, magnetic, no\r\nmatter what--by which the imagination can be aroused, inflamed, deluded,\r\nso that it shapes the things I have seen, speaks in the tones I have\r\nheard,--grant this, shall I keep ever ready, at the caprice of will, a\r\nconstant tempter to steal away my reason and fool my senses? Or if,\r\non the other hand, I force my sense to admit what all sober men must\r\nreject; if I unschool myself to believe that in what I have just\r\nexperienced there is no mental illusion; that sorcery is a fact, and a\r\ndemon world has gates which open to a key that a mortal can forge,--who\r\nbut a saint would not shrink from the practice of powers by which each\r\npassing thought of ill might find in a fiend its abettor? In either\r\ncase--in any case--while I keep this direful relic of obsolete arts, I\r\nam haunted,--cheated out of my senses, unfitted for the uses of life.\r\nIf, as my ear or my fancy informs me, grief--human grief--is about to\r\nbefall me, shall I, in the sting of impatient sorrow, have recourse to\r\nan aid which, the same voice declares, will reduce me to a tool and\r\na slave,--tool and slave to a being I dread as a foe? Out on these\r\nnightmares! and away with the thing that bewitches the brain to conceive\r\nthem!”\r\n\r\nI rose; I took up the wand, holding it so that its hollow should not\r\nrest on the palm of the hand. I stole from the house by the back way,\r\nin order to avoid Lilian, whose voice I still heard, singing low, on\r\nthe lawn in front. I came to a creek, to the bank of which a boat\r\nwas moored, undid its chain, rowed on to a deep part of the lake, and\r\ndropped the wand into its waves. It sank at once; scarcely a ripple\r\nfurrowed the surface, not a bubble arose from the deep. And, as the boat\r\nglided on, the star mirrored itself on the spot where the placid waters\r\nhad closed over the tempter to evil.\r\n\r\nLight at heart, I sprang again on the shore, and hastening to Lilian,\r\nwhere she stood on the silvered, shining sward, clasped her to my\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n“Spirit of my life!” I murmured, “no enchantments for me but thine!\r\nThine are the spells by which creation is beautified, and, in that\r\nbeauty, hallowed. What though we can see not into the measureless future\r\nfrom the verge of the moment; what though sorrow may smite us while we\r\nare dreaming of bliss, let the future not rob me of thee, and a balm\r\nwill be found for each wound! Love me ever as now, oh, my Lilian; troth\r\nto troth, side by side, till the grave!”\r\n\r\n“And beyond the grave,” answered Lilian, softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nOur vows are exchanged at the altar, the rite which made Lilian my wife\r\nis performed; we are returned from the church amongst the hills, in\r\nwhich my fathers had worshipped; the joy-bells that had pealed for my\r\nbirth had rung for my marriage. Lilian has gone to her room to prepare\r\nfor our bridal excursion; while the carriage we have hired is waiting\r\nat the door. I am detaining her mother on the lawn, seeking to cheer and\r\ncompose her spirits, painfully affected by that sense of change in the\r\nrelations of child and parent which makes itself suddenly felt by the\r\nparent’s heart on the day that secures to the child another heart on\r\nwhich to lean.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Ashleigh’s was one of those gentle womanly natures which, if\r\neasily afflicted, are easily consoled. And, already smiling through her\r\ntears, she was about to quit me and join her daughter, when one of the\r\ninn-servants came to me with some letters, which had just been delivered\r\nby the postman. As I took them from the servant, Mrs. Ashleigh asked if\r\nthere were any for her. She expected one from her housekeeper at L----,\r\nwho had been taken ill in her absence, and about whom the kind mistress\r\nfelt anxious. The servant replied that there was no letter for her, but\r\none directed to Miss Ashleigh, which he had just sent up to the young\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashleigh did not doubt that her housekeeper had written to\r\nLilian, whom she had known from the cradle and to whom she was tenderly\r\nattached, instead of to her mistress; and, saying something to me to\r\nthat effect, quickened her steps towards the house.\r\n\r\nI was glancing over my own letters, chiefly from patients, with a rapid\r\neye, when a cry of agony, a cry as if of one suddenly stricken to the\r\nheart, pierced my ear,--a cry from within the house. “Heavens! was that\r\nLilian’s voice?” The same doubt struck Mrs. Ashleigh, who had already\r\ngained the door. She rushed on, disappearing within the threshold and\r\ncalling to me to follow. I bounded forward, passed her on the stairs,\r\nwas in Lilian’s room before her.\r\n\r\nMy bride was on the floor prostrate, insensible: so still, so\r\ncolourless, that my first dreadful thought was that life had gone. In\r\nher hand was a letter, crushed as with a convulsive sudden grasp.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the colour came back to her cheek, before the breath\r\nwas perceptible on her lip. She woke, but not to health, not to sense.\r\nHours were passed in violent convulsions, in which I momentarily feared\r\nher death. To these succeeded stupor, lethargy, not benignant sleep.\r\nThat night, my bridal night, I passed as in some chamber to which I had\r\nbeen summoned to save youth from the grave. At length--at length--life\r\nwas rescued, was assured! Life came back, but the mind was gone. She\r\nknew me not, nor her mother. She spoke little and faintly; in the words\r\nshe uttered there was no reason.\r\n\r\nI pass hurriedly on; my experience here was in fault, my skill\r\nineffectual. Day followed day, and no ray came back to the darkened\r\nbrain. We bore her, by gentle stages, to London. I was sanguine of good\r\nresult from skill more consummate than mine, and more especially devoted\r\nto diseases of the mind. I summoned the first advisers. In vain! in\r\nvain!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nAnd the cause of this direful shock? Not this time could it be traced\r\nto some evil spell, some phantasmal influence. The cause was clear, and\r\nmight have produced effects as sinister on nerves of stronger fibre if\r\naccompanied by a heart as delicately sensitive, an honour as exquisitely\r\npure.\r\n\r\nThe letter found in her hand was without name; it was dated from L----,\r\nand bore the postmark of that town. It conveyed to Lilian, in the biting\r\nwords which female malice can make so sharp, the tale we had sought\r\nsedulously to guard from her ear,--her flight, the construction that\r\nscandal put upon it. It affected for my blind infatuation a contemptuous\r\npity; it asked her to pause before she brought on the name I offered\r\nto her an indelible disgrace. If she so decided, she was warned not to\r\nreturn to L----, or to prepare there for the sentence that would exclude\r\nher from the society of her own sex. I cannot repeat more, I cannot\r\nminute down all that the letter expressed or implied, to wither the\r\norange blossoms in a bride’s wreath. The heart that took in the venom\r\ncast its poison on the brain, and the mind fled before the presence of\r\na thought so deadly to all the ideas which its innocence had heretofore\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nI knew not whom to suspect of the malignity of this mean and miserable\r\noutrage, nor did I much care to know. The handwriting, though evidently\r\ndisguised, was that of a woman, and, therefore, had I discovered the\r\nauthor, my manhood would have forbidden me the idle solace of revenge.\r\nMrs. Poyntz, however resolute and pitiless her hostility when once\r\naroused, was not without a certain largeness of nature irreconcilable\r\nwith the most dastardly of all the weapons that envy or hatred can\r\nsupply to the vile. She had too lofty a self-esteem and too decorous a\r\nregard for the moral sentiment of the world that she typified, to do,\r\nor connive at, an act which degrades the gentlewoman. Putting her aside,\r\nwhat other female enemy had Lilian provoked? No matter! What other woman\r\nat L---- was worth the condescension of a conjecture?\r\n\r\nAfter listening to all that the ablest of my professional brethren\r\nin the metropolis could suggest to guide me, and trying in vain their\r\nremedies, I brought back my charge to L----. Retaining my former\r\nresidence for the visits of patients, I engaged, for the privacy of my\r\nhome, a house two miles from the town, secluded in its own grounds, and\r\nguarded by high walls.\r\n\r\nLilian’s mother removed to my mournful dwelling-place. Abbot’s House, in\r\nthe centre of that tattling coterie, had become distasteful to her, and\r\nto me it was associated with thoughts of anguish and of terror. I could\r\nnot, without a shudder, have entered its grounds,--could not, without a\r\nstab at the heart, have seen again the old fairy-land round the Monks’\r\nWell, nor the dark cedar-tree under which Lilian’s hand had been placed\r\nin mine; and a superstitious remembrance, banished while Lilian’s angel\r\nface had brightened the fatal precincts, now revived in full force. The\r\ndying man’s curse--had it not been fulfilled?\r\n\r\nA new occupant for the old house was found within a week after Mrs.\r\nAshleigh had written from London to a house-agent at L----, intimating\r\nher desire to dispose of the lease. Shortly before we had gone to\r\nWindermere, Miss Brabazon had become enriched by a liberal life-annuity\r\nbequeathed to her by her uncle, Sir Phelim. Her means thus enabled her\r\nto move from the comparatively humble lodging she had hitherto occupied\r\nto Abbot’s House; but just as she had there commenced a series of\r\nostentatious entertainments, implying an ambitious desire to dispute\r\nwith Mrs. Poyntz the sovereignty of the Hill, she was attacked by some\r\nsevere malady which appeared complicated with spinal disease, and after\r\nmy return to L---- I sometimes met her, on the spacious platform of the\r\nHill, drawn along slowly in a Bath chair, her livid face peering forth\r\nfrom piles of Indian shawls and Siberian furs, and the gaunt figure\r\nof Dr. Jones stalking by her side, taciturn and gloomy as some sincere\r\nmourner who conducts to the grave the patron on whose life he himself\r\nhad conveniently lived. It was in the dismal month of February that I\r\nreturned to L----, and I took possession of my plighted nuptial home on\r\nthe anniversary of the very day in which I had passed through the dead\r\ndumb world from the naturalist’s gloomy death-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nLilian’s wondrous gentleness of nature did not desert her in the\r\nsuspension of her reason. She was habitually calm,--very silent; when\r\nshe spoke it was rarely on earthly things, on things familiar to her\r\npast, things one could comprehend. Her thought seemed to have quitted\r\nthe earth, seeking refuge in some imaginary heaven. She spoke of\r\nwanderings with her father as if he were living still; she did not seem\r\nto understand the meaning we attach to the word “Death.” She would sit\r\nfor hours murmuring to herself: when one sought to catch the words, they\r\nseemed in converse with invisible spirits. We found it cruel to disturb\r\nher at such times, for if left unmolested, her face was serene,--more\r\nserenely beautiful than I had seen it even in our happiest hours; but\r\nwhen we called her back to the wrecks of her real life, her eye became\r\ntroubled, restless, anxious, and she would sigh--oh, so heavily! At\r\ntimes, if we did not seem to observe her, she would quietly resume her\r\nonce favourite accomplishments,--drawing, music. And in these her\r\nyoung excellence was still apparent, only the drawings were strange and\r\nfantastic: they had a resemblance to those with which the painter Blake,\r\nhimself a visionary, illustrated the Poems of the “Night Thoughts” and\r\n“The Grave,”--faces of exquisite loveliness, forms of aerial grace,\r\ncoming forth from the bells of flowers, or floating upwards amidst\r\nthe spray of fountains, their outlines melting away in fountain or in\r\nflower. So with her music: her mother could not recognize the airs she\r\nplayed, for a while so sweetly and with so ineffable a pathos, that\r\none could scarcely hear her without weeping; and then would come, as\r\nif involuntarily, an abrupt discord, and, starting, she would cease and\r\nlook around, disquieted, aghast.\r\n\r\nAnd still she did not recognize Mrs. Ashleigh nor myself as her mother,\r\nher husband; but she had by degrees learned to distinguish us both from\r\nothers. To her mother she gave no name, seemed pleased to see her, but\r\nnot sensibly to miss her when away; me she called her brother: if longer\r\nabsent than usual, me she missed. When, after the toils of the day, I\r\ncame to join her, even if she spoke not, her sweet face brightened. When\r\nshe sang, she beckoned me to come near to her, and looked at me fixedly,\r\nwith eyes ever tender, often tearful; when she drew she would pause and\r\nglance over her shoulder to see that I was watching her, and point to\r\nthe drawings with a smile of strange significance, as if they conveyed\r\nin some covert allegory messages meant for me; so, at least, I\r\ninterpreted her smile, and taught myself to say, “Yes, Lilian, I\r\nunderstand!”\r\n\r\nAnd more than once, when I had so answered, she rose, and kissed\r\nmy forehead. I thought my heart would have broken when I felt that\r\nspirit-like melancholy kiss.\r\n\r\nAnd yet how marvellously the human mind teaches itself to extract\r\nconsolations from its sorrows. The least wretched of my hours were\r\nthose that I had passed in that saddened room, seeking how to establish\r\nfragments of intercourse, invent signs, by which each might interpret\r\neach, between the intellect I had so laboriously cultured, so arrogantly\r\nvaunted, and the fancies wandering through the dark, deprived of their\r\nguide in reason. It was something even of joy to feel myself needed for\r\nher guardianship, endeared and yearned for still by some unshattered\r\ninstinct of her heart; and when, parting from her for the night, I stole\r\nthe moment in which on her soft face seemed resting least of shadow, to\r\nask, in a trembling whisper, “Lilian, are the angels watching over\r\nyou?” and she would answer “Yes,” sometimes in words, sometimes with a\r\nmysterious happy smile--then--then I went to my lonely room, comforted\r\nand thankful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nThe blow that had fallen on my hearth effectually, inevitably killed\r\nall the slander that might have troubled me in joy. Before the awe of a\r\ngreat calamity the small passions of a mean malignity slink abashed. I\r\nhad requested Mrs. Ashleigh not to mention the vile letter which Lilian\r\nhad received. I would not give a triumph to the unknown calumniator, nor\r\nwring forth her vain remorse, by the pain of acknowledging an indignity\r\nto my darling’s honour; yet, somehow or other, the true cause of\r\nLilian’s affliction had crept out,--perhaps through the talk of\r\nservants,--and the public shock was universal. By one of those instincts\r\nof justice that lie deep in human hearts, though in ordinary moments\r\noverlaid by many a worldly layer, all felt (all mothers felt especially)\r\nthat innocence alone could have been so unprepared for reproach. The\r\nexplanation I had previously given, discredited then, was now accepted\r\nwithout a question. Lilian’s present state accounted for all that ill\r\nnature had before misconstrued. Her good name was restored to its maiden\r\nwhiteness, by the fate that had severed the ties of the bride. The\r\nformal dwellers on the Hill vied with the franker, warmer-hearted\r\nhouseholds of Low Town in the nameless attentions by which sympathy and\r\nrespect are rather delicately indicated than noisily proclaimed. Could\r\nLilian have then recovered and been sensible of its repentant homage,\r\nhow reverently that petty world would have thronged around her! And, ah!\r\ncould fortune and man’s esteem have atoned for the blight of hopes that\r\nhad been planted and cherished on ground beyond their reach, ambition\r\nand pride might have been well contented with the largeness of the\r\nexchange that courted their acceptance. Patients on patients crowded on\r\nme. Sympathy with my sorrow seemed to create and endear a more trustful\r\nbelief in my skill. But the profession I had once so enthusiastically\r\nloved became to me wearisome, insipid, distasteful; the kindness heaped\r\non me gave no comfort,--it but brought before me more vividly the\r\nconviction that it came too late to avail me: it could not restore to me\r\nthe mind, the love, the life of my life, which lay dark and shattered in\r\nthe brain of my guileless Lilian. Secretly I felt a sullen resentment.\r\nI knew that to the crowd the resentment was unjust. The world itself is\r\nbut an appearance; who can blame it if appearances guide its laws? But\r\nto those who had been detached from the crowd by the professions of\r\nfriendship,--those who, when the slander was yet new, and might have\r\nbeen awed into silence had they stood by my side,--to the pressure of\r\ntheir hands, now, I had no response.\r\n\r\nAgainst Mrs. Poyntz, above all others, I bore a remembrance of\r\nunrelaxed, unmitigable indignation. Her schemes for her daughter’s\r\nmarriage had triumphed: Jane was Mrs. Ashleigh Sumner. Her mind was,\r\nperhaps, softened now that the object which had sharpened its worldly\r\nfaculties was accomplished: but in vain, on first hearing of my\r\naffliction, had this she-Machiavel owned a humane remorse, and, with all\r\nher keen comprehension of each facility that circumstances gave to\r\nher will, availed herself of the general compassion to strengthen the\r\npopular reaction in favour of Lilian’s assaulted honour; in vain had\r\nshe written to me with a gentleness of sympathy foreign to her habitual\r\ncharacteristics; in vain besought me to call on her; in vain waylaid\r\nand accosted me with a humility that almost implored forgiveness. I\r\nvouchsafed no reproach, but I could imply no pardon. I put between her\r\nand my great sorrow the impenetrable wall of my freezing silence.\r\n\r\nOne word of hers at the time that I had so pathetically besought her\r\naid, and the parrot-flock that repeated her very whisper in noisy\r\nshrillness would have been as loud to defend as it had been to defame;\r\nthat vile letter might never have been written. Whoever its writer, it\r\nsurely was one of the babblers who took their malice itself from the\r\njest or the nod of their female despot; and the writer might have\r\njustified herself in saying she did but coarsely proclaim what the\r\noracle of worldly opinion, and the early friend of Lilian’s own mother,\r\nhad authorized her to believe.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the bitterness at my heart diffused itself to the\r\ncircumference of the circle in which my life went its cheerless\r\nmechanical round. That cordial brotherhood with his patients, which is\r\nthe true physician’s happiest gift and humanest duty, forsook my\r\nbreast. The warning words of Mrs. Poyntz had come true. A patient that\r\nmonopolized my thought awaited me at my own hearth! My conscience became\r\ntroubled; I felt that my skill was lessened. I said to myself, “The\r\nphysician who, on entering the sick-room, feels, while there, something\r\nthat distracts the finest powers of his intellect from the sufferer’s\r\ncase is unfit for his calling.” A year had scarcely passed since my\r\nfatal wedding day, before I had formed a resolution to quit L---- and\r\nabandon my profession; and my resolution was confirmed, and my goal\r\ndetermined, by a letter I received from Julius Faber.\r\n\r\nI had written at length to him, not many days after the blow that had\r\nfallen on me, stating all circumstances as calmly and clearly as my\r\ngrief would allow; for I held his skill at a higher estimate than that\r\nof any living brother of my art, and I was not without hope in the\r\nefficacy of his advice. The letter I now received from him had been\r\nbegun, and continued at some length, before my communication reached\r\nhim; and this earlier portion contained animated and cheerful\r\ndescriptions of his Australian life and home, which contrasted with the\r\nsorrowful tone of the supplement written in reply to the tidings with\r\nwhich I had wrung his friendly and tender heart. In this, the latter\r\npart of his letter, he suggested that if time had wrought no material\r\nchange for the better, it might be advisable to try the effect of\r\nforeign travel. Scenes entirely new might stimulate observation, and\r\nthe observation of things external withdraw the sense from that brooding\r\nover images delusively formed within, which characterized the kind of\r\nmental alienation I had described. “Let any intellect create for itself\r\na visionary world, and all reasonings built on it are fallacious: the\r\nvisionary world vanishes in proportion as we can arouse a predominant\r\ninterest in the actual.”\r\n\r\nThis grand authority, who owed half his consummate skill as a\r\npractitioner to the scope of his knowledge as a philosopher, then\r\nproceeded to give me a hope which I had not dared of myself to form. He\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “I distinguish the case you so minutely detail from that insanity which\r\n    is reason lost; here it seems rather to be reason held in suspense.\r\n    Where there is hereditary predisposition, where there is organic\r\n    change of structure in the brain,--nay, where there is that kind of\r\n    insanity which takes the epithet of moral, whereby the whole\r\n    character becomes so transformed that the prime element of sound\r\n    understanding, conscience itself, is either erased or warped into the\r\n    sanction of what in a healthful state it would most disapprove,--it is\r\n    only charlatans who promise effectual cure.  But here I assume that\r\n    there is no hereditary taint; here I am convinced, from my own\r\n    observation, that the nobility of the organs, all fresh as yet in the\r\n    vigour of youth, would rather submit to death than to the permanent\r\n    overthrow of their equilibrium in reason; here, where you tell me the\r\n    character preserves all its moral attributes of gentleness and purity,\r\n    and but over-indulges its own early habit of estranged contemplation;\r\n    here, without deceiving you in false kindness, I give you the\r\n    guarantee of my experience when I bid you ‘hope!’  I am persuaded\r\n    that, sooner or later, the mind, thus for a time affected, will right\r\n    itself; because here, in the cause of the malady, we do but deal with\r\n    the nervous system.  And that, once righted, and the mind once\r\n    disciplined in those practical duties which conjugal life\r\n    necessitates, the malady itself will never return; never be\r\n    transmitted to the children on whom your wife’s restoration to health\r\n    may permit you to count hereafter.  If the course of travel I\r\n    recommend and the prescriptions I conjoin with that course fail you,\r\n    let me know; and though I would fain close my days in this land, I\r\n    will come to you.  I love you as my son.  I will tend your wife as my\r\n    daughter.”\r\n\r\nForeign travel! The idea smiled on me. Julius Faber’s companionship,\r\nsympathy, matchless skill! The very thought seemed as a raft to a\r\ndrowning mariner. I now read more attentively the earlier portions of\r\nhis letter. They described, in glowing colours, the wondrous country in\r\nwhich he had fixed his home; the joyous elasticity of its atmosphere;\r\nthe freshness of its primitive, pastoral life; the strangeness of its\r\nscenery, with a Flora and a Fauna which have no similitudes in the\r\nransacked quarters of the Old World. And the strong impulse seized me to\r\ntransfer to the solitudes of that blithesome and hardy Nature a spirit\r\nno longer at home in the civilized haunts of men, and household gods\r\nthat shrank from all social eyes, and would fain have found a wilderness\r\nfor the desolate hearth, on which they had ceased to be sacred if\r\nunveiled. As if to give practical excuse and reason for the idea that\r\nseized me, Julius Faber mentioned, incidentally, that the house and\r\nproperty of a wealthy speculator in his immediate neighbourhood were on\r\nsale at a price which seemed to me alluringly trivial, and, according to\r\nhis judgment, far below the value they would soon reach in the hands of\r\na more patient capitalist. He wrote at the period of the agricultural\r\npanic in the colony which preceded the discovery of its earliest\r\ngold-fields. But his geological science had convinced him that strata\r\nwithin and around the property now for sale were auriferous, and\r\nhis intelligence enabled him to predict how inevitably man would be\r\nattracted towards the gold, and how surely the gold would fertilize the\r\nsoil and enrich its owners. He described the house thus to be sold--in\r\ncase I might know of a purchaser. It had been built at a cost unusual\r\nin those early times, and by one who clung to English tastes amidst\r\nAustralian wilds, so that in this purchase a settler would escape the\r\nhardships he had then ordinarily to encounter; it was, in short, a home\r\nto which a man more luxurious than I might bear a bride with wants less\r\nsimple than those which now sufficed for my darling Lilian.\r\n\r\nThis communication dwelt on my mind through the avocations of the day\r\non which I received it, and in the evening I read all, except the\r\nsupplement, aloud to Mrs. Ashleigh in her daughter’s presence. I desired\r\nto see if Faber’s descriptions of the country and its life, which in\r\nthemselves were extremely spirited and striking, would arouse Lilian’s\r\ninterest. At first she did not seem to heed me while I read; but when\r\nI came to Faber’s loving account of little Amy, Lilian turned her eyes\r\ntowards me, and evidently listened with attention. He wrote how the\r\nchild had already become the most useful person in the simple household.\r\nHow watchful the quickness of the heart had made the service of the eye;\r\nall their associations of comfort had grown round her active, noiseless\r\nmovements; it was she who had contrived to monopolize the management,\r\nor supervision, of all that added to Home the nameless, interior charm.\r\nUnder her eyes the rude furniture of the log-house grew inviting with\r\nEnglish neatness; she took charge of the dairy; she had made the garden\r\ngay with flowers selected from the wild, and suggested the trellised\r\nwalk, already covered with hardy vine. She was their confidant in every\r\nplan of improvement, their comforter in every anxious doubt, their nurse\r\nin every passing ailment, her very smile a refreshment in the weariness\r\nof daily toil. “How all that is best in womanhood,” wrote the old man,\r\nwith the enthusiasm which no time had reft from his hearty, healthful\r\ngenius,--“how all that is best in womanhood is here opening fast into\r\nflower from the bud of the infant’s soul! The atmosphere seems to suit\r\nit,--the child-woman in the child-world!”\r\n\r\nI heard Lilian sigh; I looked towards her furtively; tears stood in her\r\nsoftened eyes; her lip was quivering. Presently, she began to rub her\r\nright hand over the left--over the wedding-ring--at first slowly; then\r\nwith quicker movement.\r\n\r\n“It is not here,” she said impatiently; “it is not here!”\r\n\r\n“What is not here?” asked Mrs. Ashleigh, hanging over her.\r\n\r\nLilian leaned back her head on her mother’s bosom, and answered\r\nfaintly,--\r\n\r\n“The stain! Some one said there was a stain on this hand. I do not see\r\nit, do you?”\r\n\r\n“There is no stain, never was,” said I; “the hand is white as your own\r\ninnocence, or the lily from which you take your name.”\r\n\r\n“Hush! you do not know my name. I will whisper it. Soft!--my name is\r\nNightshade! Do you want to know where the lily is now, brother? I will\r\ntell you. There, in that letter. You call her Amy,--she is the\r\nlily; take her to your breast, hide her. Hist! what are those bells?\r\nMarriage-bells. Do not let her hear them; for there is a cruel wind that\r\nwhispers the bells, and the bells ring out what it whispers, louder and\r\nlouder,\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘Stain on lily Shame on lily,  Wither lily.’\r\n\r\n“If she hears what the wind whispers to the bells, she will creep away\r\ninto the dark, and then she, too, will turn to Nightshade.”\r\n\r\n“Lilian, look up, awake! You have been in a long, long dream: it is\r\npassing away. Lilian, my beloved, my blessed Lilian!”\r\n\r\nNever till then had I heard from her even so vague an allusion to the\r\nfatal calumny and its dreadful effect, and while her words now pierced\r\nmy heart, it beat, amongst its pangs, with a thrilling hope.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! the idea that had gleamed upon her had vanished already. She\r\nmurmured something about Circles of Fire, and a Veiled Woman in black\r\ngarments; became restless, agitated, and unconscious of our presence,\r\nand finally sank into a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\nThat night (my room was next to hers with the intervening door open)\r\nI heard her cry out. I hastened to her side. She was still asleep, but\r\nthere was an anxious labouring expression on her young face, and yet\r\nnot an expression wholly of pain--for her lips were parted with a\r\nsmile,--that glad yet troubled smile with which one who has been\r\nrevolving some subject of perplexity or fear greets a sudden thought\r\nthat seems to solve the riddle, or prompt the escape from danger; and\r\nas I softly took her hand she returned my gentle pressure, and inclining\r\ntowards me, said, still in sleep,--\r\n\r\n“Let us go.”\r\n\r\n“Whither?” I answered, under my breath, so as not to awake her; “is it\r\nto see the child of whom I read, and the land that is blooming out of\r\nthe earth’s childhood?”\r\n\r\n“Out of the dark into the light; where the leaves do not change; where\r\nthe night is our day, and the winter our summer. Let us go! let us go!”\r\n\r\n“We will go. Dream on undisturbed, my bride. Oh, that the dream could\r\ntell you that my love has not changed in our sorrow, holier and deeper\r\nthan on the day in which our vows were exchanged! In you still all my\r\nhopes fold their wings; where you are, there still I myself have my\r\ndreamland!”\r\n\r\nThe sweet face grew bright as I spoke; all trouble left the smile;\r\nsoftly she drew her hand from my clasp, and rested it for a moment on my\r\nbended head, as if in blessing.\r\n\r\nI rose; stole back to my own room, closing the door, lest the sob I\r\ncould not stifle should mar her sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nI unfolded my new prospects to Mrs. Ashleigh. She was more easily\r\nreconciled to them than I could have supposed, judging by her habits,\r\nwhich were naturally indolent, and averse to all that disturbed their\r\neven tenor. But the great grief which had befallen her had roused up\r\nthat strength of devotion which lies dormant in all hearts that are\r\ncapable of loving another more than self. With her full consent I wrote\r\nto Faber, communicating my intentions, instructing him to purchase the\r\nproperty he had so commended, and inclosing my banker’s order for the\r\namount, on an Australian firm. I now announced my intention to retire\r\nfrom my profession; made prompt arrangements with a successor to my\r\npractice; disposed of my two houses at L----; fixed the day of my\r\ndeparture. Vanity was dead within me, or I might have been gratified by\r\nthe sensation which the news of my design created. My faults became at\r\nonce forgotten; such good qualities as I might possess were exaggerated.\r\nThe public regret vented and consoled itself in a costly testimonial,\r\nto which even the poorest of my patients insisted on the privilege to\r\ncontribute, graced with an inscription flattering enough to have served\r\nfor the epitaph on some great man’s tomb. No one who has served an art\r\nand striven for a name is a stoic to the esteem of others; and sweet\r\nindeed would such honours have been to me had not publicity itself\r\nseemed a wrong to the sanctity of that affliction which set Lilian apart\r\nfrom the movement and the glories of the world.\r\n\r\nThe two persons most active in “getting up” this testimonial were,\r\nnominally, Colonel Poyntz--in truth, his wife--and my old disparager,\r\nMr. Vigors! It is long since my narrative has referred to Mr. Vigors. It\r\nis due to him now to state that, in his capacity of magistrate, and in\r\nhis own way, he had been both active and delicate in the inquiries set\r\non foot for Lilian during the unhappy time in which she had wandered,\r\nspellbound, from her home. He, alone, of all the more influential\r\nmagnates of the town, had upheld her innocence against the gossips that\r\naspersed it; and during the last trying year of my residence at L----,\r\nhe had sought me, with frank and manly confessions of his regret for his\r\nformer prejudice against me, and assurances of the respect in which he\r\nhad held me ever since my marriage--marriage but in rite--with Lilian.\r\nHe had then, strong in his ruling passion, besought me to consult his\r\nclairvoyants as to her case. I declined this invitation so as not to\r\naffront him,--declined it, not as I should once have done, but with no\r\nword nor look of incredulous disdain. The fact was, that I had conceived\r\na solemn terror of all practices and theories out of the beaten track of\r\nsense and science. Perhaps in my refusal I did wrong. I know not. I was\r\nafraid of my own imagination. He continued not less friendly in spite\r\nof my refusal. And, such are the vicissitudes in human feeling, I\r\nparted from him whom I had regarded as my most bigoted foe with a warmer\r\nsentiment of kindness than for any of those on whom I had counted on\r\nfriendship. He had not deserted Lilian. It was not so with Mrs. Poyntz.\r\nI would have paid tenfold the value of the testimonial to have erased,\r\nfrom the list of those who subscribed to it, her husband’s name.\r\n\r\nThe day before I quitted L----, and some weeks after I had, in fact,\r\nrenounced my practice, I received an urgent entreaty from Miss Brabazon\r\nto call on her. She wrote in lines so blurred that I could with\r\ndifficulty decipher them, that she was very ill, given over by Dr.\r\nJones, who had been attending her. She implored my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the house, a formal man-servant, with indifferent face,\r\ntransferred me to the guidance of a hired nurse, who led me up the\r\nstairs, and, before I was well aware of it, into the room in which Dr.\r\nLloyd had died. Widely different, indeed, the aspect of the walls, the\r\ncharacter of the furniture! The dingy paperhangings were replaced by\r\nairy muslins, showing a rose-coloured ground through their fanciful\r\nopenwork; luxurious fauteuils, gilded wardrobes, full-length mirrors, a\r\ntoilet-table tricked out with lace and ribbons; and glittering with an\r\narray of silver gewgaws and jewelled trinkets,--all transformed the sick\r\nchamber of the simple man of science to a boudoir of death for the vain\r\ncoquette. But the room itself, in its high lattice and heavy ceiling,\r\nwas the same--as the coffin itself has the same confines, whether it be\r\nrich in velvets and bright with blazoning, or rude as a pauper’s shell.\r\n\r\nAnd the bed, with its silken coverlet, and its pillows edged with the\r\nthread-work of Louvain, stood in the same sharp angle as that over which\r\nhad flickered the frowning smoke-reek above the dying, resentful foe.\r\nAs I approached, a man, who was seated beside the sufferer, turned round\r\nhis face, and gave me a silent kindly nod of recognition. He was Mr.\r\nC----, one of the clergy of the town, the one with whom I had the most\r\nfrequently come into contact wherever the physician resigns to the\r\npriest the language that bids man hope. Mr. C-----, as a preacher,\r\nwas renowned for his touching eloquence; as a pastor, revered for his\r\nbenignant piety; as friend and neighbour, beloved for a sweetness of\r\nnature which seemed to regulate all the movements of a mind eminently\r\nmasculine by the beat of a heart tender as the gentlest woman’s.\r\n\r\nThis good man; then whispering something to the sufferer which I did\r\nnot overhear, stole towards me, took me by the hand, and said, also in\r\na whisper, “Be merciful as Christians are.” He led me to the bedside,\r\nthere left me, went out, and closed the door.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I am really dying, Dr. Fenwick?” said a feeble voice. “I\r\nfear Dr. Jones has misunderstood my case. I wish I had called you in at\r\nthe first, but--but I could not--I could not! Will you feel my pulse?\r\nDon’t you think you could do me good?”\r\n\r\nI had no need to feel the pulse in that skeleton wrist; the aspect of\r\nthe face sufficed to tell me that death was drawing near.\r\n\r\nMechanically, however, I went through the hackneyed formulae of\r\nprofessional questions. This vain ceremony done, as gently and\r\ndelicately as I could, I implied the expediency of concluding, if not\r\nyet settled, those affairs which relate to this world.\r\n\r\n“This duty,” I said, “in relieving the mind from care for others to whom\r\nwe owe the forethought of affection, often relieves the body also\r\nof many a gnawing pain, and sometimes, to the surprise of the most\r\nexperienced physician, prolongs life itself.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the old maid, peevishly, “I understand! But it is not my will\r\nthat troubles me. I should not be left to a nurse from a hospital if my\r\nrelations did not know that my annuity dies with me; and I forestalled\r\nit in furnishing this house, Dr. Fenwick, and all these pretty things\r\nwill be sold to pay those horrid tradesmen!--very hard!--so hard!--just\r\nas I got things about me in the way I always said I would have them if\r\nI could ever afford it! I always said I would have my bedroom hung\r\nwith muslin, like dear Lady L----‘s; and the drawing-room in\r\ngeranium-coloured silk: so pretty. You have not seen it: you would not\r\nknow the house, Dr. Fenwick. And just when all is finished, to be taken\r\naway and thrust into the grave. It is so cruel!” And she began to weep.\r\nHer emotion brought on a violent paroxysm, which, when she recovered\r\nfrom it, had produced one of those startling changes of mind that are\r\nsometimes witnessed before death,--changes whereby the whole character\r\nof a life seems to undergo solemn transformation. The hard will becomes\r\ngentle, the proud meek, the frivolous earnest. That awful moment when\r\nthe things of earth pass away like dissolving scenes, leaving death\r\nvisible on the background by the glare that shoots up in the last\r\nflicker of life’s lamp.\r\n\r\nAnd when she lifted her haggard face from my shoulder, and heard my\r\npitying, soothing voice, it was not the grief of a trifler at the loss\r\nof fondled toys that spoke in the fallen lines of her lip, in the woe of\r\nher pleading eyes.\r\n\r\n“So this is death,” she said. “I feel it hurrying on. I must speak.\r\nI promised Mr. C---- that I would. Forgive me, can you--can you? That\r\nletter--that letter to Lilian Ashleigh, I wrote it! Oh, do not look\r\nat me so terribly; I never thought it could do such evil! And am I not\r\npunished enough? I truly believed when I wrote that Miss Ashleigh was\r\ndeceiving you, and once I was silly enough to fancy that you might have\r\nliked me. But I had another motive; I had been so poor all my life--I\r\nhad become rich unexpectedly; I set my heart on this house--I had always\r\nfancied it--and I thought if I could prevent Miss Ashleigh marrying you,\r\nand scare her and her mother from coming back to L----, I could get the\r\nhouse. And I did get it. What for?--to die. I had not been here a\r\nweek before I got the hurt that is killing me--a fall down the\r\nstairs,--coming out of this very room; the stairs had been polished. If\r\nI had stayed in my old lodging, it would not have happened. Oh, say you\r\nforgive me! Say, say it, even if you do not feel you can! Say it!” And\r\nthe miserable woman grasped me by the arm as Dr. Lloyd had grasped me.\r\n\r\nI shaded my averted face with my hands; my heart heaved with the agony\r\nof my suppressed passion. A wrong, however deep, only to myself, I could\r\nhave pardoned without effort; such a wrong to Lilian,--no! I could not\r\nsay “I forgive.”\r\n\r\nThe dying wretch was perhaps more appalled by my silence than she would\r\nhave been by my reproach. Her voice grew shrill in her despair.\r\n\r\n“You will not pardon me! I shall die with your curse on my head! Mercy!\r\nmercy! That good man, Mr. C----, assured me you would be merciful. Have\r\nyou never wronged another? Has the Evil One never tempted you?”\r\n\r\nThen I spoke in broken accents: “Me! Oh, had it been I whom you\r\ndefamed--but a young creature so harmless, so unoffending, and for so\r\nmiserable a motive!”\r\n\r\n“But I tell you, I swear to you, I never dreamed I could cause such\r\nsorrow; and that young man, that Margrave, put it into my head!”\r\n\r\n“Margrave! He had left L---- long before that letter was written!”\r\n\r\n“But he came back for a day just before I wrote: it was the very day.\r\nI met him in the lane yonder. He asked after you,--after Miss Ashleigh;\r\nand when he spoke he laughed, and I said, ‘Miss Ashleigh had been ill,\r\nand was gone away;’ and he laughed again. And I thought he knew more\r\nthan he would tell me, so I asked him if he supposed Mrs. Ashleigh would\r\ncome back, and said how much I should like to take this house if she did\r\nnot; and again he laughed, and said, ‘Birds never stay in the nest after\r\nthe young ones are hurt,’ and went away singing. When I got home, his\r\nlaugh and his song haunted me. I thought I saw him still in my room,\r\nprompting me to write, and I sat down and wrote. Oh, pardon, pardon me!\r\nI have been a foolish poor creature, but never meant to do such harm.\r\nThe Evil One tempted me! There he is, near me now! I see him yonder!\r\nthere, at the doorway. He comes to claim me! As you hope for mercy\r\nyourself, free me from him! Forgive me!”\r\n\r\nI made an effort over myself. In naming Margrave as her tempter, the\r\nwoman had suggested an excuse, echoed from that innermost cell of my\r\nmind, which I recoiled from gazing into, for there I should behold his\r\nimage. Inexpiable though the injury she had wrought against me and mine,\r\nstill the woman was human--fellow-creature-like myself;--but he?\r\n\r\nI took the pale hand that still pressed my arm, and said, with firm\r\nvoice,--\r\n\r\n“Be comforted. In the name of Lilian, my wife, I forgive you for her and\r\nfor me as freely and as fully as we are enjoined by Him, against whose\r\nprecepts the best of us daily sin, to forgive--we children of wrath--to\r\nforgive one another!”\r\n\r\n“Heaven bless you!--oh, bless you!” she murmured, sinking back upon her\r\npillow.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” thought I, “what if the pardon I grant for a wrong far deeper than\r\nI inflicted on him whose imprecation smote me in this chamber, should\r\nindeed be received as atonement, and this blessing on the lips of the\r\ndying annul the dark curse that the dead has left on my path through the\r\nValley of the Shadow!”\r\n\r\nI left my patient sleeping quietly,--the sleep that precedes the last.\r\nAs I went down the stairs into the hall, I saw Mrs. Poyntz standing at\r\nthe threshold, speaking to the man-servant and the nurse.\r\n\r\nI would have passed her with a formal bow, but she stopped me.\r\n\r\n“I came to inquire after poor Miss Brabazon,” said she.\r\n\r\n“You can tell me more than the servants can: is there no hope?”\r\n\r\n“Let the nurse go up and watch beside her. She may pass away in the\r\nsleep into which she has fallen.”\r\n\r\n“Allen Fenwick, I must speak with you--nay, but for a few minutes. I\r\nhear that you leave L---- to-morrow. It is scarcely among the chances\r\nof life that we should meet again.” While thus saying, she drew me along\r\nthe lawn down the path that led towards her own home. “I wish,” said\r\nshe, earnestly, “that you could part with a kindlier feeling towards me;\r\nbut I can scarcely expect it. Could I put myself in your place, and be\r\nmoved by your feelings, I know that I should be implacable; but I--”\r\n\r\n“But you, madam, are The World! and the World governs itself, and\r\ndictates to others, by laws which seem harsh to those who ask from its\r\nfavour the services which the World cannot tender, for the World admits\r\nfavourites, but ignores friends. You did but act to me as the World ever\r\nacts to those who mistake its favour for its friendship.”\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said Mrs. Poyntz, with blunt candour; and we continued to\r\nwalk on silently. At length she said abruptly, “But do you not rashly\r\ndeprive yourself of your only consolation in sorrow? When the heart\r\nsuffers, does your skill admit any remedy like occupation to the mind?\r\nYet you abandon that occupation to which your mind is most accustomed;\r\nyou desert your career; you turn aside, in the midst of the race, from\r\nthe fame which awaits at the goal; you go back from civilization itself,\r\nand dream that all your intellectual cravings can find content in the\r\nlife of a herdsman, amidst the monotony of a wild! No, you will repent,\r\nfor you are untrue to your mind!”\r\n\r\n“I am sick of the word ‘mind’!” said I, bitterly. And therewith I\r\nrelapsed into musing.\r\n\r\nThe enigmas which had foiled my intelligence in the unravelled Sibyl\r\nBook of Nature were mysteries strange to every man’s normal practice\r\nof thought, even if reducible to the fraudulent impressions of outward\r\nsense; for illusions in a brain otherwise healthy suggest problems in\r\nour human organization which the colleges that record them rather guess\r\nat than solve. But the blow which had shattered my life had been dealt\r\nby the hand of a fool. Here, there were no mystic enchantments. Motives\r\nthe most commonplace and paltry, suggested to a brain as trivial and\r\nshallow as ever made the frivolity of woman a theme for the satire of\r\npoets, had sufficed, in devastating the field of my affections, to blast\r\nthe uses for which I had cultured my mind; and had my intellect been as\r\ngreat as heaven ever gave to man, it would have been as vain a shield as\r\nmine against the shaft that had lodged in my heart. While I had, indeed,\r\nbeen preparing my reason and my fortitude to meet such perils, weird and\r\nmarvellous, as those by which tales round the winter fireside scare the\r\ncredulous child, a contrivance--so vulgar and hackneyed that not a day\r\npasses but what some hearth is vexed by an anonymous libel--had\r\nwrought a calamity more dread than aught which my dark guess into the\r\nShadow-Land unpierced by Philosophy could trace to the prompting of\r\nmalignant witchcraft. So, ever this truth runs through all legends of\r\nghost and demon--through the uniform records of what wonder accredits\r\nand science rejects as the supernatural--lo! the dread machinery whose\r\nwheels roll through Hades! What need such awful engines for such mean\r\nresults? The first blockhead we meet in our walk to our grocer’s can\r\ntell us more than the ghost tells us; the poorest envy we ever aroused\r\nhurts us more than the demon. How true an interpreter is Genius to Hell\r\nas to Earth! The Fiend comes to Faust, the tired seeker of knowledge;\r\nHeaven and Hell stake their cause in the Mortal’s temptation. And what\r\ndoes the Fiend to astonish the Mortal? Turn wine into fire, turn love\r\ninto crime. We need no Mephistopheles to accomplish these marvels every\r\nday!\r\n\r\nThus silently thinking, I walked by the side of the world-wise woman;\r\nand when she next spoke, I looked up, and saw that we were at the Monks’\r\nWell, where I had first seen Lilian gazing into heaven!\r\n\r\nMrs. Poyntz had, as we walked, placed her hand on my arm; and, turning\r\nabruptly from the path into the glade, I found myself standing by her\r\nside in the scene where a new sense of being had first disclosed to my\r\nsight the hues with which Love, the passionate beautifier, turns into\r\npurple and gold the gray of the common air. Thus, when romance has ended\r\nin sorrow, and the Beautiful fades from the landscape, the trite and\r\npositive forms of life, banished for a time, reappear, and deepen our\r\nmournful remembrance of the glories they replace. And the Woman of the\r\nWorld, finding how little I was induced to respond to her when she\r\nhad talked of myself, began to speak, in her habitual clear, ringing\r\naccents, of her own social schemes and devices,--\r\n\r\n“I shall miss you when you are gone, Allen Fenwick; for though, during\r\nthe last year or so, all actual intercourse between us has ceased,\r\nyet my interest in you gave some occupation to my thoughts when I sat\r\nalone,--having lost my main object of ambition in settling my daughter,\r\nand having no longer any one in the house with whom I could talk of the\r\nfuture, or for whom I could form a project. It is so wearisome to count\r\nthe changes which pass within us, that we take interest in the changes\r\nthat pass without. Poyntz still has his weather-glass; I have no longer\r\nmy Jane.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot linger with you on this spot,” said I, impatiently turning\r\nback into the path; she followed, treading over fallen leaves. And\r\nunheeding my interruption, she thus continued her hard talk,--\r\n\r\n“But I am not sick of my mind, as you seem to be of yours; I am only\r\nsomewhat tired of the little cage in which, since it has been alone, it\r\nruffles its plumes against the flimsy wires that confine it from wider\r\nspace. I shall take up my home for a time with the new-married couple:\r\nthey want me. Ashleigh Sumner has come into parliament. He means to\r\nattend regularly and work hard, but he does not like Jane to go into\r\nthe world by herself, and he wishes her to go into the world, because he\r\nwants a wife to display his wealth for the improvement of his position.\r\nIn Ashleigh Sumner’s house I shall have ample scope for my energies,\r\nsuch as they are. I have a curiosity to see the few that perch on the\r\nwheels of the State and say, ‘It is we who move the wheels!’ It will\r\namuse me to learn if I can maintain in a capital the authority I\r\nhave won in a country town; if not, I can but return to my small\r\nprincipality. Wherever I live I must sway, not serve. If I succeed--as I\r\nought, for in Jane’s beauty and Ashleigh’s fortune I have materials\r\nfor the woof of ambition, wanting which here, I fall asleep over my\r\nknitting--if I succeed, there will be enough to occupy the rest of my\r\nlife. Ashleigh Sumner must be a power; the power will be represented and\r\nenjoyed by my child, and created and maintained by me! Allen Fenwick,\r\ndo as I do. Be world with the world, and it will only be in moments of\r\nspleen and chagrin that you will sigh to think that the heart may be\r\nvoid when the mind is full. Confess you envy me while you listen.”\r\n\r\n“Not so; all that to you seems so great appears to me so small! Nature\r\nalone is always grand, in her terrors as well as her charms. The World\r\nfor you, Nature for me. Farewell!”\r\n\r\n“Nature!” said Mrs. Poyntz, compassionately. “Poor Allen Fenwick! Nature\r\nindeed,--intellectual suicide! Nay, shake hands, then, if for the last\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nSo we shook hands and parted, where the wicket-gate and the stone stairs\r\nseparated my blighted fairy-land from the common thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nThat night as I was employed in collecting the books and manuscripts\r\nwhich I proposed to take with me, including my long-suspended\r\nphysiological work, and such standard authorities as I might want to\r\nconsult or refer to in the portions yet incompleted, my servant entered\r\nto inform me, in answer to the inquiries I had sent him to make, that\r\nMiss Brabazon had peacefully breathed her last an hour before. Well!\r\nmy pardon had perhaps soothed her last moments; but how unavailing her\r\ndeath-bed repentance to undo the wrong she had done!\r\n\r\nI turned from that thought, and, glancing at the work into which I\r\nhad thrown all my learning, methodized into system with all my art, I\r\nrecalled the pity which Mrs. Poyntz had expressed for my meditated waste\r\nof mind. The tone of superiority which this incarnation of common-sense\r\naccompanied by uncommon will assumed over all that was too deep or too\r\nhigh for her comprehension had sometimes amused me; thinking over it\r\nnow, it piqued. I said to myself, “After all, I shall bear with me such\r\nsolace as intellectual occupation can afford. I shall have leisure to\r\ncomplete this labour; and a record that I have lived and thought may\r\noutlast all the honours which worldly ambition may bestow upon Ashleigh\r\nSummer!” And, as I so murmured, my hand, mechanically selecting the\r\nbooks I needed, fell on the Bible that Julius Faber had given to me.\r\n\r\nIt opened at the Second Book of Esdras, which our Church places amongst\r\nthe Apocrypha, and is generally considered by scholars to have been\r\nwritten in the first or second century of the Christian era,(1)--but in\r\nwhich the questions raised by man in the remotest ages, to which we can\r\ntrace back his desire “to comprehend the ways of the Most High,” are\r\ninvested with a grandeur of thought and sublimity of word to which I\r\nknow of no parallel in writers we call profane.\r\n\r\nMy eye fell on this passage in the lofty argument between the Angel\r\nwhose name was Uriel, and the Prophet, perplexed by his own cravings for\r\nknowledge:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “He (the Angel) answered me, and said, I went into a forest, into a\r\n    plain, and the trees took counsel,\r\n\r\n   “And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea, that it may\r\n    depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods.\r\n\r\n   “The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said,\r\n    Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that there also\r\n    we may make us another country.\r\n\r\n   “The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it.\r\n\r\n   “The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the\r\n    sand stood up and stopped them.\r\n\r\n   “If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldst thou begin to\r\n    justify; or whom wouldst thou condemn?\r\n\r\n   “I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that they both\r\n    have devised; for the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea also\r\n    hath his place to bear his floods.\r\n\r\n   “Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment; but\r\n    why judgest thou not thyself also?\r\n\r\n   “For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his\r\n    floods, even so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing\r\n    but that which is upon the earth; and He that dwelleth above the\r\n    heavens may only understand the things that are above the height of\r\n    the heavens.”\r\n\r\nI paused at those words, and, closing the Sacred Volume, fell into deep,\r\nunquiet thought.\r\n\r\n(1) Such is the supposition of Jahn. Dr. Lee, however, is of opinion\r\nthat the author was contemporary, and, indeed, identical, with the\r\nauthor of the Book of Enoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that the voyage would produce some beneficial effect upon\r\nLilian; but no effect, good or bad, was perceptible, except, perhaps,\r\na deeper silence, a gentler calm. She loved to sit on the deck when the\r\nnights were fair, and the stars mirrored on the deep. And once thus, as\r\nI stood beside her, bending over the rail of the vessel, and gazing on\r\nthe long wake of light which the moon made amidst the darkness of an\r\nocean to which no shore could be seen, I said to myself, “Where is\r\nmy track of light through the measureless future? Would that I could\r\nbelieve as I did when a child! Woe is me, that all the reasonings I take\r\nfrom my knowledge should lead me away from the comfort which the peasant\r\nwho mourns finds in faith! Why should riddles so dark have been thrust\r\nupon me,--me, no fond child of fancy; me, sober pupil of schools the\r\nseverest? Yet what marvel--the strangest my senses have witnessed or\r\nfeigned in the fraud they have palmed on me--is greater than that\r\nby which a simple affection, that all men profess to have known, has\r\nchanged the courses of life prearranged by my hopes and confirmed by my\r\njudgment? How calmly before I knew love I have anatomized its mechanism,\r\nas the tyro who dissects the web-work of tissues and nerves in the dead!\r\nLo! it lives, lives in me; and, in living, escapes from my scalpel, and\r\nmocks all my knowledge. Can love be reduced to the realm of the senses?\r\nNo; what nun is more barred by her grate from the realm of the senses\r\nthan my bride by her solemn affliction? Is love, then, the union of\r\nkindred, harmonious minds? No, my beloved one sits by my side, and I\r\nguess not her thoughts, and my mind is to her a sealed fountain. Yet I\r\nlove her more--oh, ineffably more!--for the doom which destroys the two\r\ncauses philosophy assigns to love--in the form, in the mind! How can I\r\nnow, in my vain physiology, say what is love, what is not? Is it love\r\nwhich must tell me that man has a soul, and that in soul will be found\r\nthe solution of problems never to be solved in body or mind alone?”\r\n\r\nMy self-questionings halted here as Lilian’s hand touched my shoulder.\r\nShe had risen from her seat, and had come to me.\r\n\r\n“Are not the stars very far from earth?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Very far.”\r\n\r\n“Are they seen for the first time to-night?”\r\n\r\n“They were seen, I presume, as we see them, by the fathers of all human\r\nraces!”\r\n\r\n“Yet close below us they shine reflected in the waters; and yet, see,\r\nwave flows on wave before we can count it!”\r\n\r\n“Lilian, by what sympathy do you read and answer my thought?”\r\n\r\nHer reply was incoherent and meaningless. If a gleam of intelligence had\r\nmysteriously lighted my heart to her view, it was gone. But drawing her\r\nnearer towards me, my eye long followed wistfully the path of light,\r\ndividing the darkness on either hand, till it closed in the sloping\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nThe voyage is over. At the seaport at which we landed I found a letter\r\nfrom Faber. My instructions had reached him in time to effect the\r\npurchase on which his descriptions had fixed my desire. The stock, the\r\nimplements of husbandry, the furniture of the house, were included in\r\nthe purchase. All was prepared for my arrival, and I hastened from\r\nthe then miserable village, which may some day rise into one of the\r\nmightiest capitals of the world, to my lodge in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIt was the burst of the Australian spring, which commences in our autumn\r\nmonth of October. The air was loaded with the perfume of the acacias.\r\nAmidst the glades of the open forest land, or climbing the craggy banks\r\nof winding silvery creeks,(1) creepers and flowers of dazzling hue\r\ncontrasted the olive-green of the surrounding foliage. The exhilarating\r\neffect of the climate in that season heightens the charm of the\r\nstrange scenery. In the brilliancy of the sky, in the lightness of the\r\natmosphere, the sense of life is wondrously quickened. With the very\r\nbreath the Adventurer draws in from the racy air, he feels as if\r\ninhaling hope.\r\n\r\nWe have reached our home, we are settled in it; the early unfamiliar\r\nimpressions are worn away. We have learned to dispense with much that we\r\nat first missed, and are reconciled to much that at first disappointed\r\nor displeased.\r\n\r\nThe house is built but of logs; the late proprietor had commenced, upon\r\na rising ground, a mile distant, a more imposing edifice of stone, but\r\nit is not half finished.\r\n\r\nThis log-house is commodious, and much has been done, within and\r\nwithout, to conceal or adorn its primitive rudeness. It is of irregular,\r\npicturesque form, with verandas round three sides of it, to which the\r\ngrape-vine has been trained, with glossy leaves that clamber up to the\r\ngable roof. There is a large garden in front, in which many English\r\nfruit-trees have been set, and grow fast amongst the plants of the\r\ntropics and the orange-trees of Southern Europe. Beyond stretch undulous\r\npastures, studded not only with sheep, but with herds of cattle, which\r\nmy speculative predecessor had bred from parents of famous stock, and\r\nimported from England at mighty cost; but as yet the herds had been of\r\nlittle profit, and they range their luxuriant expanse of pasture with\r\nas little heed. To the left soar up, in long range, the many-coloured\r\nhills; to the right meanders a creek, belted by feathery trees; and\r\non its opposite bank a forest opens, through frequent breaks, into\r\npark-like glades and alleys. The territory, of which I so suddenly find\r\nmyself the lord, is vast, even for a colonial capitalist.\r\n\r\nIt had been originally purchased as “a special survey,” comprising\r\ntwenty thousand acres, with the privilege of pasture over forty thousand\r\nmore. In very little of this land, though it includes some of the\r\nmost fertile districts in the known world, has cultivation been even\r\ncommenced. At the time I entered into possession, even sheep were barely\r\nprofitable; labour was scarce and costly. Regarded as a speculation, I\r\ncould not wonder that my predecessor fled in fear from his domain. Had\r\nI invested the bulk of my capital in this lordly purchase, I should\r\nhave deemed myself a ruined man; but a villa near London, with a hundred\r\nacres, would have cost me as much to buy, and thrice as much to keep\r\nup. I could afford the investment I had made. I found a Scotch bailiff\r\nalready on the estate, and I was contented to escape from rural\r\noccupations, to which I brought no experience, by making it worth his\r\nwhile to serve me with zeal. Two domestics of my own, and two who\r\nhad been for many years with Mrs. Ashleigh, had accompanied us: they\r\nremained faithful and seemed contented. So the clockwork of our mere\r\nhousehold arrangements went on much the same as in our native home.\r\nLilian was not subjected to the ordinary privations and discomforts that\r\nawait the wife even of the wealthy emigrant. Alas! would she have heeded\r\nthem if she had been?\r\n\r\nThe change of scene wrought a decided change for the better in her\r\nhealth and spirits, but not such as implied a dawn of reviving reason.\r\nBut her countenance was now more rarely overcast. Its usual aspect was\r\nglad with a soft mysterious smile. She would murmur snatches of songs,\r\nthat were partly borrowed from English poets, and partly glided away\r\ninto what seemed spontaneous additions of her own,--wanting intelligible\r\nmeaning, but never melody nor rhyme. Strange, that memory and\r\nimitation--the two earliest parents of all inventive knowledge--should\r\nstill be so active, and judgment--the after faculty, that combines the\r\nrest into purpose and method--be annulled!\r\n\r\nJulius Faber I see continually, though his residence is a few miles\r\ndistant. He is sanguine as to Lilian’s ultimate recovery; and, to my\r\namazement and to my envy, he has contrived, by some art which I cannot\r\nattain, to establish between her and himself intelligible communion. She\r\ncomprehends his questions, when mine, though the simplest, seem to her\r\nin unknown language; and he construes into sense her words, that to me\r\nare meaningless riddles.\r\n\r\n“I was right,” he said to me one day, leaving her seated in the garden\r\nbeside her quiet, patient mother, and joining me where I lay--listless\r\nyet fretful--under the shadeless gum-trees, gazing not on the flocks\r\nand fields that I could call my own, but on the far mountain range, from\r\nwhich the arch of the horizon seemed to spring,--“I was right,” said the\r\ngreat physician; “this is reason suspended, not reason lost. Your wife\r\nwill recover; but--”\r\n\r\n“But what?”\r\n\r\n“Give me your arm as I walk homeward, and I will tell you the conclusion\r\nto which I have come.”\r\n\r\nI rose, the old man leaned on me, and we went down the valley along the\r\ncraggy ridges of the winding creek. The woodland on the opposite bank\r\nwas vocal with the chirp and croak and chatter of Australian birds,--all\r\nmirthful, all songless, save that sweetest of warblers, which some early\r\nirreverent emigrant degraded to the name of magpie, but whose note is\r\nsweeter than the nightingale’s, and trills through the lucent air with\r\na distinct ecstatic melody of joy that dominates all the discords, so\r\nravishing the sense, that, while it sings, the ear scarcely heeds the\r\nscream of the parrots.\r\n\r\n(1) Creek is the name given by Australian colonists to precarious water\r\nCourses and tributary streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\n “You may remember,” said Julius Faber, “Sir Humphry Davy’s eloquent description of the effect produced on him by the inhalation of nitrous oxide. He states that he began to lose the perception of external things; trains of vivid visible images rapidly passed through his mind, and were connected with words in such a manner as to produce perceptions perfectly novel. ‘I existed,’ he said, ‘in a world of newly-connected and newly-modified ideas.’ When he recovered, he exclaimed: ‘Nothing exists but thoughts; the universe is composed of impressions, ideas, pleasures, and pains!’\r\n\r\n“Now observe, that thus a cultivator of positive science, endowed with\r\none of the healthiest of human brains, is, by the inhalation of a gas,\r\nabstracted from all external life,--enters into a new world, which\r\nconsists of images he himself creates and animates so vividly that, on\r\nwaking, he resolves the universe itself into thoughts.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, “but what inference do you draw from that voluntary\r\nexperiment, applicable to the malady of which you bid me hope the cure?”\r\n\r\n“Simply this: that the effect produced on a healthful brain by the\r\nnitrous oxide may be produced also by moral causes operating on the\r\nblood, or on the nerves. There is a degree of mental excitement in which\r\nideas are more vivid than sensations, and then the world of external\r\nthings gives way to the world within the brain.(1) But this, though a\r\nsuspension of that reason which comprehends accuracy of judgment, is\r\nno more a permanent aberration of reason than were Sir Humphry Davy’s\r\nvisionary ecstasies under the influence of the gas. The difference\r\nbetween the two states of suspension is that of time, and it is but an\r\naffair of time with our beloved patient. Yet prepare yourself. I fear\r\nthat the mind will not recover without some critical malady of the\r\nbody!”\r\n\r\n“Critical! but not dangerous?--say not dangerous! I can endure the pause\r\nof her reason; I could not endure the void in the universe if her life\r\nwere to fade from the earth.”\r\n\r\n“Poor friend! would not you yourself rather lose life than reason?”\r\n\r\n“I--yes! But we men are taught to set cheap value on our own lives; we\r\ndo not estimate at the same rate the lives of those we love. Did we do\r\nso, Humanity would lose its virtues.”\r\n\r\n“What, then! Love teaches that there is something of nobler value than\r\nmere mind? Yet surely it cannot be the mere body? What is it, if\r\nnot that continuance of being which your philosophy declines to\r\nacknowledge,--namely, soul? If you fear so painfully that your Lilian\r\nshould die, is it not that you fear to lose her forever?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, cease, cease!” I cried impatiently. “I cannot now argue on\r\nmetaphysics. What is it that you anticipate of harm to her life? Her\r\nhealth has been stronger ever since her affliction. She never seems to\r\nknow ailment now. Do you not perceive that her cheek has a more hardy\r\nbloom, her frame a more rounded symmetry, than when you saw her in\r\nEngland?”\r\n\r\n“Unquestionably. Her physical forces have been silently recruiting\r\nthemselves in the dreams which half lull, half amuse her imagination.\r\nImagination! that faculty, the most glorious which is bestowed on the\r\nhuman mind, because it is the faculty which enables thought to create,\r\nis of all others the most exhausting to life when unduly stimulated and\r\nconsciously reasoning on its own creations. I think it probable that\r\nhad this sorrow not befallen you, you would have known a sorrow yet\r\ngraver,--you would have long survived your Lilian. As it is now, when\r\nshe recovers, her whole organization, physical and mental, will have\r\nundergone a beneficent change. But, I repeat my prediction,--some severe\r\nmalady of the body will precede the restoration of the mind; and it\r\nis my hope that the present suspense or aberration of the more wearing\r\npowers of the mind may fit the body to endure and surmount the physical\r\ncrisis. I remember a case, within my own professional experience,\r\nin many respects similar to this, but in other respects it was less\r\nhopeful. I was consulted by a young student of a very delicate physical\r\nframe, of great mental energies, and consumed by an intense ambition.\r\nHe was reading for university honours. He would not listen to me when I\r\nentreated him to rest his mind. I thought that he was certain to obtain\r\nthe distinction for which he toiled, and equally certain to die a few\r\nmonths after obtaining it. He falsified both my prognostics. He so\r\noverworked himself that, on the day of examination, his nerves were\r\nagitated, his memory failed him; he passed, not without a certain\r\ncredit, but fell far short of the rank amongst his fellow competitors\r\nto which he aspired. Here, then, the irritated mind acted on the\r\ndisappointed heart, and raised a new train of emotions. He was first\r\nvisited by spectral illusions; then he sank into a state in which the\r\nexternal world seemed quite blotted out. He heeded nothing that was said\r\nto him; seemed to see nothing that was placed before his eyes,--in a\r\nword, sensations became dormant, ideas preconceived usurped their place,\r\nand those ideas gave him pleasure. He believed that his genius was\r\nrecognized, and lived amongst its supposed creations enjoying an\r\nimaginary fame. So it went on for two years, during which suspense of\r\nhis reason, his frail form became robust and vigorous. At the end of\r\nthat time he was seized with a fever, which would have swept him in\r\nthree days to the grave had it occurred when I was first called in to\r\nattend him. He conquered the fever, and, in recovering, acquired the\r\nfull possession of the intellectual faculties so long suspended. When I\r\nlast saw him, many years afterwards, he was in perfect health, and the\r\nobject of his young ambition was realized; the body had supported the\r\nmind,--he had achieved distinction. Now what had so, for a time, laid\r\nthis strong intellect into visionary sleep? The most agonizing of human\r\nemotions in a noble spirit,--shame! What has so stricken down your\r\nLilian? You have told me the story: shame!--the shame of a nature\r\npre-eminently pure. But observe that, in his case as in hers, the shock\r\ninflicted does not produce a succession of painful illusions: on\r\nthe contrary, in both, the illusions are generally pleasing. Had the\r\nillusions been painful, the body would have suffered, the patient died.\r\nWhy did a painful shock produce pleasing illusions? Because, no matter\r\nhow a shock on the nerves may originate, if it affects the reason, it\r\ndoes but make more vivid than impressions from actual external objects\r\nthe ideas previously most cherished. Such ideas in the young student\r\nwere ideas of earthly fame; such ideas in the young maiden are ideas\r\nof angel comforters and heavenly Edens. You miss her mind on the earth,\r\nand, while we speak, it is in paradise.”\r\n\r\n“Much that you say, my friend, is authorized by the speculations of\r\ngreat writers, with whom I am not unfamiliar; but in none of those\r\nwriters, nor in your encouraging words, do I find a solution for\r\nmuch that has no precedents in my experience,--much, indeed, that has\r\nanalogies in my reading, but analogies which I have hitherto despised\r\nas old wives’ fables. I have bared to your searching eye the weird\r\nmysteries of my life. How do you account for facts which you cannot\r\nresolve into illusions,--for the influence which that strange being,\r\nMargrave, exercised over Lilian’s mind or fancy, so that for a time her\r\nlove for me was as dormant as is her reason now; so that he could draw\r\nher--her whose nature you admit to be singularly pure and modest--from\r\nher mother’s home? The magic wand; the trance into which that wand threw\r\nMargrave himself; the apparition which it conjured up in my own\r\nquiet chamber when my mind was without a care and my health without\r\na flaw,--how account for all this: as you endeavoured, and perhaps\r\nsuccessfully, to account for all my impressions of the Vision in the\r\nMuseum, of the luminous, haunting shadow in its earlier apparitions,\r\nwhen my fancy was heated, my heart tormented, and, it might be, even the\r\nphysical forces of this strong frame disordered?”\r\n\r\n“Allen,” said the old pathologist, “here we approach a ground which few\r\nphysicians have dared to examine. Honour to those who, like our bold\r\ncontemporary, Elliotson, have braved scoff and sacrificed dross in\r\nseeking to extract what is practical in uses, what can be tested by\r\nexperiment, from those exceptional phenomena on which magic sought to\r\nfound a philosophy, and to which philosophy tracks the origin of magic.”\r\n\r\n“What! do I understand you? Is it you, Julius Faber, who attach faith\r\nto the wonders attributed to animal magnetism and electro-biology, or\r\nsubscribe to the doctrines which their practitioners teach?”\r\n\r\n“I have not examined into those doctrines, nor seen with my own eyes the\r\nwonders recorded, upon evidence too respectable, nevertheless, to permit\r\nme peremptorily to deny what I have not witnessed.(2) But wherever I\r\nlook through the History of Mankind in all ages and all races, I find a\r\nconcurrence in certain beliefs which seem to countenance the theory that\r\nthere is in some peculiar and rare temperaments a power over forms of\r\nanimated organization, with which they establish some unaccountable\r\naffinity; and even, though much more rarely, a power over inanimate\r\nmatter. You are familiar with the theory of Descartes, ‘that those\r\nparticles of the blood which penetrate to the brain do not only serve to\r\nnourish and sustain its substance, but to produce there a certain very\r\nsubtle Aura, or rather a flame very vivid and pure, that obtains the\r\nname of the Animal Spirits;’ (3) and at the close of his great fragment\r\nupon Man, he asserts that ‘this flame is of no other nature than all the\r\nfires which are in inanimate bodies.’(4) This notion does but forestall\r\nthe more recent doctrine that electricity is more or less in all, or\r\nnearly all, known matter. Now, whether in the electric fluid or some\r\nother fluid akin to it of which we know still less, thus equally\r\npervading all matter, there may be a certain magnetic property more\r\nactive, more operative upon sympathy in some human constitutions than in\r\nothers, and which can account for the mysterious power I have spoken of,\r\nis a query I might suggest, but not an opinion I would hazard. For an\r\nopinion I must have that basis of experience or authority which I do not\r\nneed when I submit a query to the experience and authority of others.\r\nStill, the supposition conveyed in the query is so far worthy of\r\nnotice, that the ecstatic temperament (in which phrase I comprehend all\r\nconstitutional mystics) is peculiarly sensitive to electric atmospheric\r\ninfluences. This is a fact which most medical observers will have\r\nremarked in the range of their practice. Accordingly, I was prepared\r\nto find Mr. Hare Townshend, in his interesting work,(5) state that he\r\nhimself was of ‘the electric temperament,’ sparks flying from his hair\r\nwhen combed in the dark, etc. That accomplished writer, whose veracity\r\nno one would impugn, affirms that between this electrical endowment and\r\nwhatever mesmeric properties he might possess, there is a remarkable\r\nrelationship and parallelism. Whatever state of the atmosphere tends to\r\naccumulate and insulate electricity in the body, promotes equally’ (says\r\nMr. Townshend) ‘the power and facility with which I influence others\r\nmesmerically.’ What Mr. Townshend thus observes in himself, American\r\nphysicians and professors of chemistry depose to have observed in those\r\nmodern magicians, the mediums of (so-called) ‘spirit manifestation.’\r\nThey state that all such mediums are of the electric temperament, thus\r\neverywhere found allied with the ecstatic, and their power varies in\r\nproportion as the state of the atmosphere serves to depress or augment\r\nthe electricity stored in themselves. Here, then, in the midst of\r\nvagrant phenomena, either too hastily dismissed as altogether the tricks\r\nof fraudful imposture, or too credulously accepted as supernatural\r\nportents--here, at least, in one generalized fact, we may, perhaps, find\r\na starting point, from which inductive experiment may arrive, soon\r\nor late, at a rational theory. But however the power of which we are\r\nspeaking (a power accorded to special physical temperament) may or may\r\nnot be accounted for by some patient student of nature, I am persuaded\r\nthat it is in that power we are to seek for whatever is not wholly\r\nimposture, in the attributes assigned to magic or witchcraft. It is well\r\nsaid, by a writer who has gone into the depth of these subjects with the\r\nresearch of a scholar and the science of a pathologist, ‘that if magic\r\nhad exclusively reposed on credulity and falsehood, its reign would\r\nnever have endured so long; but that its art took its origin in singular\r\nphenomena, proper to certain affections of the nerves, or manifested in\r\nthe conditions of sleep. These phenomena, the principle of which was\r\nat first unknown, served to root faith in magic, and often abused even\r\nenlightened minds. The enchanters and magicians arrived, by divers\r\npractices, at the faculty of provoking in other brains a determined\r\norder of dreams, of engendering hallucinations of all kinds, of inducing\r\nfits of hypnotism, trance, mania, during which the persons so affected\r\nimagined that they saw, heard, touched, supernatural beings, conversed\r\nwith them, proved their influences, assisted at prodigies of which magic\r\nproclaimed itself to possess the secret. The public, the enchanters,\r\nand the enchanted were equally dupes.’(6) Accepting this explanation,\r\nunintelligible to no physician of a practice so lengthened as mine\r\nhas been, I draw from it the corollary, that as these phenomena are\r\nexhibited only by certain special affections, to which only certain\r\nspecial constitutions are susceptible, so not in any superior faculties\r\nof intellect, or of spiritual endowment, but in peculiar physical\r\ntemperaments, often strangely disordered, the power of the sorcerer\r\nin affecting the imagination of others is to be sought. In the native\r\ntribes of Australasia the elders are instructed in the arts of this\r\nso-called sorcery, but only in a very few constitutions does instruction\r\navail to produce effects in which the savages recognize the powers of a\r\nsorcerer: it is so with the Obi of the negroes. The fascination of Obi\r\nis an unquestionable fact, but the Obi man cannot be trained by formal\r\nlessons; he is born a fascinator, as a poet is born a poet. It is so\r\nwith the Laplanders, of whom Tornoeus reports that of those instructed\r\nin the magical art ‘only a few are capable of it.’ ‘Some,’ he says, ‘are\r\nnaturally magicians.’ And this fact is emphatically insisted upon by\r\nthe mystics of our own middle ages, who state that a man must be born\r\na magician; in other words, that the gift is constitutional, though\r\ndeveloped by practice and art. Now, that this gift and its practice\r\nshould principally obtain in imperfect states of civilization, and fade\r\ninto insignificance in the busy social enlightenment of cities, may be\r\naccounted for by reference to the known influences of imagination. In\r\nthe cruder states of social life not only is imagination more frequently\r\npredominant over all other faculties, but it has not the healthful vents\r\nwhich the intellectual competition of cities and civilization affords.\r\nThe man who in a savage tribe, or in the dark feudal ages, would be a\r\nmagician, is in our century a poet, an orator, a daring speculator,\r\nan inventive philosopher. In other words, his imagination is drawn to\r\npursuits congenial to those amongst whom it works. It is the tendency\r\nof all intellect to follow the directions of the public opinion amidst\r\nwhich it is trained. Where a magician is held in reverence or awe, there\r\nwill be more practitioners of magic than where a magician is despised\r\nas an impostor or shut up as a lunatic. In Scandinavia, before the\r\nintroduction of Christianity, all tradition records the wonderful\r\npowers of the Vala, or witch, who was then held in reverence and honour.\r\nChristianity was introduced, and the early Church denounced the Vala as\r\nthe instrument of Satan, and from that moment down dropped the majestic\r\nprophetess into a miserable and execrated old hag!”\r\n\r\n“The ideas you broach,” said I, musingly, “have at moments crossed me,\r\nthough I have shrunk from reducing them to a theory which is but one of\r\npure hypothesis. But this magic, after all, then, you would place in the\r\nimagination of the operator, acting on the imagination of those whom it\r\naffects? Here, at least, I can follow you, to a certain extent, for here\r\nwe get back into the legitimate realm of physiology.”\r\n\r\n“And possibly,” said Faber, “we may find hints to guide us to useful\r\nexamination, if not to complete solution of problems that, once\r\ndemonstrated, may lead to discoveries of infinite value,--hints, I say,\r\nin two writers of widely opposite genius, Van Helmont and Bacon.\r\nVan Helmont, of all the mediaeval mystics, is, in spite of his many\r\nextravagant whims, the one whose intellect is the most suggestive to the\r\ndisciplined reasoners of our day. He supposed that the faculty which he\r\ncalls Fantasy, and which we familiarly call Imagination,--is invested\r\nwith the power of creating for itself ideas independent of the senses,\r\neach idea clothed in a form fabricated by the imagination, and\r\nbecoming an operative entity. This notion is so far favoured by modern\r\nphysiologists, that Lincke reports a case where the eye itself was\r\nextirpated; yet the extirpation was followed by the appearance of\r\nluminous figures before the orbit. And again, a woman, stone-blind,\r\ncomplained of ‘luminous images, with pale colours, before her eyes.’\r\nAbercrombie mentions the case ‘of a lady quite blind, her eyes being\r\nalso disorganized and sunk, who never walked out without seeing a\r\nlittle old woman in a red cloak, who seemed to walk before her.’(7)\r\nYour favourite authority, the illustrious Miller, who was himself in\r\nthe habit of ‘seeing different images in the field of vision when he\r\nlay quietly down to sleep, asserts that these images are not merely\r\npresented to the fancy, but that even the images of dreams are really\r\nseen,’ and that ‘any one may satisfy himself of this by accustoming\r\nhimself regularly to open his eyes when waking after a dream,--the\r\nimages seen in the dream are then sometimes visible, and can be observed\r\nto disappear gradually.’ He confirms this statement not only by the\r\nresult of his own experience, but by the observations made by Spinoza,\r\nand the yet higher authority of Aristotle, who accounts for spectral\r\nappearance as the internal action of the sense of vision.(8) And this\r\nopinion is favoured by Sir David Brewster, whose experience leads him\r\nto suggest ‘that the objects of mental contemplation may be seen as\r\ndistinctly as external objects, and will occupy the same local position\r\nin the axis of vision as if they had been formed by the agency of\r\nlight.’ Be this as it may, one fact remains,--that images can be seen\r\neven by the blind as distinctly and vividly as you and I now see the\r\nstream below our feet and the opossums at play upon yonder boughs.\r\nLet us come next to some remarkable suggestions of Lord Bacon. In his\r\nNatural History, treating of the force of the imagination, and the help\r\nit receives ‘by one man working by another,’ he cites an instance he\r\nhad witnessed of a kind of juggler, who could tell a person what card\r\nhe thought of. He mentioned this ‘to a pretended learned man, curious in\r\nsuch things,’ and this sage said to him, ‘It is not the knowledge of the\r\nman’s thought, for that is proper to God, but the enforcing of a thought\r\nupon him, and binding his imagination by a stronger, so that he could\r\nthink of no other card.’ You see this sage anticipated our modern\r\nelectro-biologists! And the learned man then shrewdly asked Lord Bacon,\r\n‘Did the juggler tell the card to the man himself who had thought of it,\r\nor bid another tell it?’ ‘He bade another tell it,’ answered Lord Bacon.\r\n‘I thought so,’ returned his learned acquaintance, ‘for the juggler\r\nhimself could not have put on so strong an imagination; but by telling\r\nthe card to the other, who believed the juggler was some strange man who\r\ncould do strange things, that other man caught a strong imagination.’(9)\r\nThe whole story is worth reading, because Lord Bacon evidently thinks\r\nit conveys a guess worth examining. And Lord Bacon, were he now living,\r\nwould be the man to solve the mysteries that branch out of mesmerism or\r\n(so-called) spiritual manifestation, for he would not pretend to despise\r\ntheir phenomena for fear of hurting his reputation for good sense.\r\nBacon then goes on to state that there are three ways to fortify the\r\nimagination. ‘First, authority derived from belief in an art and in the\r\nman who exercises it; secondly, means to quicken and corroborate the\r\nimagination; thirdly, means to repeat and refresh it.’ For the second\r\nand the third he refers to the practices of magic, and proceeds\r\nafterwards to state on what things imagination has most force,--‘upon\r\nthings that have the lightest and easiest motions, and, therefore, above\r\nall, upon the spirits of men, and, in them, on such affections as\r\nmove lightest,--in love, in fear, in irresolution. And,’ adds Bacon,\r\nearnestly, in a very different spirit from that which dictates to the\r\nsages of our time the philosophy of rejecting without trial that which\r\nbelongs to the Marvellous,--‘and whatsoever is of this kind, should be\r\nthoroughly inquired into.’ And this great founder or renovator of the\r\nsober inductive system of investigation even so far leaves it a matter\r\nof speculative inquiry, whether imagination may not be so powerful\r\nthat it can actually operate upon a plant, that he says: ‘This likewise\r\nshould be made upon plants, and that diligently; as if you should tell\r\na man that such a tree would die this year, and will him, at these and\r\nthese times, to go unto it and see how it thriveth.’ I presume that\r\nno philosopher has followed such recommendations: had some great\r\nphilosopher done so, possibly we should by this time know all the\r\nsecrets of what is popularly called witchcraft.”\r\n\r\nAnd as Faber here paused, there came a strange laugh from the fantastic\r\nshe-oak-tree overhanging the stream,--a wild, impish laugh.\r\n\r\n“Pooh! it is but the great kingfisher, the laughing-bird of the\r\nAustralian bush,” said Julius Faber, amused at my start of superstitious\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nWe walked on for some minutes in musing silence, and the rude log-hut in\r\nwhich my wise companion had his home came in view,--the flocks grazing\r\non undulous pastures, the lone drinking at a watercourse fringed by the\r\nslender gum-trees, and a few fields, laboriously won from the luxuriant\r\ngrassland, rippling with the wave of corn.\r\n\r\nI halted, and said, “Rest here for a few moments, till I gather up the\r\nconclusions to which your speculative reasoning seems to invite me.”\r\n\r\nWe sat down on a rocky crag, half mantled by luxuriant creepers with\r\nvermilion buds.\r\n\r\n“From the guesses,” said I, “which you have drawn from the erudition of\r\nothers and your own ingenious and reflective inductions, I collect this\r\nsolution of the mysteries, by which the experience I gain from my\r\nsenses confounds all the dogmas approved by my judgment. To the rational\r\nconjectures by which, when we first conversed on the marvels that\r\nperplexed me, you ascribe to my imagination, predisposed by mental\r\nexcitement, physical fatigue or derangement, and a concurrence\r\nof singular events tending to strengthen such predisposition, the\r\nphantasmal impressions produced on my senses,--to these conjectures\r\nyou now add a new one, more startling and less admitted by sober\r\nphysiologists. You conceive it possible that persons endowed with a rare\r\nand peculiar temperament can so operate on imagination, and, through\r\nthe imagination, on the senses of others, as to exceed even the powers\r\nascribed to the practitioners of mesmerism and electro-biology, and give\r\na certain foundation of truth to the old tales of magic and witchcraft.\r\nYou imply that Margrave may be a person thus gifted, and hence the\r\ninfluence he unquestionably exercised over Lilian, and over, perhaps,\r\nless innocent agents, charmed or impelled by his will. And not\r\ndiscarding, as I own I should have been originally induced to do,\r\nthe queries or suggestions adventured by Bacon in his discursive\r\nspeculations on Nature, to wit, ‘that there be many things, some of them\r\ninanimate, that operate upon the spirits of men by secret sympathy and\r\nantipathy,’ and to which Bacon gave the quaint name of ‘imaginants,’ so\r\neven that wand, of which I have described to you the magic-like effects,\r\nmay have had properties communicated to it by which it performs the work\r\nof the magician, as mesmerists pretend that some substance mesmerized\r\nby them can act on the patient as sensibly as if it were the mesmerizer\r\nhimself. Do I state your suppositions correctly?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; always remembering that they are only suppositions, and\r\nvolunteered with the utmost diffidence. But since, thus seated in the\r\nearly wilderness, we permit ourselves the indulgence of childlike guess,\r\nmay it not be possible, apart from the doubtful question whether a man\r\ncan communicate to an inanimate material substance a power to act upon\r\nthe mind or imagination of another man--may it not, I say, be possible\r\nthat such a substance may contain in itself such a virtue or property\r\npotent over certain constitutions, though not over all. For instance, it\r\nis in my experience that the common hazel-wood will strongly affect some\r\nnervous temperaments, though wholly without effect on others. I remember\r\na young girl, who having taken up a hazel-stick freshly cut, could not\r\nrelax her hold of it; and when it was wrenched away from her by force,\r\nwas irresistibly attracted towards it, repossessed herself of it, and,\r\nafter holding it a few minutes, was cast into a kind of trance, in which\r\nshe beheld phantasmal visions. Mentioning this curious case, which I\r\nsupposed unique, to a learned brother of our profession, he told me that\r\nhe had known other instances of the effect of the hazel upon nervous\r\ntemperaments in persons of both sexes. Possibly it was some such\r\npeculiar property in the hazel that made it the wood selected for the\r\nold divining-rod. Again, we know that the bay-tree, or laurel, was\r\ndedicated to the oracular Pythian Apollo. Now wherever, in the old\r\nworld, we find that the learning of the priests enabled them to exhibit\r\nexceptional phenomena, which imposed upon popular credulity, there was a\r\nsomething or other which is worth a philosopher’s while to explore;\r\nand, accordingly, I always suspected that there was in the laurel\r\nsome property favourable to ecstatic vision in highly impressionable\r\ntemperaments. My suspicion, a few years ago, was justified by the\r\nexperience of a German physician, who had under his care a cataleptic\r\nor ecstatic patient, and who assured me that he found nothing in this\r\npatient so stimulated the state of ‘sleep-waking,’ or so disposed that\r\nstate to indulge in the hallucinations of prevision, as the berry of\r\nthe laurel.(10) Well, we do not know what this wand that produced a\r\nseemingly magical effect upon you was really composed of. You did not\r\nnotice the metal employed in the wire, which you say communicated a\r\nthrill to the sensitive nerves in the palm of the hand. You cannot tell\r\nhow far it might have been the vehicle of some fluid force in nature. Or\r\nstill more probably, whether the pores of your hand insensibly imbibed,\r\nand communicated to the brain, some of those powerful narcotics from\r\nwhich the Buddhists and the Arabs make unguents that induce visionary\r\nhallucinations, and in which substances undetected in the hollow of the\r\nwand, or the handle of the wand itself, might be steeped.(11) One thing\r\nwe do know, namely, that amongst the ancients, and especially in the\r\nEast, the construction of wands for magical purposes was no commonplace\r\nmechanical craft, but a special and secret art appropriated to men who\r\ncultivated with assiduity all that was then known of natural science\r\nin order to extract from it agencies that might appear supernatural.\r\nPossibly, then, the rods or wands of the East, of which Scripture makes\r\nmention, were framed upon some principles of which we in our day are\r\nvery naturally ignorant, since we do not ransack science for the same\r\nsecrets; and thus, in the selection or preparation of the material\r\nemployed, mainly consisted whatever may be referrible to natural\r\nphilosophical causes in the antique science of Rhabdomancy, or\r\ndivination and enchantment by wands. The staff, or wand, of which you\r\ntell me, was, you say, made of iron or steel and tipped with crystal.\r\nPossibly iron and crystal do really contain some properties not hitherto\r\nscientifically analyzed, and only, indeed, potential over exceptional\r\ntemperaments, which may account for the fact that iron and crystal have\r\nbeen favourites with all professed mystics, ancient and modern. The\r\nDelphic Pythoness had her iron tripod, Mesmer his iron bed; and many\r\npersons, indisputably honest, cannot gaze long upon a ball of crystal\r\nbut what they begin to see visions. I suspect that a philosophical cause\r\nfor such seemingly preternatural effects of crystal and iron will be\r\nfound in connection with the extreme impressionability to changes in\r\ntemperatures which is the characteristic both of crystal and iron.\r\nBut if these materials do contain certain powers over exceptional\r\nconstitutions, we do not arrive at a supernatural but at a natural\r\nphenomenon.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” said I, “even granting that your explanatory hypotheses hit\r\nor approach the truth;--still what a terrible power you would assign to\r\nman’s will over men’s reason and deeds!”\r\n\r\n“Man’s will,” answered Faber, “has over men’s deeds and reason, habitual\r\nand daily, power infinitely greater and, when uncounterbalanced,\r\ninfinitely more dangerous than that which superstition exaggerates in\r\nmagic. Man’s will moves a war that decimates a race, and leaves behind\r\nit calamities little less dire than slaughter. Man’s will frames, but it\r\nalso corrupts laws; exalts, but also demoralizes opinion; sets the world\r\nmad with fanaticism, as often as it curbs the heart’s fierce instincts\r\nby the wisdom of brother-like mercy. You revolt at the exceptional,\r\nlimited sway over some two or three individuals which the arts of a\r\nsorcerer (if sorcerer there be) can effect; and yet, at the very moment\r\nin which you were perplexed and appalled by such sway, or by your\r\nreluctant belief in it, your will was devising an engine to unsettle the\r\nreason and wither the hopes of millions!”\r\n\r\n“My will! What engine?”\r\n\r\n“A book conceived by your intellect, adorned by your learning, and\r\ndirected by your will, to steal from the minds of other men their\r\npersuasion of the soul’s everlasting Hereafter.”\r\n\r\nI bowed my head, and felt myself grow pale.\r\n\r\n“And if we accept Bacon’s theory of ‘secret sympathy,’ or the plainer\r\nphysiological maxim that there must be in the imagination, morbidly\r\nimpressed by the will of another, some trains of idea in affinity with\r\nsuch influence and preinclined to receive it, no magician could warp you\r\nto evil, except through thoughts that themselves went astray. Grant\r\nthat the Margrave who still haunts your mind did really, by some occult,\r\nsinister magnetism, guide the madman to murder, did influence the\r\nservant-woman’s vulgar desire to pry into the secrets of her ill-fated\r\nmaster, or the old maid’s covetous wish and envious malignity: what\r\ncould this awful magician do more than any commonplace guilty adviser,\r\nto a mind predisposed to accept the advice?”\r\n\r\n“You forget one example which destroys your argument,--the spell which\r\nthis mysterious fascinator could cast upon a creature so pure from all\r\nguilt as Lilian!”\r\n\r\n“Will you forgive me if I answer frankly?”\r\n\r\n“Speak.”\r\n\r\n“Your Lilian is spotless and pure as you deem her, and the fascination,\r\ntherefore, attempts no lure through a sinful desire; it blends with\r\nits attraction no sentiment of affection untrue to yourself. Nay, it is\r\njustice to your Lilian, and may be melancholy comfort to you, to state\r\nmy conviction, based on the answers my questions have drawn from her,\r\nthat you were never more cherished by her love than when that love\r\nseemed to forsake you. Her imagination impressed her with the illusion\r\nthat through your love for her you were threatened with a great\r\nperil. What seemed the levity of her desertion was the devotion of\r\nself-sacrifice. And, in her strange, dream-led wanderings, do not think\r\nthat she was conscious of the fascination you impute to this mysterious\r\nMargrave: in her belief it was your own guardian angel that guided her\r\nsteps, and her pilgrimage was ordained to disarm the foe that menaced\r\nyou, and dissolve the spell that divided her life from yours! But had\r\nshe not, long before this, willingly prepared herself to be so deceived?\r\nHad not her fancies been deliberately encouraged to dwell remote from\r\nthe duties we are placed on the earth to perform? The loftiest faculties\r\nin our nature are those that demand the finest poise, not to fall from\r\ntheir height and crush all the walls that they crown. With exquisite\r\nbeauty of illustration, Hume says of the dreamers of ‘bright fancies,’\r\n‘that they may be compared to those angels whom the Scriptures represent\r\nas covering their eyes with their wings.’ Had you been, like my nephew,\r\na wrestler for bread with the wilderness, what helpmate would your\r\nLilian have been to you? How often would you have cried out in\r\njustifiable anger, ‘I, son of Adam, am on earth, not in Paradise! Oh,\r\nthat my Eve were at home on my hearth, and not in the skies with the\r\nseraphs!’ No Margrave, I venture to say, could have suspended the\r\nhealthful affections, or charmed into danger the wide-awake soul of my\r\nAmy. When she rocks in its cradle the babe the young parents intrust to\r\nher heed; when she calls the kine to the milking, the chicks to their\r\ncorn; when she but flits through my room to renew the flowers on the\r\nstand, or range in neat order the books that I read, no spell on her\r\nfancy could lead her a step from the range of her provident cares! At\r\nday she is contented to be on the commonplace earth; at evening she and\r\nI knock together at the one door of heaven, which opes to thanksgiving\r\nand prayer; and thanksgiving and prayer send us back, calm and hopeful,\r\nto the task that each morrow renews.”\r\n\r\nI looked up as the old man paused, and in the limpid clearness of the\r\nAustralian atmosphere, I saw the child he thus praised standing by the\r\ngarden-gate, looking towards us, and though still distant she seemed\r\nnear. I felt wroth with her. My heart so cherished my harmless,\r\ndefenceless Lilian, that I was jealous of the praise taken from her to\r\nbe bestowed on another.\r\n\r\n“Each of us,” said I, coldly, “has his or her own nature, and the uses\r\nharmonious to that nature’s idiosyncrasy. The world, I grant, would get\r\non very ill if women were not more or less actively useful and quietly\r\ngood, like your Amy. But the world would lose standards that exalt and\r\nrefine, if no woman were permitted to gain, through the indulgence of\r\nfancy, thoughts exquisite as those which my Lilian conceived, while\r\nthought, alas! flowed out of fancy. I do not wound you by citing your\r\nAmy as a type of the mediocre; I do not claim for Lilian the rank we\r\naccord to the type of genius. But both are alike to such types in this:\r\nnamely, that the uses of mediocrity are for every-day life, and the uses\r\nof genius, amidst a thousand mistakes which mediocrity never commits,\r\nare to suggest and perpetuate ideas which raise the standard of the\r\nmediocre to a nobler level. There would be fewer Amys in life if there\r\nwere no Lilian! as there would be far fewer good men of sense if there\r\nwere no erring dreamer of genius!”\r\n\r\n“You say well, Allen Fenwick. And who should be so indulgent to the\r\nvagaries of the imagination as the philosophers who taught your youth\r\nto doubt everything in the Maker’s plan of creation which could not\r\nbe mathematically proved? ‘The human mind,’ said Luther, ‘is like a\r\ndrunkard on horseback; prop it on one side, and it falls on the other.’\r\nSo the man who is much too enlightened to believe in a peasant’s\r\nreligion, is always sure to set up some insane superstition of his own.\r\nOpen biographical volumes wherever you please, and the man who has no\r\nfaith in religion is a man who has faith in a nightmare. See that type\r\nof the elegant sceptics,--Lord Herbert of Cherbury. He is writing a book\r\nagainst Revelation; he asks a sign from heaven to tell him if his book\r\nis approved by his Maker, and the man who cannot believe in the miracles\r\nperformed by his Saviour gravely tells us of a miracle vouchsafed to\r\nhimself. Take the hardest and strongest intellect which the hardest\r\nand strongest race of mankind ever schooled and accomplished. See the\r\ngreatest of great men, the great Julius Caesar! Publicly he asserts\r\nin the Senate that the immortality of the soul is a vain chimera. He\r\nprofesses the creed which Roman voluptuaries deduced from Epicurus,\r\nand denies all Divine interference in the affairs of the earth. A great\r\nauthority for the Materialists--they have none greater! They can show\r\non their side no intellect equal to Caesar’s! And yet this magnificent\r\nfreethinker, rejecting a soul and a Deity, habitually entered his\r\nchariot muttering a charm; crawled on his knees up the steps of a temple\r\nto propitiate the abstraction called ‘Nemesis;’ and did not cross the\r\nRubicon till he had consulted the omens. What does all this prove?--a\r\nvery simple truth. Man has some instincts with the brutes; for instance,\r\nhunger and sexual love. Man has one instinct peculiar to himself, found\r\nuniversally (or with alleged exceptions in savage States so rare, that\r\nthey do not affect the general law(12)),--an instinct of an invisible\r\npower without this earth, and of a life beyond the grave, which that\r\npower vouchsafes to his spirit. But the best of us cannot violate an\r\ninstinct with impunity. Resist hunger as long as you can, and, rather\r\nthan die of starvation, your instinct will make you a cannibal; resist\r\nlove when youth and nature impel to it, and what pathologist does not\r\ntrack one broad path into madness or crime? So with the noblest instinct\r\nof all. Reject the internal conviction by which the grandest thinkers\r\nhave sanctioned the hope of the humblest Christian, and you are\r\nservile at once to some faith inconceivably more hard to believe. The\r\nimagination will not be withheld from its yearnings for vistas beyond\r\nthe walls of the flesh, and the span of the present hour. Philosophy\r\nitself, in rejecting the healthful creeds by which man finds his\r\nsafeguards in sober prayer and his guide through the wilderness of\r\nvisionary doubt, invents systems compared to which the mysteries of\r\ntheology are simple. Suppose any man of strong, plain understanding had\r\nnever heard of a Deity like Him whom we Christians adore, then ask this\r\nman which he can the better comprehend in his mind, and accept as a\r\nnatural faith,--namely, the simple Christianity of his shepherd or the\r\nPantheism of Spinoza? Place before an accomplished critic (who comes\r\nwith a perfectly unprejudiced mind to either inquiry), first, the\r\narguments of David Hume against the gospel miracles, and then the\r\nmetaphysical crotchets of David Hume himself. This subtle philosopher,\r\nnot content, with Berkeley, to get rid of matter,--not content, with\r\nCondillac, to get rid of spirit or mind,--proceeds to a miracle greater\r\nthan any his Maker has yet vouchsafed to reveal. He, being then alive\r\nand in the act of writing, gets rid of himself altogether. Nay, he\r\nconfesses he cannot reason with any one who is stupid enough to think he\r\nhas a self. His words are: ‘What we call a mind is nothing but a heap\r\nor collection of different perceptions or objects united together by\r\ncertain relations, and supposed, though falsely, to be endowed with\r\nperfect simplicity and identity. If any one, upon serious and candid\r\nreflection, thinks he has a different notion of himself, I must confess\r\nI can reason with him no longer.’ Certainly I would rather believe all\r\nthe ghost stories upon record than believe that I am not even a ghost,\r\ndistinct and apart from the perceptions conveyed to me, no matter\r\nhow,--just as I am distinct and apart from the furniture in my room,\r\nno matter whether I found it there or whether I bought it. If some old\r\ncosmogonist asked you to believe that the primitive cause of the\r\nsolar system was not to ‘be traced to a Divine Intelligence, but to\r\na nebulosity, originally so diffused that its existence can with\r\ndifficulty be conceived, and that the origin of the present system of\r\norganized beings equally dispensed with the agency of a creative mind,\r\nand could be referred to molecules formed in the water by the power\r\nof attraction, till by modifications of cellular tissue in the gradual\r\nlapse of ages, one monad became an oyster and another a Man,--would you\r\nnot say this cosmogony could scarce have misled the human understanding\r\neven in the earliest dawn of speculative inquiry? Yet such are the\r\nhypotheses to which the desire to philosophize away that simple\r\nproposition of a Divine First Cause, which every child can comprehend,\r\nled two of the greatest geniuses and profoundest reasoners of modern\r\ntimes,--La Place and La Marck.(13) Certainly, the more you examine those\r\narch phantasmagorists, the philosophers who would leave nothing in the\r\nuniverse but their own delusions, the more your intellectual pride may\r\nbe humbled. The wildest phenomena which have startled you are not more\r\nextravagant than the grave explanations which intellectual presumption\r\nadventures on the elements of our own organism and the relations between\r\nthe world of matter and the world of ideas.”\r\n\r\nHere our conversation stopped, for Amy had now joined us, and, looking\r\nup to reply, I saw the child’s innocent face between me and the furrowed\r\nbrow of the old man.\r\n\r\n(1) See, on the theory elaborated from this principle, Dr. Hibbert’s\r\ninteresting and valuable work on the “Philosophy of Apparitions.”\r\n\r\n(2) What Faber here says is expressed with more authority by one of the\r\nmost accomplished metaphysicians of our time (Sir W. Hamilton):\r\n\r\n“Somnambulism is a phenomenon still more astonishing (than dreaming).\r\nIn this singular state a person performs a regular series of rational\r\nactions, and those frequently of the most difficult and delicate nature;\r\nand what is still more marvellous, with a talent to which he could make\r\nno pretension when awake. (Cr. Ancillon, Essais Philos. ii. 161.) His\r\nmemory and reminiscence supply him with recollections of words and\r\nthings which, perhaps, never were at his disposal in the ordinary\r\nstate,--he speaks more fluently a more refined language. And if we\r\nare to credit what the evidence on which it rests hardly allows us to\r\ndisbelieve, he has not only perception of things through other channels\r\nthan the common organs of sense, but the sphere of his cognition\r\nis amplified to an extent far beyond the limits to which sensible\r\nperception is confined. This subject is one of the most perplexing in\r\nthe whole compass of philosophy; for, on the one hand, the phenomena are\r\nso remarkable that they cannot be believed, and yet, on the other, they\r\nare of so unambiguous and palpable a character, and the witnesses to\r\ntheir reality are so numerous, so intelligent, and so high above every\r\nsuspicion of deceit, that it is equally impossible to deny credit to\r\nwhat is attested by such ample and un exceptionable evidence.”--Sir W.\r\nHamilton: Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic, vol. ii. p. 274.\r\n\r\nThis perplexity, in which the distinguished philosopher leaves the\r\njudgment so equally balanced that it finds it impossible to believe, and\r\nyet impossible to disbelieve, forms the right state of mind in which\r\na candid thinker should come to the examination of those more\r\nextraordinary phenomena which he has not himself yet witnessed, but\r\nthe fair inquiry into which may be tendered to him by persons above\r\nthe imputation of quackery and fraud. Muffler, who is not the\r\nleast determined, as he is certainly one of the most distinguished,\r\ndisbelievers of mesmeric phenomena, does not appear to have witnessed,\r\nor at least to have carefully examined, them, or he would, perhaps, have\r\nseen that even the more extraordinary of those phenomena confirm, rather\r\nthan contradict, his own general theories, and may be explained by the\r\nsympathies one sense has with another,--“the laws of reflection through\r\nthe medium of the brain.” (Physiology of the Senses, p. 1311.) And\r\nagain by the maxim “that the mental principle, or cause of the mental\r\nphenomena, cannot be confined to the brain, but that it exists in a\r\nlatent state in every part of the organism.” (Ibid., p. 1355.) The\r\n“nerve power,” contended for by Mr. Bain, also may suggest a rational\r\nsolution of much that has seemed incredible to those physiologists who\r\nhave not condescended to sift the genuine phenomena of mesmerism from\r\nthe imposture to which, in all ages, the phenomena exhibited by what may\r\nbe called the ecstatic temperament have been applied.\r\n\r\n(3) Descartes, L’Homme, vol. iv. p. 345.

Mr. Bain, in his thoughtful and suggestive\r\nwork on the “Senses and Intellect,” makes very powerful use of these\r\nstatements in support of his proposition, which Faber advances in other\r\nwords, namely, “the return of the nervous currents exactly on their old\r\ntrack in revived sensations.”\r\n\r\n(9) Perhaps it is for the reason suggested in the text, namely, that the\r\nmagician requires the interposition of a third imagination between\r\nhis own and that of the consulting believer, that any learned adept in\r\n(so-called) magic will invariably refuse to exhibit without the presence\r\nof a third person. Hence the author of “Dogme et Rituel de la Haute\r\nMagic,” printed at Parisy 1852-53--a book less remarkable for its\r\nlearning than for the earnest belief of a scholar of our own day in the\r\nreality of the art of which he records the history--insists much on the\r\nnecessity of rigidly observing Le Ternaire, in the number of persons who\r\nassist in an enchanter’s experiments.\r\n\r\n(10) I may add that Dr. Kerner instances the effect of laurel-berries\r\non the Seeress of Prevorst, corresponding with that asserted by Julius\r\nFaber in the text.\r\n\r\n(11) See for these unguents the work of M. Maury, before quoted, “La\r\nMagic et l’Astrologie,” etc., p. 417.\r\n\r\n(12) It seems extremely doubtful whether the very few instances in\r\nwhich it has been asserted that a savage race has been found without\r\nrecognition of a Deity and a future state would bear searching\r\nexamination. It is set forth, for example, in most of the popular works\r\non Australia, that the Australian savages have no notion of a Deity or\r\na Hereafter, that they only worship a devil, or evil spirit. This\r\nassumption, though made more peremptorily, and by a greater number of\r\nwriters than any similar one regarding other savages, is altogether\r\nerroneous, and has no other foundation than the ignorance of the\r\nwriters. The Australian savages recognize a Deity, but He is too august\r\nfor a name in their own language; in English they call Him the Great\r\nMaster,--an expression synonymous with “The Great Lord.” They believe\r\nin a hereafter of eternal joy, and place it amongst the stars.--See\r\nStrzelecki’s Physical Description of New South Wales.\r\n\r\n(13) See the observations on La Place and La Marck in the Introduction\r\nto Kirby’s “Bridgewater Treatise.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nI turned back alone. The sun was reddening the summits of the distant\r\nmountain-range, but dark clouds, that portended rain, were gathering\r\nbehind my way and deepening the shadows in many a chasm and hollow which\r\nvolcanic fires had wrought on the surface of uplands undulating like\r\ndiluvian billows fixed into stone in the midst of their stormy swell. I\r\nwandered on and away from the beaten track, absorbed in thought. Could\r\nI acknowledge in Julius Faber’s conjectures any basis for logical\r\nratiocination; or were they not the ingenious fancies of that empirical\r\nPhilosophy of Sentiment by which the aged, in the decline of severer\r\nfaculties, sometimes assimilate their theories to the hazy romance of\r\nyouth? I can well conceive that the story I tell will be regarded by\r\nmost as a wild and fantastic fable; that by some it may be considered a\r\nvehicle for guesses at various riddles of Nature, without or within\r\nus, which are free to the license of romance, though forbidden to the\r\ncaution of science. But, I--I--know unmistakably my own identity, my\r\nown positive place in a substantial universe. And beyond that knowledge,\r\nwhat do I know? Yet had Faber no ground for his startling parallels\r\nbetween the chimeras of superstition and the alternatives to faith\r\nvolunteered by the metaphysical speculations of knowledge? On the\r\ntheorems of Condillac, I, in common with numberless contemporaneous\r\nstudents (for, in my youth, Condillac held sway in the schools, as now,\r\ndriven forth from the schools, his opinions float loose through the\r\ntalk and the scribble of men of the world, who perhaps never opened his\r\npage),--on the theorems of Condillac I had built up a system of thought\r\ndesigned to immure the swathed form of material philosophy from all\r\nrays and all sounds of a world not material, as the walls of some blind\r\nmausoleum shut out, from the mummy within, the whisper of winds and the\r\ngleaming of stars.\r\n\r\nAnd did not those very theorems, when carried out to their strict and\r\ncompleting results by the close reasonings of Hume, resolve my own\r\nliving identity, the one conscious indivisible me, into a bundle\r\nof memories derived from the senses which had bubbled and duped my\r\nexperience, and reduce into a phantom, as spectral as that of the\r\nLuminous Shadow, the whole solid frame of creation?\r\n\r\nWhile pondering these questions, the storm whose forewarnings I had\r\nneglected to heed burst forth with all the suddenness peculiar to the\r\nAustralian climes. The rains descended like the rushing of floods. In\r\nthe beds of watercourses, which, at noon, seemed dried up and exhausted,\r\nthe torrents began to swell and to rave; the gray crags around them were\r\nanimated into living waterfalls. I looked round, and the landscape was\r\nas changed as a scene that replaces a scene on the player’s stage. I\r\nwas aware that I had wandered far from my home, and I knew not what\r\ndirection I should take to regain it. Close at hand, and raised above\r\nthe torrents that now rushed in many a gully and tributary creek, around\r\nand before me, the mouth of a deep cave, overgrown with bushes and\r\ncreeping flowers tossed wildly to and fro between the rain from above\r\nand the spray of cascades below, offered a shelter from the storm.\r\nI entered,--scaring innumerable flocks of bats striking against me,\r\nblinded by the glare of the lightning that followed me into the cavern,\r\nand hastening to resettle themselves on the pendants of stalactites, or\r\nthe jagged buttresses of primaeval wall.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the lightning darted into the gloom and lingered\r\namongst its shadows; and I saw, by the flash, that the floors on which I\r\nstood were strewed with strange bones, some amongst them the fossilized\r\nrelics of races destroyed by the Deluge. The rain continued for more\r\nthan two hours with unabated violence; then it ceased almost as suddenly\r\nas it had come on, and the lustrous moon of Australia burst from the\r\nclouds shining bright as an English dawn, into the hollows of the\r\ncave. And then simultaneously arose all the choral songs of the\r\nwilderness,--creatures whose voices are heard at night,--the loud whir\r\nof the locusts, the musical boom of the bullfrog, the cuckoo note of the\r\nmorepork, and, mournful amidst all those merrier sounds, the hoot of the\r\nowl, through the wizard she-oaks and the pale green of the gum-trees.\r\n\r\nI stepped forth into the open air and gazed, first instinctively on the\r\nheavens, next, with more heedful eye, upon the earth. The nature of the\r\nsoil bore the evidence of volcanic fires long since extinguished. Just\r\nbefore my feet, the rays fell full upon a bright yellow streak in the\r\nblock of quartz half imbedded in the soft moist soil. In the midst of\r\nall the solemn thoughts and the intense sorrows which weighed upon heart\r\nand mind, that yellow gleam startled the mind into a direction remote\r\nfrom philosophy, quickened the heart to a beat that chimed with no\r\nhousehold affections. Involuntarily I stooped; impulsively I struck the\r\nblock with the hatchet, or tomahawk, I carried habitually about me, for\r\nthe purpose of marking the trees that I wished to clear from the waste\r\nof my broad domain. The quartz was shattered by the stroke, and left\r\ndisburied its glittering treasure. My first glance had not deceived me.\r\nI, vain seeker after knowledge, had, at least, discovered gold. I took\r\nup the bright metal--gold! I paused; I looked round; the land that\r\njust before had seemed to me so worthless took the value of Ophir. Its\r\nfeatures had before been as unknown to me as the Mountains of the Moon,\r\nand now my memory became wonderfully quickened. I recalled the rough map\r\nof my possessions, the first careless ride round their boundaries.\r\nYes, the land on which I stood--for miles, to the spur of those farther\r\nmountains--the land was mine, and, beneath its surface, there was gold!\r\nI closed my eyes; for some moments visions of boundless wealth, and of\r\nthe royal power which such wealth could command, swept athwart my brain.\r\nBut my heart rapidly settled back to its real treasure. “What matters,”\r\n I sighed, “all this dross? Could Ophir itself buy back to my Lilian’s\r\nsmile one ray of the light which gave ‘glory to the grass and splendour\r\nto the flower’?”\r\n\r\nSo muttering, I flung the gold into the torrent that raged below, and\r\nwent on through the moonlight, sorrowing silently,--only thankful for\r\nthe discovery that had quickened my reminiscence of the landmarks by\r\nwhich to steer my way through the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe night was half gone, for even when I had gained the familiar track\r\nthrough the pastures, the swell of the many winding creeks that now\r\nintersected the way obliged me often to retrace my steps; to find,\r\nsometimes, the bridge of a felled tree which had been providently left\r\nunremoved over the now foaming torrent, and, more than once, to swim\r\nacross the current, in which swimmers less strong or less practised\r\nwould have been dashed down the falls, where loose logs and torn trees\r\nwent clattering and whirling: for I was in danger of life. A band of\r\nthe savage natives were stealthily creeping on my track,--the natives\r\nin those parts were not then so much awed by the white man as now. A\r\nboomerang(1) had whirred by me, burying itself amongst the herbage close\r\nbefore my feet. I had turned, sought to find and to face these dastardly\r\nfoes; they contrived to elude me. But when I moved on, my ear, sharpened\r\nby danger, heard them moving, too, in my rear. Once only three hideous\r\nforms suddenly faced me, springing up from a thicket, all tangled with\r\nhoneysuckles and creepers of blue and vermilion. I walked steadily up\r\nto them. They halted a moment or so in suspense; but perhaps they were\r\nscared by my stature or awed by my aspect; and the Unfamiliar, though\r\nHuman, had terror for them, as the Unfamiliar, although but a Shadow,\r\nhad had terror for me. They vanished, and as quickly as if they had\r\ncrept into the earth.\r\n\r\nAt length the air brought me the soft perfume of my well-known acacias,\r\nand my house stood before me, amidst English flowers and English\r\nfruit-trees, under the effulgent Australian moon. Just as I was opening\r\nthe little gate which gave access from the pastureland into the garden,\r\na figure in white rose up from under light, feathery boughs, and a hand\r\nwas laid on my arm. I started; but my surprise was changed into fear\r\nwhen I saw the pale face and sweet eyes of Lilian.\r\n\r\n“Heavens! you here! you! at this hour! Lilian, what is this?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” she whispered, clinging to me; “hush! do not tell: no one knows.\r\nI missed you when the storm came on; I have missed you ever since.\r\nOthers went in search of you and came back. I could not sleep, but the\r\nrest are sleeping, so I stole down to watch for you. Brother, brother,\r\nif any harm chanced to you, even the angels could not comfort me; all\r\nwould be dark, dark! But you are safe, safe, safe!” And she clung to me\r\nyet closer.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Lilian, Lilian, your vision in the hour I first beheld you was\r\nindeed prophetic,--‘each has need of the other.’ Do you remember?”\r\n\r\n“Softly, softly,” she said, “let me think!” She stood quietly by my\r\nside, looking up into the sky, with all its numberless stars, and its\r\nsolitary moon now sinking slow behind the verge of the forest. “It comes\r\nback to me,” she murmured softly,--“the Long ago,--the sweet Long ago!”\r\n\r\nI held my breath to listen.\r\n\r\n“There, there!” she resumed, pointing to the heavens; “do you see?\r\nYou are there, and my father, and--and--Oh! that terrible face, those\r\nserpent eyes, the dead man’s skull! Save me! save me!”\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head upon my bosom, and I led her gently back towards\r\nthe house. As we gained the door which she had left open, the starlight\r\nshining across the shadowy gloom within, she lifted her face from my\r\nbreast, and cast a hurried fearful look round the shining garden, then\r\ninto the dim recess beyond the threshold.\r\n\r\n“It is there--there!--the Shadow that lured me on, whispering that if\r\nI followed it I should join my beloved. False, dreadful Shadow! it will\r\nfade soon,--fade into the grinning horrible skull. Brother, brother,\r\nwhere is my Allen? Is he dead--dead--or is it I who am dead to him?”\r\n\r\nI could but clasp her again to my breast, and seek to mantle\r\nher shivering form with my dripping garments, all the while my\r\neyes--following the direction which hers had taken--dwelt on the walls\r\nof the nook within the threshold, half lost in darkness, half white in\r\nstarlight. And there I, too, beheld the haunting Luminous Shadow, the\r\nspectral effigies of the mysterious being, whose very existence in the\r\nflesh was a riddle unsolved by my reason. Distinctly I saw the Shadow,\r\nbut its light was far paler, its outline far more vague, than when I\r\nhad beheld it before. I took courage, as I felt Lilian’s heart beating\r\nagainst my own. I advanced, I crossed the threshold,--the Shadow was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n“There is no Shadow here,--no phantom to daunt thee, my life’s life,”\r\n said I, bending over Lilian.\r\n\r\n“It has touched me in passing; I feel it--cold, cold, cold!” she\r\nanswered faintly.\r\n\r\nI bore her to her room, placed her on her bed, struck a light, watched\r\nover her. At dawn there was a change in her face, and from that\r\ntime health gradually left her; strength slowly, slowly, yet to me\r\nperceptibly, ebbed from her life away.\r\n\r\n(1) A missile weapon peculiar to the Australian savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nMonths upon months have rolled on since the night in which Lilian had\r\nwatched for my coming amidst the chilling airs--under the haunting moon.\r\nI have said that from the date of that night her health began gradually\r\nto fail, but in her mind there was evidently at work some slow\r\nrevolution. Her visionary abstractions were less frequent; when they\r\noccurred, less prolonged. There was no longer in her soft face that\r\ncelestial serenity which spoke her content in her dreams, but often a\r\nlook of anxiety and trouble. She was even more silent than before; but\r\nwhen she did speak, there were now evident some struggling gleams of\r\nmemory. She startled us, at times, by a distinct allusion to the\r\nevents and scenes of her early childhood. More than once she spoke\r\nof commonplace incidents and mere acquaintances at L----. At last\r\nshe seemed to recognize Mrs. Ashleigh as her mother; but me, as Allen\r\nFenwick, her betrothed, her bridegroom, no! Once or twice she spoke\r\nto me of her beloved as of a stranger to myself, and asked me not to\r\ndeceive her--should she ever see him again? There was one change in\r\nthis new phase of her state that wounded me to the quick. She had\r\nalways previously seemed to welcome my presence; now there were hours,\r\nsometimes days together, in which my presence was evidently painful to\r\nher. She would become agitated when I stole into her room, make signs to\r\nme to leave her, grow yet more disturbed if I did not immediately obey,\r\nand become calm again when I was gone.\r\n\r\nFaber sought constantly to sustain my courage and administer to my hopes\r\nby reminding me of the prediction he had hazarded,--namely, that through\r\nsome malady to the frame the reason would be ultimately restored.\r\n\r\nHe said, “Observe! her mind was first roused from its slumber by the\r\naffectionate, unconquered impulse of her heart. You were absent; the\r\nstorm alarmed her, she missed you,--feared for you. The love within\r\nher, not alienated, though latent, drew her thoughts into definite\r\nhuman tracks. And thus, the words that you tell me she uttered when\r\nyou appeared before her were words of love, stricken, though as yet\r\nirregularly, as the winds strike the harp-strings from chords of\r\nawakened memory. The same unwonted excitement, together with lengthened\r\nexposure to the cold night-air, will account for the shock to her\r\nphysical system, and the languor and waste of strength by which it has\r\nbeen succeeded.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, and the Shadow that we both saw within the threshold. What of\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“Are there no records on evidence, which most physicians of very\r\nextended practice will perhaps allow that their experience more or\r\nless tend to confirm--no records of the singular coincidences between\r\nindividual impressions which are produced by sympathy? Now, whether you\r\nor your Lilian were first haunted by this Shadow I know not. Perhaps\r\nbefore it appeared to you in the wizard’s chamber it had appeared to\r\nher by the Monks’ Well. Perhaps, as it came to you in the prison, so it\r\nlured her through the solitudes, associating its illusory guidance with\r\ndreams of you. And again, when she saw it within your threshold, your\r\nfantasy, so abruptly invoked, made you see with the eyes of your Lilian!\r\nDoes this doctrine of sympathy, though by that very mystery you two\r\nloved each other at first,--though, without it, love at first sight were\r\nin itself an incredible miracle,--does, I say, this doctrine of sympathy\r\nseem to you inadmissible? Then nothing is left for us but to revolve the\r\nconjecture I before threw out. Have certain organizations like that of\r\nMargrave the power to impress, through space, the imaginations of those\r\nover whom they have forced a control? I know not. But if they have, it\r\nis not supernatural; it is but one of those operations in Nature so rare\r\nand exceptional, and of which testimony and evidence are so imperfect\r\nand so liable to superstitious illusions, that they have not yet been\r\ntraced--as, if truthful, no doubt they can be, by the patient genius of\r\nscience--to one of those secondary causes by which the Creator ordains\r\nthat Nature shall act on Man.”\r\n\r\nBy degrees I became dissatisfied with my conversations with Faber. I\r\nyearned for explanations; all guesses but bewildered me more. In his\r\nfamily, with one exception, I found no congenial association. His nephew\r\nseemed to me an ordinary specimen of a very trite human nature,--a young\r\nman of limited ideas, fair moral tendencies, going mechanically right\r\nwhere not tempted to wrong. The same desire of gain which had urged him\r\nto gamble and speculate when thrown in societies rife with such example,\r\nled him, now in the Bush, to healthful, industrious, persevering labour.\r\n“Spes fovet agricolas,” says the poet; the same Hope which entices\r\nthe fish to the hook impels the plough of the husband-man. The\r\nyoung farmer’s young wife was somewhat superior to him; she had more\r\nrefinement of taste, more culture of mind, but, living in his life, she\r\nwas inevitably levelled to his ends and pursuits; and, next to the babe\r\nin the cradle, no object seemed to her so important as that of guarding\r\nthe sheep from the scab and the dingoes. I was amazed to see how quietly\r\na man whose mind was so stored by life and by books as that of Julius\r\nFaber--a man who had loved the clash of conflicting intellects, and\r\nacquired the rewards of fame--could accommodate himself to the cabined\r\nrange of his kinsfolks’ half-civilized existence, take interest in their\r\ntrivial talk, find varying excitement in the monotonous household of a\r\npeasant-like farmer. I could not help saying as much to him once. “My\r\nfriend,” replied the old man, “believe me that the happiest art of\r\nintellect, however lofty, is that which enables it to be cheerfully at\r\nhome with the Real!”\r\n\r\nThe only one of the family in which Faber was domesticated in whom I\r\nfound an interest, to whose talk I could listen without fatigue, was the\r\nchild Amy. Simple though she was in language, patient of labour as the\r\nmost laborious, I recognized in her a quiet nobleness of sentiment,\r\nwhich exalted above the commonplace the acts of her commonplace life.\r\nShe had no precocious intellect, no enthusiastic fancies, but she had an\r\nexquisite activity of heart. It was her heart that animated her sense\r\nof duty, and made duty a sweetness and a joy. She felt to the core\r\nthe kindness of those around her; exaggerated, with the warmth of her\r\ngratitude, the claims which that kindness imposed. Even for the blessing\r\nof life, which she shared with all creation, she felt as if singled\r\nout by the undeserved favour of the Creator, and thus was filled with\r\nreligion, because she was filled with love.\r\n\r\nMy interest in this child was increased and deepened by my saddened and\r\nnot wholly unremorseful remembrance of the night on which her sobs had\r\npierced my ear,--the night from which I secretly dated the mysterious\r\nagencies that had wrenched from their proper field and career both my\r\nmind and my life. But a gentler interest endeared her to my thoughts\r\nin the pleasure that Lilian felt in her visits, in the affectionate\r\nintercourse that sprang up between the afflicted sufferer and the\r\nharmless infant. Often when we failed to comprehend some meaning\r\nwhich Lilian evidently wished to convey to us--we, her mother and her\r\nhusband--she was understood with as much ease by Amy, the unlettered\r\nchild, as by Faber, the gray-haired thinker.\r\n\r\n“How is it,--how is it?” I asked, impatiently and jealously, of Faber.\r\n“Love is said to interpret where wisdom fails, and you yourself talk\r\nof the marvels which sympathy may effect between lover and beloved; yet\r\nwhen, for days together, I cannot succeed in unravelling Lilian’s wish\r\nor her thought--and her own mother is equally in fault--you or\r\nAmy, closeted alone with her for five minutes, comprehend and are\r\ncomprehended.”\r\n\r\n“Allen,” answered Faber, “Amy and I believe in spirit; and she, in whom\r\nmind is dormant but spirit awake, feels in such belief a sympathy which\r\nshe has not, in that respect, with yourself, nor even with her mother.\r\nYou seek only through your mind to conjecture hers. Her mother has sense\r\nclear enough where habitual experience can guide it, but that sense is\r\nconfused, and forsakes her when forced from the regular pathway in which\r\nit has been accustomed to tread. Amy and I through soul guess at soul,\r\nand though mostly contented with earth, we can both rise at times into\r\nheaven. We pray.”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said I, half mournfully, half angrily, “when you thus speak of\r\nMind as distinct from Soul, it was only in that Vision which you bid\r\nme regard as the illusion of a fancy stimulated by chemical vapours,\r\nproducing on the brain an effect similar to that of opium or the\r\ninhalation of the oxide gas, that I have ever seen the silver spark of\r\nthe Soul distinct from the light of the Mind. And holding, as I do, that\r\nall intellectual ideas are derived from the experiences of the body,\r\nwhether I accept the theory of Locke, or that of Condillac, or that into\r\nwhich their propositions reach their final development in the wonderful\r\nsubtlety of Hume, I cannot detect the immaterial spirit in the material\r\nsubstance,--much less follow its escape from the organic matter in which\r\nthe principle of thought ceases with the principle of life. When the\r\nmetaphysician, contending for the immortality of the thinking faculty,\r\nanalyzes Mind, his analysis comprehends the mind of the brute, nay, of\r\nthe insect, as well as that of man. Take Reid’s definition of Mind, as\r\nthe most comprehensive which I can at the moment remember: ‘By the mind\r\nof a man we understand that in him which thinks, remembers, reasons, and\r\nwills.(1) But this definition only distinguishes the mind of man from\r\nthat of the brute by superiority in the same attributes, and not by\r\nattributes denied to the brute. An animal, even an insect, thinks,\r\nremembers, reasons, and wills.(1) Few naturalists will now support the\r\ndoctrine that all the mental operations of brute or insect are to\r\nbe exclusively referred to instincts; and, even if they do, the word\r\n‘instinct’ is a very vague word,--loose and large enough to cover an\r\nabyss which our knowledge has not sounded. And, indeed, in proportion as\r\nan animal like the dog becomes cultivated by intercourse, his instincts\r\ngrow weaker, and his ideas formed by experience (namely, his mind), more\r\ndeveloped, often to the conquest of the instincts themselves. Hence,\r\nwith his usual candour, Dr. Abercrombie--in contending ‘that everything\r\nmental ceases to exist after death, when we know that everything\r\ncorporeal continues to exist, is a gratuitous assumption contrary to\r\nevery rule of philosophical inquiry’--feels compelled, by his reasoning,\r\nto admit the probability of a future life even to the lower animals.\r\nHis words are: ‘To this anode of reasoning it has been objected that it\r\nwould go to establish an immaterial principle in the lower animals which\r\nin them exhibits many of the phenomena of mind. I have only to answer,\r\nBe it so. There are in the lower animals many of the phenomena of\r\nmind, and with regard to these, we also contend that they are entirely\r\ndistinct from anything we know of the properties of matter, which is all\r\nthat we mean, or can mean, by being immaterial.’(2) Am I then driven to\r\nadmit that if man’s mind is immaterial and imperishable, so also is that\r\nof the ape and the ant?”\r\n\r\n“I own,” said Faber, with his peculiar smile, arch and genial, “that if\r\nI were compelled to make that admission, it would not shock my pride.\r\nI do not presume to set any limit to the goodness of the Creator; and\r\nshould be as humbly pleased as the Indian, if in--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “‘yonder sky,\r\n    My faithful dog should bear me company.’\r\n\r\n“You are too familiar with the works of that Titan in wisdom and error,\r\nDescartes, not to recollect the interesting correspondence between the\r\nurbane philosopher and our combative countryman, Henry More,(3) on this\r\nvery subject; in which certainly More has the best of it when Descartes\r\ninsists on reducing what he calls the soul (l’ame) of brutes into the\r\nsame kind of machines as man constructs from inorganized matter. The\r\nlearning, indeed, lavished on the insoluble question involved in\r\nthe psychology of the inferior animals is a proof at least of the\r\nall-inquisitive, redundant spirit of man.(4) We have almost a literature\r\nin itself devoted to endeavours to interpret the language of brutes.(5)\r\nDupont de Nemours has discovered that dogs talk in vowels, using only\r\ntwo consonants, G, Z, when they are angry. He asserts that cats\r\nemploy the same vowels as dogs; but their language is more affluent in\r\nconsonants, including M, N, B, R, V, F. How many laborious efforts have\r\nbeen made to define and to construe the song of the nightingale! One\r\nversion of that song, by Beckstein, the naturalist, published in 1840,\r\nI remember to have seen. And I heard a lady, gifted with a singularly\r\ncharming voice, chant the mysterious vowels with so exquisite a pathos,\r\nthat one could not refuse to believe her when she declared that she\r\nfully comprehended the bird’s meaning, and gave to the nightingale’s\r\nwarble the tender interpretation of her own woman’s heart.\r\n\r\n“But leaving all such discussions to their proper place amongst the\r\nCuriosities of Literature, I come in earnest to the question you have\r\nso earnestly raised; and to me the distinction between man and the\r\nlower animals in reference to a spiritual nature designed for a future\r\nexistence, and the mental operations whose uses are bounded to an\r\nexistence on earth, seems ineffaceably clear. Whether ideas or even\r\nperceptions be innate or all formed by experience is a speculation\r\nfor metaphysicians, which, so far as it affects the question of as\r\nimmaterial principle, I am quite willing to lay aside. I can well\r\nunderstand that a materialist may admit innate ideas in Man, as he\r\nmust admit them in the instinct of brutes, tracing them to hereditary\r\npredispositions. On the other hand, we know that the most devout\r\nbelievers in our spiritual nature have insisted, with Locke, in denying\r\nany idea, even of the Deity, to be innate.\r\n\r\n“But here comes my argument. I care not how ideas are formed,--the\r\nmaterial point is, how are the capacities to receive ideas formed? The\r\nideas may all come from experience, but the capacity to receive the\r\nideas must be inherent. I take the word ‘capacity’ as a good plain\r\nEnglish word, rather than the more technical word ‘receptivity,’\r\nemployed by Kant. And by capacity I mean the passive power(6) to\r\nreceive ideas, whether in man or in any living thing by which ideas\r\nare received. A man and an elephant is each formed with capacities to\r\nreceive ideas suited to the several places in the universe held by each.\r\n\r\n“The more I look through Nature the more I find that on all varieties\r\nof organized life is carefully bestowed the capacity to receive the\r\nimpressions, be they called perceptions or ideas, which are adapted to\r\nthe uses each creature is intended to derive from them. I find, then,\r\nthat Man alone is endowed with the capacity to receive the ideas of\r\na God, of Soul, of Worship, of a Hereafter. I see no trace of such a\r\ncapacity in the inferior races; nor, however their intelligence may be\r\nrefined by culture, is such capacity ever apparent in them.\r\n\r\n“But wherever capacities to receive impressions are sufficiently general\r\nin any given species of creature to be called universal to that species,\r\nand yet not given to another species, then, from all analogy throughout\r\nNature, those capacities are surely designed by Providence for the\r\ndistinct use and conservation of the species to which they are given.\r\n\r\n“It is no answer to me to say that the inherent capacities thus bestowed\r\non Man do not suffice in themselves to make him form right notions of\r\na Deity or a Hereafter; because it is plainly the design of Providence\r\nthat Man must learn to correct and improve all his notions by his\r\nown study and observation. He must build a hut before he can build a\r\nParthenon; he must believe with the savage or the heathen before he\r\ncan believe with the philosopher or Christian. In a word, in all his\r\ncapacities, Man has only given to him, not the immediate knowledge of\r\nthe Perfect, but the means to strive towards the Perfect. And thus one\r\nof the most accomplished of modern reasoners, to whose lectures you must\r\nhave listened with delight, in your college days, says well:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “‘Accordingly the sciences always studied with keenest interest are\r\n     those in a state of progress and uncertainty; absolute certainty and\r\n     absolute completion would be the paralysis of any study, and the last\r\n     worst calamity that could befall Man, as he is at present\r\n     constituted, would be that full and final possession of speculative\r\n     truth which he now vainly anticipates as the consummation of his\r\n     intellectual happiness.’(7)\r\n\r\n“Well, then, in all those capacities for the reception of impressions\r\nfrom external Nature which are given to Man and not to the brutes, I see\r\nthe evidence of Man’s Soul. I can understand why the inferior animal\r\nhas no capacity to receive the idea of a Deity and of Worship--simply\r\nbecause the inferior animal, even if graciously admitted to a future\r\nlife, may not therein preserve the sense of its identity. I can\r\nunderstand even why that sympathy with each other which we men possess\r\nand which constitutes the great virtue we emphatically call Humanity,\r\nis not possessed by the lesser animals (or, at least, in a very rare and\r\nexceptional degree) even where they live in communities, like beavers,\r\nor bees, or ants; because men are destined to meet, to know, and to love\r\neach other in the life to come, and the bond between the brute ceases\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n“Now the more, then, we examine the inherent capacities bestowed\r\ndistinctly and solely on Man, the more they seem to distinguish him from\r\nthe other races by their comprehension of objects beyond his life upon\r\nthis earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “‘Man alone,’ says Muller, ‘can conceive abstract notions; and it is in\r\n     abstract notions--such as time, space, matter, spirit, light, form,\r\n     quantity, essence--that man grounds, not only all philosophy, all\r\n     science, but all that practically improves one generation for the\r\n     benefit of the next.’\r\n\r\n“And why? Because all these abstract notions unconsciously lead the mind\r\naway from the material into the immaterial,--from the present into the\r\nfuture. But if Man ceases to exist when he disappears in the grave, you\r\nmust be compelled to affirm that he is the only creature in existence\r\nwhom Nature or Providence has condescended to deceive and cheat by\r\ncapacities for which there are no available objects. How nobly and how\r\ntruly has Chalmers said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “‘What inference shall we draw from this remarkable law in Nature that\r\n     there is nothing waste and nothing meaningless in the feelings and\r\n     faculties wherewith living creatures are endowed?  For each desire\r\n     there is a counterpart object; for each faculty there is room and\r\n     opportunity for exercise either in the present or the coming\r\n     futurity.  Now, but for the doctrine of immortality, Man would be an\r\n     exception to this law,-he would stand forth as an anomaly in Nature,\r\n     with aspirations in his heart for which the universe had no antitype\r\n     to offer, with capacities of understanding and thought that never\r\n     were to be followed by objects of corresponding greatness through the\r\n     whole history of his being!\r\n\r\n              ............\r\n\r\n   “‘With the inferior animals there is a certain squareness of\r\n     adjustment, if we may so term it, between each desire and its\r\n     correspondent gratification.  The one is evenly met by the other, and\r\n     there is a fulness and definiteness of enjoyment up to the capacity\r\n     of enjoyment.  Not so with Man, who, both from the vastness of his\r\n     propensities and the vastness of his powers, feels himself chained\r\n     and beset in a field too narrow for him.  He alone labours under the\r\n     discomfort of an incongruity between his circumstances and his\r\n     powers; and unless there be new circumstances awaiting him in a more\r\n     advanced state of being, he, the noblest of Nature’s products here,\r\n     would turn out to be the greatest of her failures.’(8)\r\n\r\n“This, then, I take to be the proof of Soul in Man, not that he has a\r\nmind--because, as you justly say, inferior animals have that, though\r\nin a lesser degree--but because he has the capacities to comprehend, as\r\nsoon as he is capable of any abstract ideas whatsoever, the very truths\r\nnot needed for self-conservation on earth, and therefore not given to\r\nyonder ox and opossum,--namely, the nature of Deity, Soul, Hereafter.\r\nAnd in the recognition of these truths, the Human society, that excels\r\nthe society of beavers, bees, and ants, by perpetual and progressive\r\nimprovement on the notions inherited from its progenitors, rests its\r\nbasis. Thus, in fact, this world is benefited for men by their belief\r\nin the next, while the society of brutes remains age after age the same.\r\nNeither the bee nor the beaver has, in all probability, improved since\r\nthe Deluge.\r\n\r\n“But inseparable from the conviction of these truths is the impulse of\r\nprayer and worship. It does not touch my argument when a philosopher of\r\nthe school of Bolingbroke or Lucretius says, ‘that the origin of prayer\r\nis in Man’s ignorance of the phenomena of Nature.’ That it is fear or\r\nignorance which, ‘when rocked the mountains or when groaned the ground,\r\ntaught the weak to bend, the proud to pray.’ My answer is, the brutes\r\nare much more forcibly impressed by natural phenomena than Man is; the\r\nbird and the beast know before you and I do when the mountain will rock\r\nand the ground groan, and their instinct leads them to shelter; but it\r\ndoes not lead them to prayer. If my theory be right that Soul is to be\r\nsought not in the question whether mental ideas be innate or formed by\r\nexperience, by the sense, by association or habit, but in the inherent\r\ncapacity to receive ideas, then, the capacity bestowed on Man alone,\r\nto be impressed by Nature herself with the idea of a Power superior to\r\nNature, with which Power he can establish commune, is a proof that to\r\nMan alone the Maker has made Nature itself proclaim His existence,--that\r\nto Man alone the Deity vouchsafes the communion with Himself which comes\r\nfrom prayer.”\r\n\r\n“Even were this so,” said I, “is not the Creator omniscient? If\r\nall-wise, all-foreseeing? If all-foreseeing, all-pre-ordaining? Can the\r\nprayer of His creature alter the ways of His will?”\r\n\r\n“For the answer to a question,” returned Faber, “which is not\r\nunfrequently asked by the clever men of the world, I ought to refer you\r\nto the skilled theologians who have so triumphantly carried the reasoner\r\nover that ford of doubt which is crossed every day by the infant. But\r\nas we have not their books in the wilderness, I am contented to draw my\r\nreply as a necessary and logical sequence from the propositions I have\r\nsought to ground on the plain observation of Nature. I can only guess\r\nat the Deity’s Omniscience, or His modes of enforcing His power by the\r\nobservation of His general laws; and of all His laws, I know of none\r\nmore general than the impulse which bids men pray,--which makes Nature\r\nso act, that all the phenomena of Nature we can conceive, however\r\nstartling and inexperienced, do not make the brute pray, but there\r\nis not a trouble that can happen to Man, but what his impulse is to\r\npray,--always provided, indeed, that he is not a philosopher. I say not\r\nthis in scorn of the philosopher, to whose wildest guess our obligations\r\nare infinite, but simply because for all which is impulsive to Man,\r\nthere is a reason in Nature which no philosophy can explain away. I do\r\nnot, then, bewilder myself by seeking to bind and limit the Omniscience\r\nof the Deity to my finite ideas. I content myself with supposing that\r\nsomehow or other, He has made it quite compatible with His Omniscience\r\nthat Man should obey the impulse which leads him to believe that, in\r\naddressing a Deity, he is addressing a tender, compassionate, benignant\r\nFather, and in that obedience shall obtain beneficial results. If that\r\nimpulse be an illusion, then we must say that Heaven governs the earth\r\nby a lie; and that is impossible, because, reasoning by analogy, all\r\nNature is truthful,--that is, Nature gives to no species instincts\r\nor impulses which are not of service to it. Should I not be a shallow\r\nphysician if, where I find in the human organization a principle or\r\na property so general that I must believe it normal to the healthful\r\nconditions of that organization, I should refuse to admit that Nature\r\nintended it for use? Reasoning by all analogy, must I not say the\r\nhabitual neglect of its use must more or less injure the harmonious\r\nwell-being of the whole human system? I could have much to add upon\r\nthe point in dispute by which the creed implied in your question would\r\nenthrall the Divine mercy by the necessities of its Divine wisdom, and\r\nsubstitute for a benignant Deity a relentless Fate. But here I should\r\nexceed my province. I am no theologian. Enough for me that in all\r\nmy afflictions, all my perplexities, an impulse, that I obey as an\r\ninstinct, moves me at once to prayer. Do I find by experience that the\r\nprayer is heard, that the affliction is removed, the doubt is solved?\r\nThat, indeed, would be presumptuous to say. But it is not presumptuous\r\nto think that by the efficacy of prayer my heart becomes more fortified\r\nagainst the sorrow, and my reason more serene amidst the doubt.”\r\n\r\nI listened, and ceased to argue. I felt as if in that solitude, and\r\nin the pause of my wonted mental occupations, my intellect was growing\r\nlanguid, and its old weapons rusting in disuse. My pride took alarm. I\r\nhad so from my boyhood cherished the idea of fame, and so glorified the\r\nsearch after knowledge, that I recoiled in dismay from the thought that\r\nI had relinquished knowledge, and cut myself off from fame. I resolved\r\nto resume my once favourite philosophical pursuits, re-examine and\r\ncomplete the Work to which I had once committed my hopes of renown; and,\r\nsimultaneously, a restless desire seized me to communicate, though but\r\nat brief intervals, with other minds than those immediately within my\r\nreach,--minds fresh from the old world, and reviving the memories of\r\nits vivid civilization. Emigrants frequently passed my doors, but I had\r\nhitherto shrunk from tendering the hospitalities so universally accorded\r\nin the colony. I could not endure to expose to such rough strangers my\r\nLilian’s mournful affliction, and that thought was not less intolerable\r\nto Mrs. Ashleigh. I now hastily constructed a log-building a few hundred\r\nyards from the house, and near the main track taken by travellers\r\nthrough the spacious pastures. I transported to this building my books\r\nand scientific instruments. In an upper story I placed my telescopes and\r\nlenses, my crucibles and retorts. I renewed my chemical experiments; I\r\nsought to invigorate my mind by other branches of science which I had\r\nhitherto less cultured,--meditated new theories on Light and Colour,\r\ncollected specimens in Natural History, subjected animalcules to my\r\nmicroscope, geological fossils to my hammer. With all these quickened\r\noccupations of thought, I strove to distract myself from sorrow, and\r\nstrengthen my reason against the illusion of my fantasy. The Luminous\r\nShadow was not seen again on my wall, and the thought of Margrave\r\nhimself was banished.\r\n\r\nIn this building I passed many hours of each day; more and more\r\nearnestly plunging my thoughts into depths of abstract study, as\r\nLilian’s unaccountable dislike to my presence became more and more\r\ndecided. When I thus ceased to think that my life cheered and comforted\r\nhers, my heart’s occupation was gone. I had annexed to the apartment\r\nreserved for myself in the log-hut a couple of spare rooms, in which I\r\ncould accommodate passing strangers. I learned to look forward to their\r\ncoming with interest, and to see them depart with regret; yet, for\r\nthe most part, they were of the ordinary class of colonial\r\nadventurers,--bankrupt tradesmen, unlucky farmers, forlorn mechanics,\r\nhordes of unskilled labourers, now and then a briefless barrister, or a\r\nsporting collegian who had lost his all on the Derby. One day, however,\r\na young man of education and manners that unmistakably proclaimed the\r\ncultured gentleman of Europe, stopped at my door. He was a cadet of\r\na noble Prussian family, which for some political reasons had settled\r\nitself in Paris; there he had become intimate with young French nobles,\r\nand living the life of a young French noble had soon scandalized his\r\nGerman parents, forestalled his slender inheritance, and been compelled\r\nto fly his father’s frown and his tailor’s bills. All this he told me\r\nwith a lively frankness which proved how much the wit of a German can\r\nbe quickened in the atmosphere of Paris. An old college friend, of birth\r\ninferior to his own, had been as unfortunate in seeking to make money as\r\nthis young prodigal had been an adept in spending it. The friend, a\r\nfew years previously, had accompanied other Germans in a migration to\r\nAustralia, and was already thriving; the spendthrift noble was on his\r\nway to join the bankrupt trader, at a German settlement fifty miles\r\ndistant from my house. This young man was unlike any German I ever met.\r\nHe had all the exquisite levity by which the well-bred Frenchman gives\r\nto the doctrines of the Cynic the grace of the Epicurean. He owned\r\nhimself to be good for nothing with an elegance of candour which not\r\nonly disarmed censure, but seemed to challenge admiration; and, withal,\r\nthe happy spendthrift was so inebriate with hope,--sure that he should\r\nbe rich before he was thirty. How and wherefore rich, he could have\r\nno more explained than I can square the circle. When the grand serious\r\nGerman nature does Frenchify itself, it can become so extravagantly\r\nFrench!\r\n\r\nI listened, almost enviously, to this light-hearted profligate’s babble,\r\nas we sat by my rude fireside,--I, sombre man of science and sorrow,\r\nhe, smiling child of idleness and pleasure, so much one of Nature’s\r\ncourtier-like nobles, that there, as he smoked his villanous pipe, in\r\nhis dust-soiled shabby garments, and with his ruffianly revolver stuck\r\ninto his belt, I would defy the daintiest Aristarch who ever presided as\r\ncritic over the holiday world not to have said, “There smiles the\r\ngenius beyond my laws, the born darling of the Graces, who in every\r\ncircumstance, in every age, like Aristippus, would have socially\r\ncharmed; would have been welcome to the orgies of a Caesar or a Clodius,\r\nto the boudoirs of a Montespan or a Pompadour; have lounged through the\r\nMulberry Gardens with a Rochester and a Buckingham, or smiled from the\r\ndeath-cart, with a Richelieu and a Lauzun, a gentleman’s disdain of a\r\nmob!”\r\n\r\nI was so thinking as we sat, his light talk frothing up from his\r\ncareless lips, when suddenly from the spray and the sparkle of that\r\nlight talk was flung forth the name of Margrave.\r\n\r\n“Margrave!” I exclaimed. “Pardon me. What of him?”\r\n\r\n“What of him! I asked if, by chance, you knew the only Englishman I ever\r\nhad the meanness to envy?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you speak of one person, and I thought of another.”\r\n\r\n“Pardieu, my dear host, there can scarcely be two Margraves! The one of\r\nwhom I speak flashed like a meteor upon Paris, bought from a prince of\r\nthe Bourse a palace that might have lodged a prince of the blood-royal,\r\neclipsed our Jew bankers in splendour, our jeunesse doree in good looks\r\nand hair-brain adventures, and, strangest of all, filled his salons with\r\nphilosophers and charlatans, chemists and spirit-rappers; insulting the\r\ngravest dons of the schools by bringing them face to face with the most\r\nimpudent quacks, the most ridiculous dreamers,--and yet, withal, himself\r\nso racy and charming, so bon prince, so bon enfant! For six months he\r\nwas the rage at Paris: perhaps he might have continued to be the rage\r\nthere for six years, but all at once the meteor vanished as suddenly as\r\nit had flashed. Is this the Margrave whom you know?”\r\n\r\n“I should not have thought the Margrave whom I knew could have\r\nreconciled his tastes to the life of cities.”\r\n\r\n“Nor could this man: cities were too tame for him. He has gone to some\r\nfar-remote wilds in the East,--some say in search of the Philosopher’s\r\nStone; for he actually maintained in his house a Sicilian adventurer,\r\nwho, when at work on that famous discovery, was stifled by the fumes of\r\nhis own crucible. After that misfortune, Margrave took Paris in disgust,\r\nand we lost him.”\r\n\r\n“So this is the only Englishman whom you envy! Envy him? Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because he is the only Englishman I ever met who contrived to be rich\r\nand yet free from the spleen; I envied him because one had only to look\r\nat his face and see how thoroughly he enjoyed the life of which your\r\ncountrymen seem to be so heartily tired. But now that I have satisfied\r\nyour curiosity, pray satisfy mine. Who and what is this Englishman?”\r\n\r\n“Who and what was he supposed at Paris to be?”\r\n\r\n“Conjectures were numberless. One of your countrymen suggested that\r\nwhich was the most generally favoured. This gentleman, whose name I\r\nforget, but who was one of those old roues who fancy themselves young\r\nbecause they live with the young, no sooner set eyes upon Margrave, than\r\nhe exclaimed, ‘Louis Grayle come to life again, as I saw him forty-four\r\nyears ago! But no--still younger, still handsomer--it must be his son!”\r\n\r\n“Louis Grayle, who was said to be murdered at Aleppo?”\r\n\r\n“The same. That strange old man was enormously rich; but it seems that\r\nhe hated his lawful heirs, and left behind him a fortune so far below\r\nthat which he was known to possess that he must certainly have disposed\r\nof it secretly before his death. Why so dispose of it, if not to enrich\r\nsome natural son, whom, for private reasons, he might not have wished\r\nto acknowledge, or point out to the world by the signal bequest of\r\nhis will? All that Margrave ever said of himself and the source of his\r\nwealth confirmed this belief. He frankly proclaimed himself a natural\r\nson, enriched by a father whose name he knew not nor cared to know.”\r\n\r\n“It is true. And Margrave quitted Paris for the East. When?”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you the date within a day or two, for his flight preceded\r\nmine by a week; and, happily, all Paris was so busy in talking of it,\r\nthat I slipped away without notice.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Prussian then named a date which it thrilled me to hear, for\r\nit was in that very month, and about that very day, that the Luminous\r\nShadow had stood within my threshold.\r\n\r\nThe young count now struck off into other subjects of talk: nothing more\r\nwas said of Margrave. An hour or two afterwards he went on his way, and\r\nI remained long gazing musingly on the embers of the dying glow on my\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\n(1) “Are intelligence and instinct, thus differing in their relative\r\nproportion in man as compared with all other animals, yet the same in\r\nkind and manner of operation in both? To this question we must give\r\nat once an affirmative answer. The expression of Cuvier, regarding the\r\nfaculty of reasoning in lower animals, ‘Leur intelligence execute des\r\noperations du meme genre,’ is true in its full sense. We can in no\r\nmanner define reason so as to exclude acts which are at every moment\r\npresent to our observation, and which we find in many instances to\r\ncontravene the natural instincts of the species. The demeanour and acts\r\nof the dog in reference to his master, or the various uses to which\r\nhe is put by man, are as strictly logical as those we witness in the\r\nordinary transactions of life.”--Sir Henry Holland, chapters on “Mental\r\nPhysiology,” p. 220.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the chapter on Instincts and Habits in this work should\r\nbe read in connection with the passage just quoted.

Perhaps I\r\nshould observe, that here and elsewhere in the dialogues between Faber\r\nand Fenwick, it has generally been thought better to substitute the\r\nwords of the author quoted for the mere outline or purport of the\r\nquotation which memory afforded to the interlocutor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nMy Work, my Philosophical Work--the ambitious hope of my intellectual\r\nlife--how eagerly I returned to it again! Far away from my household\r\ngrief, far away from my haggard perplexities--neither a Lilian nor a\r\nMargrave there!\r\n\r\nAs I went over what I had before written, each link in its chain of\r\nreasoning seemed so serried, that to alter one were to derange all; and\r\nthe whole reasoning was so opposed to the possibility of the wonders I\r\nmyself had experienced, so hostile to the subtle hypotheses of a Faber,\r\nor the childlike belief of an Amy, that I must have destroyed the entire\r\nwork if I had admitted such contradictions to its design!\r\n\r\nBut the work was I myself!--I, in my solid, sober, healthful mind,\r\nbefore the brain had been perplexed by a phantom. Were phantoms to be\r\nallowed as testimonies against science? No; in returning to my Book, I\r\nreturned to my former Me!\r\n\r\nHow strange is that contradiction between our being as man and our being\r\nas Author! Take any writer enamoured of a system: a thousand things may\r\nhappen to him every day which might shake his faith in that system;\r\nand while he moves about as mere man, his faith is shaken. But when he\r\nsettles himself back into the phase of his being as author, the mere act\r\nof taking pen in hand and smoothing the paper before him restores his\r\nspeculations to their ancient mechanical train. The system, the beloved\r\nsystem, reasserts its tyrannic sway, and he either ignores, or moulds\r\ninto fresh proofs of his theory as author, all which, an hour before,\r\nhad given his theory the lie in his living perceptions as man.\r\n\r\nI adhered to my system,--I continued my work. Here, in the barbarous\r\ndesert, was a link between me and the Cities of Europe. All else might\r\nbreak down under me. The love I had dreamed of was blotted out from the\r\nworld, and might never be restored; my heart might be lonely, my life be\r\nan exile’s. My reason might, at last, give way before the spectres which\r\nawed my senses, or the sorrow which stormed my heart. But here at least\r\nwas a monument of my rational thoughtful Me,--of my individualized\r\nidentity in multiform creation. And my mind, in the noon of its force,\r\nwould shed its light on the earth when my form was resolved to its\r\nelements. Alas! in this very yearning for the Hereafter, though but the\r\nHereafter of a Name, could I see only the craving of Mind, and hear not\r\nthe whisper of Soul!\r\n\r\nThe avocation of a colonist, usually so active, had little interest for\r\nme. This vast territorial lordship, in which, could I have endeared its\r\npossession by the hopes that animate a Founder, I should have felt all\r\nthe zest and the pride of ownership, was but the run of a common to the\r\npassing emigrant, who would leave no son to inherit the tardy products\r\nof his labour. I was not goaded to industry by the stimulus of need.\r\nI could only be ruined if I risked all my capital in the attempt to\r\nimprove. I lived, therefore, amongst my fertile pastures, as careless of\r\nculture as the English occupant of the Highland moor, which he rents for\r\nthe range of its solitudes.\r\n\r\nI knew, indeed, that if ever I became avaricious, I might swell my\r\nmodest affluence into absolute wealth. I had revisited the spot in which\r\nI had discovered the nugget of gold, and had found the precious metal\r\nin rich abundance just under the first coverings of the alluvial soil.\r\nI concealed my discovery from all. I knew that, did I proclaim it, the\r\ncharm of my bush-life would be gone. My fields would be infested by all\r\nthe wild adventurers who gather to gold as the vultures of prey round\r\na carcass; my servants would desert me, my very flocks would be\r\nshepherdless!\r\n\r\nMonths again rolled on months. I had just approached the close of my\r\nbeloved Work, when it was again suspended, and by an anguish keener than\r\nall which I had previously known.\r\n\r\nLilian became alarmingly ill. Her state of health, long gradually\r\ndeclining, had hitherto admitted checkered intervals of improvement, and\r\nexhibited no symptoms of actual danger. But now she was seized with a\r\nkind of chronic fever, attended with absolute privation of sleep,\r\nan aversion to even the lightest nourishment, and an acute nervous\r\nsusceptibility to all the outward impressions of which she had long\r\nseemed so unconscious; morbidly alive to the faintest sound, shrinking\r\nfrom the light as from a torture. Her previous impatience at my entrance\r\ninto her room became aggravated into vehement emotions, convulsive\r\nparoxysms of distress; so that Faber banished me from her chamber, and,\r\nwith a heart bleeding at every fibre, I submitted to the cruel sentence.\r\n\r\nFaber had taken up his abode in my house and brought Amy with him; one\r\nor the other never left Lilian, night or day. The great physician spoke\r\ndoubtfully of the case, but not despairingly.\r\n\r\n“Remember,” he said, “that in spite of the want of sleep, the abstinence\r\nfrom food, the form has not wasted as it would do were this fever\r\ninevitably mortal. It is upon that phenomenon I build a hope that I have\r\nnot been mistaken in the opinion I hazarded from the first. We are now\r\nin the midst of the critical struggle between life and reason; if she\r\npreserve the one, my conviction is that she will regain the other.\r\nThat seeming antipathy to yourself is a good omen. You are inseparably\r\nassociated with her intellectual world; in proportion as she revives to\r\nit, must become vivid and powerful the reminiscences of the shock that\r\nannulled, for a time, that world to her. So I welcome, rather than fear,\r\nthe over-susceptibility of the awakening senses to external sights\r\nand sounds. A few days will decide if I am right. In this climate the\r\nprogress of acute maladies is swift, but the recovery from them is yet\r\nmore startlingly rapid. Wait, endure, be prepared to submit to the will\r\nof Heaven; but do not despond of its mercy.”\r\n\r\nI rushed away from the consoler,--away into the thick of the forests,\r\nthe heart of the solitude. All around me, there, was joyous with life;\r\nthe locust sang amidst the herbage; the cranes gambolled on the banks of\r\nthe creek; the squirrel-like opossums frolicked on the feathery boughs.\r\n“And what,” said I to myself,--“what if that which seems so fabulous in\r\nthe distant being whose existence has bewitched my own, be substantially\r\ntrue? What if to some potent medicament Margrave owes his glorious\r\nvitality, his radiant youth? Oh, that I had not so disdainfully turned\r\naway from his hinted solicitations--to what?--to nothing guiltier\r\nthan lawful experiment. Had I been less devoted a bigot to this vain\r\nschoolcraft, which we call the Medical Art, and which, alone in this\r\nage of science, has made no perceptible progress since the days of\r\nits earliest teachers--had I said, in the true humility of genuine\r\nknowledge, ‘these alchemists were men of genius and thought; we owe to\r\nthem nearly all the grand hints of our chemical science,--is it likely\r\nthat they would have been wholly drivellers and idiots in the one faith\r\nthey clung to the most?’--had I said that, I might now have no fear\r\nof losing my Lilian. Why, after all, should there not be in Nature one\r\nprimary essence, one master substance; in which is stored the specific\r\nnutriment of life?”\r\n\r\nThus incoherently muttering to the woods what my pride of reason would\r\nnot have suffered me gravely to say to my fellow-men, I fatigued my\r\ntormented spirits into a gloomy calm, and mechanically retraced my\r\nsteps at the decline of day. I seated myself at the door of my solitary\r\nlog-hut, lean ing my cheek upon my hand, and musing. Wearily I looked\r\nup, roused by a discord of clattering hoofs and lumbering wheels on the\r\nhollow-sounding grass-track. A crazy groaning vehicle, drawn by four\r\nhorses, emerged from the copse of gum-trees,--fast, fast along the road,\r\nwhich no such pompous vehicle had traversed since that which had\r\nborne me--luxurious satrap for an early colonist--to my lodge in the\r\nwilderness. What emigrant rich enough to squander in the hire of such\r\nan equipage more than its cost in England, could thus be entering on my\r\nwaste domain? An ominous thrill shot through me.\r\n\r\nThe driver--perhaps some broken-down son of luxury in the Old World, fit\r\nfor nothing in the New World but to ply, for hire, the task that might\r\nhave led to his ruin when plied in sport--stopped at the door of my hut,\r\nand called out, “Friend, is not this the great Fenwick Section, and is\r\nnot yonder long pile of building the Master’s house?”\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer I heard a faint voice, within the vehicle,\r\nspeaking to the driver; the last nodded, descended from his seat, opened\r\nthe carriage-door, and offered his arm to a man, who, waving aside the\r\nproffered aid, descended slowly and feebly; paused a moment as if for\r\nbreath, and then, leaning on his staff, walked from the road, across\r\nthe sward rank with luxuriant herbage, through the little gate in the\r\nnew-set fragrant wattle-fence, wearily, languidly, halting often, till\r\nhe stood facing me, leaning both wan and emaciated hands upon his staff,\r\nand his meagre form shrinking deep within the folds of a cloak lined\r\nthick with costly sables. His face was sharp, his complexion of a\r\nlivid yellow, his eyes shone out from their hollow orbits, unnaturally\r\nenlarged and fatally bright. Thus, in ghastly contrast to his former\r\nsplendour of youth and opulence of life, Margrave stood before me.\r\n\r\n“I come to you,” said Margrave, in accents hoarse and broken, “from the\r\nshores of the East. Give me shelter and rest. I have that to say which\r\nwill more than repay you.”\r\n\r\nWhatever, till that moment, my hate and my fear of this unexpected\r\nvisitant, hate would have been inhumanity, fear a meanness, conceived\r\nfor a creature so awfully stricken down.\r\n\r\nSilently, involuntarily, I led him into the house. There he rested a few\r\nminutes, with closed eyes and painful gasps for breath. Meanwhile, the\r\ndriver brought from the carriage a travelling-bag and a small wooden\r\nchest or coffer, strongly banded with iron clamps. Margrave, looking up\r\nas the man drew near, exclaimed fiercely, “Who told you to touch\r\nthat chest? How dare you? Take it from that man, Fenwick! Place it\r\nhere,--here by my side!”\r\n\r\nI took the chest from the driver, whose rising anger at being so\r\nimperiously rated in the land of democratic equality was appeased by the\r\ngold which Margrave lavishly flung to him.\r\n\r\n“Take care of the poor gentleman, squire,” he whispered to me, in the\r\nspontaneous impulse of gratitude, “I fear he will not trouble you long.\r\nHe must be monstrous rich. Arrived in a vessel hired all to himself, and\r\na train of outlandish attendants, whom he has left behind in the town\r\nyonder. May I bait my horses in your stables? They have come a long\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nI pointed to the neighbouring stables, and the man nodded his thanks,\r\nremounted his box, and drove off.\r\n\r\nI returned to Margrave. A faint smile came to his lips as I placed the\r\nchest beside him.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay,” he muttered. “Safe! safe! I shall soon be well again,--very\r\nsoon! And now I can sleep in peace!”\r\n\r\nI led him into an inner room, in which there was a bed. He threw himself\r\non it with a loud sigh of relief. Soon, half raising himself on his\r\nelbow, he exclaimed, “The chest--bring it hither! I need it always\r\nbeside me! There, there! Now for a few hours of sleep; and then, if I\r\ncan take food, or some such restoring cordial as your skill may suggest,\r\nI shall be strong enough to talk. We will talk! we will talk!”\r\n\r\nHis eyes closed heavily as his voice fell into a drowsy mutter: a moment\r\nmore and he was asleep.\r\n\r\nI watched beside him, in mingled wonder and compassion. Looking into\r\nthat face, so altered yet still so young, I could not sternly question\r\nwhat had been the evil of that mystic life, which seemed now oozing away\r\nthrough the last sands in the hour-glass. I placed my hand softly on his\r\npulse: it scarcely beat. I put my ear to his breast, and involuntarily\r\nsighed, as I distinguished in its fluttering heave that dull, dumb\r\nsound, in which the heart seems knelling itself to the greedy grave!\r\n\r\nWas this, indeed, the potent magician whom I had so feared!--this the\r\nguide to the Rosicrucian’s secret of life’s renewal, in whom, but an\r\nhour or two ago, my fancies gulled my credulous trust!\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, even while thus chiding my wild superstitions, a fear,\r\nthat to most would seem scarcely less superstitious, shot across me.\r\nCould Lilian be affected by the near neighbourhood of one to whose\r\nmagnetic influence she had once been so strangely subjected? I left\r\nMargrave still sleeping, closed and locked the door of the hut, went\r\nback to my dwelling, and met Amy at the threshold. Her smile was so\r\ncheering that I felt at once relieved.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said the child, putting her finger to her lips, “she is so\r\nquiet! I was coming in search of you, with a message from her.”\r\n\r\n“From Lilian to me--what! to me!”\r\n\r\n“Hush! About an hour ago, she beckoned me to draw near to her, and then\r\nsaid, very softly: ‘Tell Allen that light is coming back to me, and it\r\nall settles on him--on him. Tell him that I pray to be spared to walk by\r\nhis side on earth, hand-in-hand to that heaven which is no dream, Amy.\r\nTell him that,--no dream!’”\r\n\r\nWhile the child spoke my tears gushed, and the strong hands in which\r\nI veiled my face quivered like the leaf of the aspen. And when I could\r\ncommand my voice, I said plaintively,--\r\n\r\n“May I not, then, see her?--only for a moment, and answer her message\r\nthough but by a look?”\r\n\r\n“No, no!”\r\n\r\n“No! Where is Faber?”\r\n\r\n“Gone into the forest, in search of some herbs, but he gave me this note\r\nfor you.”\r\n\r\nI wiped the blinding tears from my eyes, and read these lines:--\r\n\r\n“I have, though with hesitation, permitted Amy to tell you the cheering\r\nwords, by which our beloved patient confirms my belief that reason\r\nis coming back to her,--slowly, labouringly, but if she survive, for\r\npermanent restoration. On no account attempt to precipitate or disturb\r\nthe work of nature. As dangerous as a sudden glare of light to eyes long\r\nblind and newly regaining vision in the friendly and soothing dark would\r\nbe the agitation that your presence at this crisis would cause. Confide\r\nin me.”\r\n\r\nI remained brooding over these lines and over Lilian’s message long and\r\nsilently, while Amy’s soothing whispers stole into my ear, soft as\r\nthe murmurs of a rill heard in the gloom of forests. Rousing myself at\r\nlength, my thoughts returned to Margrave. Doubtless he would soon awake.\r\nI bade Amy bring me such slight nutriment as I thought best suited to\r\nhis enfeebled state, telling her it was for a sick traveller, resting\r\nhimself in my hut. When Amy returned, I took from her the little basket\r\nwith which she was charged, and having, meanwhile, made a careful\r\nselection from the contents of my medicine-chest, went back to the\r\nhut. I had not long resumed my place beside Margrave’s pillow before he\r\nawoke.\r\n\r\n“What o’clock is it?” he asked, with an anxious voice.\r\n\r\n“About seven.”\r\n\r\n“Not later? That is well; my time is precious.”\r\n\r\n“Compose yourself, and eat.”\r\n\r\nI placed the food before him, and he partook of it, though sparingly,\r\nand as if with effort. He then dozed for a short time, again woke up,\r\nand impatiently demanded the cordial, which I had prepared in the mean\r\nwhile. Its effect was greater and more immediate than I could have\r\nanticipated, proving, perhaps, how much of youth there was still left in\r\nhis system, however undermined and ravaged by disease. Colour came back\r\nto his cheek, his voice grew perceptibly stronger. And as I lighted the\r\nlamp on the table near us--for it was growing dark--he gathered himself\r\nup, and spoke thus,--\r\n\r\n“You remember that I once pressed on you certain experiments. My object\r\nthen was to discover the materials from which is extracted the specific\r\nthat enables the organs of life to expel disease and regain vigour. In\r\nthat hope I sought your intimacy,--an intimacy you gave, but withdrew.”\r\n\r\n“Dare you complain? Who and what was the being from whose intimacy I\r\nshrank appalled?”\r\n\r\n“Ask what questions you please,” cried Margrave, impatiently, “later--if\r\nI have strength left to answer them; but do not interrupt me, while\r\nI husband my force to say what alone is important to me and to you.\r\nDisappointed in the hopes I had placed in you, I resolved to repair\r\nto Paris,--that great furnace of all bold ideas. I questioned learned\r\nformalists; I listened to audacious empirics. The first, with all their\r\nboasted knowledge, were too timid to concede my premises; the second,\r\nwith all their speculative daring, too knavish to let me trust to their\r\nconclusions. I found but one man, a Sicilian, who comprehended the\r\nsecrets that are called occult, and had the courage to meet Nature and\r\nall her agencies face to face. He believed, and sincerely, that he was\r\napproaching the grand result, at the very moment when he perished from\r\nwant of the common precautions which a tyro in chemistry would have\r\ntaken. At his death the gaudy city became hateful; all its pretended\r\npleasures only served to exhaust life the faster. The true joys of youth\r\nare those of the wild bird and wild brute, in the healthful enjoyment\r\nof Nature. In cities, youth is but old age with a varnish. I fled to the\r\nEast; I passed through the tents of the Arabs; I was guided--no matter\r\nby whom or by what--to the house of a Dervish, who had had for his\r\nteacher the most erudite master of secrets occult, whom I knew years ago\r\nat Aleppo---Why that exclamation?”\r\n\r\n“Proceed. What I have to say will come--later.”\r\n\r\n“From this Dervish I half forced and half purchased the secret I sought\r\nto obtain. I now know from what peculiar substance the so-called elixir\r\nof life is extracted; I know also the steps of the process through which\r\nthat task is accomplished. You smile incredulously. What is your doubt?\r\nState it while I rest for a moment. My breath labours; give me more of\r\nthe cordial.”\r\n\r\n“Need I tell you my doubt? You have, you say, at your command the elixir\r\nof life of which Cagliostro did not leave his disciples the recipe; and\r\nyou stretch out your hand for a vulgar cordial which any village chemist\r\ncould give you!”\r\n\r\n“I can explain this apparent contradiction. The process by which the\r\nelixir is extracted from the material which hoards its essence is one\r\nthat requires a hardihood of courage which few possess. This Dervish,\r\nwho had passed through that process once, was deaf to all prayer, and\r\nunmoved by all bribes, to attempt it again. He was poor; for the secret\r\nby which metals may be transmuted is not, as the old alchemists seem to\r\nimply, identical with that by which the elixir of life is extracted. He\r\nhad only been enabled to discover, in the niggard strata of the lands\r\nwithin range of his travel, a few scanty morsels of the glorious\r\nsubstance. From these he had extracted scarcely enough of the elixir to\r\nfill a third of that little glass which I have just drained. He guarded\r\nevery drop for himself. Who that holds healthful life as the one boon\r\nabove all price to the living, would waste upon others what prolongs\r\nand recruits his own being? Therefore, though he sold me his secret, he\r\nwould not sell me his treasure.”\r\n\r\n“Any quack may sell you the information how to make not only an elixir,\r\nbut a sun and a moon, and then scare you from the experiment by tales\r\nof the danger of trying it! How do you know that this essence which the\r\nDervish possessed was the elixir of life, since, it seems, you have not\r\ntried on yourself what effect its precious drops could produce? Poor\r\nwretch, who once seemed to me so awfully potent! do you come to the\r\nAntipodes in search of a drug that only exists in the fables by which a\r\nchild is amused?”\r\n\r\n“The elixir of life is no fable,” cried Margrave, with a kindling of\r\neye, a power of voice, a dilatation of form, that startled me in one\r\njust before so feeble. “That elixir was bright in my veins when we last\r\nmet. From that golden draught of the life-spring of joy I took all that\r\ncan gladden creation. What sage would not have exchanged his wearisome\r\nknowledge for my lusty revels with Nature? What monarch would not have\r\nbartered his crown, with its brain-ache of care, for the radiance that\r\ncircled my brows, flashing out from the light that was in me? Oh again,\r\noh again! to enjoy the freedom of air with the bird, and the glow of the\r\nsun with the lizard; to sport through the blooms of the earth, Nature’s\r\nplaymate and darling; to face, in the forest and desert, the pard and\r\nthe lion,--Nature’s bravest and fiercest,--her firstborn, the heir of\r\nher realm, with the rest of her children for slaves!”\r\n\r\nAs these words burst from his lips, there was a wild grandeur in the\r\naspect of this enigmatical being which I had never beheld in the former\r\ntime of his affluent, dazzling youth. And, indeed, in his language, and\r\nin the thoughts it clothed, there was an earnestness, a concentration, a\r\ndirectness, a purpose, which had seemed wanting to his desultory talk\r\nin the earlier days I expected that reaction of languor and exhaustion\r\nwould follow his vehement outbreak of passion, but, after a short pause,\r\nhe went on with steady accents. His will was sustaining his strength. He\r\nwas determined to force his convictions on me, and the vitality, once so\r\nrich, rallied all its lingering forces to the aid of its intense desire.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, then,” he resumed, with deliberate calmness, “that, years\r\nago, I tested in my own person that essence which is the sovereign\r\nmedicament. In me, as you saw me at L----, you beheld the proof of its\r\nvirtues. Feeble and ill as I am now, my state was incalculably more\r\nhopeless when formerly restored by the elixir. He from whom I then\r\ntook the sublime restorative died without revealing the secret of its\r\ncomposition. What I obtained was only just sufficient to recruit the\r\nlamp of my life, then dying down--and no drop was left for renewing the\r\nlight which wastes its own rays in the air that it gilds. Though the\r\nDervish would not sell me his treasure, he permitted me to see it.\r\nThe appearance and odour of this essence are strangely\r\npeculiar,--unmistakable by one who has once beheld and partaken of\r\nit. In short, I recognized in the hands of the Dervish the bright\r\nlife-renewer, as I had borne it away from the corpse of the Sage of\r\nAleppo.”\r\n\r\n“Hold! Are you then, in truth, the murderer of Haroun, and is your true\r\nname Louis Grayle?”\r\n\r\n“I am no murderer, and Louis Grayle did not leave me his name. I again\r\nadjure you to postpone, for this night at least, the questions you wish\r\nto address to me.\r\n\r\n“Seeing that this obstinate pauper possessed that for which the pale\r\nowners of millions, at the first touch of palsy or gout, would consent\r\nto be paupers, of course I coveted the possession of the essence even\r\nmore than the knowledge of the substance from which it is extracted. I\r\nhad no coward fear of the experiment, which this timid driveller had not\r\nthe nerve to renew. But still the experiment might fail. I must traverse\r\nland and sea to find the fit place for it, while, in the rags of the\r\nDervish, the unfailing result of the experiment was at hand. The Dervish\r\nsuspected my design, he dreaded my power. He fled on the very night\r\nin which I had meant to seize what he refused to sell me. After all, I\r\nshould have done him no great wrong; for I should have left him wealth\r\nenough to transport himself to any soil in which the material for the\r\nelixir may be most abundant; and the desire of life would have given\r\nhis shrinking nerves the courage to replenish its ravished store. I\r\nhad Arabs in my pay, who obeyed me as hounds their master. I chased the\r\nfugitive. I came on his track, reached a house in a miserable village,\r\nin which, I was told, he had entered but an hour before. The day was\r\ndeclining, the light in the room imperfect. I saw in a corner what\r\nseemed to me the form of the Dervish,--stooped to seize it, and my hand\r\nclosed on an asp. The artful Dervish had so piled his rags that they\r\ntook the shape of the form they had clothed, and he had left, as a\r\nsubstitute for the giver of life, the venomous reptile of death.\r\n\r\n“The strength of my system enabled me to survive the effect of the\r\npoison; but during the torpor that numbed me, my Arabs, alarmed, gave no\r\nchase to my quarry. At last, though enfeebled and languid, I was again\r\non my horse. Again the pursuit, again the track! I learned--but this\r\ntime by a knowledge surer than man’s--that the Dervish had taken his\r\nrefuge in a hamlet that had sprung up over the site of a city once famed\r\nthrough Assyria. The same voice that informed me of his whereabouts\r\nwarned me not to pursue. I rejected the warning. In my eager impatience\r\nI sprang on to the chase; in my fearless resolve I felt sure of the\r\nprey. I arrived at the hamlet wearied out, for my forces were no longer\r\nthe same since the bite of the asp. The Dervish eluded me still; he had\r\nleft the floor, on which I sank exhausted, but a few minutes before my\r\nhorse stopped at the door. The carpet, on which he had rested, still\r\nlay on the ground. I dismissed the youngest and keenest of my troop in\r\nsearch of the fugitive. Sure that this time he would not escape, my eyes\r\nclosed in sleep.\r\n\r\n“How long I slept I know not,--a long dream of solitude, fever, and\r\nanguish. Was it the curse of the Dervish’s carpet? Was it a taint in\r\nthe walls of the house, or of the air, which broods sickly and rank over\r\nplaces where cities lie buried? I know not; but the Pest of the East\r\nhad seized me in slumber. When my senses recovered I found myself alone,\r\nplundered of my arms, despoiled of such gold as I had carried about\r\nme. All had deserted and left me, as the living leave the dead whom the\r\nPlague has claimed for its own. As soon as I could stand I crawled from\r\nthe threshold. The moment my voice was heard, my face seen, the whole\r\nsqualid populace rose as on a wild beast,--a mad dog. I was driven from\r\nthe place with imprecations and stones, as a miscreant whom the Plague\r\nhad overtaken while plotting the death of a holy man. Bruised and\r\nbleeding, but still defying, I turned in wrath on that dastardly rabble;\r\nthey slunk away from my path. I knew the land for miles around. I had\r\nbeen in that land years, long years ago. I came at last to the road\r\nwhich the caravans take on their way to Damascus. There I was found,\r\nspeechless and seemingly lifeless, by some European travellers. Conveyed\r\nto Damascus, I languished for weeks between life and death. But for the\r\nvirtue of that essence, which lingered yet in my veins, I could not\r\nhave survived--even thus feeble and shattered. I need not say that I\r\nnow abandoned all thought of discovering the Dervish. I had at least his\r\nsecret, if I had failed of the paltry supply he had drawn from its uses.\r\nSuch appliances as he had told me were needful are procured in the East\r\nwith more ease than in Europe. To sum up, I am here, instructed in\r\nall the knowledge, and supplied with all the aids, which warrant me in\r\nsaying, ‘Do you care for new life in its richest enjoyments, if not for\r\nyourself, for one whom you love and would reprieve from the grave? Then,\r\nshare with me in a task that a single night will accomplish, and ravish\r\na prize by which the life that you value the most will be saved from\r\nthe dust and the worm, to live on, ever young, ever blooming, when each\r\ninfant, new-born while I speak, shall have passed to the grave. Nay,\r\nwhere is the limit to life, while the earth hides the substance by which\r\nlife is renewed?”\r\n\r\nI give as faithfully as I can recall them the words in which Margrave\r\naddressed me. But who can guess by cold words transcribed, even were\r\nthey artfully ranged by a master of language, the effect words produce\r\nwhen warm from the breath of the speaker? Ask one of an audience which\r\nsome orator held enthralled, why his words do not quicken a beat in the\r\nreader’s pulse, and the answer of one who had listened will be, “The\r\nwords took their charm from the voice and the eye, the aspect, the\r\nmanner, the man!” So it was with the incomprehensible being before me.\r\nThough his youth was faded, though his beauty was dimmed, though my\r\nfancies clothed him with memories of abhorrent dread, though my reason\r\nopposed his audacious beliefs and assumptions, still he charmed and\r\nspell-bound me; still he was the mystical fascinator; still, if\r\nthe legends of magic had truth for their basis, he was the born\r\nmagician,--as genius, in what calling soever, is born with the gift to\r\nenchant and subdue us.\r\n\r\nConstraining myself to answer calmly, I said, “You have told me your\r\nstory; you have defined the object of the experiment in which you ask me\r\nto aid. You do right to bid me postpone my replies or my questions. Seek\r\nto recruit by sleep the strength you have so sorely tasked. To-morrow--”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, ere night, you will decide whether the man whom out of\r\nall earth I have selected to aid me shall be the foe to condemn me to\r\nperish! I tell you plainly I need your aid, and your prompt aid. Three\r\ndays from this, and all aid will be too late!”\r\n\r\nI had already gained the door of the room, when he called to me to come\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“You do not live in this but, but with your family yonder. Do not tell\r\nthem that I am here; let no one but yourself see me as I now am. Lock\r\nthe door of the hut when you quit it. I should not close my eyes if I\r\nwere not secure from intruders.”\r\n\r\n“There is but one in my house, or in these parts, whom I would except\r\nfrom the interdict you impose. You are aware of your own imminent\r\ndanger; the life, which you believe the discovery of a Dervish will\r\nindefinitely prolong, seems to my eye of physician to hang on a thread.\r\nI have already formed my own conjecture as to the nature of the disease\r\nthat enfeebles you. But I would fain compare that conjecture with the\r\nweightier opinion of one whose experience and skill are superior to\r\nmine. Permit me, then, when I return to you to-morrow, to bring with\r\nme the great physician to whom I refer. His name will not, perhaps, be\r\nunknown to you: I speak of Julius Faber.”\r\n\r\n“A physician of the schools! I can guess well enough how learnedly he\r\nwould prate, and how little he could do. But I will not object to his\r\nvisit, if it satisfies you that, since I should die under the hands of\r\nthe doctors, I may be permitted to indulge my own whim in placing my\r\nhopes in a Dervish. Yet stay. You have, doubtless, spoken of me to this\r\nJulius Faber, your fellow-physician and friend? Promise me, if you bring\r\nhim here, that you will not name me,--that you will not repeat to him\r\nthe tale I have told you, or the hope which has led me to these shores.\r\nWhat I have told you, no matter whether, at this moment, you consider me\r\nthe dupe of a chimera, is still under the seal of the confidence which a\r\npatient reposes in the physician he himself selects for his confidant. I\r\nselect you, and not Julius Faber!”\r\n\r\n“Be it as you will,” said I, after a moment’s reflection. “The moment\r\nyou make yourself my patient, I am bound to consider what is best for\r\nyou. And you may more respect, and profit by, an opinion based upon your\r\npurely physical condition than by one in which you might suppose the\r\nadvice was directed rather to the disease of the mind than to that of\r\nthe body.”\r\n\r\n“How amazed and indignant your brother-physician will be if he ever see\r\nme a second time! How learnedly he will prove that, according to all\r\ncorrect principles of science and nature, I ought to be dead!”\r\n\r\nHe uttered this jest with a faint weary echo of his old merry, melodious\r\nlaugh, then turned his face to the wall; and so I left him to repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nI found Mrs. Ashleigh waiting for me in our usual sitting-room. She\r\nwas in tears. She had begun to despond of Lilian’s recovery, and she\r\ninfected me with her own alarm. However, I disguised my participation in\r\nher fears, soothed and sustained her as I best could, and persuaded her\r\nto retire to rest. I saw Faber for a few minutes before I sought my\r\nown chamber. He assured me that there was no perceptible change for the\r\nworse in Lilian’s physical state since he had last seen me, and that her\r\nmind, even within the last few hours, had become decidedly more clear.\r\nHe thought that, within the next twenty-four hours, the reason would\r\nmake a strong and successful effort for complete recovery; but he\r\ndeclined to hazard more than a hope that the effort would not exhaust\r\nthe enfeebled powers of the frame. He himself was so in need of a few\r\nhours of rest that I ceased to harass him with questions which he could\r\nnot answer, and fears which he could not appease. Before leaving him\r\nfor the night, I told him briefly that there was a traveller in my but\r\nsmitten by a disease which seemed to me so grave that I would ask\r\nhis opinion of the case, if he could accompany me to the hut the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMy own thoughts that night were not such as would suffer me to sleep.\r\n\r\nBefore Margrave’s melancholy state much of my former fear and abhorrence\r\nfaded away. This being, so exceptional that fancy might well invest him\r\nwith preternatural attributes, was now reduced by human suffering to\r\nhuman sympathy and comprehension; yet his utter want of conscience was\r\nstill as apparent as in his day of joyous animal spirits. With what\r\nhideous candour he had related his perfidy and ingratitude to the man\r\nto whom, in his belief, he owed an inestimable obligation, and with what\r\ninsensibility to the signal retribution which in most natures would have\r\nawakened remorse!\r\n\r\nAnd by what dark hints and confessions did he seem to confirm the\r\nincredible memoir of Sir Philip Derval! He owned that he had borne from\r\nthe corpse of Haroun the medicament to which he ascribed his recovery\r\nfrom a state yet more hopeless than that under which he now laboured! He\r\nhad alluded, rapidly, obscurely, to some knowledge at his command\r\n“surer than man’s.” And now, even now the mere wreck of his former\r\nexistence--by what strange charm did he still control and confuse my\r\nreason? And how was it that I felt myself murmuring, again and again,\r\n“But what, after all, if his hope be no chimera, and if Nature do hide a\r\nsecret by which I could save the life of my beloved Lilian?”\r\n\r\nAnd again and again, as that thought would force itself on me, I rose\r\nand crept to Lilian’s threshold, listening to catch the faintest sound\r\nof her breathing. All still, all dark! In that sufferer recognized\r\nscience detects no mortal disease, yet dares not bid me rely on its\r\namplest resources of skill to turn aside from her slumber the stealthy\r\nadvance of death; while in yon log-hut one whose malady recognized\r\nscience could not doubt to be mortal has composed himself to sleep,\r\nconfident of life! Recognized science?--recognized ignorance! The\r\nscience of to-day is the ignorance of to-morrow! Every year some bold\r\nguess lights up a truth to which, but the year before, the schoolmen of\r\nscience were as blinded as moles.\r\n\r\n“What, then,” my lips kept repeating,--“what if Nature do hide a secret\r\nby which the life of my life can be saved? What do we know of the\r\nsecrets of Nature? What said Newton himself of his knowledge? ‘I am like\r\na child picking up pebbles and shells on the sand, while the great ocean\r\nof Truth lies all undiscovered around me!’ And did Newton himself, in\r\nthe ripest growth of his matchless intellect, hold the creed of the\r\nalchemists in scorn? Had he not given to one object of their research,\r\nin the transmutation of metals, his days and his nights? Is there proof\r\nthat he ever convinced himself that the research was the dream, which\r\nwe, who are not Newtons, call it?(1) And that other great sage, inferior\r\nonly to Newton--the calculating doubt-weigher, Descartes--had he not\r\nbelieved in the yet nobler hope of the alchemists,--believed in some\r\noccult nostrum or process by which human life could attain to the age of\r\nthe Patriarchs?” (2)\r\n\r\nIn thoughts like these the night wore away, the moonbeams that streamed\r\nthrough my window lighting up the spacious solitudes beyond,--mead and\r\ncreek, forest-land, mountaintop,--and the silence without broken by\r\nthe wild cry of the night hawk and the sibilant melancholy dirge of\r\nthe shining chrysococyx,(3)--bird that never sings but at night, and\r\nobstinately haunts the roofs of the sick and dying, ominous of woe and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut up sprang the sun, and, chasing these gloomy sounds, out burst the\r\nwonderful chorus of Australian groves, the great kingfisher opening the\r\njocund melodious babble with the glee of his social laugh.\r\n\r\nAnd now I heard Faber’s step in Lilian’s room,--heard through the door\r\nher soft voice, though I could not distinguish the words. It was not\r\nlong before I saw the kind physician standing at the threshold of my\r\nchamber. He pressed his finger to his lip, and made me a sign to follow\r\nhim. I obeyed, with noiseless tread and stifled breathing. He awaited me\r\nin the garden under the flowering acacias, passed his arm in mine, and\r\ndrew me into the open pasture-land.\r\n\r\n“Compose yourself,” he then said; “I bring you tidings both of gladness\r\nand of fear. Your Lilian’s mind is restored: even the memories which\r\nhad been swept away by the fever that followed her return to her home in\r\nL---- are returning, though as yet indistinct. She yearns to see you, to\r\nbless you for all your noble devotion, your generous, greathearted love;\r\nbut I forbid such interview now. If, in a few hours, she become either\r\ndecidedly stronger or decidedly more enfeebled, you shall be summoned\r\nto her side. Even if you are condemned to a loss for which the sole\r\nconsolation must be placed in the life hereafter, you shall have, at\r\nleast, the last mortal commune of soul with soul. Courage! courage!\r\nYou are man! Bear as man what you have so often bid other men submit to\r\nendure.”\r\n\r\nI had flung myself on the ground,--writhing worm that had no home but\r\non earth! Man, indeed! Man! All, at that moment, I took from manhood was\r\nits acute sensibility to love and to anguish!\r\n\r\nBut after all such paroxysms of mortal pain, there comes a strange\r\nlull. Thought itself halts, like the still hush of water between two\r\ndescending torrents. I rose in a calm, which Faber might well mistake\r\nfor fortitude.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said quietly, “fulfil your promise. If Lilian is to pass away\r\nfrom me, I shall see her, at least, again; no wall, you tell me, between\r\nour minds; mind to mind once more,--once more!”\r\n\r\n“Allen,” said Faber, mournfully and softly, “why do you shun to repeat\r\nmy words--soul to soul?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay,--I understand. Those words mean that you have resigned all hope\r\nthat Lilian’s life will linger here, when her mind comes back in full\r\nconsciousness; I know well that last lightning flash and the darkness\r\nwhich swallows it up!”\r\n\r\n“You exaggerate my fears. I have not resigned the hope that Lilian will\r\nsurvive the struggle through which she is passing, but it will be cruel\r\nto deceive you--my hope is weaker than it was.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay. Again, I understand! Your science is in fault,--it desponds.\r\nIts last trust is in the wonderful resources of Nature, the vitality\r\nstored in the young!”\r\n\r\n“You have said,--those resources of Nature are wondrous. The vitality\r\nof youth is a fountain springing up from the deeps out of sight, when, a\r\nmoment before, we had measured the drops oozing out from the sands, and\r\nthought that the well was exhausted.”\r\n\r\n“Come with me,--come. I told you of another sufferer yonder. I want your\r\nopinion of his case. But can you be spared a few minutes from Lilian’s\r\nside?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I left her asleep. What is the case that perplexes your eye of\r\nphysician, which is usually keener than mine, despite all the length of\r\nmy practice?”\r\n\r\n“The sufferer is young, his organization rare in its vigour. He has gone\r\nthrough and survived assaults upon life that are commonly fatal. His\r\nsystem has been poisoned by the fangs of a venomous asp, and shattered\r\nby the blast of the plague. These alone, I believe, would not suffice\r\nto destroy him. But he is one who has a strong dread of death; and while\r\nthe heart was thus languid and feeble, it has been gnawed by emotions\r\nof hope or of fear. I suspect that he is dying, not from the bite of the\r\nreptile, not from the taint of the pestilence, but from the hope and the\r\nfear that have overtasked the heart’s functions. Judge for yourself.”\r\n\r\nWe were now at the door of the hut. I unlocked it: we entered. Margrave\r\nhad quitted his bed, and was pacing the room slowly. His step was less\r\nfeeble, his countenance less haggard than on the previous evening.\r\n\r\nHe submitted himself to Faber’s questioning with a quiet indifference,\r\nand evidently cared nothing for any opinion which the great physician\r\nmight found on his replies.\r\n\r\nWhen Faber had learned all he could, he said, with a grave smile: “I see\r\nthat my advice will have little weight with you; such as it is, at least\r\nreflect on it. The conclusions to which your host arrived in his view\r\nof your case, and which he confided to me, are, in my humble judgment,\r\ncorrect. I have no doubt that the great organ of the heart is\r\ninvolved in the cause of your sufferings; but the heart is a noble and\r\nmuch-enduring organ. I have known men in whom it has been more severely\r\nand unequivocally affected with disease than it is in you, live on for\r\nmany years, and ultimately die of some other disorder. But then life was\r\nheld, as yours must be held, upon one condition,--repose. I enjoin you\r\nto abstain from all violent action, to shun all excitements that cause\r\nmoral disturbance. You are young: would you live on, you must live as\r\nthe old. More than this,--it is my duty to warn you that your tenure\r\non earth is very precarious; you may attain to many years; you may be\r\nsuddenly called hence tomorrow. The best mode to regard this uncertainty\r\nwith the calm in which is your only chance of long life, is so to\r\narrange all your worldly affairs, and so to discipline all your human\r\nanxieties, as to feel always prepared for the summons that may come\r\nwithout warning. For the rest, quit this climate as soon as you can,--it\r\nis the climate in which the blood courses too quickly for one who should\r\nshun all excitement. Seek the most equable atmosphere, choose the most\r\ntranquil pursuits; and Fenwick himself, in his magnificent pride of\r\nstature and strength, may be nearer the grave than you are.”\r\n\r\n“Your opinion coincides with that I have just heard?” asked Margrave,\r\nturning to me.\r\n\r\n“In much--yes.”\r\n\r\n“It is more favourable than I should have supposed. I am far from\r\ndisdaining the advice so kindly offered. Permit me, in turn, two or\r\nthree questions, Dr. Faber. Do you prescribe to me no drugs from your\r\npharmacopoeia?”\r\n\r\n“Drugs may palliate many sufferings incidental to organic disease, but\r\ndrugs cannot reach organic disease itself.”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe that, even where disease is plainly organic, Nature\r\nherself has no alternative and reparative powers, by which the organ\r\nassailed may recover itself?”\r\n\r\n“A few exceptional instances of such forces in Nature are upon record;\r\nbut we must go by general laws, and not by exceptions.”\r\n\r\n“Have you never known instances--do you not at this moment know one--in\r\nwhich a patient whose malady baffles the doctor’s skill, imagines or\r\ndreams of a remedy? Call it a whim if you please, learned sir; do you\r\nnot listen to the whim, and, in despair of your own prescriptions,\r\ncomply with those of the patient?”\r\n\r\nFaber changed countenance, and even started. Margrave watched him and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n“You grant that there are such cases, in which the patient gives the law\r\nto the physician. Now, apply your experience to my case. Suppose some\r\nstrange fancy had seized upon my imagination--that is the doctor’s cant\r\nword for all phenomena which we call exceptional--some strange fancy\r\nthat I had thought of a cure for this disease for which you have no\r\ndrugs; and suppose this fancy of mine to be so strong, so vivid, that to\r\ndeny me its gratification would produce the very emotion from which you\r\nwarn me as fatal,--storm the heart, that you would soothe to repose, by\r\nthe passions of rage and despair,--would you, as my trusted physician,\r\nconcede or deny me my whim?”\r\n\r\n“Can you ask? I should grant it at once, if I had no reason to know that\r\nthe thing that you fancied was harmful.”\r\n\r\n“Good man and wise doctor! I have no other question to ask. I thank\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nFaber looked hard on the young, wan face, over which played a smile\r\nof triumph and irony; then turned away with an expression of doubt and\r\ntrouble on his own noble countenance. I followed him silently into the\r\nopen air.\r\n\r\n“Who and what is this visitor of yours?” he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Who and what? I cannot tell you.”\r\n\r\nFaber remained some moments musing, and muttering slowly to himself,\r\n“Tut! but a chance coincidence,--a haphazard allusion to a fact which he\r\ncould not have known!”\r\n\r\n“Faber,” said I, abruptly, “can it be that Lilian is the patient in\r\nwhose self-suggested remedies you confide more than in the various\r\nlearning at command of your practised skill?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot deny it,” replied Faber, reluctantly. “In the intervals of\r\nthat suspense from waking sense, which in her is not sleep, nor yet\r\naltogether catalepsy, she has, for the last few days, stated accurately\r\nthe precise moment in which the trance--if I may so call it--would\r\npass away, and prescribed for herself the remedies that should be then\r\nadministered. In every instance, the remedies so self-prescribed, though\r\ncertainly not those which would have occurred to my mind, have proved\r\nefficacious. Her rapid progress to reason I ascribe to the treatment\r\nshe herself ordained in her trance, without remembrance of her own\r\nsuggestions when she awoke. I had meant to defer communicating these\r\nphenomena in the idiosyncrasy of her case until our minds could more\r\ncalmly inquire into the process by which ideas--not apparently derived,\r\nas your metaphysical school would derive all ideas, from preconceived\r\nexperiences--will thus sometimes act like an instinct on the human\r\nsufferer for self-preservation, as the bird is directed to the herb\r\nor the berry which heals or assuages its ailments. We know how the\r\nmesmerists would account for this phenomenon of hygienic introvision and\r\nclairvoyance. But here, there is no mesmerizer, unless the patient can\r\nbe supposed to mesmerize herself. Long, however, before mesmerism was\r\nheard of, medical history attests examples in which patients who baffled\r\nthe skill of the ablest physicians have fixed their fancies on some\r\nremedy that physicians would call inoperative for good or for harm,\r\nand have recovered by the remedies thus singularly self-suggested. And\r\nHippocrates himself, if I construe his meaning rightly, recognizes the\r\npowers for self-cure which the condition of trance will sometimes bestow\r\non the sufferer, ‘where’ (says the father of our art) ‘the sight\r\nbeing closed to the external, the soul more truthfully perceives the\r\naffections of the body.’ In short--I own it--in this instance, the skill\r\nof the physician has been a compliant obedience to the instinct called\r\nforth in the patient; and the hopes I have hitherto permitted myself to\r\ngive you were founded on my experience that her own hopes, conceived\r\nin trance, had never been fallacious or exaggerated. The simples that\r\nI gathered for her yesterday she had described; they are not in our\r\nherbal. But as they are sometimes used by the natives, I had the\r\ncuriosity to analyze their chemical properties shortly after I came to\r\nthe colony, and they seemed to me as innocent as lime-blossoms. They\r\nare rare in this part of Australia, but she told me where I should find\r\nthem,--a remote spot, which she has certainly never visited. Last night,\r\nwhen you saw me disturbed, dejected, it was because, for the first time,\r\nthe docility with which she had hitherto, in her waking state, obeyed\r\nher own injunctions in the state of trance, forsook her. She could not\r\nbe induced to taste the decoction I had made from the herbs; and if you\r\nfound me this morning with weaker hopes than before, this is the real\r\ncause,--namely, that when I visited her at sunrise, she was not in sleep\r\nbut in trance, and in that trance she told me that she had nothing more\r\nto suggest or reveal; that on the complete restoration of her senses,\r\nwhich was at hand, the abnormal faculties vouchsafed to trance would be\r\nwithdrawn. ‘As for my life,’ she said quietly, as if unconscious of our\r\ntemporary joy or woe in the term of its tenure here,--‘as for my life,\r\nyour aid is now idle; my own vision obscure; on my life a dark and cold\r\nshadow is resting. I cannot foresee if it will pass away. When I strive\r\nto look around, I see but my Allen--’”\r\n\r\n“And so,” said I, mastering my emotions, “in bidding me hope, you did\r\nnot rely on your own resources of science, but on the whisper of Nature\r\nin the brain of your patient?”\r\n\r\n“It is so.”\r\n\r\nWe both remained silent some moments, and then, as he disappeared within\r\nmy house, I murmured,--\r\n\r\n“And when she strives to look beyond the shadow, she sees only me! Is\r\nthere some prophet-hint of Nature there also, directing me not to scorn\r\nthe secret which a wanderer, so suddenly dropped on my solitude, assures\r\nme that Nature will sometimes reveal to her seeker? And oh! that dark\r\nwanderer--has Nature a marvel more weird than himself?”\r\n\r\n(1) “Besides the three great subjects of Newton’s labours--the fluxional\r\ncalculus, physical astronomy, and optics--a very large portion of his\r\ntime, while resident in his college, was devoted to researches of which\r\nscarcely a trace remains. Alchemy, which had fascinated so many eager\r\nand ambitious minds, seems to have tempted Newton with an overwhelming\r\nforce. What theories he formed, what experiments he tried, in that\r\nlaboratory where, it is said, the fire was scarcely extinguished for\r\nweeks together, will never be known. It is certain that no success\r\nattended his labours; and Newton was not a man--like Kepler--to detail\r\nto the world all the hopes and disappointments, all the crude and\r\nmystical fancies, which mixed themselves up with his career of\r\nphilosophy... Many years later we find Newton in correspondence with\r\nLocke, with reference to a mysterious red earth by which Boyle, who\r\nwas then recently dead, had asserted that he could effect the grand\r\ndesideratum of multiplying gold. By this time, however, Newton’s faith\r\nhad become somewhat shaken by the unsatisfactory communications which\r\nhe had himself received from Boyle on the subject of the golden recipe,\r\nthough he did not abandon the idea of giving the experiment a further\r\ntrial as soon as the weather should become suitable for furnace\r\nexperiments.”--Quarterly Review, No. 220, pp. 125, 126.\r\n\r\n(2) Southey, in his “Doctor,” vol. vi. p. 2, reports the conversation of\r\nSir Kenelm Digby with Descartes, in which the great geometrician said,\r\n“That as for rendering man immortal, it was what he could not venture\r\nto promise, but that he was very sure he could prolong his life to the\r\nstandard of the patriarchs.” And Southey adds, “that St. Evremond, to\r\nwhom Digby repeated this, says that this opinion of Descartes was well\r\nknown both to his friends in Holland and in France.” By the stress\r\nSouthey lays on this hearsay evidence, it is clear that he was not\r\nacquainted with the works and biography of Descartes, or he would have\r\ngone to the fountain-head for authority on Descartes’s opinions, namely,\r\nDescartes himself. It is to be wished that Southey had done so, for\r\nno one more than he would have appreciated the exquisitely candid and\r\nlovable nature of the illustrious Frenchman, and the sincerity with\r\nwhich he cherished in his heart whatever doctrine he conceived in his\r\nunderstanding. Descartes, whose knowledge of anatomy was considerable,\r\nhad that passion for the art of medicine which is almost inseparable\r\nfrom the pursuit of natural philosophy. At the age of twenty-four he\r\nhad sought (in Germany) to obtain initiation into the brotherhood of the\r\nRosicrucians, but unluckily could not discover any member of the society\r\nto introduce him. “He desired,” says Cousin, “to assure the health of\r\nman, diminish his ills, extend his existence. He was terrified by the\r\nrapid and almost momentary passage of man upon earth. He believed it\r\nwas not, perhaps, impossible to prolong its duration.” There is a hidden\r\nrecess of grandeur in this idea, and the means proposed by Descartes for\r\nthe execution of his project were not less grand. In his “Discourse on\r\nMethod,” Descartes says, “If it is possible to find some means to render\r\ngenerally men more wise and more able than they have been till now, it\r\nis, I believe, in medicine that those means must be sought... I am sure\r\nthat there is no one, even in the medical profession, who will not\r\navow that all which one knows of the medical art is almost nothing\r\nin comparison to that which remains to learn, and that one could be\r\nexempted from an infinity of maladies, both of body and mind, and even,\r\nperhaps, from the decrepitude of old age, if one had sufficient lore\r\nof their causes and of all the remedies which nature provides for them.\r\nTherefore, having design to employ all my life in the research of a\r\nscience so necessary, and having discovered a path which appears to me\r\nsuch that one ought infallibly, in following, to find it, if one is\r\nnot hindered prematurely by the brevity of life or by the defects of\r\nexperience, I consider that there is no better remedy against those two\r\nhindrances than to communicate faithfully to the public the little\r\nI have found,” etc. (“Discours de la Methode,” vol. i. OEuvres de\r\nDescartes, Cousin’s Edition.) And again, in his “Correspondence” (vol.\r\nix. p. 341), he says: “The conservation of health has been always the\r\nprincipal object of my studies, and I have no doubt that there is a\r\nmeans of acquiring much knowledge touching medicine which, up to this\r\ntime, is ignored.” He then refers to his meditated Treatise on Animals\r\nas only an entrance upon that knowledge. But whatever secrets Descartes\r\nmay have thought to discover, they are not made known to the public\r\naccording to his promise. And in a letter to M. Chanut, written in 1646\r\n(four years before he died), he says ingenuously: “I will tell you in\r\nconfidence that the notion, such as it is, which I have endeavoured to\r\nacquire in physical philosophy, had greatly assisted me to establish\r\ncertain foundations for moral philosophy; and that I am more easily\r\nsatisfied upon this point than I am on many others touching medicine, to\r\nwhich I have, nevertheless, devoted much more time. So that”--(adds the\r\ngrand thinker, with a pathetic nobleness )--“so that, instead of finding\r\nthe means to preserve life, I have found another good, more easy and\r\nmore sure, which is--not to fear death.”\r\n\r\n(3) Chrysococyx lucidus,--namely, the bird popularly called the shining\r\nor bronzed cuckoo. “Its note is an exceedingly melancholy whistle, heard\r\nat night, when it is very annoying to any sick or nervous person who\r\nmay be inclined to sleep. I have known many instances where the bird\r\nhas been perched on a tree in the vicinity of the room of an invalid,\r\nuttering its mournful notes, and it was only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that it could be dislodged from its position.”--Dr. Bennett:\r\nGatherings of a Naturalist in Australasia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nI strayed through the forest till noon, in debate with myself, and\r\nstrove to shape my wild doubts into purpose, before I could nerve and\r\ncompose myself again to face Margrave alone.\r\n\r\nI re-entered the hut. To my surprise, Margrave was not in the room in\r\nwhich I had left him, nor in that which adjoined it. I ascended the\r\nstairs to the kind of loft in which I had been accustomed to pursue my\r\nstudies, but in which I had not set foot since my alarm for Lilian had\r\nsuspended my labours. There I saw Margrave quietly seated before the\r\nmanuscript of my Ambitious Work, which lay open on the rude table, just\r\nas I had left it, in the midst of its concluding summary.\r\n\r\n“I have taken the license of former days, you see,” said Margrave,\r\nsmiling, “and have hit by chance on a passage I can understand without\r\neffort. But why such a waste of argument to prove a fact so simple? In\r\nman, as in brute, life once lost is lost forever; and that is why life\r\nis so precious to man.”\r\n\r\nI took the book from his hand, and flung it aside in wrath. His approval\r\nrevolted me more with my own theories than all the argumentative rebukes\r\nof Faber.\r\n\r\n“And now,” I said, sternly, “the time has come for the explanation\r\nyou promised. Before I can aid you in any experiment that may serve to\r\nprolong your life, I must know how far that life has been a baleful and\r\ndestroying influence?”\r\n\r\n“I have some faint recollection of having saved your life from an\r\nimminent danger, and if gratitude were the attribute of man, as it is of\r\nthe dog, I should claim your aid to serve mine as a right. Ask me what\r\nyou will. You must have seen enough of me to know that I do not affect\r\neither the virtues or vices of others. I regard both with so supreme an\r\nindifference, that I believe I am vicious or virtuous unawares. I know\r\nnot if I can explain what seems to have perplexed you, but if I cannot\r\nexplain I have no intention to lie. Speak--I listen! We have time enough\r\nnow before us.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he reclined back in the chair, stretching out his limbs\r\nwearily. All round this spoilt darling of Material Nature were the\r\naids and appliances of Intellectual Science,--books and telescopes\r\nand crucibles, with the light of day coming through a small circular\r\naperture in the boarded casement, as I had constructed the opening for\r\nmy experimental observation of the prismal rays.\r\n\r\nWhile I write, his image is as visible before my remembrance as if\r\nbefore the actual eye,--beautiful even in its decay, awful even in its\r\nweakness, mysterious as is Nature herself amidst all the mechanism by\r\nwhich our fancied knowledge attempts to measure her laws and analyze her\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment no such subtle reflections delayed my inquisitive\r\neager mind from its immediate purpose,--who and what was this creature\r\nboasting of a secret through which I might rescue from death the life of\r\nher who was my all upon the earth?\r\n\r\nI gathered rapidly and succinctly together all that I knew and all that\r\nI guessed of Margrave’s existence and arts. I commenced from my vision\r\nin that mimic Golgotha of creatures inferior to man, close by the scene\r\nof man’s most trivial and meaningless pastime. I went on,--Derval’s\r\nmurder; the missing contents of the casket; the apparition seen by the\r\nmaniac assassin guiding him to the horrid deed; the luminous haunting\r\nshadow; the positive charge in the murdered man’s memoir connecting\r\nMargrave with Louis Grayle, and accusing him of the murder of Haroun;\r\nthe night in the moonlit pavilion at Derval Court; the baneful influence\r\non Lilian; the struggle between me and himself in the house by the\r\nseashore,--the strange All that is told in this Strange Story.\r\n\r\nBut warming as I spoke, and in a kind of fierce joy to be enabled thus\r\nto free my own heart of the doubts that had burdened it, now that I\r\nwas fairly face to face with the being by whom my reason had been so\r\nperplexed and my life so tortured. I was restrained by none of the fears\r\nlest my own fancy deceived me, with which in his absence I had striven\r\nto reduce to natural causes the portents of terror and wonder. I stated\r\nplainly, directly, the beliefs, the impressions which I had never dared\r\neven to myself to own without seeking to explain them away. And coming\r\nat last to a close, I said: “Such are the evidences that seem to me to\r\njustify abhorrence of the life that you ask me to aid in prolonging.\r\nYour own tale of last night but confirms them. And why to me--to me--do\r\nyou come with wild entreaties to lengthen the life that has blighted\r\nmy own? How did you even learn the home in which I sought unavailing\r\nrefuge? How--as your hint to Faber clearly revealed--were you aware\r\nthat, in yon house, where the sorrow is veiled, where the groan is\r\nsuppressed, where the foot-tread falls ghostlike, there struggles now\r\nbetween life and death my heart’s twin, my world’s sunshine? Ah!\r\nthrough my terror for her, is it a demon that tells you how to bribe my\r\nabhorrence into submission, and supple my reason into use to your ends?”\r\n\r\nMargrave had listened to me throughout with a fixed attention, at times\r\nwith a bewildered stare, at times with exclamations of surprise, but\r\nnot of denial. And when I had done, he remained for some moments silent,\r\nseemingly stupefied, passing his hand repeatedly over his brow, in the\r\ngesture so familiar to him in former days.\r\n\r\nAt length he said quietly, without evincing any sign either of\r\nresentment or humiliation,--\r\n\r\n“In much that you tell me I recognize myself; in much I am as lost in\r\namazement as you in wild doubt or fierce wrath. Of the effect that you\r\nsay Philip Derval produced on me I have no recollection. Of himself I\r\nhave only this,--that he was my foe, that he came to England intent on\r\nschemes to shorten my life or destroy its enjoyments. All my faculties\r\ntend to self-preservation; there, they converge as rays in a focus; in\r\nthat focus they illume and--they burn. I willed to destroy my intended\r\ndestroyer. Did my will enforce itself on the agent to which it was\r\nguided? Likely enough. Be it so. Would you blame me for slaying the\r\ntiger or serpent--not by the naked hand, but by weapons that arm it? But\r\nwhat could tiger and serpent do more against me than the man who\r\nwould rob me of life? He had his arts for assault, I had mine for\r\nself-defence. He was to me as the tiger that creeps through the jungle,\r\nor the serpent uncoiling his folds for the spring. Death to those whose\r\nlife is destruction to mine, be they serpent or tiger or man! Derval\r\nperished. Yes! the spot in which the maniac had buried the casket was\r\nrevealed to me--no matter how; the contents of the casket passed into\r\nmy hands. I coveted that possession because I believed that Derval had\r\nlearned from Haroun of Aleppo the secret by which the elixir of life is\r\nprepared, and I supposed that some stores of the essence would be found\r\nin his casket. I was deceived--not a drop! What I there found I knew\r\nnot how to use or apply, nor did I care to learn. What I sought was not\r\nthere. You see a luminous shadow of myself; it haunts, it accosts, it\r\ncompels you. Of this I know nothing. Was it the emanation of my intense\r\nwill really producing this spectre of myself, or was it the thing\r\nof your own imagination,--an imagination which my will impressed and\r\nsubjugated? I know not. At the hours when my shadow, real or supposed,\r\nwas with you, my senses would have been locked in sleep. It is true,\r\nhowever, that I intensely desire to learn from races always near to\r\nman, but concealed from his every-day vision, the secret that I believed\r\nPhilip Derval had carried with him to the tomb; and from some cause\r\nor another I cannot now of myself alone, as I could years ago, subject\r\nthose races to my command,--I must, in that, act through or with the\r\nmind of another. It is true that I sought to impress upon your waking\r\nthoughts the images of the circle, the powers of the wand, which, in\r\nyour trance or sleep-walking, made you the involuntary agent of my will.\r\nI knew by a dream--for by dreams, more or less vivid, are the results\r\nof my waking will sometimes divulged to myself--that the spell had been\r\nbroken, the discovery I sought not effected. All my hopes were then\r\ntransferred from yourself, the dull votary of science, to the girl whom\r\nI charmed to my thraldom through her love for you and through her\r\ndreams of a realm which the science of schools never enters. In her,\r\nimagination was all pure and all potent; and tell me, O practical\r\nreasoner, if reason has ever advanced one step into knowledge except\r\nthrough that imaginative faculty which is strongest in the wisdom of\r\nignorance, and weakest in the ignorance of the wise. Ponder this, and\r\nthose marvels that perplex you will cease to be marvellous. I pass on\r\nto the riddle that puzzles you most. By Philip Derval’s account I am,\r\nin truth, Louis Grayle restored to youth by the elixir, and while yet\r\ninfirm, decrepit, murdered Haroun,--a man of a frame as athletic as\r\nyours! By accepting this notion you seem to yourself alone to unravel\r\nthe mysteries you ascribe to my life and my powers. O wise philosopher!\r\nO profound logician! you accept that notion, yet hold my belief in the\r\nDervish’s tale a chimera! I am Grayle made young by the elixir, and yet\r\nthe elixir itself is a fable!”\r\n\r\nHe paused and laughed, but the laugh was no longer even an echo of\r\nits former merriment or playfulness,--a sinister and terrible laugh,\r\nmocking, threatening, malignant.\r\n\r\nAgain he swept his hand over his brow, and resumed,--\r\n\r\n“Is it not easier to so accomplished a sage as you to believe that the\r\nidlers of Paris have guessed the true solution of that problem, my\r\nplace on this earth? May I not be the love-son of Louis Grayle? And when\r\nHaroun refused the elixir to him, or he found that his frame was too far\r\nexhausted for even the elixir to repair organic lesions of structure in\r\nthe worn frame of old age, may he not have indulged the common illusion\r\nof fathers, and soothed his death-pangs with the thought that he should\r\nlive again in his son? Haroun is found dead on his carpet--rumour said\r\nstrangled. What proof of the truth of that rumour? Might he not\r\nhave passed away in a fit? Will it lessen your perplexity if I state\r\nrecollections? They are vague,--they often perplex myself; but so far\r\nfrom a wish to deceive you, my desire is to relate them so truthfully\r\nthat you may aid me to reduce them into more definite form.”\r\n\r\nHis face now became very troubled, the tone of his voice very\r\nirresolute,--the face and the voice of a man who is either\r\nblundering his way through an intricate falsehood, or through obscure\r\nreminiscences.\r\n\r\n“This Louis Grayle! this Louis Grayle! I remember him well, as one\r\nremembers a nightmare. Whenever I look back, before the illness of which\r\nI will presently speak, the image of Louis Grayle returns to me. I see\r\nmyself with him in African wilds, commanding the fierce Abyssinians.\r\nI see myself with him in the fair Persian valley,--lofty, snow-covered\r\nmountains encircling the garden of roses. I see myself with him in the\r\nhush of the golden noon, reclined by the spray of cool fountains,--now\r\nlistening to cymbals and lutes, now arguing with graybeards on secrets\r\nbequeathed by the Chaldees,--with him, with him in moonlit nights,\r\nstealing into the sepulchres of mythical kings. I see myself with him\r\nin the aisles of dark caverns, surrounded by awful shapes, which have no\r\nlikeness amongst the creatures of earth. Louis Grayle! Louis Grayle! all\r\nmy earlier memories go back to Louis Grayle! All my arts and powers, all\r\nthat I have learned of the languages spoken in Europe, of the sciences\r\ntaught in her schools, I owe to Louis Grayle. But am I one and the same\r\nwith him? No--I am but a pale reflection of his giant intellect. I have\r\nnot even a reflection of his childlike agonies of sorrow. Louis Grayle!\r\nHe stands apart from me, as a rock from the tree that grows out from its\r\nchasms. Yes, the gossip was right; I must be his son.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned his face on both hands, rocking himself to and fro. At length,\r\nwith a sigh, he resumed,--\r\n\r\n“I remember, too, a long and oppressive illness, attended with racking\r\npains, a dismal journey in a wearisome litter, the light hand of the\r\nwoman Ayesha, so sad and so stately, smoothing my pillow or fanning my\r\nbrows. I remember the evening on which my nurse drew the folds of the\r\nlitter aside, and said, ‘See Aleppo! and the star of thy birth shining\r\nover its walls!’\r\n\r\n“I remember a face inexpressibly solemn and mournful. I remember the\r\nchill that the calm of its ominous eye sent through my veins,--the face\r\nof Haroun, the Sage of Aleppo. I remember the vessel of crystal he bore\r\nin his hand, and the blessed relief from my pains that a drop from\r\nthe essence which flashed through the crystal bestowed! And then--and\r\nthen--I remember no more till the night on which Ayesha came to my couch\r\nand said, ‘Rise.’\r\n\r\n“And I rose, leaning on her, supported by her. We went through dim\r\nnarrow streets, faintly lit by wan stars, disturbing the prowl of the\r\ndogs, that slunk from the look of that woman. We came to a solitary\r\nhouse, small and low, and my nurse said, ‘Wait.’\r\n\r\n“She opened the door and went in; I seated myself on the threshold. And\r\nafter a time she came out from the house, and led me, still leaning on\r\nher, into her chamber.\r\n\r\n“A man lay, as in sleep, on the carpet, and beside him stood another\r\nman, whom I recognized as Ayesha’s special attendant,--an Indian.\r\n‘Haroun is dead,’ said Ayesha. ‘Search for that which will give thee new\r\nlife. Thou hast seen, and wilt know it, not I.’\r\n\r\n“And I put my hand on the breast of Haroun--for the dead man was he--and\r\ndrew from it the vessel of crystal.\r\n\r\n“Having done so, the frown of his marble brow appalled me. I staggered\r\nback, and swooned away.\r\n\r\n“I came to my senses, recovering and rejoicing, miles afar from the\r\ncity, the dawn red on its distant wall. Ayesha had tended me; the elixir\r\nhad already restored me.\r\n\r\n“My first thought, when full consciousness came back to me, rested\r\non Louis Grayle, for he also had been at Aleppo; I was but one of his\r\nnumerous train. He, too, was enfeebled and suffering; he had sought the\r\nknown skill of Haroun for himself as for me; and this woman loved and\r\nhad tended him as she had loved and tended me. And my nurse told me that\r\nhe was dead, and forbade me henceforth to breathe his name.\r\n\r\n“We travelled on,--she and I, and the Indian her servant,--my strength\r\nstill renewed by the wondrous elixir. No longer supported by her, what\r\ngazelle ever roved through its pasture with a bound more elastic than\r\nmine?\r\n\r\n“We came to a town, and my nurse placed before me a mirror. I did not\r\nrecognize myself. In this town we rested, obscure, till the letter there\r\nreached me by which I learned that I was the offspring of love, and\r\nenriched by the care of a father recently dead. Is it not clear that\r\nLouis Grayle was this father?”\r\n\r\n“If so, was the woman Ayesha your mother?”\r\n\r\n“The letter said that ‘my mother had died in my infancy.’ Nevertheless,\r\nthe care with which Ayesha had tended me induced a suspicion that made\r\nme ask her the very question you put. She wept when I asked her, and\r\nsaid, ‘No, only my nurse. And now I needed a nurse no more.’ The day\r\nafter I received the letter which announced an inheritance that allowed\r\nme to vie with the nobles of Europe, this woman left me, and went back\r\nto her tribe.”\r\n\r\n“Have you never seen her since?”\r\n\r\nMargrave hesitated a moment, and then answered, though with seeming\r\nreluctance, “Yes, at Damascus. Not many days after I was borne to that\r\ncity by the strangers who found me half-dead on their road, I woke one\r\nmorning to find her by my side. And she said, ‘In joy and in health you\r\ndid not need me. I am needed now.”’\r\n\r\n“Did you then deprive yourself of one so devoted? You have not made this\r\nlong voyage--from Egypt to Australia--alone,--you, to whom wealth gave\r\nno excuse for privation?”\r\n\r\n“The woman came with me; and some chosen attendants. I engaged to\r\nourselves the vessel we sailed in.”\r\n\r\n“Where have you left your companions?”\r\n\r\n“By this hour,” answered Margrave, “they are in reach of my summons; and\r\nwhen you and I have achieved the discovery--in the results of which we\r\nshall share--I will exact no more from your aid. I trust all that rests\r\nfor my cure to my nurse and her swarthy attendants. You will aid me now,\r\nas a matter of course; the physician whose counsel you needed to guide\r\nyour own skill enjoins you to obey my whim--if whim you still call\r\nit; you will obey it, for on that whim rests your own sole hope of\r\nhappiness,--you, who can love--I love nothing but life. Has my frank\r\nnarrative solved all the doubts that stood between you and me, in the\r\ngreat meeting-grounds of an interest in common?”\r\n\r\n“Solved all the doubts! Your wild story but makes some the darker,\r\nleaving others untouched: the occult powers of which you boast, and\r\nsome of which I have witnessed,--your very insight into my own household\r\nsorrows, into the interests I have, with yourself, in the truth of a\r\nfaith so repugnant to reason--”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” interrupted Margrave, with that slight curve of the lip\r\nwhich is half smile and half sneer, “if, in my account of myself, I\r\nomitted what I cannot explain, and you cannot conceive: let me first\r\nask how many of the commonest actions of the commonest men are purely\r\ninvoluntary and wholly inexplicable. When, for instance, you open your\r\nlips and utter a sentence, you have not the faintest idea beforehand\r\nwhat word will follow another. When you move a muscle can you tell me\r\nthe thought that prompts to the movement? And, wholly unable thus to\r\naccount for your own simple sympathies between impulse and act, do you\r\nbelieve that there exists a man upon earth who can read all the riddles\r\nin the heart and brain of another? Is it not true that not one drop of\r\nwater, one atom of matter, ever really touches another? Between each and\r\neach there is always a space, however infinitesimally small. How, then,\r\ncould the world go on, if every man asked another to make his whole\r\nhistory and being as lucid as daylight before he would buy and sell\r\nwith him? All interchange and alliance rest but on this,--an interest in\r\ncommon. You and I have established that interest: all else, all you ask\r\nmore, is superfluous. Could I answer each doubt you would raise, still,\r\nwhether the answer should please or revolt you, your reason would come\r\nback to the same starting-point,--namely, In one definite proposal have\r\nwe two an interest in common?”\r\n\r\nAnd again Margrave laughed, not in mirth, but in mockery. The laugh\r\nand the words that preceded it were not the laugh and the words of the\r\nyoung. Could it be possible that Louis Grayle had indeed revived to\r\nfalse youth in the person of Margrave, such might have been his laugh\r\nand such his words. The whole mind of Margrave seemed to have undergone\r\nchange since I last saw him; more rich in idea, more crafty even in\r\ncandour, more powerful, more concentred. As we see in our ordinary\r\nexperience, that some infirmity, threatening dissolution, brings forth\r\nmore vividly the reminiscences of early years, when impressions were\r\nvigorously stamped, so I might have thought that as Margrave neared the\r\ntomb, the memories he had retained from his former existence, in a being\r\nmore amply endowed, more formidably potent, struggled back to the brain;\r\nand the mind that had lived in Louis Grayle moved the lips of the dying\r\nMargrave.\r\n\r\n“For the powers and the arts that it equally puzzles your reason to\r\nassign or deny to me,” resumed my terrible guest, “I will say briefly\r\nbut this: they come from faculties stored within myself, and doubtless\r\nconduce to my self-preservation,--faculties more or less, perhaps (so\r\nVan Helmont asserts), given to all men, though dormant in most; vivid\r\nand active in me because in me self-preservation has been and yet is the\r\nstrong master-passion, or instinct; and because I have been taught how\r\nto use and direct such faculties by disciplined teachers,--some by Louis\r\nGrayle, the enchanter; some by my nurse, the singer of charmed songs.\r\nBut in much that I will to have done, I know no more than yourself how\r\nthe agency acts. Enough for me to will what I wish, and sink calmly into\r\nslumber, sure that the will would work somehow its way. But when I have\r\nwilled to know what, when known, should shape my own courses, I could\r\nsee, without aid from your pitiful telescopes, all objects howsoever\r\nfar. What wonder in that? Have you no learned puzzle-brained\r\nmetaphysicians who tell you that space is but an idea, all this palpable\r\nuniverse an idea in the mind, and no more? Why am I an enigma as dark as\r\nthe Sibyls, and your metaphysicians as plain as a hornbook?” Again the\r\nsardonic laugh. “Enough: let what I have said obscure or enlighten your\r\nguesses, we come back to the same link of union, which binds man to man,\r\nbids States arise from the desert, and foeman embrace as brothers. I\r\nneed you and you need me; without your aid my life is doomed; without my\r\nsecret the breath will have gone from the lips of your Lilian before the\r\nsun of to-morrow is red on the hill-tops.”\r\n\r\n“Fiend or juggler,” I cried in rage, “you shall not so enslave and\r\nenthrall me by this mystic farrago and jargon. Make your fantastic\r\nexperiment on yourself if you will: trust to your arts and your powers.\r\nMy Lilian’s life shall not hang on your fiat. I trust it--to--”\r\n\r\n“To what--to man’s skill? Hear what the sage of the college shall tell\r\nyou, before I ask you again for your aid. Do you trust to God’s saving\r\nmercy? Ah, of course you believe in a God? Who, except a philosopher,\r\ncan reason a Maker away? But that the Maker will alter His courses to\r\nhear you; that, whether or not you trust in Him, or in your doctor,\r\nit will change by a hairbreadth the thing that must be--do you believe\r\nthis, Allen Fenwick?”\r\n\r\nAnd there sat this reader of hearts! a boy in his aspect, mocking me and\r\nthe graybeards of schools.\r\n\r\nI could listen no more; I turned to the door and fled down the stairs,\r\nand heard, as I fled, a low chant: feeble and faint, it was still the\r\nold barbaric chant, by which the serpent is drawn from its hole by the\r\ncharmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nTo those of my readers who may seek with Julius Faber to explore,\r\nthrough intelligible causes, solutions of the marvels I narrate,\r\nMargrave’s confession may serve to explain away much that my own\r\nsuperstitious beliefs had obscured. To them Margrave is evidently\r\nthe son of Louis Grayle. The elixir of life is reduced to some simple\r\nrestorative, owing much of its effect to the faith of a credulous\r\npatient: youth is so soon restored to its joy in the sun, with or\r\nwithout an elixir. To them Margrave’s arts of enchantment are reduced\r\nto those idiosyncrasies of temperament on which the disciples of Mesmer\r\nbuild up their theories,--exaggerated, in much, by my own superstitions;\r\naided, in part, by such natural, purely physical magic as, explored by\r\nthe ancient priest-crafts, is despised by the modern philosophies, and\r\nonly remains occult because Science delights no more in the slides of\r\nthe lantern which fascinated her childhood with simulated phantoms. To\r\nthem Margrave is, perhaps, an enthusiast, but, because an enthusiast,\r\nnot less an impostor. “L’Homme se pique,” says Charron. Man cogs the\r\ndice for himself ere he rattles the box for his dupes. Was there\r\never successful impostor who did not commence by a fraud on his own\r\nunderstanding? Cradled in Orient Fableland, what though Margrave\r\nbelieves in its legends; in a wand, an elixir; in sorcerers or Afrites?\r\nThat belief in itself makes him keen to detect, and skilful to profit\r\nby, the latent but kindred credulities of others. In all illustrations\r\nof Duper and Duped through the records of superstition--from the guile\r\nof a Cromwell, a Mahomet, down to the cheats of a gypsy--professional\r\nvisionaries are amongst the astutest observers. The knowledge that\r\nMargrave had gained of my abode, of my affliction, or of the innermost\r\nthoughts in my mind, it surely demanded no preternatural aids to\r\nacquire. An Old Bailey attorney could have got at the one, and any\r\nquick student of human hearts have readily mastered the other. In fine,\r\nMargrave, thus rationally criticised, is no other prodigy (save in\r\ndegree and concurrence of attributes simple, though not very common)\r\nthan may be found in each alley that harbours a fortune-teller who has\r\njust faith enough in the stars or the cards to bubble himself while he\r\nswindles his victims; earnest, indeed, in the self-conviction that he\r\nis really a seer, but reading the looks of his listeners, divining\r\nthe thoughts that induce them to listen, and acquiring by practice\r\na startling ability to judge what the listeners will deem it most\r\nseer-like to read in the cards or divine from the stars.\r\n\r\nI leave this interpretation unassailed. It is that which is the most\r\nprobable; it is clearly that which, in a case not my own, I should have\r\naccepted; and yet I revolved and dismissed it. The moment we deal\r\nwith things beyond our comprehension, and in which our own senses are\r\nappealed to and baffled, we revolt from the Probable, as it seems to\r\nthe senses of those who have not experienced what we have. And the same\r\nprinciple of Wonder that led our philosophy up from inert ignorance into\r\nrestless knowledge, now winding back into shadow land, reverses its\r\nrule by the way, and, at last, leaves us lost in the maze, our knowledge\r\ninert, and our ignorance restless.\r\n\r\nAnd putting aside all other reasons for hesitating to believe that\r\nMargrave was the son of Louis Grayle,--reasons which his own narrative\r\nmight suggest,--was it not strange that Sir Philip Derval, who had\r\ninstituted inquiries so minute, and reported them in his memoir with so\r\nfaithful a care, should not have discovered that a youth, attended by\r\nthe same woman who had attended Grayle, had disappeared from the town\r\non the same night as Grayle himself disappeared? But Derval had related\r\ntruthfully, according to Margrave’s account, the flight of Ayesha and\r\nher Indian servant, yet not alluded to the flight, not even to the\r\nexistence of the boy, who must have been of no mean importance in the\r\nsuite of Louis Grayle, if he were, indeed, the son whom Grayle had made\r\nhis constant companion, and constituted his principal heir. Not many\r\nminutes did I give myself up to the cloud of reflections through which\r\nno sunbeam of light forced its way. One thought overmastered all;\r\nMargrave had threatened death to my Lilian, and warned me of what I\r\nshould learn from the lips of Faber, “the sage of the college.” I stood,\r\nshuddering, at the door of my home; I did not dare to enter.\r\n\r\n“Allen,” said a voice, in which my ear detected the unwonted tremulous\r\nfaltering, “be firm,--be calm. I keep my promise. The hour is come in\r\nwhich you may again see the Lilian of old, mind to mind, soul to soul.”\r\n\r\nFaber’s hand took mine, and led me into the house.\r\n\r\n“You do, then, fear that this interview will be too much for her\r\nstrength?” said I, whisperingly.\r\n\r\n“I cannot say; but she demands the interview, and I dare not refuse it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nI left Faber on the stairs, and paused at the door of Lilian’s room. The\r\ndoor opened suddenly, noiselessly, and her mother came out with one hand\r\nbefore her face, and the other locked in Amy’s, who was leading her as a\r\nchild leads the blind. Mrs. Ashleigh looked up, as I touched her, with\r\na vacant, dreary stare. She was not weeping, as was her womanly wont in\r\nevery pettier grief, but Amy was. No word was exchanged between us. I\r\nentered, and closed the door; my eyes turned mechanically to the corner\r\nin which was placed the small virgin bed, with its curtains white as a\r\nshroud. Lilian was not there. I looked around, and saw her half reclined\r\non a couch near the window. She was dressed, and with care. Was not that\r\nher bridal robe?\r\n\r\n“Allen! Allen!” she murmured. “Again, again my Allen--again, again your\r\nLilian!” And, striving in vain to rise, she stretched out her arms in\r\nthe yearning of reunited love. And as I knelt beside her, those arms\r\nclosed round me for the first time in the frank, chaste, holy tenderness\r\nof a wife’s embrace.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she said, in her low voice (her voice, like Cordelia’s, was ever\r\nlow), “all has come back to me,--all that I owe to your protecting,\r\nnoble, trustful, guardian love!”\r\n\r\n“Hush! hush! the gratitude rests with me; it is so sweet to love, to\r\ntrust, to guard! my own, my beautiful--still my beautiful! Suffering has\r\nnot dimmed the light of those dear eyes to me! Put your lips to my\r\near. Whisper but these words: ‘I love you, and for your sake I wish to\r\nlive.’”\r\n\r\n“For your sake, I pray--with my whole weak human heart--I pray to live!\r\nListen. Some day hereafter, if I am spared, under the purple blossoms\r\nof yonder waving trees I shall tell you all, as I see it now; all that\r\ndarkened or shone on me in my long dream, and before the dream closed\r\naround me, like a night in which cloud and star chase each other! Some\r\nday hereafter, some quiet, sunlit, happy, happy day! But now, all I\r\nwould say is this: Before that dreadful morning--” Here she paused,\r\nshuddered, and passionately burst forth, “Allen, Allen! you did\r\nnot believe that slanderous letter! God bless you! God bless you!\r\nGreat-hearted, high-souled--God bless you, my darling! my husband! And\r\nHe will! Pray to Him humbly as I do, and He will bless you.” She\r\nstooped and kissed away my tears; then she resumed, feebly, meekly,\r\nsorrowfully,--\r\n\r\n“Before that morning I was not worthy of such a heart, such a love as\r\nyours. No, no; hear me. Not that a thought of love for another ever\r\ncrossed me! Never, while conscious and reasoning, was I untrue to you,\r\neven in fancy. But I was a child,--wayward as the child who pines for\r\nwhat earth cannot give, and covets the moon for a toy. Heaven had been\r\nso kind to my lot on earth, and yet with my lot on earth I was secretly\r\ndiscontented. When I felt that you loved me, and my heart told me that I\r\nloved again, I said to myself, ‘Now the void that my soul finds on\r\nearth will be filled.’ I longed for your coming, and yet when you went\r\nI murmured, ‘But is this the ideal of which I have dreamed?’ I asked\r\nfor an impossible sympathy. Sympathy with what? Nay, smile on me,\r\ndearest!--sympathy with what? I could not have said. Ah, Allen, then,\r\nthen, I was not worthy of you! Infant that I was, I asked you to\r\nunderstand me: now I know that I am a woman, and my task is to study\r\nyou. Do I make myself clear? Do you forgive me? I was not untrue to you;\r\nI was untrue to my own duties in life. I believed, in my vain conceit,\r\nthat a mortal’s dim vision of heaven raised me above the earth; I did\r\nnot perceive the truth that earth is a part of the same universe as\r\nheaven! Now, perhaps, in the awful affliction that darkened my reason,\r\nmy soul has been made more clear. As if to chastise but to teach me, my\r\nsoul has been permitted to indulge its own presumptuous desire; it has\r\nwandered forth from the trammels of mortal duties and destinies; it\r\ncomes back, alarmed by the dangers of its own rash and presumptuous\r\nescape from the tasks which it should desire upon earth to perform.\r\nAllen, Allen, I am less unworthy of you now! Perhaps in my darkness one\r\nrapid glimpse of the true world of spirit has been vouchsafed to me.\r\nIf so, how unlike to the visions my childhood indulged as divine! Now,\r\nwhile I know still more deeply that there is a world for the angels, I\r\nknow, also, that the mortal must pass through probation in the world of\r\nmortals. Oh, may I pass through it with you, grieving in your griefs,\r\nrejoicing in your joy!”\r\n\r\nHere language failed her. Again the dear arms embraced me, and the dear\r\nface, eloquent with love, hid itself on my human breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\nThat interview is over! Again I am banished from Lilian’s room; the\r\nagitation, the joy of that meeting has overstrained her enfeebled\r\nnerves. Convulsive tremblings of the whole frame, accompanied with\r\nvehement sobs, succeeded our brief interchange of sweet and bitter\r\nthoughts. Faber, in tearing me from her side, imperiously and sternly\r\nwarned me that the sole chance yet left of preserving her life was in\r\nthe merciful suspense of the emotions that my presence excited. He\r\nand Amy resumed their place in her chamber. Even her mother shared my\r\nsentence of banishment. So Mrs. Ashleigh and I sat facing each other in\r\nthe room below; over me a leaden stupor had fallen, and I heard, as a\r\nvoice from afar or in a dream, the mother’s murmured wailings,\r\n\r\n“She will die! she will die! Her eyes have the same heavenly look as my\r\nGilbert’s on the day on which his closed forever. Her very words are his\r\nlast words,--‘Forgive me all my faults to you.’ She will die! she will\r\ndie!”\r\n\r\nHours thus passed away. At length Faber entered the room; he spoke first\r\nto Mrs. Ashleigh,--meaningless soothings, familiar to the lips of all\r\nwho pass from the chamber of the dying to the presence of mourners, and\r\nknow that it is a falsehood to say “hope,” and a mockery as yet, to say,\r\n“endure.”\r\n\r\nBut he led her away to her own room, docile as a wearied child led to\r\nsleep, stayed with her some time, and then returned to me, pressing me\r\nto his breast father-like.\r\n\r\n“No hope! no hope!” said I, recoiling from his embrace. “You are silent.\r\nSpeak! speak! Let me know the worst.”\r\n\r\n“I have a hope, yet I scarcely dare to bid you share it; for it grows\r\nrather out of my heart as man than my experience as physician. I cannot\r\nthink that her soul would be now so reconciled to earth, so fondly, so\r\nearnestly, cling to this mortal life, if it were about to be summoned\r\naway. You know how commonly even the sufferers who have dreaded death\r\nthe most become calmly resigned to its coming, when death visibly\r\nreveals itself out from the shadows in which its shape has been guessed\r\nand not seen. As it is a bad sign for life when the patient has lost all\r\nwill to live on, so there is hope while the patient, yet young and with\r\nno perceptible breach in the great centres of life (however violently\r\ntheir forts may be stormed), has still intense faith in recovery,\r\nperhaps drawn (who can say?) from the whispers conveyed from above to\r\nthe soul.\r\n\r\n“I cannot bring myself to think that all the uses for which a reason,\r\nalways so lovely even in its errors, has been restored, are yet\r\nfulfilled. It seems to me as if your union, as yet so imperfect, has\r\nstill for its end that holy life on earth by which two mortal beings\r\nstrengthen each other for a sphere of existence to which this is the\r\nspiritual ladder. Through yourself I have hope yet for her. Gifted with\r\npowers that rank you high in the manifold orders of man,--thoughtful,\r\nlaborious, and brave; with a heart that makes intellect vibrate to every\r\nfine touch of humanity; in error itself, conscientious; in delusion,\r\nstill eager for truth; in anger, forgiving; in wrong, seeking how to\r\nrepair; and, best of all, strong in a love which the mean would have\r\nshrunk to defend from the fangs of the slanderer,--a love, raising\r\npassion itself out of the realm of the senses, made sublime by the\r\nsorrows that tried its devotion,--with all these noble proofs in\r\nyourself of a being not meant to end here, your life has stopped short\r\nin its uses, your mind itself has been drifted, a bark without rudder\r\nor pilot, over seas without shore, under skies without stars. And\r\nwherefore? Because the mind you so haughtily vaunted has refused its\r\ncompanion and teacher in Soul.\r\n\r\n“And therefore, through you, I hope that she will be spared yet to live\r\non; she, in whom soul has been led dimly astray, by unheeding the checks\r\nand the definite goals which the mind is ordained to prescribe to its\r\nwanderings while here; the mind taking thoughts from the actual and\r\nvisible world, and the soul but vague glimpses and hints from the\r\ninstinct of its ultimate heritage. Each of you two seems to me as yet\r\nincomplete, and your destinies yet uncompleted. Through the bonds of\r\nthe heart, through the trials of time, ye have both to consummate your\r\nmarriage. I do not--believe me--I do not say this in the fanciful wisdom\r\nof allegory and type, save that, wherever deeply examined, allegory and\r\ntype run through all the most commonplace phases of outward and material\r\nlife. I hope, then, that she may yet be spared to you; hope it, not from\r\nmy skill as physician, but my inward belief as a Christian. To perfect\r\nyour own being and end, ‘Ye will need one another!’”\r\n\r\nI started--the very words that Lilian had heard in her vision!\r\n\r\n“But,” resumed Faber, “how can I presume to trace the numberless links\r\nof effect up to the First Cause, far off--oh; far off--out of the scope\r\nof my reason. I leave that to philosophers, who would laugh my meek hope\r\nto scorn. Possibly, probably, where I, whose calling has been but to\r\nsave flesh from the worm, deem that the life of your Lilian is needed\r\nyet, to develop and train your own convictions of soul, Heaven in its\r\nwisdom may see that her death would instruct you far more than her life.\r\nI have said, Be prepared for either,--wisdom through joy, or wisdom\r\nthrough grief. Enough that, looking only through the mechanism by which\r\nthis moral world is impelled and improved, you know that cruelty is\r\nimpossible to wisdom. Even a man, or man’s law, is never wise but when\r\nmerciful. But mercy has general conditions; and that which is mercy to\r\nthe myriads may seem hard to the one, and that which seems hard to the\r\none in the pang of a moment may be mercy when viewed by the eye that\r\nlooks on through eternity.”\r\n\r\nAnd from all this discourse--of which I now, at calm distance of time,\r\nrecall every word--my human, loving heart bore away for the moment but\r\nthis sentence, “Ye will need one another;” so that I cried out,\r\n“Life, life, life! Is there no hope for her life? Have you no hope as\r\nphysician? I am a physician, too; I will see her. I will judge. I will\r\nnot be banished from my post.”\r\n\r\n“Judge, then, as physician, and let the responsibility rest with you. At\r\nthis moment, all convulsion, all struggle, has ceased; the frame is\r\nat rest. Look on her, and perhaps only the physician’s eye could\r\ndistinguish her state from death. It is not sleep, it is not trance, it\r\nis not the dooming coma from which there is no awaking. Shall I call it\r\nby the name received in our schools? Is it the catalepsy in which life\r\nis suspended, but consciousness acute? She is motionless, rigid; it\r\nis but with a strain of my own sense that I know that the breath still\r\nbreathes, and the heart still beats. But I am convinced that though she\r\ncan neither speak, nor stir, nor give sign, she is fully, sensitively\r\nconscious of all that passes around her. She is like those who have seen\r\nthe very coffin carried into their chamber, and been unable to cry\r\nout, ‘Do not bury me alive!’ Judge then for yourself, with this intense\r\nconsciousness and this impotence to evince it, what might be the effect\r\nof your presence,--first an agony of despair, and then the complete\r\nextinction of life!”\r\n\r\n“I have known but one such case,--a mother whose heart was wrapped up in\r\na suffering infant. She had lain for two days and two nights, still, as\r\nif in her shroud. All save myself said, ‘Life is gone.’ I said, ‘Life\r\nstill is there.’ They brought in the infant, to try what effect its\r\npresence would produce; then her lips moved, and the hands crossed upon\r\nher bosom trembled.”\r\n\r\n“And the result?” exclaimed Faber, eagerly. “If the result of your\r\nexperience sanction your presence, come; the sight of the babe rekindled\r\nlife?”\r\n\r\n“No; extinguished its last spark! I will not enter Lilian’s room. I will\r\ngo away,--away from the house itself. That acute consciousness! I know\r\nit well! She may even hear me move in the room below, hear me speak at\r\nthis moment. Go back to her, go back! But if hers be the state which I\r\nhave known in another, which may be yet more familiar to persons of far\r\nampler experience than mine, there is no immediate danger of death. The\r\nstate will last through to-day, through to-night, perhaps for days to\r\ncome. Is it so?”\r\n\r\n“I believe that for at least twelve hours there will be no change in her\r\nstate. I believe also that if she recover from it, calm and refreshed,\r\nas from a sleep, the danger of death will have passed away.”\r\n\r\n“And for twelve hours my presence would be hurtful?”\r\n\r\n“Rather say fatal, if my diagnosis be right.”\r\n\r\nI wrung my friend’s hand, and we parted.\r\n\r\nOh, to lose her now!--now that her love and her reason had both\r\nreturned, each more vivid than before! Futile, indeed, might be\r\nMargrave’s boasted secret; but at least in that secret was hope. In\r\nrecognized science I saw only despair.\r\n\r\nAnd at that thought all dread of this mysterious visitor vanished,--all\r\nanxiety to question more of his attributes or his history. His life\r\nitself became to me dear and precious. What if it should fail me in the\r\nsteps of the process, whatever that was, by which the life of my Lilian\r\nmight be saved!\r\n\r\nThe shades of evening were now closing in. I remembered that I had left\r\nMargrave without even food for many hours. I stole round to the back of\r\nthe house, filled a basket with elements more generous than those of\r\nthe former day; extracted fresh drugs from my stores, and, thus laden,\r\nhurried back to the hut. I found Margrave in the room below, seated on\r\nhis mysterious coffer, leaning his face on his hand. When I entered, he\r\nlooked up, and said,--\r\n\r\n“You have neglected me. My strength is waning. Give me more of the\r\ncordial, for we have work before us to-night, and I need support.”\r\n\r\nHe took for granted my assent to his wild experiment; and he was right.\r\n\r\nI administered the cordial. I placed food before him, and this time\r\nhe did not eat with repugnance. I poured out wine, and he drank it\r\nsparingly, but with ready compliance, saying, “In perfect health, I\r\nlooked upon wine as poison; now it is like a foretaste of the glorious\r\nelixir.”\r\n\r\nAfter he had thus recruited himself, he seemed to acquire an energy\r\nthat startlingly contrasted his languor the day before; the effort of\r\nbreathing was scarcely perceptible; the colour came back to his cheeks;\r\nhis bended frame rose elastic and erect.\r\n\r\n“If I understood you rightly,” said I, “the experiment you ask me to aid\r\ncan be accomplished in a single night?”\r\n\r\n“In a single night,--this night.”\r\n\r\n“Command me. Why not begin at once? What apparatus or chemical agencies\r\ndo you need?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Margrave, “formerly, how I was misled! Formerly, how my\r\nconjectures blundered! I thought, when I asked you to give a month to\r\nthe experiment I wish to make, that I should need the subtlest skill of\r\nthe chemist. I then believed, with Van Helmont, that the principle of\r\nlife is a gas, and that the secret was but in the mode by which the gas\r\nmight be rightly administered. But now all that I need is contained\r\nin this coffer, save one very simple material,--fuel sufficient for a\r\nsteady fire for six hours. I see even that is at hand, piled up in your\r\nouthouse. And now for the substance itself,--to that you must guide me.”\r\n\r\n“Explain.”\r\n\r\n“Near this very spot is there not gold--in mines yet undiscovered?--and\r\ngold of the purest metal?”\r\n\r\n“There is. What then? Do you, with the alchemists, blend in one\r\ndiscovery gold and life?”\r\n\r\n“No. But it is only where the chemistry of earth or of man produces\r\ngold, that the substance from which the great pabulum of life is\r\nextracted by ferment can be found. Possibly, in the attempts at that\r\ntransmutation of metals, which I think your own great chemist, Sir\r\nHumphry Davy, allowed might be possible, but held not to be worth the\r\ncost of the process,--possibly, in those attempts, some scanty grains\r\nof this substance were found by the alchemists, in the crucible, with\r\ngrains of the metal as niggardly yielded by pitiful mimicry of Nature’s\r\nstupendous laboratory; and from such grains enough of the essence might,\r\nperhaps, have been drawn forth, to add a few years of existence to some\r\nfeeble graybeard,--granting, what rests on no proofs, that some of the\r\nalchemists reached an age rarely given to man. But it is not in the\r\nmiserly crucible, it is in the matrix of Nature herself, that we must\r\nseek in prolific abundance Nature’s grand principle,--life. As the\r\nloadstone is rife with the magnetic virtue, as amber contains the\r\nelectric, so in this substance, to which we yet want a name, is found\r\nthe bright life-giving fluid. In the old goldmines of Asia and Europe\r\nthe substance exists, but can rarely be met with. The soil for its\r\nnutriment may there be well-nigh exhausted. It is here, where Nature\r\nherself is all vital with youth, that the nutriment of youth must be\r\nsought. Near this spot is gold; guide me to it.”\r\n\r\n“You cannot come with me. The place which I know as auriferous is some\r\nmiles distant, the way rugged. You can not walk to it. It is true I have\r\nhorses, but--”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I have come this distance and not foreseen and forestalled\r\nall that I want for my object? Trouble your self not with conjectures\r\nhow I can arrive at the place. I have provided the means to arrive at\r\nand leave it. My litter and its bearers are in reach of my call. Give me\r\nyour arm to the rising ground, fifty yards from your door.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed mechanically, stifling all surprise. I had made my resolve, and\r\nadmitted no thought that could shake it. When we reached the summit of\r\nthe grassy hillock, which sloped from the road that led to the seaport,\r\nMargrave, after pausing to recover breath, lifted up his voice, in a\r\nkey, not loud, but shrill and slow and prolonged, half cry and half\r\nchant, like the nighthawk’s. Through the air--so limpid and still,\r\nbringing near far objects, far sounds--the voice pierced its way,\r\nartfully pausing, till wave after wave of the atmosphere bore and\r\ntransmitted it on.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the call seemed re-echoed, so exactly, so cheerily,\r\nthat for the moment I thought that the note was the mimicry of the shy\r\nmocking Lyre-Bird, which mimics so merrily all that it hears in its\r\ncoverts, from the whir of the locust to the howl of the wild dog.\r\n\r\n“What king,” said the mystical charmer, and as he spoke he carelessly\r\nrested his hand on my shoulder, so that I trembled to feel that this\r\ndread son of Nature, Godless and soulless, who had been--and, my heart\r\nwhispered, who still could be--my bane and mind-darkener, leaned upon\r\nme for support, as the spoilt younger-born on his brother,--“what king,”\r\n said this cynical mocker, with his beautiful boyish face,--“what king in\r\nyour civilized Europe has the sway of a chief of the East? What link is\r\nso strong between mortal and mortal, as that between lord and slave?\r\nI transport yon poor fools from the land of their birth; they preserve\r\nhere their old habits,--obedience and awe. They would wait till they\r\nstarved in the solitude,--wait to hearken and answer my call. And I, who\r\nthus rule them, or charm them--I use and despise them. They know that,\r\nand yet serve me! Between you and me, my philosopher, there is but one\r\nthing worth living for,--life for oneself.”\r\n\r\nIs it age, is it youth, that thus shocks all my sense, in my solemn\r\ncompleteness of man? Perhaps, in great capitals, young men of pleasure\r\nwill answer, “It is youth; and we think what he says!” Young friends, I\r\ndo not believe you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nAlong the grass-track I saw now, under the moon, just risen, a strange\r\nprocession, never seen before in Australian pastures. It moved on,\r\nnoiselessly but quickly. We descended the hillock, and met it on the\r\nway,--a sable litter, borne by four men, in unfamiliar Eastern\r\ngarments; two other servitors, more bravely dressed, with yataghans and\r\nsilver-hilted pistols in their belts, preceded this sombre equipage.\r\nPerhaps Margrave divined the disdainful thought that passed through my\r\nmind, vaguely and half-unconsciously; for he said, with a hollow, bitter\r\nlaugh that had replaced the lively peal of his once melodious mirth,--\r\n\r\n“A little leisure and a little gold, and your raw colonist, too, will\r\nhave the tastes of a pacha.”\r\n\r\nI made no answer. I had ceased to care who and what was my tempter. To\r\nme his whole being was resolved into one problem: Had he a secret by\r\nwhich death could be turned from Lilian?\r\n\r\nBut now, as the litter halted, from the long dark shadow which it cast\r\nupon the turf the figure of a woman emerged and stood before us. The\r\noutlines of her shape were lost in the loose folds of a black mantle,\r\nand the features of her face were hidden by a black veil, except only\r\nthe dark, bright, solemn eyes. Her stature was lofty, her bearing\r\nmajestic, whether in movement or repose.\r\n\r\nMargrave accosted her in some language unknown to me. She replied in\r\nwhat seemed to me the same tongue. The tones of her voice were sweet,\r\nbut inexpressibly mournful. The words that they uttered appeared\r\nintended to warn, or deprecate, or dissuade; but they called to\r\nMargrave’s brow a lowering frown, and drew from his lips a burst of\r\nunmistakable anger. The woman rejoined, in the same melancholy music of\r\nvoice. And Margrave then, leaning his arm upon her shoulder, as he had\r\nleaned it on mine, drew her away from the group into a neighbouring\r\ncopse of the flowering eucalypti,--mystic trees, never changing the hues\r\nof their pale-green leaves, ever shifting the tints of their ash-gray,\r\nshedding bark. For some moments I gazed on the two human forms, dimly\r\nseen by the glinting moonlight through the gaps in the foliage. Then\r\nturning away my eyes, I saw, standing close at my side, a man whom I had\r\nnot noticed before. His footstep, as it stole to me, had fallen on the\r\nsward without sound. His dress, though Oriental, differed from that of\r\nhis companions, both in shape and colour; fitting close to the breast,\r\nleaving the arms bare to the elbow, and of a uniform ghastly white, as\r\nare the cerements of the grave. His visage was even darker than those of\r\nthe Syrians or Arabs behind him, and his features were those of a bird\r\nof prey,--the beak of the eagle, but the eye of the vulture. His cheeks\r\nwere hollow; the arms, crossed on his breast, were long and fleshless.\r\nYet in that skeleton form there was a something which conveyed the idea\r\nof a serpent’s suppleness and strength; and as the hungry, watchful\r\neyes met my own startled gaze, I recoiled impulsively with that inward\r\nwarning of danger which is conveyed to man, as to inferior animals, in\r\nthe very aspect of the creatures that sting or devour. At my movement\r\nthe man inclined his head in the submissive Eastern salutation, and\r\nspoke in his foreign tongue, softly, humbly, fawningly, to judge by his\r\ntone and his gesture.\r\n\r\nI moved yet farther away from him with loathing, and now the human\r\nthought flashed upon me: was I, in truth, exposed to no danger in\r\ntrusting myself to the mercy of the weird and remorseless master of\r\nthose hirelings from the East,--seven men in number, two at least of\r\nthem formidably armed, and docile as bloodhounds to the hunter, who\r\nhas only to show them their prey? But fear of man like myself is not\r\nmy weakness; where fear found its way to my heart, it was through\r\nthe doubts or the fancies in which man like myself disappeared in the\r\nattributes, dark and unknown, which we give to a fiend or a spectre.\r\nAnd, perhaps, if I could have paused to analyze my own sensations, the\r\nvery presence of this escort-creatures of flesh and blood-lessened the\r\ndread of my incomprehensible tempter. Rather, a hundred times, front and\r\ndefy those seven Eastern slaves--I, haughty son of the Anglo-Saxon who\r\nconquers all races because he fears no odds--than have seen again on the\r\nwalls of my threshold the luminous, bodiless Shadow! Besides: Lilian!\r\nLilian! for one chance of saving her life, however wild and chimerical\r\nthat chance might be, I would have shrunk not a foot from the march of\r\nan army.\r\n\r\nThus reassured and thus resolved, I advanced, with a smile of disdain,\r\nto meet Margrave and his veiled companion, as they now came from the\r\nmoonlit copse.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said to him, with an irony that unconsciously mimicked his\r\nown, “have you taken advice with your nurse? I assume that the dark form\r\nby your side is that of Ayesha.”\r\n\r\nThe woman looked at me from her sable veil, with her steadfast solemn\r\neyes, and said, in English, though with a foreign accent: “The nurse\r\nborn in Asia is but wise through her love; the pale son of Europe\r\nis wise through his art. The nurse says, ‘Forbear!’ Do you say,\r\n‘Adventure’?”\r\n\r\n“Peace!” exclaimed Margrave, stamping his foot on the ground. “I take no\r\ncounsel from either; it is for me to resolve, for you to obey, and for\r\nhim to aid. Night is come, and we waste it; move on.”\r\n\r\nThe woman made no reply, nor did I. He took my arm and walked back to\r\nthe hut. The barbaric escort followed. When we reached the door of\r\nthe building, Margrave said a few words to the woman and to the\r\nlitter-bearers. They entered the hut with us. Margrave pointed out to\r\nthe woman his coffer, to the men the fuel stowed in the outhouse. Both\r\nwere borne away and placed within the litter. Meanwhile, I took from\r\nthe table, on which it was carelessly thrown, the light hatchet that I\r\nhabitually carried with me in my rambles.\r\n\r\n“Do you think that you need that idle weapon?” said Margrave. “Do you\r\nfear the good faith of my swarthy attendants?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, take the hatchet yourself; its use is to sever the gold from the\r\nquartz in which we may find it embedded, or to clear, as this shovel,\r\nwhich will also be needed, from the slight soil above it, the ore that\r\nthe mine in the mountain flings forth, as the sea casts its waifs on the\r\nsands.”\r\n\r\n“Give me your hand, fellow-labourer!” said Margrave, joyfully. “Ah,\r\nthere is no faltering terror in this pulse! I was not mistaken in the\r\nMan. What rests, but the Place and the Hour? I shall live! I shall\r\nlive!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\nMargrave now entered the litter, and the Veiled Woman drew the black\r\ncurtains round him. I walked on, as the guide, some yards in\r\nadvance. The air was still, heavy, and parched with the breath of the\r\nAustralasian sirocco.\r\n\r\nWe passed through the meadow-lands, studded with slumbering flocks; we\r\nfollowed the branch of the creek, which was linked to its source in\r\nthe mountains by many a trickling waterfall; we threaded the gloom of\r\nstunted, misshapen trees, gnarled with the stringy bark which makes one\r\nof the signs of the strata that nourish gold; and at length the moon,\r\nnow in all her pomp of light, mid-heaven amongst her subject stars,\r\ngleamed through the fissures of the cave, on whose floor lay the relics\r\nof antediluvian races, and rested in one flood of silvery splendour upon\r\nthe hollows of the extinct volcano, with tufts of dank herbage, and wide\r\nspaces of paler sward, covering the gold below,--Gold, the dumb symbol\r\nof organized Matter’s great mystery, storing in itself, according as\r\nMind, the informer of Matter, can distinguish its uses, evil and good,\r\nbane and blessing.\r\n\r\nHitherto the Veiled Woman had remained in the rear, with the\r\nwhite-robed, skeleton-like image that had crept to my side unawares with\r\nits noiseless step. Thus in each winding turn of the difficult path at\r\nwhich the convoy following behind me came into sight, I had seen, first,\r\nthe two gayly-dressed, armed men, next the black bier-like litter, and\r\nlast the Black-veiled Woman and the White-robed Skeleton.\r\n\r\nBut now, as I halted on the tableland, backed by the mountain and\r\nfronting the valley, the woman left her companion, passed by the litter\r\nand the armed men, and paused by my side, at the mouth of the moonlit\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nThere for a moment she stood, silent, the procession below mounting\r\nupward laboriously and slow; then she turned to me, and her veil was\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe face on which I gazed was wondrously beautiful, and severely awful.\r\nThere was neither youth nor age, but beauty, mature and majestic as that\r\nof a marble Demeter.\r\n\r\n“Do you believe in that which you seek?” she asked, in her foreign,\r\nmelodious, melancholy accents.\r\n\r\n“I have no belief,” was my answer. “True science has none. True science\r\nquestions all things, takes nothing upon credit. It knows but three\r\nstates of the mind,--Denial, Conviction, and that vast interval between\r\nthe two, which is not belief, but suspense of judgment.”\r\n\r\nThe woman let fall her veil, moved from me, and seated herself on a crag\r\nabove that cleft between mountain and creek, to which, when I had first\r\ndiscovered the gold that the land nourished, the rain from the clouds\r\nhad given the rushing life of the cataract; but which now, in the\r\ndrought and the hush of the skies, was but a dead pile of stones.\r\n\r\nThe litter now ascended the height: its bearers halted; a lean hand tore\r\nthe curtains aside, and Margrave descended, leaning, this time, not on\r\nthe Black-veiled Woman, but on the White-robed Skeleton.\r\n\r\nThere, as he stood, the moon shone full on his wasted form; on his\r\nface, resolute, cheerful, and proud, despite its hollowed outlines and\r\nsicklied hues. He raised his head, spoke in the language unknown to me,\r\nand the armed men and the litter-bearers grouped round him, bending low,\r\ntheir eyes fixed on the ground. The Veiled Woman rose slowly and came to\r\nhis side, motioning away, with a mute sign, the ghastly form on which he\r\nleaned, and passing round him silently, instead, her own sustaining arm.\r\nMargrave spoke again a few sentences, of which I could not even guess\r\nthe meaning. When he had concluded, the armed men and the litter-bearers\r\ncame nearer to his feet, knelt down, and kissed his hand. They then\r\nrose, and took from the bier-like vehicle the coffer and the fuel. This\r\ndone, they lifted again the litter, and again, preceded by the armed\r\nmen, the procession descended down the sloping hillside, down into the\r\nvalley below.\r\n\r\nMargrave now whispered, for some moments, into the ear of the hideous\r\ncreature who had made way for the Veiled Woman. The grim skeleton bowed\r\nhis head submissively, and strode noiselessly away through the long\r\ngrasses,--the slender stems, trampled under his stealthy feet, relifting\r\nthemselves, as after a passing wind. And thus he, too, sank out of sight\r\ndown into the valley below. On the tableland of the hill remained only\r\nwe three,--Margrave, myself, and the Veiled Woman.\r\n\r\nShe had reseated herself apart, on the gray crag above the dried\r\ntorrent. He stood at the entrance of the cavern, round the sides of\r\nwhich clustered parasital plants, with flowers of all colours, some\r\namongst them opening their petals and exhaling their fragrance only in\r\nthe hours of night; so that, as his form filled up the jaws of the dull\r\narch, obscuring the moonbeam that strove to pierce the shadows that\r\nslept within, it stood now--wan and blighted--as I had seen it first,\r\nradiant and joyous, literally “framed in blooms.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\n “So,” said Margrave, turning to me, “under the soil that spreads around us lies the gold which to you and to me is at this moment of no value, except as a guide to its twin-born,--the regenerator of life!”\r\n\r\n“You have not yet described to me the nature of the substance which we\r\nare to explore, nor of the process by which the virtues you impute to it\r\nare to be extracted.”\r\n\r\n“Let us first find the gold, and instead of describing the life-amber,\r\nso let me call it, I will point it out to your own eyes. As to the\r\nprocess, your share in it is so simple, that you will ask me why I seek\r\naid from a chemist. The life-amber, when found, has but to be subjected\r\nto heat and fermentation for six hours; it will be placed, in a small\r\ncaldron which that coffer contains, over the fire which that fuel\r\nwill feed. To give effect to the process, certain alkalies and other\r\ningredients are required; but these are prepared, and mine is the task\r\nto commingle them. From your science as chemist I need and ask nought.\r\nIn you I have sought only the aid of a man.”\r\n\r\n“If that be so, why, indeed, seek me at all? Why not confide in those\r\nswarthy attendants, who doubtless are slaves to your orders?”\r\n\r\n“Confide in slaves! when the first task enjoined to them would be to\r\ndiscover, and refrain from purloining gold! Seven such unscrupulous\r\nknaves, or even one such, and I, thus defenceless and feeble! Such is\r\nnot the work that wise masters confide to fierce slaves. But that is\r\nthe least of the reasons which exclude them from my choice, and fix my\r\nchoice of assistant on you. Do you forget what I told you of the danger\r\nwhich the Dervish declared no bribe I could offer could tempt him a\r\nsecond time to brave?”\r\n\r\n“I remember now; those words had passed away from my mind.”\r\n\r\n“And because they had passed away from your mind, I chose you for my\r\ncomrade. I need a man by whom danger is scorned.”\r\n\r\n“But in the process of which you tell me I see no possible danger unless\r\nthe ingredients you mix in your caldron have poisonous fumes.”\r\n\r\n“It is not that. The ingredients I use are not poisons.”\r\n\r\n“What other danger, except you dread your own Eastern slaves? But, if\r\nso, why lead them to these solitudes; and, if so, why not bid me be\r\narmed?”\r\n\r\n“The Eastern slaves, fulfilling my commands, wait for my summons where\r\ntheir eyes cannot see what we do. The danger is of a kind in which\r\nthe boldest son of the East would be more craven, perhaps, than the\r\ndaintiest Sybarite of Europe, who would shrink from a panther and laugh\r\nat a ghost. In the creed of the Dervish, and of all who adventure into\r\nthat realm of nature which is closed to philosophy and open to magic,\r\nthere are races in the magnitude of space unseen as animalcules in the\r\nworld of a drop. For the tribes of the drop, science has its microscope.\r\nOf the host of yon azure Infinite magic gains sight, and through them\r\ngains command over fluid conductors that link all the parts of creation.\r\nOf these races, some are wholly indifferent to man, some benign to him,\r\nand some dreadly hostile. In all the regular and prescribed conditions\r\nof mortal being, this magic realm seems as blank and tenantless as yon\r\nvacant air. But when a seeker of powers beyond the rude functions by\r\nwhich man plies the clockwork that measures his hours, and stops when\r\nits chain reaches the end of its coil, strives to pass over those\r\nboundaries at which philosophy says, ‘Knowledge ends,’--then he is like\r\nall other travellers in regions unknown; he must propitiate or brave the\r\ntribes that are hostile,--must depend for his life on the tribes that\r\nare friendly. Though your science discredits the alchemist’s dogmas,\r\nyour learning informs you that all alchemists were not ignorant\r\nimpostors; yet those whose discoveries prove them to have been the\r\nnearest allies to your practical knowledge, ever hint in their mystical\r\nworks at the reality of that realm which is open to magic,--ever hint\r\nthat some means less familiar than furnace and bellows are essential\r\nto him who explores the elixir of life. He who once quaffs that elixir,\r\nobtains in his very veins the bright fluid by which he transmits the\r\nforce of his will to agencies dormant in nature, to giants unseen in the\r\nspace. And here, as he passes the boundary which divides his allotted\r\nand normal mortality from the regions and races that magic alone can\r\nexplore, so, here, he breaks down the safeguard between himself and the\r\ntribes that are hostile. Is it not ever thus between man and man? Let a\r\nrace the most gentle and timid and civilized dwell on one side a river\r\nor mountain, and another have home in the region beyond, each, if it\r\npass not the intervening barrier, may with each live in peace. But\r\nif ambitious adventurers scale the mountain, or cross the river, with\r\ndesign to subdue and enslave the population they boldly invade, then\r\nall the invaded arise in wrath and defiance,--the neighbours are changed\r\ninto foes. And therefore this process--by which a simple though rare\r\nmaterial of nature is made to yield to a mortal the boon of a life which\r\nbrings, with its glorious resistance to Time, desires and faculties to\r\nsubject to its service beings that dwell in the earth and the air and\r\nthe deep--has ever been one of the same peril which an invader must\r\nbrave when he crosses the bounds of his nation. By this key alone you\r\nunlock all the cells of the alchemist’s lore; by this alone understand\r\nhow a labour, which a chemist’s crudest apprentice could perform, has\r\nbaffled the giant fathers of all your dwarfed children of science.\r\nNature, that stores this priceless boon, seems to shrink from conceding\r\nit to man; the invisible tribes that abhor him, oppose themselves to\r\nthe gain that might give them a master. The duller of those who were\r\nthe life-seekers of old would have told you how some chance,\r\ntrivial, unlooked-for, foiled their grand hope at the very point of\r\nfruition,--some doltish mistake, some improvident oversight, a defect\r\nin the sulphur, a wild overflow in the quicksilver, or a flaw in the\r\nbellows, or a pupil who failed to replenish the fuel, by falling asleep\r\nby the furnace. The invisible foes seldom vouchsafe to make themselves\r\nvisible where they can frustrate the bungler, as they mock at his toils\r\nfrom their ambush. But the mightier adventurers, equally foiled in\r\ndespite of their patience and skill, would have said, ‘Not with us rests\r\nthe fault; we neglected no caution, we failed from no oversight. But out\r\nfrom the caldron dread faces arose, and the spectres or demons dismayed\r\nand baffled us.’ Such, then, is the danger which seems so appalling to\r\na son of the East, as it seemed to a seer in the dark age of Europe. But\r\nwe can deride all its threats, you and I. For myself, I own frankly I\r\ntake all the safety that the charms and resources of magic bestow. You,\r\nfor your safety, have the cultured and disciplined reason which reduces\r\nall fantasies to nervous impressions; and I rely on the courage of one\r\nwho has questioned, unquailing, the Luminous Shadow, and wrested from\r\nthe hand of the magician himself the wand which concentred the wonders\r\nof will!”\r\n\r\nTo this strange and long discourse I listened without interruption, and\r\nnow quietly answered,--\r\n\r\n“I do not merit the trust you affect in my courage; but I am now on my\r\nguard against the cheats of the fancy, and the fumes of a vapour can\r\nscarcely bewilder the brain in the open air of this mountain-land. I\r\nbelieve in no races like those which you tell me lie viewless in space,\r\nas do gases. I believe not in magic; I ask not its aids, and I dread not\r\nits terrors. For the rest, I am confident of one mournful courage,--the\r\ncourage that comes from despair. I submit to your guidance, whatever it\r\nbe, as a sufferer whom colleges doom to the grave submits to the quack\r\nwho says, ‘Take my specific and live!’ My life is nought in itself; my\r\nlife lives in another. You and I are both brave from despair; you would\r\nturn death from yourself, I would turn death from one I love more than\r\nmyself. Both know how little aid we can win from the colleges, and both,\r\ntherefore, turn to the promises most audaciously cheering. Dervish or\r\nmagician, alchemist or phantom, what care you and I? And if they fail\r\nus, what then? They cannot fail us more than the colleges do!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\nThe gold has been gained with an easy labour. I knew where to seek for\r\nit, whether under the turf or in the bed of the creek. But Margrave’s\r\neyes, hungrily gazing round every spot from which the ore was disburied,\r\ncould not detect the substance of which he alone knew the outward\r\nappearance. I had begun to believe that, even in the description given\r\nto him of this material, he had been credulously duped, and that no such\r\nmaterial existed, when, coming back from the bed of the watercourse, I\r\nsaw a faint yellow gleam amidst the roots of a giant parasite plant, the\r\nleaves and blossoms of which climbed up the sides of the cave with its\r\nantediluvian relics. The gleam was the gleam of gold, and on removing\r\nthe loose earth round the roots of the plant, we came on--No, I will\r\nnot, I dare not, describe it. The gold-digger would cast it aside,\r\nthe naturalist would pause not to heed it; and did I describe it, and\r\nchemistry deign to subject it to analysis, could chemistry alone detach\r\nor discover its boasted virtues?\r\n\r\nIts particles, indeed, are very minute, not seeming readily to\r\ncrystallize with each other; each in itself of uniform shape and size,\r\nspherical as the egg which contains the germ of life, and small as the\r\negg from which the life of an insect may quicken.\r\n\r\nBut Margrave’s keen eye caught sight of the atoms upcast by the light\r\nof the moon. He exclaimed to me, “Found! I shall live!” And then, as he\r\ngathered up the grains with tremulous hands, he called out to the Veiled\r\nWoman, hitherto still seated motionless on the crag. At his word she\r\nrose and went to the place hard by, where the fuel was piled, busying\r\nherself there. I had no leisure to heed her. I continued my search in\r\nthe soft and yielding soil that time and the decay of vegetable life had\r\naccumulated over the Pre-Adamite strata on which the arch of the cave\r\nrested its mighty keystone.\r\n\r\nWhen we had collected of these particles about thrice as much as a\r\nman might hold in his hand, we seemed to have exhausted their bed. We\r\ncontinued still to find gold, but no more of the delicate substance, to\r\nwhich, in our sight, gold was as dross.\r\n\r\n“Enough,” then said Margrave, reluctantly desisting. “What we have\r\ngained already will suffice for a life thrice as long as legend\r\nattributes to Haroun. I shall live,--I shall live through the\r\ncenturies.”\r\n\r\n“Forget not that I claim my share.”\r\n\r\n“Your share--yours! True--your half of my life! It is true.” He paused\r\nwith a low, ironical, malignant laugh; and then added, as he rose and\r\nturned away, “But the work is yet to be done.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\nWhile we had thus laboured and found, Ayesha had placed the fuel where\r\nthe moonlight fell fullest on the sward of the tableland,--a part of it\r\nalready piled as for a fire, the rest of it heaped confusedly close at\r\nhand; and by the pile she had placed the coffer. And there she stood,\r\nher arms folded under her mantle, her dark image seeming darker still\r\nas the moonlight whitened all the ground from which the image rose\r\nmotionless. Margrave opened his coffer, the Veiled Woman did not aid\r\nhim, and I watched in silence, while he as silently made his weird and\r\nwizard-like preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\r\n\r\nOn the ground a wide circle was traced by a small rod, tipped apparently\r\nwith sponge saturated with some combustible naphtha-like fluid, so that\r\na pale lambent flame followed the course of the rod as Margrave guided\r\nit, burning up the herbage over which it played, and leaving a distinct\r\nring, like that which, in our lovely native fable-talk, we call the\r\n“Fairy’s Ring,” but yet more visible because marked in phosphorescent\r\nlight. On the ring thus formed were placed twelve small lamps, fed with\r\nthe fluid from the same vessel, and lighted by the same rod. The light\r\nemitted by the lamps was more vivid and brilliant than that which\r\ncircled round the ring.\r\n\r\nWithin the circumference, and immediately round the woodpile, Margrave\r\ntraced certain geometrical figures, in which--not without a shudder,\r\nthat I overcame at once by a strong effort of will in murmuring to\r\nmyself the name of “Lilian”--I recognized the interlaced triangles which\r\nmy own hand, in the spell enforced on a sleep-walker, had described on\r\nthe floor of the wizard’s pavilion. The figures were traced, like the\r\ncircle, in flame, and at the point of each triangle (four in number) was\r\nplaced a lamp, brilliant as those on the ring. This task performed, the\r\ncaldron, based on an iron tripod, was placed on the wood-pile. And then\r\nthe woman, before inactive and unheeding, slowly advanced, knelt by the\r\npile, and lighted it. The dry wood crackled and the flame burst forth,\r\nlicking the rims of the caldron with tongues of fire.\r\n\r\nMargrave flung into the caldron the particles we had collected, poured\r\nover them first a liquid, colourless as water, from the largest of the\r\nvessels drawn from his coffer, and then, more sparingly, drops from\r\nsmall crystal phials, like the phials I had seen in the hand of Philip\r\nDerval.\r\n\r\nHaving surmounted my first impulse of awe, I watched these proceedings,\r\ncurious yet disdainful, as one who watches the mummeries of an enchanter\r\non the stage.\r\n\r\n“If,” thought I, “these are but artful devices to inebriate and fool my\r\nown imagination, my imagination is on its guard, and reason shall not,\r\nthis time, sleep at her post!”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Margrave, “I consign to you the easy task by which\r\nyou are to merit your share of the elixir. It is my task to feed and\r\nreplenish the caldron; it is Ayesha’s to heed the fire, which must not\r\nfor a moment relax in its measured and steady heat. Your task is the\r\nlightest of all it is but to renew from this vessel the fluid that burns\r\nin the lamps, and on the ring. Observe, the contents of the vessel must\r\nbe thriftily husbanded; there is enough, but not more than enough, to\r\nsustain the light in the lamps, on the lines traced round the caldron,\r\nand on the farther ring, for six hours. The compounds dissolved in this\r\nfluid are scarce,--only obtainable in the East, and even in the East\r\nmonths might have passed before I could have increased my supply.\r\n\r\n“I had no months to waste. Replenish, then, the light only when it\r\nbegins to flicker or fade. Take heed, above all, that no part of the\r\nouter ring--no, not an inch--and no lamp of the twelve, that are to its\r\nzodiac like stars, fade for one moment in darkness.”\r\n\r\nI took the crystal vessel from his hand.\r\n\r\n“The vessel is small,” said I, “and what is yet left of its contents is\r\nbut scanty; whether its drops suffice to replenish the lights I cannot\r\nguess,--I can but obey your instructions. But, more important by far\r\nthan the light to the lamps and the circle, which in Asia or Africa\r\nmight scare away the wild beasts unknown to this land--more important\r\nthan light to a lamp, is the strength to your frame, weak magician! What\r\nwill support you through six weary hours of night-watch?”\r\n\r\n“Hope,” answered Margrave, with a ray of his old dazzling style. “Hope!\r\nI shall live,--I shall live through the centuries!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\r\n\r\nOne hour passed away; the fagots under the caldron burned clear in\r\nthe sullen sultry air. The materials within began to seethe, and their\r\ncolour, at first dull and turbid, changed into a pale-rose hue; from\r\ntime to time the Veiled Woman replenished the fire, after she had done\r\nso reseating herself close by the pyre, with her head bowed over her\r\nknees, and her face hid under her veil.\r\n\r\nThe lights in the lamps and along the ring and the triangles now began\r\nto pale. I resupplied their nutriment from the crystal vessel. As\r\nyet nothing strange startled my eye or my ear beyond the rim of the\r\ncircle,--nothing audible, save, at a distance, the musical wheel-like\r\nclick of the locusts, and, farther still, in the forest, the howl of\r\nthe wild dogs, that never bark; nothing visible, but the trees and the\r\nmountain-range girding the plains silvered by the moon, and the arch of\r\nthe cavern, the flush of wild blooms on its sides, and the gleam of dry\r\nbones on its floor, where the moonlight shot into the gloom.\r\n\r\nThe second hour passed like the first. I had taken my stand by the side\r\nof Margrave, watching with him the process at work in the caldron, when\r\nI felt the ground slightly vibrate beneath my feet, and, looking up,\r\nit seemed as if all the plains beyond the circle were heaving like the\r\nswell of the sea, and as if in the air itself there was a perceptible\r\ntremor.\r\n\r\nI placed my hand on Margrave’s shoulder and whispered, “To me earth and\r\nair seem to vibrate. Do they seem to vibrate to you?”\r\n\r\n“I know not, I care not,” he answered impetuously. “The essence is\r\nbursting the shell that confined it. Here are my air and my earth!\r\nTrouble me not. Look to the circle! feed the lamps if they fail.”\r\n\r\nI passed by the Veiled Woman as I walked towards a place in the ring in\r\nwhich the flame was waning dim; and I whispered to her the same question\r\nwhich I had whispered to Margrave. She looked slowly around, and\r\nanswered, “So is it before the Invisible make themselves visible! Did\r\nI not bid him forbear?” Her head again drooped on her breast, and her\r\nwatch was again fixed on the fire.\r\n\r\nI advanced to the circle and stooped to replenish the light where it\r\nwaned. As I did so, on my arm, which stretched somewhat beyond the line\r\nof the ring, I felt a shock like that of electricity. The arm fell to\r\nmy side numbed and nerveless, and from my hand dropped, but within the\r\nring, the vessel that contained the fluid. Recovering my surprise or my\r\nstun, hastily with the other hand I caught up the vessel, but some of\r\nthe scanty liquid was already spilled on the sward; and I saw with a\r\nthrill of dismay, that contrasted indeed the tranquil indifference with\r\nwhich I had first undertaken my charge, how small a supply was now left.\r\n\r\nI went back to Margrave, and told him of the shock, and of its\r\nconsequence in the waste of the liquid.\r\n\r\n“Beware,” said he, “that not a motion of the arm, not an inch of the\r\nfoot, pass the verge of the ring; and if the fluid be thus unhappily\r\nstinted, reserve all that is left for the protecting circle and the\r\ntwelve outer lamps! See how the Grand Work advances! how the hues in the\r\ncaldron are glowing blood-red through the film on the surface!”\r\n\r\nAnd now four hours of the six were gone; my arm had gradually recovered\r\nits strength. Neither the ring nor the lamps had again required\r\nreplenishing; perhaps their light was exhausted less quickly, as it\r\nwas no longer to be exposed to the rays of the intense Australian moon.\r\nClouds had gathered over the sky, and though the moon gleamed at times\r\nin the gaps that they left in blue air, her beam was more hazy and\r\ndulled. The locusts no longer were heard in the grass, nor the howl of\r\nthe dogs in the forest. Out of the circle, the stillness was profound.\r\n\r\nAnd about this time I saw distinctly in the distance a vast Eye! It drew\r\nnearer and nearer, seeming to move from the ground at the height of some\r\nlofty giant. Its gaze riveted mine; my blood curdled in the blaze from\r\nits angry ball; and now as it advanced larger and larger, other Eyes, as\r\nif of giants in its train, grew out from the space in its rear; numbers\r\non numbers, like the spearheads of some Eastern army, seen afar by pale\r\nwarders of battlements doomed to the dust. My voice long refused an\r\nutterance to my awe; at length it burst forth shrill and loud,--\r\n\r\n“Look! look! Those terrible Eyes! Legions on legions! And hark! that\r\ntramp of numberless feet; they are not seen, but the hollows of earth\r\necho the sound of their march!”\r\n\r\nMargrave, more than ever intent on the caldron, in which, from time to\r\ntime, he kept dropping powders or essences drawn forth from his coffer,\r\nlooked up, defyingly, fiercely.\r\n\r\n“Ye come,” he said, in a low mutter, his once mighty voice sounding\r\nhollow and labouring, but fearless and firm,--“ye come,--not to conquer,\r\nvain rebels!--ye whose dark chief I struck down at my feet in the tomb\r\nwhere my spell had raised up the ghost of your first human master, the\r\nChaldee! Earth and air have their armies still faithful to me, and still\r\nI remember the war-song that summons them up to confront you! Ayesha!\r\nAyesha! recall the wild troth that we pledged amongst roses; recall the\r\ndread bond by which we united our sway over hosts that yet own thee as\r\nqueen, though my sceptre is broken, my diadem reft from my brows!”\r\n\r\nThe Veiled Woman rose at this adjuration. Her veil now was withdrawn,\r\nand the blaze of the fire between Margrave and herself flushed, as with\r\nthe rosy bloom of youth, the grand beauty of her softened face. It was\r\nseen, detached as it were, from her dark-mantled form; seen through the\r\nmist of the vapours which rose from the caldron, framing it round like\r\nthe clouds. that are yieldingly pierced by the light of the evening\r\nstar.\r\n\r\nThrough the haze of the vapour came her voice, more musical, more\r\nplaintive than I had heard it before, but far softer, more tender; still\r\nin her foreign tongue; the words unknown to me, and yet their sense,\r\nperhaps, made intelligible by the love, which has one common language\r\nand one common look to all who have loved,--the love unmistakably heard\r\nin the loving tone, unmistakably seen in the loving face.\r\n\r\nA moment or so more, and she had come round from the opposite side of\r\nthe fire-pile, and bending over Margrave’s upturned brow, kissed it\r\nquietly, solemnly; and then her countenance grew fierce, her crest rose\r\nerect; it was the lioness protecting her young. She stretched forth her\r\narm from the black mantle, athwart the pale front that now again bent\r\nover the caldron,--stretched it towards the haunted and hollow-sounding\r\nspace beyond, in the gesture of one whose right hand has the sway of the\r\nsceptre. And then her voice stole on the air in the music of a chant,\r\nnot loud, yet far-reaching; so thrilling, so sweet, and yet so solemn,\r\nthat I could at once comprehend how legend united of old the spell of\r\nenchantment with the power of song. All that I recalled of the effects\r\nwhich, in the former time, Margrave’s strange chants had produced on the\r\near that they ravished and the thoughts they confused, was but as the\r\nwild bird’s imitative carol, compared to the depth and the art and the\r\nsoul of the singer, whose voice seemed endowed with a charm to enthrall\r\nall the tribes of creation, though the language it used for that charm\r\nmight to them, as to me, be unknown. As the song ceased, I heard, from\r\nbehind, sounds like those I had heard in the spaces before me,--the\r\ntramp of invisible feet, the whir of invisible wings, as if armies were\r\nmarching to aid against armies in march to destroy.\r\n\r\n“Look not in front nor around,” said Ayesha. “Look, like him, on the\r\ncaldron below. The circle and the lamps are yet bright; I will tell you\r\nwhen the light again fails.”\r\n\r\nI dropped my eyes on the caldron.\r\n\r\n“See,” whispered Margrave, “the sparkles at last begin to arise, and the\r\nrose-hues to deepen,--signs that we near the last process.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVII.\r\n\r\nThe fifth hour had passed away, when Ayesha said to me, “Lo! the circle\r\nis fading; the lamps grow dim. Look now without fear on the space\r\nbeyond; the eyes that appalled thee are again lost in air, as lightnings\r\nthat fleet back into cloud.”\r\n\r\nI looked up, and the spectres had vanished. The sky was tinged with\r\nsulphurous hues, the red and the black intermixed. I replenished the\r\nlamps and the ring in front, thriftily, heedfully; but when I came to\r\nthe sixth lamp, not a drop in the vessel that fed them was left. In a\r\nvague dismay, I now looked round the half of the wide circle in rear of\r\nthe two bended figures intent on the caldron. All along that disk the\r\nlight was already broken, here and there flickering up, here and there\r\ndying down; the six lamps in that half of the circle still twinkled, but\r\nfaintly, as stars shrinking fast from the dawn of day. But it was not\r\nthe fading shine in that half of the magical ring which daunted my eye\r\nand quickened with terror the pulse of my heart; the Bushland beyond\r\nwas on fire. From the background of the forest rose the flame and the\r\nsmoke,--the smoke, there, still half smothering the flame. But along the\r\nwidth of the grasses and herbage, between the verge of the forest and\r\nthe bed of the water-creek just below the raised platform from which I\r\nbeheld the dread conflagration, the fire was advancing,--wave upon wave,\r\nclear and red against the columns of rock behind,--as the rush of a\r\nflood through the mists of some Alp crowned with lightnings.\r\n\r\nRoused from my stun at the first sight of a danger not foreseen by the\r\nmind I had steeled against far rarer portents of Nature, I cared no more\r\nfor the lamps and the circle. Hurrying back to Ayesha, I exclaimed: “The\r\nphantoms have gone from the spaces in front; but what incantation or\r\nspell can arrest the red march of the foe, speeding on in the rear!\r\nWhile we gazed on the caldron of life, behind us, unheeded, behold the\r\nDestroyer!”\r\n\r\nAyesha looked, and made no reply; but, as by involuntary instinct,\r\nbowed her majestic head, then rearing it erect, placed herself yet\r\nmore immediately before the wasted form of the young magician (he still\r\nbending over the caldron, and hearing me not in the absorption and hope\r\nof his watch),--placed herself before him, as the bird whose first care\r\nis her fledgling.\r\n\r\nAs we two there stood, fronting the deluge of fire, we heard Margrave\r\nbehind us, murmuring low, “See the bubbles of light, how they sparkle\r\nand dance! I shall live, I shall live!” And his words scarcely died in\r\nour ears before, crash upon crash, came the fall of the age-long trees\r\nin the forest; and nearer, all near us, through the blazing grasses, the\r\nhiss of the serpents, the scream of the birds, and the bellow and tramp\r\nof the herds plunging wild through the billowy red of their pastures.\r\n\r\nAyesha now wound her arms around Margrave, and wrenched him, reluctant\r\nand struggling, from his watch over the seething caldron. In rebuke; of\r\nhis angry exclamations, she pointed to the march of the fire, spoke in\r\nsorrowful tones a few words in her own language, and then, appealing to\r\nme in English, said,--\r\n\r\n“I tell him that here the Spirits who oppose us have summoned a foe that\r\nis deaf to my voice, and--”\r\n\r\n“And,” exclaimed Margrave, no longer with gasp and effort, but with the\r\nswell of a voice which drowned all the discords of terror and of agony\r\nsent forth from the Phlegethon burning below,--“and this witch, whom I\r\ntrusted, is a vile slave and impostor, more desiring my death than my\r\nlife. She thinks that in life I should scorn and forsake her, that in\r\ndeath I should die in her arms! Sorceress, avaunt! Art thou useless and\r\npowerless now when I need thee most? Go! Let the world be one funeral\r\npyre! What to me is the world? My world is my life! Thou knowest that\r\nmy last hope is here,--that all the strength left me this night will die\r\ndown, like the lamps in the circle, unless the elixir restore it. Bold\r\nfriend, spurn that sorceress away. Hours yet ere those flames can assail\r\nus! A few minutes more, and life to your Lilian and me!”\r\n\r\nThus having said, Margrave turned from us, and cast into the caldron\r\nthe last essence yet left in his empty coffer. Ayesha silently drew her\r\nblack veil over her face; and turned, with the being she loved, from the\r\nterror he scorned, to share in the hope that he cherished.\r\n\r\nThus left alone, with my reason disenthralled, disenchanted, I\r\nsurveyed more calmly the extent of the actual peril with which we were\r\nthreatened, and the peril seemed less, so surveyed.\r\n\r\nIt is true all the Bush-land behind, almost up to the bed of the creek,\r\nwas on fire; but the grasses, through which the flame spread so rapidly,\r\nceased at the opposite marge of the creek. Watery pools were still, at\r\nintervals, left in the bed of the creek, shining tremulous, like waves\r\nof fire, in the glare reflected from the burning land; and even where\r\nthe water failed, the stony course of the exhausted rivulet was a\r\nbarrier against the march of the conflagration. Thus, unless the wind,\r\nnow still, should rise, and waft some sparks to the parched combustible\r\nherbage immediately around us, we were saved from the fire, and our work\r\nmight yet be achieved.\r\n\r\nI whispered to Ayesha the conclusion to which I came. “Thinkest thou,”\r\n she answered, without raising her mournful head, “that the Agencies of\r\nNature are the movements of chance? The Spirits I invoked to his aid\r\nare leagued with the hosts that assail. A mightier than I am has doomed\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\nScarcely had she uttered these words before Margrave exclaimed, “Behold\r\nhow the Rose of the alchemist’s dream enlarges its blooms from the folds\r\nof its petals! I shall live, I shall live!”\r\n\r\nI looked, and the liquid which glowed in the caldron had now taken a\r\nsplendour that mocked all comparisons borrowed from the lustre of gems.\r\nIn its prevalent colour it had, indeed, the dazzle and flash of the\r\nruby; but out from the mass of the molten red, broke coruscations of all\r\nprismal hues, shooting, shifting, in a play that made the wavelets them\r\nselves seem living things, sensible of their joy. No longer was there\r\nscum or film upon the surface; only ever and anon a light rosy vapour\r\nfloating up, and quick lost in the haggard, heavy, sulphurous air,\r\nhot with the conflagration rushing towards us from behind. And these\r\ncoruscations formed, on the surface of the molten ruby, literally the\r\nshape of a Rose, its leaves made distinct in their outlines by sparks of\r\nemerald and diamond and sapphire.\r\n\r\nEven while gazing on this animated liquid lustre, a buoyant delight\r\nseemed infused into my senses; all terrors conceived before were\r\nannulled; the phantoms, whose armies had filled the wide spaces in\r\nfront, were forgotten; the crash of the forest behind was unheard.\r\nIn the reflection of that glory, Margrave’s wan cheek seemed already\r\nrestored to the radiance it wore when I saw it first in the framework of\r\nblooms.\r\n\r\nAs I gazed, thus enchanted, a cold hand touched my own.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” whispered Ayesha, from the black veil, against which the rays of\r\nthe caldron fell blunt, and absorbed into Dark. “Behind us, the light of\r\nthe circle is extinct, but there we are guarded from all save the brutal\r\nand soulless destroyers. But before!--but before!--see, two of the\r\nlamps have died out!--see the blank of the gap in the ring Guard that\r\nbreach,--there the demons will enter.”\r\n\r\n“Not a drop is there left in his vessel by which to replenish the lamps\r\non the ring.”\r\n\r\n“Advance, then; thou hast still the light of the soul, and the demons\r\nmay recoil before a soul that is dauntless and guiltless. If not, Three\r\nare lost!--as it is, One is doomed.”\r\n\r\nThus adjured, silently, involuntarily, I passed from the Veiled Woman’s\r\nside, over the sere lines on the turf which had been traced by the\r\ntriangles of light long since extinguished, and towards the verge of\r\nthe circle. As I advanced, overhead rushed a dark cloud of wings,--birds\r\ndislodged from the forest on fire, and screaming, in dissonant terror,\r\nas they flew towards the farthermost mountains; close by my feet hissed\r\nand glided the snakes, driven forth from their blazing coverts, and\r\nglancing through the ring, unscared by its waning lamps; all undulating\r\nby me, bright-eyed and hissing, all made innocuous by fear,--even the\r\nterrible Death-adder, which I trampled on as I halted at the verge of\r\nthe circle, did not turn to bite, but crept harmless away. I halted at\r\nthe gap between the two dead lamps, and bowed my head to look again into\r\nthe crystal vessel. Were there, indeed, no lingering drops yet left,\r\nif but to recruit the lamps for some priceless minutes more? As I thus\r\nstood, right into the gap between the two dead lamps strode a gigantic\r\nFoot. All the rest of the form was unseen; only, as volume after volume\r\nof smoke poured on from the burning land behind, it seemed as if one\r\ngreat column of vapour, eddying round, settled itself aloft from the\r\ncircle, and that out from that column strode the giant Foot. And, as\r\nstrode the Foot, so with it came, like the sound of its tread, a roll of\r\nmuttered thunder.\r\n\r\nI recoiled, with a cry that rang loud through the lurid air.\r\n\r\n“Courage!” said the voice of Ayesha. “Trembling soul, yield not an inch\r\nto the demon!”\r\n\r\nAt the charm, the wonderful charm, in the tone of the Veiled Woman’s\r\nvoice, my will seemed to take a force more sublime than its own.\r\nI folded my arms on my breast, and stood as if rooted to the spot,\r\nconfronting the column of smoke and the stride of the giant Foot. And\r\nthe Foot halted, mute.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the momentary hush of that suspense, I heard a voice,--it was\r\nMargrave’s.\r\n\r\n“The last hour expires, the work is accomplished! Come! come! Aid me to\r\ntake the caldron from the fire; and quick!--or a drop may be wasted in\r\nvapour--the Elixir of Life from the caldron!”\r\n\r\nAt that cry I receded, and the Foot advanced.\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment, suddenly, unawares, from behind, I was stricken\r\ndown. Over me, as I lay, swept a whirlwind of trampling hoofs and\r\nglancing horns. The herds, in their flight from the burning pastures,\r\nhad rushed over the bed of the watercourse, scaled the slopes of the\r\nbanks. Snorting and bellowing, they plunged their blind way to the\r\nmountains. One cry alone, more wild than their own savage blare, pierced\r\nthe reek through which the Brute Hurricane swept. At that cry of wrath\r\nand despair I struggled to rise, again dashed to earth by the hoofs and\r\nthe horns. But was it the dream-like deceit of my reeling senses, or did\r\nI see that giant Foot stride past through the close-serried ranks of\r\nthe maddening herds? Did I hear, distinct through all the huge uproar of\r\nanimal terror, the roll of low thunder which followed the stride of that\r\nFoot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nWhen my sense had recovered its shock, and my eyes looked dizzily round,\r\nthe charge of the beasts had swept by; and of all the wild tribes\r\nwhich had invaded the magical circle, the only lingerer was the brown\r\nDeath-adder, coiled close by the spot where my head had rested. Beside\r\nthe extinguished lamps which the hoofs had confusedly scattered, the\r\nfire, arrested by the watercourse, had consumed the grasses that fed it,\r\nand there the plains stretched, black and desert as the Phlegroean\r\nField of the Poet’s Hell. But the fire still raged in the forest\r\nbeyond,--white flames, soaring up from the trunks of the tallest trees,\r\nand forming, through the sullen dark of the smoke-reek, innumerable\r\npillars of fire, like the halls in the City of fiends.\r\n\r\nGathering myself up, I turned my eyes from the terrible pomp of the\r\nlurid forest, and looked fearfully down on the hoof-trampled sward for\r\nmy two companions.\r\n\r\nI saw the dark image of Ayesha still seated, still bending, as I had\r\nseen it last. I saw a pale hand feebly grasping the rim of the magical\r\ncaldron, which lay, hurled down from its tripod by the rush of\r\nthe beasts, yards away from the dim fading embers of the scattered\r\nwood-pyre. I saw the faint writhings of a frail wasted frame, over which\r\nthe Veiled Woman was bending. I saw, as I moved with bruised limbs to\r\nthe place, close by the lips of the dying magician, the flash of the\r\nruby-like essence spilled on the sward, and, meteor-like, sparkling up\r\nfrom the torn tufts of herbage.\r\n\r\nI now reached Margrave’s side. Bending over him as the Veiled Woman\r\nbent, and as I sought gently to raise him, he turned his face, fiercely\r\nfaltering out, “Touch me not, rob me not! You share with me! Never!\r\nnever! These glorious drops are all mine! Die all else! I will live! I\r\nwill live!” Writhing himself from my pitying arms, he plunged his face\r\namidst the beautiful, playful flame of the essence, as if to lap the\r\nelixir with lips scorched away from its intolerable burning. Suddenly,\r\nwith a low shriek, he fell back, his face upturned to mine, and on that\r\nface unmistakably reigned Death!\r\n\r\nThen Ayesha tenderly, silently, drew the young head to her lap, and it\r\nvanished from my sight behind her black veil.\r\n\r\nI knelt beside her, murmuring some trite words of comfort; but she\r\nheeded me not, rocking herself to and fro as the mother who cradles a\r\nchild to sleep. Soon the fast-flickering sparkles of the lost elixir\r\ndied out on the grass; and with their last sportive diamond-like tremble\r\nof light, up, in all the suddenness of Australian day, rose the sun,\r\nlifting himself royally above the mountain-tops, and fronting the meaner\r\nblaze of the forest as a young king fronts his rebels. And as there,\r\nwhere the bush-fires had ravaged, all was a desert, so there, where\r\ntheir fury had not spread, all was a garden. Afar, at the foot of the\r\nmountains, the fugitive herds were grazing; the cranes, flocking back\r\nto the pools, renewed the strange grace of their gambols; and the great\r\nkingfisher, whose laugh, half in mirth, half in mockery, leads the choir\r\nthat welcome the morn,--which in Europe is night,--alighted bold on\r\nthe roof of the cavern, whose floors were still white with the bones of\r\nraces, extinct before--so helpless through instincts, so royal through\r\nSoul--rose Man!\r\n\r\nBut there, on the ground where the dazzling elixir had wasted its\r\nvirtues,--there the herbage already had a freshness of verdure which,\r\namid the duller sward round it, was like an oasis of green in a desert.\r\nAnd there wild-flowers, whose chill hues the eye would have scarcely\r\ndistinguished the day before, now glittered forth in blooms of\r\nunfamiliar beauty. Towards that spot were attracted myriads of happy\r\ninsects, whose hum of intense joy was musically loud. But the form of\r\nthe life-seeking sorcerer lay rigid and stark; blind to the bloom of the\r\nwild-flowers, deaf to the glee of the insects,--one hand still resting\r\nheavily on the rim of the emptied caldron, and the face still hid behind\r\nthe Black Veil. What! the wondrous elixir, sought with such hope and\r\nwell-nigh achieved through such dread, fleeting back to the earth from\r\nwhich its material was drawn, to give bloom, indeed,--but to herbs: joy\r\nindeed,--but to insects!\r\n\r\nAnd now, in the flash of the sun, slowly wound up the slopes that led to\r\nthe circle the same barbaric procession which had sunk into the valley\r\nunder the ray of the moon. The armed men came first, stalwart and tall,\r\ntheir vests brave with crimson and golden lace, their weapons gayly\r\ngleaming with holiday silver. After them, the Black Litter. As they came\r\nto the place, Ayesha, not raising her head, spoke to them in her own\r\nEastern tongue. A wail was her answer. The armed men bounded forward,\r\nand the bearers left the litter.\r\n\r\nAll gathered round the dead form with the face concealed under the black\r\nveil; all knelt, and all wept. Far in the distance, at the foot of the\r\nblue mountains, a crowd of the savage natives had risen up as if from\r\nthe earth; they stood motionless, leaning on their clubs and spears, and\r\nlooking towards the spot on which we were,--strangely thus brought into\r\nthe landscape, as if they too, the wild dwellers on the verge which\r\nHumanity guards from the Brute, were among the mourners for the\r\nmysterious Child of mysterious Nature! And still, in the herbage,\r\nhummed the small insects, and still, from the cavern, laughed the great\r\nkingfisher. I said to Ayesha, “Farewell! your love mourns the dead,\r\nmine calls me to the living. You are now with your own people, they may\r\nconsole you; say if I can assist.”\r\n\r\n“There is no consolation for me! What mourner can be consoled if the\r\ndead die forever? Nothing for him is left but a grave; that grave shall\r\nbe in the land where the song of Ayesha first lulled him to sleep. Thou\r\nassist Me,--thou, the wise man of Europe! From me ask assistance. What\r\nroad wilt thou take to thy home?”\r\n\r\n“There is but one road known to me through the maze of the\r\nsolitude,--that which we took to this upland.”\r\n\r\n“On that road Death lurks, and awaits thee! Blind dupe, couldst thou\r\nthink that if the grand secret of life had been won, he whose head rests\r\non my lap would have yielded thee one petty drop of the essence which\r\nhad filched from his store of life but a moment? Me, who so loved and\r\nso cherished him,--me he would have doomed to the pitiless cord of my\r\nservant, the Strangler, if my death could have lengthened a hair-breadth\r\nthe span of his being. But what matters to me his crime or his madness?\r\nI loved him! I loved him!”\r\n\r\nShe bowed her veiled head lower and lower; perhaps, under the veil, her\r\nlips kissed the lips of the dead. Then she said whisperingly,--\r\n\r\n“Juma the Strangler, whose word never failed to his master, whose prey\r\nnever slipped from his snare, waits thy step on the road to thy home!\r\nBut thy death cannot now profit the dead, the beloved. And thou hast had\r\npity for him who took but thine aid to design thy destruction. His life\r\nis lost, thine is saved.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke no more in the tongue that I could interpret. She spoke, in\r\nthe language unknown, a few murmured words to her swarthy attendants;\r\nthen the armed men, still weeping, rose, and made a dumb sign to me\r\nto go with them. I understood by the sign that Ayesha had told them to\r\nguard me on my way; but she gave no reply to my parting thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIX.\r\n\r\nI descended into the valley; the armed men followed. The path, on that\r\nside of the watercourse not reached by the flames, wound through meadows\r\nstill green, or amidst groves still unscathed. As a turning in the way\r\nbrought in front of my sight the place I had left behind, I beheld the\r\nblack litter creeping down the descent, with its curtains closed, and\r\nthe Veiled Woman walking by its side. But soon the funeral procession\r\nwas lost to my eyes, and the thoughts that it roused were erased. The\r\nwaves in man’s brain are like those of the sea, rushing on, rushing over\r\nthe wrecks of the vessels that rode on their surface, to sink, after\r\nstorm, in their deeps. One thought cast forth into the future now\r\nmastered all in the past: “Was Lilian living still?” Absorbed in the\r\ngloom of that thought, hurried on by the goad that my heart, in its\r\ntortured impatience, gave to my footstep, I outstripped the slow stride\r\nof the armed men, and, midway between the place I had left and the home\r\nwhich I sped to, came, far in advance of my guards, into the thicket in\r\nwhich the bushmen had started up in my path on the night that Lilian\r\nhad watched for my coming. The earth at my feet was rife with creeping\r\nplants and many-coloured flowers, the sky overhead was half-hid by\r\nmotionless pines. Suddenly, whether crawling out from the herbage,\r\nor dropping down from the trees, by my side stood the white-robed and\r\nskeleton form,--Ayesha’s attendant, the Strangler.\r\n\r\nI sprang from him shuddering, then halted and faced him. The hideous\r\ncreature crept towards me, cringing and fawning, making signs of\r\nhumble good-will and servile obeisance. Again I recoiled,--wrathfully,\r\nloathingly; turned my face homeward, and fled on. I thought I had\r\nbaffled his chase, when, just at the mouth of the thicket, he dropped\r\nfrom a bough in my path close behind me. Before I could turn, some\r\ndark muffling substance fell between my sight and the sun, and I felt a\r\nfierce strain at my throat. But the words of Ayesha had warned me; with\r\none rapid hand I seized the noose before it could tighten too closely,\r\nwith the other I tore the bandage away from my eyes, and, wheeling round\r\non the dastardly foe, struck him down with one spurn of my foot. His\r\nhand, as he fell, relaxed its hold on the noose; I freed my throat from\r\nthe knot, and sprang from the copse into the broad sunlit plain. I saw\r\nno more of the armed men or the Strangler. Panting and breathless, I\r\npaused at last before the fence, fragrant with blossoms, that divided my\r\nhome from the solitude.\r\n\r\nThe windows of Lilian’s room were darkened; all within the house seemed\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nDarkened and silenced Home! with the light and sounds of the jocund day\r\nall around it. Was there yet hope in the Universe for me? All to which I\r\nhad trusted Hope had broken down! The anchors I had forged for her hold\r\nin the beds of the ocean, her stay from the drifts of the storm, had\r\nsnapped like the reeds which pierce the side that leans on the barb of\r\ntheir points, and confides in the strength of their stems. No hope in\r\nthe baffled resources of recognized knowledge! No hope in the daring\r\nadventures of Mind into regions unknown; vain alike the calm lore of the\r\npractised physician, and the magical arts of the fated Enchanter! I\r\nhad fled from the commonplace teachings of Nature, to explore in her\r\nShadow-land marvels at variance with reason. Made brave by the grandeur\r\nof love, I had opposed without quailing the stride of the Demon, and by\r\nhope, when fruition seemed nearest, had been trodden into dust by the\r\nhoofs of the beast! And yet, all the while, I had scorned, as a dream\r\nmore wild than the word of a sorcerer, the hope that the old man and the\r\nchild, the wise and the ignorant, took from their souls as inborn.\r\nMan and fiend had alike failed a mind, not ignoble, not skilless, not\r\nabjectly craven; alike failed a heart not feeble and selfish, not dead\r\nto the hero’s devotion, willing to shed every drop of its blood for\r\na something more dear than an animal’s life for itself! What\r\nremained--what remained for man’s hope?--man’s mind and man’s heart thus\r\nexhausting their all with no other result but despair! What remained\r\nbut the mystery of mysteries, so clear to the sunrise of childhood, the\r\nsunset of age, only dimmed by the clouds which collect round the noon\r\nof our manhood? Where yet was Hope found? In the soul; in its every-day\r\nimpulse to supplicate comfort and light, from the Giver of soul,\r\nwherever the heart is afflicted, the mind is obscured.\r\n\r\nThen the words of Ayesha rushed over me: “What mourner can be consoled,\r\nif the Dead die forever?” Through every pulse of my frame throbbed that\r\ndread question. All Nature around seemed to murmur it. And suddenly, as\r\nby a flash from heaven, the grand truth in Faber’s grand reasoning shone\r\non me, and lighted up all, within and without. Man alone, of all earthly\r\ncreatures, asks, “Can the Dead die forever?” and the instinct that urges\r\nthe question is God’s answer to man! No instinct is given in vain.\r\n\r\nAnd born with the instinct of soul is the instinct that leads the soul\r\nfrom the seen to the unseen, from time to eternity, from the torrent\r\nthat foams towards the Ocean of Death, to the source of its stream, far\r\naloft from the Ocean.\r\n\r\n“Know thyself,” said the Pythian of old. “That precept descended from\r\nHeaven.” Know thyself! Is that maxim wise? If so, know thy soul. But\r\nnever yet did man come to the thorough conviction of soul but what\r\nhe acknowledged the sovereign necessity of prayer. In my awe, in my\r\nrapture, all my thoughts seemed enlarged and illumined and exalted. I\r\nprayed,--all my soul seemed one prayer. All my past, with its pride and\r\npresumption and folly, grew distinct as the form of a penitent, kneeling\r\nfor pardon before setting forth on the pilgrimage vowed to a shrine.\r\nAnd, sure now, in the deeps of a soul first revealed to myself, that the\r\nDead do not die forever, my human love soared beyond its brief trial of\r\nterror and sorrow. Daring not to ask from Heaven’s wisdom that Lilian,\r\nfor my sake, might not yet pass away from the earth, I prayed that my\r\nsoul might be fitted to bear with submission whatever my Maker might\r\nordain. And if surviving her--without whom no beam from yon material sun\r\ncould ever warm into joy a morrow in human life--so to guide my steps\r\nthat they might rejoin her at last, and, in rejoining, regain forever!\r\n\r\nHow trivial now became the weird riddle that, a little while before, had\r\nbeen clothed in so solemn an awe! What mattered it to the vast interests\r\ninvolved in the clear recognition of Soul and Hereafter, whether or not\r\nmy bodily sense, for a moment, obscured the face of the Nature I should\r\none day behold as a spirit? Doubtless the sights and the sounds which\r\nhad haunted the last gloomy night, the calm reason of Faber would strip\r\nof their magical seemings; the Eyes in the space and the Foot in the\r\ncircle might be those of no terrible Demons, but of the wild’s savage\r\nchildren whom I had seen, halting, curious and mute, in the light of the\r\nmorning. The tremor of the ground (if not, as heretofore, explicable by\r\nthe illusory impression of my own treacherous senses) might be but the\r\nnatural effect of elements struggling yet under a soil unmistakably\r\ncharred by volcanoes. The luminous atoms dissolved in the caldron\r\nmight as little be fraught with a vital elixir as are the splendours of\r\nnaphtha or phosphor. As it was, the weird rite had no magic result. The\r\nmagician was not rent limb from limb by the fiends. By causes as natural\r\nas ever extinguished life’s spark in the frail lamp of clay, he had died\r\nout of sight--under the black veil.\r\n\r\nWhat mattered henceforth to Faith, in its far grander questions and\r\nanswers, whether Reason, in Faber, or Fancy, in me, supplied the more\r\nprobable guess at a hieroglyph which, if construed aright, was but a\r\nword of small mark in the mystical language of Nature? If all the arts\r\nof enchantment recorded by Fable were attested by facts which Sages were\r\nforced to acknowledge, Sages would sooner or later find some cause\r\nfor such portents--not supernatural. But what Sage, without cause\r\nsupernatural, both without and within him, can guess at the wonders he\r\nviews in the growth of a blade of grass, or the tints on an insect’s\r\nwing? Whatever art Man can achieve in his progress through time, Man’s\r\nreason, in time, can suffice to explain. But the wonders of God? These\r\nbelong to the Infinite; and these, O Immortal! will but develop new\r\nwonder on wonder, though thy sight be a spirit’s, and thy leisure to\r\ntrack and to solve an eternity.\r\n\r\nAs I raised my face from my clasped hands, my eyes fell full upon a\r\nform standing in the open doorway. There, where on the night in which\r\nLilian’s long struggle for reason and life had begun, the Luminous\r\nShadow had been beheld in the doubtful light of a dying moon and a yet\r\nhazy dawn; there, on the threshold, gathering round her bright locks\r\nthe aureole of the glorious sun, stood Amy, the blessed child! And as I\r\ngazed, drawing nearer and nearer to the silenced house, and that Image\r\nof Peace on its threshold, I felt that Hope met me at the door,--Hope in\r\nthe child’s steadfast eyes, Hope in the child’s welcoming smile!\r\n\r\n“I was at watch for you,” whispered Amy. “All is well.”\r\n\r\n“She lives still--she lives! Thank God! thank God!”\r\n\r\n“She lives,--she will recover!” said another voice, as my head sunk on\r\nFaber’s shoulder. “For some hours in the night her sleep was disturbed,\r\nconvulsed. I feared, then, the worst. Suddenly, just before the dawn,\r\nshe called out aloud, still in sleep,--\r\n\r\n“‘The cold and dark shadow has passed away from me and from\r\nAllen,--passed away from us both forever!’\r\n\r\n“And from that moment the fever left her; the breathing became soft,\r\nthe pulse steady, and the colour stole gradually back to her cheek. The\r\ncrisis is past. Nature’s benign Disposer has permitted Nature to restore\r\nyour life’s gentle partner, heart to heart, mind to mind--”\r\n\r\n“And soul to soul,” I cried, in my solemn joy. “Above as below, soul to\r\nsoul!” Then, at a sign from Faber, the child took me by the hand and led\r\nme up the stairs into Lilian’s room.\r\n\r\nAgain those clear arms closed around me in wife-like and holy love, and\r\nthose true lips kissed away my tears,--even as now, at the distance of\r\nyears from that happy morn, while I write the last words of this Strange\r\nStory, the same faithful arms close around me, the same tender lips kiss\r\naway my tears.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg’s A Strange Story, Complete, by Edward\r\nBulwer-Lytton",
