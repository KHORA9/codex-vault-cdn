The story is |\r\n    | chock full, not only of excellent    |\r\n    | science, but woven through it there  |\r\n    | is also that very rare element, love |\r\n    | and romance. This element in an      |\r\n    | interplanetarian story is often apt  |\r\n    | to be foolish, but it does not seem  |\r\n    | so in this particular story._        |\r\n    |                                      |\r\n    | _We know so little about             |\r\n    | intra-atomic forces, that this       |\r\n    | story, improbable as it will appear  |\r\n    | in spots, will read commonplace      |\r\n    | years hence, when we have atomic     |\r\n    | engines, and when we have solved the |\r\n    | riddle of the atom._                 |\r\n    |                                      |\r\n    | _You will follow the hair-raising    |\r\n    | explorations and strange ventures    |\r\n    | into far-away worlds with bated      |\r\n    | breath, and you will be fascinated,  |\r\n    | as we were, with the strangeness of  |\r\n    | it all._                             |\r\n    |                                      |\r\n    +--------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe Occurrence of the Impossible\r\n\r\n\r\nPetrified with astonishment, Richard Seaton stared after the copper\r\nsteam-bath upon which he had been electrolyzing his solution of \"X,\" the\r\nunknown metal. For as soon as he had removed the beaker the heavy bath\r\nhad jumped endwise from under his hand as though it were alive. It had\r\nflown with terrific speed over the table, smashing apparatus and bottles\r\nof chemicals on its way, and was even now disappearing through the open\r\nwindow. He seized his prism binoculars and focused them upon the flying\r\nvessel, a speck in the distance. Through the glass he saw that it did\r\nnot fall to the ground, but continued on in a straight line, only its\r\nrapidly diminishing size showing the enormous velocity with which it was\r\nmoving. It grew smaller and smaller, and in a few moments disappeared\r\nutterly.\r\n\r\nThe chemist turned as though in a trance. How was this? The copper bath\r\nhe had used for months was gone--gone like a shot, with nothing to make\r\nit go. Nothing, that is, except an electric cell and a few drops of the\r\nunknown solution. He looked at the empty space where it had stood, at\r\nthe broken glass covering his laboratory table, and again stared out of\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nHe was aroused from his stunned inaction by the entrance of his colored\r\nlaboratory helper, and silently motioned him to clean up the wreckage.\r\n\r\n\"What's happened, Doctah?\" asked the dusky assistant.\r\n\r\n\"Search me, Dan. I wish I knew, myself,\" responded Seaton, absently,\r\nlost in wonder at the incredible phenomenon of which he had just been a\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nFerdinand Scott, a chemist employed in the next room, entered breezily.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Dicky, thought I heard a racket in here,\" the newcomer remarked.\r\nThen he saw the helper busily mopping up the reeking mass of chemicals.\r\n\r\n\"Great balls of fire!\" he exclaimed. \"What've you been celebrating? Had\r\nan explosion? How, what, and why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you the 'what,' and part of the 'how',\" Seaton replied\r\nthoughtfully, \"but as to the 'why,' I am completely in the dark. Here's\r\nall I know about it,\" and in a few words he related the foregoing\r\nincident. Scott's face showed in turn interest, amazement, and pitying\r\nalarm. He took Seaton by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Dick, old top, I never knew you to drink or dope, but this stuff sure\r\ncame out of either a bottle or a needle. Did you see a pink serpent\r\ncarrying it away? Take my advice, old son, if you want to stay in Uncle\r\nSam's service, and lay off the stuff, whatever it is. It's bad enough to\r\ncome down here so far gone that you wreck most of your apparatus and\r\nlose the rest of it, but to pull a yarn like that is going too far. The\r\nChief will have to ask for your resignation, sure. Why don't you take a\r\ncouple of days of your leave and straighten up?\"\r\n\r\nSeaton paid no attention to him, and Scott returned to his own\r\nlaboratory, shaking his head sadly.\r\n\r\nSeaton, with his mind in a whirl, walked slowly to his desk, picked up\r\nhis blackened and battered briar pipe, and sat down to study out what he\r\nhad done, or what could possibly have happened, to result in such an\r\nunbelievable infraction of all the laws of mechanics and gravitation. He\r\nknew that he was sober and sane, that the thing had actually happened.\r\nBut why? And how? All his scientific training told him that it was\r\nimpossible. It was unthinkable that an inert mass of metal should fly\r\noff into space without any applied force. Since it had actually\r\nhappened, there must have been applied an enormous and hitherto unknown\r\nforce. What was that force? The reason for this unbelievable\r\nmanifestation of energy was certainly somewhere in the solution, the\r\nelectrolytic cell, or the steam-bath. Concentrating all the power of his\r\nhighly-trained analytical mind upon the problem--deaf and blind to\r\neverything else, as was his wont when deeply interested--he sat\r\nmotionless, with his forgotten pipe clenched between his teeth. Hour\r\nafter hour he sat there, while most of his fellow-chemists finished the\r\nday's work and left the building and the room slowly darkened with the\r\ncoming of night.\r\n\r\nFinally he jumped up. Crashing his hand down upon the desk, he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I have liberated the intra-atomic energy of copper! Copper, 'X,' and\r\nelectric current!\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure a fool for luck!\" he continued as a new thought struck him.\r\n\"Suppose it had been liberated all at once? Probably blown the whole\r\nworld off its hinges. But it wasn't: it was given off slowly and in a\r\nstraight line. Wonder why? Talk about power! Infinite! Believe me, I'll\r\nshow this whole Bureau of Chemistry something to make their eyes stick\r\nout, tomorrow. If they won't let me go ahead and develop it, I'll\r\nresign, hunt up some more 'X', and do it myself. That bath is on its way\r\nto the moon right now, and there's no reason why I can't follow it.\r\nMartin's such a fanatic on exploration, he'll fall all over himself to\r\nbuild us any kind of a craft we'll need ... we'll explore the whole\r\nsolar system! Great Cat, what a chance! A fool for luck is right!\"\r\n\r\nHe came to himself with a start. He switched on the lights and saw that\r\nit was ten o'clock. Simultaneously he recalled that he was to have had\r\ndinner with his fiancée at her home, their first dinner since their\r\nengagement. Cursing himself for an idiot he hastily left the building,\r\nand soon his motorcycle was tearing up Connecticut Avenue toward his\r\nsweetheart's home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSteel Becomes Interested\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Marc DuQuesne was in his laboratory, engaged in a research upon\r\ncertain of the rare metals, particularly in regard to their\r\nelectrochemical properties. He was a striking figure. Well over six feet\r\ntall, unusually broad-shouldered even for his height, he was plainly a\r\nman of enormous physical strength. His thick, slightly wavy hair was\r\nblack. His eyes, only a trifle lighter in shade, were surmounted by\r\nheavy black eyebrows which grew together above his aquiline nose.\r\n\r\nScott strolled into the room, finding DuQuesne leaning over a delicate\r\nelectrical instrument, his forbidding but handsome face strangely\r\nilluminated by the ghastly glare of his mercury-vapor arcs.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Blackie,\" Scott began. \"I thought it was Seaton in here at\r\nfirst. A fellow has to see your faces to tell you two apart. Speaking of\r\nSeaton, d'you think that he's quite right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say, off-hand, that he was a little out of control last night\r\nand this morning,\" replied DuQuesne, manipulating connections with his\r\nlong, muscular fingers. \"I don't think that he's insane, and I don't\r\nbelieve that he dopes--probably overwork and nervous strain. He'll be\r\nall right in a day or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he's a plain nut, myself. That sure was a wild yarn he sprung\r\non us, wasn't it? His imagination was hitting on all twelve, that's\r\nsure. He seems to believe it himself, though, in spite of making a flat\r\nfailure of his demonstration to us this morning. He saved that waste\r\nsolution he was working on--what was left of that carboy of platinum\r\nresidues after he had recovered all the values, you know--and got them\r\nto put it up at auction this noon. He resigned from the Bureau, and he\r\nand M. Reynolds Crane, that millionaire friend of his, bid it in for ten\r\ncents.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. Reynolds Crane?\" DuQuesne concealed a start of surprise. \"Where does\r\nhe come in on this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're always together in everything. They've been thicker than\r\nDamon and Pythias for a long time. They play tennis together--they're\r\ndoubles champions of the District, you know--and all kinds of things.\r\nWherever you find one of them you'll usually find the other. Anyway,\r\nafter they got the solution Crane took Seaton in his car, and somebody\r\nsaid they went out to Crane's house. Probably trying to humor him. Well,\r\nta-ta; I've got a week's work to do yet today.\"\r\n\r\nAs Scott left DuQuesne dropped his work and went to his desk, with a new\r\nexpression, half of chagrin, half of admiration, on his face. Picking up\r\nhis telephone, he called a number.\r\n\r\n\"Brookings?\" he asked, cautiously. \"This is DuQuesne. I must see you\r\nimmediately. There's something big started that may as well belong to\r\nus.... No, can't say anything over the telephone.... Yes, I'll be right\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the laboratory and soon was in the private office of the head of\r\nthe Washington or \"diplomatic\" branch, as it was known in certain\r\ncircles, of the great World Steel Corporation. Offices and laboratories\r\nwere maintained in the city, ostensibly for research work, but in\r\nreality to be near the center of political activity.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Doctor DuQuesne?\" Brookings said as he seated his\r\nvisitor. \"You seem excited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not excited, but in a hurry,\" DuQuesne replied. \"The biggest thing in\r\nhistory has just broken, and we've got to work fast if we get in on it.\r\nHave you any doubts that I always know what I am talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the other in surprise. \"Not the slightest. You are widely\r\nknown as an able man. In fact, you have helped this company several\r\ntimes in various deal--er, in various ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say it. Brookings. 'Deals' is the right word. This one is going to be\r\nthe biggest ever. The beauty of it is that it should be easy--one simple\r\nburglary and an equally simple killing--and won't mean wholesale murder,\r\nas did that....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Doctor, not murder. Unavoidable accidents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not call things by their right names and save breath, as long as\r\nwe're alone? I'm not squeamish. But to get down to business. You know\r\nSeaton, of our division, of course. He has been recovering the various\r\nrare metals from all the residues that have accumulated in the Bureau\r\nfor years. After separating out all the known metals he had something\r\nleft, and thought it was a new element, a metal. In one of his attempts\r\nto get it into the metallic state, a little of its solution fizzed out\r\nand over a copper steam bath or tank, which instantly flew out of the\r\nwindow like a bullet. It went clear out of sight, out of range of his\r\nbinoculars, just that quick.\" He snapped his fingers under Brookings'\r\nnose. \"Now that discovery means such power as the world never dreamed\r\nof. In fact, if Seaton hadn't had all the luck in the world right with\r\nhim yesterday, he would have blown half of North America off the map.\r\nChemists have known for years that all matter contains enormous stores\r\nof intra-atomic energy, but have always considered it 'bound'--that is,\r\nincapable of liberation. Seaton has liberated it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that means?\"\r\n\r\n\"That with the process worked out, the Corporation could furnish power\r\nto the entire world, at very little expense.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA look of scornful unbelief passed over Brookings' face.\r\n\r\n\"Sneer if you like,\" DuQuesne continued evenly. \"Your ignorance doesn't\r\nchange the fact in any particular. Do you know what intra-atomic energy\r\nis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid that I don't, exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's the force that exists between the ultimate component parts\r\nof matter, if you can understand that. A child ought to. Call in your\r\nchief chemist and ask him what would happen if somebody would liberate\r\nthe intra-atomic energy of one hundred pounds of copper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Doctor. I didn't presume to doubt you. I will call him in.\"\r\n\r\nHe telephoned a request and soon a man in white appeared. In response to\r\nthe question he thought for a moment, then smiled slowly.\r\n\r\n\"If it were done instantaneously it would probably blow the entire world\r\ninto a vapor, and might force it clear out of its orbit. If it could be\r\ncontrolled it would furnish millions of horsepower for a long time. But\r\nit can't be done. The energy is bound. Its liberation is an\r\nimpossibility, in the same class with perpetual motion. Is that all, Mr.\r\nBrookings?\"\r\n\r\nAs the chemist left, Brookings turned again to his visitor, with an\r\napologetic air.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about these things myself, but Chambers, also an\r\nable man, says that it is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as he knows, he is right. I should have said the same thing this\r\nmorning. But I do know about these things--they're my business--and I\r\ntell you that Seaton has done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is getting interesting. Did you see it done?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It was rumored around the Bureau last night that Seaton was going\r\ninsane, that he had wrecked a lot of his apparatus and couldn't explain\r\nwhat had happened. This morning he called a lot of us into his\r\nlaboratory, told us what I have just told you, and poured some of his\r\nsolution on a copper wire. Nothing happened, and he acted as though he\r\ndidn't know what to make of it. The foolish way he acted and the\r\napparent impossibility of the whole thing, made everybody think him\r\ncrazy. I thought so until I learned this afternoon that Mr. Reynolds\r\nCrane is backing him. Then I knew that he had told us just enough of the\r\ntruth to let him get away clean with the solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose the man _is_ crazy?\" asked Brookings. \"He probably is a\r\nmonomaniac, really insane on that one thing, from studying it so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seaton? Yes, he's crazy--like a fox. You never heard of any insanity in\r\nCrane's family, though, did you? You know that he never invests a cent\r\nin anything more risky than Government bonds. You can bet your last\r\ndollar that Seaton showed him the real goods.\" Then, as a look of\r\nconviction appeared upon the other's face, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Don't you understand that the solution was Government property, and he\r\nhad to do something to make everybody think it worthless, so that he\r\ncould get title to it? That faked demonstration that failed was\r\ncertainly a bold stroke--so bold that it was foolhardy. But it worked.\r\nIt fooled even me, and I am not usually asleep. The only reason he got\r\naway with it, is, that he has always been such an open-faced talker,\r\nalways telling everything he knew.\r\n\r\n\"He certainly played the fox,\" he continued, with undisguised\r\nadmiration. \"Heretofore he has never kept any of his discoveries secret\r\nor tried to make any money out of them, though some of them were worth\r\nmillions. He published them as soon as he found them, and somebody else\r\ngot the money. Having that reputation, he worked it to make us think him\r\na nut. He certainly is clever. I take off my hat to him--he's a wonder!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is your idea? Where do we come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"You come in by getting that solution away from Seaton and Crane, and\r\nfurnishing the money to develop the stuff and to build, under my\r\ndirection, such a power-plant as the world never saw before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why get that particular solution? Couldn't we buy up some platinum\r\nwastes and refine them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a chance,\" replied the scientist. \"We have refined platinum\r\nresidues for years, and never found anything like that before. It is my\r\nidea that the stuff, whatever it is, was present in some particular lot\r\nof platinum in considerable quantities as an impurity. Seaton hasn't all\r\nof it there is in the world, of course, but the chance of finding any\r\nmore of it without knowing exactly what it is or how it reacts is\r\nextremely slight. Besides, we must have exclusive control. How could we\r\nmake any money out of it if Crane operates a rival company and is\r\nsatisfied with ten percent profit? No, we must get all of that solution.\r\nSeaton and Crane, or Seaton, at least, must be killed, for if he is left\r\nalive he can find more of the stuff and break our monopoly. I want to\r\nborrow your strong-arm squad tonight, to go and attend to it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments' thought, his face set and expressionless, Brookings\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"No, Doctor. I do not think that the Corporation would care to go into a\r\nmatter of this kind. It is too flagrant a violation of law, and we can\r\nafford to buy it from Seaton after he proves its worth.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" snorted DuQuesne. \"Don't try that on me, Brookings. You think you\r\ncan steal it yourself, and develop it without letting me in on it? You\r\ncan't do it. Do you think I am fool enough to tell you all about it,\r\nwith facts, figures, and names, if you could get away with it without\r\nme? Hardly! You can steal the solution, but that's all you can do. Your\r\nchemist or the expert you hire will begin experimenting without Seaton's\r\nlucky start, which I have already mentioned, but about which I haven't\r\ngone into any detail. He will have no information whatever, and the\r\nfirst attempt to do anything with the stuff will blow him and all the\r\ncountry around him for miles into an impalpable powder. You will lose\r\nyour chemist, your solution, and all hope of getting the process. There\r\nare only two men in the United States, or in the world, for that matter,\r\nwith brains enough and information enough to work it out. One is\r\nRichard B. Seaton, the other is Marc C. DuQuesne. Seaton certainly won't\r\nhandle it for you. Money can't buy him and Crane, and you know it. You\r\nmust come to me. If you don't believe that now, you will very shortly,\r\nafter you try it alone.\"\r\n\r\nBrookings, caught in his duplicity and half-convinced of the truth of\r\nDuQuesne's statements, still temporized.\r\n\r\n\"You're modest, aren't you, Doctor?\" he asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Modest? No,\" said the other calmly. \"Modesty never got anybody anything\r\nbut praise, and I prefer something more substantial. However, I never\r\nexaggerate or make over-statements, as you should know. What I have said\r\nis merely a statement of fact. Also, let me remind you that I am in a\r\nhurry. The difficulty of getting hold of that solution is growing\r\ngreater every minute, and my price is getting higher every second.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your price at the present second?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten thousand dollars per month during the experimental work; five\r\nmillion dollars in cash upon the successful operation of the first power\r\nunit, which shall be of not less than ten thousand horsepower; and ten\r\npercent of the profits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, Doctor, let's be reasonable. You can't mean any such figures\r\nas those.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never say anything I don't mean. I have done a lot of dirty work with\r\nyou people before, and never got much of anything out of it. You were\r\nalways too strong for me; that is, I couldn't force you without exposing\r\nmy own crookedness, but now I've got you right where I want you. That's\r\nmy price; take it or leave it. If you don't take it now, the first two\r\nof those figures will be doubled when you do come to me. I won't go to\r\nanybody else, though others would be glad to get it on my terms, because\r\nI have a reputation to maintain and you are the only ones who know that\r\nI am crooked. I know that my reputation is safe as long as I work with\r\nyou, because I know enough about you to send all you big fellows, clear\r\ndown to Perkins, away for life. I also know that that knowledge will not\r\nshorten my days, as I am too valuable a man for you to kill, as you\r\ndid....\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, Doctor, don't use such language....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" interrupted DuQuesne, in his cold, level voice. \"It's all\r\ntrue. What do a few lives amount to, as long as they're not yours and\r\nmine? As I said, I can trust you, more or less. You can trust me,\r\nbecause you know that I can't send you up without going with you.\r\nTherefore, I am going to let you go ahead without me as far as you\r\ncan--it won't be far. Do you want me to come in now or later?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we can't do business on any such terms as that,\" said\r\nBrookings, shaking his head. \"We can undoubtedly buy the power rights\r\nfrom Seaton for what you ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't fool me for a second, Brookings. Go ahead and steal the\r\nsolution, but take my advice and give your chemist only a little of it.\r\nA very little of that stuff will go a long way, and you will want to\r\nhave some left when you have to call me in. Make him experiment with\r\nextremely small quantities. I would suggest that he work in the woods at\r\nleast a hundred miles from his nearest neighbor, though it matters\r\nnothing to me how many people you kill. That's the only pointer I will\r\ngive you--I'm giving it merely to keep you from blowing up the whole\r\ncountry,\" he concluded with a grim smile. \"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the door closed behind the cynical scientist, Brookings took a small\r\ngold instrument, very like a watch, from his pocket. He touched a button\r\nand held the machine close to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Perkins,\" he said softly, \"M. Reynolds Crane has in his house a bottle\r\nof solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Can you describe it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly. It is greenish yellow in color, and I gather that it is in\r\na small bottle, as there isn't much of the stuff in the world. I don't\r\nknow what it smells or tastes like, and I wouldn't advise experimenting\r\nwith it, as it seems to be a violent explosive and is probably\r\npoisonous. Any bottle of solution of that color kept in a particularly\r\nsafe place would probably be the one. Let me caution you that this is\r\nthe biggest thing you have ever been in, and _it must not fail_. Any\r\neffort to purchase it would be useless, however large a figure were\r\nnamed. But if the bottle were only partly emptied and filled up with\r\nwater, I don't believe anyone would notice the difference, at least for\r\nsome time, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably not, sir. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, shortly after the office opened, Perkins, whose principal\r\ncharacteristic was that of absolute noiselessness, glided smoothly into\r\nBrookings' office. Taking a small bottle about half full of a\r\ngreenish-yellow liquid from his pocket, he furtively placed it under\r\nsome papers upon his superior's desk.\r\n\r\n\"A man found this last night, sir, and thought it might belong to you.\r\nHe said this was a little less than half of it, but that you could have\r\nthe rest of it any time you want it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Perkins, he was right. It is ours. Here's a letter which\r\njust came,\" handing him an envelope, which rustled as Perkins folded it\r\ninto a small compass and thrust it into his vest pocket. \"Good morning.\"\r\n\r\nAs Perkins slid out, Brookings spoke into his telephone, and soon\r\nChambers, his chief chemist, appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Chambers,\" Brookings began, showing him the bottle, \"I have here\r\na solution which in some way is capable of liberating the intra-atomic\r\nenergy of matter, about which I asked you yesterday. It works on copper.\r\nI would like to have you work out the process for us, if you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the man who discovered the process?\" asked Chambers, as he\r\ntouched the bottle gingerly.\r\n\r\n\"He is not available. Surely what one chemist can do, others can? You\r\nwill not have to work alone. You can hire the biggest men in the line to\r\nhelp you--expense is no object.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it wouldn't be, if such a process could be worked out. Let me see,\r\nwhom can we get? Doctor Seaton is probably the best man in the country\r\nfor such a research, but I don't think that we can get him. I tried to\r\nget him to work on the iridium-osmium problem, but he refused.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might make an offer big enough to get him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Don't mention it to him,\" with a significant look. \"He's to know\r\nnothing about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, how about DuQuesne, who was in here yesterday? He's\r\nprobably next to Seaton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I took it up with him yesterday. We can't get him, his figures are\r\nentirely out of reason. Aren't there any other men in the country who\r\nknow anything? You are a good man, why don't you tackle it yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I don't know anything about that particular line of research,\r\nand I want to keep on living awhile longer,\" the chemist replied\r\nbluntly. \"There are other good men whom I can get, however. Van\r\nSchravendyck, of our own laboratory, is nearly as good as either Seaton\r\nor DuQuesne. He has done a lot of work on radio-activity and that sort\r\nof thing, and I think he would like to work on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Please get it started without delay. Give him about a\r\nquarter of the solution and have the rest put in the vault. Be sure that\r\nhis laboratory is set up far enough away from everything else to avoid\r\ntrouble in case of an explosion, and caution him not to work on too much\r\ncopper at once. I gather that an ounce or so will be plenty.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chemist went back to his laboratory and sought his first assistant.\r\n\r\n\"Van,\" he began, \"Mr. Brookings has been listening to some lunatic who\r\nclaims to have solved the mystery of liberating intra-atomic energy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's old stuff,\" the assistant said, laughing. \"That and perpetual\r\nmotion are always with us. What did you tell him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't get a chance to tell him anything--he told me. Yesterday, you\r\nknow, he asked me what would happen if it could be liberated, and I\r\nanswered truthfully that lots of things would happen, and volunteered\r\nthe information that it was impossible. Just now he called me in, gave\r\nme this bottle of solution, saying that it contained the answer to the\r\npuzzle, and wanted me to work it out. I told him that it was out of my\r\nline and that I was afraid of it--which I would be if I thought there\r\nwas anything in it--but that it was more or less in your line, and he\r\nsaid to put you on it right away. He also said that expense was no\r\nobject; to set up an independent laboratory a hundred miles off in the\r\nwoods, to be safe in case of an explosion; and to caution you not to use\r\ntoo much copper at once--that an _ounce or so_ would be plenty!\"\r\n\r\n\"An ounce! Ten thousand tons of nitroglycerin! I'll say an ounce would\r\nbe plenty, if the stuff is any good at all, which of course it isn't.\r\nQueer, isn't it, how the old man would fall for anything like that? How\r\ndid he explain the failure of the discoverer to develop it himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said the discoverer is not available,\" answered Chambers with a\r\nlaugh. \"I'll bet he isn't available--he's back in St. Elizabeth's again\r\nby this time, where he came from. I suggested that we get either Seaton\r\nor DuQuesne of Rare Metals to help us on it, and he said that they had\r\nboth refused to touch it, or words to that effect. If those two turned\r\ndown a chance to work on a thing as big as this would be, there probably\r\nis nothing in this particular solution that is worth a rap. But what\r\nBrookings says goes, around here, so it's you for the woods. And don't\r\ntake any chances, either--it is conceivable that something might\r\nhappen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure it might, but it won't. We'll set up that lab near a good trout\r\nstream, and I'll have a large and juicy vacation. I'll work on the stuff\r\na little, too--enough to make a good report, at least. I'll analyze it,\r\nfind out what is in it, deposit it on some copper, shoot an electrolytic\r\ncurrent through it, and make a lot of wise motions generally, and have a\r\ndarn good time besides.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSeaton Solves the Problem of Power\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mart,\" said Seaton briskly, \"now that the Seaton-Crane Company,\r\nEngineers, is organized to your satisfaction, let's hop to it. I suppose\r\nI'd better beat it downtown and hunt up a place to work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not work here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your house? You don't want this kind of experimenting going on around\r\nhere, do you? Suppose a chunk of the stuff gets away from me and tears\r\nthe side out of the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"This house is the logical place to work. I already have a complete\r\nmachine shop and testing laboratory out in the hangar, and we can easily\r\nfit up a chemical laboratory for you up in the tower room. You can have\r\nopen windows on four sides there, and if you should accidentally take\r\nout the wall there will be little damage done. We will be alone here,\r\nwith the few neighbors so thoroughly accustomed to my mechanical\r\nexperiments that they are no longer curious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. There's another good thing, too. Your man Shiro. He's been with\r\nyou in so many tight pinches in all the unknown corners of the world on\r\nyour hunting trips and explorations that we can trust him, and he'll\r\nprobably come in handy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we can trust him implicitly. As you know, he is really my friend\r\ninstead of my man.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days, while workmen were installing a complete\r\nchemical laboratory in the tower room, Seaton busied himself in\r\npurchasing the equipment necessary for the peculiar problem before him.\r\nHis list was long and varied, ranging from a mighty transformer, capable\r\nof delivering thousands of kilovolts down to a potentiometer, so\r\nsensitive that it would register the difference of potential set up by\r\ntwo men in shaking hands.\r\n\r\nFrom daylight until dark Seaton worked in the laboratory, either alone\r\nor superintending and assisting the men at work there. Every night when\r\nCrane went to bed he saw Seaton in his room in a haze of smoke, poring\r\nover blueprints or, surrounded by abstruse works upon the calculus and\r\nsub-atomic phenomena, making interminable calculations.\r\n\r\nLess than two miles away lived Dorothy Vaneman, who had promised to be\r\nhis wife. He had seen her but once since \"the impossible\" had happened,\r\nsince his prosaic copper steam-bath had taken flight under his hand and\r\npointed the way to a great adventure. In a car his friend was to build,\r\nmoved by this stupendous power which he must learn to control, they\r\nwould traverse interstellar space--visit strange planets and survey\r\nstrange solar systems.\r\n\r\nWhile he did not forget his sweetheart--the thought of her was often in\r\nhis mind, and the fact that her future was so intimately connected with\r\nhis own gave to every action a new meaning--he had such a multitude of\r\nthings to do and was so eager to get them all done at once that day\r\nafter day went by and he could not find time to call upon her.\r\n\r\nCrane remonstrated in vain. His protests against Seaton's incessant work\r\nhad no effect. Seaton insisted that he _must_ fix firmly just a few more\r\npoints before they eluded him, and stuck doggedly to his task.\r\n\r\nFinally, Crane laid his work aside and went to call upon the girl. He\r\nfound her just leaving home, and fell into step beside her. For awhile\r\nshe tried to rouse herself to be entertaining, or at least friendly, but\r\nthe usual ease with which she chatted had deserted her, and her false\r\ngayety did not deceive the keen-minded Crane for an instant. Soon the\r\ntwo were silent as they walked along together. Crane's thoughts were on\r\nthe beautiful girl beside him, and on the splendid young genius under\r\nhis roof, so deeply immersed in his problem that he was insensible to\r\neverything else.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I have just left Dick,\" Crane said suddenly, and paying no attention to\r\nher startled glance. \"Did you ever in your life see anyone with his\r\nsingleness of purpose? With all his brilliance, one idea at a time is\r\nall that he seems capable of--though that is probably why he is such a\r\ngenius. He is working himself insane. Has he told you about leaving the\r\nBureau?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Has he? Has it anything to do with what happened that day at the\r\nlaboratory? I haven't seen him since the accident, or discovery,\r\nwhichever it was, happened. He came to see me at half-past ten, when he\r\nwas invited for dinner--oh, Martin, I had been _so_ angry!--and he told\r\nsuch a preposterous story, I've been wondering since if I didn't dream\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you didn't dream it, no matter how wild it sounded. He said it, and\r\nit is all true. I cannot explain it to you; Dick himself cannot explain\r\nit, even to me. But I can give you an idea of what we both think it may\r\ncome to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he has discovered something that makes copper act mighty\r\nqueer--knocks it off its feet, so to speak. That day a piece went up and\r\nnever did come down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is what is so preposterous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a moment, please,\" replied the imperturbable Crane. \"You should\r\nknow that nothing ordinary can account for Dick's behavior, and after\r\nwhat I have seen this last week I shall never again think anything\r\npreposterous. As I said, this piece of copper departed, _via_ the\r\nwindow, for scenes unknown. As far as a pair of good binoculars could\r\nfollow it, it held to a perfectly straight course toward those scenes.\r\nWe intend to follow it in some suitable vehicle.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, looking at his companion's face, but she did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"Building the conveyance is where I come in,\" he continued in his\r\nmatter-of-fact voice. \"As you know, I happen to have almost as much\r\nmoney as Dick has brains, and some day, before the summer is over, we\r\nexpect to go somewhere. We do not know where, but it will be a long way\r\nfrom this earth.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, then Dorothy said, helplessly:\r\n\r\n\"Well, go on.... I can't understand....\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither can I. All I know is that Dick wants to build a heavy steel\r\nhull, and he is going to put something inside it that will take us out\r\ninto space. Only occasionally do I see a little light as he tries to\r\nexplain the mechanism of the thing to me.\"\r\n\r\nAfter enjoining upon her the strictest secrecy he repeated the story\r\nthat Seaton had told him, and informed her as to the present condition\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\n\"It's no wonder the other chemists thought he was crazy, is it, Martin?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, especially after the failure of his demonstration the next morning.\r\nYou see, he tried to prove to the others that he was right, and nothing\r\nhappened. He has found out since that an electrical machine in another\r\nroom, which was not running that morning, played a very important part.\r\nWhen the copper refused to act as it had the night before they all took\r\nthe snap judgment that he had suffered an attack of temporary insanity,\r\nand that the solution was worthless. They called him 'Nobody Holme'.\"\r\n\r\n\"It almost fits, at that!\" exclaimed Dorothy, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"But if he thought of that,\" she added, thoughtfully, \"if he was\r\nbrilliant enough to build up such a wonderful theory ... think out such\r\na thing as actually traveling to the stars ... all on such a slight\r\nfoundation of fact ... I wonder why he couldn't have told me?\"\r\n\r\nShe hadn't meant to utter the last thought. Nobody must know how being\r\nleft out of it had hurt her, and she would have recalled the words if\r\nshe could. Crane understood, and answered loyally.\r\n\r\n\"He will tell you all about it very soon, never fear. His is the mind of\r\na great scientist, working on a subject of which but very few men have\r\neven an inkling. I am certain that the only reason he thought of me is\r\nthat he could not finance the investigation alone. Never think for an\r\ninstant that his absorption implies a lack of fondness for you. You are\r\nhis anchor, his only hold on known things. In fact, it was about this\r\nthat I came to see you. Dick is working himself at a rate that not even\r\na machine can stand. He eats hardly anything, and if he sleeps at all, I\r\nhave never caught him at it. That idea is driving him day and night, and\r\nif he goes on the way he is going, it means a breakdown. I do not know\r\nwhether you can make him listen to reason or not--certainly no one else\r\ncan. If you think you can do it, that is to be your job, and it will be\r\nthe biggest one of the three.\"\r\n\r\n\"How well you understand him,\" Dorothy said, after a pause. \"You make me\r\nfeel ashamed, Martin. I should have known without being told. Then I\r\nwouldn't have had these nasty little doubts about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should call them perfectly natural, considering the circumstances,\"\r\nhe answered. \"Men with minds like Dick's are rare. They work on only one\r\ntrack. Your part will be hard. He will come to you, bursting with news\r\nand aching to tell you all about his theories and facts and\r\ncalculations, and you must try to take his mind off the whole thing and\r\nmake him think of something else. It looks impossible to me.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe smile had come back to Dorothy's face. Her head, graced by its\r\nwealth of gleaming auburn hair, was borne proudly, and glancing mischief\r\nlit her violet eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you just tell me nothing is impossible? You know, Martin, that I\r\ncan make Dicky forget everything, even interstellar--did I get that word\r\nright?--space itself, with my violin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trying to beguile a scientist from his hobby is comparable only to\r\nluring a drug addict away from his vice ... but I would not be surprised\r\nif you could do it,\" he slowly replied.\r\n\r\nFor he had heard her play. She and Seaton had been caught near his home\r\nby a sudden shower while on horseback, and had dashed in for shelter.\r\nWhile the rain beat outside and while Shiro was preparing one of his\r\nfamous suppers, Crane had suggested that she pass the time by playing\r\nhis \"fiddle.\" Dorothy realized, with the first sweep of the bow, that\r\nshe was playing a Stradivarius, the like of which she had played before\r\nonly in her dreams. She forgot her listeners, forgot the time and the\r\nplace, and poured out in her music all the beauty and tenderness of her\r\nnature. Soft and full the tones filled the room, and in Crane's vision\r\nthere rose a home filled with happy work, with laughter and\r\ncompanionship, with playing children who turned their faces to their\r\nmother as do flowers to the light. Sensing the girl's dreams as the\r\nmusic filled his ears, he realized as never before in his busy,\r\npurposeful life how beautiful a home with the right woman could be. No\r\nthought of love for Dorothy entered his mind, for he knew that the love\r\nexisting between her and his friend was of the kind that nothing could\r\nalter, but he felt that she had unwittingly given him a great gift.\r\nOften thereafter in his lonely hours he had imagined that dream-home,\r\nand nothing less than its perfection would ever satisfy him.\r\n\r\nFor a time they walked on in silence. On Dorothy's face was a tender\r\nlook, the reflection of her happy thoughts, and in Crane's mind floated\r\nagain the vision of his ideal home, the home whose central figure he was\r\nunable to visualize. At last she turned and placed her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"You have done a great deal for me--for us,\" she said simply. \"I wish\r\nthere were something I could do for you in return.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have already done much more than that for me, Dorothy,\" he\r\nanswered, more slowly even than usual. \"It is hard for me to express\r\njust what it is, but I want you to know that you and Dick mean much to\r\nme.... You are the first real woman I have ever known, and some day, if\r\nlife is good to me, I hope to have some girl as lovely care for me.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy's sensitive face flushed warmly. So unexpected and sincere was\r\nhis praise that it made her feel both proud and humble. She had never\r\nrealized that this quiet, apparently unimaginative man had seen all the\r\nideals she expressed in her music. A woman expects to appear lovely to\r\nher lover, and to the men who would be her lovers if they could, but\r\nhere was a man who neither sought nor expected any favors, saying that\r\nhe wanted some girl as lovely for his own. Truly it was a compliment to\r\nbe cherished.\r\n\r\nAfter they had returned to the house and Crane had taken his departure,\r\nDorothy heard the purr of a rapidly approaching motorcycle, and her\r\nheart leaped as she went to the door to welcome her lover.\r\n\r\n\"It seems like a month since I saw you last, sweetheart!\" he exclaimed,\r\nas he lifted her clear from the floor in a passionate embrace and kissed\r\nin turn her lips, her eyes, the tip of her nose, the elusive dimple in\r\nher cheek, and the adorable curve of her neck.\r\n\r\n\"It seems longer than that to me, Dicky. I was perfectly miserable until\r\nMartin called this afternoon and explained what you have been doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I met him on the way over. But honestly, Dottie, I simply couldn't\r\nget away. I wanted to, the worst way, but everything went so slow....\"\r\n\r\n\"Slow? When you have a whole laboratory installed in a week? What would\r\nyou call speed?\"\r\n\r\n\"About two days. And then, there were a lot of little ideas that had to\r\nbe nailed down before they got away from me. This is a horribly big job,\r\nDottie, and when a fellow gets into it he can't quit. But you know that\r\nI love you just the same, even though I do appear to neglect you,\" he\r\ncontinued with fierce intensity. I love you with everything there is in\r\nme. \"I love you, mind, body and spirit; love you as a man should love\r\nthe one and only woman. For you are the only woman, there never was and\r\nnever will be another. I love you morally, physically, intellectually,\r\nand every other way there is, for the perfect little darling that you\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\nShe moved in his embrace and her arms tightened about his neck.\r\n\r\n\"You are the nearest thing to absolute perfection that ever came into\r\nthis imperfect world,\" he continued. \"Just to think of a girl of your\r\nsheer beauty, your ability, your charm, your all-round perfection, being\r\nengaged to a thing like me, makes me dizzy--but I sure do love you,\r\nlittle girl of mine. I will love you as long as we live, and afterward,\r\nmy soul will love your soul throughout eternity. You know that,\r\nsweetheart girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dick!\" she whispered, her soul shaken with response to his love. \"I\r\nnever dreamed it possible for a woman to love as I love you. 'Whither\r\nthou goest....'\"\r\n\r\nHer voice failed in the tempest of her emotion, and they clung together\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\nThey were finally interrupted by Dorothy's stately and gracious mother,\r\nwho came in to greet Seaton and invite him to have dinner with them.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that Dot would forget such an unimportant matter,\" she said,\r\nwith a glint of Dorothy's own mischief in her eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs they went into the dining-room Dorothy was amazed to see the changes\r\nthat six days had wrought in Seaton. His face looked thin, almost\r\nhaggard. Fine lines had made their appearance at the corners of his eyes\r\nand around his mouth, and faint but unmistakable blue rings encircled\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You have been working too hard, boy,\" she reproved him gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" he rejoined lightly. \"I'm all right, I never felt better. Why,\r\nI could whip a rattlesnake right now, and give him the first bite!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed at his reply, but the look of concern did not leave her\r\nface. As soon as they were seated at the table she turned to her father,\r\na clean-cut, gray-haired man of fifty, known as one of the shrewdest\r\nattorneys in the city.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy,\" she demanded, \"what do you mean by being elected director in\r\nthe Seaton-Crane Company and not telling me anything about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Daughter,\" he replied in the same tone, \"what do you mean by asking\r\nsuch a question as that? Don't you know that it is a lawyer's business\r\nto get information, and to give it out only to paying clients? However,\r\nI can tell you all I know about the Seaton-Crane Company without adding\r\nto your store of knowledge at all. I was present at one meeting, gravely\r\nvoted 'aye' once, and that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you draw up the articles of incorporation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am doing it, yes; but they don't mean anything. They merely empower\r\nthe Company to do anything it wants to, the same as other large\r\ncompanies do.\" Then, after a quick but searching glance at Seaton's worn\r\nface and a warning glance at his daughter, he remarked:\r\n\r\n\"I read in the _Star_ this evening that Enright and Stanwix will\r\nprobably make the Australian Davis Cup team, and that the Hawaiian with\r\nthe unpronounceable name has broken three or four more world's records.\r\nWhat do you think of our tennis chances this year, Dick?\"\r\n\r\nDorothy flushed, and the conversation, steered by the lawyer into the\r\nsafer channels, turned to tennis, swimming, and other sports. Seaton,\r\nwhose plate was unobtrusively kept full by Mr. Vaneman, ate such a\r\ndinner as he had not eaten in weeks. After the meal was over they all\r\nwent into the spacious living-room, where the men ensconced themselves\r\nin comfortable Morris chairs with long, black cigars between their\r\nteeth, and all four engaged in a spirited discussion of various topics\r\nof the day. After a time, the older couple left the room, the lawyer\r\ngoing into his study to work, as he always did in the evening.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Dicky, how's everything?\" Dorothy asked, unthinkingly.\r\n\r\nThe result of this innocent question was astonishing. Seaton leaped to\r\nhis feet. The problem, dormant for two hours, was again in complete\r\npossession of his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Rotten!\" he snapped, striding back and forth and brandishing his\r\nhalf-smoked cigar. \"My head is so thick that it takes a thousand years\r\nfor an idea to filter into it. I should have the whole thing clear by\r\nthis time, but I haven't. There's something, some little factor, that I\r\ncan't get. I've almost had it a dozen times, but it always gets away\r\nfrom me. I know that the force is there and I can liberate it, but I\r\ncan't work out a system of control until I can understand exactly why it\r\nacts the way it does.\" Then, more slowly, thinking aloud rather than\r\naddressing the girl:\r\n\r\n\"The force is attraction toward all matter, generated by the vibrations\r\nof all the constituent electrons in parallel planes. It is directed\r\nalong a line perpendicular to the plane of vibration at its center, and\r\napproaches infinity as the angle theta approaches the limit of Pi\r\ndivided by two. Therefore, by shifting the axis of rotation or the plane\r\nof vibration thus making theta vary between the limits of zero and Pi\r\ndivided by two....\"\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by Dorothy, who, mortified by her thoughtlessness in\r\ngetting him started, had sprung up and seized him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Dicky!\" she implored. \"Sit down, you're rocking the boat!\r\nSave your mathematics for Martin. Don't you know that I could never find\r\nout why 'x' was equal to 'y' or to anything else in algebra?\"\r\n\r\nShe led him back to his chair, where he drew her down to a seat on the\r\narm beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you love?\" she whispered gayly in his ear.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she freed herself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I haven't practised today. Don't you want me to play for you a little?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine business, Dottie. When you play a violin, it talks.\"\r\n\r\nShe took down her violin and played; first his favorites, crashing\r\nselections from operas and solos by the great masters, abounding in\r\nharmonies on two strings. Then she changed to reveries and soft,\r\nplaintive melodies. Seaton listened with profound enjoyment. Under the\r\nspell of the music he relaxed, pushed out the footrest of the chair, and\r\nlay back at ease, smoking dreamily. The cigar finished and his hands at\r\nrest, his eyes closed of themselves. The music, now a crooning lullaby,\r\ngrew softer and slower, until his deep and regular breathing showed that\r\nhe was sound asleep. She stopped playing and sat watching him intently,\r\nher violin in readiness to play again, if he should show the least sign\r\nof waking, but there was no such sign. Freed from the tyranny of the\r\nmighty brain which had been driving it so unmercifully, his body was\r\nmaking up for many hours of lost sleep.\r\n\r\nAssured that he was really asleep, Dorothy tip-toed to her father's\r\nstudy and quietly went in.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy, Dick is asleep out there in the chair. What shall we do with\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good work, Dottie Dimple. I heard you playing him to sleep--you almost\r\nput me to sleep as well. I'll get a blanket and we'll put him to bed\r\nright where he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear old Dad,\" she said softly, sitting on the arm of his chair and\r\nrubbing her cheek against his. \"You always did understand, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I try to, Kitten,\" he answered, pulling her ear. \"Seaton is too good a\r\nman to see go to pieces when it can be prevented. That is why I\r\nsignalled you to keep the talk off the company and his work. One of the\r\nbest lawyers I ever knew, a real genius, went to pieces that same way.\r\nHe was on a big, almost an impossible, case. He couldn't think of\r\nanything else, didn't eat or sleep much for months. He won the case, but\r\nit broke him. But he wasn't in love with a big, red-headed beauty of a\r\ngirl, and so didn't have her to fiddle him to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll go get the blanket,\" he concluded, with a sudden change in\r\nhis tone.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments he returned and they went into the living-room\r\ntogether. Seaton lay in exactly the same position, only the regular\r\nlifting of his powerful chest showing that he was alive.\r\n\r\n\"I think we had better....\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh ... sh,\" interrupted the girl in an intense whisper. \"You'll wake\r\nhim up, Daddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bosh! You couldn't wake him up with a club. His own name might rouse\r\nhim, particularly if you said it; no other ordinary sound would. I\r\nstarted to say that I think we had better put him to bed on the\r\ndavenport. He would be more comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that would surely wake him. And he's so big....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, it wouldn't, unless I drop him on the floor. And he doesn't\r\nweigh much over two hundred, does he?\"\r\n\r\n\"About ten or eleven pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even though I am a lawyer, and old and decrepit, I can still handle\r\nthat much.\"\r\n\r\nWith Dorothy anxiously watching the proceeding and trying to help,\r\nVaneman picked Seaton up out of the chair, with some effort, and carried\r\nhim across the room. The sleeping man muttered as if in protest at being\r\ndisturbed, but made no other sign of consciousness. The lawyer then\r\ncalmly removed Seaton's shoes and collar, while the girl arranged\r\npillows under his head and tucked the blanket around him. Vaneman bent a\r\nquizzical glance upon his daughter, under which a flaming blush spread\r\nfrom her throat to her hair.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she said, defiantly, \"I'm going to, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, of course you are. If you didn't, I would disown you.\"\r\n\r\nAs her father turned away, Dorothy knelt beside her lover and pressed\r\nher lips tightly to his.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, sweetheart,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"'Night,\" he muttered in his sleep, as his lips responded faintly to her\r\ncaress.\r\n\r\nVaneman waited for his daughter, and when she appeared, the blush again\r\nsuffusing her face, he put his arm around her.\r\n\r\n\"Dorothy,\" he said at the door of her room, using her full name, a very\r\nunusual thing for him, \"the father of such a girl as you are hates to\r\nlose her, but I advise you to stick to that boy. Believe in him and\r\ntrust him, no matter what happens. He is a real man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, Dad ... thank you. I had a touch of the blues today, but I\r\nnever will again. I think more of his little finger than I do of all the\r\nother men I ever knew, put together. But how do you know him so well? I\r\nknow him, of course, but that's different.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have various ways of getting information. I know Dick Seaton better\r\nthan you do--better than he knows himself. I have known all about every\r\nman who ever looked at you twice. I have been afraid once or twice that\r\nI would have to take a hand, but you saw them right, just as you see\r\nSeaton right. For some time I have been afraid of the thought of your\r\nmarrying, the young men in your social set are such a hopeless lot, but\r\nI am not any more. When I hand my little girl over to her husband next\r\nOctober I can be really happy with you, instead of anxious for you.\r\nThat's how well I know Richard Seaton.... Well, good night, daughter\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Daddy dear,\" she replied, throwing her arms around his\r\nneck. \"I have the finest Dad a girl ever had, and the finest ... boy.\r\nGood night.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was three o'clock the following afternoon when Seaton appeared in the\r\nlaboratory. His long rest had removed all the signs of overwork and he\r\nwas his alert, vigorous self, but when Crane saw him and called out a\r\ncheery greeting he returned it with a sheepish smile.\r\n\r\n\"Don't say anything, Martin--I'm thinking it all, and then some. I made\r\na regular fool of myself last night. Went to sleep in a chair and slept\r\nseventeen hours without a break. I never felt so cheap in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were worn out, Dick, and you know it. That sleep put you on your\r\nfeet again, and I hope you will have sense enough to take care of\r\nyourself after this. I warn you now, Dick, that if you start any more of\r\nthat midnight work I will simply call Dorothy over here and have her\r\ntake charge of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, Mart, rub it in. Don't you see that I am flat on my back,\r\nwith all four paws in the air? But I'm going to sleep every night. I\r\npromised Dottie to go to bed not later than twelve, if I have to quit\r\nright in the middle of an idea, and I told her that I was coming out to\r\nsee her every other evening and every Sunday. But here's the dope. I've\r\ngot that missing factor in my theory--got it while I was eating\r\nbreakfast this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had eaten and slept regularly here and kept yourself fit you\r\nwould have seen it before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess that's right, too. If I miss a meal or a sleep from now on\r\nI want you to sand-bag me. But never mind that. Here's the explanation.\r\nWe doped out before, you know, that the force is something like\r\nmagnetism, and is generated when the coil causes the electrons of this\r\nspecially-treated copper to vibrate in parallel planes. The knotty point\r\nwas what could be the effect of a weak electric current in liberating\r\nthe power. I've got it! It shifts the plane of vibration of the\r\nelectrons!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to shift that plane, Dick. It is fixed by physical\r\nstate, just as speed is fixed by temperature.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't. That is, it usually is, but in this case it may be\r\nshifted. Here's the mathematical proof.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Seaton went over to the drafting table, tacked down a huge\r\nsheet of paper, and sketched rapidly, explaining as he drew. Soon the\r\ntwo men were engaged in a profound mathematical argument. Sheet after\r\nsheet of paper was filled with equations and calculations, and the table\r\nwas covered with reference books. After two hours of intense study and\r\nhot discussion Crane's face took on a look of dawning comprehension,\r\nwhich changed to amazement and then to joy. For the first time in\r\nSeaton's long acquaintance with him, his habitual calm was broken.\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" he cried, shaking Seaton's hand in both of his. \"I think\r\nyou have it! But how under the sun did you get the idea? That calculus\r\nisn't in any of the books. Where did you get it? Dick, you're a wonder!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how I got the idea, it merely came to me. But that Math is\r\nright--it's _got_ to be right, no other conclusion is possible. Now, if\r\nthat calc. is right, and I know it is, do you see how narrow the\r\npermissible limits of shifting are? Look at equation 236. Believe me, I\r\nsure was lucky, that day in the Bureau. It's a wonder I didn't blow up\r\nthe whole works. Suppose I hadn't been working with a storage cell that\r\ngave only four amperes at two volts? That's unusually low, you know, for\r\nthat kind of work.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCrane carefully studied the equation referred to and figured for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\"In that case the limit would be exactly eight watts. Anything above\r\nthat means instant decomposition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nCrane whistled, a long, low whistle.\r\n\r\n\"And that bath weighed forty pounds--enough to vaporize the whole\r\nplanet. Dick, it cannot be possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't seem that way, but it is. It certainly makes me turn cold\r\nall over, though, to think of what might have happened. You know now why\r\nI wouldn't touch the solution again until I had this stuff worked out?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do. You should be even more afraid of it now. I don't mind\r\nnitroglycerin or T.N.T., but anything like that is merely a child's\r\nplaything compared to this. Perhaps we had better drop it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in seven thousand years. The mere fact that I was so lucky at first\r\nproves that Fate intended this thing to be my oyster. However, I'll not\r\ntempt the old lady any farther. I'm going to start with one millionth of\r\na volt, and will use a piece of copper visible only under a microscope.\r\nBut there's absolutely no danger, now that we know what it is. I can\r\nmake it eat out of my hand. Look at this equation here, though. That\r\nbeing true, it looks as though you could get the same explosive effect\r\nby taking a piece of copper which had once been partially decomposed and\r\nsubjecting it to some force, say an extremely heavy current. Again under\r\nthe influence of the coil, a small current would explode it, wouldn't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks that way, from those figures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, wouldn't that make some bullet? Unstabilize a piece of copper in\r\nthat way and put it inside a rifle bullet, arranged to make a short\r\ncircuit on impact. By making the piece of copper barely visible you\r\ncould have the explosive effect of only a few sticks of dynamite--a\r\npiece the size of a pea would obliterate New York City. But that's a\r\nlong way from our flying-machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not so far as you think. When we explore new worlds it might be\r\na good idea to have a liberal supply of such ammunition, of various\r\nweights, for emergencies.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might, at that. Here's another point in equation 249. Suppose the\r\nunstabilized copper were treated with a very weak current, not strong\r\nenough to explode it? A sort of borderline condition? The energy would\r\nbe liberated, apparently, but in an entirely new way. Wonder what would\r\nhappen? I can't see from the theory--have to work it out. And here's\r\nanother somewhat similar condition, right here, that will need\r\ninvestigating. I've sure got a lot of experimental work ahead of me\r\nbefore I'll know anything. How're things going with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the drawings and blue-prints of the ship itself done, and\r\nworking sketches of the commercial power-plant. I am working now on the\r\ndetails, such as navigating instruments, food, water, and air supplies,\r\nspecial motors, and all of the hundred and one little things that must\r\nbe taken into consideration. Then, as soon as you get the power under\r\ncontrol, we will have only to sketch in the details of the power-plant\r\nand its supports before we can begin construction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine, Mart, that's great. Well, let's get busy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSteel Liberates Energy--Unexpectedly\r\n\r\n\r\nDuQuesne was in his laboratory, poring over an abstruse article in a\r\nforeign journal of science, when Scott came breezily in with a newspaper\r\nin his hand, across the front page of which stretched great headlines.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Blackie!\" he called. \"Come down to earth and listen to this tale\r\nof mystery from that world-renowned fount of exactitude and authority,\r\nthe _Washington Clarion_. Some miscreant has piled up and touched off a\r\nfew thousand tons of T.N.T. and picric acid up in the hills. Read about\r\nit, it's good.\"\r\n\r\nDuQuesne read:\r\n\r\n\r\n     MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSION!\r\n\r\n     MOUNTAIN VILLAGE WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE!\r\n     TWO HUNDRED DEAD, NONE INJURED!\r\n\r\n     FORCE FELT ALL OVER WORLD. CAUSE UNKNOWN.\r\n     SCIENTISTS BAFFLED.\r\n\r\n     HARPER'S FERRY. March 26.--At 10: 23 A.M. today, the village of\r\n     Bankerville, about thirty miles north of this place, was totally\r\n     destroyed by an explosion of such terrific violence that\r\n     seismographs all over the world recorded the shock, and that\r\n     windows were shattered even in this city. A thick pall of dust and\r\n     smoke was observed in the sky and parties set out immediately. They\r\n     found, instead of the little mountain village, nothing except an\r\n     immense, crater-like hole in the ground, some two miles in diameter\r\n     and variously estimated at from two to three thousand feet deep. No\r\n     survivors have been found, no bodies have been recovered. The\r\n     entire village, with its two hundred inhabitants, has been wiped\r\n     out of existence. Not so much as a splinter of wood or a fragment\r\n     of brick from any of the houses can be found. Scientists are unable\r\n     to account for the terrific force of the explosion, which far\r\n     exceeded that of the most violent explosive known.\r\n\r\n\"Hm ... m. That sounds reasonable, doesn't it?\" asked DuQuesne,\r\nsarcastically, as he finished reading.\r\n\r\n\"It sure does,\" replied Scott, grinning. \"What'd'you suppose it was?\r\nThink the reporter heard a tire blow out on Pennsylvania Avenue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps. Nothing to it, anyway,\" as he turned back to his work.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the visitor had gone a sneering smile spread over DuQuesne's\r\nface and he picked up his telephone.\r\n\r\n\"The fool did it. That will cure him of sucking eggs!\" he muttered.\r\n\"Operator? DuQuesne speaking. I am expecting a call this afternoon.\r\nPlease ask him to call me at my house.... Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fred,\" he called to his helper, \"if anyone wants me, tell them that I\r\nhave gone home.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the building and stepped into his car. In less than half an hour\r\nhe arrived at his house on Park Road, overlooking beautiful Rock Creek\r\nPark. Here he lived alone save for an old colored couple who were his\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nIn the busiest part of the afternoon Chambers rushed unannounced into\r\nBrookings' private office. His face was white as chalk.\r\n\r\n\"Read that, Mr. Brookings!\" he gasped, thrusting the _Clarion_ extra\r\ninto his hand.\r\n\r\nBrookings read the news of the explosion, then looked at his chief\r\nchemist, his face turning gray.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, that was our laboratory,\" said Chambers, dully.\r\n\r\n\"The fool! Didn't you tell him to work with small quantities?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did. He said not to worry, that he was taking no chances, that he\r\nwould never have more than a gram of copper on hand at once in the whole\r\nlaboratory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well ... I'll ... be ... damned!\" Slowly turning to the telephone,\r\nBrookings called a number and asked for Doctor DuQuesne, then called\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"Brookings speaking. I would like to see you this afternoon. Will you be\r\nat home?... I'll be there in about an hour. Good bye.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Brookings arrived he was shown into DuQuesne's study. The two men\r\nshook hands perfunctorily and sat down, the scientist waiting for the\r\nother to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Well, DuQuesne, you were right. Our man couldn't handle it. But of\r\ncourse you didn't mean the terms you mentioned before?\"\r\n\r\nDuQuesne's lips smiled; a hard, cold smile.\r\n\r\n\"You know what I said, Brookings. Those terms are now doubled, twenty\r\nthousand and ten million. Nothing else goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expected it, since you never back down. The Corporation expects to\r\npay for its mistakes. We accept your terms and I have contracts here for\r\nyour services as research director, at a salary of two hundred and forty\r\nthousand dollars per annum, with the bonus and royalties you demand.\"\r\n\r\nDuQuesne glanced over the documents and thrust them into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go over these with my attorney to-night, and mail one back to you\r\nif he approves the contract. In the meantime, we may as well get down to\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you suggest?\" asked Brookings.\r\n\r\n\"You people stole the solution, I see....\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't use such harsh language, Doctor, it's....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I'm for direct action, first, last and all the time. This\r\nthing is too important to permit of mincing words or actions, it's a\r\nwaste of time. Have you the solution here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here it is,\" drawing the bottle from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the rest of it?\" asked DuQuesne as he noted the size of the\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n\"All that we found is here, except about a teaspoonful which the expert\r\nhad to work on,\" replied Brookings. \"We didn't get it all, only half of\r\nit. The rest of it was diluted with water, so that it wouldn't be\r\nmissed. After we get started, if you find it works out satisfactorily,\r\nwe can procure the rest of it. That will certainly cause a disturbance,\r\nbut it may be necessary....\"\r\n\r\n\"Half of it!\" interrupted DuQuesne. \"You haven't one-twentieth of it\r\nhere. When I saw it in the Bureau, Seaton had about five hundred\r\nmilliliters--over a pint--of it. I wonder if you're double-crossing me\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you're not,\" he continued, paying no attention to the other's\r\nprotestations of innocence. \"You're paying me too much to want to block\r\nme now. The crook you sent out to get the stuff turned in only this\r\nmuch. Do you suppose he is holding out on us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. You know Perkins and his methods.\"\r\n\r\n\"He missed the main bottle, then. That's where your methods make me\r\ntired. When I want anything done, I believe in doing it myself, then I\r\nknow it's done right. As to what I suggest, that's easy. I will take\r\nthree or four of Perkins' gunmen tonight. We'll go out there and raid\r\nthe place. We'll shoot Seaton and anybody else who gets in the way.\r\nWe'll dynamite the safe and take their solution, plans, notes, money,\r\nand anything else we want.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Doctor, that's too crude altogether. If we have to do that, let\r\nit be only as a last resort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say do it first, then we know we will get results. I tell you I'm\r\nafraid of pussyfooting and gumshoeing around Seaton and Crane. I used to\r\nthink that Seaton was easy, but he seems to have developed greatly in\r\nthe last few weeks, and Crane never was anybody's fool. Together they\r\nmake a combination hard to beat. Brute force, applied without warning,\r\nis our best bet, and there's no danger, you know that. We've got away\r\nclean with lots worse stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's always dangerous, and we could wink at such tactics only after\r\neverything else has failed. Why not work it out from this solution we\r\nhave, and then quietly get the rest of it? After we have it worked out,\r\nSeaton might get into an accident on his motorcycle, and we could prove\r\nby the state of development of our plans that we discovered it long\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because developing the stuff is highly dangerous, as you have found\r\nout. Even Seaton wouldn't have been alive now if he hadn't had a lot of\r\nluck at the start. Then, too, it would take too much time. Seaton has\r\nalready developed it--you see, I haven't been asleep and I know what he\r\nhas done, just as well as you do--and why should we go through all that\r\nslow and dangerous experimental work when we can get their notes and\r\nplans as well as not? There is bound to be trouble anyway when we steal\r\nall their solution, even though they haven't missed this little bit of\r\nit yet, and it might as well come now as any other time. The Corporation\r\nis amply protected, and I am still a Government chemist. Nobody even\r\nsuspects that I am in on this deal. I will never see you except after\r\nhours and in private, and will never come near your offices. We will be\r\nso cautious that, even if anyone should get suspicious, they can't\r\npossibly link us together, and until they do link us together, we are\r\nall safe. No, Brookings, a raid in force is the only sure and safe way.\r\nWhat is more natural than a burglary of a rich man's house? It will be a\r\nsimple affair. The police will stir around for a few days, then it will\r\nall be forgotten and we can go ahead. Nobody will suspect anything\r\nexcept Crane, if he is alive, and he won't be able to do anything.\"\r\n\r\nSo the argument raged. Brookings was convinced that DuQuesne was right\r\nin wanting to get possession of all the solution, and also of the\r\nworking notes and plans, but would not agree to the means suggested,\r\nholding out for quieter and more devious, but less actionable methods.\r\nFinally he ended the argument with a flat refusal to countenance the\r\nraid, and the scientist was forced to yield, although he declared that\r\nthey would have to use his methods in the end, and that it would save\r\ntime, money, and perhaps lives, if they were used first. Brookings then\r\ntook from his pocket his wireless and called Perkins. He told him of the\r\nlarger bottle of solution, instructing him to secure it and to bring\r\nback all plans, notes, and other material he could find which in any way\r\npertained to the matter in hand. Then, after promising DuQuesne to keep\r\nhim informed of developments, and giving him an instrument similar to\r\nthe one he himself carried, Brookings took his leave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeaton had worked from early morning until late at night, but had\r\nrigorously kept his promise to Dorothy. He had slept seven or eight\r\nhours every night and had called upon her regularly, returning from the\r\nvisits with ever-keener zest for his work.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon, upon the day of the explosion, Seaton stepped\r\ninto Crane's shop with a mass of notes in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mart, I've got it--some of it, at least. The power is just what\r\nwe figured it, so immensely large as to be beyond belief. I have found:\r\n\r\n\"First: That it is a practically irresistible _pull_ along the axis of\r\nthe treated wire or bar. It is apparently focused at infinity, as\r\nnear-by objects are not affected.\r\n\r\n\"Second: I have studied two of the border-line regions of current we\r\ndiscussed. I have found that in one the power is liberated as a similar\r\nattractive force but is focused upon the first object in line with the\r\naxis of the bar. As long as the current is applied it remains focused\r\nupon that object, no matter what comes between. In the second\r\nborder-line condition the power is liberated as a terrific repulsion.\r\n\r\n\"Third: That the copper is completely transformed into available energy,\r\nthere being no heat whatever liberated.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth: Most important of all, that the X acts only as a catalyst for\r\nthe copper and is not itself consumed, so that an infinitesimally thin\r\ncoating is all that is required.\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly have found out a great deal about it,\" replied Crane, who\r\nhad been listening with the closest attention, a look of admiration upon\r\nhis face. \"You have all the essential facts right there. Now we can go\r\nahead and put in the details which will finish up the plans completely.\r\nAlso, one of those points solves my hardest problem, that of getting\r\nback to the earth after we lose sight of it. We can make a small bar in\r\nthat border-line condition and focus it upon the earth, and we can use\r\nthat repulsive property to ward off any meteorites which may come too\r\nclose to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. I never thought of using those points for anything. I\r\nfound them out incidentally, and merely mentioned them as interesting\r\nfacts. I have a model of the main bar built, though, that will lift me\r\ninto the air and pull me all around. Want to see it work?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do.\"\r\n\r\nAs they were going out to the landing field Shiro called to them and\r\nthey turned back to the house, learning that Dorothy and her father had\r\njust arrived.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, boys!\" Dorothy said, bestowing her radiant smile upon them both\r\nas Seaton seized her hand. \"Dad and I came out to see that you were\r\ntaking care of yourselves, and to see what you are doing. Are visitors\r\nallowed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Seaton promptly. \"All visitors are barred. Members of the\r\nfirm and members of the family, however, are not classed as visitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"You came at the right time,\" said Crane, smiling. \"Dick has just\r\nfinished a model, and was about to demonstrate it to me when you\r\narrived. Come with us and watch the....\"\r\n\r\n\"I object,\" interrupted Seaton. \"It is a highly undignified performance\r\nas yet, and....\"\r\n\r\n\"Objection overruled,\" interposed the lawyer, decisively. \"You are too\r\nyoung and impetuous to have any dignity; therefore, any performance not\r\nundignified would be impossible, _a priori_. The demonstration will\r\nproceed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLaughing merrily, the four made their way to the testing shed, in front\r\nof which Seaton donned a heavy leather harness, buckled about his\r\nshoulders, body and legs; to which were attached numerous handles,\r\nswitches, boxes and other pieces of apparatus. He snapped the switch\r\nwhich started the Tesla coil in the shed and pressed a button on an\r\ninstrument in his hand, attached to his harness by a small steel cable.\r\nInstantly there was a creak of straining leather and he shot vertically\r\ninto the air for perhaps a hundred feet, where he stopped and remained\r\nmotionless for a few moments. Then the watchers saw him point his arm\r\nand dart in the direction in which he pointed. By merely pointing,\r\napparently, he changed his direction at will; going up and down, forward\r\nand backward, describing circles and loops and figures of eight. After a\r\nfew minutes of this display he descended, slowing up abruptly as he\r\nneared the ground and making an easy landing.\r\n\r\n\"There, oh beauteous lady and esteemed sirs,\" he began, with a low bow\r\nand a sweeping flourish--when there was a snap, and he was jerked\r\nsidewise off his feet. In bowing, his cumbersome harness had pressed the\r\ncontrolling switch and the instrument he held in his hand, which\r\ncontained the power-plant, or bar, had torn itself loose from its\r\nbuckle. Instead of being within easy reach of his hand it was over six\r\nfeet away, and was dragging him helplessly after it, straight toward the\r\nhigh stone wall! But only momentarily was he helpless, his keen mind\r\ndiscovering a way out of the predicament even as he managed to scramble\r\nto his feet in spite of the rapid pace. Throwing his body sidewise and\r\nreaching out his long arm as far as possible toward the bar, he\r\nsucceeded in swinging it around so that he was running back toward the\r\nparty and the spacious landing field. Dorothy and her father were\r\nstanding motionless, staring at Seaton; the former with terror in her\r\neyes, the latter in blank amazement. Crane had darted to the switch\r\ncontrolling the coil, and was reaching for it when Seaton passed them.\r\n\r\n\"Don't touch that switch!\" he yelled. \"I'll catch that thing yet!\"\r\n\r\nAt this evidence that Seaton still thought himself master of the\r\nsituation, Crane began to laugh, though he still kept his hand near the\r\ncontrolling switch. Dorothy, relieved of her fear for her lover's\r\nsafety, could not help but join him, so ludicrous were Seaton's antics.\r\nThe bar was straight out in front of him, about five feet above the\r\nground, going somewhat faster than a man could run. It turned now to the\r\nright, now to the left, as his weight was thrown to one side or the\r\nother. Seaton, dragged along like a small boy trying to hold a runaway\r\ncalf by the tail, was covering the ground in prodigious leaps and\r\nbounds; at the same time pulling himself up, hand over hand, to the bar\r\nin front of him. He soon reached it, seized it in both hands, again\r\ndarted into the air, and descended lightly near the others, who were\r\nrocking with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"I said it would be undignified,\" chuckled Seaton, rather short of\r\nbreath, \"but I didn't know just how much so it was going to be.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy tucked her fingers into his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt anywhere, Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit. He led me a great chase, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was scared to death until you told Martin to let the switch alone.\r\nBut it was funny then! I hadn't noticed your resemblance to a\r\njumping-jack before. Won't you do it again sometime and let us take a\r\nmovie of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was as good as any show in town, Dick,\" said the lawyer, wiping\r\nhis eyes, \"but you must be more careful. Next time, it might not be\r\nfunny at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be no next time for this rig,\" replied Seaton. \"This is\r\nmerely to show us that our ideas are all right. The next trip will be in\r\na full-scale, completely-equipped boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was perfectly wonderful,\" declared Dorothy. \"I know this first\r\nflight of yours will be a turning-point or something in history. I don't\r\npretend to understand how you did it--the sight of you standing still up\r\nthere in the air made me wonder if I really were awake, even though I\r\nknew what to expect--but we wouldn't have missed it for worlds, would\r\nwe, Dad?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I am very glad that we saw the first demonstration. The world has\r\nnever before seen anything like it, and you two men will rank as two of\r\nthe greatest discoverers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seaton will, you mean,\" replied Crane, uncomfortably. \"You know I\r\ndidn't have anything to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nearly all yours,\" denied Seaton. \"Without your ideas I would have\r\nlost myself in space in my first attempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are both wrong,\" said Vaneman. \"You, Martin, haven't enough\r\nimagination; and you, Dick, have altogether too much, for either of you\r\nto have done this alone. The honor will be divided equally between you.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe turned to Crane as Dorothy and Seaton set out toward the house.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with it, commercially? Dick, of course, hasn't\r\nthought of anything except this space-car--equally of course, you have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Knowing the general nature of the power and confident that Dick\r\nwould control it, I have already drawn up sketches for a power-plant\r\ninstallation of five hundred thousand electrical horsepower, which will\r\nenable us to sell power for less than one-tenth of a cent per\r\nkilowatt-hour and still return twenty percent annual dividends. However,\r\nthe power-plant comes after the flyer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Why not build the power-plant first, and take the pleasure trip\r\nafterward?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are several reasons. The principal one is that Dick and I would\r\nrather be off exploring new worlds, while the other members of the\r\nSeaton-Crane Company, Engineers, build the power-plant.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the talk the men had reached the house, into which the others had\r\ndisappeared some time before. Upon Crane's invitation, Vaneman and his\r\ndaughter stayed to dinner, and Dorothy played for awhile upon Crane's\r\nwonderful violin. The rest of the evening was spent in animated\r\ndiscussion of the realization of Seaton's dreams of flying without wings\r\nand beyond the supporting atmosphere. Seaton and Crane did their best to\r\nexplain to the non-technical visitors how such flight was possible.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am beginning to understand it a little,\" said Dorothy finally.\r\n\"In plain language, it is like a big magnet or something, but different.\r\nIs that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it exactly,\" Seaton assured her.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to call it? It isn't like anything else that ever\r\nwas. Already this evening you have called it a bus, a boat, a kite, a\r\nstar-hound, a wagon, an aerial flivver, a sky-chariot, a space-eating\r\nwampus, and I don't know what else. Even Martin has called it a vehicle,\r\na ship, a bird, and a shell. What is its real name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It hasn't got any that I know of. What would you suggest,\r\nDottie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what general name should be applied to them, but for this\r\none there is only one possible name, 'The Skylark.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly right, Dorothy,\" said Crane.\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\" cried Seaton. \"And you shall christen it, Dottie, with a big\r\nFlorence flask full of absolute vacuum. 'I christen you \"The Skylark.\"\r\nBANG!'\"\r\n\r\nAs the guests were leaving, at a late hour, Vaneman said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. I bought an extra _Clarion_ as we came out. It tells a wild\r\ntale of an explosion so violent that science cannot explain it. I don't\r\nsuppose it is true, but it may make interesting reading for you two\r\nscientific sharps. Good night.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton accompanied Dorothy to the car, bidding her a more intimate\r\nfarewell on the way. When he returned, Crane, with an unusual expression\r\nof concern on his face, handed him the paper without a word.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"What's up, old man? Something in it?\" he asked, as he took the paper.\r\nHe fell silent as he read the first words, and after he had read the\r\nentire article he said slowly:\r\n\r\n\"True, beyond a doubt. Even a _Clarion_ reporter couldn't imagine that.\r\nIt's all intra-atomic energy, all right--some poor devil trying our\r\nstunt without my horseshoe in his pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think, Dick! Something is wrong somewhere. You know that two people did\r\nnot discover X at the same time. The answer is that somebody stole your\r\nidea, but the idea is worthless without the X. You say that the stuff is\r\nextremely rare--where did they get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Mart. I never thought of that. The stuff _is_ extremely\r\nrare. I am supposed to know something about rare metals, and I never\r\nheard of it before--there isn't even a gap in the Periodic System in\r\nwhich it belongs. I would bet a hat that we have every milligram known\r\nto the world at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said the practical Crane. \"We had better see whether or\r\nnot we have all we started with.\"\r\n\r\nAsking Shiro to bring the large bottle from the vault, he opened the\r\nliving-room safe and brought forth the small vial. The large bottle was\r\nstill nearly full, the seal upon it unbroken. The vial was apparently\r\nexactly as Seaton had left it after he had made his bars.\r\n\r\n\"Our stuff seems to be all there,\" said Crane. \"It looks as though\r\nsomeone else has discovered it also.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Seaton, their positions now reversed. \"It's\r\naltogether too rare.\"\r\n\r\nHe scanned both bottles narrowly.\r\n\r\n\"I can tell by taking the densities,\" he added, and ran up to the\r\nlaboratory, returning with a Westphal balance in his hand. After testing\r\nboth solutions he said slowly:\r\n\r\n\"Well, the mystery is solved. The large bottle has a specific gravity of\r\n1.80, as it had when I prepared it; that in the vial reads only 1.41.\r\nSomebody has burglarized this safe and taken almost half of the\r\nsolution, filling the vial up with colored water. The stuff is so strong\r\nthat I probably never would have noticed the difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who could it have been?\"\r\n\r\n\"Search me! But it's nothing to worry about now, anyway, because whoever\r\nit was is gone where he'll never do it again. He's taken the solution\r\nwith him, too, so that nobody else can get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I were sure of that, Dick. The man who tried to do the research\r\nwork is undoubtedly gone--but who is back of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody, probably. Who would want to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"To borrow your own phrase, Dick, Scott 'chirped it' when he called you\r\n'Nobody Holme.' For a man with your brains you have the least sense of\r\nanybody I know. You know that this thing is worth, as a power project\r\nalone, thousands of millions of dollars, and that there are dozens of\r\nbig concerns who would cheerfully put us both out of the way for a\r\nthousandth of that amount. The question is not to find one concern who\r\nmight be backing a thing like that, but to pick out the one who is\r\nbacking it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter thinking deeply for a few moments he went on:\r\n\r\n\"The idea was taken from your demonstration in the Bureau, either by an\r\neye-witness or by someone who heard about it afterward, probably the\r\nformer. Even though it failed, one man saw the possibilities. Who was\r\nthat man? Who was there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a lot of the fellows were there. Scott, Smith, Penfield, DuQuesne,\r\nRoberts--quite a bunch of them. Let's see--Scott hasn't brains enough to\r\ndo anything. Smith doesn't know anything about anything except amines.\r\nPenfield is a pure scientist, who wouldn't even quote an authority\r\nwithout asking permission. DuQuesne is ... hm-m ... DuQuesne ... he ...\r\nI....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. DuQuesne. I have heard of him. He's the big black fellow, about\r\nyour own size? He has the brains, the ability, and the inclination, has\r\nhe not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't want to say that. I don't know him very well, and\r\npersonal dislike is no ground at all for suspicion, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough to warrant investigation. Is there anyone else who might have\r\nreasoned it out as you did, and as DuQuesne possibly could?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that I remember. But we can count DuQuesne out, anyway, because he\r\ncalled me up this afternoon about some notes on gallium; so he is still\r\nin the Bureau. Besides, he wouldn't let anybody else investigate it if\r\nhe got it. He would do it himself, and I don't think he would have blown\r\nhimself up. I never did like him very well personally--he's such a cold,\r\ninhuman son of a fish--but you've got to hand it to him for ability.\r\nHe's probably the best man in the world today on that kind of thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not think that we will count him out yet. He may have had\r\nnothing to do with it, but we will have him investigated nevertheless,\r\nand will guard against future visitors here.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to the telephone, he called the private number of a well-known\r\ndetective.\r\n\r\n\"Prescott? Crane speaking. Sorry to get you out of bed, but I should\r\nlike to have a complete report upon Dr. Marc C. DuQuesne, of the Rare\r\nMetals Laboratory, as soon as possible. Every detail for the last two\r\nweeks, every move and every thought if possible. Please keep a good man\r\non him until further notice.... I wish you would send two or three\r\nguards out here right away, to-night; men you can trust and who will\r\nstay awake.... Thanks. Good night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDirect Action\r\n\r\n\r\nSeaton and Crane spent some time developing the object-compass. Crane\r\nmade a number of these instruments, mounted in gymbals, so that the\r\ndelicate needles were free to turn in any direction whatever. They were\r\nmounted upon jeweled bearings, but bearings made of such great strength,\r\nthat Seaton protested.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use, Mart? You don't expect a watch to be treated like a\r\nstone-crusher. That needle weighs less than half a gram. Why mount it as\r\nthough it weighed twenty pounds?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be safe. Remember the acceleration the Lark will be capable of, and\r\nalso that on some other worlds, which we hope to visit, this needle will\r\nweigh more than it does here.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Mart, I never thought of that. Anyway, we can't be too\r\nsafe to suit me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the compasses were done and the power through them had been\r\nadjusted to one-thousandth of a watt, the lowest they could maintain\r\nwith accuracy, they focused each instrument upon one of a set of most\r\ncarefully weighed glass beads, ranging in size from a pin-head up to a\r\nlarge marble, and had the beads taken across the country by Shiro, in\r\norder to test the sensitiveness and accuracy of the new instruments. The\r\nfirst test was made at a distance of one hundred miles, the last at\r\nnearly three thousand. They found, as they had expected, that from the\r\nweight of the object and the time it took the needle to come to rest\r\nafter being displaced from its line by a gentle tap of the finger, they\r\ncould easily calculate the distance from the compass to the object. This\r\nfact pleased Crane immensely, as it gave him a sure means of navigation\r\nin space. The only objection to its use in measuring earthly distances\r\nwas its extreme delicacy, the needle focused upon the smallest bead in\r\nthe lot at a distance of three thousand miles coming to rest in little\r\nmore than one second.\r\n\r\nThe question of navigation solved, the two next devoted themselves to\r\nperfecting the \"X-plosive bullet,\" as Seaton called it. From his notes\r\nand equations Seaton calculated the weight of copper necessary to exert\r\nthe explosive force of one pound of nitro-glycerin, and weighed out, on\r\nthe most delicate assay-balance made, various fractions and multiples of\r\nthis amount of the treated copper, while Crane fitted up the bullets of\r\nautomatic-pistol cartridges to receive the charges and to explode them\r\non impact.\r\n\r\nThey placed their blueprints and working notes in the safe, as usual,\r\ntaking with them only those notes dealing with the object-compass and\r\nthe X-plosive bullet, upon which they were still working. No one except\r\nShiro knew that the original tracings, from which the blue-prints had\r\nbeen made, and their final, classified notes were always kept in the\r\nvault. They cautioned him and the three guards to keep a close watch\r\nuntil they returned. Then they set out in the biplane, to try out the\r\nnew weapon in a lonely place where the exploding shells could do no\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey found that the X-plosive came fully up to expectations. The\r\nsmallest charge they had prepared, fired by Crane at a great stump a\r\nfull hundred yards away from the bare, flat-topped knoll that had\r\nafforded them a landing-place, tore it bodily from the ground and\r\nreduced it to splinters, while the force of the explosion made the two\r\nmen stagger.\r\n\r\n\"She sure is big medicine!\" laughed Seaton. \"Wonder what a real one will\r\ndo?\" and drawing his pistol, he inserted a cartridge carrying a much\r\nheavier charge.\r\n\r\n\"Better be careful with the big ones,\" cautioned Crane. \"What are you\r\ngoing to shoot at?\"\r\n\r\n\"That rock over there,\" pointing to a huge boulder half a mile away\r\nacross the small valley. \"Want to bet me a dinner I can't hit it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. You forget that I saw you win the pistol trophy of the District.\"\r\n\r\nThe pistol cracked, and when the bullet reached its destination the\r\ngreat stone was obliterated in a vast ball of flame. After a moment\r\nthere was a deafening report--a crash as though the world were falling\r\nto pieces. Both men were hurled violently backward, stumbling and\r\nfalling flat. Picking themselves up, they looked across the valley at\r\nthe place where the boulder had stood, to see only an immense cloud of\r\ndust, which slowly blew away, revealing a huge hole in the ground. They\r\nwere silent a moment, awed by the frightful power they had loosed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mart,\" Seaton broke the silence, \"I'll say those one-milligram\r\nloads are plenty big enough. If that'd been something coming after\r\nus--whether any possible other-world animal, a foreign battleship, or\r\nthe mythical great sea-serpent himself, it'd be a good Indian now. Yes?\r\nNo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. When we use the heavier charges we must use long-range rifles.\r\nHave you had enough demonstration or do you want to shoot some more?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've had enough, thanks. That last rock I bounced off of was no pillow,\r\nI'll tell the world. Besides, it looks as though I'd busted a leg or two\r\noff of our noble steed with my shot, and we may have to walk back home.\"\r\n\r\nAn examination of the plane, which had been moved many feet and almost\r\noverturned by the force of the explosion, revealed no damage that they\r\ncould not repair on the spot, and dusk saw them speeding through the air\r\ntoward the distant city.\r\n\r\nIn response to a summons from his chief, Perkins silently appeared in\r\nBrookings' office, without his usual complacent smile.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you done anything yet, after all this time?\" demanded the\r\nmagnate. \"We're getting tired of this delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it, Mr. Brookings,\" replied the subordinate. \"They've got\r\ndetectives from Prescott's all over the place. Our best men have been\r\ntrying ever since the day of the explosion, but can't do a thing without\r\nresorting to violence. I went out there myself and looked them over,\r\nwithout being seen. There isn't a man there with a record, and I haven't\r\nbeen able so far to get anything on any one of them that we can use as a\r\nhandle.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Prescott's men are hard to do anything with. But can't you...?\"\r\nBrookings paused significantly.\r\n\r\n\"I was coming to that. I thought one of them might be seen, and I talked\r\nto him a little, over the phone, but I couldn't talk loud enough without\r\nconsulting you. I mentioned ten, but he held out for twenty-five. Said\r\nhe wouldn't consider it at all, but he wants to quit Prescott and go\r\ninto business for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead on twenty-five. We want to get action,\" said Brookings, as he\r\nwrote an order on the cashier for twenty-five thousand dollars in\r\nsmall-to-medium bills. \"That is cheap enough, considering what\r\nDuQuesne's rough stuff would probably cost. Report tomorrow about four,\r\nover our private phone--no, I'll come down to the café, it's safer.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe place referred to was the Perkins Café, a high-class restaurant on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, heavily patronized by the diplomatic, political,\r\nfinancial, and sporting circles of upper-class Washington. It was famous\r\nfor its discreet waiters, and for the absolutely private rooms. Many of\r\nits patrons knew of its unique telephone service, in which each call\r\nwent through such a devious system of relays that any attempt to trace\r\nit was hopeless; they knew that while \"The Perkins\" would not knowingly\r\nlend itself to any violation of law, it was an entirely safe and\r\nthoroughly satisfactory place in which to conduct business of the most\r\nsecret and confidential character; a place from which one could enjoy\r\npersonal conversation with persons to whom he wished to remain invisible\r\nand untraceable: a place which had never been known to \"leak.\" For these\r\nreasons it was really the diplomatic and political center of the\r\ncountry, and over its secret wires had gone, in guarded language,\r\nmessages that would have rocked the world had they gone astray. It was\r\nrecognized that the place was occasionally, by its very nature, used for\r\nillegal purposes, but it was such a political, financial, and diplomatic\r\nnecessity that it carried a \"Hands Off\" sign. It was never investigated\r\nby Congress and never raided by the police. Hundreds of telephone calls\r\nwere handled daily. A man would come in, order something served in a\r\nprivate room, leave a name at the desk, and say that he was expecting a\r\ncall. There the affair ended. The telephone operators were hand-picked,\r\nmen of very short memories, carefully trained never to look at a face\r\nand never to remember a name or a number. Although the precaution was\r\nunnecessary, this shortness of memory was often encouraged by bills of\r\nvarious denominations.\r\n\r\nNo one except Perkins and the heads of the great World Steel Corporation\r\nknew that the urbane and polished proprietor of the café was a criminal\r\nof the blackest kind, whose liberty and life itself were dependent upon\r\nthe will of the Corporation; or that the restaurant was especially\r\nplanned and maintained as a blind for its underground activities; or\r\nthat Perkins was holding a position which suited him exactly and which\r\nhe would not have given up for wealth or glory--that of being the\r\nguiding genius who planned nefarious things for the men higher up, and\r\nsaw to it that they were carried out by the men lower down. He was in\r\nconstant personal touch with his superiors, but in order to avoid any\r\nchance of betrayal he never saw his subordinates personally. Not only\r\nwere they entirely ignorant of his identity, but all possible means of\r\ntheir tracing him had been foreseen and guarded against. He called them\r\non the telephone, but they never called him. The only possible way in\r\nwhich any of his subordinates could get in touch with him was by means\r\nof the wonderful wireless telephone already referred to, developed by a\r\ndrug-crazed genius who had died shortly after it was perfected. It was a\r\ntiny instrument, no larger than a watch, but of practically unlimited\r\nrange. The controlling central station of the few instruments in\r\nexistence, from which any instrument could be cut out, changed in tune,\r\nor totally destroyed at will, was in Perkins' office safe. A man\r\nintrusted with an unusually important job would receive from an unknown\r\nsource an instrument, with directions sufficient for its use. As soon as\r\nthe job was done he would find, upon again attempting to use the\r\ntelephone, that its interior was so hopelessly wrecked that not even the\r\nmost skilled artisan could reproduce what it had once been.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock Brookings was ushered into the private office of the\r\nmaster criminal, who was plainly ill at ease.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to report another failure, Mr. Brookings. It's nobody's fault,\r\njust one of those things that couldn't be helped. I handled this myself.\r\nOur man left the door unlocked and kept the others busy in another room.\r\nI had just started to work when Crane's Japanese servant, who was\r\nsupposed to be asleep, appeared upon the scene. If I hadn't known\r\nsomething about jiu-jutsu myself, he'd have broken my neck. As it was, I\r\nbarely got away, with the Jap and all three guards close behind me....\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not interested in excuses,\" broke in the magnate, angrily. \"We'll\r\nhave to turn it over to DuQuesne after all unless you get something\r\ndone, and get it done quick. Can't you get to that Jap some way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I can. I never yet saw the man who couldn't be reached, one\r\nway or another. I've had 'Silk' Humphreys, the best fixer in the\r\nbusiness, working on him all day, and he'll be neutral before night. If\r\nthe long green won't quiet him--and I never saw a Jap refuse it yet--a\r\nlead pipe will. Silk hasn't reported yet, but I expect to hear from him\r\nany minute now, through our man out there.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the almost inaudible buzzer in his pocket gave a signal.\r\n\r\n\"There he is now,\" said Perkins, as he took out his wireless\r\ninstrument. \"You might listen in and hear what he has to say.\"\r\n\r\nBrookings took out his own telephone and held it to his ear.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" Perkins spoke gruffly into the tiny transmitter. \"What've you\r\ngot on your chest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your foot slipped on the Jap,\" the stranger replied. \"He crabbed the\r\ngame right. Slats and the big fellow put all the stuff into the box,\r\ntold us to watch it until they get back tonight--they may be late--then\r\nwent off in Slats' ship to test something--couldn't find out what. Silk\r\ntackled the yellow boy, and went up to fifty grand, but the Jap couldn't\r\nsee him at all. Silk started to argue, and the Jap didn't do a thing but\r\nlay him out, cold. This afternoon, while the Jap was out in the grounds,\r\nthree stick-up men jumped him. He bumped one of them off with his hands\r\nand the others with his gat--one of those big automatics that throw a\r\nslug like a cannon. None of us knew he had it. That's all, except that I\r\nam quitting Prescott right now. Anything else I can do for you, whoever\r\nyou are?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Your job's done.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation closed. Perkins pressed the switch which reduced the\r\ninterior of the spy's wireless instrument to a fused mass of metal, and\r\nBrookings called DuQuesne on the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to talk to you,\" he said. \"Shall I come there or would you\r\nrather come to my office?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come there. They're watching this house. They have one man in\r\nfront and one in back, a couple of detectaphones in my rooms here, and\r\nhave coupled onto this telephone.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" he continued calmly as the other made an exclamation of\r\ndismay. \"Talk ahead as loud as you please--they can't hear you. Do you\r\nthink that those poor, ignorant flat feet can show me anything about\r\nelectricity? I'd shoot a jolt along their wires that would burn their\r\nears off if it weren't my cue to act the innocent and absorbed\r\nscientist. As it is, their instruments are all registering dense\r\nsilence. I am deep in study right now, and can't be disturbed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you get out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I have that same private entrance down beside the house wall\r\nand the same tunnel I used before. I'll see you in about fifteen\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Brookings' office, DuQuesne told of the constant surveillance over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"They suspect me on general principles, I think,\" he continued. \"They\r\nare apparently trying to connect me with somebody. I don't think they\r\nsuspect you at all, and they won't unless they get some better methods.\r\nI have devices fitted up to turn the lights off and on, raise and lower\r\nthe windows, and even cast shadows at certain times. The housekeeper\r\nknows that when I go to my library after dinner, I have retired to\r\nstudy, and that it is as much as anyone's life is worth to disturb me.\r\nAlso, I am well known to be firmly fixed in my habits, so it's easy to\r\nfool those detectives. Last night I went out and watched them. They hung\r\naround a couple of hours after my lights went out, then walked off\r\ntogether. I can dodge them any time and have all my nights free without\r\ntheir ever suspecting anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you free tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The time-switches are all set, and as long as I get back before\r\ndaylight, so they can see me get up and go to work, it will be all\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nBrookings told him briefly of the failures to secure the solution and\r\nthe plans, of the death of the three men sent to silence Shiro, and of\r\nall the other developments. DuQuesne listened, his face impassive.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said as Brookings ceased. \"I thought you would bull it, but\r\nnot quite so badly. But there's no use whining now. I can't use my\r\noriginal plan of attack in force, as they are prepared and might be able\r\nto stand us off until the police could arrive.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought deeply for a time, then said, intensely:\r\n\r\n\"If I go into this thing, Brookings, I am in absolute command.\r\nEverything goes as I say. Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It's up to you, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I think I've got it. Can you get me a Curtiss biplane in an\r\nhour, and a man about six feet tall who weighs about a hundred and sixty\r\npounds? I want to drive the plane myself, and have the man, dressed in\r\nfull leathers and hood, in the passenger's seat, shot so full of\r\nchloroform or dope that he will be completely unconscious for at least\r\ntwo hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy. We can get you any kind of plane you want in an hour, and Perkins\r\ncan find a man of that description who would be glad to have a dream at\r\nthat price. But what's the idea?... Pardon me, I shouldn't have asked\r\nthat,\" he added, as the saturnine chemist shot him a black look from\r\nbeneath his heavy brows.\r\n\r\nWell, within the hour, DuQuesne drove up to a private aviation field and\r\nfound awaiting him a Curtiss biplane, whose attendant jumped into an\r\nautomobile and sped away as he approached. He quickly donned a heavy\r\nleather suit, similar to the one Seaton always wore in the air, and drew\r\nthe hood over his face. Then, after a searching look at the lean form of\r\nthe unconscious man in the other seat, he was off, the plane climbing\r\nswiftly under his expert hand. He took a wide circle to the west and\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nSoon Shiro and the two guards, hearing the roar of an approaching\r\nairplane, looked out and saw what they supposed to be Crane's biplane\r\ncoming down with terrific speed in an almost vertical nose-dive, as\r\nthough the driver were in an extremity of haste. Flattening out just in\r\ntime to avert destruction it taxied up the field almost to the house.\r\nThe watchers saw a man recognizable as Seaton by his suit and his\r\nunmistakable physique stand up and wave both arms frantically, heard him\r\nshout hoarsely \"... all of you ... out here,\" saw him point to Crane's\r\napparently lifeless form and slump down in his seat. All three ran out\r\nto help the unconscious aviators, but just as they reached the machine\r\nthere were three silenced reports and the three men fell to the ground.\r\nDuQuesne leaped lightly out of the machine and looked narrowly at the\r\nbodies at his feet. He saw that the two detectives were dead, but found\r\nwith some chagrin that the Japanese still showed faint signs of life. He\r\nhalf drew his pistol to finish the job, but observing that the victim\r\nwas probably fatally wounded he thrust it back into its holster and\r\nwent on into the house. Drawing on rubber gloves he rapidly blew the\r\ndoor off the safe with nitro-glycerin and took out everything it\r\ncontained. He set aside a roll of blueprints, numerous notebooks, some\r\nmoney and other valuables, and a small vial of solution--but of the\r\nlarger bottle there was no trace. He then ransacked the entire house,\r\nfrom cellar to attic, with no better success. So cleverly was the\r\nentrance to the vault concealed in the basement wall that he failed to\r\ndiscover it.\r\n\r\n\"I might have expected this of Crane,\" he thought, half aloud, \"after\r\nall the warning that fool Brookings persisted in giving him. This is the\r\nnatural result of his nonsense. The rest of the solution is probably in\r\nthe safest safe-deposit vault in the United States. But I've got their\r\nplans and notes, and enough solution for the present. I'll get the rest\r\nof it when I want it--there's more than one way to kill any cat that\r\never lived!\"\r\n\r\nReturning to the machine, DuQuesne calmly stepped over the bodies of the\r\ndetectives and the unconscious form of the dying Japanese, who was\r\nuttering an occasional groan. He started the engine and took his seat.\r\nThere was an increasing roar as he opened the throttle, and soon he\r\ndescended upon the field from which he had set out. He noted that there\r\nwas a man in an automobile at some distance from the hangar, evidently\r\nwaiting to take care of the plane and his still unconscious passenger.\r\nRapidly resuming his ordinary clothing, he stepped into his automobile\r\nand was soon back in his own rooms, poring over the blueprints and\r\nnotebooks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeaton and Crane both felt that something was wrong when they approached\r\nthe landing field and saw that the landing-lights were not burning, as\r\nthey always were kept lighted whenever the plane was abroad after dark.\r\nBy the dim light of the old moon Crane made a bumpy landing and they\r\nsprang from their seats and hastened toward the house. As they neared it\r\nthey heard a faint moan and turned toward the sound, Seaton whipping out\r\nhis electric torch with one hand and his automatic pistol with the\r\nother. At the sight that met their eyes, however, he hastily replaced\r\nthe weapon and bent over Shiro, a touch assuring him that the other two\r\nwere beyond the reach of help. Silently they picked up the injured man\r\nand carried him gently into his own room, barely glancing at the wrecked\r\nsafe on the way. Seaton applied first-aid treatment to the ghastly wound\r\nin Shiro's head, which both men supposed to be certainly fatal, while\r\nCrane called a noted surgeon, asking him to come at once. He then\r\ntelephoned the coroner, the police, and finally Prescott, with whom he\r\nheld a long conversation.\r\n\r\nHaving done all in their power for the unfortunate man, they stood at\r\nhis bedside, their anger all the more terrible for the fact that it was\r\nsilent. Seaton stood with every muscle tense. He was seething with rage,\r\nhis face purple and his eyes almost emitting sparks, his teeth clenched\r\nuntil the muscles of his jaws stood out in bands and lumps. His right\r\nhand, white-knuckled, gripped the butt of his pistol, while under his\r\nleft the brass rail of the bed slowly bent under the intensity of his\r\nunconscious muscular effort. Crane stood still, apparently impassive,\r\nbut with his face perfectly white and with every feature stern and cold\r\nas though cut from marble. Seaton was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Mart,\" he gritted, his voice husky with fury, \"a man who would leave\r\nanother man alone to die after giving him that, ain't a man--he's a\r\nthing. If Shiro dies and we can ever find out who did it I'll shoot him\r\nwith the biggest explosive charge I've got. No, I won't either, that'd\r\nbe too sudden. I'll take him apart with my bare hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will find him, Dick,\" Crane replied in a level, deadly voice\r\nentirely unlike his usual tone. \"That is one thing money can do. We will\r\nget him if money, influence, and detectives can do it.\"\r\n\r\nThe tension was relieved by the arrival of the surgeon and his two\r\nnurses, who set to work with the machine-like rapidity and precision of\r\ntheir highly-specialized craft. After a few minutes, the work completed,\r\nthe surgeon turned to the two men who had been watching him so intently,\r\nwith a smile upon his clean-shaven face.\r\n\r\n\"Merely a scalp wound, Mr. Crane,\" he stated. \"He should recover\r\nconsciousness in an hour or so.\" Then, breaking in upon Seaton's\r\nexclamation, \"It looks much worse than it really is. The bullet glanced\r\noff the skull instead of penetrating it, stunning him by the force of the\r\nblow. There are no indications that the brain is affected in any way,\r\nand while the affected area of the scalp is large, it is a clean wound\r\nand should heal rapidly. He will probably be up and around in a couple\r\nof days, and by the time his hair grows again, he will not be able to\r\nfind a scar.\"\r\n\r\nAs he took his leave, the police and coroner arrived. After making a\r\nthorough investigation, in which they learned what had been stolen and\r\nshrewdly deduced the manner in which the robbery had been accomplished,\r\nthey departed, taking with them the bodies. They were authorized by\r\nCrane to offer a reward of one million dollars for information leading\r\nto the arrest and conviction of the murderer. After everyone except the\r\nnurses had gone, Crane showed them the rooms they were to occupy while\r\ncaring for the wounded man. As the surgeon had foretold, Shiro soon\r\nrecovered consciousness. After telling his story he dropped into a deep\r\nsleep, and Seaton and Crane, after another telephonic conference with\r\nPrescott, retired for the rest of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe Object-Compass at Work\r\n\r\n\r\nPrescott, after a sleepless night, joined Seaton and Crane at breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it, Mr. Prescott?\" asked Crane. \"Seaton here thinks\r\nit was DuQuesne, possibly acting for some foreign power, after our\r\nflying-machine to use in war. I think it was some big industrial concern\r\nafter our power-plant. What is your opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any,\" replied the great detective after a moment. \"Either\r\nguess may be true, although I am almost positive that Dr. DuQuesne had\r\nnothing to do with it, either way. It was no ordinary burglary, that is\r\ncertain from Shiro's story. It was done by someone who had exact\r\ninformation of your movements and habits. He chose a time when you were\r\naway, probably not so much from fear of you as because it was only in\r\nyour absence that he could succeed as he did in getting all the guards\r\nout at once where he could handle them. He was a man with one accomplice\r\nor who worked alone, and who was almost exactly Seaton's size and build.\r\nHe was undoubtedly an expert, as he blew the safe and searched the whole\r\nhouse without leaving a finger-print or any other clue, however slight,\r\nthat I can find--a thing I have never before seen done in all my\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\n\"His size should help in locating him,\" declared Crane. \"While there are\r\nundoubtedly thousands of men of Dick's six-feet-one and two-fifths, they\r\nare fairly well scattered, are they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are, but his very size only makes it worse. I have gone over\r\nall the records I could, in the short time I have had, and can't find an\r\nexpert of that class with anywhere near that description.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the third guard, the one who escaped?\" asked Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"He wasn't here. It was his afternoon off, you know, and he said that he\r\nwouldn't come back into this job on a bet--that he wasn't afraid of\r\nanything ordinary, but he didn't like the looks of things out here. That\r\nsounded fishy to me, and I fired him. He may have been the leak, of\r\ncourse, though I have always found him reliable before. If he did leak,\r\nhe must have got a whale of a slice for it. He is under constant watch,\r\nand if we can ever get anything on him, I will nail him to the cross.\r\nBut that doesn't help get this affair straightened out. I haven't given\r\nup, of course, there are lots of things not tried yet, but I must admit\r\nthat temporarily, at least, I am up a stump.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Seaton, \"that million-dollar reward will bring him in,\r\nsure. No honor that ever existed among thieves, or even among\r\nfree-lances of diplomacy, could stand that strain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure of that, Dick,\" said Crane. \"If either one of our ideas\r\nis the right one, very few men would know enough about the affair to\r\ngive pertinent information, and they probably would not live long enough\r\nto enjoy the reward very thoroughly. Even a million dollars fails in\r\nthat case.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather agree with Mr. Crane, Seaton. If it were an ordinary\r\naffair--and I am as sure it is not as the police are that it is--a\r\nreward of that size would get us our man within two days. As it is, I\r\ndoubt very much that the reward will do us any good. I'm afraid that it\r\nwill never be claimed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonder if the Secret Service could help us out? They'd be interested if\r\nit should turn out to be some foreign power.\"\r\n\r\n\"I took it up with the Chief himself, just after it happened last night.\r\nHe doesn't think that it can be a foreign country. He has their agents\r\npretty well spotted, and the only one that could fill the bill--you know\r\na man with that description and with the cold nerve to do the job would\r\nbe apt to be known--was in San Francisco, the time this job was pulled\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The more you talk, the more I am convinced that it was DuQuesne\r\nhimself,\" declared Seaton, positively. \"He is almost exactly my size and\r\nbuild, is the only man I know of who could do anything with the solution\r\nafter he got it, and he has nerve enough to do anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to think it was DuQuesne,\" replied the detective,\r\nthoughtfully, \"but I'm afraid we'll have to count him out of it\r\nentirely. He has been under the constant surveillance of my best men\r\never since you mentioned him. We have detectaphones in his rooms, wires\r\non his telephone, and are watching him night and day. He never goes out\r\nexcept to work, never has any except unimportant telephone calls, and\r\nthe instruments register only the occasional scratching of a match, the\r\nrustle of papers, and other noises of a man studying. He's innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be true,\" assented Seaton doubtfully, \"but you want to\r\nremember that he knows more about electricity than the guy that invented\r\nit, and I'm not sure that he can't talk to a detectaphone and make it\r\nsay anything he wants it to. Anyway, we can soon settle it. Yesterday I\r\nmade a special trip down to the Bureau, with some notes as an excuse, to\r\nset this object-compass on him,\" taking one of the small instruments\r\nfrom his pocket as he spoke. \"I watched him a while last night, then\r\nfixed an alarm to wake me if the needle moved much, but it pointed\r\nsteady all night. See! It's moving now. That means that he is going to\r\nwork early, as usual. Now I'm morally certain that he's mixed up in this\r\nthing somewhere, and I'm not convinced that he isn't slipping one over\r\non your men some way--he's a clever devil. I wonder if you wouldn't take\r\nthis compass and watch him yourself tonight, just on general principles?\r\nOr let me do it. I'd be glad to. I say 'tonight' because if he did get\r\nthe stuff here he didn't deliver it anywhere last night. It's just a\r\nchance, of course, but he may do it tonight.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the compass had been explained to the detective he gladly\r\nconsented to the plan, declaring that he would willingly spend the time\r\njust to watch such an unheard-of instrument work. After another hour of\r\nfruitless discussion Prescott took his leave, saying that he would mount\r\nan impregnable guard from that time on.\r\n\r\nLate that evening Prescott joined the two men who were watching\r\nDuQuesne's house. They reported that all was perfectly quiet, as usual.\r\nThe scientist was in his library, the instruments registering only the\r\nusual occasional faint sounds of a man absorbed in study. But after an\r\nhour of waiting, and while the microphones made a noise as of rustling\r\npapers, the needle of the compass moved. It dipped slowly toward the\r\nearth as though DuQuesne were descending into the cellar, but at the\r\nsame time the shadow of his unmistakable profile was thrown upon the\r\nwindow shade as he apparently crossed the room.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you hear him walk?\" demanded Prescott.\r\n\r\n\"No. He has heavy Turkish rugs all over the library, and he always walks\r\nvery lightly, besides.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPrescott watched the needle in amazement as it dipped deeper and deeper,\r\npointing down into the earth almost under his feet and then behind him,\r\nas though DuQuesne had walked beneath him. He did not, could not,\r\nbelieve it. He was certain that something had gone wrong with the\r\nstrange instrument in his hand, nevertheless he followed the pointing\r\nneedle. It led him beside Park Road, down the hill, straight toward the\r\nlong bridge which forms one entrance to Rock Creek Park. Though\r\nskeptical, Prescott took no chances, and as he approached the bridge he\r\nleft the road and concealed himself behind a clump of trees, from which\r\npoint of vantage he could see the ground beneath the bridge as well as\r\nthe roadway. Soon the bridge trembled under the weight of a heavy\r\nautomobile going toward the city at a high rate of speed. He saw\r\nDuQuesne, with a roll of papers under his arm, emerge from under the\r\nbridge just in time to leap aboard the automobile, which slowed down\r\nonly enough to enable him to board it in safety. The detective noticed\r\nthat the car was a Pierce-Arrow limousine--a car not common, even in\r\nWashington--and rushed out to get its number, but the license plates\r\nwere so smeared with oil and dust that the numbers could not be read by\r\nthe light of the tail lamp. Glancing at the compass in his hand he saw\r\nthat the delicate needle was now pointing steadily at the fleeing car,\r\nand all doubts as to the power of the instrument were dispelled. He\r\nrejoined his men, informed them that DuQuesne had eluded them, and took\r\none of them up the hill to a nearby garage. There he engaged a fast car\r\nand set out in pursuit, choosing the path for the chauffeur by means of\r\nthe compass. His search ended at the residence of Brookings, the General\r\nManager of the great World Steel Corporation. Here he dismissed the car\r\nand watched the house while his assistant went to bring out the fast\r\nmotorcycle used by Prescott when high speed was desirable.\r\n\r\nAfter four hours a small car bearing the license number of a distant\r\nstate--which was found, by subsequent telegraphing, to be unknown to the\r\nauthorities of that state--drove under the porte-cochère, and the hidden\r\nwatcher saw DuQuesne, without the papers, step into it. Knowing now what\r\nto expect, Prescott drove his racing motorcycle at full speed out to the\r\nPark Road Bridge and concealed himself beneath the structure, in a\r\nposition commanding a view of the concrete abutment through which the\r\nscientist must have come. Soon he heard a car slow down overhead, heard\r\na few rapid footfalls, and saw the dark form of a large man outlined\r\nagainst the gray face of the abutment. He saw the man lift his hand high\r\nabove his head, and saw a black rectangle appear in the gray, engulf the\r\nman, and disappear. After a few minutes he approached the abutment and\r\nsearched its face with the help of his flash-light. He finally succeeded\r\nin tracing the almost imperceptible crack which outlined the door, and\r\nthe concealed button which DuQuesne had pressed to open it. He did not\r\npress the button, as it might be connected to an alarm. Deep in thought,\r\nhe mounted his motorcycle and made his way to his home to get a few\r\nhours of sleep before reporting to Crane whom he was scheduled to see at\r\nbreakfast next morning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBoth men were waiting for him when he appeared, and he noticed with\r\npleasure that Shiro, with a heavily-bandaged head, was insisting that he\r\nwas perfectly able to wait on the table instead of breakfasting in bed.\r\nHe calmly proceeded to serve breakfast in spite of Crane's\r\nremonstrances, having ceremoniously ordered out of the kitchen the\r\ncolored man who had been secured to take his place.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" the detective began, \"part of the mystery is\r\nstraightened out. I was entirely wrong, and each of you were partly\r\nright. It was DuQuesne, in all probability. It is equally probable that\r\na great company--in this case the World Steel Corporation--is backing\r\nhim, though I don't believe there is a ghost of a show of ever being\r\nable to prove it in law. Your 'object-compass' did the trick.\"\r\n\r\nHe narrated all the events of the previous night.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to send him to the chair for this job,\" said Seaton with\r\nrising anger. \"We ought to shoot him anyway, damn him--I'm sorry duels\r\nhave gone out of fashion, for I can't shoot him off-hand, the way things\r\nare now--I sure wish I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you cannot shoot him,\" said Crane, thoughtfully, \"and neither can\r\nI, worse luck. We are not in his class there. And you must not fight\r\nwith him, either\"--noting that Seaton's powerful hands had doubled into\r\nfists, the knuckles showing white through the tanned skin--\"though that\r\nwould be a fight worth watching and I would like to see you give him the\r\nbeating of his life. A little thing like a beating is not a fraction of\r\nwhat he deserves and it would show him that we have found him out. No,\r\nwe must do it legally or let him entirely alone. You think there is no\r\nhope of proving it, Prescott?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, I see very little chance of it. There is always hope, of\r\ncourse, and if that bunch of pirates ever makes a slip, we'll be right\r\nthere waiting to catch 'em. While I don't believe in holding out false\r\nencouragement, they've never slipped yet. I'll take my men off DuQuesne,\r\nnow that we've linked him up with Steel. It doesn't make any difference,\r\ndoes it, whether he goes to them every night or only once a week?\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then about all I can do is to get everything I can on that Steel crowd,\r\nand that is very much like trying to get blood out of a turnip. I intend\r\nto keep after them, of course, for I owe them something for killing two\r\nof my men here, as well as for other favors they have done me in the\r\npast, but don't expect too much. I have tackled them before, and so have\r\npolice headquarters and even the Secret Service itself, under cover, and\r\nall that any of us has been able to get is an occasional small fish. We\r\ncould never land the big fellows. In fact, we have never found the\r\nslightest material proof of what we are morally certain is the truth,\r\nthat World Steel is back of a lot of deviltry all over the country. The\r\nlittle fellows who do the work either don't know anything or are afraid\r\nto tell. I'll see if I can find out what they are doing with the stuff\r\nthey stole, but I'm not even sure of doing that. You can't plant\r\ninstruments on that bunch--it would be like trying to stick a pin into a\r\nsleeping cat without waking him up. They undoubtedly have one of the\r\nbest corps of detectives in the world. You haven't perfected an\r\ninstrument which enables you to see into a closed room and hear what is\r\ngoing on there, have you?\" And upon being assured that they had not, he\r\ntook his leave.\r\n\r\n\"Optimistic cuss, ain't he?\" remarked Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"He has cause to be, Dick. World Steel is a soulless corporation if\r\nthere ever was one. They have the shrewdest lawyers in the country, and\r\nthey get away legally with things that are flagrantly illegal, such as\r\nfreezing out competitors, stealing patents, and the like. Report has it\r\nthat they do not stop at arson, treason, or murder to attain their ends,\r\nbut as Prescott said, they never leave any legal proof behind them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, _we_ should fret, anyway. Of course, a monopoly is what they're\r\nafter, but they can't form one because they can't possibly get the rest\r\nof our solution. Even if they should get it, we can get more. It won't\r\nbe as easy as this last batch was, since the X was undoubtedly present\r\nin some particular lot of platinum in extraordinary quantities, but now\r\nthat I know exactly what to look for, I can find more. So they can't get\r\ntheir monopoly unless they kill us off....\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Go on, I see you are getting the idea. If we should both\r\nconveniently die, they could get the solution from the company, and have\r\nthe monopoly, since no one else can handle it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they couldn't get away with it, Mart--never in a thousand years,\r\neven if they wanted to. Of course I am small fry, but you are too big a\r\nman for even Steel to do away with. It can't be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so sure of that. Airplane accidents are numerous, and I am an\r\naviator. Also, has it ever occurred to you that the heavy forging for\r\nthe Skylark, ordered a while ago, are of steel?\"\r\n\r\nSeaton paused, dumbfounded, in the act of lighting his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"But thanks to your object-compass, we are warned.\" Crane continued,\r\nevenly. \"Those forgings are going through the most complete set of tests\r\nknown to the industry, and if they go into the Skylark at all it will be\r\nafter I am thoroughly convinced that they will not give way on our first\r\ntrip into space. But we can do nothing until the steel arrives, and with\r\nthe guard Prescott has here now we are safe enough. Luckily, the enemy\r\nknows nothing of the object-compass or the X-plosive, and we must keep\r\nthem in ignorance. Hereinafter, not even the guards get a look at\r\nanything we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"They sure don't. Let's get busy!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuQuesne and Brookings met in conference in a private room of the\r\nPerkins Café.\r\n\r\n\"What's the good word, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"So-so,\" replied the scientist. \"The stuff is all they said it was, but\r\nwe haven't enough of it to build much of a power-plant. We can't go\r\nahead with it, anyway, as long as Seaton and Crane have nearly all their\r\noriginal solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we can't. We must find a way of getting it. I see now that we\r\nshould have done as you suggested, and taken it before they had warning\r\nand put it out of our reach.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no use holding post-mortems. We've got to get it, some way, and\r\neverybody that knows anything about that new metal, how to get it or how\r\nto handle it, must die. At first, it would have been enough to kill\r\nSeaton. Now, however, there is no doubt that Crane knows all about it,\r\nand he probably has left complete instructions in case he gets killed in\r\nan accident--he's the kind that would. We will have to keep our eyes\r\nopen and wipe out those instructions and anyone who has seen them. You\r\nsee that, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am afraid that is the only way out. We must have the monopoly,\r\nand anyone who might be able to interfere with it must be removed. How\r\nhas your search for more X prospered?\"\r\n\r\n\"About as well as I expected. We bought up all the platinum wastes we\r\ncould get, and reworked all the metallic platinum and allied metals we\r\ncould buy in the open market, and got less than a gram of X out of the\r\nwhole lot. It's scarcer than radium. Seaton's finding so much of it at\r\nonce was an accident, pure and simple--it couldn't happen once in a\r\nmillion years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you any suggestions as to how we can get that solution?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I haven't thought of anything but that very thing ever since I\r\nfound that they had hidden it, and I can't yet see any good way of\r\ngetting it. My forte is direct action and that fails in this case, since\r\nno amount of force or torture could make Crane reveal the hiding-place\r\nof the solution. It's probably in the safest safe-deposit vault in the\r\ncountry. He wouldn't carry the key on him, probably wouldn't have it in\r\nthe house. Killing Seaton or Crane, or both of them, is easy enough, but\r\nit probably wouldn't get us the solution, as I have no doubt that Crane\r\nhas provided for everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably he has. But if he should disappear the stuff would have to\r\ncome to light, or the Seaton-Crane Company might start their\r\npower-plant. In that case, we probably could get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Possibly_, you mean. That method is too slow to suit me, though. It\r\nwould take months, perhaps years, and would be devilishly uncertain, to\r\nboot. They'll know something is in the wind, and the stuff will be\r\nsurrounded by every safeguard they can think of. There must be some\r\nbetter way than that, but I haven't been able to think of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither have I, but your phrase 'direct action' gives me an idea. You\r\nsay that that method has failed. What do you think of trying indirect\r\naction in the shape of Perkins, who is indirection personified?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring him in. He may be able to figure out something.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerkins was called in, and the main phases of the situation laid before\r\nhim. The three men sat in silence for many minutes while the crafty\r\nstrategist studied the problem. Finally he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one way, gentlemen. We must get a handle on either Seaton\r\nor Crane strong enough to make them give up their bottle of dope, their\r\nplans, and everything....\"\r\n\r\n\"Handle!\" interrupted DuQuesne. \"You talk like a fool! You can't get\r\nanything on either of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You misunderstand me, Doctor. You can get a handle of some kind on any\r\nliving man. Not necessarily in his past, you understand--I know that\r\nanything like that is out of the question in this case--but in his\r\nfuture. With some men it is money, with others power, with others fame,\r\nwith others women or some woman, and so on down the list. What can we\r\nuse here? Money is out of the question, so are power and fame, as they\r\nalready have both in plain sight. It seems to me that women would be our\r\nbest chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah!\" snorted the chemist. \"Crane has been chased by all the women of\r\nthree continents so long that he's womanproof. Seaton is worse--he's\r\nengaged, and wouldn't realize that a woman was on his trail, even if you\r\ncould find a better looking one to work on him than the girl he's\r\nengaged to--which would be a hard job. Cleopatra herself couldn't swing\r\nthat order.\"\r\n\r\n\"Engaged? That makes it simple as A B C.\"\r\n\r\n\"Simple? In the devil's name, how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy as falling off a log. You have enough of the dope to build a\r\nspace-car from those plans, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. What has that to do with the case?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has everything to do with it. I would suggest that we build such a\r\ncar and use it to carry off the girl. After we have her safe we could\r\ntell Seaton that she is marooned on some distant planet, and that she\r\nwill be returned to earth only after all the solution, all notes, plans,\r\nand everything pertaining to the new metal are surrendered. That will\r\nbring him, and Crane will consent. Then, afterward, Dr. Seaton may go\r\naway indefinitely, and if desirable, Mr. Crane may accompany him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose they try to fight?\" asked Brookings.\r\n\r\nPerkins slid down into his chair in deep thought, his pale eyes under\r\nhalf-closed lids darting here and there, his stubby fingers worrying his\r\nwatch-chain restlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Who is the girl?\" he asked at last.\r\n\r\n\"Dorothy Vaneman, the daughter of the lawyer. She's that auburn-haired\r\nbeauty that the papers were so full of when she came out last year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaneman is a director in the Seaton-Crane Company. That makes it still\r\nbetter. If they show fight and follow us, that beautiful car we are\r\nmaking for them will collapse and they will be out of the way. Vaneman,\r\nas Seaton's prospective father-in-law and a member of his company,\r\nprobably knows something about the secret. Maybe all of it. With his\r\ndaughter in a space-car, supposedly out in space, and Seaton and Crane\r\nout of the way, Vaneman would listen to reason and let go of the\r\nsolution, particularly as nobody knows much about it except Seaton and\r\nCrane.\"\r\n\r\n\"That strikes me as a perfectly feasible plan,\" said Brookings. \"But you\r\nwouldn't really take her to another planet, would you? Why not use an\r\nautomobile or an airplane, and tell Seaton that it was a space-car?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't advise that. He might not believe it, and they might make a\r\nlot of trouble. It must be a real space-car even if we don't take her\r\nout of the city. To make it more impressive, you should take her in\r\nplain sight of Seaton--no, that would be too dangerous, as I have found\r\nout from the police that Seaton has a permit to carry arms, and I know\r\nthat he is one of the fastest men with a pistol in the whole country. Do\r\nit in plain sight of her folks, say, or a crowd of people; being masked,\r\nof course, or dressed in an aviator's suit, with the hood and goggles\r\non. Take her straight up out of sight, then hide her somewhere until\r\nSeaton listens to reason. I know that he _will_ listen, but if he\r\ndoesn't, you might let him see you start out to visit her. He'll be sure\r\nto follow you in their rotten car. As soon as he does that, he's our\r\nmeat. But that raises the question of who is going to drive the car?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" replied DuQuesne. \"I will need some help, though, as at least\r\none man must stay with the girl while I bring the car back.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want to let anybody else in on this if we can help it,\"\r\ncautioned Brookings. \"You could go along, couldn't you, Perkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely,\" answered DuQuesne. \"They have everything worked out to the\r\nqueen's taste.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, then. I'll take the trip. Also,\" turning to\r\nBrookings, \"it will help in another little thing we are doing--the\r\nSpencer affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you got that stuff away from her yet, after having had her\r\nlocked up in that hell-hole for two months?\" asked Brookings.\r\n\r\n\"No. She's stubborn as a mule. We've given her the third degree time\r\nafter time, but it's no use.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" asked DuQuesne. \"Deviltry in the main office?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. This Margaret Spencer claims that we swindled her father out of an\r\ninvention and indirectly caused his death. She secured a position with\r\nus in search of evidence. She is an expert stenographer, and showed such\r\nability that she was promoted until she became my secretary. Our\r\ndetectives must have been asleep, as she made away with some photographs\r\nand drawings before they caught her. She has no real evidence, of\r\ncourse, but she might cause trouble with a jury, especially as she is\r\none of the best-looking women in Washington. Perkins is holding her\r\nuntil she returns the stolen articles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't you kill her off?\"\r\n\r\n\"She cannot be disposed of until after we know where the stuff is,\r\nbecause she says, and Perkins believes, that the evidence will show up\r\nin her effects. We must do something about her soon, as the search for\r\nher is dying down and she will be given up for dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the idea about her and the space-car?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the car proves reliable we might actually take her out into space\r\nand give her the choice between telling and walking back. She has nerve\r\nenough here on earth to die before giving up, but I don't believe any\r\nhuman being would be game to go it alone on a strange world. She'd\r\nwilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you're right, Perkins. Your suggestions are the best way out.\r\nDon't you think so, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I don't see how we can fail--we're sure to win, either way. You\r\nare prepared for trouble afterward, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, but I don't think there will be much trouble. They can't\r\npossibly link the three of us together. They aren't wise to you, are\r\nthey, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a chance!\" sneered DuQuesne. \"They ran themselves ragged trying to\r\nget something on me, but they couldn't do it. They have given me up as a\r\nbad job. I am still as careful as ever, though--I am merely a pure\r\nscientist in the Bureau of Chemistry!\"\r\n\r\nAll three laughed, and Perkins left the room. The talk then turned to\r\nthe construction of the space-car. It was decided to rush the work on\r\nit, so that DuQuesne could familiarize himself with its operation, but\r\nnot to take any steps in the actual abduction until such time as Seaton\r\nand Crane were nearly ready to take their first flight, so that they\r\ncould pursue the abductors in case Seaton was still obdurate after a few\r\ndays of his fiancée's absence. DuQuesne insisted that the car should\r\nmount a couple of heavy guns, to destroy the pursuing car if the faulty\r\nmembers should happen to hold together long enough to carry it out into\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nAfter a long discussion, in which every detail of the plan was carefully\r\nconsidered, the two men left the restaurant, by different exits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe Trial Voyage\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great steel forgings which were to form the framework of the Skylark\r\nfinally arrived and were hauled into the testing shed. There, behind\r\nclosed doors, Crane inspected every square inch of the massive members\r\nwith a lens, but could find nothing wrong. Still unsatisfied, he fitted\r\nup an electrical testing apparatus in order to search out flaws which\r\nmight be hidden beneath the surface. This device revealed flaws in every\r\npiece, and after thoroughly testing each one and mapping out the\r\nimperfections he turned to Seaton with a grave face.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than useless, every one of them. They are barely strong enough to\r\nstand shipment. They figured that we would go slowly until we were well\r\nout of the atmosphere, then put on power--then something would give way\r\nand we would never come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about the right dope, I guess. But now what'll we do? We can't\r\ncancel without letting them know we're onto them, and we certainly can't\r\nuse this stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but we will go ahead and build this ship, anyway, so that they will\r\nthink that we are going ahead with it. At the same time we will build\r\nanother one, about four times this size, in absolute secrecy, and....\"\r\n\r\n\"What d'you mean, absolute secrecy? How can you keep steel castings and\r\nforgings of that size secret from Steel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know a chap who owns and operates a small steel plant, so\r\ninsignificant, relatively, that he has not yet been bought out or frozen\r\nout by Steel. I was able to do him a small favor once, and I am sure\r\nthat he will be glad to return it. We will not be able to oversee the\r\nwork, that is a drawback. We can get MacDougall to do it for us,\r\nhowever, and with him doing the work we can rest assured that there will\r\nbe nothing off color. Even Steel couldn't buy _him_.\"\r\n\r\n\"MacDougall! The man who installed the Intercontinental plant? He\r\nwouldn't touch a little job like this with a pole!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he would. He and I are rather friendly, and after I tell him\r\nall about it he will be glad to take it. It means building the first\r\ninterplanetary vessel, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't Steel follow him up if he should go to work on a mysterious\r\nproject? He's too big to hide.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He will go camping--he often does. I have gone with him several\r\ntimes when we were completely out of touch with civilization for two\r\nmonths at a time. Now, about the ship we want. Have you any ideas?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will cost more than our entire capital.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is easily arranged. We do not care how much it costs.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton began to object to drawing so heavily upon the resources of his\r\nfriend, but was promptly silenced.\r\n\r\n\"I told you when we started,\" Crane said flatly, \"that your solution and\r\nyour idea are worth far more than half a million. In fact, they are\r\nworth more than everything I have. No more talk of the money end of it,\r\nDick.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. We'll build a regular go-getter. Four times the size--she'll\r\nbe a bear-cat, Mart. I'm glad this one is on the fritz. She'll carry a\r\ntwo-hundred-pound bar--Zowie! Watch our smoke! And say, why wouldn't it\r\nbe a good idea to build an attractor--a thing like an object-compass,\r\nbut mounting a ten-pound bar instead of a needle, so that if they chase\r\nus in space we can reach out and grab 'em? We might mount a machine-gun\r\nin each quadrant, shooting X-plosive bullets, through pressure gaskets\r\nin the walls. We should have something for defense--I don't like the\r\npossibility of having that gang of pirates after us, and nothing to\r\nfight back with except thought-waves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. We will do both those things. But we should make the power-plant\r\nbig enough to avert any possible contingency--say four hundred\r\npounds--and we should have everything in duplicate, from power-plant to\r\npush-buttons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that's necessary, Mart. Don't you think that's carrying\r\ncaution to extremes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly--but I would rather be a live coward than a dead hero,\r\nwouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You chirped it, old scout, I sure would. I never did like the looks of\r\nthat old guy with the scythe, and I would hate to let DuQuesne feel that\r\nhe had slipped something over on me at my own game. Besides, I've\r\ndeveloped a lot of caution myself, lately. Double she is, with a skin of\r\nfour-foot Norwegian armor. Let's get busy!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey made the necessary alteration in the plans, and in a few days work\r\nwas begun upon the huge steel shell in the little mountain steel-plant.\r\nThe work was done under the constant supervision of the great\r\nMacDougall, by men who had been in his employ for years and who were\r\nall above suspicion. While it was being built Seaton and Crane employed\r\na force of men and went ahead with the construction of the space-car in\r\nthe testing shed. While they did not openly slight the work nearly all\r\ntheir time was spent in the house, perfecting the many essential things\r\nwhich were to go into the real Skylark. There was the attractor, for\r\nwhich they had to perfect a special sighting apparatus so that it could\r\nact in any direction, and yet would not focus upon the ship itself nor\r\nanything it contained. There were many other things.\r\n\r\nIt was in this work that the strikingly different temperaments and\r\nabilities of the two men were most clearly revealed. Seaton strode up\r\nand down the room, puffing great volumes of smoke from his hot and\r\nreeking briar, suggesting methods and ideas, his keen mind finding the\r\nway over, around, or through the apparently insuperable obstacles which\r\nbeset their path. Crane, seated calmly at the drafting-table,\r\noccasionally inhaling a mouthful of smoke from one of his specially-made\r\ncigarettes, mercilessly tore Seaton's suggestions to shreds--pointing\r\nout their weaknesses, proving his points with his cold, incisive\r\nreasoning and his slide-rule calculations of factors, stresses, and\r\nstrains. Seaton in turn would find a remedy for every defect, and\r\nfinally, the idea complete and perfect, Crane would impale it upon the\r\npoint of his drafting pencil and spread it in every detail upon the\r\npaper before him, while Seaton's active mind leaped to the next problem.\r\n\r\nNot being vitally interested in the thing being built in the shed, they\r\ndid not know that to the flawed members were being attached faulty\r\nplates, by imperfect welding. Even if they had been interested they\r\ncould not have found the poor workmanship by any ordinary inspection,\r\nfor it was being done by a picked crew of experts picked by Perkins. But\r\nto make things even, Perkins' crew did not know that the peculiar\r\ninstruments installed by Seaton and Crane, of which their foreman took\r\nmany photographs, were not real instruments, and were made only nearly\r\nenough like them to pass inspection. They were utterly useless, in\r\ndesign and function far different from the real instruments intended for\r\nthe Skylark.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last dummy instrument was installed in the worthless\r\nspace-car, which the friends referred to between themselves as \"The\r\nCripple,\" a name which Seaton soon changed to \"Old Crip.\" The\r\nconstruction crew was dismissed after Crane had let the foreman overhear\r\na talk between Seaton and himself in which they decided not to start for\r\na few days as they had some final experiments to make. Prescott reported\r\nthat Steel had relaxed its vigilance and was apparently waiting for the\r\nfirst flight. About the same time word was received from MacDougall that\r\nthe real Skylark was ready for the finishing touches. A huge triplane\r\ndescended upon Crane Field and was loaded to its capacity with strange\r\nlooking equipment. When it left Seaton and Crane went with it, \"to make\r\nthe final tests before the first flight,\" leaving a heavy guard over the\r\nhouse and the testing shed.\r\n\r\nA few nights later, in inky blackness, a huge shape descended rapidly in\r\nfront of the shed, whose ponderous doors opened to receive it and closed\r\nquickly after it. The Skylark moved lightly and easily as a wafted\r\nfeather, betraying its thousands of tons of weight only by the hole it\r\nmade in the hard-beaten earth of the floor as it settled to rest.\r\nOpening one of the heavy doors, Seaton and Crane sprang out into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nDorothy and her father, who had been informed that the Skylark was to be\r\nbrought home that night, were waiting. Seaton caught up his sweetheart\r\nin one mighty arm and extended his hand past her to Vaneman, who seized\r\nit in both his own. Upon the young man's face was the look of a\r\nvictorious king returning from conquest. For a few minutes disconnected\r\nexclamations were all that any of the party could utter. Then Seaton,\r\nloosening slightly his bear's hold upon Dorothy, spoke.\r\n\r\n\"She flies!\" he cried exultantly. \"She flies, dearest, like a ray of\r\nlight for speed and like a bit of thistledown for lightness. We've been\r\naround the moon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Around the moon!\" cried the two amazed visitors. \"So soon?\" asked\r\nVaneman. \"When did you start?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost an hour ago,\" replied Crane readily; he had already taken out\r\nhis watch. His voice was calm, his face quiet, but to those who knew him\r\nbest a deeper resonance in his voice and a deeper blue sparkle in his\r\neyes betrayed his emotion. Both inventors were moved more than they\r\ncould have told by their achievement, by the complete success of the\r\ngreat space-cruiser upon which they had labored for months with all the\r\npower of their marvelous intellects. Seaton stood now at the summit of\r\nhis pride. No recognition by the masses, no applause by the multitudes,\r\nno praise even from the upper ten of his own profession could equal for\r\nhim the silent adulation of the two before him. Dorothy's exquisite face\r\nwas glorified as she looked at her lover. Her eyes wonderful as they\r\ntold him how high he stood above all others in her world, how much she\r\nloved him. Seeing that look; that sweet face, more beautiful than ever\r\nin this, his hour of triumph; that perfect, adorable body, Seaton forgot\r\nthe others and a more profound exaltation than that brought by his\r\nflight filled his being--humble thankfulness that he was the man to\r\nreceive the untold treasure of her great giving.\r\n\r\n\"Every bit of mechanism we had occasion to use worked perfectly,\" Crane\r\nstated proudly. \"We did not find it necessary to change any of our\r\napparatus and we hope to make a longer flight soon. The hour we took on\r\nthis trip might easily have been only a few minutes, for the Lark did\r\nnot even begin to pick up speed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShiro looked at Crane with an air of utter devotion and bowed until his\r\nhead approached the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said in his stilted English. \"Honorable Skylark shall be\r\nmarvelous wonder. If permitting, I shall luxuriate in preparing suitable\r\nrefreshment.\"\r\n\r\nThe permission granted, he trotted away into the house, and the\r\ntravelers invited their visitors to inspect the new craft. Crane and the\r\nolder man climbed through the circular doorway, which was at an\r\nelevation of several feet above the ground. Seaton and Dorothy\r\nexchanged a brief but enthusiastic caress before he lifted her lightly\r\nup to the opening and followed her up a short flight of stairs. Although\r\nshe knew what to expect, from her lover's descriptions and from her own\r\nknowledge of \"Old Crip,\" which she had seen many times, she caught her\r\nbreath in amazement as she stood up and looked about the\r\nbrilliantly-lighted interior of the great sky-rover. It was a sight such\r\nas had never before been seen upon earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the exact center of the huge shell was a spherical\r\nnetwork of enormous steel beams. Inside this structure could be seen a\r\nsimilar network which, mounted upon universal bearings, was free to\r\nrevolve in any direction.]\r\n\r\nShe saw a spherical shell of hardened steel armor-plate, fully forty\r\nfeet in diameter; though its true shape was not readily apparent from\r\nthe inside, as it was divided into several compartments by horizontal\r\nfloors or decks. In the exact center of the huge shell was a spherical\r\nnetwork of enormous steel beams. Inside this structure could be seen a\r\nsimilar network which, mounted upon universal bearings, was free to\r\nrevolve in any direction. This inner network was filled with machinery,\r\nsurrounding a shining copper cylinder. From the outer network radiated\r\nsix mighty supporting columns. These, branching as they neared the hull\r\nof the vessel, supported the power-plant and steering apparatus in the\r\ncenter and so strengthened the shell that the whole structure was nearly\r\nas strong as a solid steel ball. She noticed that the floor, perhaps\r\neight feet below the center, was heavily upholstered in leather and did\r\nnot seem solid; and that the same was true of the dozen or more\r\nseats--she could not call them chairs--which were built in various\r\nplaces. She gazed with interest at the two instrument boards, upon which\r\nflashed tiny lights and the highly-polished plate glass, condensite, and\r\nmetal of many instruments, the use of which she could not guess.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence both visitors began to ask questions, and\r\nSeaton showed them the principal features of the novel craft. Crane\r\naccompanied them in silence, enjoying their pleasure, glorying in the\r\nmighty vessel. Seaton called attention to the great size and strength of\r\nthe lateral supporting columns, one of which was immediately above their\r\nheads, and then led them over to the vertical column which pierced the\r\nmiddle of the floor. Enormous as the lateral had seemed, it appeared\r\npuny in comparison with this monster of fabricated steel. Seaton\r\nexplained that the two verticals were many times stronger than the four\r\nlaterals, as the center of gravity of the ship had been made lower than\r\nits geometrical center, so that the apparent motion of the vessel and\r\ntherefore the power of the bar, would usually be merely vertical.\r\nResting one hand caressingly upon the huge column, he exultantly\r\nexplained that these members were \"the last word in strength, made up of\r\nmany separate I-beams and angles of the strongest known special steel,\r\nlatticed and braced until no conceivable force could make them yield a\r\nmillimeter.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why such strength?\" asked the lawyer doubtfully. \"This column alone\r\nwould hold up Brooklyn Bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"To hold down the power-plant, so that the bar won't tear through the\r\nship when we cut her loose,\" replied Seaton. \"Have you any idea how fast\r\nthis bird can fly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have heard you speak of traveling with the velocity of light,\r\nbut that is overdrawn, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very much. Our figures show that with this four-hundred-pound\r\nbar\"--pointing to the copper cylinder in the exact center of the inner\r\nsphere--\"we could develop not only the velocity of light, but an\r\nacceleration equal to that velocity, were it not for the increase in\r\nmass at high velocities, as shown by Einstein and others. We can't go\r\nvery fast near the earth, of course, as the friction of the air would\r\nmelt the whole works in a few minutes. Until we get out of the\r\natmosphere our speed will be limited by the ability of steel to\r\nwithstand melting by the friction of the air to somewhere in the\r\nneighborhood of four or five thousand miles per hour, but out in space\r\nwe can develop any speed we wish, up to that of light as a limit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I studied physics a little in my youth. Wouldn't the mere force of such\r\nan acceleration as you mention flatten you on the floor and hold you\r\nthere? And any sudden jar would certainly kill you.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"There can't be any sudden jar. This is a special floor, you notice. It\r\nis mounted on long, extremely heavy springs, to take up any possible\r\njar. Also, whenever we are putting on power we won't try to stand up,\r\nour legs would crimple up like strings. We will ride securely strapped\r\ninto those special seats, which are mounted the same as the floor, only\r\na whole lot more so. As to the acceleration....\"\r\n\r\n\"That word means picking up speed, doesn't it?\" interrupted Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"The rate of picking up speed,\" corrected Seaton. \"That is, if you were\r\ngoing forty miles per hour one minute, and fifty the next minute, your\r\nacceleration would be ten miles per hour per minute. See? It's\r\nacceleration that makes you feel funny when you start up or down in an\r\nelevator.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then riding in this thing will be like starting up in an elevator so\r\nthat your heart sinks into your boots and you can't breathe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, only worse. We will pick up speed faster and keep on doing it....\"\r\n\r\n\"Seriously,\" interrupted the lawyer, \"do you think that the human body\r\ncan stand any such acceleration as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. We are going to find out, by starting out slowly and\r\nincreasing our acceleration to as much as we can stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Vaneman replied. \"But how are you going to steer her? How do\r\nyou keep permanent reference points, since there are no directions in\r\nspace?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was our hardest problem,\" explained Seaton, \"but Martin solved it\r\nperfectly. See the power-plant up there? Notice those big supporting\r\nrings and bearings? Well, the power-plant is entirely separate from the\r\nship, as it is inside that inner sphere, about which the outer sphere\r\nand the ship itself are free to revolve in any direction. No matter how\r\nmuch the ship rolls and pitches, as she is bound to do every time we\r\ncome near enough to any star or planet to be influenced by its\r\ngravitation, the bar stays where it is pointed. Those six big jackets in\r\nthe outer sphere, on the six sides of the bar, cover six pairs of\r\ngyroscope wheels, weighing several tons each, turning at a terrific\r\nspeed in a vacuum. The gyroscopes keep the whole outer sphere in exactly\r\nthe same position as long as they are kept turning, and afford us not\r\nonly permanent planes of reference, but also a solid foundation in those\r\nplanes which can be used in pointing the bar. The bar can be turned\r\ninstantly to any direction whatever by special electrical instruments on\r\nthe boards. You see, the outer sphere stays immovably fixed in that\r\nposition, with the bar at liberty to turn in any direction inside it,\r\nand the ship at liberty to do the same thing outside it.\r\n\r\n\"Now we will show you where we sleep,\" Seaton continued. \"We have eight\r\nrooms, four below and four above,\" leading the way to a narrow, steep\r\nsteel stairway and down into a very narrow hall, from either side of\r\nwhich two doors opened. \"This is my room, the adjoining one is Mart's.\r\nShiro sleeps across the hall. The rest of the rooms are for our guests\r\non future trips.\"\r\n\r\nSliding back the door, he switched on the light and revealed a small but\r\nfully-appointed bedroom, completely furnished with everything necessary,\r\nyet everything condensed into the least possible space. The floor, like\r\nthe one above, was of cushioned leather supported by springs. The bed\r\nwas a modification of the special seats already referred to. Opening\r\nanother sliding door, he showed them an equally complete and equally\r\ncompact bathroom.\r\n\r\n\"You see, we have all the comforts of home. This bathroom, however, is\r\npractical only when we have some force downward, either gravitation or\r\nour own acceleration. The same reasoning accounts for the hand-rails you\r\nsee everywhere on board. Drifting in space, you know, there is no\r\nweight, and you can't walk; you must pull yourself around. If you tried\r\nto take a step you would bounce up and hit the ceiling, and stay there.\r\nThat is why the ceilings are so well padded. And if you tried to wash\r\nyour face you would throw water all over the place, and it would float\r\naround in the air instead of falling to the floor. As long as we can\r\nwalk we can use the bathroom--if I should want to wash my face while we\r\nare drifting, I just press this button here, and the pilot will put on\r\nenough acceleration to make the correct use of water possible. There are\r\na lot of surprising things about a trip into space.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't doubt it a bit, and I'm simply wild to go for a ride with you.\r\nWhen will you take me, Dicky?\" asked Dorothy eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Very soon, Dottie. As soon as we get her in perfect running condition.\r\nYou shall be the first to ride with us, I promise you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you cook and eat? How do you see out? How about the air and\r\nwater supply? How do you keep warm, or cool, as the case may be?\" asked\r\nthe girl's father, as though he were cross-examining a witness.\r\n\r\n\"Shiro has a galley on the main floor, and tables fold up into the wall\r\nof the main compartment. The passengers see out by sliding back steel\r\npanels, which normally cover the windows. The pilot can see in any\r\ndirection from his seat at the instrument-board, by means of special\r\ninstruments, something like periscopes. The windows are made of optical\r\nglass similar to that used in the largest telescopes. They are nearly as\r\nthick as the hull and have a compressive resistance almost equal to that\r\nof armor steel. Although so thick, they are crystal clear, and a speck\r\nof dust on the outer surface is easily seen. We have water enough in\r\ntanks to last us three months, or indefinitely if we should have to be\r\ncareful, as we can automatically distill and purify all our waste water,\r\nrecovering absolutely pure H2O. We have compressed air, also in tanks,\r\nbut we need very little, as the air is constantly being purified. Also,\r\nwe have oxygen-generating apparatus aboard, in case we should run short.\r\nAs to keeping warm, we have electric heating coils, run by the\r\npractically inexhaustible power of a small metal bar. If we get too near\r\nthe sun and get too warm, we have a refrigerating machine to cool us\r\noff. Anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better give up, Dad,\" laughingly advised his daughter. \"You've\r\nthought of everything, haven't you, Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mart has, I think. This is all his doing, you know. I wouldn't have\r\nthought of a tenth of it, myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must remind you young folks,\" said the older man, glancing at his\r\nwatch, \"that it is very late and high time for Dottie and me to be going\r\nhome. We would like to stay and see the rest of it, but you know we must\r\nbe away from here before daylight.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs they went into the house Vaneman asked:\r\n\r\n\"What does the other side of the moon look like? I have always been\r\ncurious about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were not able to see much,\" replied Crane \"It was too dark and we\r\ndid not take the time to explore it, but from what we could see by means\r\nof our searchlights it is very much like this side--the most barren and\r\ndesolate place imaginable. After we go to Mars, we intend to explore the\r\nmoon thoroughly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mars, then, is your first goal? When do you intend to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't decided definitely. Probably in a day or two. Everything is\r\nready now.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Vanemans had come out in the street car, in order to attract as\r\nlittle attention as possible, Seaton volunteered to take them home in\r\none of Crane's cars. As they bade Crane goodnight after enjoying Shiro's\r\n\"suitable refreshment\" the lawyer took the chauffeur's seat, motioning\r\nhis daughter and Seaton into the closed body of the car. As soon as they\r\nhad started Dorothy turned in the embrace of her lover's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Dick,\" she said fiercely. \"I would have been worried sick if I had\r\nknown that you were way off there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew it, sweetheart. That's why I didn't tell you we were going. We\r\nboth knew the Skylark was perfectly safe, but I knew that you would\r\nworry about our first trip. Now that we have been to the moon you won't\r\nbe uneasy when we go to Mars, will you, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it, boy. I will be afraid that something terrible has\r\nhappened, every minute. Won't you take me with you? Then, if anything\r\nhappens, it will happen to both of us, and that is as it should be. You\r\nknow that I wouldn't want to keep on living if anything _should_ happen\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\nHe put both arms around her as his reply, and pressed his cheek to hers.\r\n\r\n\"Dorothy sweetheart, I know exactly how you feel. I feel the same way\r\nmyself. I'm awfully sorry, dear, but I can't do it. I know the machine\r\nis safe, but I've got to prove it to everybody else before I take you on\r\na long trip with me. Your father will agree with me that you ought not\r\nto go, on the first trip or two, anyway. And besides, what would Madam\r\nGrundy say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there _is_ a way....\" she began, and he felt her face turn hot.\r\n\r\nHis arms tightened around her and his breath came fast.\r\n\r\n\"I know it, sweetheart, and I would like nothing better in the world\r\nthan to be married today and take our honeymoon in the Skylark, but I\r\ncan't do it. After we come back from the first long trip we will be\r\nmarried just as soon as you say ready, and after that we will always be\r\ntogether wherever I go. But I can't take even the millionth part of a\r\nchance with anything as valuable as you are--you see that, don't you,\r\nDottie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so,\" she returned disconsolately, \"but you'll make it a short\r\ntrip, for my sake? I know I won't rest a minute until you get back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise you that we won't be gone more than four days. Then for the\r\ngreatest honeymoon that ever was,\" and they clung together in the dark\r\nbody of the car, each busy with solemn and beautiful thoughts of the\r\nhappiness to come.\r\n\r\nThey soon reached their destination. As they entered the house Dorothy\r\nmade one more attempt.\r\n\r\n\"Dad, Dick is just too perfectly mean. He says he won't take me on the\r\nfirst trip. If you were going out there wouldn't mother want to go along\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\nAfter listening to Seaton he gave his decision.\r\n\r\n\"Dick is right, Kitten. He must make the long trip first. Then, after\r\nthe machine is proved reliable, you may go with him. I can think of no\r\nbetter way of spending a honeymoon--it will be a new one, at least. And\r\nyou needn't worry about the boys getting back safely. I might not trust\r\neither of them alone, but together they are invincible. Good-night,\r\nchildren. I wish you success, Dick,\" as he turned away.\r\n\r\nSeaton took a lover's leave of Dorothy, and went into the lawyer's\r\nstudy, taking an envelope from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Vaneman,\" he said in a low voice, \"we think the Steel crowd is\r\nstill camping on our trail. We are ready for them, with a lot of stuff\r\nthat they never heard of, but in case anything goes wrong, Martin has\r\nwritten between the lines of this legal form, in invisible ink A-36,\r\nexactly how to get possession of all our notes and plans, so that the\r\ncompany can go ahead with everything. With those directions any chemist\r\ncan find and use the stuff safely. Please put this envelope in the\r\nsafest place you can think of, and then forget it unless they get both\r\nCrane and me. There's about one chance in a million of their doing that,\r\nbut Mart doesn't gamble on even that chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is right, Dick. I believe that you can outwit them in any situation,\r\nbut I will keep this paper where no one except myself can ever see it,\r\nnevertheless. Good-night, son, and good luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same to you, sir, and thank you. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    +--------------------------------------+\r\n    |                                      |\r\n    | _The author of this story, being a   |\r\n    | chemist of high standing and an      |\r\n    | excellent mathematician, gives us a  |\r\n    | rare gem in this interplanetary      |\r\n    | tale.

After Seaton\r\nhad mounted his motorcycle Dorothy turned toward a bench in the shade of\r\nan old elm to watch a game of tennis on the court next door. Scarcely\r\nhad she seated herself when a great copper-plated ball alighted upon the\r\nlawn in front of her. A heavy steel door snapped open and a powerful\r\nfigure clad in aviator's leather, the face completely covered by the\r\nhood, leaped out. She jumped to her feet with a cry of joyful surprise,\r\nthinking it was Seaton--a cry which died suddenly as she realized that\r\nSeaton had just left her and that this vessel was far too small to be\r\nthe Skylark. She turned in flight, but the stranger caught her in three\r\nstrides. She found herself helpless in a pair of arms equal in strength\r\nto Seaton's own. Picking her up lightly as a baby, DuQuesne carried her\r\nover to the space-car. Shriek after shriek rang out as she found that\r\nher utmost struggles were of no avail against the giant strength of her\r\ncaptor, that her fiercely-driven nails glanced harmlessly off the heavy\r\nglass and leather of his hood, and that her teeth were equally\r\nineffective against his suit.\r\n\r\nWith the girl in his arms DuQuesne stepped into the vessel, and as the\r\ndoor clanged shut behind them Dorothy caught a glimpse of another woman,\r\ntied hand and foot in one of the side seats of the car.\r\n\r\n\"Tie her feet, Perkins,\" DuQuesne ordered brusquely, holding her around\r\nthe body so that her feet extended straight out in front of him. \"She's\r\na wildcat.\"\r\n\r\nAs Perkins threw one end of a small rope around her ankles Dorothy\r\ndoubled up her knees, drawing her feet as far away from him as possible.\r\nAs he incautiously approached, she kicked out viciously, with all the\r\nforce of her muscular young body behind her heavy riding-boots.\r\n\r\nThe sharp heel of one small boot struck Perkins squarely in the pit of\r\nthe stomach--a true \"solar-plexus\" blow--and completely knocked out, he\r\nstaggered back against the instrument-board. His out-flung arm pushed\r\nthe speed lever clear out to its last notch, throwing the entire current\r\nof the batteries through the bar, which was pointed straight up, as it\r\nhad been when they made their landing, and closing the switch which\r\nthrew on the power of the repelling outer coating. There was a creak of\r\nthe mighty steel fabric, stressed almost to its limit as the vessel\r\ndarted upward with its stupendous velocity, and only the\r\ncarefully-planned spring-and-cushion floor saved their lives as they\r\nwere thrown flat and held there by the awful force of their acceleration\r\nas the space-car tore through the thin layer of the earth's atmosphere.\r\nSo terrific was their speed, that the friction of the air did not have\r\ntime to set them afire--they were through it and into the perfect vacuum\r\nof interstellar space before the thick steel hull was even warmed\r\nthrough. Dorothy lay flat upon her back, just as she had fallen, unable\r\neven to move her arms, gaining each breath only by a terrible effort.\r\nPerkins was a huddled heap under the instrument-board. The other\r\ncaptive, Brookings' ex-secretary, was in somewhat better case, as her\r\nbonds had snapped like string and she was lying at full length in one of\r\nthe side-seats--forced into that position and held there, as the design\r\nof the seats was adapted for the most comfortable position possible\r\nunder such conditions. She, like Dorothy, was gasping for breath, her\r\nstraining muscles barely able to force air into her lungs because of the\r\nparalyzing weight of her chest.\r\n\r\nDuQuesne alone was able to move, and it required all of his Herculean\r\nstrength to creep and crawl, snake-like, toward the instrument-board.\r\nFinally attaining his goal, he summoned all his strength to grasp, not\r\nthe controlling lever, which he knew was beyond his reach, but a cut-out\r\nswitch only a couple of feet above his head. With a series of convulsive\r\nmovements he fought his way up, first until he was crouching on his\r\nelbows and knees, and then into a squatting position. Placing his left\r\nhand under his right, he made a last supreme effort. Perspiration\r\nstreamed from him, his mighty muscles stood out in ridges visible even\r\nunder the heavy leather of his coat, his lips parted in a snarl over his\r\nlocked teeth as he threw every ounce of his wonderful body into an\r\neffort to force his right hand up to the switch. His hand approached it\r\nslowly--closed over it and pulled it out.\r\n\r\nThe result was startling. With the mighty power instantly cut off, and\r\nwith not even the ordinary force of gravitation to counteract the force\r\nDuQuesne was exerting, his own muscular effort hurled him up toward the\r\ncenter of the car and against the instrument-board. The switch, still in\r\nhis grasp, was again closed. His shoulder crashed against the levers\r\nwhich controlled the direction of the bar, swinging it through a wide\r\narc. As the ship darted off in the new direction with all its old\r\nacceleration, he was hurled against the instrument board, tearing one\r\nend loose from its supports and falling unconscious to the floor on the\r\nother side. After a time, which seemed like an eternity, Dorothy and the\r\nother girl felt their senses slowly leave them.\r\n\r\nWith four unconscious passengers, the space-car hurtled through empty\r\nspace, its already inconceivable velocity being augmented every second\r\nby a quantity bringing its velocity near to that of light, driven onward\r\nby the incredible power of the disintegrating copper bar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeaton had gone only a short distance from his sweetheart's home when\r\nover the purring of his engine he thought he heard Dorothy's voice\r\nraised in a scream. He did not wait to make sure, but whirled his\r\nmachine about and the purring changed instantly to a staccato roar as he\r\nthrew open the throttle and advanced the spark. Gravel flew from beneath\r\nhis skidding wheels as he negotiated the turn into the Vaneman grounds\r\nat suicidal speed. But with all his haste he arrived upon the scene just\r\nin time to see the door of the space-car close. Before he could reach it\r\nthe vessel disappeared, with nothing to mark its departure save a\r\nviolent whirl of grass and sod, uprooted and carried far into the air by\r\nthe vacuum of its wake. To the excited tennis-players and the screaming\r\nmother of the abducted girl it seemed as though the great metal ball had\r\nvanished utterly--only Seaton, knowing what to expect, saw the line it\r\nmade in the air and saw for an instant a minute dot in the sky before it\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nInterrupting the clamor of the young people, each of whom was trying to\r\ntell him what had happened, he spoke to Mrs. Vaneman.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, Dottie's all right,\" he said rapidly but gently. \"Steel's got\r\nher, but they won't keep her long. Don't worry, we'll get her. It may\r\ntake a week or it may take a year, but we'll bring her back,\" and\r\nleaping upon his motorcycle, he shattered all the speed laws on his way\r\nto Crane's house.\r\n\r\n\"Mart!\" he yelled, rushing into the shop, \"they've got Dottie, in a bus\r\nmade from our plans. Let's go!\" as he started on a run for the testing\r\nshed.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" crisply shouted Crane. \"Don't go off half-cocked. What\r\nis your plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plan, hell!\" barked the enraged chemist. \"Chase 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way did they go, and when?\"\r\n\r\n\"Straight up, full power, twenty minutes ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too long ago. Straight up has changed its direction several degrees\r\nsince then. They may have covered a million miles, or they may have come\r\nback and landed next door. Sit down and think--we need all your brains\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nRegaining his self-possession as the wisdom of his friend's advice came\r\nhome to him, Seaton sat down and pulled out his pipe. There was a tense\r\nsilence for an instant. Then he leaped to his feet and darted into his\r\nroom, returning with an object-compass whose needle pointed upward.\r\n\r\n\"DuQuesne did it,\" he cried exultantly. \"This baby is still looking\r\nright at him. Now let's go--make it snappy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. We should find out how far away they are; that may give us an\r\nidea.\"\r\n\r\nSuiting action to word, he took up his stopwatch and set the needle\r\nswinging. They watched it with strained faces as second after second\r\nwent by and it still continued to swing. When it had come to rest Crane\r\nread his watch and made a rapid calculation.\r\n\r\n\"About three hundred and fifty million miles,\" he stated. \"Clear out of\r\nour solar system already, and from the distance covered he must have had\r\na constant acceleration so as to approximate the velocity of light, and\r\nhe is still going with full....\"\r\n\r\n\"But nothing can possibly go that fast, Mart, it's impossible. How about\r\nEinstein's theory?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a theory, this measurement of distance is a fact, as you know\r\nfrom our tests.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. Another good theory gone to pot. But how do you account\r\nfor his distance? D'you suppose he's lost control?\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have. I do not believe that he would willingly stand that\r\nacceleration, nor that he would have gone that far of his own accord. Do\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sure don't. We don't know how big a bar they are carrying, so we\r\ncan't estimate how long it is going to take us to catch them. But let's\r\nnot waste any more time, Mart. For Cat's sake, let's get busy!\"\r\n\r\n\"We have only those four bars, Dick--two for each unit. Do you think\r\nthat will be enough? Think of how far we may have to go, what we may\r\npossibly get into, and what it will mean to Dottie if we fail for lack\r\nof power.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton, though furiously eager to be off, paused at this new idea, and\r\nhalf-regretfully he replied:\r\n\r\n\"We are so far behind them already that I guess a few hours more won't\r\nmake much difference. It sure would be disastrous to get out near one of\r\nthe fixed stars and have our power quit. I guess you're right, we'd\r\nbetter get a couple more--make it four, then we'll have enough to chase\r\nthem half our lives. We'd better load up on grub and X-plosive\r\nammunition, too.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Crane and Shiro carried additional provisions and boxes of\r\ncartridges into the \"Skylark,\" Seaton once more mounted his motorcycle\r\nand sped across the city to the brass foundry. The manager of the plant\r\ntook his order, but blandly informed him that there was not that much\r\ncopper in the city, that it would be a week or ten days before the order\r\ncould be filled. Seaton suggested that they melt up some copper cable\r\nand other goods already manufactured, offering ten times their value,\r\nbut the manager was obdurate, saying that he could not violate the rule\r\nof priority of orders. Seaton then went to other places, endeavoring to\r\nbuy scrap copper, trolley wire, electric cable, anything made of the\r\nruddy metal, but found none for sale in quantities large enough to be of\r\nany use. After several hours of fruitless search, he returned home in a\r\ntowering rage and explained to Crane, in lurid language, his failure to\r\nsecure the copper. The latter was unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"After you left, it occurred to me that you might not get any. You see,\r\nSteel is still watching us.\"\r\n\r\nFire shot from Seaton's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to clean up that bunch,\" he gritted through his teeth as he\r\nstarted straight for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, Dick,\" Crane remonstrated. \"We can go down to Wilson's in a\r\nfew minutes, and I know we can get it there if he has it. The \"Skylark\"\r\nis all ready to travel.\"\r\n\r\nNo more words were needed. They hurried into the space-car and soon were\r\nstanding in the office of the plant in which the vessel had been built.\r\nWhen they had made their wants known, the iron-master shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Crane, but I have only a few pounds of copper in the shop,\r\nand we have no suitable furnace.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton broke out violently at this, but Crane interrupted him,\r\nexplaining their inability to get the metal anywhere else and the\r\nurgency of their need. When he had finished, Wilson brought his fist\r\ndown upon his desk.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get it if I have to melt up our dynamos,\" he roared. \"We'll have\r\nto rig a crucible, but we'll have your bars out just as soon as the\r\nwhole force of this damned scrap-heap can make 'em!\"\r\n\r\nCalling in his foreman, he bellowed orders, and while automobiles\r\nscoured the nearby towns for scrap copper, the crucible and molds were\r\nmade ready.\r\n\r\nNearly two days passed before the gleaming copper cylinders were\r\nfinished. During this time Crane added to their already complete\r\nequipment every article he could conceive of their having any use for,\r\nwhile Seaton raged up and down the plant in a black fury of impatience.\r\nJust before the bars were ready, they made another reading on the\r\nobject-compass. Their faces grew tense and drawn and their hearts turned\r\nsick as second followed second and minute followed minute and the needle\r\nstill oscillated. Finally, however, it came to rest, and Seaton's voice\r\nalmost failed him as he read his figures.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred and thirty-five light-years, Mart. They're lost, and still\r\ngoing. Good-bye, old scout,\" holding out his hand, \"Tell Vaneman that\r\nI'll bring her back or else stay out there myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be crazy, Dick. You know I am going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? No use in both of us taking such a chance. If Dottie's gone, of\r\ncourse I want to go too, but you don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Dick. Of course this is somewhat farther than we had planned\r\non going for our maiden voyage, but where is the difference? It is just\r\nas safe to go a thousand light-years as only one, and we have power and\r\nfood for any contingency. There is no more danger in this trip than\r\nthere is in one to Mars. At all events, I am going whether you want me\r\nto or not, so save your breath.\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie like a thief, Mart--you know what we are up against as well as\r\nI do. But if you insist on coming along, I'm sure glad to have you.\"\r\n\r\nAs their hands met in a crushing grip, the bars were brought up and\r\nloaded into the carriers. Waving good-bye to Wilson, they closed the\r\nmassive door and took their positions. Seaton adjusted the bar parallel\r\nwith the needle of the object-compass, turned on the coil, and advanced\r\nthe speed-lever until Crane, reading the pyro-meters, warned him to slow\r\ndown, as the shell was heating. Free of the earth's atmosphere, he\r\nslowly advanced the lever, one notch at a time, until he could no\r\nlonger support the increasing weight of his hand, but had to draw out\r\nthe rolling support designed for that emergency. He pushed the lever a\r\nfew notches farther, and felt himself forced down violently into the\r\nseat. He was now lying at full length, the seat having automatically\r\nmoved upward so that his hand still controlled the lever. Still he kept\r\nputting on more power, until the indicator showed that more than\r\nthree-quarters of the power was in operation and he felt that he could\r\nstand but little more.\r\n\r\n\"How are you making it, Mart?\" he asked, talking with difficulty because\r\nof the great weight of his tongue and jaws.\r\n\r\n\"All right so far,\" came the response, in a hesitating, almost\r\nstammering voice, \"but I do not know how much more I can take. If you\r\ncan stand it, go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is enough for awhile, until we get used to it. Any time you want\r\nto rest, tell me and I'll cut her down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep her at this for four or five hours. Then cut down until we can\r\nwalk, so that we can eat and take another reading on distance. Remember\r\nthat it will take as long to stop as it does to get up speed, and that\r\nwe must be careful not to ram them. There would be nothing left of\r\neither car.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Talking's too darn much work, I'll talk to you again when we\r\nease down. I sure am glad we're on our way at last.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLost In Space\r\n\r\n\r\nFor forty-eight hours the uncontrolled atomic motor dragged the\r\nmasterless vessel with its four unconscious passengers through the\r\nillimitable reaches of empty space, with an awful and constantly\r\nincreasing velocity. When only a few traces of copper remained in the\r\npower-plant, the acceleration began to decrease and the powerful springs\r\nbegan to restore the floor and the seats to their normal positions. The\r\nlast particle of copper having been transformed into energy, the speed\r\nof the vessel became constant. Apparently motionless to those inside it,\r\nit was in reality traversing space with a velocity thousands of times\r\ngreater than that of light. As the force which had been holding them\r\ndown was relaxed, the lungs, which had been able to secure only air\r\nenough to maintain faint sparks of life, began to function more normally\r\nand soon all four recovered consciousness, drinking in the life-giving\r\noxygen in a rapid succession of breaths so deep that it seemed as though\r\ntheir lungs must burst with each inhalation.\r\n\r\nDuQuesne was the first to gain control of himself. His first effort to\r\nrise to his feet lifted him from the floor, and he floated lightly to\r\nthe ceiling, striking it with a gentle bump and remaining suspended in\r\nthe air. The others, who had not yet attempted to move, stared at him in\r\nwide-eyed amazement. Reaching out and clutching one of the supporting\r\ncolumns, he drew himself back to the floor and cautiously removed his\r\nleather suit, transferring two heavy automatic pistols as he did so. By\r\ngingerly feeling of his injured body, he discovered that no bones were\r\nbroken, although he was terribly bruised. He then glanced around to\r\nlearn how his companions were faring. He saw that they were all sitting\r\nup, the girls resting, Perkins removing his aviator's costume.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Doctor DuQuesne. What happened when I kicked your\r\nfriend?\"\r\n\r\nDuQuesne smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Miss Vaneman. Several things happened. He fell into the\r\ncontrols, turning on all the juice. We left shortly afterward. I tried\r\nto shut the power off, and in doing so I balled things up worse than\r\never. Then I went to sleep, and just woke up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any idea where we are?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I can make a fair estimate, I think,\" and glancing at the empty\r\nchamber in which the bar had been, he took out his notebook and pen and\r\nfigured for a few minutes. As he finished, he drew himself along by a\r\nhandrail to one of the windows, then to another. He returned with a\r\npuzzled expression on his face and made a long calculation.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know exactly what to make of this,\" he said thoughtfully. \"We\r\nare so far away from the earth that even the fixed stars are\r\nunrecognizable. The power was on exactly forty-eight hours, since that\r\nis the life of that particular bar under full current. We should still\r\nbe close to our own solar system, since it is theoretically impossible\r\nto develop any velocity greater than that of light. But in fact, we\r\nhave. I know enough about astronomy to recognize the fixed stars from\r\nany point within a light-year or so of the sun, and I can't see a single\r\nfamiliar star. I never could see how mass could be a function of\r\nvelocity, and now I am convinced that it is not. We have been\r\naccelerating for forty-eight hours!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"While we were unconscious, Miss Vaneman, we had probably attained a\r\nvelocity of something like seven billion four hundred thirteen million\r\nmiles per second, and that is the approximate speed at which we are now\r\ntraveling. We must be nearly six quadrillion miles, and that is a space\r\nof several hundred light-years--away from our solar system, or, more\r\nplainly, about six times as far away from our earth as the North Star\r\nis. We couldn't see our sun with a telescope, even if we knew which way\r\nto look for it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this paralyzing news, Dorothy's face turned white and Margaret\r\nSpencer quietly fainted in her seat.\r\n\r\n\"Then we can never get back?\" asked Dorothy slowly.\r\n\r\nAt this question, Perkins' self-control gave way and his thin veneer of\r\ndecency disappeared completely.\r\n\r\n\"You got us into this whole thing!\" he screamed as he leaped at Dorothy\r\nwith murderous fury gleaming in his pale eyes and his fingers curved\r\ninto talons. Instead of reaching her, however, he merely sprawled\r\ngrotesquely in midair, and DuQuesne knocked him clear across the vessel\r\nwith one powerful blow of his fist.\r\n\r\n\"Get back there, you cowardly cur,\" he said evenly. \"Even though we are\r\na long way from home, try to remember you're a man, at least. One more\r\nbreak like that and I'll throw you out of the boat. It isn't her fault\r\nthat we are out here, but our own. The blame for it is a very small\r\nmatter, anyway; the thing of importance is to get back as soon as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can we get back?\" asked Perkins sullenly from the corner where\r\nhe was crouching, fear in every feature. \"The power is gone, the\r\ncontrols are wrecked, and we are hopelessly lost in space.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wouldn't say 'hopelessly,'\" returned the other, \"I have never\r\nbeen in any situation yet that I couldn't get out of, and I won't be\r\nconvinced until I am dead that I can't get out of this one. We have two\r\nextra power bars, we can fix the board, and if I can't navigate us back\r\nclose enough to our solar system to find it, I am more of a dub than I\r\nthink I am. How about a little bite to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Show us where it is!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Now that you mention it, I\r\nfind that I am starved to death.\"\r\n\r\nDuQuesne looked at her keenly.\r\n\r\n\"I admire your nerve, Miss Vaneman. I didn't suppose that that animal\r\nover there would show such a wide streak of yellow, but I was rather\r\nafraid that you girls might go to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm scared blue, of course,\" Dorothy admitted frankly, \"but hysterics\r\nwon't do any good, and we simply _must_ get back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, we must and we will,\" stated DuQuesne calmly. \"If you like,\r\nyou might find something for us to eat in the galley there, while I see\r\nwhat I can do with this board that I wrecked with my head. By the way,\r\nthat cubby-hole there is the apartment reserved for you two ladies. We\r\nare in rather cramped quarters, but I think you will find everything you\r\nneed.\"\r\n\r\nAs Dorothy drew herself along the handrail toward the room designated,\r\naccompanied by the other girl who, though conscious, had paid little\r\nattention to anything around her, she could not help feeling a thrill of\r\nadmiration for the splendid villain who had abducted her. Calm and cool,\r\nalways master of himself, apparently paying no attention to the terrible\r\nbruises which disfigured half his face and doubtless half his body as\r\nwell, she admitted to herself that it was only his example, which had\r\nenabled her to maintain her self-control in their present plight. As she\r\ncrawled over Perkins' discarded suit, she remembered that he had not\r\ntaken any weapons from it. After a rapid glance around to assure herself\r\nthat she was not being watched, she quickly searched the coat, bringing\r\nto light not one, but two pistols, which she thrust into her pocket. She\r\nsaw with relief that they were regulation army automatics, with whose\r\nuse she was familiar from much target practise with Seaton.\r\n\r\nIn the room, which was a miniature of the one she had seen on the\r\nSkylark, the girls found clothing, toilet articles, and everything\r\nnecessary for a long trip. As they were setting themselves to rights,\r\nDorothy electing to stay in her riding suit, they surveyed each other\r\nfrankly and each was reassured by what she saw. Dorothy saw a girl of\r\ntwenty-two, of her own stature, with a mass of heavy, wavy black hair.\r\nHer eyes, a singularly rich and deep brown, contrasted strangely with\r\nthe beautiful ivory of her skin. She was normally a beautiful girl,\r\nthought Dorothy, but her beauty was marred by suffering and privation.\r\nHer naturally slender form was thin, her face was haggard and worn. The\r\nstranger broke the silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I'm Margaret Spencer,\" she began abruptly, \"former secretary to His\r\nRoyal Highness, Brookings of Steel. They swindled my father out of an\r\ninvention worth millions and he died, broken-hearted. I got the job to\r\nsee if I couldn't get enough evidence to convict them, and I had quite a\r\nlot when they caught me. I had some things that they were afraid to\r\nlose, and I had them so well hidden that they couldn't find them, so\r\nthey kidnapped me to make me give them back. They haven't dared kill me\r\nso far for fear the evidence will show up after my death--which it will.\r\nHowever, I will be legally dead before long, and then they know the\r\nwhole thing will come out, so they have brought me out here to make me\r\ntalk or kill me. Talking won't do me any good now, though, and I don't\r\nbelieve it ever would have. They would have killed me after they got the\r\nstuff back, anyway. So you see I, at least, will never get back to the\r\nearth alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up--we'll all get back safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we won't. You don't know that man Perkins--if that is his name. I\r\nnever heard him called any real name before. He is simply\r\nunspeakable--vile--hideous--everything that is base. He was my jailer,\r\nand I utterly loathe and despise him. He is mean and underhanded and\r\ntricky--he reminds me of a slimy, poisonous snake. He will kill me: I\r\nknow it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about Doctor DuQuesne? Surely he isn't that kind of man? He\r\nwouldn't let him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never met him before, but from what I heard of him in the office,\r\nhe's even worse than Perkins, but in an entirely different way. There's\r\nnothing small or mean about him, and I don't believe he would go out of\r\nhis way to hurt anyone, as Perkins would. But he is absolutely cold and\r\nhard, a perfect fiend. Where his interests are concerned, there's\r\nnothing under the sun, good or bad, that he won't do. But I'm glad that\r\nPerkins had me instead of 'The Doctor,' as they call him. Perkins raises\r\nsuch a bitter personal feeling, that anybody would rather die than give\r\nup to him in anything. DuQuesne, however, would have tortured me\r\nimpersonally and scientifically--cold and self-contained all the while\r\nand using the most efficient methods, and I am sure he would have got it\r\nout of me some way. He always gets what he goes after.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, Miss Spencer!\" Dorothy interrupted the half-hysterical girl.\r\n\"You're too hard on him. Didn't you see him knock Perkins down when he\r\ncame after me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe he has a few gentlemanly instincts, which he uses when he\r\ndoesn't lose anything by it. More likely he merely intended to rebuke\r\nhim for a useless action. He is a firm Pragmatist--anything that is\r\nuseful is all right, anything that is useless is a crime. More probably\r\nyet, he wants you left alive. Of course that is his real reason. He went\r\nto the trouble of kidnapping you, so naturally he won't let Perkins or\r\nanybody else kill you until he is through with you. Otherwise he would\r\nhave let Perkins do anything he wanted to with you, without lifting a\r\nfinger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't quite believe that,\" Dorothy replied, though a cold chill\r\nstruck at her heart as she remembered the inhuman crime attributed to\r\nthis man, and she quailed at the thought of being in his charge,\r\ncountless millions of miles from earth, a thought only partly\r\ncounteracted by the fact that she was now armed. \"He has treated us with\r\nevery consideration so far, let's hope for the best. Anyway, I'm sure\r\nthat we'll get back safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so sure? Have you something up your sleeve?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--or yes, in a way I have, though nothing very definite. I'm Dorothy\r\nVaneman, and I am engaged to the man who discovered the thing that makes\r\nthis space-car go....\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why they kidnapped you, then--to make him give up all his rights\r\nto it. It's like them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think that's why they did it. But they won't keep me long. Dick\r\nSeaton will find me, I know. I feel it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's exactly what they want!\" cried Margaret excitedly. \"In my\r\nspying around I heard a little about this very thing--the name Seaton\r\nbrings it to my mind. His car is broken in some way, so that it will\r\nkill him the first time he tries to run it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's where they underestimated Dick and his partner. You have heard\r\nof Martin Crane, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I heard his name mentioned in the office, together with\r\nSeaton's, but that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, besides other things, Martin is quite a wonderful mechanic, and\r\nhe found out that our Skylark was spoiled. So they built another one, a\r\nlot bigger, and I am sure that they are following us, right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can they possibly follow us, when we are going so fast and are\r\nso far away?\" queried the other girl, once more despondent.\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite know, but I do know that Dick will find a way. He's\r\nsimply wonderful. He knows more now than that Doctor DuQuesne will ever\r\nlearn in all his life, and he will find us in a few days. I feel it in\r\nmy bones. Besides, I picked Perkins' pockets of these two pistols. Can\r\nyou shoot an automatic?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the other girl, as she seized one of the guns, assured\r\nherself that its magazine was full, and slipped it into her pocket. \"I\r\nused to practise a lot with my father's. This makes me feel a whole lot\r\nbetter. And call me Peggy, won't you? It will seem good to hear my name\r\nagain. After what I've been through lately, even this trip will be a\r\nvacation for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, cheer up, Peggy dear, we're going to be great friends.\r\nLet's go get us all something to eat. I'm simply starved, and I know you\r\nare, too.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe presence of the pistol in her pocket and Dorothy's unwavering faith\r\nin her lover, lifted the stranger out of the mood of despair into which\r\nthe long imprisonment, the brutal treatment, and the present situation\r\nhad plunged her, and she was almost cheerful as they drew themselves\r\nalong the hand-rail leading to the tiny galley.\r\n\r\n\"I simply can't get used to the idea of nothing having any weight--look\r\nhere!\" laughed Dorothy, as she took a boiled ham out of the refrigerator\r\nand hung it upon an imaginary hook in the air, where it remained\r\nmotionless. \"Doesn't it make you feel funny?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a queer sensation. I feel light, like a toy balloon, and I feel\r\nawfully weird inside. If we have no weight, why does it hurt so when we\r\nbump into anything? And when you throw anything, like the Doctor did\r\nPerkins, why does it hit as hard as ever?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's mass or inertia or something like that. A thing has it everywhere,\r\nwhether it weighs anything or not. Dick explained it all to me. I\r\nunderstood it when he told me about it, but I'm afraid it didn't sink in\r\nvery deep. Did you ever study physics?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a year of it in college, but it was more or less of a joke. I\r\nwent to a girls' school, and all we had to do in physics was to get the\r\ncredit; we didn't have to learn it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me too. Next time I go to school I'm going to Yale or Harvard or some\r\nsuch place, and I'll learn so much mathematics and science that I'll\r\nhave to wear a bandeau to keep my massive intellect in place.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation they had prepared a substantial luncheon and\r\nhad arranged it daintily upon two large trays, in spite of the\r\ndifficulty caused by the fact that nothing would remain in place by its\r\nown weight. The feast prepared, Dorothy took her tray from the table as\r\ncarefully as she could, and saw the sandwiches and bottles start to\r\nfloat toward the ceiling. Hastily inverting the tray above the escaping\r\nviands, she pushed them back down upon the table. In doing so she lifted\r\nherself clear from the floor, as she had forgotten to hold herself down.\r\n\r\n\"What'll we do, anyway?\" she wailed when she had recovered her position.\r\n\"Everything wants to fly all over the place!\"\r\n\r\n\"Put another tray on top of it and hold them together,\" suggested\r\nMargaret. \"I wish we had a birdcage. Then we could open the door and\r\ngrab a sandwich as it flies out.\"\r\n\r\nBy covering the trays the girls finally carried the luncheon out into\r\nthe main compartment, where they gave DuQuesne and Perkins one of the\r\ntrays and all fell to eating hungrily. DuQuesne paused with a glint of\r\namusement in his one sound eye as he saw Dorothy trying to pour ginger\r\nale out of a bottle.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be done, Miss Vaneman. You'll have to drink it through a\r\nstraw. That will work, since our air pressure is normal. Be careful not\r\nto choke on it, though; your swallowing will have to be all muscular out\r\nhere. Gravity won't help you. Or wait a bit--I have the control board\r\nfixed and it will be a matter of only a few minutes to put in another\r\nbar and get enough acceleration to take the place of gravity.\"\r\n\r\nHe placed one of the extra power bars in the chamber and pushed the\r\nspeed lever into the first notch, and there was a lurch of the whole\r\nvessel as it swung around the bar so that the floor was once more\r\nperpendicular to it. He took a couple of steps, returned, and advanced\r\nthe lever another notch.\r\n\r\n\"There that's about the same as gravity. Now we can act like human\r\nbeings and eat in comfort.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a wonderful relief, Doctor!\" cried Dorothy. \"Are we going back\r\ntoward the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. I reversed the bar, but we will have to use up all of this one\r\nbefore we can even start back. Until this bar is gone we will merely be\r\nslowing down.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the meal progressed, Dorothy noticed that DuQuesne's left arm seemed\r\nalmost helpless, and that he ate with great difficulty because of his\r\nterribly bruised face. As soon as they had removed the trays she went\r\ninto her room, where she had seen a small medicine chest, and brought\r\nout a couple of bottles.\r\n\r\n\"Lie down here, Doctor DuQuesne,\" she commanded. \"I'm going to apply a\r\nlittle first-aid to the injured. Arnica and iodine are all I can find,\r\nbut they'll help a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right,\" began the scientist, but at her imperious gesture he\r\nsubmitted, and she bathed his battered features with the healing lotion\r\nand painted the worst bruises with iodine.\r\n\r\n\"I see your arm is lame. Where does it hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoulder's the worst. I rammed it through the board when we started\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened his shirt at the throat and bared his shoulder, and Dorothy\r\ngasped--as much at the size and power of the muscles displayed, as at\r\nthe extent and severity of the man's injuries. Stepping into the\r\ngallery, she brought out hot water and towels and gently bathed away the\r\nclotted blood that had been forced through the skin.\r\n\r\n\"Massage it a little with the arnica as I move the arm,\" he directed\r\ncoolly, and she did so, pityingly. He did not wince and made no sign of\r\npain, but she saw beads of perspiration appear upon his face, and\r\nwondered at his fortitude.\r\n\r\n\"That's fine,\" he said gratefully as she finished, and a peculiar\r\nexpression came over his face. \"It feels one hundred per cent better\r\nalready. But why do you do it? I should think you would feel like\r\ncrowning me with that basin instead of playing nurse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Efficiency,\" she replied with a smile. \"I'm taking a leaf out of your\r\nown book. You are our chief engineer, you know, and it won't do to have\r\nyou laid up.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a logical explanation, but it doesn't go far enough,\" he\r\nrejoined, still studying her intently. She did not reply, but turned to\r\nPerkins.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Mr. Perkins? Do you require medical attention?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" growled Perkins from the seat in which he had crouched immediately\r\nafter eating. \"Keep away from me, or I'll cut your heart out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" snapped DuQuesne. \"Remember what I said?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't done anything,\" snarled the other.\r\n\r\n\"I said I would throw you out if you made another break,\" DuQuesne\r\ninformed him evenly, \"and I meant it. If you can't talk decently, keep\r\nstill. Understand that you are to keep off Miss Vaneman, words and\r\nactions. I am in charge of her, and I will put up with no interference\r\nwhatever. This is your last warning.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about Spencer, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to say about her, she's not mine,\" responded DuQuesne\r\nwith a shrug.\r\n\r\nAn evil light appeared in Perkins' eyes and he took out a wicked-looking\r\nknife and began to strop it carefully upon the leather of the seat,\r\nglaring at his victim the while.\r\n\r\n\"Well, _I_ have something to say....\" blazed Dorothy, but she was\r\nsilenced by a gesture from Margaret, who calmly took the pistol from her\r\npocket, jerked the slide back, throwing a cartridge into the chamber,\r\nand held the weapon up on one finger, admiring it from all sides.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about his knife. He has been sharpening it for my benefit\r\nfor the last month. He doesn't mean anything by it.\"\r\n\r\nAt this unexpected show of resistance, Perkins stared at her for an\r\ninstant, then glanced at his coat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this was yours, once. You needn't bother about picking up your\r\ncoat, they're both gone. You might be tempted to throw that knife, so\r\ndrop it on the floor and kick it over to me before I count three.\r\n\r\n\"One.\" The heavy pistol steadied into line with his chest and her finger\r\ntightened on the trigger.\r\n\r\n\"Two.\" He obeyed and she picked up the knife. He turned to DuQuesne, who\r\nhad watched the scene unmoved, a faint smile upon his saturnine face.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor!\" he cried, shaking with fear. \"Why don't you shoot her or take\r\nthat gun away from her? Surely you don't want to see me murdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" replied DuQuesne calmly. \"It is nothing to me whether she\r\nkills you or you kill her. You brought it on yourself by your own\r\ncarelessness. Any man with brains doesn't leave guns lying around within\r\nreach of prisoners, and a blind man could have seen Miss Vaneman getting\r\nyour hardware.\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw her take them and didn't warn me?\" croaked Perkins.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I warn you? If you can't take care of your own prisoner she\r\nearns her liberty, as far as I am concerned. I never did like your\r\nstyle, Perkins, especially your methods of handling--or rather\r\nmishandling--women. You could have made her give up the stuff she\r\nrecovered from that ass Brookings inside of an hour, and wouldn't have\r\nhad to kill her afterward, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" sneered the other. \"If you are so good at that kind of thing, why\r\ndidn't you try it on Seaton and Crane?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are seven different methods to use on a woman like Miss Spencer,\r\neach of which will produce the desired result. The reason I did not try\r\nthem on either Seaton or Crane is that they would have failed. Your\r\nmethod of indirect action is probably the only one that will succeed.\r\nThat is why I adopted it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are you going to do about it?\" shrieked Perkins. \"Are you\r\ngoing to sit there and lecture all day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to do nothing whatever,\" answered the scientist coldly. \"If\r\nyou had any brains you would see that you are in no danger. Miss Spencer\r\nwill undoubtedly kill you if you attack her--not otherwise. That is an\r\nAnglo-Saxon weakness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see me take the pistols?\" queried Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I'm not blind. You have one of them in your right coat\r\npocket now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why didn't you, or don't you, try to take it away from me?\" she\r\nasked in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"If I had objected to your having them, you would never have got them.\r\nIf I didn't want you to have a gun now, I would take it away from you.\r\nYou know that, don't you?\" and his black eyes stared into her violet\r\nones with such calm certainty of his ability that she felt her heart\r\nsink.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she admitted finally, \"I believe you could--that is, unless I\r\nwere angry enough to shoot you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wouldn't help you. I can shoot faster and straighter than you can,\r\nand would shoot it out of your hand. However, I have no objection to\r\nyour having the gun, since it is no part of my plan to offer you any\r\nfurther indignity of any kind. Even if you had the necessary coldness of\r\nnerve or cruelty of disposition--of which I have one, Perkins the other,\r\nand you neither--you wouldn't shoot me now, because you can't get back\r\nto the earth without me. After we get back I will take the guns away\r\nfrom both of you if I think it desirable. In the meantime, play with\r\nthem all you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Perkins any more knives or guns or things in his room?\" demanded\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\n\"How should I know?\" indifferently; then, as both girls started for\r\nPerkins' room he ordered brusquely:\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Miss Vaneman. Let them fight it out. Perkins has his orders\r\nto lay off you--you lay off him. I'm not taking any chances of getting\r\nyou hurt, that's one reason I wanted you armed. If he gets gay, shoot\r\nhim; otherwise, hands off completely.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy threw up her head in defiance, but meeting his cold stare she\r\npaused irresolutely and finally sat down, biting her lips in anger,\r\nwhile the other girl went on.\r\n\r\n\"That's better. She doesn't need any help to whip that yellow dog. He's\r\nwhipped already. He never would think of fighting unless the odds were\r\nthree to one in his favor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret had returned from a fruitless search of Perkins' room and\r\nhad assured herself that he had no more weapons concealed about his\r\nperson, she thrust the pistol back into her pocket and sat down.\r\n\r\n\"That ends that,\" she declared. \"I guess you will be good now, won't\r\nyou, Mr. Perkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" that worthy muttered. \"I have to be, now that you've got the drop\r\non me and DuQuesne's gone back on me. But wait until we get back! I'll\r\nget you then, you....\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop right there!\" sharply. \"There's nothing I would rather do than\r\nshoot you right now, if you give me the slightest excuse, such as that\r\nname you were about to call me. Now go ahead!\"\r\n\r\nDuQuesne broke the silence that followed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now that the battle is over, and since we are fed and rested, I\r\nsuggest that we slow down a bit and get ready to start back. Pick out\r\ncomfortable seats, everybody, and I'll shoot a little more juice through\r\nthat bar.\"\r\n\r\nSeating himself before the instrument board, he advanced the speed lever\r\nslowly until nearly three-quarters of the full power was on, as much as\r\nhe thought the others could stand.\r\n\r\nFor sixty hours he drove the car, reducing the acceleration only at\r\nintervals during which they ate and walked about their narrow quarters\r\nin order to restore the blood to circulation in their suffering bodies.\r\nThe power was not reduced for sleep; everyone slept as best he could.\r\n\r\nDorothy and Margaret talked together at every opportunity, and a real\r\nintimacy grew up between them. Perkins was for the most part sullenly\r\nquiet, knowing himself despised by all the others and having no outlet\r\nhere for his particular brand of cleverness. DuQuesne was always\r\noccupied with his work and only occasionally addressed a remark to one\r\nor another of the party, except during meals. At those periods of\r\ngeneral recuperation, he talked easily and well upon many topics. There\r\nwas no animosity in his bearing nor did he seem to perceive any directed\r\ntoward himself, but when any of the others ventured to infringe upon his\r\nideas of how discipline should be maintained, DuQuesne's reproof was\r\nmerciless. Dorothy almost liked him, but Margaret insisted that she\r\nconsidered him worse than ever.\r\n\r\nWhen the bar was exhausted, DuQuesne lifted the sole remaining cylinder\r\ninto place.\r\n\r\n\"We should be nearly stationary with respect to the earth,\" he remarked.\r\n\"Now we will start back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it felt as though we were picking up speed for the last three\r\ndays!\" exclaimed Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it feels that way because we have nothing to judge by. Slowing\r\ndown in one direction feels exactly like starting up in the opposite\r\none. There is no means of knowing whether we are standing still, going\r\naway from the earth, or going toward it, since we have nothing\r\nstationary upon which to make observations. However, since the two bars\r\nwere of exactly the same size and were exerted in opposite directions\r\nexcept for a few minutes after we left the earth, we are nearly\r\nstationary now. I will put on power until this bar is something less\r\nthan half gone, then coast for three or four days. By the end of that\r\ntime we should be able to recognize our solar system from the appearance\r\nof the fixed stars.\"\r\n\r\nHe again advanced the lever, and for many hours silence filled the car\r\nas it hurtled through space. DuQuesne, waking up from a long nap, saw\r\nthat the bar no longer pointed directly toward the top of the ship,\r\nperpendicular to the floor, but was inclined at a sharp angle. He\r\nreduced the current, and felt the lurch of the car as it swung around\r\nthe bar, increasing the angle many degrees. He measured the angle\r\ncarefully and peered out of all the windows on one side of the car.\r\nReturning to the bar after a time, he again measured the angle, and\r\nfound that it had increased greatly.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Doctor DuQuesne?\" asked Dorothy, who had also been\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\"We are being deflected from our course. You see the bar doesn't point\r\nstraight up any more? Of course the direction of the bar hasn't changed,\r\nthe car has swung around it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have come close enough to some star so that its attraction swings\r\nthe bottom of the car around. Normally, you know, the bottom of the car\r\nfollows directly behind the bar. It doesn't mean much yet except that we\r\nare being drawn away from our straight line, but if the attraction gets\r\nmuch stronger it may make us miss our solar system completely. I have\r\nbeen looking for the star in question, but can't see it yet. We'll\r\nprobably pull away from it very shortly.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe threw on the power, and for some time watched the bar anxiously,\r\nexpecting to see it swing back into the vertical, but the angle\r\ncontinually increased. He again reduced the current and searched the\r\nheavens for the troublesome body.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see it yet?\" asked Dorothy with concern.\r\n\r\n\"No, there's apparently nothing near enough to account for all this\r\ndeflection.\"\r\n\r\nHe took out a pair of large night-glasses and peered through them for\r\nseveral minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Good God! It's a dead sun, and we're nearly onto it! It looks as large\r\nas our moon!\"\r\n\r\nSpringing to the board, he whirled the bar into the vertical. He took\r\ndown a strange instrument, went to the bottom window, and measured the\r\napparent size of the dark star. Then, after cautioning the rest of the\r\nparty to sit tight, he advanced the lever farther than it had been\r\nbefore. After half an hour he again slackened the pace and made another\r\nobservation, finding to his astonishment that the dark mass had almost\r\ndoubled its apparent size! Dorothy, noting his expression, was about to\r\nspeak, but he forestalled her.\r\n\r\n\"We lost ground, instead of gaining, that spurt,\" he remarked, as he\r\nhastened to his post. \"It must be inconceivably large, to exert such an\r\nenormous attractive force at this distance. We'll have to put on full\r\npower. Hang onto yourselves as best you can.\"\r\n\r\nHe then pushed the lever out to its last notch and left it there until\r\nthe bar was nearly gone, only to find that the faint disk of the monster\r\nglobe was even larger than before, being now visible to the unaided eye.\r\nRevived, the three others saw it plainly--a great dim circle, visible as\r\nis the dark portion of the new moon--and, the power shut off, they felt\r\nthemselves falling toward it with sickening speed. Perkins screamed with\r\nmad fear and flung himself grovelling upon the floor. Margaret, her\r\nnerves still unstrung, clutched at her heart with both hands. Dorothy,\r\nthough her eyes looked like great black holes in her white face, looked\r\nDuQuesne in the eye steadily.\r\n\r\n\"This is the end, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" he replied in a calm and level voice. \"The end will not come\r\nfor a good many hours, as I have calculated that it will take at least\r\ntwo days, probably more, to fall the distance we have to go. We have all\r\nthat time in which to think out a way of escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't the outer repulsive shell keep us from striking it, or at least\r\nbreak the force of our fall?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It was designed only as protection from meteorites and other small\r\nbodies. It is heavy enough to swing us away from a small planet, but it\r\nwill be used up long before we strike.\"\r\n\r\nHe lighted a cigarette and sat at case, as though in his own study, his\r\nbrow wrinkled in thought as he made calculations in his notebook.\r\nFinally he rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one chance that I can see. That is to gather up every\r\nscrap of copper we have and try to pull ourselves far enough out of line\r\nso that we will take an hyperbolic orbit around that body instead of\r\nfalling into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What good will that do us?\" asked Margaret, striving for self-control.\r\n\"We will starve to death finally, won't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily. That will give us time to figure out something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't have to figure out anything else, Doctor,\" stated Dorothy\r\npositively. \"If we miss that moon, Dick and Martin will find us before\r\nvery long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in this life. If they tried to follow us, they're both dead before\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's where even you are wrong!\" she flashed at him. \"They knew you\r\nwere wrecking our machine, so they built another one, a good one. And\r\nthey know a lot of things about this new metal that you have never\r\ndreamed of, since they were not in the plans you stole.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuQuesne went directly to the heart of the matter, paying no attention\r\nto her barbed shafts.\r\n\r\n\"Can they follow us through space without seeing us?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--or at least, I think they can.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do they do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--I wouldn't tell you if I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll tell if you know,\" he declared, his voice cutting like a knife.\r\n\"But that can wait until after we get out of this. The thing to do now\r\nis to dodge that world.\"\r\n\r\nHe searched the vessel for copper, ruthlessly tearing out almost\r\neverything that contained the metal, hammering it flat and throwing it\r\ninto the power-plant. He set the bar at right angles to the line of\r\ntheir fall and turned on the current. When the metal was exhausted, he\r\nmade another series of observations upon the body toward which they were\r\nfalling, and reported quietly:\r\n\r\n\"We made a lot of distance, but not enough. Everything goes in, this\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nHe tore out the single remaining light-wire, leaving the car in darkness\r\nsave for the diffused light of his electric torch, and broke up the only\r\nremaining motor. He then took his almost priceless Swiss watch, his\r\nheavy signet ring, his scarf pin, and the cartridges from his pistol,\r\nand added them to the collection. Flashing his lamp upon Perkins, he\r\nrelieved him of everything he had which contained copper.\r\n\r\n\"I think I have a few pennies in my pocketbook,\" suggested Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Get 'em,\" he directed briefly, and while she was gone he searched\r\nMargaret, without result save for the cartridges in her pistol, as she\r\nhad no jewelry remaining after her imprisonment. Dorothy returned and\r\nhanded him everything she had found.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to keep this ring,\" she said slowly, pointing to a slender\r\ncirclet of gold set with a solitaire diamond, \"if you think there is any\r\nchance of us getting clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything goes that has any copper in it,\" he said coldly, \"and I am\r\nglad to see that Seaton is too good a chemist to buy any platinum\r\njewelry. You may keep the diamond, though,\" as he wrenched the jewel out\r\nof its setting and returned it to her.\r\n\r\nHe threw all the metal into the central chamber and the vessel gave a\r\ntremendous lurch as the power was again applied. It was soon spent,\r\nhowever, and after the final observation, the others waiting in\r\nbreathless suspense for him to finish his calculations, he made his curt\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\n\"Not enough.\"\r\n\r\nPerkins, his mind weakened by the strain of the last few days, went\r\ncompletely insane at the words. With a wild howl he threw himself at the\r\nunmoved scientist, who struck him with the butt of his pistol as he\r\nleaped, the mighty force of DuQuesne's blow crushing his skull like an\r\neggshell and throwing him backward to the opposite side of the vessel.\r\nMargaret lay in her seat in a dead faint. Dorothy and DuQuesne looked at\r\neach other in the feeble light of the torch. To the girl's amazement,\r\nthe man was as calm as though he were safe in his own house, and she\r\nmade a determined effort to hold herself together.\r\n\r\n\"What next, Doctor DuQuesne?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. We have a couple of days yet, at least. I'll have to\r\nstudy awhile.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that time Dick will find us, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if they do find us in time, which I doubt, what good will it do?\r\nIt simply means that they will go with us instead of saving us, for of\r\ncourse they can't pull away, since we couldn't. I hope they don't find\r\nus, but locate this star in time to keep away from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" she gasped. \"You have been planning to kill both of them! I\r\nshould think you would be delighted to take them with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Far from it. Please try to be logical. I intended to remove them\r\nbecause they stood in the way of my developing this new metal. If I am\r\nto be out of the way--and frankly, I see very little chance of getting\r\nout of this--I hope that Seaton goes ahead with it. It is the greatest\r\ndiscovery the world has ever known, and if both Seaton and I, the only\r\ntwo men in the world who know how to handle it, drop out, it will be\r\nlost for perhaps hundreds of years.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Dick's finding us means that he must go, too, of course I hope that\r\nhe won't find us, but I don't believe that. I simply know that he could\r\nget us away from here.\"\r\n\r\nShe continued more slowly, almost speaking to herself, her heart sinking\r\nwith her voice:\r\n\r\n\"He is following us, and he won't stop even if he does see this dead\r\nstar and knows that he can't get away. We will die together.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no denying the fact that our situation is critical, but you\r\nknow a man isn't dead until after his heart stops beating. We have two\r\nwhole days yet, and in that time, I can probably dope out some way of\r\ngetting away from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" she replied, keeping her voice from breaking only by a\r\ngreat effort. \"But go ahead with your doping. I'm worn out.\" She drew\r\nherself down upon one of the seats and stared at the ceiling, fighting\r\nto restrain an almost overpowering impulse to scream.\r\n\r\nThus the hours wore by--Perkins dead; Margaret still unconscious;\r\nDorothy lying in her seat, her thoughts a formless prayer, buoyed up\r\nonly by her faith in God and in her lover; DuQuesne self-possessed,\r\nsmoking innumerable cigarettes, his keen mind grappling with its most\r\ndesperate problem, grimly fighting until the very last instant of\r\nlife--while the powerless space-car fell with an appalling velocity,\r\nfaster and faster; falling toward that cold and desolate monster of the\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThe Rescue\r\n\r\n\r\nSeaton and Crane drove the Skylark in the direction indicated by the\r\nunwavering object-compass with the greatest acceleration they could\r\nstand, each man taking a twelve-hour watch at the instrument board.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, did the Skylark justify the faith of her builders, and the\r\ntwo inventors, with an exultant certainty of their success, flew out\r\nbeyond man's wildest imaginings. Had it not been for the haunting fear\r\nfor Dorothy's safety, the journey would have been one of pure triumph,\r\nand even that anxiety did not prevent a profound joy in the enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"If that misguided mutt thinks he can pull off a stunt like that and get\r\naway with it, he's got another think coming,\" asserted Seaton, after\r\nmaking a reading on the other car after several days of the flight. \"He\r\nwent off half-cocked this time, for sure, and we've got him foul. We'd\r\nbetter put on some negative pretty soon hadn't we, Mart? Only a little\r\nover a hundred light-years now.\"\r\n\r\nCrane nodded agreement and Seaton continued:\r\n\r\n\"It'll take as long to stop, of course, as it has taken to get out here,\r\nand if we ram them--GOOD NIGHT! Let's figure it out as nearly as we\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\nThey calculated their own speed, and that of the other vessel, as shown\r\nby the various readings taken, and applied just enough negative\r\nacceleration to slow the Skylark down to the speed of the other\r\nspace-car when they should come up with it. They smiled at each other in\r\nrecognition of the perfect working of the mechanism when the huge vessel\r\nhad spun, with a sickening lurch, through a complete half-circle, the\r\ninstant the power was reversed. Each knew that they were actually\r\ntraveling in a direction that to them seemed \"down,\" but with a\r\nconstantly diminishing velocity, even though they seemed to be still\r\ngoing \"up\" with an increasing speed.\r\n\r\nUntil nearly the end of the calculated time the two took turns as\r\nbefore, but as the time of meeting drew near both men were on the alert,\r\ntaking readings on the object-compass every few minutes. Finally Crane\r\nannounced:\r\n\r\n\"We are almost on them, Dick. They are so close that it is almost\r\nimpossible to time the needle--less than ten thousand miles.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton gradually increased the retarding force until the needle showed\r\nthat they were very close to the other vessel and maintaining a constant\r\ndistance from it. He then shut off the power, and both men hurried to\r\nthe bottom window to search for the fleeing ship with their powerful\r\nnight-glasses. They looked at each other in amazement as they felt\r\nthemselves falling almost directly downward, with an astounding\r\nacceleration.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it, Dick?\" asked Crane calmly, as he brought his\r\nglasses to his eyes and stared out into the black heavens, studded with\r\nmultitudes of brilliant and unfamiliar stars.\r\n\r\n\"I don't make it at all, Mart. By the feel, I should say we were falling\r\ntoward something that would make our earth look like a pin-head. I\r\nremember now that I noticed that the bus was getting a little out of\r\nplumb with the bar all this last watch. I didn't pay much attention to\r\nit, as I couldn't see anything out of the way. Nothing but a sun could\r\nbe big enough to raise all this disturbance, and I can't see any close\r\nenough to be afraid of, can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, and I cannot see the Steel space-car, either. Look sharp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Seaton continued to argue as he peered out into the night,\r\n\"it is theoretically possible that a heavenly body can exist large\r\nenough so that it could exert even this much force and still appear no\r\nlarger than an ordinary star, but I don't believe it is probable. Give\r\nme three or four minutes of visual angle and I'll believe anything, but\r\nnone of these stars are big enough to have any visual angle at all.\r\nFurthermore....\"\r\n\r\n\"There is at least half a degree of visual angle!\" broke in his friend\r\nintensely. \"Just to the left of that constellation that looks so much\r\nlike a question mark. It is not bright, but dark, like a very dark\r\nmoon--barely perceptible.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton pointed his glass eagerly in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\n\"Great Cat!\" he ejaculated. \"I'll say that's some moon! Wouldn't that\r\nrattle your slats? And there's DuQuesne's bus, too, on the right edge.\r\nGet it?\"\r\n\r\nAs they stood up, Seaton's mood turned to one of deadly earnestness, and\r\na grave look came over Crane's face as the seriousness of their\r\nsituation dawned upon them. Trained mathematicians both, they knew\r\ninstantly that that unknown world was of inconceivable mass, and that\r\ntheir chance of escape was none too good, even should they abandon the\r\nother craft to its fate. Seaton stared at Crane, his fists clenched and\r\ndrops of perspiration standing on his forehead. Suddenly, with agony in\r\nhis eyes and in his voice, he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Mighty slim chance of getting away if we go through with it, old\r\nman.... Hate like the devil.... Have no right to ask you to throw\r\nyourself away, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough of that, Dick. You had nothing to do with my coming: you could\r\nnot have kept me away. We will see it through.\"\r\n\r\nTheir hands met in a fierce clasp, broken by Seaton, as he jumped to the\r\nlevers with an intense:\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's get busy!\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they had reduced the distance until they could plainly\r\nsee the other vessel, a small black circle against the faintly luminous\r\ndisk. As it leaped into clear relief in the beam of his powerful\r\nsearchlight, Seaton focused the great attractor upon the fugitive car\r\nand threw in the lever which released the full force of that mighty\r\nmagnet, while Crane attracted the attention of the vessel's occupants by\r\nmeans of a momentary burst of solid machine-gun bullets, which he knew\r\nwould glance harmlessly off the steel hull.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter an interminable silence, DuQuesne drew himself out of his seat. He\r\ntook a long inhalation, deposited the butt of his cigarette carefully in\r\nhis ash tray, and made his way to his room. He returned with three heavy\r\nfur suits provided with air helmets, two of which he handed to the\r\ngirls, who were huddled in a seat with their arms around each other.\r\nThese suits were the armor designed by Crane for use in exploring the\r\nvacuum and the intense cold of dead worlds. Air-tight, braced with fine\r\nsteel netting, and supplied with air at normal pressure from small tanks\r\nby automatic valves, they made their wearers independent of surrounding\r\nconditions of pressure and temperature.\r\n\r\n\"The next thing to do,\" DuQuesne stated calmly, \"is to get the copper\r\noff the outside of the ship. That is the last resort, as it robs us of\r\nour only safeguard against meteorites, but this is the time for\r\nlast-resort measures. I'm going after that copper. Put these suits on,\r\nas our air will leave as soon as I open the door, and practically an\r\nabsolute vacuum and equally absolute zero will come in.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the ship was enveloped in a blinding glare and they were\r\nthrown flat as the vessel slowed down in its terrific fall. The thought\r\nflashed across DuQuesne's mind that they had already entered the\r\natmosphere of that monster globe and were being slowed down and set\r\nafire by its friction, but he dismissed it as quickly as it had\r\ncome--the light in that case would be the green of copper, not this\r\nbluish-white. His next thought was that there had been a collision of\r\nmeteors in the neighborhood, and that their retardation was due to the\r\nouter coating. While these thoughts were flickering through his mind,\r\nthey heard an insistent metallic tapping, which DuQuesne recognized\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\n\"A machine-gun!\" he blurted in amazement. \"How in....\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Dick!\" screamed Dorothy, with flashing eyes. \"He's found us, just\r\nas I knew he would. You couldn't beat Dick and Martin in a thousand\r\nyears!\"\r\n\r\nThe tension under which they had been laboring so long suddenly\r\nreleased, the two girls locked their arms around each other in a\r\nhalf-hysterical outburst of relief. Margaret's meaningless words and\r\nDorothy's incoherent praises of her lover and Crane mingled with their\r\nracking sobs as each fought to recover self-possession.\r\n\r\nDuQuesne had instantly mounted to the upper window. Throwing back the\r\ncover, he flashed his torch rapidly. The glare of the searchlight was\r\nsnuffed out and he saw a flashing light spell out in dots and dashes:\r\n\r\n\"Can you read Morse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he signalled back. \"Power gone, drifting into....\"\r\n\r\n\"We know it. Will you resist?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you fur pressure-suits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put them on. Shut off your outer coating. Will touch so your upper door\r\nagainst our lower. Open, transfer quick.\"\r\n\r\n\"O. K.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHastily returning to the main compartment, he briefly informed the girls\r\nas to what had happened. All three donned the suits and stationed\r\nthemselves at the upper opening. Rapidly, but with unerring precision,\r\nthe two ships were brought into place and held together by the\r\nattractor. As the doors were opened, there was a screaming hiss as the\r\nair of the vessels escaped through the narrow crack between them. The\r\npassengers saw the moisture in the air turn into snow, and saw the air\r\nitself first liquefy and then freeze into a solid coating upon the metal\r\naround the orifices at the touch of the frightful cold outside--the\r\nabsolute zero of interstellar space, about four hundred sixty degrees\r\nbelow zero in the every-day scale of temperature. The moisture of their\r\nbreath condensed upon the inside of the double glasses of their helmets,\r\nrendering sight useless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DuQuesne seized her and tossed her lightly through the\r\ndoorway in such a manner that she would not touch the metal, which would\r\nhave frozen instantly anything coming into contact with it.]\r\n\r\nDorothy pushed the other girl ahead of her. DuQuesne seized her and\r\ntossed her lightly through the doorway in such a manner that she would\r\nnot touch the metal, which would have frozen instantly anything coming\r\ninto contact with it. Seaton was waiting. Feeling a woman's slender form\r\nin his arms, he crushed her to him in a mighty embrace, and was\r\nastonished to feel movements of resistance, and to hear a strange,\r\ngirlish voice cry out:\r\n\r\n\"Don't! It's me! Dorothy's next!\"\r\n\r\nReleasing her abruptly, he passed her on to Martin and turned just in\r\ntime to catch his sweetheart, who, knowing that he would be there and\r\nrecognizing his powerful arms at the first touch, returned his embrace\r\nwith a fierce intensity which even he had never suspected that she could\r\nexert. They stood motionless, locked in each other's arms, while\r\nDuQuesne dove through the opening and snapped the door shut behind him.\r\n\r\nThe air-pressure and temperature back to normal, the cumbersome suits\r\nwere hastily removed, and Seaton's lips met Dorothy's in a long,\r\nclinging caress. DuQuesne's cold, incisive voice broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"Every second counts. I would suggest that we go somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute!\" snapped Crane. \"Dick, what shall we do with this\r\nmurderer?\"\r\n\r\nSeaton had forgotten DuQuesne utterly in the joy of holding his\r\nsweetheart in his arms, but at his friend's words, he faced about and\r\nhis face grew stern.\r\n\r\n\"By rights, we ought to chuck him back into his own tub and let him go\r\nto the devil,\" he said savagely, doubling his fists and turning swiftly.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Dick,\" remonstrated Dorothy, seizing his arm. \"He treated us\r\nvery well, and saved my life once. Anyway, you mustn't kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I suppose not,\" grudgingly assented her lover, \"and I won't,\r\neither, unless he gives me at least half an excuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might iron him to a post?\" suggested Crane, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I think there's a better way,\" replied Seaton. \"He may be able to work\r\nhis way. His brain hits on all twelve, and he's strong as a bull. Our\r\nchance of getting back isn't a certainty, as you know.\" He turned to\r\nDuQuesne.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that your word is good.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has never been broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you give your word to act as one of the party, for the good of us\r\nall, if we don't iron you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--until we get back to the earth. Provided, of course, that I\r\nreserve the right to escape at any time between now and then if I wish\r\nto and can do so without injuring the vessel or any member of the party\r\nin any way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed. Let's get busy--we're altogether too close to that dud there to\r\nsuit me. Sit tight, everybody, we're on our way!\" he cried, as he turned\r\nto the board, applied one notch of power, and shut off the attractor.\r\nThe Skylark slowed down a trifle in its mad fall, the other vessel\r\ncontinued on its way--a helpless hulk, manned by a corpse, falling to\r\ndestruction upon the bleak wastes of a desert world.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" said DuQuesne sharply. \"Your power is the same as mine was,\r\nin proportion to your mass, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then our goose is cooked. I couldn't pull away from it with everything\r\nI had, couldn't even swing out enough to make an orbit, either\r\nhyperbolic or elliptical around it. With a reserve bar you will be able\r\nto make an orbit, but you can't get away from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for the dope. That saves our wasting some effort. Our\r\npower-plant can be doubled up in emergencies, thanks to Martin's\r\ncautious old bean. We'll simply double her up and go away from here.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing we didn't consider quite enough,\" said Crane,\r\nthoughtfully. \"I started to faint back there before the full power of\r\neven one motor was in use. With the motor doubled, each of us will be\r\nheld down by a force of many tons--we would all be helpless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" added Dorothy, with foreboding in her eyes, \"we were all\r\nunconscious on the way out, except Dr. DuQuesne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Blackie and I, as the huskiest members of the party, will\r\ngive her the juice until only one of us is left with his eyes open. If\r\nthat isn't enough to pull us clear, we'll have to give her the whole\r\nworks and let her ramble by herself after we all go out. How about it,\r\nBlackie?\" unconsciously falling into the old Bureau nickname. \"Do you\r\nthink we can make it stop at unconsciousness with double power on?\"\r\n\r\nDuQuesne studied the two girls carefully.\r\n\r\n\"With oxygen in the helmets instead of air, we all may be able to stand\r\nit. These special cushions keep the body from flattening out, as it\r\nnormally would under such a pressure. The unconsciousness is simply a\r\nsuffocation caused by the lateral muscles being unable to lift the\r\nribs--in other words, the air-pumps aren't strong enough for the added\r\nwork put upon them. At least we stand a chance this way. We may live\r\nthrough the pressure while we are pulling away, and we certainly shall\r\ndie if we don't pull away.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a brief consultation, the men set to work with furious haste.\r\nWhile Crane placed extra bars in each of the motors and DuQuesne made\r\ncareful observations upon the apparent size of the now plainly visible\r\nworld toward which they were being drawn so irresistibly, Seaton\r\nconnected the helmets with the air-and oxygen-tanks through a valve upon\r\nthe board, by means of which he could change at will the oxygen content\r\nof the air they breathed. He then placed the strange girl, who seemed\r\ndazed by the frightful sensation of their never-ending fall, upon one of\r\nthe seats, fitted the cumbersome helmet upon her head, strapped her\r\ncarefully into place, and turned to Dorothy. In an instant they were in\r\neach other's arms. He felt her labored breathing and the wild beating of\r\nher heart, pressed so closely to his, and saw the fear of the unknown in\r\nthe violet depths of her eyes, but she looked at him unflinchingly.\r\n\r\n\"Dick, sweetheart, if this is good-bye....\"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted her with a kiss.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't good-bye yet, Dottie mine. This is merely a trial effort, to\r\nsee what we will have to do to get away. Next time will be the time to\r\nworry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not worried, really ... but in case ... you see ... I ... we ...\"\r\n\r\nThe gray eyes softened and misted over as he pressed his cheek to hers.\r\n\r\n\"I understand, sweetheart,\" he whispered. \"This is not good-bye, but if\r\nwe don't pull through we'll go together, and that is what we both want.\"\r\n\r\nAs Crane and DuQuesne finished their tasks, Seaton fitted his\r\nsweetheart's helmet, placed her tenderly upon the seat, buckled the\r\nheavy restraining straps about her slender body, and donned his own\r\nhelmet. He took his place at the main instrument board, DuQuesne\r\nstationing himself at the other.\r\n\r\n\"What did you read on it, Blackie?\" asked Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"Two degrees, one minute, twelve seconds diameter,\" replied DuQuesne.\r\n\"Altogether too close for comfort. How shall we apply the power? One of\r\nus must stay awake, or we'll go on as long as the bars last.\"\r\n\r\n\"You put on one notch, then I'll put on one. We can feel the bus jump\r\nwith each notch. We'll keep it up until one of us is so far gone that he\r\ncan't raise the bar--the one that raises last will have to let the ship\r\nrun for thirty minutes or an hour, then cut down his power. Then the\r\nother fellow will revive and cut his off, for an observation. How's\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey took their places, and Seaton felt the vessel slow down in its\r\nhorrible fall as DuQuesne threw his lever into the first notch. He\r\nresponded instantly by advancing his own, and notch after notch the\r\npower applied to the ship by the now doubled motor was rapidly\r\nincreased. The passengers felt their suits envelope them and began to\r\nlabor for breath. Seaton slowly turned the mixing valve, a little with\r\neach advance of his lever, until pure oxygen flowed through the pipes.\r\nThe power levers had moved scarcely half of their range, yet minutes now\r\nintervened between each advance instead of seconds, as at the start.\r\n\r\nAs each of the two men was determined that he would make the last\r\nadvance, the duel continued longer than either would have thought\r\npossible. Seaton made what he thought his final effort and waited--only\r\nto feel, after a few minutes, the upward surge telling him that DuQuesne\r\nwas still able to move his lever. His brain reeled. His arm seemed\r\nparalyzed by its own enormous weight, and felt as though it, the rolling\r\ntable upon which it rested, and the supporting framework were so\r\nimmovably welded together that it was impossible to move it even the\r\nquarter-inch necessary to operate the ratchet-lever. He could not move\r\nhis body, which was oppressed by a sickening weight. His utmost efforts\r\nto breathe forced only a little of the life-giving oxygen into his\r\nlungs, which smarted painfully at the touch of the undiluted gas, and he\r\nfelt that he could not long retain consciousness under such conditions.\r\nNevertheless, he summoned all his strength and advanced the lever one\r\nmore notch. He stared at the clock-face above his head, knowing that if\r\nDuQuesne could advance his lever again he would lose consciousness and\r\nbe beaten. Minute after minute went by, however, and the acceleration of\r\nthe ship remained constant. Seaton, knowing that he was in sole control\r\nof the power-plant, fought to retain possession of his faculties, while\r\nthe hands of the clock told off the interminable minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter an eternity of time an hour had passed, and Seaton attempted to\r\ncut down his power, only to find with horror that the long strain had so\r\nweakened him that he could not reverse the ratchet. He was still able,\r\nhowever, to give the lever the backward jerk which disconnected the\r\nwires completely--and the safety straps creaked with the sudden stress\r\nas, half the power instantly shut off, the suddenly released springs\r\ntried to hurl five bodies against the ceiling. After a few minutes\r\nDuQuesne revived and slowly cut off his power. To the dismay of both men\r\nthey were again falling!\r\n\r\nDuQuesne hurried to the lower window to make the observation, remarking:\r\n\r\n\"You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only because you're so badly bunged up. One more notch would've got my\r\ngoat,\" replied Seaton frankly as he made his way to Dorothy's side. He\r\nnoticed as he reached her, that Crane had removed his helmet and was\r\napproaching the other girl. By the time DuQuesne had finished the\r\nobservation, the other passengers had completely recovered, apparently\r\nnone the worse for their experience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Did we gain anything?\" asked Seaton eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I make it two, four, thirteen. We've lost about two minutes of arc. How\r\nmuch power did we have on?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little over half--thirty-two points out of sixty possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were still falling pretty fast. We'll have to put on everything\r\nwe've got. Since neither of us can put it on we'll have to rig up an\r\nautomatic feed. It'll take time, but it's the only way.\"\r\n\r\n\"The automatic control is already there,\" put in Crane, forestalling\r\nSeaton's explanation. \"The only question is whether we will live through\r\nit--and that is not really a question, since certain death is the only\r\nalternative. We must do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We sure must,\" answered Seaton soberly.\r\n\r\nDorothy gravely nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\"What do you fellows think of a little plus pressure on the oxygen?\"\r\nasked Seaton. \"I think it would help a lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" said DuQuesne, and Crane added:\r\n\r\n\"Four or five inches of water will be about all the pressure we can\r\nstand. Any more might burn our lungs too badly.\"\r\n\r\nThe pressure apparatus was quickly arranged and the motors filled to\r\ncapacity with reserve bars--enough to last seventy-two hours--the\r\nscientists having decided that they must risk everything on one trial\r\nand put in enough, if possible, to pull them clear out of the influence\r\nof this center of attraction, as the time lost in slowing up to change\r\nbars might well mean the difference between success and failure. Where\r\nthey might lie at the end of the wild dash for safety, how they were to\r\nretrace their way with their depleted supply of copper, what other\r\ndangers of dead star, planet, or sun lay in their path--all these were\r\nterrifying questions that had to be ignored.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuQuesne was the only member of the party who actually felt any\r\ncalmness, the quiet of the others expressing their courage in facing\r\nfear. Life seemed very sweet and desirable to them, the distant earth a\r\nvery Paradise! Through Dorothy's mind flashed the visions she had built\r\nup during long sweet hours, visions of a long life with Seaton. As she\r\nbreathed an inaudible prayer, she glanced up and saw Seaton standing\r\nbeside her, gazing down upon her with his very soul in his eyes. Never\r\nwould she forget the expression upon his face. Even in that crucial\r\nhour, his great love for her overshadowed every other feeling, and no\r\nthought of self was in his mind--his care was all for her. There was a\r\nlong farewell caress. Both knew that it might be goodbye, but both were\r\nsilent as the violet eyes and the gray looked into each other's depths\r\nand conveyed messages far beyond the power of words. Once more he\r\nadjusted her helmet and strapped her into place.\r\n\r\nAs Crane had in the meantime cared for the other girl, the men again\r\ntook their places and Seaton started the motor which would automatically\r\nadvance the speed levers, one notch every five seconds, until the full\r\npower of both motors was exerted. As the power was increased, he turned\r\nthe valve as before, until the helmets were filled with pure oxygen\r\nunder a pressure of five inches of water.\r\n\r\nMargaret Spencer, weakened by her imprisonment, was the first to lose\r\nconsciousness, and soon afterward Dorothy felt her senses leave her. A\r\nhalf-minute, in the course of which six mighty surges were felt, as more\r\nof the power of the doubled motor was released, and Crane had gone,\r\ncalmly analyzing his sensations to the last. After a time DuQuesne also\r\nlapsed into unconsciousness, making no particular effort to avoid it, as\r\nhe knew that the involuntary muscles would function quite as well\r\nwithout the direction of the will. Seaton, although he knew it was\r\nuseless, fought to keep his senses as long as possible, counting the\r\nimpulses he felt as the levers were advanced.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-two.\" He felt exactly as he had before, when he had advanced the\r\nlever for the last time.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-three.\" A giant hand shut off his breath completely, though he\r\nwas fighting to his utmost for air. An intolerable weight rested upon\r\nhis eyeballs, forcing them backward into his head. The universe whirled\r\nabout him in dizzy circles--orange and black and green stars flashed\r\nbefore his bursting eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-four.\" The stars became more brilliant and of more variegated\r\ncolors, and a giant pen dipped in fire was writing equations and\r\nmathematico-chemical symbols upon his quivering brain. He joined the\r\ncircling universe, which he had hitherto kept away from him by main\r\nstrength, and whirled about his own body, tracing a logarithmic spiral\r\nwith infinite velocity--leaving his body an infinite distance behind.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-five.\" The stars and the fiery pen exploded in a wild\r\ncoruscation of searing, blinding light and he plunged from his spiral\r\ninto a black abyss.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn spite of the terrific stress put upon the machine, every part\r\nfunctioned perfectly, and soon after Seaton had lost consciousness the\r\nvessel began to draw away from the sinister globe; slowly at first,\r\nfaster and faster as more and more of the almost unlimited power of the\r\nmighty motor was released. Soon the levers were out to the last notch\r\nand the machine was exerting its maximum effort. One hour and an\r\nobserver upon the Skylark would have seen that the apparent size of the\r\nmassive unknown world was rapidly decreasing; twenty hours and it was so\r\nfar away as to be invisible, though its effect was still great; forty\r\nhours and the effect was slight; sixty hours and the Skylark was out of\r\nrange of the slightest measurable force of the monster it had left.\r\n\r\nHurtled onward by the inconceivable power of the unleashed copper demon\r\nin its center, the Skylark flew through the infinite reaches of\r\ninterstellar space with an unthinkable, almost incalculable\r\nvelocity--beside which the velocity of light was as that of a snail to\r\nthat of a rifle bullet; a velocity augmented every second by a quantity\r\nalmost double that of light itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThrough Space Into the Carboniferous\r\n\r\n\r\nSeaton opened his eyes and gazed about him wonderingly. Only half\r\nconscious, bruised and sore in every part of his body, he could not at\r\nfirst realize what had happened. Instinctively drawing a deep breath, he\r\ncoughed and choked as the undiluted oxygen filled his lungs, bringing\r\nwith it a complete understanding of the situation. Knowing from the lack\r\nof any apparent motion that the power had been sufficient to pull the\r\ncar away from that fatal globe, his first thought was for Dorothy, and\r\nhe tore off his helmet and turned toward her. The force of even that\r\nslight movement, wafted him gently into the air where he hung suspended\r\nseveral minutes before his struggles enabled him to clutch a post and\r\ndraw himself down to the floor. A quick glance around informed him that\r\nDorothy, as well as the others, was still unconscious. Making his way\r\nrapidly to her, he placed her face downward upon the floor and began\r\nartificial respiration. Very soon he was rewarded by the coughing he had\r\nlonged to hear. He tore off her helmet and clasped her to his breast in\r\nan agony of relief, while she sobbed convulsively upon his shoulder. The\r\nfirst ecstasy of their greeting over, Dorothy started guiltily.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dick!\" she exclaimed. \"How about Peggy? You must see how she is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" answered Crane's voice cheerily. \"She is coming to\r\nnicely.\"\r\n\r\nGlancing around quickly, they saw that Crane had already revived the\r\nstranger, and that DuQuesne was not in sight. Dorothy blushed, the vivid\r\nwave of color rising to her glorious hair, and hastily disengaged her\r\narms from around her lover's neck, drawing away from him. Seaton, also\r\nblushing, dropped his arms, and Dorothy floated away from him,\r\nfrantically clutching at a brace just beyond reach.\r\n\r\n\"Pull me down, Dick!\" she called, laughing gaily.\r\n\r\nSeaton, seizing her instinctively, neglected his own anchorage and they\r\nhung in the air together, while Crane and Margaret, each holding a\r\nstrap, laughed with unrestrained merriment.\r\n\r\n\"Tweet, tweet--I'm a canary!\" chuckled Seaton. \"Throw us a rope!\"\r\n\r\n\"A Dicky-bird, you mean,\" interposed Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that you were a sleight-of-hand expert, Dick, but I did not know\r\nthat levitation was one of your specialties,\" remarked Crane with mock\r\ngravity. \"That is a peculiar pose you are holding now. What are you\r\ndoing--sitting on an imaginary pedestal?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be sitting on your neck if you don't get a wiggle on with that\r\nrope!\" retorted Seaton, but before Crane had time to obey the command\r\nthe floating couple had approached close enough to the ceiling so that\r\nSeaton, with a slight pressure of his hand against the leather, sent\r\nthem floating back to the floor, within reach of one of the handrails.\r\n\r\nSeaton made his way to the power-plant, lifted in one of the remaining\r\nbars, and applied a little power. The Skylark seemed to jump under them,\r\nthen it seemed as though they were back on Earth--everything had its\r\nnormal weight once more, as the amount of power applied was just enough\r\nto equal the acceleration of gravity. After this fact had been\r\nexplained, Dorothy turned to Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"Now that we are able to act intelligently, the party should be\r\nintroduced to each other. Peggy, this is Dr. Dick Seaton, and this is\r\nMr. Martin Crane. Boys, this is Miss Margaret Spencer, a dear friend of\r\nmine. These are the boys I have told you so much about, Peggy. Dick\r\nknows all about atoms and things; he found out how to make the Skylark\r\ngo. Martin, who is quite a wonderful inventor, made the engines and\r\nthings for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may have heard of Mr. Crane,\" replied Margaret eagerly. \"My father\r\nwas an inventor, and I have heard him speak of a man named Crane who\r\ninvented a lot of instruments for airplanes. He used to say that the\r\nCrane instruments revolutionized flying. I wonder if you are that Mr.\r\nCrane?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is rather unjustifiably high praise, Miss Spencer,\" replied Crane,\r\n\"but as I have been guilty of one or two things along that line, I may\r\nbe the man he meant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me if I seem to change the subject,\" put in Seaton, \"but where's\r\nDuQuesne?\"\r\n\r\n\"We came to at the same time, and he went into the galley to fix up\r\nsomething to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for him!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I'm simply starved to death. I would\r\nhave been demanding food long ago, but I have so many aches and pains\r\nthat I didn't realize how hungry I was until you mentioned it. Come on,\r\nPeggy, I know where our room is. Let's go powder our noses while these\r\nbewhiskered gentlemen reap their beards. Did you bring along any of my\r\nclothes, Dick, or did you forget them in the excitement?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think anything about clothes, but Martin did. You'll find your\r\nwhole wardrobe in your room. I'm with you, Dot, on that eating\r\nproposition--I'm hungry enough to eat the jamb off the door!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the girls had gone, Seaton and Crane went to their rooms, where\r\nthey exercised vigorously to restore the circulation to their numbed\r\nbodies, shaved, bathed, and returned to the saloon feeling like new men.\r\nThey found the girls already there, seated at one of the windows.\r\n\r\n\"Hail and greeting!\" cried Dorothy at sight of them. \"I hardly\r\nrecognized you without your whiskers. Do hurry over here and look out\r\nthis perfectly wonderful window. Did you ever in your born days see\r\nanything like this sight? Now that I'm not scared pea-green, I can enjoy\r\nit thoroughly!\"\r\n\r\nThe two men joined the girls and peered out into space through the\r\nwindow, which was completely invisible, so clear was the glass. As the\r\nfour heads bent, so close together, an awed silence fell upon the little\r\ngroup. For the blackness of the interstellar void was not the dark of an\r\nearthly night, but the absolute black of the absence of all light,\r\nbeside which the black of platinum dust is pale and gray; and laid upon\r\nthis velvet were the jewel stars. They were not the twinkling,\r\nscintillating beauties of the earthly sky, but minute points, so small\r\nas to seem dimensionless, yet of dazzling brilliance. Without the\r\ninterference of the air, their rays met the eye steadily and much of the\r\neffect of comparative distance was lost. All seemed nearer and there was\r\nno hint of familiarity in their arrangement. Like gems thrown upon\r\ndarkness they shone in multi-colored beauty upon the daring wanderers,\r\nwho stood in their car as easily as though they were upon their parent\r\nEarth, and gazed upon a sight never before seen by eye of man nor\r\npictured in his imaginings.\r\n\r\nThrough the daze of their wonder, a thought smote Seaton like a blow\r\nfrom a fist. His eyes leaped to the instrument board and he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Look there, Mart! We're heading almost directly away from the Earth,\r\nand we must be making billions of miles per second. After we lost\r\nconsciousness, the attraction of that big dud back there would swing us\r\naround, of course, but the bar should have stayed pointed somewhere near\r\nthe Earth, as I left it. Do you suppose it could have shifted the\r\ngyroscopes?\"\r\n\r\n\"It not only could have, it did,\" replied Crane, turning the bar until\r\nit again pointed parallel with the object-compass which bore upon the\r\nEarth. \"Look at the board. The angle has been changed through nearly\r\nhalf a circumference. We couldn't carry gyroscopes heavy enough to\r\ncounteract that force.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they were heavier there--Oh, sure, you're right. It's mass, not\r\nweight, that counts. But we sure are in one fine, large jam now. Instead\r\nof being half-way back to the Earth we're--where are we, anyway?\"\r\n\r\nThey made a reading on an object-compass focused upon the Earth.\r\nSeaton's face lengthened as seconds passed. When it had come to rest,\r\nboth men calculated the distance.\r\n\r\n\"What d'you make it, Mart? I'm afraid to tell you my result.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-six point twenty-seven light-centuries,\" replied Crane, calmly.\r\n\"Right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, and the time was 11:32 P. M. of Thursday, by the chronometer\r\nthere. We'll time it again after a while and see how fast we're\r\ntraveling. It's a good thing you built the ship's chronometers to stand\r\nany kind of stress. My watch is a total loss. Yours is, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"All of our watches must be broken. We will have to repair them as soon\r\nas we get time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's eat next! No human being can stand my aching void much\r\nlonger. How about you, Dot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for Cat's sake, let's get busy!\" she mimicked him gaily. \"Doctor\r\nDuQuesne's had dinner ready for ages, and we're all dying by inches of\r\nhunger.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wanderers, battered, bruised, and sore, seated themselves at a\r\nfolding table, Seaton keeping a watchful eye upon the bar and upon the\r\ncourse, while enjoying Dorothy's presence to the full. Crane and\r\nMargaret talked easily, but at intervals. Save when directly addressed.\r\nDuQuesne maintained silence--not the silence of one who knows himself to\r\nbe an intruder, but the silence of perfect self-sufficiency. The meal\r\nover, the girls washed the dishes and busied themselves in the galley.\r\nSeaton and Crane made another observation upon the Earth, requesting\r\nDuQuesne to stay out of the \"engine room\" as they called the\r\npartially-enclosed space surrounding the main instrument board, where\r\nwere located the object-compasses and the mechanism controlling the\r\nattractor, about which DuQuesne knew nothing. As they rejoined DuQuesne\r\nin the main compartment, Seaton said:\r\n\r\n\"DuQuesne, we're nearly five thousand light-years away from the Earth,\r\nand are getting farther at the rate of about one light-year per minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that it would be poor technique to ask how you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would--very poor. Our figures are right. The difficulty is that we\r\nhave only four bars left--enough to stop us and a little to spare, but\r\nnot nearly enough to get back with, even if we could take a chance on\r\ndrifting straight that far without being swung off--which, of course, is\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means that we must land somewhere and dig some copper, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing to do is to find a place to land.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton picked out a distant star in their course and observed it through\r\nthe spectroscope. Since it was found to contain copper in notable\r\namounts, all agreed that its planets probably also contained copper.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know whether we can stop that soon or not,\" remarked Seaton as he\r\nset the levers, \"but we may as well have something to shoot at. We'd\r\nbetter take our regular twelve-hour tricks, hadn't we, Mart? It's a\r\nwonder we got as far as this without striking another snag. I'll take\r\nthe first trick at the board--beat it to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast, Dick,\" argued Crane, as Seaton turned toward the\r\nengine-room: \"It's my turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flip a nickel,\" suggested Seaton. \"Heads I get it.\"\r\n\r\nCrane flipped a coin. Heads it was, and the worn-out party went to their\r\nrooms, all save Dorothy, who lingered after the others to bid her lover\r\na more intimate good-night.\r\n\r\nSeated beside him, his arm around her and her head upon his shoulder,\r\nDorothy exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dicky, Dicky, it is wonderful to be with you again! I've lived as\r\nmany years in the last week as we have covered miles!\"\r\n\r\nSeaton kissed her with ardor, then turned her fair face up to his and\r\ngazed hungrily at every feature.\r\n\r\n\"It sure was awful until we found you, sweetheart girl. Those two days\r\nat Wilson's were the worst and longest I ever put in. I could have wrung\r\nMartin's cautious old neck!\r\n\r\n\"But isn't he a wiz at preparing for trouble? We sure owe him a lot,\r\nlittle dimpled lady.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy was silent for a moment, then a smile quirked at one corner of\r\nher mouth and a dimple appeared. Seaton promptly kissed it, whereupon it\r\ndeepened audaciously.\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking about--mischief?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Only of how Martin is going to be paid what we owe him,\" she answered\r\nteasingly. \"Don't let the debt worry you any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spill the news, Reddy,\" he commanded, as his arm tightened about her.\r\n\r\nShe stuck out a tiny tip of red tongue at him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let Peggy find out he's a millionaire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he asked wonderingly, then he saw her point and laughed:\r\n\r\n\"You little matchmaker!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care, laugh if you want to. Martin's as nice a man as I know,\r\nand Peggy's a real darling. Don't you let slip a word about Martin's\r\nmoney, that's all!\"\r\n\r\n\"She wouldn't think any less of him, would she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick, sometimes you are absolutely dumb. It would spoil everything. If\r\nshe knew he was a millionaire she would be scared to death--not of him,\r\nof course, but because she would think that he would think that she was\r\nchasing him, and then of course he would think that she was, see? As it\r\nis, she acts perfectly natural, and so does he. Didn't you notice that\r\nwhile we were eating they talked together for at least fifteen minutes\r\nabout her father's invention and the way they stole the plans and one\r\nthing and another? I don't believe he has talked that much to any girl\r\nexcept me the last five years--and he wouldn't talk to me until he knew\r\nthat I couldn't see any man except you. Much as we like Martin, we've\r\ngot to admit that about him. He's been chased so much that he's wild. If\r\nany other girl he knows had talked to him that long, he would have been\r\noff to the North Pole or somewhere the next morning, and the best part\r\nof it is that he didn't think anything of it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You think she is domesticating the wild man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Dick, don't be foolish. You know what I mean. Martin is a perfect\r\ndear, but if she knew that he is _the_ M. Reynolds Crane, everything\r\nwould be ruined. You know yourself how horribly hard it is to get\r\nthrough his shell to the real Martin underneath. He is lonely and\r\nmiserable inside, I know, and the right kind of girl, one that would\r\ntreat him right, would make life Heaven for him, and herself too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the wrong kind would make it....\"\r\n\r\n\"She would,\" interrupted Dorothy hastily, \"but Peggy's the right kind.\r\nWouldn't it be fine to have Martin and Peggy as happy, almost, as you\r\nand I are?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, girlie, I'm with you,\" he answered, embracing her as though\r\nhe intended never to let her go, \"but you'd better go get some\r\nsleep--you're all in.\"\r\n\r\nConsiderably later, when Dorothy had finally gone, Seaton settled\r\nhimself for the long vigil. Promptly at the end of the twelve hours\r\nCrane appeared, alert of eye and of bearing.\r\n\r\n\"You look fresh as a daisy, Mart. Feeling fit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fit as the proverbial fiddle. I could not have slept any better or\r\nlonger if I had had a week off. Seven hours and a half is a luxury, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"All wrong, old top. I need eight every night, and I'm going to take\r\nabout ten this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to it, twelve if you like. You have earned it.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton stumbled to his room and slept as though in a trance for ten\r\nhours. Rising, he took his regular morning exercises and went into the\r\nsaloon. All save Martin were there, but he had eyes only for his\r\nsweetheart, who was radiantly beautiful in a dress of deep bronze-brown.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Dick,\" she hailed him joyously. \"You woke up just in\r\ntime--we are all starving again, and were just going to eat without\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, everybody. I would like to eat with you, Dottie, but I've\r\ngot to relieve Martin. How'd it be for you to bring breakfast into the\r\nengine room and cheer my solitude, and let Crane eat with the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine--that's once you had a good idea, if you never have another!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the meal DuQuesne, who abhorred idleness with all his vigorous\r\nnature, took the watches of the party and went upstairs to the \"shop,\"\r\nwhich was a completely-equipped mechanical laboratory, to repair them.\r\nSeaton stayed at the board, where Dorothy joined him as a matter of\r\ncourse. Crane and Margaret sat down at one of the windows.\r\n\r\nShe told him her story, frankly and fully, shuddering with horror as she\r\nrecalled the awful, helpless fall, during which Perkins had met his end.\r\n\r\n\"Dick and I have a heavy score to settle with that Steel crowd and with\r\nDuQuesne,\" Crane said slowly. \"We have no evidence that will hold in\r\nlaw, but some day DuQuesne will over-reach himself. We could convict him\r\nof abduction now, but the penalty for that is too mild for what he has\r\ndone. Perkins' death was not murder, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, it was purely self-defense. Perkins would have killed him if he\r\ncould. And he really deserved it--Perkins was a perfect fiend. The\r\nDoctor, as they call him, is no better, although entirely different. He\r\nis so utterly heartless and ruthless, so cold and scientific. Do you\r\nknow him very well?\"\r\n\r\n\"We know all that about him, and more. And yet Dorothy said he saved her\r\nlife?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, from Perkins, but I still think it was because he didn't want\r\nPerkins meddling in his affairs. He seems to me to be the very\r\nincarnation of a fixed purpose--to advance himself in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"That expresses my thoughts exactly. But he slips occasionally, as in\r\nthis instance, and he will again. He will have to walk very carefully\r\nwhile he is with us. Nothing would please Dick better than an excuse for\r\nkilling him, and I must admit that I feel very much the same way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all of us do, and the way he acts proves what a machine he is. He\r\nknows just exactly how far to go, and never goes beyond it.\"\r\n\r\nThey felt the Skylark lurch slightly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mart!\" called Seaton. \"Going to pass that star we were headed\r\nfor--too fast to stop. I'm giving it a wide berth and picking out\r\nanother one. There's a big planet a few million miles off in line with\r\nthe main door, and another one almost dead ahead--that is, straight\r\ndown. We sure are traveling. Look at that sun flit by!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey saw the two planets, one like a small moon, the other like a large\r\nstar, and saw the strange sun increase rapidly in size as the Skylark\r\nflew on at such a pace that any earthly distance would have been covered\r\nas soon as it was begun. So appalling was their velocity that their ship\r\nwas bathed in the light of that sun for only a short time, then was\r\nagain surrounded by the indescribable darkness. Their seventy-two-hour\r\nflight without a pilot had seemed a miracle, now it seemed entirely\r\npossible that they might fly in a straight line for weeks without\r\nencountering any obstacle, so vast was the emptiness in comparison with\r\nthe points of light that punctuated it. Now and then they passed so\r\nclose to a star that it apparently moved rapidly, but for the most part\r\nthe silent sentinels stood, like distant mountain peaks to the travelers\r\nin an express train, in the same position for many minutes.\r\n\r\nAwed by the immensity of the universe, the two at the window were\r\nsilent, not with the silence of embarrassment, but with that of two\r\nfriends in the presence of something beyond the reach of words. As they\r\nstared out into the infinity each felt as never before the pitiful\r\nsmallness of even our whole solar system and the utter insignificance of\r\nhuman beings and their works. Silently their minds reached out to each\r\nother in mutual understanding.\r\n\r\nUnconsciously Margaret half shuddered and moved closer to her\r\ncompanion, the movement attracting his attention but not her own. A\r\ntender expression came into Crane's steady blue eyes as he looked down\r\nat the beautiful young woman by his side. For beautiful she undoubtedly\r\nwas. Untroubled rest and plentiful food had erased the marks of her\r\nimprisonment; Dorothy's deep, manifestly unassumed faith in the ability\r\nof Seaton and Crane to bring them safely back to Earth had quieted her\r\nfears; and a complete costume of Dorothy's simple but well-cut clothes,\r\nwhich fitted her perfectly, and in which she looked her best and knew\r\nit, had completely restored her self-possession. He quickly glanced away\r\nand again gazed at the stars, but now, in addition to the wonders of\r\nspace, he saw masses of wavy black hair, high-piled upon a queenly head;\r\ndeep down brown eyes half veiled by long, black lashes; sweet, sensitive\r\nlips; a firmly rounded but dimpled chin; and a perfectly-formed young\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she drew a deep, tremulous breath. As he turned, her eyes\r\nmet his. In their shadowy depths, still troubled by the mystery of the\r\nunknowable, he read her very soul--the soul of a real woman.\r\n\r\n\"I had hoped,\" said Margaret slowly, \"to take a long flight above the\r\nclouds, but anything like this never entered my mind. How unbelievably\r\ngreat it is! So much vaster than any perception we could get upon earth!\r\nIt seems strange that we were ever awed by the sea or the mountains ...\r\nand yet....\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, with her lip caught under two white teeth, then went on\r\nhesitatingly:\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't it seem to you, Mr. Crane, that there is something in man as\r\ngreat as all this? Otherwise, Dorothy and I could not be sailing here in\r\na wonder like the Lark, which you and Dick Seaton have made.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince from the first, Dorothy had timed her waking hours with those of\r\nSeaton--waiting upon him, preparing his meals, and lightening the long\r\nhours of his vigils at the board--Margaret took it upon herself to do\r\nthe same thing for Crane. But often they assembled in the engine-room,\r\nand there was much fun and laughter, as well as serious talk, among the\r\nfour. Margaret was quickly accepted as a friend, and proved a delightful\r\ncompanion. Her wavy, jet-black hair, the only color in the world that\r\ncould hold its own with Dorothy's auburn glory, framed features\r\nself-reliant and strong, yet of womanly softness; and in this genial\r\natmosphere her quick tongue had a delicate wit and a facility of\r\nexpression that delighted all three. Dorothy, after the manner of\r\nSouthern women, became the hostess of this odd \"party,\" as she styled\r\nit, and unconsciously adopted the attitude of a lady in her own home.\r\n\r\nEarly in their flight, Crane suggested that they should take notes upon\r\nthe systems of stars through which were passing.\r\n\r\n\"I know very little of astronomy,\" he said to Seaton, \"but with our\r\ntelescope, spectroscope, and other instruments, we should be able to\r\ntake some data that will be of interest to astronomers. Possibly Miss\r\nSpencer would be willing to help us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Seaton returned readily. \"We'd be idiots to let a chance like\r\nthis slide. Go to it!\"\r\n\r\nMargaret was delighted at the opportunity to help.\r\n\r\n\"Taking notes is the best thing I do!\" she cried, and called for a pad\r\nand pencil.\r\n\r\nStationed at the window, they fell to work in earnest. For several hours\r\nCrane took observations, calculated distances, and dictated notes to\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\n\"The stars are wonderfully different!\" she exclaimed to him once. \"That\r\nplanet, I'm sure, has strange and lovely life upon it. See how its color\r\ndiffers from most of the others we have seen so near? It is rosy and\r\nsoft like a home fire. I'm sure its people are happy.\"\r\n\r\nThey fell into a long discussion, laughing a little at their fancies.\r\nWere these multitudes of worlds peopled as the Earth? Could it be that\r\nonly upon Earth had occurred the right combination for the generation of\r\nlife, so that the rest of the Universe was unpeopled?\r\n\r\n\"It is unthinkable that they are all uninhabited,\" mused Crane. \"There\r\nmust be life. The beings may not exist in any form with which we are\r\nfamiliar--they may well be fulfilling some purpose in ways so different\r\nfrom ours that we should be unable to understand them at all.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret's eyes widened in startled apprehension, but in a moment she\r\nshook herself and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"But there's no reason to suppose they would be awful,\" she remarked,\r\nand turned with renewed interest to the window.\r\n\r\nThus days went by and the Skylark passed one solar system after another,\r\nwith a velocity so great that it was impossible to land upon any planet.\r\nMargaret's association with Crane, begun as a duty, soon became an\r\nintense pleasure for them both. Taking notes or seated at the board in\r\ncompanionable conversation or sympathetic silence, they compressed into\r\na few days more real companionship than is ordinarily enjoyed in months.\r\nOftener and oftener, as time went on, Crane found the vision of his\r\ndream home floating in his mind as he steered the Skylark in her\r\nmeteoric flight or as he strapped himself into his narrow bed. Now,\r\nhowever, the central figure of the vision, instead of being an\r\nindistinct blur, was clear and sharply defined. And for her part, more\r\nand more was Margaret drawn to the quiet and unassuming, but utterly\r\ndependable and steadfast young inventor, with his wide knowledge and his\r\nkeen, incisive mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSometimes, when far from any star, the pilot would desert his post and\r\njoin the others at meals. Upon one such occasion Seaton asked:\r\n\r\n\"How's the book on astronomy, oh, learned ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be as interesting as Egyptian hieroglyphics,\" Margaret replied,\r\nas she opened her notebook and showed him pages of figures and symbols.\r\n\r\n\"May I see it, Miss Spencer?\" asked DuQuesne from across the small\r\ntable, extending his hand.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, hot hostility in her brown eyes, and he dropped his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said, with amused irony.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal Seaton and Crane held a short consultation, and the\r\nformer called to the girls, asking them to join in the \"council of war.\"\r\nThere was a moment's silence before Crane said diffidently:\r\n\r\n\"We have been talking about DuQuesne, Miss Spencer, trying to decide a\r\nvery important problem.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton smiled in spite of himself as the color again deepened in\r\nMargaret's face, and Dorothy laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\"Talk about a red-headed temper! Your hair must be dyed, Peggy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know I acted like a naughty child,\" Margaret said ruefully, \"but he\r\nmakes me perfectly furious and scares me at the same time. A few more\r\nremarks like that 'I beg your pardon' of his and I wouldn't have a\r\nthought left in my head!\"\r\n\r\nSeaton, who had opened his mouth, shut it again ludicrously, without\r\nsaying a word, and Margaret gave him a startled glance.\r\n\r\n\"Now I _have_ said it!\" she exclaimed. \"I'm not afraid of him, boys,\r\nreally. What do you want me to do?\"\r\n\r\nSeaton plunged in.\r\n\r\n\"What we were trying to get up nerve enough to say is that he'd be a\r\ngood man on the astronomy job,\" and Crane added quickly:\r\n\r\n\"He undoubtedly knows more about it than I do, and it would be a pity to\r\nlose the chance of using him. Besides, Dick and I think it rather\r\ndangerous to leave him so much time to himself, in which to work up a\r\nplan against us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's cooking one right now, I'll bet a hat,\" Seaton put in, and Crane\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"If you are sure that you have no objections, Miss Spencer, we might go\r\nbelow, where we can have it dark, and all three of us see what we can\r\nmake of the stargazing. We are really losing an unusual opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret hid gallantly any reluctance she might have felt.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't deserve to be here if I can't work with the Doctor and hate\r\nhim at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you, Peg, you're a regular fellow!\" Seaton exclaimed. \"You're\r\na trump!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally, the enormous velocity of the cruiser was sufficiently reduced\r\nto effect a landing, a copper-bearing sun was located, and a course was\r\nlaid toward its nearest planet.\r\n\r\nAs the vessel approached its goal a deep undercurrent of excitement kept\r\nall the passengers feverishly occupied. They watched the distant globe\r\ngrow larger, glowing through its atmosphere more and more clearly as a\r\ngreat disk of white light, its outline softened by the air about it. Two\r\nsatellites were close beside it. Its sun, a great, blazing orb, a little\r\nnearer than the planet, looked so great and so hot that Margaret became\r\nuneasy.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it dangerous to get so close, Dick? We might burn up, mightn't\r\nwe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not without an atmosphere,\" he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" murmured the girl apologetically, \"I might have known that.\"\r\n\r\nDropping rapidly into the atmosphere of the planet, they measured its\r\ndensity and analyzed it in apparatus installed for that purpose, finding\r\nthat its composition was very similar to the Earth's air and that its\r\npressure was not enough greater to be uncomfortable. When within one\r\nthousand feet of the surface, Seaton weighed a five-pound weight upon a\r\nspring-balance, finding that it weighed five and a half pounds, thus\r\nascertaining that the planet was either somewhat larger than the Earth\r\nor more dense. The ground was almost hidden by a rank growth of\r\nvegetation, but here and there appeared glade-like openings.\r\n\r\nSeaton glanced at the faces about him. Tense interest marked them all.\r\nDorothy's cheeks were flushed, her eyes shone. She looked at him with\r\nawe and pride.\r\n\r\n\"A strange world, Dorothy,\" he said gravely. \"You are not afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not with you,\" she answered. \"I am only thrilled with wonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Columbus at San Salvador,\" said Margaret, her dark eyes paying their\r\ntribute of admiration.\r\n\r\nA dark flush mounted swiftly into Seaton's brown face and he sought to\r\nthrow most of the burden upon Crane, but catching upon his face also a\r\nlook of praise, almost of tenderness, he quickly turned to the controls.\r\n\r\n\"Man the boats!\" he ordered an imaginary crew, and the Skylark descended\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nLanding upon one of the open spaces, they found the ground solid and\r\nstepped out. What had appeared to be a glade was in reality a rock, or\r\nrather, a ledge of apparently solid metal, with scarcely a loose\r\nfragment to be seen. At one end of the ledge rose a giant tree\r\nwonderfully symmetrical, but of a peculiar form. Its branches were\r\nlonger at the top than at the bottom, and it possessed broad, dark-green\r\nleaves, long thorns, and odd, flexible, shoot-like tendrils. It stood as\r\nan outpost of the dense vegetation beyond. Totally unlike the forests of\r\nEarth were those fern-like trees, towering two hundred feet into the\r\nair. They were of an intensely vivid green and stood motionless in the\r\nstill, hot air of noonday. Not a sign of animal life was to be seen; the\r\nwhole landscape seemed asleep.\r\n\r\nThe five strangers stood near their vessel, conversing in low tones and\r\nenjoying the sensation of solid ground beneath their feet. After a few\r\nminutes DuQuesne remarked:\r\n\r\n\"This is undoubtedly a newer planet than ours. I should say that it was\r\nin the Carboniferous age. Aren't those trees like those in the\r\ncoal-measures, Seaton?\"\r\n\r\n\"True as time, Blackie--there probably won't be a human race here for\r\nages, unless we bring out some colonists.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton kicked at one of the loose lumps of metal questioningly with his\r\nheavy shoe, finding that it was as immovable as though it were part of\r\nthe ledge. Bending over, he found that it required all his great\r\nstrength to lift it and he stared at it with an expression of surprise,\r\nwhich turned to amazement as he peered closer.\r\n\r\n\"DuQuesne! Look at this!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuQuesne studied the metal, and was shaken out of his habitual\r\ntaciturnity.\r\n\r\n\"Platinum, by all the little gods!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll grab some of this while the grabbing's good,\" announced Seaton,\r\nand the few visible lumps were rolled into the car. \"If we had a pickaxe\r\nwe could chop some more off one of those sharp ledges down there.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's an axe in the shop,\" replied DuQuesne. \"I'll go get it. Go\r\nahead, I'll soon be with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep close together,\" warned Crane as the four moved slowly down the\r\nslope. \"This is none too safe, Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't, Mart. But we've got to see whether we can't find some\r\ncopper, and I would like to get some more of this stuff, too. I don't\r\nthink it's platinum, I believe that it's X.\"\r\n\r\nAs they reached the broken projections, Margaret glanced back over her\r\nshoulder and screamed. The others saw that her face was white and her\r\neyes wide with horror, and Seaton instinctively drew his pistol as he\r\nwhirled about, only to check his finger on the trigger and lower his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but X-plosive bullets,\" he growled in disgust, and in helpless\r\nsilence the four watched an unspeakably hideous monster slowly appear\r\nfrom behind the Skylark. Its four huge, squat legs supported a body at\r\nleast a hundred feet long, pursy and ungainly; at the extremity of a\r\nlong and sinuous neck a comparatively small head seemed composed\r\nentirely of a cavernous mouth armed with row upon row of carnivorous\r\nteeth. Dorothy gasped with terror and both girls shrank closer to the\r\ntwo men, who maintained a baffled silence as the huge beast passed his\r\nrevolting head along the hull of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\"I dare not shoot, Martin,\" Seaton whispered, \"it would wreck the bus.\r\nHave you got any solid bullets?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We must hide behind these small ledges until it goes away,\"\r\nanswered Crane, his eyes upon Margaret's colorless face. \"You two hide\r\nbehind that one, we will take this one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, it's nothing to worry about, anyway. We can kill him as soon\r\nas he gets far enough away from the boat,\" said Seaton as, with Dorothy\r\nclinging to him, he dropped behind one of the ledges. Margaret, her\r\nstaring eyes fixed upon the monster, remained standing until Crane\r\ntouched her gently and drew her down beside him.\r\n\r\n\"He will go away soon,\" his even voice assured her. \"We are in no\r\ndanger.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of their predicament, a feeling of happiness flowed through\r\nCrane's whole being as he crouched beside the wall of metal with one arm\r\nprotectingly around Margaret, and he longed to protect her through life\r\nas he was protecting her then. Accustomed as he was to dangerous\r\nsituations, he felt no fear. He felt only a great tenderness for the\r\ngirl by his side, who had ceased trembling but was still staring\r\nwide-eyed at the monster through a crevice.\r\n\r\n\"Scared, Peggy?\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Not now, Martin, but if you weren't here I would die of fright.\"\r\n\r\nAt this reply his arm tightened involuntarily, but he forced it to\r\nrelax.\r\n\r\n\"It will not be long,\" he promised himself silently, \"until she is back\r\nat home among her friends, and then....\"\r\n\r\nThere came the crack of a rifle from the Skylark. There was an awful\r\nroar from the dinosaur, which was quickly silenced by a stream of\r\nmachine-gun bullets.\r\n\r\n\"Blackie's on the job--let's go!\" cried Seaton, and they raced up the\r\nslope. Making a detour to avoid the writhing and mutilated mass they\r\nplunged through the opening door. DuQuesne shut it behind them and in\r\noverwhelming relief, the adventurers huddled together as from the\r\nwilderness without there arose an appalling tumult.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe scene, so quiet a few moments before, was instantly changed. The\r\ntrees, the swamp, and the air seemed filled with monsters so hideous as\r\nto stagger the imagination. Winged lizards of prodigious size hurtled\r\nthrough the air, plunging to death against the armored hull.\r\nIndescribable flying monsters, with feathers like birds, but with the\r\nfangs of tigers, attacked viciously. Dorothy screamed and started back\r\nas a scorpion-like thing with a body ten feet in length leaped at the\r\nwindow in front of her, its terrible sting spraying the glass with\r\nvenom. As it fell to the ground, a huge spider--if an eight-legged\r\ncreature with spines instead of hair, many-faceted eyes, and a bloated,\r\nglobular body weighing hundreds of pounds, may be called a\r\nspider--leaped upon it and, mighty mandibles against poisonous sting,\r\nthe furious battle raged. Several twelve-foot cockroaches climbed nimbly\r\nacross the fallen timber of the morass and began feeding voraciously\r\nupon the body of the dead dinosaur, only to be driven away by another\r\nanimal, which all three men recognized instantly as that king of all\r\nprehistoric creatures, the saber-toothed tiger. This newcomer, a tawny\r\nbeast towering fifteen feet high at the shoulder, had a mouth\r\ndisproportionate even to his great size--a mouth armed with four great\r\ntiger-teeth more than three feet in length. He had barely begun his\r\nmeal, however, when he was challenged by another nightmare, a something\r\napparently half-way between a dinosaur and a crocodile. At the first\r\nnote the tiger charged. Clawing, striking, rending each other with their\r\nterrible teeth, a veritable avalanche of bloodthirsty rage, the\r\ncombatants stormed up and down the little island. But the fighters were\r\nrudely interrupted, and the earthly visitors discovered that in this\r\nprimitive world it was not only animal life that was dangerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The great tree standing on the farther edge of the island\r\nsuddenly bent over, lashing out like a snake and grasping both. It\r\ntransfixed them with the terrible thorns, which were now seen to be\r\narmed with needlepoints and to possess barbs like fish-hooks.]\r\n\r\nThe great tree standing on the farther edge of the island suddenly bent\r\nover, lashing out like a snake and grasping both. It transfixed them\r\nwith the terrible thorns, which were now seen to be armed with\r\nneedlepoints and to possess barbs like fish-hooks. It ripped at them\r\nwith the long branches, which were veritable spears. The broad leaves,\r\narmed with revolting sucking disks, closed about the two animals, while\r\nthe long, slender twigs, each of which was now seen to have an eye at\r\nits extremity, waved about, watching each movement of the captives from\r\na safe distance.\r\n\r\nIf the struggle between the two animals had been awful, this was\r\nTitanic. The air was torn by the roars of the reptile, the screams of\r\nthe great cat, and the shrieks of the tree. The very ground rocked with\r\nthe ferocity of the conflict. There could be but one result--soon the\r\ntree, having absorbed the two gladiators, resumed its upright position\r\nin all its beauty.\r\n\r\nThe members of the little group stared at each other, sick at heart.\r\n\r\n\"This is NO place to start a copper-mine. I think we'd better beat it,\"\r\nremarked Seaton presently, wiping drops of perspiration from his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" acquiesced Crane. \"We found air and Earth-like conditions\r\nhere; we probably will elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right, Dottie?\" asked Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Dicky,\" she replied, the color flowing back into her cheeks.\r\n\"It scared me stiff, and I think I have a lot of white hairs right now,\r\nbut I wouldn't have missed it for anything.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused an instant, and continued:\r\n\r\n\"Dick, there must be a queer streak of brutality in me, but would you\r\nmind blowing up that frightful tree? I wouldn't mind its nature if it\r\nwere ugly--but look at it! It's so deceptively beautiful! You wouldn't\r\nthink it had the disposition of a fiend, would you?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA general laugh relieved the nervous tension, and Seaton stepped\r\nimpulsively toward DuQuesne with his hand outstretched.\r\n\r\n\"You've squared your account, Blackie. Say the word and the war's all\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nDuQuesne ignored the hand and glanced coldly at the group of eager,\r\nfriendly faces.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be sentimental,\" he remarked evenly as he turned away to his\r\nroom. \"Emotional scenes pain me. I gave my word to act as one of the\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, may I be kicked to death by little red spiders!\" exclaimed\r\nSeaton, dumbfounded, as the other disappeared. \"He ain't a man, he's a\r\nfish!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a machine. I always thought so, and now I know it,\" stated\r\nMargaret, and the others nodded agreement.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll sure pull his cork as soon as we get back!\" snapped Seaton.\r\n\"He asked for it, and we'll give him both barrels!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know I acted the fool out there,\" Margaret apologized, flushing hotly\r\nand looking at Crane. \"I don't know what made me act so stupid. I used\r\nto have a little nerve.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were a regular little brick, Peg,\" Seaton returned instantly. \"Both\r\nyou girls are all to the good--the right kind to have along in ticklish\r\nplaces.\"\r\n\r\nCrane held out his steady hand and took Margaret's in a warm clasp.\r\n\r\n\"For a girl in your weakened condition you were wonderful. You have no\r\nreason to reproach yourself.\"\r\n\r\nTears filled the dark eyes, but were held back bravely as she held her\r\nhead erect and returned the pressure of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Just so you don't leave me behind next time,\" she returned lightly, and\r\nthe last word concerning the incident had been said.\r\n\r\nSeaton applied the power and soon they were approaching another planet,\r\nwhich was surrounded by a dense fog. Descending slowly, they found it to\r\nbe a mass of boiling-hot steam and rank vapors, under enormous pressure.\r\n\r\nThe next planet they found to have a clear atmosphere, but the ground\r\nhad a peculiar, barren look; and analysis of the gaseous envelope proved\r\nit to be composed almost entirely of chlorin. No life of an earthly type\r\ncould be possible upon such a world, and a search for copper, even with\r\nthe suits and helmets, would probably be fruitless if not impossible.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Seaton as they were again in space, \"we've got enough\r\ncopper to visit several more worlds--several more solar systems, if\r\nnecessary. But there's a nice, hopeful-looking planet right in front of\r\nus. It may be the one we're looking for.\"\r\n\r\nArrived in the belt of atmosphere, they tested it as before, and found\r\nit satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Mastery of Mind Over Matter\r\n\r\n\r\nThey descended rapidly, directly over a large and imposing city in the\r\nmiddle of a vast, level, beautifully-planted plain. While they were\r\nwatching it, the city vanished and the plain was transformed into a\r\nheavily-timbered mountain summit, the valleys falling away upon all\r\nsides as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll say that's SOME mirage!\" exclaimed Seaton, rubbing his eyes\r\nin astonishment. \"I've seen mirages before, but never anything like\r\nthat. Wonder what this air's made of? But we'll land, anyway, if we\r\nfinally have to swim!\"\r\n\r\nThe ship landed gently upon the summit, the occupants half expecting to\r\nsee the ground disappear before their eyes. Nothing happened, however,\r\nand they disembarked, finding walking somewhat difficult because of the\r\ngreat mass of the planet. Looking around, they could see no sign of\r\nlife, but they _felt_ a presence near them--a vast, invisible something.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, out of the air in front of Seaton, a man materialized: a man\r\nidentical with him in every feature and detail, even to the smudge of\r\ngrease under one eye, the small wrinkles in his heavy blue serge suit,\r\nand the emblem of the American Chemical Society upon his watch-fob.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, folks,\" the stranger began in Seaton's characteristic careless\r\nspeech. \"I see you're surprised at my knowing your language. You're a\r\nvery inferior race of animals--don't even understand telepathy, don't\r\nunderstand the luminiferous ether, or the relation between time and\r\nspace. Your greatest things, such as the Skylark and your\r\nobject-compass, are merely toys.\"\r\n\r\nChanging instantly from Seaton's form to that of Dorothy, likewise a\r\nperfect imitation, the stranger continued without a break:\r\n\r\n\"Atoms and electrons and things, spinning and whirling in their dizzy\r\nlittle orbits....\" It broke off abruptly, continuing in the form of\r\nDuQuesne:\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't make myself clear as Miss Vaneman--not a scientific\r\nconvolution in her foolish little brain. You are a freer type, DuQuesne,\r\nunhampered by foolish, soft fancies. But you are very clumsy, although\r\nworking fairly well with your poor tools--Brookings and his\r\norganization, the Perkins Café and its clumsy wireless telephones. All\r\nof you are extremely low in the scale. Such animals have not been known\r\nin our universe for ten million years, which is as far back as I can\r\nremember. You have millions of years to go before you will amount to\r\nanything; before you will even rise above death and its attendant\r\nnecessity, sex.\"\r\n\r\nThe strange being then assumed form after form with bewildering\r\nrapidity, while the spectators stared in dumb astonishment. In rapid\r\nsuccession it took on the likeness of each member of the party, of the\r\nvessel itself, of the watch in Seaton's pocket--reappearing as Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"Well, bunch,\" it said in a matter-of-fact voice, \"there's no mental\r\nexercise in you and you're such a low form of life that you're of no use\r\non this planet; so I'll dematerialize you.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA peculiar light came into its eyes as they stared intently into\r\nSeaton's, and he felt his senses reel under the impact of an awful\r\nmental force, but he fought back with all his power and remained\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" the stranger demanded in surprise, \"This is the first\r\ntime in history that mere matter--which is only a manifestation of\r\nmind--has ever refused to obey mind. There's a screw loose somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must reason this out,\" it continued analytically, changing\r\ninstantaneously into Crane's likeness. \"Ah! I am not a perfect\r\nreproduction. This is the first matter I have ever encountered that I\r\ncould not reproduce perfectly. There is some subtle difference. The\r\nexternal form is the same, the organic structure likewise. The molecules\r\nof substance are arranged as they should be, as are also the atoms in\r\nthe molecule. The electrons in the atom--ah! There is the difficulty.\r\nThe arrangement and number of electrons, as well as positive charges,\r\nare entirely different from what I had supposed. I must derive the\r\nformula.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go, folks!\" said Seaton hastily, drawing Dorothy back toward the\r\nSkylark. \"This dematerialization stunt may be play for him, but I don't\r\nwant any of it in my family.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you really _must_ stay,\" remonstrated the stranger. \"Much as it is\r\nagainst my principles to employ brute force, you must stay and be\r\nproperly dematerialized, alive or dead. Science demands it.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he started to draw his automatic pistol. Being in Crane's\r\nform, he drew slowly, as Crane did; and Seaton, with the dexterity of\r\nmuch sleight-of-hand work and of years of familiarity with his weapon,\r\ndrew and fired in one incredibly rapid movement, before the other had\r\nwithdrawn the pistol from his pocket. The X-plosive shell completely\r\nvolatilized the stranger and hurled the party backward toward the\r\nSkylark, into which they fled hastily. As Crane, the last one to enter\r\nthe vessel, fired his pistol and closed the massive door, Seaton leaped\r\nto the levers. As he did so, he saw a creature materialize in the air of\r\nthe vessel and fall to the floor with a crash as he threw on the power.\r\nIt was a frightful thing, like nothing ever before seen upon any world;\r\nwith great teeth, long, sharp claws, and an automatic pistol clutched\r\nfirmly in a human hand. Forced flat by the terrific acceleration of the\r\nvessel, it was unable to lift either itself or the weapon, and lay\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\n\"We take one trick, anyway!\" blazed Seaton, as he threw on the power of\r\nthe attractor and diffused its force into a screen over the party, so\r\nthat the enemy could not materialize in the air above them and crush\r\nthem by mere weight. \"As pure mental force, you're entirely out of my\r\nclass, but when you come down to matter, which I can understand, I'll\r\ngive you a run for your money until my angles catch fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a childish defiance. It speaks well for your courage, but ill\r\nfor your intelligence,\" the animal said, and vanished.\r\n\r\nA moment later Seaton's hair almost stood on end as he saw an automatic\r\npistol appear upon the board directly in front of him, clamped to it by\r\nbands of steel. Paralyzed by this unlooked-for demonstration of the\r\nmastery of mind over matter, unable to move a muscle, he lay helpless,\r\nstaring at the engine of death in front of him. Although the whole\r\nproceeding occupied only a fraction of a second, it seemed to Seaton as\r\nthough he watched the weapon for hours. As the sleeve drew back, cocking\r\nthe pistol and throwing a cartridge into the chamber, the trigger moved,\r\nand the hammer descended to speed on its way the bullet which was to\r\nblot out his life. There was a sharp click as the hammer fell--Seaton\r\nwas surprised to find himself still alive until a voice spoke,\r\napparently from the muzzle of the pistol, with the harsh sound of a\r\nmetallic diaphragm.\r\n\r\n\"I was almost certain that it wouldn't explode,\" the stranger said,\r\nchattily. \"You see, I haven't derived that formula yet, so I couldn't\r\nmake a real explosive. I could of course, materialize beside you, under\r\nyour protective screen, and crush you in a vise. I could materialize as\r\na man of metal, able to stand up under this acceleration, and do you to\r\ndeath. I could even, by a sufficient expenditure of mental energy,\r\nmaterialize a planet around your ship and crush it. However, these crude\r\nmethods are distasteful in the extreme, especially since you have\r\nalready given me some slight and unexpected mental exercise. In return,\r\nI shall give you one chance for your lives. I cannot dematerialize\r\neither you or your vessel until I work out the formula for your peculiar\r\natomic structure. If I can derive the formula before you reach the\r\nboundaries of my home-space, beyond which I cannot go, I shall let you\r\ngo free. Deriving the formula will be a neat little problem. It should\r\nbe fairly easy, as it involves only a simple integration in ninety-seven\r\ndimensions.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSilence ensued, and Seaton advanced his lever to the limit of his\r\nability to retain consciousness. Almost overcome by the horror of their\r\nposition, in an agony of suspense, expecting every instant to be hurled\r\ninto nothingness, he battled on, with no thought of yielding, even in\r\nthe face of those overwhelming mental odds.\r\n\r\n\"You can't do it, old top,\" he thought savagely, concentrating all the\r\npower of his highly-trained mind against the intellectual monster. \"You\r\ncan't dematerialize us, and you can't integrate above ninety-five\r\ndimensions to save your neck. You can't do it--you're slipping--you're\r\nall balled up right now!\"\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour the silent battle raged, during which time the\r\nSkylark flew millions upon millions of miles toward Earth. Finally the\r\nstranger spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"You three win,\" it said abruptly. In answer to the unspoken surprise of\r\nall three men it went on: \"Yes, all three of you got the same idea and\r\nCrane even forced his body to retain consciousness to fight me. Your\r\nefforts were very feeble, of course, but were enough to interrupt my\r\ncalculations at a delicate stage, every time. You are a low form of\r\nlife, undoubtedly, but with more mentality than I supposed at first. I\r\ncould get that formula, of course, in spite of you, if I had time, but\r\nwe are rapidly approaching the limits of my territory, outside of which\r\neven I could not think my way back. That is one thing in which your\r\nmechanical devices are superior to anything my own race developed before\r\nwe became pure intellectuals. They point the way back to your Earth,\r\nwhich is so far away that even my mentality cannot grasp the meaning of\r\nthe distance. I can understand the Earth, can visualize it from your\r\nminds, but I cannot project myself any nearer to it than we are at\r\npresent. Before I leave you, I will say that you have conferred a real\r\nfavor upon me--you have given me something to think about for thousands\r\nof cycles to come. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nAssured that their visitor had really gone, Seaton reduced the power to\r\nthat of gravity and Dorothy soon sat up, Margaret reviving more slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Dick,\" said Dorothy solemnly, \"did that happen or have I been\r\nunconscious and just had a nightmare?\"\r\n\r\n\"It happened, all right,\" returned her lover, wiping his brow in relief.\r\n\"See that pistol clamped upon the top of the board? That's a token in\r\nremembrance of him.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy, though she had been only half conscious, had heard the words of\r\nthe stranger. As she looked at the faces of the men, white and drawn\r\nwith the mental struggle, she realized what they had gone through, and\r\nshe drew Seaton down into one of the seats, stroking his hair tenderly.\r\n\r\nMargaret went to her room immediately, and as she did not return,\r\nDorothy followed. She came back presently with a look of concern upon\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n\"This life is a little hard on Peggy. I didn't realize how much harder\r\nfor her it would be than it is for me until I went in there and found\r\nher crying. It is much harder for her, of course, since I am with you,\r\nDick, and with you, Martin, whom I know so well. She must feel terribly\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should she?\" demanded Seaton. \"We think she's some game little guy.\r\nWhy, she's one of the bunch! She must know that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it isn't the same,\" insisted Dorothy. \"You be extra nice to her,\r\nDick. But don't you dare let her know I told you about the tears, or\r\nshe'd eat me alive!\"\r\n\r\nCrane said nothing--a not unusual occurrence--but his face grew\r\nthoughtful and his manner, when Margaret appeared at mealtime, was more\r\nsolicitous than usual and more than brotherly in its tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be an interstellar diplomat,\" Dorothy whispered to Seaton as\r\nsoon as they were alone. \"Wasn't that a beautiful bee I put upon\r\nMartin?\"\r\n\r\nSeaton stared at her a moment, then shook her gently before he took her\r\ninto his arms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe information, however, did not prevent him from calling to Crane a\r\nfew minutes later, even though he was still deep in conversation with\r\nMargaret. Dorothy gave him an exasperated glance and walked away.\r\n\r\n\"I sure pulled a boner that time,\" Seaton muttered as he plucked at his\r\nhair ruefully. \"It nearly did us.\r\n\r\n\"Let's test this stuff out and see if it's X, Mart, while DuQuesne's out\r\nof the way. If it is X, it's SOME find!\"\r\n\r\nSeaton cut off a bit of metal with his knife, hammered it into a small\r\npiece of copper, and threw the copper into the power-chamber, out of\r\ncontact with the plating. As the metal received the current the vessel\r\nstarted slightly.\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ X! Mart, we've got enough of this stuff to supply three\r\nworlds!\"\r\n\r\n\"Better put it away somewhere,\" suggested Crane, and after the metal had\r\nbeen removed to Seaton's cabin, the two men again sought a\r\nlanding-place. Almost in their line of flight they saw a close cluster\r\nof stars, each emitting a peculiar greenish light which, in the\r\nspectroscope, revealed a blaze of copper lines.\r\n\r\n\"That's our meat, Martin. We ought to be able to grab some copper in\r\nthat system, where there's so much of it that it colors their sunlight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The copper is undoubtedly there, but it might be too dangerous to get\r\nso close to so many suns. We may have trouble getting away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, our copper's getting horribly low. We've got to find some pretty\r\nquick, somewhere, or else walk back home, and there's our best chance.\r\nWe'll feel our way along. If it gets too strong, we'll beat it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they had approached so close that the suns were great stars widely\r\nspaced in the heavens, Crane relinquished the controls to Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"If you will take the lever awhile, Dick, Margaret and I will go\r\ndownstairs and see if we can locate a planet.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a glance through the telescope, Crane knew that they were still\r\ntoo far from the group of suns to place any planet with certainty, and\r\nbegan taking notes. His mind was not upon his work, however, but was\r\ncompletely filled with thoughts of the girl at his side. The intervals\r\nbetween his comments became longer and longer until they were standing\r\nin silence, both staring with unseeing eyes out into the trackless void.\r\nBut it was in no sense their usual companionable silence. Crane was\r\nfighting back the words he longed to say. This lovely girl was not here\r\nof her own accord--she had been torn forcibly from her home and from her\r\nfriends, and he would not, could not, make her already difficult\r\nposition even more unpleasant by forcing his attentions upon her.\r\nMargaret sensed something unusual and significant in his attitude and\r\nheld herself tense, her heart beating wildly.\r\n\r\nAt that moment an asteroid came within range of the Skylark's watchful\r\nrepeller, and at the lurch of the vessel, as it swung around the\r\nobstruction, Margaret would have fallen had not Crane instinctively\r\ncaught her with one arm. Ordinarily this bit of courtesy would have gone\r\nunnoticed by both, as it had happened many times before, but in that\r\nheavily-charged atmosphere it took on a new significance. Both blushed\r\nhotly, and as their eyes met each saw that which held them spellbound.\r\nSlowly, almost as if without volition, Crane put his other arm around\r\nher. A wave of deeper crimson swept over her face and she bent her\r\nhandsome head as her slender body yielded to his arms with no effort to\r\nfree itself. Finally Crane spoke, his usually even voice faltering.\r\n\r\n\"Margaret, I hope you will not think this unfair of me ... but we have\r\nbeen through so much together that I feel as though we had known each\r\nother forever. Until we went through this last experience I had intended\r\nto wait--but why should we wait? Life is not lived in years alone, and\r\nyou know how much I love you, my dearest!\" he finished, passionately.\r\n\r\nHer arms crept up around his neck, her bowed head lifted, and her eyes\r\nlooked deep into his as she whispered her answer:\r\n\r\n\"I think I do ... Oh, Martin!\"\r\n\r\nPresently they made their way back to the engine-room, keeping the\r\nsinging joy in their hearts inaudible and the kisses fresh upon their\r\nlips invisible. They might have kept their secret for a time, had not\r\nSeaton promptly asked:\r\n\r\n\"Well, what did you find, Mart?\"\r\n\r\nA panicky look appeared upon Crane's self-possessed countenance and\r\nMargaret's fair face glowed like a peony.\r\n\r\n\"_Yes_, what _did_ you find?\" demanded Dorothy, as she noticed their\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\"My future wife,\" Crane answered steadily.\r\n\r\nThe two girls rushed into each other's arms and the two men silently\r\ngripped hands in a clasp of steel; for each of the four knew that these\r\ntwo unions were not passing fancies, lightly entered into and as lightly\r\ncast aside, but were true partnerships which would endure throughout the\r\nentire span of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA planet was located and the Skylark flew toward it. Discovering that it\r\nwas apparently situated in the center of the cluster of suns, they\r\nhesitated; but finding that there was no dangerous force present, they\r\nkept on. As they drew nearer, so that the planet appeared as a very\r\nsmall moon, they saw that the Skylark was in a blaze of green light, and\r\nlooking out of the windows, Crane counted seventeen great suns,\r\nscattered in all directions in the sky! Slowing down abruptly as the\r\nplanet was approached, Seaton dropped the vessel slowly through the\r\natmosphere, while Crane and DuQuesne tested and analyzed it.\r\n\r\n\"Pressure, thirty pounds per square inch. Surface gravity as compared to\r\nthat of the Earth, two-fifths. Air-pressure about double that of the\r\nEarth, while a five-pound weight weighs only two pounds. A peculiar\r\ncombination,\" reported Crane, and DuQuesne added:\r\n\r\n\"Analysis about the same as our air except for two and three-tenths per\r\ncent of a gas that isn't poisonous and which has a peculiar, fragrant\r\nodor. I can't analyze it and think it probably an element unknown upon\r\nEarth, or at least very rare.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have to be rare if you don't know what it is,\" acknowledged\r\nSeaton, locking the Skylark in place and going over to smell the strange\r\ngas.\r\n\r\nDeciding that the air was satisfactory, the pressure inside the vessel\r\nwas slowly raised to the value of that outside and two doors were\r\nopened, to allow the new atmosphere free circulation.\r\n\r\nSeaton shut off the power actuating the repeller and let the vessel\r\nsettle slowly toward the ocean which was directly beneath them--an ocean\r\nof a deep, intense, wondrously beautiful blue, which the scientists\r\nstudied with interest. Arrived at the surface, Seaton moistened a rod in\r\na wave, and tasted it cautiously, then uttered a yell of joy--a yell\r\nbroken off abruptly as he heard the sound of his own voice. Both girls\r\nstarted as the vibrations set up in the dense air smote upon their\r\neardrums. Seaton moderated his voice and continued:\r\n\r\n\"I forgot about the air-pressure. But hurrah for this ocean--it's\r\nammoniacal copper sulphate solution! We can sure get all the copper we\r\nwant, right here, but it would take weeks to evaporate the water and\r\nrecover the metal. We can probably get it easier ashore. Let's go!\"\r\n\r\nThey started off just above the surface of the ocean toward the nearest\r\ncontinent, which they had observed from the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nNalboon of Mardonale\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Skylark approached the shore, its occupants heard a rapid\r\nsuccession of heavy detonations, apparently coming from the direction in\r\nwhich they were traveling.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder what that racket is?\" asked Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like big guns,\" said Crane, and DuQuesne nodded agreement.\r\n\r\n\"Big guns is right. They're shooting high explosive shells, too, or I\r\nnever heard any. Even allowing for the density of the air, that kind of\r\nnoise isn't made by pop-guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go see what's doing,\" and Seaton started to walk toward one of\r\nthe windows with his free, swinging stride. Instantly he was a-sprawl,\r\nthe effort necessary to carry his weight upon the Earth's surface\r\nlifting him into the air in a succession of ludicrous hops, but he soon\r\nrecovered himself and walked normally.\r\n\r\n\"I forgot this two-fifths gravity stuff,\" he laughed. \"Walk as though we\r\nhad only a notch of power on and it goes all right. It sure is funny to\r\nfeel so light when we're so close to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nHe closed the doors to keep out a part of the noise and advanced the\r\nspeed lever a little, so that the vessel tilted sharply under the pull\r\nof the almost horizontal bar.\r\n\r\n\"Go easy,\" cautioned Crane. \"We do not want to get in the way of one of\r\ntheir shells. They may be of a different kind than those we are familiar\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right--easy it is. We'll stay forty miles above them, if necessary.\"\r\n\r\nAs the great speed of the ship rapidly lessened the distance, the sound\r\ngrew heavier and clearer--like one continuous explosion. So closely did\r\none deafening concussion follow another that the ear could not\r\ndistinguish the separate reports.\r\n\r\n\"I see them,\" simultaneously announced Crane, who was seated at one of\r\nthe forward windows searching the country with his binoculars, and\r\nSeaton, who, from the pilot's seat, could see in any direction.\r\n\r\nThe others hurried to the windows with their glasses and saw an\r\nastonishing sight.\r\n\r\n\"Aerial battleships, eight of 'em!\" exclaimed Seaton, \"as big as the\r\nIdaho. Four of 'em are about the same shape as our battleships. No\r\nwings--they act like helicopters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four of them are battleships, right enough, but what about the other\r\nfour?\" asked DuQuesne. \"They are not ships or planes or anything else\r\nthat I ever heard of.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are animals,\" asserted Crane. \"Machines never were and never will\r\nbe built like that.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Skylark cautiously approached, it was evident to the watchers\r\nthat four of the contestants were undoubtedly animals. Here indeed was a\r\nnew kind of animal, an animal able to fight on even terms with a\r\nfirst-class battleship! Frightful aerial monsters they were. Each had an\r\nenormous, torpedo-shaped body, with scores of prodigiously long\r\ntentacles like those of a devil-fish and a dozen or more great, soaring\r\nwings. Even at that distance they could see the row of protruding eyes\r\nalong the side of each monstrous body and the terrible, prow-like beaks\r\ntearing through the metal of the warships opposing them. They could see,\r\nby the reflection of the light from the many suns, that each monster was\r\napparently covered by scales and joints of some transparent armor. That\r\nit was real and highly effective armor there could be no doubt, for each\r\nbattleship bristled with guns of heavy caliber and each gun was vomiting\r\nforth a continuous stream of fire. Shells bursting against each of the\r\ncreatures made one continuous blaze, and the uproar was\r\nindescribable--an uninterrupted cataclysm of sound appalling in its\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe battle was brief. Soon all four of the battleships had crumpled to\r\nthe ground, their crews absorbed by the terrible sucking arms or\r\ndevoured by the frightful beaks. They did not die in vain--three of the\r\nmonsters had been blown to atoms by shells which had apparently\r\npenetrated their armor. The fourth was pursuing something, which Seaton\r\nnow saw was a fleet of small airships, which had flown away from the\r\nscene of conflict. Swift as they were, the monster covered three feet to\r\ntheir one.\r\n\r\n\"We can't stand for anything like that,\" cried Seaton, as he threw on\r\nthe power and the Skylark leaped ahead. \"Get ready to bump him off,\r\nMart, when I jerk him away. He acts hard-boiled, so give him a real\r\none--fifty milligrams!\"\r\n\r\nSweeping on with awful speed the monster seized the largest and most\r\ngaily decorated plane in his hundred-foot tentacles just as the Skylark\r\ncame within sighting distance. In four practically simultaneous\r\nmovements Seaton sighted the attractor at the ugly beak, released all\r\nits power, pointed the main bar of the Skylark directly upward, and\r\nadvanced his speed lever. There was a crash of rending metal as the\r\nthing was torn loose from the plane and jerked a hundred miles into the\r\nair, struggling so savagely in that invisible and incomprehensible grip\r\nthat the three-thousand-ton mass of the Skylark tossed and pitched like\r\na child's plaything. Those inside her heard the sharp, spiteful crack of\r\nthe machine-gun, and an instant later they heard a report that paralyzed\r\ntheir senses, even inside the vessel and in the thin air of their\r\nenormous elevation, as the largest X-plosive bullet prepared by the\r\ninventors struck full upon the side of the hideous body. There was no\r\nsmoke, no gas or vapor of any kind--only a huge volume of intolerable\r\nflame as the energy stored within the atoms of copper, instantaneously\r\nliberated, heated to incandescence and beyond all the atmosphere within\r\na radius of hundreds of feet. The monster disappeared utterly, and\r\nSeaton, with unerring hand, reversed the bar and darted back down toward\r\nthe fleet of airships. He reached them in time to focus the attractor\r\nupon the wrecked and helpless plane in the middle of its\r\nfive-thousand-foot fall and lowered it gently to the ground, surrounded\r\nby the fleet.\r\n\r\nThe Skylark landed easily beside the wrecked machine, and the wanderers\r\nsaw that their vessel was completely surrounded by a crowd of\r\npeople--men and women identical in form and feature with themselves.\r\nThey were a superbly molded race, the men fully as large as Seaton and\r\nDuQuesne; the women, while smaller than the men, were noticeably taller\r\nthan the two women in the car. The men wore broad collars of metal,\r\nnumerous metallic ornaments, and heavily-jeweled leather belts and\r\nshoulder-straps which were hung with weapons of peculiar patterns. The\r\nwomen carried no weapons, but were even more highly decorated than were\r\nthe men--each slender, perfectly-formed body scintillated with the\r\nbrilliance of hundreds of strange gems, flashing points of fire. Jeweled\r\nbands of metal and leather restrained their carefully-groomed hair;\r\njeweled collars encircled their throats; jeweled belts, jeweled\r\nbracelets, jeweled anklets, each added its quota of brilliance to the\r\nglittering whole. The strangers wore no clothing, and their smooth skins\r\nshone a dark, livid, utterly indescribable color in the peculiar,\r\nunearthly, yellowish-bluish-green glare of the light. Green their skins\r\nundoubtedly were, but not any shade of green visible in the Earthly\r\nspectrum. The \"whites\" of their eyes were a light yellowish-green. The\r\nheavy hair of the women and the close-cropped locks of the men were\r\ngreen as well--a green so dark as to be almost black, as were also their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what d'you know about that?\" pondered Seaton, dazedly. \"They're\r\nhuman, right enough, but ye gods, what a color!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is hard to tell how much of that color is real, and how much of it\r\nis due to this light,\" answered Crane. \"Wait until you get outside, away\r\nfrom our daylight lamps, and you will probably look like a Chinese\r\npuzzle. As to the form, it is logical to suppose that wherever\r\nconditions are similar to those upon the Earth, and the age is anywhere\r\nnearly the same, development would be along the same lines as with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, too. Dottie, your hair will sure look gorgeous in this\r\nlight. Let's go out and give the natives a treat!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't look like that for a million dollars!\" retorted Dorothy,\r\n\"and if I'm going to look like that I won't get out of the ship, so\r\nthere!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up, Dottie, you won't look like that. Your hair will be black in\r\nthis light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what color will mine be?\" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\nSeaton glanced at her black hair.\r\n\r\n\"Probably a very dark and beautiful green,\" he grinned, his gray eyes\r\nsparkling, \"but we'll have to wait and see. Friends and\r\nfellow-countrymen, I've got a hunch that this is going to be SOME visit.\r\nHow about it, shall we go ahead with it?\"\r\n\r\nDorothy went up to him, her face bright with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a lark! Let's go!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven in DuQuesne's cold presence, Margaret's eyes sought those of her\r\nlover, and his sleeve, barely touching her arm, was enough to send a\r\ndancing thrill along it.\r\n\r\n\"Onward, men of Earth!\" she cried, and Seaton, stepping up to the\r\nwindow, rapped sharply upon the glass with the butt of his pistol and\r\nraised both hands high above his head in the universal sign of peace. In\r\nresponse, a man of Herculean mold, so splendidly decorated that his\r\nharness was one blazing mass of jewels, waved his arm and shouted a\r\ncommand. The crowd promptly fell back, leaving a clear space of several\r\nhundred yards. The man, evidently one in high command, unbuckled his\r\nharness, dropping every weapon, and advanced toward the Skylark, both\r\narms upraised in Seaton's gesture.\r\n\r\nSeaton went to the door and started to open it.\r\n\r\n\"Better talk to him from inside,\" cautioned Crane.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, Mart. He's peaceable, and I've got my gun in my\r\npocket. Since he doesn't know what clothes are he'll think I'm unarmed,\r\nwhich is as it should be; and if he shows fight, it won't take more than\r\na week for me to get into action.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, go on. DuQuesne and I will come along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely not. He's alone, so I've got to be. I notice that some of\r\nhis men are covering us, though. You might do the same for them, with a\r\ncouple of the machine guns.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton stepped out of the car and went to meet the stranger. When they\r\nhad approached to within a few feet of each other the stranger stopped.\r\nHe flexed his left arm smartly, so that the finger-tips touched his left\r\near, and smiled broadly, exposing a row of splendid, shining, green\r\nteeth. Then he spoke, a meaningless jumble of sounds. His voice, though\r\nlight and thin, nevertheless seemed to be of powerful timbre.\r\n\r\nSeaton smiled in return and saluted.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Chief. I get your idea all right, and we're glad you're\r\npeaceable, but your language doesn't mean a thing in my young life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief tapped himself upon the chest, saying distinctly and\r\nimpressively:\r\n\r\n\"Nalboon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nalboon,\" repeated Seaton, and added, pointing to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Seaton.\"\r\n\r\n\"See Tin,\" answered the stranger, and again indicating himself, \"Domak\r\ngok Mardonale.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must be his title,\" thought Seaton rapidly. \"Have to give myself\r\none, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boss of the Road,\" he replied, drawing himself up with pride.\r\n\r\nThe introduction made, Nalboon pointed to the wrecked plane, inclined\r\nhis head in thanks, and turned to his people with one arm upraised,\r\nshouting an order in which Seaton could distinguish something that\r\nsounded like \"See Tin, Bass uvvy Rood.\" Instantly every right arm in the\r\nassemblage was aloft, that of each man bearing a weapon, while the left\r\narms snapped into the peculiar salute and a mighty cry arose as all\r\nrepeated the name and title of the distinguished visitor.\r\n\r\nSeaton turned to the Skylark, motioning to Crane to open the door.\r\n\r\n\"Bring out one of those big four-color signal rockets, Mart!\" he called.\r\n\"They're giving us a royal reception--let's acknowledge it right.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe party appeared, Crane carrying the huge rocket with an air of\r\ndeference. As they approached, Seaton shrugged one shoulder and his\r\ncigarette-case appeared in his hand. Nalboon started, and in spite of\r\nhis utmost efforts at self-control, he glanced at it in surprise. The\r\ncase flew open and Seaton, taking a cigarette, extended the case.\r\n\r\n\"Smoke?\" he asked affably. The other took one, but showed plainly that\r\nhe had no idea of the use to which it was to be put. This astonishment\r\nof the stranger at a simple sleight-of-hand feat and his apparent\r\nignorance of tobacco emboldened Seaton. Reaching into his mouth, he\r\npulled out a flaming match, at which Nalboon started violently. While\r\nall the natives watched in amazement, Seaton lighted the cigarette, and\r\nafter half consuming it in two long inhalations, he apparently swallowed\r\nthe remainder, only to bring it to light again. Having smoked it, he\r\napparently swallowed the butt, with evident relish.\r\n\r\n\"They don't know anything about matches or smoking,\" he said, turning to\r\nCrane. \"This rocket will tie them up in a knot. Step back, everybody.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed deeply to Nalboon, pulling a lighted match from his ear as he\r\ndid so, and lighted the fuse. There was a roar, a shower of sparks, a\r\nblaze of colored fire as the great rocket flew upward; but to Seaton's\r\nsurprise, Nalboon took it quite as a matter of course, saluting as an\r\nacknowledgment of the courtesy.\r\n\r\nSeaton motioned to his party to approach, and turned to Crane.\r\n\r\n\"Better not, Dick. Let him think that you are the king of everything in\r\nsight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life. If he is one king, we are two,\" and he introduced\r\nCrane, with great ceremony, to the Domak as the \"Boss of the Skylark,\"\r\nat which the salute by his people was repeated.\r\n\r\nNalboon then shouted an order and a company of soldiers led by an\r\nofficer came toward them, surrounding a small group of people,\r\napparently prisoners. These captives, seven men and seven women, were\r\nmuch lighter in color than the rest of the gathering, having skins of a\r\nghastly, pale shade, practically the same color as the whites of their\r\neyes. In other bodily aspects they were the same as their captors in\r\nappearance, save that they were entirely naked except for the jeweled\r\nmetal collars worn by all and a massive metal belt worn by one man. They\r\nwalked with a proud and lofty carriage, scorn for their captors in every\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nNalboon barked an order to the prisoners. They stared in defiance,\r\nmotionless, until the man wearing the belt who had studied Seaton\r\nclosely, spoke a few words in a low tone, when they all prostrated\r\nthemselves. Nalboon then waved his hand, giving the whole group to\r\nSeaton as slaves. Seaton, with no sign of his surprise, thanked the\r\ngiver and motioned his slaves to rise. They obeyed and placed themselves\r\nbehind the party--two men and two women behind Seaton and the same\r\nnumber behind Crane; one man and one woman behind each of the others.\r\n\r\nSeaton then tried to make Nalboon understand that they wanted copper,\r\npointing to his anklet, the only copper in sight. The chief instantly\r\nremoved the trinket and handed it to Seaton; who, knowing by the gasp of\r\nsurprise of the guard that it was some powerful symbol, returned it with\r\nprofuse apologies. After trying in vain to make the other understand\r\nwhat he wanted, he led him into the Skylark and showed him the remnant\r\nof the power-bar. He showed him its original size and indicated the\r\ndesired number by counting to sixteen upon his fingers. Nalboon nodded\r\nhis comprehension and going outside, pointed upward toward the largest\r\nof the eleven suns visible, motioning its rising and setting, four\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nHe then invited the visitors, in unmistakable sign language, to\r\naccompany him as guests of honor, but Seaton refused.\r\n\r\n\"Lead on, MacDuff, we follow,\" he replied, explaining his meaning by\r\nsigns as they turned to enter the vessel. The slaves followed closely\r\nuntil Crane remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"We don't want them aboard, do we, Dick? There are too many of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Seaton replied, and waved them away. As they stepped back\r\nthe guard seized the nearest, a woman, and forced her to her knees;\r\nwhile a man, adorned with a necklace of green human teeth and carrying a\r\nshining broadsword, prepared to decapitate her.\r\n\r\n\"We must take them with us, I see,\" said Crane, as he brushed the guards\r\naside. Followed by the slaves, the party entered the Skylark, and the\r\ndark green people embarked in their airplanes and helicopters.\r\n\r\nNalboon rode in a large and gaily-decorated plane, which led the fleet\r\nat its full speed of six hundred miles an hour, the Skylark taking a\r\nplacing a few hundred yards above the flagship.\r\n\r\n\"I don't get these folks at all, Mart,\" said Seaton, after a moment's\r\nsilence. \"They have machines far ahead of anything we have on Earth and\r\nbig guns that shoot as fast as machine-guns, and yet are scared to death\r\nat a little simple sleight-of-hand. They don't seem to understand\r\nmatches at all, and yet treat fire-works as an every-day occurrence.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will have to wait until we know them better,\" replied Crane, and\r\nDuQuesne added:\r\n\r\n\"From what I have seen, their power seems to be all electrical. Perhaps\r\nthey aren't up with us in chemistry, even though they are ahead of us in\r\nmechanics?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlying above a broad, but rapid and turbulent stream, the fleet soon\r\nneared a large city, and the visitors from Earth gazed with interest at\r\nthis metropolis of the unknown world. The buildings were all the same\r\nheight, flat-roofed, and arranged in squares very much as our cities are\r\narranged. There were no streets, the spaces between the buildings being\r\npark-like areas, evidently laid out for recreation, amusement, and\r\nsport. There was no need for streets; all traffic was in the air. The\r\nair seemed full of flying vehicles, darting in all directions, but it\r\nwas soon evident that there was exact order in the apparent confusion,\r\neach class of vessel and each direction of traffic having its own level.\r\nEagerly the three men studied the craft, which ranged in size from\r\none-man helicopters, little more than single chairs flying about in the\r\nair, up to tremendous multiplane freighters, capable of carrying\r\nthousands of tons.\r\n\r\nFlying high over the city to avoid its congested air-lanes, the fleet\r\ndescended toward an immense building just outside the city proper, and\r\nall landed upon its roof save the flagship, which led the Skylark to a\r\nlanding-dock nearby--a massive pile of metal and stone, upon which\r\nNalboon and his retinue stood to welcome the guests. After Seaton had\r\nanchored the vessel immovably by means of the attractor, the party\r\ndisembarked, Seaton remarking with a grin:\r\n\r\n\"Don't be surprised at anything I do, folks. I'm a walking storehouse of\r\njunk of all kinds, so that if occasion arises I can put on a real\r\nexhibition.\"\r\n\r\nAs they turned toward their host, a soldier, in his eagerness to see the\r\nstrangers, jostled another. Without a word two keen swords flew from\r\ntheir scabbards and a duel to the death ensued. The visitors stared in\r\namazement, but no one else paid any attention to the combat, which was\r\nsoon over; the victor turning away from the body of his opponent and\r\nresuming his place without creating a ripple of interest.\r\n\r\nNalboon led the way into an elevator, which dropped rapidly to the\r\nground-floor level. Massive gates were thrown open, and through ranks of\r\npeople prostrate upon their faces the party went out into the palace\r\ngrounds of the Domak, or Emperor, of the great nation of Mardonale.\r\n\r\nNever before had Earthly eyes rested upon such scenes of splendor. Every\r\ncolor and gradation of their peculiar spectrum was present, in solid,\r\nliquid, and gas. The carefully-tended trees were all colors of the\r\nrainbow, as were the grasses and flowers along the walks. The fountains\r\nplayed streams of many and constantly-changing hues, and even the air\r\nwas tinted and perfumed, swirling through metal arches in billows of\r\never-varying colors and scents. Colors and combinations of colors\r\nimpossible to describe were upon every hand, fantastically beautiful in\r\nthat peculiar, livid light. Diamonds and rubies, their colors so\r\ndistorted by the green radiance as to be almost unrecognizable; emeralds\r\nglowing with an intense green impossible in earthly light, together with\r\nstrange gems peculiar to this strange world, sparkled and flashed from\r\nrailings, statues, and pedestals throughout the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't this gorgeous, Dick?\" whispered Dorothy. \"But what do I look\r\nlike? I wish I had a mirror--you look simply awful. Do I look like you\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not being able to see myself, I can't say, but I imagine you do. You\r\nlook as you would under a county-fair photographer's mercury-vapor arc\r\nlamps, only worse. The colors can't be described. You might as well try\r\nto describe cerise to a man born blind as to try to express these\r\ncolors in English, but as near as I can come to it, your eyes are a dark\r\nsort of purplish green, with the whites of your eyes and your teeth a\r\nkind of plush green. Your skin is a pale yellowish green, except for the\r\npink of your cheeks, which is a kind of black, with orange and green\r\nmixed up in it. Your lips are black, and your hair is a funny kind of\r\ncolor, halfway between black and old rose, with a little green and....\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, Dick, stop! That's enough!\" choked Dorothy. \"We all look like\r\nhobgoblins. We're even worse than the natives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure we are. They were born here and are acclimated to it--we are\r\nstrangers and aren't. I would like to see what one of these people would\r\nlook like in Washington.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNalboon led them into the palace proper and into a great dining hall,\r\nwhere a table was already prepared for the entire party. This room was\r\nsplendidly decorated with jewels, its many windows being simply masses\r\nof gems. The walls were hung with a cloth resembling silk, which fell to\r\nthe floor in shimmering waves of color.\r\n\r\nWoodwork there was none. Doors, panels, tables, and chairs were\r\ncunningly wrought of various metals. Seaton and DuQuesne could recognize\r\na few of them, but for the most part they were unknown upon the Earth;\r\nand were, like the jewels and vegetation of this strange world, of many\r\nand various peculiar colors. A closer inspection of one of the marvelous\r\ntapestries showed that it also was of metal, its threads numbering\r\nthousands to the inch. Woven of many different metals, of vivid but\r\nharmonious colors in a strange and intricate design, it seemed to writhe\r\nas its colors changed with every variation in the color of the light;\r\nwhich, pouring from concealed sources, was reflected by the\r\nhighly-polished metal and innumerable jewels of the lofty, domed\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\n\"Oh ... isn't this too perfectly gorgeous?\" breathed Dorothy. \"I'd give\r\nanything for a dress made out of that stuff, Dick. Cloth-of-gold is\r\ncommon by comparison!\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you dare wear it, Dottie?\" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"_Would_ I? I'd wear it in a minute if I could only get it. It would\r\ntake Washington by storm!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try to get a piece of it, then,\" smiled Seaton. \"I'll see about it\r\nwhile we are getting the copper.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better be careful in choosing what we eat here, Seaton,\" suggested\r\nDuQuesne, as the Domak himself led them to the table.\r\n\r\n\"We sure had. With a copper ocean and green teeth, I shouldn't be\r\nsurprised if copper, arsenic, and other such trifles formed a regular\r\npart of their diet.\"\r\n\r\n\"The girls and I will wait for you two chemists to approve every dish\r\nbefore we try it, then,\" said Crane.\r\n\r\nNalboon placed his guests, the light-skinned slaves standing at\r\nattention behind them, and numerous servants, carrying great trays,\r\nappeared. The servants were intermediate in color between the light and\r\nthe dark races, with dull, unintelligent faces, but quick and deft in\r\ntheir movements.\r\n\r\nThe first course--a thin, light wine, served in metal goblets--was\r\napproved by the chemists, and the dinner was brought on. There were\r\nmighty joints of various kinds of meat; birds and fish, both raw and\r\ncooked in many ways; green, pink, purple, and white vegetables and\r\nfruits. The majordomo held each dish up to Seaton for inspection, the\r\nlatter waving away the fish and the darkest green foods, but approving\r\nthe others. Heaping plates, or rather metal trays, of food were placed\r\nbefore the diners, and the attendants behind their chairs handed them\r\npeculiar implements--knives with razor edges, needle-pointed stilettoes\r\ninstead of forks, and wide, flexible spatulas, which evidently were to\r\nserve the purposes of both forks and spoons.\r\n\r\n\"I simply can't eat with these things!\" exclaimed Dorothy in dismay,\r\n\"and I don't like to drink soup out of a can, so there!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's where my lumberjack training comes in handy,\" grinned Seaton.\r\n\"With this spatula I can eat faster than I could with two forks. What do\r\nyou want, girls, forks or spoons, or both?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both, please.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton reached out over the table, seizing forks and spoons from the air\r\nand passing them to the others, while the natives stared in surprise.\r\nThe Domak took a bowl filled with brilliant blue crystals from the\r\nmajor-domo, sprinkled his food liberally with the substance, and passed\r\nit to Seaton, who looked at the crystals attentively.\r\n\r\n\"Copper sulphate,\" he said to Crane. \"It's a good thing they add it at\r\nthe table instead of cooking with it, or we'd be out of luck.\"\r\n\r\nWaving the copper sulphate away, he again reached out, this time\r\nproducing a pair of small salt-and pepper-shakers, which he passed to\r\nthe Domak after he had seasoned the dishes before him. Nalboon tasted\r\nthe pepper cautiously and smiled in delight, half-emptying the shaker\r\nupon his plate. He then sprinkled a few grains of salt into his palm,\r\nstared at them with an expression of doubting amazement, and after a few\r\nrapid sentences poured them into a dish held by an officer who had\r\nsprung to his side. The officer studied them closely, then carefully\r\nwashed his chief's hand. Nalboon turned to Seaton, plainly asking for\r\nthe salt-cellar.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, old top. Keep 'em both, there's lots more where those came from,\"\r\nas he produced several more sets in the same mysterious way and handed\r\nthem to Crane, who in turn passed them to the others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe meal progressed merrily, with much conversation in the sign-language\r\nbetween the two parties. It was evident that Nalboon, usually stern and\r\nreticent, was in an unusually pleasant mood. The viands, though of\r\npeculiar flavor, were in the main pleasing to the palates of the Earthly\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n\"This fruit salad, or whatever it is, is divine,\" remarked Dorothy,\r\nafter an experimental bite. \"May we eat as much as we like, or had we\r\nbetter just eat a little?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go as far as you like,\" returned her lover. \"I wouldn't recommend it,\r\nas a steady diet, as I imagine everything contains copper and other\r\nheavy metals in noticeable amounts, and probably considerable arsenic,\r\nbut for a few days it can't very well hurt us much.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the meal, Nalboon bade them a ceremonious farewell, and they were\r\nescorted to a series of five connecting rooms by the royal usher,\r\nescorted by an entire company of soldiers, who mounted guard outside the\r\ndoors. Gathered in one room, they discussed sleeping arrangements. The\r\ngirls insisted that they would sleep together, and that the men should\r\noccupy the rooms at either side. As the girls turned away, the four\r\nslaves followed.\r\n\r\n\"We don't want these people, and I can't make them go away!\" cried\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want them, either,\" replied Seaton, \"but if we chase them out\r\nthey'll get their heads chopped off. You girls take the women and we'll\r\ntake the men.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton waved all the women into the girls' room, but they paused\r\nirresolutely. One of them went up to the man wearing the metal belt,\r\nevidently their leader, and spoke to him rapidly as she threw her arms\r\naround his neck. He shook his head, motioning toward Seaton several\r\ntimes as he spoke to her reassuringly. With his arm about her tenderly,\r\nhe led her to the door, the other women following. Crane and DuQuesne\r\nhaving gone to their rooms with their attendants, the man wearing the\r\nbelt drew the blinds and turned to assist Seaton in taking off his\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\"I never had a valet before, but go as far as you like if it pleases\r\nyou,\" remarked Seaton, as he began to throw off his clothes. A multitude\r\nof small articles fell from their hiding-places in his garments as he\r\nremoved them. Almost stripped, Seaton stretched vigorously, the muscles\r\nwrithing and rippling in great ridges under the satin skin of his broad\r\nback and mighty arms and shoulders as he filled his capacious lungs and\r\ntwisted about, working off the stiffness caused by the days of\r\ncomparative confinement.\r\n\r\nThe four slaves stared in open-mouthed astonishment at this display of\r\nmuscular development and conversed among themselves as they gathered up\r\nSeaton's discarded clothing. Their leader picked up a salt-shaker, a\r\ncouple of silver knives and forks, and some other articles, and turned\r\nto Seaton, apparently asking permission to do something with them.\r\nSeaton nodded assent carelessly and turned to his bed. As he did so, he\r\nheard a slight clank of arms in the hall as the guard was changed, and\r\nlifting the blind a trifle he saw that guards were stationed outside as\r\nwell. As he went to bed, he wondered whether the guards were guards of\r\nhonor or jailers; whether he and his party were honored guests or\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nThree of the slaves, at a word from their chief, threw themselves upon\r\nthe floor and slept, but he himself did not rest. Opening the apparently\r\nsolid metal belt, he took out a great number of small tools, many tiny\r\ninstruments, and several spools of insulated wire. He then took the\r\narticles Seaton had given him, taking great pains not to spill a single\r\ngrain of salt, and set to work. Hour after hour he labored, a strange,\r\nexceedingly complex instrument taking form under his clever fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    +--------------------------------------+\r\n    |                                      |\r\n    | _By the time you finish reading the  |\r\n    | final instalment of \"The Skylark of  |\r\n    | Space,\" we are certain that you will |\r\n    | agree with us that it is one of the  |\r\n    | outstanding scienti-fiction stories  |\r\n    | of the decade; an interplanetarian   |\r\n    | story that will not be eclipsed      |\r\n    | soon.

No sooner\r\nhad he started to shave, however, than one of the slaves touched his\r\narm, motioning him into a reclining chair and showing him a keen blade,\r\nlong and slightly curved. Seaton lay down and the slave shaved him with\r\na rapidity and smoothness he had never before experienced, so\r\nwonderfully sharp was the peculiar razor. After Seaton had dressed, the\r\nbarber started to shave the chief slave, without any preliminary\r\ntreatment save rubbing his face with a perfumed oil.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on a minute,\" interjected Seaton, who was watching the process\r\nwith interest, \"here's something that helps a lot.\" He lathered the face\r\nwith his brush and the man looked up in surprised pleasure as his stiff\r\nbeard was swept away without a sound.\r\n\r\nSeaton called to the others and soon the party was assembled in his\r\nroom, all dressed very lightly, because of the unrelieved and unvarying\r\nheat, which was constant at one hundred degrees. A gong sounded, and one\r\nof the slaves opened the door, ushering in a party of servants bearing a\r\ntable, ready set. During the meal, Seaton was greatly surprised at\r\nhearing Dorothy carrying on a halting conversation, with one of the\r\nwomen standing behind her.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that you were a language shark, Dottie, with five or six\r\ndifferent ones to your credit, but I didn't suppose you could learn to\r\ntalk this stuff in one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" she replied, \"but I've picked up a few words of it. I can\r\nunderstand very little of what they are trying to tell me.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman spoke rapidly to the man standing behind Seaton, and as soon\r\nas the table had been carried away, he asked permission to speak to\r\nDorothy. Fairly running across to her, he made a slight obeisance and in\r\neager tones poured forth such a stream of language that she held up her\r\nhand to silence him.\r\n\r\n\"Go slower, please,\" she said, and added a couple of words in his own\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nThere ensued a strange dialogue, with many repetitions and much use of\r\nsigns. She turned to Seaton, with a puzzled look.\r\n\r\n\"I can't make out all he says, Dick, but he wants you to take him into\r\nanother room of the palace here, to get back something or other that\r\nthey took from him when they captured him. He can't go alone--I think he\r\nsays he will be killed if he goes anywhere without you. And he says that\r\nwhen you get there, you must be sure not to let the guards come inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, let's go!\" and Seaton motioned the man to precede him. As\r\nSeaton started for the door, Dorothy fell into step beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Better stay back, Dottie, I'll be back in a minute,\" he said at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"I will not stay back. Wherever you go, I go,\" she replied in a voice\r\ninaudible to the others. \"I simply will not stay away from you a single\r\nminute that I don't have to.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, little girl,\" he replied in the same tone. \"I don't want to\r\nbe away from you, either, and I don't think that we're in any danger\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nPreceded by the chief slave and followed by half a dozen others, they\r\nwent out into the hall. No opposition was made to their progress, but a\r\nfull half-company of armed guards fell in around them as an escort,\r\nregarding Seaton with looks composed of equal parts of reverence and\r\nfear. The slave led the way rapidly to a room in a distant wing of the\r\npalace and opened the door. As Seaton stepped in, he saw that it was\r\nevidently an audience-chamber or court-room, and that it was now\r\nentirely empty. As the guard approached the door, Seaton waved them\r\nback. All retreated across the hall except the officer in charge, who\r\nrefused to move. Seaton, the personification of offended dignity, first\r\nstared at the offender, who returned the stare, and stepped up to him\r\ninsolently, then pushed him back roughly, forgetting that his strength,\r\ngreat upon Earth, would be gigantic upon this smaller world. The officer\r\nspun across the corridor, knocking down three of his men in his flight.\r\nPicking himself up, he drew his sword and rushed, while his men fled in\r\npanic to the extreme end of the corridor. Seaton did not wait for him,\r\nbut in one bound leaped half-way across the intervening space to meet\r\nhim. With the vastly superior agility of his earthly muscles he dodged\r\nthe falling broadsword and drove his left fist full against the fellow's\r\nchin, with all the force of his mighty arm and all the momentum of his\r\nrapidly moving body behind the blow. The crack of breaking bones was\r\ndistinctly audible as the officer's head snapped back. The force of the\r\nblow lifted him high into the air, and after turning a complete\r\nsomersault, he brought up with a crash against the opposite wall,\r\ndropping to the floor stone dead. As several of his men, braver than the\r\nothers, lifted their peculiar rifles, Seaton drew and fired in one\r\nincredibly swift motion, the X-plosive bullet obliterating the entire\r\ngroup of men and demolishing that end of the palace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the slave had taken several pieces of apparatus from a\r\ncabinet in the room and had placed them in his belt. Stopping only to\r\nobserve for a few moments a small instrument which he clamped upon the\r\nhead of the dead man, he rapidly led the way back to the room they had\r\nleft and set to work upon the instrument he had constructed while the\r\nothers had been asleep. He connected it, in an intricate system of\r\nwiring, with the pieces of apparatus he had just recovered.\r\n\r\n\"That's a complex job of wiring,\" said DuQuesne admiringly. \"I've seen\r\nseveral intricate pieces of apparatus myself, but he has so many\r\ncircuits there that I'm lost. It would take an hour to figure out the\r\nlines and connections alone.\"\r\n\r\nStraightening abruptly, the slave clamped several electrodes upon his\r\ntemples and motioned to Seaton and the others, speaking to Dorothy as he\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\n\"He wants us to let him put those things on our heads,\" she translated.\r\n\"Shall we let him, Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied without hesitation. \"I've got a real hunch that he's\r\nour friend, and I'm not sure of Nalboon. He doesn't act right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, too,\" agreed the girl, and Crane added:\r\n\r\n\"I can't say that I relish the idea, but since I know that you are a\r\ngood poker player, Dick, I am willing to follow your hunch. How about\r\nyou, DuQuesne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" declared that worthy, emphatically. \"Nobody wires me up to\r\nanything I can't understand, and that machine is too deep for me.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret elected to follow Crane's example, and, impressed by the need\r\nfor haste evident in the slave's bearing, the four walked up to the\r\nmachine without further talk. The electrodes were clamped into place\r\nquickly and the slave pressed a lever. Instantly the four visitors felt\r\nthat they had a complete understanding of the languages and customs of\r\nboth Mardonale, the nation in which they now were, and of Kondal, to\r\nwhich nation the slaves belonged, the only two civilized nations upon\r\nOsnome. While the look of amazement at this method of receiving\r\ninstruction was still upon their faces, the slave--or rather, as they\r\nnow knew him, Dunark, the Kofedix or Crown Prince of the great nation of\r\nKondal--began to disconnect the wires. He cut out the wires leading to\r\nthe two girls and to Crane, and was reaching for Seaton's, when there\r\nwas a blinding flash, a crackling sound, the heavy smoke of burning\r\nmetal and insulation, and both Dunark and Seaton fell to the floor.\r\n\r\nBefore Crane could reach them, however, they were upon their feet and\r\nthe stranger said in his own tongue, now understood by every one but\r\nDuQuesne:\r\n\r\n\"This machine is a mechanical educator, a thing entirely new, in our\r\nworld at least. Although I have been working on it for a long time, it\r\nis still in a very crude form. I did not like to use it in its present\r\nstate of development, but it was necessary in order to warn you of what\r\nNalboon is going to do to you, and to convince you that the best way of\r\nsaving your lives would save our lives as well. The machine worked\r\nperfectly until something, I don't know what, went wrong. Instead of\r\nstopping, as it should have done, at teaching your party to speak our\r\nlanguages, it short-circuited us two completely, so that every\r\nconvolution in each of our brains has been imprinted upon the brain of\r\nthe other. It was the sudden formation of all the new convolutions that\r\nrendered us unconscious. I can only apologize for the break-down, and\r\nassure you that my intentions were of the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't apologize,\" returned Seaton. \"That was a wonderful\r\nperformance, and we're both gainers, anyway, aren't we? It has taken us\r\nall our lives to learn what little we know, and now we each have the\r\nbenefit of two lifetimes, spent upon different worlds! I must admit,\r\nthough, that I have a whole lot of knowledge that I don't know how to\r\nuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you take it that way,\" returned the other warmly, \"for I am\r\ninfinitely the better off for the exchange. The knowledge I imparted was\r\nnothing, compared to that which I received. But time presses--I must\r\ntell you our situation. I am, as you now know, the Kofedix of Kondal.\r\nThe other thirteen are fedo and fediro, or, as you would say, princes\r\nand princesses of the same nation. We were captured by one of Nalboon's\r\nraiding parties while upon a hunting trip, being overcome by some new,\r\nstupefying gas, so that we could not kill ourselves. As you know, Kondal\r\nand Mardonale have been at war for over ten thousand karkamo--something\r\nmore than six thousand years of your time. The war between us is one of\r\nutter extermination. Captives are never exchanged and only once during\r\nan ordinary lifetime does one ever escape. Our attendants were killed\r\nimmediately. We were being taken to furnish sport for Nalboon's party by\r\nbeing fed to one of his captive kolono--animals something like your\r\nearthly devilfish--when the escort of battleships was overcome by those\r\nfour karlono, the animals you saw, and one of them seized Nalboon's\r\nplane, in which we were prisoners. You killed the karlon, saving our\r\nlives as well as those of Nalboon and his party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Having saved his life, you and your party should be honored guests of\r\nthe most honored kind, and I venture to say that you would be so\r\nregarded in any other nation of the universe. But Nalboon, the Domak--a\r\ntitle equivalent to your word 'Emperor' and our word 'Karfedix'--of\r\nMardonale, is utterly without either honor or conscience, as are all\r\nMardonalians. At first he was afraid of you, as were we all. We thought\r\nyou visitors from a planet of our fifteenth sun, which is now at its\r\nnearest possible approach to us. After your display of superhuman power\r\nand ability, we expected instant annihilation. However, after seeing the\r\nSkylark as a machine, discovering that you are short of power, and\r\nfinding that you are gentle instead of bloodthirsty by nature, Nalboon\r\nlost his fear of you and resolved to rob you of your vessel, with its\r\nwonderful secrets of power. Though we are so ignorant of chemistry that\r\nI cannot understand the thousandth part of what I just learned from you,\r\nwe are a race of mechanics and have developed machines of many kinds to\r\na high state of efficiency, including electrical machines of all kinds.\r\nIn fact, electricity, generated by our great waterfalls, is our only\r\npower. No scientist upon Osnome has ever had an inkling that\r\nintra-atomic energy exists. Nalboon cannot understand the power, but he\r\nsolved the means of liberating it at a glance--and that glance sealed\r\nyour death-warrants. With the Skylark, he could conquer Kondal, and to\r\nassure the downfall of my nation he would do anything.\r\n\r\n\"Also, he or any other Osnomian scientist would go to any lengths\r\nwhatever--would challenge the great First Cause itself--to secure even\r\none of those little bottles of the chemical you call 'salt.' It is far\r\nand away the scarcest and most precious substance in the world. It is so\r\nrare that those bottles you produced at the table held more than the\r\ntotal amount previously known to exist upon Osnome. We have great\r\nabundance of all the heavy metals, but the lighter metals are rare.\r\nSodium and chlorin are the rarest of all known elements. Its immense\r\nvalue is due, not to its rarity, but to the fact that it is an\r\nindispensable component of the controlling instruments of our wireless\r\npower stations and that it is used as a catalyst in the manufacture of\r\nour hardest metals.\r\n\r\n\"For these reasons, you understand why Nalboon does not intend to let\r\nyou escape and why he intends that this kokam (our equivalent of a day)\r\nshall be your last. About the second or third kam (hour) of the sleeping\r\nperiod he intends to break into the Skylark, learn its control, and\r\nsecure the salt you undoubtedly have in the vessel. Then my party and\r\nmyself will be thrown to the kolon. You and your party will be killed\r\nand your bodies smelted to recover the salt that is in them. This is the\r\nwarning I had to give you. Its urgency explains the use of my untried\r\nmechanical educator; the hope that my party could escape with yours, in\r\nyour vessel, explains why you saw me, the Kofedix of Kondal, prostrate\r\nmyself before that arch-fiend Nalboon.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you, a captive prince of another nation, know these things?\"\r\nasked Crane, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I read Nalboon's ideas from the brain of that officer whom the Karfedix\r\nSeaton killed. He was a ladex of the guards--an officer of about the\r\nsame rank as one of your colonels. He was high in Nalboon's favor, and\r\nhe was to have been in charge of the work of breaking into the Skylark\r\nand killing us all. Let me caution you now; do not let any Mardonalian\r\ntouch our hands with a wire, for if you do, your thoughts will be\r\nrecorded and the secrets of the Skylark and your many other mysterious\r\nthings, such as smoking, matches, and magic feats, will be secrets no\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for the information,\" responded Seaton, \"but I want to correct\r\nyour title for me. I'm no Karfedix--merely a plain citizen.\"\r\n\r\n\"In one way I see that that is true,\" replied the Kofedix with a puzzled\r\nlook. \"I cannot understand your government at all--but the inventor of\r\nthe Skylark must certainly rank as a Karfedix.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a smile of understanding passed over his face and he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"I see. Your title is Doctor of Philosophy, which must mean that you are\r\nthe Karfedix of Knowledge of the Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. You're way off. I'm....\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly Seaton is the Karfedix of Knowledge,\" broke in DuQuesne. \"Let\r\nit go at that, anyway, whatever it means. The thing to do now is to\r\nfigure a way out of this.\"\r\n\r\n\"You chirped it then, Blackie. Dunark, you know this country better than\r\nwe do; what do you suggest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suggest that you take my party into the Skylark and escape from\r\nMardonale as soon as possible. I can pilot you to Kondalek, the capital\r\ncity of our nation. There, I can assure you, you will be welcomed as you\r\ndeserve. My father, the Karfedix, will treat you as a Karfedix should be\r\ntreated. As far as I am concerned, nothing I can ever do will lighten\r\nthe burden of my indebtedness to you, but I promise you all the copper\r\nyou want, and anything else you may desire that is within the power of\r\nman to give you.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeaton thought deeply a moment, then shook Dunark's hand vigorously.\r\n\r\n\"That suits me, Kofedix,\" he said warmly. \"I thought from the first that\r\nyou were our friend. Shall we make for the Skylark right now, or wait a\r\nwhile?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better wait until after the second meal,\" the prince replied.\r\n\"We have no armor, and no way of making any. We would be helpless\r\nagainst the bullets of any except a group small enough so that you could\r\nkill them all before they could fire. The kam after the second meal is\r\ndevoted to strolling about the grounds, so that our visiting the Skylark\r\nwould look perfectly natural. As the guard is very lax at that time, it\r\nis the best time for the attempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about my killing his company of guards and blowing up one wing\r\nof his palace? Won't he have something to say about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied the Kofedix doubtfully. \"It depends upon whether\r\nhis fear of you or his anger is the greater. He should pay his call of\r\nstate here in your apartment in a short time, as it is the inviolable\r\nrule of Osnome, that any visitor shall receive a call of state from one\r\nof his own rank before leaving his apartment for the first time. His\r\nactions may give you some idea as to his feelings, though he is an\r\naccomplished diplomat and may conceal his real feelings entirely. But\r\nlet me caution you not to be modest or soft-spoken. He will mistake\r\nsoftness for fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" grinned Seaton. \"In that case I won't wait to try to find\r\nout what he thinks. If he shows any signs of hostility at all, I'll open\r\nup on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Crane, calmly, \"if we have some time to spare, we may\r\nas well wait comfortably instead of standing in the middle of the room.\r\nI, for one, have a lot of questions to ask about this new world.\"\r\n\r\nActing upon this suggestion, the party seated themselves upon\r\ncomfortable divans, and Dunark rapidly dismantled the machine he had\r\nconstructed. The captives remained standing, always behind the visitors\r\nuntil Seaton remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"Please sit down, everybody. There's no need of keeping up this farce of\r\nyour being slaves as long as we're alone, is there, Dunark?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but at the first sound of the gong announcing a visitor we must be\r\nin our places. Now that we are all comfortable and waiting, I will\r\nintroduce my party to yours.\r\n\r\n\"Fellow Kondalians, greet the Karfedo Seaton and Crane,\" he began, his\r\ntongue fumbling over the strange names, \"of a distant world, the Earth,\r\nand the two noble ladies, Miss Vaneman and Miss Spencer, soon to be\r\ntheir Karfediro.\r\n\r\n\"Guests from Earth, allow me to present to you the Kofedir Sitar, the\r\nonly one of my wives who accompanied me upon our ill-fated hunting\r\nexpedition.\"\r\n\r\nThen, still ignoring DuQuesne as a captive, he introduced the other\r\nKondolians in turn as his brothers, sisters, cousins, nieces, and\r\nnephews--all members of the great ruling house of Kondal.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he concluded, \"after I have a word with you in private, Doctor\r\nSeaton, I will be glad to give the others all the information in my\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\nHe led Seaton out of earshot of the others and said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"It is no part of Nalboon's plan to kill the two women. They are so\r\nbeautiful, so different from our Osnomian women, that he intends to keep\r\nthem--alive. Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" returned Seaton grimly, his eyes turning hard, \"I get you all\r\nright--but what he'll do and what he thinks he'll do are two entirely\r\ndifferent breeds of cats.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to the others, they found Dorothy and Sitar deep in\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"So a man has half a dozen or so wives?\" Dorothy was asking in surprise.\r\n\"How do you get along together? I'd fight like a wildcat if my husband\r\ntried to have other wives!\"\r\n\r\n\"We get along splendidly, of course,\" returned the Osnomian princess in\r\nequal surprise. \"I would not think of being a man's only wife. I\r\nwouldn't consider marrying a man who could win only one wife--think what\r\na disgrace it would be! And think how lonely one would be while her\r\nhusband is away at war--we would go insane if we did not have the\r\ncompany of the other wives. There are six of us, and we could not get\r\nalong at all without each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got a compliment for you and Peggy, Dottie,\" said Seaton. \"Dunark\r\nhere thinks that you two girls look good enough to eat--or words to that\r\neffect.\" Both girls flushed slightly, the purplish-black color suffusing\r\ntheir faces. They glanced at each other and Dorothy voiced the thought\r\nof both as she said:\r\n\r\n\"How can you, Kofedix Dunark? In this horrible light we both look\r\nperfectly dreadful. These other girls would be beautiful, if we were\r\nused to the colors, but we two look simply hideous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" interrupted Sitar. \"You have a wonderfully rich coloring. It\r\nis a shame to hide so much of yourselves with robes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their eyes interpret colors differently than ours do,\" explained\r\nSeaton. \"What to us are harsh and discordant colors are light and\r\npleasing to their eyes. What looks like a kind of sloppy greenish black\r\nto us may--in fact, does--look a pale pink to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are Kondal and Mardonale the only two nations upon Osnome?\" asked\r\nCrane.\r\n\r\n\"The only civilized nations, yes. Osnome is divided into two great and\r\nalmost equal continents, separated by a wide ocean which encircles the\r\nglobe. One is Kondal, the other Mardonale. Each nation has several\r\nnations or tribes of savages, which inhabit various waste places.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You are the light race, Mardonale the dark,\" continued Crane. \"What are\r\nthe servants, who seem half-way between?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are slaves....\"\r\n\r\n\"Captured savages?\" interrupted Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"No. They are a separate race. They are a race so low in intelligence\r\nthat they cannot exist except as slaves, but they can be trained to\r\nunderstand language and to do certain kinds of work. They are harmless\r\nand mild, making excellent servants, otherwise they would have perished\r\nages ago. All menial work and most of the manual labor is done by the\r\nslave race. Formerly criminals were sterilized and reduced to unwilling\r\nslavery, but there have been no unwilling slaves in Kondal for hundreds\r\nof karkamo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Are there no criminals any more?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. With the invention of the thought recorder an absolutely fair trial\r\nwas assured and the guilty were all convicted. They could not reproduce\r\nthemselves, and as a natural result crime died out.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is,\" he added hastily, \"what we regard as crime. Duelling, for\r\ninstance, is a crime upon Earth; here it is a regular custom. In Kondal\r\nduels are rather rare and are held only when honor is involved, but here\r\nin Mardonale they are an every-day affair, as you saw when you landed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes the difference?\" asked Dorothy curiously.\r\n\r\n\"As you know, with us every man is a soldier. In Kondal we train our\r\nyouth in courage, valor, and high honor--in Mardonale they train them in\r\nsavage blood-thirstiness alone. Each nation fixed its policy in bygone\r\nages to produce the type of soldier it thought most efficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"I notice that everyone here wears those heavy collars,\" said Margaret.\r\n\"What are they for?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are identification marks. When a child is nearly grown, a collar\r\nbearing his name and the device of his house is cast about his neck.\r\nThis collar is made of 'arenak,' a synthetic metal which, once formed,\r\ncannot be altered by any usual means. It cannot be scratched, cut, bent,\r\nbroken, or worked in any way except at such a high temperature that\r\ndeath would result, if such heat were applied to the collar. Once the\r\narenak collar is cast about a person's neck he is identified for life,\r\nand any adult Osnomian not wearing a collar is put to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must be an interesting metal,\" remarked Crane. \"Is your belt a\r\nsimilar mark?\"\r\n\r\n\"This belt is an idea of my own,\" and Dunark smiled broadly. \"It looks\r\nlike opaque arenak, but isn't. It is merely a pouch in which I carry\r\nanything I am particularly interested in. Even Nalboon thought it was\r\narenak, so he didn't trouble to try to open it. If he had opened it and\r\ntaken my tools and instruments, I couldn't have built the educator.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that transparent armor arenak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the only difference being that nothing is added to the matrix to\r\ncolor or make opaque the finished metal. It is in the preparation of\r\nthis metal that salt is indispensable. It acts only as a catalyst, being\r\nrecovered afterward, but neither nation has ever had enough salt to make\r\nall the armor they want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't those monsters--karlono, I think you called them--covered by the\r\nsame thing? And what are those animals, anyway?\" Dorothy asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are armored with arenak, and it is thought that the beasts\r\ngrow it, the same as fishes grow scales. The karlono are the most\r\nfrightful scourge of Osnome. Very little is known of them, though every\r\nscientist has theorized upon them since time immemorial. It is very\r\nseldom that one is ever killed, as they easily outfly our swiftest\r\nbattleships, and only fight when they can be victorious. To kill one\r\nrequires a succession of the heaviest high-explosive shells in the same\r\nspot, a joint in the armor; and after the armor is once penetrated, the\r\nanimal is blown into such small fragments that reconstruction is\r\nimpossible. From such remains it has been variously described as a bird,\r\na beast, a fish, and a vegetable; sexual, asexual, and hermaphroditic.\r\nIts habitat is unknown, it being variously supposed to live high in the\r\nair, deep in the ocean, and buried in the swamps. Another theory is that\r\nthey live upon one of our satellites, which encounters our belt of\r\natmosphere every karkam. Nothing is certainly known about the monsters\r\nexcept their terrible destructiveness and their insatiable appetites.\r\nOne of them will devour five or six airships at one time, absorbing the\r\ncrews and devouring the cargo and all of the vessels except the very\r\nhardest of the metal parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they usually go in groups?\" asked Crane. \"If they do, I should think\r\nthat a fleet of warships would be necessary for every party.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they are almost always found alone. Only very rarely are two found\r\ntogether. This is the first time in history that more than two have ever\r\nbeen seen together. Two battleships can always defeat one karlon, so\r\nthey are never attacked. With four battleships Nalboon considered his\r\nexpedition perfectly safe, especially as they are now rare. The navies\r\nhunted down and killed what was supposed to be the last one upon Osnome\r\nmore than a karkam ago, and none have been seen since, until we were\r\nattacked....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe gong over the door sounded and the Kondalians leaped to their\r\npositions back of the Earthly visitors. The Kofedix went to the door.\r\nNalboon brushed him aside and entered, escorted by a full company of\r\nheavily-armed soldiery. A scowl of anger was upon his face and he was\r\nplainly in an ugly mood.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, Nalboon of Mardonale!\" thundered Seaton in the Mardonalian tongue\r\nand with the full power of his mighty voice. \"Dare you invade my privacy\r\nunannounced and without invitation?\"\r\n\r\nThe escort shrank back, but the Domak stood his ground, although he was\r\nplainly taken aback. With an apparent effort he smoothed his face into\r\nlines of cordiality.\r\n\r\n\"I merely came to inquire why my guards are slain and my palace\r\ndestroyed by my honored guest?\"\r\n\r\n\"As for slaying your guards, they sought to invade my privacy. I warned\r\nthem away, but one of them was foolish enough to try to kill me. Then\r\nthe others attempted to raise their childish rifles against me, and I\r\nwas obliged to destroy them. As for the wall, it happened to be in the\r\nway of the thought-waves I hurled against your guards--consequently it\r\nwas demolished. An honored guest! Bah! Are honored guests put to the\r\nindignity of being touched by the filthy hands of a mere ladex?\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not object to the touch of slaves!\" with a wave of his hand\r\ntoward the Kondalians.\r\n\r\n\"That is what slaves are for,\" coldly. \"Is a Domak to wait upon himself\r\nin the court of Mardonale? But to return to the issue. Were I an honored\r\nguest this would never have happened. Know, Nalboon, that when you\r\nattempt to treat a visiting Domak of MY race as a low-born captive, you\r\nmust be prepared to suffer the consequences of your rashness!\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask how you, so recently ignorant, know our language?\"\r\n\r\n\"You question me? That is bold! Know that I, the Boss of the Road, show\r\nignorance or knowledge, when and where I please. You may go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nThe Escape from Mardonale\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That was a wonderful bluff, Dick!\" exclaimed the Kofedix in English as\r\nsoon as Nalboon and his guards had disappeared. \"That was exactly the\r\ntone to take with him, too--you've sure got him guessing!\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to get him, all right, but I'm wondering how long it'll hold\r\nhim. I think we'd better make a dash for the Skylark right now, before\r\nhe has time to think it over, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is undoubtedly the best way,\" Dunark replied, lapsing into his own\r\ntongue. \"Nalboon is plainly in awe of you now, but if I understand him\r\nat all, he is more than ever determined to seize your vessel, and every\r\ndarkam's delay is dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earth-people quickly secured the few personal belongings they had\r\nbrought with them. Stepping out into the hall and waving away the\r\nguards, Seaton motioned Dunark to lead the way. The other captives fell\r\nin behind, as they had done before, and the party walked boldly toward\r\nthe door of the palace. The guards offered no opposition, but stood at\r\nattention and saluted as they passed. As they approached the entrance,\r\nhowever, Seaton saw the major-domo hurrying away and surmised that he\r\nwas carrying the news to Nalboon. Outside the door, walking directly\r\ntoward the landing dock, Dunark spoke in a low voice to Seaton, without\r\nturning.\r\n\r\n\"Nalboon knows by this time that we are making our escape, and it will\r\nbe war to the death from here to the Skylark. I do not think there will\r\nbe any pursuit from the palace, but he has warned the officers in charge\r\nof the dock and they will try to kill us as soon as we step out of the\r\nelevator, perhaps sooner. Nalboon intended to wait, but we have forced\r\nhis hand and the dock is undoubtedly swarming with soldiers now. Shoot\r\nfirst and oftenest. Shoot first and think afterward. Show no mercy, as\r\nyou will receive none--remember that the quality you call 'mercy' does\r\nnot exist upon Osnome.\"\r\n\r\nRounding a great metal statue about fifty feet from the base of the\r\ntowering dock, they saw that the door leading into one of the elevators\r\nwas wide open and that two guards stood just inside it. As they caught\r\nsight of the approaching party, the guards raised their rifles; but,\r\nquick as they were, Seaton was quicker. At the first sight of the open\r\ndoor he had made two quick steps and had hurled himself across the\r\nintervening forty feet in a long football plunge. Before the two guards\r\ncould straighten, he crashed into them, his great momentum hurling them\r\nacross the elevator cage and crushing them into unconsciousness against\r\nits metal wall.\r\n\r\n\"Good work!\" said Dunark, as he preceded the others into the elevator,\r\nand, after receiving Seaton's permission, distributed the weapons of the\r\ntwo guards among the men of his party. \"Now we can surprise those upon\r\nthe roof. That was why you didn't shoot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was afraid to risk a shot--it would give the whole thing away,\"\r\nSeaton replied, as he threw the unconscious guards out into the grounds\r\nand closed the massive door.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to kill them?\" asked Sitar, amazement in every feature\r\nand a puzzled expression in her splendid eyes. A murmur arose from the\r\nother Kondalians, which was quickly silenced by the Kofedix.\r\n\r\n\"It is dishonorable for a soldier of Earth to kill a helpless prisoner,\"\r\nhe said briefly. \"We cannot understand it, but we must not attempt to\r\nsway him in any point of honor.\"\r\n\r\nDunark stepped to the controls and the elevator shot upward, stopping at\r\na landing several stories below the top of the dock. He took a peculiar\r\ndevice from his belt and fitted it over the muzzle of his strange\r\npistol.\r\n\r\n\"We will get out here,\" he instructed the others, \"and go up the rest of\r\nthe way by a little-used flight of stairs. We will probably encounter\r\nsome few guards, but I can dispose of them without raising an alarm. You\r\nwill all stay behind me, please.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton remonstrated, and Dunark went on:\r\n\r\n\"No, Seaton, you have done your share, and more. I am upon familiar\r\nground now, and can do the work alone better than if you were to help\r\nme. I will call upon you, however, before we reach the dock.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kofedix led the way, his pistol resting lightly against his hip, and\r\nat the first turn of the corridor they came full upon four guards. The\r\npistol did not move from its place at the side of the leader, but there\r\nwere four subdued clicks and the four guards dropped dead, with bullets\r\nthrough their brains.\r\n\r\n\"Seaton, that is _some_ silencer,\" whispered DuQuesne. \"I didn't suppose\r\na silencer could work that fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't use powder,\" Seaton replied absently, all his faculties\r\ndirected toward the next corner. \"The bullets are propelled by an\r\nelectrical charge.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same manner Dunark disposed of several more guards before the\r\nlast stairway was reached.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Seaton,\" he whispered in English, \"now is the time we need your rapid\r\npistol-work and your high-explosive shells. There must be hundreds of\r\nsoldiers on the other side of that door, armed with machine-cannon\r\nshooting high-explosive shells at the rate of a thousand per minute. Our\r\nchance is this--their guns are probably trained upon the elevators and\r\nmain stairways, since this passage is unused and none of us would be\r\nexpected to know of it. Most of them don't know of it themselves. It\r\nwill take them a second or two to bring their guns to bear upon us. We\r\nmust do all the damage we can--kill them all, if possible--in that\r\nsecond or two. If Crane will lend me a pistol, we'll make the rush\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've a better scheme than that,\" interrupted DuQuesne. \"Next to you,\r\nSeaton, I'm the fastest man with a gun here. Also, like you, I can use\r\nboth hands at once. Give me a couple of clips of those special\r\ncartridges and you and I will blow that bunch into the air before they\r\nknow we're here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the two pistol experts should take the lead, closely\r\nfollowed by Crane and Dunark. The weapons were loaded to capacity and\r\nput in readiness for instant use.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go, bunch!\" said Seaton. \"The quicker we start the quicker we'll\r\nget back. Get ready to run out there, all the rest of you, as soon as\r\nthe battle's over. Ready? On your marks--get set--go!\"\r\n\r\nHe kicked the door open and there was a stuttering crash as the four\r\nautomatic pistols simultaneously burst into practically continuous\r\nflame--a crash obliterated by an overwhelming concussion of sound as the\r\nX-plosive shells, sweeping the entire roof with a rapidly-opening fan of\r\ndeath, struck their marks and exploded. Well it was for the little group\r\nof wanderers that the two men in the door were past masters in the art\r\nof handling their weapons; well it was that they had in their tiny\r\npistol-bullets the explosive force of hundreds of giant shells! For rank\r\nupon rank of soldiery were massed upon the roof; rapid-fire cannon,\r\nterrible engines of destruction, were pointing toward the elevators and\r\ntoward the main stairways and approaches. But so rapid and fierce was\r\nthe attack, that even those trained gunners had no time to point their\r\nguns. The battle lasted little more than a second, being over before\r\neither Crane or Dunark could fire a shot, and silence again reigned even\r\nwhile broken and shattered remnants of the guns and fragments of the\r\nmetal and stone of the dock were still falling to the ground through a\r\nfine mist of what had once been men.\r\n\r\nAssured by a rapid glance that not a single Mardonalian remained upon\r\nthe dock, Seaton turned back to the others.\r\n\r\n\"Make it snappy, bunch! This is going to be a mighty unhealthy spot for\r\nus in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy threw her arms around his neck in relief. With one arm about\r\nher, he hastily led the way across the dock toward the Skylark, choosing\r\nthe path with care because of the yawning holes blown into the structure\r\nby the terrific force of the explosions. The Skylark was still in place,\r\nheld immovable by the attractor, but what a sight she was! Her crystal\r\nwindows were shattered; her mighty plates of four-foot Norwegian armor\r\nwere bent and cracked and twisted; two of her doors, warped and\r\nbattered, hung awry from their broken hinges. Not a shell had struck\r\nher: all this damage had been done by flying fragments of the guns and\r\nof the dock itself; and Seaton and Crane, who had developed the new\r\nexplosive, stood aghast at its awful power.\r\n\r\nThey hastily climbed into the vessel, and Seaton assured himself that\r\nthe controls were uninjured.\r\n\r\n\"I hear battleships,\" Dunark said. \"Is it permitted that I operate one\r\nof your machine guns?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go as far as you like,\" responded Seaton, as he placed the women\r\nbeneath the copper bar--the safest place in the vessel--and leaped to\r\nthe instrument board. Before he reached it, and while DuQuesne, Crane,\r\nand Dunark were hastening to the guns, the whine of giant\r\nhelicopter-screws was plainly heard. A ranging shell from the first\r\nwarship, sighted a little low, exploded against the side of the dock\r\nbeneath them. He reached the levers just as the second shell screamed\r\nthrough the air a bare four feet above them. As he shot the Skylark into\r\nthe air under five notches of power, a steady stream of the huge bombs\r\npoured through the spot where, an instant before, the vessel had been.\r\nCrane and DuQuesne aimed several shots at the battleships, which were\r\napproaching from all sides, but the range was so extreme that no damage\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nThey heard the continuous chattering of the machine gun operated by the\r\nKofedix, however, and turned toward him. He was shooting, not at the\r\nwarships, but at the city rapidly growing smaller beneath them; moving\r\nthe barrel of the rifle in a tiny spiral; spraying the entire city with\r\ndeath and destruction! As they looked, the first of the shells reached\r\nthe ground, just as Dunark ceased firing for lack of ammunition. They\r\nsaw the palace disappear as if by magic, being instantly blotted out in\r\na cloud of dust--a cloud which, with a spiral motion of dizzying\r\nrapidity, increased in size until it obscured the entire city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving attained sufficient altitude to be safe from any possible pursuit\r\nand out of range of even the heaviest guns, Seaton stopped the vessel\r\nand went out into the main compartment to consult with the other\r\nmembers of the group, about their next move.\r\n\r\n\"It sure does feel good to get a breath of cool air, folks,\" he said, as\r\nhe drew with relief a deep breath of the air, which, at that great\r\nelevation, was of an icy temperature and very thin. He glanced at the\r\nlittle group of Kondalians as he spoke, then leaped back to the\r\ninstrument board with an apology on his lips--they were gasping for\r\nbreath and shivering with the cold. He switched on the heating coils and\r\ndropped the Skylark rapidly in a long descent toward the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"If that is the temperature you enjoy, I understand at last why you wear\r\nclothes,\" said the Kofedix, as soon as he could talk.\r\n\r\n\"Do not your planes fly up into the regions of low temperature?\" asked\r\nCrane.\r\n\r\n\"Only occasionally, and all high-flying vessels are enclosed and heated\r\nto our normal temperature. We have heavy wraps, but we dislike to wear\r\nthem so intensely that we never subject ourselves to any cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's no accounting for tastes,\" returned Seaton, \"but I can't\r\nhand your climate a thing. It's hotter even than Washington in August;\r\n'and that,' as the poet feelingly remarked, 'is going some!'\r\n\r\n\"But there's no reason for sitting here in the dark,\" he continued, as\r\nhe switched on the powerful daylight lamps which lighted the vessel with\r\nthe nearest approach to sunlight possible to produce. As soon as the\r\nlights were on, Dorothy looked intently at the strange women.\r\n\r\n\"Now we can see what color they really are,\" she explained to her lover\r\nin a low voice. \"Why, they aren't so very different from what they were\r\nbefore, except that the colors are much softer and more pleasing. They\r\nreally are beautiful, in spite of being green. Don't you think so,\r\nDick?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're a handsome bunch, all right,\" he agreed, and they were. Their\r\nskins were a light, soft green, tanned to an olive shade by their many\r\nfervent suns. Their teeth were a brilliant and shining grass-green.\r\nTheir eyes and their long, thick hair were a glossy black.\r\n\r\nThe Kondalians looked at the Earthly visitors and at each other, and the\r\nwomen uttered exclamations of horror.\r\n\r\n\"What a frightful light?\" exclaimed Sitar. \"Please shut it off. I would\r\nrather be in total darkness than look like this!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Sitar?\" asked the puzzled Dorothy as Seaton turned\r\noff the lights. \"You look perfectly stunning in this light.\"\r\n\r\n\"They see things differently than we do,\" explained Seaton. \"Their optic\r\nnerves react differently than ours do. While we look all right to them,\r\nand they look all right to us, in both kinds of light, they look just as\r\ndifferent to themselves under our daylight lamps as we do to ourselves\r\nin their green light. Is that explanation clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's clear enough as far as it goes, but what do they look like to\r\nthemselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's too deep for me--I can't explain it, any better than you can.\r\nTake the Osnomian color 'mlap,' for instance. Can you describe it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a kind of greenish orange--but it seems as though it ought not to\r\nlook like that color either.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, exactly. From the knowledge you received from the educator,\r\nit should be a brilliant purple. That is due to the difference in the\r\noptic nerves, which explains why we see things so differently from the\r\nway the Osnomians do. Perhaps they can describe the way they look to\r\neach other in our white light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you, Sitar?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"One word describes it--'horrible.'\" replied the Kondalian princess, and\r\nher husband added:\r\n\r\n\"The colors are distorted and unrecognizable, just as your colors are to\r\nyour eyes in our light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now that the color question is answered, let's get going. I\r\npretty nearly asked you the way, Dunark--forgot that I know it as well\r\nas you do.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Skylark set off at as high an altitude as the Osnomians could stand.\r\nAs they neared the ocean several great Mardonalian battleships, warned\r\nof the escape, sought to intercept them; but the Skylark hopped over\r\nthem easily, out of range of their heaviest guns, and flew onward at\r\nsuch speed that pursuit was not even attempted. The ocean was quickly\r\ncrossed. Soon the space-car came to rest over a great city, and Seaton\r\npointed out the palace; which, with its landing dock nearby, was very\r\nsimilar to that of Nalboon, in the capital city of Mardonale.\r\n\r\nCrane drew Seaton to one side.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it is safe to trust these Kondalians, any more than it was\r\nthe others? How would it be to stay in the Lark instead of going into\r\nthe palace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mart, this bunch can be trusted. Dunark has a lot of darn queer\r\nideas, but he's square as a die. He's our friend, and will get us the\r\ncopper. We have no choice now, anyway, look at the bar. We haven't an\r\nounce of copper left--we're down to the plating in spots. Besides, we\r\ncouldn't go anywhere if we had a ton of copper, because the old bus is a\r\nwreck. She won't hold air--you could throw a cat out through the shell\r\nin any direction. She'll have to have a lot of work done on her before\r\nwe can think of leaving. As to staying in her, that wouldn't help us a\r\nbit. Steel is as soft as wood to these folks--their shells would go\r\nthrough her as though she were made of mush. They are made of metal that\r\nis harder than diamond and tougher than rubber, and when they strike\r\nthey bore in like drill-bits. If they are out to get us they'll do it\r\nanyway, whether we're here or there, so we may as well be guests. But\r\nthere's no danger, Mart. You know I swapped brains with him, and I know\r\nhim as well as I know myself. He's a good, square man--one of our kind\r\nof folks.\"\r\n\r\nConvinced, Crane nodded his head and the Skylark dropped toward the\r\ndock. While they were still high in air, Dunark took an instrument from\r\nhis belt and rapidly manipulated a small lever. The others felt the air\r\nvibrate--a peculiar, pulsating wave, which, to the surprise of the\r\nEarthly visitors, they could read without difficulty. It was a message\r\nfrom the Kofedix to the entire city, telling of the escape of his party\r\nand giving the news that he was accompanied by two great Karfedo from\r\nanother world. Then the pulsations became unintelligible, and all knew\r\nthat he had tuned his instrument away from the \"general\" key into the\r\nindividual key of some one person.\r\n\r\n\"I just let my father, the Karfedix, know that we are coming,\" he\r\nexplained, as the vibrations ceased.\r\n\r\nFrom the city beneath them hundreds of great guns roared forth a\r\nwelcome, banners and streamers hung from every possible point, and the\r\nair became tinted and perfumed with a bewildering variety of colors and\r\nscents and quivered with the rush of messages of welcome. The Skylark\r\nwas soon surrounded by a majestic fleet of giant warships, who escorted\r\nher with impressive ceremony to the landing dock, while around them\r\nflitted great numbers of other aircraft. The tiny one-man helicopters\r\ndarted hither and thither, apparently always in imminent danger of\r\ncolliding with some of their larger neighbors, but always escaping as\r\nthough by a miracle. Beautiful pleasure-planes soared and dipped and\r\nwheeled like giant gulls; and, cleaving their stately way through the\r\nnumberless lesser craft; immense multiplane passenger liners partially\r\nsupported by helicopter screws turned aside from their scheduled courses\r\nto pay homage to the Kofedix of Kondal.\r\n\r\nAs the Skylark approached the top of the dock, all the escorting vessels\r\ndropped away and Crane saw that instead of the brilliant assemblage he\r\nhad expected to see upon the landing-place there was only a small group\r\nof persons, as completely unadorned as were those in the car. In answer\r\nto his look of surprise, the Kofedix said, with deep feeling:\r\n\r\n\"My father, mother, and the rest of the family. They know that we, as\r\nescaped captives, would be without harness or trappings, and are meeting\r\nus in the same state.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeaton brought the vessel to the dock near the little group, and the\r\nEarthly visitors remained inside their vessel while the rulers of Kondal\r\nwelcomed the sons and daughters they had given up for dead.\r\n\r\nAfter the affecting reunion, which was very similar to an earthly one\r\nunder similar circumstances, the Kofedix led his father up to the\r\nSkylark and his guests stepped down upon the dock.\r\n\r\n\"Friends,\" Dunark began, \"I have told you of my father, Roban, the\r\nKarfedix of Kondal. Father, it is a great honor to present to you those\r\nwho rescued us from Mardonale--Seaton, Karfedix of Knowledge; Crane,\r\nKarfedix of Wealth; Miss Vaneman; and Miss Spencer. Karfedix DuQuesne,\"\r\nwaving his hand toward him, \"is a lesser Karfedix of Knowledge, captive\r\nto the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Kofedix Dunark exaggerates our services,\" deprecated Seaton, \"and\r\ndoesn't mention the fact that he saved all our lives. But for him we all\r\nshould have been killed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Karfedix, disregarding Seaton's remark, acknowledged the\r\nindebtedness of Kondal in heartfelt accents before he led them back to\r\nthe other party and made the introductions. As all walked toward the\r\nelevators, the emperor turned to his son with a puzzled expression.\r\n\r\n\"I know from your message, Dunark, that our guests are from a distant\r\nsolar system, and I can understand your accident with the educator, but\r\nI cannot understand the titles of these men. Knowledge and wealth are\r\nnot ruled over. Are you sure that you have translated their titles\r\ncorrectly?\"\r\n\r\n\"As correctly as I can--we have no words in our language to express the\r\nmeaning. Their government is a most peculiar one, the rulers all being\r\nchosen by the people of the whole nation....\"\r\n\r\n\"Extraordinary!\" interjected the older man. \"How, then, can anything be\r\naccomplished?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand the thing myself, it is so utterly unheard-of. But\r\nthey have no royalty, as we understand the term. In America, their\r\ncountry, every man is equal.\r\n\r\n\"That is,\" he hastened to correct himself, \"they are not all equal,\r\neither, as they have two classes which would rank with royalty--those\r\nwho have attained to great heights of knowledge and those who have\r\namassed great wealth. This explanation is entirely inadequate and does\r\nnot give the right idea of their positions, but it is as close as I can\r\ncome to the truth in our language.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am surprised that you should be carrying a prisoner with you,\r\nKarfedo,\" said Roban, addressing Seaton and Crane. \"You will, of course,\r\nbe at perfect liberty to put him to death in any way that pleases you,\r\njust as though you were in your own kingdoms. But perchance you are\r\nsaving him so that his death will crown your home-coming?\"\r\n\r\nThe Kofedix spoke in answer while Seaton, usually so quick to speak, was\r\ngroping for words.\r\n\r\n\"No, father, he is not to be put to death. That is another peculiar\r\ncustom of the Earth-men; they consider it dishonorable to harm a\r\ncaptive, or even an unarmed enemy. For that reason we must treat the\r\nKarfedix DuQuesne with every courtesy due his rank, but at the same time\r\nhe is to be allowed to do only such things as may be permitted by Seaton\r\nand Crane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet they do not seem to be a weak race,\" mused the older man.\r\n\r\n\"They are a mighty race, far advanced in evolution,\" replied his son.\r\n\"It is not weakness, but a peculiar moral code. We have many things to\r\nlearn from them, and but few to give them in return. Their visit will\r\nmean much to Kondal.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation they had descended to the ground and had\r\nreached the palace, after traversing grounds even more sumptuous and\r\nsplendid than those surrounding the palace of Nalboon. Inside the palace\r\nwalls the Kofedix himself led the guests to their rooms, accompanied by\r\nthe major-domo and an escort of guards. He explained to them that the\r\nrooms were all inter-communicating, each having a completely equipped\r\nbathroom.\r\n\r\n\"Complete except for cold water, you mean,\" said Seaton with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"There is cold water,\" rejoined the other, leading him into the bathroom\r\nand releasing a ten-inch stream of lukewarm water into the small\r\nswimming pool, built of polished metal, which forms part of every\r\nKondalian bathroom. \"But I am forgetting that you like extreme cold. We\r\nwill install refrigerating machines at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do it--thanks just the same. We won't be here long enough to make\r\nit worth while.\"\r\n\r\nDunark smilingly replied that he would make his guests as comfortable as\r\nhe could, and after informing them that in one kam he would return and\r\nescort them in to koprat, took his leave. Scarcely had the guests\r\nfreshened themselves when he was back, but he was no longer the Dunark\r\nthey had known. He now wore a metal-and-leather harness which was one\r\nblaze of precious gems, and a leather belt hung with jeweled weapons\r\nreplaced the familiar hollow girdle of metal. His right arm, between the\r\nwrist and the elbow, was almost covered by six bracelets of a\r\ntransparent metal, deep cobalt-blue in color, each set with an\r\nincredibly brilliant stone of the same shade. On his left wrist he wore\r\nan Osnomian chronometer. This was an instrument resembling the odometer\r\nof an automobile, whose numerous revolving segments revealed a large and\r\nconstantly increasing number--the date and time of the Osnomian day,\r\nexpressed in a decimal number of the karkamo of Kondalian history.\r\n\r\n\"Greetings, oh guests from Earth! I feel more like myself, now that I am\r\nagain in my trappings and have my weapons at my side. Will you accompany\r\nme to koprat, or are you not hungry?\" as he attached the peculiar\r\ntimepieces to the wrists of the guests, with bracelets of the deep-blue\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\n\"We accept with thanks,\" replied Dorothy promptly. \"We're starving to\r\ndeath, as usual.\"\r\n\r\nAs they walked toward the dining hall, Dunark noticed that Dorothy's\r\neyes strayed toward his bracelets, and he answered her unasked question:\r\n\r\n\"These are our wedding rings. Man and wife exchange bracelets as part of\r\nthe ceremony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you can tell whether a man is married or not, and how many wives\r\nhe has, simply by looking at his arm? We should have something like that\r\non Earth, Dick--then married men wouldn't find it so easy to pose as\r\nbachelors!\"\r\n\r\nRoban met them at the door of the great dining hall. He also was in full\r\npanoply, and Dorothy counted ten of the heavy bracelets upon his right\r\narm as he led them to places near his own. The room was a replica of the\r\nother Osnomian dining hall they had seen and the women were decorated\r\nwith the same barbaric splendor of scintillating gems.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal, which was a happy one, taking the nature of a\r\ncelebration in honor of the return of the captives, DuQuesne went\r\ndirectly to his room while the others spent the time until the zero hour\r\nin strolling about the splendid grounds, always escorted by many guards.\r\nReturning to the room occupied by the two girls, the couples separated,\r\neach girl accompanying her lover to the door of his room.\r\n\r\nMargaret was ill at ease, though trying hard to appear completely\r\nself-possessed.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, sweetheart Peggy?\" asked Crane, solicitously.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know that you....\" she broke off and continued with a rush:\r\n\"What did the Kofedix mean just now, when he called you the Karfedix of\r\nWealth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, I happen to have some money....\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Then you are the great M. Reynolds Crane?\" she interrupted, in\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n\"Leave off 'the great,'\" he said, then, noting her expression, he took\r\nher in his arms and laughed slightly.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all that was bothering you? What does a little money amount to\r\nbetween you and me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing--but I'm awfully glad that I didn't know it before,\" she\r\nreplied, as she returned his caress with fervor. \"That is, it means\r\nnothing if you are perfectly sure I'm not....\"\r\n\r\nCrane, the imperturbable, broke a life-long rule and interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\"Do not say that, dear. You know as well as I do that between you and me\r\nthere never have been, are not now, and never shall be, any doubts or\r\nany questions.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"If I could have a real cold bath now, I'd feel fine,\" remarked Seaton,\r\nstanding in his own door with Dorothy by his side. \"I'm no blooming\r\nEnglishman but in weather as hot as this I sure would like to dive into\r\na good cold tank. How do you feel after all this excitement, Dottie? Up\r\nto standard?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm scared purple,\" she replied, nestling against him, \"or, at least,\r\nif not exactly scared, I'm apprehensive and nervous. I always thought I\r\nhad good nerves, but everything here is so horrible and unreal, that I\r\ncan't help but feel it. When I'm with you I really enjoy the experience,\r\nbut when I'm alone or with Peggy, especially in the sleeping-period,\r\nwhich is so awfully long and when it seems that something terrible is\r\ngoing to happen every minute, my mind goes off in spite of me into\r\nthoughts of what may happen. Why, last night, Peggy and I just huddled\r\nup to each other in a ghastly yellow funk--dreading we knew not\r\nwhat--the two of us slept hardly at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, little girl,\" replied Seaton, embracing her tenderly,\r\n\"sorrier than I can say. I know that your nerves are all right, but you\r\nhaven't roughed it enough, or lived in strange environments enough, to\r\nbe able to feel at home. The reason you feel safer with me is that I\r\nfeel perfectly at home here myself, not that your nerves are going to\r\npieces or anything like that. It won't be for long, though,\r\nsweetheart--as soon as we get the chariot fixed up we'll beat it back to\r\nthe Earth so fast it'll make your head spin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think that's the reason, lover. I hope you won't think I'm a\r\nclinging vine, but I can't help being afraid of something here every\r\ntime I'm away from you. You're so self-reliant, so perfectly at ease\r\nhere, that it makes me feel the same way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly at ease. There's nothing to be afraid of. I've been in\r\nhundreds of worse places, right on Earth. I sure wish I could be with\r\nyou all the time, sweetheart girl--only you can understand just how much\r\nI wish it--but, as I said before, it won't be long until we can be\r\ntogether all the time.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy pushed him into his room, followed him within it, closed the\r\ndoor, and put both hands on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Dick, sweetheart,\" she whispered, while a hot blush suffused her face,\r\n\"you're not as dumb as I thought you were--you're dumber! But if you\r\nsimply won't say it, I will. Don't you know that a marriage that is\r\nlegal where it is performed is legal anywhere, and that no law says that\r\nthe marriage must be performed upon the Earth?\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed her to his heart in a mighty embrace, and his low voice\r\nshowed in every vibration the depth of the feeling he held for the\r\nbeautiful woman in his arms as he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I never thought of that, sweetheart, and I wouldn't have dared mention\r\nit if I had. You're so far away from your family and your friends that\r\nit would seem....\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't seem anything of the kind,\" she broke in earnestly. \"Don't\r\nyou see, you big, dense, wonderful man, that it is the only thing to do?\r\nWe need each other, or at least, I need you, so much now....\"\r\n\r\n\"Say 'each other'; it's right,\" declared her lover with fervor.\r\n\r\n\"It's foolish to wait. Mother would like to have seen me married, of\r\ncourse; but there will be great advantages, even on that side. A grand\r\nwedding, of the kind we would simply have to have in Washington, doesn't\r\nappeal to me any more than it does to you--and it would bore you to\r\nextinction. Dad would hate it, too--it's better all around to be married\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton, who had been trying to speak, silenced her.\r\n\r\n\"I'm convinced, Dottie, have been ever since the first word. If you can\r\nsee it that way I'm so glad that I can't express it. I've been scared\r\nstiff every time I thought of our wedding. I'll speak to the Karfedix\r\nthe first thing in the morning, and we'll be married tomorrow--or rather\r\ntoday, since it is past the zero kam,\" as he glanced at the chronometer\r\nupon his wrist, which, driven by wireless impulses from the master-clock\r\nin the national observatory, was clicking off the darkamo with an almost\r\ninaudible purr of its smoothly-revolving segments.\r\n\r\n\"How would it be to wake him up and have it done now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dick, be reasonable! That would never do. Tomorrow will be most\r\nawfully sudden, as it is! And Dick, please speak to Martin, will you?\r\nPeggy's even more scared than I am, and Martin, the dear old stupid, is\r\neven less likely to suggest such a thing as this kind of a wedding than\r\nyou are. Peggy's afraid to suggest it to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woman!\" he said in mock sternness, \"Is this a put-up job?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly is. Did you think I had nerve enough to do it without\r\nhelp?\"\r\n\r\nSeaton turned and opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"Mart! Bring Peggy over here!\" he called, as he led Dorothy back into\r\nthe girls' room.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, Dick, be careful! You'll spoil the whole thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't. Leave it to me--I bashfully admit that I'm a regular\r\nbear-cat at this diplomatic stuff. Watch my smoke!\"\r\n\r\n\"Folks,\" he said, when the four were together, \"Dottie and I have been\r\ntalking things over, and we've decided that today's the best possible\r\ndate for a wedding. Dottie's afraid of these long, daylight nights, and\r\nI admit that I'd sleep a lot sounder if I knew where she was all the\r\ntime instead of only part of it. She says she's willing, provided you\r\nfolks see it the same way and make it double. How about it?\"\r\n\r\nMargaret blushed furiously and Crane's lean, handsome face assumed a\r\ndarker color as he replied:\r\n\r\n\"A marriage here would, of course, be legal anywhere, provided we have a\r\ncertificate, and we could be married again upon our return if we think\r\nit desirable. It might look as though we were taking an unfair advantage\r\nof the girls, Dick, but considering all the circumstances, I think it\r\nwould be the best thing for everyone concerned.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw the supreme joy in Margaret's eyes, and his own assumed a new\r\nlight as he drew her into the hollow of his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Peggy has known me only a short time, but nothing else in the world is\r\nas certain as our love. It is the bride's privilege to set the date, so\r\nI will only say that it cannot be too soon for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sooner the better,\" said Margaret, with a blush that would have\r\nbeen divine in any earthly light, \"did you say 'today,' Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see the Karfedix as soon as he gets up,\" he answered, and walked\r\nwith Dorothy to his door.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just too supremely happy for words,\" Dorothy whispered in Seaton's\r\near as he bade her good-night. \"I won't be able to sleep or anything!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nAn Osnomian Marriage\r\n\r\n\r\nSeaton awoke, hot and uncomfortable, but with a great surge of joy in\r\nhis heart--this was his wedding day! Springing from the bed, he released\r\nthe full stream of the \"cold\" water, filling the tank in a few moments.\r\nPoising lightly upon the edge, he made a clean, sharp dive, and yelled\r\nin surprise as he came snorting to the surface. For Dunark had made good\r\nhis promise--the water was only a few degrees above the freezing point!\r\nAfter a few minutes of vigorous splashing in the icy water, he rubbed\r\nhimself down with a coarse towel, shaved, threw on his clothes, and\r\nlifted his powerful, but musical, bass voice in the wedding chorus from\r\n\"The Rose Maiden.\"\r\n\r\n    _\"Rise, sweet maid, arise, arise,\r\n    Rise, sweet maid, arise, arise,\r\n    'Tis the last fair morning for thy maiden eyes,\"_\r\n\r\nhe sang lustily, out of his sheer joy in being alive, and was surprised\r\nto hear Dorothy's clear soprano, Margaret's pleasing contralto, and\r\nCrane's mellow tenor chime in from the adjoining room. Crane threw open\r\nthe door and Seaton joined the others.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning. Dick, you sound happy,\" said Crane.\r\n\r\n\"Who wouldn't be? Look what's doing today,\" as he ardently embraced his\r\nbride-to-be. \"Besides, I found some cold water this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone in the palace heard you discovering it,\" dryly returned Crane,\r\nand the girls laughed merrily.\r\n\r\n\"It surprised me at first,\" admitted Seaton, \"but it's great after a\r\nfellow once gets wet.\"\r\n\r\n\"We warmed ours a trifle,\" said Dorothy. \"I like a cold bath myself, but\r\nnot in ice-water.\"\r\n\r\nAll four became silent, thinking of the coming event of the day, until\r\nCrane said:\r\n\r\n\"They have ministers here, I know, and I know something of their\r\nreligion, but my knowledge is rather vague. You know more about it than\r\nwe do, Dick, suppose you tell us about it while we wait.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton paused a moment, with an odd look on his face. As one turning the\r\npages of an unfamiliar book of reference, he was seeking the answer to\r\nCrane's question in the vast store of Osnomian information received from\r\nDunark. His usually ready speech came a little slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, as nearly as I can explain it, it's a funny kind of a\r\nmixture--partly theology, partly Darwinism, or at least, making a fetish\r\nof evolution, and partly pure economic determinism. They believe in a\r\nSupreme Being, whom they call the First Cause--that is the nearest\r\nEnglish equivalent--and they recognize the existence of an immortal and\r\nunknowable life-principle, or soul. They believe that the First Cause\r\nhas decreed the survival of the fittest as the fundamental law, which\r\nbelief accounts for their perfect physiques....\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect physiques? Why, they're as weak as children,\" interrupted\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but that is because of the smallness of the planet,\" returned\r\nSeaton. \"You see, a man of my size weighs only eighty-six pounds here,\r\non a spring balance, so he would need only the muscular development of a\r\nboy of twelve or so. In a contest of strength, either of you girls could\r\neasily handle two of the strongest men upon Osnome. In fact, the average\r\nOsnomian could stand up on our Earth only with the greatest difficulty.\r\nBut that isn't the fault of the people; they are magnificently developed\r\nfor their surroundings. They have attained this condition by centuries\r\nof weeding out the unfit. They have no hospitals for the feeble-minded\r\nor feeble-bodied--abnormal persons are not allowed to live. The same\r\nreasoning accounts for their perfect cleanliness, moral and physical.\r\nVice is practically unknown. They believe that clean living and clean\r\nthinking are rewarded by the production of a better physical and mental\r\ntype....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, especially as they correct wrong living by those terrible\r\npunishments the Kofedix told us about,\" interrupted Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"That probably helps some. They also believe that the higher the type\r\nis, the faster will evolution proceed, and the sooner will mankind reach\r\nwhat they call the Ultimate Goal, and know all things. Believing as they\r\ndo that the fittest must survive, and thinking themselves, of course,\r\nthe superior type, it is ordained that Mardonale must be destroyed\r\nutterly, root and branch. They believe that the slaves are so low in the\r\nscale, millions of years behind in evolution, that they do not count.\r\nSlaves are simply intelligent and docile animals, little more than\r\nhorses or oxen. Mardonalians and savages are unfit to survive and must\r\nbe exterminated.\r\n\r\n\"Their ministers are chosen from the very fittest. They are the\r\nstrongest, cleanest-living, and most vigorous men of this clean and\r\nvigorous nation, and are usually high army officers as well as\r\nministers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn attendant announced the coming of the Karfedix and his son, to pay\r\nthe call of state. After the ceremonious greetings had been exchanged,\r\nall went into the dining hall for darprat. As soon as the meal was over,\r\nSeaton brought up the question of the double wedding that kokam, and the\r\nKarfedix was overjoyed.\r\n\r\n\"Karfedix Seaton,\" he said earnestly, \"nothing could please us more than\r\nto have such a ceremony performed in our palace. Marriage between such\r\nhighly-evolved persons as are you four is wished by the First Cause,\r\nwhose servants we are. Aside from that, it is an unheard-of honor for\r\nany ruler to have even one karfedix married beneath his roof, and you\r\nare granting me the privilege of two! I thank you, and assure you that\r\nwe will do our poor best to make the occasion memorable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do anything fancy,\" said Seaton hastily. \"A simple, plain wedding\r\nwill do.\"\r\n\r\nUnheeding Seaton's remark, the Karfedix took his wireless from its hook\r\nat his belt and sent a brief message.\r\n\r\n\"I have summoned Karbix Tarnan to perform the ceremony. Our usual time\r\nfor ceremonies is just before koprat--is that time satisfactory to you?\"\r\n\r\nAssured that it was, he turned to his son.\r\n\r\n\"Dunark, you are more familiar than I with the customs of our\r\nillustrious visitors. May I ask you to take charge of the details?\"\r\n\r\nWhile Dunark sent a rapid succession of messages, Dorothy whispered to\r\nSeaton:\r\n\r\n\"They must be going to make a real function of our double wedding, Dick.\r\nThe Karbix is the highest dignitary of the church, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in addition to being the Commander-in-Chief of all the Kondalian\r\narmies. Next to the Karfedix he is the most powerful man in the empire.\r\nSomething tells me, Dottie, that this is going to be SOME ceremony!\"\r\n\r\nAs Dunark finished telegraphing, Seaton turned to him.\r\n\r\n\"Dorothy said, a while ago, that she would like to have enough of that\r\ntapestry-fabric for a dress. Do you suppose it could be managed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. In all state ceremonials we always wear robes made out of\r\nthe same fabric as the tapestries, but much finer and more delicate. I\r\nwould have suggested it, but thought perhaps the ladies would prefer\r\ntheir usual clothing. I know that you two men do not care to wear our\r\nrobes?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will wear white ducks, the dressiest and coolest things we have\r\nalong,\" replied Seaton. \"Thank you for your offer, but you know how it\r\nis. We should feel out of place in such gorgeous dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. I will call in a few of our most expert robe-makers, who\r\nwill weave the gowns. Before they come, let us decide upon the ceremony.\r\nI think you are familiar with our marriage customs, but I will explain\r\nthem to make sure. Each couple is married twice. The first marriage is\r\nsymbolized by the exchange of plain bracelets and lasts four karkamo,\r\nduring which period divorce may be obtained at will. The children of\r\nsuch divorced couples formerly became wards of the state, but in my\r\nlifetime I have not heard of there being any such children--all divorces\r\nare now between couples who discover their incompatibility before\r\nchildren are conceived.\"\r\n\r\n\"That surprises me greatly,\" said Crane. \"Some system of trial-marriage\r\nis advocated among us on Earth every few years, but they all so surely\r\ndegenerate into free love that no such system has found a foothold.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not troubled in that way at all. You see, before the first\r\nmarriage, each couple, from the humblest peasantry to the highest\r\nroyalty, must submit to a mental examination. If they are marrying for\r\nany reason at all other than love, such as any thought of trifling in\r\nthe mind of the man, or if the woman is marrying him for his wealth or\r\nposition, he or she is summarily executed, regardless of station.\"\r\n\r\nNo other questions being asked, Dunark continued:\r\n\r\n\"At the end of four karkamo the second marriage is performed, which is\r\nindissoluble. In this ceremony jeweled bracelets are substituted for the\r\nplain ones. In the case of highly-evolved persons it is permitted that\r\nthe two ceremonies be combined into one. Then there is a third ceremony,\r\nused only in the marriage of persons of the very highest evolution, in\r\nwhich the 'eternal' vows are taken and the faidon, the eternal jewel, is\r\nexchanged. As you are all in the permitted class, you may use the\r\neternal ceremony if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we all know our minds well enough to know that we want to be\r\nmarried for good--the longer the better,\" said Seaton, positively.\r\n\"We'll make it the eternal, won't we, folks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to ask one question,\" said Crane, thoughtfully. \"Does\r\nthat ceremony imply that my wife would be breaking her vows if she\r\nmarried again upon my death?\"\r\n\r\n\"Far from it. Numbers of our men are killed every karkam. Their wives,\r\nif of marriageable age, are expected to marry again. Then, too, you know\r\nthat most Kondalian men have several wives. No matter how many wives or\r\nhusbands may be linked together in that way, it merely means that after\r\ndeath their spirits will be grouped into one. Just as in your\r\nchemistry,\" smiling in comradely fashion at Seaton, \"a varying number of\r\nelements may unite to form a stable compound.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause, the speaker went on:\r\n\r\n\"Since you are from the Earth and unaccustomed to bracelets, rings will\r\nbe substituted for them. The plain rings will take the place of your\r\nEarthly wedding rings, the jeweled ones that of your engagement rings.\r\nThe only difference is that while we discard the plain bracelets, you\r\nwill continue to wear them. Have you men any objections to wearing the\r\nrings during the ceremony? You may discard them later if you wish and\r\nstill keep the marriage valid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I! I'll wear mine all my life,\" responded Seaton earnestly, and\r\nCrane expressed the same thought.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one more thing,\" added the Kofedix. \"That is, about the\r\nmental examination. Since it is not your custom, it is probable that the\r\njustices would waive the ruling, especially since everyone must be\r\nexamined by a jury of his own or a superior rank, so that only one man,\r\nmy father alone, could examine you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in a thousand years!\" replied Seaton emphatically. \"I want to be\r\nexamined, and have Dorothy see the record. I don't care about having her\r\nput through it, but I want her to know exactly the kind of a guy she is\r\ngetting.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy protested at this, but as all four were eager that they\r\nthemselves should be tested, the Karfedix was notified and Dunark\r\nclamped sets of multiple electrodes, connected to a set of instruments,\r\nupon the temples of his father, Dorothy, and Seaton. He pressed a lever,\r\nand instantly Dorothy and Seaton read each other's minds to the minutest\r\ndetail, and each knew that the Karfedix was reading the minds of both.\r\n\r\nAfter Margaret and Crane had been examined, the Karfedix expressed\r\nhimself as more than satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"You are all of the highest evolution and your minds are all untainted\r\nby any base thoughts in your marriage. The First Cause will smile upon\r\nyour unions,\" he said solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Let the robe-makers appear,\" the Karfedix ordered, and four women, hung\r\nwith spools of brilliantly-colored wire of incredible fineness and with\r\npeculiar looms under their arms, entered the room and accompanied the\r\ntwo girls to their apartment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the room was empty save for the four men, Dunark said:\r\n\r\n\"While I was in Mardonale, I heard bits of conversation regarding an\r\nimmense military discovery possessed by Nalboon, besides the gas whose\r\ndeadly effects we felt. I could get no inkling of its nature, but feel\r\nsure that it is something to be dreaded. I also heard that both of these\r\nsecrets had been stolen from Kondal, and that we were to be destroyed by\r\nour own superior inventions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Karfedix nodded his head gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"That is true, my son--partly true, at least. We shall not be destroyed,\r\nhowever. Kondal shall triumph. The discoveries were made by a Kondalian,\r\nbut I am as ignorant as are you concerning their nature. An obscure\r\ninventor, living close to the bordering ocean, was the discoverer. He\r\nwas rash enough to wireless me concerning them. He would not reveal\r\ntheir nature, but requested a guard. The Mardonalian patrol intercepted\r\nthe message and captured both him and his discoveries before our guard\r\ncould arrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's easily fixed,\" suggested Seaton. \"Let's get the Skylark fixed\r\nup, and we'll go jerk Nalboon out of his palace--if he's still\r\nalive--bring him over here, and read his mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"That might prove feasible,\" answered the Kofedix, \"and in any event we\r\nmust repair the Skylark and replenish her supply of copper immediately.\r\nThat must be our first consideration, so that you, our guests, will\r\nhave a protection in any emergency.\"\r\n\r\nThe Karfedix went to his duties and the other three made their way to\r\nthe wrecked space-car. They found that besides the damage done to the\r\nhull, many of the instruments were broken, including one of the\r\nobject-compasses focused upon the Earth.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good thing you had three of them, Mart. I sure hand it to you\r\nfor preparedness,\" said Seaton, as he tossed the broken instruments out\r\nupon the dock. Dunark protested at this treatment, and placed the\r\ndiscarded instruments in a strong metal safe, remarking:\r\n\r\n\"These things may prove useful at some future time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose the first thing to do is to get some powerful jacks and\r\nstraighten these plates,\" said Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"Why not throw away this soft metal, steel, and build it of arenak, as\r\nit should be built? You have plenty of salt,\" suggested Dunark.\r\n\r\n\"Fine! We have lots of salt in the galley, haven't we, Mart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, nearly a hundred pounds. We are stocked for emergencies, with two\r\nyears' supply of food, you know.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDunark's eyes opened in astonishment at the amount mentioned, in spite\r\nof his knowledge of earthly conditions. He started to say something,\r\nthen stopped in confusion, but Seaton divined his thought.\r\n\r\n\"We can spare him fifty pounds as well as not, can't we, Mart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. Fifty pounds of salt is a ridiculously cheap price for what\r\nhe is doing for us, even though it is very rare here.\"\r\n\r\nDunark acknowledged the gift with shining eyes and heartfelt, but not\r\nprofuse, thanks, and bore the precious bag to the palace under a heavy\r\nescort. He returned with a small army of workmen, and after making tests\r\nto assure himself that the power-bar would work as well through arenak\r\nas through steel, he instructed the officers concerning the work to be\r\ndone. As the wonderfully skilled mechanics set to work without a single\r\nuseless motion, the prince stood silent, with a look of care upon his\r\nhandsome face.\r\n\r\n\"Worrying about Mardonale, Dunark?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I cannot help wondering what that terrible new engine of\r\ndestruction is, which Nalboon now has at his command.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, why don't you build a bus like the Skylark, and blow Mardonale off\r\nthe map?\"\r\n\r\n\"Building the vessel would be easy enough, but X is as yet unknown upon\r\nOsnome.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got a lot of it....\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not accept it. The salt was different, since you have plenty.\r\nX, however, is as scarce upon Earth as salt is upon Osnome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure you can accept it. We stopped at a planet that has lots of it, and\r\nwe've got an object-compass pointing at it so that we can go back and\r\nget more of it any time we want it. We've got more of it on hand now\r\nthan we're apt to need for a long time, so have a hunk and get busy,\"\r\nand he easily carried one of the lumps out of his cabin and tossed it\r\nupon the dock, from whence it required two of Kondal's strongest men to\r\nlift it.\r\n\r\nThe look of care vanished from the face of the prince and he summoned\r\nanother corps of mechanics.\r\n\r\n\"How thick shall the walls be? Our battleships are armed with arenak the\r\nthickness of a hand, but with your vast supply of salt you may have it\r\nany thickness you wish, since the materials of the matrix are cheap and\r\nabundant.\"\r\n\r\n\"One inch would be enough, but everything in the bus is designed for a\r\nfour-foot shell, and if we change it from four feet we'll have to\r\nredesign our guns and all our instruments. Let's make it four feet.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton turned to the crippled Skylark, upon which the first crew of\r\nKondalian mechanics were working with skill and with tools undreamed-of\r\nupon Earth. The whole interior of the vessel was supported by a complex\r\nfalsework of latticed metal, then the four-foot steel plates and the\r\nmighty embers, the pride of the great MacDougall, were cut away as\r\nthough they were made of paper by revolving saws and enormous power\r\nshears. The sphere, grooved for the repellers and with the members,\r\nbraces, and central machinery complete, of the exact dimensions of the\r\noriginals, was rapidly moulded of a stiff, plastic substance resembling\r\nclay. This matrix soon hardened into a rock-like mass into which the\r\ndoors, machine-gun emplacements, and other openings were carefully cut.\r\nAll surfaces were then washed with a dilute solution of salt, which the\r\nworkmen handled as though it were radium. Two great plates of platinum\r\nwere clamped into place upon either side of the vessel, each plate\r\nconnected by means of silver cables as large as a man's leg to the\r\nreceiving terminal of an enormous wireless power station. The current\r\nwas applied and the great spherical mass apparently disappeared, being\r\ntransformed instantly into the transparent metal arenak. Then indeed had\r\nthe Earth-men a vehicle such as had never been seen before! A four-foot\r\nshell of metal five hundred times as strong and hard as the strongest\r\nand hardest steel, cast in one piece with the sustaining framework\r\ndesigned by the world's foremost engineer--a structure that no\r\nconceivable force could deform or injure, housing an inconceivable\r\npropulsive force!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe falsework was rapidly removed and the sustaining framework was\r\npainted with opaque varnish to render it plainly visible. At Seaton's\r\nsuggestion the walls of the cabins were also painted, leaving\r\ntransparent several small areas to serve as windows.\r\n\r\nThe second work-period was drawing to a close, and as Seaton and Crane\r\nwere to be married before koprat, they stopped work. They marveled at\r\nthe amount that had been accomplished, and the Kofedix told them:\r\n\r\n\"Both vessels will be finished tomorrow, except for the controlling\r\ninstruments, which we will have to make ourselves. Another crew will\r\nwork during the sleeping-period, installing the guns and other fittings.\r\nDo you wish to have your own guns installed, or guns of our pattern?\r\nYou are familiar with them now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our own, please. They are slower and less efficient than yours, but we\r\nare used to them and have a lot of X-plosive ammunition for them,\"\r\nreplied Seaton, after a short conference with Crane.\r\n\r\nAfter instructing the officers in charge of the work, the three returned\r\nto the palace, the hearts of two of them beating high in anticipation.\r\nSeaton went into Crane's room, accompanied by two attendants bearing his\r\nsuitcase and other luggage.\r\n\r\n\"We should have brought along dress clothes, Mart. Why didn't you think\r\nof that, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing like this ever entered my mind. It is a good thing we brought\r\nalong ducks and white soft shirts. I must say that this is extremely\r\ninformal garb for a state wedding, but since the natives are ignorant of\r\nour customs, it will not make any difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, too--we'll make 'em think it's the most formal kind of\r\ndress. Dunark knows what's what, but he knows that full dress would be\r\nunbearable here. We'd melt down in a minute. It's plenty hot enough as\r\nit is, with only duck trousers and sport-shirts on. They'll look green\r\ninstead of white, but that's a small matter.\"\r\n\r\nDunark, as best man, entered the room some time later.\r\n\r\n\"Give us a look, Dunark,\" begged Seaton, \"and see if we'll pass\r\ninspection. I was never so rattled in my life.\"\r\n\r\nThey were clad in spotless white, from their duck oxfords to the white\r\nties encircling the open collars of their tennis shirts. The two tall\r\nfigures--Crane's slender, wiry, at perfect ease; Seaton's\r\nbroad-shouldered, powerful, prowling about with unconscious, feline\r\nsuppleness and grace--and the two handsome, high-bred, intellectual\r\nfaces, each wearing a look of eager happiness, fully justified Dunark's\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"You sure will do!\" he pronounced enthusiastically, and with Seaton's\r\nown impulsive good will he shook hands and wished them an eternity of\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\"When you have spoken with your brides,\" he continued, \"I shall be\r\nwaiting to escort you into the chapel. Sitar told me to say that the\r\nladies are ready.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy and Margaret had been dressed in their bridal gowns by Sitar and\r\nseveral other princesses, under the watchful eyes of the Karfedir\r\nherself. Sitar placed the two girls side by side and drew off to survey\r\nher work.\r\n\r\n\"You are the loveliest creatures in the whole world!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other's glittering gowns, then Margaret glanced at\r\nDorothy's face and a look of dismay overspread her own.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dottie!\" she gasped. \"Your lovely complexion! Isn't it terrible for\r\nthe boys to see us in this light?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a peal of delighted laughter from Sitar and she spoke to one\r\nof the servants, who drew dark curtains across the windows and pressed a\r\nswitch, flooding the room with brilliant white light.\r\n\r\n\"Dunark installed lamps like those of your ship for you,\" she explained\r\nwith intense satisfaction. \"I knew in advance just how you would feel\r\nabout your color.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the girls had time to thank their thoughtful hostess she\r\ndisappeared and their bridegrooms stood before them. For a moment no\r\nword was spoken. Seaton stared at Dorothy hungrily, almost doubting the\r\nevidence of his senses. For white was white, pink was pink, and her hair\r\nshone in all its natural splendor of burnished bronze.\r\n\r\nIn their wondrous Osnomian bridal robes the beautiful Earth-maidens\r\nstood before their lovers. Upon their feet were jeweled slippers. Their\r\nlovely bodies were clothed in softly shimmering garments that left their\r\nrounded arms and throats bare--garments infinitely more supple than the\r\nfinest silk, thick-woven of metallic threads of such fineness that the\r\nindividual wires were visible only under a lens; garments that floated\r\nand clung about their perfect forms in lines of exquisite grace. For\r\nblack-haired Margaret, with her ivory skin, the Kondalian princess had\r\nchosen a background of a rare white metal, upon which, in complicated\r\nfigures, glistened numberless jewels of pale colors, more brilliant than\r\ndiamonds. Dorothy's dress was of a peculiar, dark-green shade,\r\nhalf-hidden by an intricate design of blazing green gems--the strange,\r\nluminous jewels of this strange world. Both girls wore their long, heavy\r\nhair unbound, after the Kondalian bridal fashion, brushed until it fell\r\nlike mist about them and confined at the temples by metallic bands\r\nentirely covered with jewels.\r\n\r\nSeaton looked from Dorothy to Margaret and back again; looked down into\r\nher violet eyes, deep with wonder and with love, more beautiful than any\r\njewel in all her gorgeous costume. Unheeding the presence of the others,\r\nshe put her dainty hands upon his mighty shoulders and stood on tiptoe.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Dick. Now and always, here or at home or anywhere in the\r\nUniverse. We'll never be parted again,\" she whispered, and her own\r\nbeloved violin had no sweeter tones than had her voice.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, her eyes wet and shining, she drew herself away\r\nfrom him and glanced at Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't she the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Seaton answered promptly, \"she is not--but poor old Mart thinks\r\nshe is!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccompanied by the Karfedix and his son, Seaton and Crane went into the\r\nchapel, which, already brilliant, had been decorated anew with even\r\ngreater splendor. Glancing through the wide arches they saw, for the\r\nfirst time, Osnomians clothed. The great room was filled with the\r\nhighest nobility of Kondal, wearing their heavily-jeweled, resplendent\r\nrobes of state. Every color of the rainbow and numberless fantastic\r\npatterns were there, embodied in the soft, lustrous, metallic fabric.\r\n\r\nAs the men entered one door Dorothy and Margaret, with the Karfedir and\r\nSitar, entered the other, and the entire assemblage rose to its feet and\r\nsnapped into the grand salute. Moving to the accompaniment of strange\r\nmartial music from concealed instruments, the two parties approached\r\neach other, meeting at the raised platform or pulpit where Karbix\r\nTarnan, a handsome, stately, middle-aged man who carried easily his\r\nhundred and fifty karkamo of age, awaited them. As he raised his arms,\r\nthe music ceased.\r\n\r\nIt was a solemn and wonderfully impressive spectacle. The room, of\r\nburnished metal, with its bizarre decorations wrought in scintillating\r\ngems; the constantly changing harmony of colors as the invisible lamps\r\nwere shifted from one shade to another; the group of mighty nobles\r\nstanding rigidly at attention in a silence so profound that it was an\r\nutter absence of everything audible as the Karbix lifted both arms in a\r\nsilent invocation of the great First Cause--all these things deepened\r\nthe solemnity of that solemn moment.\r\n\r\nWhen Tarnan spoke, his voice, deep with some great feeling, inexplicable\r\neven to those who knew him best, carried clearly to every part of the\r\ngreat chamber.\r\n\r\n\"Friends, it is our privilege to assist today in a most notable event,\r\nthe marriage of four personages from another world. For the first time\r\nin the history of Osnome, one karfedix has the privilege of entertaining\r\nthe bridal party of another. It is not for this fact alone, however,\r\nthat this occasion is to be memorable. A far deeper reason is that we\r\nare witnessing, possibly for the first time in the history of the\r\nUniverse, the meeting upon terms of mutual fellowship and understanding\r\nof the inhabitants of two worlds separated by unthinkable distances of\r\ntrackless space and by equally great differences in evolution,\r\nconditions of life, and environment. Yet these strangers are actuated by\r\nthe spirit of good faith and honor which is instilled into every worthy\r\nbeing by the great First Cause, in the working out of whose vast\r\nprojects all things are humble instruments.\r\n\r\n\"In honor of the friendship of the two worlds, we will proceed with the\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\n\"Richard Seaton and Martin Crane, exchange the plain rings with Dorothy\r\nVaneman and Margaret Spencer.\"\r\n\r\nThey did so, and repeated, after the Karbix, simple vows of love and\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\n\"May the First Cause smile upon this temporary marriage and render it\r\nworthy of being made permanent. As a lowly servant of the all-powerful\r\nFirst Cause I pronounce you two, and you two, husband and wife. But we\r\nmust remember that the dull vision of mortal man cannot pierce the veil\r\nof futurity, which is as crystal to the all-beholding eye of the First\r\nCause. Though you love each other truly, unforeseen things may come\r\nbetween you to mar the perfection of your happiness. Therefore a time is\r\ngranted you during which you may discover whether or not your unions are\r\nperfect.\"\r\n\r\nA pause ensued, then Tarnan went on:\r\n\r\n\"Martin Crane, Margaret Spencer, Richard Seaton, and Dorothy Vaneman,\r\nyou are before us to take the final vows which shall bind your bodies\r\ntogether for life and your spirits together for eternity. Have you\r\nconsidered the gravity of this step sufficiently to enter into this\r\nmarriage without reservation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" solemnly replied the four, in unison.\r\n\r\n\"Exchange the jeweled rings. Do you, Richard Seaton and Dorothy Vaneman;\r\nand you, Martin Crane and Margaret Spencer; individually swear, here in\r\nthe presence of the First Cause and that of the Supreme Justices of\r\nKondal, that you will be true and loyal, each helping his chosen one in\r\nall things, great and small; that never throughout eternity, in thought\r\nor in action, will either your body or your mind or your conscious\r\nspirit stray from the path of fairness and truth and honor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pronounce you married with the eternal marriage. Just as the faidon\r\nwhich you each now wear--the eternal jewel which no force of man,\r\nhowever applied, has yet been able to change or deform in any\r\nparticular; and which continues to give off its inward light without\r\nchange throughout eternity--shall endure through endless cycles of time\r\nafter the metal of the ring which holds it shall have crumbled in decay:\r\neven so shall your spirits, formerly two, now one and indissoluble,\r\nprogress in ever-ascending evolution throughout eternity after the base\r\nmaterial which is your bodies shall have returned to the senseless dust\r\nfrom whence it arose.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Karbix lowered his arms and the bridal party walked to the door\r\nthrough a double rank of uplifted weapons. From the chapel they were led\r\nto another room, where the contracting parties signed their names in a\r\nregister. The Kofedix then brought forward two marriage\r\ncertificates--heavy square plates of a brilliant purple metal,\r\nbeautifully engraved in parallel columns of English and Kondalian\r\nscript, and heavily bordered with precious stones. The principals and\r\nwitnesses signed below each column, the signatures being deeply engraved\r\nby the royal engraver. Leaving the registry, they were escorted to the\r\ndining hall, where a truly royal repast was served. Between courses the\r\nhighest nobles of the nation welcomed the visitors and wished them\r\nhappiness in short but earnest addresses. After the last course had been\r\ndisposed of, the Karbix rose at a sign from the Karfedix and spoke, his\r\nvoice again agitated by the emotion which had puzzled his hearers during\r\nthe marriage service.\r\n\r\n\"All Kondal is with us here in spirit, trying to aid us in our poor\r\nattempts to convey our welcome to these our guests, of whose friendship\r\nno greater warrant could be given than their willingness to grant us the\r\nprivilege of their marriage. Not only have they given us a boon that\r\nwill make their names revered throughout the nation as long as Kondal\r\nshall exist, but they have also been the means of showing us plainly\r\nthat the First Cause is upon our side, that our age-old institution of\r\nhonor is in truth the only foundation upon which can be built a race\r\nfitted to survive. At the same time they have been the means of showing\r\nus that our hated foe, entirely without honor, building his race upon a\r\nfoundation of bloodthirsty savagery alone, is building wrongly and must\r\nperish utterly from the face of Osnome.\"\r\n\r\nHis hearers listened, impressed by his earnestness, but plainly not\r\nunderstanding his meaning.\r\n\r\n\"You do not understand?\" he went on, with a deep light shining in his\r\neyes. \"It is inevitable that two peoples inhabiting worlds so widely\r\nseparated as are our two should be possessed of widely-varying knowledge\r\nand abilities, and these strangers have already made it possible for us\r\nto construct engines of destruction which shall obliterate Mardonale\r\ncompletely....\" A fierce shout of joy interrupted the speaker and the\r\nnobles sprang to their feet, saluting the visitors with upraised\r\nweapons. As soon as they had reseated themselves, the Karbix continued:\r\n\r\n\"That is the boon. The vindication of our system of evolution is easily\r\nexplained. The strangers landed first upon Mardonale. Had Nalboon met\r\nthem in honor, he would have gained the boon. But he, with the savagery\r\ncharacteristic of his evolution, attempted to kill his guests and steal\r\ntheir treasures, with what results you already know. We, on our part, in\r\nexchange for the few and trifling services we have been able to render\r\nthem, have received even more than Nalboon would have obtained, had his\r\nplans not been nullified by their vastly superior state of evolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe orator seated himself and there was a deafening clamor of cheering\r\nas the nobles formed themselves into an escort of honor and conducted\r\nthe two couples to their apartments.\r\n\r\nAlone in their room, Dorothy turned to her husband with tears shining in\r\nher beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Dick, sweetheart, wasn't that the most wonderful thing that anybody\r\never heard of? Using the word in all its real meaning, it was\r\nindescribably grand, and that old man is simply superb. It makes me\r\nashamed of myself to think that I was ever afraid or nervous here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sure was all of that, Dottie mine, little bride of an hour. The\r\nwhole thing gets right down to where a fellow lives--I've got a lump in\r\nmy throat right now so big that it hurts me to think. Earthly marriages\r\nare piffling in comparison with that ceremony. It's no wonder they're\r\nhappy, after taking those vows--especially as they don't have to take\r\nthem until after they are sure of themselves.\r\n\r\n\"But we're sure already, sweetheart,\" as he embraced her with all the\r\nfeeling of his nature. \"Those vows are not a bit stronger than the ones\r\nwe have already exchanged--bodily and mentally and spiritually we are\r\none, now and forever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBird, Beast, or Fish?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These jewels rather puzzle me, Dick. What are they?\" asked Martin, as\r\nthe four assembled, waiting for the first meal. As he spoke he held up\r\nhis third finger, upon which gleamed the royal jewel of Osnome in its\r\nsplendid Belcher mounting of arenak as transparent as the jewel itself\r\nand having the same intense blue color. \"I know the name, 'faidon,' but\r\nthat's all I seem to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about all that anybody knows about them. It is a\r\nnaturally-occurring, hundred-faceted crystal, just as you see it\r\nthere--deep blue, perfectly transparent, intensely refractive, and\r\nconstantly emitting that strong, blue light. It is so hard that it\r\ncannot be worked, cut, or ground. No amount of the hardest known\r\nabrasive will even roughen its surface. No blow, however great, will\r\nbreak it--it merely forces its way into the material of the hammer,\r\nhowever hard the hammer may be. No extremity of either heat or cold\r\naffects it in any degree, it is the same when in the most powerful\r\nelectric arc as it is when immersed in liquid helium.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about acids?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I am asking myself. Osnomians aren't much force at\r\nchemistry. I'm going to try to get hold of another one, and see if I\r\ncan't analyze it, just for fun. I can't seem to convince myself that a\r\nreal atomic structure could be that large.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is rather large for an atom,\" and turning to the two girls, \"How\r\ndo you like your solitaires?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're perfectly beautiful, and the Tiffany mounting is exquisite,\"\r\nreplied Dorothy, enthusiastically, \"but they're so awfully big! They're\r\nas big as ten-carat diamonds, I do believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just about,\" replied Seaton, \"but at that, they're the smallest Dunark\r\ncould find. They have been kicking around for years, he says--so small\r\nthat nobody wanted them. They wear big ones on their bracelets, you\r\nknow. You sure will make a hit in Washington, Dottie. People will think\r\nyou're wearing a bottle-stopper until they see it shining in the dark,\r\nthen they'll think it's an automobile headlight. But after a few\r\njewelers have seen these stones, one of them will be offering us five\r\nmillion dollars apiece for them, trying to buy them for some dizzy old\r\ndame who wants to put out the eyes of some of her social rivals. Yes?\r\nNo?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about right, Dick,\" replied Crane, and his face wore a\r\nthoughtful look. \"We can't keep it secret that we have a new jewel,\r\nsince all four of us will be wearing them continuously, and anyone who\r\nknows jewels at all will recognize these as infinitely superior to any\r\nknown Earthly jewel. In fact, they may get some of us into trouble, as\r\nfabulously valuable jewels usually do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true, too. So we'll let it out casually that they're as common\r\nas mud up here--that we're just wearing them for sentiment, which is\r\ntrue, and that we're thinking of bringing back a shipload to sell for\r\nparking lights.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would probably keep anyone from trying to murder our wives for\r\ntheir rings, at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you read your marriage certificate, Dick?\" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. Let's look at it, Dottie.\"\r\n\r\nShe produced the massive, heavily-jeweled document, and the auburn head\r\nand the brown one were very close to each other as they read together\r\nthe English side of the certificate. Their vows were there, word for\r\nword, with their own signatures beneath them, all deeply engraved into\r\nthe metal. Seaton smiled as he saw the legal form engraved below their\r\nsignatures, and read aloud:\r\n\r\n     \"I, the Head of the Church and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed\r\n     forces of Kondal, upon the planet Osnome, certify that I have this\r\n     day, in the city of Kondalek, of said nation and planet, joined in\r\n     indissoluble bonds of matrimony, Richard Ballinger Seaton, Doctor\r\n     of Philosophy, and Dorothy Lee Vaneman; Doctor of Music; both of\r\n     the city of Washington, District of Columbia, United States of\r\n     America, upon the planet Earth, in strict compliance with the\r\n     marriage laws, both of Kondal and of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n     TARNAN.\"\r\n\r\n     Witnesses:\r\n       ROBAN, Emperor of Kondal.\r\n       TURAL, Empress of Kondal.\r\n       DUNARK, Crown Prince of Kondal.\r\n       SITAR, Crown Princess of Kondal.\r\n       MARC C. DUQUESNE, Ph. D., Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\"That is SOME document,\" remarked Seaton. \"Probably a lawyer could find\r\nfault with his phraseology, but I'll bet that this thing would hold in\r\nany court in the world. Think you'll get married again when we get back,\r\nMart?\"\r\n\r\nBoth girls protested, and Crane answered:\r\n\r\n\"No, I think not. Our ceremony would be rather an anticlimax after this\r\none, and this one will undoubtedly prove legal. I intend to register\r\nthis just as it is, and get a ruling from the courts. But it is time for\r\nbreakfast. Pardon me--I should have said 'darprat,' for it certainly is\r\nnot breakfast-time by Washington clocks. My watch says that it is\r\neleven-thirty P. M.\"\r\n\r\n\"This system of time is funny,\" remarked Dorothy. \"I just can't get used\r\nto having no night, and....\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's such a long time between eats, as the famous governor said\r\nabout the drinks,\" broke in Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know what I was going to say, Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Husbandly intuition,\" he grinned, \"aided and abetted by a normal\r\nappetite that rebels at seventeen hours between supper and breakfast,\r\nand nine hours between the other meals. Well, it's time to eat--let's\r\ngo!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter eating, the men hurried to the Skylark. During the sleeping-period\r\nthe vessel had been banded with the copper repellers: the machine guns\r\nand instruments, including the wonderful Osnomian wireless system, had\r\nbeen installed; and, except for the power-bars, she was ready for a\r\nvoyage. The Kondalian vessel was complete, even to the cushions, but was\r\nwithout instruments.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief conversation with the officer in charge, Dunark turned to\r\nSeaton.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you find that your springs couldn't stand up under the\r\nacceleration?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they flattened out dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Kolanix Felan, in charge of the work, thought so, and substituted\r\nour compound-compensated type, made of real spring metal, for them.\r\nThey'll hold you through any acceleration you can live through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, that's fine. What's next, instruments?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I have sent a crew of men to gather up what copper they can\r\nfind--you know that we use practically no metallic copper, as platinum,\r\ngold, and silver are so much better for ordinary purposes--and another\r\nto erect a copper-smelter near one of the mines which supply the city\r\nwith the copper sulphate used upon our tables. While they are at work I\r\nthink I will work on the instruments, if you two will be kind enough to\r\nhelp me.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton and Crane offered to supply him with instruments from their\r\nreserve stock, but the Kofedix refused to accept them, saying that he\r\nwould rather have their help in making them, so that he would thoroughly\r\nunderstand their functions. The electric furnaces were rapidly made\r\nready and they set to work; Crane taking great delight in working that\r\nhitherto rare and very refractory metal, iridium, of which all the\r\nKondalian instruments were to be made.\r\n\r\n\"They have a lot of our rare metals here, Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"They sure have. I'd like to set up a laboratory and live here a few\r\nyears--I'd learn something about my specialty or burst. They use gold\r\nand silver where we use copper, and platinum and its alloys where we use\r\niron and soft steel. All their weapons are made of iridium, and all\r\ntheir most highly-tempered tools, such as their knives, razors, and so\r\non, are made of opaque arenak. I suppose you've noticed the edge on your\r\nrazor?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I help it? It is hard to realize that a metal can be so hard\r\nthat it requires forty years on a diamond-dust abrasive machine to hone\r\na razor--or that once honed, it shaves generation after generation of\r\nmen without losing in any degree its keenness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand it, either--I only know that it's so. They have all\r\nour heavy metals in great abundance, and a lot more that we don't know\r\nanything about on Earth, but they apparently haven't any light metals at\r\nall. It must be that Osnome was thrown off the parent sun late, so that\r\nthe light metals were all gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something like that, possibly.\"\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary skill of the Kofedix made the manufacture of the\r\ninstruments a short task, and after Crane had replaced the few broken\r\ninstruments of the Skylark from their reserve stock, they turned their\r\nattention to the supply of copper that had been gathered. They found it\r\nenough for only two bars.\r\n\r\n\"Is this all we have?\" asked Dunark, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"It is, your Highness,\" replied the Kolanix. \"That is every scrap of\r\nmetallic copper in the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, that'll be enough to last until we can smelt the rest,\" said\r\nSeaton. \"With one bar apiece we're ready for anything Mardonale can\r\nstart. Let 'em come!\"\r\n\r\nThe bars were placed in the containers and both vessels were tried out,\r\neach making a perfect performance. Upon the following kokam, immediately\r\nafter the first meal, the full party from the Earth boarded the Skylark\r\nand accompanied the Kofedix to the copper smelter. Dunark himself\r\ndirected the work of preparing the charges and the molds, though he was\r\ncontinually being interrupted by wireless messages in code and by\r\nmessengers bearing tidings too important to trust into the air.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will excuse all of these delays,\" said Dunark, after the\r\ntwentieth interruption, \"but....\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Dunark. We know that you're a busy man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you about it, but I wouldn't want to tell many people. With\r\nthe salt you gave us, I am preparing a power-plant that will enable us\r\nto blow Mardonale into....\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off as a wireless call for help sounded. All listened intently,\r\nlearning that a freight-plane was being pursued by a karlon a few\r\nhundred miles away.\r\n\r\n\"Now's the time for you to study one, Dunark!\" Seaton exclaimed. \"Get\r\nyour gang of scientists out here while we go get him and drag him in!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Dunark sent the message, the Skylark's people hurried aboard, and\r\nSeaton drove the vessel toward the calls for help. With its great speed\r\nit reached the monster before the plane was overtaken. Focusing the\r\nattractor upon the enormous metallic beak of the karlon, Seaton threw on\r\nthe power and the beast halted in midair as it was jerked backward and\r\nupward. As it saw the puny size of the attacking Skylark, it opened its\r\ncavernous mouth in a horrible roar and rushed at full speed. Seaton,\r\nunwilling to have the repellers stripped from the vessel, turned on the\r\ncurrent actuating them. The karlon was hurled backward to the point of\r\nequilibrium of the two forces, where it struggled demoniacally.\r\n\r\nSeaton carried his captive back to the smelter, where finally, by\r\njudicious pushing and pulling, he succeeded in turning the monster flat\r\nupon its back and pinning it to the ground in spite of its struggles to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nSoon the scientists arrived and studied the animal thoroughly, at as\r\nclose a range as its flailing arms permitted.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could kill him without blowing him to bits,\" wirelessed\r\nDunark. \"Do you know any way of doing it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We could if we had a few barrels of ether, or some of our own poison\r\ngases, but they are all unknown here and it would take a long time to\r\nbuild the apparatus to make them. I'll see if I can't tire him out and\r\nget him that way as soon as you've studied him enough. We may be able to\r\nfind out where he lives, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe scientists having finished their observations, Seaton jerked the\r\nanimal a few miles into the air and shut off the forces acting upon it.\r\nThere was a sudden crash, and the karlon, knowing that this apparently\r\ninsignificant vessel was its master, turned in headlong flight.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any idea what caused the noise just then, Dick?\" asked Crane;\r\nwho, with characteristic imperturbability, had taken out his notebook\r\nand was making exact notes of all that transpired.\r\n\r\n\"I imagine we cracked a few of his plates,\" replied Seaton with a laugh,\r\nas he held the Skylark in place a few hundred feet above the fleeing\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nPitted for the first time in its life against an antagonist, who could\r\nboth outfly and outfight it, the karlon redoubled its efforts and fled\r\nin a panic of fear. It flew back over the city of Kondalek, over the\r\noutlying country, and out over the ocean, still followed easily by the\r\nSkylark. As they neared the Mardonalian border, a fleet of warships rose\r\nto contest the entry of the monster. Seaton, not wishing to let the foe\r\nsee the rejuvenated Skylark, jerked his captive high into the thin air.\r\nAs soon as it was released, it headed for the ocean in an almost\r\nperpendicular dive, while Seaton focused an object-compass upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Go to it, old top,\" he addressed the plunging monster. \"We'll follow\r\nyou clear to the bottom of the ocean if you go that far!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a mighty double splash as the karlon struck the water, closely\r\nfollowed by the Skylark. The girls gasped as the vessel plunged below\r\nthe surface at such terrific speed, and seemed surprised that it had\r\nsuffered no injury and that they had felt no jar. Seaton turned on the\r\npowerful searchlights and kept close enough so that he could see the\r\nmonster through the transparent walls. Deeper and deeper the quarry\r\ndove, until it was plainly evident to the pursuers that it was just as\r\nmuch at home in the water as it was in the air. The beams of the lights\r\nrevealed strange forms of life, among which were huge, staring-eyed\r\nfishes, which floundered about blindly in the unaccustomed glare. As the\r\nkarlon bored still deeper, the living things became scarcer, but still\r\noccasional fleeting glimpses were obtained of the living nightmares\r\nwhich inhabited the oppressive depths of these strange seas. Continuing\r\ndownward, the karlon plumbed the nethermost pit of the ocean and came to\r\nrest upon the bottom, stirring up a murk of ooze.\r\n\r\n\"How deep are we, Mart?\"\r\n\r\n\"About four miles. I have read the pressure, but will have to calculate\r\nlater exactly what depth it represents, from the gravity and density\r\nreadings.\"\r\n\r\nAs the animal showed no sign of leaving its retreat, Seaton pulled it\r\nout with the attractor and it broke for the surface. Rising through the\r\nwater at full speed, it burst into the air and soared upward to such an\r\nincredible height that Seaton was amazed.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have believed that anything could fly in air this thin!\" he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"It is thin up here,\" assented Crane. \"Less than three pounds to the\r\nsquare inch. I wonder how he does it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't look as though we are ever going to find out--he's sure a\r\nbear-cat!\" replied Seaton, as the karlon, unable to ascend further,\r\ndropped in a slanting dive toward the lowlands of Kondal--the terrible,\r\nswampy region covered with poisonous vegetation and inhabited by\r\nfrightful animals and even more frightful savages. The monster neared\r\nthe ground with ever-increasing speed. Seaton, keeping close behind it,\r\nremarked to Crane:\r\n\r\n\"He'll have to flatten out pretty quick, or he'll burst something,\r\nsure.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it did not flatten out. It struck the soft ground head foremost and\r\ndisappeared, its tentacles apparently boring a way ahead of it.\r\n\r\nAstonished at such an unlooked-for development, Seaton brought the\r\nSkylark to a stop and stabbed into the ground with the attractor. The\r\nfirst attempt brought up nothing but a pillar of muck, the second\r\nbrought to light a couple of wings and one writhing arm, the third\r\nbrought the whole animal, still struggling as strongly as it had in the\r\nfirst contest. Seaton again lifted the animal high into the air.\r\n\r\n\"If he does that again, we'll follow him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will the ship stand it?\" asked DuQuesne, with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The old bus wouldn't have, but this one can stand anything. We can\r\ngo anywhere that thing can, that's a cinch. If we have enough power on,\r\nwe probably won't even feel a jolt when we strike ground.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton reduced the force acting upon the animal until just enough was\r\nleft to keep the attractor upon it, and it again dived into the swamp.\r\nThe Skylark followed, feeling its way in the total darkness, until the\r\nanimal stopped, refusing to move in any direction, at a depth estimated\r\nby Crane to be about three-quarters of a mile. After waiting some time\r\nSeaton increased the power of the attractor and tore the karlon back to\r\nthe surface and into the air, where it turned on the Skylark with\r\nredoubled fury.\r\n\r\n\"We've dug him out of his last refuge and he's fighting like a cornered\r\nrat,\" said Seaton as he repelled the monster to a safe distance. \"He's\r\napparently as fresh as when he started, in spite of all this playing.\r\nTalk about a game fish! He doesn't intend to run any more, though, so I\r\nguess we'll have to put him away. It's a shame to bump him off, but it's\r\ngot to be done.\"\r\n\r\nCrane aimed one of the heavy X-plosive bullets at the\r\nsavagely-struggling monster, and the earth rocked with the concussion as\r\nthe shell struck its mark. They hurried back to the smelter, where\r\nDunark asked eagerly:\r\n\r\n\"What did you find out about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much,\" replied Seaton, and in a few words described the actions\r\nof the karlon. \"What did your savants think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little that any of us can understand in terms of any other known\r\norganism. It seems to combine all the characteristics of bird, beast,\r\nand fish, and to have within itself the possibilities of both bisexual\r\nand asexual reproduction.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't doubt it--it's a queer one, all right.\"\r\n\r\nThe copper bars were cool enough to handle, and the Skylark was loaded\r\nwith five times its original supply of copper, the other vessel taking\r\non a much smaller amount. After the Kofedix had directed the officer in\r\ncharge to place the remaining bars in easily-accessible places\r\nthroughout the nation, the two vessels were piloted back to the palace,\r\narriving just in time for the last meal of the kokam.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Dunark,\" said Seaton after the meal was over, \"I'm afraid that we\r\nmust go back as soon as we can. Dorothy's parents and Martin's bankers\r\nwill think they are dead by this time. We should start right now,\r\nbut....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, you must not do that. That would rob our people of the chance\r\nof bidding you goodbye.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's another reason, too. I have a mighty big favor to ask of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is granted. If man can do it, consider it done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know platinum is a very scarce and highly useful metal with\r\nus. I wonder if you could let us have a few tons of it? And I would like\r\nto have another faidon, too--I want to see if I can't analyze it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have given us a thousand times the value of all the platinum and\r\nall the jewels your vessel can carry. As soon as the foundries are open\r\ntomorrow we will go and load up your store-rooms--or, if you wish, we\r\nwill do it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't necessary. We may as well enjoy your hospitality for one\r\nmore sleeping-period, get the platinum during the first work-period, and\r\nbid you goodbye just before the second meal. How would that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nThe following kokam, Dunark piloted the Skylark, with Seaton, Crane, and\r\nDuQuesne as crew, to one of the great platinum foundries. The girls\r\nremained behind to get ready for their departure, and for the great\r\nceremony which was to precede it. The trip to the foundry was a short\r\none, and the three scientists of Earth stared at what they\r\nsaw--thousands of tons of platinum, cast into bars and piled up like\r\npig-iron, waiting to be made into numerous articles of every-day use\r\nthroughout the nation. Dunark wrote out an order, which his chief\r\nattendant handed to the officer in charge of the foundry, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Please have it loaded at once.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton indicated the storage compartment into which the metal was to be\r\ncarried, and a procession of slaves, two men staggering under one ingot,\r\nwas soon formed between the pile and the storage room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"How much are you loading on, Dunark?\" asked Seaton, when the large\r\ncompartment was more than half full.\r\n\r\n\"My order called for about twenty tons, in your weight, but I changed it\r\nlater--we may as well fill that room full, so that the metal will not\r\nrattle around in flight. It doesn't make any difference to us, we have\r\nso much of it. It is like your gift of the salt, only vastly smaller.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with it all, Dick?\" asked Crane. \"That is\r\nenough to break the platinum market completely.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly what I'm going to do,\" returned Seaton, with a gleam in\r\nhis gray eyes. \"I'm going to burst this unjustifiable fad for platinum\r\njewelry so wide open that it'll never recover, and make platinum again\r\navailable for its proper uses, in laboratories and in the industries.\r\n\r\n\"You know yourself,\" he rushed on hotly, \"that the only reason platinum\r\nis used at all for jewelry is that it is expensive. It isn't nearly so\r\nhandsome as either gold or silver, and if it wasn't the most costly\r\ncommon metal we have, the jewelry-wearing crowd wouldn't touch it with a\r\nten-foot pole. Useless as an ornament, it is the one absolutely\r\nindispensable laboratory metal, and literally hundreds of laboratories\r\nthat need it can't have it because over half the world's supply is tied\r\nup in jeweler's windows and in useless baubles. Then, too, it is the\r\nbest thing known for contact points in electrical machinery. When the\r\nGovernment and all the scientific societies were abjectly begging the\r\njewelers to let loose a little of it they refused--they were selling it\r\nto profiteering spendthrifts at a hundred and fifty dollars an ounce.\r\nThe condition isn't much better right now; it's a vicious circle. As\r\nlong as the price stays high it will be used for jewelry, and as long as\r\nit is used for jewelry the price will stay high, and scientists will\r\nhave to fight the jewelers for what little they get.\"\r\n\r\n\"While somewhat exaggerated, that is about the way matters stand. I will\r\nadmit that I, too, am rather bitter on the subject,\" said Crane.\r\n\r\n\"Bitter? Of course you're bitter. Everybody is who knows anything about\r\nscience and who has a brain in his head. Anybody who claims to be a\r\nscientist and yet stands for any of his folks buying platinum jewelry\r\nought to be shot. But they'll get theirs as soon as we get back. They\r\nwouldn't let go of it before, they had too good a thing, but they'll let\r\ngo now, and get their fingers burned besides. I'm going to dump this\r\nwhole shipment at fifty cents a pound, and we'll take mighty good care\r\nthat jewelers don't corner the supply.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm with you, Dick, as usual.\"\r\n\r\nSoon the storage room was filled to the ceiling with closely-stacked\r\ningots of the precious metal, and the Skylark was driven back to the\r\nlanding dock. She alighted beside Dunark's vessel, the _Kondal_, whose\r\ngorgeously-decorated crew of high officers sprang to attention as the\r\nfour men stepped out. All were dressed for the ceremonial leave-taking,\r\nthe three Americans wearing their spotless white, the Kondalians wearing\r\ntheir most resplendent trappings.\r\n\r\n\"This formal stuff sure does pull my cork!\" exclaimed Seaton to Dunark.\r\n\"I want to get this straight. The arrangement was that we were to be\r\nhere at this time, all dressed up, and wait for the ladies, who are\r\ncoming under the escort of your people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Our family is to escort the ladies from the palace here. As they\r\nleave the elevator the surrounding war-vessels will salute, and after a\r\nbrief ceremony you two will escort your wives into the Skylark, Doctor\r\nDuQuesne standing a little apart and following you in. The war-vessels\r\nwill escort you as high as they can go, and the Kondal will accompany\r\nyou as far as our most distant sun before turning back.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Seaton nervously paced a short beat in front of the\r\ndoor of the space-car.\r\n\r\n\"I'm getting more fussed every second,\" he said abruptly, taking out his\r\nwireless instrument. \"I'm going to see if they aren't about ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"What seems to be the trouble, Dick? Have you another hunch, or are you\r\njust rattled?\" asked Crane.\r\n\r\n\"Rattled, I guess, but I sure do want to get going,\" he replied, as he\r\nworked the lever rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"Dottie,\" he sent out, and, the call being answered, \"How long will you\r\nbe? We're all ready and waiting, chewing our finger-nails with\r\nimpatience.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon be ready. The Karfedix is coming for us now.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had the tiny sounder become silent when the air was shaken by\r\nan urgently-vibrated message, and every wireless sounder gave warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nThe Invasion\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pulsating air and the chattering sounders were giving the same dire\r\nwarning, the alarm extraordinary of invasion, of imminent and\r\ncatastrophic danger from the air.\r\n\r\n\"Don't try to reach the palace. Everyone on the ground will have time\r\nenough to hide in the deep, arenak-protected pits beneath the buildings,\r\nand you would be killed by the invaders long before you could reach the\r\npalace. If we can repel the enemy and keep them from landing, the women\r\nwill be perfectly safe, even though the whole city is destroyed. If they\r\neffect a landing we are lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll not land, then,\" Seaton answered grimly, as he sprang into the\r\nSkylark and took his place at the board. As Crane took out his wireless,\r\nSeaton cautioned him.\r\n\r\n\"Send in English, and tell the girls not to answer, as these devils can\r\nlocate the calls within a foot and will be able to attack the right\r\nspot. Just tell them we're safe in the Skylark. Tell them to sit tight\r\nwhile we wipe out this gang that is coming, and that we'll call them,\r\nonce in a while, when we have time, during the battle.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Crane had finished sending the message the crescendo whine of\r\nenormous propellers was heard. Simultaneously there was a deafening\r\nconcussion and one entire wing of the palace disappeared in a cloud of\r\ndust, in the midst of which could be discerned a few flying fragments.\r\nThe air was filled with Mardonalian warships. They were huge vessels,\r\neach mounting hundreds of guns, and the rain of high-explosive shells\r\nwas rapidly reducing the great city to a wide-spread heap of debris.\r\n\r\nSeaton's hand was upon the lever which would hurl the Skylark upward\r\ninto the fray. Crane and DuQuesne, each hard of eye and grim of jaw,\r\nwere stationed at their machine-guns.\r\n\r\n\"Something's up!\" exclaimed Seaton. \"Look at the Kondal!\"\r\n\r\nSomething had happened indeed. Dunark sat at the board, his hand upon\r\nthe power lever, and each of his crew was in place, grasping his weapon,\r\nbut every man was writhing in agony, unable to control his movements. As\r\nthey stared, momentarily spellbound, the entire crew ceased their\r\nagonized struggles and hung, apparently lifeless, from their supports.\r\n\r\n\"They've got to 'em some way--let's go!\" yelled Seaton.\r\n\r\nAs his hand tightened upon the lever, a succession of shells burst upon\r\nthe dock, wrecking it completely, all three men fancied that the world\r\nhad come to an end as the stream of high explosive was directed against\r\ntheir vessel. But the four-foot shell of arenak was impregnable, and\r\nSeaton shot the Skylark upward into the midst of the enemy fleet. The\r\ntwo gunners fired as fast as they could sight their weapons, and with\r\neach shot one of the great warships was blown into fragments. The\r\nMardonalians then concentrated the fire of their entire fleet upon their\r\ntiny opponent.\r\n\r\nFrom every point of the compass, from above and below, the enemy gunners\r\ndirected streams of shells against the dodging vessel. The noise was\r\nmore than deafening, it was one continuous, shattering explosion, and\r\nthe Earth-men were surrounded by such a blaze of fire from the exploding\r\nshells that they could not see the enemy vessels. Seaton sought to dodge\r\nthe shells by a long dive toward one side, only to find that dozens of\r\nnew opponents had been launched against them--the deadly\r\nairplane-torpedoes of Osnome. Steered by wireless and carrying no crews,\r\nthey were simply winged bombs carrying thousands of pounds of terrific\r\nelectrical explosive--enough to kill the men inside the vessel by the\r\nconcussion of the explosion, even should the arenak armor be strong\r\nenough to withstand the blow. Though much faster than the Osnomian\r\nvessels, they were slow beside the Skylark, and Seaton could have dodged\r\na few of them with ease. As he dodged, however, they followed\r\nrelentlessly, and in spite of those which were blown up by the gunners,\r\ntheir number constantly increased until Seaton thought of the repellers.\r\n\r\n\"'Nobody Holme' is right!\" he exclaimed, as he threw on the power\r\nactuating the copper bands which encircled the hull in all directions.\r\nInstantly the torpedoes were hurled backward, exploding as the force\r\nstruck them, and even the shells were ineffective, exploding harmlessly,\r\nas they encountered the zone of force. The noise of the awful\r\ndetonations lessened markedly.\r\n\r\n\"Why the silence, I wonder?\" asked Seaton, while the futile shells of\r\nthe enemy continued to waste their force some hundreds of feet distant\r\nfrom their goal, and while Crane and DuQuesne were methodically\r\ndestroying the huge vessels as fast as they could aim and fire. At every\r\nreport one of the monster warships disappeared--its shattered fragments\r\nand the bodies of its crew hurtling to the ground. His voice could not\r\nbe heard in even the lessened tumult, but he continued:\r\n\r\n\"It must be that our repellers have set up a partial vacuum by repelling\r\neven the air!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly the shelling ceased and the Skylark was enveloped by a blinding\r\nglare from hundreds of great reflectors; an intense, searching,\r\nbluish-violet light that burned the flesh and seared through eyelids and\r\neyeballs into the very brain.\r\n\r\n\"Ultra-violet!\" yelled Seaton at the first glimpse of the light, as he\r\nthrew on the power. \"Shut your eyes! Turn your heads down!\"\r\n\r\nOut in space, far beyond reach of the deadly rays, the men held a short\r\nconference, then donned heavy leather-and-canvas suits, which they\r\nsmeared liberally with thick red paint, and replaced the plain glasses\r\nof their helmets with heavy lenses of deep ruby glass.\r\n\r\n\"This'll stop any ultra-violet ray ever produced,\" exulted Seaton, as he\r\nagain threw the vessel into the Mardonalian fleet. A score of the great\r\nvessels met their fate before the Skylark was located, and, although the\r\nterrible rays were again focused upon the intruder in all their\r\nintensity, the carnage continued.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, however, the men heard, or rather felt, a low, intense\r\nvibration, like a silent wave of sound--a vibration which smote upon the\r\neardrums as no possible sound could smite, a vibration which racked the\r\njoints and tortured the nerves as though the whole body were\r\ndisintegrating. So sudden and terrible was the effect that Seaton\r\nuttered an involuntary yelp of surprise and pain as he once more fled\r\ninto the safety of space.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil was that?\" demanded DuQuesne. \"Was it infra-sound? I\r\ndidn't suppose such waves could be produced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Infra-sound is right. They produce most anything here,\" replied Seaton,\r\nand Crane added:\r\n\r\n\"Well, about three fur suits apiece, with cotton in our ears, ought to\r\nkill any wave propagated through air.\"\r\n\r\nThe fur suits were donned forthwith, Seaton whispering in Crane's ear:\r\n\r\n\"I've found out something else, too. The repellers repel even the air.\r\nI'm going to shoot enough juice through them to set up a perfect vacuum\r\noutside. That'll kill those air-waves.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely were they back within range of the fleet when DuQuesne,\r\nreaching for his gun to fire the first shot, leaped backward with a\r\nyell.\r\n\r\n\"Beat it!\"\r\n\r\nOnce more at a safe distance, DuQuesne explained.\r\n\r\n\"It's lucky I'm so used to handling hot stuff that from force of habit I\r\nnever make close contact with anything at the first touch. That gun\r\ncarried thousands of volts, with lots of amperage behind them, and if I\r\nhad had a good hold on it I couldn't have let go. We'll block that game\r\nquick enough, though. Thick, dry gloves covered with rubber are all that\r\nis necessary. It's a good thing for all of us that you have those fancy\r\ncondensite handles on your levers, Seaton.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was how they got Dunark, undoubtedly,\" said Crane, as he sent a\r\nbrief message to the girls, assuring them that all was well, as he had\r\nbeen doing at every respite. \"But why were we not overcome at the same\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\n\"They must have had the current tuned to iridium, and had to experiment\r\nuntil they found the right wave for steel,\" Seaton explained.\r\n\r\n\"I should think our bar would have exploded, with all that current. They\r\nmust have hit the copper range, too?\"\r\n\r\nSeaton frowned in thought before he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe because it's induced current, and not a steady battery impulse.\r\nAnyway, it didn't. Let's go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute,\" put in Crane. \"What are they going to do next, Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Search me. I'm not used to my new Osnomian mind yet. I recognize things\r\nall right after they happen, but I can't seem to figure ahead--it's like\r\na dimly-remembered something that flashes up as soon as mentioned. I get\r\ntoo many and too new ideas at once. I know, though, that the Osnomians\r\nhave defenses against all these things except this last stunt of the\r\ncharged guns. That must be the new one that Mardonale stole from Kondal.\r\nThe defenses are, however, purely Osnomian in character and material. As\r\nwe haven't got the stuff to set them up as the Osnomians do, we'll have\r\nto do it our own way. We may be able to dope out the next one, though.\r\nLet's see, what have they given us so far?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to hand it to them,\" responded DuQuesne, admiringly. \"They're\r\ngiving us the whole range of wave-lengths, one at a time. They've given\r\nus light, both ultra-violet and visible, sound, infra-sound, and\r\nelectricity--I don't know what's left unless they give us a new kind of\r\nX-rays, or Hertzian, or infra-red heat waves, or....\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, heat!\" exclaimed Seaton. \"They produce heat by means of\r\npowerful wave-generators and by setting up heavy induced currents in the\r\narmor. They can melt arenak that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose we can handle the heat with our refrigerators?\" asked\r\nCrane.\r\n\r\n\"Probably. We have a lot of power, and the new arenak cylinders of our\r\ncompressors will stand anything. The only trouble will be in cooling the\r\ncondensers. We'll run as long as we have any water in our tanks, then go\r\ndive into the ocean to cool off. We'll try it a whirl, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSoon the Skylark was again dealing out death and destruction in the\r\nthick of the enemy vessels, who again turned from the devastation of the\r\nhelpless city to destroy this troublesome antagonist. But in spite of\r\nthe utmost efforts of light-waves, sound-waves, and high-tension\r\nelectricity, the space-car continued to take its terrible toll. As\r\nSeaton had foretold, the armor of the Skylark began to grow hot, and he\r\nturned on the full power of the refrigerating system. In spite of the\r\ncooling apparatus, however, the outer walls finally began to glow redly,\r\nand, although the interior was comfortably cool, the ends of the\r\nrifle-barrels, which were set flush with the surface of the revolving\r\narenak globes which held them, softened, rendering the guns useless. The\r\ncopper repellers melted and dripped off in flaming balls of molten\r\nmetal, so that shells once more began to crash against the armor.\r\nDuQuesne, with no thought of quitting apparent in voice or manner, said\r\ncalmly:\r\n\r\n\"Well, it looks as though they had us stopped for a few minutes. Let's\r\ngo back into space and dope out something else.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton, thinking intensely, saw a vast fleet of enemy reinforcements\r\napproaching, and at the same time received a wireless call directed to\r\nDunark. It was from the grand fleet of Kondal, hastening from the\r\nbordering ocean to the defense of the city. Using Dunark's private code,\r\nSeaton told the Karbix, who was in charge of the fleet, that the enemy\r\nhad a new invention which would wipe them out utterly without a chance\r\nto fight, and that he and his vessel were in control of the situation;\r\nand ordered him to see that no Kondalian ship came within battle range\r\nof a Mardonalian. He then turned to Crane and DuQuesne, his face grim\r\nand his fighting jaw set.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it doped right now. Give the Lark speed enough and she's some\r\nbullet herself. We've got four feet of arenak, they've got only an inch,\r\nand arenak doesn't even begin to soften until far above a blinding white\r\ntemperature. Strap yourselves in solid, for it's going to be a rough\r\nparty from now on.\"\r\n\r\nThey buckled their belts firmly, and Seaton, holding the bar toward\r\ntheir nearest antagonist, applied twenty notches of power. The Skylark\r\ndarted forward and crashed completely through the great airship. Torn\r\nwide open by the forty-foot projectile, its engines wrecked and its\r\nhelicopter-screws and propellers completely disabled, the helpless hulk\r\nplunged through two miles of empty air, a mass of wreckage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Skylark darted forward and crashed completely through\r\nthe great airship.... She was an embodied thunderbolt; a huge,\r\nirresistible, indestructible projectile, directed by a keen brain\r\ninside....]\r\n\r\nDarting hither and thither, the space-car tore through vessel after\r\nvessel of the Mardonalian fleet. She was an embodied thunderbolt; a\r\nhuge, irresistible, indestructible projectile, directed by a keen brain\r\ninside it--the brain of Richard Seaton, roused to his highest fighting\r\npitch and fighting for everything that man holds dear. Tortured by the\r\nterrible silent waves, which, now that the protecting vacuum had been\r\ndestroyed, were only partially stopped by the fur suits; shaken and\r\nbattered by the terrific impacts and the even greater shocks occurring\r\nevery second as the direction of the vessel was changed; made sick and\r\ndizzy by the nauseating swings and lurches as the Skylark spun about the\r\ncentral chamber; Seaton's wonderful physique and his nerves of steel\r\nstood him in good stead in this, the supreme battle of his life, as with\r\nteeth tight-locked and eyes gray and hard as the fracture of high-carbon\r\nsteel, he urged the Skylark on to greater and greater efforts.\r\n\r\nThough it was impossible for the eye to follow the flight of the\r\nspace-car, the mechanical sighting devices of the Mardonalian vessels\r\nkept her in as perfect focus as though she were stationary, and the\r\ngreat generators continued to hurl into her the full power of their\r\ndeath-dealing waves. The enemy guns were still spitting forth their\r\nstreams of high-explosive shells, but unlike the waves, the shells moved\r\nso slowly compared to their target that only a few found their mark, and\r\nmany of the vessels fell to the ground, riddled by the shells of their\r\nsister-ships.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith anxious eyes Seaton watched the hull of his animated cannon-ball\r\nchange in color. From dull red it became cherry, and as the cherry red\r\ngave place to bright red heat, Seaton threw even more power into the bar\r\nas he muttered through his set teeth:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Seaton, old top, you've got to cut out this loafing on the job\r\nand get busy!\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his utmost exertions and in spite of the powerful ammonia\r\nplant, now exerting its full capacity, but sadly handicapped by the fact\r\nthat its cooling-water was now boiling, Seaton saw the arenak shell\r\ncontinue to heat. The bright red was succeeded by orange, which slowly\r\nchanged, first to yellow, then to light yellow, and finally to a\r\ndazzling white; through which, with the aid of his heavy red lenses, he\r\ncould still see the enemy ships. After a time he noted that the color\r\nhad gone down to yellow and he thrilled with exultation, knowing that he\r\nhad so reduced the numbers of the enemy fleet that their wave-generators\r\ncould no longer overcome his refrigerators. After a few minutes more of\r\nthe awful carnage there remained only a small fraction of the proud\r\nfleet which, thousands strong, had invaded Kondal--a remnant that sought\r\nsafety in flight. But even in flight, they still fought with all their\r\nweapons, and the streams of bombs dropped from their keel-batteries upon\r\nthe country beneath marked the path of their retreat with a wide swath\r\nof destruction. Half inclined to let the few remaining vessels escape,\r\nSeaton's mind changed instantly as he saw the bombs spreading\r\ndevastation upon the countryside, and not until the last of the\r\nMardonalian vessels had been destroyed did he drop the Skylark into the\r\narea of ruins which had once been the palace grounds, beside the Kondal,\r\nwhich was still lying as it had fallen.\r\n\r\nAfter several attempts to steady their whirling senses, the three men\r\nfinally were able to walk, and, opening a door, they leaped out through\r\nthe opening in the still glowing wall. Seaton's first act was to\r\nwireless the news to Dorothy, who replied that they were coming as fast\r\nas they could. The men then removed their helmets, revealing faces pale\r\nand drawn, and turned to the helpless space-car.\r\n\r\n\"There's no way of getting into this thing from the outside....\" Seaton\r\nbegan, when he saw that the Kofedix and his party were beginning to\r\nrevive. Soon Dunark opened the door and stumbled out.\r\n\r\n\"I have to thank you for more than my life this time,\" he said, his\r\nvoice shaken by uncontrollable emotion as he grasped the hands of all\r\nthree men. \"Though unable to move, I was conscious and saw all that\r\nhappened--you kept them so busy that they didn't have a chance to give\r\nus enough to kill us outright. You have saved the lives of millions of\r\nour nation and have saved Kondal itself from annihilation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's not that bad,\" answered Seaton, uncomfortably. \"Both nations\r\nhave been invaded before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--once when we developed the ultra-violet ray, once when Mardonale\r\nperfected the machine for producing the silent sound-wave, and again\r\nwhen we harnessed the heat-wave. But this would have been the most\r\ncomplete disaster in history. The other inventions were not so deadly as\r\nwas this one, and there were terrible battles, from which the victors\r\nemerged so crippled that they could not completely exterminate the\r\nvanquished, who were able to re-establish themselves in the course of\r\ntime. If it had not been for you, this would have been the end, as not a\r\nKondalian soldier could move--any person touching iridium was helpless\r\nand would have been killed.\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased speaking and saluted as the Karfedix and his party rounded a\r\nheap of boulders. Dorothy and Margaret screamed in unison as they saw\r\nthe haggard faces of their husbands, and saw their suits, dripping with\r\na thick substance which they knew to be red, in spite of its\r\npurplish-black color. Seaton dodged nimbly as Dorothy sought to take him\r\nin her arms, and tore off his suit.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but red paint to stop their light-rays,\" he reassured her as he\r\nlifted her clear from the ground in a soul-satisfying embrace. Out of\r\nthe corner of his eye he saw the Kondalians staring in open-mouthed\r\namazement at the Skylark. Wheeling swiftly, he laughed as he saw a\r\ngigantic ball of frost and snow! Again donning his fur suit, he shut off\r\nthe refrigerators and returned to his party, where the Karfedix gave him\r\nthanks in measured terms. As he fell silent, Dunark added:\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to you, the Mardonalian forces, instead of wiping us out, are\r\nthemselves destroyed, while only a handful of our vessels have been\r\nlost, since the grand fleet could not arrive until the battle was over,\r\nand since the vessels that would have thrown themselves away were saved\r\nby your orders, which I heard. Thanks to you, we are not even crippled,\r\nthough our capital is destroyed and the lives of some unfortunates, who\r\ncould not reach the pits in time, have probably been lost.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to you,\" he continued in a ringing voice, \"and to the salt and\r\nthe new source of power you have given us, Mardonale shall now be\r\ndestroyed utterly!\"\r\n\r\nAfter sending out ships to relieve the suffering of the few wounded and\r\nthe many homeless, Dunark summoned a corps of mechanics, who banded on\r\nnew repellers and repaired the fused barrels of the machine-guns, all\r\nthat was necessary to restore the Skylark to perfect condition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFacing the party from Earth, the Karfedix stood in the ruins of his\r\nmagnificent palace. Back of him were the nobles of Kondal, and still\r\nfurther back, in order of rank, stood a multitude of people.\r\n\r\n\"Is it permitted, oh noble Karfedo, that I reward your captive for his\r\nshare in the victory?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" acquiesced Seaton and Crane, and Roban stepped up to DuQuesne\r\nand placed in his hand a weighty leather bag. He then fastened about his\r\nleft wrist the Order of Kondal, the highest order of the nation.\r\n\r\nHe then clasped about Crane's wrist a heavily-jeweled,\r\npeculiarly-ornamented disk wrought of a deep ruby-red metal, supported\r\nby a heavy bracelet of the same material, the most precious metal of\r\nOsnome. At sight of the disk the nobles saluted and Seaton barely\r\nconcealed a start of surprise, for it bore the royal emblem and\r\ndelegated to its bearer power second only to that of the Karfedix\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"I bestow upon you this symbol, Karfedix Crane, in recognition of what\r\nyou have this day done for Kondal. Wherever you may be upon Kondalian\r\nOsnome, which from this day henceforth shall be all Osnome, you have\r\npower as my personal representative, as my eldest son.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew forth a second bracelet, similar to the first except that it\r\nbore seven disks, each differently designed, which he snapped upon\r\nSeaton's wrist as the nobles knelt and the people back of them threw\r\nthemselves upon their faces.\r\n\r\n\"No language spoken by man possesses words sufficiently weighty to\r\nexpress our indebtedness to you, Karfedix Seaton, our guest and our\r\nsavior. The First Cause has willed that you should be the instrument\r\nthrough which Kondal is this day made supreme upon Osnome.\r\n\r\nIn small and partial recognition of that instrumentality, I bestow upon\r\nyou these symbols, which proclaim you our overlord, the ultimate\r\nauthority of Osnome.\r\n\r\nWhile this is not the way in which I had thought to bid you farewell,\r\nthe obligations which you have heaped upon us render all smaller things\r\ninsignificant. When you return, as I hope and trust you soon will, the\r\ncity shall be built anew and we can welcome you as befits your station.\"\r\n\r\nLifting both arms above his head he continued:\r\n\r\n\"May the great First Cause smile upon you in all your endeavors until\r\nyou solve the Mystery: may your descendants soon reach the Ultimate\r\nGoal. Goodbye.\"\r\n\r\nSeaton uttered a few heartfelt words in response and the party stepped\r\nbackward toward the Skylark. As they reached the vessel the standing\r\nKarfedix and the ranks of kneeling nobles snapped into the double\r\nsalute--truly a rare demonstration in Kondal.\r\n\r\n\"What'll we do now?\" whispered Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"Bow, of course,\" answered Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThey bowed, deeply and slowly, and entered their vessel. As the Skylark\r\nshot into the air with the greatest acceleration that would permit its\r\npassengers to move about, the grand fleet of Kondalian warship fired a\r\ndeafening salute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt had been planned before the start that each person was to work\r\nsixteen hours out of the twenty-four. Seaton was to drive the vessel\r\nduring the first two eight-hour periods of each day. Crane was to\r\nobserve the stars during the second and to drive during the third.\r\nDuQuesne was to act as observer during the first and third periods.\r\nMargaret had volunteered to assist the observer in taking his notes\r\nduring her waking hours, and Dorothy appointed herself cook and\r\nhousehold manager.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Skylark had left Osnome, Crane told DuQuesne that he and\r\nhis wife would work in the observation room until four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, at which time the prearranged system of relief would begin,\r\nand DuQuesne retired to his room.\r\n\r\nCrane and Margaret made their way to the darkened room which housed the\r\ninstruments and seated themselves, watching intently and making no\r\neffort to conceal their emotion as first the persons beneath them, then\r\nthe giant war-vessels, and finally the ruined city itself, were lost to\r\nview. Osnome slowly assumed the proportions of a large moon, grew\r\nsmaller, and as it disappeared Crane began to take notes. For a few\r\nhours the seventeen suns of this strange solar system shone upon the\r\nflying space-car, after which they assumed the aspect of a\r\nwidely-separated cluster of enormous stars, slowly growing smaller and\r\nsmaller and shrinking closer and closer together.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon, Washington time, DuQuesne relieved\r\nCrane, who made his way to the engine room.\r\n\r\n\"It is time to change shifts, Dick. You have not had your sixteen hours,\r\nbut everything will be regular from now on. You two had better get some\r\nrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied Seaton, as he relinquished the controls to Crane,\r\nand after bidding the new helmsman goodnight he and Dorothy went below\r\nto their cabin.\r\n\r\nStanding at a window with their arms around each other they stared down\r\nwith misty eyes at the very faint green star, which was rapidly\r\ndecreasing in brilliance as the Skylark increased its already\r\ninconceivable velocity. Finally, as it disappeared altogether, Seaton\r\nturned to his wife and tenderly, lovingly, took her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Littlest Girl.... Sweetheart....\" he whispered, and paused, overcome by\r\nthe intensity of his feelings.\r\n\r\n\"I know, husband mine,\" she answered, while tears dimmed her glorious\r\neyes. \"It is too deep. With nothing but words, we can't say a single\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nThe Return to Earth\r\n\r\n\r\nDuQuesne's first act upon gaining the privacy of his own cabin was to\r\nopen the leather bag presented to him by the Karfedix. He expected to\r\nfind it filled with rare metals, with perhaps some jewels, instead of\r\nwhich the only metal present was a heavily-insulated tube containing a\r\nfull pound of metallic radium. The least valuable items in the bag were\r\nscores of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds of enormous size and of\r\nflawless perfection. Merely ornamental glass upon Osnome, Dunark knew\r\nthat they were priceless upon Earth, and had acted accordingly. To this\r\ngreat wealth of known gems, he had added a rich and varied assortment of\r\nthe rare and strange jewels peculiar to his own world, the faidon alone\r\nbeing omitted from the collection. DuQuesne's habitual calmness of mind\r\nalmost deserted him as he classified the contents of the bag.\r\n\r\nThe radium alone was worth millions of dollars, and the scientist in him\r\nexulted that at last his brother scientists should have ample supplies\r\nof that priceless metal with which to work, even while he was rejoicing\r\nin the price he would exact for it. He took out the familiar jewels,\r\nestimating their value as he counted them--a staggering total. The bag\r\nwas still half full of the strange gems, some of them glowing like\r\nminiature lamps in the dark depths, and he made no effort to appraise\r\nthem. He knew that once any competent jeweler had compared their cold,\r\nhard, scintillating beauty with that of any Earthly gems, he could\r\ndemand his own price.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" he breathed to himself, \"I will be what I have always longed\r\nto be--a money power. Now I can cut loose from that gang of crooks and\r\ngo my own way.\"\r\n\r\nHe replaced the gems and the tube of radium in the bag, which he stowed\r\naway in one of his capacious pockets, and made his way to the galley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe return voyage through space was uneventful, the Skylark constantly\r\nmaintaining the same velocity with which she had started out. Several\r\ntimes, as the days wore on, she came within the zone of attraction of\r\nvarious gigantic suns, but the pilot had learned his lesson. He kept a\r\nvigilant eye upon the bar, and at the first sign of a deviation from the\r\nperpendicular he steered away, far from the source of the attraction.\r\nNot content with these precautions, the man at the board would, from\r\ntime to time, shut off the power, to make sure that the space-car was\r\nnot falling toward a body directly in its line of flight.\r\n\r\nWhen half the distance had been covered, the bar was reversed, the\r\ntravelers holding an impromptu ceremony as the great vessel spun around\r\nits center through an angle of one hundred and eighty degrees. A few\r\ndays later the observers began to recognize some of the fixed stars in\r\nfamiliar constellations and knew that the yellowish-white star directly\r\nin their line of flight was the sun of their own solar system. After a\r\ntime they saw that their course, instead of being directly toward that\r\nrapidly-brightening star, was bearing upon a barely visible star a\r\nlittle to one side of it. Pointing their most powerful telescope toward\r\nthat point of light, Crane made out a planet, half of its disk shining\r\nbrightly. The girls hastened to peer through the telescope, and they\r\ngrew excited as they made out the familiar outlines of the continents\r\nand oceans upon the lighted portion of the disk.\r\n\r\nIt was not long until these outlines were plainly visible to the unaided\r\nvision. The Earth appeared as a great, softly shining, greenish\r\nhalf-moon, with parts of its surface obscured by fleecy wisps of cloud,\r\nand with its two gleaming ice-caps making of its poles two brilliant\r\nareas of white. The returning wanderers stared at their own world with\r\ntheir hearts in their throats as Crane, who was at the board, increased\r\nthe retarding force sufficiently to assure himself that they would not\r\nbe traveling too fast to land upon the Earth.\r\n\r\nAfter Dorothy and Margaret had gone to prepare a meal, DuQuesne turned\r\nto Seaton.\r\n\r\n\"Have you gentlemen decided what you intend to do with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We haven't discussed it yet. I can't make up my own mind what I\r\nwant to do to you, except that I sure would like to get you inside a\r\nsquare ring with four-ounce gloves on. You have been of too much real\r\nassistance on this trip for us to see you hanged, as you deserve. On the\r\nother hand, you are altogether too much of a thorough-going scoundrel\r\nfor us to let you go free. You see the fix we are in. What would you\r\nsuggest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied DuQuesne calmly. \"As I am in no danger whatever of\r\nhanging, nothing you can say on that score affects me in the least. As\r\nfor freeing me, you may do as you please--it makes no difference to me,\r\none way or the other, as no jail can hold me for a day. I can say,\r\nhowever, that while I have made a fortune on this trip, so that I do not\r\nhave to associate further with Steel unless it is to my interest to do\r\nso, I may nevertheless find it desirable at some future time to\r\nestablish a monopoly of X. That would, of course, necessitate the death\r\nof yourself and Crane. In that event, or in case any other difference\r\nshould arise between us, this whole affair will be as though it had\r\nnever existed. It will have no weight either way, whether or not you try\r\nto hang me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go as far as you like,\" Seaton answered cheerfully. \"If we're not a\r\nmatch for you and your gang, on foot or in the air, in body or in mind,\r\nwe'll deserve whatever we get. We can outrun you, outjump you, throw you\r\ndown, or lick you; we can run faster, hit harder, dive deeper, and come\r\nup dryer, than you can. We'll play any game you want to deal, whenever\r\nyou want to deal it; for fun, money, chalk, or marbles.\"\r\n\r\nHis brow darkened in anger as a thought struck him, and the steady gray\r\neyes bored into the unflinching black ones as he continued, with no\r\ntrace of his former levity in his voice:\r\n\r\n\"But listen to this. Anything goes as far as Martin and I personally are\r\nconcerned. But I want you to know that I could be arrested for what I\r\nthink of you as a man; and if any of your little schemes touch Dottie or\r\nPeggy in any way, shape or form, I'll kill you as I would a snake--or\r\nrather, I'll take you apart as I would any other piece of scientific\r\napparatus. This isn't a threat, it's a promise. Get me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nFor many hours the Earth had been obscured by clouds, so that the pilot\r\nhad only a general idea of what part of the world was beneath them, but\r\nas they dropped rapidly downward into the twilight zone, the clouds\r\nparted and they saw that they were directly over the Panama Canal.\r\nSeaton allowed the Skylark to fall to within ten miles of the ground,\r\nwhen he stopped so that Martin could get his bearings and calculate the\r\ncourse to Washington, which would be in total darkness before their\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nDuQuesne had retired, cold and reticent as usual. Glancing quickly about\r\nhis cabin to make sure that he had overlooked nothing he could take with\r\nhim, he opened a locker, exposing to view four suits which he had made\r\nin his spare time, each adapted to a particular method of escape from\r\nthe Skylark. The one he selected was of heavy canvas, braced with steel\r\nnetting, equipped with helmet and air-tanks, and attached to a strong,\r\nheavy parachute. He put it on, tested all its parts, and made his way\r\nunobserved to one of the doors in the lower part of the vessel. Thus,\r\nwhen the chance for escape came, he was ready for it. As the Skylark\r\npaused over the Isthmus, his lips parted in a sardonic smile. He opened\r\nthe door and stepped out into the air, closing the door behind him as he\r\nfell. The neutral color of the parachute was lost in the gathering\r\ntwilight a few seconds after he left the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe course laid, Seaton turned almost due north and the Skylark tore\r\nthrough the air. After a short time, when half the ground had been\r\ncovered, Seaton spoke suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Forgot about DuQuesne, Mart. We'd better iron him, hadn't we? Then\r\nwe'll decide whether we want to keep him or turn him loose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go fetch him,\" replied Crane, and turned to the stairs.\r\n\r\nHe returned shortly, with the news of the flight of the captive.\r\n\r\n\"Hm ... he must have made himself a parachute. I didn't think even he\r\nwould tackle a sixty-thousand-foot drop. I'll tell the world that he\r\nsure has established a record. I can't say I'm sorry that he got away,\r\nthough. We can get him again any time we want him, anyway, as that\r\nlittle object-compass in my drawer is still looking right at him,\" said\r\nSeaton.\r\n\r\n\"I think he earned his liberty,\" declared Dorothy, stoutly, and Margaret\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"He deserves to be shot, but I'm glad he's gone. He gives me the\r\nshivers.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the calculated time they saw the lights of a large city\r\nbeneath them, and Crane's fingers clenched upon Seaton's arm as he\r\npointed downward. There were the landing-lights of Crane Field, seven\r\npeculiarly-arranged searchlights throwing their mighty beams upward into\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\"Nine weeks, Dick,\" he said, unsteadily, \"and Shiro would have kept them\r\nburning nine years if necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe Skylark dropped easily to the ground in front of the testing shed\r\nand the wanderers leaped out, to be greeted by the half-hysterical Jap.\r\nShiro's ready vocabulary of peculiar but sonorous words failed him\r\ncompletely, and he bent himself double in a bow, his yellow face\r\nwreathed in the widest possible smile. Crane, one arm around his wife,\r\nseized Shiro's hand and wrung it in silence. Seaton swept Dorothy off\r\nher feet, pressing her slender form against his powerful body. Her arms\r\ntightened about his neck as they kissed each other fervently and he\r\nwhispered in her ear:\r\n\r\n\"Sweetheart wife, isn't it great to be back on our good old Earth\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | Transcriber's Notes & Errata                                 |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | The editorial notes associated with the three installments   |\r\n  | of the story have been placed in ASCII text boxes and        |\r\n  | incorporated at the appropriate places in the text.          |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | Illustrations have been moved to the appropriate place in    |\r\n  | the text.                                                    |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | The chemical symbol for water is represented as H2O.         |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | The following typographical errors have been corrected.      |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  |               |Error         |Correction    |                |\r\n  |               |              |              |                |\r\n  |               |plantinum     |platinum      |                |\r\n  |               |refused.      |refused.\"     |                |\r\n  |               |We            |\"We           |                |\r\n  |               |abstruce      |abstruse      |                |\r\n  |               |I love        |\"I love       |                |\r\n  |               |CHAPTE        |CHAPTER       |                |\r\n  |               |food          |fool          |                |\r\n  |               |unmistakeable |unmistakable  |                |\r\n  |               |ever          |even          |                |\r\n  |               |Mat           |Mart          |                |\r\n  |               |gravity.      |gravity.\"     |                |\r\n  |               |completely.   |completely.\"  |                |\r\n  |               |ecstacy       |ecstasy       |                |\r\n  |               |embarassment  |embarrassment |                |\r\n  |               |Naloon        |Nalboon       |                |\r\n  |               |inumerable    |innumerable   |                |\r\n  |               |but           |\"but          |                |\r\n  |               |efficient     |efficient.\"   |                |\r\n  |               |Dare          |\"Dare         |                |\r\n  |               |wit           |wait          |                |\r\n  |               |They produce  |\"They produce |                |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | Variable hyphenation                                         |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | The number of times each form appears in the text is given   |\r\n  | in parentheses.                                              |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  |           |blue-prints (2)    |blueprints (4)    |           |\r\n  |           |border-line (3)    |borderline (1)    |           |\r\n  |           |break-down (1)     |breakdown (1)     |           |\r\n  |           |devil-fish (1)     |devilfish (1)     |           |\r\n  |           |Good-bye (4)       |Goodbye (1)       |           |\r\n  |           |good-bye (4)       |goodbye (3)       |           |\r\n  |           |good-night (2)     |goodnight (2)     |           |\r\n  |           |half-way (4)       |halfway (1)       |           |\r\n  |           |hand-rail (1)      |handrail (2)      |           |\r\n  |           |hand-rails (1)     |handrails (1)     |           |\r\n  |           |home-coming (1)    |homecoming (1)    |           |\r\n  |           |major-domo (3)     |majordomo (1)     |           |\r\n  |           |near-by (1)        |nearby (4)        |           |\r\n  |           |nitro-glycerin (2) |nitroglycerin (2) |           |\r\n  |           |to-night (2)       |tonight (7)       |           |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+",
