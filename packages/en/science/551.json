  "content": "The Land that Time Forgot\r\n\r\nBy Edgar Rice Burroughs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n Chapter 1\r\n Chapter 2\r\n Chapter 3\r\n Chapter 4\r\n Chapter 5\r\n Chapter 6\r\n Chapter 7\r\n Chapter 8\r\n Chapter 9\r\n Chapter 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must have been a little after three o’clock in the afternoon that it\r\nhappened—the afternoon of June 3rd, 1916. It seems incredible that all that I\r\nhave passed through—all those weird and terrifying experiences—should have been\r\nencompassed within so short a span as three brief months. Rather might I have\r\nexperienced a cosmic cycle, with all its changes and evolutions for that which\r\nI have seen with my own eyes in this brief interval of time—things that no\r\nother mortal eye had seen before, glimpses of a world past, a world dead, a\r\nworld so long dead that even in the lowest Cambrian stratum no trace of it\r\nremains. Fused with the melting inner crust, it has passed forever beyond the\r\nken of man other than in that lost pocket of the earth whither fate has borne\r\nme and where my doom is sealed. I am here and here must remain.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this far, my interest, which already had been stimulated by the\r\nfinding of the manuscript, was approaching the boiling-point. I had come to\r\nGreenland for the summer, on the advice of my physician, and was slowly being\r\nbored to extinction, as I had thoughtlessly neglected to bring sufficient\r\nreading-matter. Being an indifferent fisherman, my enthusiasm for this form of\r\nsport soon waned; yet in the absence of other forms of recreation I was now\r\nrisking my life in an entirely inadequate boat off Cape Farewell at the\r\nsouthernmost extremity of Greenland.\r\n\r\nGreenland! As a descriptive appellation, it is a sorry joke—but my story has\r\nnothing to do with Greenland, nothing to do with me; so I shall get through\r\nwith the one and the other as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe inadequate boat finally arrived at a precarious landing, the natives,\r\nwaist-deep in the surf, assisting. I was carried ashore, and while the evening\r\nmeal was being prepared, I wandered to and fro along the rocky, shattered\r\nshore. Bits of surf-harried beach clove the worn granite, or whatever the rocks\r\nof Cape Farewell may be composed of, and as I followed the ebbing tide down one\r\nof these soft stretches, I saw the thing. Were one to bump into a Bengal tiger\r\nin the ravine behind the Bimini Baths, one could be no more surprised than was\r\nI to see a perfectly good quart thermos bottle turning and twisting in the surf\r\nof Cape Farewell at the southern extremity of Greenland. I rescued it, but I\r\nwas soaked above the knees doing it; and then I sat down in the sand and opened\r\nit, and in the long twilight read the manuscript, neatly written and tightly\r\nfolded, which was its contents.\r\n\r\nYou have read the opening paragraph, and if you are an imaginative idiot like\r\nmyself, you will want to read the rest of it; so I shall give it to you here,\r\nomitting quotation marks—which are difficult of remembrance. In two minutes you\r\nwill forget me.\r\n\r\nMy home is in Santa Monica. I am, or was, junior member of my father’s firm. We\r\nare ship-builders. Of recent years we have specialized on submarines, which we\r\nhave built for Germany, England, France and the United States. I know a sub as\r\na mother knows her baby’s face, and have commanded a score of them on their\r\ntrial runs. Yet my inclinations were all toward aviation. I graduated under\r\nCurtiss, and after a long siege with my father obtained his permission to try\r\nfor the Lafayette Escadrille. As a stepping-stone I obtained an appointment in\r\nthe American ambulance service and was on my way to France when three shrill\r\nwhistles altered, in as many seconds, my entire scheme of life.\r\n\r\nI was sitting on deck with some of the fellows who were going into the American\r\nambulance service with me, my Airedale, Crown Prince Nobbler, asleep at my\r\nfeet, when the first blast of the whistle shattered the peace and security of\r\nthe ship. Ever since entering the U-boat zone we had been on the lookout for\r\nperiscopes, and children that we were, bemoaning the unkind fate that was to\r\nsee us safely into France on the morrow without a glimpse of the dread\r\nmarauders. We were young; we craved thrills, and God knows we got them that\r\nday; yet by comparison with that through which I have since passed they were as\r\ntame as a Punch-and-Judy show.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the ashy faces of the passengers as they stampeded for\r\ntheir life-belts, though there was no panic. Nobs rose with a low growl. I\r\nrose, also, and over the ship’s side, I saw not two hundred yards distant the\r\nperiscope of a submarine, while racing toward the liner the wake of a torpedo\r\nwas distinctly visible. We were aboard an American ship—which, of course, was\r\nnot armed. We were entirely defenseless; yet without warning, we were being\r\ntorpedoed.\r\n\r\nI stood rigid, spellbound, watching the white wake of the torpedo. It struck us\r\non the starboard side almost amidships. The vessel rocked as though the sea\r\nbeneath it had been uptorn by a mighty volcano. We were thrown to the decks,\r\nbruised and stunned, and then above the ship, carrying with it fragments of\r\nsteel and wood and dismembered human bodies, rose a column of water hundreds of\r\nfeet into the air.\r\n\r\nThe silence which followed the detonation of the exploding torpedo was almost\r\nequally horrifying. It lasted for perhaps two seconds, to be followed by the\r\nscreams and moans of the wounded, the cursing of the men and the hoarse\r\ncommands of the ship’s officers. They were splendid—they and their crew. Never\r\nbefore had I been so proud of my nationality as I was that moment. In all the\r\nchaos which followed the torpedoing of the liner no officer or member of the\r\ncrew lost his head or showed in the slightest any degree of panic or fear.\r\n\r\nWhile we were attempting to lower boats, the submarine emerged and trained guns\r\non us. The officer in command ordered us to lower our flag, but this the\r\ncaptain of the liner refused to do. The ship was listing frightfully to\r\nstarboard, rendering the port boats useless, while half the starboard boats had\r\nbeen demolished by the explosion. Even while the passengers were crowding the\r\nstarboard rail and scrambling into the few boats left to us, the submarine\r\ncommenced shelling the ship. I saw one shell burst in a group of women and\r\nchildren, and then I turned my head and covered my eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen I looked again to horror was added chagrin, for with the emerging of the\r\nU-boat I had recognized her as a product of our own shipyard. I knew her to a\r\nrivet. I had superintended her construction. I had sat in that very\r\nconning-tower and directed the efforts of the sweating crew below when first\r\nher prow clove the sunny summer waters of the Pacific; and now this creature of\r\nmy brain and hand had turned _Frankenstein_, bent upon pursuing me to my\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nA second shell exploded upon the deck. One of the lifeboats, frightfully\r\novercrowded, swung at a dangerous angle from its davits. A fragment of the\r\nshell shattered the bow tackle, and I saw the women and children and the men\r\nvomited into the sea beneath, while the boat dangled stern up for a moment from\r\nits single davit, and at last with increasing momentum dived into the midst of\r\nthe struggling victims screaming upon the face of the waters.\r\n\r\nNow I saw men spring to the rail and leap into the ocean. The deck was tilting\r\nto an impossible angle. Nobs braced himself with all four feet to keep from\r\nslipping into the scuppers and looked up into my face with a questioning whine.\r\nI stooped and stroked his head.\r\n\r\n“Come on, boy!” I cried, and running to the side of the ship, dived\r\nheadforemost over the rail. When I came up, the first thing I saw was Nobs\r\nswimming about in a bewildered sort of way a few yards from me. At sight of me\r\nhis ears went flat, and his lips parted in a characteristic grin.\r\n\r\nThe submarine was withdrawing toward the north, but all the time it was\r\nshelling the open boats, three of them, loaded to the gunwales with survivors.\r\nFortunately the small boats presented a rather poor target, which, combined\r\nwith the bad marksmanship of the Germans preserved their occupants from harm;\r\nand after a few minutes a blotch of smoke appeared upon the eastern horizon and\r\nthe U-boat submerged and disappeared.\r\n\r\nAll the time the lifeboats had been pulling away from the danger of the sinking\r\nliner, and now, though I yelled at the top of my lungs, they either did not\r\nhear my appeals for help or else did not dare return to succor me. Nobs and I\r\nhad gained some little distance from the ship when it rolled completely over\r\nand sank. We were caught in the suction only enough to be drawn backward a few\r\nyards, neither of us being carried beneath the surface. I glanced hurriedly\r\nabout for something to which to cling. My eyes were directed toward the point\r\nat which the liner had disappeared when there came from the depths of the ocean\r\nthe muffled reverberation of an explosion, and almost simultaneously a geyser\r\nof water in which were shattered lifeboats, human bodies, steam, coal, oil, and\r\nthe flotsam of a liner’s deck leaped high above the surface of the sea—a watery\r\ncolumn momentarily marking the grave of another ship in this greatest cemetery\r\nof the seas.\r\n\r\nWhen the turbulent waters had somewhat subsided and the sea had ceased to spew\r\nup wreckage, I ventured to swim back in search of something substantial enough\r\nto support my weight and that of Nobs as well. I had gotten well over the area\r\nof the wreck when not a half-dozen yards ahead of me a lifeboat shot bow\r\nforemost out of the ocean almost its entire length to flop down upon its keel\r\nwith a mighty splash. It must have been carried far below, held to its mother\r\nship by a single rope which finally parted to the enormous strain put upon it.\r\nIn no other way can I account for its having leaped so far out of the water—a\r\nbeneficent circumstance to which I doubtless owe my life, and that of another\r\nfar dearer to me than my own. I say beneficent circumstance even in the face of\r\nthe fact that a fate far more hideous confronts us than that which we escaped\r\nthat day; for because of that circumstance I have met her whom otherwise I\r\nnever should have known; I have met and loved her. At least I have had that\r\ngreat happiness in life; nor can Caspak, with all her horrors, expunge that\r\nwhich has been.\r\n\r\nSo for the thousandth time I thank the strange fate which sent that lifeboat\r\nhurtling upward from the green pit of destruction to which it had been\r\ndragged—sent it far up above the surface, emptying its water as it rose above\r\nthe waves, and dropping it upon the surface of the sea, buoyant and safe.\r\n\r\nIt did not take me long to clamber over its side and drag Nobs in to\r\ncomparative safety, and then I glanced around upon the scene of death and\r\ndesolation which surrounded us. The sea was littered with wreckage among which\r\nfloated the pitiful forms of women and children, buoyed up by their useless\r\nlifebelts. Some were torn and mangled; others lay rolling quietly to the motion\r\nof the sea, their countenances composed and peaceful; others were set in\r\nhideous lines of agony or horror. Close to the boat’s side floated the figure\r\nof a girl. Her face was turned upward, held above the surface by her life-belt,\r\nand was framed in a floating mass of dark and waving hair. She was very\r\nbeautiful. I had never looked upon such perfect features, such a divine molding\r\nwhich was at the same time human—intensely human. It was a face filled with\r\ncharacter and strength and femininity—the face of one who was created to love\r\nand to be loved. The cheeks were flushed to the hue of life and health and\r\nvitality, and yet she lay there upon the bosom of the sea, dead. I felt\r\nsomething rise in my throat as I looked down upon that radiant vision, and I\r\nswore that I should live to avenge her murder.\r\n\r\nAnd then I let my eyes drop once more to the face upon the water, and what I\r\nsaw nearly tumbled me backward into the sea, for the eyes in the dead face had\r\nopened; the lips had parted; and one hand was raised toward me in a mute appeal\r\nfor succor. She lived! She was not dead! I leaned over the boat’s side and drew\r\nher quickly in to the comparative safety which God had given me. I removed her\r\nlife-belt and my soggy coat and made a pillow for her head. I chafed her hands\r\nand arms and feet. I worked over her for an hour, and at last I was rewarded by\r\na deep sigh, and again those great eyes opened and looked into mine.\r\n\r\nAt that I was all embarrassment. I have never been a ladies’ man; at\r\nLeland-Stanford I was the butt of the class because of my hopeless imbecility\r\nin the presence of a pretty girl; but the men liked me, nevertheless. I was\r\nrubbing one of her hands when she opened her eyes, and I dropped it as though\r\nit were a red-hot rivet. Those eyes took me in slowly from head to foot; then\r\nthey wandered slowly around the horizon marked by the rising and falling\r\ngunwales of the lifeboat. They looked at Nobs and softened, and then came back\r\nto me filled with questioning.\r\n\r\n“I—I—” I stammered, moving away and stumbling over the next thwart. The vision\r\nsmiled wanly.\r\n\r\n“Aye-aye, sir!” she replied faintly, and again her lips drooped, and her long\r\nlashes swept the firm, fair texture of her skin.\r\n\r\n“I hope that you are feeling better,” I finally managed to say.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” she said after a moment of silence, “I have been awake for a\r\nlong time! But I did not dare open my eyes. I thought I must be dead, and I was\r\nafraid to look, for fear that I should see nothing but blackness about me. I am\r\nafraid to die! Tell me what happened after the ship went down. I remember all\r\nthat happened before—oh, but I wish that I might forget it!” A sob broke her\r\nvoice. “The beasts!” she went on after a moment. “And to think that I was to\r\nhave married one of them—a lieutenant in the German navy.”\r\n\r\nPresently she resumed as though she had not ceased speaking. “I went down and\r\ndown and down. I thought I should never cease to sink. I felt no particular\r\ndistress until I suddenly started upward at ever-increasing velocity; then my\r\nlungs seemed about to burst, and I must have lost consciousness, for I remember\r\nnothing more until I opened my eyes after listening to a torrent of invective\r\nagainst Germany and Germans. Tell me, please, all that happened after the ship\r\nsank.”\r\n\r\nI told her, then, as well as I could, all that I had seen—the submarine\r\nshelling the open boats and all the rest of it. She thought it marvelous that\r\nwe should have been spared in so providential a manner, and I had a pretty\r\nspeech upon my tongue’s end, but lacked the nerve to deliver it. Nobs had come\r\nover and nosed his muzzle into her lap, and she stroked his ugly face, and at\r\nlast she leaned over and put her cheek against his forehead. I have always\r\nadmired Nobs; but this was the first time that it had ever occurred to me that\r\nI might wish to be Nobs. I wondered how he would take it, for he is as unused\r\nto women as I. But he took to it as a duck takes to water. What I lack of being\r\na ladies’ man, Nobs certainly makes up for as a ladies’ dog. The old scalawag\r\njust closed his eyes and put on one of the softest\r\n“sugar-wouldn’t-melt-in-my-mouth” expressions you ever saw and stood there\r\ntaking it and asking for more. It made me jealous.\r\n\r\n“You seem fond of dogs,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I am fond of this dog,” she replied.\r\n\r\nWhether she meant anything personal in that reply I did not know; but I took it\r\nas personal and it made me feel mighty good.\r\n\r\nAs we drifted about upon that vast expanse of loneliness it is not strange that\r\nwe should quickly become well acquainted. Constantly we scanned the horizon for\r\nsigns of smoke, venturing guesses as to our chances of rescue; but darkness\r\nsettled, and the black night enveloped us without ever the sight of a speck\r\nupon the waters.\r\n\r\nWe were thirsty, hungry, uncomfortable, and cold. Our wet garments had dried\r\nbut little and I knew that the girl must be in grave danger from the exposure\r\nto a night of cold and wet upon the water in an open boat, without sufficient\r\nclothing and no food. I had managed to bail all the water out of the boat with\r\ncupped hands, ending by mopping the balance up with my handkerchief—a slow and\r\nback-breaking procedure; thus I had made a comparatively dry place for the girl\r\nto lie down low in the bottom of the boat, where the sides would protect her\r\nfrom the night wind, and when at last she did so, almost overcome as she was by\r\nweakness and fatigue, I threw my wet coat over her further to thwart the chill.\r\nBut it was of no avail; as I sat watching her, the moonlight marking out the\r\ngraceful curves of her slender young body, I saw her shiver.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there something I can do?” I asked. “You can’t lie there chilled through\r\nall night. Can’t you suggest something?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “We must grin and bear it,” she replied after a moment.\r\n\r\nNobbler came and lay down on the thwart beside me, his back against my leg, and\r\nI sat staring in dumb misery at the girl, knowing in my heart of hearts that\r\nshe might die before morning came, for what with the shock and exposure, she\r\nhad already gone through enough to kill almost any woman. And as I gazed down\r\nat her, so small and delicate and helpless, there was born slowly within my\r\nbreast a new emotion. It had never been there before; now it will never cease\r\nto be there. It made me almost frantic in my desire to find some way to keep\r\nwarm the cooling lifeblood in her veins. I was cold myself, though I had almost\r\nforgotten it until Nobbler moved and I felt a new sensation of cold along my\r\nleg against which he had lain, and suddenly realized that in that one spot I\r\nhad been warm. Like a great light came the understanding of a means to warm the\r\ngirl. Immediately I knelt beside her to put my scheme into practice when\r\nsuddenly I was overwhelmed with embarrassment. Would she permit it, even if I\r\ncould muster the courage to suggest it? Then I saw her frame convulse,\r\nshudderingly, her muscles reacting to her rapidly lowering temperature, and\r\ncasting prudery to the winds, I threw myself down beside her and took her in my\r\narms, pressing her body close to mine.\r\n\r\nShe drew away suddenly, voicing a little cry of fright, and tried to push me\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me,” I managed to stammer. “It is the only way. You will die of\r\nexposure if you are not warmed, and Nobs and I are the only means we can\r\ncommand for furnishing warmth.” And I held her tightly while I called Nobs and\r\nbade him lie down at her back. The girl didn’t struggle any more when she\r\nlearned my purpose; but she gave two or three little gasps, and then began to\r\ncry softly, burying her face on my arm, and thus she fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n\r\nToward morning, I must have dozed, though it seemed to me at the time that I\r\nhad lain awake for days, instead of hours. When I finally opened my eyes, it\r\nwas daylight, and the girl’s hair was in my face, and she was breathing\r\nnormally. I thanked God for that. She had turned her head during the night so\r\nthat as I opened my eyes I saw her face not an inch from mine, my lips almost\r\ntouching hers.\r\n\r\nIt was Nobs who finally awoke her. He got up, stretched, turned around a few\r\ntimes and lay down again, and the girl opened her eyes and looked into mine.\r\nHers went very wide at first, and then slowly comprehension came to her, and\r\nshe smiled.\r\n\r\n“You have been very good to me,” she said, as I helped her to rise, though if\r\nthe truth were known I was more in need of assistance than she; the circulation\r\nall along my left side seeming to be paralyzed entirely. “You have been very\r\ngood to me.” And that was the only mention she ever made of it; yet I know that\r\nshe was thankful and that only reserve prevented her from referring to what, to\r\nsay the least, was an embarrassing situation, however unavoidable.\r\n\r\nShortly after daylight we saw smoke apparently coming straight toward us, and\r\nafter a time we made out the squat lines of a tug—one of those fearless\r\nexponents of England’s supremacy of the sea that tows sailing ships into French\r\nand English ports. I stood up on a thwart and waved my soggy coat above my\r\nhead. Nobs stood upon another and barked. The girl sat at my feet straining her\r\neyes toward the deck of the oncoming boat. “They see us,” she said at last.\r\n“There is a man answering your signal.” She was right. A lump came into my\r\nthroat—for her sake rather than for mine. She was saved, and none too soon. She\r\ncould not have lived through another night upon the Channel; she might not have\r\nlived through the coming day.\r\n\r\nThe tug came close beside us, and a man on deck threw us a rope. Willing hands\r\ndragged us to the deck, Nobs scrambling nimbly aboard without assistance. The\r\nrough men were gentle as mothers with the girl. Plying us both with questions\r\nthey hustled her to the captain’s cabin and me to the boiler-room. They told\r\nthe girl to take off her wet clothes and throw them outside the door that they\r\nmight be dried, and then to slip into the captain’s bunk and get warm. They\r\ndidn’t have to tell me to strip after I once got into the warmth of the\r\nboiler-room. In a jiffy, my clothes hung about where they might dry most\r\nquickly, and I myself was absorbing, through every pore, the welcome heat of\r\nthe stifling compartment. They brought us hot soup and coffee, and then those\r\nwho were not on duty sat around and helped me damn the Kaiser and his brood.\r\n\r\nAs soon as our clothes were dry, they bade us don them, as the chances were\r\nalways more than fair in those waters that we should run into trouble with the\r\nenemy, as I was only too well aware. What with the warmth and the feeling of\r\nsafety for the girl, and the knowledge that a little rest and food would\r\nquickly overcome the effects of her experiences of the past dismal hours, I was\r\nfeeling more content than I had experienced since those three whistle-blasts\r\nhad shattered the peace of my world the previous afternoon.\r\n\r\nBut peace upon the Channel has been but a transitory thing since August, 1914.\r\nIt proved itself such that morning, for I had scarce gotten into my dry clothes\r\nand taken the girl’s apparel to the captain’s cabin when an order was shouted\r\ndown into the engine-room for full speed ahead, and an instant later I heard\r\nthe dull boom of a gun. In a moment I was up on deck to see an enemy submarine\r\nabout two hundred yards off our port bow. She had signaled us to stop, and our\r\nskipper had ignored the order; but now she had her gun trained on us, and the\r\nsecond shot grazed the cabin, warning the belligerent tug-captain that it was\r\ntime to obey. Once again an order went down to the engine-room, and the tug\r\nreduced speed. The U-boat ceased firing and ordered the tug to come about and\r\napproach. Our momentum had carried us a little beyond the enemy craft, but we\r\nwere turning now on the arc of a circle that would bring us alongside her. As I\r\nstood watching the maneuver and wondering what was to become of us, I felt\r\nsomething touch my elbow and turned to see the girl standing at my side. She\r\nlooked up into my face with a rueful expression. “They seem bent on our\r\ndestruction,” she said, “and it looks like the same boat that sunk us\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\n“It is,” I replied. “I know her well. I helped design her and took her out on\r\nher first run.”\r\n\r\nThe girl drew back from me with a little exclamation of surprise and\r\ndisappointment. “I thought you were an American,” she said. “I had no idea you\r\nwere a—a—”\r\n\r\n“Nor am I,” I replied. “Americans have been building submarines for all nations\r\nfor many years. I wish, though, that we had gone bankrupt, my father and I,\r\nbefore ever we turned out that _Frankenstein_ of a thing.”\r\n\r\nWe were approaching the U-boat at half speed now, and I could almost\r\ndistinguish the features of the men upon her deck. A sailor stepped to my side\r\nand slipped something hard and cold into my hand. I did not have to look at it\r\nto know that it was a heavy pistol. “Tyke ’er an’ use ’er,” was all he said.\r\n\r\nOur bow was pointed straight toward the U-boat now as I heard word passed to\r\nthe engine for full speed ahead. I instantly grasped the brazen effrontery of\r\nthe plucky English skipper—he was going to ram five hundreds tons of U-boat in\r\nthe face of her trained gun. I could scarce repress a cheer. At first the\r\nboches didn’t seem to grasp his intention. Evidently they thought they were\r\nwitnessing an exhibition of poor seamanship, and they yelled their warnings to\r\nthe tug to reduce speed and throw the helm hard to port.\r\n\r\nWe were within fifty feet of them when they awakened to the intentional menace\r\nof our maneuver. Their gun crew was off its guard; but they sprang to their\r\npiece now and sent a futile shell above our heads. Nobs leaped about and barked\r\nfuriously. “Let ’em have it!” commanded the tug-captain, and instantly\r\nrevolvers and rifles poured bullets upon the deck of the submersible. Two of\r\nthe gun-crew went down; the other trained their piece at the water-line of the\r\noncoming tug. The balance of those on deck replied to our small-arms fire,\r\ndirecting their efforts toward the man at our wheel.\r\n\r\nI hastily pushed the girl down the companionway leading to the engine-room, and\r\nthen I raised my pistol and fired my first shot at a boche. What happened in\r\nthe next few seconds happened so quickly that details are rather blurred in my\r\nmemory. I saw the helmsman lunge forward upon the wheel, pulling the helm\r\naround so that the tug sheered off quickly from her course, and I recall\r\nrealizing that all our efforts were to be in vain, because of all the men\r\naboard, Fate had decreed that this one should fall first to an enemy bullet. I\r\nsaw the depleted gun-crew on the submarine fire their piece and I felt the\r\nshock of impact and heard the loud explosion as the shell struck and exploded\r\nin our bows.\r\n\r\nI saw and realized these things even as I was leaping into the pilot-house and\r\ngrasping the wheel, standing astride the dead body of the helmsman. With all my\r\nstrength I threw the helm to starboard; but it was too late to effect the\r\npurpose of our skipper. The best I did was to scrape alongside the sub. I heard\r\nsomeone shriek an order into the engine-room; the boat shuddered and trembled\r\nto the sudden reversing of the engines, and our speed quickly lessened. Then I\r\nsaw what that madman of a skipper planned since his first scheme had gone\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nWith a loud-yelled command, he leaped to the slippery deck of the submersible,\r\nand at his heels came his hardy crew. I sprang from the pilot-house and\r\nfollowed, not to be left out in the cold when it came to strafing the boches.\r\nFrom the engine room companionway came the engineer and stockers, and together\r\nwe leaped after the balance of the crew and into the hand-to-hand fight that\r\nwas covering the wet deck with red blood. Beside me came Nobs, silent now, and\r\ngrim. Germans were emerging from the open hatch to take part in the battle on\r\ndeck. At first the pistols cracked amidst the cursing of the men and the loud\r\ncommands of the commander and his junior; but presently we were too\r\nindiscriminately mixed to make it safe to use our firearms, and the battle\r\nresolved itself into a hand-to-hand struggle for possession of the deck.\r\n\r\nThe sole aim of each of us was to hurl one of the opposing force into the sea.\r\nI shall never forget the hideous expression upon the face of the great Prussian\r\nwith whom chance confronted me. He lowered his head and rushed at me, bellowing\r\nlike a bull. With a quick side-step and ducking low beneath his outstretched\r\narms, I eluded him; and as he turned to come back at me, I landed a blow upon\r\nhis chin which sent him spinning toward the edge of the deck. I saw his wild\r\nendeavors to regain his equilibrium; I saw him reel drunkenly for an instant\r\nupon the brink of eternity and then, with a loud scream, slip into the sea. At\r\nthe same instant a pair of giant arms encircled me from behind and lifted me\r\nentirely off my feet. Kick and squirm as I would, I could neither turn toward\r\nmy antagonist nor free myself from his maniacal grasp. Relentlessly he was\r\nrushing me toward the side of the vessel and death. There was none to stay him,\r\nfor each of my companions was more than occupied by from one to three of the\r\nenemy. For an instant I was fearful for myself, and then I saw that which\r\nfilled me with a far greater terror for another.\r\n\r\nMy boche was bearing me toward the side of the submarine against which the tug\r\nwas still pounding. That I should be ground to death between the two was lost\r\nupon me as I saw the girl standing alone upon the tug’s deck, as I saw the\r\nstern high in air and the bow rapidly settling for the final dive, as I saw\r\ndeath from which I could not save her clutching at the skirts of the woman I\r\nnow knew all too well that I loved.\r\n\r\nI had perhaps the fraction of a second longer to live when I heard an angry\r\ngrowl behind us mingle with a cry of pain and rage from the giant who carried\r\nme. Instantly he went backward to the deck, and as he did so he threw his arms\r\noutwards to save himself, freeing me. I fell heavily upon him, but was upon my\r\nfeet in the instant. As I arose, I cast a single glance at my opponent. Never\r\nagain would he menace me or another, for Nob’s great jaws had closed upon his\r\nthroat. Then I sprang toward the edge of the deck closest to the girl upon the\r\nsinking tug.\r\n\r\n“Jump!” I cried. “Jump!” And I held out my arms to her. Instantly as though\r\nwith implicit confidence in my ability to save her, she leaped over the side of\r\nthe tug onto the sloping, slippery side of the U-boat. I reached far over to\r\nseize her hand. At the same instant the tug pointed its stern straight toward\r\nthe sky and plunged out of sight. My hand missed the girl’s by a fraction of an\r\ninch, and I saw her slip into the sea; but scarce had she touched the water\r\nwhen I was in after her.\r\n\r\nThe sinking tug drew us far below the surface; but I had seized her the moment\r\nI struck the water, and so we went down together, and together we came up—a few\r\nyards from the U-boat. The first thing I heard was Nobs barking furiously;\r\nevidently he had missed me and was searching. A single glance at the vessel’s\r\ndeck assured me that the battle was over and that we had been victorious, for I\r\nsaw our survivors holding a handful of the enemy at pistol points while one by\r\none the rest of the crew was coming out of the craft’s interior and lining up\r\non deck with the other prisoners.\r\n\r\nAs I swam toward the submarine with the girl, Nobs’ persistent barking\r\nattracted the attention of some of the tug’s crew, so that as soon as we\r\nreached the side there were hands to help us aboard. I asked the girl if she\r\nwas hurt, but she assured me that she was none the worse for this second\r\nwetting; nor did she seem to suffer any from shock. I was to learn for myself\r\nthat this slender and seemingly delicate creature possessed the heart and\r\ncourage of a warrior.\r\n\r\nAs we joined our own party, I found the tug’s mate checking up our survivors.\r\nThere were ten of us left, not including the girl. Our brave skipper was\r\nmissing, as were eight others. There had been nineteen of us in the attacking\r\nparty and we had accounted in one way and another during the battle for sixteen\r\nGermans and had taken nine prisoners, including the commander. His lieutenant\r\nhad been killed.\r\n\r\n“Not a bad day’s work,” said Bradley, the mate, when he had completed his roll.\r\n“Only losing the skipper,” he added, “was the worst. He was a fine man, a fine\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nOlson—who in spite of his name was Irish, and in spite of his not being Scotch\r\nhad been the tug’s engineer—was standing with Bradley and me. “Yis,” he agreed,\r\n“it’s a day’s wor-rk we’re after doin’, but what are we goin’ to be doin’ wid\r\nit now we got it?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll run her into the nearest English port,” said Bradley, “and then we’ll\r\nall go ashore and get our V. C.’s,” he concluded, laughing.\r\n\r\n“How you goin’ to run her?” queried Olson. “You can’t trust these Dutchmen.”\r\n\r\nBradley scratched his head. “I guess you’re right,” he admitted. “And I don’t\r\nknow the first thing about a sub.”\r\n\r\n“I do,” I assured him. “I know more about this particular sub than the officer\r\nwho commanded her.”\r\n\r\nBoth men looked at me in astonishment, and then I had to explain all over again\r\nas I had explained to the girl. Bradley and Olson were delighted. Immediately I\r\nwas put in command, and the first thing I did was to go below with Olson and\r\ninspect the craft thoroughly for hidden boches and damaged machinery. There\r\nwere no Germans below, and everything was intact and in ship-shape working\r\norder. I then ordered all hands below except one man who was to act as lookout.\r\nQuestioning the Germans, I found that all except the commander were willing to\r\nresume their posts and aid in bringing the vessel into an English port. I\r\nbelieve that they were relieved at the prospect of being detained at a\r\ncomfortable English prison-camp for the duration of the war after the perils\r\nand privations through which they had passed. The officer, however, assured me\r\nthat he would never be a party to the capture of his vessel.\r\n\r\nThere was, therefore, nothing to do but put the man in irons. As we were\r\npreparing to put this decision into force, the girl descended from the deck. It\r\nwas the first time that she or the German officer had seen each other’s faces\r\nsince we had boarded the U-boat. I was assisting the girl down the ladder and\r\nstill retained a hold upon her arm—possibly after such support was no longer\r\nnecessary—when she turned and looked squarely into the face of the German. Each\r\nvoiced a sudden exclamation of surprise and dismay.\r\n\r\n“Lys!” he cried, and took a step toward her.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s eyes went wide, and slowly filled with a great horror, as she shrank\r\nback. Then her slender figure stiffened to the erectness of a soldier, and with\r\nchin in air and without a word she turned her back upon the officer.\r\n\r\n“Take him away,” I directed the two men who guarded him, “and put him in\r\nirons.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, the girl raised her eyes to mine. “He is the German of whom I\r\nspoke,” she said. “He is Baron von Schoenvorts.”\r\n\r\nI merely inclined my head. She had loved him! I wondered if in her heart of\r\nhearts she did not love him yet. Immediately I became insanely jealous. I hated\r\nBaron Friedrich von Schoenvorts with such utter intensity that the emotion\r\nthrilled me with a species of exaltation.\r\n\r\nBut I didn’t have much chance to enjoy my hatred then, for almost immediately\r\nthe lookout poked his face over the hatchway and bawled down that there was\r\nsmoke on the horizon, dead ahead. Immediately I went on deck to investigate,\r\nand Bradley came with me.\r\n\r\n“If she’s friendly,” he said, “we’ll speak her. If she’s not, we’ll sink\r\nher—eh, captain?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, lieutenant,” I replied, and it was his turn to smile.\r\n\r\nWe hoisted the Union Jack and remained on deck, asking Bradley to go below and\r\nassign to each member of the crew his duty, placing one Englishman with a\r\npistol beside each German.\r\n\r\n“Half speed ahead,” I commanded.\r\n\r\nMore rapidly now we closed the distance between ourselves and the stranger,\r\nuntil I could plainly see the red ensign of the British merchant marine. My\r\nheart swelled with pride at the thought that presently admiring British tars\r\nwould be congratulating us upon our notable capture; and just about then the\r\nmerchant steamer must have sighted us, for she veered suddenly toward the\r\nnorth, and a moment later dense volumes of smoke issued from her funnels. Then,\r\nsteering a zigzag course, she fled from us as though we had been the bubonic\r\nplague. I altered the course of the submarine and set off in chase; but the\r\nsteamer was faster than we, and soon left us hopelessly astern.\r\n\r\nWith a rueful smile, I directed that our original course be resumed, and once\r\nagain we set off toward merry England. That was three months ago, and we\r\nhaven’t arrived yet; nor is there any likelihood that we ever shall.\r\n\r\nThe steamer we had just sighted must have wirelessed a warning, for it wasn’t\r\nhalf an hour before we saw more smoke on the horizon, and this time the vessel\r\nflew the white ensign of the Royal Navy and carried guns. She didn’t veer to\r\nthe north or anywhere else, but bore down on us rapidly. I was just preparing\r\nto signal her, when a flame flashed from her bows, and an instant later the\r\nwater in front of us was thrown high by the explosion of a shell.\r\n\r\nBradley had come on deck and was standing beside me. “About one more of those,\r\nand she’ll have our range,” he said. “She doesn’t seem to take much stock in\r\nour Union Jack.”\r\n\r\nA second shell passed over us, and then I gave the command to change our\r\ndirection, at the same time directing Bradley to go below and give the order to\r\nsubmerge. I passed Nobs down to him, and following, saw to the closing and\r\nfastening of the hatch.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that the diving-tanks never had filled so slowly. We heard a\r\nloud explosion apparently directly above us; the craft trembled to the shock\r\nwhich threw us all to the deck. I expected momentarily to feel the deluge of\r\ninrushing water, but none came. Instead we continued to submerge until the\r\nmanometer registered forty feet and then I knew that we were safe. Safe! I\r\nalmost smiled. I had relieved Olson, who had remained in the tower at my\r\ndirection, having been a member of one of the early British submarine crews,\r\nand therefore having some knowledge of the business. Bradley was at my side. He\r\nlooked at me quizzically.\r\n\r\n“What the devil are we to do?” he asked. “The merchantman will flee us; the\r\nwar-vessel will destroy us; neither will believe our colors or give us a chance\r\nto explain. We will meet even a worse reception if we go nosing around a\r\nBritish port—mines, nets and all of it. We can’t do it.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s try it again when this fellow has lost the scent,” I urged. “There must\r\ncome a ship that will believe us.”\r\n\r\nAnd try it again we did, only to be almost rammed by a huge freighter. Later we\r\nwere fired upon by a destroyer, and two merchantmen turned and fled at our\r\napproach. For two days we cruised up and down the Channel trying to tell some\r\none, who would listen, that we were friends; but no one would listen. After our\r\nencounter with the first warship I had given instructions that a wireless\r\nmessage be sent out explaining our predicament; but to my chagrin I discovered\r\nthat both sending and receiving instruments had disappeared.\r\n\r\n“There is only one place you can go,” von Schoenvorts sent word to me, “and\r\nthat is Kiel. You can’t land anywhere else in these waters. If you wish, I will\r\ntake you there, and I can promise that you will be treated well.”\r\n\r\n“There is another place we can go,” I sent back my reply, “and we will before\r\nwe’ll go to Germany. That place is hell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n\r\nThose were anxious days, during which I had but little opportunity to associate\r\nwith Lys. I had given her the commander’s room, Bradley and I taking that of\r\nthe deck-officer, while Olson and two of our best men occupied the room\r\nordinarily allotted to petty officers. I made Nobs’ bed down in Lys’ room, for\r\nI knew she would feel less alone.\r\n\r\nNothing of much moment occurred for a while after we left British waters behind\r\nus. We ran steadily along upon the surface, making good time. The first two\r\nboats we sighted made off as fast as they could go; and the third, a huge\r\nfreighter, fired on us, forcing us to submerge. It was after this that our\r\ntroubles commenced. One of the Diesel engines broke down in the morning, and\r\nwhile we were working on it, the forward port diving-tank commenced to fill. I\r\nwas on deck at the time and noted the gradual list. Guessing at once what was\r\nhappening, I leaped for the hatch and slamming it closed above my head, dropped\r\nto the centrale. By this time the craft was going down by the head with a most\r\nunpleasant list to port, and I didn’t wait to transmit orders to some one else\r\nbut ran as fast as I could for the valve that let the sea into the forward port\r\ndiving-tank. It was wide open. To close it and to have the pump started that\r\nwould empty it were the work of but a minute; but we had had a close call.\r\n\r\nI knew that the valve had never opened itself. Some one had opened it—some one\r\nwho was willing to die himself if he might at the same time encompass the death\r\nof all of us.\r\n\r\nAfter that I kept a guard pacing the length of the narrow craft. We worked upon\r\nthe engine all that day and night and half the following day. Most of the time\r\nwe drifted idly upon the surface, but toward noon we sighted smoke due west,\r\nand having found that only enemies inhabited the world for us, I ordered that\r\nthe other engine be started so that we could move out of the path of the\r\noncoming steamer. The moment the engine started to turn, however, there was a\r\ngrinding sound of tortured steel, and when it had been stopped, we found that\r\nsome one had placed a cold-chisel in one of the gears.\r\n\r\nIt was another two days before we were ready to limp along, half repaired. The\r\nnight before the repairs were completed, the sentry came to my room and awoke\r\nme. He was rather an intelligent fellow of the English middle class, in whom I\r\nhad much confidence.\r\n\r\n“Well, Wilson,” I asked. “What’s the matter now?”\r\n\r\nHe raised his finger to his lips and came closer to me. “I think I’ve found out\r\nwho’s doin’ the mischief,” he whispered, and nodded his head toward the girl’s\r\nroom. “I seen her sneakin’ from the crew’s room just now,” he went on. “She’d\r\nbeen in gassin’ wit’ the boche commander. Benson seen her in there las’ night,\r\ntoo, but he never said nothin’ till I goes on watch tonight. Benson’s sorter\r\nslow in the head, an’ he never puts two an’ two together till some one else has\r\nmade four out of it.”\r\n\r\nIf the man had come in and struck me suddenly in the face, I could have been no\r\nmore surprised.\r\n\r\n“Say nothing of this to anyone,” I ordered. “Keep your eyes and ears open and\r\nreport every suspicious thing you see or hear.”\r\n\r\nThe man saluted and left me; but for an hour or more I tossed, restless, upon\r\nmy hard bunk in an agony of jealousy and fear. Finally I fell into a troubled\r\nsleep. It was daylight when I awoke. We were steaming along slowly upon the\r\nsurface, my orders having been to proceed at half speed until we could take an\r\nobservation and determine our position. The sky had been overcast all the\r\nprevious day and all night; but as I stepped into the centrale that morning I\r\nwas delighted to see that the sun was again shining. The spirits of the men\r\nseemed improved; everything seemed propitious. I forgot at once the cruel\r\nmisgivings of the past night as I set to work to take my observations.\r\n\r\nWhat a blow awaited me! The sextant and chronometer had both been broken beyond\r\nrepair, and they had been broken just this very night. They had been broken\r\nupon the night that Lys had been seen talking with von Schoenvorts. I think\r\nthat it was this last thought which hurt me the worst. I could look the other\r\ndisaster in the face with equanimity; but the bald fact that Lys might be a\r\ntraitor appalled me.\r\n\r\nI called Bradley and Olson on deck and told them what had happened, but for the\r\nlife of me I couldn’t bring myself to repeat what Wilson had reported to me the\r\nprevious night. In fact, as I had given the matter thought, it seemed\r\nincredible that the girl could have passed through my room, in which Bradley\r\nand I slept, and then carried on a conversation in the crew’s room, in which\r\nVon Schoenvorts was kept, without having been seen by more than a single man.\r\n\r\nBradley shook his head. “I can’t make it out,” he said. “One of those boches\r\nmust be pretty clever to come it over us all like this; but they haven’t harmed\r\nus as much as they think; there are still the extra instruments.”\r\n\r\nIt was my turn now to shake a doleful head. “There are no extra instruments,” I\r\ntold them. “They too have disappeared as did the wireless apparatus.”\r\n\r\nBoth men looked at me in amazement. “We still have the compass and the sun,”\r\nsaid Olson. “They may be after getting the compass some night; but they’s too\r\nmany of us around in the daytime fer ’em to get the sun.”\r\n\r\nIt was then that one of the men stuck his head up through the hatchway and\r\nseeing me, asked permission to come on deck and get a breath of fresh air. I\r\nrecognized him as Benson, the man who, Wilson had said, reported having seen\r\nLys with von Schoenvorts two nights before. I motioned him on deck and then\r\ncalled him to one side, asking if he had seen anything out of the way or\r\nunusual during his trick on watch the night before. The fellow scratched his\r\nhead a moment and said, “No,” and then as though it was an afterthought, he\r\ntold me that he had seen the girl in the crew’s room about midnight talking\r\nwith the German commander, but as there hadn’t seemed to him to be any harm in\r\nthat, he hadn’t said anything about it. Telling him never to fail to report to\r\nme anything in the slightest out of the ordinary routine of the ship, I\r\ndismissed him.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the other men now asked permission to come on deck, and soon all but\r\nthose actually engaged in some necessary duty were standing around smoking and\r\ntalking, all in the best of spirits. I took advantage of the absence of the men\r\nupon the deck to go below for my breakfast, which the cook was already\r\npreparing upon the electric stove. Lys, followed by Nobs, appeared as I entered\r\nthe centrale. She met me with a pleasant “Good morning!” which I am afraid I\r\nreplied to in a tone that was rather constrained and surly.\r\n\r\n“Will you breakfast with me?” I suddenly asked the girl, determined to commence\r\na probe of my own along the lines which duty demanded.\r\n\r\nShe nodded a sweet acceptance of my invitation, and together we sat down at the\r\nlittle table of the officers’ mess.\r\n\r\n“You slept well last night?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“All night,” she replied. “I am a splendid sleeper.”\r\n\r\nHer manner was so straightforward and honest that I could not bring myself to\r\nbelieve in her duplicity; yet—Thinking to surprise her into a betrayal of her\r\nguilt, I blurted out: “The chronometer and sextant were both destroyed last\r\nnight; there is a traitor among us.” But she never turned a hair by way of\r\nevidencing guilty knowledge of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\n“Who could it have been?” she cried. “The Germans would be crazy to do it, for\r\ntheir lives are as much at stake as ours.”\r\n\r\n“Men are often glad to die for an ideal—an ideal of patriotism, perhaps,” I\r\nreplied; “and a willingness to martyr themselves includes a willingness to\r\nsacrifice others, even those who love them. Women are much the same, except\r\nthat they will go even further than most men—they will sacrifice everything,\r\neven honor, for love.”\r\n\r\nI watched her face carefully as I spoke, and I thought that I detected a very\r\nfaint flush mounting her cheek. Seeing an opening and an advantage, I sought to\r\nfollow it up.\r\n\r\n“Take von Schoenvorts, for instance,” I continued: “he would doubtless be glad\r\nto die and take us all with him, could he prevent in no other way the falling\r\nof his vessel into enemy hands. He would sacrifice anyone, even you; and if you\r\nstill love him, you might be his ready tool. Do you understand me?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me in wide-eyed consternation for a moment, and then she went\r\nvery white and rose from her seat. “I do,” she replied, and turning her back\r\nupon me, she walked quickly toward her room. I started to follow, for even\r\nbelieving what I did, I was sorry that I had hurt her. I reached the door to\r\nthe crew’s room just behind her and in time to see von Schoenvorts lean forward\r\nand whisper something to her as she passed; but she must have guessed that she\r\nmight be watched, for she passed on.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon it clouded over; the wind mounted to a gale, and the sea rose\r\nuntil the craft was wallowing and rolling frightfully. Nearly everyone aboard\r\nwas sick; the air became foul and oppressive. For twenty-four hours I did not\r\nleave my post in the conning tower, as both Olson and Bradley were sick.\r\nFinally I found that I must get a little rest, and so I looked about for some\r\none to relieve me. Benson volunteered. He had not been sick, and assured me\r\nthat he was a former R.N. man and had been detailed for submarine duty for over\r\ntwo years. I was glad that it was he, for I had considerable confidence in his\r\nloyalty, and so it was with a feeling of security that I went below and lay\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nI slept twelve hours straight, and when I awoke and discovered what I had done,\r\nI lost no time in getting to the conning tower. There sat Benson as wide awake\r\nas could be, and the compass showed that we were heading straight into the\r\nwest. The storm was still raging; nor did it abate its fury until the fourth\r\nday. We were all pretty well done up and looked forward to the time when we\r\ncould go on deck and fill our lungs with fresh air. During the whole four days\r\nI had not seen the girl, as she evidently kept closely to her room; and during\r\nthis time no untoward incident had occurred aboard the boat—a fact which seemed\r\nto strengthen the web of circumstantial evidence about her.\r\n\r\nFor six more days after the storm lessened we still had fairly rough weather;\r\nnor did the sun once show himself during all that time. For the season—it was\r\nnow the middle of June—the storm was unusual; but being from southern\r\nCalifornia, I was accustomed to unusual weather. In fact, I have discovered\r\nthat the world over, unusual weather prevails at all times of the year.\r\n\r\nWe kept steadily to our westward course, and as the _U_-33 was one of the\r\nfastest submersibles we had ever turned out, I knew that we must be pretty\r\nclose to the North American coast. What puzzled me most was the fact that for\r\nsix days we had not sighted a single ship. It seemed remarkable that we could\r\ncross the Atlantic almost to the coast of the American continent without\r\nglimpsing smoke or sail, and at last I came to the conclusion that we were way\r\noff our course, but whether to the north or to the south of it I could not\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day the sea lay comparatively calm at early dawn. There was a\r\nslight haze upon the ocean which had cut off our view of the stars; but\r\nconditions all pointed toward a clear morrow, and I was on deck anxiously\r\nawaiting the rising of the sun. My eyes were glued upon the impenetrable mist\r\nastern, for there in the east I should see the first glow of the rising sun\r\nthat would assure me we were still upon the right course. Gradually the heavens\r\nlightened; but astern I could see no intenser glow that would indicate the\r\nrising sun behind the mist. Bradley was standing at my side. Presently he\r\ntouched my arm.\r\n\r\n“Look, captain,” he said, and pointed south.\r\n\r\nI looked and gasped, for there directly to port I saw outlined through the haze\r\nthe red top of the rising sun. Hurrying to the tower, I looked at the compass.\r\nIt showed that we were holding steadily upon our westward course. Either the\r\nsun was rising in the south, or the compass had been tampered with. The\r\nconclusion was obvious.\r\n\r\nI went back to Bradley and told him what I had discovered. “And,” I concluded,\r\n“we can’t make another five hundred knots without oil; our provisions are\r\nrunning low and so is our water. God only knows how far south we have run.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to do,” he replied, “other than to alter our course once more\r\ntoward the west; we must raise land soon or we shall all be lost.”\r\n\r\nI told him to do so; and then I set to work improvising a crude sextant with\r\nwhich we finally took our bearings in a rough and most unsatisfactory manner;\r\nfor when the work was done, we did not know how far from the truth the result\r\nmight be. It showed us to be about 20° north and 30° west—nearly\r\ntwenty-five hundred miles off our course. In short, if our reading was anywhere\r\nnear correct, we must have been traveling due south for six days. Bradley now\r\nrelieved Benson, for we had arranged our shifts so that the latter and Olson\r\nnow divided the nights, while Bradley and I alternated with one another during\r\nthe days.\r\n\r\nI questioned both Olson and Benson closely in the matter of the compass; but\r\neach stoutly maintained that no one had tampered with it during his tour of\r\nduty. Benson gave me a knowing smile, as much as to say: “Well, you and I know\r\nwho did this.” Yet I could not believe that it was the girl.\r\n\r\nWe kept to our westerly course for several hours when the lookout’s cry\r\nannounced a sail. I ordered the _U_-33’s course altered, and we bore down\r\nupon the stranger, for I had come to a decision which was the result of\r\nnecessity. We could not lie there in the middle of the Atlantic and starve to\r\ndeath if there was any way out of it. The sailing ship saw us while we were\r\nstill a long way off, as was evidenced by her efforts to escape. There was\r\nscarcely any wind, however, and her case was hopeless; so when we drew near and\r\nsignaled her to stop, she came into the wind and lay there with her sails\r\nflapping idly. We moved in quite close to her. She was the _Balmen_ of\r\nHalmstad, Sweden, with a general cargo from Brazil for Spain.\r\n\r\nI explained our circumstances to her skipper and asked for food, water and oil;\r\nbut when he found that we were not German, he became very angry and abusive and\r\nstarted to draw away from us; but I was in no mood for any such business.\r\nTurning toward Bradley, who was in the conning-tower, I snapped out:\r\n“Gun-service on deck! To the diving stations!” We had no opportunity for drill;\r\nbut every man had been posted as to his duties, and the German members of the\r\ncrew understood that it was obedience or death for them, as each was\r\naccompanied by a man with a pistol. Most of them, though, were only too glad to\r\nobey me.\r\n\r\nBradley passed the order down into the ship and a moment later the gun-crew\r\nclambered up the narrow ladder and at my direction trained their piece upon the\r\nslow-moving Swede. “Fire a shot across her bow,” I instructed the gun-captain.\r\n\r\nAccept it from me, it didn’t take that Swede long to see the error of his way\r\nand get the red and white pennant signifying “I understand” to the masthead.\r\nOnce again the sails flapped idly, and then I ordered him to lower a boat and\r\ncome after me. With Olson and a couple of the Englishmen I boarded the ship,\r\nand from her cargo selected what we needed—oil, provisions and water. I gave\r\nthe master of the _Balmen_ a receipt for what we took, together with an\r\naffidavit signed by Bradley, Olson, and myself, stating briefly how we had come\r\ninto possession of the _U_-33 and the urgency of our need for what we\r\ntook. We addressed both to any British agent with the request that the owners\r\nof the _Balmen_ be reimbursed; but whether or not they were, I do not\r\nknow.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Late in July, 1916, an item in the shipping news mentioned a Swedish\r\nsailing vessel, _Balmen_, Rio de Janeiro to Barcelona, sunk by a German\r\nraider sometime in June. A single survivor in an open boat was picked up off\r\nthe Cape Verde Islands, in a dying condition. He expired without giving any\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith water, food, and oil aboard, we felt that we had obtained a new lease of\r\nlife. Now, too, we knew definitely where we were, and I determined to make for\r\nGeorgetown, British Guiana—but I was destined to again suffer bitter\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nSix of us of the loyal crew had come on deck either to serve the gun or board\r\nthe Swede during our set-to with her; and now, one by one, we descended the\r\nladder into the centrale. I was the last to come, and when I reached the\r\nbottom, I found myself looking into the muzzle of a pistol in the hands of\r\nBaron Friedrich von Schoenvorts—I saw all my men lined up at one side with the\r\nremaining eight Germans standing guard over them.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t imagine how it had happened; but it had. Later I learned that they\r\nhad first overpowered Benson, who was asleep in his bunk, and taken his pistol\r\nfrom him, and then had found it an easy matter to disarm the cook and the\r\nremaining two Englishmen below. After that it had been comparatively simple to\r\nstand at the foot of the ladder and arrest each individual as he descended.\r\n\r\nThe first thing von Schoenvorts did was to send for me and announce that as a\r\npirate I was to be shot early the next morning. Then he explained that the\r\n_U_-33 would cruise in these waters for a time, sinking neutral and enemy\r\nshipping indiscriminately, and looking for one of the German raiders that was\r\nsupposed to be in these parts.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t shoot me the next morning as he had promised, and it has never been\r\nclear to me why he postponed the execution of my sentence. Instead he kept me\r\nironed just as he had been; then he kicked Bradley out of my room and took it\r\nall to himself.\r\n\r\nWe cruised for a long time, sinking many vessels, all but one by gunfire, but\r\nwe did not come across a German raider. I was surprised to note that von\r\nSchoenvorts often permitted Benson to take command; but I reconciled this by\r\nthe fact that Benson appeared to know more of the duties of a submarine\r\ncommander than did any of the stupid Germans.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Lys passed me; but for the most part she kept to her room. The\r\nfirst time she hesitated as though she wished to speak to me; but I did not\r\nraise my head, and finally she passed on. Then one day came the word that we\r\nwere about to round the Horn and that von Schoenvorts had taken it into his\r\nfool head to cruise up along the Pacific coast of North America and prey upon\r\nall sorts and conditions of merchantmen.\r\n\r\n“I’ll put the fear of God and the Kaiser into them,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe very first day we entered the South Pacific we had an adventure. It turned\r\nout to be quite the most exciting adventure I had ever encountered. It fell\r\nabout this way. About eight bells of the forenoon watch I heard a hail from the\r\ndeck, and presently the footsteps of the entire ship’s company, from the amount\r\nof noise I heard at the ladder. Some one yelled back to those who had not yet\r\nreached the level of the deck: “It’s the raider, the German raider\r\n_Geier!_”\r\n\r\nI saw that we had reached the end of our rope. Below all was quiet—not a man\r\nremained. A door opened at the end of the narrow hull, and presently Nobs came\r\ntrotting up to me. He licked my face and rolled over on his back, reaching for\r\nme with his big, awkward paws. Then other footsteps sounded, approaching me. I\r\nknew whose they were, and I looked straight down at the flooring. The girl was\r\ncoming almost at a run—she was at my side immediately. “Here!” she cried.\r\n“Quick!” And she slipped something into my hand. It was a key—the key to my\r\nirons. At my side she also laid a pistol, and then she went on into the\r\ncentrale. As she passed me, I saw that she carried another pistol for herself.\r\nIt did not take me long to liberate myself, and then I was at her side. “How\r\ncan I thank you?” I started; but she shut me up with a word.\r\n\r\n“Do not thank me,” she said coldly. “I do not care to hear your thanks or any\r\nother expression from you. Do not stand there looking at me. I have given you a\r\nchance to do something—now do it!” The last was a peremptory command that made\r\nme jump.\r\n\r\nGlancing up, I saw that the tower was empty, and I lost no time in clambering\r\nup, looking about me. About a hundred yards off lay a small, swift\r\ncruiser-raider, and above her floated the German man-of-war’s flag. A boat had\r\njust been lowered, and I could see it moving toward us filled with officers and\r\nmen. The cruiser lay dead ahead. “My,” I thought, “what a wonderful targ—” I\r\nstopped even thinking, so surprised and shocked was I by the boldness of my\r\nimagery. The girl was just below me. I looked down on her wistfully. Could I\r\ntrust her? Why had she released me at this moment? I must! I must! There was no\r\nother way. I dropped back below. “Ask Olson to step down here, please,” I\r\nrequested; “and don’t let anyone see you ask him.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with a puzzled expression on her face for the barest fraction\r\nof a second, and then she turned and went up the ladder. A moment later Olson\r\nreturned, and the girl followed him. “Quick!” I whispered to the big Irishman,\r\nand made for the bow compartment where the torpedo-tubes are built into the\r\nboat; here, too, were the torpedoes. The girl accompanied us, and when she saw\r\nthe thing I had in mind, she stepped forward and lent a hand to the swinging of\r\nthe great cylinder of death and destruction into the mouth of its tube. With\r\noil and main strength we shoved the torpedo home and shut the tube; then I ran\r\nback to the conning-tower, praying in my heart of hearts that the _U_-33\r\nhad not swung her bow away from the prey. No, thank God!\r\n\r\nNever could aim have been truer. I signaled back to Olson: “Let ’er go!” The\r\n_U_-33 trembled from stem to stern as the torpedo shot from its tube. I\r\nsaw the white wake leap from her bow straight toward the enemy cruiser. A\r\nchorus of hoarse yells arose from the deck of our own craft: I saw the officers\r\nstand suddenly erect in the boat that was approaching us, and I heard loud\r\ncries and curses from the raider. Then I turned my attention to my own\r\nbusiness. Most of the men on the submarine’s deck were standing in paralyzed\r\nfascination, staring at the torpedo. Bradley happened to be looking toward the\r\nconning-tower and saw me. I sprang on deck and ran toward him. “Quick!” I\r\nwhispered. “While they are stunned, we must overcome them.”\r\n\r\nA German was standing near Bradley—just in front of him. The Englishman struck\r\nthe fellow a frantic blow upon the neck and at the same time snatched his\r\npistol from its holster. Von Schoenvorts had recovered from his first surprise\r\nquickly and had turned toward the main hatch to investigate. I covered him with\r\nmy revolver, and at the same instant the torpedo struck the raider, the\r\nterrific explosion drowning the German’s command to his men.\r\n\r\nBradley was now running from one to another of our men, and though some of the\r\nGermans saw and heard him, they seemed too stunned for action.\r\n\r\nOlson was below, so that there were only nine of us against eight Germans, for\r\nthe man Bradley had struck still lay upon the deck. Only two of us were armed;\r\nbut the heart seemed to have gone out of the boches, and they put up but\r\nhalf-hearted resistance. Von Schoenvorts was the worst—he was fairly frenzied\r\nwith rage and chagrin, and he came charging for me like a mad bull, and as he\r\ncame he discharged his pistol. If he’d stopped long enough to take aim, he\r\nmight have gotten me; but his pace made him wild, so that not a shot touched\r\nme, and then we clinched and went to the deck. This left two pistols, which two\r\nof my own men were quick to appropriate. The Baron was no match for me in a\r\nhand-to-hand encounter, and I soon had him pinned to the deck and the life\r\nalmost choked out of him.\r\n\r\nA half-hour later things had quieted down, and all was much the same as before\r\nthe prisoners had revolted—only we kept a much closer watch on von Schoenvorts.\r\nThe _Geier_ had sunk while we were still battling upon our deck, and\r\nafterward we had drawn away toward the north, leaving the survivors to the\r\nattention of the single boat which had been making its way toward us when Olson\r\nlaunched the torpedo. I suppose the poor devils never reached land, and if they\r\ndid, they most probably perished on that cold and unhospitable shore; but I\r\ncouldn’t permit them aboard the _U_-33. We had all the Germans we could\r\ntake care of.\r\n\r\nThat evening the girl asked permission to go on deck. She said that she felt\r\nthe effects of long confinement below, and I readily granted her request. I\r\ncould not understand her, and I craved an opportunity to talk with her again in\r\nan effort to fathom her and her intentions, and so I made it a point to follow\r\nher up the ladder. It was a clear, cold, beautiful night. The sea was calm\r\nexcept for the white water at our bows and the two long radiating swells\r\nrunning far off into the distance upon either hand astern, forming a great V\r\nwhich our propellers filled with choppy waves. Benson was in the tower, we were\r\nbound for San Diego and all looked well.\r\n\r\nLys stood with a heavy blanket wrapped around her slender figure, and as I\r\napproached her, she half turned toward me to see who it was. When she\r\nrecognized me, she immediately turned away.\r\n\r\n“I want to thank you,” I said, “for your bravery and loyalty—you were\r\nmagnificent. I am sorry that you had reason before to think that I doubted\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“You did doubt me,” she replied in a level voice. “You practically accused me\r\nof aiding Baron von Schoenvorts. I can never forgive you.”\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of finality in both her words and tone.\r\n\r\n“I could not believe it,” I said; “and yet two of my men reported having seen\r\nyou in conversation with von Schoenvorts late at night upon two separate\r\noccasions—after each of which some great damage was found done us in the\r\nmorning. I didn’t want to doubt you; but I carried all the responsibility of\r\nthe lives of these men, of the safety of the ship, of your life and mine. I had\r\nto watch you, and I had to put you on your guard against a repetition of your\r\nmadness.”\r\n\r\nShe was looking at me now with those great eyes of hers, very wide and round.\r\n\r\n“Who told you that I spoke with Baron von Schoenvorts at night, or any other\r\ntime?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you, Lys,” I replied, “but it came to me from two different\r\nsources.”\r\n\r\n“Then two men have lied,” she asserted without heat. “I have not spoken to\r\nBaron von Schoenvorts other than in your presence when first we came aboard the\r\n_U_-33. And please, when you address me, remember that to others than my\r\nintimates I am Miss La Rue.”\r\n\r\nDid you ever get slapped in the face when you least expected it? No? Well, then\r\nyou do not know how I felt at that moment. I could feel the hot, red flush\r\nsurging up my neck, across my cheeks, over my ears, clear to my scalp. And it\r\nmade me love her all the more; it made me swear inwardly a thousand solemn\r\noaths that I would win her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several days things went along in about the same course. I took our\r\nposition every morning with my crude sextant; but the results were always most\r\nunsatisfactory. They always showed a considerable westing when I knew that we\r\nhad been sailing due north. I blamed my crude instrument, and kept on. Then one\r\nafternoon the girl came to me.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” she said, “but were I you, I should watch this man\r\nBenson—especially when he is in charge.” I asked her what she meant, thinking I\r\ncould see the influence of von Schoenvorts raising a suspicion against one of\r\nmy most trusted men.\r\n\r\n“If you will note the boat’s course a half-hour after Benson goes on duty,” she\r\nsaid, “you will know what I mean, and you will understand why he prefers a\r\nnight watch. Possibly, too, you will understand some other things that have\r\ntaken place aboard.”\r\n\r\nThen she went back to her room, thus ending the conversation. I waited until\r\nhalf an hour after Benson had gone on duty, and then I went on deck, passing\r\nthrough the conning-tower where Benson sat, and looking at the compass. It\r\nshowed that our course was north by west—that is, one point west of north,\r\nwhich was, for our assumed position, about right. I was greatly relieved to\r\nfind that nothing was wrong, for the girl’s words had caused me considerable\r\napprehension. I was about to return to my room when a thought occurred to me\r\nthat again caused me to change my mind—and, incidentally, came near proving my\r\ndeath-warrant.\r\n\r\nWhen I had left the conning-tower little more than a half-hour since, the sea\r\nhad been breaking over the port bow, and it seemed to me quite improbable that\r\nin so short a time an equally heavy sea could be deluging us from the opposite\r\nside of the ship—winds may change quickly, but not a long, heavy sea. There was\r\nonly one other solution—since I left the tower, our course had been altered\r\nsome eight points. Turning quickly, I climbed out upon the conning-tower. A\r\nsingle glance at the heavens confirmed my suspicions; the constellations which\r\nshould have been dead ahead were directly starboard. We were sailing due west.\r\n\r\nJust for an instant longer I stood there to check up my calculations—I wanted\r\nto be quite sure before I accused Benson of perfidy, and about the only thing I\r\ncame near making quite sure of was death. I cannot see even now how I escaped\r\nit. I was standing on the edge of the conning-tower, when a heavy palm suddenly\r\nstruck me between the shoulders and hurled me forward into space. The drop to\r\nthe triangular deck forward of the conning-tower might easily have broken a leg\r\nfor me, or I might have slipped off onto the deck and rolled overboard; but\r\nfate was upon my side, as I was only slightly bruised. As I came to my feet, I\r\nheard the conning-tower cover slam. There is a ladder which leads from the deck\r\nto the top of the tower. Up this I scrambled, as fast as I could go; but Benson\r\nhad the cover tight before I reached it.\r\n\r\nI stood there a moment in dumb consternation. What did the fellow intend? What\r\nwas going on below? If Benson was a traitor, how could I know that there were\r\nnot other traitors among us? I cursed myself for my folly in going out upon the\r\ndeck, and then this thought suggested another—a hideous one: who was it that\r\nhad really been responsible for my being here?\r\n\r\nThinking to attract attention from inside the craft, I again ran down the\r\nladder and onto the small deck only to find that the steel covers of the\r\nconning-tower windows were shut, and then I leaned with my back against the\r\ntower and cursed myself for a gullible idiot.\r\n\r\nI glanced at the bow. The sea seemed to be getting heavier, for every wave now\r\nwashed completely over the lower deck. I watched them for a moment, and then a\r\nsudden chill pervaded my entire being. It was not the chill of wet clothing, or\r\nthe dashing spray which drenched my face; no, it was the chill of the hand of\r\ndeath upon my heart. In an instant I had turned the last corner of life’s\r\nhighway and was looking God Almighty in the face—the _U_-33 was being\r\nslowly submerged!\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult, even impossible, to set down in writing my sensations at\r\nthat moment. All I can particularly recall is that I laughed, though neither\r\nfrom a spirit of bravado nor from hysteria. And I wanted to smoke. Lord! how I\r\ndid want to smoke; but that was out of the question.\r\n\r\nI watched the water rise until the little deck I stood on was awash, and then I\r\nclambered once more to the top of the conning-tower. From the very slow\r\nsubmergence of the boat I knew that Benson was doing the entire trick\r\nalone—that he was merely permitting the diving-tanks to fill and that the\r\ndiving-rudders were not in use. The throbbing of the engines ceased, and in its\r\nstead came the steady vibration of the electric motors. The water was halfway\r\nup the conning-tower! I had perhaps five minutes longer on the deck. I tried to\r\ndecide what I should do after I was washed away. Should I swim until exhaustion\r\nclaimed me, or should I give up and end the agony at the first plunge?\r\n\r\nFrom below came two muffled reports. They sounded not unlike shots. Was Benson\r\nmeeting with resistance? Personally it could mean little to me, for even though\r\nmy men might overcome the enemy, none would know of my predicament until long\r\nafter it was too late to succor me. The top of the conning-tower was now awash.\r\nI clung to the wireless mast, while the great waves surged sometimes completely\r\nover me.\r\n\r\nI knew the end was near and, almost involuntarily, I did that which I had not\r\ndone since childhood—I prayed. After that I felt better.\r\n\r\nI clung and waited, but the water rose no higher.\r\n\r\nInstead it receded. Now the top of the conning-tower received only the crests\r\nof the higher waves; now the little triangular deck below became visible! What\r\nhad occurred within? Did Benson believe me already gone, and was he emerging\r\nbecause of that belief, or had he and his forces been vanquished? The suspense\r\nwas more wearing than that which I had endured while waiting for dissolution.\r\nPresently the main deck came into view, and then the conning-tower opened\r\nbehind me, and I turned to look into the anxious face of Bradley. An expression\r\nof relief overspread his features.\r\n\r\n“Thank God, man!” was all he said as he reached forth and dragged me into the\r\ntower. I was cold and numb and rather all in. Another few minutes would have\r\ndone for me, I am sure, but the warmth of the interior helped to revive me,\r\naided and abetted by some brandy which Bradley poured down my throat, from\r\nwhich it nearly removed the membrane. That brandy would have revived a corpse.\r\n\r\nWhen I got down into the centrale, I saw the Germans lined up on one side with\r\na couple of my men with pistols standing over them. Von Schoenvorts was among\r\nthem. On the floor lay Benson, moaning, and beyond him stood the girl, a\r\nrevolver in one hand. I looked about, bewildered.\r\n\r\n“What has happened down here?” I asked. “Tell me!”\r\n\r\nBradley replied. “You see the result, sir,” he said. “It might have been a very\r\ndifferent result but for Miss La Rue. We were all asleep. Benson had relieved\r\nthe guard early in the evening; there was no one to watch him—no one but Miss\r\nLa Rue. She felt the submergence of the boat and came out of her room to\r\ninvestigate. She was just in time to see Benson at the diving rudders. When he\r\nsaw her, he raised his pistol and fired point-blank at her, but he missed and\r\nshe fired—and didn’t miss. The two shots awakened everyone, and as our men were\r\narmed, the result was inevitable as you see it; but it would have been very\r\ndifferent had it not been for Miss La Rue. It was she who closed the\r\ndiving-tank sea-cocks and roused Olson and me, and had the pumps started to\r\nempty them.”\r\n\r\nAnd there I had been thinking that through her machinations I had been lured to\r\nthe deck and to my death! I could have gone on my knees to her and begged her\r\nforgiveness—or at least I could have, had I not been Anglo-Saxon. As it was, I\r\ncould only remove my soggy cap and bow and mumble my appreciation. She made no\r\nreply—only turned and walked very rapidly toward her room. Could I have heard\r\naright? Was it really a sob that came floating back to me through the narrow\r\naisle of the _U_-33?\r\n\r\nBenson died that night. He remained defiant almost to the last; but just before\r\nhe went out, he motioned to me, and I leaned over to catch the faintly\r\nwhispered words.\r\n\r\n“I did it alone,” he said. “I did it because I hate you—I hate all your kind. I\r\nwas kicked out of your shipyard at Santa Monica. I was locked out of\r\nCalifornia. I am an I. W. W. I became a German agent—not because I love them,\r\nfor I hate them too—but because I wanted to injure Americans, whom I hated\r\nmore. I threw the wireless apparatus overboard. I destroyed the chronometer and\r\nthe sextant. I devised a scheme for varying the compass to suit my wishes. I\r\ntold Wilson that I had seen the girl talking with von Schoenvorts, and I made\r\nthe poor egg think he had seen her doing the same thing. I am sorry—sorry that\r\nmy plans failed. I hate you.”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t die for a half-hour after that; nor did he speak again—aloud; but\r\njust a few seconds before he went to meet his Maker, his lips moved in a faint\r\nwhisper; and as I leaned closer to catch his words, what do you suppose I\r\nheard? “Now—I—lay me—down—to—sleep” That was all; Benson was dead. We threw his\r\nbody overboard.\r\n\r\nThe wind of that night brought on some pretty rough weather with a lot of black\r\nclouds which persisted for several days. We didn’t know what course we had been\r\nholding, and there was no way of finding out, as we could no longer trust the\r\ncompass, not knowing what Benson had done to it. The long and the short of it\r\nwas that we cruised about aimlessly until the sun came out again. I’ll never\r\nforget that day or its surprises. We reckoned, or rather guessed, that we were\r\nsomewhere off the coast of Peru. The wind, which had been blowing fitfully from\r\nthe east, suddenly veered around into the south, and presently we felt a sudden\r\nchill.\r\n\r\n“Peru!” snorted Olson. “When were yez after smellin’ iceber-rgs off Peru?”\r\n\r\nIcebergs! “Icebergs, nothin’!” exclaimed one of the Englishmen. “Why, man, they\r\ndon’t come north of fourteen here in these waters.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” replied Olson, “ye’re sout’ of fourteen, me b’y.”\r\n\r\nWe thought he was crazy; but he wasn’t, for that afternoon we sighted a great\r\nberg south of us, and we’d been running north, we thought, for days. I can tell\r\nyou we were a discouraged lot; but we got a faint thrill of hope early the next\r\nmorning when the lookout bawled down the open hatch: “Land! Land northwest by\r\nwest!”\r\n\r\nI think we were all sick for the sight of land. I know that I was; but my\r\ninterest was quickly dissipated by the sudden illness of three of the Germans.\r\nAlmost simultaneously they commenced vomiting. They couldn’t suggest any\r\nexplanation for it. I asked them what they had eaten, and found they had eaten\r\nnothing other than the food cooked for all of us. “Have you drunk anything?” I\r\nasked, for I knew that there was liquor aboard, and medicines in the same\r\nlocker.\r\n\r\n“Only water,” moaned one of them. “We all drank water together this morning. We\r\nopened a new tank. Maybe it was the water.”\r\n\r\nI started an investigation which revealed a terrifying condition—some one,\r\nprobably Benson, had poisoned all the running water on the ship. It would have\r\nbeen worse, though, had land not been in sight. The sight of land filled us\r\nwith renewed hope.\r\n\r\nOur course had been altered, and we were rapidly approaching what appeared to\r\nbe a precipitous headland. Cliffs, seemingly rising perpendicularly out of the\r\nsea, faded away into the mist upon either hand as we approached. The land\r\nbefore us might have been a continent, so mighty appeared the shoreline; yet we\r\nknew that we must be thousands of miles from the nearest western land-mass—New\r\nZealand or Australia.\r\n\r\nWe took our bearings with our crude and inaccurate instruments; we searched the\r\nchart; we cudgeled our brains; and at last it was Bradley who suggested a\r\nsolution. He was in the tower and watching the compass, to which he called my\r\nattention. The needle was pointing straight toward the land. Bradley swung the\r\nhelm hard to starboard. I could feel the _U_-33 respond, and yet the arrow\r\nstill clung straight and sure toward the distant cliffs.\r\n\r\n“What do you make of it?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever hear of Caproni?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“An early Italian navigator?” I returned.\r\n\r\n“Yes; he followed Cook about 1721. He is scarcely mentioned even by\r\ncontemporaneous historians—probably because he got into political difficulties\r\non his return to Italy. It was the fashion to scoff at his claims, but I recall\r\nreading one of his works—his only one, I believe—in which he described a new\r\ncontinent in the south seas, a continent made up of ‘some strange metal’ which\r\nattracted the compass; a rockbound, inhospitable coast, without beach or\r\nharbor, which extended for hundreds of miles. He could make no landing; nor in\r\nthe several days he cruised about it did he see sign of life. He called it\r\nCaprona and sailed away. I believe, sir, that we are looking upon the coast of\r\nCaprona, uncharted and forgotten for two hundred years.”\r\n\r\n“If you are right, it might account for much of the deviation of the compass\r\nduring the past two days,” I suggested. “Caprona has been luring us upon her\r\ndeadly rocks. Well, we’ll accept her challenge. We’ll land upon Caprona. Along\r\nthat long front there must be a vulnerable spot. We will find it, Bradley, for\r\nwe must find it. We must find water on Caprona, or we must die.”\r\n\r\nAnd so we approached the coast upon which no living eyes had ever rested.\r\nStraight from the ocean’s depths rose towering cliffs, shot with brown and\r\nblues and greens—withered moss and lichen and the verdigris of copper, and\r\neverywhere the rusty ocher of iron pyrites. The cliff-tops, though ragged, were\r\nof such uniform height as to suggest the boundaries of a great plateau, and now\r\nand again we caught glimpses of verdure topping the rocky escarpment, as though\r\nbush or jungle-land had pushed outward from a lush vegetation farther inland to\r\nsignal to an unseeing world that Caprona lived and joyed in life beyond her\r\naustere and repellent coast.\r\n\r\nBut metaphor, however poetic, never slaked a dry throat. To enjoy Caprona’s\r\nromantic suggestions we must have water, and so we came in close, always\r\nsounding, and skirted the shore. As close in as we dared cruise, we found\r\nfathomless depths, and always the same undented coastline of bald cliffs. As\r\ndarkness threatened, we drew away and lay well off the coast all night. We had\r\nnot as yet really commenced to suffer for lack of water; but I knew that it\r\nwould not be long before we did, and so at the first streak of dawn I moved in\r\nagain and once more took up the hopeless survey of the forbidding coast.\r\n\r\nToward noon we discovered a beach, the first we had seen. It was a narrow strip\r\nof sand at the base of a part of the cliff that seemed lower than any we had\r\nbefore scanned. At its foot, half buried in the sand, lay great boulders, mute\r\nevidence that in a bygone age some mighty natural force had crumpled Caprona’s\r\nbarrier at this point. It was Bradley who first called our attention to a\r\nstrange object lying among the boulders above the surf.\r\n\r\n“Looks like a man,” he said, and passed his glasses to me.\r\n\r\nI looked long and carefully and could have sworn that the thing I saw was the\r\nsprawled figure of a human being. Miss La Rue was on deck with us. I turned and\r\nasked her to go below. Without a word she did as I bade. Then I stripped, and\r\nas I did so, Nobs looked questioningly at me. He had been wont at home to enter\r\nthe surf with me, and evidently he had not forgotten it.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do, sir?” asked Olson.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to see what that thing is on shore,” I replied. “If it’s a man, it\r\nmay mean that Caprona is inhabited, or it may merely mean that some poor devils\r\nwere shipwrecked here. I ought to be able to tell from the clothing which is\r\nmore near the truth.\r\n\r\n“How about sharks?” queried Olson. “Sure, you ought to carry a knoife.”\r\n\r\n“Here you are, sir,” cried one of the men.\r\n\r\nIt was a long slim blade he offered—one that I could carry between my teeth—and\r\nso I accepted it gladly.\r\n\r\n“Keep close in,” I directed Bradley, and then I dived over the side and struck\r\nout for the narrow beach. There was another splash directly behind me, and\r\nturning my head, I saw faithful old Nobs swimming valiantly in my wake.\r\n\r\nThe surf was not heavy, and there was no undertow, so we made shore easily,\r\neffecting an equally easy landing. The beach was composed largely of small\r\nstones worn smooth by the action of water. There was little sand, though from\r\nthe deck of the _U_-33 the beach had appeared to be all sand, and I saw no\r\nevidences of mollusca or crustacea such as are common to all beaches I have\r\npreviously seen. I attribute this to the fact of the smallness of the beach,\r\nthe enormous depth of surrounding water and the great distance at which Caprona\r\nlies from her nearest neighbor.\r\n\r\nAs Nobs and I approached the recumbent figure farther up the beach, I was\r\nappraised by my nose that whether man or not, the thing had once been organic\r\nand alive, but that for some time it had been dead. Nobs halted, sniffed and\r\ngrowled. A little later he sat down upon his haunches, raised his muzzle to the\r\nheavens and bayed forth a most dismal howl. I shied a small stone at him and\r\nbade him shut up—his uncanny noise made me nervous. When I had come quite close\r\nto the thing, I still could not say whether it had been man or beast. The\r\ncarcass was badly swollen and partly decomposed. There was no sign of clothing\r\nupon or about it. A fine, brownish hair covered the chest and abdomen, and the\r\nface, the palms of the hands, the feet, the shoulders and back were practically\r\nhairless. The creature must have been about the height of a fair sized man; its\r\nfeatures were similar to those of a man; yet had it been a man?\r\n\r\nI could not say, for it resembled an ape no more than it did a man. Its large\r\ntoes protruded laterally as do those of the semiarboreal peoples of Borneo, the\r\nPhilippines and other remote regions where low types still persist. The\r\ncountenance might have been that of a cross between _Pithecanthropus_, the\r\nJava ape-man, and a daughter of the Piltdown race of prehistoric Sussex. A\r\nwooden cudgel lay beside the corpse.\r\n\r\nNow this fact set me thinking. There was no wood of any description in sight.\r\nThere was nothing about the beach to suggest a wrecked mariner. There was\r\nabsolutely nothing about the body to suggest that it might possibly in life\r\nhave known a maritime experience. It was the body of a low type of man or a\r\nhigh type of beast. In neither instance would it have been of a seafaring race.\r\nTherefore I deduced that it was native to Caprona—that it lived inland, and\r\nthat it had fallen or been hurled from the cliffs above. Such being the case,\r\nCaprona was inhabitable, if not inhabited, by man; but how to reach the\r\ninhabitable interior! That was the question. A closer view of the cliffs than\r\nhad been afforded me from the deck of the _U_-33 only confirmed my\r\nconviction that no mortal man could scale those perpendicular heights; there\r\nwas not a finger-hold, not a toe-hold, upon them. I turned away baffled.\r\n\r\nNobs and I met with no sharks upon our return journey to the submarine. My\r\nreport filled everyone with theories and speculations, and with renewed hope\r\nand determination. They all reasoned along the same lines that I had\r\nreasoned—the conclusions were obvious, but not the water. We were now thirstier\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nThe balance of that day we spent in continuing a minute and fruitless\r\nexploration of the monotonous coast. There was not another break in the\r\nfrowning cliffs—not even another minute patch of pebbly beach. As the sun fell,\r\nso did our spirits. I had tried to make advances to the girl again; but she\r\nwould have none of me, and so I was not only thirsty but otherwise sad and\r\ndownhearted. I was glad when the new day broke the hideous spell of a sleepless\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe morning’s search brought us no shred of hope. Caprona was impregnable—that\r\nwas the decision of all; yet we kept on. It must have been about two bells of\r\nthe afternoon watch that Bradley called my attention to the branch of a tree,\r\nwith leaves upon it, floating on the sea. “It may have been carried down to the\r\nocean by a river,” he suggested.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, “it may have; it may have tumbled or been thrown off the top\r\nof one of these cliffs.”\r\n\r\nBradley’s face fell. “I thought of that, too,” he replied, “but I wanted to\r\nbelieve the other.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are!” I cried. “We must believe the other until we prove it false.\r\nWe can’t afford to give up heart now, when we need heart most. The branch was\r\ncarried down by a river, and we are going to find that river.” I smote my open\r\npalm with a clenched fist, to emphasize a determination unsupported by hope.\r\n“There!” I cried suddenly. “See that, Bradley?” And I pointed at a spot closer\r\nto shore. “See that, man!” Some flowers and grasses and another leafy branch\r\nfloated toward us. We both scanned the water and the coastline. Bradley\r\nevidently discovered something, or at least thought that he had. He called down\r\nfor a bucket and a rope, and when they were passed up to him, he lowered the\r\nformer into the sea and drew it in filled with water. Of this he took a taste,\r\nand straightening up, looked into my eyes with an expression of elation—as much\r\nas to say “I told you so!”\r\n\r\n“This water is warm,” he announced, “and fresh!”\r\n\r\nI grabbed the bucket and tasted its contents. The water was very warm, and it\r\nwas fresh, but there was a most unpleasant taste to it.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever taste water from a stagnant pool full of tadpoles?” Bradley\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“That’s it,” I exclaimed, “—that’s just the taste exactly, though I haven’t\r\nexperienced it since boyhood; but how can water from a flowing stream, taste\r\nthus, and what the dickens makes it so warm? It must be at least 70 or 80\r\nFahrenheit, possibly higher.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” agreed Bradley, “I should say higher; but where does it come from?”\r\n\r\n“That is easily discovered now that we have found it,” I answered. “It can’t\r\ncome from the ocean; so it must come from the land. All that we have to do is\r\nfollow it, and sooner or later we shall come upon its source.”\r\n\r\nWe were already rather close in; but I ordered the _U_-33’s prow turned\r\ninshore and we crept slowly along, constantly dipping up the water and tasting\r\nit to assure ourselves that we didn’t get outside the fresh-water current.\r\nThere was a very light off-shore wind and scarcely any breakers, so that the\r\napproach to the shore was continued without finding bottom; yet though we were\r\nalready quite close, we saw no indication of any indention in the coast from\r\nwhich even a tiny brooklet might issue, and certainly no mouth of a large river\r\nsuch as this must necessarily be to freshen the ocean even two hundred yards\r\nfrom shore. The tide was running out, and this, together with the strong flow\r\nof the freshwater current, would have prevented our going against the cliffs\r\neven had we not been under power; as it was we had to buck the combined forces\r\nin order to hold our position at all. We came up to within twenty-five feet of\r\nthe sheer wall, which loomed high above us. There was no break in its\r\nforbidding face. As we watched the face of the waters and searched the cliff’s\r\nhigh face, Olson suggested that the fresh water might come from a submarine\r\ngeyser. This, he said, would account for its heat; but even as he spoke a bush,\r\ncovered thickly with leaves and flowers, bubbled to the surface and floated off\r\nastern.\r\n\r\n“Flowering shrubs don’t thrive in the subterranean caverns from which geysers\r\nspring,” suggested Bradley.\r\n\r\nOlson shook his head. “It beats me,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got it!” I exclaimed suddenly. “Look there!” And I pointed at the base of\r\nthe cliff ahead of us, which the receding tide was gradually exposing to our\r\nview. They all looked, and all saw what I had seen—the top of a dark opening in\r\nthe rock, through which water was pouring out into the sea. “It’s the\r\nsubterranean channel of an inland river,” I cried. “It flows through a land\r\ncovered with vegetation—and therefore a land upon which the sun shines. No\r\nsubterranean caverns produce any order of plant life even remotely resembling\r\nwhat we have seen disgorged by this river. Beyond those cliffs lie fertile\r\nlands and fresh water—perhaps, game!”\r\n\r\n“Yis, sir,” said Olson, “behoind the cliffs! Ye spoke a true word,\r\nsir—behoind!”\r\n\r\nBradley laughed—a rather sorry laugh, though. “You might as well call our\r\nattention to the fact, sir,” he said, “that science has indicated that there is\r\nfresh water and vegetation on Mars.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” I rejoined. “A U-boat isn’t constructed to navigate space, but it\r\nis designed to travel below the surface of the water.”\r\n\r\n“You’d be after sailin’ into that blank pocket?” asked Olson.\r\n\r\n“I would, Olson,” I replied. “We haven’t one chance for life in a hundred\r\nthousand if we don’t find food and water upon Caprona. This water coming out of\r\nthe cliff is not salt; but neither is it fit to drink, though each of us has\r\ndrunk. It is fair to assume that inland the river is fed by pure streams, that\r\nthere are fruits and herbs and game. Shall we lie out here and die of thirst\r\nand starvation with a land of plenty possibly only a few hundred yards away? We\r\nhave the means for navigating a subterranean river. Are we too cowardly to\r\nutilize this means?”\r\n\r\n“Be afther goin’ to it,” said Olson.\r\n\r\n“I’m willing to see it through,” agreed Bradley.\r\n\r\n“Then under the bottom, wi’ the best o’ luck an’ give ’em hell!” cried a young\r\nfellow who had been in the trenches.\r\n\r\n“To the diving-stations!” I commanded, and in less than a minute the deck was\r\ndeserted, the conning-tower covers had slammed to and the _U_-33 was\r\nsubmerging—possibly for the last time. I know that I had this feeling, and I\r\nthink that most of the others did.\r\n\r\nAs we went down, I sat in the tower with the searchlight projecting its\r\nseemingly feeble rays ahead. We submerged very slowly and without headway more\r\nthan sufficient to keep her nose in the right direction, and as we went down, I\r\nsaw outlined ahead of us the black opening in the great cliff. It was an\r\nopening that would have admitted a half-dozen U-boats at one and the same time,\r\nroughly cylindrical in contour—and dark as the pit of perdition.\r\n\r\nAs I gave the command which sent the _U_-33 slowly ahead, I could not but\r\nfeel a certain uncanny presentiment of evil. Where were we going? What lay at\r\nthe end of this great sewer? Had we bidden farewell forever to the sunlight and\r\nlife, or were there before us dangers even greater than those which we now\r\nfaced? I tried to keep my mind from vain imagining by calling everything which\r\nI observed to the eager ears below. I was the eyes of the whole company, and I\r\ndid my best not to fail them. We had advanced a hundred yards, perhaps, when\r\nour first danger confronted us. Just ahead was a sharp right-angle turn in the\r\ntunnel. I could see the river’s flotsam hurtling against the rocky wall upon\r\nthe left as it was driven on by the mighty current, and I feared for the safety\r\nof the _U_-33 in making so sharp a turn under such adverse conditions; but\r\nthere was nothing for it but to try. I didn’t warn my fellows of the danger—it\r\ncould have but caused them useless apprehension, for if we were to be smashed\r\nagainst the rocky wall, no power on earth could avert the quick end that would\r\ncome to us. I gave the command full speed ahead and went charging toward the\r\nmenace. I was forced to approach the dangerous left-hand wall in order to make\r\nthe turn, and I depended upon the power of the motors to carry us through the\r\nsurging waters in safety. Well, we made it; but it was a narrow squeak. As we\r\nswung around, the full force of the current caught us and drove the stern\r\nagainst the rocks; there was a thud which sent a tremor through the whole\r\ncraft, and then a moment of nasty grinding as the steel hull scraped the rock\r\nwall. I expected momentarily the inrush of waters that would seal our doom; but\r\npresently from below came the welcome word that all was well.\r\n\r\nIn another fifty yards there was a second turn, this time toward the left! but\r\nit was more of a gentle curve, and we took it without trouble. After that it\r\nwas plain sailing, though as far as I could know, there might be most anything\r\nahead of us, and my nerves strained to the snapping-point every instant. After\r\nthe second turn the channel ran comparatively straight for between one hundred\r\nand fifty and two hundred yards. The waters grew suddenly lighter, and my\r\nspirits rose accordingly. I shouted down to those below that I saw daylight\r\nahead, and a great shout of thanksgiving reverberated through the ship. A\r\nmoment later we emerged into sunlit water, and immediately I raised the\r\nperiscope and looked about me upon the strangest landscape I had ever seen.\r\n\r\nWe were in the middle of a broad and now sluggish river the banks of which were\r\nlined by giant, arboraceous ferns, raising their mighty fronds fifty, one\r\nhundred, two hundred feet into the quiet air. Close by us something rose to the\r\nsurface of the river and dashed at the periscope. I had a vision of wide,\r\ndistended jaws, and then all was blotted out. A shiver ran down into the tower\r\nas the thing closed upon the periscope. A moment later it was gone, and I could\r\nsee again. Above the trees there soared into my vision a huge thing on batlike\r\nwings—a creature large as a large whale, but fashioned more after the order of\r\na lizard. Then again something charged the periscope and blotted out the\r\nmirror. I will confess that I was almost gasping for breath as I gave the\r\ncommands to emerge. Into what sort of strange land had fate guided us?\r\n\r\nThe instant the deck was awash, I opened the conning-tower hatch and stepped\r\nout. In another minute the deck-hatch lifted, and those who were not on duty\r\nbelow streamed up the ladder, Olson bringing Nobs under one arm. For several\r\nminutes no one spoke; I think they must each have been as overcome by awe as\r\nwas I. All about us was a flora and fauna as strange and wonderful to us as\r\nmight have been those upon a distant planet had we suddenly been miraculously\r\ntransported through ether to an unknown world. Even the grass upon the nearer\r\nbank was unearthly—lush and high it grew, and each blade bore upon its tip a\r\nbrilliant flower—violet or yellow or carmine or blue—making as gorgeous a sward\r\nas human imagination might conceive. But the life! It teemed. The tall,\r\nfernlike trees were alive with monkeys, snakes, and lizards. Huge insects\r\nhummed and buzzed hither and thither. Mighty forms could be seen moving upon\r\nthe ground in the thick forest, while the bosom of the river wriggled with\r\nliving things, and above flapped the wings of gigantic creatures such as we are\r\ntaught have been extinct throughout countless ages.\r\n\r\n“Look!” cried Olson. “Would you look at the giraffe comin’ up out o’ the bottom\r\nof the say?” We looked in the direction he pointed and saw a long, glossy neck\r\nsurmounted by a small head rising above the surface of the river. Presently the\r\nback of the creature was exposed, brown and glossy as the water dripped from\r\nit. It turned its eyes upon us, opened its lizard-like mouth, emitted a shrill\r\nhiss and came for us. The thing must have been sixteen or eighteen feet in\r\nlength and closely resembled pictures I had seen of restored plesiosaurs of the\r\nlower Jurassic. It charged us as savagely as a mad bull, and one would have\r\nthought it intended to destroy and devour the mighty U-boat, as I verily\r\nbelieve it did intend.\r\n\r\nWe were moving slowly up the river as the creature bore down upon us with\r\ndistended jaws. The long neck was far outstretched, and the four flippers with\r\nwhich it swam were working with powerful strokes, carrying it forward at a\r\nrapid pace. When it reached the craft’s side, the jaws closed upon one of the\r\nstanchions of the deck rail and tore it from its socket as though it had been a\r\ntoothpick stuck in putty. At this exhibition of titanic strength I think we all\r\nsimultaneously stepped backward, and Bradley drew his revolver and fired. The\r\nbullet struck the thing in the neck, just above its body; but instead of\r\ndisabling it, merely increased its rage. Its hissing rose to a shrill scream as\r\nit raised half its body out of water onto the sloping sides of the hull of the\r\n_U_-33 and endeavored to scramble upon the deck to devour us. A dozen\r\nshots rang out as we who were armed drew our pistols and fired at the thing;\r\nbut though struck several times, it showed no signs of succumbing and only\r\nfloundered farther aboard the submarine.\r\n\r\nI had noticed that the girl had come on deck and was standing not far behind\r\nme, and when I saw the danger to which we were all exposed, I turned and forced\r\nher toward the hatch. We had not spoken for some days, and we did not speak\r\nnow; but she gave me a disdainful look, which was quite as eloquent as words,\r\nand broke loose from my grasp. I saw I could do nothing with her unless I\r\nexerted force, and so I turned with my back toward her that I might be in a\r\nposition to shield her from the strange reptile should it really succeed in\r\nreaching the deck; and as I did so I saw the thing raise one flipper over the\r\nrail, dart its head forward and with the quickness of lightning seize upon one\r\nof the boches. I ran forward, discharging my pistol into the creature’s body in\r\nan effort to force it to relinquish its prey; but I might as profitably have\r\nshot at the sun.\r\n\r\nShrieking and screaming, the German was dragged from the deck, and the moment\r\nthe reptile was clear of the boat, it dived beneath the surface of the water\r\nwith its terrified prey. I think we were all more or less shaken by the\r\nfrightfulness of the tragedy—until Olson remarked that the balance of power now\r\nrested where it belonged. Following the death of Benson we had been nine and\r\nnine—nine Germans and nine “Allies,” as we called ourselves, now there were but\r\neight Germans. We never counted the girl on either side, I suppose because she\r\nwas a girl, though we knew well enough now that she was ours.\r\n\r\nAnd so Olson’s remark helped to clear the atmosphere for the Allies at least,\r\nand then our attention was once more directed toward the river, for around us\r\nthere had sprung up a perfect bedlam of screams and hisses and a seething\r\ncaldron of hideous reptiles, devoid of fear and filled only with hunger and\r\nwith rage. They clambered, squirmed and wriggled to the deck, forcing us\r\nsteadily backward, though we emptied our pistols into them. There were all\r\nsorts and conditions of horrible things—huge, hideous, grotesque, monstrous—a\r\nveritable Mesozoic nightmare. I saw that the girl was gotten below as quickly\r\nas possible, and she took Nobs with her—poor Nobs had nearly barked his head\r\noff; and I think, too, that for the first time since his littlest puppyhood he\r\nhad known fear; nor can I blame him. After the girl I sent Bradley and most of\r\nthe Allies and then the Germans who were on deck—von Schoenvorts being still in\r\nirons below.\r\n\r\nThe creatures were approaching perilously close before I dropped through the\r\nhatchway and slammed down the cover. Then I went into the tower and ordered\r\nfull speed ahead, hoping to distance the fearsome things; but it was useless.\r\nNot only could any of them easily outdistance the _U_-33, but the further\r\nupstream we progressed the greater the number of our besiegers, until fearful\r\nof navigating a strange river at high speed, I gave orders to reduce and moved\r\nslowly and majestically through the plunging, hissing mass. I was mighty glad\r\nthat our entrance into the interior of Caprona had been inside a submarine\r\nrather than in any other form of vessel. I could readily understand how it\r\nmight have been that Caprona had been invaded in the past by venturesome\r\nnavigators without word of it ever reaching the outside world, for I can assure\r\nyou that only by submarine could man pass up that great sluggish river, alive.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded up the river for some forty miles before darkness overtook us. I\r\nwas afraid to submerge and lie on the bottom overnight for fear that the mud\r\nmight be deep enough to hold us, and as we could not hold with the anchor, I\r\nran in close to shore, and in a brief interim of attack from the reptiles we\r\nmade fast to a large tree. We also dipped up some of the river water and found\r\nit, though quite warm, a little sweeter than before. We had food enough, and\r\nwith the water we were all quite refreshed; but we missed fresh meat. It had\r\nbeen weeks, now, since we had tasted it, and the sight of the reptiles gave me\r\nan idea—that a steak or two from one of them might not be bad eating. So I went\r\non deck with a rifle, twenty of which were aboard the _U_-33. At sight of\r\nme a huge thing charged and climbed to the deck. I retreated to the top of the\r\nconning-tower, and when it had raised its mighty bulk to the level of the\r\nlittle deck on which I stood, I let it have a bullet right between the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe thing stopped then and looked at me a moment as much as to say: “Why this\r\nthing has a stinger! I must be careful.” And then it reached out its long neck\r\nand opened its mighty jaws and grabbed for me; but I wasn’t there. I had\r\ntumbled backward into the tower, and I mighty near killed myself doing it. When\r\nI glanced up, that little head on the end of its long neck was coming straight\r\ndown on top of me, and once more I tumbled into greater safety, sprawling upon\r\nthe floor of the centrale.\r\n\r\nOlson was looking up, and seeing what was poking about in the tower, ran for an\r\nax; nor did he hesitate a moment when he returned with one, but sprang up the\r\nladder and commenced chopping away at that hideous face. The thing didn’t have\r\nsufficient brainpan to entertain more than a single idea at once. Though\r\nchopped and hacked, and with a bullethole between its eyes, it still persisted\r\nmadly in its attempt to get inside the tower and devour Olson, though its body\r\nwas many times the diameter of the hatch; nor did it cease its efforts until\r\nafter Olson had succeeded in decapitating it. Then the two men went on deck\r\nthrough the main hatch, and while one kept watch, the other cut a hind quarter\r\noff _Plesiosaurus Olsoni_, as Bradley dubbed the thing. Meantime Olson cut\r\noff the long neck, saying that it would make fine soup. By the time we had\r\ncleared away the blood and refuse in the tower, the cook had juicy steaks and a\r\nsteaming broth upon the electric stove, and the aroma arising from P. Olsoni\r\nfilled us all with a hitherto unfelt admiration for him and all his kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steaks we had that night, and they were fine; and the following morning we\r\ntasted the broth. It seemed odd to be eating a creature that should, by all the\r\nlaws of paleontology, have been extinct for several million years. It gave one\r\na feeling of newness that was almost embarrassing, although it didn’t seem to\r\nembarrass our appetites. Olson ate until I thought he would burst.\r\n\r\nThe girl ate with us that night at the little officers’ mess just back of the\r\ntorpedo compartment. The narrow table was unfolded; the four stools were set\r\nout; and for the first time in days we sat down to eat, and for the first time\r\nin weeks we had something to eat other than the monotony of the short rations\r\nof an impoverished U-boat. Nobs sat between the girl and me and was fed with\r\nmorsels of the Plesiosaurus steak, at the risk of forever contaminating his\r\nmanners. He looked at me sheepishly all the time, for he knew that no well-bred\r\ndog should eat at table; but the poor fellow was so wasted from improper food\r\nthat I couldn’t enjoy my own meal had he been denied an immediate share in it;\r\nand anyway Lys wanted to feed him. So there you are.\r\n\r\nLys was coldly polite to me and sweetly gracious to Bradley and Olson. She\r\nwasn’t of the gushing type, I knew; so I didn’t expect much from her and was\r\nduly grateful for the few morsels of attention she threw upon the floor to me.\r\nWe had a pleasant meal, with only one unfortunate occurrence—when Olson\r\nsuggested that possibly the creature we were eating was the same one that ate\r\nthe German. It was some time before we could persuade the girl to continue her\r\nmeal, but at last Bradley prevailed upon her, pointing out that we had come\r\nupstream nearly forty miles since the boche had been seized, and that during\r\nthat time we had seen literally thousands of these denizens of the river,\r\nindicating that the chances were very remote that this was the same Plesiosaur.\r\n“And anyway,” he concluded, “it was only a scheme of Mr. Olson’s to get all the\r\nsteaks for himself.”\r\n\r\nWe discussed the future and ventured opinions as to what lay before us; but we\r\ncould only theorize at best, for none of us knew. If the whole land was\r\ninfested by these and similar horrid monsters, life would be impossible upon\r\nit, and we decided that we would only search long enough to find and take\r\naboard fresh water and such meat and fruits as might be safely procurable and\r\nthen retrace our way beneath the cliffs to the open sea.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last we turned into our narrow bunks, hopeful, happy and at peace\r\nwith ourselves, our lives and our God, to awaken the following morning\r\nrefreshed and still optimistic. We had an easy time getting away—as we learned\r\nlater, because the saurians do not commence to feed until late in the morning.\r\nFrom noon to midnight their curve of activity is at its height, while from dawn\r\nto about nine o’clock it is lowest. As a matter of fact, we didn’t see one of\r\nthem all the time we were getting under way, though I had the cannon raised to\r\nthe deck and manned against an assault. I hoped, but I was none too sure, that\r\nshells might discourage them. The trees were full of monkeys of all sizes and\r\nshades, and once we thought we saw a manlike creature watching us from the\r\ndepth of the forest.\r\n\r\nShortly after we resumed our course upstream, we saw the mouth of another and\r\nsmaller river emptying into the main channel from the south—that is, upon our\r\nright; and almost immediately after we came upon a large island five or six\r\nmiles in length; and at fifty miles there was a still larger river than the\r\nlast coming in from the northwest, the course of the main stream having now\r\nchanged to northeast by southwest. The water was quite free from reptiles, and\r\nthe vegetation upon the banks of the river had altered to more open and\r\nparklike forest, with eucalyptus and acacia mingled with a scattering of tree\r\nferns, as though two distinct periods of geologic time had overlapped and\r\nmerged. The grass, too, was less flowering, though there were still gorgeous\r\npatches mottling the greensward; and lastly, the fauna was less multitudinous.\r\n\r\nSix or seven miles farther, and the river widened considerably; before us\r\nopened an expanse of water to the farther horizon, and then we sailed out upon\r\nan inland sea so large that only a shore-line upon our side was visible to us.\r\nThe waters all about us were alive with life. There were still a few reptiles;\r\nbut there were fish by the thousands, by the millions.\r\n\r\nThe water of the inland sea was very warm, almost hot, and the atmosphere was\r\nhot and heavy above it. It seemed strange that beyond the buttressed walls of\r\nCaprona icebergs floated and the south wind was biting, for only a gentle\r\nbreeze moved across the face of these living waters, and that was damp and\r\nwarm. Gradually, we commenced to divest ourselves of our clothing, retaining\r\nonly sufficient for modesty; but the sun was not hot. It was more the heat of a\r\nsteam-room than of an oven.\r\n\r\nWe coasted up the shore of the lake in a north-westerly direction, sounding all\r\nthe time. We found the lake deep and the bottom rocky and steeply shelving\r\ntoward the center, and once when I moved straight out from shore to take other\r\nsoundings we could find no bottom whatsoever. In open spaces along the shore we\r\ncaught occasional glimpses of the distant cliffs, and here they appeared only a\r\ntrifle less precipitous than those which bound Caprona on the seaward side. My\r\ntheory is that in a far distant era Caprona was a mighty mountain—perhaps the\r\nworld’s mightiest mountain—and that in some titanic eruption volcanic action\r\nblew off the entire crest, blew thousands of feet of the mountain upward and\r\noutward and onto the surrounding continent, leaving a great crater; and then,\r\npossibly, the continent sank as ancient continents have been known to do,\r\nleaving only the summit of Caprona above the sea. The encircling walls, the\r\ncentral lake, the hot springs which feed the lake, all point to such a\r\nconclusion, and the fauna and the flora bear indisputable evidence that Caprona\r\nwas once part of some great land-mass.\r\n\r\nAs we cruised up along the coast, the landscape continued a more or less open\r\nforest, with here and there a small plain where we saw animals grazing. With my\r\nglass I could make out a species of large red deer, some antelope and what\r\nappeared to be a species of horse; and once I saw the shaggy form of what might\r\nhave been a monstrous bison. Here was game a plenty! There seemed little danger\r\nof starving upon Caprona. The game, however, seemed wary; for the instant the\r\nanimals discovered us, they threw up their heads and tails and went cavorting\r\noff, those farther inland following the example of the others until all were\r\nlost in the mazes of the distant forest. Only the great, shaggy ox stood his\r\nground. With lowered head he watched us until we had passed, and then continued\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles up the coast from the mouth of the river we encountered low\r\ncliffs of sandstone, broken and tortured evidence of the great upheaval which\r\nhad torn Caprona asunder in the past, intermingling upon a common level the\r\nrock formations of widely separated eras, fusing some and leaving others\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\nWe ran along beside them for a matter of ten miles, arriving off a broad cleft\r\nwhich led into what appeared to be another lake. As we were in search of pure\r\nwater, we did not wish to overlook any portion of the coast, and so after\r\nsounding and finding that we had ample depth, I ran the _U_-33 between\r\nhead-lands into as pretty a landlocked harbor as sailormen could care to see,\r\nwith good water right up to within a few yards of the shore. As we cruised\r\nslowly along, two of the boches again saw what they believed to be a man, or\r\nmanlike creature, watching us from a fringe of trees a hundred yards inland,\r\nand shortly after we discovered the mouth of a small stream emptying into the\r\nbay. It was the first stream we had found since leaving the river, and I at\r\nonce made preparations to test its water. To land, it would be necessary to run\r\nthe _U_-33 close in to the shore, at least as close as we could, for even\r\nthese waters were infested, though, not so thickly, by savage reptiles. I\r\nordered sufficient water let into the diving-tanks to lower us about a foot,\r\nand then I ran the bow slowly toward the shore, confident that should we run\r\naground, we still had sufficient lifting force to free us when the water should\r\nbe pumped out of the tanks; but the bow nosed its way gently into the reeds and\r\ntouched the shore with the keel still clear.\r\n\r\nMy men were all armed now with both rifles and pistols, each having plenty of\r\nammunition. I ordered one of the Germans ashore with a line, and sent two of my\r\nown men to guard him, for from what little we had seen of Caprona, or Caspak as\r\nwe learned later to call the interior, we realized that any instant some new\r\nand terrible danger might confront us. The line was made fast to a small tree,\r\nand at the same time I had the stern anchor dropped.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the boche and his guard were aboard again, I called all hands on\r\ndeck, including von Schoenvorts, and there I explained to them that the time\r\nhad come for us to enter into some sort of an agreement among ourselves that\r\nwould relieve us of the annoyance and embarrassment of being divided into two\r\nantagonistic parts—prisoners and captors. I told them that it was obvious our\r\nvery existence depended upon our unity of action, that we were to all intent\r\nand purpose entering a new world as far from the seat and causes of our own\r\nworld-war as if millions of miles of space and eons of time separated us from\r\nour past lives and habitations.\r\n\r\n“There is no reason why we should carry our racial and political hatreds into\r\nCaprona,” I insisted. “The Germans among us might kill all the English, or the\r\nEnglish might kill the last German, without affecting in the slightest degree\r\neither the outcome of even the smallest skirmish upon the western front or the\r\nopinion of a single individual in any belligerent or neutral country. I\r\ntherefore put the issue squarely to you all; shall we bury our animosities and\r\nwork together with and for one another while we remain upon Caprona, or must we\r\ncontinue thus divided and but half armed, possibly until death has claimed the\r\nlast of us? And let me tell you, if you have not already realized it, the\r\nchances are a thousand to one that not one of us ever will see the outside\r\nworld again. We are safe now in the matter of food and water; we could\r\nprovision the _U_-33 for a long cruise; but we are practically out of\r\nfuel, and without fuel we cannot hope to reach the ocean, as only a submarine\r\ncan pass through the barrier cliffs. What is your answer?” I turned toward von\r\nSchoenvorts.\r\n\r\nHe eyed me in that disagreeable way of his and demanded to know, in case they\r\naccepted my suggestion, what their status would be in event of our finding a\r\nway to escape with the _U_-33. I replied that I felt that if we had all\r\nworked loyally together we should leave Caprona upon a common footing, and to\r\nthat end I suggested that should the remote possibility of our escape in the\r\nsubmarine develop into reality, we should then immediately make for the nearest\r\nneutral port and give ourselves into the hands of the authorities, when we\r\nshould all probably be interned for the duration of the war. To my surprise he\r\nagreed that this was fair and told me that they would accept my conditions and\r\nthat I could depend upon their loyalty to the common cause.\r\n\r\nI thanked him and then addressed each one of his men individually, and each\r\ngave me his word that he would abide by all that I had outlined. It was further\r\nunderstood that we were to act as a military organization under military rules\r\nand discipline—I as commander, with Bradley as my first lieutenant and Olson as\r\nmy second, in command of the Englishmen; while von Schoenvorts was to act as an\r\nadditional second lieutenant and have charge of his own men. The four of us\r\nwere to constitute a military court under which men might be tried and\r\nsentenced to punishment for infraction of military rules and discipline, even\r\nto the passing of the death-sentence.\r\n\r\nI then had arms and ammunition issued to the Germans, and leaving Bradley and\r\nfive men to guard the _U_-33, the balance of us went ashore. The first\r\nthing we did was to taste the water of the little stream—which, to our delight,\r\nwe found sweet, pure and cold. This stream was entirely free from dangerous\r\nreptiles, because, as I later discovered, they became immediately dormant when\r\nsubjected to a much lower temperature than 70 degrees Fahrenheit. They dislike\r\ncold water and keep as far away from it as possible. There were countless\r\nbrook-trout here, and deep holes that invited us to bathe, and along the bank\r\nof the stream were trees bearing a close resemblance to ash and beech and oak,\r\ntheir characteristics evidently induced by the lower temperature of the air\r\nabove the cold water and by the fact that their roots were watered by the water\r\nfrom the stream rather than from the warm springs which we afterward found in\r\nsuch abundance elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOur first concern was to fill the water tanks of the _U_-33 with fresh\r\nwater, and that having been accomplished, we set out to hunt for game and\r\nexplore inland for a short distance. Olson, von Schoenvorts, two Englishmen and\r\ntwo Germans accompanied me, leaving ten to guard the ship and the girl. I had\r\nintended leaving Nobs behind, but he got away and joined me and was so happy\r\nover it that I hadn’t the heart to send him back. We followed the stream upward\r\nthrough a beautiful country for about five miles, and then came upon its source\r\nin a little boulder-strewn clearing. From among the rocks bubbled fully twenty\r\nice-cold springs. North of the clearing rose sandstone cliffs to a height of\r\nsome fifty to seventy-five feet, with tall trees growing at their base and\r\nalmost concealing them from our view. To the west the country was flat and\r\nsparsely wooded, and here it was that we saw our first game—a large red deer.\r\nIt was grazing away from us and had not seen us when one of my men called my\r\nattention to it. Motioning for silence and having the rest of the party lie\r\ndown, I crept toward the quarry, accompanied only by Whitely. We got within a\r\nhundred yards of the deer when he suddenly raised his antlered head and pricked\r\nup his great ears. We both fired at once and had the satisfaction of seeing the\r\nbuck drop; then we ran forward to finish him with our knives. The deer lay in a\r\nsmall open space close to a clump of acacias, and we had advanced to within\r\nseveral yards of our kill when we both halted suddenly and simultaneously.\r\nWhitely looked at me, and I looked at Whitely, and then we both looked back in\r\nthe direction of the deer.\r\n\r\n“Blime!” he said. “Wot is hit, sir?”\r\n\r\n“It looks to me, Whitely, like an error,” I said; “some assistant god who had\r\nbeen creating elephants must have been temporarily transferred to the\r\nlizard-department.”\r\n\r\n“Hi wouldn’t s’y that, sir,” said Whitely; “it sounds blasphemous.”\r\n\r\n“It is no more blasphemous than that thing which is swiping our meat,” I\r\nreplied, for whatever the thing was, it had leaped upon our deer and was\r\ndevouring it in great mouthfuls which it swallowed without mastication. The\r\ncreature appeared to be a great lizard at least ten feet high, with a huge,\r\npowerful tail as long as its torso, mighty hind legs and short forelegs. When\r\nit had advanced from the wood, it hopped much after the fashion of a kangaroo,\r\nusing its hind feet and tail to propel it, and when it stood erect, it sat upon\r\nits tail. Its head was long and thick, with a blunt muzzle, and the opening of\r\nthe jaws ran back to a point behind the eyes, and the jaws were armed with long\r\nsharp teeth. The scaly body was covered with black and yellow spots about a\r\nfoot in diameter and irregular in contour. These spots were outlined in red\r\nwith edgings about an inch wide. The underside of the chest, body and tail were\r\na greenish white.\r\n\r\n“Wot s’y we pot the bloomin’ bird, sir?” suggested Whitely.\r\n\r\nI told him to wait until I gave the word; then we would fire simultaneously, he\r\nat the heart and I at the spine.\r\n\r\n“Hat the ’eart, sir—yes, sir,” he replied, and raised his piece to his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nOur shots rang out together. The thing raised its head and looked about until\r\nits eyes rested upon us; then it gave vent to a most appalling hiss that rose\r\nto the crescendo of a terrific shriek and came for us.\r\n\r\n“Beat it, Whitely!” I cried as I turned to run.\r\n\r\nWe were about a quarter of a mile from the rest of our party, and in full sight\r\nof them as they lay in the tall grass watching us. That they saw all that had\r\nhappened was evidenced by the fact that they now rose and ran toward us, and at\r\ntheir head leaped Nobs. The creature in our rear was gaining on us rapidly when\r\nNobs flew past me like a meteor and rushed straight for the frightful reptile.\r\nI tried to recall him, but he would pay no attention to me, and as I couldn’t\r\nsee him sacrificed, I, too, stopped and faced the monster. The creature\r\nappeared to be more impressed with Nobs than by us and our firearms, for it\r\nstopped as the Airedale dashed at it growling, and struck at him viciously with\r\nits powerful jaws.\r\n\r\nNobs, though, was lightning by comparison with the slow thinking beast and\r\ndodged his opponent’s thrust with ease. Then he raced to the rear of the\r\ntremendous thing and seized it by the tail. There Nobs made the error of his\r\nlife. Within that mottled organ were the muscles of a Titan, the force of a\r\ndozen mighty catapults, and the owner of the tail was fully aware of the\r\npossibilities which it contained. With a single flip of the tip it sent poor\r\nNobs sailing through the air a hundred feet above the ground, straight back\r\ninto the clump of acacias from which the beast had leaped upon our kill—and\r\nthen the grotesque thing sank lifeless to the ground.\r\n\r\nOlson and von Schoenvorts came up a minute later with their men; then we all\r\ncautiously approached the still form upon the ground. The creature was quite\r\ndead, and an examination resulted in disclosing the fact that Whitely’s bullet\r\nhad pierced its heart, and mine had severed the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n“But why didn’t it die instantly?” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Because,” said von Schoenvorts in his disagreeable way, “the beast is so\r\nlarge, and its nervous organization of so low a caliber, that it took all this\r\ntime for the intelligence of death to reach and be impressed upon the minute\r\nbrain. The thing was dead when your bullets struck it; but it did not know it\r\nfor several seconds—possibly a minute. If I am not mistaken, it is an\r\nAllosaurus of the Upper Jurassic, remains of which have been found in Central\r\nWyoming, in the suburbs of New York.”\r\n\r\nAn Irishman by the name of Brady grinned. I afterward learned that he had\r\nserved three years on the traffic-squad of the Chicago police force.\r\n\r\nI had been calling Nobs in the meantime and was about to set out in search of\r\nhim, fearing, to tell the truth, to do so lest I find him mangled and dead\r\namong the trees of the acacia grove, when he suddenly emerged from among the\r\nboles, his ears flattened, his tail between his legs and his body screwed into\r\na suppliant S. He was unharmed except for minor bruises; but he was the most\r\nchastened dog I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nWe gathered up what was left of the red deer after skinning and cleaning it,\r\nand set out upon our return journey toward the U-boat. On the way Olson, von\r\nSchoenvorts and I discussed the needs of our immediate future, and we were\r\nunanimous in placing foremost the necessity of a permanent camp on shore. The\r\ninterior of a U-boat is about as impossible and uncomfortable an abiding-place\r\nas one can well imagine, and in this warm climate, and in warm water, it was\r\nalmost unendurable. So we decided to construct a palisaded camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we strolled slowly back toward the boat, planning and discussing this, we\r\nwere suddenly startled by a loud and unmistakable detonation.\r\n\r\n“A shell from the _U_-33!” exclaimed von Schoenvorts.\r\n\r\n“What can be after signifyin’?” queried Olson.\r\n\r\n“They are in trouble,” I answered for all, “and it’s up to us to get back to\r\nthem. Drop that carcass,” I directed the men carrying the meat, “and follow\r\nme!” I set off at a rapid run in the direction of the harbor.\r\n\r\nWe ran for the better part of a mile without hearing anything more from the\r\ndirection of the harbor, and then I reduced the speed to a walk, for the\r\nexercise was telling on us who had been cooped up for so long in the confined\r\ninterior of the _U_-33. Puffing and panting, we plodded on until within\r\nabout a mile of the harbor we came upon a sight that brought us all up\r\nstanding. We had been passing through a little heavier timber than was usual to\r\nthis part of the country, when we suddenly emerged into an open space in the\r\ncenter of which was such a band as might have caused the most courageous to\r\npause. It consisted of upward of five hundred individuals representing several\r\nspecies closely allied to man. There were anthropoid apes and gorillas—these I\r\nhad no difficulty in recognizing; but there were other forms which I had never\r\nbefore seen, and I was hard put to it to say whether they were ape or man. Some\r\nof them resembled the corpse we had found upon the narrow beach against\r\nCaprona’s sea-wall, while others were of a still lower type, more nearly\r\nresembling the apes, and yet others were uncannily manlike, standing there\r\nerect, being less hairy and possessing better shaped heads.\r\n\r\nThere was one among the lot, evidently the leader of them, who bore a close\r\nresemblance to the so-called Neanderthal man of La Chapelle-aux-Saints. There\r\nwas the same short, stocky trunk upon which rested an enormous head habitually\r\nbent forward into the same curvature as the back, the arms shorter than the\r\nlegs, and the lower leg considerably shorter than that of modern man, the knees\r\nbent forward and never straightened. This creature and one or two others who\r\nappeared to be of a lower order than he, yet higher than that of the apes,\r\ncarried heavy clubs; the others were armed only with giant muscles and fighting\r\nfangs—nature’s weapons. All were males, and all were entirely naked; nor was\r\nthere upon even the highest among them a sign of ornamentation.\r\n\r\nAt sight of us they turned with bared fangs and low growls to confront us. I\r\ndid not wish to fire among them unless it became absolutely necessary, and so I\r\nstarted to lead my party around them; but the instant that the Neanderthal man\r\nguessed my intention, he evidently attributed it to cowardice upon our part,\r\nand with a wild cry he leaped toward us, waving his cudgel above his head. The\r\nothers followed him, and in a minute we should have been overwhelmed. I gave\r\nthe order to fire, and at the first volley six of them went down, including the\r\nNeanderthal man. The others hesitated a moment and then broke for the trees,\r\nsome running nimbly among the branches, while others lost themselves to us\r\nbetween the boles. Both von Schoenvorts and I noticed that at least two of the\r\nhigher, manlike types took to the trees quite as nimbly as the apes, while\r\nothers that more nearly approached man in carriage and appearance sought safety\r\nupon the ground with the gorillas.\r\n\r\nAn examination disclosed that five of our erstwhile opponents were dead and the\r\nsixth, the Neanderthal man, was but slightly wounded, a bullet having glanced\r\nfrom his thick skull, stunning him. We decided to take him with us to camp, and\r\nby means of belts we managed to secure his hands behind his back and place a\r\nleash around his neck before he regained consciousness. We then retraced our\r\nsteps for our meat being convinced by our own experience that those aboard the\r\n_U_-33 had been able to frighten off this party with a single shell—but\r\nwhen we came to where we had left the deer it had disappeared.\r\n\r\nOn the return journey Whitely and I preceded the rest of the party by about a\r\nhundred yards in the hope of getting another shot at something edible, for we\r\nwere all greatly disgusted and disappointed by the loss of our venison. Whitely\r\nand I advanced very cautiously, and not having the whole party with us, we\r\nfared better than on the journey out, bagging two large antelope not a\r\nhalf-mile from the harbor; so with our game and our prisoner we made a cheerful\r\nreturn to the boat, where we found that all were safe. On the shore a little\r\nnorth of where we lay there were the corpses of twenty of the wild creatures\r\nwho had attacked Bradley and his party in our absence, and the rest of whom we\r\nhad met and scattered a few minutes later.\r\n\r\nWe felt that we had taught these wild ape-men a lesson and that because of it\r\nwe would be safer in the future—at least safer from them; but we decided not to\r\nabate our carefulness one whit, feeling that this new world was filled with\r\nterrors still unknown to us; nor were we wrong.\r\n\r\nThe following morning we commenced work upon our camp, Bradley, Olson, von\r\nSchoenvorts, Miss La Rue, and I having sat up half the night discussing the\r\nmatter and drawing plans. We set the men at work felling trees, selecting for\r\nthe purpose jarrah, a hard, weather-resisting timber which grew in profusion\r\nnear by. Half the men labored while the other half stood guard, alternating\r\neach hour with an hour off at noon. Olson directed this work. Bradley, von\r\nSchoenvorts and I, with Miss La Rue’s help, staked out the various buildings\r\nand the outer wall. When the day was done, we had quite an array of logs nicely\r\nnotched and ready for our building operations on the morrow, and we were all\r\ntired, for after the buildings had been staked out we all fell in and helped\r\nwith the logging—all but von Schoenvorts. He, being a Prussian and a gentleman,\r\ncouldn’t stoop to such menial labor in the presence of his men, and I didn’t\r\nsee fit to ask it of him, as the work was purely voluntary upon our part. He\r\nspent the afternoon shaping a swagger-stick from the branch of jarrah and\r\ntalking with Miss La Rue, who had sufficiently unbent toward him to notice his\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWe saw nothing of the wild men of the previous day, and only once were we\r\nmenaced by any of the strange denizens of Caprona, when some frightful\r\nnightmare of the sky swooped down upon us, only to be driven off by a fusillade\r\nof bullets. The thing appeared to be some variety of pterodactyl, and what with\r\nits enormous size and ferocious aspect was most awe-inspiring. There was\r\nanother incident, too, which to me at least was far more unpleasant than the\r\nsudden onslaught of the prehistoric reptile. Two of the men, both Germans, were\r\nstripping a felled tree of its branches. Von Schoenvorts had completed his\r\nswagger-stick, and he and I were passing close to where the two worked.\r\n\r\nOne of them threw to his rear a small branch that he had just chopped off, and\r\nas misfortune would have it, it struck von Schoenvorts across the face. It\r\ncouldn’t have hurt him, for it didn’t leave a mark; but he flew into a terrific\r\nrage, shouting: “Attention!” in a loud voice. The sailor immediately\r\nstraightened up, faced his officer, clicked his heels together and saluted.\r\n“Pig!” roared the Baron, and struck the fellow across the face, breaking his\r\nnose. I grabbed von Schoenvorts’ arm and jerked him away before he could strike\r\nagain, if such had been his intention, and then he raised his little stick to\r\nstrike me; but before it descended the muzzle of my pistol was against his\r\nbelly and he must have seen in my eyes that nothing would suit me better than\r\nan excuse to pull the trigger. Like all his kind and all other bullies, von\r\nSchoenvorts was a coward at heart, and so he dropped his hand to his side and\r\nstarted to turn away; but I pulled him back, and there before his men I told\r\nhim that such a thing must never again occur—that no man was to be struck or\r\notherwise punished other than in due process of the laws that we had made and\r\nthe court that we had established. All the time the sailor stood rigidly at\r\nattention, nor could I tell from his expression whether he most resented the\r\nblow his officer had struck him or my interference in the gospel of the\r\nKaiser-breed. Nor did he move until I said to him: “Plesser, you may return to\r\nyour quarters and dress your wound.” Then he saluted and marched stiffly off\r\ntoward the _U_-33.\r\n\r\nJust before dusk we moved out into the bay a hundred yards from shore and\r\ndropped anchor, for I felt that we should be safer there than elsewhere. I also\r\ndetailed men to stand watch during the night and appointed Olson officer of the\r\nwatch for the entire night, telling him to bring his blankets on deck and get\r\nwhat rest he could. At dinner we tasted our first roast Caprona antelope, and\r\nwe had a mess of greens that the cook had found growing along the stream. All\r\nduring the meal von Schoenvorts was silent and surly.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we all went on deck and watched the unfamiliar scenes of a\r\nCapronian night—that is, all but von Schoenvorts. There was less to see than to\r\nhear. From the great inland lake behind us came the hissing and the screaming\r\nof countless saurians. Above us we heard the flap of giant wings, while from\r\nthe shore rose the multitudinous voices of a tropical jungle—of a warm, damp\r\natmosphere such as must have enveloped the entire earth during the Palezeoic\r\nand Mesozoic eras. But here were intermingled the voices of later eras—the\r\nscream of the panther, the roar of the lion, the baying of wolves and a\r\nthunderous growling which we could attribute to nothing earthly but which one\r\nday we were to connect with the most fearsome of ancient creatures.\r\n\r\nOne by one the others went to their rooms, until the girl and I were left alone\r\ntogether, for I had permitted the watch to go below for a few minutes, knowing\r\nthat I would be on deck. Miss La Rue was very quiet, though she replied\r\ngraciously enough to whatever I had to say that required reply. I asked her if\r\nshe did not feel well.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, “but I am depressed by the awfulness of it all. I feel of so\r\nlittle consequence—so small and helpless in the face of all these myriad\r\nmanifestations of life stripped to the bone of its savagery and brutality. I\r\nrealize as never before how cheap and valueless a thing is life. Life seems a\r\njoke, a cruel, grim joke. You are a laughable incident or a terrifying one as\r\nyou happen to be less powerful or more powerful than some other form of life\r\nwhich crosses your path; but as a rule you are of no moment whatsoever to\r\nanything but yourself. You are a comic little figure, hopping from the cradle\r\nto the grave. Yes, that is our trouble—we take ourselves too seriously; but\r\nCaprona should be a sure cure for that.” She paused and laughed.\r\n\r\n“You have evolved a beautiful philosophy,” I said. “It fills such a longing in\r\nthe human breast. It is full, it is satisfying, it is ennobling. What wondrous\r\nstrides toward perfection the human race might have made if the first man had\r\nevolved it and it had persisted until now as the creed of humanity.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like irony,” she said; “it indicates a small soul.”\r\n\r\n“What other sort of soul, then, would you expect from ‘a comic little figure\r\nhopping from the cradle to the grave’?” I inquired. “And what difference does\r\nit make, anyway, what you like and what you don’t like? You are here for but an\r\ninstant, and you mustn’t take yourself too seriously.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me with a smile. “I imagine that I am frightened and blue,”\r\nshe said, “and I know that I am very, very homesick and lonely.” There was\r\nalmost a sob in her voice as she concluded. It was the first time that she had\r\nspoken thus to me. Involuntarily, I laid my hand upon hers where it rested on\r\nthe rail.\r\n\r\n“I know how difficult your position is,” I said; “but don’t feel that you are\r\nalone. There is—is one here who—who would do anything in the world for you,” I\r\nended lamely. She did not withdraw her hand, and she looked up into my face\r\nwith tears on her cheeks and I read in her eyes the thanks her lips could not\r\nvoice. Then she looked away across the weird moonlit landscape and sighed.\r\nEvidently her new-found philosophy had tumbled about her ears, for she was\r\nseemingly taking herself seriously. I wanted to take her in my arms and tell\r\nher how I loved her, and had taken her hand from the rail and started to draw\r\nher toward me when Olson came blundering up on deck with his bedding.\r\n\r\nThe following morning we started building operations in earnest, and things\r\nprogressed finely. The Neanderthal man was something of a care, for we had to\r\nkeep him in irons all the time, and he was mighty savage when approached; but\r\nafter a time he became more docile, and then we tried to discover if he had a\r\nlanguage. Lys spent a great deal of time talking to him and trying to draw him\r\nout; but for a long while she was unsuccessful. It took us three weeks to build\r\nall the houses, which we constructed close by a cold spring some two miles from\r\nthe harbor.\r\n\r\nWe changed our plans a trifle when it came to building the palisade, for we\r\nfound a rotted cliff near by where we could get all the flat building-stone we\r\nneeded, and so we constructed a stone wall entirely around the buildings. It\r\nwas in the form of a square, with bastions and towers at each corner which\r\nwould permit an enfilading fire along any side of the fort, and was about one\r\nhundred and thirty-five feet square on the outside, with walls three feet thick\r\nat the bottom and about a foot and a half wide at the top, and fifteen feet\r\nhigh. It took a long time to build that wall, and we all turned in and helped\r\nexcept von Schoenvorts, who, by the way, had not spoken to me except in the\r\nline of official business since our encounter—a condition of armed neutrality\r\nwhich suited me to a T. We have just finished it, the last touches being put on\r\ntoday. I quit about a week ago and commenced working on this chronicle for our\r\nstrange adventures, which will account for any minor errors in chronology which\r\nmay have crept in; there was so much material that I may have made some\r\nmistakes, but I think they are but minor and few.\r\n\r\nI see in reading over the last few pages that I neglected to state that Lys\r\nfinally discovered that the Neanderthal man possessed a language. She has\r\nlearned to speak it, and so have I, to some extent. It was he—his name he says\r\nis Am, or Ahm—who told us that this country is called Caspak. When we asked him\r\nhow far it extended, he waved both arms about his head in an all-including\r\ngesture which took in, apparently, the entire universe. He is more tractable\r\nnow, and we are going to release him, for he has assured us that he will not\r\npermit his fellows to harm us. He calls us Galus and says that in a short time\r\nhe will be a Galu. It is not quite clear to us what he means. He says that\r\nthere are many Galus north of us, and that as soon as he becomes one he will go\r\nand live with them.\r\n\r\nAhm went out to hunt with us yesterday and was much impressed by the ease with\r\nwhich our rifles brought down antelopes and deer. We have been living upon the\r\nfat of the land, Ahm having shown us the edible fruits, tubers and herbs, and\r\ntwice a week we go out after fresh meat. A certain proportion of this we dry\r\nand store away, for we do not know what may come. Our drying process is really\r\nsmoking. We have also dried a large quantity of two varieties of cereal which\r\ngrow wild a few miles south of us. One of these is a giant Indian maize—a lofty\r\nperennial often fifty and sixty feet in height, with ears the size of a man’s\r\nbody and kernels as large as your fist. We have had to construct a second store\r\nhouse for the great quantity of this that we have gathered.\r\n\r\n_September_ 3, 1916: Three months ago today the torpedo from the\r\n_U_-33 started me from the peaceful deck of the American liner upon the\r\nstrange voyage which has ended here in Caspak. We have settled down to an\r\nacceptance of our fate, for all are convinced that none of us will ever see the\r\nouter world again. Ahm’s repeated assertions that there are human beings like\r\nourselves in Caspak have roused the men to a keen desire for exploration. I\r\nsent out one party last week under Bradley. Ahm, who is now free to go and come\r\nas he wishes, accompanied them. They marched about twenty-five miles due west,\r\nencountering many terrible beasts and reptiles and not a few manlike creatures\r\nwhom Ahm sent away. Here is Bradley’s report of the expedition:\r\n\r\nMarched fifteen miles the first day, camping on the bank of a large stream\r\nwhich runs southward. Game was plentiful and we saw several varieties which we\r\nhad not before encountered in Caspak. Just before making camp we were charged\r\nby an enormous woolly rhinoceros, which Plesser dropped with a perfect shot. We\r\nhad rhinoceros-steaks for supper. Ahm called the thing “Atis.” It was almost a\r\ncontinuous battle from the time we left the fort until we arrived at camp. The\r\nmind of man can scarce conceive the plethora of carnivorous life in this lost\r\nworld; and their prey, of course, is even more abundant.\r\n\r\nThe second day we marched about ten miles to the foot of the cliffs. Passed\r\nthrough dense forests close to the base of the cliffs. Saw manlike creatures\r\nand a low order of ape in one band, and some of the men swore that there was a\r\nwhite man among them. They were inclined to attack us at first; but a volley\r\nfrom our rifles caused them to change their minds. We scaled the cliffs as far\r\nas we could; but near the top they are absolutely perpendicular without any\r\nsufficient cleft or protuberance to give hand or foot-hold. All were\r\ndisappointed, for we hungered for a view of the ocean and the outside world. We\r\neven had a hope that we might see and attract the attention of a passing ship.\r\nOur exploration has determined one thing which will probably be of little value\r\nto us and never heard of beyond Caprona’s walls—this crater was once entirely\r\nfilled with water. Indisputable evidence of this is on the face of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nOur return journey occupied two days and was as filled with adventure as usual.\r\nWe are all becoming accustomed to adventure. It is beginning to pall on us. We\r\nsuffered no casualties and there was no illness.\r\n\r\nI had to smile as I read Bradley’s report. In those four days he had doubtless\r\npassed through more adventures than an African big-game hunter experiences in a\r\nlifetime, and yet he covered it all in a few lines. Yes, we are becoming\r\naccustomed to adventure. Not a day passes that one or more of us does not face\r\ndeath at least once. Ahm taught us a few things that have proved profitable and\r\nsaved us much ammunition, which it is useless to expend except for food or in\r\nthe last recourse of self-preservation. Now when we are attacked by large\r\nflying reptiles we run beneath spreading trees; when land carnivora threaten\r\nus, we climb into trees, and we have learned not to fire at any of the\r\ndinosaurs unless we can keep out of their reach for at least two minutes after\r\nhitting them in the brain or spine, or five minutes after puncturing their\r\nhearts—it takes them so long to die. To hit them elsewhere is worse than\r\nuseless, for they do not seem to notice it, and we had discovered that such\r\nshots do not kill or even disable them.\r\n\r\n_September_ 7, 1916: Much has happened since I last wrote. Bradley is away\r\nagain on another exploration expedition to the cliffs. He expects to be gone\r\nseveral weeks and to follow along their base in search of a point where they\r\nmay be scaled. He took Sinclair, Brady, James, and Tippet with him. Ahm has\r\ndisappeared. He has been gone about three days; but the most startling thing I\r\nhave on record is that von Schoenvorts and Olson while out hunting the other\r\nday discovered oil about fifteen miles north of us beyond the sandstone cliffs.\r\nOlson says there is a geyser of oil there, and von Schoenvorts is making\r\npreparations to refine it. If he succeeds, we shall have the means for leaving\r\nCaspak and returning to our own world. I can scarce believe the truth of it. We\r\nare all elated to the seventh heaven of bliss. Pray God we shall not be\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nI have tried on several occasions to broach the subject of my love to Lys; but\r\nshe will not listen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 8, 1916: This is the last entry I shall make upon my manuscript. When\r\nthis is done, I shall be through. Though I may pray that it reaches the haunts\r\nof civilized man, my better judgment tells me that it will never be perused by\r\nother eyes than mine, and that even though it should, it would be too late to\r\navail me. I am alone upon the summit of the great cliff overlooking the broad\r\nPacific. A chill south wind bites at my marrow, while far below me I can see\r\nthe tropic foliage of Caspak on the one hand and huge icebergs from the near\r\nAntarctic upon the other. Presently I shall stuff my folded manuscript into the\r\nthermos bottle I have carried with me for the purpose since I left the\r\nfort—Fort Dinosaur we named it—and hurl it far outward over the cliff-top into\r\nthe Pacific. What current washes the shore of Caprona I know not; whither my\r\nbottle will be borne I cannot even guess; but I have done all that mortal man\r\nmay do to notify the world of my whereabouts and the dangers that threaten\r\nthose of us who remain alive in Caspak—if there be any other than myself.\r\n\r\nAbout the 8th of September I accompanied Olson and von Schoenvorts to the\r\noil-geyser. Lys came with us, and we took a number of things which von\r\nSchoenvorts wanted for the purpose of erecting a crude refinery. We went up the\r\ncoast some ten or twelve miles in the _U_-33, tying up to shore near the\r\nmouth of a small stream which emptied great volumes of crude oil into the sea—I\r\nfind it difficult to call this great lake by any other name. Then we\r\ndisembarked and went inland about five miles, where we came upon a small lake\r\nentirely filled with oil, from the center of which a geyser of oil spouted.\r\n\r\nOn the edge of the lake we helped von Schoenvorts build his primitive refinery.\r\nWe worked with him for two days until he got things fairly well started, and\r\nthen we returned to Fort Dinosaur, as I feared that Bradley might return and be\r\nworried by our absence. The _U_-33 merely landed those of us that were to\r\nreturn to the fort and then retraced its course toward the oil-well. Olson,\r\nWhitely, Wilson, Miss La Rue, and myself disembarked, while von Schoenvorts and\r\nhis German crew returned to refine the oil. The next day Plesser and two other\r\nGermans came down overland for ammunition. Plesser said they had been attacked\r\nby wild men and had exhausted a great deal of ammunition. He also asked\r\npermission to get some dried meat and maize, saying that they were so busy with\r\nthe work of refining that they had no time to hunt. I let him have everything\r\nhe asked for, and never once did a suspicion of their intentions enter my mind.\r\nThey returned to the oil-well the same day, while we continued with the\r\nmultitudinous duties of camp life.\r\n\r\nFor three days nothing of moment occurred. Bradley did not return; nor did we\r\nhave any word from von Schoenvorts. In the evening Lys and I went up into one\r\nof the bastion towers and listened to the grim and terrible nightlife of the\r\nfrightful ages of the past. Once a saber-tooth screamed almost beneath us, and\r\nthe girl shrank close against me. As I felt her body against mine, all the pent\r\nlove of these three long months shattered the bonds of timidity and conviction,\r\nand I swept her up into my arms and covered her face and lips with kisses. She\r\ndid not struggle to free herself; but instead her dear arms crept up about my\r\nneck and drew my own face even closer to hers.\r\n\r\n“You love me, Lys?” I cried.\r\n\r\nI felt her head nod an affirmative against my breast. “Tell me, Lys,” I begged,\r\n“tell me in words how much you love me.”\r\n\r\nLow and sweet and tender came the answer: “I love you beyond all conception.”\r\n\r\nMy heart filled with rapture then, and it fills now as it has each of the\r\ncountless times I have recalled those dear words, as it shall fill always until\r\ndeath has claimed me. I may never see her again; she may not know how I love\r\nher—she may question, she may doubt; but always true and steady, and warm with\r\nthe fires of love my heart beats for the girl who said that night: “I love you\r\nbeyond all conception.”\r\n\r\nFor a long time we sat there upon the little bench constructed for the sentry\r\nthat we had not as yet thought it necessary to post in more than one of the\r\nfour towers. We learned to know one another better in those two brief hours\r\nthan we had in all the months that had intervened since we had been thrown\r\ntogether. She told me that she had loved me from the first, and that she never\r\nhad loved von Schoenvorts, their engagement having been arranged by her aunt\r\nfor social reasons.\r\n\r\nThat was the happiest evening of my life; nor ever do I expect to experience\r\nits like; but at last, as is the way of happiness, it terminated. We descended\r\nto the compound, and I walked with Lys to the door of her quarters. There again\r\nshe kissed me and bade me good night, and then she went in and closed the door.\r\n\r\nI went to my own room, and there I sat by the light of one of the crude candles\r\nwe had made from the tallow of the beasts we had killed, and lived over the\r\nevents of the evening. At last I turned in and fell asleep, dreaming happy\r\ndreams and planning for the future, for even in savage Caspak I was bound to\r\nmake my girl safe and happy. It was daylight when I awoke. Wilson, who was\r\nacting as cook, was up and astir at his duties in the cook-house. The others\r\nslept; but I arose and followed by Nobs went down to the stream for a plunge.\r\nAs was our custom, I went armed with both rifle and revolver; but I stripped\r\nand had my swim without further disturbance than the approach of a large hyena,\r\na number of which occupied caves in the sand-stone cliffs north of the camp.\r\nThese brutes are enormous and exceedingly ferocious. I imagine they correspond\r\nwith the cave-hyena of prehistoric times. This fellow charged Nobs, whose\r\nCapronian experiences had taught him that discretion is the better part of\r\nvalor—with the result that he dived head foremost into the stream beside me\r\nafter giving vent to a series of ferocious growls which had no more effect upon\r\n_Hyaena spelaeus_ than might a sweet smile upon an enraged tusker.\r\nAfterward I shot the beast, and Nobs had a feast while I dressed, for he had\r\nbecome quite a raw-meat eater during our numerous hunting expeditions, upon\r\nwhich we always gave him a portion of the kill.\r\n\r\nWhitely and Olson were up and dressed when we returned, and we all sat down to\r\na good breakfast. I could not but wonder at Lys’ absence from the table, for\r\nshe had always been one of the earliest risers in camp; so about nine o’clock,\r\nbecoming apprehensive lest she might be indisposed, I went to the door of her\r\nroom and knocked. I received no response, though I finally pounded with all my\r\nstrength; then I turned the knob and entered, only to find that she was not\r\nthere. Her bed had been occupied, and her clothing lay where she had placed it\r\nthe previous night upon retiring; but Lys was gone. To say that I was\r\ndistracted with terror would be to put it mildly. Though I knew she could not\r\nbe in camp, I searched every square inch of the compound and all the buildings,\r\nyet without avail.\r\n\r\nIt was Whitely who discovered the first clue—a huge human-like footprint in the\r\nsoft earth beside the spring, and indications of a struggle in the mud.\r\n\r\nThen I found a tiny handkerchief close to the outer wall. Lys had been stolen!\r\nIt was all too plain. Some hideous member of the ape-man tribe had entered the\r\nfort and carried her off. While I stood stunned and horrified at the frightful\r\nevidence before me, there came from the direction of the great lake an\r\nincreasing sound that rose to the volume of a shriek. We all looked up as the\r\nnoise approached apparently just above us, and a moment later there followed a\r\nterrific explosion which hurled us to the ground. When we clambered to our\r\nfeet, we saw a large section of the west wall torn and shattered. It was Olson\r\nwho first recovered from his daze sufficiently to guess the explanation of the\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\n“A shell!” he cried. “And there ain’t no shells in Caspak besides what’s on the\r\n_U_-33. The dirty boches are shellin’ the fort. Come on!” And he grasped\r\nhis rifle and started on a run toward the lake. It was over two miles, but we\r\ndid not pause until the harbor was in view, and still we could not see the lake\r\nbecause of the sandstone cliffs which intervened. We ran as fast as we could\r\naround the lower end of the harbor, scrambled up the cliffs and at last stood\r\nupon their summit in full view of the lake. Far away down the coast, toward the\r\nriver through which we had come to reach the lake, we saw upon the surface the\r\noutline of the _U_-33, black smoke vomiting from her funnel.\r\n\r\nVon Schoenvorts had succeeded in refining the oil! The cur had broken his every\r\npledge and was leaving us there to our fates. He had even shelled the fort as a\r\nparting compliment; nor could anything have been more truly Prussian than this\r\nleave-taking of the Baron Friedrich von Schoenvorts.\r\n\r\nOlson, Whitely, Wilson, and I stood for a moment looking at one another. It\r\nseemed incredible that man could be so perfidious—that we had really seen with\r\nour own eyes the thing that we had seen; but when we returned to the fort, the\r\nshattered wall gave us ample evidence that there was no mistake.\r\n\r\nThen we began to speculate as to whether it had been an ape-man or a Prussian\r\nthat had abducted Lys. From what we knew of von Schoenvorts, we would not have\r\nbeen surprised at anything from him; but the footprints by the spring seemed\r\nindisputable evidence that one of Caprona’s undeveloped men had borne off the\r\ngirl I loved.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had assured myself that such was the case, I made my preparations\r\nto follow and rescue her. Olson, Whitely, and Wilson each wished to accompany\r\nme; but I told them that they were needed here, since with Bradley’s party\r\nstill absent and the Germans gone it was necessary that we conserve our force\r\nas far as might be possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a sad leave-taking as in silence I shook hands with each of the three\r\nremaining men. Even poor Nobs appeared dejected as we quit the compound and set\r\nout upon the well-marked spoor of the abductor. Not once did I turn my eyes\r\nbackward toward Fort Dinosaur. I have not looked upon it since—nor in all\r\nlikelihood shall I ever look upon it again. The trail led northwest until it\r\nreached the western end of the sandstone cliffs to the north of the fort; there\r\nit ran into a well-defined path which wound northward into a country we had not\r\nas yet explored. It was a beautiful, gently rolling country, broken by\r\noccasional outcroppings of sandstone and by patches of dense forest relieved by\r\nopen, park-like stretches and broad meadows whereon grazed countless\r\nherbivorous animals—red deer, aurochs, and infinite variety of antelope and at\r\nleast three distinct species of horse, the latter ranging in size from a\r\ncreature about as large as Nobs to a magnificent animal fourteen to sixteen\r\nhands high. These creatures fed together in perfect amity; nor did they show\r\nany great indications of terror when Nobs and I approached. They moved out of\r\nour way and kept their eyes upon us until we had passed; then they resumed\r\ntheir feeding.\r\n\r\nThe path led straight across the clearing into another forest, lying upon the\r\nverge of which I saw a bit of white. It appeared to stand out in marked\r\ncontrast and incongruity to all its surroundings, and when I stopped to examine\r\nit, I found that it was a small strip of muslin—part of the hem of a garment.\r\nAt once I was all excitement, for I knew that it was a sign left by Lys that\r\nshe had been carried this way; it was a tiny bit torn from the hem of the\r\nundergarment that she wore in lieu of the night-robes she had lost with the\r\nsinking of the liner. Crushing the bit of fabric to my lips, I pressed on even\r\nmore rapidly than before, because I now knew that I was upon the right trail\r\nand that up to this point at least, Lys still had lived.\r\n\r\nI made over twenty miles that day, for I was now hardened to fatigue and\r\naccustomed to long hikes, having spent considerable time hunting and exploring\r\nin the immediate vicinity of camp. A dozen times that day was my life\r\nthreatened by fearsome creatures of the earth or sky, though I could not but\r\nnote that the farther north I traveled, the fewer were the great dinosaurs,\r\nthough they still persisted in lesser numbers. On the other hand the quantity\r\nof ruminants and the variety and frequency of carnivorous animals increased.\r\nEach square mile of Caspak harbored its terrors.\r\n\r\nAt intervals along the way I found bits of muslin, and often they reassured me\r\nwhen otherwise I should have been doubtful of the trail to take where two\r\ncrossed or where there were forks, as occurred at several points. And so, as\r\nnight was drawing on, I came to the southern end of a line of cliffs loftier\r\nthan any I had seen before, and as I approached them, there was wafted to my\r\nnostrils the pungent aroma of woodsmoke. What could it mean? There could, to my\r\nmind, be but a single solution: man abided close by, a higher order of man than\r\nwe had as yet seen, other than Ahm, the Neanderthal man. I wondered again as I\r\nhad so many times that day if it had not been Ahm who stole Lys.\r\n\r\nCautiously I approached the flank of the cliffs, where they terminated in an\r\nabrupt escarpment as though some all powerful hand had broken off a great\r\nsection of rock and set it upon the surface of the earth. It was now quite\r\ndark, and as I crept around the edge of the cliff, I saw at a little distance a\r\ngreat fire around which were many figures—apparently human figures. Cautioning\r\nNobs to silence, and he had learned many lessons in the value of obedience\r\nsince we had entered Caspak, I slunk forward, taking advantage of whatever\r\ncover I could find, until from behind a bush I could distinctly see the\r\ncreatures assembled by the fire. They were human and yet not human. I should\r\nsay that they were a little higher in the scale of evolution than Ahm, possibly\r\noccupying a place of evolution between that of the Neanderthal man and what is\r\nknown as the Grimaldi race. Their features were distinctly negroid, though\r\ntheir skins were white. A considerable portion of both torso and limbs were\r\ncovered with short hair, and their physical proportions were in many aspects\r\napelike, though not so much so as were Ahm’s. They carried themselves in a more\r\nerect position, although their arms were considerably longer than those of the\r\nNeanderthal man. As I watched them, I saw that they possessed a language, that\r\nthey had knowledge of fire and that they carried besides the wooden club of\r\nAhm, a thing which resembled a crude stone hatchet. Evidently they were very\r\nlow in the scale of humanity, but they were a step upward from those I had\r\npreviously seen in Caspak.\r\n\r\nBut what interested me most was the slender figure of a dainty girl, clad only\r\nin a thin bit of muslin which scarce covered her knees—a bit of muslin torn and\r\nragged about the lower hem. It was Lys, and she was alive and so far as I could\r\nsee, unharmed. A huge brute with thick lips and prognathous jaw stood at her\r\nshoulder. He was talking loudly and gesticulating wildly. I was close enough to\r\nhear his words, which were similar to the language of Ahm, though much fuller,\r\nfor there were many words I could not understand. However I caught the gist of\r\nwhat he was saying—which in effect was that he had found and captured this\r\nGalu, that she was his and that he defied anyone to question his right of\r\npossession. It appeared to me, as I afterward learned was the fact, that I was\r\nwitnessing the most primitive of marriage ceremonies. The assembled members of\r\nthe tribe looked on and listened in a sort of dull and perfunctory apathy, for\r\nthe speaker was by far the mightiest of the clan.\r\n\r\nThere seemed no one to dispute his claims when he said, or rather shouted, in\r\nstentorian tones: “I am Tsa. This is my she. Who wishes her more than Tsa?”\r\n\r\n“I do,” I said in the language of Ahm, and I stepped out into the firelight\r\nbefore them. Lys gave a little cry of joy and started toward me, but Tsa\r\ngrasped her arm and dragged her back.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” shrieked Tsa. “I kill! I kill! I kill!”\r\n\r\n“The she is mine,” I replied, “and I have come to claim her. I kill if you do\r\nnot let her come to me.” And I raised my pistol to a level with his heart. Of\r\ncourse the creature had no conception of the purpose of the strange little\r\nimplement which I was poking toward him. With a sound that was half human and\r\nhalf the growl of a wild beast, he sprang toward me. I aimed at his heart and\r\nfired, and as he sprawled headlong to the ground, the others of his tribe,\r\novercome by fright at the report of the pistol, scattered toward the\r\ncliffs—while Lys, with outstretched arms, ran toward me.\r\n\r\nAs I crushed her to me, there rose from the black night behind us and then to\r\nour right and to our left a series of frightful screams and shrieks,\r\nbellowings, roars and growls. It was the night-life of this jungle world coming\r\ninto its own—the huge, carnivorous nocturnal beasts which make the nights of\r\nCaspak hideous. A shuddering sob ran through Lys’ figure. “O God,” she cried,\r\n“give me the strength to endure, for his sake!” I saw that she was upon the\r\nverge of a breakdown, after all that she must have passed through of fear and\r\nhorror that day, and I tried to quiet and reassure her as best I might; but\r\neven to me the future looked most unpromising, for what chance of life had we\r\nagainst the frightful hunters of the night who even now were prowling closer to\r\nus?\r\n\r\nNow I turned to see what had become of the tribe, and in the fitful glare of\r\nthe fire I perceived that the face of the cliff was pitted with large holes\r\ninto which the man-things were clambering. “Come,” I said to Lys, “we must\r\nfollow them. We cannot last a half-hour out here. We must find a cave.” Already\r\nwe could see the blazing green eyes of the hungry carnivora. I seized a brand\r\nfrom the fire and hurled it out into the night, and there came back an\r\nanswering chorus of savage and rageful protest; but the eyes vanished for a\r\nshort time. Selecting a burning branch for each of us, we advanced toward the\r\ncliffs, where we were met by angry threats.\r\n\r\n“They will kill us,” said Lys. “We may as well keep on in search of another\r\nrefuge.”\r\n\r\n“They will not kill us so surely as will those others out there,” I replied. “I\r\nam going to seek shelter in one of these caves; nor will the man-things\r\nprevent.” And I kept on in the direction of the cliff’s base. A huge creature\r\nstood upon a ledge and brandished his stone hatchet. “Come and I will kill you\r\nand take the she,” he boasted.\r\n\r\n“You saw how Tsa fared when he would have kept my she,” I replied in his own\r\ntongue. “Thus will you fare and all your fellows if you do not permit us to\r\ncome in peace among you out of the dangers of the night.”\r\n\r\n“Go north,” he screamed. “Go north among the Galus, and we will not harm you.\r\nSome day will we be Galus; but now we are not. You do not belong among us. Go\r\naway or we will kill you. The she may remain if she is afraid, and we will keep\r\nher; but the he must depart.”\r\n\r\n“The he won’t depart,” I replied, and approached still nearer. Rough and narrow\r\nledges formed by nature gave access to the upper caves. A man might scale them\r\nif unhampered and unhindered, but to clamber upward in the face of a\r\nbelligerent tribe of half-men and with a girl to assist was beyond my\r\ncapability.\r\n\r\n“I do not fear you,” screamed the creature. “You were close to Tsa; but I am\r\nfar above you. You cannot harm me as you harmed Tsa. Go away!”\r\n\r\nI placed a foot upon the lowest ledge and clambered upward, reaching down and\r\npulling Lys to my side. Already I felt safer. Soon we would be out of danger of\r\nthe beasts again closing in upon us. The man above us raised his stone hatchet\r\nabove his head and leaped lightly down to meet us. His position above me gave\r\nhim a great advantage, or at least so he probably thought, for he came with\r\nevery show of confidence. I hated to do it, but there seemed no other way, and\r\nso I shot him down as I had shot down Tsa.\r\n\r\n“You see,” I cried to his fellows, “that I can kill you wherever you may be. A\r\nlong way off I can kill you as well as I can kill you near by. Let us come\r\namong you in peace. I will not harm you if you do not harm us. We will take a\r\ncave high up. Speak!”\r\n\r\n“Come, then,” said one. “If you will not harm us, you may come. Take Tsa’s\r\nhole, which lies above you.”\r\n\r\nThe creature showed us the mouth of a black cave, but he kept at a distance\r\nwhile he did it, and Lys followed me as I crawled in to explore. I had matches\r\nwith me, and in the light of one I found a small cavern with a flat roof and\r\nfloor which followed the cleavage of the strata. Pieces of the roof had fallen\r\nat some long-distant date, as was evidenced by the depth of the filth and\r\nrubble in which they were embedded. Even a superficial examination revealed the\r\nfact that nothing had ever been attempted that might have improved the\r\nlivability of the cavern; nor, should I judge, had it ever been cleaned out.\r\nWith considerable difficulty I loosened some of the larger pieces of broken\r\nrock which littered the floor and placed them as a barrier before the doorway.\r\nIt was too dark to do more than this. I then gave Lys a piece of dried meat,\r\nand sitting inside the entrance, we dined as must have some of our ancient\r\nforbears at the dawning of the age of man, while far below the open diapason of\r\nthe savage night rose weird and horrifying to our ears. In the light of the\r\ngreat fire still burning we could see huge, skulking forms, and in the blacker\r\nbackground countless flaming eyes.\r\n\r\nLys shuddered, and I put my arm around her and drew her to me; and thus we sat\r\nthroughout the hot night. She told me of her abduction and of the fright she\r\nhad undergone, and together we thanked God that she had come through unharmed,\r\nbecause the great brute had dared not pause along the danger-infested way. She\r\nsaid that they had but just reached the cliffs when I arrived, for on several\r\noccasions her captor had been forced to take to the trees with her to escape\r\nthe clutches of some hungry cave-lion or saber-toothed tiger, and that twice\r\nthey had been obliged to remain for considerable periods before the beasts had\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nNobs, by dint of much scrambling and one or two narrow escapes from death, had\r\nmanaged to follow us up the cliff and was now curled between me and the\r\ndoorway, having devoured a piece of the dried meat, which he seemed to relish\r\nimmensely. He was the first to fall asleep; but I imagine we must have followed\r\nsuit soon, for we were both tired. I had laid aside my ammunition-belt and\r\nrifle, though both were close beside me; but my pistol I kept in my lap beneath\r\nmy hand. However, we were not disturbed during the night, and when I awoke, the\r\nsun was shining on the tree-tops in the distance. Lys’ head had drooped to my\r\nbreast, and my arm was still about her.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward Lys awoke, and for a moment she could not seem to comprehend\r\nher situation. She looked at me and then turned and glanced at my arm about\r\nher, and then she seemed quite suddenly to realize the scantiness of her\r\napparel and drew away, covering her face with her palms and blushing furiously.\r\nI drew her back toward me and kissed her, and then she threw her arms about my\r\nneck and wept softly in mute surrender to the inevitable.\r\n\r\nIt was an hour later before the tribe began to stir about. We watched them from\r\nour “apartment,” as Lys called it. Neither men nor women wore any sort of\r\nclothing or ornaments, and they all seemed to be about of an age; nor were\r\nthere any babies or children among them. This was, to us, the strangest and\r\nmost inexplicable of facts, but it recalled to us that though we had seen many\r\nof the lesser developed wild people of Caspak, we had never yet seen a child or\r\nan old man or woman.\r\n\r\nAfter a while they became less suspicious of us and then quite friendly in\r\ntheir brutish way. They picked at the fabric of our clothing, which seemed to\r\ninterest them, and examined my rifle and pistol and the ammunition in the belt\r\naround my waist. I showed them the thermos-bottle, and when I poured a little\r\nwater from it, they were delighted, thinking that it was a spring which I\r\ncarried about with me—a never-failing source of water supply.\r\n\r\nOne thing we both noticed among their other characteristics: they never laughed\r\nnor smiled; and then we remembered that Ahm had never done so, either. I asked\r\nthem if they knew Ahm; but they said they did not.\r\n\r\nOne of them said: “Back there we may have known him.” And he jerked his head to\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\n“You came from back there?” I asked. He looked at me in surprise.\r\n\r\n“We all come from there,” he said. “After a while we go there.” And this time\r\nhe jerked his head toward the north. “Be Galus,” he concluded.\r\n\r\nMany times now had we heard this reference to becoming Galus. Ahm had spoken of\r\nit many times. Lys and I decided that it was a sort of original religious\r\nconviction, as much a part of them as their instinct for self-preservation—a\r\nprimal acceptance of a hereafter and a holier state. It was a brilliant theory,\r\nbut it was all wrong. I know it now, and how far we were from guessing the\r\nwonderful, the miraculous, the gigantic truth which even yet I may only guess\r\nat—the thing that sets Caspak apart from all the rest of the world far more\r\ndefinitely than her isolated geographical position or her impregnable barrier\r\nof giant cliffs. If I could live to return to civilization, I should have meat\r\nfor the clergy and the layman to chew upon for years—and for the evolutionists,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the men set out to hunt, while the women went to a large pool\r\nof warm water covered with a green scum and filled with billions of tadpoles.\r\nThey waded in to where the water was about a foot deep and lay down in the mud.\r\nThey remained there from one to two hours and then returned to the cliff. While\r\nwe were with them, we saw this same thing repeated every morning; but though we\r\nasked them why they did it we could get no reply which was intelligible to us.\r\nAll they vouchsafed in way of explanation was the single word Ata. They tried\r\nto get Lys to go in with them and could not understand why she refused. After\r\nthe first day I went hunting with the men, leaving my pistol and Nobs with Lys,\r\nbut she never had to use them, for no reptile or beast ever approached the pool\r\nwhile the women were there—nor, so far as we know, at other times. There was no\r\nspoor of wild beast in the soft mud along the banks, and the water certainly\r\ndidn’t look fit to drink.\r\n\r\nThis tribe lived largely upon the smaller animals which they bowled over with\r\ntheir stone hatchets after making a wide circle about their quarry and driving\r\nit so that it had to pass close to one of their number. The little horses and\r\nthe smaller antelope they secured in sufficient numbers to support life, and\r\nthey also ate numerous varieties of fruits and vegetables. They never brought\r\nin more than sufficient food for their immediate needs; but why bother? The\r\nfood problem of Caspak is not one to cause worry to her inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day Lys told me that she thought she felt equal to attempting the\r\nreturn journey on the morrow, and so I set out for the hunt in high spirits,\r\nfor I was anxious to return to the fort and learn if Bradley and his party had\r\nreturned and what had been the result of his expedition. I also wanted to\r\nrelieve their minds as to Lys and myself, as I knew that they must have already\r\ngiven us up for dead. It was a cloudy day, though warm, as it always is in\r\nCaspak. It seemed odd to realize that just a few miles away winter lay upon the\r\nstorm-tossed ocean, and that snow might be falling all about Caprona; but no\r\nsnow could ever penetrate the damp, hot atmosphere of the great crater.\r\n\r\nWe had to go quite a bit farther than usual before we could surround a little\r\nbunch of antelope, and as I was helping drive them, I saw a fine red deer a\r\ncouple of hundred yards behind me. He must have been asleep in the long grass,\r\nfor I saw him rise and look about him in a bewildered way, and then I raised my\r\ngun and let him have it. He dropped, and I ran forward to finish him with the\r\nlong thin knife, which one of the men had given me; but just as I reached him,\r\nhe staggered to his feet and ran on for another two hundred yards—when I\r\ndropped him again. Once more was this repeated before I was able to reach him\r\nand cut his throat; then I looked around for my companions, as I wanted them to\r\ncome and carry the meat home; but I could see nothing of them. I called a few\r\ntimes and waited, but there was no response and no one came. At last I became\r\ndisgusted, and cutting off all the meat that I could conveniently carry, I set\r\noff in the direction of the cliffs. I must have gone about a mile before the\r\ntruth dawned upon me—I was lost, hopelessly lost.\r\n\r\nThe entire sky was still completely blotted out by dense clouds; nor was there\r\nany landmark visible by which I might have taken my bearings. I went on in the\r\ndirection I thought was south but which I now imagine must have been about due\r\nnorth, without detecting a single familiar object. In a dense wood I suddenly\r\nstumbled upon a thing which at first filled me with hope and later with the\r\nmost utter despair and dejection. It was a little mound of new-turned earth\r\nsprinkled with flowers long since withered, and at one end was a flat slab of\r\nsandstone stuck in the ground. It was a grave, and it meant for me that I had\r\nat last stumbled into a country inhabited by human beings. I would find them;\r\nthey would direct me to the cliffs; perhaps they would accompany me and take us\r\nback with them to their abodes—to the abodes of men and women like ourselves.\r\nMy hopes and my imagination ran riot in the few yards I had to cover to reach\r\nthat lonely grave and stoop that I might read the rude characters scratched\r\nupon the simple headstone. This is what I read:\r\n\r\nHERE LIES JOHN TIPPET\r\n\r\nENGLISHMAN\r\n\r\nKILLED BY TYRANNOSAURUS\r\n\r\n10 SEPT., A.D. 1916\r\n\r\nR. I. P.\r\n\r\n\r\nTippet! It seemed incredible. Tippet lying here in this gloomy wood! Tippet\r\ndead! He had been a good man, but the personal loss was not what affected me.\r\nIt was the fact that this silent grave gave evidence that Bradley had come this\r\nfar upon his expedition and that he too probably was lost, for it was not our\r\nintention that he should be long gone. If I had stumbled upon the grave of one\r\nof the party, was it not within reason to believe that the bones of the others\r\nlay scattered somewhere near?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I stood looking down upon that sad and lonely mound, wrapped in the most\r\ndismal of reflections and premonitions, I was suddenly seized from behind and\r\nthrown to earth. As I fell, a warm body fell on top of me, and hands grasped my\r\narms and legs. When I could look up, I saw a number of giant figures pinioning\r\nme down, while others stood about surveying me. Here again was a new type of\r\nman—a higher type than the primitive tribe I had just quitted. They were a\r\ntaller people, too, with better-shaped skulls and more intelligent faces. There\r\nwere less of the ape characteristics about their features, and less of the\r\nnegroid, too. They carried weapons, stone-shod spears, stone knives, and\r\nhatchets—and they wore ornaments and breech-cloths—the former of feathers worn\r\nin their hair and the latter made of a single snake-skin cured with the head\r\non, the head depending to their knees.\r\n\r\nOf course I did not take in all these details upon the instant of my capture,\r\nfor I was busy with other matters. Three of the warriors were sitting upon me,\r\ntrying to hold me down by main strength and awkwardness, and they were having\r\ntheir hands full in the doing, I can tell you. I don’t like to appear\r\nconceited, but I may as well admit that I am proud of my strength and the\r\nscience that I have acquired and developed in the directing of it—that and my\r\nhorsemanship I always have been proud of. And now, that day, all the long hours\r\nthat I had put into careful study, practice and training brought me in two or\r\nthree minutes a full return upon my investment. Californians, as a rule, are\r\nfamiliar with ju-jutsu, and I especially had made a study of it for several\r\nyears, both at school and in the gym of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, while\r\nrecently I had had, in my employ, a Jap who was a wonder at the art.\r\n\r\nIt took me just about thirty seconds to break the elbow of one of my\r\nassailants, trip another and send him stumbling backward among his fellows, and\r\nthrow the third completely over my head in such a way that when he fell his\r\nneck was broken. In the instant that the others of the party stood in mute and\r\ninactive surprise, I unslung my rifle—which, carelessly, I had been carrying\r\nacross my back; and when they charged, as I felt they would, I put a bullet in\r\nthe forehead of one of them. This stopped them all temporarily—not the death of\r\ntheir fellow, but the report of the rifle, the first they had ever heard.\r\nBefore they were ready to attack me again, one of them spoke in a commanding\r\ntone to his fellows, and in a language similar but still more comprehensive\r\nthan that of the tribe to the south, as theirs was more complete than Ahm’s. He\r\ncommanded them to stand back and then he advanced and addressed me.\r\n\r\nHe asked me who I was, from whence I came and what my intentions were. I\r\nreplied that I was a stranger in Caspak, that I was lost and that my only\r\ndesire was to find my way back to my companions. He asked where they were and I\r\ntold him toward the south somewhere, using the Caspakian phrase which,\r\nliterally translated, means “toward the beginning.” His surprise showed upon\r\nhis face before he voiced it in words. “There are no Galus there,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I tell you,” I said angrily, “that I am from another country, far from Caspak,\r\nfar beyond the high cliffs. I do not know who the Galus may be; I have never\r\nseen them. This is the farthest north I have been. Look at me—look at my\r\nclothing and my weapons. Have you ever seen a Galu or any other creature in\r\nCaspak who possessed such things?”\r\n\r\nHe had to admit that he had not, and also that he was much interested in me, my\r\nrifle and the way I had handled his three warriors. Finally he became half\r\nconvinced that I was telling him the truth and offered to aid me if I would\r\nshow him how I had thrown the man over my head and also make him a present of\r\nthe “bang-spear,” as he called it. I refused to give him my rifle, but promised\r\nto show him the trick he wished to learn if he would guide me in the right\r\ndirection. He told me that he would do so tomorrow, that it was too late today\r\nand that I might come to their village and spend the night with them. I was\r\nloath to lose so much time; but the fellow was obdurate, and so I accompanied\r\nthem. The two dead men they left where they had fallen, nor gave them a second\r\nglance—thus cheap is life upon Caspak.\r\n\r\nThese people also were cave-dwellers, but their caves showed the result of a\r\nhigher intelligence that brought them a step nearer to civilized man than the\r\ntribe next “toward the beginning.” The interiors of their caverns were cleared\r\nof rubbish, though still far from clean, and they had pallets of dried grasses\r\ncovered with the skins of leopard, lynx, and bear, while before the entrances\r\nwere barriers of stone and small, rudely circular stone ovens. The walls of the\r\ncavern to which I was conducted were covered with drawings scratched upon the\r\nsandstone. There were the outlines of the giant red-deer, of mammoths, of\r\ntigers and other beasts. Here, as in the last tribe, there were no children or\r\nany old people. The men of this tribe had two names, or rather names of two\r\nsyllables, and their language contained words of two syllables; whereas in the\r\ntribe of Tsa the words were all of a single syllable, with the exception of a\r\nvery few like Atis and Galus. The chief’s name was To-jo, and his household\r\nconsisted of seven females and himself. These women were much more comely, or\r\nrather less hideous than those of Tsa’s people; one of them, even, was almost\r\npretty, being less hairy and having a rather nice skin, with high coloring.\r\n\r\nThey were all much interested in me and examined my clothing and equipment\r\ncarefully, handling and feeling and smelling of each article. I learned from\r\nthem that their people were known as Band-lu, or spear-men; Tsa’s race was\r\ncalled Sto-lu—hatchet-men. Below these in the scale of evolution came the\r\nBo-lu, or club-men, and then the Alus, who had no weapons and no language. In\r\nthat word I recognized what to me seemed the most remarkable discovery I had\r\nmade upon Caprona, for unless it were mere coincidence, I had come upon a word\r\nthat had been handed down from the beginning of spoken language upon earth,\r\nbeen handed down for millions of years, perhaps, with little change. It was the\r\nsole remaining thread of the ancient woof of a dawning culture which had been\r\nwoven when Caprona was a fiery mount upon a great land-mass teeming with life.\r\nIt linked the unfathomable then to the eternal now. And yet it may have been\r\npure coincidence; my better judgment tells me that it is coincidence that in\r\nCaspak the term for speechless man is Alus, and in the outer world of our own\r\nday it is Alalus.\r\n\r\nThe comely woman of whom I spoke was called So-ta, and she took such a lively\r\ninterest in me that To-jo finally objected to her attentions, emphasizing his\r\ndispleasure by knocking her down and kicking her into a corner of the cavern. I\r\nleaped between them while he was still kicking her, and obtaining a quick hold\r\nupon him, dragged him screaming with pain from the cave. Then I made him\r\npromise not to hurt the she again, upon pain of worse punishment. So-ta gave me\r\na grateful look; but To-jo and the balance of his women were sullen and\r\nominous.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening So-ta confided to me that she was soon to leave the tribe.\r\n\r\n“So-ta soon to be Kro-lu,” she confided in a low whisper. I asked her what a\r\nKro-lu might be, and she tried to explain, but I do not yet know if I\r\nunderstood her. From her gestures I deduced that the Kro-lus were a people who\r\nwere armed with bows and arrows, had vessels in which to cook their food and\r\nhuts of some sort in which they lived, and were accompanied by animals. It was\r\nall very fragmentary and vague, but the idea seemed to be that the Kro-lus were\r\na more advanced people than the Band-lus. I pondered a long time upon all that\r\nI had heard, before sleep came to me. I tried to find some connection between\r\nthese various races that would explain the universal hope which each of them\r\nharbored that some day they would become Galus. So-ta had given me a\r\nsuggestion; but the resulting idea was so weird that I could scarce even\r\nentertain it; yet it coincided with Ahm’s expressed hope, with the various\r\nsteps in evolution I had noted in the several tribes I had encountered and with\r\nthe range of type represented in each tribe. For example, among the Band-lu\r\nwere such types as So-ta, who seemed to me to be the highest in the scale of\r\nevolution, and To-jo, who was just a shade nearer the ape, while there were\r\nothers who had flatter noses, more prognathous faces and hairier bodies. The\r\nquestion puzzled me. Possibly in the outer world the answer to it is locked in\r\nthe bosom of the Sphinx. Who knows? I do not.\r\n\r\nThinking the thoughts of a lunatic or a dope-fiend, I fell asleep; and when I\r\nawoke, my hands and feet were securely tied and my weapons had been taken from\r\nme. How they did it without awakening me I cannot tell you. It was humiliating,\r\nbut it was true. To-jo stood above me. The early light of morning was dimly\r\nfiltering into the cave.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” he demanded, “how to throw a man over my head and break his neck,\r\nfor I am going to kill you, and I wish to know this thing before you die.”\r\n\r\nOf all the ingenuous declarations I have ever heard, this one copped the\r\nproverbial bun. It struck me as so funny that, even in the face of death, I\r\nlaughed. Death, I may remark here, had, however, lost much of his terror for\r\nme. I had become a disciple of Lys’ fleeting philosophy of the valuelessness of\r\nhuman life. I realized that she was quite right—that we were but comic figures\r\nhopping from the cradle to the grave, of interest to practically no other\r\ncreated thing than ourselves and our few intimates.\r\n\r\nBehind To-jo stood So-ta. She raised one hand with the palm toward me—the\r\nCaspakian equivalent of a negative shake of the head.\r\n\r\n“Let me think about it,” I parried, and To-jo said that he would wait until\r\nnight. He would give me a day to think it over; then he left, and the women\r\nleft—the men for the hunt, and the women, as I later learned from So-ta, for\r\nthe warm pool where they immersed their bodies as did the shes of the Sto-lu.\r\n“Ata,” explained So-ta, when I questioned her as to the purpose of this\r\nmatutinal rite; but that was later.\r\n\r\nI must have lain there bound and uncomfortable for two or three hours when at\r\nlast So-ta entered the cave. She carried a sharp knife—mine, in fact, and with\r\nit she cut my bonds.\r\n\r\n“Come!” she said. “So-ta will go with you back to the Galus. It is time that\r\nSo-ta left the Band-lu. Together we will go to the Kro-lu, and after that the\r\nGalus. To-jo will kill you tonight. He will kill So-ta if he knows that So-ta\r\naided you. We will go together.”\r\n\r\n“I will go with you to the Kro-lu,” I replied, “but then I must return to my\r\nown people ‘toward the beginning.’”\r\n\r\n“You cannot go back,” she said. “It is forbidden. They would kill you. Thus far\r\nhave you come—there is no returning.”\r\n\r\n“But I must return,” I insisted. “My people are there. I must return and lead\r\nthem in this direction.”\r\n\r\nShe insisted, and I insisted; but at last we compromised. I was to escort her\r\nas far as the country of the Kro-lu and then I was to go back after my own\r\npeople and lead them north into a land where the dangers were fewer and the\r\npeople less murderous. She brought me all my belongings that had been filched\r\nfrom me—rifle, ammunition, knife, and thermos bottle, and then hand in hand we\r\ndescended the cliff and set off toward the north.\r\n\r\nFor three days we continued upon our way, until we arrived outside a village of\r\nthatched huts just at dusk. So-ta said that she would enter alone; I must not\r\nbe seen if I did not intend to remain, as it was forbidden that one should\r\nreturn and live after having advanced this far. So she left me. She was a dear\r\ngirl and a stanch and true comrade—more like a man than a woman. In her simple\r\nbarbaric way she was both refined and chaste. She had been the wife of To-jo.\r\nAmong the Kro-lu she would find another mate after the manner of the strange\r\nCaspakian world; but she told me very frankly that whenever I returned, she\r\nwould leave her mate and come to me, as she preferred me above all others. I\r\nwas becoming a ladies’ man after a lifetime of bashfulness!\r\n\r\nAt the outskirts of the village I left her without even seeing the sort of\r\npeople who inhabited it, and set off through the growing darkness toward the\r\nsouth. On the third day I made a detour westward to avoid the country of the\r\nBand-lu, as I did not care to be detained by a meeting with To-jo. On the sixth\r\nday I came to the cliffs of the Sto-lu, and my heart beat fast as I approached\r\nthem, for here was Lys. Soon I would hold her tight in my arms again; soon her\r\nwarm lips would merge with mine. I felt sure that she was still safe among the\r\nhatchet people, and I was already picturing the joy and the love-light in her\r\neyes when she should see me once more as I emerged from the last clump of trees\r\nand almost ran toward the cliffs.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the morning. The women must have returned from the pool; yet as\r\nI drew near, I saw no sign of life whatever. “They have remained longer,” I\r\nthought; but when I was quite close to the base of the cliffs, I saw that which\r\ndashed my hopes and my happiness to earth. Strewn along the ground were a score\r\nof mute and horrible suggestions of what had taken place during my\r\nabsence—bones picked clean of flesh, the bones of manlike creatures, the bones\r\nof many of the tribe of Sto-lu; nor in any cave was there sign of life.\r\n\r\nClosely I examined the ghastly remains fearful each instant that I should find\r\nthe dainty skull that would shatter my happiness for life; but though I\r\nsearched diligently, picking up every one of the twenty-odd skulls, I found\r\nnone that was the skull of a creature but slightly removed from the ape. Hope,\r\nthen, still lived. For another three days I searched north and south, east and\r\nwest for the hatchetmen of Caspak; but never a trace of them did I find. It was\r\nraining most of the time now, and the weather was as near cold as it ever seems\r\nto get on Caprona.\r\n\r\nAt last I gave up the search and set off toward Fort Dinosaur. For a week—a\r\nweek filled with the terrors and dangers of a primeval world—I pushed on in the\r\ndirection I thought was south. The sun never shone; the rain scarcely ever\r\nceased falling. The beasts I met with were fewer in number but infinitely more\r\nterrible in temper; yet I lived on until there came to me the realization that\r\nI was hopelessly lost, that a year of sunshine would not again give me my\r\nbearings; and while I was cast down by this terrifying knowledge, the knowledge\r\nthat I never again could find Lys, I stumbled upon another grave—the grave of\r\nWilliam James, with its little crude headstone and its scrawled characters\r\nrecording that he had died upon the 13th of September—killed by a saber-tooth\r\ntiger.\r\n\r\nI think that I almost gave up then. Never in my life have I felt more hopeless\r\nor helpless or alone. I was lost. I could not find my friends. I did not even\r\nknow that they still lived; in fact, I could not bring myself to believe that\r\nthey did. I was sure that Lys was dead. I wanted myself to die, and yet I clung\r\nto life—useless and hopeless and harrowing a thing as it had become. I clung to\r\nlife because some ancient, reptilian forbear had clung to life and transmitted\r\nto me through the ages the most powerful motive that guided his minute\r\nbrain—the motive of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nAt last I came to the great barrier-cliffs; and after three days of mad\r\neffort—of maniacal effort—I scaled them. I built crude ladders; I wedged sticks\r\nin narrow fissures; I chopped toe-holds and finger-holds with my long knife;\r\nbut at last I scaled them. Near the summit I came upon a huge cavern. It is the\r\nabode of some mighty winged creature of the Triassic—or rather it was. Now it\r\nis mine. I slew the thing and took its abode. I reached the summit and looked\r\nout upon the broad gray terrible Pacific of the far-southern winter. It was\r\ncold up there. It is cold here today; yet here I sit watching, watching,\r\nwatching for the thing I know will never come—for a sail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce a day I descend to the base of the cliff and hunt, and fill my stomach\r\nwith water from a clear cold spring. I have three gourds which I fill with\r\nwater and take back to my cave against the long nights. I have fashioned a\r\nspear and a bow and arrow, that I may conserve my ammunition, which is running\r\nlow. My clothes are worn to shreds. Tomorrow I shall discard them for\r\nleopard-skins which I have tanned and sewn into a garment strong and warm. It\r\nis cold up here. I have a fire burning and I sit bent over it while I write;\r\nbut I am safe here. No other living creature ventures to the chill summit of\r\nthe barrier cliffs. I am safe, and I am alone with my sorrows and my remembered\r\njoys—but without hope. It is said that hope springs eternal in the human\r\nbreast; but there is none in mine.\r\n\r\nI am about done. Presently I shall fold these pages and push them into my\r\nthermos bottle. I shall cork it and screw the cap tight, and then I shall hurl\r\nit as far out into the sea as my strength will permit. The wind is off-shore;\r\nthe tide is running out; perhaps it will be carried into one of those numerous\r\nocean-currents which sweep perpetually from pole to pole and from continent to\r\ncontinent, to be deposited at last upon some inhabited shore. If fate is kind\r\nand this does happen, then, _for God’s sake, come and get me!_\r\n\r\nIt was a week ago that I wrote the preceding paragraph, which I thought would\r\nend the written record of my life upon Caprona. I had paused to put a new point\r\non my quill and stir the crude ink (which I made by crushing a black variety of\r\nberry and mixing it with water) before attaching my signature, when faintly\r\nfrom the valley far below came an unmistakable sound which brought me to my\r\nfeet, trembling with excitement, to peer eagerly downward from my dizzy ledge.\r\nHow full of meaning that sound was to me you may guess when I tell you that it\r\nwas the report of a firearm! For a moment my gaze traversed the landscape\r\nbeneath until it was caught and held by four figures near the base of the\r\ncliff—a human figure held at bay by three hyaenodons, those ferocious and\r\nblood-thirsty wild dogs of the Eocene. A fourth beast lay dead or dying near\r\nby.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t be sure, looking down from above as I was; but yet I trembled like a\r\nleaf in the intuitive belief that it was Lys, and my judgment served to confirm\r\nmy wild desire, for whoever it was carried only a pistol, and thus had Lys been\r\narmed. The first wave of sudden joy which surged through me was short-lived in\r\nthe face of the swift-following conviction that the one who fought below was\r\nalready doomed. Luck and only luck it must have been which had permitted that\r\nfirst shot to lay low one of the savage creatures, for even such a heavy weapon\r\nas my pistol is entirely inadequate against even the lesser carnivora of\r\nCaspak. In a moment the three would charge! A futile shot would but tend more\r\ngreatly to enrage the one it chanced to hit; and then the three would drag down\r\nthe little human figure and tear it to pieces.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe it was Lys! My heart stood still at the thought, but mind and muscle\r\nresponded to the quick decision I was forced to make. There was but a single\r\nhope—a single chance—and I took it. I raised my rifle to my shoulder and took\r\ncareful aim. It was a long shot, a dangerous shot, for unless one is accustomed\r\nto it, shooting from a considerable altitude is most deceptive work. There is,\r\nthough, something about marksmanship which is quite beyond all scientific laws.\r\n\r\nUpon no other theory can I explain my marksmanship of that moment. Three times\r\nmy rifle spoke—three quick, short syllables of death. I did not take conscious\r\naim; and yet at each report a beast crumpled in its tracks!\r\n\r\nFrom my ledge to the base of the cliff is a matter of several thousand feet of\r\ndangerous climbing; yet I venture to say that the first ape from whose loins my\r\nline has descended never could have equaled the speed with which I literally\r\ndropped down the face of that rugged escarpment. The last two hundred feet is\r\nover a steep incline of loose rubble to the valley bottom, and I had just\r\nreached the top of this when there arose to my ears an agonized cry—“Bowen!\r\nBowen! Quick, my love, quick!”\r\n\r\nI had been too much occupied with the dangers of the descent to glance down\r\ntoward the valley; but that cry which told me that it was indeed Lys, and that\r\nshe was again in danger, brought my eyes quickly upon her in time to see a\r\nhairy, burly brute seize her and start off at a run toward the near-by wood.\r\nFrom rock to rock, chamoislike, I leaped downward toward the valley, in pursuit\r\nof Lys and her hideous abductor.\r\n\r\nHe was heavier than I by many pounds, and so weighted by the burden he carried\r\nthat I easily overtook him; and at last he turned, snarling, to face me. It was\r\nKho of the tribe of Tsa, the hatchet-men. He recognized me, and with a low\r\ngrowl he threw Lys aside and came for me. “The she is mine,” he cried. “I kill!\r\nI kill!”\r\n\r\nI had had to discard my rifle before I commenced the rapid descent of the\r\ncliff, so that now I was armed only with a hunting knife, and this I whipped\r\nfrom its scabbard as Kho leaped toward me. He was a mighty beast, mightily\r\nmuscled, and the urge that has made males fight since the dawn of life on earth\r\nfilled him with the blood-lust and the thirst to slay; but not one whit less\r\ndid it fill me with the same primal passions. Two abysmal beasts sprang at each\r\nother’s throats that day beneath the shadow of earth’s oldest cliffs—the man of\r\nnow and the man-thing of the earliest, forgotten then, imbued by the same\r\ndeathless passion that has come down unchanged through all the epochs, periods\r\nand eras of time from the beginning, and which shall continue to the\r\nincalculable end—woman, the imperishable Alpha and Omega of life.\r\n\r\nKho closed and sought my jugular with his teeth. He seemed to forget the\r\nhatchet dangling by its aurochs-hide thong at his hip, as I forgot, for the\r\nmoment, the dagger in my hand. And I doubt not but that Kho would easily have\r\nbested me in an encounter of that sort had not Lys’ voice awakened within my\r\nmomentarily reverted brain the skill and cunning of reasoning man.\r\n\r\n“Bowen!” she cried. “Your knife! Your knife!”\r\n\r\nIt was enough. It recalled me from the forgotten eon to which my brain had\r\nflown and left me once again a modern man battling with a clumsy, unskilled\r\nbrute. No longer did my jaws snap at the hairy throat before me; but instead my\r\nknife sought and found a space between two ribs over the savage heart. Kho\r\nvoiced a single horrid scream, stiffened spasmodically and sank to the earth.\r\nAnd Lys threw herself into my arms. All the fears and sorrows of the past were\r\nwiped away, and once again I was the happiest of men.\r\n\r\nWith some misgivings I shortly afterward cast my eyes upward toward the\r\nprecarious ledge which ran before my cave, for it seemed to me quite beyond all\r\nreason to expect a dainty modern belle to essay the perils of that frightful\r\nclimb. I asked her if she thought she could brave the ascent, and she laughed\r\ngayly in my face.\r\n\r\n“Watch!” she cried, and ran eagerly toward the base of the cliff. Like a\r\nsquirrel she clambered swiftly aloft, so that I was forced to exert myself to\r\nkeep pace with her. At first she frightened me; but presently I was aware that\r\nshe was quite as safe here as was I. When we finally came to my ledge and I\r\nagain held her in my arms, she recalled to my mind that for several weeks she\r\nhad been living the life of a cave-girl with the tribe of hatchet-men. They had\r\nbeen driven from their former caves by another tribe which had slain many and\r\ncarried off quite half the females, and the new cliffs to which they had flown\r\nhad proven far higher and more precipitous, so that she had become, through\r\nnecessity, a most practiced climber.\r\n\r\nShe told me of Kho’s desire for her, since all his females had been stolen and\r\nof how her life had been a constant nightmare of terror as she sought by night\r\nand by day to elude the great brute. For a time Nobs had been all the\r\nprotection she required; but one day he disappeared—nor has she seen him since.\r\nShe believes that he was deliberately made away with; and so do I, for we both\r\nare sure that he never would have deserted her. With her means of protection\r\ngone, Lys was now at the mercy of the hatchet-man; nor was it many hours before\r\nhe had caught her at the base of the cliff and seized her; but as he bore her\r\ntriumphantly aloft toward his cave, she had managed to break loose and escape\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“For three days he has pursued me,” she said, “through this horrible world. How\r\nI have passed through in safety I cannot guess, nor how I have always managed\r\nto outdistance him; yet I have done it, until just as you discovered me. Fate\r\nwas kind to us, Bowen.”\r\n\r\nI nodded my head in assent and crushed her to me. And then we talked and\r\nplanned as I cooked antelope-steaks over my fire, and we came to the conclusion\r\nthat there was no hope of rescue, that she and I were doomed to live and die\r\nupon Caprona. Well, it might be worse! I would rather live here always with Lys\r\nthan to live elsewhere without her; and she, dear girl, says the same of me;\r\nbut I am afraid of this life for her. It is a hard, fierce, dangerous life, and\r\nI shall pray always that we shall be rescued from it—for her sake.\r\n\r\nThat night the clouds broke, and the moon shone down upon our little ledge; and\r\nthere, hand in hand, we turned our faces toward heaven and plighted our troth\r\nbeneath the eyes of God. No human agency could have married us more sacredly\r\nthan we are wed. We are man and wife, and we are content. If God wills it, we\r\nshall live out our lives here. If He wills otherwise, then this manuscript\r\nwhich I shall now consign to the inscrutable forces of the sea shall fall into\r\nfriendly hands. However, we are each without hope. And so we say good-bye in\r\nthis, our last message to the world beyond the barrier cliffs.\r\n\r\n(_Signed_) BOWEN J. TYLER, JR.\r\n           LYS LA R. TYLER.",
