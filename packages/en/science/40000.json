These drawings roused special interest among those\r\nwho listened to my lecture, and I was asked by many if I could not see my\r\nway to publish the lecture and drawings, in book form, as these plates were\r\nfar too numerous for the proceedings of the Congress. After some hesitation\r\nI determined to do this, greatly owing to the persuasion of the late Dr.\r\nPaul Leverkühn. The preparation of a book required considerably more\r\nresearch than the lecture, and therefore my readers will find, in the\r\nfollowing pages, a totally different account to that in the lecture, as\r\nwell as corrections and numerous additions. The lecture itself has been\r\npublished in the \"Proceedings of the IVth International Ornithological\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nI wish to thank very heartily all those of my ornithological friends, who\r\nhave kindly helped me with the loan of specimens or otherwise, and\r\nespecially Dr. H. O. Forbes, Dr. Scharff, Professor Dr. K. Lampert, Dr. O.\r\nFinsch, Professor Dr. A. Koenig, Dr. Kerbert, Mr. Fleming, Dr. von Lorenz,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n  WALTER ROTHSCHILD.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{vii}\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe study of the forms of life no longer existing on the earth, from the\r\nscanty remains preserved to us, has provoked a very great interest almost\r\nfrom the commencement of historical times. The very small portion of this\r\nvast field I am treating of in the following pages has a special\r\nattraction, as it deals to a great extent with forms familiar in a living\r\nstate to our immediate forefathers and even to some of ourselves. Although\r\nI have here arranged the species systematically, they fall into two\r\ndistinct categories, namely those known externally as well as internally,\r\nand those of which we know bones and egg-shells only. Under the former\r\ncategory might be included those merely known from descriptions or figures\r\nin ancient books, as well as those of which specimens exist. In the present\r\nwork several plates have been reconstructed from such descriptions in order\r\nto give some idea of their probable appearance. There is considerable\r\ndifference of opinion as to the approximate date of the disappearance of\r\nmany of the species known from bones dug from deposits which have been\r\nvariously determined as pleistocene and post-pleistocene. It seems to me\r\nthat this problem can never be entirely solved, but the significant fact\r\nremains, that while many bones of these species in one locality have been\r\ncollected in the kitchen-middens of the former inhabitants, in other\r\nlocalities the same bones occur in what seem to be much older formations.\r\n\r\nIn view of this and kindred facts, I have mentioned many species which some\r\nornithologists will probably consider outside the range of the present\r\ntreatise, viz., birds which have become extinct in the last seven- or\r\neight-hundred years. Taking my first category, viz., those species whose\r\nexterior is more or less known, our knowledge is very variable in scope;\r\nabout some we have a very full and even redundant literature, such as the\r\nGreat Auk, the Labrador Duck, and Notornis, while of others, such as most\r\nof the extinct Parrots from the West Indies, the \"Giant\" of Mauritius, the\r\n\"Blue Bird\" of Bourbon, and so forth, we have the very scantiest knowledge.\r\nEven in the times of Leguat and Labat there must have been many species,\r\nnow extinct, of which no mention has ever been made, for {viii} these old\r\nwriters only mentioned such species which impressed themselves on their\r\nmemories either from their size, peculiar shape, beauty of plumage, or\r\nexcellence and usefulness for food--in fact the culinary property of the\r\nvarious birds seems to have been their principal interest. One of the most\r\ninteresting phenomena connected with recently extinct birds is the\r\nresemblance of the fauna of the Mascarene Islands and that of the Chatham\r\nIslands in the possession of a number of large flightless Rails, though the\r\nsignificance of this fact has been much exaggerated.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this book is confined to species actually known to be\r\nextinct, but a few are included of which a small number is still known to\r\nexist, because firstly there seems no doubt that they will vanish soon, and\r\nsecondly, as in the case of _Notornis_, it was necessary to clear up\r\ncertain misconceptions and contradictory statements. In the case of a few\r\nspecies believed to be quite extinct, it is possible that some individuals\r\nmay still exist in little known parts of their range, while on the other\r\nhand it is more than likely that several of the species referred to in my\r\nlecture (Proc. Orn. Congress pp. 191-207, 1907) as threatened with\r\ndestruction, have already ceased to live. This may also be the case with\r\nsome birds not alluded to at all.\r\n\r\nIn several instances I have treated of extinct flightless species under\r\ngenera including existing species capable of flight. This may appear to be\r\ninconsistent, seeing that I maintain _Notornis_ separate from _Porphyrio_,\r\nbut, while not considering flightlessness in itself a generic character,\r\nthe great development of the wing-coverts and the modification of the toes\r\nappear of sufficient generic value in this case. I know that several of the\r\nmost eminent ornithologists of the day, among them Dr. Sharpe, differ from\r\nme, and are convinced that the loss of the power of flight is so profound a\r\nmodification, that it is imperative that we should treat it as sufficient\r\nfor generic distinction.\r\n\r\nWhile agreeing that many genera are founded on much less striking\r\nmodifications, I cannot concur in this opinion, for, unless the loss of the\r\npower of flight is also accompanied by other changes, in some cases it is\r\ndifficult to find at first sight even specific differences other than the\r\naborted wings.\r\n\r\nThe cause of recent extinction among birds is in most cases due directly or\r\nindirectly to man, but we also have instances of birds becoming extinct for\r\nno apparent reason whatever.\r\n\r\nMan has destroyed, and is continually destroying species directly, either\r\nfor {ix} food or for sport, but also in many other ways he contributes to\r\ntheir destruction. Some species have been exterminated by the introduction\r\nof animals of prey, such as rats, cats, mongoose, etc., and we know that\r\nalso the acclimatisation of other birds, such as the mynah, etc., has\r\nproved to be harmful to the native birds. Again we find that the\r\nintroduction of domestic creatures or others kept as pets has brought\r\ndiseases which may prove fatal to the indigenous fauna. Another means by\r\nwhich man causes immense destruction, is by destroying the natural habitat\r\nof various species. By cutting down or burning the forests, prairies, or\r\nscrub, and by bringing the land under cultivation, man indirectly kills off\r\na species through starvation, from extermination of certain insects or\r\nplants on which it depends for food. Many species, such as the Moas, were\r\nevidently greatly reduced in numbers by cataclysms of Nature, such as\r\nvolcanic outbreaks, earthquakes, floods, bush fires, etc., and then died\r\nout from what appears only explicable by the natural exhaustion of their\r\nvitality. The chief cause of the extermination of the Moas was undoubtedly\r\ntheir slaughter by the Maoris for food, but in several inaccessible parts\r\nof the interior large numbers of Moa remains have been found which\r\nundoubtedly had died for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nThis cause also seems to be the only explanation of the dying out of such\r\nbirds as _Aechmorhynchus_, _Chaetoptila_, _Camptolaimus_ and others.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy fact however remains that man and his satellites, cats,\r\nrats, dogs, and pigs are the worst and in fact the only important agents of\r\ndestruction of the native avifaunas wherever they go.\r\n\r\nI have not included in the body of this work the fossil species from the\r\npleistocene of Europe, Asia, Australia and America, as I believe that these\r\nbelonged to an avifauna of an epoch considerably anterior to those\r\nattributed to the pleistocene of New Zealand and the adjacent islands, as\r\nwell as that of the Mascarenes and Madagascar. I, however, give here the\r\nlist of the species described from the above mentioned regions which I have\r\nbeen able to find in our literature, to serve as a guide to those who may\r\nthink I ought to have included them in the work itself.\r\n\r\n  _Strix melitensis_ Lydekker                  Malta.\r\n  _Vultur melitensis_ Lydekker                 Malta.\r\n  _Pelecanus proavus_ De Vis                   Queensland.\r\n  _Phalacrocorax sp._ Lydekker                 New Zealand.\r\n  _Aythya robusta_ De Vis                      Queensland.\r\n  _Anas elapsa_ De Vis                         Queensland.\r\n  _Anas benedeni_ Sharpe                       Belgium.\r\n  _Alopochen pugil_ Winge                      Brazil.\r\n  {x}\r\n  _Dendrocygna validipennis_ (De Vis)          Queensland.\r\n  _Branta hypsibata_ Cope                      Oregon.\r\n  _Branta propinqua_ Schufeldt                 Oregon.\r\n  _Anser scaldii_ Van Beneden                  Belgium.\r\n  _Anser sp._ Lydekker                         England.\r\n  _Anser coudoni_ Schufeldt                    Oregon.\r\n  _Cygnus sp._ Lydekker                        Malta.\r\n  _Cygnus falconeri_ Parker                    Malta.\r\n  _Palaeopelargus nobilis_ De Vis              Queensland.\r\n  _Prociconia lydekkeri_ Ameghino              Brazil.\r\n  _Platibis subtenuis_ De Vis                  Queensland.\r\n  _Grus proavus_ Marsh                         New Jersey.\r\n  _Grus melitensis_ Lydekker                   Malta.\r\n  _Grus turfa_ Portis                          Italy.\r\n  _Grus primigenia_ Milne Edwards              France.\r\n  _Fulica prior_ De Vis                        Queensland.\r\n  _Fulica pisana_ Portis                       Italy.\r\n  _Porphyrio mackintoshi_ De Vis               Queensland.\r\n  _Gallinula strenuipes_ De Vis                Queensland.\r\n  _Gallinula peralata_ De Vis                  Queensland.\r\n  _Microtribonyx effluxus_ De Vis              Queensland.\r\n  _Progura gallinacea_ De Vis                  Queensland.\r\n  _Columba melitensis_ Lydekker                Malta.\r\n  _Lithophaps ulnaris_ De Vis                  Queensland.\r\n  _Gallus sp._ Lydekker                        New Zealand.\r\n  _Gallus sp._ Lydekker                        Central Germany.\r\n  _Phasianus sp._ Lydekker                     Germany.\r\n  _Perdix sp._ Issel                           Italy.\r\n  _Tetrao sp._ Issel                           Italy.\r\n  _Metapteryx bifrons_ De Vis                  Queensland.\r\n  _Dromaius queenslandiae_ (De Vis)            Queensland.\r\n  _Dromaius gracilipes_ (De Vis)               Queensland.\r\n  _Dromaius patricius_ (De Vis)                East Australia.\r\n  _Genyornis newtoni_ Sterling & Zeitz         South Australia.\r\n  _Casuarius lydekkeri_ nom. nov.\r\n\r\n\"The distal extremity of the tibio-tarsus is narrow, without a semilunar\r\npit on the lateral surface of the ectocondyle, and with a very deep\r\nextensor groove\" (Lydekker, Cat.

The original is preserved in the Museum at Sydney and was\r\nobtained from the pleistocene cavern-deposits in the Wellington Valley in\r\nNew South Wales.\r\n\r\nA bird usually stated to be extinct is _Monarcha dimidiata_, from\r\nRara-Tonga, but in March, 1901, two specimens, male and female, were\r\nprocured by the Earl of Ranfurly. Doubtless this is a species which will\r\none day vanish entirely, but at present it hardly comes within the scope of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nThe birds known to be more or less on the verge of extinction which I have\r\nnot thought advisable to give in the main part of this book might, for\r\nconvenience of reference and to avoid possible controversy as to my having\r\nomitted any species, be given here, but it must be understood that of these\r\nspecies I only know the fact that their numbers have been greatly reduced\r\nand mostly almost to vanishing point. I have already mentioned before that\r\nsome of them may already have disappeared, but in many cases recent\r\ninvestigations are wanting, and all, therefore, that can be said of them is\r\nthat they are threatened and may soon become extinct, if they still exist.\r\n\r\n  _Myadestes sibilans_                    St. Vincent.\r\n  _Myadestes genibarbis_                  Martinique.\r\n  _Cinclocerthia gutturalis_              Martinique.\r\n  _Rhamphocinclus brachyurus_             Martinique.\r\n  _Ixocincla olivacea_                    Mauritius.\r\n  _Phedina borbonica_                     Mascarene Islands.\r\n  _Trochocercus borbonicus_               Mascarene Islands.\r\n  _Oxynotus typicus_                      Mauritius.\r\n  _Foudia newtoni_                        Bourbon.\r\n  _Drymoeca rodericana_                   Rodriguez.\r\n  _Cyanorhamphus cooki_                   Norfolk Island.\r\n  _Cyanorhamphus erythrotis_              Antipodes Island.\r\n  _Cyanorhamphus unicolor_                Antipodes Island.\r\n  _Turnagra tanagra_                      North Island, New Zealand.\r\n  _Sceloglaux albifacies_                 Middle Island, New Zealand.\r\n  _Miro albifrons_                        North Island, New Zealand.\r\n  _Miro australis_                        Middle Island, New Zealand.\r\n  _Clitonyx albicilla_                    North Island, New Zealand.\r\n  _Pogonornis cincta_                     North Island, New Zealand.\r\n  _Hypotaenidia mülleri_                  Auckland Island.\r\n  _Mergus australis_                      Auckland Island.\r\n  {xii}\r\n  _Nesonetta aucklandica_                 Auckland Island.\r\n  _Ocydromus? sylvestris_                 Lord Howe's Island.\r\n  _Puffinus newelli_                      Hawaiian Islands.\r\n  _Telespiza flaviceps_                   Hawaii.\r\n  _Nesochen sandvicensis_                 Hawaii.\r\n  _Pareudiastes pacificus_                Samoa.\r\n  _Nesomimus trifasciatus_                Charles? and Gardener\r\n                                            Island, Galápagos Islands.\r\n  _Phalacrocorax harrisi_                 Galápagos Islands.\r\n  _Meleagris americana_                   United States.\r\n  _Conurus carolinensis_                  Southern United States.\r\n  _Pseudgryphus californianus_            California.\r\n  _Amazona guildingi_                     St. Vincent.\r\n  _Campephilus principalis_               Southern United States.\r\n  _Pyrrhula pyrrhula murina_              Azores.\r\n  _Stringops habroptilus_                 New Zealand.\r\n  _Anthornis melanocephala_               Chatham Islands.\r\n  _Gallinago pusilla_                     Chatham Islands.\r\n  _Thinornis novaezealandiae_             Chatham Islands.\r\n  _Amazona augusta_                       Dominica.\r\n  _Amazona bouqueti_                      St. Lucia.\r\n  _Amazona versicolor_                    Dominica.\r\n  _Hemignathus lanaiensis_                Lanai, Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\nMany of my readers will, I fear, find fault with me for having bestowed\r\nnames on a number of forms, known only from fragments of bones, single\r\nbones, or two or three bones. Especially will they, I fear, blame me for\r\ndoing this when these forms have been described by other authors who have\r\nrefrained from giving names. My reasons for doing so are very simple: in\r\nsuch cases as Dr. Parker's species which are fully described, but quoted\r\nunder the formula _Pachyornis species A_ or _Anomalopteryx species B_, the\r\ndanger lies in different authors using the same formula for quite other\r\nspecies. In the case of others, where an author fears to name a form, but\r\ngives the distinctive characters and quotes only _Casuarius species_ or\r\n_Emeus sp._, unless the author and page are quoted, confusion must arise,\r\nand so in both cases I have thought it easier for reference and also more\r\nconcise to name all these forms which have been described or differentiated\r\nwithout a binomial or trinomial appellation. I have, however, refrained\r\nfrom doing so in the foregoing list of Pleistocene species in the {xiii}\r\nfollowing eight cases as I was not able to decide anything about them with\r\nthe material or literature at my disposal, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  _Phalacrocorax sp._ Lydekker            New Zealand.\r\n  _Anser sp._ Lydekker                    England.\r\n  _Cygnus sp._ Lydekker                   Malta.\r\n  _Gallus sp._ Lydekker                   New Zealand.\r\n  _Gallus sp._ Lydekker                   Central Germany.\r\n  _Phasianus sp._ Lydekker                Germany.\r\n  _Perdix sp._ Issel                      Italy.\r\n  _Tetrao sp._ Issel                      Italy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{xv}\r\n\r\n                  LITERATURE REFERRING TO EXTINCT BIRDS.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to quote all books in which extinct birds have\r\nbeen mentioned; not only would that mean a tedious, long work, and a book\r\nin itself, but, the repetitions being so numerous, it would have been of\r\nvery little use. On the other hand, I have tried to quote the most\r\nimportant literature referring to Extinct Birds, and I have specially been\r\nanxious to cite and verify the principal ancient literature. Well known\r\ngeneral works on birds in which extinct species have, of course, also been\r\nmentioned, are, as a rule, not quoted; such as: The 27 volumes of the\r\nCatalogue of Birds; Brisson's Ornithology; Daubenton's, Buffon's and\r\nMontbeillard's works; Latham's Ornithological Writings; Linnaeus' Systema\r\nNaturae in all its editions; Vieillot's writings; popular natural histories\r\nand school books; Brehm's Thierleben in its various editions; Finsch's\r\nPapageien; Gray's and Sharpe's Hand-lists; Dubois' Synopsis Avium, lists of\r\nspecimens in Museums, and many others, in which extinct birds are as a\r\nmatter of course mentioned.\r\n\r\nThree most complete detailed bibliographies must be named: The\r\n\"Bibliography of the Didinae,\" forming Appendix B. of Strickland's \"Dodo\r\nand its Kindred\" (1848), the Bibliography of _Alca impennis_ by Wilhelm\r\nBlasius in the new Edition of Naumann, vol. XII, pp. 169-176 (1903), and\r\nthe Bibliography referring to the Moas by Hamilton, in the Trans. New\r\nZealand Institute XXVI and XXVII (1894, 1895).\r\n\r\nMost of the books and pamphlets quoted hereafter are in my library at the\r\nZoological Museum at Tring, in the ornithological part of which Dr. Hartert\r\nand I have been specially interested for many years. Those books that are\r\nnot in my library are marked with an asterisk, but several of these I have\r\nbeen able to consult in other libraries.\r\n\r\nThe chronological order appeared to be best suited to the particular\r\nsubject treated of. {xvi}\r\n\r\n    1580 or 90.

II (1893).\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1674 a note about the \"Huppe\" exists, by \"Le Sieur D.B.,\"\r\n_i.e._, Dubois. He says, when describing the birds of Réunion (translated):\r\n\"Hoopoes or 'Callendres,' having a white tuft on the head, the rest of the\r\nplumage white and grey, the bill and the feet like a bird of prey; they are\r\na little larger than the young pigeons; this is another good game (_i.e._,\r\nto eat) when it is fat.\"\r\n\r\nThis description has generally been accepted as referring to the\r\n_Fregilupus_, though that of the bill and feet is then due to an error of\r\nthe author, for _Fregilupus_ has the bill and feet of a member of the\r\n_Sturnidae_ or family of Starlings.\r\n\r\nGood descriptions and representations of the \"Huppe\" have been given in\r\nmany places (see literature), but whether they were taken from males or\r\nfemales is generally not known. The sexes seem to be alike in colour, but\r\nthe female is smaller, and has a shorter and straighter bill than the male.\r\nAt least, this is the conclusion of Dr. Hartert, who saw the four examples\r\nin the museum at Troyes. As far as he could see through the glass all four\r\n{4} seemed to be adult birds, but two were larger with longer and more\r\ncurved bills, two smaller and with shorter and straighter beaks, so that\r\nthey are evidently two pairs.\r\n\r\nThis bird seems to have become extirpated about the middle of the last\r\ncentury. The late Monsieur Pollen wrote in 1868 (translated): \"This species\r\nhas become so rare that one did not hear them mentioned for a dozen years.\r\nIt has been destroyed in all the littoral districts, and even in the\r\nmountains near the coast. Trustworthy persons, however, have assured us\r\nthat they must still exist in the forests of the interior, near St. Joseph.\r\nThe old creoles told me that, in their youth, these birds were still\r\ncommon, and that they were so stupid that one could kill them with sticks.\r\nThey call this bird the \"Hoopoe.\" It is, therefore, not wrong what a\r\ndistinguished inhabitant of Réunion, Mr. A. Legras, wrote about this bird\r\nwith the following words: \"The Hoopoe has become so rare that we have\r\nhardly seen a dozen in our wanderings to discover birds; we were even\r\ngrieved to search for it in vain in our museum.\"\r\n\r\nWe are certain that _Fregilupus_ existed still on Réunion in 1835, as\r\nMonsieur Desjardins, living on Mauritius, wrote in a manuscript formerly\r\nbelonging to the late Professor Milne-Edwards: \"My friend, Marcelin\r\nSauzier, has sent me four alive from Bourbon in May, 1835. They eat\r\neverything. Two have escaped some months afterwards, and it might well\r\nhappen that they will stock our forests.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems, indeed, that specimens were killed in 1837 on Mauritius, where\r\nthey did not originally exist. Verreaux shot an example in Réunion in 1832.\r\n\r\nThe names \"La Huppe du Cap\" and \"_Upupa madagascariensis_\" arose out of the\r\nmistaken notions that this bird lived in South Africa or Madagascar, but we\r\nknow now that its real home was Réunion or Bourbon.\r\n\r\n    WE ARE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING SPECIMENS PRESERVED IN COLLECTIONS.\r\n\r\n    2 stuffed ones, one in good, one in bad condition, and two in spirits,\r\n    in the Paris Museum.\r\n\r\n    4 stuffed in Troyes.\r\n\r\n    1 stuffed, from the Riocour collection, in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n    1 in the Florence Museum.\r\n\r\n    1 in Turin.\r\n\r\n    1 in Pisa.\r\n\r\n    1, rather poor and old, in Leyden.\r\n\r\n    1 in Stockholm.\r\n\r\n    1 in the Museum at Port Louis, on the island of Mauritius.\r\n\r\n    1 in the collection of the late Baron de Selys Longchamps.\r\n\r\n    1 in Genoa.\r\n\r\n{5}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NECROPSAR GÜNTHER & NEWTON.\r\n\r\nThe authors state that this genus was very closely allied to _Fregilupus_,\r\nand, besides some minor differences, give as the principal difference the\r\nshorter and less curved bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   NECROPSAR RODERICANUS GÜNTH. & NEWT.\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 2, FIG. 2.)\r\n\r\n    _Necropsar rodericanus_ Günther & Newton, Phil. Trans. vol. 168, p.\r\n    427, pl. XLII, figs. A-G (1879).\r\n\r\nThe original description given by the anonymous author of the \"Relation de\r\nl'Ile Rodrigue\" is as follows:--\"These birds are a little larger than a\r\nblackbird, and have white plumage, part of the wings and the tail black,\r\nthe beak and the legs yellow, and make a wonderful warbling.\" Our author\r\nalso says they inhabited the Islet au Mât, and fed on seabirds' eggs and\r\ndead turtle.\r\n\r\nThe bird evidently became extinct on Rodriguez before 1730, and lingered a\r\nlittle longer on the outlying islets. Only known from bones, mostly\r\ncollected by the Rev. H. H. Slater, and the above description.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Rodriguez and neighbouring islets.\r\n\r\nThere is one tibia in the Tring Museum.\r\n\r\nThe figure is coloured according to the description, while the shape of the\r\nbird is evident from its bones and relation. {6}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NECROPSAR LEGUATI FORBES.\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 2, FIG. 3.)\r\n\r\n    _Necropsar leguati_ Forbes, Bull. Liverp. Mus. I, p. 34, pl.\r\n    _Sturnidae_ I (1897-1898).\r\n\r\nDr. Forbes' description is as follows:--\"General colour white everywhere,\r\nexcept on the outer webs of distal half of the primaries and secondaries\r\nand the outer webs of the newly moulted and both webs of the unmoulted\r\nrectrices, which are marked with lighter or darker ferruginous.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Forbes then gives an exhaustive description of the structure, to which\r\nI refer my readers, and the following measurements:--\r\n\r\n  Culmen    32  mm.\r\n  Wing     109   \"\r\n  Tail      98   \"\r\n  Tarsus    31.5 \"\r\n\r\nI should have been inclined to consider this bird an albinistic specimen of\r\nthe bird described in \"Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue,\" but for the fact that\r\nthe tibia of _Necropsar rodericanus_ is 52-59 mm. in length, while this is\r\nonly 46 mm. in length, while the metatarsus measures 31.5 mm. as opposed to\r\n36-41 mm. in _N. rodericanus_. I cannot accept the theory that this is the\r\nIslet au Mât bird, and therefore different from _N. rodericanus_, as the\r\nislet is too close to Rodriguez to have had a different starling. I\r\ntherefore believe this bird to have been an albinistic specimen of the\r\nMauritius species of _Necropsar_, for there can be little doubt that it is\r\nalbinistic, as the ferruginous colour is much stronger on one wing than on\r\nthe other; and I conclude that the colour in the wings and tail in normal\r\nspecimens was black like the Rodriguez bird, and that _N. leguati_ was a\r\nclose ally of _N. rodericanus_, from which it differed principally in its\r\nmuch smaller size.\r\n\r\nHabitat doubtful.--The type specimen bears Lord Derby's Museum number,\r\n1792, and a label of Verreaux giving Madagascar as the habitat, which is\r\ncertainly erroneous.\r\n\r\n{7}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FOUDIA BRUANTE (P.L.S.

In the plate the whole body, including the\r\nback, is uniform red, about the same red as in other species of _Foudia_,\r\nwhile the wings and tail are dark brown with yellowish-brown borders. In\r\nthe description the body plumage is described as rufous (\"morderé\") and the\r\nwings, wing-coverts and tail as more or less bright rufous (\"d'un mordoré\r\nplus ou moins clair\"). The size is said to be about that of a Bunting, but\r\nthe tail shorter and the wings longer.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Sharpe (Cat. B. XIII, p. 484) \"it has generally been\r\nconsidered identical with _Foudia madagascariensis_,\" but the latter has\r\nthe back marked with longitudinal black spots, while both the figure and\r\ndescription of _F. bruante_ represent a uniform red upperside; moreover the\r\nlocality of the latter is expressly stated, and as we know other forms of\r\n_Foudia_ from the Seychelles, Mauritius, Comoros, Aldabra and Madagascar,\r\nwe have no reason to doubt the statement.

I p. 526 (1850).\r\n\r\nThe genus _Chaunoproctus_ contains only one species, which is characterized\r\nby its enormous bill, the depth of the mandible being greater than the\r\ndistance between the nasal apertures. The cutting-edge of the maxilla is\r\nnearly straight, and there is no tooth in the posterior half of the\r\nmaxilla. The total length is about seven to eight inches. The adult male\r\nhas red in the plumage, the female is brown, above and below.\r\n\r\nDr. Hartert (Vögel pal. Fauna I, p. 115) is of opinion that this bird is\r\nconnected with _Carpodacus_ and allies, and not with the Greenfinches and\r\nHawfinches, among which it is placed in the Catalogue of Birds in the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CHAUNOPROCTUS FERREOROSTRIS (VIG.)\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 3, FIG. 4.)\r\n\r\n    _Coccothraustes ferreorostris_ (_sic_) Vigors, Zool.

Bill very\r\nstrong, feet plumbeous. Length of body 8½, bill 7/8, at gape 1-3/16, height\r\n7/8; wings from the carpus to the third quill 4½; tail 3, tarsus 7/8\r\ninches.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Catalogue of Birds,\" XII, p. 31, both sexes are carefully\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nIt appears that only one pair, now in the British Museum, was obtained\r\nduring Captain Beechey's voyage. Curiously enough, Vigors suggested that\r\nthe brilliantly coloured adult male might be the young, the female the\r\nadult bird, \"as is the case in the Pine-Grosbeak\" (_Sic!_).\r\n\r\nKittlitz, who visited the largest of the Bonin Islands in May, 1828,\r\nobtained a number of specimens, of which some are in St. Petersburg, two in\r\nFrankfurt-a.-M., one or two in Leyden, and, I believe, in Paris. {10} These\r\nseem to be all the specimens known in European museums. Mr. Seebohm's\r\ncollector, the late Holst, failed to obtain it, and Mr. Alan Owston's men,\r\nwho several times went to the Bonin group to obtain it, and who were\r\npromised good prices for specimens, did not get one. I am therefore\r\nconvinced that for some unknown reason this bird became extinct, though\r\nthere is still the possibility that the recent collectors did not collect\r\non the main island of the group, which alone was visited by Kittlitz.\r\n\r\nKittlitz tells us that he found it in the woods along the coast, but not\r\nnumerous. That it keeps concealed, is very phlegmatic, and is so little shy\r\nthat one is obliged to go back for some distance, before shooting, if one\r\nwishes to preserve the specimen. Kittlitz saw it but seldom on high trees,\r\nmostly on the ground. Its frequently heard note is a very fine piping\r\nsound. In the crop and stomach small fruit and buds of one kind of tree\r\nwere found.\r\n\r\nHabitat: The largest of the Bonin Islands, south of Japan.\r\n\r\n{11}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GEOSPIZA MAGNIROSTRIS GOULD.\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 3, FIG. 1.)\r\n\r\n    _Geospiza magnirostris_ Gould, Proc.

XII, pp. 6, 7 (Fig.); Ridgway, B.\r\n    North and Middle America I, p. 495 (1901).\r\n\r\nAs explained in Nov. Zool. 1899, p. 154, it is uncertain where Darwin\r\nobtained the type specimens of Gould's _G. magnirostris_, as\r\n\"Unfortunately, most of the specimens of the finch-tribe were mingled\r\ntogether,\" as Darwin tells us in his \"Journal of Researches\" (New Edition\r\n1890, p. 420), and he had only \"strong reasons to suspect that some of the\r\nspecies of the sub-group _Geospiza_ are confined to separate islands.\" We\r\nare, however, convinced that the types of _G. magnirostris_ can only have\r\ncome from Charles Island, where it is, probably, the representative of _G.\r\nstrenua strenua_. It seems, however, that _G. magnirostris_ exists no\r\nlonger, for all subsequent collectors have failed to obtain specimens,\r\nunless an immature specimen in the U. S. Nat. Mus., from Charles Island\r\n(No. 115,905), is a young _magnirostris_ (cf. Nov. Zool. 1902, p. 388).\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the three black specimens in the British Museum are as\r\nfollows: Culmen 26.5, 27, 27; height of bill at base 23.5-24; wing 91, 91,\r\n95; tarsus 25 mm. These measurements--a culmen of over 26.5 and a wing of\r\n91 mm. combined--do not occur among our large series of _strenua_, and\r\ntherefore it is hardly possible that _G. magnirostris_ is composed of huge\r\nexamples of _strenua_ only.\r\n\r\nAs Charles Island has been inhabited for many years it is not at all\r\nunlikely that a bird became extinct on that place. On plate 3 is figured\r\n_G. magnirostris_ and a head of _G. strenua_ for comparison. {12}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GEOSPIZA DENTIROSTRIS GOULD.\r\n\r\n    _Geospiza dentirostris_ Gould, Proc.

Zool. 1899 p. 163, 1902 p. 396.\r\n\r\nThis curious form differs from _G. fortis fortis_ (Charles Island!) in its\r\nbill, which is bowed in towards the end of the upper mandible, and slightly\r\n\"toothed\" on its cutting edge. The one specimen in the British Museum\r\ncertainly came from Charles Island, and we may, therefore, conclude that\r\nthe other also came from there, and there is certainly no reason to think\r\nthat it came from Chatham Island. As the skins in the British Museum\r\nslightly differ from each other, there is some reason to suspect that they\r\nare both aberrations of _G. fortis fortis_. Otherwise it must have become\r\nextinct, as, in spite of special attention being paid to it, none of the\r\nrecent collectors met with _G. dentirostris_.\r\n\r\n{13}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         POMAREA NIGRA (SPARRM.)\r\n\r\n    _Muscicapa nigra Sparrmann_, Mus.

Zealand II p. 125? pl.\r\n    XII (October, 1906).\r\n\r\nThe late Sir Walter Buller described, in 1873, _Miro traversi_ as follows:\r\n\"Adult male. The whole of the plumage black, the base of the feathers dark\r\nplumbeous; wing-feathers and their coverts tinged with brown, the former\r\ngreyish on their inner surface; tail-feathers black, very slightly tinged\r\nwith brown. Irides dark brown; bill black; tarsi and toes blackish brown,\r\nthe soles of the feet dull yellow. Total length 6 inches; wing, from\r\nflexure, 3.4; tail 2.6; bill 0.5, tarsus 1.1; middle toe and claw 0.1, hind\r\ntoe and claw 0.8 inch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Female. Slightly smaller than the male, and without the brown tinge on the\r\nwings and tail.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added that _Miro traversi_ is not pure black, but of a somewhat\r\nbrownish slaty black.\r\n\r\n_Miro traversi_ is only known from the Chatham Islands, where it was\r\nformerly very common, but, according to a letter from the late W. Hawkins,\r\nthe cats, which have been introduced to destroy rats and rabbits, have\r\nexterminated it. It seems to have disappeared from Warekauri, the main\r\nisland of the Chatham group, long ago, for H. O. Forbes (Ibis 1893, p. 524)\r\nand Henry Palmer found it, in 1890 and 1892, only on the outlying islets of\r\nMangare and Little Mangare.\r\n\r\nThe bird from the Snares is quite different, being deep glossy black and\r\nhaving a shorter and narrower first primary. I named it _M. dannefaerdi_.\r\nIt is to be feared that a similar fate will one day befall it as has,\r\napparently, already befallen its congener from the Chatham Islands.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Buller (Suppl. B.N.Z. II, p. 125) has confounded _M. traversi_\r\nand _dannefaerdi_, and the figure he gave on his plate looks so black, that\r\nI do not doubt it represents rather the latter than the former. Of course\r\n_M. dannefaerdi_ alone occurs on the Snares, and Buller's _traversi_ from\r\nthe Snares were all dannefaerdi. Dr. Finsch's statement (Ibis 1888, p. 308)\r\nthat Reischek's specimen from the Snares \"agreed in every respect with\r\nspecimens from the Chatham Islands\" is entirely wrong, for, even if {16}\r\none prefers unscientifically to lump allied forms, one cannot say that a\r\n_Miro_ from the Chathams agrees in every respect with one from the Snares.\r\nBuller's doubts about the distinctness of the latter might easily have been\r\nremoved, if he had taken the trouble to compare them, for it does not\r\nrequire any genius to see the differences. I admit that with my present\r\nviews on geographical forms I would regard the two _Miro_ as sub-species,\r\nand call them _M. traversi traversi_ and _M. traversi dannefaerdi_, but\r\nmost ornithologists would still consider them to be \"good species.\"\r\n\r\nI may add that Buller, l.c., p. 125, has not quoted my description\r\ncorrectly, for in his rendering are several disturbing misprints, and in\r\nthe fourth line from the bottom occurs a \"not\" which ought not to be there,\r\nand which makes the sentence incomprehensible. Also the name itself is\r\nspelt incorrectly.\r\n\r\nI have a series from Mangare and Little Mangare, taken by Henry Palmer in\r\n1890. The egg seems to be unknown.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Chatham Islands.\r\n\r\n{17}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TURDUS TERRESTRIS KITTL.\r\n\r\n    _Turdus terrestris_ Kittlitz, Mém. Acad. Sc.

Geocichline markings on inner webs of quills dirty\r\nwhite. Wing 3.8 inches, tail 2.6, culmen 0.85, tarsus 1.07, bastard primary\r\n0.8.\"\r\n\r\nThe only person who ever collected this short-tailed Ground-Thrush was\r\nKittlitz, who obtained four specimens, one of which is in St. Petersburg,\r\none in Frankfurt, one in Vienna, and one in Leyden. Neither Holst, nor Alan\r\nOwston's Japanese collectors obtained specimens, though their special\r\nattention was called to it. Therefore, unless these recent collectors left\r\nunvisited the most important island of the group, we must suppose that it\r\nbecame extinct.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Bonin Islands, south-east of Japan.\r\n\r\n{19}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PHAEORNIS OAHENSIS WILSON & EVANS.\r\n\r\n    _Phaeornis oahensis_ Wilson & Evans, Aves Hawaiienses, Introd. p.

A beautiful songster.\"\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that Bloxam considered both forms to be distinct, and\r\nMessrs. Wilson and Evans were perfectly justified in naming the extinct\r\nOahu form.\r\n\r\nWe are not aware of any specimens being preserved in any Museum, though\r\nBloxam obtained a skin. Messrs. Wilson and Evans (l.c.) write:--\"All the\r\nspecimens obtained by Mr. Andrew Bloxam, properly prepared and labelled,\r\nwere placed at the disposal of the Lords of the Admiralty, as shewn by a\r\ncopy of the letter he wrote to their Secretary, and probably all were sent,\r\nas some certainly were, to the British Museum; but no other trace of this\r\nunique specimen of a vanished species, which may be properly called\r\n_Phaeornis oahensis_, is now forthcoming.\"\r\n\r\n{21}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BOWDLERIA RUFESCENS (BULLER).\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 5, FIG. 3.)\r\n\r\n    _Sphenoeacus rufescens_ Buller, Ibis 1869, p. 38.\r\n\r\n    _Megalurus rufescens_ Gray Hand-l.

X (1906).\r\n\r\nIn 1894 I described this remarkable little bird as follows: \"_Traversia_,\r\ngen. nov. _Xenicidarum_. Differs in several important points both from\r\n_Xenicus_ and _Acanthidositta_. Bill much larger and stouter, very little\r\nshorter, if at all, than the tarsus; the latter about as long as middle toe\r\nwithout claw, or the hind toe and claw, while in _Xenicus_ and\r\n_Acanthidositta_ it is about twice as long as the hind toe. The principal\r\ndifference, however, is the weakness of the wing, which suggests\r\nflightlessness, as does also the very soft and loose character of the\r\nentire plumage, and the very Ralline aspect of the bird. There are only ten\r\ntail-feathers, and the scutellation of the tarsus is like that of\r\n_Xenicus_. These two points determine its position in the _Xenicidae_ at\r\nonce (cf. Sclater, Cat. B. XIV, p. 450).\r\n\r\n\"The type is: _Traversia lyalli_, sp. nov.\r\n\r\n\"Male. Above dark brownish olive-yellow, each feather with a brownish-black\r\nborder. A narrow distinct yellow superciliary line. Wings and tail\r\number-brown, the inner webs darker; wing-coverts like back. Chin, throat,\r\nand breast chrome-yellow, each feather slightly edged with greyish brown.\r\nFlanks, abdomen, and vent pale brown, centre of feathers paler.\r\n\r\n\"Female. Upper surface umber-brown, each feather bordered with very dark\r\nbrown; wings and tail similar. Under surface buffy grey, the feathers edged\r\nwith pale brown. Total length about 4 inches, culmen 0.6, wing 1.8 to 1.9,\r\ntail 0.8, but much concealed, tarens 0.75, middle toe 0.65, hind toe\r\nwithout claw 0.5. {24}\r\n\r\n\"Habitat: Stephens Island, New Zealand. Discovered by Mr. Dr. Lyall,\r\nlighthouse-keeper, and sent to me by Mr. Henry H. Travers.\"\r\n\r\nI received nine specimens of this new bird, and was not aware that any\r\nothers had been taken at that time. As I was unable to attend the December\r\nmeeting, 1894, of the British Ornithologists Club, I asked Dr. Hartert to\r\nexhibit the birds in my name. When he had done so and had read the\r\ndescription, the Chairman, Dr. P. L. Sclater, said that the bird had also\r\nbeen received for illustration and description in the Ibis, from Sir Walter\r\nBuller, and he asked Dr. Hartert if I would not withdraw my description.\r\nDr. Hartert said that this was unfortunate, but he had no authority to\r\nwithdraw my description, and he and Dr. Sharpe thought that the proceedings\r\nof the meeting should be printed without consideration of any manuscripts\r\nwhich might refer to the same bird. No doubt this was hard luck on Sir\r\nWalter Buller, but it would have been equally hard luck for me if he had\r\nforestalled me with the new bird. He had only one specimen, I had nine, of\r\nboth sexes, and I had paid a high price for them, as types of a new bird.\r\nMy type is in Tring, and, as everybody knows, available for study by any\r\ncompetent ornithologist, while Buller's type was not in any museum, and it\r\nwas uncertain to whom he would sell it afterwards. I suppose it is now in\r\nthe Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, to which Buller's third collection, 625\r\nspecimens, was sold for a thousand pounds, as Buller himself tells us in\r\nhis Supplement II, p. 167, under the heading of _Glaucopis wilsoni_! On the\r\nsame page Sir Walter Buller also tells us that his \"second collection\" was\r\nsold to me, but he makes a mistake about the price, as I certainly did not\r\npay a thousand pounds for it.\r\n\r\nI mentioned these unimportant details, because Buller rather bitterly and\r\nseverely complained about my describing the Stephens' Island Wren, on p.\r\n111 of his supplement. I may only add that of course my name, being\r\npublished in December, 1894, has the priority over his, which was not\r\npublished before April, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe history of _Traversia lyalli_ is perhaps the most extraordinary of any\r\nbird known. All the specimens I am aware of, viz., the eight now in my\r\ncollection, the type of \"_Xenicus insularis_\" in Buller's former\r\ncollection, one in the late Canon Tristram's collection, one in the British\r\nMuseum (ex Tring), and two or more offered some years ago by Mr. Travers,\r\nwere brought in by the lighthouse-keeper's cat. Evidently this feline\r\ndiscoverer has at the same time been the exterminator of _Traversia\r\nlyalli_, and many may have been digested by that unique cat, as in letters\r\nreceived from Mr. Travers I {25} have been told that no more specimens\r\ncould be obtained, and Buller (l.c.) says: \"Very diligent search has been\r\nmade on Stephen Island for further specimens of the Island Wren, but\r\nwithout success, and there is too much reason to fear that this species has\r\nalmost immediately after its discovery become extinct.\"\r\n\r\nHabitat: Stephen Island, a small, partly wooded islet, about a square mile\r\nin extent, in Cook Strait. It is almost impossible that this bird has only\r\nexisted on Stephen Island. It must have been overlooked on d'Urville Island\r\nor the \"mainland,\" where it probably became extinct--through rats and cats,\r\nand similar pests--long ago.\r\n\r\n{27}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MOHO APICALIS GOULD.\r\n\r\n                              (PLATE 4A, 1.)\r\n\r\n    _Yellow-tufted Bee-eater_ (non Latham!), Dixon, Voyage round the World,\r\n    p. 357, plate (1789).\r\n\r\n    _Moho apicalis_ Gould, Proc.

This bird belongs doubtless to\r\nthe family of _Meliphagidae_ or Honey-eaters, and the genus is sufficiently\r\ndistinct from all others. There are no fleshy wattles anywhere. The tail is\r\nlong and strongly graduated; all the rectrices are obliquely pointed at\r\ntheir tips.

From the generic characters he gives it is evident\r\nthat it was a bird with a long, curved bill, lanceolate feathers on the\r\nhead and throat, and long, strongly graduated tail, doubtless belonging to\r\nthe _Meliphagidae_. The description of the colouration is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Back, wings and tail bright greenish-olive; quills brown inside; shafts of\r\nthe rectrices canary-yellow from below, glossy brown-red from above; top of\r\nhead and neck chestnut, each feather being narrow and streaked with white,\r\nthen with fawn-colour on the top; the feathers of the throat are elongated\r\nand fringed out on their edges, very narrow and lanceolate, grey at base,\r\nwhite at the tips; cheeks, sides of neck and chest ferruginous, some white\r\nstreaks on the feathers of the chest and in the middle of the throat;\r\nflanks and belly clear rufous, passing into canary-yellow on the under\r\ntail-coverts. Tail from below greenish-yellow; tarsi horn-colour, bill\r\nabove brownish, below yellowish with brown tip. Length about eight french\r\ninches and a half (0.23 centimètres).\" (_Translated._)\r\n\r\nThis bird was said to have come from Australia. I have made enquiries, but\r\nthe type seems to have disappeared. There is something in the description\r\nreminding us of _Chaetoptila angustipluma_. Unless the description is\r\nfaulty, this bird came probably not from Australia, but from one of the\r\nPacific Islands. It has not been observed since, and is possibly extinct.\r\n\r\n{31}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DREPANIS TEMM.\r\n\r\n    _Drepanis_ Temminck, Man. d'Orn. Ed. II, I p.

The bill is long,\r\ncurved, non-serrated, the upper mandible a few millimetres longer than the\r\nlower jaw. Nostrils large, covered by an operculum.

Of the actual status of this\r\nbird in former times we know nothing. Latham described it first (Gmelin\r\nnamed this species after Latham's description) from a pair in the Leverian\r\ncollection, which is now preserved in the Vienna Museum. About half a\r\ncentury ago several specimens were collected by the late W. Mills near\r\nHilo, on the island of Hawaii, the only island where it existed. Nothing\r\ncertain was heard of the \"Mamo\" until, in 1892, my collector Henry Palmer\r\nobtained a fine male, which was caught before his eyes by a native\r\nbirdcatcher. In July, 1898, Mr. H. W. Henshaw saw \"at least a pair,\r\npossibly a whole family,\" in the woods of Kaumana, and in 1899 a native\r\nheard the, to him, well-known call near the same place. This brings the\r\nexistence of the Mamo down to the year 1898 or 1899. In view of the futile\r\nefforts of Messrs. Henry Palmer, {32} Perkins, Henshaw and others to\r\nobserve this rare bird again, we may well suppose that this species is\r\neither extinct, or will very soon vanish if any are left.\r\n\r\nIn former times the Mamo was probably more or less common. Its golden\r\nyellow feathers were of great value, and, though the majority of the famous\r\nwar-cloaks are composed of the feathers of _Moho nobilis_, a few such\r\ncloaks are known to consist of Mamo feathers. It is supposed that it took\r\ngenerations to complete such a cape.\r\n\r\nI only know of specimens of this bird in Vienna, Leyden, Paris, Honolulu,\r\nCambridge and Tring.\r\n\r\nThe two examples in the Vienna Museum were obtained by Fichtel at the sale\r\nof the Leverian collection. One is perfect, the other has the upper portion\r\nof the bill wanting.\r\n\r\n{33}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  HEMIGNATHUS OBSCURUS ELLISIANUS GRAY.\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 4, FIG. 1.)\r\n\r\n    _Hemignathus obscurus_ Lichtenstein (non Gmelin!), Abh.

It is true that Lichtenstein says, that\r\nHerr Deppe procured several specimens, but there is only one in the Berlin\r\nMuseum, and we have no knowledge where the others may be, if they are still\r\nin existence.\r\n\r\nThere can hardly be any doubt that _H. obscurus ellisianus_ is extinct on\r\nOahu, where it was discovered by Deppe. All recent collectors, from Wilson\r\nand Palmer to this day, have failed to find a trace of it. Although\r\ncollecting in the dense forests and rugged mountains of Oahu is most\r\ndifficult, we may suppose that at least one of these collectors would have\r\ncome across it, if it still existed.\r\n\r\nThe following is the description made by Dr. Hartert of the type in\r\nBerlin:--\r\n\r\n\"Above greenish olive-brown, more greenish on the back and rump, and\r\nsomewhat more greyish on the head and hind-neck; the dark bases of the\r\nfeathers on the head showing through, lores deep brown.

Under-wing\r\ncoverts dull white. Bill brown, somewhat horn-brown, but not blackish, as\r\nin the other forms of _Hemignathus_.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that the bill and feet are faded, as in specimens of\r\n_Heterorhynchus lucidus_ collected and stuffed at the same time and kept\r\nside by side with _H. o. ellisianus_, the bill and feet are still blackish\r\nand not brown.\r\n\r\nWing 83.5, tail 53, culmen 56, bill from gape to tip in a straight line\r\n47.5, lower mandible from mental apex to tip 40 mm.\"\r\n\r\n{35}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HETERORHYNCHUS LUCIDUS (LICHT.)\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 4, FIG. 2.)\r\n\r\n    _Hemignathus lucidus_ Lichtenstein, Abh. d.

As the bird was apparently common, it is quite\r\npossible that specimens are preserved in several other collections, and it\r\nwould be most welcome if the officials of continental Museums would give\r\ninformation in case they should find specimens of this interesting extinct\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Oahu.\r\n\r\n{37}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PSITTIROSTRA PSITTACEA DEPPEI ROTHSCH.\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 4, FIG. 3.)\r\n\r\n    _Psittirostra olivacea_ Rothschild, Avifauna of Laysan p. 193\r\n    (1900--Oahu, ex Lichtenstein    nomen nudum & M.S.)\r\n\r\n    _Psittirostra psittacea deppei_ Rothschild, Bull.

Specimens have been collected on Oahu by Prof. Behn\r\nand Herr Deppe, and besides a pair in my collection, I only know of\r\nexamples in the museums of Berlin and Vienna. There is no trace left of\r\nthis species in Oahu, and in spite of great efforts Mr. Palmer and all\r\nother recent collectors did not come across it. This form has thus shared\r\nthe fate of _Hemignathus ellisianus_, _Heterorhynchus lucidus_, _Moho\r\napicalis_ and _Phaeornis oahensis_, which have all disappeared from Oahu,\r\nwhile _Loxops rufa_ may still exist in a few pairs, or has possibly\r\nfollowed suit already.\r\n\r\n{39}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LOXOPS COCCINEA RUFA BLOXAM.\r\n\r\n    _Fringilla rufa_ Bloxam, Voy. \"Blonde\" p. 250 (1826).\r\n\r\n    _Loxops wolstenholmei_ Rothschild, Bull.

Sloane says as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"This was seven Inches from the end of the Bill to that of the Tail, and\r\nten from the end of Wing to Wing expanded, it had a quarter of an Inch long\r\ncrooked black bill, with two _Tubuli_ about one eight Part of an Inch long\r\nfor the Nostrills, along the upper Mandible were several bristly Hairs in a\r\nLine, like those of a Cat's Mustachoes of a black Colour, the _Aperture_ of\r\nChaps or Swallow was extraordinary large.

Inhabits New South Wales. I met\r\nwith a fine specimen of it in the collection of Thomas Wilson, Esqre.\"\r\n\r\nIt has long been a question whether _Nestor productus_ of Gould and _Nestor\r\nnorfolcensis_ of Pelzeln were really distinct or only individual varieties\r\nof one species. I had for a long time considered them to be merely\r\nindividual varieties, for I could not persuade myself that a small island\r\nlike Philip Island, almost contiguous to Norfolk Island, could have a\r\ndifferent species of _Nestor_ to that found on the larger island. Since\r\ncommencing to write this book, however, I have come to somewhat different\r\nconclusions. In the first place no special locality is given for _N.\r\nproductus_ by the earlier authors, in the same way as in the case of\r\n_Notornis alba_, which, like the _Nestor_, was said to come from N. S.\r\nWales. This fact is easily explained, as N. S. Wales and Norfolk Island\r\nwere both penal settlements in the early days, and there was intercourse by\r\nregular vessels plying between these colonies and Lord Howe's Island. Now\r\nwe find in the case of several other birds that distinct local forms occur\r\non Norfolk and Lord Howe's Islands, while as far as I know there is no\r\nother record of a distinct bird from Philip Island. I therefore believe\r\nthat _Nestor productus_ inhabited both Norfolk and Philip Islands, and that\r\nall specimens extant are from Philip Island, where it lingered some years\r\nlonger than on the main island, while the specimens of Ferdinand Bauer and\r\nGovernor Hunter, and possibly the supposed _N. norfolcensis_ of {46} Canon\r\nTristram's collection, now in Liverpool, had been brought from Lord Howe's\r\nIsland in cages and were kept as pets in Norfolk Island; and then, as the\r\nvalue of exact data in those early days of our science was unknown, the\r\nreferences were made to the place whence the specimens were seen or\r\nbrought. One thing however is certain, the bill in Ferdinand Bauer's sketch\r\nis evidently a monstrous growth produced by captivity, for Latham expressly\r\ndescribes the bill of Governor Hunter's bird as ending in a long thin\r\npoint. The differences of _N. norfolcensis_ are the dull crimson sides of\r\nface, chin, and throat; dull green head and hind neck, and the total\r\nabsence of bars on the tail. The plate given herewith is a reproduction of\r\nthe Liverpool bird, with the bill of Ferdinand Bauer's sketch added, as\r\nthis is wanting in that bird, and in the corner a head of the specimen of\r\n_N. productus_, purchased for the Tring Museum, when the late Mr. Wallace's\r\nMuseum at Distington, Cumberland, was dispersed.\r\n\r\nI have carefully examined the three fine specimens of _Nestor productus_ in\r\nthe British Museum, and the conclusion I have come to is that the bird\r\ndescribed by Gould as the adult of his _N. productus_ was an abnormal\r\nspecimen, and was in relation to normal _N. productus_ what the aberrations\r\ncalled \"_superbus_\" and \"_esslingi_\" are to _N. meridionalis_. The bills of\r\nthe British Museum specimens are very different. The one from the Bell\r\ncollection has the long, thin bill, but it is at least half-an-inch to\r\nthree-quarters shorter than those in the Tring and Florence specimens.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Philip Island and probably Norfolk Island.\r\n\r\nOne in Tring, three in London, one in Florence, two in Vienna, one in\r\nPrague, two in Leyden, one in Amsterdam, are known to me.\r\n\r\nThe two specimens in the Vienna Museum were both bought in 1839. One from\r\nWard, with a short bill, brown chest and throat, and a very wide yellow\r\nbreast-band. The other from Baron von Hügel, which has a long bill and very\r\nred cheeks and chin. {47}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NESTOR NORFOLCENSIS PELZELN.\r\n\r\n                         (PLATE 6, full figure.)\r\n\r\n    _Long-billed Parrakeet_ Latham, Gen.

He described it from 2 lower mandibles, much\r\ndamaged, which were dug up from the Mare aux Songes. Except a few further\r\nosseous remains, mostly collected by Sir Edward Newton, nothing more of\r\nimportance was found relating to this bird till Professor Schlegel\r\ndiscovered in the Library of Utrecht the manuscript journal kept during the\r\nvoyage to Mauritius in A.D. 1601-1602 of Wolphart Harmanszoon, in which\r\namong other items of natural history there is a sketch of _Lophopsittacus_\r\nfrom life, and the statement that it was wholly of a grey-blue colour. From\r\nthe fact that this bird is not mentioned by the voyagers who visited\r\nMauritius in the 2nd and 3rd decades of the 18th century, it is probable\r\nthat it was one of the first of the Mascarene birds to become extinct.

It is one third smaller than the\r\nred-fronted species, or 1 ft. 10 in. long, of which the tail takes 11\r\ninches and the bill 18 lines. The latter is of a black colour and has the\r\nupper mandible less curved, and the sides of the lower mandible more\r\nswollen than is the case in the other _Ara_ species. The cheeks are naked\r\nand white, with three lines of red feathers. Head, front and sides of the\r\nneck, breast, belly and thighs red; back of the neck pale yellow; back,\r\nshoulders and smaller wing coverts brownish red bordered with yellow or\r\ngreen; flanks yellowish, primaries above dark azure blue, below coppery\r\nred.

A.\r\nForbes, Oustalet and Salvadori that its nearest affinities appear to be the\r\ngenus _Tanygnathus_ rather than _Coracopsis_, and that the place of\r\n_Mascarinus_ is among the _Palaeornithinae_ of Salvadori.\r\n\r\nThe large red bill, with distinctly ridged gonys, concealed nostrils and\r\nmoderately long, strongly rounded tail, are peculiar characters. The\r\ncolouration is unique. Only one species is known. {64}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MASCARINUS MASCARINUS (L.)\r\n\r\n                            MASCARINE PARROT.\r\n\r\n                               (PLATE 9.)\r\n\r\n    \"_Perroquets un peu plus gros que pigeons, ayant le plumage de couleur\r\n    de petit gris, un chaperon noir sur la teste, le becq fort gros, &\r\n    couleur de feu_\" Le Sieur D.B, (Dubois), Voyages aux Iles Dauphine ou\r\n    Madagascar, et Bourbon ou Mascarenne. p. 172 (1674--\"Bourbon ou\r\n    Mascarenne\").\r\n\r\n    _Psittacus Mascarinus_ Brisson, Orn.

Linnaeus in 1771 (see above) was the first to bestow a\r\nscientific name on it, though Brisson had already again described it in\r\n1760. Linnaeus' diagnosis is, as usual, rather poor, and not quite\r\ncorrect[1], but his reference to Brisson leaves no doubt as to what he\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\nThis parrot is one of the rarest of extinct birds, only two stuffed\r\nspecimens being known. One normally coloured specimen is preserved in the\r\nMuseum of Natural History in Paris, and it is evidently this which has been\r\nfigured by Daubenton and Levaillant, and in the \"Centenaire du Muséum\r\nd'Historie Naturelle.\" From the latter plate my figure has been taken.\r\n\r\nThe example in Vienna is unfortunately semi-albinistic, there being some\r\nwhite feathers on the back, wings and tail. Another normal individual,\r\nhowever, lived formerly in the Menagerie of the King of Bavaria, where it\r\nwas depicted by Hahn in 1835.

Bill black.\"\r\n\r\nThe specimen was sent in spirits to Sir Edward Newton in 1871 by Mr.\r\nJenner, the Magistrate of Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nThe male differs from the female in having the upper mandible crimson,\r\nfading into horn at the tip. Top of head more glaucous. Black stripe from\r\nnostril to eye. Black chin stripe prolonged almost to meet on nape of neck.\r\nMost of primaries with dull black patch on inner webs.

It was\r\nfirst asserted that it occurred on both Bourbon and Mauritius. Then\r\nProfessor Newton separated the Mauritius bird as _Pal. echo_. Salvadori,\r\nhowever, in Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. XX, p. 442, reunited the Bourbon and\r\nMauritius birds, while quite unaccountably stating only Mauritius as the\r\nhabitat.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Dubois describes this bird as follows: \"Green Parrots as large as\r\npigeons having a black collar.\"\r\n\r\nNow the species of _Palaeornis_ from Rodriguez, the Seychelles, and the\r\nmainland of Africa are all distinct, and the other land birds of Mauritius\r\nare and were different from those of Bourbon. I therefore feel quite\r\ncertain that Professor Newton is right, and that his _Palaeornis echo_ is\r\ndistinct from _P. eques_, though, unfortunately, we do not know in which\r\nway the two forms differed.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Bourbon or Réunion, but now extinct.

Milne-Edwards'\r\ndescription of this tibio-tarsus is that it equals in length that bone in\r\n_Asio accipitrinus_, but was distinguished from the latter by the strong\r\ninward curvature and the great development in width of its distal\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\n  _Tibio-tarsus._\r\n\r\n  Total length                                 77   mm.\r\n  Length from the proximal extremity to the\r\n    top of the peronial ridge                  25   \"\r\n  Width at distal extremity                    10.5 \"\r\n  Width at proximal extremity                   9   \"\r\n  Width of shaft                                3.7 \"\r\n\r\nHabitat: Rodriguez.\r\n\r\n{73}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SCOPS COMMERSONI OUST.\r\n\r\n    _Scops commersoni_ Oustalet, Ann. Sci. Nat. (8) III, p. 35 fig. 3\r\n    (1896).\r\n\r\nThis owl, I believe, is not a true _Scops_, being much too big, but we must\r\nleave it in that genus for the present, as there are no specimens or bones\r\nextant, and only Jossigny's drawing to guide us as to its appearance. The\r\nfirst mention of owls on Mauritius was in the year 1606, when Admiral\r\nMatlief says that owls were common in the Island. Monsieur Desjardins, in\r\n1837, gave the first accurate description of the bird, of which I here\r\nreproduce the translation. \"The digits and even the tarsi are not\r\nfeathered, only on the front portion of these latter one sees some short,\r\nstiff feathers running down to a point nearly to the centre. The digits are\r\nvery strong, they being armed with hooked nails.\r\n\r\nThe beak is very stout, arched from its base; the upper mandible, which is\r\nmuch longer than the other and covering it, is as if cut square at the\r\npoint. The nostrils pierce the bill pretty high up in the horny portion.\r\nThe eyes, of which I could not see the colour, are round, and placed, like\r\nin the entire family, in front. They are surrounded by a circle or disc of\r\nstiff, thread-like feathers, which is interrupted at the sides. A sort of\r\ncollar is perceptible on the throat. Two tufts, similar to those of the\r\nEagle Owls and Eared Owls, and very apparent, are behind the eyes and\r\ntowards the top of the occiput.\r\n\r\nThe wings are a little longer than the tail, the fourth and fifth primaries\r\nbeing the longest, the third and sixth are shorter, and the second still\r\nshorter, being equal to the eighth, and the first is shortest of all. The\r\ntail reaches to the end of the digits; it is rounded and not much\r\nlengthened: all the retrices are equal in length. The ear-tufts are brown,\r\nwith some slight buff shading, the discal plumes being white marked with\r\nbuff. All the upper side is of a dark brown colour, the feathers of the\r\nhead, the neck and the back are edged with rufous, but not very distinctly\r\nso; this rufous colour is more apparent on the scapulars, and some of these\r\neven have on the outer web one or two whitish patches surrounded with\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nThe large tail feathers are less brown and more rufous in colour, with\r\nlighter rufous marbling mixed with brown.\r\n\r\nThe tertials and secondaries have a darker brown bar towards the centre,\r\nand their outer web is pleasantly marked with somewhat square ocelli or\r\nirregular bands of white, pale buff, and brown. The large primaries or {74}\r\nflight feathers present the same ornamentation, but more strongly\r\ndeveloped, and the blotches are buffy white on the inner web, which\r\nproduces a regular spotting on a brown ground colour; the tip of these\r\nlarge feathers is finely stippled with brown on a fairly pale ground; and\r\nthere is a large patch of white on the wings in addition.\r\n\r\nThe throat and abdomen are nicely adorned with dark buff feathers, which\r\nhave a black brown centre and two to four large round white spots. The\r\nlarge feathers on the flanks are whitish, with a brown shaft line and\r\nmarked with buff. All the well feathered parts, underneath the feathers are\r\ncovered by a very thick black down.\"\r\n\r\nThe colour of bill and feet is reddish brown. Total length, 13½ inches =\r\n345 mm. Desjardins says the specimen he described was killed at the end of\r\nOctober, 1836, in the forest crowning the hills close to \"Bamboo Creek.\" In\r\n1837 several were still seen near \"La Savane,\" and one was killed at\r\nCurepipe by Dr. Dobson of the 99th Regiment. This latter is believed to\r\nhave been one of, if not the last of this species, so we have to thank that\r\nexcellent naturalist, Desjardins, and Monsieur Jossigny, the companion of\r\nCommerson, that we know what this extinct species was like.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Mauritius.\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ATHENE MURIVORA MILNE-EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n    _Strix (Athene) murivora_ Milne-Edwards, Ann. Sci. Nat. (5) XIX p. 13\r\n    (Art. 3.) (1874).\r\n\r\nProfessor Milne-Edwards described this bird from a tibio-tarsus and a\r\ntarso-metatarsus collected in Rodriguez by Sir Edward Newton, and says that\r\nhe considers it to belong to the genus _Athene_, because the proportions of\r\nthe tibio-tarsus and tarso-metatarsus agree with those of that genus. The\r\nmost remarkable specific characters appear to be that the ridge to which\r\nthe fibula is articulated is stout, and extends very far along the outer\r\nedge of the bone. The diaphysis is large and nearly straight; the distal\r\nextremity is furnished with two equal condyles separated by a deep channel.\r\n\r\n  _Tibio-tarsus._\r\n\r\n  Total length                                  71 mm.\r\n  Length from proximal extremity to end of\r\n    peronial ridge                              25 \"\r\n  Width of distal extremity                     10 \"\r\n  Width of proximal extremity                    9 \"\r\n  Width of shaft                                 4 \"\r\n\r\n  _Tarso-metatarsus._\r\n\r\n  Total length                                  46 mm.\r\n  Width at proximal extremity                   10 \"\r\n  Width at distal extremity                     15 \"\r\n  Width of shaft                                 5 \"\r\n\r\nHabitat: Rodriguez.\r\n\r\n{77}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SCELOGLAUX RUFIFACIES BULLER.\r\n\r\n    _Sceloglaux rufifacies_ Buller, Ibis 1904, p. 639; id. Suppl. B. New\r\n    Zealand II, p. 65, pl. VII (1906).\r\n\r\nOriginal description: \"Adult female: Similar to _Sceloglaux albifacies_,\r\nbut appreciably smaller; face dull rufous brown, instead of being white;\r\ncrown and nape blackish brown; entire upper surface strongly suffused with\r\nrufous; quills marked with regular transverse bars and a terminal edging of\r\nrufous brown; tail-feathers uniform yellowish brown, obscurely barred with\r\npale brown; bill lemon-yellow; feet dull yellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wairarapa district, near Wellington, North Island, in the summer 1868-9.\"\r\n\r\nThis supposed \"species\" is a very doubtful one. A close examination in the\r\nTring Museum of the type (which was offered me for such a high price that I\r\ndid not feel justified in buying it, fond as I am of possessing extinct\r\nforms, types and varieties) by Messrs. Hartert, Hellmayr and myself proved\r\nbeyond doubt to all three of us that the specimen was not fully adult, but\r\nshowed signs of immaturity. If I said to Sir Walter Buller that it was an\r\nextremely young, hardly fledged _Sceloglaux_ this was certainly incorrect,\r\nand was perhaps just an exclamation after a hasty preliminary examination,\r\nfor the bird is of course fully fledged and has passed, at least partially,\r\nthrough one moult of the feathers. On the other hand, both Professor\r\nNewton's and Dr. Sharpe's reputed statements that the owl in question is\r\nfully adult are not correct. It certainly shows unmistakable signs of\r\nimmaturity, as noticed at once by Dr. Gadow (cf. Newton's letter on p. 66,\r\nl.c.), by Hartert, Hellmayr and myself. Moreover Professor Newton--though\r\nBuller says he \"pronounced it to be an adult bird\"--also admits that the\r\nbird \"had moulted, though not necessarily to be in adult plumage,\" and he\r\ncontinues that he thinks the character of the markings continues to be\r\njuvenile.\r\n\r\nHaving thus discussed the age of this owl, the question must be considered\r\nif it is different from _S. albifacies_ from the South Island. This is less\r\neasily done. Buller described it as a \"new species,\" and mentions among the\r\ndistinctive characters (see above) the colour of the tail. The tail,\r\nhowever, is \"skillfully\" (as Buller calls it, though I should use a less\r\ncomplimentary adverb) stuck in, and does not belong to a _Sceloglaux_, but\r\nto an Australian _Ninox_, and also some feathers on the neck are foreign.\r\nThe wings being abraded, its slightly smaller length is not very\r\nsignificant. Certainly, however, the colouration in general is slightly\r\nmore rufous than {78} in _S. albifacies_, though some of my specimens\r\napproach it almost completely, and the face is more rufescent. Professor\r\nNewton cautiously warned Sir Walter Buller, suggesting that _S. albifacies_\r\nmight possibly have a red \"phase,\" like _Syrnium aluco_, and this North\r\nIsland specimen represented the latter. As for myself, I do not think that\r\n_S. albifacies_ has two phases, as I have seen too many specimens, and\r\nfound them to vary but little. I have now in my collection eight specimens\r\nfrom the South Island. On the other hand, I have not seen juvenile\r\nexamples; but it is very likely that the rufous face of the North Island\r\nspecimen is a character peculiar to the North Island form, which would then\r\nbe a sub-species of _S. albifacies_ from the South Island, and should be\r\ncalled _S. albifacies rufifacies_. The type from Wairapara is said to have\r\nbeen killed in the summer of 1868-9, and, since no further evidence of its\r\nexistence has come forth, I presume that the North Island race of this owl\r\nmust be extinct by this time.\r\n\r\n{79}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         STRIX NEWTONI NOM.

Newton and Gadow give the measurements of, and describe a pair of\r\nmetatarsi procured with the remains described as _Strix sauzieri_, and\r\nstate that they do not fit in with that species. For, as they are fully\r\nadult bones, it is impossible to attribute their much smaller size to\r\nyouth. They then add a sentence of which this is the first part: \"Unless we\r\nassume, what is unlikely, that the Island of Mauritius possessed two\r\ndifferent species of _Strix_, we have to conclude that the short pair of\r\nmetatarsals belonged to a small individual of _Strix sauzieri_, ----.\"\r\nEvidently Messrs. Gadow and Newton, when they wrote this, did not remember\r\nthe fact that throughout a very large portion of the range of _Strix\r\nflammea_, its various geographical races are found side by side with\r\nanother species of the group of _Strix_, namely, _S. candida_ and _S.\r\ncapensis_, popularly called \"_Grass owls_\"; these in nearly every case have\r\nthe legs considerably longer than in the true _Barn Owls_ (_Strix flammea_\r\nand its races).\r\n\r\nTherefore I consider it not in the least unlikely that two species of\r\n_Strix_ inhabited Mauritius, and that _Strix sauzieri_ was the Mauritian\r\nrepresentative of the \"Grass Owls,\" while these two short metatarsals\r\nbelonged to the representative of the \"Barn Owls.\" I therefore have much\r\npleasure in naming this form after the collector of these bones, the late\r\nSir Edward Newton.\r\n\r\nLength of tarso-metatarsi, 56 mm.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Mauritius. {80}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       STRIX SAUZIERI NEWT. & GAD.\r\n\r\n    _Strix sauzieri_ Newton & Gadow, Trans.

In the present instance this comparison indicates a\r\nspecies of _Strix_.\r\n\r\nThe longer and higher cnemial process of the tibia and the shortness of the\r\nhumerus serve amply to justify the specific separation of this Mauritian\r\nowl.\r\n\r\nThe following are the measurements:--\r\n\r\n  Humerus, length                71 mm.\r\n  Tibia-tarsus, length        90-93 \"\r\n  Tarso-metatarsus, length    63-66 \"\r\n\r\nHabitat: Mauritius.\r\n\r\n{81}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \"CIRCUS HAMILTONI\" FORBES.\r\n\r\n    _Circus hamiltoni_ Forbes, Trans.

They justified their description of this\r\ngoshawk as a distinct species, first of all by the fact that most of the\r\nMascarene extinct species were distinct; and then because the bony ridge\r\nfor the _M. flexor digitorum communis_ was more strongly developed, the\r\nfibula reached further down the tibia, the peroneal crest was straighter\r\nand longer, and the cnemial crest slanted more gradually into the anterior\r\ninner edge of the shaft of the tibia.\r\n\r\nMilne-Edwards gives the measurements of the solitary tarso-metatarsus of\r\nthis bird which he had for examination as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Total length                          80 mm.\r\n  Width at proximal extremity           11 \"\r\n  Width at distal extremity             13 \"\r\n  Width at smallest part of shaft        6 \"\r\n\r\nMessrs.

Of the shape of the former (sc. Cormorants), which it also resembles\r\nin the white patches on the flanks. The body is entirely black. A few long,\r\nwhite, narrow pendant plumes round the neck, as in Herons. Occiput with a\r\nhuge tuft, doubly crested. Skin round the base of the bill bare, red, blue\r\nand white, mixed, as in a turkey. Round the eyes a thick, bare white patch\r\nof skin, about six lines wide, like a pair of spectacles. Weight 12 to 14\r\npounds. Female smaller, without crest and spectacles. (From Steller.)\"\r\n\r\nSteller, who was shipwrecked on Bering Island in 1741, was the discoverer\r\nof _C. perspicillatus_, and Pallas took his diagnosis from Steller's notes.\r\n\r\nThe Spectacled or Pallas's Cormorant is one of the rarest of all birds. It\r\nis generally said that four specimens are known, but five are really in\r\nexistence: Two in the St. Petersburg Museum, one in Leyden, and two in\r\nLondon. One of these latter is perfect, while the other has no tail.\r\nProbably all five have been obtained by Kuprianoff, the Russian Governor at\r\nSitka, who, in 1839, gave one to Captain Belcher, and sent some others to\r\nSt. Petersburg. The careful researches of Stejneger and others on Bering\r\nIsland have clearly shown that this Cormorant exists no longer. Formerly it\r\nis said to have been numerous, but the natives were fond of its flesh,\r\nwhich formed their principal diet when other meat was difficult to obtain.\r\nProbably it would not so soon have become extinct if it had not been that\r\ntheir rather short wings resulted in a certain slowness of locomotion on\r\nland and in the air. A good description is given in the Catalogue of Birds,\r\nand a still more detailed one by Stejneger (Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus. 1899, p.\r\n86) from Brandt's manuscript.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Bering Island. {88}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CARBO MAJOR (FORBES).\r\n\r\n    _Phalacrocorax novaezealandiae var. major_ Forbes, Trans.

Of course,\r\nhis line of comparison was strengthened by the fact of subfossil bones of\r\n_Plotus nanus_ occurring both in Mauritius and Madagascar; but it does not\r\nfollow that because in one family of birds the same species occurred in two\r\nplaces the others must do likewise, and, therefore, one must not\r\nnecessarily regard a certain similarity of osteological characters as proof\r\nof identity.

VIII.\r\n\r\nThis species was discovered by Dr. Forsyth Major and Monsieur Robert in the\r\nbed of an old lake at Sirabé, Central Madagascar, in 1896-1897. It was\r\nsimilar in many respects to _Sarcidiornis_ and _Chenalopex_ but differed in\r\nits large size and the great length of its legs. Indeed, judging from the\r\nslenderness of the metatarsus and femur and the slight degree of inflection\r\nof the lower end of the long tibia, it seems probable that this bird was\r\nill adapted for swimming, though a good runner. The wings were long and\r\npowerful and armed with a long spur.

Zool. Soc. XIII, p.\r\n    290, pl. XXXIV, figs. 9-10.\r\n\r\nThe evidence on which this species is founded is a single left metacarpal\r\nand an incomplete left half of the pelvis. Its specific character is the\r\nvery large size as compared to the two existing species.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Mauritius.\r\n\r\nIn an old work entitled \"Memorandums concerning India\" by J. Marshall\r\n(1668) in the article on the Island of Mauritius, there occurs this\r\npassage: \"They are many Geese; the halfe of their wings towards the end are\r\nblack and the other halfe white; they are not large, but fat and good.\r\nPlenty of Ducks.\" As there is no mention of the caruncle on the bill here\r\nor in other authors alluding to geese in Mauritius, Oustalet doubted that\r\nthese geese were this _Sarcidiornis_, but I believe this merely to have\r\nbeen an oversight of Marshall's and that his description goes far to prove\r\nthe distinctness of Newton and Gadow's species.\r\n\r\nThe allusion to the small size also points to the geese of Marshall being\r\nthe _Sarcidiornis_. L'Abbé Dubois in \"Les Voyages du Sieur D.B.\" records\r\nthe fact that on Bourbon were some wild geese slightly smaller than the\r\ngeese of Europe but having the same plumage. Their bill and feet were red.\r\nIt is also probable that wild geese were found on Rodriguez. There is\r\nnothing to show what these Bourbon geese were, and as no osseous remains of\r\nsuch birds have been found as yet it is impossible to do more than mention\r\nthe fact of such birds having been recorded.\r\n\r\n{103}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ANAS FINSCHI VAN BENEDEN.\r\n\r\n    _Anas finschi_ Van Beneden, Journ.

Clavicle and coracoid\r\nresemble those of _Fuligula marila_. Humerus larger and stronger than in\r\n_F. marila_ and _C. clangula_, as are the femur, tibio-tarsus and\r\ntarso-metatarsus, which are almost double as long and thick.\r\n\r\nJudging from the shape of its leg-bones this bird must have been a strong\r\nrunner, and probably at the same time was a poor flyer.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Middle Island, New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ANAS THEODORI NEWT. & GAD.\r\n\r\n    _Anas theodori_ Newton & Gadow, Trans. Zool. Soc. XIII, p. 291, pl.\r\n    XXXIV, figs 11-17 (1893--Mauritius).\r\n\r\nMessrs. Newton and Gadow founded this species on a fragment of a sternum, a\r\npair of coracoids, eight humeri, and a pair of tarso-metatarsi. These are\r\nreferable to a duck of larger size than _Nettion bernieri_, and somewhat\r\nintermediate between _N. punctata_ and _Anas melleri_.\r\n\r\nThe sternum differs from that of _A. melleri_ by the lesser height of the\r\nkeel and by the shape and direction of the anterior margin of the latter.\r\nThe coracoid is longer and larger than in _N. bernieri_, but is much\r\nshorter than in _A. melleri_, though agreeing with that of the latter in\r\nshape, and by the plain almost ridgeless ventral surface of the shaft. The\r\nseven humeri vary in length from 70-78 mm., and agree in size with those of\r\n_N. punctata_, thus proving our species to be smaller than _A. melleri_.\r\n\r\nThe two tarso-metatarsi are in poor condition; the right one measuring 42\r\nmm. in length, thus indicating that _A. theodori_ was a bird with a shorter\r\nfoot than _A. melleri_.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Mauritius.\r\n\r\n{105}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CAMPTOLAIMUS LABRADORIA (GM.)\r\n\r\n                               (PLATE 36.)\r\n\r\n    _Anas labradoria_ Gmelin, Syst.

Though first\r\ntechnically named by Gmelin in 1788, this duck was first described in 1785\r\nby Pennant, in the Arctic Zoology II, p. 559, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Pied Duck. With the lower part of the bill black, the upper yellow, on the\r\nsummit of the head is an oblong black spot; forehead, cheeks, rest of the\r\nhead and neck, white; the lower part encircled with black; scapulars and\r\ncoverts of wings white; back, breast, belly, and primaries, black; tail\r\ncuneiform, and dusky; legs black. The bill of the supposed female?\r\nresembles that of the male, head and neck mottled with cinereous brown and\r\ndirty white; primaries dusky; speculum white; back, breast, and belly\r\nclouded with different shades of ash-colour; tail dusky and cuneiform; legs\r\nblack. Size of a common Wild Duck.\r\n\r\n\"Sent from Connecticut, to Mrs. Blackburn. Possibly the great flocks of\r\npretty Pied Ducks, which whistled as they flew, or as they fed, seen by Mr.\r\nLawson in the western branch of Cape Fear inlet, were of this kind.\"\r\n\r\nThe Labrador-Duck is one of those birds, the disappearance of which is not\r\neasily explained. As Mr. Dutcher truly said, \"we can speculate as to the\r\ncause of its disappearance, but we have no facts to warrant a conclusion.\"\r\nFormerly _Camptolaimus_ was of regular occurrence along the northern\r\nAtlantic shores of North America, in winter south to New Jersey and New\r\nYork. It has often been sold on the markets of New York and Baltimore, and\r\nnobody anticipated even fifty years ago that they might become extinct, but\r\nthey {106} appear never to have been very numerous, at least we have no\r\nproof of this. It is true that Professor Newton tells us that this duck\r\nused to breed on rocky islets, and that \"its fate is easily understood,\"\r\nsince \"man began yearly to visit its breeding haunts, and, not content in\r\nplundering its nests, mercilessly to shoot the birds.\" This, however, seems\r\nto be mere conjecture, as we do not know for certain where the breeding\r\nhaunts of this Duck have been, and that anyone has ever visited them. All\r\ninformation known about the breeding of this bird is that of Audubon, who\r\nsays that his son was shown empty nests on the top of bushes, which a clerk\r\nof the fishing establishment told him were those of the Labrador Duck. This\r\ninformation is certainly too uncertain to draw any conclusions from, but\r\nthe breeding places might just as well have been much further to the north,\r\nand probably were.\r\n\r\n  The number of specimens extant is 48.\r\n\r\n    Amiens, Town Museum: 1 [male] ad.

G. Bell in 1879, for the Smithsonian Institution, which is\r\nsaid to have been shot in 1875, but this date seems not quite certain (Cf.\r\nAuk, 1894, p. 9). That several other specimens were shot later than 1852 is\r\nperfectly certain. As the specimen of 1875, or thereabouts, is a young\r\nmale, Mr. Lawrence's question about the old birds is certainly justified.\r\nAs, however, no Labrador Duck has been recorded later than 1871 or 1875 we\r\nmay suppose that it is now extinct.\r\n\r\nMy young male was bought in the Fulton Market, New York, about 1860, and\r\nprobably came from Long Island. It was mounted by John Bell, a\r\nbird-stuffer, through whose hands several Labrador Ducks have gone, and is\r\nin the finest possible condition. I bought this bird from the late Gordon\r\nPlummer, shortly before his death. He died at his home in Brookline, Mass.,\r\nin November, 1893. (Cf. Auk, 1891, p. 206.)\r\n\r\nMy adult male is the one of which the history is given in Auk, 1894, p.\r\n176. It is described there in detail and then added: \"Shot in the bay of\r\nLaprairie this spring (1862) by a habitant, and purchased by Mr. Thompson\r\nof this city, who has kindly placed it at my disposal for examination.\" Mr.\r\nWilliam Dutcher of New York City bought this specimen from the widow of the\r\nMr. Thompson, mentioned in the above note as the original owner, and I\r\npurchased it from Mr. William Dutcher, who informs me that \"the Bay of\r\nLaprairie\" is simply a name given to a wide part of the River St. Lawrence,\r\njust south of Montreal, Quebec. The name is found on good maps of Quebec.\r\n\r\n{109}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \"BIZIURA LAUTOURI\" FORBES.\r\n\r\n    _Biziura lautouri_ Forbes, Trans. N.Z. Inst. XXIV, p. 188 (1892--nomen\r\n    nudum).\r\n\r\nDr. Forbes, unfortunately, gives no description whatever of this bird. It\r\nwould be interesting to know something about it, and especially if its\r\npowers of flight were impaired, as it seems to have been the case in so\r\nmany extinct birds.\r\n\r\n{111}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ARDEA MEGACEPHALA MILNE-EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n    _Butors Leguat_, Relation du Voyage (1708).\r\n\r\n    _Ardea megacephala_ Milne-Edwards, Ann. Sci. Nat. (5) XIX, 1874, p. 10.\r\n\r\nLeguat's description, here translated, is as follows:--\"We had Bitterns as\r\nbig and as fat as capons. They are tamer and more easily caught than the\r\n'gelinotes.'\" He also says, \"The lizards often serve as prey for the birds,\r\nespecially for the Bitterns. When we shook them down from the branches with\r\na pole, these birds ran up and gobbled them down in front of us, in spite\r\nof all we could do to prevent them; and even if we only pretended to do so\r\nthey came in the same manner and always followed us about.\"\r\n\r\nMilne-Edwards remarks, among other notes, that \"This bird is not a true\r\nBittern, but its head is so large and its feet so short that it is easy to\r\nunderstand that Leguat should have called it so.\"\r\n\r\nThe bony structure of the head is remarkable on account of its massive and\r\nthick proportions; the skull itself is strongly enlarged posteriorly, and\r\nthe temporal fossae are bordered by very pronounced ridges, especially\r\nthose on the occipital region. The upper side of the skull is hardly\r\nconvex, and the interorbital region is large, but only slightly depressed\r\nalong its middle line. The bill is stout, almost straight, a good deal\r\nenlarged at its base and rounded beneath. The nostrils are large and\r\npreceded by a large groove, which extends very far towards the tip.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to confound this skull with that of any Bittern, the\r\nlatter having the beak relatively slender and only barely exceeding the\r\nskull in length. These also have the skull much constricted at the temporal\r\nregion. The fossil skull from Rodriguez therefore presents characters\r\nessentially those of a Heron, but differs from all known species in its\r\nmassive appearance. In the Grey, Purple and Goliath Herons, as well as in\r\nthe Egrettes, the head is narrower, more elongated, the bill less conical\r\nand less strong. In _Ardea atricollis_, now inhabiting Madagascar, the beak\r\nmuch resembles that of our extinct species, but it is longer and less\r\nenlarged at the base. The interorbital area is much wider, while on the\r\nother hand the hinder portion of the skull is narrower and more elongated,\r\nwhich gives to the skull a totally different aspect.\r\n\r\nThe feet relatively to the head are extremely short, and from this I\r\nconclude that we know no species of Heron which can be compared to that of\r\nRodriguez. Nevertheless, the tarso-metatarsus presents all the characters\r\n{112} of _Ardea_, and is far removed from that of _Botaurus_. The tibia is\r\nbig and short; it surpasses in length the tarso-metatarsus by about a\r\nthird, as is usual in the Herons; but the femur on the contrary is strongly\r\ndeveloped, being quite as large as in the _Ardea cinerea_; which shows us\r\nthat the body of this creature was of large size, and that the reduction in\r\nsize of the feet had only taken place at their extremities.\r\n\r\nThe sternum is puny and small as compared with the creature's size. It is\r\nclearly that of a bird not furnished with powerful wings, and is even much\r\nless elongated than in the Bittern, but the coracoidal bones are very long\r\nand slender. The wings also were short and feeble, the humerus being hardly\r\nas big as in _Butorides atricapilla_. It is conspicuously slenderer and\r\nshorter than in the Bittern. The main body of the bone is slightly curved\r\non the outside, and the lower articular condyle is large and flattened.

Sci. Nat. (6) II p. 133 et seq. 1875) about the year 1830 mentions\r\nthis bird as follows:--\"There are not a few Bitterns which are birds which\r\nonly fly a very little, and run uncommonly well when they are chased. They\r\nare of the size of an Egret and something like them.\"\r\n\r\nHabitat: Rodriguez Island.\r\n\r\n2 Humeri, 2 Femora, 2 Tibiae, and 2 Metatarsi in the Tring Museum. {114}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ARDEA DUBOISI NOM.

They have grey\r\nplumage, each feather spotted with white, the neck and beak like a Heron,\r\nand the feet green, made like the feet of Poullets d'Inde (_Porphyrio_,\r\nW.R.). This bird lives on fish.\"\r\n\r\nHabitat: Réunion or Bourbon. {115}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ARDEA MAURITIANA (NEWT. & GAD.)\r\n\r\n    _Butorides mauritianus_ Newton & Gadow, Trans. Zool. Soc. vol. XIII, p.\r\n    289 (1893).\r\n\r\nThe bones on which this species is founded are a pair of ulnae, one radius,\r\nfour metatarsi, and one coracoid. The description is as follows:--\"The\r\nbones in question are all considerably shorter than the corresponding bones\r\nof _A. (Nycticorax) megacephala_. The metatarsi agree otherwise in every\r\ndetail with those of the latter species; this relative stoutness indicates\r\nthat they belonged to a Night-Heron or Bittern like _A. megacephala_. The\r\ntwo ulnae cannot, unfortunately, be compared with those of _A.\r\nmegacephala_; their length, 110 mm., compared with the length of the\r\nhumerus of _A. megacephala_, 119 mm., shows, however, likewise that they\r\nwere those of a considerably smaller bird. The single left coracoid agrees\r\nin all the features of its dorsal or scapular half with _A. megacephala_,\r\nbut its ventral or sternal half differs considerably, first by the much\r\nmore strongly marked ridge of the _linea intermuscularis_ on its ventral\r\nsurface, secondly by the almost straight instead of inwardly curved margin\r\nbetween the _processus lateralis_ and the lateral distal corner of the\r\nsternal articulation, thirdly by a very low but very distinct and sharp\r\nridge, which arises from the median margin of the coracoid, a little above\r\nits median articulating corner. This roughness or prominent ridge is\r\nentirely absent in _A. megacephala_ and in all other Herons which we have\r\nbeen able to examine, but at least a slight indication of it occurs in an\r\nindividually varying degree in _Nycticorax_ and _Botaurus_. That this\r\ncoracoid bone belonged, however, to an Ardeine bird is clearly indicated by\r\nits whole configuration, notably by the shape and position of the\r\nprecoracoid process, the various articulating facets at the dorsal end, and\r\nthe prominent lip on the visceral or internal surface of the median portion\r\nof the sternal articulating facet.\"\r\n\r\nThe following are the measurements:--\r\n\r\n  Length of ulna            111-112 mm.\r\n  Length of metatarsus       81- 87 \"\r\n  Length of coracoid             48 \"\r\n\r\nHabitat: Mauritius.\r\n\r\nAlthough _megacephala_ and _mauritiana_ have been placed in _Ardea_ and\r\n_Butorides_ respectively, from the short, stout legs and general build, I\r\nam inclined to think that all three of these Herons belong to the genus\r\n_Nycticorax_.\r\n\r\n{117}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PROSOBONIA BP.\r\n\r\nThis genus is, in the Catalogue of Birds, placed in a section with somewhat\r\nlong tarsus, the latter being longer than the culmen, containing in\r\naddition to _Prosobonia_ the genera _Tringites_, and _Aechmorhynchus_ (see\r\nafterwards), and it differs from the latter by its long hind toe, from the\r\nformer by its square tail. The position of this singular bird is, however,\r\nnot quite certain. The late Henry Seebohm placed it in the genus\r\n_Phegornis_, though the latter has no hind toe whatever, and it has\r\neven--but doubtless wrongly--been suggested that it belonged to the\r\n_Rallidae_, rather than to the _Charadriidae_. We know only one species. It\r\nis true that Dr. Sharpe bestowed a new name on the figure of Ellis, which\r\nis said to have been taken from an Eimeo-specimen, but it is hardly\r\ncreditable that it belongs to a different species. Latham appears to have\r\nhad three specimens, which were all three different from each other. Both\r\nForster and Ellis, in their unpublished drawings in the British Museum, as\r\nwell as Latham, evidently considered all three to belong to the same\r\nspecies, and it is not advisable now to over-rule their verdict, given with\r\nthe specimens before them, merely on account of the different plumages,\r\nsince we all know that most waders, and especially brightly-coloured ones,\r\ndiffer considerably in plumage, according to age and seasons. We are\r\nconvinced that \"_P. ellisi_\" has been a younger bird. Sharpe attaches\r\nimportance to the different habitat, but this is no argument in this\r\ninstance, because Eimeo is, at the nearest point, not more than seven and a\r\nhalf miles from Tahiti,[2] and it is quite against all precedents among\r\n_Charadriidae_ and beyond all plausibility that two such closely situated\r\nislands have closely allied forms of a Wader.\r\n\r\n{118}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PROSOBONIA LEUCOPTERA (GM.)\r\n\r\n                               (PLATE 35.)\r\n\r\n    _White-winged Sandpiper_ Latham, Gen.

Tarsi moderate, shorter\r\nthan the middle toe, flattened in front, and covered with transverse\r\nscales; toes long and slender, inner nearly as long as the outer, hind toe\r\nshort, very slender, and placed on the inner side of the tarsus; claws\r\nshort, compressed, blunt.\r\n\r\n\"The bird is incapable of flight, and the stomach of the specimen,\r\ndissected by Dr. Knox, contained only the legs and elytra of beetles.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Hutton also adds, l.c., a valuable description of the skeleton.\r\n\r\nOne species known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CABALUS MODESTUS (HUTTON).\r\n\r\n                               (PLATE 28.)\r\n\r\n    _Rallus modestus_ Hutton, Ibis 1872, p. 247.

Sir Walter Buller afterwards (B. New Zealand, Ed. I, pp.\r\n179, 180) declared \"after carefully comparing it with the type of _Rallus\r\ndieffenbachii_, and submitting the matter to the judgment of other\r\ncompetent ornithologists, I have no hesitation in considering it the same\r\nspecies, in an immature state of plumage.\" (_Sic!_) Unfortunately, Dr.\r\nSharpe, in the Catalogue of Birds XXIII, repeated Buller's error, and, on\r\nPlate VI, figured _Cabalus modestus_ under the name of _Cabalus\r\ndieffenbachii_, though the latter is not congeneric with _C. modestus_, and\r\nmust be called _Nesolimnas dieffenbachii_, while the third form included in\r\n_Cabalus_ by Dr. Sharpe, viz. _sylvestris_ of Lord Howe's Island, must also\r\nbe separated genetically from _Cabalus_.\r\n\r\nFormerly _Cabalus modestus_ inhabited Great Chatham Island, as Dr. Forbes\r\nproved by bones found by himself at Warekauri, but when the species was\r\ndiscovered it existed there no more, though being plentiful on the little\r\noutlying island of Mangare. Unfortunately even there it is evidently\r\nextinct now, this island being overrun with cats and rats, besides which,\r\naccording to Buller, the original vegetation has been ruthlessly burnt down\r\nfor the purpose of sowing grass-seed, as even this bleak little island has\r\nbeen claimed by an enterprising sheep-farmer. Fortunately a good many\r\nspecimens have been secured by the late W. Hawkins. I have fifteen in my\r\nmuseum, and there are specimens in the British Museum, in Liverpool, and\r\none in Cambridge. Henry Palmer failed to get specimens when he visited\r\nMangare.\r\n\r\nI have also the egg described and figured in the Ibis by Dr. Forbes. It\r\nmeasures 40 by 21.4 mm., and is creamy white, with faint pale reddish and\r\npurplish roundish spots.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Chatham Islands, east of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n{129}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        OCYDROMUS MINOR HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n    _Ocydromus sp._ Hamilton, Trans.

B.O.C.I. p. XXI, 1893.\r\n\r\nThe remains of this bird were first sent to Dr. H. O. Forbes in 1892 by the\r\nlate W. Hawkins, from the Chatham Islands, 500 miles E.S.E. of New Zealand.\r\nIt appears to have been confined to the Island of Wharekauri. Dr. Forbes\r\nsubsequently went to the Chathams himself and collected a large number of\r\nbones of various extinct birds, including those of _Diaphorapteryx_. In\r\n1895 I received a consignment of bones through the agency of Mr.\r\nDannefaerd, from the Chathams, such as has never been equalled from any\r\ndeposit elsewhere, for literally there were many hundreds of thousands of\r\nbones of a considerable number of species of birds. From this collection\r\nMr. C. W. Andrews was able to draw up a most minute description of the\r\nskeleton of _Diaphorapteryx_, founded on several practically complete\r\nskeletons, some thirty or more skulls, and several thousand individual\r\nbones of various portions of the skeleton. This description, published in\r\nNovitates Zoologicae, Vol. III, pp. 73-84, is too long for reproduction\r\nhere, and so I must refer my readers to it.\r\n\r\nThis bird, as well as the _Palaeolimnas_, shows an apparent relationship\r\nbetween the Chatham Islands and the Mascarene Islands; but I believe that\r\n{134} this is not a real relationship, as has been asserted, due to a\r\nformer land-connection, but merely a case of parallel development owing to\r\nsimilar conditions of existence.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Wharekauri Island, Chatham Islands.\r\n\r\nIn the Tring Museum are two complete skeletons, more than a thousand bones,\r\nand about fifteen skulls.\r\n\r\nOne almost complete skeleton, and the type, skull, and bones, are in the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n{135}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ERYTHROMACHUS MILNE-EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n\"Legs stout, made for running, and from a quarter to one-fifth shorter than\r\nin _Ocydromus_, the three anterior digits well developed and the hallux\r\nvery small.

There are several references to \"_Hens_,\" \"_Veld\r\nHoenders_,\" &c., but all appear to refer to the Mauritius bird\r\n_Aphanapteryx bonasia_. Leguat's description is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Our 'gelinotes' are fat all the year round and of a most delicate taste.\r\nTheir colour is always of a bright grey, and there is very little\r\ndifference in plumage between the two sexes. They hide their nests so well\r\nthat we could not find them out, and consequently did not taste their eggs.\r\nThey have a red naked area round their eyes, their beaks are straight and\r\npointed, near two and two-fifths inches long, and red also. They cannot\r\nfly, their fat makes them too heavy for it. If you offer them anything red,\r\nthey are so angry they will fly at you to catch it out of your hand, and in\r\nthe heat of the combat we had an opportunity to take them with ease.\"\r\n\r\nQuite extinct.

The tibia is bare for about 7 mm., the\r\nmetatarsus covered in front with nearly a dozen transverse, very distinct\r\nscales, and distinctly reticulated behind. The bill much as in\r\n_Poliolimnas_ and _Porzanula_.\r\n\r\nTwo species can be recognized: _Pennula millsi_, with a uniform upper\r\nsurface, and _Pennula sandwichensis_, with a distinctly spotted upper side.\r\nBoth forms are now extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PENNULA MILLSI DOLE.\r\n\r\n                           MOHO OF THE NATIVES.\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 26, FIG. 3.)\r\n\r\n    _Pennula millei_ (misprint for _millsi_) Dole, Hawaiian Almanac 1879 p.\r\n    54 (reprint in Ibis 1880 p. 241. \"Uplands of Hawaii: named in honour of\r\n    Mr. Mills, spec. in Mills's Coll., nearly extinct\"); Rothsch., Avif.\r\n    Laysan, etc., p. 241 pl.

All\r\nrecent attempts to find specimens have been futile. Mr. Palmer, whom I sent\r\na specially trained dog, also failed to find even traces of it. It lived\r\nformerly in the country between Hilo and the volcano Kilauea, in places\r\nwhere thick grass, _Vaccinium_ and _Dianella_, forms the thickest cover\r\npossible. In former times the \"Moho\" was a dainty on the tables of the\r\nHawaiian kings, but its disappearance is probably due to the introduction\r\nof the obnoxious mongoose and to bush fires. {138}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PENNULA SANDWICHENSIS (GM.)\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 26, FIG. 2.)\r\n\r\n    _Rallus Sandwichensis_ Gmelin, Syst.

IX, figs 4-7.\r\n\r\nThis bird is described from an imperfect pelvis, a perfect left\r\ntibio-tarsus and a femur. The pelvis differs from that of _T. mortieri_ in\r\nnot having the deep depression in the ilia in front of the acetabulum and\r\nabove the pectineal process. It also differs in having a rather wider\r\npelvic escutcheon and wider renal fossal, and the supra-acetabular ridges\r\nof the ilia are smaller than in the Australian bird. The\r\nbeautifully-preserved left tibia differs from that of _T. mortieri_ in\r\nhaving the intercondylar groove wider and shallower, the inner condyle less\r\nmassive, thus making the difference between the inner and outer condyle\r\nmore marked; _T. roberti_ also has the shaft immediately above the extensor\r\nbridge wider, the bridge itself less oblique, and the fibular crest is\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nThe measurements are:--\r\n\r\n  _Pelvis._\r\n\r\n  Length of Ilium                                    82 mm. approx.\r\n  Least width of acetabular region of Pelvis         14 \"\r\n  Width at Antitrochanter                            40 \"\r\n  Width at anterior angle of Pelvic Escutcheon       36 \"\r\n  Width at Posterior angle of Pelvic Escutcheon      40 \"\r\n  Length of Sacrum                                   68 \"\r\n\r\n  _Tibia._\r\n\r\n  Length                                            143 mm.\r\n  Width at distal extremity                          12 \"\r\n  Width at middle of shaft                            7 \"\r\n\r\n  _Femur._\r\n\r\n  Length                                             83 mm.\r\n  Width at distal extremity                          17 \"\r\n  Width at middle of shaft                            7 \"\r\n\r\nHabitat: Sirabé in C.

Zool. Soc. III, p. 377, pl. LVI, figs.\r\n    7-11 (1848).\r\n\r\nThis species was founded on a nearly entire skull, collected by Walter\r\nMantell at Waingongoro, North Island, New Zealand. This skull is more than\r\ntwice the size of that of _Porphyrio melanotus_. The basisphenoidal\r\nsurface, however, is flatter, the anterior angle projects below the base of\r\nthe presphenoid, and there is a slender ridge continued from each\r\nparoccipital to the lateral angles of the platform, the posterior angles\r\nbeing hemispheric tubercles as in _Palapteryx_.\r\n\r\nThe occipital region inclines forwards as it rises, while the same is more\r\nvertical in _Porphyrio_. The post-frontal is broader than in _Porphyrio_.\r\nThe chief distinction from that of _Porphyrio_ is, however, the almost\r\nregular four-sided figure of the skull. The breadth of the anterior part is\r\nalmost exactly that of the occipital region, and the extent of the sides is\r\nnot much more than that of the front and back part. The parieto-frontal\r\nregion of the skull is very unlike that of _Porphyrio_, being convex and\r\noblong, and _Notornis_ also lacks cerebral or hemispheric convexities. Owen\r\ngives a large number of other differences, but I refer my readers to the\r\noriginal article as above, pp. 366-371. I, however, must state here, as is\r\nalready mentioned by Mr. Hamilton, Trans. N.Z. Inst. XXIV, p. 176, 1892,\r\nthat the _Dinornis_ skull, with which Professor Owen compared _Notornis_,\r\nreferred by him to _D. casuarinus_ is really that of _Aptornis defossor_\r\n(_vide_ Trans. Zool. Soc. III, pl. 52, figs. 1-7), and, therefore, it is\r\nquite natural that Professor Owen found a great likeness to _Dinornis_ in\r\n_Notornis_, as the skull he compared it with was really that of the Ralline\r\n_Aptornis_, and not the Struthious _Dinornis_ at all.\r\n\r\nHabitat: North Island, New Zealand.\r\n\r\nDr. H. O. Forbes, Trans. N.Z. Inst., discusses at length measurements of\r\ntibiae and femora of _Notornis_, provisionally naming the skeleton in the\r\nOtago Museum _Notornis parkeri_, as a new species, but I consider we must\r\nwait for confirmation till we get an associated skeleton of _N. mantelli_.\r\n{142}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NOTORNIS HOCHSTETTERI A.B.M.\r\n\r\n                               (PLATE 34.)\r\n\r\n    _Notornis Hochstetteri_ A.

B. Meyer was fully justified in\r\ndescribing the latter form as different, under the name of _N.\r\nhochstetteri_.\r\n\r\nAccording to the describer there are considerable differences in the\r\ncranial bones, but the comparison of the leg-bones shows such differences\r\nin size that these alone would be sufficient to separate the North and\r\nSouth Island forms. The femur of _N. hochstetteri_ measures 109, that of\r\n_N. mantelli_ 122, the tibia of the former 165, the tarso-metatarsus 109,\r\nthe tibia of the latter 200, the tarso-metatarsus 129 mm. For further\r\nmeasurements see A. B. Meyer, Abbild. Vogelskelett I, p. 30.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface is olive-green with some slaty-blue shading, the quills\r\nare black with purplish blue outer webs; rectrices blackish, green on the\r\nouter webs. Head, neck, and under surface purplish blue, thighs more\r\nblackish. Under tail-coverts white, frontal plate and bill bright red,\r\nyellow towards the tip of both mandibles. Feet red.\r\n\r\nAlthough this bird is evidently not extinct, a specimen having been\r\ncaptured as late as 1898, it seems that not many examples live at present\r\nin New Zealand, as they have been sought after a good deal, and yet only\r\nfour have been taken so far, _i.e._, the two in the British Museum, one in\r\nthe Dresden Museum, and the last-mentioned one.\r\n\r\nFull accounts of the capture of this last specimen have been given in the\r\nTrans. New Zealand Institute, XXXI, pp. 146-150, and in Sir Walter Buller's\r\nSupplement to the Birds of New Zealand, I, pp. 66-74, where, however, the\r\nyear of the capture is not mentioned, though one can guess that it must\r\nhave taken place shortly before the articles on it appeared.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Middle Island, usually called South Island, apparently nearly\r\nextinct. {143}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NOTORNIS STANLEYI (ROWLEY).\r\n\r\n    _White gallinule_, Voy. of Gov.

Gray, List Birds N.Z., &c., Ibis 1862, p. 214.\r\n\r\nThe first to point out the differences between the bird now in the\r\nLiverpool Museum and the specimen in Vienna was Mr. Dawson Rowley. The\r\noriginal description of the anonymous author of Phillip's Voyage is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"This beautiful bird greatly resembles the purple Gallinule in shape and\r\nmake, but is much superior in size, being as large as a dunghill fowl. The\r\nlength from end of bill to that of the claws is two feet three inches. The\r\nbill is very stout, and the colour of it, the whole of the top of the head\r\nand the irides red; the sides of the head round the eyes are reddish, very\r\nthinly sprinkled with white feathers; the whole of the plumage is, without\r\nexception, white. The legs the colour of the bill. This species is pretty\r\ncommon on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and other places, and is a very\r\ntame species. The other sex, supposed to be the male, is said to have some\r\nblue on the wings.\"\r\n\r\nGray states under _Porphyrio alba_, in Ibis 1862, p. 214: \"It is stated\r\nthat a similar kind was found on Lord Howe Island which was incapable of\r\nflight. The wings of the male were beautifully mottled with blue.\"\r\n\r\nDr. H. O. Forbes, in the Bulletin of the Liverpool Museums, Vol. III, No.\r\n2, pp. 62-68 (1901), gives an exhaustive account of Rowley's type, in which\r\nhe comes to the conclusion that the bird is not a _Porphyrio_ but a\r\n_Notornis_, and that it is also probably a specimen of _Notornis alba_.\r\nThat it is a _Notornis_ I equally believe; but I think the length of the\r\nwing-coverts in the type of _N. alba_, puts it out of the question that the\r\ntwo birds could be the same. Moreover, the two original pictures of Phillip\r\nand White show this difference of the wings very well. I have therefore\r\nkept the two separate, and I feel sure if we had other specimens with exact\r\ndata we should find this a parallel case to that of _Nesonetta aucklandica_\r\nof the Auckland Islands and _Anas chlorotis_ of New Zealand, and that\r\n_Notornis alba_ of Norfolk Island was a still further degenerate form to\r\nthe already flightless _N. stanleyi_ of Lord Howe Island. Wing nine inches.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Lord Howe Island. {144}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          NOTORNIS ALBA (WHITE).\r\n\r\n                               (PLATE 33.)\r\n\r\n    ? _White gallinule_ Callam, Voy.

X.\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable confusion in connection with this bird and the\r\nfollowing species, owing to the fact of White not having given any locality\r\nfor the specimen on which Latham founded his _Gallinula alba_, and which is\r\nnow in the Vienna Museum. That the Vienna specimen is really White's bird\r\nis proved because it was bought at the sale of the Leverian Museum, and\r\nWhite expressly states that all his birds were deposited in the Leverian\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible to say with _certainty_ which of the two forms,\r\n_Notornis alba_ or _N. stanleyi_, came from Norfolk Island, as we have no\r\nindication of the origin of the Liverpool specimen. But seeing that in the\r\nanonymous work, \"The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay,\" the first\r\nmentioned habitat is Lord Howe Island, and the figure shows a bird with the\r\nshorter wing-coverts of _N. stanleyi_, I think I am justified in taking the\r\nbird with longer wing-coverts--viz., _Notornis alba_, to be the bird from\r\nNorfolk Island.\r\n\r\nWhite's description is as follows:--\"White Fulica, with bill and front red,\r\nshoulders spined, legs and feet yellow.\" White's figure clearly shows the\r\nlong wing coverts characteristic of the genus _Notornis_. Von Pelzeln says\r\nin his account of this bird that there is a label on it bearing the number\r\n102, and giving as place of origin Norfolk Island, but White makes no\r\nmention of this. There are traces of a bluish shade, and two or three dark\r\nspots on the plumage, which has led many ornithologists to consider _N.\r\nalba_ an albino. Gray, in \"A List of Birds from New Zealand, &c.,\"[3]\r\nremarked that some Norfolk Island specimens had blue between the shoulders,\r\nand the back spotted with the same colour. He also states that the young\r\nare said to be black, then become bluish grey, and afterwards pure white.\r\nFrom these and other authors' similar remarks I believe we have not here a\r\ncase of albinism, but a bird which was in a stage of evolution towards\r\nbecoming a fixed white species. Wing 9 inches (measured by myself in the\r\nVienna Museum).\r\n\r\nHabitat: Norfolk Island.\r\n\r\n{145}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            APTERORNIS SELYS.\r\n\r\n\"Differed widely from _Didus_ and _Pezophaps_ in its long beak, which\r\nresembles a little that of a woodcock, but is much stronger.

In addition, the strong calcaneal process,\r\nperforated by a complete bony canal for the tendon at the back part of the\r\nproximal end of the tarso-metatarsus; the perforation above the interspace\r\nbetween the condyles for the middle and outer toes; and the more posterior\r\nposition for the condyle for the inner toe all prove the distinctness of\r\nthis genus.\r\n\r\nType: _Aptornis otidiformis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       APTORNIS OTIDIFORMIS (OWEN).\r\n\r\n    _Dinornis otidiformis_ Owen, Trans.

The same applies to the\r\nremarks by Jacques Cartier, as translated in R. Hakluyt's collection of\r\nvoyages. On the other hand there is no doubt that the \"Penguin\" mentioned\r\nby Robert Hore in 1536 (Hakluyt, Collection of Voyages III, p. 129--1600,\r\nand other Editions) was actually the Great Auk. In fact \"Penguin\" has been\r\nthe name usually applied to the Great Auk {154} and is even now used for it\r\nby the French, while in most other languages it has been transferred, from\r\nan early date, to the Antarctic flightless birds, the _Spheniscidae_.\r\n\r\nAll the first reports are from Newfoundland and thereabout, and even\r\nClusius (Exoticorum libri decem, Lib. V, p. 103--1605), who gives a rather\r\npoor but perfectly recognizable figure, describes it first (p. 103) as a\r\nnative of America, under the name of \"Mergus Americanus.\" Later on,\r\nhowever, in the \"Auctarium,\" on p. 367, he mentions it, on the authority of\r\nHenricus Hojerus, as found in the Faröe Islands, under the name\r\n\"Goirfugel.\" Hojerus was also the authority for the account given in\r\nNieremberg, Hist. Nat., etc., p. 215 (1635). The first comparatively good\r\nfigure was published in 1655, in the \"Museum Wormianum,\" on p. 301, from a\r\nspecimen brought alive from the Faröe Islands. Curiously enough the figure\r\nshows a white ring round the neck, which no Great Auk, of course,\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus, when first bestowing a scientific name on the Great Auk, in 1758,\r\nl.c., gave the following short diagnosis and references:--\r\n\r\n    \"Alca rostro compresso--ancipiti sulcato, macula ovata utrinque ante\r\n    oculos. Fn. Svec. 119.\r\n\r\n    Anser magellanicus. Worm. mus. 300 t. 301.\r\n\r\n    Penguin. Will. ornith. 244 t. 65 Edw. av. 147 t. 147.\r\n\r\n    _Habitat in_ Europa _arctica_.\"\r\n\r\nFrom referring to the literature he quotes, there can, of course, be no\r\ndoubt as to what species he refers.\r\n\r\nThe most detailed descriptions are probably those given in the New Edition\r\nof Naumann (see above), where also a list of literature and figures is\r\ngiven, fully seven folio pages long! As regards the difference in the sexes\r\nlittle is known, because very few specimens exist of which the sex has been\r\nascertained. We find, however, some with the grooves and ridges on the bill\r\nmore marked, and the grooves purer white, while others have the grooves of\r\na dirtier white and less strongly developed; as these latter are apparently\r\nmostly smaller, I think they must be females, the former males. In this\r\ncase my two specimens would be females, and the one now in Professor\r\nKoenig's possession an adult male. Probably somewhat similar seasonal\r\nchanges took place as in _Alca torda_, and Professor Blasius (l.c.) has\r\ndescribed them. It must, however, be remembered, that the date of capture\r\nis known of but a few examples, and that by far the majority of all those\r\nthat exist in collections have been killed in spring, on their\r\nbreeding-places.\r\n\r\nNobody can doubt that the Great Auk is extinct. The last specimens were\r\nobtained on Eldey, near Iceland, in 1844, and the seas and islands {155}\r\nwhere the great bird used to live are frequented by vessels every year. It\r\nis true that a certain Lorenz Brodtkorb told that in April, 1848, he saw\r\nfour Great Auks, of which he shot one, near the Varanger Fjord, east of the\r\nNorth-Cape, but Professor Newton and Wolley have, in 1855, had an interview\r\nwith Brodtkorb, and came to the conclusion that he saw and shot the Great\r\nNorthern Diver. This is the more likely to be the case, as the occurrence\r\nnorth of the Arctic Circle is as yet uncertain, the finding of Great Auks\r\nboth on the island of Disco (west-coast of Greenland) and on Grimsey and\r\nMevenklint on the north coast of Iceland being open to doubt.\r\n\r\nFrom sub-fossil and prehistoric finds, we know that the Great Auk formerly\r\ninhabited Norway and Sweden, Denmark, with Seeland, Sejerö and Havnö, the\r\nBritish Islands (Cleadon Hills in County Durham, Scotland, Ireland), the\r\neast coast of North America from Labrador to Florida.\r\n\r\nIn historic times we know of the occurrence on the islands near Labrador,\r\nGreenland--where it certainly used to breed on the east coast, but was\r\nprobably only of rare and exceptional occurrence on the west\r\ncoast--Iceland, the Faröe Islands, Fair Island between the Orkney and\r\nShetland Islands (doubtful), Orkneys (Papa Westra), St. Kilda, Skye, and\r\nWaterford Harbour in Ireland. But as breeding stations within historic\r\ntimes the following only are absolutely certain:--\r\n\r\n  1. Funk Islands near Newfoundland.\r\n  2. Iceland (Geirfuglasker, Grimsey, Eldey).\r\n  3. Faröe Islands.\r\n  4. St. Kilda.\r\n  5. Orkney Islands.\r\n\r\nWhile we know of regular occurrence and may assume that the bird has been\r\nbreeding on the north and west side of Newfoundland, and in east Greenland\r\n(opposite Iceland).\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Great Auk and its eggs in collections are more numerous\r\nthan one would think, considering the enormous prices paid for mounted\r\nspecimens and eggs. There are at present known 79 or 80 skins, 26 or 27\r\nskeletons, a great quantity of detached bones, and about 73 eggs.\r\n\r\n    I HAVE IN MY MUSEUM:\r\n\r\n    1. One adult female, formerly in the collection of the late Comte de\r\n    Riocour at Vitry-le-François, in France. I bought this specimen from\r\n    the late Alphonse Boucard, together with the bulk of the birds of the\r\n    Riocour collection. It is evidently an adult female, having the white\r\n    lines on the bill not very much developed, and showing a distinct grey\r\n    tinge on the flanks. This shade is present in both my Great Auks; the\r\n    feathers of the flanks, just under the wing, are nearly white, with a\r\n    conspicuous, very light grey border. This grey tinge is present in all\r\n    females, but appears to be absent in adult males. My bird is apparently\r\n    in worn breeding plumage. As it was not very well mounted and the feet\r\n    slightly damaged, I had it reduced to a \"skin.\"\r\n\r\n    {156} 2. Another adult female. I purchased this from Mr. Rowland Ward,\r\n    who had it from Mr. Leopold Field in London, in 1897. According to a\r\n    letter, dated Paris le 20 Jan., 1890, written by the late A. Boucard,\r\n    who sold it in that year to Mr. Field, the history is as follows: \"This\r\n    bird was captured in Iceland in 1837, did first belong to Mr. Eimbeck\r\n    of Brunswick and afterwards in the collection of Mr. Bruch from\r\n    Mayence.\" We must accept this information by the late A. Boucard as\r\n    correct, though it is difficult to understand that in the most\r\n    painstaking and exact list of remains of the Great Auk, by Prof.\r\n    Wilhelm Blasius of Braunschweig, or anywhere else, no mention is made\r\n    of a specimen in the possession of the late Eimbeck, or the late Bruch.\r\n    Moreover, we have no explanation where this Auk has been between the\r\n    time of Bruch's death and 1890, when Boucard sold it to Mr. Field in\r\n    London.\r\n\r\n    This specimen has been described as \"immature,\" but this is a mistake.\r\n    Evidently it arose from some white speckles being visible on the neck\r\n    _in the photograph_ (see Symington Grieve, Trans. Edinburgh Field Nat.\r\n    and Micros. Society, explanation to plate III, on page 269). The\r\n    specimen itself, however, shows no white speckles, but only worn\r\n    feathers, out of which the illusion arose in the photograph. This error\r\n    has also been transferred to the admirable treatise on the Great Auk in\r\n    the New Edition of Naumann. The grey shade \"on the body lower than the\r\n    wing,\" mentioned by Mr. Symington Grieve, is not a sign of immaturity,\r\n    but appears in all adult females, though it is said to be absent in\r\n    males.\r\n\r\nSome years ago an extraordinary rumour was current in Germany about the\r\nGreat Auk in the Brehm collection; it was said to have been exchanged by\r\nthe widow of Pastor C. L. Brehm for a rare Dresden cup, and that its\r\npresent resting-place was unknown. I do not know who invented this story,\r\nor how it arose, but suffice it to say, that the Auk which was in the Brehm\r\ncollection was sold to the late King of Italy, in 1868 or 1869. The\r\nbusiness was concluded by Dr. Otto Finsch, and the money was used for the\r\nbenefit of a brother of the late Dr. A. E. Brehm, as it had been the wish\r\nof his father, Pastor Brehm. The specimen was re-stuffed by the late\r\ntaxidermist Schwerdtfeger in Bremen and forwarded to a professor in\r\nFlorence. It was kept for years at the \"Veneria Reale,\" and recently, when\r\nthe collection at that castle was dissolved, was placed in the Museum at\r\nRome. It is one of the finest Great Auks known.\r\n\r\n{157}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      AESTRELATA CARIBBAEA (CARTE).\r\n\r\n                               (PLATE 37.)\r\n\r\n    _Procellaria jamaicensis_ Bancroft, Zoological Journal V, p. 81\r\n    (1835--Nomen nudum!).\r\n\r\n    _Pterodroma caribbaea_ Carte, P.Z.S. 1866, p. 93, pl. 10 (\"Blue\r\n    Mountains in insula Jamaica\").\r\n\r\n    _Aestrelata caribbaea_ Giglioli & Salvadori, Ibis 1869, p. 66.\r\n\r\n    _Fulmarus caribbaeus_ Gray, Handlist B.

Mus, p. 403 (1896).\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that the name _jamaicensis_ has generally been adopted for\r\nthis species, as Bancroft gave no description whatever. The first\r\ndescription is that of Carte, in 1866, which is as follows:--\"Head, neck,\r\nback, and wings of a uniform dark sooty brown; vertex and external webs of\r\nthe primaries a shade or so darker; abdominal feathers and under\r\ntail-coverts a shade or two lighter than those of the back; upper\r\ntail-coverts and basal portion of tail-feathers of a light grey or dirty\r\nwhite. The light-coloured patch on the rump is conspicuous when the wings\r\nare expanded, but completely concealed when they are closed. Irides dark\r\nhazel. Tarsi, toes, webs, and nails jet-black.\r\n\r\n\"Length about 12¾ inches; expanse of wings 34 inches; length from carpal\r\njoint to tip of first primary 10¾ inches; length of bill, measured from\r\ngape, 1-5/8 inches; length of nasal tubes 5/16 inch; length of interval\r\nbetween nostrils and commencement of apical curve of upper mandible ¼ inch;\r\nlength of tarsi 1-5/10 inches; length of toes, outer and middle, sub-equal\r\n2 inches; length of inner toe 1-5/8 inches. First and second primaries\r\nsub-equal, and about ½ inch longer than the third. Tail about 4½ inches\r\nlong and round at extremity. The closed wings extend about 1½ inches beyond\r\nthe tail. Hallux small, and in shape triangular.\"\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the habits of the bird, Mr. March has most kindly\r\nfurnished me with the following interesting details:--\r\n\r\n\"It is a night-bird, living in burrows in the marly clefts of the mountains\r\nat the east and north-east end of the island. The burrows form a gallery 6\r\nto 10 feet long, terminating in a chamber sufficiently commodious to\r\naccommodate the pair; from this they sally forth at night, flying over the\r\nsea in search of food (fishes), returning before dawn. It is often seen on\r\nmoonlight nights and at sunrise running about the neighbourhood of its\r\ndomicile, and sometimes crossing the road, regardless of the labourers\r\ngoing to their work. I know nothing of its nidification.\" {158}\r\n\r\nThe type of \"_Pterodroma caribbaea_\" is preserved in the Dublin Museum, and\r\nthree specimens are in the British Museum. This bird is one of the rarest\r\nin collections, and all modern collectors have failed to obtain specimens.\r\nQuite recently (1906) Mr. B. Hyatt Verrill published a pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Additions to the Avifauna of Dominica.\" In this unpaginated essay he said\r\nunder the heading \"_Aestrelata jamaicensis_\": \"Not uncommon (on Dominica),\r\nbut seldom seen during the day. Breeds at La Bime, Pointe Guignarde, and\r\nLance Bateaux, as well as at Morne Rouge and Scott's Head. In many of the\r\nabove localities the musky odour of these birds is very pronounced when\r\npassing the cliffs, wherein they breed, on a calm evening. At dusk they may\r\noften be seen flying about the cliffs in company with myriads of bats that\r\nspend the day in the fissures and crevices. They are very difficult to\r\nprocure, and although shot at repeatedly only two specimens have been\r\nobtained.\"\r\n\r\nFrom all former evidence we might have well considered this species to be\r\nextinct, but if Mr. Verrill's statement is correct it would be far from\r\nexterminated. I do not, however, know if the Dominica specimens have been\r\ncompared with Jamaica examples, and if Mr. Verrill's determination\r\n(apparently made on Dominica) is therefore correct.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Jamaica. {159}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AESTRELATA HASITATA (KUHL).\r\n\r\n    _Procellaria hasitata_ (sic) Kuhl, Beitr. z.

XXV, p. 403 (1896).\r\n\r\nMr. Saunders describes this bird as follows: \"The adult has the crown and\r\nnape dark brown, hind-neck white, cheeks and ear-coverts greyish; mantle\r\ndark brown; upper tail-coverts white; central tail-feathers chiefly\r\nbrownish-black, the rest more or less white on their basal portions but\r\nbroadly edged with brown; forehead and under-parts white; bill black; legs\r\nand feet dusky-yellow. Length 16 inches, wing 11.3 inches. The immature\r\nbird is believed to be mottled with brown on the forehead and to be duller\r\nin tint on the upper parts.\"\r\n\r\nThough evidently not quite extinct, it seems certain that the fate of this\r\nbird is sealed. In former times it used to breed in great numbers on\r\nseveral of the West Indian Islands: Hayti, Guadeloupe, and Dominica. Its\r\nlast breeding place was the Morne au Diable or Morne Diablotin on Dominica.\r\nThere it was searched for in vain by Colonel Feilden, in 1889, who wrote a\r\nlengthy article about it in the \"Trans. Norfolk and Norwich Nat. Society\"\r\nV. p. 24-39. Mr. Selwyn Branch again, ten years later, ascended La Morne au\r\nDiable, and found the old breeding places deserted. The \"Manicou,\"\r\nevidently an introduced North-American Opossum, Mongoose and rats had\r\nentirely extirpated the \"Diable.\"\r\n\r\nTwo-and-a-half centuries ago Père du Tertre found this Petrel breeding on\r\nGuadeloupe, and Père Labat, about forty years later, found it in great\r\nnumbers, and gave a long, graphic description of it in his \"Nouveau Voyage\r\naux isles de l'Amérique\" (Edit. I, Vol. II, pp. 349-353). These birds were\r\nthen known as the \"Diable\" or \"Diablotin,\" and their flesh was highly\r\nesteemed, and they were even salted and exported to Martinique and other\r\nFrench islands in great numbers. {160}\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Mr. F. A. Ober searched already unsuccessfully for our birds.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the disturbance and destruction on their breeding places has\r\nscattered these Petrels about, for specimens have at various times been\r\ntaken on the coast of Florida and Virginia, and even as late as 1893 and\r\n1895, inland of the State of New York on Oneida Lake, in Ulster County,\r\nVermont and Ontario; moreover, a specimen has been killed in 1850 in\r\nNorfolk, England, and an example in the Museum of Boulogne is said to have\r\nbeen killed in the neighbourhood of that town.\r\n\r\nIn an undated and unpaginated pamphlet, received last year in Europe, Mr.\r\nA. Hyatt Verrill informs us that this bird is \"not uncommon on the fishing\r\ngrounds and in Martinique and Guadeloupe channels,\" and that he took a\r\nspecimen in September, 1904. This statement requires confirmation.\r\n\r\nIn collections this bird is very rare. I have the male (in moult) which was\r\ncaught on August 28th, 1893 on Oneida Lake, in the State of New York.\r\n\r\nHabitat: West Indian Islands.\r\n\r\n{161}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HEMIPHAGA SPADICEA (LATH.)\r\n\r\n                               (PLATE 21.)\r\n\r\n    _Chestnut-shouldered Pigeon_ Latham, Gen.

These feathers are\r\nrather curiously constructed, they have the polish, brilliancy, and feel of\r\na cartilaginous blade. I could not, with the aid of a lens, distinguish\r\nwhether these blades were formed by the conglomeration of the barbules, but\r\nwe may take it for granted that they are constituted in a like manner to\r\nthe wing appendages of the Bohemian Waxwing and the cartilaginous blades of\r\nSonnerat's Jungle Fowl. The eye is surrounded by naked skin of a deep red;\r\nthe back, the wings and the belly are of a dark blue; the rump and tail are\r\nof a very bright carmine red; the beak and iris are of the same colour, and\r\nthe feet are black.\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly quite extinct. Only three specimens are known of this bird: one\r\nin Edinburgh, one in Paris, and one in Mauritius. Some bones were collected\r\nby the Rev. H. H. Slater.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Mauritius. {164}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                ALECTROENAS(?) RODERICANA (MILNE-EDWARDS).\r\n\r\n    _Columba rodericana_ Milne-Edwards, Ann. Sc. Nat. (5) XIX art. 3, p.\r\n    16, pl. 12, ff. 1, 1a, 1b, 1c (1874).\r\n\r\nThe original description of the sternum is as follows:--\"It belongs to a\r\nspecies small in size, barely as large as _T. tympanistria_, but evidently\r\nmuch better built for flight. In fact the most striking characters of this\r\nsternum are the large size of the bouclier, the large size of the lateral\r\nnotches, and the shape of the keel, whose anterior angle is not much\r\nproduced in front. The coracoidal grooves are large and only slightly\r\noblique. The lateral branches detach themselves from the bone in front of\r\nthe costal facets--they are very widely spread, and stretch more directly\r\noutwards than in the remainder of the species of the family. The lower\r\nlateral branches are equally divergent, and the median blade of the\r\nposterior edge is remarkable from its enlargement. The keel is moderately\r\nprominent, its anterior angle is much rounded, and does not reach the level\r\nof the episternal apophysis, as is the case, as a rule, in the pigeons. All\r\nthese peculiarities, to which must be added the general flattening of the\r\nbone which is hardly at all sloped like a roof, separate the pigeon of\r\nRodriguez very widely, not only from _Erythroena_ and _Turtur_, but also\r\nfrom _Vinago_. In its shape in general, by the little pronounced keel and\r\nthe direction of the latter, this sternum presents certain analogies to the\r\nessentially arboreal species such as those of the genus _Carpophaga_, but\r\nthey all differ in having the space for the costal facets on the sides of\r\nthe sternum much more extended, the superior lateral branches larger, and\r\nthe latter arising further back, so that the lateral notches are smaller.\r\nUp to the present I do not know any genus of the family of _Columbidae_ in\r\nwhich the sternum can at all be likened to that found recently in\r\nRodriguez, and therefore in all probability this fossil remainder is of yet\r\nanother vanished species, which I propose to call _Columba rodericana_.\"\r\n(Translated.)\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Milne-Edwards's _C. rodericana_ belonged to the genus\r\n_Alectroenas_, and was the representative on Rodriguez of the _Alectroenas\r\nnitidissima_ of Mauritius. 1 humerus in the Tring Museum.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Rodriguez.\r\n\r\n{165}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NESOENAS SALVAD.\r\n\r\nSoles normal, not very broad, only the hind toe with the skin prominently\r\nexpanded on the sides.

H. H. Slater, during his visit to\r\nMauritius. As observed by Mons. Paul Carié (Ornis XII, p. 127), the idea\r\nthat it is extinct is, however, incorrect, as it can still easily be\r\nprocured, though it is rare. M. Georges Antelme, of Mauritius, possesses\r\nthe eggs of this pigeon. That it still exists is also evident from two\r\nspecimens which were sent to the Zoological Gardens, London, last year, and\r\nare still living there.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Mauritius. {166}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NESOENAS DUBOISI SP.

At a certain season they\r\nare so fat 'qu'on ne leur voit point de croupion;' they taste very good.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage cannot be meant for a turtle-dove, but the description of the\r\nbill and surrounding of the eyes shows that it refers to a form allied to\r\n_Nesoenas mayeri_. The latter, however, is not entirely russet red, but the\r\nhead, neck, underside and back are creamy white, washed with a greyish-rose\r\ncolour. Therefore the bird mentioned by Le Sieur D.B. was evidently a\r\nrepresentative of N. _mayeri_ or Bourbon.

(Cf. Bangs, l.c.)\r\n\r\nThe Passenger Pigeon in former times occurred throughout North America in\r\ngreat abundance, from the Atlantic to the great Central Plains, and from\r\nthe Southern States, where it rarely occurred, north to at least 62°\r\nnorthern latitude. Being a migrant, this bird used to migrate southwards\r\nafter the breeding season, and to return to their homes in spring, but it\r\nalso shifted its quarters according to the abundance or scarcity of food,\r\nlike our Pigeons. Sometimes incredible numbers flocked together. Such\r\nstupendous flights have been described independently by Audubon, Wilson and\r\nothers. In 1813 Audubon says that during his whole journey from Hardensburg\r\nto Louisville, fifty-five miles, countless masses of Pigeons continued to\r\npass over, and also did so during the three following days. \"At times they\r\nflew so low, that multitudes were destroyed, and for many days the entire\r\npopulation seemed to eat nothing else but Pigeons.\" Where they roosted in\r\nmillions, the dung soon covered the ground and destroyed the grass and\r\nundergrowth, limbs and even small trees broke down from the weight of the\r\nbirds. \"One of the breeding places visited by Wilson, not far from\r\nShelbyville, Kentucky, stretched through the forest in nearly a north and\r\nsouth direction. This was several miles in breadth, and upwards of forty\r\nmiles in extent. In this immense tract nearly every tree was furnished with\r\nnests wherever there were branches to accommodate them. He was informed by\r\nthose who sought to plunder the nests of the squabs, that the noise in the\r\nwoods was so great as to terrify their horses, and that it was difficult\r\nfor one person to hear another speak. The ground was strewed with broken\r\nlimbs, eggs and young Pigeons. Hawks were sailing about in great numbers,\r\nwhile from twenty feet upwards to the tops of the trees there was a\r\nperpetual tumult of crowding and fluttering multitudes of Pigeons, their\r\nwings resounding like thunder, and mingled with the frequent crash of\r\nfalling trees. In one instance he counted ninety nests in a single tree.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only natural that man took advantage of such vast multitudes, and\r\nthat they were killed in great numbers, for food, and, maybe, sometimes\r\nwantonly destroyed. Yet it is difficult to understand what brought on their\r\ntotal destruction, as their power of flight was great, and their vision\r\nremarkably keen. In 1874 Messrs. Baird, Brewer and Ridgway considered them\r\nstill common birds, though \"their abundance in large extents of the country\r\nhad {169} been very sensibly reduced.\" At that time \"in the New England\r\nStates and in the more cultivated part of the country, these birds no\r\nlonger bred in large communities. The instance near Montpelier, in 1849, is\r\nthe only marked exception that has come within my knowledge. They now breed\r\nin isolated pairs, their nests being scattered through the woods and seldom\r\nnear one another.\" In 1895, in the A.O.U. check-list, the authors say:\r\n\"Breeding range now mainly restricted to portions of the Canadas and the\r\nnorthern borders of the United States, as far west as Manitoba and the\r\nDakotas.\"\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Passenger Pigeon seems to have entirely\r\ndisappeared, a small flock in an aviary apparently being all that is left\r\nof it alive. Mr. James H. Fleming, of Toronto, kindly sends me the\r\nfollowing notes, which I think are of the greatest interest:--\r\n\r\n\"The disappearance of the Passenger Pigeon in Ontario dates back at least\r\nforty years, though as late as 1870 some of the old roosts were still\r\nfrequented, but the incredible flocks, of which so much has been said, had\r\ngone long before that date, and by 1880 the pigeon was practically\r\nexterminated, not only in Ontario, but over the greater part of its old\r\nrange. There are however occasional records of birds taken, for some years\r\nlater. An immature bird taken September 9, 1887, in Chester County,\r\nPennsylvania, is said to be the last for that part of the State[4]; a bird,\r\nalso immature, is in my collection, taken in December, 1888, at Montreal,\r\nQuebec. There are other Montreal records of the same date,[5] but with the\r\nexception of one taken at Tadousac, July 26, 1889,[6] these are the last\r\nQuebec records of birds actually taken. In Ontario two were taken at\r\nToronto in 1890, on September 20, and October 11, both immature females,\r\nthe latter is in my collection, as is an adult female taken by Mr. Walter\r\nBrett, at Riding Mountain, Manatoba, May 12, 1892, one of a pair seen. I\r\nalso have an adult male taken at Waukegon, Illinois, December 19, 1892. I\r\nwas in New York in the latter part of November, 1892, and was then assured\r\nby Mr. Rowland, a well known taxidermist, that he had recently seen several\r\nbarrels of pigeons that had been condemned as unfit for food; they had come\r\nto New York from Indian Territory, and I believe had had their tails pulled\r\nout to permit tighter packing. Mr. William Brewster has recorded the\r\nsending of several hundred dozens of pigeons to the Boston market in\r\nDecember of the same year, and in January, 1893; these were also from\r\nIndian Territory[7]; these are the last records we have of the Passenger\r\nPigeon as anything more than a casual migrant. The records ceased after\r\nthis till 1898, when three birds were taken at points widely apart, {170}\r\nan adult male at Winnipegosis, Manatoba, on April 14,[8] an immature male\r\nat Owensboro, Kentucky, on July 27, now in the Smithsonian Institution, and\r\nanother immature bird taken at Detroit, Michigan, on September 14, now in\r\nmy collection; these are the last records that can be based on specimens.\r\n\r\n\"In 1903 I published a list including sight records, one as late as May,\r\n1902; this latter is possibly open to doubt, but the ones I gave for 1900\r\nare, I feel confident, correct, as the birds were seen more than once and\r\nby different observers. For all practical purposes, the close of the\r\nNineteenth Century saw the final extinction of the Passenger Pigeon in a\r\nwild state, and there remained only the small flock, numbering in 1903 not\r\nmore than a dozen, that had been bred in captivity by Prof. C. O. Whitman,\r\nof Chicago; these birds are the descendants of a single pair, and have long\r\nago ceased to breed. It was in an effort to obtain fresh blood for this\r\nflock that I started a newspaper enquiry that brought many replies, none of\r\nwhich could be substantiated as records of the Passenger Pigeon, and many\r\nreferred to the Mourning Dove. I am aware that there has been lately\r\nwide-spread and persistent rumours of the return of the pigeons, but no\r\nrumour has borne investigation, and I feel that Prof. Whitman's small\r\nflock, now reduced (in 1906) to five birds, are the last representatives of\r\na species around whose disappearance mystery and fable will always gather.\"\r\n\r\n{171}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FAMILY DIDIDAE.

It is as follows:--\"Blue parrots\r\nare very numerous there, as well as other birds; among which are a kind,\r\nconspicuous for their size, larger than our swans, with huge heads only\r\nhalf covered with skin as if clothed with a hood. These birds lack wings,\r\nin the place of which 3 or 4 blackish feathers protrude. The tail consists\r\nof a few soft incurved feathers, which are ash coloured. These we used to\r\ncall 'Walghvögel,' for the reason that the longer and oftener they were\r\ncooked, the less soft and more insipid eating they became. Nevertheless\r\ntheir belly and breast were of a pleasant flavour and easily masticated.\"\r\n\r\nIn a large number of works on travel and voyages published in the 17th and\r\n18th Centuries we find all sorts of notices about the Dodo, and numerous\r\npictures of which I have given outline drawings. From these sources it\r\nappears that the Dodo became extinct about the end of the 17th Century,\r\n_i.e._, 1680-1690. The causes of the extermination of this, perhaps the\r\nbest known and most talked about of the recently extinct birds, are not far\r\nto seek. The total inability of flight, the heavy slow gait, and the utter\r\nfearlessness from long immunity from enemies, led to a continual slaughter\r\nfor food by the sailors and others who came to and dwelt on Mauritius. But\r\nthe final cause of the extermination of this and many other birds in the\r\nMascarene Islands was probably the introduction of pigs, and also of the\r\nCeylon Monkey. These animals increased enormously in numbers, ran wild in\r\nthe woods, and soon destroyed all the eggs and young birds they could find.\r\n{173}\r\n\r\nIt is strange that for many years after great attention had been paid to\r\nthe _Dodo_, ornithologists differed conspicuously as to what family it and\r\nthe other two Didine species belonged. Many asserted that it was a\r\nStruthious bird, in fact Linnaeus called it calmly _Struthio cucullatus_,\r\nwhile others just as forcibly declared it to be an abnormal Vulture. The\r\ntruth is, that although the _Didunculus strigirostis_ of Samoa, which was\r\nsupposed to be its near representative, is not at all closely allied, yet\r\nthe two species of _Didus_ and _Pezophaps solitarius_ form a group of very\r\nspecialized pigeons.\r\n\r\n    THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF THE PAINTINGS REPRESENTING THE DODO.\r\n\r\n     1. _Vienna_, in the Library of the Emperor Francis.

This is almost certainly\r\nthe bird afterwards preserved in Tradescant's Museum (1656), and finally in\r\nOxford (Ashmolean Museum), and probably served for the model of the\r\nsupposed Savery picture in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Dodo inhabited Mauritius.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--_Didus nazarenus_ Gmelin, based on the \"Oiseau de Nazareth\" of\r\n    Cauche (Descr. de l'ile de Madagascar, p. 130, ff, 1651) is evidently\r\n    founded on a mistaken and partly fictitious description of a Dodo, or\r\n    rather a mixture of that of the Dodo and a Cassowary. The name was,\r\n    perhaps, also a mistake, derived from that of \"_Oiseau de nausée_,\"\r\n    which has a similar meaning as \"Walghvogel.\"\r\n\r\n{174}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Explanation of Plates of Dodo.\r\n\r\n_Plate 24._\r\n\r\n    This was taken from the picture by Roelandt Savery in Berlin, but the\r\n    wings, tail and bill have been altered, partly from Pierre Witthoos'\r\n    picture of the Bourbon Dodo, and partly from anatomical examination.\r\n    The tail, however, appears to have been curled over the back in life,\r\n    according to most authors.\r\n\r\n_Plate 24 (a)._\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 1._ Reproduction in outline of the Dodo in Savery's Orpheus at\r\n    Haag.

His account is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"There is store of land fowle both small and great, plenty of Doves, great\r\nParrats, and such like; and a great fowle of the bignesse of a Turkie, very\r\nfat, and so short winged, that they cannot fly, being white, and in a\r\nmanner tame: and so be all other fowles, as having not been troubled nor\r\nfeared with shot. Our men did beat them down with sticks and stones. Ten\r\nmen may take fowle enough to serve fortie men a day.\"\r\n\r\nWe then find frequent mention of this bird by Bontekoe in 5 separate\r\ntreatises or editions, from 1646 to 1650, and by Carré in 1699. But the\r\nfirst more detailed description is given by the Sieur D.B. (Dubois) in\r\n1674, which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"_Solitaires._ These birds are thus named because they always go alone.\r\nThey are as big as a big goose and have white plumage, black at the\r\nextremity of the wings and of the tail. At the tail there are some feathers\r\nresembling those of the Ostrich. They have the neck long and the beak\r\nformed like that of the Woodcocks (he refers to the woodrails,\r\n_Erythromachus_--W.R.), but larger, and the legs and feet like those of\r\nTurkey-chicks. This bird betakes itself to running, only flying but very\r\nlittle. It is the best game on the Island.\" {176}\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, while Dubois says the wings and tail are black,\r\nPierre Witthoos's picture, from which the accompanying plate was partly\r\ndrawn, shows the wings yellow. This may either be due to Dubois' faulty\r\ndescription, or, what is much more probable, the bird brought to Amsterdam,\r\nwhich Witthoos painted, was somewhat albinistic. The bill in the picture by\r\nWitthoos shows a distinctly mutilated bill, evidently done by the bird's\r\nkeeper to prevent being injured by the formidable hook of the untrimmed\r\nbill. In addition to two pictures (the one formerly in the possession of\r\nMr. C. Dare, of Clatterford, in the Isle of Wight, and a second in Holland,\r\nboth by Pieter Witthoos, painted about the year 1670), we know of this bird\r\nonly the drawing given in Zaagman's edition of Bontekoe, 1646. In all these\r\ndrawings the first four primaries point down and forward, which is probably\r\nowing to the injured condition of the specimen figured, so in the\r\naccompanying plate I had the wing drawn like the true Dodo's and the bill\r\nreconstructed.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Island of Bourbon or Réunion.\r\n\r\nOnly known from the above-mentioned descriptions and two drawings. No\r\nspecimens existing.\r\n\r\nThis bird became extinct between the years 1735 and 1801, because in the\r\nlatter year Monsieur Bory St. Vincent made his scientific survey of the\r\nIsland, and no such bird existed then; while we know that Monsieur de la\r\nBourdonnaye, who was governor of the Mascarene Islands from 1735 to 1746,\r\nsent one alive to one of the directors of the French East Indian Company.\r\nOf this, the second living specimen brought to Europe, we unfortunately\r\nhave neither drawing nor history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Explanation of Plates.\r\n\r\n_Plate 25._\r\n\r\n    Drawing of White Dodo from Pierre Witthoos' picture, the bill and tail\r\n    being reconstructed from the model of the common Dodo.\r\n\r\n_Plate 25 (a)._\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 5._ Outline of figure of White Dodo in the picture by Pieter\r\n    Witthoos circa 1670 vide supra.\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 8._ Outline of Woodcut in Zaagman's edition of Bontekoe van\r\n    Hoorn, 1646.\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 7._ Outline of figure of White Dodo in an edition of Plinius\r\n    Secundus about 1643 but without date.\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 4._ Outline of Dr. H.

(Dubois) gave to the Bourbon Dodo in 1674. This is the original\r\ndescription:--\r\n\r\n\"The feathers of the males are of a brown-grey colour, the feet and beak\r\nare like a turkey's, but a little more crooked. They have scarce any tail,\r\nbut their hind part covered with feathers is roundish, like the crupper of\r\na hare. They are taller than turkeys. Their neck is straight, and a little\r\nlonger in proportion than a turkey's when it lifts up his head. Its eye is\r\nblack and lively, and its head without comb on cop. They never fly, their\r\nwings are too little to support the weight of their bodies; they serve only\r\nto beat themselves and flutter when they call one another. They will whirl\r\nabout for twenty or thirty times together on the same side during the space\r\nof 4 or 5 minutes. The motions of their wings make then a noise very like\r\nthat of a rattle, and one may hear it two hundred paces off. The bone of\r\ntheir {178} wings grows greater towards the extremity, and forms a little\r\nround mass under the feathers as big as a musket ball. That and its beak\r\nare the chief defences of this bird. 'Tis very hard to catch in the woods,\r\nbut easy in open places, because we run faster than they, and sometimes we\r\napproach them without much trouble. From March to September they are very\r\nfat, and taste admirably well, especially while they are young, some of the\r\nmales weigh 45 pounds. The females are wonderfully beautiful, some fair,\r\nsome brown. I call them fair, because they are the colour of fair hair;\r\nthey have a sort of peak like a widow's, upon their breasts, which is of a\r\ndun colour. No one feather is straggling from the other all over their\r\nbodies, they being very careful to adjust themselves, and make them all\r\neven with their beaks. The feathers on their thighs are round like shells\r\nat the end, and being there very thick, have an agreeable effect. They have\r\ntwo risings on their craws, and the feathers are whiter there than the\r\nrest, which livelily represents the fine neck of a beautiful woman. They\r\nwalk with so much stateliness and good grace that one cannot help admiring\r\nthem and loving them, by which means their fine mien often saves their\r\nlives.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Solitaires, owing to the depredations by the pigs and\r\nmonkeys introduced by the settlers, and the unceasing slaughter by the\r\nlatter, became extinct between the years 1760 and 1780.\r\n\r\nOf their habits we only have the accounts of Leguat:--\r\n\r\n\"Though these birds will sometimes very familiarly come up near enough to\r\none, when we do not run after them, yet they will never grow tame, as soon\r\nas they are caught they shed tears, without crying, and refuse all manner\r\nof sustenance till they die.\r\n\r\nWhen these birds build their nests, they choose a clean place, gather\r\ntogether some palm leaves for that purpose, and heap them up a foot and a\r\nhalf high from the ground, on which they sit. They never lay but one egg,\r\nwhich is much bigger than that of a goose. The male and female both cover\r\nit in their turns, and the young is not hatched till at 7 weeks end. All\r\nthe while they are sitting upon it, or are bringing up their young one,\r\nwhich is not able to provide for itself in several months, they will not\r\nsuffer any other bird of their species to come within two hundred yards\r\nround of the place. But what is very singular is, the males will never\r\ndrive away the females, only when they perceive one they make a noise with\r\ntheir wings to call their own female--she drives away the unwelcome\r\nstranger, not leaving it till it was without her bounds. The female does\r\nthe same as to males, which she leaves to the male who drives them away. We\r\nhave observed this several times, and I {179} affirm it to be true. The\r\ncombats between them on this occasion last sometimes pretty long, because\r\nthe stranger only turns about, and does not fly directly from the nest.\r\nHowever, the others do not forsake it till they have quite driven it out of\r\ntheir limits. After these birds have raised their young one, and left it to\r\nitself, they are always together, which the other birds are not, and though\r\nthey happen to mingle with other birds of the same species, these two\r\ncompanions never disunite.\r\n\r\nWe have often remarked, that some days after the young one leaves the nest,\r\na company of 30 or 40 bring another young one to it, and the new fledged\r\nbird, joining the band with its father and mother, they march to some bye\r\nplace. We frequently followed them, and found that afterwards the old ones\r\nwent each their way alone, or in couples, and left the two young ones\r\ntogether, which we called a marriage.\"\r\n\r\nLeguat's, d'Heguerty's, and the Abbé Pingré's descriptions were all we had\r\nof this great ground pigeon down to 1866, except a few bones. When Mr.\r\nStrickland proved its distinctness from the Dodo of Mauritius in 1844, and\r\nup to 1852, these bones numbered 18. In 1864 Mr. E. Newton and Captain\r\nBarclay got 3 more bones, in 1865 Mr. Jenner, the resident magistrate,\r\ncollected 8 bones, and in 1866 nearly 2,000 bones were collected, but\r\nduring the Transit of Venus expedition in 1874, a thorough search was made,\r\nand a number of complete skeletons was collected.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Island of Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nRepresented in Museums by a number of complete skeletons and a large number\r\nof bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Explanation of Plates.\r\n\r\n_Plate 23._\r\n\r\n    Coloured drawing made from Leguat's description and figure.\r\n\r\n_Plate 25 (a)._\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 1._ Outline of figure in Leguat's Voyage, 1708.\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 2._ Outline of Schlegel's reconstructed figure of the Solitaire,\r\n    1854.\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 3._ Outline of Solitaire in Frontispiece to Leguat's Voyage,\r\n    1708.\r\n\r\n{181}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TYMPANUCHUS CUPIDO (L.)\r\n\r\n                                HEATH HEN.\r\n\r\n    _Tetrao cupido_ Linnaeus, Syst.

He specially mentions that the\r\nneck-tufts are composed of five feathers, and in his figure they are shown\r\nto be much pointed. Catesby expressly states that he does not know exactly\r\nfrom which part of America his specimen came--yet Linnaeus says \"Habitat in\r\nVirginia.\"\r\n\r\nFormerly the Heath Hen inhabited New England and part of the Middle States\r\n(Southern Connecticut, Long Island, New Jersey, Nantucket, Eastern\r\nPennsylvania), but in 1887 Ridgway stated already that it was then\r\napparently extinct, except on Martha's Vineyard. About that time it was\r\nstill common on that island, inhabiting the woods and chiefly haunting oak\r\nscrub and feeding on acorns. They were then \"strictly protected by law,\"\r\nbut this protection seems not to have been effectual, as from 1893 to 1897\r\na number were killed, skinned, and sold to various museums. This was,\r\nperhaps, fortunate rather than unfortunate, because Mr. Hoyle (the man who\r\ncollected them) told us that in 1894 a fire destroyed many of them, and in\r\nthe fall of 1897 they were practically gone. But almost worse than this,\r\nperhaps, two pairs of \"Prairie Chicken\" (_Tympanuchus americanus_) were\r\nliberated and broods of young (of the latter apparently) were seen, so that\r\nit {182} is to be feared that birds shot now on Martha's Vineyards Island\r\nmay have blood of _T. americanus_ in them, the two forms being closely\r\nrelated, somewhat difficult to distinguish, and evidently sub-species of\r\neach other. Nevertheless, a bird taken in 1901 was pronounced to be typical\r\n_cupido_ by Mr. Brewster.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it is pretty clear that the Heath Hen is among the birds\r\nthe fate of which is sealed, and which, if not already exterminated or\r\nmixed with foreign blood, will soon have disappeared.

International Ornithological Congress, p. 203, is\r\nherewith corrected.\r\n\r\n{183}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   COTURNIX NOVAEZELANDIAE QUOY & GAIM.\r\n\r\n                           (PLATE 28, FIG. 2.)\r\n\r\n    _Coturnix Novae-Zelandiae_ Quoy and Gaimard, Voy. Astrolabe, Zool. I.\r\n    p. 242, pl. 24, fig. 1 (1830--\"Il habit la baie Chouraki (rivière\r\n    Tamise de Cook), à la Nouvelle-Zélande\"); Gould, Syn. B.

The male has the upper-side almost black, each feather\r\nbordered and indistinctly barred with rufous-brown, and with a wide, creamy\r\nwhite shaft-line. The throat and sides of the head are rufous-cinnamon, the\r\nfeathers of the chest and breast at their basal half buff with a broken\r\nblack cross-bar, the distal half black, with two pale buff spots near the\r\ntip, or with a continuous white border.\r\n\r\nThis sole representative of the \"gamebirds\" in New Zealand was in former\r\ndays very numerous in both islands, but especially so in the South Island,\r\nwherever there was open grass-land, but is now evidently extinct. Its\r\ndisappearance is apparently not due to excessive shooting, but rather to\r\nthe introduction of rats, cats, and dogs, and last, but not least, to\r\nbush-fires and to the regular burning of the sheep-runs, according to Sir\r\nWalter Buller. No doubt the establishment itself of extensive sheep-farms\r\nin the once, more or less, uninhabited grass-land was ominous for the\r\nfuture of the Quail.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite clear when the Quail disappeared. The last on the North\r\nIsland was shot by Captain Mair at Whangarei in 1860. Specimens were\r\nrecorded in 1867 and 1869, but were apparently not procured. In Haast's\r\n\"Journal of Exploration in the Nelson Province\" it is said to be still very\r\nabundant in 1861 on the grassy plains of the interior.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Buller mentions two specimens said to be from an island in Blue\r\nSkin Bay, shot in \"1867 or 1868.\" In his Second Edition of the Birds of New\r\nZealand he informs us that it was found occasionally in the South Island\r\ndown to 1875, but in the \"Supplement\" he speaks of a specimen said to have\r\nbeen shot in 1871, but adds, \"There is no absolute evidence of it,\" and \"if\r\ntrue, this individual bird must have been about the last of its race.\"\r\nTherefore, evidently the note about 1875 was erroneous. {184}\r\n\r\nThe statement of Mr. Cheeseman, that he took eggs on Three Kings Islands is\r\nerroneous. The eggs belonged to a _Synoecus_, and the egg given to Sir\r\nWalter Buller is now in my collection.\r\n\r\nI have, however, also two eggs of _Coturnix novaezealandiae_, brought home\r\nby Dr. H. O. Forbes. They have a brownish-white shell, covered and washed\r\nall over with deep brown patches and lighter brown underlying markings.\r\nThey show distinctly the character of Quails' eggs, but, besides being much\r\nlarger, are easily distinguished from eggs of _Coturnix coturnix_. They\r\nmeasure 34.3 by 25 and 34.5 by 21.3 mm.\r\n\r\nOf birds I have in my collection: One [male] ad. Shot at Whangarei, North\r\nIsland, by Major Mair, in 1860. (This is the specimen figured in the Second\r\nEdition of the \"Birds of New Zealand.\" I bought it with Sir Walter Buller's\r\ncollection eighteen years ago. By a curious _lapsus memoriae_ Sir Walter\r\nBuller, in the \"Supplement,\" p. 35, in 1905, states that this bird was in\r\nhis son's collection.) One [female] ad. and one [male] in the first year's\r\nplumage, shot by Messrs. Walter Buller and E. French near Kaiapoi, South\r\nIsland, in the summer of 1859.\r\n\r\nSeven specimens are in the British Museum, the types in Paris, three in\r\nCambridge, a pair in Christchurch in New Zealand, some in the Canterbury\r\nMuseum, and doubtless many others, most of which have never been recorded.\r\n\r\n{185}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DINORNITHIDAE.\r\n\r\n                                  MOAS.\r\n\r\nThe first announcement of the former existence of large Struthious birds in\r\nNew Zealand was made by Mr. J. S. Polack in 1838. In his book _New\r\nZealand_, he states that he found large bird bones near East Cape in the\r\nNorth Island. The first specimen, however, that came into the hands of a\r\nscientific man was the bone sent to Professor Owen in 1839 by Mr. Rule, who\r\nreported that the natives had told him that it was the bone of a large\r\nEagle which they called \"_Movie_.\" Professor Owen, with his extraordinary\r\nknowledge, at once saw that far from any connection with the _Raptores_,\r\nMr. Rule's bone was a portion of a femur of a gigantic Struthious bird. He\r\ndescribed it on November 12th, 1839, at a meeting of the Zoological\r\nSociety, and it was figured on Plate 3 of Volume III of the Transactions of\r\nthe Zoological Society.\r\n\r\nThe next notice of the Moas takes the form of a letter, received by\r\nProfessor Owen from the Rev. W. C. Cotton, dated Waimate, near the Bay of\r\nIslands, New Zealand, July 11th, 1842; and in it the writer gives an\r\naccount of his meeting with the Rev. Mr. Wm. Williams, a fellow missionary\r\nat East Cape. The latter had collected a lot of \"Moa\" bones and sent them\r\nto a Dr. Buckland. Mr. Williams also reported a conversation with two\r\nEnglishmen, who declared they had been taken out by a native at night and\r\nhad seen a Moa alive, but had been too frightened to shoot it.\r\n\r\nOn January 24th, 1843, Professor Owen exhibited a number of bones from Mr.\r\nWilliams' collection, and described them, giving the bird the name of\r\n\"_Megalornis novaezealandiae_,\" afterwards changing the generic title into\r\n_Dinornis_, as _Megalornis_ was preoccupied. Afterwards, when describing\r\nthese bones and those contained in the second box of Mr. Williams'\r\ncollection more fully, he somewhat inconsistently changed the specific name\r\nto _struthioides_, which Captain Hutton, in his later classification,\r\nretained. Following the laws of priority, however (_novaezealandiae_ has 10\r\nmonths' priority over _struthioides_), we must reinstate the name\r\n_novaezealandiae_.\r\n\r\nA number of other finds occurred between 1842 and 1847, but by far the\r\nlargest and most important collections were made and sent home between 1847\r\nand 1852 by the Hon. W. Mantell, who sent to Professor Owen many hundreds\r\nof bones and eggshells, from which the Professor was enabled to determine\r\nand describe a large number of species, and even as early as this to\r\nseparate some genera. {186}\r\n\r\nThe bulk of later finds were made by Sir Julius von Haast, Captain Hutton,\r\nand Mr. Aug. Hamilton, and the two most famous deposits were Glenmark Swamp\r\nand Te Aute; but it would take too much space to give here an account of\r\nall the other extraordinary discoveries of Moa deposits made by such men as\r\nDr. Thomson, Mr. Earl, Mr. Thorne, Dr. H. O. Forbes, and many others.\r\nBesides many fragments of eggshell, a number of eggs have been found, which\r\nwill be enumerated elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFeathers have been found at Clutha River, near Roxburgh, and also in caves\r\nnear Queenstown. Those from Clutha are mostly dark, being black with white\r\ntips; while the Queenstown ones resemble feathers of _Apteryx australis_ in\r\ncolours. Professor Owen has shown that _Megalapteryx huttoni_ was feathered\r\ndown to the toes, and in the plate I have represented it clothed with\r\nfeathers similar to the Clutha ones, which I believe belong to this\r\nspecies. The Moas at one time must have been extraordinarily numerous, both\r\nin numbers and species, and they varied in height from 2½ feet to 12 feet.\r\nProfessor Parker has shown that some of the species had crests of long\r\nfeathers on the head, and, as some adult skulls of the same forms show no\r\nsigns of this, he infers that the males alone had this appendage. There has\r\nbeen much discussion as to the time when the Moas became extinct, and we\r\nknow for certain that the two species, _Dinornis maximus_ and\r\n_Anomalopteryx antiquus_, belong to a much earlier geological epoch than\r\nthe bulk of the other species. It would be too lengthy for my purpose to go\r\ninto the arguments, but we can, by the study of the \"_kitchen middens_\" of\r\nMaoris and their traditions, fairly adduce that the Maoris arrived in the\r\nNorth Island some 600 years ago, that they hunted Moas, and that they\r\nexterminated them about 100 to 150 years after their arrival. In the South,\r\nor rather Central, Island, the Maoris appear to have arrived about 100\r\nyears later, and to have exterminated the Moas about 350 years ago. It is\r\nonly fair to say, however, that Monsieur de Quatrefages adduces evidence in\r\nhis paper which goes far to prove that Moas existed down to the end of the\r\n18th or even beginning of the 19th century in those parts of the Middle\r\nIsland not, or scantily, inhabited by Maoris.\r\n\r\nThe _Dinornithidae_ form a separate group of the order _Ratitae_, in no way\r\nclosely related to the Australian Emu (_Dromaius_), as many ornithologists\r\nhave asserted, but nearer to the South American Nandu (_Rhea_) than any\r\nother living _Ratitae_, though exhibiting many characters in common with\r\nthe _Apterygidae_. There have been a number of classifications set up of\r\nthis family. The first by Reichenbach, in 1850, with 7 species and 7\r\ngenera! {187} The next was by Von Haast, in 1873, who enumerated 10\r\nspecies, divided into 4 genera. The third was Lydekker's, in 1891, who\r\nacknowledged 23 species, divided into 5 genera. Then came Hutton's, in\r\n1892, which left out _Megalapteryx_, with its then known 2 species, and\r\nacknowledged 26 species, divided into 7 genera. Lastly we have Professor\r\nParker's, in 1895, in which again _Megalapteryx_ is left out, and 21\r\nspecies are acknowledged, divided into 5 genera. There has been a great\r\namount of controversy as to the number of species of Moas which really\r\nought to be distinguished, and of late years there has been a tendency to\r\nunite most of the species as synonyms, the authors declaring that bones\r\nvary to such a degree that all the characters relied on for the\r\ndistinguishing of the various species were individual variations, and that,\r\nbesides, it was impossible that so many distinct forms could have occurred\r\nin such a small area. The extreme of this lumping was reached when\r\nProfessor Forbes, in the Bulletin of the Liverpool Museums, III, pp. 27 and\r\n28 (1900), divided the Moas into six genera, each with a single species. He\r\nthus ignores the fact that by doing so he has united forms which were\r\nfounded on FULLY ADULT bones, and yet some of them were only about half or\r\ntwo-thirds the size of the others. I personally think that too many species\r\nhave been made, and at least 7 of Captain Hutton's forms must be sunk. On\r\nthe other hand some have been described since 1895 and 1900, and I have\r\nbeen obliged to name others rather against my will, so that in spite of\r\nuniting so many species of others I find I am obliged to acknowledge more\r\nspecies than anyone else. I have divided these into genera according to\r\nProfessor Parker's classification, only adding _Palaeocasuarius_ of Forbes,\r\nwith 3 species, and _Megalapteryx_, with 5, which brings my number up to 38\r\nspecies, divided into 7 genera. My reasons for not uniting these into 7\r\nspecies and 7 genera, as those of the \"lumping school\" do, are\r\ntwofold,--first, the bones of the _Ratitae_ are much more solid than those\r\nof other birds, and are not given to so much individual variation; and,\r\nsecondly, in the face of the great number of species of Paradise Birds and\r\nCassowaries found on New Guinea, the contention that there could not be so\r\nmany species of Moa on so small an area is not easily maintained. Moreover,\r\nwe have strong support in the present fauna and flora for the presumption\r\nthat, when the Moas first came into existence and differentiated into\r\nspecies, New Zealand was a much larger area, stretching at least from the\r\nMacquarie Islands in the south to the Kermadecs in the north, and from Lord\r\nHowe's Island on the west to the Chatham Islands on the east. So that, like\r\nthe giant tortoises on the Galápagos Islands, {188} they only got driven so\r\nclosely together after their specific differentiation, when the land\r\ngradually subsided, owing to volcanic action. The differentiation of the\r\nfamily is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                              DINORNITHIDAE.\r\n\r\nSkull with a short and wide beak. Pectoral girdle very small or absent,\r\nwing absent, only an indication in _Dinornis dromioides_. Hallux absent or\r\npresent. An extension bridge to the tibio-tarsus, which is placed near the\r\ninner border of the bone. No superior notch to the sternum. Most of the\r\nspecies of very large size. The tarso-metatarsus is either long and slender\r\nor short and wide, and its anterior surface may or may not be grooved. The\r\nsecond trochlea is longer than the fourth, the third is not pedunculated,\r\nand there is no perforation in the groove between the third and fourth\r\ntrochlea. In the tibio-tarsus the cnemial crest rises well above the head;\r\nthe extensor groove is separated by a considerable interval from the inner\r\nborder of the bone. There is a well-defined intercondylar tubercle; the\r\nintercondylar gorge is deep, and there is no deep pit on the lateral\r\nsurface of the entocondyle. The femur may be either slender or stout, but\r\nis not markedly curved forwards. The popliteal depression is deep, and the\r\nsummit of the great trochanter rises considerably above the level of the\r\nhead. The pelvis approximates to that of the _Apterygidae_, but the\r\npectineal process of the pubis is less developed, and the ischium and pubis\r\nmay be longer and more slender. The coracoid and scapula are aborted and\r\nmay be absent. The sternum, which may be either long and narrow, or broad\r\nand short, differs from that of the _Apterygidae_ by the absence of the\r\nsuperior notch, the divergent lateral processes, and the reduction of the\r\ncoracoidal grooves to small facets or their total disappearance. The\r\ncervical vertebrae are relatively short, an expanded neural platform as far\r\nas the sixth.\r\n\r\nIn _Anomalopteryx_ and _Megalapteryx_ the number of cervical vertebrae is\r\n21, and there are 2 cervico-dorsal and 4 free dorsal vertebrae, so it is\r\nfair to assume that this is the correct number throughout the family.\r\n\r\nThe feathers had after-shafts.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERA ARE AS FOLLOWS:\r\n\r\n    _Dinornis_ Owen.\r\n  _Palapteryx_ Owen, part.\r\n  _Palapteryx_ Hutton.\r\n  _Tylapteryx_ Hutton.\r\n\r\n    _Megalapteryx_ Haast.\r\n  _Anomalopteryx_ Lydekker, part.\r\n  *_Mesopteryx_ Hutton.\r\n\r\n  {189}\r\n    _Cela_ Reichenbach.\r\n  _Dinornis_ Owen, part.\r\n  _Meionornis_ Haast.\r\n  _Anomalopteryx_ Lydekker.\r\n  _Mesopteryx_ Parker.\r\n\r\n    _Emeus_ Reichenbach.\r\n  _Euryapteryx_ Haast.\r\n  _Syornis_ Hutton.\r\n  _Dinornis_ Owen, part.\r\n\r\n    _Pachyornis_ Lydekker.\r\n  _Palapteryx_ Haast.\r\n  _Dinornis_ Owen, part.\r\n  _Euryapteryx_ Hutton.\r\n\r\n    _Palaeocasuarius_ Forbes.\r\n  *_Megalapteryx_ Forbes, part.\r\n\r\n    _Anomalopteryx_ Reichenbach.\r\n  _Meionornis_ Haast.\r\n  _Dinornis_ Owen, part.\r\n\r\nI have adopted Professor Parker's classification in the genera, only\r\nsubstituting _Cela_ Reichenbach for _Mesapteryx_ Hutton, which is a synonym\r\nof _Megalapteryx_ Haast. As to the species I have used my own judgment; I\r\nfelt obliged to name a number of species acknowledged by Parker and\r\nLydekker but not named, because this system of indicating species by the\r\nletters A, B, C, &c., which has crept into our nomenclature, will make all\r\nunderstanding impossible, as not always the same species is denoted by the\r\nsame letter. A few of these species will naturally later have to be sunk,\r\nas some have been founded on skulls and others on leg bones, or so, which,\r\nwhen we get perfect individual skeletons may prove to be identical, but I\r\ndo not think these will be many.\r\n\r\nBesides a number of imperfect eggs, particulars of which will be found in\r\nDr. A. B. Meyer's article in the Ibis, 1903, pp. 188-196, there are known\r\ntwo perfect Moa eggs and one almost perfect one.\r\n\r\n    1. Otago Museum.

Breadth at the squamosals twice the height at\r\nbasi-temporal. It has a flattened frontal region, and a wide median ridge\r\non the upper surface of the praemaxillae. The mandible is in the form of a\r\nnarrow U, with the angle much inflected, no distinct anticular process, and\r\nthe symphysis moderately wide, narrowing anteriorly, with a prominent and\r\nbroad inferior ridge, widest in front. The quadrate is elongated, with a\r\nvery large pneumatic foramen. The sternum is nearly as long as broad, very\r\nconvex, with distinct coracoidal facets, 3 costal articulations, very small\r\nand reflected costal processes, the lateral processes very broad and widely\r\ndivergent, and a wide xiphisternal notch. The pelvis is narrow with a high\r\nilium, in which the inferior border of the postacetabular portion is flat,\r\nand does not descend as a sharp ridge below the level of the anterior\r\npostacetabular vertebrae. The pubis has a small pectineal process; and the\r\nventral aspect of the true and postacetabular vertebrae is very broad and\r\nmuch flattened.\r\n\r\nThe distal extremity of the tibio-tarsus is not inflected. A hallux is\r\npresent in some species. The tibio-tarsus and tarso-metatarsus are long and\r\nslender, the length of the latter equalling and more often exceeding the\r\nlength of the femur, and also exceeding half the length of the\r\ntibio-tarsus. The femur is comparatively long and slender, with a short\r\nneck, the head rising but slightly and projecting only a small distance,\r\nthe linear aspera in the form of a long irregular line, the outer side of\r\nthe distal extremity moderately expanded, the popliteal depression small,\r\ndeep, and sharply defined, the profile of the inner condyle semi-ovoid and\r\nnarrow, and the interior trochlear surface nearly flat. The phalangeals of\r\nthe pes are long and comparatively slender, the proximal surface of the\r\nterminal segments not being trefoil-shaped. In the vertebral column the\r\nmiddle cervicals are long and narrow, with the postzygapophyses directed\r\nmuch outwardly and separated by a very deep channel, and the posterior face\r\nof the centrum low and wide. The dorsals have short transverse processes\r\nand neural spine, the anterior and middle ones (those with a haemal spine\r\nor carina) having a large anterior pneumatic foramen between the nib-facet,\r\nthe foramen being triangular in shape. All the species of this genus are of\r\ncomparatively large size, and include the tallest members of the family.\r\n\r\nType of the genus: _Dinornis novaezealandiae_ (Owen).\r\n\r\nNumber of species: 7. {192}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DINORNIS MAXIMUS OWEN.\r\n\r\n    _Dinornis maximus_ Owen, Trans.

The\r\ntype skull of _P. robustus_ came from Timaru, the type of _firmus_ from\r\nWanganui, that of _ingens_ from Poverty Bay, while that of _potens_ is\r\nquoted from the East side of Middle Island, without specific type locality.\r\n\r\nHabitat: North and Middle Islands.\r\n\r\nThe plate of this species was reconstructed by Mr. Frohawk from the\r\nskeleton and feathers in my museum, and the feathers found with the\r\nskeleton now in the York Museum. The only criticism that might be made in\r\nconnection with this picture is that the feathers are drawn a little too\r\nmuch like those of _Apteryx australis_, but this is not of any consequence,\r\nas the Moa feathers in the Tring Museum and elsewhere vary considerably in\r\nappearance, though being more or less coloured like _Apteryx_ feathers.\r\n\r\nThere is an almost perfect skeleton in the Tring Museum. {194}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DINORNIS GRACILIS OWEN.\r\n\r\n    _Dinornis gracilis_ Owen, Trans.

The type\r\ncame from Poverty Bay, but the bird inhabits both islands.\r\n\r\nThis species had wings.\r\n\r\nHabitat: New Zealand.\r\n\r\nA nearly perfect skeleton in the Tring Museum from Waitomo district,\r\nAuckland, New Zealand.\r\n\r\n{195}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MEGALAPTERYX HAAST.\r\n\r\nOriginally distinguished by Haast from the _Dinornithidae_ as an ancient\r\nform of the _Apterygidae_, but afterwards united by Lydekker with the\r\n_Dinornithidae_. Mr. Lydekker's diagnosis of the genus is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Distinguished from _Dinornis_ by the extreme slenderness and length of the\r\nfemur and tibio-tarsus, and the relatively shorter tarso-metatarsus, of\r\nwhich latter the length is considerably shorter than that of the femur. The\r\npelvis is much narrower than in Dinornis, with the ventral surface of the\r\npostacetabular sacrals ridged and narrower, and a more developed pectineal\r\nprocess to the pubis. The femur is markedly curved forwards, with the\r\ndistal extremity moderately expanded, the popliteal depression larger and\r\nless defined, the linea aspera narrower and sharper, and a more distinct\r\nanterior intermuscular ridge.\"\r\n\r\nThe following additional diagnostic characters are taken from Mr. Charles\r\nW. Andrews' description of the complete skeleton of _Megalapteryx tenuipes_\r\nin the Tring Museum (Nov. Zool. IV, pp. 188-194, fig. 1-2 in text and pl.\r\nVI):--\r\n\r\nWidth of cranium at paroccipital processes less than half the length of the\r\nbasis cranii. Length of premaxilla less than two-and-a-half times that of\r\nthe basis cranii. Body of the premaxilla pointed and slightly decurved; its\r\nlength and breadth less than the basis cranii. The occipital plane slightly\r\ndeclined backwards. Occipital condyle projecting slightly beyond the\r\nparoccipital processes. Anterior and posterior lambdoidal ridges separated\r\nby a very narrow interval in their middle region only. Width at squamosals\r\nslightly more than double the length of the basis cranii. Mammillary\r\ntuberosities not very prominent. Margin of tympanic cavity evenly curved.\r\nTemporal fossae very large. The distance between the temporal ridges about\r\nfour-fifths the width of the cranium at the fossae. The posterior temporal\r\nridge confluent with the lambdoidal ridge. Post-temporal fossae very large.\r\n\r\nThe inferior temporal ridge is strongly marked, and there is a pretympanic\r\nprocess. The zygomatic process is well developed. Rostrum dilated towards\r\nits anterior end, compressed and carinate beneath the large presphenoid\r\nfossae. Mandible very slender. Posterior angular process small. Sternum\r\nvery convex, and with a very nearly straight anterior border between the\r\ntuberosities for the coracoscapular ligaments. Costal processes short but\r\nlarge, with distinct {196} coracoidal facets. The lateral processes are\r\nlong and distally expanded. The sternum is just as wide as it is long.\r\nThere are three costal articulations. The most notable character is the\r\nenormous length of the toes, the middle one being longer than the\r\ntarso-metatarsus. The ungual phalanges are peculiarly long, narrow and\r\ncurved, instead of being comparatively short and broad, as in most other\r\nMoas.\r\n\r\nType of the genus _Megalapteryx hectori_, Haast.\r\n\r\nNumber of species 4. {197}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MEGALAPTERYX HECTORI HAAST.\r\n\r\n    _Megalapteryx hectori_ Haast, Trans.

There is, however, no doubt\r\nnow, since the skulls of _Megalapteryx_ are known, that although\r\nsufficiently aberrant to form a distinct sub-family, the birds included in\r\nthis genus are _Dinornithidae_ and not _Apterygidae_.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Middle Island, New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MEGALAPTERYX HAMILTONI SPEC.

Its distal width is about\r\none-ninth of its length, while in _M. hectori_ it is about one-seventh. The\r\nlength of the tibio-tarsus is approximately 0.405 mm. = 16 inches, and\r\nwidth of distal extremity about 0.044 = 1.74 inches.

XXIV, p. 129 (1892).\r\n\r\nThe synonymy of this form is somewhat confused, but I think it is clear\r\nthat _huttonii_ of Owen is its proper name. Professor Owen (Ext. B. p. 430)\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"In the collection from the Glenmark Swamp, South Island, are bones that\r\nscarcely differ, save in size, from the dimensions (? W.R.) of the type\r\nbones of _Dinornis didiformis_ from the NORTH ISLAND. They are noted as of\r\na large variety of that species.\" Captain Hutton remarks: \"The bones that I\r\nhave arranged under the name _D. didiformis_ belong probably to a new\r\nspecies. The tibia is well marked and quite distinct, but the femur and\r\nmetatarsus, that I have associated with it, pass almost into _D.\r\ncasuarinus_, but are rather smaller. _D. casuarinus_ is undoubtedly a good\r\nspecies, easily distinguished by its tibia.\" Possibly the _Dinornis_ of the\r\nSOUTH ISLAND, with the tibia characteristic of _D. didiformis_ of the NORTH\r\nISLAND, may need to be noted for the convenience of naming the bones as\r\n_Dinornis huttonii_.\r\n\r\nWhen describing his _D. didinus_, Professor Owen failed to recognise its\r\nidentity with his previously named _D. huttonii_, doubtless owing to the\r\nleg bones being hidden by the dry integument. This being the case, it is\r\nnecessary to reinstate the name _huttonii_, as it has four years' priority\r\nover _didinus_.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hutton says that a few bones of this form have been obtained in the\r\nNorth Island at Poverty Bay and Te Aute; but I am convinced he is in error\r\nand that these bones are aberrant individual bones of _A. didiformis_ and\r\nthat _M. huttonii_ is confined to the South or rather Middle Island. The\r\nplate of this species has been reconstructed by Mr. Lodge from the\r\nmummified remains which form the type specimen of _Didornis didinus_, and\r\nthe feathers found in the alluvial sands of the CLUTHA RIVER. The type of\r\n_Dinornis didinus_ was found at Queenstown by Mr. Squires.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Middle Island, New Zealand.\r\n\r\nMr. C. W. Andrews, in his description of my complete skeleton of\r\n_Megalapteryx tenuipes_ has shown that Owen's type specimens of his\r\n_Dinornis didinus_ are certainly of a species of the genus _Megalapteryx_,\r\nand closely {200} allied to _M. tenuipes_. Mr. Andrews, however, throws\r\nsome doubt as to whether the pelvis and femora, referred to this species by\r\nHutton, really belong to it.\r\n\r\nA complete egg which I consider must be of this species is preserved in the\r\nTring Museum. Its measurements are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Large circumference, 21.4 inches = 535 mm.\r\n  Small        \"       17.5   \"    = 437.5 mm.\r\n\r\nThis egg was dredged up on the Molyneux River, near Otago, during gold\r\ndredging operations in 1901; a second perfect egg was dredged up a few\r\nmonths before in the same river, and was referred by Dr. Benham to\r\n_Pachyornis ponderosus_.\r\n\r\n{201}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ANOMALOPTERYX REICHENBACH.\r\n\r\nThe skull is narrow and vaulted, with a long, sharp and slightly deflected\r\nbeak. Breadth at the squamosals 1½ times the height at basi-temporal, which\r\nhas a constricted praemaxillary ridge, and the quadrate with a very small\r\npneumatic foramen. The mandible is V-shaped, with a slight inflection of\r\nthe angle, and a distinct postarticular process. The symphysis is very\r\nnarrow and pointed, with a long and narrow inferior ridge, not expanding\r\nmarkedly at either extremity. The sternum is longer, flatter and narrower\r\nthan in _Dinornis_, having no distinct xiphisternal notch, three costal\r\narticulations, long and narrow costal processes, slender lateral processes\r\nwhich are often elongated, and usually no coracoidal facets. The pelvis is\r\nwider and lower than in _Dinornis_, with the lower border of the\r\npostacetabular portion of the ilium descending as a sharp ridge much below\r\nthe level of the sacral ribs, and without any distinct pectineal process. A\r\nhallux is present. The tibio-tarsus and tarso-metatarsus are relatively\r\nshorter and stouter than in _Dinornis_, the latter being shorter than the\r\nfemur, which is usually stouter and relatively shorter than in\r\n_Megalapteryx_. The length of the tarso-metatarsus is less than half that\r\nof the tibio-tarsus. The femur, besides being usually relatively shorter is\r\nreadily distinguished from that of _Dinornis_ by its more expanded\r\nextremities, the rather longer neck, and the much larger and ill-defined\r\npopliteal depression.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are of the general type of those of _Pachyornis_, but the\r\nanterior pneumatic foramen commences in the third dorsal. The phalangeals\r\nare intermediate between those of _Dinornis_ and _Pachyornis_. Haast\r\nconsidered that the coracoid was aborted and often absent in this genus, in\r\n_Emeus_, and _Pachyornis_. As additional characters of the skull it may be\r\nmentioned that there is a prominent supra-occipital protuberance, and a\r\ndepression on the squamosal above the quadrate; the par-occipital processes\r\nare pointed, and the basi-occipital processes only slightly prominent; so\r\nthat the posterior profile of the basi-occipital is nearly straight. The\r\nquadrate has a very short anterior process.\r\n\r\nAll the species of the genus are small, in fact _parvus_ is the smallest\r\nbut one of the family.\r\n\r\nType of the genus: _Anomalopteryx didiformis_ (Owen).\r\n\r\nNumber of species: 4. {202}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ANOMALOPTERYX DIDIFORMIS (OWEN.)\r\n\r\n    _Dinornis didiformis_ Owen, Trans.

While referring my\r\nreaders to the original diagnosis for the specific characters, I wish to\r\nspecially draw attention to the fact that Dr. von Haast says that in the\r\ncollections he examined, made by Mr. Thorne and Mr. Cheeseman, there are\r\nbones belonging to at least 20 skeletons of his _D. oweni_, and that some\r\nwere even smaller than the type, and the only difference was the constant\r\naverage difference due to sex. I draw special notice to this, as Captain\r\nHutton has united this form with _curtus_, saying Haast's type is only a\r\nsmall individual of that species. The fact of bones of at least 20\r\ndifferent individuals, showing the same characters and the same differences\r\nfrom _curtus_, is quite sufficient evidence for me to consider Dr. von\r\nHaast's _D. oweni_ as a distinct species.

The mandible\r\nis in the shape of a wide U, with a slightly inflected angle, and a large\r\npost-articular process. The symphysis is very wide and deeply excavated,\r\nwith a broad and slightly prominent inferior ridge narrowing in front. The\r\nsternum resembles that of _Anomalopteryx_, but the pelvis is much wider and\r\napproaches that of _Pachyornis_. The tibio-tarsus and tarso-metatarsus are\r\nrelatively shorter and thicker than in _Anomalopteryx_, but less stout than\r\nin _Pachyornis_; the distal extremity of the tibio-tarsus is not inflected.\r\nA hallux is present. The length of the tarso-metatarsus is considerably\r\nless than that of the femur, and than half that of the tibio-tarsus, its\r\nwidth at the middle of the shaft being rather more than one-fourth of its\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are of the type of _Anomalopteryx_. The species are larger\r\nthan most of those of _Cela_ and _Anomalopteryx_. Additional cranial\r\ncharacters are that the skull usually has very broad and blunt paroccipital\r\nprocesses; there is no distinct supraoccipital prominence, and no\r\nwell-marked depression upon the frontal aspect of the squamosal above the\r\nhead of the quadrate. The basi-occipital tubercles are prominent, and give\r\nan arched posterior profile to this bone. The quadrate is elongated with a\r\nlong anterior bar; the cavity of the squamosal for the reception of its\r\nhead is inclined much more outwardly than in either of the other genera.\r\n\r\nType of genus: _Emeus crassus_ (Owen).\r\n\r\nNumber of species: 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          EMEUS CRASSUS (OWEN).\r\n\r\n    _Dinornis crassus_ Owen, Trans.

The skull, among other differences, has a very slight frontal\r\nrising to the cranial roof, as opposed to the very conspicuous one in the\r\nremaining species. The type is a nearly complete skeleton in the Wanganui\r\nMuseum. For full description see Hutton, l.c.\r\n\r\nHabitat: North Island, New Zealand.\r\n\r\n{213}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PACHYORNIS LYDEKKER.\r\n\r\nThe skull is either vaulted or flattened, with a sharp and narrow beak. The\r\nparoccipital processes are shorter and more rounded, and the basi-occipital\r\ntubercles more prominent than in _Anomalopteryx_, while the quadrate and\r\nmandible resemble the same bones in that genus somewhat closely. The\r\nsternum is flat and very broad and short, with no coracoidal facets, a very\r\nsmall xiphisternal notch, broad and short costal processes, and widely\r\ndivergent lateral processes; while there are only two costal articulations.\r\nThe pelvis is extremely low and wide, with the anterior wall of the\r\nacetabulum very deeply concave, the ventral surface of all the vertebrae\r\nbehind the true sacrals narrow and convex, and from which the very broad\r\nsacral ribs ascend to join the ilium, of which the inferior postacetabular\r\nborder is very sharp, and descends far below the level of the ribs. There\r\nis no pectineal process to the pubis. The tibio-tarsus is very short, with\r\nthe shaft curved outwards, the distal extremity markedly inflected, and the\r\nfibular ridge much shorter than in the other genera. The fibular border\r\nbelow the smooth space at the distal extremity of the fibular ridge is\r\nextremely rough; and the distal extensor tubercle is very prominent, being\r\nsituated partly on the line of the upper half of the extensor groove,\r\ninstead of being altogether external to the same.\r\n\r\nThe tarso-metatarsus is still shorter and wider than in _Emeus_, the width\r\nat the middle of the shaft being usually rather more than one third of the\r\nlength. The third trochlea is more prominent than in the other genera, and\r\nrises very abruptly from the shaft, the outer border of the anterior\r\nsurface usually expanding suddenly at the proximal extremity, and the outer\r\nridge of this surface being always more prominent than the inner, whereas\r\nin the other genera the opposite condition obtains. The femur, as compared\r\nwith that of _Dinornis_, is very much shorter and thicker, with a longer\r\nneck, and the head rising and projecting very considerably, the linea\r\naspera mainly forming a rough nodule near the distal end of the shaft, the\r\nouter surface of the distal extremity more suddenly expanded, and the\r\npopliteal depression larger, more open, and leading to the inner surface of\r\nthe shaft by a more distinct channel. The profile of the inner condyle is\r\nwider antero-posteriorly, and more rounded, the anterior intertrochlear\r\nsurface being deeply channelled.\r\n\r\nThe phalangeals of the pes are much shorter and stouter than in _Dinornis_,\r\nthe proximal surface of the terminal segments generally presenting a\r\ntrefoil-shaped contour. The length of the tarso-metatarsus is very much\r\n{214} less than half that of the tibio-tarsus. In the vertebral column the\r\ncervicals are short with very stout centra, the prezygopophyses in the\r\nmiddle region being nearly horizontal and separated from one another by a\r\nwide channel. The posterior face of the centra is tall and narrow, and the\r\nneural spines of the last two vertebrae much inclined forward. In the\r\ndorsals there is usually no anterior pneumatic foramen till the fourth (or\r\nthe last with a distinct haemal carina), this foramen being situated on the\r\nline of the anterior border of the rib-facet. The third and fourth dorsals\r\nare extremely compressed. Throughout the series also the neural spines and\r\ntransverse processes are comparatively long. Additional characters of the\r\nskull are that the sphenoidal rostrum is expanded in a lance-like shape at\r\nthe anterior extremity, in a manner unlike that of any of the other genera.\r\n\r\nThen the supraoccipital never has a very strongly developed median\r\nprominence, and the temporal fossae are comparatively short. The mandible\r\nmay be readily distinguished from that of the other genera by the low\r\nposition of the inner aperture of the dental canal, which pierces the bone\r\nobliquely to join the small lateral vacuity.\r\n\r\nType of the genus: _Pachyornis elephantopus_ (Owen).\r\n\r\nNumber of species: 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PACHYORNIS ELEPHANTOPUS (OWEN.)\r\n\r\n    _Dinornis elephantopus_ Owen, Trans.

Its living parallel to-day is _Casuarius philipi_\r\nRothschild, which, though by no means the tallest species of _Casuarius_,\r\nis the most bulky, and has the shortest and stoutest legs--the\r\ntarso-metatarsus is specially short and stout.\r\n\r\nThe type tarso-metatarsus measures 228 mm. = 8.9 inches, and in width\r\n(shaft) 84 mm. = 3.3 inches, while the type tarso-metatarsus of\r\n_elephantopus_ measures 239 mm. = 9.4 inches and 65 mm. = 2.55 inches.\r\n\r\nThe skull is much more depressed than in _elephantopus_ and with deeper\r\ntemporal fossae and a shorter post orbital region.\r\n\r\nType: No. A168 British Museum.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Middle Island, New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PACHYORNIS ROTHSCHILDI LYD.\r\n\r\n    _Pachyornis rothschildi_ Lydekker, P.Z.S. 1891, pp. 479-482, pl.\r\n    XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe bones in the Tring Museum, which form the type of this species,\r\nunfortunately have no history and their locality is unknown. It differs\r\nfrom the other species of the genus by the slenderer proportions of the\r\ntibio-tarsus, which is 22 inches long by 2.9 inches distal width, as\r\nopposed to 24 inches by 4.2 in _elephantopus_ and 20 inches by 3.5 in\r\n_ponderosus_, the two nearest in size.

N.Z. Inst. XXV, p. 11 (1893).\r\n\r\nDiffers from _ponderosus_ by having the great inward expansion at the\r\ndistal end of the tibio-tarsus. This expansion has induced some\r\nornithologists to separate the species of _Pachyornis_ into two\r\ngenera--_Euryapteryx_ and _Pachyornis_--but I do not think this expansion\r\nof sufficient importance to warrant generic separation.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Middle Island, New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PACHYORNIS VALGUS (HUTT.)\r\n\r\n    _Euryapteryx valgus_ Hutton, Trans.

The\r\ntarso-metatarsus is 8.5 inches = 216 mm. in length and the proximal width\r\n3.5 inches = 89 mm., and does not differ much from _crassus_ except in the\r\ngreat proximal width, necessary to articulate with the distal internal\r\nexpansion described above.\r\n\r\nThe type came from Enfield in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Middle Island, New Zealand. {217}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PACHYORNIS PYGMAEUS (HUTT.)\r\n\r\n    _Euryapteryx pygmaeus_ Hutton, Trans.

Dr.\r\nForbes has kindly placed these bones at my disposal, and the following\r\nsummarises the results of my examination. I find that Dr. Forbes' original\r\nidea as to the distinctness of _Palaeocasuarius_ is perfectly justified, as\r\nnot only are his characters of the tibio-tarsus, as opposed to those in the\r\nother genera, correct, but the proportions between femur, tibio-tarsus and\r\ntarso-metatarsus are quite different to those of other genera. I give the\r\nproportions of the three bones in _Palaeocasuarius elegans_, _Megalapteryx\r\ntenuipes_, and _Pachyornis elephantopus_, which are the three most nearly\r\nallied genera:\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+---------------+--------------+---------------\r\n                          | Pal. elegans. | M. tenuipes. | Pach.\r\n                          |               |              | elephantopus.\r\n  ------------------------+---------------+--------------+---------------\r\n  Femur, length           | 10-5/8 inches | 11    inches | 12    inches\r\n  Width over condyles     |  3½   \"    |  3½   \"   |  5       \"\r\n  Tibio-tarsus, length    | 16       \"    | 15½   \"   | 33       \"\r\n  Width at distal end     |  2       \"    |  2¼   \"   |  3½   \"\r\n  Tarso-metatarsus, length|  7       \"    |  6       \"   |  9       \"\r\n  Width at centre         |  1½   \"    |  1¼   \"   |  2¼   \"\r\n  ------------------------+---------------+--------------+---------------\r\n\r\nThe original diagnosis was as follows, being founded on the tibio-tarsus:\r\n\"The tibio-tarsus differs from that of all other genera in being straighter\r\nand less twisted on itself, so that the position of the ridge forming the\r\ninner wall of the groove for the tendons of the extensor muscles run along\r\nthe inner side of the bone as in _Casuarius_. As in the latter genus it\r\ntakes a marked turn inwards and backwards before joining the epicnemial\r\ncrest, while a line joining the centre point between the distal condyles\r\nand the epicnemial ridge leaves a considerable space between it and the\r\nwall of the groove. There is no intercondylar eminence in the intercondylar\r\nchannel, and the orifice of the extensor foramen opens more longitudinally\r\nthan in the other genera, and points downwards.\"\r\n\r\nType of the genus: _Palaeocasuarius haasti_ Forbes.\r\n\r\nNumber of species: 3.\r\n\r\nIn the following descriptions of the three species I only rely on the\r\nmeasurements of the femora, as not all the other leg bones of the three\r\nspecies are available. {220}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PALAEOCASUARIUS HAASTI FORBES.\r\n\r\n    _Palaeocasuarius haasti_ Forbes, Trans.

XIV (1850). These\r\nimportant objects were sent to the describer by a colonist of Réunion,\r\nMonsieur de Malavois, but were obtained from the natives in Madagascar by\r\nCaptain M. Abadie. A third egg arrived smashed. The name given on this\r\nevidence was _Aepyornis maximus_.\r\n\r\nSince then some 40 eggs at least and a large number of odd bones have been\r\ncollected by Monsieur Grandidier, Messrs. Last and others, and Dr. Forsyth\r\nMajor, but only one practically complete, and one less complete skeleton of\r\na smaller species, named _Aepyornis hildebrandti_ by Dr. Burckhardt.\r\n\r\nA large number of species has been diagnosed on the evidence of these bones\r\nand eggs by Professor Milne-Edwards, Mr. Dawson Rowley and Mr. Andrews, and\r\na second genus, _Mullerornis_, established.\r\n\r\nThe following is the diagnosis of the family\r\n\r\n                             AEPYORNITHIDAE.\r\n\r\nHead less flattened than in the _Dinornithidae_, much longer and narrower.\r\nBrain case much greater in volume. Occipital condyle strongly pedunculate.\r\nTemporal fossae deep and narrow. The basisphenoid has on each side a well\r\nmarked pterygoidal apophysis. The lower mandible is straight and stout,\r\nrecalling somewhat that of _Rhea_, but the maxillary branches are higher\r\nand stouter. The symphysis is long, contracted, and hollowed out in the\r\nshape of a ladle. The sternum presents many affinities to that of\r\n_Apteryx_. It is a thin plastron, flattened, and much widened. The\r\ncoracoidal articular surfaces similar to those of _Apteryx_. The\r\nCoraco-scapulars are feeble, and have so faint an articular surface that\r\nthe humerus must have been rudimentary. Hallux absent, outer digit has\r\nfive, the middle digit four, and the inner digit three phalanges.\r\n\r\nThere are three genera and twelve species.\r\n\r\nA striking character is that in the genus _Aepyornis_ the proximal\r\nextremity of the tarso-metatarsus is larger than the distal extremity, a\r\nfeature not found in the majority of other birds.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Grandidier has expressly pointed out that _Aepyornis_ had only\r\nthree toes, I cannot, therefore, understand why Messrs. Lydekker and Evans\r\nboth state that the hallux is present. {222}\r\n\r\nIn spite of the researches of Messrs. Grandidier, Last, and Forsyth Major\r\nand the large collections sent home by them, the number of _Aepyornis_\r\nbones is infinitesimal compared with the vast masses of bones of the\r\n_Dinornithidae_ contained in the museums. This paucity of material quite\r\nprohibits us from making a critical study of the described species, so that\r\nwe are at present unable to say if too many or too few species have been\r\ndiagnosed. I am inclined, however, to think that if we ever get complete\r\nskeletons of the larger forms, _Ae. grandidieri_ and _Ae. cursor_ will\r\nprove to be sexes of one species, and also _Ae. titan_ and _Ae. maximus_.\r\nFor the present, however, the measurements are too different to allow of\r\ntheir being united without further investigation.\r\n\r\nThe three genera are as follows:--\r\n\r\nAEPYORNIS T.

Gilford, Orange, New Jersey.\r\n  1 Rowley collection.\r\n\r\nThese four eggs range from 900 mm. to 863.5 mm. in large circumference, and\r\n770 mm. to 736 mm. in small circumference. {225}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AEPYORNIS MAXIMUS GEOFF.\r\n\r\n    _Aepyornis maximus_ I.

CXVIII, pp. 122-127\r\n    (1894).\r\n\r\nThis is the stoutest and bulkiest species, though not so tall as _Ae.\r\ntitan_. All the largest eggs next to those of _Ae. titan_ must belong to\r\nthis species. It will be argued that I have no right to use the name\r\n_maximus_ for this form, but the name of _maximus_ is based on one of the\r\neggs in the Paris Museum, and as these evidently belong to this form and\r\nnot to the form subsequently called _maximus_, I must apply to that the\r\nname of _grandidieri_, given by Mr. Dawson Rowley in 1867 to a portion of\r\neggshell of the lesser form.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of the limbs are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Femur._\r\n\r\n  Total length                                440 mm.\r\n  Width at proximal end                       190 \"\r\n  Width at distal end                         200 \"\r\n  Circumference at narrowest part of shaft    265 \"\r\n\r\n  _Tibio-tarsus._\r\n\r\n  Total length                                780 mm.\r\n  Width at proximal end                       180 \"\r\n  Width at distal end                         160 \"\r\n  Circumference at narrowest part of shaft    210 \"\r\n\r\n  _Tarso-metatarsus._\r\n\r\n  Total length                                420 mm.\r\n  Width at proximal end                       170 \"\r\n  Width at distal end                         160 \"\r\n  Circumference at narrowest part of shaft    200 \"\r\n\r\nThe description of the foot in the diagnosis of the family is based on the\r\npes of this species. It is true that the two mounted skeletons in the\r\nBritish and Tring Museums of _Aepyornis hildebrandti_ show a larger number\r\nof phalanges; but as neither is composed of the bones of a single\r\nindividual it is more than likely that the articulator made a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the type egg are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Large diameter                              340 mm.\r\n  Small diameter                              225 \"\r\n  Large circumference                         850 \"\r\n  Small circumference                         710 \"\r\n\r\nHabitat: S. W. Madagascar.\r\n\r\nThere are about 16 eggs known of this form, varying from 854 mm. to 816 mm.\r\nin large circumference, and from 743 mm. to 715 mm. in small circumference.\r\n{226}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      AEPYORNIS GRANDIDIERI ROWLEY.\r\n\r\n    _Aepyornis Maximus_ Auct.\r\n\r\n    _Aepyornis grandidieri_ Rowley, P.Z.S. 1867, p. 892.\r\n\r\nThis is the form which nearly all the bones, referred erroneously to\r\nGeoffroy's _Ae. maximus_, belong. The original description of Dawson Rowley\r\nwas founded on a piece of eggshell, and is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The granulation is in a marked degree different from that of the other\r\npieces. The air pores which in the other specimens appear like a comet with\r\na tail are here only small indentations without any tail; the shell also is\r\nonly half the thickness, is much finer, and presents an aspect so diverse\r\nthat the difference is detected by the most careless observer, even when\r\nthe pieces are all mixed. These fragments belonged to the egg of much\r\nsmaller birds, the embryo of which required less strength in the shell. Yet\r\nthe colour, quality and locality of that shell clearly point to a bird of\r\nthe same family as _Aepyornis maximus_--in short, a smaller and more\r\ndelicate _Aepyornis_. For this species I propose the name of _Aepyornis\r\ngrandidieri_.\"\r\n\r\nThe measurements of bones of the hind limb are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Femur._\r\n\r\n  Length                                 320 mm.\r\n  Width at distal end                    190 \"\r\n\r\n  _Tibio-tarsus._\r\n\r\n  Length                                 640 mm.\r\n\r\nThere are at Tring two eggs of this species.\r\n\r\n  No. 1, traded.\r\n\r\n  Length                               283.0 mm.\r\n  Width                                215.0 \"\r\n  Large circumference                  777.5 \"\r\n  Small circumference                  670.0 \"\r\n\r\n  No. 2 Ambondo, Ambovombé in the district of Fort Dauphin.\r\n\r\n  Large circumference                  775   mm.\r\n  Small circumference                  662.5 \"\r\n\r\nThere are recorded of these eggs, besides the two mentioned above, eight\r\nfurther specimens, varying from 810 mm. to 771.5 mm. in large\r\ncircumference, and 686 mm. to 654 mm. in small circumference.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these there are in various collections about eight or nine\r\neggs whose species is doubtful. {227}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     AEPYORNIS CURSOR M.-E. & GRAND.\r\n\r\n    _Aepyornis cursor_ Milne-Edwards & Grandidier, C.R.

The femur in question is not only\r\ndistinguished by its lesser proportions but by the narrower external face\r\nof the bone; which variation results in causing the whole area between the\r\ntrochanter and the base of the femoral neck to be much less depressed. The\r\nintermuscular line, which marks the insertion surface of the deep portion\r\nof the femoral triceps muscle, is hardly indicated, whereas it is very\r\npronounced in the larger femur. The posterior side is also more rounded,\r\nand the distance which separates the popliteal depression from the proximal\r\nextremity is larger; the shape of this large depression is, however, the\r\nsame as in the larger femur, and although the articular surfaces above it\r\ndo show some differences, we know that these characters are not very\r\nreliable as they are subject to individual variations.\r\n\r\nCircumference of shaft 215 mm.\"\r\n\r\nHabitat: West Madagascar. {228}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      AEPYORNIS HILDEBRANDTI BURCKH.\r\n\r\n    _Aepyornis hildebrandti_ Burckhardt, Pal.

Between the middle and outer\r\nones there is a bony opening for the passage of the adductor muscle of the\r\nouter digit, which passage is not present in _Aepyornis_ (or _Mullerornis_,\r\nW.R.).\" (Translation.)\r\n\r\n  Length of tibio-tarsus                 400 mm.\r\n  Circumference of tibio-tarsus          100 \"\r\n  Width of tibio-tarsus                   35 \"\r\n  Width of distal end                     75 \"\r\n\r\nHabitat: West Madagascar.\r\n\r\n{235}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DROMAIUS PERONI NOM.

Vieillot, in the\r\nNouveau Dictionnaire D'Histoire Naturelle X, page 212, distinctly states\r\nthat his _Dromaius ater_ was a name given to Latham's _Casuarius\r\nnovaehollandiae_, and makes no mention of Péron or of the Isle Decrès.\r\n\r\nThe figures in Péron's work of the adult male and female are not good, but\r\nthose of the young and nestlings appear to me to be very accurate, and the\r\nplate in the Galérie des Oiseaux is quite excellent. The latter and my own\r\nare taken from the type specimen in the Paris Museum, while the plate in\r\nPéron was done by Lessieur from a series of sketches from life made by\r\nhimself on Decrès Island and in the menagerie of the Jardin des Plantes.\r\nThe only known specimens of this extinct species are the mounted skin and\r\nskeleton in Paris and the skeleton in the Florence Museum. All these are\r\nwhat remain of the three living birds brought to Paris by Péron, and no\r\nother authentic specimens exist anywhere. There is in the Museum at\r\nLiverpool a full-grown, though immature Emu of the same size as _Dromaius\r\nperonii_, but owing to its proportionally longer legs and very scanty\r\nplumage it is not absolutely safe to identify it as a second mounted\r\nspecimen of _D. peronii_. I will recur to this lower down.\r\n\r\nDescription of adult male (ex Cat. Birds Brit. Mus.): Similar to _D.\r\nnovaehollandiae_, but much smaller, and with feathers of the neck entirely\r\nblack; feathers of the body brown fulvous, with the apical half very dark\r\nblackish brown; bill and feet blackish, naked skin of the sides of the neck\r\nblue. Total length about 55 inches, tarsus 11.40, culmen 2.36.\r\n\r\nImmature in first plumage entirely sooty black. Nestling whitish with\r\nlongitudinal bands of rufous brown. In addition to Decrès or Kangaroo\r\nIsland, also Flinders, King Islands, and Tasmania had Emus living on them\r\n{236} at the time of Péron's visit, and I believe, if authentic specimens\r\nfrom these localities were in existence we should find that each of these\r\nislands had had a distinct species or race of Emus. Taking this for\r\ngranted, and also taking into account that it is slightly different from\r\nthe type of _D. peronii_, I have come to the conclusion that the Liverpool\r\nspecimen is an immature, though full-grown individual from one of these\r\nother islands; but it is not possible from this one rather poor specimen to\r\nseparate it from the Kangaroo Island species, especially as there is\r\nabsolutely no indication of the origin of this specimen.\r\n\r\nHabitat: Island of Decrès or Kangaroo Island.\r\n\r\nOne stuffed specimen (Type) and one skeleton in Paris, one skeleton in\r\nFlorence, and one stuffed specimen in Liverpool (an species diversa?). Also\r\nsome leg-bones in Adelaide, Australia.\r\n\r\nDr. H. O. Forbes, who kindly lent me the last-named specimen, was the first\r\nto point out the differences of this bird from _D. novaehollandiae_. It is\r\ncertainly totally distinct from birds of similar age of either _D.\r\nnovaehollandiae_ or _D. n. irroratus_. {237}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DROMAIUS MINOR (SPENCER).\r\n\r\n    _Dromaeus minor_ Baldwin Spencer, Vict. Nat. XXIII, p. 140 (1906).\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bernard H. Woodward, of Perth, West Australia, was organising an\r\nexpedition to Kangaroo, Flinders, and King Islands (December, 1906), to\r\nhunt for Emu remains on these islands, I had hoped to be the first to\r\ndescribe what I felt sure would be two new species of _Dromaius_. I have,\r\nhowever, been forestalled by Professor Baldwin Spencer in the case of King\r\nIsland, whence a collection of 17 femurs, 19 tibio-tarsi, 28\r\ntarso-metatarsi, and portions of 8 pelves, made by Messrs. Alex. Morton and\r\nR. M. Johnston, T.S.O., formed the material for the description of a new\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is as follows: \"Smaller than _D. ater_ (= _D. peronii_ mihi).\r\nTibia not or only slightly exceeding 330 mm. in greatest length.\r\nTarso-metatarsus not exceeding 280 mm. in greatest length. Pelvis, length\r\nnot or only slightly exceeding 280 mm.\"\r\n\r\n_D. minor_ was a smaller but stouter bird than _D. peronii_.
