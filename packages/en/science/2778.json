I will\r\nsay for Fanshaw, you could most see your face in the harness always.”\r\n\r\nThe young fellow addressed rubbed away at the nickel plating good\r\nhumoredly, although he had heard enough exhortations in the last\r\ntwenty-four hours to chafe somewhat the spirit of youth. His mother, a\r\nlarge, heavy woman, stood over him, her face full of care.\r\n\r\n“It's a big change from driving a grocery wagon to driving a gentleman's\r\ncarriage, 'Zekiel. I do hope you sense it.”\r\n\r\n“You'd make a bronze image sense it, mother,” answered the young man,\r\nsmiling broadly. “You might sit and sermonize just as well, mightn't\r\nyou? Sitting's as cheap as standing,”--he cast a glance around the clean\r\nspaces of the barn in search of a chair,--“or if you'd rather go and\r\nattend to your knitting, I've seen harness before, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I'm not sure as you've ever handled a gentleman's harness in your life,\r\n'Zekiel Forbes.”\r\n\r\n“It's a fact they don't wear 'em much down Boston way.”\r\n\r\nHis mother regarded his shock of light hair with repressed fondness.\r\n\r\n“It was a big responsibility I took when I asked Mr. Evringham to let\r\nyou try the place,” she said solemnly, “and I'm going to do my best to\r\nhelp you fill it. It does seem almost a providence the way Fanshaw's\r\nlivery fits you; and if you'll hold yourself up, I may be partial, but\r\nit seems to me you look better in it than he ever did; and I'm sure if\r\nhandsome is as handsome does, you'll fill it better every way, even if\r\nhe _was_ a fashionable English coachman. Mrs. Evringham was so pleased\r\nwith his style she tried to have him kept even after he'd taken too much\r\nfor the second time; but Mr. Evringham valued his horses too highly for\r\nthat, I can tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Thought the governor was a widower still,” remarked Ezekiel as his\r\nmother drew forward a battered chair and dusted it with the huge apron\r\nthat covered her neat dress. She seated herself close to her boy.\r\n\r\n“Of course he is,” she returned with some asperity. “Why should he get\r\nmarried with such a home as he's got? Fifteen years I've kept house for\r\nMr. Evringham. I don't believe but what he'd say that in all that time\r\nhe's never found his beef overdone or a button off his shirts.”\r\n\r\n“Humph!” grunted Ezekiel. “He looks as if he wouldn't mind hanging you\r\nto the nearest tree if he did. I heard tell once that there was a cold\r\nhell as well as a hot one. Think says I, when the governor was looking\r\nme over the other day, 'You've set sail for the cold place, old boy.'”\r\n\r\n“Zeke Forbes, don't you ever let me hear you say such a thing again!”\r\n exclaimed Mrs. Forbes. “Mr. Evringham is the finest gentleman within one\r\nhundred miles of New York city. When a man has spent his life in Wall\r\nStreet it's bound to show some in his face, of course; but what comfort\r\nhas that man ever known?”\r\n\r\n“Pretty scrumptious place he's got here in this park, I notice,”\r\n returned the new coachman.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he has a breath of fresh air before he goes to the city and after\r\nhe gets back every day. Isn't that Essex Maid of his a beauty?” Mrs.\r\nForbes cast her eyes towards the stalls where the shining flanks of two\r\nhorses were visible from her seat by the wide-open doors of the barn.\r\n“His rides back there among the hills,”--Mrs. Forbes waved her hand\r\nvaguely toward the tall trees waving in the spring sunshine,--“are his\r\none pleasure; and he never tires of them. You will find the horses\r\nhere something different to groom from those common grocery horses in\r\nBoston.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don't know,” drawled 'Zekiel, teasingly.\r\n\r\n“Then you'd better know, young man,” emphatically. “And, Zeke, what's\r\nthe names of those carriages?” pointing with sudden energy at two half\r\nshrouded vehicles.\r\n\r\n“How many guesses do I get?”\r\n\r\n“Guessing ain't going to do. Do you know, or don't you?”\r\n\r\n“Know? Why,” leniently, “bless your heart, mother, don't you s'pose I\r\nknow a buggy and a carryall when I see 'em?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you poor benighted grocery boy!” Mrs. Forbes raised her hands.\r\n“What a mercy I mentioned it! Imagine Mrs. Evringham hearing you ask if\r\nshe'd have the buggy or the carryall! 'Zekiel,” solemnly, “listen to me.\r\nThat tall one's a spider, and the other's a broom. There! Do you hear\r\nme? A _spider_ and a _broom_!”\r\n\r\nEzekiel's merry eyes met the anxious ones with a twinkle.\r\n\r\n“Who'd have thought it!” he responded.\r\n\r\n“Now then, Zeke,” anxiously, “it's my responsibility. I recommended you.\r\nI want you should say 'em off as glib as Fanshaw did. Now then, which is\r\nwhich?”\r\n\r\n“Mother, didn't you tell me that the late lamented was not a\r\nprohibitionist?”\r\n\r\n“Fanshaw drank like a fish, if that's what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Well, just because he saw things in this barn you needn't expect me to!\r\nPoor chap! Spiders and brooms! He must have been glad to go.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes' earnest expression did not change. “'Zekiel, don't you\r\ntease, now! We haven't got time. I want you to make such a success of\r\nthis that you'll stay with me. You can't think how I felt when I woke\r\nup this morning and thought the first thing, 'Zeke's here.' Why, I've\r\nscarcely kept acquainted with you for fifteen years. Scarcely saw you\r\nexcept for a few weeks in the summer time. Now I've got you again!”\r\n\r\n“I ain't the only thing you've got again,” grinned 'Zekiel, “if you're\r\ngoing to see things, same as Fanshaw did.”\r\n\r\nThus reminded, the housekeeper looked back at the phaeton and the\r\nbrougham. “Be a good boy, Zeke,” coaxingly, “and don't forget now,\r\nbecause Mrs. Evringham is a great stickler--and a great sticker, too,”\r\n added Mrs. Forbes in a different tone.\r\n\r\n“Who _is_ the old woman, if the governor isn't married?” asked Ezekiel\r\nwith not very lively interest. “She don't seem popular with you.”\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you who she is,” returned his mother in a low, emphatic tone.\r\n“she's just what I say--a sticker and an interloper.”\r\n\r\n“H'm! Shouldn't wonder if the green-eyed monster had got after mamma,”\r\n soliloquized the youth aloud. “Somebody else sews on the buttons now,\r\nperhaps.”\r\n\r\n“'Zekiel Forbes, we must have an understanding right off. You've got to\r\njoke and tease, I s'pose, but it can't be about Mr. Evringham. This is\r\nlike a law of the Medes and Persians, and I want you should understand\r\nit. The more you see of him the less you'll dare to joke about him.”\r\n\r\n“I told you he scared me stiff,” acknowledged Zeke, running the harness\r\nthrough his hands to discover another dingy spot.\r\n\r\n“Well, he'd _better_. Now I wouldn't gossip to you of my employer's\r\naffairs--I hope we're better than two common servants--but I want you to\r\nbe as loyal to him as I am, and to understand a few of the reasons why\r\nhe can't go giggling around like some folks.”\r\n\r\n“Great Scott!” interpolated the young coachman. “Mr. Evringham go\r\ngiggling around! So would Bunker Hill monument!”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Zeke. Mr. Evringham has had two sons. His wife died when\r\nthe oldest, Lawrence, was fifteen. Well, both those boys disappointed\r\nhim. Lawrence when he was twenty-one married secretly a widow older than\r\nhimself, who had a little girl named Eloise. Mr. Evringham made the best\r\nof it, and helped him along in business. Lawrence became a broker and\r\nhad made and lost a fortune when he died at the age of thirty-five.”\r\n\r\n“Broke himself, did he?” remarked the irrepressible 'Zekiel.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he did. Here we were, living in peace and comfort,--my employer\r\nat sixty a man of settled habits and naturally very set in his ways and\r\nsatisfied with his home and the way I had run it for him for fifteen\r\nyears,--when three blows fell on him at once. Firstly his son Lawrence\r\nfailed and was ruined; secondly he died; and thirdly his widow and her\r\ndaughter nineteen years old came here a couple of months ago and settled\r\non Mr. Evringham, and here they've stayed ever since! I don't think they\r\nhave an idea of going away.” Mrs. Forbes's eyes snapped. “Such an upset\r\nas it was! I couldn't show how I felt, of course, for it was so much\r\nworse for him than it was for me. He had never cared for Mrs. Evringham,\r\nand scarcely knew the girl who called him 'grandfather' without an atom\r\nof right.”\r\n\r\n“Hard lines,” observed 'Zekiel. “Does the girl call herself Evringham?”\r\n\r\n“Does she?” with scorn. “Well I guess she does. Of course she was only\r\nfour when her mother married Lawrence, and I guess she was fond of\r\nher stepfather and he of her, because he never had any children; but\r\nsometimes I ask myself, is it going on forever? I only hope Eloise'll\r\nget married soon.”\r\n\r\n'Zekiel dropped the harness to arrange imaginary curls on his temples\r\nand pat the tie on his muscular neck. “If she's pretty I'm willing,” he\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\nHis mother shook her head absently. “Then there was Mr. Evringham's\r\nyounger son, a regular roving ne'er-do-well. He didn't like Wall Street\r\nand he went West to Chicago. He was a rolling stone, first in one\r\nposition and then in another; then he got married, and after a few years\r\nhe rolled away altogether. All Mr. Evringham knows about him and his\r\nfamily is that he had one child. Harry wrote a few letters about his\r\nwife Julia and the baby, at the time it was born, and Mr. Evringham sent\r\na present of money; then the letters ceased until one day the wife wrote\r\nhim frantically that her husband had disappeared and begged to know\r\nwhere he was. Mr. Evringham knew nothing about him and wrote her so, and\r\nthat is the last he's heard. So you see if he looks cold and hard, he's\r\nhad enough to make him so.”\r\n\r\n“H'm!” ejaculated 'Zekiel. “He don't give the impression of lyin' awake\r\nnights wondering how his deserted daughter-in-law and the kid make out.”\r\n\r\n“Why should he?” retorted Mrs. Forbes sharply. “His two boys acted as\r\nselfish to him as boys could. He's a disappointed, humiliated man in\r\nthat proud heart of his. He's been hunted out and harrowed up in this\r\npeaceful retreat, when all he asked was to be let alone with his horses\r\nand his golf clubs, and I think one daughter-in-law's enough under\r\nthe circumstances. I have some respect for Mrs. Harry, whoever she is,\r\nbecause she lets him alone. In all the long years we've spent here, when\r\nhe often had no one to talk to but me, he's let me have a glimpse of\r\nthese things, and I've told you so's you'd think right about him and\r\nserve him all the better.”\r\n\r\n“He's got a look in his eyes like cold steel,” remarked Ezekiel, “and\r\nlines under 'em like they'd been drawn with steel; and his back's as\r\nflat and straight as if a steel rod took the place of a spine. That\r\nthick gray hair and mustache of his might be steel threads.”\r\n\r\n“He's a splendid sight on horseback,” responded Mrs. Forbes devoutly.\r\n“His sons were neither of 'em ever the man he is. I'd like to protect\r\nhim from being imposed upon if such a thing was possible.”\r\n\r\n“Sho!” drawled 'Zekiel. “Might's well talk about protecting a\r\nbattleship.”\r\n\r\n“Well, 'Zekiel Forbes,” returned his mother, her eyes bright, “can't you\r\nimagine a battleship hesitating to run down a little pleasure yacht with\r\nall its flags flying? And can't you imagine that hesitation costing the\r\nbattleship considerable precious time and money? You've said a good deal\r\nabout my sacrificing my room in the house and coming out here to fix a\r\nlittle home for us both, upstairs in the barn chambers, but perhaps you\r\ncan see now that it isn't all sacrifice, that perhaps I'm glad of an\r\nexcuse to get out of the house, where things are so different from what\r\nthey used to be, and to have a cosy home with my own boy. Now then,\r\n'Zekiel,” coaxingly, these words recalling her boy's responsibilities,\r\n“look over there once more and tell me which of those is the spider.”\r\n\r\nZekiel dropped the harness and laid his hand gently on his mother's\r\nforehead. “There isn't anything there, dear mother,” he said soothingly.\r\n\r\n“Zeke!” she exclaimed, jerking away with a short reluctant laugh.\r\n\r\n“'Mother, dear mother, come home with me now,'” he roared\r\nsentimentally, so that Essex Maid lifted her beautiful head and looked\r\nout in surprise. “Remember Fanshaw, and put more water in it after\r\nthis,” he added, dropping his arm to his mother's neck and capturing her\r\nwith a hug.\r\n\r\n“'Zekiel!” she protested. “'Zekiel!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CHICAGO LETTER\r\n\r\nThe mother was still laughing and struggling in the irresistible\r\nembrace when both became aware that a third person was regarding them in\r\nopen-mouthed astonishment.\r\n\r\n“'Zekiel, let me _go_!” commanded the scandalized woman, and pushed\r\nherself free from her tormentor, who forthwith returned rather\r\nsheepishly to his buckles.\r\n\r\nThe young man with trim-pointed beard and mirthful eyes, who stood\r\nin the driveway, had just dismounted from a shining buggy. Doubt and\r\nastonishment were apparently holding him dumb.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper, smoothing her disarranged locks and much flushed of\r\nface, returned his gaze, rising from her chair.\r\n\r\n“I couldn't believe it was you, Mrs. Forbes!” declared the newcomer.\r\n“Fanshaw isn't--” He looked around vaguely.\r\n\r\n“No, he isn't, Dr. Ballard,” returned Mrs. Forbes shortly. “He forgot to\r\nrub down Essex Maid one evening when she came in hot, and that finished\r\nhim with Mr. Evringham.”\r\n\r\nThe young doctor's lips twitched beneath his mustache as he looked at\r\n'Zekiel, polishing away for dear life.\r\n\r\n“You seem to have some one else here--some friend,” he remarked\r\ntentatively.\r\n\r\n“Friend!” echoed the housekeeper with exasperation, feeling to see just\r\nhow much Zeke had rumpled her immaculate collar. “We looked like friends\r\nwhen you came up, didn't we!”\r\n\r\n“Like intimate friends,” murmured the doctor, still looking curiously at\r\nthe big fair-haired fellow, who was crimson to his temples.\r\n\r\n“I don't know how long we shall continue friends if he ever grabs me\r\nagain like that just after I've put on a clean collar. He's got beyond\r\nthe place where I can correct him. I ought to have done it oftener when\r\nI had the chance. This is my boy 'Zekiel, Dr. Ballard,” with a proud\r\nglance in the direction of the youth, who looked up and nodded, then\r\ncontinued his labors. “Mr. Evringham has engaged him on trial. He's been\r\nwith horses a couple of years, and I guess he'll make out all right.”\r\n\r\n“Glad to know you, 'Zekiel,” returned the doctor. “Your mother has been\r\na good friend of mine half my life, and I've often heard her speak of\r\nyou. Look out for my horse, will you? I shall be here half an hour or\r\nso.”\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor had moved off toward the house Mrs. Forbes nodded at her\r\nson knowingly.\r\n\r\n“Might's well walk Hector into the barn and uncheck him, Zeke,” she\r\nsaid. “They'll keep him more'n a half an hour. That young man, 'Zekiel\r\nForbes,--that young man's my _hope_.” Mrs. Forbes spoke impressively and\r\nshook her forefinger to emphasize her words.\r\n\r\n“What you hoping about him?” asked 'Zekiel, laying down the harness and\r\nproceeding to lead the gray horse up the incline into the barn.\r\n\r\n“Shouldn't wonder a mite if he was our deliverer,” went on Mrs. Forbes.\r\n“I saw it in Mrs. Evringham's eye that he suited her, the first night\r\nthat she met him here at dinner. I like him first-rate, and I don't mean\r\nhim any harm; but he's one of these young doctors with plenty of money\r\nat his back, bound to have a fashionable practice and succeed. His face\r\nis in his favor, and I guess he knows as much as any of 'em, and he\r\ncan afford the luxury of a wife brought up the way Eloise Evringham has\r\nbeen. That's right, Zeke. Unfasten the check-rein, though the doctor\r\ndon't use a mean one, I must say. I only hope there's a purgatory for\r\nthe folks that use too short check-reins on their horses. I hope they'll\r\nhave to wear 'em themselves for a thousand years, and have to stand\r\nwaiting at folks' doors frothing at the mouth, and the back of their\r\nnecks half breaking when the weather's down to zero and up to a hundred.\r\nThat's what I hope!”\r\n\r\n'Zekiel grinned. “You want 'em to try the cold place and the hot one\r\ntoo, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes I do, and to stay in the one that hurts the most. The man that uses\r\na decent check-rein on his horse,” continued Mrs. Forbes, dropping into\r\na philosophizing tone, “is apt to be as decent to his wife. The doctor\r\nwould be a great catch for that girl, and I _think_,” dropping her\r\nvoice, “her mother'd be liable to live with 'em.”\r\n\r\n“You're keeping that dark from the doctor, I s'pose?” remarked 'Zekiel.\r\n\r\n“H'm. You needn't think I go chattering around that house the way I do\r\nout here. I've got a great talent, if I do say it, for minding my own\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\n“Good enough,” drawled 'Zekiel. “I heard tell once of a firm that made a\r\ngreat fortune just doing that one thing.”\r\n\r\n“Don't you be sassy now. I've always waited on Mr. Evringham while he\r\nate his meals, and that's the time he'd often speak out to me about\r\nthings if he felt in the humor, so that in all these years 't isn't any\r\nwonder if I've come to feel that his business is mine too.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” returned 'Zekiel, with a twinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n“It's been as plain as your nose that the interlopers don't like to have\r\nme there. Not that they have anything special against me, but they'd\r\nlike to have someone younger and stylisher to hand them their plates.\r\nI'll never forget one night when they'd been here about a week, and I\r\nthink Mr. Evringham had begun to suspect they were fixtures,--I'd felt\r\nit from the first,--Mrs. Evringham said, 'Why father, does Mrs. Forbes\r\nalways wait on your table? I had supposed she was temporarily taking the\r\nplace of your butler or your waitress.'”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper's effort to imitate the airy manner she remembered\r\ncaused her son to chuckle as he gathered up the shining harness.\r\n\r\n“You should have seen the look Mr. Evringham gave her. Just as if he\r\ndidn't see her at all. 'Yes,' he answered, 'I hope Mrs. Forbes will wait\r\non my table as long as I have one.' And I will if I have my health,”\r\n added the speaker, bridling with renewed pleasure at the memory of that\r\ntriumphant moment. “They think I'm a machine without any feelings or\r\nopinions, and that I've been wound up to suit Mr. Evringham and run\r\nhis establishment, and that I'm no more to be considered than the big\r\nWestminster clock on the stairs. Mrs. Evringham did try once to get into\r\nmy employer's rooms and look after his clothes.” Mrs. Forbes shook her\r\nhead and tightened her lips at some recollection.\r\n\r\n“She bucked up against the machine, did she?” inquired Zeke.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper glanced around to see if any one might be approaching.\r\n\r\n“I saw her go in there, and I followed her,” she continued almost in a\r\nwhisper. “She sort of started, but spoke up in her cool way, 'I wish to\r\nlook over father's clothes and see if anything needs attention.'\r\n'Thank you, Mrs. Evringham, but everything is in order,' I said, very\r\nrespectful. 'Well, leave it for me next time, Mrs. Forbes,' she says.\r\n'I shall take care of him while I am here.' 'Thank you,' says I, 'but\r\nhe wouldn't want your visit interfered with by that kind of work.' She\r\nlooked at me sort of suspicious and haughty. 'I prefer to do it,' she\r\nanswers, trying to look holes in me with her big eyes. 'Then will you\r\nask him, please,' said I very polite, 'before I give you the keys,\r\nbecause we've got into habits here. I've taken care of Mr. Evringham's\r\nclothes for fifteen years.' She looked kind of set back. 'Is it so\r\nlong?' she asks. 'Well, I will see about it.' But I guess the right time\r\nfor seeing about it never came,” added the housekeeper knowingly.\r\n\r\n“You're still doing business at the old stand, eh?” rejoined Zeke.\r\n“Well, I'm glad you like your job. It's my opinion that the governor's\r\nharder--”\r\n\r\n“Ahem, ahem!” Mrs. Forbes cleared her throat with desperate loudness\r\nand tugged at her son's shirt sleeve with an energy which caused him to\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nComing up the sunny driveway was a tall man with short, scrupulously\r\nbrushed iron-gray hair, and sweeping mustache. The lines under his eyes\r\nwere heavy, his glance was cold. His presence was dignified, commanding,\r\nrepellent.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper and coachman both stood at attention, the latter\r\nmechanically pulling down his rolled-up sleeves.\r\n\r\n“So you're moving out here, Mrs. Forbes,” was the remark with which the\r\nnewcomer announced himself.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Evringham. The man has been here to put in the electric bell\r\nyou ordered. I shall be as quick to call as if I was still in the house,\r\nsir, and I thank you--'Zekiel and I both do--for consenting to my making\r\nit home-like for him. Perhaps you'd come up and see the rooms, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Not just now. Some other time. I hope 'Zekiel is going to prove himself\r\nworth all this trouble.”\r\n\r\nThe new coachman's countenance seemed frozen into a stolidity which did\r\nnot alter.\r\n\r\n“I'm sure he'll try,” replied his mother, “and Fanshaw's livery fits him\r\nto such a turn that it would have been flying in the face of Providence\r\nnot to try him. Did you give orders to be met at this train, sir?” Mrs.\r\nForbes looked anxiously toward the set face of her heir.\r\n\r\n“No--I came out unexpectedly. I have received news that is rather\r\nperplexing.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper had not studied her employer's moods for years without\r\nunderstanding when she could be of use.\r\n\r\n“I will come to the house right off,” was her prompt response. “It's a\r\npity you didn't know the bell was in, sir.”\r\n\r\n“No, stay where you are. I see Dr. Ballard is here. We might be\r\ninterrupted. You can go, 'Zekiel.”\r\n\r\nThe young fellow needed no second invitation, but turned and mounted the\r\nstairway that led to the chambers above.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham took from his pocket a bunch of papers, and selecting a\r\nletter handed it to Mrs. Forbes, motioning her to the battered chair,\r\nwhich was still in evidence. He seated himself on the stool Zeke had\r\nvacated, while his housekeeper opened and read the following letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, April 28, 19--.\r\n\r\nDEAR FATHER,--The old story of the Prodigal Son has always plenty\r\nof originality for the Prodigal. I have returned, and thank Heaven\r\nsincerely I do not need to ask you for anything. My blessed girl Julia\r\nhas supported herself and little Jewel these years while I've been\r\nfeeding on husks. I don't see now how I was willing to be so revoltingly\r\ncruel and cowardly as to leave her in the lurch, but she has made\r\nfriends and they have stood by her, and now I've been back since\r\nSeptember, doing all in my power to make up what I can to her and Jewel,\r\nas we call little Julia. They were treasures to return to such as I\r\ndeserved to have lost forever; but Julia treats me as if I'd been white\r\nto her right all along. I've lately secured a position that I hope to\r\nkeep. My wife has been dressmaking, and this is something in the dry\r\ngoods line that I got through her. The firm want us to go to Europe\r\nto do some buying. They will pay the expenses of both; but that leaves\r\nJewel. I've heard that Lawrence's wife and daughter are living with you.\r\nI wondered if you'd let us bring Jewel as far as New York and drop her\r\nwith you for the six weeks that we shall be gone. If we had a little\r\nmore ahead we'd take the child with us. She is eight years old and\r\nwouldn't be any trouble, but cash is scarce, and although we could board\r\nher here with some friend, I'd like to have her become acquainted with\r\nher grandfather, and I thought as Madge and Eloise were with you, they\r\nwould look after her if Mrs. Forbes is no longer there. This has all\r\ncome about very suddenly, and we sail next Wednesday on the Scythia, so\r\nI'll be much obliged if you will wire me. I shall be glad to shake your\r\nhand again.\r\n\r\nYour repentant son,\r\n\r\nHARRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes looked up from the letter to find her employer's eyes upon\r\nher. Her lips were set in a tight line.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I'd like to ask first, sir, what you think of it?”\r\n\r\n“It strikes me as very cool. Harry knows my habits.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper loosened the reins of her indignation.\r\n\r\n“The idea of your having a child here to clatter up and down the stairs\r\nat the very time you want to take a nap!” she burst forth. “You've had\r\nenough to bear already.”\r\n\r\n“A deal of company in the house as it is, eh?” he rejoined. It was the\r\nfirst reference he had ever made to his permanent guests.\r\n\r\n“It's what I was thinking, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You're not for it, then, Mrs. Forbes?”\r\n\r\n“So far as taking care of the child goes, I should do my duty. I don't\r\nthink Mrs. Evringham or her daughter would wish to be bothered; but I\r\nknow very little about children, except that your house is no place for\r\nthem to be racing in. One young one brings others. You would be annoyed,\r\nsir. Some folks can always ask favors.” The housekeeper's cheeks were\r\nflushed with the strength of her repugnance, and her bias relieved Mr.\r\nEvringham's indecision.\r\n\r\n“I agree with you,” he returned, rising. “Tell 'Zekiel to saddle the\r\nMaid. After dinner I will let him take a telegram to the office.”\r\n\r\nHe returned to the house without further words, and Mrs. Forbes called\r\nto her son in a voice that had a wrathful quaver.\r\n\r\n“What you got your back up about?” inquired Zeke softly, after a careful\r\nlook to see that his august master had departed.\r\n\r\n“Never you mind. Mr. Evringham wants you should saddle his horse and\r\nbring her round. I want he should see you can do it lively.”\r\n\r\n“Ain't she a beaut'!” exclaimed Zeke as he led out the mare. “She'd\r\nought to be shown, she had.”\r\n\r\n“Shown! Better not expose your ignorance where Mr. Evringham can hear\r\nyou. That mare's taken two blue ribbons already.”\r\n\r\n“Showed they knew their business,” returned Zeke imperturbably. “I\r\ns'pose the old gent don't care any more for her than he does for his\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“I guess he loves her the best of anything in this world.”\r\n\r\n“Love! The governor love anything or anybody! That's good,” remarked\r\nthe young fellow, while Essex Maid watched his movements about her with\r\ngentle, curious eyes.\r\n\r\n“I do believe she misses Fanshaw and notices the difference,” remarked\r\nMrs. Forbes.\r\n\r\n“Glad to, too. Ain't you, my beauty? She's going to be stuck on me\r\nbefore we get through. She don't want any Britishers fooling around\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“You've certainly made her look fine, Zeke. I know Mr. Evringham will be\r\npleased. She just shines from her pretty little ears to her hoofs. Take\r\nher around and then come back. I want to talk to you.”\r\n\r\n“If I don't come back,” returned the boy, “you'll know the governor's\r\nlooked at me a little too hard and I've been struck so.”\r\n\r\n“Don't be any foolisher than you can help,” returned Mrs. Forbes, “and\r\nhurry.”\r\n\r\nOn 'Zekiel's return to the barn he saw that his mother's face was\r\nportentous. “Lawrence was at least handsome like his father,” she began\r\nwithout preamble, looking over Zeke's shoulder, “but Harry was as homely\r\nas he was no account. I should think that man had enough of his sons'\r\nbelongings hanging on him already. What do you think, 'Zekiel Forbes?\r\nMr. Evringham's youngest son Harry has turned up again!”\r\n\r\n“I should think it was the old Harry by your tone,” rejoined Zeke\r\nequably.\r\n\r\n“He and his wife, poor as church mice, are getting their expenses paid\r\nto Europe on business, and they have the nerve--yes, the cheek--to ask\r\nMr. Evringham to let them leave their young one, a girl eight years old,\r\nwith him while they're gone.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it's a real courageous youngster,” remarked Zeke.\r\n\r\n“A child! A wild Western dressmaker's young one in Mr. Evringham's\r\nelegant house!”\r\n\r\n“Is the old Harry a dressmaker?” asked Zeke mildly.\r\n\r\n“No, his wife is. His Julia! They've named this girl for her, and I\r\nsuppose they called her Jule, and then twisted it around to Jewel.\r\nJewel!”\r\n\r\n“When is she coming?” asked Zeke, seeing that he was expected to say\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n“Coming? She isn't coming,” cried his mother irefully. “Not while Mr.\r\nEvringham has his wits. They haven't a particle of right to ask him.\r\nHarry has worried him to distraction already. The child would be sure to\r\ntorment him.”\r\n\r\n“He'd devour her the second day, then,” returned Zeke calmly. “It would\r\nbe soon over.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMOTHER AND DAUGHTER\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard had gone, and his hostesses were awaiting the summons to\r\ndinner. Mrs. Evringham regarded her daughter critically as the girl sat\r\nat the piano, idly running her fingers over the keys.\r\n\r\nThe listlessness expressed in the fresh face and rounded figure brought\r\na look of disapproval into the mother's eyes.\r\n\r\n“You must practice that nocturne,” she said. “You played it badly just\r\nnow, and there is no excuse for it, Eloise.”\r\n\r\n“If you will let me give lessons I will,” responded the girl promptly,\r\nwithout turning her graceful, drooping head.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected reply was startling.\r\n\r\n“What are you talking about?” asked Mrs. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I'm so tired of it all,” replied the girl wearily.\r\n\r\nA frown contracted her mother's forehead. “Tired of what? Turn around\r\nhere!” She rose and put her hands on the pretty shoulders and turned her\r\nchild until the clear gray eyes met hers. “Now then, tired of what?”\r\n\r\nEloise smiled slightly, and sighed. “Of playing nocturnes to Dr.\r\nBallard.”\r\n\r\n“And he is quite as tired of hearing you, I dare say,” was the retort.\r\n“It seems to me you always stumble when you play to the doctor, and he\r\nadores Chopin.”\r\n\r\nEloise continued to meet her mother's annoyed gaze, her hands fallen in\r\nher lap, all the lines of her nut-brown hair, her exquisite face, and\r\npliable, graceful figure so many silent arguments, as they always were,\r\nagainst any one's harboring annoyance toward her.\r\n\r\n“You say he does, mother, and you have assured him of it so often that\r\nthe poor man doesn't dare to say otherwise; but really, if you'd let him\r\nhave the latest Weber and Field hit, I think he would be so grateful.”\r\n\r\n“Learn it then!” returned Mrs. Evringham.\r\n\r\nEloise laughed lazily. “Intrepid little mother!” Then she added, in a\r\ndifferent tone, “Don't you think there is any danger of our being too\r\nobliging? I'm not the only girl in town whose mother wishes her to\r\noblige Dr. Ballard. May we not overreach ourselves?”\r\n\r\n“Eloise!” Mrs. Evringham's half-affectionate, half-remonstrating grasp\r\nfell from her child's shoulders. “That remark is in very bad taste.”\r\n\r\nThe girl shook her head slowly. “I never can understand why it is any\r\nsatisfaction to you to pretend. You find comfort in pretending that\r\nMr. Evringham likes to have us here, likes us to use his carriages, to\r\nreceive his friends, and all the rest of it. We've been here seven weeks\r\nand three days, and that little game of pretending is satisfying you\r\nstill. You are like the ostrich with its head in the sand.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham drew her lithe figure up. “Well, Eloise, I hope there are\r\nlimits to this. To call your own mother an--an ostrich!”\r\n\r\n“Don't speak so loud,” returned the girl, rising and patting her\r\nmother's hand. “Grandfather has returned from his ride. I just heard him\r\ncome in. It is too near dinner time for a scene. There is no need of our\r\npretending to each other, is there? You have always put me off and put\r\nme off, but surely you mean to bring this to an end pretty soon?”\r\n\r\n“You could bring it to an end at once if you would!” returned Mrs.\r\nEvringham, her voice lowered. “Dr. Ballard has nothing to wait for. I\r\nknow all about his circumstances. There never was such a providence as\r\nfather's having a friend like him ready to our hand--so suitable, so\r\nattractive, so rich!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” responded the girl low and equably, “it is just five weeks and\r\ntwo days that you have been throwing me at that man's head.”\r\n\r\n“I have done nothing of the kind, Eloise Evringham.”\r\n\r\n“Yes you have,” returned the girl without excitement, “and grandfather\r\nsneering at us all the time under his mustache. He knows that there are\r\nother girls and other mothers interested in Dr. Ballard more desirable\r\nthan we are. Oh! how easy it is to be more desirable than we are!”\r\n\r\n“There isn't one girl in five hundred so pretty as you,” returned Mrs.\r\nEvringham stoutly.\r\n\r\n“I wish my prettiness could persuade you into my way of thinking.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” The glance of the older woman was keen and\r\nsuspicious.\r\n\r\n“We would take a cheap little apartment to-morrow,” said the girl\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham gave an ejaculation of impatience. “And do all our own\r\nwork and live like pigs!” she returned petulantly.\r\n\r\nEloise shrugged her shoulders. “I may flatter myself, but I fancy I\r\nshould keep it rather clean.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn't mind your hands then.” Mrs. Evringham regarded the hands\r\nworthy to be imitated by a sculptor's art, and the girl raised them\r\nand inspected the rose-tints of their tips. “I've read something about\r\nrubber gloves,” she returned vaguely.\r\n\r\n“You'd better read something else then. How do you suppose you would get\r\non without a carriage?” asked her mother with exasperation. “You have\r\nnever had so much as a taste of privation in any form. Your suggestion\r\nis the acme of foolishness.”\r\n\r\n“I think I could do something if you would let me,” rejoined the girl\r\nas calmly as before. “I think I could teach music pretty well, and keep\r\nhouse charmingly. If I had any false pride when we came out here, the\r\npast six weeks have purified me of it. Will you let me try, mother? I'm\r\nasking it very seriously.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not!” hotly. “There are armies of music teachers now, and you\r\nwould not have a chance.”\r\n\r\n“I think I could dress hair well,” remarked Eloise, glancing at the\r\nreflection in a mirror of her own graceful coiffure.\r\n\r\n“I dare say!” responded Mrs. Evringham with sarcastic heat, “or I'm sure\r\nyou could get a position as a waitress. The servant problem is growing\r\nworse every year.”\r\n\r\n“I'd like to be your waitress, mother.” For the first time the girl lost\r\nher perfect poise, and the color fluctuated in her cheek. She clasped\r\nher hands. “It would be heaven compared with the feeling, the sickening,\r\nappalling suspicion, that we are becoming akin to the adventuresses we\r\nread of, the pretty, luxurious women who live by their wits.”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” commanded Mrs. Evringham, her eyes flashing and her effective\r\nblack-clothed figure drawn up.\r\n\r\nEloise sighed again. “I didn't expect to accomplish anything by this\r\ntalk,” she said, relapsing into listlessness.\r\n\r\n“What did you expect then? Merely to be disagreeable? I hope you may be\r\nas successful in worthier undertakings. Now listen. Some of the plans\r\nyou have suggested at various times might be sensible if you were a\r\nplain girl. Your beauty is as tangible an asset as money would be; but\r\nbeauty requires money. You must have it. Your poor father might have\r\nleft it to you, but he didn't; so you will marry it--not unsuitably,”\r\n meeting an ominous look in her child's eyes, “not without love or under\r\nany circumstances to make a martyr of you, but according to common\r\nsense; and as a certain young man is evidently more and more certain of\r\nhimself every time he comes”--she paused.\r\n\r\n“You think there is no need for him to grow more certain of me?” asked\r\nEloise.\r\n\r\n“You might have saved us the disagreeables of this interview. And\r\none thing more,” impressively, “you evidently are not taking into\r\nconsideration, perhaps you never knew, that it was your grandfather's\r\nconfidence in a certain course which induced your poor father to take\r\nthat last fatal flyer. Your grandfather feels--I'm sure he feels--that\r\nmuch reparation is due us. The present conditions are easier for him\r\nthan a separate suitable home would be, therefore”--Mrs. Evringham waved\r\nher hand. “It is strange,” she added, “that so young a girl should not\r\nrepose more trust in her mother's judgment. And now that we are on the\r\nsubject, I wish you would make more effort with your grandfather. Don't\r\nbe so silent at table and leave all the talking to me. A man of his\r\nage likes to have merry young people about. Chat, create a cheerful\r\natmosphere. He likes to look at you, of course, but you have been so\r\nquiet and lackadaisical of late, it is enough to hurt his feelings as\r\nhost.”\r\n\r\n“He has never shown any symptoms of anxiety,” remarked Eloise.\r\n\r\n“Well, he is a very self-contained man.”\r\n\r\n“He is indeed, poor grandfather; I don't know how you will manage,\r\nmother, when you have to play the game of 'pretend' all alone. He is\r\ngrowing tired of it, I can see. His courtesy is wearing very thin. I'm\r\nsorry to make it harder for you by taking away what must have been a\r\nlarge prop and support, but I heard papa say to himself more than once\r\nin those last sad days, 'If I had only taken my father's advice.'”\r\n\r\n“Eloise,” very earnestly, “you misunderstood, you certainly\r\nmisunderstood.”\r\n\r\nThe girl shook her head wearily. “No, alas! I neither misunderstand nor\r\nforget, when it would be most convenient to do so.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham's fair brow contracted as she regarded her daughter with\r\nexasperation. “And you are only nineteen! One would think it was you\r\ninstead of me to whom the next birthday would bring that detested\r\nforty.”\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at her mother, whose youthful face and figure betrayed\r\nthe source of her own heritage of physical charm.\r\n\r\n“I long ago gave up the hope of ever again being as young as you are,”\r\n she returned sadly. “Oh!” with a rare and piteous burst of feeling,\r\n“if dear papa could have stayed with us, and we could have had a right\r\nsomewhere!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham threw her arms about the young creature, welcoming the\r\nsoftened mood. “You know I took you right to my own people, Eloise,” she\r\nsaid gently. “We stayed as long as I thought was right; they couldn't\r\nafford to keep us.” A sound at the door caused her to turn. The erect\r\nform of her father-in-law had just entered the room.\r\n\r\n“Ah, good evening, father,” she said in tones whose sadness was not\r\naltogether feigned, even though she secretly rejoiced that Eloise should\r\nfor once show such opportune emotion. “Pardon this little girl. She was\r\njust feeling overwhelmed with a pang of homesickness for her father.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” returned Mr. Evringham. “Will you walk out? Mrs. Forbes tells\r\nme that dinner is served.”\r\n\r\nEloise, hastily drawing her handkerchief across her eyes, passed the\r\nunbending figure, her cheeks stinging. His hard voice was in her ears.\r\n\r\nThat she was not his son's child hurt her now as often before in the\r\npast two months, but that he should have discovered her weeping at a\r\nmoment when he might have been expected to enter was a keen hurt to her\r\npride, and her heart swelled with a suspicion of his unspoken thoughts.\r\nShe had never been effusive, she had never posed. He had no right to\r\nsuspect her.\r\n\r\nWith her small head carried high and her cheeks glowing, she passed\r\nhim, following her mother, who floated on before with much satisfaction.\r\nThese opportune tears shed by her nonconforming child should make their\r\nstay good for another two months at least.\r\n\r\n“You must have had a beautiful ride, father,” said Mrs. Evringham as\r\nthey seated themselves at table. She spoke in the tone, at once assured\r\nand ingratiating, which she always adopted toward him. “I noticed you\r\ntook an earlier start than usual.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker had never had the insight to discover that her father-in-law\r\nwas ungrateful for proofs that any of his long-fixed, solitary habits\r\nwere now observed by feminine eyes.\r\n\r\n“I did take a rather longer ride than usual,” he returned. “Mrs. Forbes,\r\nI wish you would speak to the cook about the soup. It has been served\r\ncool for the last two days.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes flushed as she stood near his chair in her trim black gown\r\nand white apron.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” she replied, the flush and quiet words giving little\r\nindication of the tumult aroused within her by her employer's\r\ncriticism. To fail to please Mr. Evringham at his meals was the deepest\r\nmortification life held for her.\r\n\r\n“I'm sure it tastes very good,” said Mrs. Evringham amiably, “although I\r\nlike a little more salt than your cook uses.”\r\n\r\n“You can reach it I hope,” remarked the host, casting a glance at the\r\ndainty solitaire salt and pepper beside his daughter's plate.\r\n\r\n“But don't you like it cooked in?” she asked sweetly.\r\n\r\n“Not when I want to get it out,” he answered shortly.\r\n\r\n“How can mother, how can mother!” thought Eloise helplessly.\r\n\r\n“There is decided spring in the air to-day,” said Mrs. Evringham. “I\r\nremember of old how charmingly spring comes in the park.”\r\n\r\n“You have a good memory,” returned Mr. Evringham dryly.\r\n\r\n“Why do you say that?” asked the pretty widow, lifting large, innocent\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“It is some years since you accompanied Lawrence in his calls upon me, I\r\nbelieve.”\r\n\r\n“Poor father!” thought Mrs. Evringham, “how unpleasantly blunt he has\r\ngrown, living here alone!”\r\n\r\n“I scarcely realize it,” she returned suavely. “My recollection of the\r\npark is always so clear. It is surprising, isn't it, how relatives can\r\nlive as near together as we in New York and you out here and see one\r\nanother so seldom! Life in New York,” sighing, “was such a rush for\r\nus. Here amid the rustle of the trees it seems to be scarcely the same\r\nworld. Lawrence often said his only lucid intervals were during the\r\nrides he took with Eloise in Central Park. Do you always ride alone,\r\nfather?”\r\n\r\n“Always,” was the prompt rejoinder, while Eloise cast a glance full of\r\nappeal at her mother.\r\n\r\nThe latter continued archly, “If you could see Eloise on a horse you\r\nwould not blame me for trying to screw up my courage, as I have been\r\ndoing for days past, to ask you if she might take a canter on Essex Maid\r\nin the morning, sometimes, while you are away. Fanshaw assured me that\r\nshe would be perfectly safe.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham's cold eyes stared, and then the enormity of the\r\nproposition appeared to move him humorously.\r\n\r\n“Which maid did Fanshaw say would be safe?” he inquired, while Eloise\r\nglowed with mortification.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you think Eloise can't ride, try her some time!” exclaimed\r\nthe widow gayly. It had been a matter of surprise and afterward of\r\nresentment that Mr. Evringham could remain deaf to her hints so long,\r\nand she had determined to become frank. “Or else ask Dr. Ballard,” she\r\nwent on; “he has very kindly provided Eloise with a horse several times,\r\nbut the child likes a solitary ride, sometimes, as well as you do.”\r\n\r\nThe steely look returned to the host's eyes. “No one rides the Maid but\r\nmyself,” he returned coldly.\r\n\r\n“I beg you to believe, grandfather, that I don't wish to ride her,” said\r\nEloise, her customary languor of manner gone and her voice hard. “Mother\r\nis more ambitious for me than I am for myself. I should be very much\r\nobliged if she would allow me to ask favors when I want them.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes's lips were set in a tight line as she filled Mrs.\r\nEvringham's glass.\r\n\r\nThat lady's heart was beating a little fast from vexation, and also from\r\nthe knowledge that a time of reckoning with her child was coming.\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well,” she said airily. “No wonder you are careful of that\r\nbeautiful creature. I caught Eloise with her arms around the mare's neck\r\nthe other day, and I couldn't help wishing for a kodak. You feed her\r\nwith sugar, don't you Eloise?”\r\n\r\n“I hope not, I'm sure!” exclaimed Mr. Evringham sternly.\r\n\r\n“I'll not do it again, grandfather,” said the girl, her very ears\r\nburning.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham sighed and gave one Parthian shot. “The poor child does\r\nlove horses so,” she murmured softly.\r\n\r\nThe host scowled and fidgeted in his chair with a brusque gesture to\r\nMrs. Forbes to remove the course.\r\n\r\n“Harry has turned up again,” he remarked, to change the subject.\r\n\r\n“Really?” returned his daughter-in-law languidly. “For how long I\r\nwonder?”\r\n\r\n“He thinks it is permanent.”\r\n\r\n“He is still in Chicago?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for a day or two. He and his wife sail for Europe immediately.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” with a greater show of interest. Then, curiously, “Are you\r\nsending them, father?”\r\n\r\n“Scarcely! They are going on business.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” relapsing into indifference. “They have a child, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a girl. I should think perhaps you might have remembered it.”\r\n\r\n“I hardly see why, if Harry didn't--a fact he plainly showed by\r\ndeserting the poor creature.” The insolence of the speaker's tone was\r\nscarcely veiled. Her extreme disapproval of her father-in-law sometimes\r\nwelled to the surface of her suave manner.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham's thoughts had fled to Chicago. “Harry proposed leaving\r\nthe girl here while they are gone,” he said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham straightened in her chair and her attention concentrated.\r\n“With you? What assurance! How like Harry!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe words were precisely those which her host had been saying to\r\nhimself; but proceeding from her lips they had a strange effect upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“You find it so?” he asked. The clearer the proposition became to Mrs.\r\nEvringham's consciousness the more she resented it. To have the child\r\nin the house not only would menace her ease and comfort, but meant\r\na possibility that the grandfather might take an interest in Harry's\r\ndaughter which would disturb Eloise's chances.\r\n\r\n“Of course it does. I call it simply presumptuous,” she declared with\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n“After all, Harry has some rights,” rejoined Mr. Evringham slowly.\r\n\r\n“His wife is a dressmaker,” went on the other. “I had it directly from\r\na Chicago friend. Harry has scarcely been with the child since she was\r\nborn. And to saddle a little stranger like that on you! Now Eloise and\r\n_her_ father were inseparable.”\r\n\r\nThere was an ominous glitter in Mr. Evringham's eyes. “Eloise's father!”\r\n he returned slowly. “I did not know that she remembered him.”\r\n\r\nThe hurt of his tone and words sank deep into the heart of the girl, but\r\nshe looked up courageously.\r\n\r\n“Your son was my father in every best sense,” she said. “We were\r\ninseparable. You must have known it.”\r\n\r\n“You appeared to be separable when your father made his visits to\r\nBel-Air Park,” was the rejoinder. “Pardon me if I knew very little\r\nof what took place in his household. A telegraph blank, please, Mrs.\r\nForbes, and tell Zeke to be ready to go to the office.”\r\n\r\nThere was a vital tone in the usually dry voice. Mrs. Evringham looked\r\napprehensively at her daughter; but Eloise gave her no answering glance;\r\nher eyes were downcast and her pretense of eating continued, while her\r\npulses beat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFATHER AND SON\r\n\r\nWhen later they were alone, the girl looked at her mother, her eyes\r\nluminous.\r\n\r\n“You see,” she began rather breathlessly, “even you must see, he is\r\nbeginning to drive us away.”\r\n\r\n“I do hope, Eloise, you are not going to indulge in any heroics over\r\nthis affair,” returned Mrs. Evringham, who had braced herself to meet an\r\nattack. “Does the unpleasant creature suppose we would stay with him if\r\nwe were not obliged to?”\r\n\r\n“If we are obliged to, which I don't admit, need you demand further\r\nfavors than food and shelter? How could you speak of Essex Maid! How can\r\nyou know in your inmost heart, as you do, that we are eating the bread\r\nof charity, and then ask for the apple of his eye!” exclaimed Eloise\r\ndesperately.\r\n\r\n“Go away with your bread and apples,” responded Mrs. Evringham\r\nflippantly. “I have a real worry now that that wretched little cousin of\r\nyours is coming.”\r\n\r\n“She is not my cousin please remember,” responded the girl bitterly.\r\n“Mr. Evringham reminded us of that to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Now don't you begin calling him Mr. Evringham!” protested her mother.\r\n“You don't want to take any notice of the man's absurdities. You will\r\nonly make matters worse.”\r\n\r\n“No, I shall go on saying grandfather for the little while we stay.\r\nOtherwise, he would know his words were rankling. It _will_ be a little\r\nwhile? Oh mother!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham pushed the pleading hand away. “I can't tell how long it\r\nwill be!” she returned impatiently. “We are simply helpless until your\r\nfather's affairs are settled. I thought I had told you that, Eloise.\r\nHe worshipped you, child, and no matter what that old curmudgeon says,\r\nLawrence would wish us to remain under his protection until we see our\r\nway clear.”\r\n\r\n“Won't you have a business talk with him, so we can know what we have to\r\nlook forward to?” The girl's voice was unsteady.\r\n\r\n“I will when the right time comes, Eloise. Can't you trust your mother?\r\nIsn't it enough that we have lost our home, our carriages, all our\r\ncomforts and luxuries, through this man's bad judgment--”\r\n\r\n“You will cling to that!” despairingly.\r\n\r\n“And have had to come out to this Sleepy Hollow of a place, where life\r\nmeans mere existence, and be so poor that the carfare into New York is\r\nactually a consideration! I'm quite satisfied with our martyrdom as\r\nit is, without pinching and grinding as we should have to do to live\r\nelsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Then you don't mean to attempt to escape?” returned Eloise in alarm.\r\n\r\n“Hush, hush, Goosie. We will escape all in good time if we don't succeed\r\nin taming the bear. As it is, I have to work single handed,” dropping\r\ninto a tone of reproach. “You are no help at all. You might as well be\r\na simpering wax dummy out of a shop window. I would have been ashamed at\r\nyour age if I could not have subjugated any man alive. We might have had\r\nhim at our feet weeks ago if you had made an effort.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, mother,” sadly. “I saw when we first came how effusiveness\r\nimpressed him, and I tried to behave so as to strike a balance--that\r\nis, after I found that we were here on sufferance and not as welcome\r\nguests.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! You can't tell what such a hermit is thinking,” returned Mrs.\r\nEvringham. “It is the best thing that could happen to him to have us\r\nhere. Dr. Ballard said so only to-day. What is troubling me now is this\r\nchild of Harry's. I was sure by father's tone when he first spoke of her\r\nthat he would not even consider such an imposition.”\r\n\r\n“I think he did feel so,” returned Eloise, her manner quiet again. “That\r\nwas an example of the way you overreach yourself. The word presumption\r\non your lips applied to uncle Harry determined grandfather to let the\r\nchild come.”\r\n\r\n“You think he really has sent for her then!” exclaimed Mrs. Evringham.\r\n“You think that is what the telegram meant! I'm sure of it, too.” Then\r\nafter a minute's exasperated thought, “I believe you are right. He is\r\njust contrary enough for that. If I had urged him to let the little\r\nbarbarian come, he couldn't have been induced to do so. That wasn't\r\nclever of me!” The speaker made the admission in a tone which implied\r\nthat in general her cleverness was unquestioned. “Well, I hope she will\r\nworry him out of his senses, and I don't think there is much doubt of\r\nit. It may turn out all for the best, Eloise, after all, and lead him\r\nto appreciate us.” Mrs. Evringham cast a glance at the mirror and patted\r\nher waved hair. “And yet I'm anxious, very anxious. He might take a\r\nfancy to the girl,” she added thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“I'm such a poor-spirited creature,” remarked Eloise.\r\n\r\n“What now?”\r\n\r\n“I ought to be strong enough to leave you since you will not come; to\r\nleave this roof and earn my own living, some way, any way; but I'm too\r\nmuch of a coward.”\r\n\r\n“I should hope so,” returned her mother briefly. “You'd soon become one\r\nif you weren't at starting. Girls bred to luxury, as you have been, must\r\njust contrive to live well somehow. They can't stand anything else.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, mother,” quietly. “They can. They do.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in books I know they do.”\r\n\r\n“No, truth is stranger than fiction. They do. I have been looking for\r\nthat sort of stamina in myself for weeks, but I haven't found it. It is\r\na cruel wrong to a girl not to teach her to support herself.”\r\n\r\n“My dear! You were going to college. You know you would have gone had it\r\nnot been for your poor father's misfortunes.”\r\n\r\nEloise's eyes filled again at the remembrance of the young, gay man who\r\nhad been her boon companion since her babyhood, and at the memory of\r\nthose last sad days, when she knew he had agonized over her future even\r\nmore than over that of his volatile wife.\r\n\r\n“My dear, as I've told you before, a girl as pretty as you are should\r\nknow that fortune cannot be unkind, nor the sea of life too rough. In\r\neach of the near waves of it you can see a man's head swimming toward\r\nyou. You don't know the trouble I have had already in silencing those\r\nwho wished to speak before you were old enough. They could any of them\r\nbe summoned now with a word. Let me see. There is Mr. Derwent--Mr.\r\nFollansbee--Mr. Weeks--”\r\n\r\n“Hush, mother!” ejaculated the girl in disgust.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. I knew you would say they were too old, or too bald, or too\r\nshort, or too fat. I've been a girl myself. Of course there is Nat\r\nBonnell, and a lot more little waves and ripples like him, but they\r\nalways _were_ out of the question, and now they are ten times more so.\r\nThat is the reason, Eloise,” the mother's voice became impressive to\r\nthe verge of solemnity, “why I feel that Dr. Ballard is almost a\r\nprovidence.”\r\n\r\nThe girl's clear eyes were reflective. “Nat Bonnell is a wave who\r\nwouldn't remember a girl who had slipped out of the swim.”\r\n\r\n“Very wise of him,” returned Mrs. Evringham emphatically. “He\r\ncan't afford to. Nat is--is--a--decorative creature, just as you\r\nare,--decorative. He must make it pay, poor boy.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mrs. Forbes had sought her son in the barn. He and she had had\r\ntheir supper in time for her to be ready to wait at dinner.\r\n\r\n“Something doing, something doing,” murmured Zeke as he heard the\r\nimpetuosity of her approaching step.\r\n\r\n“That soup _was_ hot!” she exclaimed defiantly.\r\n\r\n“Somebody scald you, ma? I can do him up, whoever he is,” said Zeke,\r\ncatching up a whip and executing a threatening dance around the dimly\r\nlighted barn.\r\n\r\nHis mother's snapping eyes looked beyond him. “He said it was cold; but\r\nit was only because he was distracted. What do you suppose those people\r\nare up to now? Trying to get Essex Maid for Mamzell to ride!”\r\n\r\nZeke stopped in his mad career and returned his mother's stare for a\r\nsilent moment. “And not a dungeon on the place probably!” he exclaimed\r\nat last. “Just like some folks' shiftlessness.”\r\n\r\n“They _asked_ it. They asked Mr. Evringham if that girl couldn't ride\r\nEssex Maid while he was in the city!”\r\n\r\n'Zekiel lifted his eyebrows politely. “Where are their remains to be\r\ninterred?” he inquired with concern.\r\n\r\n“Well, not in _this_ family vault, you may be sure. He gave it to them\r\nto-night for a fact.” Mrs. Forbes smiled triumphantly. “'I didn't know\r\nEloise remembered her father,'” she mimicked. “I'll bet that got under\r\ntheir skin!”\r\n\r\n“Dear parent, you're excited,” remarked Zeke.\r\n\r\nShe brought her reminiscent gaze back to rest upon her son. “Get your\r\ncoat quick, 'Zekiel. Here's the telegram. Take the car that passes the\r\npark gate, and stop at the station. That's the nearest place.”\r\n\r\nEzekiel obediently struggled into the coat hanging conveniently near.\r\n“What does the telegram say?--'Run away, little girl, the ogre isn't\r\nhungry'?”\r\n\r\n“Not much! She's coming. He's sending for the brat.”\r\n\r\n“Poor brat! How did it happen?”\r\n\r\n“Just some more of my lady's doings,” answered Mrs. Forbes angrily. “Of\r\ncourse she had to put in her oar and exasperate Mr. Evringham until he\r\ndid it to spite her.”\r\n\r\n“Cutting off his own nose to spite his face, eh?” asked Zeke, taking the\r\nslip of paper.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and mine. It's going to come heavy on me. I could have shaken that\r\nwoman with her airs and graces. Catch her or Mamzell lifting _their_\r\nhands!”\r\n\r\n“Yet they want her, do they?”\r\n\r\n“No, Stupid! That's why she's coming. Can't you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Blessed if I can,” returned the boy as he left the barn; “but I know\r\none thing, I pity the kid.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham received a prompt answer to his message. His son\r\nappointed, as a place of meeting, the downtown hotel where he and his\r\nwife purposed spending the night before sailing.\r\n\r\nFather and son had not met for years, and Mr. Evringham debated a few\r\nminutes whether to take the gastronomic and social risk of dining with\r\nHarry _en famille_ at the noisy hotel above mentioned, or to have dinner\r\nin assured comfort at his club--finally deciding on the latter course.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, nearly nine o'clock before his card was presented to\r\nMr. and Mrs. Harry, to whom it brought considerable relief of mind, and\r\nthey hastened down to the dingy parlor with alacrity.\r\n\r\n“You see we thought you might accept our invitation to dinner,” said\r\nHarry heartily, as he grasped his parent's passive hand; “but your\r\nbusiness hours are so short, I dare say you have been at home since the\r\nmiddle of the afternoon.” As he spoke the hard lines of his father's\r\nimpassive face smote him with a thousand associations, many of them\r\nbringing remorse. He wondered how much his own conduct had had to do\r\nwith graving them so deeply.\r\n\r\nHis wife's observant eyes were scanning this guardian of her child\r\nfrom the crown of his immaculate head to the toes of his correct patent\r\nleathers. His expressionless eyes turned to her. “This is your wife?” he\r\nasked, again offering the passive hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes, father, this is Julia,” responded Harry proudly. “I'm sorry the\r\ntime is so short. I do want you to know her.”\r\n\r\nThe young man's face grew eloquent.\r\n\r\n“That is a pleasure to come,” responded Mr. Evringham mechanically. He\r\nturned stiffly and cast a glance about. “You brought your daughter, I\r\npresume?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” answered Mrs. Evringham. “Harry was so glad to receive\r\nyour permission. We had made arrangements for her provisionally with\r\nfriends in Chicago, but we were desirous that she should have this\r\nopportunity to see her father's home and know you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham thought with regret of those friends in Chicago. Many\r\ntimes in the last two days he had deeply repented allowing himself to be\r\nexasperated into thus committing himself.\r\n\r\n“Do sit down, father,” said Harry, as his wife seated herself in the\r\nnearest chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham hesitated before complying. “Well,” he said perfunctorily,\r\n“you have gone into something that promises well, eh Harry?”\r\n\r\n“It looks that way. I'm chiefly occupied these days in being thankful.”\r\n The young man smiled with an extraordinary sweetness of expression,\r\nwhich transfigured his face, and which his father remembered well as\r\nalways promising much and performing nothing. “I might spend a lot of\r\ntime crying over spilt milk, but Julia says I mustn't,”--he glanced\r\nacross at his wife, whose dark eyes smiled back,--“and what Julia says\r\ngoes. I intend to spend a year or two doing instead of talking.”\r\n\r\n“It will answer better,” remarked his father.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” Harry's voice grew still more earnest. “And by that time,\r\nperhaps, I can express my regret to you, for things done and things left\r\nundone, with more convincingness.”\r\n\r\nThe older man made a slight gesture of rejection with one well-kept\r\nhand. “Let bygones be bygones,” he returned briefly.\r\n\r\n“When I think,” pursued Harry, his impulsive manner in strange contrast\r\nto that of his listener, “that if I had been behaving myself all this\r\ntime, I might have seen dear old Lawrence again!”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham kept silence.\r\n\r\n“How are Madge and Eloise? I thought perhaps Madge might come in and\r\nmeet us at the train.”\r\n\r\n“They are in the best of health, thank you. Eh--a--I think if you'll\r\ncall your daughter now we will go. It's rather a long ride, you know.\r\nNo express trains at this hour. When you return we will have more of a\r\nvisit.”\r\n\r\nHarry and his wife exchanged a glance. “Why Jewel is asleep,” answered\r\nthe young man after a pause. “She was so sleepy she couldn't hold her\r\neyes open.”\r\n\r\n“You mean you've let her go to bed?” asked Mr. Evringham, with a not\r\nvery successful attempt to veil his surprise and annoyance.\r\n\r\n“Why--yes. We supposed she would see us off, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Your memory is rather short, it strikes me,” returned his father. “You\r\nsail at eight A.M., I believe. Did you think I could get in from Bel-Air\r\nat that hour?”\r\n\r\n“No. I thought you would naturally remain in the city over night. You\r\nused to stay in rather frequently, didn't you?”\r\n\r\n“I've not done so for five years; but you couldn't know that. Is it out\r\nof the question to dress the child again? I hope she is too healthy to\r\nbe disturbed by a trifle like that.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham cast a startled look at her father-in-law. “It would\r\ndisappoint Jewel very much not to see us off,” she returned.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham shrugged his shoulders. “Let it go then. Let it go,” he\r\nsaid quickly.\r\n\r\nHarry's plain face had grown concerned. “Is Mrs. Forbes with you still?”\r\n he asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. I couldn't keep house without Mrs. Forbes. Well,” rising, “if\r\nyou young people will excuse me, I believe I will go to the club and\r\nturn in.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn't you stand it here one night, do you think?” asked Harry,\r\nrising. “The club is rather far uptown for such an early start.”\r\n\r\n“No. I'll be on hand. I'm used to rising early for a canter. I'll take\r\nit with a cab horse this time. That will be all the difference.” And\r\nwith this attempt at jocularity, Mr. Evringham shook hands once more and\r\ndeparted, swallowing his ill-humor as best he could. Any instincts of\r\nthe family man which might once have reigned in him had long since been\r\ninhibited. This episode was a cruel invasion upon his bachelor habits.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Harry and his wife without a word ascended to their room\r\nand with one accord approached the little bed in the corner where their\r\nchild lay asleep.\r\n\r\nThe man took his wife's hand. “I've done it now, Julia,” he said\r\ndejectedly. “It's my confounded optimism again.”\r\n\r\n“Your optimism is all right,” she returned, smoothing his hand gently,\r\nthough her heart was beating fast, and the vision of her father-in-law,\r\nwith his elegant figure and cold eyes, was weighing upon her spirit.\r\n\r\nHarry looked long on the plain little sleeping face, so like his own in\r\nspite of its exquisite child-coloring, and bending, touched the tossed,\r\nstraight, flaxen hair.\r\n\r\n“We couldn't take her, I suppose?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the yearning mother quietly. “We have prayed over it. We\r\nmust know that all will be right.”\r\n\r\n“His bark is worse than his bite,” said Harry doubtfully. “It always\r\nwas; and Mrs. Forbes is there.”\r\n\r\n“You say she is a kind sort of woman?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I suppose so,” uncertainly. “I never had much to do with her.”\r\n\r\n“And your sister? Isn't it very strange that she didn't come in to meet\r\nus? I was so certain I should put Jewel into her hands I feel a little\r\nbewildered.”\r\n\r\n“You're a trump!” ejaculated Harry hotly, “and you've married into a\r\nfamily where they're scarce. Madge might have met us at the train, at\r\nleast.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she is very sad over her loss,” suggested Julia.\r\n\r\n“In the best of health. Father said so. Oh well, she never was anything\r\nbut a big butterfly and Eloise a little one. I remember the last time\r\nI saw the child, a pretty fairy with her long pink silk stockings. She\r\nmust have been just about the age of Jewel.”\r\n\r\nThe mother stooped over the little bed and the dingy room looked\r\npleasanter for her smile. “Jewel hasn't any pink silk stockings,” she\r\nmurmured, and kissed the warm rose of the round cheek.\r\n\r\nThe little girl stirred and opened her eyes, at first vaguely, then with\r\na start.\r\n\r\n“Is it time for the boat?” she asked, trying to rise.\r\n\r\nHer father smoothed her hair. “No, time to go to sleep again. We're just\r\ngoing to bed. Good-night, Jewel.” He stooped to kiss her, and her arms\r\nmet around his neck.\r\n\r\n“It was an April fool, wasn't it?” she murmured sleepily, and was\r\nunconscious again.\r\n\r\nThe mother hid her face for a moment on her husband's shoulder. “Help\r\nme to feel that we're doing right,” she whispered, with a catch in her\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n“As if I could help _you_, Julia!” he returned humbly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, you can, dear.” She withdrew from his embrace, and going to\r\nthe dresser, took down her hair. The smiling face of a doll looked up at\r\nher from the neighboring chair, where it was sitting bolt upright. Her\r\ncostume was fresh from the modiste, and her feet, though hopelessly\r\npigeon-toed, were encased in bronze boots of a freshness which caught\r\nthe dim gaslight with a golden sheen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham smiled through her moist eyes.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jewel _was_ sleepy. She forgot to undress Anna Belle,” she said.\r\n\r\nLetting her hair fall about her like a veil, she caught up the doll and\r\npressed it to her heart impulsively. “You are going to stay with her,\r\nAnna Belle! I envy you, I envy you!” she whispered. An irrepressible\r\ntear fell on the sumptuous trimming of the little hat. “Be good to her;\r\ncomfort her, comfort her, little dolly.” Hastily wiping her eyes, she\r\nturned to her husband, still holding the doll. “We shall have to be very\r\ncareful, Harry, in the morning. If we are harboring one wrong or fearful\r\nthought, we must not let Jewel know it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I wish it were over! I wish the next month were over!” he replied\r\nrestively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBON VOYAGE\r\n\r\nAt the dock next morning the scene was one of the usual confusion. The\r\nsailing time was drawing near and Mr. Evringham had not appeared.\r\n\r\nHarry, with his little girl's hand in his, stood at the foot of the gang\r\nplank, peering at every newcomer and growing more anxious every moment.\r\nJewel occupied herself in throwing kisses to her mother, who stood at\r\nthe rail far above, never taking her eyes from the little figure in the\r\nblue sailor suit.\r\n\r\nThe child noted her father's set lips and the concentrated expression of\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n“If grandpa doesn't come what shall I do?” she asked without anxiety.\r\n\r\n“You'll go to England,” was the prompt response.\r\n\r\n“Without my trunk!” returned the child in protest.\r\n\r\nHer father looked again at the watch he held in his hand. The order to\r\ngo ashore was sending all visitors down the gang plank. “By George, I\r\nguess you're going, too,” he muttered between his teeth, when suddenly\r\nhis father's tall form came striding through the crowd. Mr. Evringham\r\nwas carrying a long pasteboard box, and seemed breathless.\r\n\r\n“Horse fell down. Devil of a time! Roses for your wife.”\r\n\r\nHarry grasped the box, touched his father's hand, kissed the child, and\r\nstrode up the plank amid the frowns of officials.\r\n\r\nJewel's eager eyes followed him, then, as he disappeared, lifted again\r\nto her mother, who smiled and waved her hand to Mr. Evringham. The\r\nlatter raised his hat and took the occasion to wipe his heated brow.\r\nHe was irritated through and through. The morning had been a chapter of\r\naccidents. Even the roses, which he had ordered the night before, had\r\nproved to be the wrong sort.\r\n\r\nThe suspense of the last fifteen minutes had been a distressing wrong\r\nto put upon any man. He had now before him the prospect of caring for a\r\nstrange child, of taking her out of town at an hour when he should have\r\nbeen coming into it. She would probably cry. Very well; if she did he\r\ndetermined on the instant to ride out to Bel-Air in the smoking car,\r\nalthough he detested its odors and uncleanness. The whole situation was\r\nenormous. What a fool he had been, and what an intelligent woman was\r\nMrs. Forbes! She had seen from the first the inappropriateness, the\r\nimpossibility, of the whole proposition. His attention was attracted to\r\nthe fact that the small figure at his side was hopping up and down with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“There's father, there's father!” she cried, as Harry joined his wife\r\nat the rail and they lifted the wealth of roses from the box and waved\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“We've wronged him, Harry!” exclaimed Julia, trying to see the little\r\nface below through her misty eyes. “How I love him for bringing me these\r\nsweet things! It gives me such a different feeling about him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, father would as soon forget his breakfast as roses for a woman he\r\nwas seeing off,” returned Harry without enthusiasm, while he waved his\r\nhat energetically.\r\n\r\nThe steamer pulled out. The faces in the crowd mingled and changed\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n“I've lost them, I've lost them!” cried Julia. “Oh, where are they,\r\nHarry.”\r\n\r\n“Over there near the corner. I can see father. It's all right, dear,”\r\n choking a little. “Jewel was skipping and laughing a minute ago. It will\r\nonly be a few weeks, but confound it,” violently, “next time we'll take\r\nher!”\r\n\r\nJulia buried her face in the roses, on which twinkled a sudden dew, and\r\ntried to gather promise from their sweet breath.\r\n\r\nJewel strained her eyes to follow the now indistinguishable forms on the\r\nlofty deck, and her grandfather looked down at the small figure in the\r\nsailor suit, the short thick pigtails of flaxen hair tied with large\r\nbows of ribbon, and the doll clasped in one arm. At last the child\r\nturned her head and looked up, and their eyes met for the first time.\r\n\r\n“Jove, she does look like Harry!” muttered Mr. Evringham, and even as he\r\nspoke the plain little face was illumined with the smile he knew, that\r\nsurpassingly sweet smile which promised so much and performed nothing.\r\n\r\nThe child studied him with open, innocent curiosity.\r\n\r\n“I can't believe it's you,” she said at last, in a voice light and\r\nwinning, a voice as sweet as the smile.\r\n\r\n“I don't wonder. I don't quite know myself this morning,” he replied\r\nbrusquely.\r\n\r\n“We have a picture of you, but it's a long-ago one, and I thought\r\nby this time you would be old, and--and bent over, you know, the way\r\ngrandpas are.”\r\n\r\nEven in that place of drays and at eight o'clock A.M. these words fell\r\nnot disagreeably upon irritated ears.\r\n\r\n“I think myself Nature did not intend me to be a grandpa,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, you're just the right kind,” returned the child hastily and\r\nconfidently. “Strong and--and handsome.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham looked at her in amazement. “The little rascal!” he\r\nthought. “Has she been coached?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose we may get away from here now,” he said aloud. “There's\r\nnothing more to wait for.”\r\n\r\n“Didn't the roses make mother happy?” asked the little girl, trotting\r\nalong beside his long strides. “I think it was wonderful for you to\r\nbring them so early in the morning.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham summoned a cab.\r\n\r\n“Oh, are we gong in a carriage?” cried Jewel, highly pleased. “But I\r\nmustn't forget, grandpa, there's something father told me I must give\r\nyou the first thing. Will you take Anna Belle a minute, please?” and Mr.\r\nEvringham found himself holding the doll fiercely by one leg while small\r\nhands worked at the catch of a very new little leather side-bag.\r\n\r\nAt last Jewel produced a brass square.\r\n\r\n“Oh, your trunk check.” Mr. Evringham exchanged the doll for it with\r\nalacrity. “Get in.” He held open the cab door.\r\n\r\nJewel obeyed, but not without some misgivings when her guardian so\r\ncoolly pocketed the check.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it's for my trunk,” she replied when her grandfather was beside\r\nher and they began rattling over the stones. “I have a checked silk\r\ndress,” she added softly, after a pause. It were well to let him know\r\nthe value of her baggage.\r\n\r\n“Have you indeed? How old are you, Julia? Your name is Julia, I\r\nbelieve?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, my _name's_ Julia, but so is mother's, and they call me\r\nJewel. I'm nearly nine, grandpa.”\r\n\r\n“H'm. Time flies,” was the brief response.\r\n\r\nJewel looked out of the cab window in the noisy silence that followed.\r\nAt last her voice was raised to sound through the clatter. “I suppose my\r\ntrunk is somewhere else,” she said suggestively.\r\n\r\n“Yes, your trunk will reach home all right, plaid silk and all.”\r\n\r\nJewel smiled, and lifting the doll she let her look out the window upon\r\nthe uninviting prospect. “Anna Belle's clothes are in the trunk, too,”\r\n she added, turning and speaking confidentially.\r\n\r\n“Whose?” asked Mr. Evringham, startled. “There's no one else coming, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n\r\n“Why, this is Anna Belle,” returned the child, laughing and lifting the\r\nbisque beauty so that the full radiance of her smile beamed upon her\r\ncompanion. “That's your great-grandfather, dearie, that I've told you\r\nabout,” she said patronizingly. “We've been so _excited_ the last few\r\ndays since we knew we were coming,” looking again at Mr. Evringham.\r\n“I've told Anna Belle all about beautiful Bel-Air Park, and the big\r\nhouse, and the big trees, and the ravine, and the brook. Isn't it nice,”\r\n joyfully, “that it doesn't rain to-day, and we shall see it in the\r\nsunshine?”\r\n\r\n“Rain would have made it more disagreeable certainly,” returned Mr.\r\nEvringham, congratulating himself that he was escaping that further rain\r\nof tears which he had dreaded. “It is a good day for your father and\r\nmother to set out on their trip,” he added.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and they're only to be gone six little weeks,” returned Jewel,\r\nsmoothing her doll's boa; “and I'm to have this lovely visit, and I'm to\r\nwrite them very often, and they'll write to me, and we shall all be so\r\nhappy!” Jewel trotted Anna Belle on her short-skirted knee and hummed a\r\ntune, which was lost in the rattle of wheels.\r\n\r\n“You can read and write, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Oh ye--es!” replied the child with amused scorn. “How would I get\r\nmy lessons if I couldn't read? Of course--big words,” she added\r\nconscientiously.\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” agreed Mr. Evringham dryly. “Big words, I dare say.”\r\n\r\nA sudden thought occurring to his companion, she looked up again.\r\n\r\n“You pretty nearly didn't come,” she said, “and just think, if you\r\nhadn't I was going to England. Father said so.”\r\n\r\nAt the sweet inflections of the child's voice Mr. Evringham's brows\r\ncontracted with remembrance of his wrongs. “I should have come. Your\r\nfather might have known that!”\r\n\r\n“I suppose he wouldn't have liked to leave me sitting on the dock alone,\r\nbut I should have known you'd come. The funny part is I shouldn't have\r\nknown _you_.” Jewel laughed. “I should have kept looking for an old\r\nman with white hair and a cane like Grandpa Morris. He's a grandpa in\r\nChicago that I know. He's just as kind as he can be, but he has the\r\n_queerest_ back. He goes to our church, but says he came in at the\r\neleventh hour. I think he used to have rheumatism. And while I was\r\nsitting there you could have walked right by me.”\r\n\r\n“Humph!”\r\n\r\n“But then you'd have known _me_,” went on Jewel, straightening Anna\r\nBelle's hat, “so it would have been all right. You'd have known there\r\nwould be only one little girl waiting there, and you would have said,\r\n'Oh, here you are, Jewel. I've come. I'm your grandpa.'” The child\r\nunconsciously mimicked the short, brusque speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham regarded her rather darkly. “Eh? I hope you're not\r\nimpudent?”\r\n\r\n“What's that?” asked Jewel doubtfully.\r\n\r\nHer companion's brow grew darker.\r\n\r\n“Impudent I say.”\r\n\r\n“And what is impudent?”\r\n\r\n“Don't you know?” suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” replied the child, some anxiety clouding her bright look. “Is\r\nit error?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham regarded her rather blankly. “It's something you mustn't\r\nbe,” he replied at last.\r\n\r\nJewel's face cleared. “Oh no, I won't then,” she replied earnestly. “You\r\ntell me when I'm--it, because I want to make you happy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham cleared his throat. He felt somewhat embarrassed and was\r\nglad they had reached the ferry.\r\n\r\n“We're going on a boat, aren't we?” she asked when they had passed\r\nthrough the gate.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and we can make this boat if we hurry.” Mr. Evringham suddenly\r\nfelt a little hand slide into his. Jewel was skipping along beside him\r\nto keep up with his long strides, and he glanced down at the bobbing\r\nflaxen head with its large ribbon bows, while the impulse to withdraw\r\nhis hand was thwarted by the closer clinging of the small fingers.\r\n\r\n“Father told me about the ferry,” said Jewel with satisfaction, “and\r\nyou'll show me the statue of Liberty won't you, grandpa? Isn't it a\r\nsplendid boat? Oh, can we go out close to the water?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham sighed heavily. He did not wish to go out close to the\r\nwater. He wished to sit down in comfort in the cabin and read the paper\r\nwhich he had just taken from a newsboy. It seemed to him a very long\r\ntime since he had done anything he wished to; but a little hand was\r\npulling eagerly at his, and mechanically he followed out to where the\r\nbrisk spring wind ruffled the river and assaulted his hat. He jerked his\r\nhand from Jewel's to hold it in place.\r\n\r\n“Isn't this beautiful!” cried the child joyfully, as the boat steamed\r\non. “Can you do this every day, grandpa?”\r\n\r\n“What? Oh yes, yes.”\r\n\r\nSomething in the tone caused the little girl to look up from her view of\r\nthe wide water spaces to the grim face above.\r\n\r\n“Is there something that makes you sorry, grandpa?” she asked softly.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were fixed on a ferry boat, black with its human freight, about\r\nto pass them on its way to the city.\r\n\r\n“I was wishing I were on that boat. That's all.”\r\n\r\nThe little girl lifted her shoulders. “I don't believe there's room,”\r\n she said, looking smilingly for a response from her companion. “I don't\r\nbelieve even Anna Belle could squeeze on. Do you think so?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham, holding his hat with one hand, was endeavoring to fetter\r\nthe lively corners of his newspaper in such shape that he could at least\r\nget a glimpse of headlines.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see a statue. Is that it, grandpa? Is that it?”\r\n\r\n“What?” vaguely. “Oh yes. The statue of Liberty. Yes, that's it. As\r\nif there was any liberty for anybody!” muttered Mr. Evringham into his\r\nmustache.\r\n\r\n“It isn't so very big,” objected Jewel.\r\n\r\n“We're not so very near it.”\r\n\r\n“Just think,” gayly, “father and mother are sailing away just the way we\r\nare.”\r\n\r\n“H'm,” returned Mr. Evringham, trying to read the report of the stock\r\nmarket, and becoming more impatient each instant with the sportive\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\n“Julia,” he said at last, “I am going into the cabin to read the paper.\r\nWill you go in, or do you wish to stay here?”\r\n\r\n“May I stay here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” doubtfully, “I suppose so, if you won't climb on the rail, or--or\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\nJewel laughed in gleeful appreciation of the joke. Her grandfather met\r\nher blue eyes unsmilingly and vanished.\r\n\r\n“I wish grandpa didn't look so sorry,” she thought regretfully. “He is\r\na very important man, grandpa is, and perhaps he has a lot of error to\r\nmeet and doesn't know how to meet it.”\r\n\r\nWatching the dancing waves and constantly calling Anna Belle's attention\r\nto some point of interest on the water front or a passing craft,\r\nshe nevertheless pursued a train of thought concerning her important\r\nrelative, with the result that when the gong sounded for landing, and\r\nMr. Evringham's impassive countenance reappeared, she met him with\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n“Doesn't it make you sorry to read the morning paper, grandpa?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes. Depends on the record of the Exchange.” There was somewhat\r\nless of the irritation of a newsless man in the morning in the speaker's\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n“Mother calls the paper the Daily Saddener,” pursued Jewel, again\r\nslipping her hand into her grandfather's as a matter of course as they\r\nmoved slowly off the boat. “I've been thinking that perhaps you're in a\r\nhurry to get to business, grandpa.”\r\n\r\nThe child did not quote his words about the ingoing ferry boat lest he\r\nshould feel regret at having spoken them.\r\n\r\n“Well, there's no use in my being in a hurry this morning,” he returned.\r\n\r\n“I was going to ask, couldn't you show me how to go to Bel-Air, so you\r\nwouldn't have to take so much time?”\r\n\r\nA gleam of hope came into Mr. Evringham's cold eyes and he looked down\r\non his companion doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“We have to go out on the train,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned the child, “but you could put me on it, and every time\r\nit stops I would ask somebody if that was Bel-Air.”\r\n\r\nThe prospect this offered was very pleasing to the broker.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn't be afraid, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Be what?” asked Jewel, looking up at him with a certain reproachful\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn't, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Why, grandpa!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I believe it would do well enough, since you don't mind. Zeke is\r\ngoing to meet this train. I'll tell the conductor to see that you get\r\noff at Bel-Air, and when you do, ask for Mr. Evringham's coachman.\r\nYou'll see Zeke, a light-haired man driving a brown horse in a brougham.\r\nHe'll take you home to his mother, Mrs. Forbes. She is my housekeeper.\r\nNow, do you think you'll understand?”\r\n\r\n“It sounds very easy,” returned Jewel.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham's long legs and her short skipping ones lost no time in\r\nboarding the train, which they found made up. The relieved man saw the\r\nconductor, paid the child's fare, and settled her on the plush seat.\r\n\r\nShe sat there, contentedly swinging her feet.\r\n\r\n“Now I can just catch a boat if I leave you immediately,” said Mr.\r\nEvringham consulting his watch. “You've only a little more than five\r\nminutes to wait before the train starts.”\r\n\r\n“Then hurry, grandpa, I'm all right.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Your fare is paid, and the conductor understands. You might\r\nask somebody, though. Bel-Air, you know. Good-by.”\r\n\r\nHastily he strode down the aisle and left the train. Having to pass the\r\nwindow beside which Jewel sat, he glanced up with a half uneasy memory\r\nof how far short of the floor her feet had swung.\r\n\r\nShe was watching for him. On her lips was the sweet gay smile and--yes,\r\nthere was no mistake--Anna Belle's countenance was beaming through the\r\nglass, and she was wafting kisses to Mr. Evringham from a stiff and\r\nchubby hand. The stockbroker grew warm, cleared his throat, lifted his\r\nhat, and hurried his pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nJEWEL'S ARRIVAL\r\n\r\nWhen her grandfather had disappeared, Jewel placed Anna Belle on\r\nthe seat beside her, where she toed in, in a state of the utmost\r\ncomplacence.\r\n\r\n“I have my work to do, Anna Belle,” she said, “and this will be a good\r\ntime, so don't disturb me till the train starts.” She put her hand over\r\nher eyes, and sat motionless as the people met and jostled in the aisle.\r\n\r\nMinutes passed, and then some one brushed the child's arm in taking\r\nthe seat beside her. “Oh, please don't sit on Anna Belle!” she cried\r\nsuddenly, and looked up into a pair of clear eyes that were regarding\r\nher with curiosity.\r\n\r\nThey belonged to a man with a brown mustache and dark, short, pointed\r\nbeard, who carried a small square black case and had altogether a very\r\nclean, fresh, agreeable appearance.\r\n\r\n“Do I look like a person who would sit on Anna Belle?” he asked gravely.\r\n\r\nThe doll was enthroned upon his knee as he set down his case, and the\r\ntrain started.\r\n\r\n“If she annoys you I'll take her,” said Jewel, with a little air of\r\nmotherliness not lost upon her companion.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” he replied, “but I'm used to children. She looks like a\r\nfine, healthy little girl,” keeping his eyes fixed on the doll's rosy\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n“Yes indeed. She's very healthy.”\r\n\r\n“Not had measles, or chicken pox, or mumps, or any of those things yet?”\r\n pursued the pleasant voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh dear!” gasped Jewel. “Please let me take Anna Belle.” She caught her\r\ndoll into her arms and met her companion's surprised gaze.\r\n\r\n“I haven't any of them,” he returned, amused. “Don't be afraid.”\r\n\r\n“I'm not afraid,” answered the child promptly. “There is nothing to be\r\nafraid of.”\r\n\r\n“I was only going to say,” said the young man, “that if she was ailing I\r\ncould prescribe for her. I have my case right here.”\r\n\r\nJewel's startled look fell to the black case. “What's that! Medicine?”\r\n she asked softly.\r\n\r\n“It certainly is. So you see you have a doctor handy if anything ails\r\nthe baby.”\r\n\r\nThe child gazed at him with grave scrutiny. “Do you believe in materia\r\nmedica?” she asked.\r\n\r\nThe young doctor threw back his head and laughed heartily. “Well, yes,”\r\n he answered at last. “I am supposed to.”\r\n\r\nTo his surprise his neighbor returned to the attitude in which he had\r\nfound her, with one hand over her eyes.\r\n\r\nHe ceased laughing and looked at her in some discomfiture. Her mouth was\r\nset seriously. There was no quiver of the rosy lips.\r\n\r\nTo his relief, in a minute she dropped her hand and began to hum and\r\narrange her doll's hat.\r\n\r\nThe conductor approached, and as the doctor presented his ticket, he\r\nsaid, “This little girl's fare is paid, I believe.” The conductor nodded\r\nand passed on.\r\n\r\n“I'm to get off at Bel-Air,” said Jewel. “I hope he doesn't forget.”\r\n\r\n“If he does, I shan't,” said the doctor, “for I'm going to get off there\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nThe child's eyes brightened. “Isn't that nice!” she returned. Then she\r\nlifted Anna Belle and whispered something into her ear.\r\n\r\n“No secrets,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\n“I was just reminding Anna belle how we are always taken care of,”\r\n returned Jewel.\r\n\r\nThe young man regarded her with increasing interest and curiosity.\r\n\r\n“Don't you wonder how I knew that your fare was paid?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“How did you?”\r\n\r\n“I met Mr. Evringham hurrying through the station. He said his\r\ngranddaughter was on this train and asked me to look out for a little\r\ngirl with a doll.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” returned the child, pleased, “then you know grandpa.”\r\n\r\n“I've known him ever since I was no bigger than you are. But even then,”\r\n added the doctor mentally, “I hadn't supposed him capable of sending\r\nthis baby out from the city alone.”\r\n\r\nJewel watched the kind eyes attentively. “So you see,” he went on, “all\r\nI had to do was to look for Anna Belle.”\r\n\r\n“And you nearly sat on her,” declared the child.\r\n\r\n“I deny it,” returned the doctor gravely. “I deny it. You weren't\r\nlooking. For one second I was afraid you were crying.”\r\n\r\n“Crying! What would I be crying for, coming to have a lovely visit at\r\ngrandpa's!”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you are in a hurry to see your aunt and cousin?” remarked the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I don't know them. You see,” explanatorily, “they aren't my\r\nreal relations.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“No, aunt Madge is my uncle's wife and cousin Eloise is her little girl,\r\nbut not uncle Lawrence's.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor thought a minute.\r\n\r\n“Really? She is a very charming little girl, is your cousin Eloise.\r\nAren't you going to tell me your name?”\r\n\r\n“My name is Jewel.”\r\n\r\n“And I am Dr. Ballard, so now we are properly introduced.” He smiled\r\nupon her with merry eyes, and she responded politely:--\r\n\r\n“I'm very glad you found us.”\r\n\r\nArrived at Bel-Air, the doctor picked up his case and Jewel followed him\r\nfrom the train. He looked about expectantly for Mrs. Evringham or her\r\ndaughter. They were not there.\r\n\r\nThe little girl's quick eyes discerned a light-haired driver and a brown\r\nhorse coming around a curve of the pretty landscape gardening which\r\nbeautified the station. At the same moment Dr. Ballard recognized the\r\nequipage with relief.\r\n\r\n“They've sent for you. That is all right,” he said, and 'Zekiel, with\r\none side glance at the little stranger, drew up by the platform.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, Zeke. Here is your passenger.” He lifted Jewel to her\r\nplace beside the driver, whose smooth, stolid face did not change\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n“Do I wait for Mr. Evringham?” he asked, without turning his head in its\r\nstiff collar.\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Evringham remained in town.”\r\n\r\n“Is there a trunk?” pursued Zeke immovably.\r\n\r\n“How about your trunk, little one?” asked the doctor.\r\n\r\nJewel produced a paper check. “A man gave grandpa this for it at the\r\nboat place.”\r\n\r\n“I'll see to having it sent up then.” The doctor looked along the\r\nplatform. “It didn't come this trip.” He took the child's hand in his.\r\n“I shall see you again before long. Good-by.”\r\n\r\nJewel looked after his retreating figure with some regret. Her present\r\ncompanion seemed carved out of wood. His plum-colored livery fitted\r\nwithout a wrinkle. His smooth, solemn face appeared incapable of speech.\r\n\r\nThe swift horse trotted through the village street at a great pace, and\r\nthe visitor enjoyed the novel experience so intensely that she could not\r\nforbear stealing a look up at the driver's face.\r\n\r\nHe caught it. “Ain't afraid, are you?” he asked.\r\n\r\nShe looked doubtful. “Is it error for the horse to go so fast?” she\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n“Error?” Zekiel regarded the child curiously. “Well, I guess it's\r\nconsidered one o' the biggest virtues a horse can have.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you ask me if I was afraid? You're the third person who's\r\nasked me that this morning,” returned Jewel, with wondering inflections\r\nin her soft voice. “Are New York people afraid of things?”\r\n\r\n“Well, not so's you'd notice it as a rule,” returned Zeke. “I'm glad if\r\nshe ain't one o' the scared kind,” he pursued, as if to himself.\r\n\r\n“Oh, this is splendid,” declared Jewel, relieved by her companion's\r\nsmile; “I don't know as Anna Belle ever had such a good ride. See the\r\ntrees, dearie! How the leaves are coming out! They aren't nearly so\r\nfar out in Chicago; but oh,” as the horse turned, “there's a big storm\r\ncoming! What a black cloud! We're just in time.”\r\n\r\n“I don't see any cloud,” said Zeke, staring about.\r\n\r\n“Why, right there in front of us,” excitedly, pointing at the long\r\nopaque mass against the sky.\r\n\r\n“That? Why, that's hills.” Zeke laughed. “The mountain they call it\r\nhere. Pretty sickly mountain we'd think it was up Berkshire way.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it's a mountain, Anna Belle,” joyfully, “we're really seeing a\r\nmountain!”\r\n\r\n“No you ain't,” remarked Zeke emphatically. “Not by a large majority.\r\nGuess Chicago's some flat, ain't it?”\r\n\r\n“We don't have hills, no. So now we're going to see grandpa's park, and\r\nthe ravine, and the brook, and--and everything!”\r\n\r\nZeke stole a furtive look at the owner of the joyous voice. The\r\nvoluminous ribbon bows behind her ears were mostly in evidence, as she\r\nbent her face over her doll in congratulation.\r\n\r\n“Left Mr. Evringham in town, did you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he was busy, and in a hurry to get to his office. Grandpa's such\r\nan important man.”\r\n\r\n“Is he?” asked Zeke.\r\n\r\n“Why ye--es! Didn't you know it?”\r\n\r\n“I surmised something of the kind. So Dr. Ballard looked after you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,--and I do hope my trunk will come.”\r\n\r\nJewel looked wistfully at the driver. In spite of his stiff and elegant\r\nappearance he had been surprisingly affable. “I have a checked silk\r\ndress,” she added modestly.\r\n\r\n“You don't say so!” ejaculated Zeke, wholly won by the smile bent upon\r\nhim. “Well, now, if that trunk don't show up by noon, I'll have to do\r\nsomething about it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you!” exclaimed the child.\r\n\r\nThey now sped through the gates of the park and by the porter's lodge,\r\nand began the ascent of a winding road. Handsome residences were set\r\namong the fine trees, and at sight of each one Jewel looked expectant\r\nand eager.\r\n\r\n“I expect mother'll be kind of looking out for us,” continued Zeke.\r\n“Poor kid!” he added mentally.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa said something about your mother.”\r\n\r\n“His housekeeper, Mrs. Forbes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, of course I know about Mrs. Forbes,” returned Jewel hastily and\r\npolitely. “He told me your name too,” she added suggestively.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I'm Zeke. And you just remember,” emphatically, “that I come when\r\nI'm called. Will you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the child, laughing a little. “Do you know my name?”\r\n\r\n“It's Julia, isn't it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but if you called me by it perhaps I shouldn't come, for I'm used\r\nto the name of Jewel.”\r\n\r\n“Pretty name, all right,” returned Zeke sententiously. “Now you can see\r\nyour grandpa's house. The one with the long porch.”\r\n\r\nJewel jumped up and down a little in the seat and held Anna Belle to get\r\na good view. The brown horse trotted with a will, and in a minute more\r\nthey had passed up the driveway and paused beneath the _porte-cochere_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes threw open the door and stood unsmiling.\r\n\r\n“Where is Mr. Evringham?” she asked, addressing her son.\r\n\r\n“Stayed in town.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper stepped forward and helped down the little girl, who had\r\nrisen and was looking brightly expectant.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Julia,” she said. “Did you come out alone on the cars?”\r\n\r\n“No. Dr. Ballard came with me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that was the way of it. Zeke, hitch up the brougham. The ladies are\r\ngoing out to lunch.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn't they let me know?” grumbled Zeke. “Could have hitched up the\r\nbrougham just as well in the first place.”\r\n\r\n“Don't ask _me_,” returned his mother acidly. “Where is your bag, Julia?\r\nI hope you haven't left it in the train?”\r\n\r\n“No, I didn't have any. I used mother's. She knew I'd have my trunk\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\n“Then come in and I'll show you where your room is.”\r\n\r\nThe child looked eagerly and admiringly from side to side as she\r\nfollowed Mrs. Forbes up two flights of broad shallow stairs and into an\r\napartment which to her eyes seemed luxurious.\r\n\r\n“Was this ever my father's room?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Why yes, I believe it was,” returned Mrs. Forbes, to whom that\r\ncircumstance had not before occurred.\r\n\r\n“How kind of grandpa to let me have it!” said Jewel, highly pleased.\r\n\r\n“He wasn't in it much, your father wasn't. Away at school or some other\r\nplace mostly. Where's your trunk?”\r\n\r\n“It's coming. Zeke said he'd attend to it.” Jewel looked up happily. “I\r\nhave a”--she was intending to communicate to Mrs. Forbes the exciting\r\ndetail of her wardrobe when the housekeeper interrupted her.\r\n\r\n“My son's name is Ezekiel,” she said impressively.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” returned Jewel abashed. “He told me Zeke.” She still stood in the\r\nmiddle of the large white room, Anna Belle in her arms, and with the\r\nsurprised look in her serious face drew upon herself an unflattering\r\nmental comment.\r\n\r\n“The image of Harry,” thought Mrs. Forbes.\r\n\r\n“Can I see aunt Madge and cousin Eloise?” asked the child, beginning to\r\nfeel some awe of the large woman regarding her.\r\n\r\n“They're getting ready to go out to lunch. They can't be disturbed now.\r\nYou can sit here, or walk around until lunch time. You'll know when\r\nthat is ready, because the gong will sound in the hall. Now when you go\r\ndownstairs be careful not to touch the tall clock on the landing. That\r\nis a very valuable chiming clock, and you mustn't open its doors, for\r\nfear you would break something. Then if you go into the parlor you must\r\nnever play on the piano unless you ask somebody, for fear Mr. Evringham\r\nmight be trying to take a nap just at that time; then you mustn't go\r\ninto the barn without permission, for it's dangerous where the horses\r\nare, and you might get kicked. If you're tired from your journey you can\r\nlie down now till lunch time; but whenever you do lie down, be sure to\r\nturn off this white spread, for fear you might soil it. Now I'm very\r\nbusy, and I shan't see you again till lunch.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes departed and Jewel stood for half a minute motionless,\r\nfeeling rather dazed by a novel sensation of resentment.\r\n\r\n“As if we were babies!” she whispered to her doll. “She's the most\r\nafraid woman I ever saw, and she looks so _sorry_! She isn't our\r\nrelation, so no matter, dearie, what she says. This is father's room,\r\nand we can think how he used to run around here when he was a little\r\nboy.”\r\n\r\nTiptoeing to the door, Jewel closed it and began to inspect her new\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nThe sweet smelling soap on the marble stand, the silver mountings of the\r\nfaucets, the large fine towels, the empty closet and drawers, all looked\r\ninviting. Throughout her examination the little girl kept pausing to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nSurely aunt Madge and cousin Eloise would look in before they went out\r\nto their engagement. Mother had so often said how nice it was that they\r\nwere there. Surely they didn't know that she had arrived. That was it,\r\nof course; and Mrs. Forbes was so sorry and anxious she would probably\r\nforget to tell them.\r\n\r\nSome altercation was just then going on in the apartments of those\r\nladies.\r\n\r\n“We ought to speak to her before we go,” said Mrs. Evringham\r\npersuasively. “Father would probably resent it if we didn't.”\r\n\r\n“I have told you already,” returned Eloise, “that I do not intend doing\r\none thing henceforward that grandfather could interpret as being done to\r\nplease him.”\r\n\r\n“But that is carrying it ridiculously far, not to greet your cousin, who\r\nhas come from a journey and is your guest.”\r\n\r\n“My guest!” returned the girl derisively. “We are hers more likely. I\r\nwill not go to her. The sooner grandfather sends us away the better.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham looked worried.\r\n\r\n“This is mania, Eloise!” she returned coaxingly. “Very well, I shall go\r\nand speak to the child. She shan't be able to tell her grandfather of\r\nany rudeness.”\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Jewel, sitting by her window, Anna Belle in her lap,\r\nheard the _frou-frou_ of skirts in the hall, and with a knock at the\r\ndoor, a lady entered. She was arrayed in a thin black gown and wore a\r\nlarge black hat, that was very becoming.\r\n\r\nJewel's admiration went out to her on the instant and she started up.\r\n\r\nThe lady swept toward her, and bending, a delicate perfume wafted about\r\nJewel as she felt a light touch of lips on her cheek.\r\n\r\n“So this is Julia Evringham,” said the newcomer.\r\n\r\n“And you are aunt Madge,” returned the child gladly, clinging to the\r\ngloved hand, which endured for a moment, and then firmly disengaged\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n“Your father and mother got off all right I hope?” went on the airy\r\nvoice. “I'm always afraid of winds at this season myself, but they may\r\nnot have them. Your cousin Eloise and I are hurrying away to a luncheon,\r\nbut we shall see you at dinner. You're very comfortable here? That's\r\nright. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nShe swept away, and the light again faded from Jewel's face as she went\r\nslowly back to her seat.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Madge is afraid, too,” she said to the doll. “We know there won't\r\nbe winds, don't we, dearie? God will take care of father and mother.”\r\n\r\nAn uncomfortable lump rose towards the child's throat.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham followed Eloise into the brougham, smiling.\r\n\r\n“It couldn't be better,” she announced with much satisfaction as they\r\ndrove away.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“She is plain--oh, plain as possible. Small eyes, large mouth,\r\ninsignificant nose. She will never get on with father. He never\r\ncould endure ugliness in a girl or woman. I have heard him say it was\r\nunpardonable. If it hadn't been that we were what we are, Eloise, I\r\nshould never have dreamed of doing as I have done. Now if only some good\r\nfairy would open your eyes to see which side your bread is buttered on!\r\nYou could do marvels with such a foil for contrast.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EVENING\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of the early morning start, Jewel had eaten little\r\nbreakfast, but the soft resonance of the Japanese gong, when it sounded\r\nin the hall below, found her unready for food.\r\n\r\nHowever, she judged the mellow sound to be her summons and obediently\r\nleft her seat by the window. As she went down she looked askance at\r\nthe tall dark clock which, even as she passed, chimed the half hour\r\nmelodiously. Certainly her important grandfather lived in a wonderful\r\nhouse. She paused to hear the last notes of the bells, but catching\r\nsight of the figure of Mrs. Forbes waiting below, she started and moved\r\non.\r\n\r\n“That's right. Come along,” said the housekeeper. “Mr. Evringham likes\r\neverybody to be punctual in his house.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, has grandpa come home?” inquired Jewel eagerly.\r\n\r\n“No, he won't be home for hours yet. Come this way.”\r\n\r\nThe little girl followed to the dining-room, which she thought quite as\r\nwonderful as the clock; but her admiration of all she saw was no longer\r\nunmixed. Mrs. Forbes seemed to cast a shadow.\r\n\r\nOne place was laid at the table, one handsome chair was drawn up to it.\r\nJewel longed to call Anna Belle's attention to the glittering array on\r\nthe sideboard and behind the crystal doors of cabinets, but something\r\nwithheld her.\r\n\r\nShe looked questioningly at the housekeeper. “I think I'll draw up\r\nanother chair for Anna Belle,” she said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes had already decided, from small signs of assurance, that\r\nthis Western child was bold. “Give her an inch, and she'll take an ell,”\r\n she had said to herself. “I know her sort.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean the doll?” she returned. “Put it down anywhere. You must\r\nnever bring it to the table. Mr. Evringham wouldn't like it.”\r\n\r\nIn silence Jewel seated the doll in the nearest chair against the wall,\r\nand as she slid up into her own, a neat maid appeared with a puffy and\r\nappetizing omelet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes filled the child's glass with water, and the maid set down\r\nthe omelet and departed.\r\n\r\nJewel's heart sank while Mrs. Forbes presented the souffle.\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry,” she began hesitatingly, “I never--I can't”--then she\r\nswallowed hard in her desperate plight. “Isn't it pretty?” she said\r\nrather breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“It's very good,” returned the housekeeper briefly, misconstruing the\r\nchild's hesitation. “Shall I help you?”\r\n\r\n“I--could I have a drink of milk? I don't--I don't eat eggs.”\r\n\r\n“Don't eat eggs?” repeated the housekeeper severely. “I'm sorry you\r\nhave been allowed to be notional. Children should eat what is set before\r\nthem. Taste of it.”\r\n\r\n“I--I couldn't, please.” Jewel's face was averted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes touched an electric bell. The maid reappeared. “Remove the\r\nomelet, Sarah, and bring Miss Julia a glass of milk.”\r\n\r\nThat was the order, but oh, the tone of it! Jewel's heart beat a little\r\nfaster as she took some bread and butter and drank the milk, Mrs. Forbes\r\nstanding by, a portentous, solemn, black-robed figure, awful in its\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWhen the child set down the glass empty, she started to push back her\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Mrs. Forbes laconically. She again touched an electric\r\nbell. The maid reappeared, removed the bread and milk and served a\r\ndainty dessert of preserved peaches, cream, and cake.\r\n\r\n“I've really had enough,” said Jewel politely.\r\n\r\n“Don't you eat peaches and cream, or cake either?” asked Mrs. Forbes\r\naccusingly.\r\n\r\n“Yes'm,” returned the child, and ate them without further ado.\r\n\r\n“Your trunk has come,” said Mrs. Forbes when at last Jewel slipped down\r\nfrom the table. “I will come up and help you unpack it.”\r\n\r\n“If only she wouldn't!” thought the child as she lifted Anna Belle, but\r\nthe housekeeper preceded her up the stairs, breathing rather heavily.\r\n\r\nSure enough, when they reached the white room, there stood the new trunk\r\nthat had been packed with so much anticipation. The bright black letters\r\non the side, J. E., had power even now to send a little glow of pride\r\nthrough its possessor. She stole a glance at Mrs. Forbes, but, strange\r\nas it may appear, the housekeeper gave no evidence of admiration.\r\n\r\n“I don't need to trouble you, Mrs. Forbes. I can unpack it,” said the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n“I'm up here now, and anyway, I'd better show you where to keep your\r\nthings. Where's your key?”\r\n\r\nJewel laid down the doll and opened her leather side-bag, producing the\r\nkey tied with a little ribbon.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes unlocked the trunk, lifted out the tray, and began in a\r\nbusiness-like manner to dispose of the small belongings that had last\r\nbeen handled so tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Harry certainly knows how to pack,” ran her thoughts, “and she'd\r\nnaturally know how to sew. These things are as neat as wax, and the\r\nchild's well fixed.” In the tray, among other things, were a number of\r\ndoll's clothes, some writing materials, a box of different colored hair\r\nribbons, and a few books.\r\n\r\n“Glad to see a Bible,” thought Mrs. Forbes. “Shows Mrs. Harry is\r\nrespectable.” She glanced at the three other books. One was a copy of\r\n“Heidi,” one was “Alice in Wonderland,” and the third a small black book\r\nwith the design of a cross and crown in gilt on the cover. Mrs. Forbes\r\nlooked from this up at the child.\r\n\r\n“What's this? Some kind of a daily book, Julia?”\r\n\r\n“I--yes, I read it every day.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I hope you'll be faithful now your mother's gone. She's taken the\r\ntrouble to put it in.”\r\n\r\nJewel's eyes had caught a glimpse of green color. Eagerly she reached\r\ndown into the trunk and drew out carefully a dress in tiny checks of\r\ngreen and white.\r\n\r\n“That's my silk dress,” she said, regarding it fondly.\r\n\r\n“It is very neatly made,” returned Mrs. Forbes repressively. “It doesn't\r\nmatter at all what little girls have on if they are clean and neat. It\r\nonly matters that they shall be obedient and good.”\r\n\r\nJewel regarded her with the patience which children exercise toward\r\nthe inevitable. “I'd like to fix Anna Belle's drawer myself,” she said\r\nmodestly.\r\n\r\n“Very well, you may. Now here are your shoes and slippers, but I don't\r\nfind any rubbers.”\r\n\r\n“No, I never wear rubbers.”\r\n\r\n“What? Doesn't it rain in Chicago?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes indeed, it rains.”\r\n\r\n“Then you must get your feet wet. I think you better have had rubbers\r\nthan a silk dress! What was your mother thinking of?”\r\n\r\nJewel sighed vaguely. She wondered how soon Mrs. Forbes would go away.\r\n\r\nThis happy event occurred before long, and the little girl amused\r\nherself for a while with rearranging somewhat the closet and drawers.\r\nThen putting on her hat and taking her doll with her, she stole quietly\r\ndown the thickly carpeted stairs, and opening the heavy hall door, went\r\nout upon the piazza. It was sheltered from the wind, and wicker chairs\r\nwere scattered about. Jewel looked off curiously amid the trees to where\r\nshe knew, by her father's description, she should find, after a few\r\nminutes' ramble, the ravine and brook. Pretty soon she would wander out\r\nthere. Just now the sun was warm here, and the roomy chairs held out\r\ninviting arms. The child climbed into one of them. Father would come\r\nback here some happy day and find her. The thought brought a smile,\r\nand with the smile on her lips, her head fell back against a yielding\r\ncushion, and in a minute she had fallen asleep. Anna Belle toppled\r\nover backward. Her plumed hat was pushed rakishly askew, but little she\r\ncared. Her eyelids had fallen, too.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham and Eloise, returning late from their luncheon, came upon\r\nthe little sleeping figure as they walked around the long piazza.\r\n\r\n“There she is!” exclaimed Mrs. Evringham softly, putting up her\r\nlorgnette. “Behold your rival!”\r\n\r\nEloise regarded the sleeper without curiosity.\r\n\r\n“At least she has not come uninvited,” was her only comment.\r\n\r\n“But she has come unwelcome, my dear,” returned Mrs. Evringham with\r\nrelish. “Just wait until our gracious host realizes what he has let\r\nhimself in for. Oh, there's a good time coming, you may be sure. Hush,\r\ndon't waken her! It would be a blessed dispensation if she were always\r\nto sleep while her grandfather is absent,” and Mrs. Evringham led the\r\nway into the house, her laces fluttering.\r\n\r\nOn the first landing the ladies met Mrs. Forbes, troubled of\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n“I am looking for the child Julia,” she said. “I can't think where she\r\ncan have disappeared.”\r\n\r\n“You've not far to seek,” returned Mrs. Evringham airily. “She is asleep\r\non the piazza.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.” Mrs. Forbes hastened downstairs and out of doors. Glancing\r\nabout she quickly perceived the short legs stretched in a reclining\r\nchair, and advanced toward the relaxed little figure.\r\n\r\n“Julia, wake up!” she said, touching her.\r\n\r\nThe child stirred and opened her eyes. Her movement made the doll slip\r\nto the floor, and this caused her to come to herself suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Why, I fell asleep, didn't I?” she said drowsily, reaching for the\r\ndoll.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and in Mr. Evringham's own chair!” responded Mrs. Forbes.\r\n\r\n“They're all his, aren't they?” asked the child.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but this is his special favorite, where he always lies to rest.\r\nRemember!” returned Mrs. Forbes. “Come right upstairs now and change\r\nyour dress for dinner. He will be coming home in a few minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, good!” exclaimed Jewel with satisfaction, and passed into the\r\nhouse. Mrs. Forbes was following ponderously. “Oh, you don't need to\r\ncome with me,” protested the child earnestly. “I can do it all myself.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?” doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Oh, ye--es!” replied the little girl, running lightly up the stairs.\r\n\r\n“I ought to put her on the second floor,” mused Mrs. Forbes, “if I've\r\ngot to be running up and down; but I suppose she has done for herself a\r\ngreat deal. I suppose the mother hadn't time to be bothered. I'd like to\r\nmake Mamzell change rooms with her.”\r\n\r\nJewel hummed a tune as she took off her sailor suit, performed her\r\nablutions, and then went to her closet to choose a frock for dinner. She\r\ndecided on a blue dress with white dots chiefly because she would\r\nnot have to change her hair ribbons. She had never herself tied those\r\nvoluminous bows.\r\n\r\nAt last she was ready and danced toward the door, but some novel\r\ntimidity made her hesitate and go back sedately to the chair by the\r\nwindow. Mrs. Forbes's impressive figure seemed to loom up with an order\r\nto her to wait the summons of the gong.\r\n\r\nShe sat there for what seemed a very long time, and at last a knock\r\nsounded at the door. Perhaps grandpa had come up. Jewel flew to open to\r\nhim--and saw the white capped maid who had appeared at luncheon.\r\n\r\n“They are all at table, and Mr. Evringham wishes you to come down,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“But I was waiting for the gong.”\r\n\r\n“We only have that at noon.”\r\n\r\nJewel's feet flew down the stairs. Her grandfather had sent for her. She\r\nwas eager to reach him, yet when she entered the dining-room, her little\r\nface all alight, it was not so easy to run to him as she had fancied.\r\n\r\nHe sat stiffly at the foot of the table. Opposite him was aunt Madge,\r\nand at her left sat the prettiest young lady the child had ever seen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes stood near Mr. Evringham, looking very serious.\r\n\r\nJewel took in all this at a glance, and contenting herself with greeting\r\nher grandfather's lifted eyes with a smile, she ran to Mrs. Evringham\r\nand turned her back.\r\n\r\n“There's just one button in the middle, aunt Madge, that I can't reach,”\r\n she explained softly.\r\n\r\nEvery eye at the table was regarding the child curiously, but she took\r\nno note of any one but her grandfather, and her dress buttoned, she\r\nran to her chair and slid up on its smooth morocco. Eloise observed the\r\nlittle girl's loving expression.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry you are late, Julia,” said Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“Yes, so am I, grandpa,” was the prompt response. “I wanted to be down\r\nhere as soon as you came home, but I thought I ought to wait for the\r\ngong, and then it didn't ring.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes roved to where, directly opposite, the beautiful young lady was\r\nregarding her soberly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham spoke. “That is your cousin Eloise, Julia.”\r\n\r\nEloise inclined her graceful head, but made no further recognition of\r\nthe child's admiring look.\r\n\r\n“They haven't met before?” said Mr. Evringham, looking from one to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“No,” returned Mrs. Evringham with her most gracious manner. “It just\r\nhappened that Eloise and I were engaged at luncheon to-day, and when we\r\nreturned the little girl was taking a nap.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Mrs. Forbes had brought Jewel's soup and she was eating.\r\nShe looked up brightly at Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“Yes, grandpa, I went to sleep in your big chair on the piazza. I didn't\r\nknow it was your special chair until Mrs. Forbes waked me up.”\r\n\r\nHer grandfather regarded her from under his heavy brows. He was\r\nresenting the fact that Eloise had made no effort to welcome the child.\r\n“Indeed?” he returned. “What did she wake you up for?”\r\n\r\n“Because it was time to get ready for dinner,” returned Jewel. “It\r\nreminded me of the story of Golden Hair, when she had gone to sleep on\r\nthe bear's bed, the way Mrs. Forbes said, 'This is your grandfather's\r\nchair!'”\r\n\r\nShe looked around the table, expectant of sympathy. Only Mrs. Evringham\r\nseemed to wish to laugh, and she was making heroic efforts not to do so.\r\nLovely Eloise kept her serious eyes downcast.\r\n\r\n“Ha!” ejaculated Mr. Evringham, after a lightning glance of suspicion\r\nat his daughter-in-law. “I think I remember something about that. But\r\nGolden Hair tried three beds, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she did, but you see there wasn't any little bear's chair on the\r\npiazza.”\r\n\r\n“Very true. Very true.”\r\n\r\n“Golden Hair was a great beauty, I believe,” suggested Mrs. Evringham,\r\nlooking at the child oddly. “She had yellow hair like yours.”\r\n\r\nJewel put up a quick hand to the short tight braid which ended behind\r\nher ear. “Oh no, long, lovely, floating hair. Don't you remember?”\r\n\r\n“It's a good while since I read it,” returned Mrs. Evringham, laughing\r\nlow and glancing at Eloise. Her father-in-law sent her a look of\r\ndispleasure and turned back to Jewel.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Ballard found you on the train, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, grandpa. We had a nice time. He is a very kind man.” The child\r\nglanced across at her cousin again. She wished cousin Eloise would lift\r\nher eyes and not look so sorry. “I wonder,” she added aloud, “why Dr.\r\nBallard called cousin Eloise a little girl.”\r\n\r\nNo one spoke, so Mrs. Evringham broke the momentary silence. “Did he?”\r\n she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he said that my cousin Eloise was a very charming little girl.”\r\n\r\nJewel wondered why Eloise flushed and looked still sorrier, and why aunt\r\nMadge raised her napkin and turned her laugh into a cough. Perhaps it\r\nteased young ladies to be called little girls. Jewel regretted having\r\nmentioned it.\r\n\r\n“I guess he was just April-fooling me,” she suggested comfortingly, and\r\nthe insistence of her soft gaze was such that Eloise looked up and met a\r\nsmile so irresistible, that in spite of herself, her expression relaxed.\r\n\r\nThe softened look was a relief to the child. “I've heard about you, of\r\ncourse, cousin Eloise,” she said, “and I couldn't forget, because your\r\nname is so nice and--and slippery. Eloise Evringham. Eloise Evringham.\r\nIt sounds just like--like--oh, like sliding down the banisters. Don't\r\nyou think so?”\r\n\r\nEloise smiled a little. “I hadn't thought of it,” she returned, then\r\nrelapsed into quiet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes's countenance was stony. “Children should be seen and not\r\nheard,” was her doctrine, and this dressmaker's child had an assurance\r\nbeyond belief. She seemed to feel no awe whatever in her grandfather's\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper caught Jewel's eye and gave her such a quenching look\r\nthat thenceforward the little girl succumbed to the silence which the\r\nothers seemed to prefer.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner she would have a good visit with grandpa and talk about\r\nwhen father was a little boy. Her hopes were dashed, for just as they\r\nwere rising from the table, a man was announced, with whom Mr. Evringham\r\ncloseted himself in the library.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room aunt Madge and cousin Eloise both set themselves at\r\nletter-writing, and entirely ignored Jewel. The child looked listlessly\r\nat a book with pictures, which she found on the table, until half-past\r\neight, when Mrs. Forbes came to say it was time for her to go to bed.\r\n\r\nShe rose and stood a moment, turning hesitatingly from her aunt to her\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\n“Oh, is it bedtime?” asked aunt Madge, looking up from her letter.\r\n“Good-night, Julia. I hope you'll sleep well.” Then she returned to her\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nEloise bit her lip as she regarded the little girl with a moment's\r\nhesitation, but no, she had decided on her plan of action. Mrs. Forbes\r\nwas observing her. Eloise knew the housekeeper's attitude toward them\r\nwas defensive, if not offensive. “Good-night,” she said briefly, and\r\nlooked down again.\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” returned Jewel quietly, and went out.\r\n\r\nIn the hall she hesitated. “I want to say good-night to grandpa,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Well, you can't,” returned Mrs. Forbes decidedly. “He is talking\r\nbusiness and mustn't be disturbed.”\r\n\r\nShe followed the child up the staircase.\r\n\r\n“I could go to bed alone, if I only knew where the matches are.”\r\n\r\n“You said you could dress alone, but you had to ask Mrs. Evringham to\r\nbutton your frock. Remember after this that I am the one to ask. She and\r\nMiss Eloise don't want to be bothered.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a bother to do a kindness?” asked Jewel in a subdued tone.\r\n\r\n“To some folks it is,” was the response. They had reached the door of\r\nthe child's room; “but some folks can see their duty and do it,” she\r\nadded virtuously.\r\n\r\nJewel realized regretfully that her present companion belonged to the\r\nlatter class.\r\n\r\n“Now here, right inside the door,” proceeded Mrs. Forbes, “is the\r\nswitch. There's electricity all over this house, and you don't need\r\nany matches. See?” Mrs. Forbes turned the switch and the white room was\r\nflooded with light.\r\n\r\nA few hours ago this magic would have evoked much enthusiasm. Even now\r\nJewel was pleased to turn the light on and off several times, as Mrs.\r\nForbes told her to do.\r\n\r\n“Now I'll see if you can undress yourself,” said the housekeeper.\r\nJewel's deft fingers flew over the buttons in her eagerness to prove her\r\nindependence. When at last she stood in her little white nightgown, so\r\nneat and fine in its small decorations, Mrs. Forbes said, “Do you want\r\nme to hear you say your prayers?”\r\n\r\n“No, I thank you.” With her hasty response Jewel promptly jumped into\r\nthe bed, from which the white spread had been removed.\r\n\r\n“I hope you always say them,” said Mrs. Forbes, regarding her\r\nundecidedly.\r\n\r\n“Yes'm, I always do.”\r\n\r\nThe child cuddled down under the covers with her face to the wall, lest\r\nMrs. Forbes should see a further duty and do it.\r\n\r\n“You ought to say them on your knees,” continued the housekeeper.\r\n\r\n“I'd just as lief,” replied Jewel, “but I don't believe God cares.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” returned Mrs. Forbes solemnly, “it is a matter for your own\r\nconscience, Julia, if your mother didn't train you to it. Good-night.”\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” came faintly from beneath the bedclothes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes turned off the light and went out, closing the door behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“If she'd always speak when she's spoken to, and be quiet and modest as\r\nshe is with me, she'd be a very well-behaved child,” she soliloquized.\r\n“I could train her. I shouldn't wonder at all if her mother should see a\r\ngreat difference in her when she comes back.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper went heavily downstairs. Jewel, pushing off the\r\nbedclothes, listened attentively to the retiring steps, and when they\r\ncould no longer be heard, she jumped out of bed nimbly, and feeling for\r\nthe electric switch, turned on the light. Her breath was coming rather\r\nunevenly, and she ran over the soft carpet to where her doll lay.\r\nCatching her up, she pressed her to her breast, then sitting down in the\r\nbig chair, she began to undress her, crossing one little bare foot over\r\nthe other knee to make a lap.\r\n\r\n“Darling Anna Belle, did you think I'd forgotten you?” she asked\r\nbreathlessly. “Did you think you weren't going to have any one to\r\nkiss you good-night? It's hard not to have any one you love kiss you\r\ngood-night.” Jewel dashed her hand across her eyes quickly, then went\r\nswiftly on with her work. “You might have known that I was only waiting\r\nuntil that--that giantess went away. She wouldn't let me bring you down\r\nto dinner, dearie, but you didn't miss anything. Poor grandpa, I don't\r\nwonder any longer that he doesn't look happy. He has the sorriest people\r\nall around him that you ever saw. He lives in a big, beautiful castle,\r\nbut it's Castle Discord. I named it that at dinner. Nobody loves\r\none another. Of course grandpa loves me, because I'm his own little\r\ngrandchild, but he's too sorry to show it. The beautiful enchanted\r\nmaiden, and the Error fairy, and the giantess, are all making discord\r\naround him. A little flat is better than a big castle, isn't it? We know\r\na flat--let's call it Harmony Flat, Anna Belle. Perhaps if we're very,\r\n_very_, good, we'll get back there some time.” Jewel suddenly pressed\r\nthe doll's nightdress against her wet eyes. “Don't, don't, dearie! I\r\nknow it does seem a year since--since the boat this morning. If all the\r\ndays were as long as this, we'd be very, very old when father and mother\r\ncome home.” The soft voice broke in a sob. “I don't know what I should\r\ndo if you weren't a Christian Scientist, Anna Belle. We'll help each\r\nother all we can. Now come--come into bed and say your prayers.”\r\n\r\n“Say your--your prayer first, dearie,” she whispered, sobbing:--\r\n\r\n     “'Father, Mother, God,\r\n     Loving me,--\r\n     Guard me when I sleep;\r\n     Guide my little feet\r\n     Up to Thee.'\r\n\r\n“Now you'll feel--better, dearie. In a minute you won't be so--homesick\r\nfor--for--father and mother. Hush, while I say mine.”\r\n\r\nJewel repeated the Lord's Prayer. When she had finished, her breath\r\nstill caught convulsively, so she continued:--\r\n\r\n“Dear Father, Mother, God, loving me, help me to know that I am close\r\nto Thee. Help me to remember that things that are unhappy aren't real\r\nthings. Help me to know that everything is good and harmonious, and that\r\nthe people in this castle are Thy children, even if they do seem to have\r\neyes like fishes. Help me to love one another, even the giantess, and\r\nplease show grandpa how to meet error. Please let Dr. Ballard come to\r\nsee me soon, because he has kind eyes, and I'm sure he doesn't know it's\r\nwrong to believe in materia medica. Please take more care of father and\r\nmother than anything, and say 'Peace be still' if the wind blows the\r\nsea. I know, dear Father in Heaven, that Thou dost not forget anything,\r\nbut I say it to make me feel better. I am Thy little Jewel, and Anna\r\nBelle loves Thee, too. Take us into the everlasting arms of Love while\r\nwe go to sleep. Amen.”\r\n\r\nJewel brushed away the tears as she ceased, and with her usual quickness\r\nof motion, jumped out of bed to get a handkerchief. Turning on the\r\nelectric light, she went to the chair over which hung the dotted dress.\r\nShe remembered having slipped a clean handkerchief into its pocket\r\nbefore going to dinner.\r\n\r\nIn reaching for it her fingers encountered a scrap of paper in the\r\ndepths of the pocket. She drew it forth. It was folded. She opened it\r\nand found it written over in a clear round hand.\r\n\r\n“Is my little darling loving every one around her? People do not always\r\nseem lovely at first, but remember that every one is lovable because he\r\nis a thought of God. Those who seem unlovely are always unhappy, too,\r\nin their hearts. We must help them, and the best way to help is to love.\r\nMother is thinking about her little Jewel, and no seas can divide us.”\r\n\r\nA slow smile gladdened the child's tear-stained face. She read the\r\nmessage again, then turned out the light for the last time and cuddled\r\ndown in bed, her warm cheek pressing the scrap of paper in her hand, her\r\nbreath still catching.\r\n\r\n“Mother has spoken to us, Anna Belle,” she whispered, clasping the\r\ndoll close. “Wasn't it just like God to let her!” Then she fell asleep\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA HAPPY BREAKFAST\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes was on the porch next morning when Mr. Evringham returned\r\nfrom his canter.\r\n\r\n“Fine morning, Mrs. Forbes,” he said, as he gave Essex Maid into Zeke's\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“Very fine. A regular weather breeder. It'll most probably rain\r\nto-morrow, and what I wanted to speak to you about, Mr. Evringham, is,\r\nthat the child hasn't any rubbers.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? What else does she need?”\r\n\r\n“Well, nothing that I can see. Her things are all good, and she's got\r\nenough of them. The trouble is she says she has never worn rubbers and\r\ndoesn't want to, and if she gets sick I shall have to take care of her;\r\nso I hope, sir, you'll say that she must have them.”\r\n\r\n“Not wear them? Of course she must wear them,” returned Mr. Evringham\r\nbrusquely. “Get them to-day, if convenient, Mrs. Forbes.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper looked relieved.\r\n\r\n“I hope she's not making you any trouble, eh?” added Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“Not any more than she can help, I suppose,” was the grudging reply.\r\n“She's a smart child, and being an only one, she's some notional. She\r\nwon't eat this and that, and doesn't want to wear rubbers, but she's\r\nhandy and neat, and is used to doing for herself; her mother hasn't had\r\ntime to fuss with her, of course, and that's lucky for me. She seems\r\nvery well behaved, considering.”\r\n\r\nJewel had made heroic efforts while Mrs. Forbes assisted at her morning\r\ntoilet, and this was her reward.\r\n\r\n“Well, we mustn't have you imposed upon,” returned Mr. Evringham,\r\nfeeling guilty of the situation. “The child must obey you implicitly,\r\nimplicitly.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he passed into the house, and after making a change in his\r\ntoilet, entered the dining-room. There he was seated, deep in his\r\nnewspaper and waiting for his coffee, when the door opened, light feet\r\nran to him, and an arm was thrown around his neck. He looked up to meet\r\na happy smile, and before he could realize who had captured him, Jewel\r\npressed a fervent kiss upon his cheek.\r\n\r\n“Oh, grandpa, how nice and cold your cheek feels! Have you been out\r\ndoors already?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham could feel the said cheek grow hot in surprise at this\r\nonslaught. He held himself stiffly and uncomfortably in the encircling\r\narm.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I've been out on horseback,” he returned shortly. “I go every\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\nJewel's eyes sparkled. “Oh, I'm so glad. Then I can watch you. I love to\r\nsee anybody ride. When I see a beautiful horse something inside me gets\r\nwarm. Father says I like just the same things he does. I must let you\r\nread your paper, grandpa, but may I say one thing more?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I didn't come last evening to kiss you good-night because you had\r\nsomebody with you in the library, and, the giant--and Mrs. Forbes\r\nwouldn't let me; but I wanted to. You know I wanted to, don't you? I\r\nfelt all sorry inside because I couldn't. You know you're the only real\r\nrelation I have in the castle”--Here Mrs. Forbes's entrance with the\r\ncoffee interrupted the confidence, and Jewel, with a last surreptitious\r\nsqueeze of Mr. Evringham's neck, intended to finish her sentence\r\neloquently, left him and went to her chair.\r\n\r\n“You're to sit here this morning,” said Mrs. Forbes, indicating the\r\nplace opposite her employer. “Mrs. Evringham and her daughter don't come\r\ndown to breakfast.”\r\n\r\nJewel looked up eagerly. “Not ever?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\nThe child shot a radiant glance across at her grandfather which he\r\ncaught, the thread of his business calculations having been hopelessly\r\nbroken. “Oh, grandpa, we're always going to have breakfast alone\r\ntogether!” she said joyously. Noting Mrs. Forbes's set countenance, she\r\nadded apologetically, “They're so pretty, cousin Eloise and aunt Madge,\r\nI love to look at them, but they aren't my real relations, and,” her\r\nface gladdening again, “to think of having breakfast alone with you,\r\ngrandpa, makes me feel as if--as if I had a birthday!”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham cleared his throat. The situation might have been a little\r\neasier if Mrs. Forbes had not been present, but as it was, he had never\r\nfelt so embarrassed in his life.\r\n\r\n“Now eat your oatmeal, Julia,” said the housekeeper repressively. “Mr.\r\nEvringham always reads his paper at breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the child with docility. She poured the cream from a\r\nsmall silver pitcher with a neatness that won Mrs. Forbes's approval;\r\nand Mr. Evringham read over headlines in the paper, while he sipped his\r\ncoffee, without understanding in the least the meaning of the words.\r\nMrs. Forbes was right. Discipline must be maintained. This was the time\r\nduring which he wished to read his paper, and it was most astonishing to\r\nbe so vigorously taken possession of by an utter stranger. Now was the\r\ntime to repress her if she were to be repressed. Mrs. Forbes was right.\r\nAfter a while he glanced across at the child. She looked very small\r\nand clean, and she was ready with a quick smile for him; but she put a\r\nlittle forefinger against her lips jocosely. He cleared his throat again\r\nand averted his eyes, rumpling the paper as he turned a leaf.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes left the room with the oatmeal dishes.\r\n\r\nJewel leaned forward quickly. “Grandpa,” she said earnestly, “if you\r\nwould declare every day, over and over, that no error could come near\r\nyour house, I think she would go away of her own accord.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham stared, open paper in hand. “What? Who?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Forbes.”\r\n\r\n“Go away? Mrs. Forbes? What are you thinking of! I couldn't get on\r\nwithout Mrs. Forbes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Jewel leaned back with the long-drawn exclamation. “I thought she\r\nwas what made you look sorry.”\r\n\r\n“No indeed. I have enough things to make me sorry, but she isn't one of\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Do you like her?” wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“I--why--I respect her profoundly.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! It must be lots easier to respect her pro--the way you do, than to\r\nlike her; but,” with firm lips, “I've got to love her. I told Anna Belle\r\nso this morning, and especially if you want her to stay.”\r\n\r\n“Bless my soul!” Mr. Evringham looked in dismay as his _vis-à-vis_. “You\r\nmust be very careful, Julia, not to offend or trouble her in any way,”\r\n he said.\r\n\r\n“All right, grandpa, I will, and then will you do me a favor too?”\r\n\r\n“I must hear it first.”\r\n\r\n“Would you mind calling me Jewel? You know it isn't any matter about the\r\nrest, because they're not my real relations, but Julia is mother's name,\r\nand Jewel is mine; and when I love people very much, I like them to call\r\nme Jewel.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes here entered with a tray, and Mr. Evringham merely said,\r\n“Very well,” twice over, and retreated into his newspaper.\r\n\r\nOn the tray were boiled eggs. Jewel glanced quickly up at Mrs. Forbes's\r\nimpassive face. She might have remembered. Probably she did remember.\r\n\r\nLife had not taught the child to be shy, as has been evidenced; so\r\nalthough Mrs. Forbes was an awing experience, she felt strong in the\r\npresence of her important grandfather, and only kept silence now in\r\norder not to interrupt his reading.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he laid down his paper and began to chip an egg, Jewel\r\nglanced at those which Mrs. Forbes had set before her. Her little face\r\nhad grown very serious.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa, do you think it's error for me not to like eggs?” she asked.\r\n“Mother never said it was. She was willing I should eat something else.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, eat whatever you like,” responded Mr. Evringham quickly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes seemed to swell and grow pink. “You always have eggs, sir,\r\nand if there's two breakfasts to be got, will you kindly tell me what\r\nthe other shall be?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham glanced up in some surprise at the unfamiliar tone.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the oatmeal is a plenty,” said Jewel, looking at the housekeeper,\r\neager to mollify her.\r\n\r\n“Try an egg. Perhaps you'll like them by this time,” suggested Mr.\r\nEvringham.\r\n\r\n“Do you like everything to eat, grandpa?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham, being most arbitrary and peculiar in his tastes, could\r\nonly gain time by clearing his throat again, and taking a drink of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Forbes will bring you a glass of milk, I dare say,” he returned\r\nat last, without looking up; and the housekeeper turned with ponderous\r\nobedience and left the room.\r\n\r\nNimbly Jewel slid down from her chair, and running around the table to\r\nher grandfather's place, put both her arms around his neck and whispered\r\nto him eagerly and swiftly, “If you have such a pro--something respect\r\nfor Mrs. Forbes, and it makes her sorry because I won't eat eggs,\r\nperhaps I ought to. If it offends thy brother to have you eat meat, you\r\nmustn't, the Bible says, so I suppose, if it makes Mrs. Forbes turn red\r\nand perhaps get the stomach ache to have me not eat eggs, I ought to;\r\nbut grandpa, if you decide I must, please let me wait till to-morrow\r\nmorning, so I can say the Scientific Statement of Being all day--”\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Forbes entered with a glass of milk on a little tray. She\r\nstood transfixed at the sight that met her.\r\n\r\n“That child hasn't the fear of man before her eyes!” she ejaculated\r\nmentally, then she marched forward and deposited the milk beside Jewel's\r\nempty plate, while the child ran back and took her seat.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham, gazing at his visitor in mute astonishment, was much\r\ndisconcerted to receive a confiding gesture of raised shoulders and\r\neyebrows, which, combined with a little smile, plainly signified that\r\nthey had been caught. He took up his newspaper mechanically.\r\n\r\nHe had never had a daughter, and caresses had seldom passed between\r\nhim and his children. His duties as a family man had always been\r\nperfunctory. He was tingling now from the surprise of Jewel's action,\r\nthe feeling of the little gingham clad arms about his neck, the touch\r\nof the rose-leaf skin as she swept his cheek and ear in her emphatic\r\nhalf-whisper.\r\n\r\nHis mental processes were stiff when the subject related to things\r\napart from the stock market, his horses, and golf, but he was finally\r\nunderstanding that his granddaughter had come to Bel-Air, prepared by\r\naccounts which had cast a glamour over everything and everybody in it.\r\nShe had evidently found Mrs. Forbes fall below her expectations. He had\r\nbeen disillusioned concerning Mrs. Evringham and Eloise. As yet the halo\r\nwith which he himself had been invested was intact. Was it to remain\r\nso? He still saw how foolish he had been to send for the child. He\r\nstill wished, of course, that she was in Chicago now, instead of sitting\r\nacross there from him in crisp short skirts, her head and shoulders only\r\nshowing above the high table, and a little smile of good understanding\r\nwaiting for him each time he looked up.\r\n\r\nHe had done very well during a lifetime without being hugged, yet the\r\ninnocent incense, which had been rising spontaneously before him ever\r\nsince the child entered the dining-room, had a strangely sweet savor.\r\nSuch was the joy of breakfast alone with him that it made her feel as if\r\nshe had a birthday! Perfectly absurd! Quite the most absurd thing that\r\nhe had ever heard in his life.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes spoke. “Perhaps it is to be the same way about the rubbers,\r\nMr. Evringham!” she said, much flushed. “Perhaps you will not insist\r\nupon Julia wearing rubbers!”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, yes, certainly,” returned Mr. Evringham hastily, anxious\r\nto reinstate himself. “I wish you to have a pair of rubbers at once,\r\nJulia--Jewel. You surely don't mean that your mother has allowed you to\r\nwet your feet.”\r\n\r\n“I--I never noticed, grandpa, but,” hopefully, “she lets me wet my\r\nhands, so why not my feet?”\r\n\r\n“Bless me, what ignorance! Because the soles of your feet have large\r\npores through which to catch cold. Hasn't any one ever told you that?”\r\n\r\nJewel smiled. “That would be a queer arrangement for God to make, don't\r\nyou think?” she asked softly. “Just as if He expected us to walk on our\r\nhands.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes's eyes widened, and an irrepressible “Well!” escaped from\r\nher lips. “Has that young one reverence for anything in heaven above or\r\nearth beneath?” she queried mentally.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham managed to recover himself sufficiently to say, “You\r\nshouldn't speak so, Jewel.”\r\n\r\n“But you know how it was about the tree of knowledge, grandpa,” replied\r\nthe child earnestly. “God told Adam not to eat of it, because then he'd\r\nbelieve in good _and_ evil, and that always makes such lots and _lots_\r\nof trouble. The Indians don't have to wear rubbers.”\r\n\r\n“Drink your milk, Jewel,” returned Mr. Evringham uncomfortably, not\r\nhaving the temerity to lift his eyes as high as his housekeeper's\r\ncountenance. “No matter about the Indians. You are a civilized little\r\ngirl, and you must wear rubbers while you live with me. Mrs. Forbes will\r\nvery kindly buy them for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have money,” returned Jewel brightly. “I have three dollars,”\r\n she added, trying not to say it boastfully. “Fifty cents for every week\r\nfather and mother are going to be away.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham wiped his mustache. “You need not spend any of it for the\r\nrubbers,” he returned. “You are buying those to please me.”\r\n\r\n“I shall love to wear them to please you, grandpa,” she returned\r\naffectionately. “I'll put them on every time I can think of it.”\r\n\r\n“Only when it is wet, of course,” he said. “When it is rainy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” she returned, “when it's rainy.”\r\n\r\n“Harry looked like my father, and she does, by Jove,” mused Mr.\r\nEvringham. “She's like me. Knows what she wants to eat, and cares for a\r\nhorse, if she is a strange little being.”\r\n\r\n“You say you like horses?” he remarked suddenly.\r\n\r\n“I just love them,” answered Jewel, “and I came real close to them once.\r\nFather took me to the horse show.”\r\n\r\n“He did, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he told mother he was going to blow me to it.” The child laughed.\r\n“Father's the greatest joker; he says the funniest things. He didn't\r\nblow me to it at all. He took me in the cable car, and we had more\r\n_fun_! It was the most be--eautiful place you ever saw.”\r\n\r\n“It was, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The music was playing, and there were coaches and four-in-hands\r\nand horns and men in red coats and beautiful little shiny carriages--and\r\nthe horses! Oh, they all looked so proud and glad, and they trotted and\r\nran and jumped over high fences, and the harness jingled and the people\r\ncheered!” The child's cheeks were glowing.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham gave an exclamation that was almost a laugh. “You didn't\r\nsleep much that night, I'll wager!”\r\n\r\n“No, I didn't want to. I stayed awake a long time to realize that God\r\ndoesn't love one of His children any better than another, so of course\r\nsome time I'll wear a tall shiny hat and ride over fences just like\r\nflying. I'll have a horse,” Jewel added slowly, looking off with a rapt\r\nexpression as at a long-cherished vision, “with a white star in his\r\nforehead!”\r\n\r\n“H'm! Very good taste,” returned Mr. Evringham, scarcely knowing what he\r\nwas saying, so dazed was he by the extraordinary mixture of ideas.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he had his usual interview with Mrs. Forbes concerning\r\nthe important event of dinner. Jewel had run upstairs to dress Anna\r\nBelle.\r\n\r\nThe menu decided upon, Mr. Evringham still lingered.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Forbes, I have never had any experience with little girls. You\r\nhave, no doubt,” he said. “Am I right in thinking that my granddaughter\r\nis--is a rather unusual specimen?”\r\n\r\n“She's older than Dick's hatband, sir,” rejoined the housekeeper\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n“Are they, perhaps, teaching differently in the schools from what they\r\nused to?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I know of, Mr. Evringham.”\r\n\r\n“She uses very unusual expressions. I can't make it out. You are an\r\nintelligent woman, Mrs. Forbes. Did you ever happen to hear of such a\r\nthing as the--a--a--Scientific Statement of Being!”\r\n\r\n“Never in my life, sir,” returned the housekeeper virtuously.\r\n\r\n“Extraordinary language that, from a--a child of her years. She seems\r\nto have been peculiarly brought up. You heard her reference to--in fact\r\nto--the Creator.”\r\n\r\n“I did, sir. At the breakfast table, too! I was as shocked as you were,\r\nsir. Her mother put a Bible into her trunk, but it's plain she never\r\ntaught her any reverence. The Almighty give her a jumping horse indeed!\r\nIf you'll excuse me, Mr. Evringham, I think you should have said\r\nsomething right there.”\r\n\r\nThe broker pulled his mustache. “I've listened to more unreasonable\r\nviews of heaven,” he returned.\r\n\r\n“Do you think it was heaven she was talking about!”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham shrugged his shoulders. “You can't prove anything by me.\r\nShe's the most extraordinary child I ever listened to.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes pursed her lips. “You'd not believe, sir, how differently\r\nshe behaves when she is alone with me. As mild-mannered and quiet as\r\nyou'd wish to see anywhere. She scarcely speaks a word.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham bit his lip and nodded. It gave him some amusement in\r\nthe midst of his perplexity to remember the manner in which he had been\r\nadvised to exorcise this tower of strength altogether.\r\n\r\n“It's my opinion, sir, that children should be made to eat what is set\r\nbefore them,” went on Mrs. Forbes, reverting to her principal grievance.\r\n\r\n“It would save you a lot of trouble if I had been trained that way--eh,\r\nMrs. Forbes?” returned the other, with extraordinary lightness.\r\n\r\n“You are a very different thing, I should hope!” exclaimed Mrs. Forbes\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, about fifty years different. Hard to teach an old dog new tricks,\r\neh? You might have some chops for her luncheon, perhaps, and an extra\r\none for her breakfast. She hasn't eaten anything this morning.”\r\n\r\nFor the first time an order from Mr. Evringham evoked no reply from\r\nhis housekeeper. He felt the weight of her disapproval. “But get the\r\novershoes by all means, as soon as convenient,” he made haste to add.\r\n“Ring for Zeke, if you please, Mrs. Forbes. I must be off.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA SHOPPING EXPEDITION\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper warned Jewel not to run out of doors that morning as she\r\nwished to accompany her to the shoe store.\r\n\r\n“I'm not going to take you, Anna Belle,” Jewel said to her doll. “I\r\ndon't like to ask the giantess if I may, and of course, it won't be a\r\nvery good time anyway, so you be patient and we'll go out together this\r\nafternoon.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes's long widow's veil, a decoration she never had discarded\r\nhung low over her black gown as she stepped deliberately down the stairs\r\nfrom her barn chamber.\r\n\r\n“I am going with the little girl, Zeke, to buy her a pair of rubbers,”\r\n she announced to her son.\r\n\r\n“Going foot-back? Why don't you have out the 'broom'? One\r\ngranddaughter's got as good a right to it as the other, hasn't she?”\r\n\r\n“I should say so, but that child, Zeke, in addition to her wonderful\r\nboldness this morning with Mr. Evringham, that I told you about, is\r\nperfectly crazy over horses.”\r\n\r\n“H'm. That don't surprise me. A young one that can stand up to the\r\ngovernor wouldn't be afraid of anything in the way of horseflesh.”\r\n\r\n“So I decided,” continued Mrs. Forbes, pulling on her roomy black\r\ngloves, “that it would be better for her to go this morning in the\r\ntrolley.”\r\n\r\n“You _did_? Well if that ain't a regular step-mother act!” returned\r\nZeke in protest. “The kid had a bully time coming home from the depot\r\nyesterday. Dick felt good, and he just lit out. I tell you her eyes\r\nshone.”\r\n\r\n“I like to do what's best for folks in the end,” declared Mrs. Forbes\r\nvirtuously. “Julia's parents are poor, and likely to be. She's only\r\ngoing to be here six weeks, and what is the sense of encouraging a taste\r\nshe can't ever indulge? No, I'll take her in the trolley. It's a nice\r\nmorning, and I shan't mind the walk down to the gate.” The speaker\r\nmarched with the dignity which was always inseparable from the veil\r\ntoward the back door of the house to give some last orders, and Zeke\r\nlounged out with his rake toward the grounds at the front. There he\r\ncaught sight of a small figure in hat and jacket waiting on the piazza.\r\nHe turned toward it, and Jewel advanced with a smile of recognition.\r\nShe had had to look twice to identify her fine plum-colored companion of\r\nyesterday's drive with this youth in shirt sleeves and a soft old hat.\r\n\r\n“Well, little girl, how are you getting on?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Pretty well, thank you.” Her beaming expression left no doubt that she\r\nwas very glad to see him.\r\n\r\n“Not particularly flattering if she is,” he mused. “Fine ladies not out\r\nof their rooms yet, and ma doin' her duty by her to beat the band.”\r\n\r\n“Where's your doll?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I didn't bring her. I thought perhaps the--Mrs. Forbes would--would\r\njust as lief she didn't come.”\r\n\r\n“Ma _hasn't_ played with dolls for quite a spell,” agreed Zeke, with a\r\nsmile that was sunshine to the child.\r\n\r\n“You live out in the barn with the horses, don't you?” she asked\r\neagerly. “Will you give me permission to go out there some time?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. Come any time.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Forbes said I must ask permission,” responded the child with\r\nan apprehensive glance behind her to see if her escort were arriving.\r\n“What--what is your name?”\r\n\r\n“Forgotten this soon? I told you Zeke.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you did, but your mother said it was something very\r\ndifferent.”\r\n\r\n“Ezekiel, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that's it. I won't forget again. How many horses has grandpa?”\r\n\r\n“Two here, but I guess he's got more in the country. You come out to the\r\nbarn any time you feel like it. You've heard of a bell cow, haven't you?\r\nWell, we've got the belle horse out there. She beats all creation.”\r\n\r\n“The one I saw yesterday,” eagerly, “the one that runs away all the\r\ntime?”\r\n\r\n“No. This is Mr. Evringham's riding horse.”\r\n\r\nJewel hopped and clapped her hands. “I'll see grandpa ride. Goody! I'll\r\nwatch him.”\r\n\r\n“Go to your paths, Zeke,” said a voice, and the veil appeared around the\r\ncorner of the house.\r\n\r\nJewel quietly joined her stately companion, and walked away sedately\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nThey did not exchange many words on their way to the park gates, for\r\nMrs. Forbes needed her breath for the rather long promenade, and Jewel\r\nwas busy looking at the trees and trim swards and crocus beds beside the\r\nwinding road.\r\n\r\nOutside the gate they had to wait but a minute before the car came, and\r\nafter they had boarded it, the little girl was entertained by looking\r\nout of the window, and often wished for Anna Belle's sympathy in some\r\nnovel sight or sound.\r\n\r\nA ride of fifteen minutes brought them to the shoe store. Mrs. Forbes\r\nseemed to know the clerk, and Jewel was finally fitted to her guardian's\r\nsatisfaction, but scarcely to her own, the housekeeper having selected\r\nthe species known as storm rubbers, and chose them as large as would\r\nstay on.\r\n\r\n“They're quite warm, aren't they?” said Jewel, looking down at her shiny\r\nfeet and trying to speak cheerfully.\r\n\r\n“When you wear them you want to be warm,” was Mrs. Forbes's rejoinder.\r\n\r\n“I brought my money,” said the child, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“No. Your grandfather wishes to make you a present of these.” The\r\nhousekeeper's tone was final, and she paid for the overshoes, which were\r\nwrapped up, and then she led Jewel out of the store.\r\n\r\nNext door was a candy shop with alluring windows.\r\n\r\n“I'd like to go in here,” said the little girl. “Would you mind?”\r\n\r\n“Do you spend your money for candy, Julia?”\r\n\r\n“Yes'm. Don't you like it?” Jewel lingered, looking at the pretty\r\ndisplay. Easter had recently passed, and there were bright-eyed little\r\nyellow chickens that especially took her fancy.\r\n\r\n“It isn't a question of liking it when people are poor,” returned Mrs.\r\nForbes. “I'm astonished that your mother encourages you to spend money\r\nfor candy.”\r\n\r\nJewel looked up quickly. “Did you think we were poor?” she asked, with\r\ndisconcerting suddenness.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes hesitated. “Your mother is a dressmaker, isn't she?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she's just a splendid one. Everybody says so. We couldn't be poor,\r\nyou know. She found out about God before I was old enough to talk, so\r\nyou see all her poor time came before I can remember.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper glanced about her furtively. “Julia, don't you know you\r\nshouldn't use your Creator's name on the street!” she exclaimed, when\r\nshe had made certain that no one was listening.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” asked the child.\r\n\r\n“Why--why--it isn't a proper place. Some one might hear you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, won't you let me get some candy now? If I knew what kind you\r\nliked, Mrs. Forbes, I'd get it.”\r\n\r\n“I don't eat candy as a rule. It's not only extravagant, it's very\r\nunhealthy.”\r\n\r\nThe little girl smiled. “How do you suppose your stomach knows what you\r\nput into it?” she asked. “I guess you're just a little--bit--afraid,\r\naren't you?”\r\n\r\n“Odder than Dick's hatband!” quoth Mrs. Forbes again, mentally. “I take\r\nhorehound drops sometimes,” she said aloud, “for a cold.”\r\n\r\n“Can't you sneeze a little now?” asked Jewel, amusement twinkling in her\r\nblue eyes. “I do want so much to go in here.”\r\n\r\n“Don't tempt Providence by making fun of sickness, Julia, or you'll\r\nlive to regret it,” returned Mrs. Forbes. “I don't mind getting some\r\nhorehound drops, but be careful now and don't spend too much. A little\r\ngirl's money always burns in her pocket.”\r\n\r\n“Yes'm,” returned the child dutifully, skipping up to the door of the\r\nshop and opening it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes followed slowly, and once inside, fell into conversation\r\nwith the girl of whom she bought the cough candy. This gave Jewel\r\nopportunity to buy beside her caramels one of the lovely yellow\r\nchickens, which she designed for a special purpose.\r\n\r\n“Now don't you eat that candy before lunch. It will take away your\r\nappetite. It is nearly lunch time now,” said Mrs. Forbes as they left\r\nthe store.\r\n\r\n“And won't you either?” asked the child, offering the open caramel bag\r\nwith a spontaneous politeness which somehow made the housekeeper feel at\r\na disadvantage.\r\n\r\n“No, thank you. Stop that car, Julia, and make them wait for me,” she\r\nsaid, making haste slowly.\r\n\r\nOnce within, it took Mrs. Forbes a minute or two to get her breath, but\r\nshe soon noticed that her companion's eyes were fixed upon a man seated\r\na little way from them across the car. A smile kept coming to the\r\nchild's lips, and at last the gentleman himself recognized that he was\r\nan object of interest. He looked at the strange little girl kindly. Her\r\nhand went unconsciously to the small gold pin she wore. The man smiled\r\nand touched one of similar pattern which was fastening his tie. In a\r\nminute more his street was reached, and as he passed Jewel on his way\r\nout of the car, he stooped and gave her ready hand a little pressure.\r\n\r\nShe colored with pleasure, and Mrs. Forbes swelled with curiosity and\r\ndisapproval. She knew the man by sight as a highly respectable citizen.\r\nWhat was this wild Western child doing now? The car made too much noise\r\nto permit of investigation, so she waited until they had left it and\r\nentered the park gates.\r\n\r\n“Julia,” she said then, “where did you ever see that gentleman before?”\r\n\r\n“I never did,” replied the child.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by such bold actions, then? What will he think of\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“He'll think it's all right,” returned Jewel. “We have the same--the\r\nsame friends.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper looked at her. It was beneath her dignity to ask further\r\nquestions at present, but some time she meant to renew the subject.\r\n\r\n“It's very wrong for a little girl to take any notice of strangers,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Yes'm,” replied Jewel, “but he was--different.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes maintained silence henceforth until they reached home. “You\r\nmay hang your hat and jacket in the closet under the stairs whenever\r\nyou don't wish to go to your room,” she said when she parted with her\r\ncompanion at the piazza, “but don't wander away anywhere before lunch.”\r\n\r\n“No'm. Thank you for taking me, Mrs. Forbes.”\r\n\r\n“You're welcome,” returned that lady, and the long black veil swept\r\nmajestically toward the barn.\r\n\r\nSweet and rippling music was proceeding from the house. Jewel tiptoed\r\nacross the piazza to a long window, from whence she could see the\r\ninterior of the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n“It is the enchanted maiden,” she said to herself, and sank down softly\r\nby the window, listening eagerly to the melodious strains and smooth\r\nruns which flowed from beneath the slender fingers. One piece followed\r\nanother in quick succession, now gay, now grave, and the listener\r\nscarcely stirred in her enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAt last, suddenly, in the midst of a Grieg melody, the player ceased,\r\nand crossing her arms upon the empty music rack, bowed her head upon\r\nthem in such an attitude of abandon that Jewel's heart leaped in\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n“Oh cousin Eloise! What makes her so sorry?” she thought. The child's\r\nintuition had been strong to perceive the nature of her aunt Madge. “It\r\nmust be such an awful thing to have your own mother an error fairy. That\r\nmust be the reason. I wish I could tell her”--Jewel jumped to her feet,\r\nbut just as she was determining to go to her cousin, the soft-toned gong\r\npealed its mellow summons, and she saw Eloise rise from the piano in\r\ntime to meet her mother, who at that moment entered the room.\r\n\r\nJewel went into the house, hung up her hat and jacket, and deposited her\r\npackages. By the time she reached the dining-room her aunt and cousin\r\nwere already seated. Mrs. Evringham put up her lorgnette as she greeted\r\nthe child. Eloise nodded a grave good-morning, and Mrs. Forbes began to\r\nserve the luncheon.\r\n\r\nJewel looked in vain for any trace of excitement or tears on her\r\ncousin's lovely face. Eloise did not address her or any one. Mrs.\r\nEvringham did the talking. After a question as to how Jewel had spent\r\nthe morning, and without listening to the child's reply, she began to\r\ntalk to her daughter of a drive she wished to take that afternoon.\r\n\r\nJewel discerned that Mrs. Forbes was not kindly disposed toward the\r\nmother and daughter, and that they ignored the housekeeper; that Eloise\r\nwas languid and out of sympathy with her mother, and that Mrs. Evringham\r\nwas impatient with her, often to the verge of sharpness. The child was\r\nglad when luncheon was over; but before going upstairs she brought her\r\nsmall bag of caramels and offered them to the ladies.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham gave a little laugh of surprise and looked at Eloise, who\r\ntook one with a sober “Thank you.”\r\n\r\n“I don't believe I could, child,” said aunt Madge, glancing with\r\namusement at the striped bag. “Keep them for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“You'll have some, won't you, Mrs. Forbes?” asked Jewel, and the\r\nhousekeeper so strongly disapproved of Mrs. Evringham's manner that she\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you would like to try some of our candy, Julia,” said Mrs.\r\nEvringham, as the child followed her aunt and cousin upstairs.\r\n\r\nJewel paused while aunt Madge brought from her room into the hall a\r\nlarge box, beribboned and laced, full of a variety of confections.\r\n\r\n“How pretty!” exclaimed the child.\r\n\r\n“This is from your friend, Dr. Ballard,” said her aunt. “He sent it to\r\nthe charming little girl, Eloise.”\r\n\r\nJewel, running on up to her room eating the creamy chocolate, wondered\r\nstill more why her cousin should seem so sorry, with so much to make her\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n“Now, Anna Belle, the time has really come,” she said happily to her\r\ndoll, as she took her in her arms and began putting on her jacket and\r\nhat. “We're going away from Castle Discord to seek our fortunes. We're\r\ngoing to leave the giantess, and leave the impolite error fairy, and\r\nleave the poor enchanted maiden, and go to find the ravine and the\r\nbrook. Wait till I put on my oldest shoes, for we shall have to climb\r\ndeep, deep down to get near to father.”\r\n\r\nAt last she was ready, and when she had closed the heavy house door\r\nbehind her, and had run down the driveway to the park road, a delicious\r\nsense of freedom possessed her.\r\n\r\n“There goes the little Westerner,” observed Mrs. Evringham, looking from\r\nher window. “It's a good thing she knows how to amuse herself.”\r\n\r\n“A good thing, indeed,” returned Eloise. “There is no one here to do\r\nanything for her.”\r\n\r\n“She has wonderful assurance for such a plain little monkey,” went on\r\nMrs. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“She has extremely good breeding,” returned her daughter, coming to the\r\nwindow and following Jewel's retreating figure with her eyes, “and a\r\ncharming face when she smiles.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Look out for yourself, then. I thought last night, once or\r\ntwice, at dinner, that she was rather entertaining to her grandfather.”\r\n\r\n“She has her doll,” said Eloise wistfully. “Where can she be going? I\r\nwish I were going with her.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham laughed. “Well, you _are_ bored. Pshaw, my dear! Lie\r\ndown and get a little beauty sleep. Then we will go driving and see\r\nthat charming spot Dr. Ballard told us about. I'm sure he will call\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE RAVINE\r\n\r\nOutside the well-kept roads of Bel-Air Park, Nature had been encouraged\r\nto work her sweet will. The drive wound along the edge of a picturesque\r\ngorge, and it was not long before Jewel found the scene of her father's\r\nfavorite stories.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the ravine were studded with tall trees, and in its depths\r\nflowed a brook, unusually full now from the spring rains.\r\n\r\nThe child lost no time in creeping beneath the slender wire fence at\r\nthe roadside, and scrambling down the incline. The brook whispered and\r\ngurgled, wild flowers sprang amid the ferns in the shelter and moisture.\r\nThe child was enraptured.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Anna Belle!” She exclaimed, hugging the doll for pure joy. “Castle\r\nDiscord is far away. There's nobody down here but God!”\r\n\r\nFor hours she played happily in the enchanting spot, all unconscious\r\nof time. Anna Belle lay on a bed of moss, while Jewel became acquainted\r\nwith her wonderful new playmate, the brook. The only body of water with\r\nwhich she had been familiar hitherto was Lake Michigan. Now she drew\r\nstones out of the bank and made dams and waterfalls. She sailed boats of\r\nchips and watched them shoot the tiny rapids. She lay down on the bank\r\nbeside Anna Belle and gazed up through the leafy treetops. Many times\r\nthis programme had been varied, when at last equipages began to pass on\r\nthe road above. She could see twinkling wheels and smart liveries.\r\n\r\nWith a start of recollection, she considered that she might have been a\r\nlong time in the ravine.\r\n\r\n“I wish somebody would let me bring a watch the next time,” she said\r\nto her doll, as she took her up. “Haven't we had a beautiful afternoon,\r\nAnna Belle? Let's call it the Ravine of Happiness, and we'll come here\r\nevery day--just every day; but perhaps it's time for grandpa to be home,\r\ndearie, so we must go back to the castle.” She sighed unconsciously as\r\nshe began climbing up the steep bank and crept under the wire. “I hope\r\nwe haven't stayed very long, because the giantess might not like it,”\r\n she continued uneasily; but as she set her feet in the homeward road,\r\nevery sensation of anxiety fled before an approaching vision. She saw\r\na handsome man in riding dress mounted on a shining horse with arched\r\nneck, that lifted its feet daintily as it pranced along the tree-lined\r\navenue.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa!” ejaculated Jewel, stepping to the roadside and pausing, her\r\nhands clasped beneath her chin and her eyes shining with admiration.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham drew rein, not displeased by the encounter. The child\r\napparently could not speak. She eyed the horse rather than its rider, a\r\nfact which the latter observed and enjoyed.\r\n\r\n“Remind you of the horse show?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“It _is_ the horse show,” rejoined the child.\r\n\r\n“This is Essex Maid, Jewel,” said Mr. Evringham. He patted the mare's\r\nshining neck. “You shall go out to the barn with me some time and visit\r\nher.” His eyes wandered over the ruffled hair, the hat on the back of\r\nthe child's head, and the wet spots on her dress. “Run home now,” he\r\nadded. “I heard Mrs. Forbes asking for you as I came out.”\r\n\r\nHe rode on, and Jewel, her face radiant, followed him with her eyes. In\r\na minute he turned, and she threw rapid kisses after him. He raised his\r\nhat, and then a curve in the road hid him from view.\r\n\r\nJewel sighed rapturously and hurried along the road. The giantess had\r\nasked for her. Ah, what a happy world it would be if there were nothing\r\nat Bel-Air Park but grandpa, his horses, and the ravine!\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes espied the child in the distance, and was at the door when\r\nshe came in.\r\n\r\n“After this, Julia, you must never go away without telling me\r\nwhere”--she began, when her eyes recognized the condition of the gingham\r\nfrock, and the child's feet. “Look at how you've drabbled your dress!”\r\n she ejaculated.\r\n\r\n“It's clean water,” returned Julia.\r\n\r\n“But your feet! Why, Julia Evringham, they are as wet as sop! Where have\r\nyou been?”\r\n\r\n“Playing by the brook in the ravine.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes groaned. “Nothing will satisfy a child but finding the place\r\nwhere they can get the dirtiest and make the most trouble. Why didn't\r\nyou wear your rubbers, you naughty girl?”\r\n\r\n“Why--why--it wasn't raining.”\r\n\r\n“Raining! Those rubbers are to keep your feet dry. Haven't you got any\r\nsense?”\r\n\r\nJewel looked a little pale. “I didn't know I should get wet in the\r\nbrook,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Well, go right upstairs now, up the backstairs, and take off every one\r\nof those wet things. Let me feel your petticoat. Yes, that's wet, too.\r\nYou undress and get into a hot bath, and then you put on your nightgown\r\nand go right to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Go to bed!” echoed the child, bewildered.\r\n\r\n“Yes, to bed. You won't come down to dinner. Perhaps that will teach you\r\nto wear your rubbers next time and be more careful.”\r\n\r\nJewel found the backstairs and ascended them, her little heart hot\r\nwithin her.\r\n\r\n“She's the impolitest woman in the whole world, Anna Belle!” she\r\nwhispered. “I'm going to not cry. Mother didn't know what impoliteness\r\nthere was at grandpa's or she wouldn't have let us come.”\r\n\r\nThe child's eyes were bright as she found her room and began undressing.\r\n“But you mustn't be angry, dearie,” she continued excitedly to her doll.\r\n“It's the worst error to be angry, because it means hating. You treat\r\nme, Anna Belle, and I'll treat you,” she went on, unfastening her\r\nclothes with unsteady hands.\r\n\r\nWith many a pause to work at a refractory elastic or button, and many\r\ninterruptions from catches in her breath, she murmured aloud during the\r\nprocess of her undressing: “Dear Father in Heaven, I seem to feel sorry\r\nall over, and full of error. Help me to know that I'm not a mortal mind\r\nlittle girl, hating and angry, but I am Thy child, and the only things I\r\nknow are good, happy things. Error has no power and Love has all power.\r\nI love Mrs. Forbes, and she loves me. Thou art here even in this\r\nhouse, and please help me to know that one of Thy children cannot hurt\r\nanother.” Here Jewel slipped into the new wrapper her mother had made,\r\nand hurried into the white tiled bathroom near by. While she let the\r\nwater run into the tub she put her hand into her pocket mechanically, in\r\nsearch of a handkerchief, and when she felt the crisp touch of paper she\r\ndrew it out eagerly. It was covered, and she read the words written in\r\nher mother's distinct hand.\r\n\r\n“Love to my Jewel. Is she making a stepping-stone of every trial, and\r\nlearning to think less and less about herself, and more and more about\r\nother people? And does she remember that little girls cannot always\r\nunderstand the error that grown-up people have to meet, especially those\r\nwho have not Science to help them? They must be treated very gently, and\r\nI hope my little Jewel will be always kind and patient, and make her new\r\nfriends glad she is there.”\r\n\r\nThe child folded the paper and put it carefully back in her pocket.\r\nThen she took her bath, and returning to her room undressed her doll in\r\nsilence. Finally, changing her wrapper for her nightdress, she climbed\r\ninto bed, where she lay thinking and looking at the sunlight on the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nAt dinner time the maid Sarah appeared with a tray. “Here's your dinner,\r\nMiss Julia,” she said, looking at the heavy-eyed little girl. “It's too\r\nbad you're not well.”\r\n\r\n“I am well, thank you,” replied Jewel. “I'm sorry you had to carry that\r\nheavy tray up so many stairs.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don't mind that,” returned the girl good-naturedly. “I'll set it\r\nright here by the bed.”\r\n\r\n“Is grandpa down there?” asked Jewel wistfully.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Miss Julia. They're all eating their dinner. I hope you'll enjoy\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\nSarah went away, and the little girl spread some bread and butter and\r\nate it slowly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, when the family had gathered at the dinner table, Mr.\r\nEvringham looked up at his housekeeper.\r\n\r\n“Where is Jewel?” he asked shortly. “I object to her being unpunctual.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. She is having dinner in her room. She was very naughty and\r\ngot wet in the brook.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed!” Mr. Evringham frowned and looked down. He had been a\r\nlittle disappointed that the bright face was not watching to see him\r\ncome home from his ride, but of course discipline must be maintained.\r\n“I'm sorry to hear this,” he added.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham and Eloise found him a shade less taciturn than usual\r\nto-night. He felt vaguely that he now had an ally of his own flesh and\r\nblood in the house, a spirit sufficiently kindred to prefer his society\r\nto theirs, and this made him unusually lenient.\r\n\r\nHe meant to go upstairs after dinner, and warn Jewel to be more careful\r\nin future to conform to all Mrs. Forbes's rules; but the meal was\r\nscarcely over when a friend called to get him to attend some business\r\nmeeting held that evening in the interests of the town, and he became\r\ninterested in his statements and went away with him.\r\n\r\n“Wasn't father quite agreeable this evening?” asked Mrs. Evringham of\r\nEloise. “What did I tell you? I could see that he felt relief because\r\nthat plain little creature was not in evidence. Father always was so\r\nfastidious. Of course it is selfish in a way, but it is no use to blame\r\nmen for caring for beauty. They will do it.”\r\n\r\n“It was a shame to make that little girl stay upstairs,” returned\r\nEloise. “I judge she managed to amuse herself this afternoon, and so she\r\ngets punished for it. I should like to go up and sit with her.”\r\n\r\n“It would not be worth while,” returned Mrs. Evringham quickly. “I'm\r\nsure Dr. Ballard will be here soon. You would have to come right down\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“That is not the reason I don't go,” returned the girl. “It is because\r\nI am not an Evringham, and I have determined not to arrive at friendly\r\nrelations with any one of the name. When I once escape from here, they\r\nwill have seen the last of me.”\r\n\r\n“The way of escape lies open,” returned her mother soothingly. “I'm glad\r\nyou have on that gown. If a man cares for a woman, he always loves to\r\nsee her in white.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as dinner was over, Mrs. Forbes ascended the stairs to see\r\nher prisoner. Jewel was lying quietly in bed, the tray, apparently\r\nuntouched, beside her. The latter circumstance Mrs. Forbes observed at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Why haven't you eaten your dinner, Julia?” she asked. “I hope you are\r\nnot sulking.”\r\n\r\n“No'm. I don't believe I am. I don't know what that means.”\r\n\r\n“You don't know what sulky means?” suspiciously. “It is very naughty for\r\na little girl to refuse to eat her dinner because she is angry at being\r\npunished for her own good.”\r\n\r\n“Did you send me to bed because you loved me?” asked Jewel. Her cheeks\r\nwere very red, but even the disconcerted housekeeper could see that she\r\nwas not excited or angry.\r\n\r\n“Everybody loves good little girls,” returned Mrs. Forbes. “Now eat your\r\ndinner, Julia, so I can carry down the tray.”\r\n\r\n“I did eat the bread. It was all I wanted. It was very nice.”\r\n\r\nThe polite addition made the housekeeper uncertain. While she paused\r\nJewel added, “I wish I could see grandpa.”\r\n\r\n“He's gone out on business. He won't be back until after you are asleep.\r\nAnd if you were thinking of complaining to him, Julia, I tell you it\r\nwon't do any good. He will trust everything to me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I would trouble grandpa?” returned the child.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper looked at her in silent perplexity. The blue eyes were\r\ndirect and innocent, but there was a heaviness about them that stirred\r\nMrs. Forbes uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n“You must have got too tired playing this afternoon, Julia,” she said\r\ndecisively, “or you would be hungry for your dinner. You took that hot\r\nbath I told you to?”\r\n\r\n“Yes'm.”\r\n\r\n“Where have you put your wet things? Oh, I see, you've spread them out\r\nvery nicely; but those shoes--I shall have to have them cleaned and\r\npolished for you. Now go to sleep as quick as you can and have a\r\nlong night's rest. I'm sure the next time you go out you won't be so\r\ncareless.”\r\n\r\nJewel's eyes followed the speaker as she bustled about and at last took\r\nup the tray.\r\n\r\n“Will you kiss me good-night, Mrs. Forbes?” asked the child.\r\n\r\nThe surprised housekeeper set down her burden, stooped over the bed and\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\n“There now, I see you're sorry,” she said, somewhat touched.\r\n\r\nJewel gave her a little smile. “No'm, I've stopped being sorry,” she\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“She'd puzzle a Philadelphia lawyer,” soliloquized the housekeeper\r\nas she descended the stairs with the tray. “I suppose her mother is\r\nuneducated and uses queer English. As the old ones croak, the young ones\r\nlearn. The child uses words nobody ever heard of, and is ignorant of the\r\ncommonest ones. I'm glad she's so fond of me if I've got to take care of\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDR. BALLARD\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham looked about, half in apprehension, half in anticipation,\r\nas he entered the dining-room the following morning. Jewel had not\r\narrived, so he settled himself to read his paper. Each time there was\r\na sound he glanced up, bracing himself for the approach of light feet,\r\nbeaming face, and an ardent embrace. His interest in the news gradually\r\nlessened, and his expectancy increased. She did not come. At last he\r\nbegan to suspect that the unprecedented had happened, and that Mrs.\r\nForbes herself was late.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch with suddenly rising amazement. It was ten\r\nminutes past the appointed time. He began feeling around with his foot\r\nfor the electric bell. It was an unaccustomed movement, for his wishes\r\nwere usually anticipated. By the time he found it, he had become a\r\nseriously injured man, and the peal he rang summoned Sarah suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Bring me my coffee at once, if you please. What is the matter?”\r\n\r\nThe maid did not know. He was drinking his first cup when the\r\nhousekeeper entered the room, flushed of countenance.\r\n\r\n“You'll have to excuse me, Mr. Evringham. I couldn't come a minute\r\nsooner. Julia is sick.”\r\n\r\n“Sick! I should like to know why?”\r\n\r\n“Why, she got sopping wet in that brook yesterday, and here, just as I\r\nknew it would be, she's got a fever.”\r\n\r\n“A fever, eh?” repeated Mr. Evringham in a startled tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, and what's more, when I told her you would send for the\r\ndoctor, it was worse than about the rubbers. She talked all the rubbish\r\nyou can think of. I'm sure she's flighty--said she never had a doctor,\r\nthat she always got well, and even cried when I told her that that was\r\nnonsense.”\r\n\r\n“Was she ill all night, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know. I found her trying to get up when I went to her room, and\r\nI saw at once that she wasn't able to.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mrs. Forbes, all I can do is to ask your pardon for adding so\r\nmuch to your cares. Let Sarah bring me my eggs, and then, if you please,\r\ntelephone for Dr. Ballard to come over before his office hour.”\r\n\r\n“I will, sir, but I'll ask you to see the child before you go to town\r\nand make her promise to behave about the doctor. You'd have thought I\r\nwas asking to let in a roaring lion.”\r\n\r\n“Shy, probably.”\r\n\r\n“Shy! That child shy!” thought Mrs. Forbes.\r\n\r\n“She knows Dr. Ballard,” continued the broker, “and if you had thought\r\nto mention him, she wouldn't have made any fuss.”\r\n\r\n“If you'll excuse me differing with you, Mr. Evringham, I don't think\r\nthat child's got a shy bone in her body. In the trolley car yesterday,\r\ndidn't she make up to a perfect stranger! She eyed him and fingered that\r\nlittle gold pin she wears, till he smiled and touched one of the same\r\npattern in his own cravat. Young as she is, she's some kind of a free\r\nmason or secret society, you may be sure. I actually saw him take her\r\nhand and give her the grip as he got out of the car. Why you know who it\r\nis, it was Mr. Reeves of Highland Street.”\r\n\r\n“H'm. You are imaginative, Mrs. Forbes. Mr. Reeves is fond of children,\r\nand Jewel has a friendly way of looking at people.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper bridled. “Well, all is, I guess, you'll find I ain't\r\nimaginative when you come to talk with her about the doctor,” was the\r\nfirm response. “When I said medicine she looked as scared as if I'd said\r\npoison.”\r\n\r\n“H'm. Been dosed then. Mother an allopath probably. Burnt child dreads\r\nthe fire. I think homeopathy is the thing for children. Guy will do very\r\nwell. Call him up at once, please. He might go out.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Evringham had finished his breakfast, he climbed to the\r\nwhite room, planning as he went a short and peremptory speech to the\r\nrebellious one; for he had less time left than usual for his daily talk\r\nwith his housekeeper before catching the train.\r\n\r\nThe curtains in the room were half drawn as he entered, and the child's\r\nfigure looked small in the big white bed. She exclaimed as he drew near,\r\nand seizing his hand, kissed it.\r\n\r\n“You'd better not kiss me, grandpa, because I'm so hot and\r\nuncomfortable,” she said thickly. “Oh, how I wanted to see you all\r\nnight!”\r\n\r\nThe little hands clinging to his were burning. He sat down on the edge\r\nof the bed.\r\n\r\n“I'm very sorry for this, Jewel. It's your own fault, I understand, my\r\ngirl.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know it is. When I first called the house Castle Discord and\r\ntalked to Anna Belle about the error fairy, and the enchanted maiden,\r\nand the giantess, I didn't see it was hate creeping in and making me not\r\ncareful to deny it all. I know it is all my fault.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham gazed at the flushed face with startled eyes. “Dear\r\nme, this is really very bad!” he thought. “Delirious so early in the\r\nmorning. I wish Guy would come!”\r\n\r\n“Well, we'll soon have Dr. Ballard here,” he said aloud, trying to speak\r\nsoothingly. “He'll set you all right very soon.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, grandpa, dear grandpa,” with the utmost earnestness, “would you\r\nplease not send for the doctor? I won't be any trouble. I don't want\r\nanything to eat, only a drink of water, and I'll soon be well.”\r\n\r\nHer beseeching tone and her helplessness touched some unsuspected chord\r\nin her listener's breast.\r\n\r\n“Jewel, don't you want to go out to the stable with me and feed Essex\r\nMaid with sugar?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, grandpa,” with a half sob.\r\n\r\n“You don't want me to be unhappy and worried about you when I get into\r\nmy office?”\r\n\r\n“No, grandpa.”\r\n\r\n“And you liked Dr. Ballard, I'm sure, when you came out with him on the\r\ntrain day before yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Day before yesterday! Oh, _was_ it? It seems a year ago! But I wanted\r\nto come and see you so much I was willing to let father and mother go\r\naway, and I never thought that I wouldn't know when error was getting\r\nhold of me.\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind now, Jewel. Dr. Ballard will help you, and as soon as\r\nyou get well I'll take you for a fine long drive, if you'll be good. I'm\r\nsure you don't want to trouble me.”\r\n\r\n“No.” Another half sob caught the child's throat. “Here is something\r\nI bought for you yesterday, grandpa.” She drew from under the further\r\npillow the yellow chicken, somewhat disheveled, and put it in his hand.\r\n“I meant to give it to you last night, but Mrs. Forbes kept me upstairs\r\nbecause she thought she ought to make me sorry, and so I couldn't.”\r\n\r\nThe stockbroker cleared his throat as he regarded his new possession.\r\n“It was kind of you, Jewel,” he returned. “I shall stand it on my desk.\r\nNow--ahem”--looking around the big empty room, “you won't be lonely, I\r\nhope, until the doctor comes?”\r\n\r\n“No, I'd like to be alone, I have so much work to do.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me, dear me!” thought Mr. Evringham, “this is very distressing.\r\nShe seems to have lucid intervals, and then so quickly gets flighty\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, I like to think of the Ravine of Happiness,” continued the\r\nchild, “and the brook. Supposing I could lay my cheek down in the\r\nbrook now. The water is so cool, and it laughs and whispers such pretty\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“Now if you would try to go to sleep, Jewel,” said Mr. Evringham,\r\n“it would please me very much. Good-by. I shall come to see you again\r\nto-night.” He stooped his tall form and kissed the child's forehead, and\r\nher hot lips pressed his hand, then he went out.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stairs he encountered Mrs. Forbes waiting, and\r\nhastily put behind him the hand that held the chicken.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir?”\r\n\r\n“She's very badly off, very badly off, I'm afraid.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not, sir. Children are always flighty if they have a little\r\nfever. What about dinner, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Have anything you please,” returned Mr. Evringham briefly. “I wish to\r\nsee Dr. Ballard as soon as he arrives. Tell Zeke I shall not go until\r\nthe next train.” With these words the broker entered his study, and his\r\nhousekeeper looked after him in amazement. It was the first time she had\r\never seen him indifferent concerning his dinner.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if he thinks she's got something catching,” she soliloquized.\r\nThen a sudden thought occurred to her. “No great loss without some small\r\ngain,” she thought grimly. “'T would clear the house.”\r\n\r\nShe watched at the window until she saw Dr. Ballard's buggy approaching.\r\nThen she opened the door and met him.\r\n\r\n“Your little visitor do you say?” asked the young doctor as he greeted\r\nher and entered. “What mischief has she been up to so soon?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the usual sort,” returned Mrs. Forbes, and recounted her\r\ngrievances. “She's the oddest child in the world,” she finished, “and\r\nher last freak is that she doesn't want to have a doctor.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me, what heresy!” The young man smiled. “Which room, Mrs. Forbes?”\r\n\r\n“Please go into the library first, Dr. Ballard. Mr. Evringham is waiting\r\nto see you.”\r\n\r\nThe broker was sitting before his desk as the doctor entered, and he\r\nturned with a brief greeting.\r\n\r\n“I'm glad you've come, Ballard. I'm very much troubled about the\r\nchild. Her father and mother abroad you understand, and I feel the\r\nresponsibility. She seems very flighty, quite wild in her talk at\r\nmoments. I wished to warn you that one of her feverish ideas is that she\r\ndoesn't want a doctor. You will have to use some tact.”\r\n\r\nThe physician's face lost its careless smile. “Delirious, you say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, go right up, Guy. I'll wait for you here. It's so sudden. She was\r\nquite well, to all appearances, yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Children are sensitive little mortals,” remarked Dr. Ballard, and then\r\nMrs. Forbes ushered him up to the white room. He asked her to remain\r\nwithin call, and entered alone.\r\n\r\nThe child's eyes were open as he approached the bed, the black case\r\nshe remembered in his hand. By her expression he saw that her mind was\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, Jewel, this isn't the way I meant you to receive me the\r\nfirst time I called,” he said pleasantly, drawing up a chair beside the\r\nbed. The child put out her hand to his offered one and tried to smile.\r\nAs he held the hand he felt her pulse. “This isn't the way to behave\r\nwhen you go visiting,” he added.\r\n\r\n“I know it isn't,” returned Jewel contritely.\r\n\r\n“The next time you go wading in the brook, take off your shoes and\r\nstockings, little one, and I think you would better wait until later\r\nin the season, anyway. You've made quick work of this business.” As\r\nhe talked the doctor took his little thermometer out of its case. “Now\r\nthen, let me slip this under your tongue.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Jewel, shrinking.\r\n\r\n“What! Haven't you ever had your temperature tried? Well, you have been\r\na healthy little girl! All the better. Just take it under your tongue,\r\nand don't speak for a minute, please.”\r\n\r\n“Please don't ask me to. I can't.”\r\n\r\n“There's nothing to be afraid of. It won't hurt you.” The doctor smiled.\r\n\r\n“I know what that is now,” said Jewell, regarding the little tube. “A\r\nman was cured of paralysis once by having a thing like that stuck in his\r\nmouth. He thought it was meant to cure him. I haven't paralysis.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor began to consider that perhaps Mr. Evringham had not\r\nexaggerated. “Come, Jewel,” he said kindly. “I thought we were such good\r\nfriends. You are wasting my time.”\r\n\r\nA moment more of hesitation, and then the child suddenly opened her\r\nmouth and accepted the thermometer. She kept her eyes closed during\r\nthe process of waiting, and at last Dr. Ballard took out the little\r\ninstrument and examined it.\r\n\r\n“Let me see your tongue.”\r\n\r\nThe child stared in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Put out your tongue, Jewel,” he repeated kindly.\r\n\r\n“But that is impolite,” she protested.\r\n\r\nHe changed his position. The poor little thing was flighty, and no\r\nwonder, with such a temperature. He took her hand again. “I'll overlook\r\nthe impoliteness. Run out your tongue now. Far as you can, dear.”\r\n\r\nThe child obeyed.\r\n\r\nPresently she said, “I feel very uncomfortable, Dr. Ballard. I don't\r\nfeel a bit like visiting, so if you wouldn't _mind_ going away until I\r\nfeel better. You interrupted me when you came in. I have lots of work\r\nto do yet. When I get well I'd just love to see you. I'd rather see you\r\nthan almost anybody in Bel-Air.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, dear. I'll go away very soon. Where does your throat feel\r\nsore? Put your finger on the place.”\r\n\r\nJewel looked up with all the rebuke she could convey. “You ought not to\r\nask me that,” she returned.\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard rose and went to the door. “Get me a glass of water, please,\r\nMrs. Forbes.”\r\n\r\n“Not a glass. I want a whole pitcher full right side of me,” said Jewel.\r\n\r\n“Yes, a pitcher full also, if you please, Mrs. Forbes. Just let the maid\r\nbring them up.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor returned to the bedside. “Now we'll soon forget that you wet\r\nthose little feet,” he said.\r\n\r\n“That didn't do me any harm, that clean sweet brook. Mrs. Forbes didn't\r\nknow what was the real matter.”\r\n\r\n“What was it, then?”\r\n\r\n“My own fault,” said Jewel, speaking with feverish quickness and\r\nsqueezing the doctor's hand. “When I came here I found that nobody loved\r\none another and everybody was afraid and sorry, and instead of denying\r\nit and helping them, I began voicing error and calling them names.\r\nI didn't keep remembering that God was here, and I called it Castle\r\nDiscord and called Mrs. Forbes the giantess, and aunt Madge the error\r\nfairy, and cousin Eloise the enchanted maiden, and of course how could I\r\nhelp getting sick?”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard leaned toward her. Was this an impromptu tale, or was it a\r\nfact that this child had been coldly treated and unhappy? “You have a\r\nsensitive conscience, Jewel,” he returned.\r\n\r\nHere Sarah entered, set down the tray with pitcher, glasses, and spoon,\r\nand departed. The doctor loosed the little hand he had been holding,\r\ntook up his case, and opened it.\r\n\r\nJewel watched him with apprehension. “That's--medicine isn't it?” she\r\nasked with bated breath.\r\n\r\n“Yes.” The doctor carefully selected a bottle of liquid and set it on\r\nthe table. “I think this one will do us.”\r\n\r\nJewel's remark on the train about materia medica recurred to him, and he\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Ballard, aren't you a Christian?” she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up. “I hope so.”\r\n\r\n“Then you'll forgive me if I won't take medicine. I put out my tongue,\r\nand I sucked the little glass thing because I didn't want to trouble\r\nyou; but I have too much faith in God to take medicine.” The child\r\nlooked at the doctor appealingly.\r\n\r\nHe began to see light, and in his surprise, for a moment he did not\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“Jesus Christ would have used drugs if they had been right,” she added.\r\n\r\n“But He isn't here now,” returned the astonished young man.\r\n\r\n“Why, Dr. Ballard,” in gentle reproach, “Christ is the Truth of God.\r\nIsn't He here now, healing us and helping us just the same as ever?\r\nDidn't He say He would be? You will see how much better I shall be\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard met the heavy eyes with his own kind, clear ones. “I see you\r\nhave been taught in new ways, Jewel,” he said seriously, “but you are\r\nonly a little girl, and while you are in your grandfather's house you\r\nought to do as he wishes. He wishes you to let me prescribe for you. No\r\none who is ill can help making trouble. You have no right not to try to\r\nget well in the way Mr. Evringham and Mrs. Forbes wish you to.”\r\n\r\nJewel felt herself in a desperate position. The corners of her lips\r\ntwitched down. Dr. Ballard thought he saw his advantage, and leaned his\r\nfine head toward her. She impulsively threw her arms around his neck.\r\n\r\n“You don't want to hurt my feelings, Jewel,” he said. She was crying\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n“No--it would make me--very--sorry, but it would be--worse--to\r\nhurt--God's. Please don't make me, please, please don't make me, Dr.\r\nBallard!”\r\n\r\nShe was increasingly excited, and he feared the effect.\r\n\r\n“Very well then, Jewel,” he returned. “I don't want to do you more harm\r\nthan good.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you!” she exclaimed fervently, through her tears.\r\n\r\n“But Mrs. Forbes must think you have the medicine. You haven't told her\r\nthat you are--ahem--a Christian Scientist. I suppose that is what you\r\ncall yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. A Christian Scientist. Oh, you're the kindest man,” pursued\r\nthe relieved child. “I realized in my prayer that you didn't know it was\r\nwrong to believe in material medica, for you reflect love all the time.”\r\n\r\nWhile she was talking and wiping her eyes the doctor took the pitcher\r\nand one of the glasses to the window, and stood with his back to her.\r\n\r\n“Now then,” he said, returning, “we'll put this half glass of water on\r\nthe table. I put the spoon across it so, and when Mrs. Forbes is next in\r\nthe room you take a couple of spoonfuls and that will satisfy her. You\r\nmay tell her that I wanted you only to take it about four times during\r\nthe day. If you are better when I come back this evening, I will not\r\ninsist upon your taking any pellets on your tongue. Here is the other\r\nglass for you to drink from.”\r\n\r\nWith a few more kind words Dr. Ballard took his departure, and going\r\ndownstairs met Mrs. Forbes. “The little girl has a heavy feverish cold.\r\nShe understands how to take her medicine. She will probably sleep a good\r\ndeal. Let her be quiet.”\r\n\r\nHe went on to the study, where Mr. Evringham was waiting, sitting at the\r\ndesk, his head on his hand, frowning at the yellow chicken. He looked up\r\nexpectantly as the doctor entered.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he asked.\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard came forward and seated himself in a neighboring chair.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what you have upstairs there?” he asked in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“For heaven's sake, Guy, don't tell me it's something serious--something\r\ninfectious!” Mr. Evringham turned pale.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's sudden smile was reassuring. “It does seem to be infectious\r\nto some degree,” he returned, “but I don't believe you'll catch it.”\r\n\r\n“What are you grinning at, boy?” asked the broker sharply.\r\n\r\n“Don't be alarmed, Mr. Evringham, but the fact is, that you have in your\r\nhouse a small and young but perfectly formed and well-developed specimen\r\nof a Christian Scientist.”\r\n\r\n“What, man!” The broker grew red again.\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard nodded deliberately. “Your little granddaughter belongs to\r\nthe new cult; and I can assure you she is dyed in the wool, and moreover\r\nis all wool and a yard wide.”\r\n\r\n“The devil you say!” ejaculated Mr. Evringham. “But,” he added with\r\na sudden thought, “that may be a part of the poor child's feverish\r\nnonsense. She was full of talk of castles and giantesses and fairies and\r\nwhat not when I was up there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. She is no flightier than you are this minute. All these titles are\r\nthose she has given to your house and household in the last two days,\r\nand according to her diagnosis, it is that indulgence from which she\r\nis suffering now, and not from too much brook. She says she has 'voiced\r\nerror.'”\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked quizzically at his friend, who returned his gaze,\r\nnonplussed.\r\n\r\n“That's it--'error,'” rejoined Mr. Evringham, “that's what she is\r\noften saying. This explains her vocabulary, in all probability. She\r\nhas sometimes the strangest talk you ever listened to. Well, that's the\r\nmother's doing, of course, and not the child's fault. I maintain it is\r\nnot the child's fault. With it all, Ballard, I tell you she's a very\r\nwell meaning child--a rather winning child, in fact. Good natured\r\ndisposition. I hope she's not very ill. I do, indeed. Ha! That, then, is\r\nwhy she was so excited at the thought of having a doctor. Tomfoolery!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that was it. We've had some argument.” The young doctor smiled.\r\n“She doesn't consider me hopeless, however. She told me that she had\r\nmentioned to the Lord that she was sure I didn't know it was wrong to\r\nbelieve in materia medica.”\r\n\r\nNo one for years had heard Mr. Evringham laugh as he laughed at this.\r\nThe doctor joined him.\r\n\r\n“I'm not surprised,” said the broker at last. “If there is anything she\r\ndoes not mention to her Creator, I have yet to learn what it is. How did\r\nyou get around her, Ballard?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I used a little justifiable hocus-pocus about the medicine. That's\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“And you think it's not anything very serious, then?”\r\n\r\n“I think not. Where there's so much temperature it is a little hard to\r\ntell at first with a child. This evening I shall make a more thorough\r\nexamination. The ice is broken now, and it will be easier. She will be\r\nless excited. I see,” glancing at the yellow chicken, whose beady eyes\r\nappeared to be following the conversation, “the little girl has found\r\nher way even into this sanctum.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham cleared his throat as he followed the doctor's glance.\r\n“No,” he responded shortly. “She has not found her way in here yet. That\r\nis--my chicken. She bought it for me.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard lifted his eyebrows and smiled as he arose.\r\n\r\n“Come back before dinner if possible, Ballard. I shall be uneasy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE TELEGRAM\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes entered Jewel's room after speaking with the doctor. The\r\nlittle girl looked at her eagerly. A plan had formed in her mind which\r\ndepended for its success largely on the housekeeper's complaisance, and\r\nshe wished to propitiate her.\r\n\r\n“I want to fix it so you can call me when you need anything, Julia,” she\r\nsaid. “The doctor has told you about taking the medicine, and here is a\r\nlittle clock I'm going to put on your table right by the bed, and I've\r\nbrought up a bell. I shall leave the farther door open so the sound of\r\nthis bell will go right down the backstairs, and one of us will come up\r\nwhenever you ring. Dr. Ballard says it's best for you to be quiet.”\r\n\r\n“Yes'm,” replied Jewel. “Do you think, Mrs. Forbes--would it be too much\r\ntrouble--would he have time--could I see Jeremiah just a few minutes?”\r\n\r\n“See who?”\r\n\r\n“Jeremiah--the gentleman who lives with the horses.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean my son Ezekiel?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes'm. Ezekiel. I knew it was a prophet. He always speaks very\r\nkindly to me, and I like him. I wish I could see him just a few\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes was very much astonished and somewhat flattered. “It's\r\nwonderful, the fancy that child has taken to me and mine,” she thought.\r\n\r\n“Well, folks must be humored when they're sick,” she replied. “Let me\r\nsee,” looking at the little clock, “yes, Mr. Evringham's missed the\r\nsecond train. There'll be five or ten minutes yet, and 'Zekiel's got to\r\nwait anyway. I guess he can come up and see you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you, Mrs. Forbes!” returned Jewel.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper made her way out to the barn, where her son in his\r\nlivery was waiting and reading the paper.\r\n\r\n“The doctor's gone, Zeke, and the child wants to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Me?” returned the coachman in surprise. “Why the bully little kid!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, come and be quick. There won't be much time. You watch the clock\r\nthat's side of her bed, and don't you be late.”\r\n\r\n'Zekiel followed with alacrity. His mother, starting him up the\r\nbackstairs, gave him directions how to go, and remained below.\r\n\r\nJewel, her eyes fixed on the open back door of her room, felt a leap\r\nof the heart as Zeke, fine in his handsome livery, came blushing and\r\ntiptoeing into the room.\r\n\r\n“I'm so glad, I'm so glad!” she exclaimed in her soft, thick voice.\r\n“Shut the door, please.”\r\n\r\n“I told you to remember you'd only got to say 'Zeke' and I'd come,” he\r\nsaid, approaching the bed. “I'm awful sorry you're sick, little kid.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever hear of Christian Science, Zeke?” she asked hurriedly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did. Woman I knew in Boston cured of half a dozen things. She\r\nheld that Christian Science did it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, good, good. I'm a Christian Scientist, and nobody here is, and I\r\nwant to send a telegram to Chicago, to a lady to treat me. Nobody would\r\ndo it for me but you. _Will_ you?”\r\n\r\nIt would have taken a hard heart to resist the appeal, and Zeke's was\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\n“Of course I will,” he answered. “Going right to the station now to take\r\nMr. Evringham. I can send it as well as not.”\r\n\r\n“Get some paper, Zeke, in the top bureau drawer. There's a pencil on the\r\nbureau.”\r\n\r\nHe obeyed, and she gave him an address which he wrote down. “Now this:\r\n'Please treat me for fever and sore throat. Jewel.'”\r\n\r\nZeke wrote the message and tucked it into a pocket.\r\n\r\n“Now please get my leather bag in the drawer,” said the child, “and take\r\nout money enough.”\r\n\r\nThe young fellow hesitated. “If you haven't got plenty of money”--he\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n“I have. You'll see. Oh, Zeke, you've made me so happy!”\r\n\r\nThe coachman's clumsy hands fumbled with the clasp of the little bag.\r\n\r\n“I can do it,” said Jewel, and he brought it to her and watched her\r\nwhile she took out the money and gave it to him. He took a coin,\r\nreturned the rest to the bag, and snapped it.\r\n\r\n“Say, little girl,” he said uneasily, “you look to me like a doctor'd do\r\nyou a whole lot o' good.”\r\n\r\nJewel gazed at him in patient wonder.\r\n\r\n“Who made the doctor?” she asked.\r\n\r\nZeke stood on one foot and then on the other.\r\n\r\n“God did, and you know it, Zeke. He's the one to go to in trouble.”\r\n\r\n“But you're going to that Chicago woman,” objected Zeke.\r\n\r\n“Yes, because she'll go to God for me. I'm being held down by something\r\nthat pretends to have power, and though I know it's an old cheat, I\r\nhaven't understanding enough to get rid of it as quickly as she will.\r\nYou see, I wouldn't have been taken sick if I hadn't believed in a lie\r\ninstead of denying it. We have to watch our thoughts every minute, and I\r\ntell you, Zeke, sometimes it seems real hard work.”\r\n\r\n“Should say so,” returned 'Zekiel. “The less you think the better, I\r\nshould suppose, if that's the case. I've got to be going now.”\r\n\r\n“And you'll send the telegram _surely_, and you won't speak of it to any\r\none?”\r\n\r\n“Mum's the word, and I'll send it if it's the last act; but don't put\r\nall your eggs in one basket, little kid. I know Dr. Ballard's been here,\r\nand now you do everything he said, like a good girl, and between the two\r\nof 'em they ought to fix you up. I'd pin more faith to a doctor in the\r\nhand than to one in the bush a thousand miles away, if 't was _me_.”\r\n\r\nJewel smiled on him from heavy eyes. “Did you ever hear of God's needing\r\nany help?” she asked. “I'll never forget your being so kind to me,\r\nnever, Zeke; and when error melts away I'm coming out to the stable with\r\ngrandpa. He said I should. Good-by.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plum-colored livery had disappeared Jewel drew herself\r\nup, took the water pitcher between her hot little hands, and drank long\r\nand deeply. Then with a sigh of satisfaction she turned over in bed and\r\ndrew Anna Belle close to her.\r\n\r\n“Just see, dearie,” she murmured, “how we are always taken care of!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham saw Dr. Ballard's buggy drive away and lost no time in\r\ndiscovering who had needed his services.\r\n\r\n“It's the child,” she announced, returning to Eloise's room.\r\n\r\n“Poor little thing,” returned the girl, rising.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going? Stay right where you are. She has a high fever,\r\nand they're not sure yet what it may be. Mrs. Forbes is doing everything\r\nthat is necessary. Father has waited over two trains. He hasn't gone to\r\nthe city yet.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Mr. Evringham Eloise sank back in her chair.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Ballard is coming again toward evening,” continued Mrs. Evringham,\r\n“and I shall talk with him and find out just the conditions. Mrs.\r\nForbes is very unsatisfactory, but I can see that she thinks it may be\r\nsomething infectious.”\r\n\r\nEloise lifted a suddenly hopeful face. “Then you would wish to leave at\r\nonce?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Not at all. Father would surely hear to reason and send the child to\r\nthe hospital. They are models of comfort in these days, and it is the\r\nonly proper place for people to be ill. I shall speak to Dr. Ballard\r\nabout it to-night.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Eloise had seen her grandfather drive to the station she\r\neluded her mother, and gathering her white negligee about her, went\r\nsoftly up to Jewel's room and stood at the closed door. All was still.\r\nShe opened the door stealthily. With all her care it creaked a little.\r\nStill no sound from within. She looked toward the bed, saw the flushed\r\nface of the child and that she was asleep, so she withdrew as quietly.\r\n\r\nDuring the day she inquired of Mrs. Forbes if she could be of any\r\nservice, but the housekeeper received the suggestion with curt respect,\r\nassuring her that Dr. Ballard had said Jewel would sleep a good deal,\r\nand should not be disturbed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham overheard the question and welcomed the reply with\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nJewel ate the bread and fruit and milk that Mrs. Forbes gave her for her\r\nlate lunch, and said that she felt better.\r\n\r\n“You look so,” returned the housekeeper. The child had not once called\r\nher upstairs during the morning. She certainly was as little trouble as\r\na sick child could be.\r\n\r\n“If 't was anybody else,” mused Mrs. Forbes, regarding her, “I should\r\nsay that she sensed the situation and knew she'd brought it on herself\r\nand me, and was trying to make up for it; but nobody can tell what she\r\nthinks. Her eyes do look more natural. I guess Dr. Ballard's a good\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“It don't seem to hurt you to swallow now,” remarked Mrs. Forbes.\r\n\r\n“No'm, it doesn't, she answered.\r\n\r\n“Now then, you see how foolish and naughty it was the way you behaved\r\nabout having the doctor this morning. Look how much better you are\r\nalready!”\r\n\r\n“Yes'm, I love Dr. Ballard.”\r\n\r\n“You well may. He's done well by you.” Mrs. Forbes took the tray. “Now\r\ndo you feel like going to sleep again? The doctor won't come till about\r\nsix o'clock. Your fever'll rise toward evening, and that's the time he\r\nwants to see you. I shall sleep in the spare room next you to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mrs. Forbes. You are so kind; but you won't have to,”\r\n replied the child earnestly. “Would you please draw up the curtains\r\nand put Anna Belle's clothes on the bed? Perhaps I'll dress her after a\r\nwhile. It doesn't seem fair to make her stay in bed when it wasn't her\r\nerror.”\r\n\r\n“I don't think you'd better keep your arms out,” returned Mrs. Forbes\r\ndecidedly. “I'll put up the curtains, but when you come to try to do\r\nanything you'll find you are very weak. You can ring the bell when you\r\nwant to, you know. And don't take your medicine again for an hour after\r\neating. I'd take another nap right away if I was you.”\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone out, Jewel shook her head at the doll, whose face was\r\nsmiling toward her own. “You denied it, didn't you, dearie, the minute\r\nshe said it,” she whispered. “Error is using Mrs. Forbes to hold me\r\nunder mortal mind laws, but it can't be so, because God doesn't want it,\r\nand I'm not afraid any more.”\r\n\r\nJewel put her hand under her pillow and drew out the two slips of paper\r\nthat bore her mother's messages. These she read through several times.\r\n“Of course there are more, Anna Belle. I shouldn't wonder if there was\r\none in every pocket, but I don't mean to hunt. Divine love will send\r\nthem to me just when I need them, the way He did these. I'm sorry I\r\ncan't dress you, dearie, because you've just reflected love all the\r\ntime, and ought not to be in bed at all; but I must obey, you know, so\r\nthere won't be discord. I'd love to just hop up and get your clothes,\r\nbut you'll forgive me for not, I know.”\r\n\r\nAgain Jewel put her hand under her pillow and drew forth her copy of\r\n“Science and Health.” “I'll read to you a little, dearie.” She opened\r\nthe book to page 393 and read, “Rise in the strength of Spirit to resist\r\nall that is unlike God.” Jewel paused and thought for a minute. “You\r\nmight think, Anna Belle, that that meant rise against Mrs. Forbes, but\r\nit doesn't. It means rise against all error, and one error is believing\r\nthat Mrs. Forbes is cross or afraid.” She went on reading for several\r\nminutes, passing glibly over familiar phrases and sticking at or\r\nskipping words which presented difficulties.\r\n\r\nWhile she was thus employed Eloise again stole quietly to her cousin's\r\ndoor, and hearing the soft voice she grew pale. Her mother had exacted\r\na promise from her that she would not enter the room until Dr. Ballard\r\nconsented, so after a minute's hesitation she fled downstairs and found\r\nMrs. Forbes.\r\n\r\n“I think the little girl must be worse! She is talking to herself\r\nincessantly.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes regarded the pale face coldly. “I guess there's some\r\nmistake. She was better when I saw her half an hour ago. I'll go up in a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nThe minute stretched to five; Jewel had slept scarcely at all the night\r\nbefore, and by the time the housekeeper had laboriously reached her\r\ndoor, her voice had grown fainter, then stopped, and she was sound\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n“I wish Mamzell would keep her finger out of this pie,” soliloquized\r\nMrs. Forbes as she retraced her steps.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Evringham returned from the city, his first question, as Zeke\r\nmet him, was concerning Jewel.\r\n\r\n“Mother says she's slept the most of the day,” replied the coachman, his\r\nhead stiff in his high collar and his eyes looking straight ahead.\r\n\r\n“H'm. A good sign does she think, or is it stupor?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn't say, sir.”\r\n\r\nReaching the house, a long pasteboard box in his hands, Mr. Evringham\r\nfound that his grandchild was still asleep.\r\n\r\n“I fear the worst, Mrs. Forbes,” he said with nervous curtness. “When a\r\nstupor attacks children it is a very bad sign I am told. I'll just ring\r\nup Ballard.”\r\n\r\nHe did so, but the doctor had gone out and was intending to call at the\r\npark before he returned.\r\n\r\n“I really think it is all right, Mr. Evringham,” said Mrs. Forbes,\r\ndistressed by her employer's uneasiness. “Dr. Ballard expected she'd\r\nsleep a great deal. He told me not to disturb her.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well then, perhaps it is not to be regretted. Kindly put those\r\nroses in the deep vase, Mrs. Forbes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.” She took up the box. “Besides, Mr. Evringham, if she does\r\nget worse, you know the hospital here is one of the very best, and\r\nyou”--\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham wheeled and frowned upon the speaker fiercely. “Hospital!”\r\n he ejaculated. “An extraordinary suggestion, Mrs. Forbes! Most\r\nextraordinary! My granddaughter remains in my house.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes, crimson with surprise and mortification, retreated. “Very\r\nwell, sir,” she faltered. “Will you have the roses on the dinner table,\r\nMr. Evringham?”\r\n\r\n“No. Set them here on my desk if you please.” With this Mr. Evringham\r\nbegan walking up and down the floor, pausing once to take up the yellow\r\nchicken. During the day the soft moan, “I wanted you so all night,\r\ngrandpa,” had been ringing in his ears.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Forbes has no understanding of the child,” he muttered, “and of\r\ncourse I cannot expect anything from the cat and her kitten.”\r\n\r\nWith this he began again his promenade. Mrs. Forbes returned with the\r\nroses, and simultaneously Mr. Evringham saw Essex Maid arching her neck\r\nas she picked her steps past the window.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” he said curtly, “let Zeke take the Maid back to the barn.\r\nI'll not ride to-day.”\r\n\r\n“It's very fine weather, sir,” protested Mrs. Forbes.\r\n\r\n“I'll not ride. I'll wait here for Dr. Ballard.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper went forth to give the order.\r\n\r\n“I never saw Mr. Evringham so upset in my life,” she said in an\r\nawestruck tone.\r\n\r\n“I saw the governor wasn't real comfortable,” returned the boy. “Guess\r\nhe's afraid he's goin' to catch the mumps or something. It would be real\r\nharrowin' if he got any worse case of big head than he's got already.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham was little accustomed to waiting, and by the time Dr.\r\nBallard appeared, his nervousness had become painful. “The child's slept\r\ntoo much, I'm sure of it, Ballard,” was his greeting. “I don't know what\r\nwe're going to find up there, I declare I don't.”\r\n\r\n“It depends on whether it's a good sleep,” returned the doctor, and his\r\ncomposed face and manner acted at once beneficially upon Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“Well, you'll know, Guy, you'll know, my boy. Mrs. Forbes saw you\r\ncoming, and she has gone upstairs to prepare the little girl. She'll be\r\nglad to see you this time, I'll wager.”\r\n\r\nThe broker, roses in hand, ascended the staircase after the physician.\r\nMrs. Forbes was standing at the foot of the bed, and the room was\r\npleasantly light as they entered. Jewel, the flush of sleep on her\r\ncheeks, was looking expectantly toward the door. Dr. Ballard came in\r\nfirst and she smiled in welcome, then Mr. Evringham appeared, heavy\r\nroses nodding in all directions before him.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa!” exclaimed the child. “Why, grandpa, did _you_ come?”\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the joy in her tone. Dr. Ballard paused in\r\nsurprise, while the stockbroker approached the bed.\r\n\r\n“I brought you a few flowers, Jewel,” he said, while she pressed his\r\ndisengaged hand against her cheek.\r\n\r\n“They're the most lovely ones I ever saw,” she returned with conviction.\r\n“They make me happy just to look at them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Jewel,” said the doctor, “I hear you've been making up for\r\nlost sleep in great shape.” His eyes, as he spoke, were taking in with\r\nconcentrated interest the signs in her face. He came and sat beside the\r\nbed, while Mr. Evringham fell back and Mrs. Forbes regarded the child\r\ncritically.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, you're a good little patient,” went on the doctor, as he\r\nnoted the clear eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Dr. Ballard, I feel just as nice as can be,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“No thickness in the voice. I fancy that sore throat is better.” The\r\nyoung doctor could not repress his smile of satisfaction. “I was certain\r\nthat was the right attenuation,” he thought. “Now let us see.”\r\n\r\nHe took out the little thermometer, and Jewel submitted to having it\r\nslipped beneath her tongue.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Ballard leaned back in his chair to wait, he looked up at Mr.\r\nEvringham. “It is very gratifying,” he said, “to find these conditions\r\nat this hour of the day. I felt a little more uneasy this morning than I\r\nconfessed.” He nodded in satisfactory thought. “I grant you medicine is\r\nnot an exact science, it is an art, an art. You can't prescribe by hard\r\nand fast rules. You must take into consideration the personal equation.”\r\n\r\nPresently he leaned forward and removed the thermometer. His eyes smiled\r\nas he read it, and he lifted it toward Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“I can't see it, boy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there's nothing to see. She hasn't a particle of temperature.\r\nLook here, little one,” frowning at Jewel, “if everybody recovered as\r\nquickly as you have, where would we doctors be?”\r\n\r\nTurning again and addressing Mr. Evringham, he went on, “I'm\r\nparticularly interested in this result because that is a remedy over\r\nwhich there has been some altercation. There's one man to whom I shall\r\nbe glad to relate this experience.” The doctor leaned toward his\r\nlittle patient. “Jewel, I'm not so surprised as I might be at your\r\nimprovement,” he said kindly. “You will have to excuse me for a little\r\nrighteous deception. I put medicine into that glass of water, and now\r\nyou're glad I did, aren't you? I'd like you to tell me, little girl, as\r\nnear as you can, how often you took it?”\r\n\r\n“I didn't take it,” replied the child.\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard drew back a little. “You mean,” he said after a moment, “you\r\ntook it only once?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I didn't take it at all.”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, during which all could hear the ticking of the\r\nclock on the table, and the three pairs eyes were fixed on Jewel with\r\nsuch varying expressions of amazement and disapproval that the child's\r\nbreath began to come faster.\r\n\r\n“Didn't you drink any of the water?” asked Dr. Ballard at last.\r\n\r\n“Yes, out of the pitcher.”\r\n\r\n“Why not out of the glass?”\r\n\r\n“It didn't look enough. I was so thirsty.”\r\n\r\nThey could not doubt her.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham finally found his voice.\r\n\r\n“Jewel, why didn't you obey the doctor?” His eyes and voice were so\r\nserious that she stretched out her arm.\r\n\r\n“Oh, grandpa,” she said, “please let me take hold of your hand.”\r\n\r\n“No, not till you answer me. Little girls should be obedient.”\r\n\r\nJewel thought a minute.\r\n\r\n“He said it wasn't medicine, so what was the use?” she asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham, seeming to find an answer to this difficult, bit the end\r\nof his mustache.\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard was feeling his very ears grow red, while Mrs. Forbes's lips\r\nwere set in a line of exasperation.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa,” said Jewel, and the child's voice was very earnest, “there's\r\na Bible over there on the table. You look in there in the Gospels, and\r\nyou'll find everywhere how Jesus tells us to do what I've done. He said\r\nhe must go away, but he would send the Comforter to us, and this book\r\ntells about the Comforter.” Jewel took the copy of “Science and Health”\r\n from under the sheet.\r\n\r\n“God's creation couldn't get sick. It's just His own image and likeness,\r\nso how could it? And when you can get right into God's love, what do you\r\nwant of medicine to swallow? God wouldn't be omnipotent if He needed any\r\nhelp. You see I'm well. Isn't that all you want, grandpa?”\r\n\r\nThe appeal of her eyes caused the broker to stir undecidedly. “I never\r\ndid have any use for doctors,” he thought, after the manner of many who,\r\nnevertheless, are eager to fly to the brotherhood for help at the first\r\nsuggestion of pain. Moreover, the humor of the situation was beginning\r\nto dawn upon him, and he admired the fine temper and self-control with\r\nwhich the young physician pulled himself together and rose.\r\n\r\n“_I_ am glad you are well, Jewel, very,” he said; “but the next time I\r\nam called to prescribe for a little Christian Scientist I shall put\r\nthe pellets on her tongue.” He smiled as he took up his case and said\r\ngood-by.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham followed him down the stairs, heroically resisting the\r\nimpulse to laugh. Only one remark he allowed himself as he bade the\r\ndoctor good-by.\r\n\r\n“You're quite right, Ballard, in your theory. Jewel has been here only\r\nthree days, but I could have told you that in doing anything whatever\r\nfor her, it is always absolutely necessary to consider the personal\r\nequation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nIN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Evringham turned from the closed door he met his daughter-in-law\r\ncoming out into the hall.\r\n\r\n“I've been watching for Dr. Ballard,” she said with annoyance. “I don't\r\nsee why I didn't hear him come down.” At this juncture she paused,\r\nsurprised to observe that her father-in-law was laughing. She attributed\r\nthis unusual ebullition to ridicule of herself.\r\n\r\n“I only wanted to ask if Julia's illness is infectious,” she went on\r\nwith dignity. “Eloise and I are naturally very anxious. We should like\r\nto do anything for her we can, if it is quite safe.”\r\n\r\n“Madam, don't, I pray, for all our sakes, run any risk,” returned Mr.\r\nEvringham, his lips still twitching as he bowed mockingly.\r\n\r\n“It would be very foolish,” answered Mrs. Evringham, unabashed. “You\r\nwouldn't care to have more invalids on your hands. It has been all I\r\ncould do to keep Eloise away from the sick room to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible!” commented Mr. Evringham, smoothing his mustache.\r\n\r\n“Not only possible but true, and I wished to go to headquarters and find\r\nout the exact state of the case.”\r\n\r\nAgain the broker's shoulders began to shake.\r\n\r\n“Ballard isn't headquarters,” he replied.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham regarded him, startled. She wondered if affairs were\r\nperhaps very serious, and her father-in-law's nerves overstrained.\r\nShe knew that he had dispensed with the afternoon ride which was so\r\nimportant to him.\r\n\r\nShe grew a shade paler. “I wish you would tell me, father, just what the\r\ndoctor said,” she begged.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham raised a protesting hand. “I couldn't think of it,” he\r\nlaughed. “It would give me apoplexy.”\r\n\r\nHis daughter-in-law began to retreat, and the broker passed her and went\r\ninto his study, still laughing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham stood with lips parted, looking after him. Her heart beat\r\nfast. The doctor had called twice. He had come down the stairs in dead\r\nsilence just now. She knew it, for she had been listening and waiting\r\nto intercept him. She had meant to say a number of pretty things to him\r\nconcerning Eloise's anxiety about her little cousin. Her own anxiety\r\nredoubled, and she hurried to her daughter's room and narrated her\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n“I really think we may have to go, Eloise,” she finished nervously.\r\n“Even if it isn't infectious, it is so dreadfully dispiriting to be in a\r\nhouse where there is a dangerous illness, and possibly worse. I've been\r\nthinking perhaps we might go in town and take lodgings for a while. No\r\none need know it. We could even stay there through the summer. None of\r\nour friends would be in town; then in autumn we could come back here.”\r\n\r\nEloise's lip curled. “I doubt that,” she returned. “Grandfather will\r\nbe forearmed. I prophesy, mother, that you will never get our trunks up\r\nhere again after you once take them out.”\r\n\r\n“Really, Eloise, you do put things most repulsively,” returned Mrs.\r\nEvringham with vexation. “Besides, how do we know what the future is\r\ngoing to bring forth? Father behaves to me as if he might be on the\r\nverge of brain fever himself.”\r\n\r\n“Poor little Jewel!” exclaimed the girl. “I hope she will pull through,\r\nbut if she is the cause of our leaving here, I shall always love her\r\nmemory.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know whether father will even come to dinner,” said Mrs.\r\nEvringham, pursuing her own thoughts, “but I suppose we shall see Mrs.\r\nForbes. I do hope she has some sense about using disinfectants. It's\r\noutrageous for her to come near the dining-room when she is taking care\r\nof that child. Of course they'll have a nurse at once. Forbes doesn't\r\nlike going out of her beaten track.”\r\n\r\n“I can't forget that poor little voice rambling on so monotonously this\r\nafternoon,” said Eloise. “I strained my ears to listen, but I could\r\nmake out only that she said something about 'love' and then about\r\n'righteousness.' What a word for that little mouth.”\r\n\r\n“I've seen smaller,” remarked Mrs. Evringham.\r\n\r\nWhen finally they entered the dining-room punctually at the appointed\r\nhour,--even Mrs. Evringham dared take no liberties with that,--the host\r\nwas there and greeted them as usual. Mrs. Forbes came in and took her\r\nposition near him. Her employer gave her a side glance. His fears for\r\nJewel allayed, his regard for his housekeeper's opinions had returned in\r\nfull force.\r\n\r\nHe wished to ask for the little girl, to ask what she was doing now, and\r\nwhat she would like sent up for dinner, but he had not the courage. The\r\naghast countenance which Mrs. Forbes had exhibited at the moment when\r\nthe enormity of Jewel's conduct transpired remained in his memory. The\r\nhousekeeper's appearance at present was noncommittal. Mrs. Evringham\r\nsent her piercing and questioning glances in vain.\r\n\r\nThe silence in the usually silent room had not had time to become\r\nnoticeable when the portiere was pushed aside and Jewel, arrayed in\r\nthe dotted dress and carefully bearing the tall vase of nodding roses,\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham uttered a little cry and dropped her spoon. Eloise stared\r\nwild-eyed. The housekeeper flushed.\r\n\r\n“Good evening,” said the child, glancing about as she approached, and\r\nsighing with relief as she set the heavy vase on the edge of the table.\r\n“I had to come down so carefully not to spill, grandpa, that it made\r\nme a little late. Mrs. Forbes said you brought me the roses under\r\nfalse--false pretends, so I thought perhaps you would like them on the\r\ntable.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper, hurrying forward, seized the vase from its precarious\r\nposition and placed it in the centre of the board. “I didn't tell you\r\nyou might come downstairs,” she said, as she buttoned the middle button\r\nof Jewel's dress.\r\n\r\nThe little girl looked up in innocent surprise. “You said I might dress\r\nme, so why should anybody have to bring up my dinner?” she asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes's countenance looked so lowering that Mr. Evringham hastened\r\nto speak in his brusque and final fashion. “She is here now. Might as\r\nwell let her stay.”\r\n\r\nJewel jumped into her chair and turned toward him with an apologetic\r\nsmile. “I couldn't make my hair look very nice,” she said, with the\r\nlift of her shoulders which he had come to connect with her confidential\r\nmoments. Remembering the feverish child of the morning, he looked at her\r\nin silent wonder. The appearance of her flaxen head he could see was\r\nin contrast to the trim and well-cared-for look it had worn when she\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n“Poor little thing!” he thought. “She looks motherless--motherless.”\r\n Involuntarily he cast a glance of impatience at his other guests. The\r\nexpression of blank amazement on their faces stirred him to amusement.\r\n\r\n“If you are afraid of infection, Madge, don't hesitate to retire to your\r\nroom,” he said. “Your dinner will be sent to you.”\r\n\r\n“What does this mean!” ejaculated Mrs. Evringham. “Why is Dr. Ballard\r\ncoming twice a day to see that child?”\r\n\r\n“To cure her, of course,” returned the broker, his lips breaking into\r\nsmiles. “Why do doctors generally visit patients?”\r\n\r\n“Then when he came the second time he found her well?”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha,” laughed Mr. Evringham, “yes, that's it. He found her well.”\r\n\r\nEloise and her mother gazed at him in astonishment. Mrs. Forbes's\r\nface was immovable. A sense of humor was not included in her mental\r\nequipment, and she considered the whole affair lamentable and unseemly\r\nin the extreme.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa,” said Jewel, looking at him with gentle reproach, “you're not\r\nlaughing at Dr. Ballard, are you? He's the _kindest_ man. I love him,\r\nnext to you, best of anybody in Bel-Air”--then thinking this declaration\r\nmight hurt her aunt and cousin, she added, “because I know him the best,\r\nyou know. He tried to deceive me about the medicine, but it was only\r\nbecause he didn't know that there isn't any righteous deceiving. He\r\nmeant to do me good.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham looked curiously from the child to her father-in-law. As\r\nshe herself said later, she had never felt so “out of it” in her life.\r\nAs the subject concerned Dr. Ballard, she wished to understand clearly\r\nwhat circumstance could possibly have induced Mr. Evringham to laugh\r\nrepeatedly.\r\n\r\n“I was passing your door this afternoon,” said Eloise, addressing Jewel,\r\n“and I heard you talking. I knew there was no one with you, and I feared\r\nyou were very ill.”\r\n\r\nThe little girl was always pleased when her beautiful cousin looked at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“I guess I was reading. Of course I was in a hurry to get well, so as\r\nsoon as the fever was gone and I felt comfortable, I began to read\r\nout loud from 'Science and Health' to Anna Belle. She's a Christian\r\nScientist, too.”\r\n\r\nThe faces of Mrs. Evringham and Eloise were studies as they gazed at the\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham glanced at them maliciously under his heavy brows as Sarah\r\nbrought in the second course.\r\n\r\n“Is Anna Belle your doll?” asked Eloise, for the moment sufficiently\r\ninterested almost to lose her self-consciousness.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” eagerly. “Would you like to see her?” Jewel gave a fleeting\r\nglance at Mrs. Forbes. “She always comes to the table with me at home,”\r\n she added.\r\n\r\n“Sit still,” murmured Mrs. Forbes in low, sepulchral warning.\r\n\r\n“Now then, Jewel,” said Mr. Evringham as he began to serve the filet,\r\n“you didn't take the doctor's medicine. What do you think made that high\r\nfever go away?”\r\n\r\nThe little girl looked up brightly. “Oh, I telegraphed to Mrs. Lewis,\r\none of mother's friends in Chicago, to treat me.”\r\n\r\n“The dev--What do you mean, child?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham gazed at her, and his tone was so fierce, although he was\r\nonly very much amazed, that Jewel's smile faded. The corners of her\r\nlips drew down pitifully, and suddenly she slipped from her chair, and\r\nrunning to him threw her arms around his neck and buried her averted\r\nface, revealing two forlorn little flaxen pigtails devoid of ribbons.\r\n\r\n“What's this, Jewel?” he said quickly, fearfully embarrassed before his\r\nwondering audience. “This is very irregular, very irregular.” He dropped\r\nhis fork perforce, and his hand closed over the little arm across his\r\ncravat.\r\n\r\nJewel was trying to control a sob that struggled to escape, and saying\r\nover and over, as nearly as he could understand, something about God\r\nbeing Love.\r\n\r\n“Go right back to your chair now, like a good girl.”\r\n\r\n“Do you--love me?” whispered Jewel.\r\n\r\n“Yes--yes, I do.”\r\n\r\n“You spoke like”--a sob--“like hating.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, not at all,” rejoined Mr. Evringham quickly, “but I was\r\nvery much surprised, very.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I take her upstairs, sir?” asked Mrs. Forbes, nearly bursting\r\nwith the outrage of such an interruption to her employer's sacred\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n“No, she's going to sit right down in her chair and not make any\r\ntrouble. Don't you like those roses I brought you, Jewel?” he added\r\nawkwardly, hoping to make a diversion. He was successful. She lowered\r\nher face, a fleeting April smile flitting over it.\r\n\r\n“Did grandfather bring you those lovely roses?” asked Eloise.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham flashed her his first glance of approval for so quickly\r\ntaking the cue.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the child, her breath catching as she went back to her\r\nchair. “I seemed so sick when he went away this morning was the reason;\r\nso now I'm well again--they belong to everybody, don't they, grandpa?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham paused to consider a reply. He desired to be careful in\r\npublic not to draw upon himself that small catapult.\r\n\r\n“They belong to you still, Jewel. I never take back my presents,” he\r\nreturned at last.\r\n\r\n“And I think Mrs. Forbes was mistaken about the false pretends,” said\r\nthe child, swallowing and looking apologetically at the housekeeper,\r\n“because who would pretend such error as sickness, and of course you'd\r\nknow I didn't pretend.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” said Mr. Evringham. “Mrs. Forbes didn't mean that. The\r\nwhole thing seems like a dream now,” he added.\r\n\r\n“What else could it seem like?” returned Jewel, smiling faintly toward\r\nher grandfather with an air of having caught him napping.\r\n\r\n“Like reality,” he returned dryly.\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him, her smile fading.\r\n\r\nHe looked up apprehensively and cringed a little, not at all sure that\r\nthe next instant would not find the rose-leaf cheek next his, and a\r\nclose whisper driving cold chills down his back; but the child only\r\npaused a moment.\r\n\r\n“Reality is so much different from sin, disease, and death,” she said at\r\nlast, in a matter-of-fact manner. It was too much for Mrs. Evringham's\r\nrisibles. She laughed in spite of her daughter's reproachful glance.\r\n\r\n“How wonderful if true!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” returned Jewel soberly. “Even Anna Belle knows that; but\r\nI'm sure that you haven't learned anything about Christian Science, aunt\r\nMadge,” she added politely.\r\n\r\n“What makes you so sure?” returned Mrs. Evringham banteringly.\r\n\r\nJewel flushed with embarrassment and glanced at her grandfather\r\ninvoluntarily, but he was busy eating and evidently would not help her.\r\n\r\n“I'd rather not say,” replied the child at last, and her rejoinder\r\nincited her aunt to further merriment.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Madge doesn't laugh in a nice way,” thought Jewel. “It's even\r\npleasanter when she looks sorry.”\r\n\r\n“What is real then, Jewel?” asked Eloise gravely.\r\n\r\nThe child flashed upon her a sweet look.\r\n\r\n“Everything good and glad,” she answered.\r\n\r\nSomething rose in the girl's throat, and she pressed her lips together\r\nfor an instant.\r\n\r\n“You are happy to believe that,” she returned.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don't believe it,” replied Jewel. “It's one of the things I\r\n_know_. Mother says we only believe things when we aren't sure about\r\nthem. Mother knows such a lot of beautiful truth.”\r\n\r\nThe child looked at her cousin wistfully as she spoke. Eloise could\r\nscarcely retain her proud and nonchalant bearing beneath the blue eyes.\r\nThey seemed to see through to her wretchedness.\r\n\r\nShe did not look at Jewel again during dinner. At the close Mr.\r\nEvringham pushed his chair back.\r\n\r\n“I should like you to come with me into my study, Jewel, for a few\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\nThe child's face brightened, and she left the table with alacrity. Mr.\r\nEvringham stood back to allow his guests to pass out. They went on to\r\nthe drawing-room, where Mrs. Evringham's self-restraint was loosed.\r\n\r\n“The plot thickens, Eloise!” she said.\r\n\r\n“And we are not going away,” returned the girl.\r\n\r\n“Decidedly not,” declared her mother with emphasis.\r\n\r\n“There is no hope of our catching anything that Jewel has now,” went on\r\nEloise.\r\n\r\nHer mother glanced at her suspiciously. “What, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” returned the girl, shrugging her shoulder, “faith, hope, and\r\ncharity.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham laughed. “Indeed! Is the wind in that quarter? Then with\r\nthe Christian Science microbe in the house, there's no telling what may\r\nhappen to you. Something more serious than a fever, perhaps.” She nodded\r\nknowingly. “This sudden recovery looks very queer to me. I'd keep the\r\nchild in bed if I were in authority. Some diseases are so treacherous.\r\nThere's walking typhoid fever, for instance. She may have it for all we\r\nknow. I shall have a very serious talk with Dr. Ballard when he comes.”\r\n\r\nAn ironical smile flitted over the girl's lips as she drifted toward the\r\npiano. “I judge from the remarks at the table, that the less you say to\r\nDr. Ballard on the subject of to-day's experiences the better.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” indignantly. “I'm sure that child must have played some\r\npractical joke on him. I want to get to the bottom of it. What a strange\r\nlittle monkey she is! How long will father stand it? What did you think,\r\nEloise, when she swooped upon him so suddenly?”\r\n\r\n“I thought of just one sentence,” returned the girl. “'Perfect love\r\ncasteth out fear.'”\r\n\r\n“Why in the world should she love him?” protested Mrs. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“She would love us all if we would let her,” returned Eloise, the\r\nphrases of “Vogel als Prophete” beginning to ripple softly from beneath\r\nher fingers. “I saw it from the first. I felt it that first evening,\r\nwhen we behaved toward her like a couple of boors. Any one can see she\r\nhas never been snubbed, never neglected. She got out of the lap of love\r\nto come to this icebox. No wonder the change of temperature made her\r\nill!”\r\n\r\n“Why, Eloise, what has come over you? You never used to be disagreeable.\r\nIt's a good thing the child is amiable. It's the only thing left for a\r\nplain girl to be.”\r\n\r\n“No one will ever remember that she is plain,” remarked Eloise.\r\n\r\nHer mother raised her eyebrows doubtingly. “Perhaps your perceptions are\r\nso keen that you can explain how Jewel managed to telegraph to Chicago\r\nto-day,” she said. “It reminded me of Dooley's comments on Christian\r\nScience. Do you remember what he said about 'rejucin' a swellin' over a\r\nlong distance tillyphone'?”\r\n\r\n“I can't imagine how she managed it,” admitted Eloise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither could Mr. Evringham. He had taken Jewel into his study now\r\nwith the intention of finding out, deeming a secluded apartment more\r\ndesirable for catechism which might lay him liable to personal attack.\r\n\r\nAs they entered the library he turned on the light, and Jewel glanced\r\nabout with her usual alert and ready admiration.\r\n\r\n“Is this your own, own particular room, grandpa?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, where I keep all my books and papers.”\r\n\r\nThe child's eye suddenly lighted on the yellow chicken, and she looked\r\nup at Mr. Evringham with a pleased smile. He had forgotten the chicken,\r\nand took the seat before his desk, glancing vaguely about to see which\r\nchair would be least heavy and ponderous for his guest. She settled\r\nthe matter without any hesitation by jumping upon his knee. Jewel had a\r\nsubject on her mind which pressed heavily, and before her companion\r\nhad had time to do more than wink once or twice in his surprise, she\r\nproceeded to it.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, grandpa, I think it's hard for Mrs. Forbes to love people\r\nvery much,” she said in a lowered voice, as if perhaps the walls might\r\nhave ears. “I wanted to ask her yesterday morning if she didn't love me\r\nwhom she had seen, how could she love God whom she hadn't seen. Grandpa,\r\nwould you be willing to tie my bows?”\r\n\r\n“To tie”--repeated Mr. Evringham, and paused.\r\n\r\nThe child was gazing into his eyes earnestly. She put her hand into her\r\npocket and took out two long pieces of blue ribbon.\r\n\r\n“You see, you're my only real relation,” she explained, “and so I don't\r\nlike to ask anybody else.”\r\n\r\nThe startled look in her grandfather's face moved her to proceed\r\nencouragingly.\r\n\r\n“You tie your neckties just beautifully, grandpa; and Mrs. Forbes does\r\nher duty so _hard_, and she wants to have my hair cut off, to save\r\ntrouble.” Jewel put her hand up to one short pigtail protectingly.\r\n\r\n“And you don't want it cut off, eh?”\r\n\r\n“No; and mother wouldn't either. So it would be error, and I'm sure I\r\ncould learn to fix it better than I did to-night, if you would tie the\r\nbows. Just try one right now, grandpa.”\r\n\r\n“With the house full of women!” gasped Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“But none of them my real relatives,” replied Jewel, and she turned the\r\nback of her head to him, putting the ribbons in his hands.\r\n\r\nHis fingers fumbled at the task for a minute, and his breathing began to\r\nbe heavy.\r\n\r\n“Is it hard, grandpa?” she asked sympathetically. “You can do it.\r\nYou reflect intelligence.” Then in an instant, “Oh, I've thought of\r\nsomething.” She whisked about, took the ribbons and tied one tightly\r\naround the end of each braid, then ducking her forehead into his shirt\r\nfront, “Now put your arms around my neck and tie the bow just as if it\r\nwas on yourself.” Eureka! The thing was accomplished and Mrs. Forbes\r\noutwitted. The broker was rather pleased with himself, at the billowy\r\nappearance of the ribbon which covered such a multitude of sins in the\r\nway of bad parting and braiding. He took his handkerchief and wiped\r\nthe beads of perspiration from his brow, while Jewel regarded him with\r\nadmiring affection.\r\n\r\n“I knew you could do just _anything_, grandpa!” she said. “You see,”\r\n looking off at a mental vision of the housekeeper, “we could come in\r\nhere every morning for a minute before breakfast, and she'd never know,\r\nwould she?” The child lifted her shoulders and laughed softly with\r\npleasure at the plot.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham saw his opportunity to take the floor.\r\n\r\n“Now Jewel, I would like to have you explain what you meant by saying\r\nthat you telegraphed to Chicago to-day, when you didn't leave your bed.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him attentively. “Ezekiel took it for me,” she replied.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham unconsciously heaved a sigh of relief at this commonplace\r\ninformation. His knowledge of the claims of Christian Science was\r\nextremely vague, and he had feared being obliged to listen to a\r\ndeclaration of the use of some means of communication which would make\r\nMarconi's discoveries appear like clumsy makeshifts.\r\n\r\n“But I think, grandpa, perhaps you'd better not tell Mrs. Forbes.”\r\n\r\n“How did you manage to see Zeke?”\r\n\r\n“I asked his mother if he might come to see me before he took you to the\r\ntrain.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham pulled his mustache in amusement. “Did he pay for the\r\ntelegram?”\r\n\r\n“Why no, grandpa. I told you I had plenty of money.”\r\n\r\n“And you think that Mrs. Somebody in Chicago cured you?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not. God did.”\r\n\r\n“But she asked Him, eh?”\r\n\r\nJewel's innocent eyes looked directly into the quizzical ones. “It's\r\npretty hard for a little girl to teach you about it if you don't know,”\r\n she said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“I _don't_ know,” he replied, his mood altered by her tone, “but I\r\nshould like to know what you think about it. Your cure was a rather\r\nsurprising one to us all.”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you some of the things I know.”\r\n\r\n“Do so then.”\r\n\r\n“Well”--a pause--“there wasn't anything to cure, you see.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! You weren't ill then!”\r\n\r\n“No--o,” scornfully, “of course not. I knew it all the time, but it\r\nseemed so real to me, and so hot, I knew I'd have to have some one else\r\nhandle the claim for me.”\r\n\r\n“It certainly did seem rather real.” Mr. Evringham smiled.\r\n\r\nJewel saw that he did not in the least comprehend.\r\n\r\n“You know there isn't any devil, don't you, grandpa?” she asked\r\npatiently.\r\n\r\n“Well, sometimes I have my doubts.”\r\n\r\nThe little girl tried to discover by his eyes if he were in earnest.\r\n\r\n“If you believe there is, then you could believe that I was really\r\nsick; but if you believe there isn't, and that God created everybody and\r\neverything, then it is so easy to understand that I wasn't. Think of God\r\ncreating anything bad!”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham nodded vaguely. “When mother comes home she'll tell you\r\nabout it, if you want her to.” She sighed a little and abruptly changed\r\nthe subject. “Grandpa, are you going to be working at your desk?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for a while.”\r\n\r\n“Could I sit over at that table and write a letter while you're busy? I\r\nwouldn't speak.” She slipped down from his knee.\r\n\r\n“I don't know about your having ink. You're a rather small girl to be\r\nwriting letters.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, I'll take a pencil--because sometimes I move quickly and ink\r\ntips over.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so. I'm glad you realize that, else I should be afraid to have\r\nyou come to my study.”\r\n\r\n“You'd better not be afraid,” the child shook her head sagely, “because\r\nthat makes things happen.”\r\n\r\nHer grandfather regarded her curiously. This small Bible student, who\r\ncouldn't tie her own hair ribbons, was an increasing problem to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFAMILY AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nHe continued to watch the child furtively, while she made her\r\narrangements for writing. Finding that no chair in the room would bring\r\nher to a proper height for the table, she looked all about, and finally\r\nskipped over to the morocco lounge and tugged from it a pillow almost\r\ntoo heavy for her to carry; but she arrived with it at the chair,\r\nmuch to the amusement of Mr. Evringham, who affected absorption in\r\nhis papers, while he enjoyed the exhibition of the child's energy and\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n“She's the kind that 'makes old shears cut,' as my mother used to say,”\r\n he mused, and turning, the better to view the situation, he found Jewel\r\nmounted on her perch and watching him fixedly.\r\n\r\nShe looked relieved. “I didn't want to disturb you, grandpa, but may I\r\nask one question?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did I consult Dr. Ballard this afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I noticed,” returned Mr. Evringham; and Jewel suspected from\r\nhis expression that she had said something amusing.\r\n\r\n“Well, it was a word that sounded like consult that Mrs. Forbes said I\r\ndid.”\r\n\r\n“Insult, perhaps,” suggested Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes. How do you spell it, grandpa?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham told her, and added dryly, “That was rather too strong\r\nlanguage for Mrs. Forbes to apply to the fact.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the child. “I knew it was a hating word.” Then without\r\nfurther parley she squared her elbows on the table and bent over her\r\nsheet of paper.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what version of it she'll give her mother,” thought the\r\nbroker, rummaging vaguely in the pigeon holes of his desk. His labors\r\nfinally sifted down to the unearthing of a late novel from a drawer at\r\nhis right hand, and lowering a convenient, green-shaded electric light,\r\nhe lit his cigar, and was soon lost in the pages of the story.\r\n\r\nAt last he became conscious that the pencil at the table had ceased to\r\nmove, and lowering his book he looked up. His granddaughter had been\r\nwatching for this happy event, and she no sooner met his eyes than, with\r\na smile of satisfaction, she jumped from her morocco perch and brought\r\nhim a sheet of paper well and laboriously covered.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it isn't all spelled right,” she said. “I didn't want to\r\ndisturb you to ask; but will you please direct this to Dr. Ballard?”\r\n\r\n“To Dr. Ballard!” repeated Mr. Evringham. His curiosity impelled him.\r\n“Shall I see if it is spelled right?”\r\n\r\nJewel assenting, he read the following in a large and waving hand.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR BALUD--Mrs. Forbs felt bad because I did not take your\r\nMedsin. She said it was an insult. I want to tell you I did not meen an\r\nInsult. We can't help loving God beter than any body, but I love you and\r\nif I took any medsin I would rather take yours than any boddy's. Mrs.\r\nForbs says you will send a big Bill to Grandpa and that it was error to\r\nwaist it. Please send the Bill to me because I have Plenty of munny, and\r\nI shall love to pay you. You were very kind and did not put any thing on\r\nmy Tung.\r\n\r\nYour loving JEWEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham continued to look at the signature for a minute before he\r\nspoke. Jewel was leaning against his arm and reading with him. The last\r\nlines slanted deeply, there being barely room in the lower corner for\r\nthe writer's name.\r\n\r\n“I can't write very straight without lines,” she said.\r\n\r\n“You do very well indeed,” he returned. “About that bill, Jewel,” he\r\nadded after a moment. “Perhaps you would better let me pay it. I believe\r\nyou said you had three dollars, but even that won't last forever, you\r\nknow. You've spent some of it, too. How much, now?”\r\n\r\n“I've spent fifty cents.” Jewel cast a furtive look around at the\r\nchicken, “And, oh yes, fifty cents more for the telegram. How much do\r\nyou think Dr. Ballard's bill will be?”\r\n\r\n“I think it will take every cent you have left,” returned Mr. Evringham,\r\ngravely, curious to hear what his granddaughter would say in this\r\ndilemma.\r\n\r\nHer reply came promptly and even eagerly. “Well, that's all right,\r\nbecause Divine Love will send me more if I need it.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? How can you be sure?”\r\n\r\nJewel smiled at him affectionately. “Do you mean it grandpa?”\r\n\r\n“Why yes. I really want to know.”\r\n\r\n“Even after God sent you Essex Maid?” she asked incredulously.\r\n\r\n“You think the mare is the best thing in my possession, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Ye--es! Don't you?”\r\n\r\n“I believe I do.” As Mr. Evringham spoke, this kinship of taste induced\r\nhim to turn his face toward the one beside him. Instantly he found\r\nhimself kissed full on the lips, and while he was recovering from the\r\nshock, Jewel proceeded:--\r\n\r\n“God has given you so many things, grandpa, that's why it surprised me\r\nto have you look so sorry when I first came.” The child examined his\r\ncountenance critically. “I don't think you look so sorry as you used to.\r\nI know you must have lots of error to meet, and perhaps,” lowering her\r\nvoice to an extra gentleness, “perhaps you don't know how to remember\r\nevery minute that God is a very present help in trouble. Mother says\r\nthat even grown-up people are just finding out about it.”\r\n\r\nAs she paused Mr. Evringham hesitated, somewhat embarrassed under\r\nthe blue eyes. “We all have plenty to learn, I dare say,” he returned\r\nvaguely.\r\n\r\nHe had more than once wished that he had taken more notice of Harry's\r\nwife during his opportunity at the hotel. He had looked upon the\r\ninterview as a distasteful necessity to be disposed of as cursorily as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nHis son had married beneath him, some working girl probably, whose\r\nability to support herself had turned out to be a deliverance for\r\nher father-in-law when the ne'er-do-well husband shirked his\r\nresponsibilities; and Mr. Evringham had gone to the hotel that evening\r\nintending to make it clear that although he performed a favor for his\r\nson, there were no results to follow.\r\n\r\nHis granddaughter's fearlessness, courtesy, and affection had forced\r\nhim to wonder as to the mother who had fostered these qualities. He\r\nremembered the eloquence of his son's face when Harry expressed the wish\r\nthat he might know Julia, and a vague admiration and respect were being\r\nborn in the broker's heart for the deserted woman who had worked with\r\nhand and brain for her child--his grandchild was the way he put it--with\r\nsuch results as he saw.\r\n\r\nSome perception of what Harry's sensations must have been during the\r\nlast six months came to him as he sat there with the little girl's arm\r\nabout him. Harry had come home and discovered his child, his Jewel. A\r\nfrown gathered on the broker's brow as he realized the hours of vain\r\nregret his son must have suffered for those lost years of the child's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n“Served him right, served him perfectly right!”\r\n\r\n“What grandpa?”\r\n\r\nThe question made Mr. Evringham aware that the indignant words had been\r\nmuttered above his breath.\r\n\r\n“I was thinking of your father,” he replied. “Has he learned these\r\nthings that your mother has taught you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” with soft eagerness; “father is learning everything.” Jewel\r\nsaw her grandfather's frown and she lowered her voice almost to a\r\nwhisper. “Don't feel sorry about father, grandpa. He says he's the\r\nhappiest man in the world. Mother didn't find out about God till after\r\nfather had gone to California, or he wouldn't have gone; and for a long\r\ntime she didn't know where he was, and I was only beginning to walk\r\naround, so I couldn't help her; but when I got bigger I had father's\r\npicture, and we used to talk to it every day, and at last mother knew\r\nthat Divine Love would bring father back; and pretty soon he began\r\nto write to her, and he said he couldn't come home because he felt so\r\nsorry, and he was going to the war. So then mother and I prayed a great\r\ndeal every day, and we knew father would be taken care of. And then\r\nmother kept writing to him not to be sorry, because error was nothing\r\nand the child of God could always have his right place, and everything\r\nlike that, and at last the war was over and he came home.” Jewel paused.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham wondered what she was seeing with that far-away look.\r\n\r\nPresently she turned to him with the smile of irresistible\r\nsweetness--Harry's smile--and a surprising fullness came in the broker's\r\nthroat. “Father's just splendid,” she finished.\r\n\r\nHer grandfather was not wholly pleased with the verdict. He had gained a\r\ntaste for incense himself.\r\n\r\n“He has been at home over six months, I believe,” he returned.\r\n\r\n“Yes, all winter; and we have more _fun_!”\r\n\r\n“Your father is not a Christian Scientist, I presume,” remarked Mr.\r\nEvringham.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, he's learning to be. Of course he goes to church--”\r\n\r\n“He does, eh?” put in the broker, surprised.\r\n\r\n“Of course; and he studies the lesson with us every day. He had been\r\nsorry so much and so long, you know, mother said he was all ready; and\r\nbeside--beside”--Jewel hesitated and became silent.\r\n\r\n“Beside what?”\r\n\r\nShe began very softly and half reluctantly. “Father had a sickness two\r\nor three times when he first came home, and he was healed, and so he was\r\nvery grateful and wanted to know about God.”\r\n\r\n“H'm. I'm glad he was. I hope he will make your mother very happy after\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“He does.” The child lost her seriousness and laughed reminiscently.\r\n“Father and I have the _best_ times. Mothers says he's younger than I\r\nam.”\r\n\r\n“You miss him, eh?” Mr. Evringham half frowned into the fresh little\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I do,” with a sigh, “but it would be error to be sorry when I\r\ncould come to see you, grandpa.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham cogitated a minute on the probable loneliness of the last\r\nthree days, and began to wonder what this philosophy could be which\r\ngave practical help to a child of eight years. He was still holding the\r\nletter to Dr. Ballard in his hand.\r\n\r\n“I think I'll let you direct this yourself, Jewel,” he said. He rose and\r\nbrought the morocco cushion to his desk chair. “Sit up here and I will\r\ntell you the address.”\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, and Mr. Evringham watched the little fingers clenched around\r\nthe pen as she strove to resist its tendency to write down hill on the\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n“And you're quite sure that more money will be forthcoming when yours is\r\ngone, eh?” he asked when the feat was accomplished.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes; if I need it.”\r\n\r\n“How will it come, for instance?”\r\n\r\nShe looked up quickly. “I don't need to know that,” she replied.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham bit his lip. “That's unanswerable,” he thought, “and\r\nrather neat.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a knock sounded at the library door, and a moment\r\nafterward Mrs. Forbes presented herself.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Mr. Evringham. I'm afraid Julia has been in your way,\r\nstaying so long.”\r\n\r\n“No, Mrs. Forbes, thank you,” he returned. “She had a letter to write,\r\nand I have been reading.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. It is her bedtime now.” The housekeeper's tone was\r\ninexorable, and Jewel lifted her shoulders as she glanced up at her\r\ngrandfather, and again he found himself taken into a confidence which\r\nexcluded his excellent housekeeper. “It is better for us to yield,” said\r\nJewel's shoulders and mute lips. Before Mr. Evringham could suspect her\r\nintention, she had jumped up on the cushion nimbly as a squirrel, and\r\nhugging him in a business-like manner, kissed him twice.\r\n\r\n“Good-night, grandpa.”\r\n\r\n“Good-night, Jewel,” he returned, going to the length of patting her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nShe jumped down and ran to Mrs. Forbes. “You needn't come with me, you\r\nknow,” she said, holding up her face. Mrs. Forbes hesitated a moment.\r\nShe had not as yet recovered from this latest liberty taken with the\r\nhead of the house.\r\n\r\n“Let me feel of your hands, Julia.” She took them in hers and touched\r\nthe child's cheeks and forehead as well. “You seem to feel all right, do\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Yes'm.”\r\n\r\n“No soreness or pain anywhere?”\r\n\r\n“No'm. Good-night, Mrs. Forbes.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper stooped from her height and accepted the offered kiss.\r\n\r\n“Do you prefer to go alone, Jewel? Isn't it lonely for you?” asked Mr.\r\nEvringham.\r\n\r\n“No--o, grandpa! Anna Belle is up there.”\r\n\r\n“You're not afraid of the dark then?”\r\n\r\nJewel looked at the speaker, uncertain of his seriousness. He seemed in\r\nearnest, however. “The dark is easy to drive away in this house,” she\r\nreplied. “It is so interesting, just like a treatment. The room seems\r\nfull of darkness, error, and I just turn the switch,” she illustrated\r\nwith thumb and finger in the air, “and suddenly--there isn't any\r\ndarkness! It's all bright and happy, just like me to-day!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” returned Mr. Evringham, standing with his feet apart and his\r\narms folded. “Is that what the lady in Chicago did for you to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, grandpa,” Jewel nodded eagerly. She was so glad to have him\r\nunderstand. “She just turned the light, Truth, right into me.”\r\n\r\n“She prayed to the Creator to cure you, you mean.”\r\n\r\nJewel looked off. “No, not that,” she answered slowly, searching for\r\nwords to make her meaning plain. “God doesn't have to be begged to do\r\nanything, because He can't change, He is always the same, and always\r\nperfect, and always giving us everything good, and it's only for us--not\r\nto believe--in the things that seem to get in the way. I was believing\r\nthere was something in the way, and that lady knew there wasn't, and\r\nshe knew it so _well_ that the old dark fever couldn't stay. Nothing can\r\nstay that God doesn't make--not any longer than we let it cheat us.”\r\n\r\n“And she was a thousand miles away,” remarked Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“Why, grandpa,” returned Jewel, “there isn't any space in Spirit.” She\r\ngave a little sigh. “I'm real sorry you're too big to be let into the\r\nChristian Science Sunday-School.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes lips fell apart.\r\n\r\n“One moment more, Jewel,” said Mr. Evringham. “Mrs. Forbes was telling\r\nme of the gentleman who spoke to you on the trolley car yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” returned the child, smiling at the pleasing memory. “The\r\nChristian Scientist!”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think he is a Christian Scientist?” asked Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“I know he was. He had on the pin.” Jewel showed the one she wore, and\r\nher grandfather examined the little cross and crown curiously.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if it's possible,” he soliloquized aloud.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, grandpa, he is one, and if he's a friend of yours he can\r\nexplain to you so much better than a little girl can.”\r\n\r\nAfter the child had left the room Mr. Evringham and his housekeeper\r\nstood regarding one another. His usually unsmiling countenance was\r\nrelaxed. Mrs. Forbes observed his novel expression, but did not suspect\r\nthat the light twinkling in his deep-set eyes was partly due to the\r\nsight of her own pent-up emotion.\r\n\r\nHe hooked one thumb in his vest and balanced his eyeglasses in his other\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you think of her?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“I think, sir,” returned the housekeeper emphatically, “that if anybody\r\nbought that child for a fool he wouldn't get his money's worth.”\r\n\r\n“Even though she is a Scientist?” added Mr. Evringham, his mustache\r\ncurving in a smile.\r\n\r\n“She's too smart for me. I don't like children to be so smart. The idea\r\nof her setting up to teach you Mr. Evringham!”\r\n\r\n“That shouldn't be so surprising. I read a long time ago something about\r\ncertain things being concealed from the wise and prudent and revealed\r\nunto babes.”\r\n\r\n“Babes!” repeated Mrs. Forbes. “We've been the babes. If that young one\r\ncan lie in bed with a fever, and wind every one of us around her finger\r\nthe way she's done to-day, what can we expect when she's up and around?”\r\n\r\nThe broker laughed. “She's an Evringham, an Evringham!” he said.\r\n\r\n“You may laugh, sir, but what do you think of her wheedling me into\r\nsending Zeke up, and then getting him off on the sly with that telegram?\r\nI faced him down with it to-night, and Zeke isn't any good at fibbing.”\r\n\r\n“I'll be hanged if I don't think it was a pretty good thing for me,”\r\n rejoined Mr. Evringham, “and money in my pocket. It looked as if I was\r\nin for Ballard for a matter of weeks.”\r\n\r\n“But the--the--the audacity of it!” protested Mrs. Forbes. “What do you\r\nthink she said after you and Dr. Ballard had done downstairs? I tried to\r\nbring her to a sense of what she'd done, and all she answered was that\r\nshe had known that God would deliver her out of the snare of the fowler.\r\nNow I should like to ask you, Mr. Evringham,” added Mrs. Forbes in an\r\naccess of outraged virtue, “which of us three do you think she called\r\nthe fowler?”\r\n\r\n“Give it up, I'm sure,” returned the broker; “but I can imagine that we\r\nseemed three pretty determined giants for one small girl to outwit.”\r\n\r\n“She'd outwit a regiment, sir; and I don't see how you can permit it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham endeavored to compose his countenance. “We must allow her\r\nreligious liberty, I suppose, Mrs. Forbes. It's a matter of religion\r\nwith her--that is, we must allow it as long as she keeps well. If\r\nBallard had found her worse to-night, I assure you I should have\r\nconsigned all Christian Scientists to the bottom of the sea, and that\r\nlittle zealot would have taken her medicine from my own hand. All's well\r\nthat ends well, eh?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes had caught sight of the incongruous adornment of her\r\nemployer's desk.\r\n\r\nWith majestic strides she advanced upon the yellow chicken and swept it\r\ninto her apron. “Julia must be taught not to litter your room, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” returned the broker firmly, also advancing and\r\nholding out his hand. “That is my chicken.”\r\n\r\nSlowly Mrs. Forbes restored the confiscated property, and Mr. Evringham\r\nexamined it carefully to see that it was intact, and then set it\r\ncarefully on his desk.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes recalled the confectioner's window. “She must have bought\r\nthat chicken when my back was turned!” she thought. “That young one\r\ncould have given points to Napoleon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA RAINY MORNING\r\n\r\nThe next morning it rained so heavily that Mr. Evringham was obliged to\r\nforego his ride. Wet weather was an unmixed ill to him. It not only\r\nmade riding and golf miserable, but it reminded him that rheumatism was\r\ngetting a grip on one of his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“It is disgusting, perfectly disgusting to grow old,” he muttered as he\r\ndescended the broad staircase. On the lower landing Jewel rose up out\r\nof the dusk, where she had been sitting near the beautiful clock. Her\r\nbright little face shone up at him like a sunbeam.\r\n\r\n“You didn't expect to see me, grandpa, did you?” she asked, and as it\r\ndid not even occur to him to stoop his head to her, she seized his hand\r\nand kissed it as they went on down the stairs.\r\n\r\n“I was so disappointed because it rained so hard. I was going to see you\r\nride.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Beastly weather,” assented Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“But the flowers and trees want a drink, don't they?”\r\n\r\n“'M. I suppose so.”\r\n\r\n“And the brook will be prettier than ever.”\r\n\r\n“'M. See that you keep out of it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will, grandpa; and I thought the first thing this morning, I'll\r\nwear my rubbers all day. I was so afraid I might forget I put them right\r\non to make sure.”\r\n\r\nThey had reached the hall, and Jewel exhibited her feet encased in the\r\nroomy storm rubbers.\r\n\r\n“Great Scott, child!” ejaculated Mr. Evringham, viewing the shiny\r\novershoes. “What size are your feet?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know,” returned the little girl, “but I only have to scuff\r\nsome, and then they'll stay on. Mrs. Forbes said I'd grow to them.”\r\n\r\n“So you will, I should think, if you're going to wear them in the house\r\nas well as out.” It was against Mr. Evringham's principles to smile\r\nbefore breakfast, at all events at any one except Essex Maid; but the\r\nlarge, shiny overshoes that looked like overgrown beetles, and Jewel's\r\noptimistic determination to make him happy, even offset his painful arm.\r\n\r\n“The house doesn't leak anywhere,” he said. “I think it will be safe for\r\nyou to take them off until after breakfast.”\r\n\r\nJewel lifted her shoulders and looked up at him with the glance he knew.\r\n\r\n“Unless we're going out to the stable,” she said suggestively.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment. “Very well,” he returned. “Let us go to the\r\nstable.”\r\n\r\n“But first we must tie the ribbons,” she said with a joyous chuckle.\r\nShe would have skipped but for the rubbers. As it was, she proceeded\r\ncircumspectly to the library, drawing the broker by the hand. “I want\r\nyou to see, grandpa, if you don't think I made my parting real straight\r\nthis morning,” she said as she softly closed the door.\r\n\r\n“Gently on my arm, Jewel,” he remonstrated, wincing as she returned,\r\nflinging her energetic little body against him. “I have the rheumatism\r\nlike the devil--pardon me.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him suddenly, wondering and wistful. “Oh, have you?” she\r\nreturned sympathetically. “But it is only like the devil, grandpa,” she\r\nadded hopefully, “and you know there isn't any devil.”\r\n\r\n“I can't discuss theology before breakfast,” he returned briefly.\r\n\r\n“Dear grandpa, you shan't have a single pain!” She held her head back\r\nand looked at him lovingly.\r\n\r\n“Very likely not, when I've begun playing the harp. Now where are those\r\ncon--those ribbons?”\r\n\r\nJewel's eyes and lips grew suddenly serious and doubtful, and he\r\nobserved the change.\r\n\r\n“Yes, your hair ribbons, you know,” he added hastily and with an attempt\r\nat geniality.\r\n\r\n“Not if you don't like to, grandpa.”\r\n\r\n“I love to,” he protested. “I've been looking forward to it all the\r\nmorning. I thought 'never mind if I can't go riding, I can tie Jewel's\r\nhair ribbons.'”\r\n\r\nThe child laughed a little, even though her companion did not. “Oh\r\ngrandpa, you're such a joker,” she said; “just like father.”\r\n\r\nBut he saw that she doubted his mood, and the toe of one of the\r\novershoes was boring into the carpet as she stood where she had\r\nwithdrawn from him.\r\n\r\n“Let us see if you parted your hair better,” he said in a different and\r\ngentler tone, and instantly the flaxen head was bent before him, and\r\nJewel felt in her pocket for the ribbons. He had not the heart to say\r\nwhat he thought; namely, that her parting looked as though a saw had\r\nbeen substituted for a comb.\r\n\r\n“Very well, very well,” he said kindly.\r\n\r\nWhen the ribbons were at last tied, the two proceeded to the\r\ndining-room. Here an open fire of logs furnished the cheerful light that\r\nwas lacking outside. The morning paper hung over the back of a chair,\r\nwarming before the blaze.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes entered from the butler's pantry and looked surprised.\r\n“I didn't expect you down for half an hour yet, sir. Shall I hurry\r\nbreakfast?”\r\n\r\n“No; I'm going to take Jewel to the stable.” Mr. Evringham stopped and\r\ntook a few lumps of sugar from the bowl.\r\n\r\n“Julia, where are your rubbers?” asked the housekeeper.\r\n\r\n“On,” said the child, lifting her foot.\r\n\r\n“I only hope they'll stay there,” remarked her grandfather. “I think,\r\nMrs. Forbes, you must buy shoes as I've heard that Chinamen do,--the\r\nlargest they can get for the money.”\r\n\r\nHe disappeared with his happy little companion, and the housekeeper\r\nlooked after them disapprovingly.\r\n\r\n“They're both going out bareheaded,” she mused. “I'd like to bet--I\r\nwould bet anything that she asked him to take her. He never even stopped\r\nto look at the paper. He's just putty in her hands, that's what he is,\r\nputty; and she's been here three days.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham's apprehensions proved to have foundation. Halfway to\r\nthe barn Jewel stepped in a bit of sticky mud and left one rubber. Her\r\ncompanion did not stop to let her get it, but picking her up under his\r\nwell arm, strode on to the barn, where they appeared to the astonished\r\nZeke.\r\n\r\nJewel was laughing in high glee. She was used to being caught up in a\r\nstrong arm and run with.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham shook the drops from his head. “Get Jewel's rubber please,\r\nZeke,” he said, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I was Cinderella,” cried the child gayly. “That's my glass slipper out\r\nthere in the mud.”\r\n\r\nZeke would have liked to joke with her, but that was an impossibility in\r\nthe august presence. He cast a curious glance at the little girl as\r\nhe left the barn. He had received his mother's version of yesterday's\r\nexperience. “Well, it looks to me as if there was something\r\nthose Christian Science folks know that the rest of us don't,” he\r\nsoliloquized. “I saw her with my own eyes, and felt her with my own\r\nhands. Mother says children get up from anything twice as quick as grown\r\nfolks, but I don't know.”\r\n\r\n“Don't you love a stable, grandpa?” exclaimed Jewel. “Oh, I'm too happy\r\nto scuff,” and she kicked off the other rubber. Even while she spoke\r\nEssex Maid looked around and whinnied at sight of her master.\r\n\r\n“She knows you, she knows you,” cried the little girl joyously, hopping\r\nup and down.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Mr. Evringham, holding out his hand to the delighted\r\nchild and leading her into the stall. The mare rubbed her nose against\r\nhim. “We couldn't get out this morning, eh, girl?” said the broker,\r\ncaressing her neck, while Jewel smoothed the bright coat as high as she\r\ncould reach. Her grandfather lifted her in his arms. “Here, my maid,\r\nhere's a new friend for you. In my pocket, Jewel.”\r\n\r\nThe child took out the lumps of sugar one by one, and Essex Maid ate\r\nthem from the little hand, touching it gently with her velvet lips. Zeke\r\ncame in and whistled softly as he glanced at the group in the stall.\r\n\r\n“Whew,” he mused. “He's letting her feed the Maid. I guess she can put\r\nher shoes in _his_ trunk all right.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham set Jewel on the mare's back and she smoothed the bright\r\nmane and patted the beautiful creature.\r\n\r\n“I'd like to gallop off now over the whole country,” she said, her face\r\nglowing.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn't be surprised either if you could do it bareback,” returned\r\nMr. Evringham; “but you must never come into either of the stalls\r\nwithout me. You understand, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, grandpa. I'm glad you told me though, because I guess I should\r\nhave.” The child gave a quick, unconscious sigh.\r\n\r\n“Well we'd better go in now.”\r\n\r\n“How kind you are to me,” said the child gratefully, as she slid off the\r\nhorse's back with her arms around her grandfather's neck.\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten his rheumatic shoulder for the time.\r\n\r\n“You can bring those rubbers in later,” he said to Zeke, and so carried\r\nJewel out of the barn, through the rain, and into the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes watched the entrance. “Breakfast is served, sir,” she said\r\nwith dignity. She thought her employer should have worn a hat.\r\n\r\nJewel was not offered eggs this morning. Instead she had, after her\r\nfruit and oatmeal, a slice of ham and a baked potato.\r\n\r\nHer roses were fresh this morning and opening in the warmth of the fire,\r\nbut Mr. Evringham's eyes were caught by a mass of American Beauties\r\nwhich stood in an alcove close to the window.\r\n\r\n“Where did those come from?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“They belong to Miss Eloise,” replied Mrs. Forbes. “She asked me to take\r\ncare of them for her.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! Ballard again, I suppose,” remarked the broker.\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” responded Mrs. Forbes devoutly.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham had spoken to himself, and he glanced up from his paper,\r\nsurprised by the prompt fervor of the reply. The housekeeper looked\r\nnon-committal, but her meaning dawned upon him, and he smiled slightly\r\nas he returned to the news of the day.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Ballard must love Cousin Eloise very much,” said Jewel, mashing her\r\npotato. “He sent her a splendid box of candy, too.”\r\n\r\nShe addressed her remark to Mrs. Forbes, and in a low tone, in order not\r\nto disturb her grandfather's reading.\r\n\r\n“Any girl can get candy and flowers and love, if she's only pretty\r\nenough,” returned Mrs. Forbes; “but she mustn't forget to be pretty.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker's tone appealed to Jewel as signifying a grievance. She\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\n“Why, somebody married you, Mrs. Forbes,” she said kindly.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham's paper hid a face which suddenly contorted, but the\r\nhousekeeper's quick-glancing eyes could not see a telltale motion.\r\n\r\nShe gave a hard little laugh. “You think there's hope for you then, do\r\nyou?” she returned.\r\n\r\n“I guess I'm not going to be married,” replied Jewel. “Father says I'm\r\ngoing to be his bachelor maid when I grow up.”\r\n\r\n“Shouldn't wonder if you were,” said Mrs. Forbes dryly.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the American Beauties and the beribboned bonbon box was\r\ntaking her coffee as usual in bed. This luxurious habit had never been\r\nhers until she came to Bel-Air; but it was her mother's custom, and\r\nrather than undergo a tete-a-tete breakfast with her host, she had\r\nadopted it.\r\n\r\nNow she had made her toilet deliberately. There was nothing to hurry\r\nfor. Her mother's voice came in detached sentences and questions from\r\nthe next room.\r\n\r\n“Dear me, this rain is too trying, Eloise! Didn't you have some\r\nengagement with Dr. Ballard to-day?”\r\n\r\n“He thought he could get off for some golf this afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“What a disappointment for the dear fellow,” feelingly. “He has so\r\nlittle time to himself!”\r\n\r\nEloise gave a most unsympathetic laugh. “More than he wishes he had, I\r\nfancy,” she returned.\r\n\r\nShe came finally in her white negligee into her mother's room. Mrs.\r\nEvringham was still in bed. Her eyeglasses were on and she regarded her\r\ndaughter critically as she came in sight. She had begun to look upon her\r\nas mistress of the fine old Ballard place on Mountain Avenue, and\r\nthe setting was very much to her mind. The girl sauntered over to the\r\nwindow, and taking a low seat, leaned her head against the woodwork,\r\nembowered in the lace curtains.\r\n\r\n“How it does come down!” said Mrs. Evringham fretfully. “And I lack\r\njust a little of that lace braid, or I could finish your yoke. I suppose\r\nForbes would think it was a dreadful thing if I asked her to let Zeke\r\nget it for me.”\r\n\r\n“Don't ask anything,” returned Eloise.\r\n\r\n“When you are in your own home!” sighed Mrs. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“Don't, mother. It's indecent!”\r\n\r\n“If you would only reassure me, my child, so I wouldn't have to undergo\r\nsuch moments of anxiety as I do.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you have no mercy!” exclaimed the girl; and when she used that tone\r\nher mother usually became tearful. She did now.\r\n\r\n“You act as if you weren't a perfect treasure, Eloise--as if I didn't\r\nconsider you a treasure for a prince of the realm!”\r\n\r\nA knock at the door heralded Sarah's arrival for the tray, and Mrs.\r\nEvringham hastily wiped her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you can take the things,” she said as the maid approached. “I\r\ncan't tip you as I should, Sarah. I'm going to get you something pretty\r\nthe next time I go to New York.”\r\n\r\nSarah had heard this before.\r\n\r\n“And if you know of any one going to the village this morning, I want a\r\npiece of lace braid. Have you heard how Miss Julia is?”\r\n\r\n“She was down at breakfast, ma'am, and Mr. Evringham had her out to the\r\nstable to see Essex Maid.”\r\n\r\n“He did? In the rain? How very imprudent!”\r\n\r\nAfter Sarah had departed with her burden, Mrs. Evringham took off her\r\neyeglasses.\r\n\r\n“There, Eloise, you heard that? It's just as I thought. He is taking a\r\nfancy to her.”\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled without turning her head. “Oh no, that wasn't your\r\nprophecy, mother. You said she was too plain to have a chance with our\r\nfastidious host.”\r\n\r\n“Well, didn't she look forlorn last night at the dinner table?” demanded\r\nMrs. Evringham, a challenge in her voice.\r\n\r\n“Indeed she did, the poor baby. She looked exactly as if she had two\r\nfemale relatives in the house, neither of whom would lift a finger to\r\nhelp her, even though she was just off a sick bed. The same relatives\r\ndon't know this minute how or where she spent the evening.”\r\n\r\n“I felt very glad she was content somewhere away from the drawing-room,”\r\n returned Mrs. Evringham practically. “You know we expected Dr. Ballard\r\nup to the moment the roses arrived, and from all I gathered at the\r\ndinner table, it would have been awkward enough for him to walk in upon\r\nthat child. Besides, I don't see why you use that tone with me. It has\r\nbeen your own choice to let her paddle her own canoe, and you've had an\r\nobject lesson now that I hope you won't forget. You wouldn't believe me\r\nwhen I begged you to exert yourself for your grandfather, and now you\r\nsee even that plain little thing could get on with him just because she\r\ndared take him by storm. She has about everything in her disfavor. The\r\nchild of a common working woman, with no beauty, and a little crank of\r\na Christian Scientist into the bargain, and yet now see! He took her\r\nout to the stable to see Essex Maid! I never knew you contradictory and\r\ndisagreeable until lately, Eloise. You even act like a stick with Dr.\r\nBallard just to be perverse.” Mrs. Evringham flounced over in bed, with\r\nher back to the white negligee.\r\n\r\nEloise had seen what she had been watching for. Her grandfather had\r\ndriven away to the station, so she arose and came over to the foot of\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n“I know I'm irritable, mother,” she said repentantly. “The idleness and\r\nuselessness of my life have grated on me until I know I'm not fit to\r\nlive with. If I had had any of the training of a society girl, I could\r\nbear it better; but papa kept my head full of school,--for which I bless\r\nhim,--and now that the dream of college is hopeless, and that the\r\nonly profession you wish for me is marriage, I dread to wake up in the\r\nmornings.”\r\n\r\nThe young voice was unsteady.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham heaved a long sigh. “Give me patience!” she murmured,\r\nthen added mentally, “It can't be many days, and she won't refuse him.”\r\n\r\n“Go down to the piano and play yourself good-natured,” she returned.\r\n“Then come up and we'll go on with that charming story. It quite\r\nrefreshed me to read of that coming-out ball. It was so like my own.”\r\n\r\nEloise, her lips set in a sad curve, rose and left the room. Once in the\r\nhall, she paused for a minute. Then instead of descending the stairs,\r\nshe ran noiselessly up the next flight. The rain was pelting steadily\r\non the dome of golden glass through which light fell to the halls. She\r\nstole, as she had done yesterday, to the door of Jewel's room.\r\n\r\nAgain as yesterday she heard a voice, but this time it was singing. The\r\ntones were very sweet, surprisingly strong and firm to proceed from lips\r\nwhich always spoke so gently. The door was not quite closed, and Eloise\r\npressed her ear to the crack. Thus she could easily hear the words of\r\nJewel's song:--\r\n\r\n     “And o'er the earth's troubled, angry sea\r\n     I see Christ walk;\r\n     And come to me, and tenderly,\r\n     Divinely, talk.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn stopped for a minute, and the child appeared to be conversing\r\nwith some one.\r\n\r\nEloise waited, openly, eagerly listening, hoping the singer would\r\nresume. Something in those unexpected words in the sweet child voice\r\nstirred her. Presently Jewel sang on:--\r\n\r\n     “From tired joy, and grief afar,\r\n     And nearer Thee,\r\n     Father, where Thine own children are\r\n     I love to be!”\r\n\r\nThe lump that rose in the listener's throat forced a moisture into her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“I never could hear a child sing without crying,” she said to herself in\r\nexcuse, as she leaned her forehead on her hand against the jamb of the\r\ndoor and waited for the strange stir at her heart to quiet.\r\n\r\nThe house was still. The rain swept against the panes, and tears stole\r\nfrom under the girl's long lashes--tears for her empty, vapid life, for\r\nthe hopelessness of the future, for the humiliations of the present, for\r\nthe lack of a love that should be without self-interest.\r\n\r\n“I like that verse, Anna Belle,” said the voice within. “Let's sing that\r\nagain,” and the hymn welled forth:--\r\n\r\n     “From tired joy, and grief afar,\r\n     And nearer Thee,\r\n     Father, where Thine own children are\r\n     I love to be!”\r\n\r\n“Is there a haven?” thought the swelling, listening heart outside. “Is\r\nthere a place far alike from tired joy and grief?”\r\n\r\n“'Father, where Thine own children are,'” quoted Jewel. “We know where\r\na lot of them are, don't we, Anna Belle, and we do love to be with\r\nthem.” A pause, and a light sigh, which did not reach the listener. “But\r\nwe're at grandpa's now,” finished the child's voice.\r\n\r\nEloise's breaths came long and deep drawn, and she stood motionless, her\r\neyes hidden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST LESSON\r\n\r\nJewel looked up as she heard a knock. Sarah had made the bed and gone.\r\nWho could this be?\r\n\r\nAt her “Come in,” Eloise entered the room. The child's face brightened\r\nquestioningly. She rose and gazed at the enchanted maiden, very lovely\r\nin the wrapper of white silk, open at the throat, and with little\r\nbillows of lace cascading down to the toes of her white Turkish\r\nslippers.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, cousin Eloise,” said the child, waiting for the message\r\nor order which she supposed to be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning.” The girl cast a comprehensive glance around the rather\r\nbare room. Her eyes bore no traces of the tears so recently shed, but\r\nher face was sad. “I heard you singing,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Did I disturb anybody?” asked the child quickly.\r\n\r\n“No. It is nice to be like the birds that sing in the rain.”\r\n\r\n“Like the robin out there,” returned Jewel, relieved. “Did you hear\r\nhim?” She ran to the window and threw it open, listening a minute. “No,\r\nhe has gone.”\r\n\r\n“You said you would show me your doll,” went on Eloise when the window\r\nwas closed again.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” returned Jewel pleased, “did you come to see Anna Belle? She's\r\nright here. We were just going to have the lesson.” She took the doll\r\nfrom the depths of a big chair and held her up with motherly pride.\r\n“Would you--won't you sit down a minute?”\r\n\r\nTo her great satisfaction, her beautiful visitor condescended to take\r\nthe chair Anna Belle had vacated, and held out her white, ringless hands\r\nfor the doll.\r\n\r\n“How neatly her clothes are made,” said the girl, examining Anna Belle's\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my mother made her all new ones when she knew she was going to\r\nEurope, so that she would be neat and not mortify me. Would you like to\r\nsee her clothes?” eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I should.”\r\n\r\nJewel brought them, her quick little fingers turning them back and\r\nforth, exhibiting the tiny buttonholes and buttons, and chattering\r\nexplanations of their good points.\r\n\r\n“It was a great deal for your mother to do all this, when she is such a\r\nbusy woman,” said Eloise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, she did it evenings, and then surprised me just when we were\r\ncoming away. Wasn't it lovely?”\r\n\r\n“Very.”\r\n\r\n“I love prettiness,” said the child. As she spoke she regarded the grave\r\nface beside her. “When I first noticed that my nose wasn't nice, and\r\nneither were my eyes, I almost cried.”\r\n\r\nEloise looked up at her, at a loss for a reply.\r\n\r\n“But then I remembered that of course God never made anything that\r\nwasn't perfectly beautiful, so I knew that it would come right some\r\ntime, and I asked mother when she thought it would.”\r\n\r\n“What did she say?” returned Eloise, wondering at this original\r\noptimism.\r\n\r\n“She said we could never tell how soon anything would come right to our\r\nsense, but so long as we knew that Creation was perfect and beautiful,\r\nwe could be patient about everything--big things and little things; and\r\nthen I remember how she talked to me about being careful never to pity\r\nmyself.” Jewel gave her head a little serious shake. “You know it's very\r\nbad error to pity yourself, no matter what kind of a nose you have.”\r\n\r\nEloise had sunk back in the large chair and was attentively watching\r\nthe child standing beside her, while she still held Anna Belle. She had\r\nnever before held converse with a Christian Scientist, but her state of\r\nmind precluded the perception of a humorous side to anything.\r\n\r\n“Wrong to pity yourself no matter what happens?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes--because--because--” Jewel looked off. She knew that it was error,\r\nbut it was hard to explain why to the lovely grown-up cousin who was so\r\nstrangely sorry. “Well, you see,” she added after the moment's thought,\r\n“it isn't having faith in God, it isn't knowing that you're His child,\r\nand that He takes care of you.”\r\n\r\n“No, I suppose not; but I have never learned how to know that, Jewel.”\r\n\r\n“I know you haven't,” returned the little girl, and she slipped her hand\r\ntoward her cousin's. The girl met it halfway and held it close. “Since\r\nI've seen you,” Jewel went on slowly, “I know that prettiness isn't\r\nenough to make a person happy--nor all your lovely clothes--nor having\r\npeople fond of you and sending you presents--nor making the sweetest\r\nmusic; but you can be happy, cousin Eloise, unless you're doing wrong.”\r\n\r\n“I am doing wrong, but I can't help it.” The girl took her supporting\r\nhand from the doll and pressed it to her eyes a second before dropping\r\nit. “What were you doing when I came in?”\r\n\r\n“I was just going to get the lesson.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do you go on with your studies? Perhaps I can help you better than\r\nAnna Belle.”\r\n\r\n“Would you cousin Eloise?” Jewel flushed with pleasure. “Some of the\r\nwords are so long. I thought I'd ask grandpa to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn't you wish to come to me?” questioned Eloise, well knowing\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nThe little girl looked a trifle embarrassed. “I didn't want to trouble\r\nyou. Of course you aren't my real relations,” she said modestly.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember that, too!” exclaimed Eloise.\r\n\r\nJewel started at the hurt voice. “Would you like to be?” she asked\r\nearnestly. “I wish you were, because”--she hesitated and smiled with her\r\nhead a little on the side, “because I might look more like you.”\r\n\r\nThe gravity of Eloise's lips remained unbroken. “I want you to promise\r\nme something, Jewel. I want you to promise not to tell your grandfather\r\nthat I have been with you to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Why? He'd be glad I was happy.”\r\n\r\n“I have a reason. I will help you with your studies every day if you\r\nwon't tell him.”\r\n\r\n“I might without meaning to,” rejoined the child, her alert little mind\r\nbusy with the new problem suddenly presented to it.\r\n\r\n“I will make a rainbow scarf for Anna Belle if you will never speak of\r\nme to your grandfather.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you say my grandfather? He's yours, too.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. Didn't you just say I was not your real relation?”\r\n\r\n“Oh but, cousin Eloise,” Jewel was sure of the hurt now, though the why\r\nor wherefore was a mystery, “of course he wishes you were.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no he doesn't.” The answer came quick and sharp, and the child\r\nreviewed mentally her own observations of the household. Her heart\r\nswelled with the desire to help.\r\n\r\n“Now, cousin Eloise,” her breath came a little faster with the thronging\r\nthoughts for which her vocabulary was insufficient, “error does try\r\nto cheat people so. Just think how kind you were inside all the time,\r\nthough you wouldn't smile at me. You're willing to make Anna Belle a\r\nscarf. I called you the enchanted maiden, because you were too sorry\r\nto try to make people happy, and now grandpa's just like that; he's\r\nenchanted, too, if he doesn't make you happy, because he's just as\r\n_kind_ inside, oh, just as _kind_ as he can be.”\r\n\r\n“He likes you,” returned Eloise.\r\n\r\nJewel regarded her for a silent moment. “I noticed when I came,” she\r\nsaid at last, apologetically, “that nobody here seemed to love one\r\nanother; and the house was so grand and the people were so beautiful\r\nthat I couldn't understand; and I called it Castle Discord.”\r\n\r\nEloise gave a little exclamation. “I call it the icebox,” she returned.\r\n\r\nJewel's face lighted. “That's it, that's all it is,” she said eagerly.\r\n“It's easy to melt ice. Love melts everything.”\r\n\r\n“It's pretty slow work sometimes,” said Eloise.\r\n\r\n“Then you have to put on more love. That's all. Have you”--the child\r\nasked the question a little timidly, “have you put on much love to\r\ngrandpa?”\r\n\r\n“Why should I love him?” asked Eloise. “He doesn't love me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear,” said Jewel. After a minute's thought her face brightened. “I\r\nguess I'll show you my dotted letter.”\r\n\r\nShe ran to the closet where hung her dotted challie dress and took from\r\nthe pocket the message that had come to her the evening of her arrival.\r\n“My mother put a letter into all my pockets for a happy surprise; and\r\nthis one came the first night, when I was feeling all sorry and alone,\r\nand it comforted me. Perhaps it will comfort you.”\r\n\r\nShe put the paper into the girl's hand, and Eloise read it. She turned\r\nit over and read it a second time.\r\n\r\nJewel stood beside her chair watching, and seeing that her cousin seemed\r\ninterested, she ran and brought her little wrapper. “Perhaps you'd like\r\nto see this one too,” she said feeling in the pocket for the second\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nEloise accepted and read it. Every word of the two notes came to the\r\nmind of the young girl as suggestions from another planet, so foreign\r\nwere they to any instruction or advice that had ever fallen to her lot.\r\n\r\nShe gave a slight exclamation as she finished. “Is your mother a saint?”\r\n she asked, looking up suddenly.\r\n\r\n“No,” returned Jewel innocently. “She's a Christian Scientist.”\r\n\r\nEloise suddenly put out her hand, and drawing Jewel to her, hid her\r\nforehead on the child's breast.\r\n\r\n“I wish you were older,” she said.\r\n\r\nJewel put her little hands on the shining waves of hair she had admired\r\nfrom afar. “I wish my mother was here,” she answered. “Did you like\r\nthose things mother said?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes; but they're from heaven, and I'm in the other place,” replied\r\nEloise disconsolately.\r\n\r\n“Then let's look in another pocket!” exclaimed Jewel. “I'll look in my\r\nbest dress. Perhaps she'd put the best one there.”\r\n\r\nThe girl lifted her head, and the child went eagerly to the closet,\r\ncoming back with a folded paper. “We'll read it together. You read it\r\nout loud, and I'll look over your shoulder.”\r\n\r\nThe rain slanted against the window in gusts as the two heads bent above\r\nthe paper. Eloise read:--\r\n\r\n“Mother is thinking of you, little daughter, every day and every night,\r\nand the thing she hopes the most is, that you never let the day go\r\nby without studying the lesson. The words may be hard sometimes, but\r\nperhaps some one will read it with you, and if they do not, then you go\r\non trying your best, and you will learn more and more all the time; for\r\ntruth will shine into your thought and help you. Grandpa will give\r\nyou plenty of bread and butter, but you must remember that Spirit,\r\nnot matter, satisfieth. You would starve without the Bible and the\r\ntext-book, and very soon the joy would go out of everything. Give my\r\nlove to Anna Belle, and tell her not to go out to play any day until you\r\nhave read the lesson.”\r\n\r\n“Your mother speaks as if you learned Christian Science out of the\r\nBible,” said Eloise.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” returned Jewel.\r\n\r\n“I thought a woman got it up,” said the girl. “I thought your church\r\nworshipped her.”\r\n\r\nThe child smiled at the phrase. “You know Christ was the first one.\r\nThat's why we call ourselves that. We couldn't be Christian Scientists\r\nif we worshipped any one but God,” she answered. “Of course we love Mrs.\r\nEddy. Just think how good and unselfish a person has to be before they\r\ncan hear God's teaching. He showed her how to remind people of the\r\nthings that Christ taught, and how to get rid of their sins and\r\nsickness. We love her dearly for helping people so much, and shouldn't\r\nyou think everybody would? But they don't. Some people think hating\r\nthoughts about her, just as if she was teaching bad things instead of\r\ngood ones. Mother says it reminds her of what the Saviour said, 'For\r\nwhich of these works do ye stone me?'”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but you see,” returned Eloise, “Christian Scientists let people die\r\nsometimes without a doctor.”\r\n\r\n“But lots of people they do cure are the ones doctors said would have to\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“I know they claim that.”\r\n\r\n“And such a lot of people pass on while doctors are taking care of them\r\nI wonder why it makes everybody so angry when a Scientist goes without\r\nany.”\r\n\r\nEloise smiled faintly as she shook her head. “It is more respectable to\r\ndie with a doctor at your side,” she returned.\r\n\r\n“Are you really willing to help me with the lesson, cousin Eloise? If\r\nyou are, it would be nice if you would get your Bible too.”\r\n\r\nThe girl looked embarrassed. “I haven't any.”\r\n\r\n“Well, your mother's would do just as well,” said Jewel politely.\r\n\r\n“She hasn't any--here, I'm sure.”\r\n\r\nThe little girl stood very still a moment. “No wonder they're sorry,”\r\n she thought.\r\n\r\n“All right. We can both look over one,” she answered, and going to the\r\ndresser she brought her books.\r\n\r\n“Was this the study you meant?” asked Eloise, looking at the three books\r\ncuriously. “I thought I was offering to help you with something I knew\r\nabout. I used to learn verses out of the Bible when I was a little girl\r\nin Sunday-school. I don't know anything about it now.”\r\n\r\n“But you can read everything, the big words and all,” replied Jewel. “I\r\nwish I could.”\r\n\r\nEloise saw that this reply was designed to minister to her self-respect.\r\nShe took up the small black book lying with the Bible. “What is this?”\r\n\r\n“That is 'Science and Health,' that Mrs. Eddy wrote to explain to us\r\nwhat the Bible means; and this other one is to tell us where to pick out\r\nthe places for the day's lesson.” Jewel pulled up a chair, and seating\r\nherself, turned over the leaves of the Quarterly briskly until she found\r\nthe right date.\r\n\r\n“Please find Zechariah, cousin Eloise.”\r\n\r\n“What's that?” asked the girl helplessly.\r\n\r\n“It's in the Old Testament. Would you rather I'd find them? All right,\r\nthen you can take 'Science and Health' and find that part.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it's easy, for I'm awfully stupid, Jewel.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it's very easy. You'll see.” The child found the chapter and verse\r\nin the Bible and read, with her finger on the line. Eloise looked over\r\nand read with her. Thus they went through all the verses for the day,\r\nthen Jewel began to give the page and line to be read in the text-book.\r\n\r\nThis volume was small and agreeable to handle, the India paper pleasant\r\nto the girl's dainty touch. According to the child's request, she read\r\naloud the lines which were called for.\r\n\r\n“That's all,” said Jewel at last. “Oh cousin Eloise, it's just lovely\r\nand easy to get the lesson with you,” she added gratefully.\r\n\r\nEloise made no response. Her eye had been caught by a statement on the\r\npage before her, and she read on in silence.\r\n\r\nJewel waited a minute and then, seeing that her cousin was absorbed, she\r\nlaid down the Quarterly and took up her doll and sat still, watching the\r\npretty profile, undisturbed by doubts as to what her cousin might think\r\nof the book she held, and full of utter confidence that He who healeth\r\nall our diseases would minister to her through its pages.\r\n\r\nAt last Eloise again became conscious of her surroundings. She turned to\r\nher companion, a skeptical comment on her lips, but she suppressed\r\nthe words at sight of the innocent, expectant face. She certainly had\r\nnothing to give this child better than what she already possessed.\r\n\r\n“You can read it any time when you feel sorry, cousin Eloise, that and\r\nmy Bible too. Mother always does.”\r\n\r\n“Does she ever feel sorry?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes; but it can't last where the Bible is.”\r\n\r\n“I never saw that the Bible had anything to do with us,” said Eloise.\r\n\r\n“Why--ee!” Jewel suddenly dropped Anna Belle and again took up the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\n“What do you think I opened to?” holding the verse with her finger as\r\nshe looked up. Then she read, “'If ye love them that love you what thank\r\nhave ye?' Now isn't that something to do with you and grandpa?”\r\n\r\n“I don't see how I can love people who don't choose to be lovable,”\r\n returned Eloise. “What's the use of pretending?”\r\n\r\n“But then,” said the child, “the trouble is that everything that isn't\r\nlove is hate.”\r\n\r\nHer visitor raised her eyebrows. “Ah! I should have to think about\r\nthat,” she returned.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you'd better,” agreed Jewel. Then she turned to the Psalms and\r\nread the ninety-first.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished she looked up at her cousin, an earnest\r\nquestioning in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“That is very beautiful,” said Eloise. “I never heard it before. How\r\nwell you read it, Jewel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the child. “It's so much easier to read things when you\r\nknow them by heart.” Then she turned to the Twenty-third Psalm and read\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I've heard that one. It's beautiful of course, but I never thought\r\nof its having anything to do with us.” Eloise was watching her cousin\r\ncuriously. It seemed too strange for belief that a healthy child of her\r\nage should be taking a vital interest in the Bible and endeavoring to\r\nprove a position from its pages.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl finally rose to go she turned at the door:--\r\n\r\n“Remember your promise not to tell grandfather about this morning,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nJewel, hovering about her, looked troubled.\r\n\r\n“Would you just as lief tell me why?” she asked.\r\n\r\nEloise gave the ghost of a smile. “It would be a long story, and I\r\nscarcely think you would understand.”\r\n\r\n“I think I could obey you better if you would tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. We, my mother and I, are not Mr. Evringham's real\r\nrelations,--to put it as you do,--and we have come here because my poor\r\nfather lost his money and we have nowhere else to go. We came without\r\nbeing invited, and it hurts to have to stay where we are not wanted. I\r\ndon't wish grandfather to think that I am being kind to you, for fear he\r\nwill believe that I am doing it to make him like me better and because I\r\nwant to stay here.”\r\n\r\nThe girl spoke slowly and with great clearness.\r\n\r\nJewel looked at her, speechless with surprise and perplexity.\r\n\r\nEloise went on: “I don't want to stay here, you understand. I wish to go\r\naway. I would go to-day if my mother were willing.”\r\n\r\nHer large eyes grew dark as she closed, and the child received a sense\r\nof the turbulence that underlay her words.\r\n\r\n“Thank you for explaining,” she returned in an awed tone. “I wish my\r\nmother was here; but God is, and He'll take care of you, cousin Eloise.\r\nMother says we don't ever need to stay in the shadow. There's always the\r\nsunshine, only we must do our part, we must come into it.”\r\n\r\n“How Jewel? Supposing you don't know how.”\r\n\r\n“You can learn how,” replied the child earnestly, “right in those books.\r\nLots of sorry people grow glad studying them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nJEWEL'S CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\nWhile Jewel still stood turning over in her mind what she had heard,\r\ncharming strains of music began coming up through the hall. Cousin\r\nEloise had gone to the piano.\r\n\r\n“I almost which I hadn't made her tell me,” thought the child, “for how\r\ncan I help grandpa not to be sorry they are here? Wouldn't I be sorry\r\nto have aunt Madge come and live with me when I never asked her to?”\r\n She stood for some minutes wrestling with the problem, but suddenly her\r\nexpression changed. “I was forgetting!” she exclaimed. “I mustn't get\r\nsorry too. God is All. Mortal mind can't do anything about it.” She\r\nclosed her eyes, and pressing her hand to her lips, stood for a minute\r\nin mute realization; then with a smile of relief, she took up Anna\r\nBelle.\r\n\r\n“Let's go down, dearie, and hear the music,” she said light heartedly.\r\n\r\nWhen the summons to luncheon sounded and Mrs. Evringham entered the\r\nparlor, she found the child curled up in a big chair, her doll in her\r\nlap, listening absorbedly to the last strains of a Chopin Ballade.\r\n\r\n“Do you like music, Julia?” she asked patronizingly, as her daughter\r\nfinished and turned about.\r\n\r\n“The child's name is Jewel,” said Eloise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, aunt Madge, I love it,” replied the little girl; “and I didn't\r\nknow people could play the piano the way cousin Eloise does.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham smiled. “I suppose you've not heard much good music.”\r\n\r\n“Yes'm, I've heard our organist in church.”\r\n\r\n“And Jewel can make good music herself,” said Eloise. “She can sing like\r\na little lark. I've been up in her room this morning.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham welcomed the look on her daughter's face as she made the\r\nstatement. “Thank fortune Eloise has played herself into good humor,”\r\n she thought.\r\n\r\n“Indeed? I must hear her sing some time. You're playing unusually well\r\nthis morning, my dear. I wish Dr. Ballard could have heard you. Come to\r\nluncheon.”\r\n\r\nThe three repaired to the dining-room, where Mrs. Forbes's glance\r\nimmediately noted the presence of Anna Belle. She took her from Jewel's\r\narms and placed her on a remote corner of the sideboard, in the middle\r\nof which glowed the American Beauty roses.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham approached them with solicitude.\r\n\r\n“They're looking finely, Mrs. Forbes,” she said suavely. “You surely\r\nunderstand the care of roses.” She lifted the silver scissors that hung\r\nfrom her chatelaine and succeeded in severing one of the long stems.\r\n\r\n“Here, little girl,” she added, advancing to Eloise, “you need this in\r\nyour white gown to cheer us up this rainy day.”\r\n\r\nThe girl shrank and opened her lips to decline, but restrained herself\r\nand submitted to have the flower pinned amid her laces.\r\n\r\nJewel gazed at her in open admiration. The glowing color lent a\r\nwonderful touch to the girl's beauty. Mrs. Evringham laughed low at the\r\nfascinated look in the plain little face, and luncheon began.\r\n\r\nTo Jewel it differed much from the ones that had preceded it. Mrs.\r\nForbes might hover like a large black cloud, aunt Madge might rail\r\nat the weather which cut her off from her afternoon drive, but the\r\nmorning's experience seemed to have put the child into new relations\r\nwith all, and Eloise often gave her a friendly glance or smile as the\r\nmeal progressed.\r\n\r\nIt was destined to a surprising interruption. In the midst of the\r\ndiscussion of lamb chops and Saratoga chips the door opened, and in\r\nwalked Dr. Ballard. The shoulders of his becoming raincoat were spangled\r\nwith drops, his hat was in his hand, a deprecatory smile brightened his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, won't you?” he said as he advanced to Mrs. Evringham and\r\nclasped the outstretched hand which eagerly welcomed him. “It was my one\r\nleisure half hour to-day.”\r\n\r\nHe brought the freshness of the spring air with him, and he went on\r\naround the table shaking hands with the others, and finally drew up a\r\nchair beside Jewel.\r\n\r\n“No, I can't eat anything,” he declared in response to the urging of\r\nMrs. Evringham and the housekeeper. “Can't stay long enough for that.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes fastened on the graceful girl opposite him, who was trying\r\nto offset her blushes by a direct and nonchalant gaze. The rose on her\r\nbreast seemed to be scorching her cheeks. She knew that her mother was\r\nexulting in the lucky inspiration which had made her set it there.\r\n\r\n“How good of you to come and cheer us!” exclaimed Mrs. Evringham. “Do\r\ntake off your coat and stay for a cosy hour. We will have some music.”\r\n\r\n“Don't tempt me. I have an office hour awaiting me. I came principally\r\nto see this little girl.”\r\n\r\nJewel had leaned back in her chair and was watching his bright face\r\nexpectantly.\r\n\r\n“I'm glad of it,” rejoined Mrs. Evringham devoutly. “I distrust these\r\nsudden recoveries, Dr. Ballard. Do make very sure that she hasn't one of\r\nthose lingering, treacherous fevers. I've heard of such things.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard's eyes laughed into those of his little neighbor. “She\r\ndoesn't look the part,” he returned.\r\n\r\nJewel gave a glance around the table. “Will you excuse me?” she said\r\npolitely, then she reached up to the doctor's ear.\r\n\r\n“Shall I go and get my money?” she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. “No,” he replied in a low tone. “I came to thank you\r\nvery much for your note, and to tell you that you don't owe me anything.\r\nI'm not usually a 'no cure, no pay' doctor. I take the money anyway, but\r\nthis time I'm going to make an exception.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Jewel, speaking aloud as long as he did.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see, you didn't take the medicine. That makes a difference.\r\nMost people take it.”\r\n\r\n“Ye--es,” rejoined Jewel rather doubtfully. She was not sure of this\r\nlogic.\r\n\r\n“So now we're perfectly square,” went on the doctor, “but don't you fall\r\nill again.” He shook his head at her. “I want us to remain friends.”\r\n\r\n“We'd always be friends, wouldn't we?” returned Jewel, smiling into his\r\nlaughing eyes.\r\n\r\n“When is our golf coming off, Miss Eloise?” he asked, looking across the\r\ntable again.\r\n\r\n“When the weather permits,” she responded graciously.\r\n\r\n“I guess that's going to be all right,” commented Mrs. Forbes mentally.\r\n“She's as pretty as a painting with that rose on, and her mother looks\r\nas contented as a cat with her paw on a mouse. She don't mean to play\r\nwith that mouse, either. She won't run any risks. She'll take it right\r\nin. You're pretty near done for, my young feller, and your eyes look\r\nwilling, I must say.”\r\n\r\nThe spring rain proved to be a protracted storm. Mr. Evringham made his\r\nhours long in the city. Eloise came up to Jewel's room each morning\r\nand read the lesson with her, always reading on to herself after it was\r\nfinished. She made the child tell her of the circumstances of her recent\r\nillness and cure, and listened to Jewel's affectionate comments on Dr.\r\nBallard's kindness with an inscrutable expression which did not satisfy\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\n“You love him, don't you?” asked the little girl.\r\n\r\nEloise gave a slight smile. “If everything that isn't love is hate, I\r\nsuppose I ought to,” she returned.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” agreed Jewel; “and he has been so kind to you I don't see\r\nhow you can help it.”\r\n\r\nThe girl sighed. “Don't grow up, Jewel,” she said. “It makes lots of\r\ntrouble.”\r\n\r\nOn the second one of her visits to the child's room she put her hand\r\non the flaxen head. “I'd like to fix your hair,” she said. “Mrs. Forbes\r\ndoesn't part it nicely.”\r\n\r\n“I do it myself,” returned Jewel; “but I'd be glad to have you.”\r\n\r\nSo Eloise washed the thick flaxen locks and dried them. Then she parted\r\nand brushed the hair, and when it was finally tied, Jewel regarded the\r\nreflection of her smooth head with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“It looks just the way mother makes it,” she said. “I'm going to write\r\nto mother and father to-night, and I'm going to tell them how kind you\r\nare to me.”\r\n\r\nThat evening, in Mr. Evringham's library, Jewel wrote the letter.\r\n\r\nHer grandfather, after making some extremely uncomplimentary comments\r\nupon the weather, had lowered his green-shaded electric light and\r\nestablished himself beneath it with his book.\r\n\r\nHe looked across at the child, who was situated as before at the table,\r\nher crossed feet, in their spring-heeled shoes, dangling beneath.\r\n\r\n“May I smoke, Jewel?” he asked, as he took a cigar from the case. He\r\nasked the question humorously, but the reply was serious.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, grandpa, of course; this is your room; but you know nobody\r\nlikes tobacco naturally except a worm.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham's deep-set eyes widened. “Is it possible? Well, we're all\r\nworms.”\r\n\r\nJewel smiled fondly at him, her head a little on one side, in its\r\ncharacteristic attitude.\r\n\r\n“You're such a joker,” she returned.\r\n\r\n“If you really dislike smoke,” said the broker after a minute, “perhaps\r\nyou'd better take your letter up to your room.”\r\n\r\n“I don't mind it,” she returned. “Father used to smoke. It's only a\r\nlittle while since it gave him up.”\r\n\r\n“You mean since he gave it up.”\r\n\r\n“No. When people study Christian Science, the error habits that they\r\nhave just go away.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? I'm glad you warned me.” Mr. Evringham blew a delicate ring of\r\nsmoke toward the table, but Jewel had begun to think of her parents, and\r\nher pencil was moving. Her grandfather noted the trim appearance of the\r\nbowed head.\r\n\r\n“I don't know but I was cut out for a man milliner after all,” he mused\r\ncomplacently. “Those bows have really a very chic appearance.”\r\n\r\nHis book interested him, and he soon became absorbed in its pages. Jewel\r\noccasionally coming to an orthographic problem looked up and waited, but\r\nhe did not observe her, so she patiently kept silence and resumed her\r\nwork. At last the letter was finished.\r\n\r\nShe looked again at her grandfather, and opened her cramped little hand\r\nwith relief. The back of her neck was tired with her bending posture.\r\nShe leaned back in the heavy chair to rest it while she waited. The\r\neyelids, grown heavy with her labors, wavered and winked. The rain\r\ndripped down the panes, as if it had fallen into a monotonous habit. The\r\nsound was soothing. Jewel fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen finally Mr. Evringham glanced at her he smiled. “Little\r\nthoroughbred,” he mused; “she'd never disturb me.” He rose and crossed\r\nto the child. There lay the finished letter. He took it up with some\r\nanticipation:--\r\n\r\nDEAR MOTHER AND FATHER----It is most time to get a leter from you but I\r\nwill not wait to tell you I am happy and well.\r\n\r\nGrandpa is the kindest man and he has the most Beautiful horse, her name\r\nis Essecks made. He let me sit on her back and give her Sugar. Cosin\r\nElloees is the prettiest one of all. She has things that make her sorry\r\nbut she is very kind to me. She washed my hare today and she helps me\r\nget the lesson. There is a docter here he is lovly. He tried to cure me\r\nwhen I had a claim but Mrs. Lewis did. Cosin Elloees reads S. and H when\r\nwe get throo the lesson and I think she will be glad Pretty soon and\r\nnot afrade Grandpa doesn't want her and Ant maj. She won't let me tell\r\ngrandpa she is kind to me, but I can Explane beter when you come home.\r\n\r\nGrandpa's kindness is inside, and he Looks sorry but noboddy cood help\r\nloving him. I love you both every minnit and the leters in my pocket\r\nhelp me so much.\r\n\r\nYour dear\r\n\r\nJEWEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham had scarcely finished reading this epistle when Jewel's\r\nhead slipped on the polished woodwork against which she was leaning and\r\nbumped against the side of the chair with a jar which awoke her.\r\n\r\nSeeing her grandfather standing near she smiled drowsily. “I fell\r\nasleep, didn't I?” she said, and rubbed her eyes; then noting the sheet\r\nof paper in Mr. Evringham's hand, memory returned to her. She sat up\r\nwith a start.\r\n\r\n“Oh, grandpa, you haven't read my letter!” she exclaimed, with an\r\naccent of dismay which brought the blood to the broker's face. He felt a\r\nculprit before the shocked blue eyes.\r\n\r\n“To--to see if it was spelled right, you know,” he said. “You had me do\r\nit before.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I wanted you to then,” returned the child; “but it is error to\r\nread people's letters unless they ask you to, isn't it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it's confoundedly bad form, Jewel. I beg your pardon. You didn't\r\nmean me to see those sweet things you said about me, eh?”\r\n\r\n“That was no matter. It was cousin Eloise's secret. She trusted me.” The\r\nchild's eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\nThe broker cleared his throat. “No harm done, I'm sure. No harm done,”\r\n he returned brusquely, to cover his discomfiture. For the first time he\r\nmade an advance toward his granddaughter. “Come here a minute, Jewel.”\r\n He took her hand and led her to his chair, and seating himself,\r\nlifted her into his lap. The corners of her lips were drawing down\r\ninvoluntarily, and as her head fell against his broad shoulder, he took\r\nout his handkerchief and dried her eyes. “I hope you'll forgive me,” he\r\nsaid. “After this I will always wait for your permission. Now what is\r\nthis about cousin Eloise?”\r\n\r\nJewel shook her head, not trusting herself to speak.\r\n\r\n“You can't tell me?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then don't you think perhaps it was a good thing I read your letter\r\nafter all, if it is something I ought to know?”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was not so interested to discover the secrets of his\r\nbeautiful guest as to set himself right with this admirer. He did not\r\nrelish falling from his pedestal.\r\n\r\n“Do you think perhaps Divine Love made you do it, grandpa?” asked the\r\nchild tremulously, with returning hope.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham was quite certain that it had been curiosity, but he was\r\nwilling to accept a higher sounding hypothesis.\r\n\r\n“Mother explained to me about God making 'the wrath of man to praise\r\nHim,'” added Jewel after the moment's pause. “If it makes you kind to\r\ncousin Eloise, perhaps we can be glad you read it.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with Eloise?” asked Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\nJewel sat up, fixed him with her eyes, pressed her lips together, and\r\nshook her head.\r\n\r\n“You won't tell me?”\r\n\r\nThe head went on firmly shaking.\r\n\r\n“Then let me read the letter again.”\r\n\r\n“No, grandpa,” decidedly.\r\n\r\nHe kept one arm around her as he smoothed his mustache. “Is there\r\nsomething you think I ought to do?”\r\n\r\nA light seemed to illumine the eyes that the little girl kept fixed on\r\nhis, but she did not speak.\r\n\r\n“Do you think it discourteous for me to spend my evenings away from\r\nthose two? They don't want me, child.”\r\n\r\nStill she did not speak. Mr. Evringham was divided between a desire to\r\nshake her and the wish to see the familiar fondness return to her face.\r\n\r\n“You wrote that Eloise thinks I do not want her and her mother here. Her\r\nintelligence is of a higher order than I feared. Well, what can be done\r\nabout it? I've been asking myself that for some time. How would it do to\r\nsettle some money upon them and then say good-by?”\r\n\r\n“If you did it with love,” suggested Jewel.\r\n\r\n“It's my impression that they could dispense with the love under those\r\ncircumstances.” The broker gave a slight smile.\r\n\r\nThe child put an impulsive little hand on his shoulder. “No indeed,\r\ngrandpa. Nobody can do without love. It hurts cousin Eloise because she\r\nisn't your real relation. She doesn't know how kind you are inside.” The\r\nchild's lips closed suddenly.\r\n\r\n“She fixed your hair very nicely,” Mr. Evringham viewed the flaxen head\r\ncritically. “That's one thing in her favor.”\r\n\r\n“She's full of things in her favor,” returned Jewel warmly. “Error's\r\nusing you, grandpa, not to love her. If we don't love people we can't be\r\nsure anything we do to them is right.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham raised one hand and scratched his head slowly, regarding\r\nJewel with what she felt was intended to be a humorous air.\r\n\r\n“Couldn't you give me an easier one?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh grandpa,” the flaxen head nestled against his breast and the child\r\nsighed. “I wish everybody knew how kind you are,” and the broker patted\r\nher shoulder and enjoyed the clinging pressure of her cheek, for it\r\nassured him that again he stood firmly on the pedestal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nESSEX MAID\r\n\r\nThe rain and wind lasted for three days, clearing at last on an evening\r\nwhich proved eventful.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham had taken a long ride into the country roundabout, and\r\nJewel had been down at the gate to greet his return. He swung her up\r\ninto the saddle with him, and in triumph she rode to the barn.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham observed this from the window and reported to Eloise.\r\n\r\n“I didn't suppose father would be so indulgent to any living thing as\r\nhe is to that child,” she said rather dejectedly. “Do you know, Eloise,\r\nMrs. Forbes says that Jewel spends every evening with him in his study.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? I'm not surprised. He had to take pity on her since we would\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham sighed. “I really believe nobody was ever so exasperating\r\nas you are,” she returned. “When Jewel first came, if you remember, I\r\nwished to welcome her,--in fact I did,--but you refused to be decently\r\ncivil. Now you speak as if we had made a mistake, and that it was my\r\nfault. I wish you would let Dr. Ballard prescribe for you. I don't think\r\nyou are well.”\r\n\r\n“He does prescribe roses and chocolates, and I take them, don't I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and after this you can have some golf. It will do you good.”\r\n\r\nTo-day was the third during which Eloise had helped her cousin with\r\nthe morning lesson and brushed and braided her hair. Jewel had had many\r\nminds about whether to tell Eloise of her escaped secret. An intuition\r\nbade her refrain, but the sense of dishonesty was more than the\r\nchild could bear; so that morning, during the hair braiding, she had\r\nconfessed. She began thus:--\r\n\r\n“I wrote to my father and mother last night how good you were to me.”\r\n\r\n“Did you tell them how good you were to me?” asked the girl, so kindly\r\nthat the child's heart leaped within her and she more than ever wished\r\nthat she had nothing to confess.\r\n\r\n“I wish I could be, cousin Eloise; I meant to be, but error crept in.”\r\n The girl was learning something of the new phraseology, and she smiled\r\nat Jewel in the glass and was surprised to find what troubled eyes met\r\nhers. “I went to sleep that night waiting for grandpa to be through with\r\nhis book, and when I waked up he had read my letter.”\r\n\r\nEloise's smile faded. “Tell me again what you said in it,” she returned.\r\n\r\nJewel's lips quivered. “I said how kind you were, and washed my hair,\r\nand asked me not to tell grandpa--”\r\n\r\n“You put that in?” Eloise interrupted eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe child took courage from her changed tone. “Yes; I said you didn't\r\nwant him to know you were kind to me.”\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled slightly and went on with her brushing.\r\n\r\n“He wished he hadn't read it when he saw how sorry I was. He asked my\r\npardon and said he had done bad form. I don't know what that is.”\r\n\r\n“It's the worst thing that can happen to some people,” returned Eloise.\r\n“Good form is said to be the New York conscience.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” responded Jewel, not understanding, but too relieved and grateful\r\nthat her cousin was not unforgiving to press the matter.\r\n\r\nEloise fell into thought. Mr. Evringham had certainly been more genial\r\nat table, conversation had been more general and sustained last evening\r\nthan ever before the advent of Jewel, and he had not sneered, either.\r\nEloise searched her memory for some word or look that might have given\r\nhurt to her self-esteem, but she could find none.\r\n\r\nOn this evening Mr. Evringham was in unusual spirits at dinner time. He\r\ntold of the pleasure of Essex Maid at finding herself free of the stable\r\nagain, and of the gallop he had taken among the hills.\r\n\r\nThe meat course had just been removed when Sarah came in with a troubled\r\nface, saying that Zeke wanted to see Mr. Evringham. Something was the\r\nmatter with Essex Maid. She seemed “very bad.”\r\n\r\nThe master's face changed, and he moved back from the table. The\r\ncountenances of the others showed consternation. Mrs. Forbes turned\r\npale. Had Zeke done anything, or left something undone? She dropped her\r\ntray and hastened after Mr. Evringham. Eloise noticed that Jewel's\r\neyes were closed. In a minute the child pushed back from the table, and\r\nwithout a word to the others she hurried to the scene of trouble. She\r\nmet Mrs. Forbes rushing to the kitchen for hot water.\r\n\r\n“Go straight into the house, Jewel,” cried the housekeeper with an anger\r\nborn of her excitement. “Don't you go near that barn and get in the\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nThe child, scarcely hearing her, fled on. As she entered the barn she\r\nheard her grandfather's voice addressing Zeke, who was flinging a saddle\r\non Dick.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Busby'll leave anything when he knows it's the Maid.” He didn't\r\nneed to say “hurry.” Zeke was as anxious as his master to get the\r\nveterinary surgeon.\r\n\r\nEssex Maid had fallen in her stall and was making her misery apparent,\r\ntossing her head and rolling her eyes. Her master's teeth were set.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa, may I try to help?” came Jewel's eager voice.\r\n\r\n“Go away, child,” sternly. “You'll get hurt.”\r\n\r\n“But may I treat her?”\r\n\r\n“Do anything,” brusquely; “but don't come near.”\r\n\r\nJewel ran to the back of the barn, dropped on the floor, and buried her\r\nface in her hands.\r\n\r\nFive minutes passed, ten, fifteen. Zeke rode up to the barn door, white\r\nand wild-eyed in the twilight.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Busby was away!” he gasped. “They tried to get him on the\r\ntelephone, and at last did. He'll be here in a few minutes.”\r\n\r\n“The Maid's better,” said Mr. Evringham, wiping his forehead. “There\r\nhasn't been a repetition of the attack.” Mrs. Forbes stood by, fanning\r\nherself with her apron. The mare was standing quietly.\r\n\r\n“Great Scott, but I'm glad!” replied Zeke devoutly. “I've seen 'em\r\nkeel up with that. You can go through me with a fine tooth comb, Mr.\r\nEvringham, and you won't find a thing I've neglected for that mare.”\r\n Excitement had placed the young fellow beyond his awe for the master.\r\n\r\n“I believe you, boy,” returned the broker. In his relief he would have\r\nbelieved anything.\r\n\r\n“See the poor kid,” said Zeke, catching sight of the little figure\r\nsitting out of earshot, where the twilight touched her.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham wheeled and strode back to the child. Her face was still\r\nhidden.\r\n\r\n“Don't cry, Jewel,” he said kindly, his voice unsteady. “She's better.”\r\n\r\nThe child looked up radiantly. “I knew it!”\r\n\r\nThe unexpected look and exclamation startled her grandfather. “Zeke says\r\nthe doctor can't get here for a little while,” he went on, “but the mare\r\nis out of pain.”\r\n\r\n“It's all right,” rejoined the child joyously. “The doctor ought not to\r\ncome. We shall do better without him.”\r\n\r\nThe first gleam of her meaning began to shine across the broker's mind.\r\nHe stared down at the little figure, uncertain whether to laugh or cry,\r\nsufficiently shaken to do either.\r\n\r\n“Why, you midget you,” he said, picking the child up in his arms; “have\r\nyou been trying your tricks over here in the corner?”\r\n\r\n“That isn't the way to talk, grandpa, when God has helped us so,”\r\n returned Jewel earnestly.\r\n\r\nZeke, following his employer, had heard this colloquy, and stared open\r\nmouthed.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Busby arrived he was a much injured man. “The mare's perfectly\r\nfit,” he grumbled. “You've made me leave an important case.”\r\n\r\n“Very sorry,” returned Mr. Evringham, trying to look so. “The fact is\r\nthe Maid has given us a scare in the last hour that I shouldn't like\r\nrepeated. Look her over carefully, Busby, carefully.”\r\n\r\n“I have.” The veterinary gave a cross look around the group, his glance\r\nresting a moment on the upturned face of a little flaxen-haired girl who\r\nstood with her hand in Mr. Evringham's.\r\n\r\n“He's falling into his dotage, I guess,” said the doctor privately to\r\nZeke, as he prepared to ride away.\r\n\r\n“Don't fool yourself,” returned the young fellow. “The mare pretty near\r\nscared me into a fit. My knees ain't real steady yet.”\r\n\r\nHe stood watching the disappearing figure of the veterinary. “That kid\r\nbelieves praying did it,” he mused. “I ain't going to believe that, of\r\ncourse, but the whole thing was the queerest ever.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham, after one more visit to the stall of Essex Maid, started\r\nback to the house, Jewel skipping beside him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes remained in the barn, one hand still pressed to her ample\r\nbosom, a teakettle in the other.\r\n\r\n“What'd you calc'late to do, ma?” inquired her son, approaching her.\r\n\r\n“Wring out hot flannels. It's sense to treat colic the same, whether\r\nit's in a horse or a baby.”\r\n\r\nZeke laughed. “Essex Maid didn't think so, did she?”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn't let us do a thing. I saw the tears drip out of Mr. Evringham's\r\neyes plain as I see you now. Zeke Forbes, you'll never know what it was\r\nto me to have you come in and speak the way you did. You couldn't have\r\ndone it if you'd mistreated the horse any way.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” returned the coachman emphatically. “I ain't monkeying with\r\nbuzz saws this year.”\r\n\r\n“Not knowingly you wouldn't. But, child,”--Mrs. Forbes set down the\r\nkettle and pressed the other hand tighter to her bosom as she came\r\ncloser to him, “last night you'd been drinking when you came home.”\r\n\r\n“Ho!” laughed Zeke uncomfortably, “just a smile or two with the boys. By\r\nginger, you've got a nose on you, mother.”\r\n\r\n“Can you think of your father and then laugh over it, Zeke? There hasn't\r\na man ever come to be a sot that didn't laugh about it in the first\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“Now, mother, now, now,” said the young fellow in half-impatient tones\r\nof consolation, as he took the handkerchief from her apron pocket and\r\nwiped her eyes, where tears began to spring. “You must trust a chap to\r\ndo what's right. I ain't a fool. Don't you think about this again. I\r\ncan take care of myself. Come now, to change the subject, what's your\r\nopinion of Christian Science as applied to horses with the colic?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” returned the housekeeper in an unusually subdued\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n“Why, didn't you catch on? The kid was over there in the corner treating\r\nthe Maid. That's what they call it, treating 'em. Mr. Evringham laughed\r\nwhen he found out, and she jumped on him. Yes, she did; came right out\r\nand told him that wasn't the way to show his gratitude, or something\r\nlike that. Think of the nerve!”\r\n\r\n“I ain't surprised. That child can't surprise me.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you think of it, ma? I tell you 't was queer, the way that\r\nmare's pain stopped. Of course I ain't going to believe--but,” firmly,\r\n“I can't get away from a notion that those Christian Science folks know\r\nsomething that we don't. Busby was madder'n a hornet. I didn't scarcely\r\nknow what to say to him.”\r\n\r\n“Don't be soft, Zeke,” returned his mother, picking up the kettle. “The\r\ntime for superstition has gone by.”\r\n\r\nAs Jewel and her grandfather entered the house they heard music.\r\n\r\n“That's cousin Eloise playing. Have you heard her grandpa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, when they first came.”\r\n\r\n“Than you haven't sat with them in the evening for a long time?”\r\n suggested the child.\r\n\r\n“No. I--I didn't wish to monopolize their society. I wanted to give Dr.\r\nBallard a chance. He is a friend of theirs, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I think cousin Eloise would be glad if she thought you liked\r\nher playing. It's very beautiful, isn't it, grandpa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I dare say. Then, besides, I'm not at all sure that Mrs. Evringham\r\nwould permit me to smoke in the drawing-room.”\r\n\r\n“But wouldn't it be nice to go in there just a few minutes before you go\r\nto your study? I love to hear cousin Eloise play, but I like to be with\r\nyou, grandpa.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham was in a yielding state of mind. He allowed the pressure\r\nof the child's hand on his to lead him to the drawing-room, where his\r\nentrance made a little stir.\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard was sitting near the piano, listening to the music.\r\nEverybody rose as the newcomers entered.\r\n\r\n“How are you, Ballard? Jewel wished to hear her cousin's music, and so\r\nbehold us. If we bring a reminder of the stable, blame her.”\r\n\r\n“Oh father, that dear horse is all right, I'm sure,” gushed Mrs.\r\nEvringham, “or else you wouldn't be here!”\r\n\r\n“What? Something the matter with Essex Maid?” asked Dr. Ballard with\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n“Yes.” Mr. Evringham seated himself. “A sharp attack, but short. She\r\nwas relieved before we could get Busby here.” The speaker contracted his\r\neyebrows and looked at the child, who was still beside him. “The mare\r\nhad received mental treatments meanwhile,” he added gravely.\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard smiled, and drawing Jewel to him, lifted her upon his knee.\r\n“Look here,” he said, “can't you let anything around here be sick in\r\npeace? We doctors shall have to form a union and manage to get you\r\nboycotted.”\r\n\r\nThe child smiled back at him, her head a little on one side, as her\r\nmanner was when she was in doubt how to respond.\r\n\r\n“What a blessing!” exclaimed Mrs. Evringham vivaciously. “Here, father,\r\nis the best cup of coffee you ever drank, if I did make it myself.”\r\n\r\nMany weeks had elapsed since the broker had accepted a cup of coffee\r\nfrom that fair hand, but he rose now to take it with good grace.\r\n\r\n“Is there going to be some cambric tea for this baby?” inquired Dr.\r\nBallard.\r\n\r\n“You must be hungry, Jewel; you hadn't finished your dinner,” said her\r\ngrandfather, but she protested that she was not.\r\n\r\n“How is Anna Belle?” asked Dr. Ballard. “It's a long time since I saw\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Would you like to?” asked Jewel doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Why--of--course!--if she's still up. Don't have her dress on my\r\naccount.”\r\n\r\n“She doesn't go to bed till I do,” responded the child. “I know\r\nshe'd love to come down!” In a flash she had bounded to the door and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nEloise was still sitting on the piano stool, facing the room.\r\n“Grandfather,” she said, leaning slightly forward in her earnestness,\r\n“did Jewel really treat Essex Maid?”\r\n\r\nThe broker shrugged his shoulders and smiled as he stirred his coffee.\r\n\r\n“I believe she did.”\r\n\r\n“And do you think it did the horse any good?”\r\n\r\n“Don't be absurd!” cried her mother laughingly, on nettles lest the girl\r\ndisplease the young doctor.\r\n\r\n“Don't crowd me, Eloise, don't crowd me,” responded Mr. Evringham. “I'd\r\nrather have something a little more substantial doing for a sick horse\r\nthan the prayers of an infant; eh, Ballard?”\r\n\r\n“I've been reading Jewel's Christian Science book a great deal the last\r\nfew days,” said Eloise. “If it's the truth, then she helped Essex Maid.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham was dismayed. “What a very large _if_, my dear,” she\r\nreturned lightly.\r\n\r\n“She's a bright little girl,” said Dr. Ballard, and as he spoke Jewel\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\nShe brought her doll straight to him, and he took both child and doll on\r\nhis lap.\r\n\r\n“Dear fellow,” thought Mrs. Evringham, “how fond he is of children! I'd\r\nlike to put Eloise in a strait-jacket. Do play some more, dear, won't\r\nyou?” she said aloud, eager to return to safe ground.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, cousin Eloise,” added Jewel ardently.\r\n\r\n“If you will sing afterward. Will you?” asked the girl.\r\n\r\n“Can you sing, Jewel?” asked Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“No, grandpa, nothing but the tunes in church.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he responded, half smiling again, “I don't know that a hymn\r\nwould be so out of place to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Do play the lovely running thing about spring, cousin Eloise,” begged\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\nThe girl turned back to the piano. “Jewel is so modern that she doesn't\r\nknow the Mendelssohn 'Spring Song,'” she said, and forthwith she began\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJewel's head lay back against Dr. Ballard's shoulder, and her eyes never\r\nswerved from the white-robed musician.\r\n\r\nWhen the player had finished and been thanked, the child and the doctor\r\nexchanged a look of appreciation. “That sounds the way it does in the\r\nRavine of Happiness,” said Jewel.\r\n\r\n“Where is that?”\r\n\r\n“Where the brook is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Dr. Ballard had unpleasant associations with the brook. “I\r\nunderstand you are fond of horses,” he added irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to go driving with me to-morrow morning?”\r\n\r\nJewel's face grew radiant.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes!” She looked across at her grandfather.\r\n\r\n“I promised to take you driving, didn't I, Jewel? Well, the pleasant\r\nweather has come. I guess she'll go with me to-morrow, Ballard.”\r\n\r\n“Guess again, Mr. Evringham,” retorted the doctor gayly. “She has\r\naccepted my invitation.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham looked on and wondered. “What is it about that child that\r\ntakes them all?” she soliloquized. “She reminds me of that dreadfully\r\nplain Madam what's-her-name, who was so fascinating to everybody at the\r\nFrench court.”\r\n\r\nEloise was smiling. “Now it's your turn, Jewel,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe child looked from one to another. “I never sang for anybody,” she\r\nreturned doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Yes indeed, for Anna Belle. I've heard you,” said Eloise.\r\n\r\n“Oh, she was singing with me.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Let her sing with you now.”\r\n\r\n“What one?”\r\n\r\n“The one I heard,--'Father, where Thine own children are I love to be.'”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you mean. 'O'er waiting harpstrings.' All right,” and the child,\r\nsitting where she was, sang the well-loved hymn to a touched audience.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, Jewel,” said her grandfather when she had finished. “Your\r\nmusic isn't all in your soul.” His eyes were glistening.\r\n\r\n“Those are beautiful words,” said Dr. Ballard. “I don't remember any\r\nsuch hymn.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Eddy wrote it,” returned the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It wasn't Castle Discord to-night,” she said later to Anna Belle, while\r\nthey were going to bed. “Didn't you notice how much differently people\r\nloved one another?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nA MORNING DRIVE\r\n\r\n“I declare, Eloise,” said Mrs. Evringham the next morning, “it is almost\r\nworth three whole days of storm to have a spell of such heavenly weather\r\nto follow. We're sure of several days like this now,” She was standing\r\nat the open window, having shown a surprising energy in rising soon\r\nafter breakfast.\r\n\r\nShe glanced over her shoulder at her daughter, who was picking up the\r\ngarments strewn about the room. “Now you can live out of doors, I hope,\r\nand get yourself toned up again. Really, last evening things were very\r\ncomfortable, weren't they?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I thought the lump had begun to be leavened,” returned the girl.\r\n\r\n“Talk English, please,” said her mother vivaciously. “Father seemed\r\nquite human, and that is all we have ever needed to make things\r\ntolerable here. I suppose we reaped the benefit of his relief about the\r\nhorse.”\r\n\r\n“It's all Jewel,” said Eloise, smiling. “That's English, isn't it?”\r\n\r\n“Jewel!” Mrs. Evringham exclaimed. “Why, you're all daffy about that\r\nchild. What _is_ the attraction?”\r\n\r\n“That's what I'm trying to find out. It's time for me to go up now and\r\nbraid her hair and read the lesson.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham regarded her daughter. “Young people are eager for\r\nnovelty, I know,” she said, “and it would seem as if an interest in a\r\nchild was an innocent diversion for you at a time when you were growing\r\nmorbid, but I do think I'm the most unlucky woman in the world! To think\r\nthat the child should have to be a Christian Scientist, and that you\r\nshould take this perverse interest in her ideas just now. I haven't\r\nspoken of your remarks about the horse last night, but it was in poor\r\ntaste, to say the least, to mention such nonsense before Dr. Ballard,\r\nand apparently do it so seriously. I knew you had been helping Jewel\r\nwith lessons, but until last evening I didn't suspect that it might all\r\nbe on that odious subject. Is it, Eloise?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but it isn't odious. I like the fruit of it in her.”\r\n\r\n“You've never shown Dr. Ballard your most agreeable side, and now if\r\nyou're going to parade before him, an Episcopalian and a physician, an\r\ninterest in this--anarchism, I shan't blame him in the smallest degree\r\nif he gives up all thought of you.”\r\n\r\nEloise, the undemonstrative, put an arm around her mother. “Shan't you,\r\nreally?” she replied wistfully. “If I could only hope that.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to give me nervous prostration?” rejoined Mrs. Evringham\r\nsharply. “Eloise,” her voice suddenly breaking, “do you love to torment\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I don't, poor mother, but I've been so tormented myself, and so\r\ndesirous not to--oh, not to do anything ignoble! I can't tell you all\r\nI've endured since--” She paused, her lips unsteady.\r\n\r\n“Since we lost your father,” dismally. “Yes, I know it. I'm the most\r\nunlucky woman in the world!”\r\n\r\nEloise's arm tightened about her mother as she went on, “Since I was\r\nenchanted and thrown into Castle Discord.” She looked off at the mental\r\npicture of her cousin. “Mother,” she turned back suddenly, “what a\r\nwonderful thing it is if there really is a God.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Eloise Evringham, have you ever doubted it! That's positively\r\nill-bred!”\r\n\r\n“But One that would be any good to us! Jewel's mother thinks she knows\r\nsuch a One, and so does the child. I wish you'd look into this Christian\r\nScience with me. You might find it better than getting grandfather to\r\npay our bills, better than marrying me to Dr. Ballard.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham raised her eyes to her deity. “What have I ever done,”\r\n she ejaculated, “that I should have a queer child! Well, I will not\r\nlook into it,” she returned decidedly; “and if Dr. Ballard were not the\r\nbroad, noble type of man that he is, he wouldn't take the trouble to\r\nnotice and entertain a child who has treated him as she has. It might\r\ntouch even you to see the lengths to which he goes to please you. I hope\r\nyou will at least have the grace to go down with Jewel to the buggy and\r\nsee them off.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn't in this wrapper,” replied Eloise, releasing the speaker.\r\n\r\n“Of course not, so put on a dress before you go up to Jewel.”\r\n\r\n“It's too late, dear. He'll be here by half-past ten. I must have her\r\nready.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham looked after her daughter's retreating figure, and then\r\nher lips came together firmly. She untied the ribbons of the loose gown\r\nof lace and silk, in which she had keyed herself up by degrees to face\r\nthe requirements of luncheon and the afternoon's diversions, and donned\r\na conventional dress, in which she composed herself by the window to\r\nwatch for the doctor's buggy. There was a vista in the park avenue which\r\nafforded a fair look at equipages three minutes before they could reach\r\nMr. Evringham's gateway.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the doctor's office hour was over this stanch supporter\r\nset herself to watch that gap. As soon as she saw Hector's dappled coat\r\nand easy stride she sprang up and went downstairs, and when the shining\r\nbuggy paused at the steps and Dr. Ballard jumped out, she appeared on\r\nthe piazza to greet him.\r\n\r\n“What an inspiring morning!” she said, as he removed his hat. “That\r\ninsane girl!” she thought. “If he had chanced to be awkward and plain,\r\nhe would have been just as important to us. His good looks are thrown\r\nin, and yet she won't behave herself.”\r\n\r\n“Glorious indeed!” he replied heartily. “Where's my young lady?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham had plenty of worldly experience, and not even her\r\nenemies called her stupid, but at this moment there was but one young\r\nlady in the world to her, as she believed there was to him.\r\n\r\n“She is upstairs braiding Jewel's hair,” she replied before she realized\r\nher own insanity. Then she hastened on, coloring under the odd look in\r\nhis eyes, “But you mean Jewel, of course. She will be down at once, I'm\r\nsure. It's so kind of you to take her.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. She's an original worth cultivating.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham shrugged her shoulders. “I suppose she must be, since you\r\nall say so. Eloise gives up a surprising amount of time to her, but I\r\ncan't judge much from that, because Eloise is so unselfish. For my part,\r\nthe child's ideas are so strange, and my little girl is still so young\r\nand impressionable, I object to having them much together. It may seem\r\nvery absurd, when Jewel is so young.”\r\n\r\n“No; I saw last evening how interested Miss Eloise already is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” hastily, “she pretends to be, and I assure you I object. Eloise\r\nhas a good mind, and I hope you will offer a little antidote now\r\nand then to the stuff she has begun to read. A word to the wise, Dr.\r\nBallard. I need say no more.”\r\n\r\nIt was true. Mrs. Evringham had no need to say more. Her ideas, and\r\nespecially those which related to himself, had always been inscribed in\r\nlarge characters and words of one syllable for her present companion,\r\nwho was a young man of considerable perception and discrimination.\r\n\r\nHe had not time to reply before Jewel, radiant of face, appeared in the\r\ndoorway, where she hesitated, her doll in her arms.\r\n\r\n“I brought Anna Belle,” she said doubtfully, “but I can leave her under\r\nthe stairs if there isn't room.”\r\n\r\n“Anna Belle under the stairs on a morning like this! And in such a\r\ntoilet? Talk about error!” The doctor's tone was tragic as he lifted the\r\nhappy child into the buggy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham nodded a reply to their smiling farewells as Hector\r\nsprang forward, and she looked after them in some perplexity.\r\n\r\n“Why should he take the trouble?” she reflected. “It would have been\r\nsuch a splendid morning for them to have gone riding if he had this\r\nleisure. Of course it must have been just one of his indirect and lovely\r\nways of trying to please Eloise.”\r\n\r\nJust as she was solacing herself with the latter reflection, her\r\ndaughter stepped out on the piazza, a little black book in her hand.\r\n\r\n“Warm enough to sit out, isn't it?” she remarked.\r\n\r\nHer mother looked at her critically. She had not seen this care-free\r\nlook on her child's face since Lawrence died.\r\n\r\n“Why didn't you come out a little sooner?”\r\n\r\n“I wasn't presentable. How delicious the air is!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Let us sit here and finish that novel.”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\n“What have you there?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Eddy's book,--'Science and Health.'”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham made a grimace. “I read part of it once. That was enough\r\nfor me. Think of the price they charge for it, too. Think of pretending\r\nit is such a good thing for everybody to have, and then putting a price\r\non it that prohibits the average pocketbook.” Eloise's smile annoyed her\r\nmother. “Weren't you with me the day Nat Bonnell's mother said so much\r\nabout it?”\r\n\r\n“How foolish she was not to try it,” said Eloise. “Such a hopeless,\r\nmonotonous invalid.”\r\n\r\n“Well, some of her friends worked hard enough to induce her to, but when\r\nshe found out the mercenary side of it, she saw at once that it couldn't\r\nbe trustworthy.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose even Christian Scientists must have a roof and food and\r\nclothes,” returned Eloise coolly; “but I've thought a good deal the last\r\nfew days about the criticisms I've heard on the price of the book. The\r\nfuss over that three dollars is certainly very funny, when the\r\naverage pocketbook goes to the theatre sometimes, has flowers for its\r\nentertainments, and rejoices to find lace reduced from a dollar and a\r\nquarter to ninety-five cents a yard for its gowns. It eagerly hoards and\r\nspends three dollars for some passing pleasure or effect, but winces and\r\nponders over paying the same sum for a book that will last a lifetime,\r\nand which, if it is worth anything, furnishes the key to every problem\r\nin life.”\r\n\r\n“But why isn't it as cheap as the Bible if it is so beneficial?”\r\n\r\n“It will be, probably, when it is generally respected. For the present\r\nit wouldn't be wise to cast it about like pearls before swine.” Eloise\r\nsmiled at herself. “You see I'm talking as if I knew it all. My wisdom\r\ncomes partially from what I have extracted from Jewel, and partly from\r\nwhat is obvious. I haven't reached the place yet where I am convinced,\r\nbut this book is wonderfully interesting. It came to me in the darkest\r\nhour I have ever known, and it has--it has seemed to feed me when I was\r\nstarving. I don't know how else to put it. I can't think of anything\r\nelse. Mother, why haven't we a Bible? I was ashamed when Jewel asked\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham, astonished and dismayed by her daughter's earnestness,\r\ndrew herself up. “We have a Bible, certainly. What an idea!”\r\n\r\n“Where is it?” eagerly.\r\n\r\n“In the storage warehouse with the other books.”\r\n\r\nEloise's laugh nettled her mother.\r\n\r\n“The prayer books are upstairs on my table. What more do you want if you\r\nare going to take an interest in such things? I wish you would, dear,\r\nand embroider an altar cloth while you are here. I'm sure father would\r\ngladly contribute the materials and feel a pride in it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh mother,” Eloise still smiled, “you know he never goes to church.”\r\n\r\n“But he contributes largely.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I haven't time to embroider altar cloths. Shall I get the story?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, do. We'll go around the corner, out of the wind.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dr. Ballard's buggy was covering the ground rapidly. Through\r\nthe avenues of the park sped Hector, and joy! Dr. Ballard allowed Jewel\r\nto drive as long as they remained within its precincts. Slipping his\r\nhand through the reins above where she grasped them, he held Anna Belle\r\non his knee. Jewel had not suspected the size of the park. One could\r\nalmost see the watered leaves increase in the sunshine, and the birds\r\nwere swelling their little throats to the utmost. The roses in her\r\ncheeks deepened in her happy excitement. She allowed the doctor to do\r\nmost of the talking, while she kept her eyes on the horse's ears. Just\r\nonce she ventured to turn enough to glance at him.\r\n\r\n“I've had dreams of driving horses,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Is this the first time you've done it waking?”\r\n\r\n“No, the second. Father took me once in Washington Park just before\r\nhe came away, but the horse didn't pull like this.” She smiled\r\nseraphically.\r\n\r\n“So, boy, steady,” said the doctor soothingly, and Hector obeyed the\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“Did you play in the Ravine of Happiness when you were a little boy?”\r\n\r\n“Where's that?”\r\n\r\n“Where the brook is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes. Are you planning to take me to that brook and wet my feet,\r\nJewel?”\r\n\r\n“We've gone long past it. Don't you know?”\r\n\r\n“I think my education has been neglected. I don't remember it.”\r\n\r\n“We can go,” returned Jewel suggestively.\r\n\r\n“Very well, we will; but first I have a couple of visits I must make.”\r\n\r\nThe horse was now trotting toward the park gate. As they reached it Dr.\r\nBallard returned Anna Belle and took the lines.\r\n\r\nJewel gave an unconscious sigh of rapture. “Trolleys and so on, you\r\nknow,” explained Dr. Ballard. “When you come back ten years from now you\r\nshall drive outside too. How was Essex Maid this morning?”\r\n\r\n“She was all right, but grandpa took only a short ride. I guess he was a\r\nlittle--bit--afraid.”\r\n\r\n“She's the apple of his eye, or he wouldn't have been so nervous over a\r\ntrifle last evening,” remarked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Well, she made a great fuss,” replied Jewel. “She fell down in her\r\nstall, and everything like that.”\r\n\r\n“Did she really?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Zeke said his knees were shaking.”\r\n\r\n“But she was all right by the time Dr. Busby arrived?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard looked at his small companion, a quizzical smile curving his\r\nmustache.\r\n\r\n“I've never thought of taking a partner, Jewel, but I might consider\r\na mascot. What do you say to sharing my office and being my mascot?\r\nSpecial high chair for Anna Belle, be it well understood.”\r\n\r\nThe little girl eyed him, her head on one side. It was her experience\r\nthat all men were jokers. “I don't know what a mascot is,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“It's something or somebody that brings one good luck.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I could bring you good luck?”\r\n\r\n“It looks that way. Of course there are certain rules you would have to\r\nobserve. It wouldn't do for you to talk against materia medica to the\r\npatients in the anteroom.”\r\n\r\n“What is an anteroom?”\r\n\r\n“The place where my patients wait until I can see them in my office.”\r\n\r\nJewel lifted her shoulders and smiled. “I might read them 'Science and\r\nHealth' while they waited, and then they wouldn't have to go in.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard's laugh rang heartily along the leafy street. “Is that your\r\nidea of mascoting a poor young physician?” he inquired.\r\n\r\nJewel laughed in sympathy. She didn't quite understand him, but she knew\r\nthat they were having a very good time.\r\n\r\nPretty soon her companion drove in at the gate of an imposing old\r\nresidence, set back from the street where the trolley ran with an air of\r\nwithdrawing from the intrusion of these modern tracks.\r\n\r\n“I thought it wouldn't injure your conscience to wait for me while I\r\nmade a couple of professional visits, Jewel, eh?” he asked, as he jumped\r\nout and fastened Hector to the ring in the hand of a bronze boy. “I\r\nwon't be any longer than I can help, and don't you go to hoodooing me,\r\nnow, while I'm upstairs.” The doctor returned to the buggy and took the\r\nblack case, frowning warningly at the child. “I have troubles enough\r\nhere without that. This old lady used to trot me on her knee, and she\r\nwants to spend half an hour every morning proving that doctors don't\r\nknow anything before she'll let me get to business.”\r\n\r\n“It must be hard for doctors,” returned Jewel, “going to sorry people\r\nall the time, and nothing to give them except something on their\r\ntongues.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard gave his small companion a quick glance. If he secretly\r\nconsidered her beliefs as too richly absurd to excite aught but\r\namusement, she evidently as honestly compassionated the poverty of ideas\r\nin his learned profession.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'll hurry,” he said, and vanished within the house. Time would\r\nnot have dragged for Jewel had he stayed all the morning. To sit in the\r\nshining buggy in close proximity to the dappled gray Hector, and with\r\nAnna Belle for a sympathizer, caused the minutes to be winged.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor returned, a radiant face welcomed him.\r\n\r\n“I thought I should never get away,” he sighed, “but you don't look\r\nbored.”\r\n\r\nHe untied the horse, jumped into the buggy, and they were off again,\r\nHector striding along as if to make up for lost time. “Now only one more\r\ncall, Jewel, and then we'll get back out of the dust again,” said the\r\ndoctor cheerily.\r\n\r\n“I haven't noticed any dust, Dr. Ballard. I'm having the most _fun_!”\r\n\r\n“Well now, I'm glad of that. It's a great thing to be eight years old,\r\nJewel.”\r\n\r\n“That's what cousin Eloise says. She says she'd like to be.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? How is the enchanting--excuse me--I mean the enchanted maiden\r\nthis morning?”\r\n\r\n“She's well. She ties my bows now, so grandpa doesn't have to.”\r\n\r\n“Ties your--” The doctor looked at the speaker, mystified.\r\n\r\nJewel put her hand up to the small billows of silk behind her ear. “My\r\nhair bows. They were real hard for grandpa to do.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard repressed a guffaw, and then turned solemn. “Do you mean to\r\nsay that Mr. Evringham tied your hair ribbons?”\r\n\r\n“Why yes.”\r\n\r\n“That settles it, Jewel. You must go into partnership with me and wave\r\nwands and things. Setting Essex Maid on her legs wasn't a patch on\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nJewel regarded him questioningly a moment and then repeated, “But it was\r\nreal hard for grandpa.”\r\n\r\n“I can believe it!”\r\n\r\n“And cousin Eloise is the kindest girl. She's like grandpa about that.\r\nHer kindness is inside, too.”\r\n\r\n“Is it indeed? You don't know how much I thank you for telling me where\r\nto look for it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she must be kind to _you_, Dr. Ballard!”\r\n\r\n“Once in a while, once in a while,” he replied cautiously, but Jewel\r\ncouldn't get a look into his eyes, though she tried, he was so busily\r\nengaged poking an invisible fly from Hector's side with the point of the\r\nwhip. “If you'll find a way to make her kind to me all the time, Jewel,\r\nthen you will be my mascot indeed.”\r\n\r\n“All you have to do is to know she is,” replied the child earnestly.\r\n“I felt the way you do, at first, but now I've found out just because I\r\nstopped being afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that's the recipe, eh? All I've to do is to stop being afraid.”\r\n\r\n“That's all!” cried Jewel, beaming at his ready comprehension. “You'll\r\nfind out there isn't a thing to be afraid of with Cousin Eloise, and\r\noh, Dr. Ballard,” the child smiled at him wistfully, “she's getting\r\nso--so--unenchanted.”\r\n\r\n“You just waved your wand, I suppose, and said 'Presto change,'”\r\n returned the young man.\r\n\r\nHe turned Hector down a side street and drew rein under a large elm.\r\n“Here's my rheumatic gentleman,” he added, as he jumped from the buggy\r\nand fastened the horse. “He won't keep me waiting while he abuses\r\ndoctors, so I shan't be quite so long this time.” The speaker seized his\r\ncase and went up a garden path to the house, and Jewel, with a luxurious\r\nsigh, set Anna Belle in the place he had vacated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nBY THE BROOKSIDE\r\n\r\nScarcely had she seen the doctor admitted and the house door closed when\r\nan approaching pedestrian caught her eye. She recognized him at\r\nonce, and a little more color stole into her round cheeks, while an\r\nunconscious smile touched her lips.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman had observed the doctor enter the house, and glanced idly\r\nas he passed, to see what child was waiting in the buggy. The half shy\r\nlook of recognition which he met surprised him. Somewhere he had seen\r\nthat rosy face. Going on his way and searching his memory he had left\r\nthe buggy behind, when in a flash it came to him how, one day, that same\r\nshy, pleased smile had beamed wistfully upon him in a trolley car.\r\n\r\nInstantly he turned back, and in a minute Jewel saw him standing beside\r\nher. He lifted his hat and replaced it as he held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“We've met before, haven't we?” he asked kindly.\r\n\r\nJewel shook hands with him, much pleased. “My mother and father have\r\ngone to Europe,” she said “and it seemed as if there wasn't a Scientist\r\nin the whole world until I saw you.”\r\n\r\n“Another proof of what I always say--that we should all wear the pin. I\r\ndidn't know that Dr. Ballard had any Science relations.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dr. Ballard and I are not relations,” explained Jewel seriously.\r\n“I think he wants to marry my cousin Eloise; but he hasn't ever said so,\r\nand I don't like to ask him. He's the kindest man. I just love him, and\r\nhe's letting me ride around with him while he makes calls.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that's very nice, I'm sure,” returned Mr. Reeves, smiling broadly.\r\n“Does he know that you're a Christian Scientist?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, indeed. I had a claim, and my grandpa called him to help me,\r\nso then I told him, but he kept on reflecting love just the same.”\r\n\r\nMr. Reeves scented an interesting experience, but he would not question\r\nthe child. “Nice fellow, Guy Ballard. He deserves a better fate than to\r\nbow down to false gods all his days.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” returned Jewel heartily.\r\n\r\n“But, as you say,” continued Mr. Reeves, “he reflects love, and so we\r\nshall hear of his being a successful physician.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I want him to be always happy,” said the child.\r\n\r\n“Who is your grandfather, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Evringham.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible? Then you are--whose child?”\r\n\r\n“My father's name is Harry.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course.” Mr. Reeves nodded, trying to conceal his\r\nsurprise. “And is he a Scientist now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my mother is teaching him to be.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I'm sure I'm very glad to hear this. Your grandfather is not\r\nunkindly disposed toward Science?”\r\n\r\n“My grandfather couldn't be unkind to anything! I thought you knew him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Reeves smoothed his mustache vigorously. “I thought I did,” he\r\nreturned. “You spoke of your cousin. I knew your aunt and cousin were\r\nwith Mr. Evringham now. Well, I'm glad, I'm sure, that you are so\r\npleasantly situated. You must come to our little hall some Sunday\r\nwhere we have service, you know. It will be rather different from your\r\nbeautiful churches in Chicago.”\r\n\r\n“But I'd love to come,” replied the child eagerly. “I didn't know there\r\nwas one here. I'll get grandpa to bring me.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Evringham!” The speaker could feel the tendency of his jaw to drop.\r\n\r\n“Yes, or else cousin Eloise. She helps me get the lesson every day, and\r\nthen she takes my book and reads and reads. She told me this morning she\r\nread almost all last night.”\r\n\r\nMr. Reeves nodded slowly once or twice. “Still they come,” he murmured\r\nmeditatively.\r\n\r\n“Would you--would you mind writing down where that hall is?” asked the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n“Certainly I will.” Mr. Reeves suited the action to the word, taking\r\nan envelope from his pocket for the purpose. “And if I ever see\r\nMr. Evringham there”--he said slowly, “by the way, please tell your\r\ngrandfather that we met and had this chat.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know your name,” returned the child.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course. Pardon me. Reeves. Mr. Reeves. Can you remember that?”\r\n\r\nThe little girl flashed a bright look at him. “We can't forget,” she\r\nreminded him.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he nodded. “Exactly. I'm very likely younger in Science\r\nthan you are, little one. How long have you known about it?”\r\n\r\nJewel thought. “Seven years,” she replied.\r\n\r\nHer companion gave a laughing exclamation. “There, you see. I've known\r\nfor only one year. What is your name?”\r\n\r\n“Jewel Evringham.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Jewel, till we meet again, some Sunday soon, I hope.”\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, and Mr. Reeves went smiling on his way.\r\n\r\n“Seven years,” he reflected. “There's the simon pure article. She can't\r\nbe over nine. I'll wager Bel-Air Park has had its sensations of late.\r\nEvringham! The high ball, the billiard ball, and the race track, and\r\nnow the reputation of being a difficult old martinet. Never unkind to\r\nanything! Why, she's a little feminine Siegfried, that precious Jewel.\r\nBallard and the cousin, eh? I've heard that rumor.”\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Ballard returned to the buggy, Jewel began loquaciously telling\r\nhim of her pleasant experience.\r\n\r\n“And he knows you, Mr. Reeves does, and he said you were a nice fellow,”\r\n she finished, beaming.\r\n\r\n“Very civil of him, I'm sure,” returned the doctor as the horse started.\r\n“I distinctly remember his having a different opinion one night when he\r\ncaught me in his favorite cherry tree; but I don't yet understand the\r\nlevity of his behavior in scraping acquaintance with the young lady I\r\nleft unprotected in my buggy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we'd met before in a trolley car,” explained Jewel. “I wanted to\r\nrun right to him when I first saw that he was a Scientist.”\r\n\r\n“A what? Mr. Reeves? Oh, go 'way, my little mascot. Go 'way!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he had on the pin--this one, you know.” Jewel touched the small\r\ngold symbol, and Dr. Ballard examined it curiously. “So we smiled at\r\neach other, and to-day he's told me where I can come to church, and I'm\r\nnearly sure cousin Eloise will go with me.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard's eyes grew serious as he turned Hector's head toward the\r\npark. “I can scarcely believe it of Mr. Reeves,” he said.\r\n\r\n“He says you are too nice to bow down to false gods,” added Jewel shyly.\r\n\r\n“If mine are false to you, yours are false to me,” said the young man\r\nkindly. “You can understand that, can't you, Jewel?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can.”\r\n\r\n“And we should never quarrel over it, should we?” he went on.\r\n\r\n“No--o!” returned Jewel scornfully. “We'd get a pain.”\r\n\r\n“But you can see,” went on the young doctor seriously, “that the more we\r\ncared for one another the more we should regret such a wide difference\r\nof opinion.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” agreed the child, “and so we'd--”\r\n\r\n“You are going back to Chicago after a while, and so you understand that\r\nI can better afford to agree to differ with you than I could with some\r\none who was going to stay here--your cousin Eloise, for instance.”\r\n\r\nThe child looked at him in silence. She had never seen Dr. Ballard wear\r\nthis expression.\r\n\r\n“For this reason, Jewel, I want to ask you if you won't do me the favor\r\nnot to talk to your cousin about Christian Science, nor ask her to read\r\nyour books, nor to go to church with you.”\r\n\r\nThe child's countenance reflected his seriousness.\r\n\r\n“You can see, can't you, that if Miss Eloise should become much\r\ninterested in that fad it would spoil our pleasure in being together,\r\nwhile it lasted?”\r\n\r\nThe word fad was not in Jewel's vocabulary, but she grasped the doctor's\r\nmeaning, and understood that he was much in earnest. She felt very\r\nresponsible for the moment, and in doubt how to express herself.\r\n\r\n“I feel sort of mixed up, Dr. Ballard,” she returned after a minute's\r\nsilent perplexity. “You don't mind cousin Eloise reading the Bible, do\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You're glad if she can be happy instead of sorry, aren't you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nJewel looked at him hopefully. “There won't be anything worse than\r\nthat,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, many things worse,” he responded quickly. “You might do me that\r\nlittle favor, Jewel. I understand you go to her with your lessons, as\r\nyou call it, and your questions.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she helps me; but she takes my books to her room. I don't see how\r\nI can help it, Dr. Ballard.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he heaved a quiet sigh, “perhaps the attack will be shorter if\r\nit is sharp. We'll hope so.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't do any harm to you for anything,” said the child earnestly,\r\n“but you wait a little while. When people come into Christian Science\r\nit makes them twice as nice. If you see cousin Eloise get twice as nice\r\nyou'll be glad, won't you?”\r\n\r\nThe young man gave an impatient half laugh.\r\n\r\n“I'm not grasping,” he returned. “She does very well for me as she\r\nis. Now,” he turned again to the child, who rejoiced in the recovered\r\ntwinkle in his eyes, “you have my full permission to convert the error\r\nfairy.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, hush!” ejaculated Jewel, alarmed. “We mustn't hold that law over\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard laughed.\r\n\r\n“Convert her, I say. Let us see what she would be like if she were twice\r\nas nice. She's a very charming woman now, your aunt Madge. If she were\r\ntwice as nice--who knows? The fairy might spread wings and float away!”\r\n\r\nThey had entered the park and Jewel suddenly noted their surroundings.\r\n“We're coming to the Ravine of Happiness,” she said.\r\n\r\n“That's the way it's been looking to me ever since last evening,”\r\n responded her companion meditatively.\r\n\r\nThe child paid no attention to his words. She was watching eagerly for\r\nthe bend in the road beside which the gorge lay steepest.\r\n\r\n“There!” she said at last, resting her hand on that of her companion.\r\nObediently the doctor stopped his horse. The park was still but for\r\nthe bird notes, the laughter and babble of the brook far below, and the\r\nrustle of the fresh leaves, each one a transparency for a sunbeam.\r\n\r\nThe two were silent for a minute, Jewel's radiant eyes seeking the\r\npensive ones of her companion.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear?” she asked softly at last.\r\n\r\n“What?” he returned.\r\n\r\n“It is cousin Eloise's Spring Song.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor's words and looks remained in Jewel's mind after she reached\r\nhome that day. She mused concerning him while she was taking off Anna\r\nBelle's hat and jacket up in her own room.\r\n\r\n“I don't suppose you could understand much what he meant, dearie,” she\r\nsaid, her face very sober from stress of thought, “but I did. If I'd\r\nbeen as big as mother I could have helped him; but I knew I was too\r\nlittle, and when people don't understand, mother says it is so easy to\r\nmake mistakes in what you say to them.”\r\n\r\nAnna Belle's silence gave assent, and her sweet expression was always\r\na solace to Jewel, who kissed the hard roses in her cheeks repeatedly\r\nbefore she sat her in the big chair by the window and went down to\r\nlunch. Anna Belle's forced abstemiousness had ceased to afflict her.\r\nAt the lunch table she gave a vivacious account of the morning's\r\ndiversions, and for once Mrs. Evringham listened to what she said,\r\na curious expression on her face. This lady had expected to endure\r\nannoyance with this child on her grandfather's account; but for unkind\r\nfate to cause Jewel to be a hindrance and a marplot in the case of Dr.\r\nBallard was adding insult to injury.\r\n\r\nThe child, suddenly catching the expression of Mrs. Evringham's eyes as\r\nthey rested upon her, was startled, and ceased talking.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Madge does love me,” she declared mentally. “God's children love\r\none another every minute, every minute.”\r\n\r\n“So Mr. Reeves told you where you can go to church,” said Eloise,\r\nreplying to Jewel's last bit of information.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and”--the little girl was going on eagerly to suggest that her\r\ncousin accompany her, when suddenly Dr. Ballard's eyes seemed looking at\r\nher and repeating their protest.\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and ate for a time in silence. Mrs. Forbes paid little\r\nattention to what was being said. She moved about perfunctorily, with an\r\nair of preoccupation. She had a more serious trouble now than the care\r\nand intrusion of the belongings of Lawrence and Harry Evringham, a worry\r\nthat for days and nights had not ceased to gnaw at her heart, first as a\r\nsuspicion and afterward as a certainty.\r\n\r\nWhen luncheon was over, Eloise in leaving the dining-room, put her arm\r\naround Jewel's shoulders, and together they strolled through the hall\r\nand out upon the piazza.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham looked after them. “If only that child weren't a little\r\nfanatic and Eloise in such an erratic, wayward state, ready to seize\r\nupon anything novel, it would be all very well,” she mused, “for Dr.\r\nBallard seems to find Jewel amusing, and it might be a point of common\r\ninterest. As it is, if ever I wished any one in Jericho, it's that\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\nJewel, happy in the proximity of her lovely cousin, satisfied herself by\r\na glance that aunt Madge was not following.\r\n\r\nEloise looked about over the sunny, verdant landscape. “What a deceitful\r\nworld,” she said. “It looks so serene and easy to live in. So it was\r\nvery lovely over at your ravine this morning?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Jewel looked up at her with eager eyes. “Let's go. You haven't\r\nbeen there. It's only a little way. You don't need your hat, cousin\r\nEloise.”\r\n\r\nSummer was in the air. The girl was amused at the child's enthusiastic\r\ntone. “Very well,” she answered.\r\n\r\nJewel drew her on with an embracing arm, and they descended the steps\r\nand walked down the path.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the child stopped. “Doesn't it seem unkind to go without Anna\r\nBelle!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nonsense,” returned Eloise, smiling. “You're not going way upstairs\r\nto get her. We needn't tell her we went. She's been out driving all the\r\nmorning. I think it's my turn.”\r\n\r\nThe child looked happily up into her cousin's face. “I love to see you\r\nlaugh, cousin Eloise,” she returned, and they strolled on.\r\n\r\nThe park drives were deserted. The cousins reached the gorge without\r\nmeeting any one. Leaning upon the slender fence, they gazed down into\r\nthe green depths, and for a minute listened to the woodland melody.\r\n\r\n“Isn't it just like your Spring Song?” asked the child at last.\r\n\r\n“It is sweet and comforting and good,” replied the girl slowly, a\r\nfar-off look in her eyes.\r\n\r\nJewel lifted her shoulders. “Don't you want to get down there, cousin\r\nEloise?” she asked, her eyes sparkling.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the girl promptly.\r\n\r\n“Will it hurt your dress?” added Jewel, with a sudden memory of Mrs.\r\nForbes, as she looked over her cousin's immaculate black and white\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\n“I guess not,” laughed the girl. “Are you afraid Mrs. Forbes will put me\r\nto bed?”\r\n\r\nShe bent her lithe figure and was under the wire in a twinkling. Jewel\r\ncrept gleefully after her, but was careful to hold her little skirts\r\nout of harm's way as they climbed down the steep bank and at last rested\r\namong the ferns by the brook. Its louder babble seemed to welcome them.\r\nNature had been busy at her miracle working since the child's last\r\nvisit. Without moving she could have gathered a handful of little\r\nblossoms. Instead, she rolled over and kissed a near clump of violets.\r\n“You darling, darling things!” she said.\r\n\r\nEloise looked up through far boughs to the fleece-flecked sky.\r\n“Everything worth living for is right here, Jewel,” she said. “Let's\r\nhave a tent and not give any one our address.”\r\n\r\n“I think we ought to let Dr. Ballard come, don't you?”\r\n\r\n“Now why did you pick him out?” returned Eloise plaintively. She was\r\nresting her head against her clasped hands as she stretched herself\r\nagainst the incline of her verdant couch. Her companion did not reply at\r\nonce, and Eloise lazily turned her head to where she could view the eyes\r\nfixed upon her.\r\n\r\n“What are you thinking of, Jewel?”\r\n\r\n“I was just thinking that if my mother made you a thin green dress that\r\nswept around you all long and narrow, you'd look like a flower, too.”\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled back at the sky. “That's very nice. You can think those\r\nthoughts all you please.”\r\n\r\n“That wasn't all, though, because I was thinking about Dr. Ballard.\r\nHe feels sorry. I couldn't tell you about it at lunch, because aunt\r\nMadge--well, because--”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Eloise quietly. “It is better for us to be alone.”\r\n\r\nJewel's brow relaxed. “Yes,” she said contentedly, “in the Ravine of\r\nHappiness.”\r\n\r\n“Look out, though,” continued the girl in the same quiet tone and\r\nlooking back at the sky. “Look out what you say here. It is easy now\r\nto feel that all is harmonious, and that discords do not exist. I think\r\neven if grandfather appeared I could talk with him peacefully.”\r\n\r\n“I have thought about it,” returned the child, “and it seems hard to\r\nknow what to say; but I love you and Dr. Ballard both, so it will be\r\nsure to come out right. He feels sorry if you are beginning to like to\r\nstudy Christian Science.”\r\n\r\n“Really, did he speak of that to you? I think he might have chosen a man\r\nof his size.”\r\n\r\n“Of course he spoke of it when he found out I wanted to ask you to take\r\nme to our church.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the church here?” Eloise abandoned her lazy tone.\r\n\r\n“They have a hall. Mr. Reeves wrote it down for me. Do you really care,\r\ncousin Eloise? You've been so kind and helped me, but do you really\r\nbegin to care?”\r\n\r\n“Care? Who could help caring, if it is true? I've been reading some of\r\nthe tales of cures in your magazine. If those people tell the truth”--\r\n\r\n“Why, cousin Eloise!” The child's shocked eyes recalled the girl's\r\nself-centred thoughts.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, dear. It was rude to say that. I'm not ill, Jewel.\r\nI'm so well and strong that--I've sometimes wished I wasn't, but life\r\nturned petty and disgusting to me. I resented everything. It is just as\r\nwonderful and radiant a star of hope to read that there is a sure way\r\nout of my tangle as if I had consumption and was promised a cure of\r\nthat. I don't yet exactly believe it, but I don't disbelieve it. All I\r\nknow is I want to read, read, read all the time. I was just thinking a\r\nminute ago that if we had the books here it would be perfect. This is\r\nthe sort of place where it would be easiest to see that only the good\r\nis the real, and that the unsubstantiality of everything evil can be\r\nproved.”\r\n\r\nJewel gave her head a little shake. “Just think of poor Dr. Ballard\r\nbeing afraid to have you believe that.”\r\n\r\n“But who wouldn't be afraid to believe it, who wouldn't!” exclaimed the\r\ngirl vehemently.\r\n\r\n“Why, I've always known it, cousin Eloise,” returned the child simply.\r\n\r\n“You dear baby. You haven't lived long. I don't want to climb into a\r\nfool's paradise only to fall out with a dull thud.”\r\n\r\nJewel looked at her, grasping as well as she could her meaning. “I know\r\nI'm only a little girl; but if you should go to church with me,” she\r\nsaid, “you'd see a lot of grown-up people who know it's true. Then we\r\ncould go on Wednesday evenings and hear them tell what Christian Science\r\nhas done for them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I'm sure I shouldn't like that,” responded Eloise quickly. “How can\r\nthey bear to tell!”\r\n\r\n“They don't think it's right not to. There are lots of other people\r\nbesides you that are sorry and need to learn the truth.”\r\n\r\nThe rebuke was so innocent and, withal, so direct, that honest Eloise\r\nturned toward Jewel and made an impulsive grasp toward her, capturing\r\nnothing but the edge of the child's dress, which she held firmly.\r\n\r\n“You're right, Jewel. I'm a selfish, thin-skinned creature,” she\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nThe little girl shook her head. “You've got to stop thinking you are,\r\nyou know,” she answered. “You have to know that the error Eloise isn't\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“That's mortal mind, I suppose,” returned Eloise, smiling at the sound\r\nof the phrase.\r\n\r\n“I should think it was! Old thing! Always trying to cheat us!” said\r\nJewel. “All that you have to do is to remember every minute that God's\r\nchild must be manifested. He inherits every good and perfect thing, and\r\nhas dominion over every belief of everything else.”\r\n\r\nEloise stared at her in wonder. “Do you know what you've talking about,\r\nyou little thing, when you use all those long words?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Don't you?” asked the child. “Oh, listen!” for a bird suddenly\r\npoured a wild strain of melody from the treetop.\r\n\r\n“And just think,” said Jewel presently, in a soft, awestruck tone, “that\r\nsome people wear birds sewed on their hats, just as if they were glad\r\nsomething was dead!”\r\n\r\n“It _is_ weird,” agreed Eloise. “I never liked it. Jewel, did Dr.\r\nBallard blame you because I am interested in Christian Science?”\r\n\r\n“He said he wished I wouldn't talk to you and go to church and\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\nThe girl bit a blade of grass and eyed the child's serious face.\r\n\r\n“Well, what are you going to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“I asked God to show me. I wish Dr. Ballard would study with you.”\r\n\r\n“That is impossible. He has spent years learning his science, and he\r\nloves it and is proud of it; so what next?”\r\n\r\n“Very queer things happen sometimes,” rejoined Jewel doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“But not so queer as that would be,” returned Eloise.\r\n\r\nJewel was pondering. This was very delicate ground, and she still felt\r\nsome awe of her cousin; however, there was only one thing to consider.\r\n\r\n“Do you love him better than anybody, cousin Eloise?” she asked.\r\n\r\nA flood of color warmed the girl's face, but she had to smile.\r\n\r\n“Would that make the difference?” she asked. “Mustn't we want the truth\r\nanyway?”\r\n\r\nJewel heaved a mighty sigh. She was thinking of Dr. Ballard's pensive\r\neyes. “I should _think_ so,” she answered frankly; “because if you just\r\nstudy the truth, and hold on tight, how can things be anything but\r\nhappy at last? I wish I was more grown up, cousin Eloise,” she added\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n“Oh no, no,” answered the girl, with a little catch in her throat. “I've\r\nhad so much of grown-up people, Jewel! I'm so grown up myself! Just\r\na little while ago I was a schoolgirl, busy and happy all the time. I\r\nnever even went out anywhere except with father, and with Nat when he\r\nwas at home from college. You don't know Nat, but you'd like him.”\r\n\r\n“Why! Is he a Christian Scientist?”\r\n\r\nFor answer Eloise laughed low but heartily. “Nat a Christian Scientist!”\r\n she mused aloud. “Not exactly, my little cousin!”\r\n\r\n“Then should I like him as well as Dr. Ballard?” asked Jewel\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n“I don't know. Tastes differ.”\r\n\r\n“Does he like horses?” asked the child.\r\n\r\n“He knows everything about a horse and a yacht except how to pay for\r\nthem, poor boy,” returned Eloise.\r\n\r\n“Is he poor?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is poor and expensive. It is a bad combination; it is almost\r\nas bad as being poor and extravagant. His mother is a widow, and\r\nthey haven't much, but what there was she has insisted on spending on\r\nhim--that is, all she could spare from the doctor's bills.”\r\n\r\n“She needs Science then, doesn't she?”\r\n\r\n“Jewel, that would be one thing that would keep me from wanting to be\r\na Scientist. What's the fun of being one unless everybody else is? My\r\nmother, for instance.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but then you'd find out how to help her.”\r\n\r\nEloise glanced at the child curiously. She thought it would be\r\ninteresting to peep into Jewel's mind and see her estimate of Aunt\r\nMadge.\r\n\r\n“My mother has a great deal to trouble her,” she said loyally.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know she thinks she has,” returned the child.\r\n\r\nAgain her response surprised her companion.\r\n\r\n“I'll take you as you are, Jewel,” she said. “I'm glad you're not grown\r\nup. You're fresher from the workshop.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nAN EFFORT FOR TRUTH\r\n\r\nWhen Eloise spoke in the ravine of talking with her grandfather, it was\r\nbecause for a few days she had been trying to make up her mind to an\r\ninterview with him. A fortnight ago she would have felt this to be\r\nimpossible; but subtle changes had been going on in herself, and, she\r\nthought, in him. If her mother would undertake the interview now and\r\ntake that stand with Mr. Evringham which Eloise felt that self-respect\r\ndemanded, the girl would gladly escape it; but there was no prospect\r\nof such a thing. Mrs. Evringham was only too glad to benefit by her\r\nfather-in-law's modified mood, to glide along the surface of things\r\nand wait--Eloise knew it, knew it every day, in moments when her cheeks\r\nflushed hot--for Dr. Ballard to throw the handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThe girl wished to talk with Mr. Evringham without her mother's\r\nknowledge, and the prospect was a dreaded ordeal. She felt that they had\r\nwon his contempt, and she feared the loss of her own self-control when\r\nshe should come to touch upon the sore spots.\r\n\r\n“What would you do, Jewel,” she asked the next morning, after they had\r\nread the lesson; “what would you do if you were afraid of somebody?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't be,” returned the child quickly.\r\n\r\n“Well, I am. Now what am I going to do about it?”\r\n\r\nAnna Belle, who always gave unwinking attention to the lesson, was in\r\nJewel's lap, and the child twisted out the in-turning morocco foot as\r\nshe spoke.\r\n\r\n“Why, I'd know that one thought of God couldn't be afraid of another,”\r\n she replied in the conclusive tone to which Eloise could never grow\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jewel, child,” the girl said impatiently, “we'd be sorry to think\r\nmost of the people we know are thoughts of God.”\r\n\r\n“That's because you get the error man mixed up with the real one. Mother\r\nexplains that to me when we ride in cable cars and places where we see\r\nerror people with sorry faces. There's a real man, a real thought of\r\nGod, behind every one of them; and when you remember to think right\r\nabout people every minute, you are doing them good. Did you say you're\r\nafraid of somebody?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and that somebody is a man whom I must talk to.”\r\n\r\n“Then begin right away to know every minute that the real man isn't\r\nanybody to be afraid of, for God made him, and God has only loving\r\nthoughts; and of course you must be loving all the time. It'll be just\r\nas _easy_ by the time you come to it, cousin Eloise!”\r\n\r\nThe girl often asked herself in these days why she should begin to\r\nfeel unreasonably hopeful and lighter hearted. Her mother no longer\r\ncomplained of her moods. Mrs. Evringham laid the becoming change in her\r\ndaughter's expression to the girl's happiness in discovering that she\r\ndid reciprocate Dr. Ballard's evident sentiments.\r\n\r\n“Eloise is so high minded,” thought the mother complacently. “She\r\nwould never be satisfied to marry for convenience, like so many;” and\r\nconsidering herself passingly astute, she let well enough alone, ceased\r\nto bring the physician's name into every conversation, and bided her\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOne morning Mr. Evringham, coming out of the house to go to town, met\r\nEloise on the piazza.\r\n\r\n“You are down early,” he said as he greeted her, and was passing on to\r\nthe carriage.\r\n\r\n“Just one minute, grandfather!” she exclaimed, and how her heart beat.\r\nHe turned his erect form in some surprise, and his cold eyes met the\r\ngirlish ones.\r\n\r\n“She's a stunning creature,” he thought, as the sunlight bathed her\r\nyoung beauty; but his face was impenetrable, and Eloise nerved herself.\r\n\r\n“Were you thinking of going golfing this afternoon?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you said something about it at dinner last evening. Would you\r\nlet me go with you?”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham, much astonished, raised his eyebrows and took off the hat\r\nwhich he had replaced.\r\n\r\n“Such a request from youth and beauty is a command,” he returned with a\r\nslight bow.\r\n\r\nTears sprang to the girl's eyes. “Don't make fun of me, grandfather!”\r\n she exclaimed impulsively.\r\n\r\n“Not for worlds,” he returned. “You will do the laughing when you see me\r\ndrive. My hand seems to have lost its cunning this spring. Shall we say\r\nfour-thirty? Very well. Good-morning.”\r\n\r\n“Now what's all this?” mused Mr. Evringham as he drove to the station.\r\n“Has another granddaughter fallen in love with me? Methinks not. What is\r\nshe after? Does she want to get away from Ballard? Methinks not, again.\r\nShe's going to ask me for something probably. Egad, if she does, I think\r\nI'll turn her over to Jewel.”\r\n\r\nEloise's eyes were bright during the lesson that morning.\r\n\r\n“It's to-day, Jewel,” she said, “that I'm going to talk with that man\r\nI'm afraid of.”\r\n\r\n“Never say that again,” returned the child vehemently. “You are not\r\nafraid. There's no one to be afraid of. Do you want me to handle it for\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Jewel?”\r\n\r\n“To declare the truth for you.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean give me a treatment for it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Do you know that seems very funny to me, Jewel?”\r\n\r\n“It seems funny to me that you are afraid, when God made you, and the\r\nman, and all of us, and there's nothing but goodness and love in the\r\nuniverse. Fear is the belief of evil. Do you want to believe evil?”\r\n\r\n“No, I hate to,” returned Eloise promptly.\r\n\r\n“Then you go away, cousin Eloise, and I will handle the case for you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, are you going golfing?” said Mrs. Evringham that afternoon to her\r\ndaughter. “Do put on your white duck, dear.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I intend to. I'm going with grandfather.”\r\n\r\n“You are?” in extremest surprise. “Oh, wear your dark skirt, dear; it's\r\nplenty good enough. Do you mean to say he asked you, Eloise?”\r\n\r\n“No, I asked him.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham stood in silent amaze, her brain working alertly. She\r\neven watched her daughter don the immaculate white golf suit, and made\r\nno further protest.\r\n\r\nWhat was in the girl's mind? When finally from her window she saw the\r\ntwo enter the brougham, Mr. Evringham carrying his granddaughter's\r\nclubs, she smiled a knowing smile and nodded her head.\r\n\r\n“I do believe I've wronged Eloise,” she thought. “How foolish it was to\r\nworry. I've been wondering how in the world I was going to get father to\r\ngive her a wedding, and how I was going to get her to accept it, and\r\nnow look! That child has thought of the same thing, and will manage it a\r\nhundred times better than I could.”\r\n\r\nJewel stood on the steps and waved her hand as the brougham rolled away.\r\nEloise had seized and squeezed her surreptitiously in the hall before\r\nthey came out.\r\n\r\n“I do feel braced up, Jewel. Thank you,” she whispered hurriedly.\r\n\r\n“Is the man over at the golf links?” asked the child, surprised to see\r\nthat Eloise and her grandfather were going out together.\r\n\r\n“He will be by the time I get there,” returned the girl.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the carriage door had closed and they had started, Eloise\r\nspoke. “You must think it very strange that I asked this of you,\r\ngrandfather.”\r\n\r\nThere was a hint of violets clinging to the fresh white garments that\r\nbrushed Mr. Evringham's knee.\r\n\r\n“I would not question the gifts the gods provide;” he returned.\r\n\r\nShe seemed able to rise above the fear of his sarcasms. “Not that\r\nyou would be surprised at anything mother or I might ask of you,” she\r\ncontinued bravely, “but I have suffered, I'm sure, as much as you have\r\nduring the last two months.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? I regret to hear that.”\r\n\r\nIf there was a sting in this reply, Eloise refused to recognize it.\r\n\r\n“In fact I have felt so much that it has made it impossible hitherto to\r\nsay anything, but Jewel has given me courage.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham smoothed his mustache. “She has plenty to spare,” he\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n“She says,” went on Eloise, “that everything that isn't love is hate;\r\nand hate, of course, in her category is unreal. It is because I want the\r\nreal things, because I long for real things, for truth, that I asked to\r\nhave this talk, grandfather, and I wanted to be quite alone with you, so\r\nI thought of this way.”\r\n\r\n“It's the mater she's running away from, then,” reflected her companion.\r\nHe nodded courteously. “I am at your disposal,” he returned.\r\n\r\nSubtly the broker's feeling toward Eloise had been changing since the\r\nevening in which Jewel wrote to her parents. His hard and fast opinion\r\nof her had been slightly shaken. The frankness of her remarks on\r\nChristian Science in the presence of Dr. Ballard the other evening had\r\nbeen a surprise to him. The cold, proud, noncommittal, ease-loving girl\r\nwho in his opinion had decided to marry the young doctor was either less\r\ndesigning than he had believed, or else wonderfully certain of her own\r\npower to hold him. He found himself regarding her with new interest.\r\n\r\n“I've been waiting for mother to talk with you,” she went on, “and clear\r\nup our position; but she does not, and so I must.” The speaker's hands\r\nwere tightly clasped in her lap. “I wish I had Jewel's unconsciousness,\r\nher certainty that all is Good, for I feel--I feel shame before you,\r\ngrandfather.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Mr. Evringham that Jewel's eyes were appealing to him.\r\n\r\n“She says,” he returned with a rather grim smile, “Jewel avers that I am\r\nkindness itself inside. Let us admit it for convenience now, and see if\r\nyou can't speak freely.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. You know what I am ashamed of: staying here so long;\r\nimposing upon you; taking everything for granted when we have no right.\r\nI want to understand our affairs; to know if we have anything, and what\r\nit is; to have you help me, _you_; to have you tell me how we can\r\nlive independently, and help me to make mother agree to it. Oh, if you\r\nwould--if you _could_ be my friend, grandfather. I need you so!”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham received this impetuous outburst without change of\r\ncountenance. “How about Ballard?” he said. “I thought he was going to\r\nsettle all this.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the brougham. The flash of hurt in the girl's eyes\r\nwas quenched by quick tears. Her companion reddened under the look of\r\nsurprise she bent upon him, her lovely lips unsteady.\r\n\r\n“No offense,” he added hastily. “Ballard's sentiments are evident\r\nenough, and he is a fine fellow.”\r\n\r\nEloise controlled herself. “Will you take the trouble to explain our\r\naffairs to me?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” responded Mr. Evringham quickly. “I wish for your sake\r\nthere was more to explain, more possibilities in the case.”\r\n\r\n“We have nothing?” exclaimed the girl acutely.\r\n\r\n“Your father took heavy chances and lost. His affairs are nearly\r\nsettled, and what there is left is small indeed.” The speaker cast a\r\nquick glance at the girl beside him. She had caught her lip between\r\nher teeth. Jewel's soft voice sounded in his ears. “Cousin Eloise feels\r\nsorry because she isn't your real relation.” An inkling of what the girl\r\nmight suffer came to him.\r\n\r\n“Your mother and you have a claim upon me,” he went on. “I should\r\ncertainly feel a responsibility of all my son's debts, and the one to\r\nhis wife and daughter in particular. I will try to make the situation\r\neasier for you in some way.”\r\n\r\n“Manage for us to go away, grandfather. Haven't you a little house\r\nsomewhere?”\r\n\r\nThe beseeching in her tone surprised Mr. Evringham still more. What did\r\nthe girl mean? Didn't she intend to marry Ballard? He had believed her\r\nto be planning to preside in the Mountain Avenue mansion.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it can be arranged, certainly,” he answered vaguely; “but there's\r\nno hurry, Eloise,” he added, in the kindest tone he had ever used toward\r\nher. “Some evening we will go over the affairs, and I will show you\r\nwhere your mother stands financially, and we will try to make some plan\r\nthat shall be satisfactory.”\r\n\r\nEloise gave him a grateful look, as much in response to his manner as to\r\nhis words. “Thank you. The present condition is certainly--error,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Well, we'll try to find harmony,” replied the other. “Jewel would say\r\nit was easy. I should like to have you remain at my house at least as\r\nlong as she does, Eloise. I should probably have to tie her hair ribbons\r\nagain if you went.”\r\n\r\nThe two found themselves smiling at each other. The atmosphere was\r\nlightened, and the brougham drew up at the clubhouse.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham handed out the girl, gave Zeke the order to return for\r\nthem, and they went up the steps.\r\n\r\n“I would drive back with him, grandfather, only that mother would\r\nwonder, and ask questions,” said Eloise. “Don't let me detain you in any\r\nway. I'll just sit here on the piazza.”\r\n\r\n“Not play? Nonsense!” returned Mr. Evringham brusquely.\r\n\r\n“Please don't feel obliged”--Eloise began humbly.\r\n\r\n“But I can't help being obliged if you'll play with me,” interrupted her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nSome men observed the confidential attitude of the broker and the\r\nbeautiful girl. “What's doing over there?” asked one. “Is Evringham\r\nbeginning to take notice?”\r\n\r\n“Why, don't you know?” returned the other. “That's his granddaughter.”\r\n\r\n“His daughter, do you mean? Didn't know he had one.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it. She's Lawrence's stepdaughter.”\r\n\r\nThe other shook his head. “That's too involved for me. She's a queen,\r\nanyway.”\r\n\r\n“Going to marry Ballard, they say.”\r\n\r\n“That so? Then I won't go up and fall on Evringham's neck. My bank book\r\nisn't in Ballard's class. She can play, too,” as he observed Eloise\r\nmake a drive while she waited the reappearance of her companion from\r\nthe clubhouse. “Isn't that a bird!--and say, there's young Lochinvar\r\nhimself!” for here a light automobile whizzed briskly up to the\r\nclubhouse.\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard sprang out, for he had recognized the figure at the first\r\nteeing ground.\r\n\r\n“You gave me the slip!” he cried as he approached.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I just went with a handsomer man,” returned Eloise, smiling, as\r\nthey shook hands.\r\n\r\n“I didn't know I could come until the last minute, then I went to the\r\nhouse for you and found I had missed you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham and the caddy approached. “I cut you out for once,\r\nBallard,” he said. “Well, we're off, Eloise. I saw you drive. I doubt if\r\nhe catches us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJewel's eyes questioned Eloise that evening when she reached home,\r\nand she received the smiling, significant nod her cousin gave her with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nIt was an apparently united family party that gathered about the\r\ndinner table. Mr. Evringham and Eloise discussed their game, while Mrs.\r\nEvringham fairly rustled with complacence.\r\n\r\nAs Jewel clung to her grandfather's neck that evening in bidding him\r\ngood-night, she whispered:--\r\n\r\n“How happy we all are!”\r\n\r\n“Are we, really? Well now, that's very gratifying, I'm sure. Good-night,\r\nJewel.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nIN THE HARNESS ROOM\r\n\r\n“Mother, can I have three dollars?” asked Eloise the next morning.\r\n\r\n“Were you thinking of a new riding hat, dear? I do wish you had it to\r\nwear this afternoon. Yours is shabby, certainly, but you can't get it\r\nfor that, child.”\r\n\r\n“No; I was thinking of a copy of 'Science and Health.' I don't like to\r\ntake Jewel's any longer, and I'm convinced.”\r\n\r\n“What of--sin?” asked Mrs. Evringham in dismay.\r\n\r\n“No, just the opposite--that there needn't be any. The book teaches the\r\ntruth. I know it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, whether it does or doesn't, you haven't any three dollars to\r\nspend for a book, Eloise,” was the firm reply. “The _idea_, when I can\r\nbarely rake and scrape enough together to keep us presentable!”\r\n\r\n“Where do you get our money?” asked the girl.\r\n\r\n“Father gives me a check every fortnight. Of course you know that he has\r\ncharge of our affairs.”\r\n\r\nEloise's serene expression did not change. She looked at the little\r\nblack book in her hand. “This edition costs five dollars,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Scandalous!” exclaimed Mrs. Evringham. “I can tell you this is no time\r\nfor us to be collecting _editions de luxe_. Wait till you're married.”\r\n\r\n“I'm going to run in town for a while this morning, mother.”\r\n\r\n“You are? Well don't get belated. You know that you are to ride with Dr.\r\nBallard at half past four. Dear me,” her brow drawn, “you ought to have\r\nthat hat. Now I think that I _could_ get on without that jet bolero.”\r\n\r\nEloise laughed softly and drew her mother to her. “Have your jet bolero,\r\ndear,” she answered. “My hat isn't bad.”\r\n\r\nEloise went to her room, and closing the door, took from one of her\r\ndrawers a box. It contained her girlish treasures, the ornaments and\r\njewels her father had given her from time to time. She took out a small\r\ndiamond ring and pressed it to her lips.\r\n\r\n“Dear papa! I love it because you gave it to me, but I can get with it a\r\nwonderful thing, a truth which, if we had known it, would have saved you\r\nall those torturing hours, would have saved your dear life. I know how\r\ngladly you would have me get it now, for you are learning it too; and it\r\nwill be your gift, dear, _dear_ papa, your gift just the same.”\r\n\r\nJewel had to study the lesson with only Anna Belle's assistance that\r\nmorning, but she received the third letter from her mother and father.\r\nTheir trip was proving a success from the standpoints of both business\r\nand pleasure, but their chief longing was to get back to their little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nIt was very like visiting with them to read it over, and Jewel did so\r\nmore than once. “I'll show it to cousin Eloise as soon as she comes\r\nhome,” she reflected. Then she dressed Anna Belle to go out.\r\n\r\nRunning downstairs the child sought and found Mrs. Forbes in the\r\nkitchen. The housekeeper no longer questioned her going and coming,\r\nalthough she still considered herself in the light of the child's only\r\ndisciplinarian, and was vigilant to watch for errors of omission and\r\ncommission, and quick to correct them.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Forbes, may I have an old kitchen knife?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. You'll cut yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I want it to dig up plants.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes stared down at her. “Why, you mustn't do any such thing.”\r\n\r\n“I mean wild flowers for a garden that Anna Belle and I are going to\r\nmake.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. I'll see if I can't find you a trowel.”\r\n\r\nThere was one at hand, and as the housekeeper passed it to the child she\r\nwarned her:--\r\n\r\n“Be careful you don't make a mistake, now, and get hold of anybody's\r\nplants. What did your cousin Eloise go to New York for?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know.”\r\n\r\n“Well I hope it's for her trousseau.”\r\n\r\nJewel smiled. “My mother makes those.”\r\n\r\n“I don't believe she'll ever make one for you, then,” returned Mrs.\r\nForbes, but not ill-naturedly. She laughed, glancing at Sarah, who stood\r\nby.\r\n\r\n“But I think she will for Anna Belle,” returned Jewel brightly, “when\r\nshe gets older.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper and maid both laughed. “Run along,” said Mrs. Forbes,\r\n“and don't you be late for lunch.”\r\n\r\n“She's an awful sweet child,” said Sarah half reproachfully. “Just the\r\nspirit of sunshine.”\r\n\r\n“Oh well, they'd turn her head here if it wasn't for me,” answered the\r\nother complacently.\r\n\r\nJewel was not late to lunch, but eating it tete-a-tete with aunt Madge\r\nwas not to her taste.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham utilized the opportunity to admonish her, and Mrs. Forbes\r\nfor once sympathized with the widow's sentiments.\r\n\r\nAunt Madge took off her eyeglasses in a way she had when she wished to\r\nbe particularly impressive.\r\n\r\n“Jewel,” she said, “I don't think any one has told you that it is\r\nimpolite to Dr. Ballard to say anything about Christian Science in his\r\npresence.”\r\n\r\n“Why is it?” asked the child.\r\n\r\n“Because he is a learned physician, and has, of course, a great respect\r\nfor his profession.”\r\n\r\n“I have a great respect for him,” returned the child, “and he knows I\r\nwouldn't hurt his feelings.”\r\n\r\n“The idea!” exclaimed Mrs. Evringham, looking down from a height upon\r\nthe flaxen head. “As if a little ignorant girl could hurt the feelings\r\nof a man like Dr. Ballard!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes also stared at the child, and she winced.\r\n\r\n“I do love them, and they do love me,” she thought. “I don't remember\r\never speaking about it before the doctor unless somebody asked me,” she\r\nsaid aloud.\r\n\r\n“Your cousin Eloise may ask you,” returned Mrs. Evringham. “Nobody else\r\nwould. She does it in a spirit of mischief, perhaps, but I shall speak\r\nto her. She has a passing curiosity about your ideas because it is odd\r\nand rather amusing to find a child who has such unnatural and precocious\r\nfancies, and she tries to draw you out; but it will not last with her.\r\nNeither will it with you, probably. You seem to be a sensible little\r\ngirl in many ways.” Mrs. Evringham made the addition magnanimously. She\r\nreally was too much at peace with all the world just now to like to be\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nOutwardly Jewel was silent. Inwardly she was declaring many things which\r\nwould have surprised her companions.\r\n\r\n“Does your cousin Eloise pretend to you that she is becoming seriously\r\ninterested in your faith?” pursued Mrs. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“She will tell you all about it,” returned Jewel.\r\n\r\nAunt Madge shrugged her shoulders and laughed a little. Her thoughts\r\nreverted to her daughter's trip to the city. She had wondered\r\nseveral times if it had any pleasant connection with her sudden good\r\nunderstanding with Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\nTo Jewel's relief her thoughts remained preoccupied during the remainder\r\nof the meal; and as soon as the child could leave, she flew to the\r\ncloset under the stairs, where Anna Belle often went into retreat during\r\nthe luncheon hour, and from thence back to the garden she was making by\r\nthe brookside.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to the house her eyes lighted as she saw two horses\r\nbefore the piazza, and Dr. Ballard standing beside one of them.\r\n\r\n“How are you, Jewel?” he asked, as she danced up to him smiling.\r\nStooping, he lifted her into the side saddle, from whence she beamed\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what fun you're going to have!” she cried.\r\n\r\n“I'd like to be sure of that,” he answered, his gloved hand on the\r\npommel.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” incredulously. “You don't like that automobile\r\nbetter, do you? They're so--so stubby. I must have a horse, a horse!”\r\n She smoothed and patted her steed lovingly.\r\n\r\n“You ought to have--Jewel of the world,” he said kindly. “My bad angel!”\r\n he added, looking up quizzically into her eyes, and smiling at the\r\nwidening wonder that grew in them.\r\n\r\n“Your--what?” she asked, and then Eloise came out in her habit.\r\n\r\n“I'm going instead of you,” cried the child gayly, “to pay you for\r\nstaying away all day.”\r\n\r\n“Did you miss me?” asked the girl as she shook hands with her escort.\r\n\r\n“I tried not to. Anna Belle and I have something to show you in the\r\nravine.” As she spoke, Jewel slid down into the doctor's arms, and stood\r\non the steps watching while he put Eloise up and mounted himself.\r\n\r\nThe child's eyes dwelt upon the pair admiringly as they waved their\r\nhands to her and rode away. Little she knew how their hearts were\r\nbeating. Mrs. Evringham, watching from an upper window, suspected it.\r\nShe felt that this afternoon would end all suspense.\r\n\r\nThe child gave a wistful sigh as the horses disappeared, and jumping off\r\nthe piazza, she wandered around the house toward the stable. There had\r\nbeen no rules laid down to her since the night of Essex Maid's attack,\r\nand Zeke was always a congenial companion.\r\n\r\nAs she neared the barn a young fellow left it, laughing. She knew who\r\nhe was,--one of the young men Zeke had known in Boston. He had several\r\ntimes of late come to call on his old chum, for he was out of work.\r\n\r\nAs he left the barn he saw the child and slouched off to one side,\r\navoiding her; but she scarcely noticed him, congratulating herself that\r\nZeke would be alone and ready, as usual, to crack jokes and stories.\r\n\r\nThe coachman was not in sight as she entered, but she knew she would\r\nfind him in the harness room. Its door stood ajar, and as the\r\nchild approached she heard a strange sound, as of some one weeping\r\nsuppressedly. Sturdily resisting the sudden fear that swept to her\r\nheart, she pushed open the door.\r\n\r\nThere stood Mrs. Forbes, leaning against a wooden support, her forehead\r\nresting against her clasped hands in a hopeless posture, as she sobbed\r\nheavily. The air was filled with an odor which had for Jewel sickening\r\nassociations. The only terror, the only tragedy, of her short life was\r\nwrapped about with this pungent smell. She seemed again to hear her\r\nmother's sobs, to feel once more that sensation of all things coming to\r\nruin which descended upon her at the unprecedented sight and sound of\r\nher strong mother's emotion.\r\n\r\nAll at once she perceived Zeke sitting on a low chair, his arms hanging\r\nacross his knees and his head fallen.\r\n\r\nThe child turned very pale. Her doll slid unnoticed to the floor, as she\r\npressed her little hands to her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Father, Mother, God,” she murmured in gasps. “Thou art all power. We\r\nare thy children. Error has no power over us. Help us to waken from this\r\nlie.”\r\n\r\nRunning up to the housekeeper, she clasped her arms about her convulsed\r\nform. “Dear Mrs. Forbes,” she said, her soft voice trembling at first\r\nbut growing firm, “I know this claim, but it can be healed. It seems\r\nvery terrible, but it's nothing. We know it, we must know it.”\r\n\r\nThe woman lifted her head and looked down with swollen eyes upon the\r\nchild. She saw her go unhesitatingly across to Zeke and kneel beside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Don't be discouraged, Zeke,” she said lovingly. “I know how it seems,\r\nbut my father had it and he was healed. You will be healed.”\r\n\r\nThe coachman lifted his rumpled head and stared at her with bloodshot\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Great fuss 'bout nothing,” he said sullenly. “Mother always fussing.”\r\n\r\nSomething in his look made the child shudder. Resisting the sudden\r\nrepugnance to one who had always shown her kindness, she impulsively\r\ntook his big hand in both her little ones. “Zeke, what is error saying\r\nto you?” she demanded. “You can't look at me without love. I love you\r\nbecause God does. He is lifting us out of this error belief.”\r\n\r\nThe young fellow returned the clasp of the soft hands and winked his\r\neyes like one who is waking. “Mother makes great fuss,” he grumbled.\r\n“Scott was here. We had two or three little friendly drinks. Ma had to\r\ncome in and blubber.”\r\n\r\n“What friendly drinks? What do you mean?” demanded Jewel, looking all\r\nabout her. Her eyes fell upon a large black bottle. She dropped the\r\ncoachman's hand and picked it up. She smelled of it, her eyes dilated,\r\nand she began to tremble again; and throwing the whiskey from her, she\r\nburied her face for a moment against Zeke's shirt sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Is it in a bottle!” she exclaimed at last, in a hushed voice, drawing\r\nback and regarding the coachman with such a white and horrified\r\ncountenance that it frightened the clouds from his brain. “Is that\r\nterrible claim in a bottle, and do people drink it out?” she asked\r\nslowly, and in an awestruck tone.\r\n\r\n“It's no harm,” began Zeke.\r\n\r\n“No harm when your mother is crying, when your face is full of error,\r\nand your eyes were hating? No harm when my mother cried, and all our\r\ngladness was gone? Would you go and drink a claim like that out of a\r\nbottle--of your own accord?”\r\n\r\nZeke wriggled under the blue eyes and the unnatural rigidity of the\r\nchild's face.\r\n\r\n“No, Jewel, he wouldn't,” groaned Mrs. Forbes suddenly. “Zeke's a good\r\nboy, but he's inherited that. His father died of it. It's a disease,\r\nchild. I thought my boy would escape, but he hasn't! It's the end!”\r\n cried the wretched woman. “What will Mr. Evringham say! To think how I\r\nblamed Fanshaw! Zeke'll lose his place and go downhill, and I shall die\r\nof shame and despair.” Her sobs again shook her from head to foot.\r\n\r\nJewel continued to look at Zeke. A new, eager expression stole over her\r\nface. “_Is_ it the end?” she asked. “Don't you believe in God?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” answered the coachman sullenly. “I know I'm a man, too.\r\nI can control myself.”\r\n\r\n“No. Nobody can. Even Jesus said, 'Of myself I can do nothing.' Only God\r\ncan help you. If you can drink that nasty smelling stuff, and get all\r\nred and rumply and sorry, then you need God the worst of anybody in\r\nBel-Air. You look better now. It's just like a dream, the way you lifted\r\nup your face to me when I came in, and it _was_ a dream. I'll help you,\r\nZeke. I'll show you how to find help.” The child suddenly leaned toward\r\nthe young fellow, and then retreated. “I can't stand your breath!” she\r\nexclaimed, “and I like to get close to the people I love.”\r\n\r\nThis seemed to touch Zeke. He blushed hotly. “It's a darned shame, kid,”\r\n he returned sheepishly.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Forbes, come here, please,” said Jewel. The housekeeper had ceased\r\ncrying, and was watching the pair. She saw that her boy's senses were\r\nclearer. She approached obediently, and when the child took her hand her\r\nown closed tightly upon the little fingers.\r\n\r\n“Zeke, you're a big strong man and everybody likes you,” said Jewel\r\nearnestly. “Isn't it better to stay that way than to drink out of a\r\nbottle, no matter _how_ much you like it?”\r\n\r\n“I don't like it so awfully,” returned Zeke protestingly. “I like to be\r\nsociable with the boys, that's all.”\r\n\r\n“What a way to be sociable!” gasped the child. “Well, wouldn't you\r\nrather be nice, so people will like to get close to you?”\r\n\r\n“Depends on the folks,” returned the boy with a touch of his usual\r\nmanner. “You're all right, little kid.” He put out his hand, but quickly\r\nwithdrew it.\r\n\r\nJewel seized it. “Now give your other one to your mother. There now,\r\nwe're all together. If your mother thinks you have a disease, Zeke, then\r\nshe must know you haven't. If you want me to, I'll come out here every\r\nday at a quiet time and give you a treatment, and we'll talk all about\r\nChristian Science, and we'll know that there's nothing that can make us\r\nsick or unhappy--or unkind! Think of your unkindness to your mother--and\r\nto me if you go on, for I love you, Zeke. Now _may_ I help you?”\r\n\r\nThe soft frank voice, the earnest little face, moved Zeke to cast a\r\nglance at his mother's swollen eyes. They were bent upon Jewel.\r\n\r\n“Do you say your father was cured that way, child?” asked Mrs. Forbes.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Oh yes! and he's so happy!”\r\n\r\n“Zeke, let's all be thankful if there's _anything_,” said the woman\r\ntremulously, turning to him appealingly.\r\n\r\n“I'd just as soon have a visit from you every day, little kid,” said the\r\nyoung fellow. “You're a corker.”\r\n\r\n“But you must want more than me,” returned the child. “God and healing\r\nand purity and goodness! If you're in earnest, what are you going to do\r\nwith that?” She touched the black bottle with the toe of her shoe.\r\n\r\nZeke looked at the whiskey, then back into her eyes. They were full of\r\nlove and faith for him.\r\n\r\nHe stooped and picked up the bottle, then striding to a window, he flung\r\nit out toward the forest trees with all the force of his strong arm.\r\n\r\n“Damn the stuff!” he said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes felt herself tremble from head to foot. She bit her lip.\r\n\r\nHer son turned back. “Getting near train time,” he added, not looking at\r\nhis companions. “Guess I'll go upstairs.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had disappeared his mother stooped slowly and kissed Jewel.\r\n“Forgive me,” she said tremulously.\r\n\r\n“What for?” asked the child.\r\n\r\n“Everything.”\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper still stood in the harness room after Jewel had gone\r\naway. She bowed her head on her folded hands. “Our Father who art in\r\nheaven, forgive me,” she prayed. “Forgive me for being a fool. Forgive\r\nme for not recognizing Thine angel whom Thou hast sent. Amen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMRS. EVRINGHAM'S CALLER\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham was busily chewing the cud of sweet fancies only, that\r\nafternoon. Following the equestrians in their leafy woodland path, she\r\npictured them as talking of their future, and herself built many\r\ncastles in the air. “Ah,” she thought sentimentally, leaning back in her\r\nreclining chair, “how charming is youth--with plenty of money!”\r\n\r\nShe was roused from these luxurious meditations by the appearance of\r\nSarah, bearing a card on a salver.\r\n\r\n“A man!” she exclaimed with annoyance. “I'm not dressed.”\r\n\r\nLifting the card, she read it with a start.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Nathan Wycliffe Bonnell.”\r\n\r\n“Tell him I'll be down soon,” was all she said; but her thoughts ran\r\nswiftly as she hurriedly slipped into her gown. “How in the world comes\r\nthe boy out here? Just as well that Eloise is away. It would only be\r\npainful to her, all the old associations.” But old associations cropped\r\nup more and more enticingly for Mrs. Evringham as she made her swift\r\ntoilet, and by the time she reached the drawing-room her eagerness lent\r\nher cordiality a very genuine tone.\r\n\r\n“Nat, dear boy, how are you?”\r\n\r\nThe young man who rose eagerly to meet her would have been noticeable\r\nin any crowd. She gazed up into his smooth-shaven, frank face, with its\r\nalert eyes and strong chin, and felt a yearning affection for all which\r\nhe represented to her. “What are you doing out here?”\r\n\r\n“Visiting you and Eloise,” he answered, with the hearty relish which\r\nalways characterized his manner when circumstances were agreeable.\r\n“Where is she?”\r\n\r\n“Riding. I don't know when they will come home, either. It's such a\r\ncharming day, isn't it? So good of you to hunt us up, Nat. We've been\r\nout of the world so long. I can't tell you what a rush of memories comes\r\nover me at sight of you, you nice, big boy. I do believe you've been\r\ngrowing.” She gave a glance of approval at the young man's stalwart\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don't humiliate me,” he laughed, as she drew him to a divan, where\r\nthey seated themselves.\r\n\r\n“How could you get away at this hour?”\r\n\r\n“I'm changing my business, and get a week's vacation thereby. Great\r\nluck, isn't it?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so. Are you going to do better?”\r\n\r\n“Much better. It's only a little matter of time now, Mrs.\r\nEvringham--automobiles, steam yachts, and all the rest of it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, the optimism of youth!” she sighed, gazing at the dancing lights in\r\nhis eyes. “It's very beautiful, and usually entirely unfounded. You\r\nlook so radiant, my dear. Perhaps you have come out here to let us\r\ncongratulate you. Have you found that desirable girl? I certainly should\r\nbe the first to be told, for I always talked to you very plainly, didn't\r\nI?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed you did, Mrs. Evringham. You always kept my ineligibility before\r\nme strenuously.”\r\n\r\n“A certain _sort_ of ineligibility, dear boy,” returned the lady with\r\na flattering cadence. “Your capital did not happen to consist of money.\r\nTell me all, Nat. Who is she?”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. “She's still not impossible, but improbable,” he\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are too difficult, my dear. Really, I thought at the time our\r\nmisfortunes fell upon us that it was going to be Miss Caton. She would\r\nhave been a great assistance to you, Nat. It isn't as if you could even\r\nafford to be a bachelor. In these days so much is expected of them. How\r\nis your mother?” Mrs. Evringham made the addition in that tone of\r\nfixed sympathy which one employs when only a depressing answer can be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n“Very well, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“You mean as well as usual, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“No, I mean well. Wonderful, isn't it?”\r\n\r\n“Really, Nat?” Mrs. Evringham straightened up in her interest. “Who did\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“She was healed by Christian Science.”\r\n\r\n“You don't mean it!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I do.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham thanked her holy stars that Eloise was absent.\r\n\r\n“Well! I never for one moment classed your mother as a _malade\r\nimaginaire_!” exclaimed the lady.\r\n\r\nHer companion raised his eyebrows. “I fancy no one did who knew her.”\r\n\r\n“You believe it, then?”\r\n\r\n“I should be an idiot if I didn't.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say she is out of her wheeled chair?”\r\n\r\n“No chairs for her now. When she wishes to walk she walks.”\r\n\r\n“Then she always could!” declared Mrs. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“I think you know better than that,” returned the other calmly.\r\n\r\n“How long since?” asked Mrs. Evringham.\r\n\r\n“Three months.”\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n“Aren't you glad for her?” asked Bonnell with a slight smile of\r\ncuriosity into the disturbed face. “I ought to have told you at first\r\nthat osteopathy did it; then after your joy had subsided, break the\r\ntruth gently.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I'm glad,” returned the other stiffly, “but I'd rather Eloise\r\ndid not hear of it at once.”\r\n\r\n“May I know why?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. We have a very dear friend who is a physician. It looks very\r\nmuch as if he might be something nearer than a friend. It is he with\r\nwhom Eloise is riding this afternoon. It is very distasteful, naturally,\r\nto have these alleged cures discussed in our family. We have had some\r\nannoyance in that line already. You can understand how doctors must\r\nfeel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, so long as they believe a cure to be only alleged; but where one\r\nis convinced that previously hopeless conditions have been healed, and\r\nit does happen once in a while, they are glad of it, I'm confident. We\r\nhaven't a finer, broader minded class of men in our country than our\r\nphysicians.”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” agreed Mrs. Evringham, drawing herself up with a fleeting\r\nvision of the Ballard place on Mountain Avenue.\r\n\r\n“But they are not the wealthiest at the start,” said Nat. “Is it\r\npossible that you are allowing Eloise to ride unchaperoned with a young\r\nphysician?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham did not remark the threatening curves at the corners of\r\nthe speaker's lips.\r\n\r\n“Oh, this one is different,” she returned seriously; “very fine\r\nconnections, and substantial in _every_ way.”\r\n\r\nHer companion threw back his head and laughed frankly.\r\n\r\n“We have to smile at each other once in a while, don't we, Mrs.\r\nEvringham?” he said, in the light, caressing manner which had for a few\r\nyears been one of her chief worries; “but all the same, you're fond of\r\nme just as long as I don't forget my place, eh? You're glad to see me?”\r\n\r\n“You know I am.” Mrs. Evringham pressed her hand against the laces over\r\nher heart. “Such a bittersweet feeling comes over me at the very tones\r\nof your voice. Oh, the happy past, Nat! Gone forever!” She touched a\r\ndainty handkerchief to her eyes. “I suppose your mother is still in her\r\napartment?”\r\n\r\n“She has taken a place at View Point for the summer, and has set her\r\nheart on a long visit from you.”\r\n\r\n“How very kind of her,” responded Mrs. Evringham with genuine gratitude.\r\n“I don't know what father means to do in the hot weather or whether\r\nhe--or whether I should wish to go with him. Your mother and I always\r\nenjoyed each other, when she was sufficiently free from suffering.”\r\n\r\n“That time is always now,” returned Nat, a fullness of gratitude in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nHis companion looked at him curiously. “I can't realize it.”\r\n\r\n“Come and see,” was his reply.\r\n\r\n“I will, I certainly will. I shall anticipate it with great pleasure.”\r\n\r\nA very convenient place to prepare a part of Eloise's trousseau, Mrs.\r\nEvringham was considering, and the girl safely engaged, Nat's presence\r\nwould have no terrors. “You think you are really getting into a good\r\nbusiness arrangement now?” she asked aloud.\r\n\r\n“Very. I wake up in the morning wondering at my own good fortune.”\r\n\r\n“I am so glad, my dear boy,” responded the other sympathetically.\r\n“Perhaps, after all, you will be able to wait for a little more chin\r\nthan Miss Caton has. Of course she's a very _nice_ girl and all that.”\r\n\r\nBonnell smiled at the carpet.\r\n\r\nThey talked on for half an hour of mutual friends over cups of tea, and\r\nthen he rose to go.\r\n\r\n“Eloise will be sorry!” said Mrs. Evringham effusively. “It's such a\r\nlong way out here and so difficult for you to get the time. It isn't as\r\nif you could come easily.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have several days here. I'm staying at the Reeves's. Do you know\r\nthem?”\r\n\r\n“No,” returned the lady, trying to conceal that this was a blow.\r\n\r\n“It is Mr. Reeves with whom I am going into business, and we are doing\r\nsome preliminary work. I shall see Eloise soon. Remember me to her.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly,” replied Mrs. Evringham. She kept a stiff upper lip\r\nuntil she was alone, and then a troubled line grew in her forehead.\r\n\r\n“It will be all right, of course, if things are settled,” she thought.\r\n“I can scarcely wait for Eloise to come home.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJewel had come from the barn straight to her room, where she thought\r\nupon her problem with the aids she loved.\r\n\r\nAt last she went downstairs to a side door to watch for Zeke as he drove\r\nfrom the barn on his way to the station to meet Mr. Evringham. As the\r\nhorse walked out of the barn she emerged and intercepted the coachman.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes at a window saw Zeke stop. She wondered what Jewel was\r\nsaying to him, wondered with a humble gratitude novel to her dominating\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n“Wait one minute, Zeke,” said the child. “I've been wondering whether I\r\nought to say anything to grandpa.”\r\n\r\n“If you do I'll lose my place,” returned the young fellow; “and I've\r\nnever done wrong by the horses yet.”\r\n\r\n“I know you haven't. God has taken care of you, hasn't he, Zeke? Do you\r\nthink it's right for me not to tell grandpa? I've decided that I'll do\r\nwhatever you say.”\r\n\r\nIt was the wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove. Zeke,\r\nnervously fingering the whip handle, looked down into the guileless face\r\nand mentally vowed never to betray the trust he saw there.\r\n\r\n“Then don't tell him, Jewel,” he returned rather thickly, for the\r\nfullness in his throat. “You come out to the barn the way you said you\r\nwould, and we'll talk over things. I don't care if the boys do laugh.\r\nI've sworn off. I believe you helped Essex Maid the other night. I\r\nbelieve you can help me.”\r\n\r\nJewel's eyes were joyful. “If you know you _want_ help, Zeke, then\r\nyou'll get it. Mother says that's the first thing. Mortal mind is so\r\nproud.”\r\n\r\n“Mine ain't strutting much,” returned Zeke as he drove on.\r\n\r\nJewel amused herself about the grounds until the phaeton should return\r\nwith her grandfather.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw it coming she ran down to the gate and hopped and skipped\r\nback beside it, Mr. Evringham watching her gyrations unsmilingly.\r\n\r\nAs he dismounted at the piazza she clung to his hand going up the steps.\r\n“Which are you going to do, grandpa, go riding or play golf?”\r\n\r\n“Which do you want me to do?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“When you ride it's more fun for me,” she replied.\r\n\r\nHe seated himself in one of the chairs and she leaned against its broad\r\narm.\r\n\r\n“It's rather more fun for me, too. I'm growing lazy. I think I'll ride.”\r\n\r\n“Good!”\r\n\r\n“What have you been doing to-day, Jewel?”\r\n\r\n“Well,”--meditatively,--“cousin Eloise went to New York, so I had to get\r\nmy lesson alone. And I didn't braid my hair over.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham looked startled. “She'll do it, I dare say, before\r\ndinner,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“If she has time. She has gone riding with Dr. Ballard. They just\r\ntrotted away together. Oh, it was lovely!”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham, leaning his head back, looked off under his heavy brows\r\nas he responded:--\r\n\r\n     “Across the hills and far away,\r\n     Beyond their utmost purple rim,\r\n     And deep into the dying day\r\n     The happy princess followed him,\r\n\r\n“and all that sort of business, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what you mean,” said Jewel doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“I should hope not. Well, what else have you done? Been treating any\r\nrheumatism? I haven't had it since the sun shone.”\r\n\r\n“You never asked me to,” returned the child.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham smiled. “The sunshine is a pretty good treatment,” he\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes your belief comes into my thought,” said Jewel, “and of\r\ncourse I always turn on it and think the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Much obliged, I'm sure. I'd like to turn on it myself at times.”\r\n\r\n“You can study with cousin Eloise and me, if you'd like to,” said Jewel\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you, thank you,” rejoined the broker hastily. “Don't disturb\r\nyourself. There must be some sinners, you know, or the saints would have\r\nto go out of business--nobody to practice on. Well, have you been to the\r\nravine?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes! Anna Belle and I, and we had more _fun_! We made a garden.”\r\n\r\n“Morning or afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“Morning.”\r\n\r\n“Well I wish to know,” said Mr. Evringham in a suddenly serious and\r\nimpressive tone, “I wish to know if you reached home in time for lunch.”\r\n\r\nJewel felt somewhat startled under the daze of his piercing eyes, but\r\nher conscience was clear. “Yes, I was here in plenty of time. I wanted\r\nto surely not be late, so I was here too soon.”\r\n\r\n“That's what I was afraid of,” returned Mr. Evringham gravely. “I\r\ndon't wish you to be unpunctual, but I object equally to your returning\r\nunnecessarily early when you wish to stay.”\r\n\r\n“But I couldn't help it, grandpa,” Jewel began earnestly, when he\r\ninterrupted her.\r\n\r\n“So I've brought you this,” he added, and took from his pocket an oblong\r\npackage, sealed at each end.\r\n\r\nThe child laid her doll in the broker's lap,--he had become hardened to\r\nthis indignity,--and her fingers broke the seals and slipped the paper\r\nfrom a morocco case.\r\n\r\n“Push the spring in the end,” said Mr. Evringham.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed. The lid flew up and disclosed a small silver chatelaine\r\nwatch. The pin was a cherub's head, its wings enameled in white, as\r\nwere the back and edges of the little timepiece whose hands were busily\r\npointing to blue figures.\r\n\r\nJewel gasped. “For me?”\r\n\r\nHer grandfather smoothed his mustache. He had presented gifts to ladies\r\nbefore, but never with such effect.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa, grandpa!” she exclaimed, touching the little watch in\r\nwondering delight. “See what Divine Love has sent me!”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham raised his eyebrows and smiled, but he was soon assured\r\nthat Love's messenger was not forgotten. He was instantly enveloped in\r\na rapturous hug, and heroically endured the bitter of the watchcase\r\npressing into his jugular for the sweet of the rose-leaf kisses that\r\nwere assaulting his cheek like the quick reports of a tiny Gatling gun.\r\n\r\n“See if you can wind it,” he said at last.\r\n\r\nJewel lifted her treasure tenderly from its velvet bed, and he showed\r\nher how to twist its stem, and then pinned it securely on the breast of\r\nher light sailor suit, where she looked down upon it in rapt admiration.\r\n\r\n“Now then, Jewel, you have no excuse!” he said severely.\r\n\r\nShe raised her happy eyes, while her hand pressed the satin surface of\r\nher watch. “Grandpa, grandpa!” she said, sighing ecstatically, “you're\r\nsuch a joker!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE RAVINE GARDEN\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham tried heroically to look impassive when her daughter\r\nreturned from the ride. There was barely time then to dress for dinner,\r\nand no opportunity for confidences before the meal, nor afterward until\r\nbedtime; but the look of peace and sweetness in Eloise's face could have\r\nbut one significance to the mother, who believed that peace lay only in\r\nthe direction upon which she had set her heart.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham took coffee with them after dinner in the drawing-room,\r\nwhile Jewel caressed her watch, never tiring of looking at its clear\r\nface and the little second hand which traveled so steadily its tiny\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham looked often toward the door, expectant of the doctor's\r\nentrance. The evening wore on and he did not come. Still Eloise's face\r\nwore the placid, restful expression. A gentle ease with her grandfather\r\nreplaced her old manner.\r\n\r\nHer mother determined to try an experiment.\r\n\r\n“You could never guess who called to-day, Eloise,” she said suddenly.\r\n\r\nHer daughter looked up from her coffee. “No. Who was it?”\r\n\r\n“Nat Bonnell.”\r\n\r\n“Really!” The girl's tone indicated great surprise, and that only. “I\r\nwish I might have seen him.”\r\n\r\nThe addition was made so calmly, almost perfunctorily, that Mrs.\r\nEvringham smiled with exultation.\r\n\r\nShe turned to her father-in-law. “Who would believe that Mr. Bonnell\r\nwas Eloise's brightest flame a year ago? 'How soon are we forgot!'” she\r\nsaid lightly.\r\n\r\nWhen Jewel had kissed them all good-night and gone upstairs, and Mr.\r\nEvringham had withdrawn to his library, Mrs. Evringham took her child's\r\nhand and looked fondly into her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Well?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Well,” returned Eloise, “do tell me everything Nat said.”\r\n\r\n“After you've told me everything Dr. Ballard said. I supposed you'd fly\r\nto tell me, dear.”\r\n\r\nThe girl looked tenderly back into the eyes that were sharp with\r\ninquiry. “Dear little mother,” she returned, “it can't be.”\r\n\r\n“What can't be?”\r\n\r\n“What you wish. Dr. Ballard.”\r\n\r\n“Have you--refused him--!” Mrs. Evringham's face whitened, and\r\nunconsciously she stepped back.\r\n\r\n“It didn't have to come to that. Dr. Ballard is so fine--such a wise man\r\nin so many ways. I do admire him so much.”\r\n\r\n“What did you say to him? I will know!” exclaimed Mrs. Evringham\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\nEloise was mute, and her eyes besought her mother.\r\n\r\n“Speak, I say! Was it Christian Science? Did you dare, Eloise Evringham,\r\ndid you _dare_ spoil your life--my life--our future, by scaring Dr.\r\nBallard with that bugbear?” The angry woman was breathing fast.\r\n\r\n“Mother dear, don't give us something so painful to remember. Don't, I\r\nbeg of you. Dr. Ballard does not reproach me. He thinks I shall change,\r\nand he wishes to give me time to see if I do. Think of him, if you will\r\nnot think of me. He would be so shocked to have you take it this way.\r\nIf you could have seen how kind he was, how patient. Dear mother, don't\r\ncry. It isn't anything I can help, unless I should deliberately turn\r\ndishonest.”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Evringham did cry, and heartily. She hurried away to her own\r\nroom as quickly as possible, and locked the door against Eloise, who lay\r\nawake for hours with a strange mingling of regret and joy at her heart,\r\nand a constant declaring of the truth.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the girl heard the door unlock and saw her mother emerge.\r\n\r\n“Darling mamma!” she exclaimed, springing out of bed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Eloise,” moaned the poor woman, dissolving again upon her child's\r\nshoulder. “I never went to bed without your kiss, and I can't bear it.\r\nHow can you be so cru--cru--cruel!”\r\n\r\n“Darling, everything is going to come right,” returned Eloise, holding\r\nher close. “Nothing good would come of doing wrong. I never loved you so\r\nmuch as now. I never saw duty so plainly. Dearest, in one way I suffer\r\nfor you, but still I was never so happy. I have grasped the end of the\r\nclue that will surely lead us safely through the labyrinth, no matter\r\nwhat life brings. You will see, mamma dear, after a while you will see.\r\nDon't go back. Come into my bed.”\r\n\r\nDisconsolately Mrs. Evringham obeyed, and in a few minutes, worn out\r\nwith emotion, she had sobbed herself to sleep in her child's arms; and\r\nalthough for many days afterward she wore a languid air, and declared\r\nthat there was nothing to live for, she yielded herself to Eloise's\r\ncourageous and quietly joyful atmosphere, with silent wonder at her\r\nchild's altered outlook.\r\n\r\nOn the morning following the painful interview with her mother, Eloise\r\npresented herself in Jewel's room at the usual hour.\r\n\r\nSmiling, she approached the child and exhibited three fresh new books.\r\nIndia paper editions of the Bible and “Science and Health,” and the\r\nlittle brown pamphlet were in her hands.\r\n\r\n“Yours?” exclaimed the child.\r\n\r\nEloise nodded.\r\n\r\n“Good, good!” Jewel hopped up and down, and forthwith brought Anna Belle\r\nto have her share in the rejoicing.\r\n\r\n“You were afraid you couldn't get them. Now see!” cried the child\r\ntriumphantly. “As if Divine Love couldn't send you those books!”\r\n\r\n“He showed me a way,” returned the girl. “See where I've written my\r\nname. I want you to put 'Jewel' right under it in each one.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, in those lovely books?” said the child doubtfully. “I don't write\r\nvery well.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I want it, dear, when we go downstairs and can get some ink. Did\r\nanybody fix your hair yesterday?”\r\n\r\n“I just brushed it down real smooth on the outside,” returned the child.\r\n\r\n“It looks so,” said Eloise, laughing. “Let's fix it before we have the\r\nlesson. By the way, what time is it, Jewel?”\r\n\r\nThe little girl smiled back at her cousin's reflection in the glass, and\r\ntook the open morocco case from the bureau. “Anna Belle and I put him\r\nto bed last night,” she said, looking fondly at the silver cherub on\r\nits velvet couch. “We've named him Little Faithful. He'll come to the\r\nlesson, too. I know he's going to be a lovely Scientist.”\r\n\r\n“I'm sure I hope he will, and neither be fast nor lazy,” returned\r\nEloise, as she unbraided the short pigtails.\r\n\r\n“I tell you it wasn't so nice getting the lesson alone yesterday,” said\r\nJewel. “You were away all day! Did you have a nice ride?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Eloise responded slowly. “The day was very nice--and so is Dr.\r\nBallard.”\r\n\r\n“Did he enjoy it?” asked the child hopefully. The doctor had been a good\r\ndeal on her mind.\r\n\r\n“Some of the time,” responded Eloise soberly.\r\n\r\n“Why not all the time? Did error creep in?”\r\n\r\nThe older girl brushed away in silence for a minute.\r\n\r\n“I didn't mean to talk about grown-up things,” said the child, somewhat\r\nabashed. “Mother says I must be careful not to.”\r\n\r\n“It is all right, Jewel. The new ideas I have been learning have made\r\nme see some things so clearly. One is to perceive what it is that really\r\ndraws people together in a bond that cannot be broken. There is only one\r\nthing that can do it and will do it, and that is loving the same truth.\r\nTwo people can have a very good time together for a while, and like each\r\nother very much, but the time comes when their thoughts fly apart unless\r\nthat one bond of union is there--unless they love the same spiritual\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker caught, in the glass, the child's eyes fixed attentively\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn't Dr. Ballard look at our book?” asked Jewel softly.\r\n\r\n“No, dear.”\r\n\r\nThe child reflected a minute, and her eyes filled. “I just love him,”\r\n she said.\r\n\r\nHer cousin stooped and kissed her cheek. “You well may,” she returned\r\nquietly. “He deserves it.”\r\n\r\nThey studied the lesson and then went downstairs, where Jewel in her\r\nvery best hand slowly transcribed her name in the new books; then she\r\ntold Eloise that she was going out to the barn.\r\n\r\n“I'm going to visit with Zeke,” she said. “He has a claim of error, and\r\nhe is willing Science should help him.”\r\n\r\n“Is he ill?”\r\n\r\nJewel looked off. “It isn't that kind of error.”\r\n\r\n“There are plenty worse,” rejoined Eloise. She looked doubtfully at the\r\nlittle girl. “Wouldn't you better tell me, dear? Is it right for you to\r\ngo?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it's right. His mother knows it, and she's so kind to me. What do\r\nyou think! At breakfast she asked me if I wouldn't like to bring Anna\r\nBelle down. She says I can bring her to the table whenever I want to.\r\nIsn't it nice? The dear little creature has been so patient, never\r\nhaving a thing to eat!”\r\n\r\nEloise could not help laughing, the manner in which Jewel finished\r\nwas so suddenly quaint; but she shook her head in silent wonder as she\r\nwatched the short skirted figure setting forth for the barn.\r\n\r\n“Oh cousin Eloise.” Jewel turned around. “Will you come to the ravine\r\nafter lunch, and see what Anna Belle and I have done?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nJewel walked on a little further and turned again. “You won't wear your\r\nwatch, will you?” she called.\r\n\r\n“No, I'll surely forget it,” returned the girl, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe small figure went on, well content.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if I could only be invisible in that barn!” soliloquized Eloise.\r\n“How I would like to hear what she will say. How wonderful it is that\r\nthat little child has more chance of success, whatever trouble Zeke has\r\nbeen getting into, than any full-grown, experienced sage, philosopher,\r\nor reformer, who is a worker in mortal mind.”\r\n\r\nAnna Belle came to luncheon that day. Mrs. Forbes actually put a cushion\r\nin one of the chairs to lift the honored guest to such a height that\r\nher rosy smile was visible above the tablecloth. Not content with this\r\nhospitality, the housekeeper brought a bread-and-butter plate, upon\r\nwhich she placed such small proportions of food as might be calculated\r\nto tempt a dainty appetite. Jewel felt almost embarrassed by the\r\neminence to which her child was suddenly raised.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you, Mrs. Forbes,” she said; “you needn't take so much\r\ntrouble. Anna Belle's just used to having a part of mine.”\r\n\r\nBut nothing now was too good for Anna Belle. “She shall have a\r\ncup-custard to-morrow,” returned the housekeeper.\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham looked on with lack-lustre eyes. As well make much of\r\nAnna Belle as any other idol. Everything was stuffed with sawdust!\r\n\r\nHow the sunbeams glanced in the woods that day as Jewel, one hand\r\nclasping her doll and the other in Eloise's, skipped along the road to\r\nthe ravine!\r\n\r\nWhen they had stooped under the wire and gone down the bank, how the\r\nbrook sang, and how the violets bloomed in Jewel's garden!\r\n\r\n“It's very pretty,” said Eloise, regarding the paths and flower beds\r\nwhich Jewel exhibited with pride. “It's very pretty, but it lacks one\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked the child eagerly.\r\n\r\n“A pond.”\r\n\r\n“But it is by the side of a rushing river,” returned Jewel.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but all the more easy to have a pond.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“We'll set a shallow pan, and sink it in the ground, and plant ferns\r\nabout it to hang over. Anna Belle can have some little china dolls to go\r\nin wading in it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, yes!” cried Jewel delighted. “Hear that, dearie? Hear what Love\r\nis planning for you?”\r\n\r\nAnna Belle's nose was buried in the grass and her hat was awry. If she\r\nhad a fault, it was a tendency to being overdressed. At present her\r\nplumed hat and large fluffy boa gave her an aspect unsympathetic with\r\nthe surroundings. Jewel pulled her upright and placed her on the mossy\r\ndivan.\r\n\r\n“If I'd only brought the trowel I could get the hole ready,” Jewel was\r\nsaying, when a whistle, soft and clear as a flute, sounded above the\r\nbrook's gurgle.\r\n\r\nShe lifted a finger in caution. “Oh,” she whispered, looking up into her\r\ncousin's face, “the loveliest bird! Hush.”\r\n\r\nClear, sweet, flexible, somewhere among those high branches sounded\r\nagain the same elaborate phrase.\r\n\r\nJewel was surprised to see her cousin's pleased, listening expression\r\nalter to eager wonder, then the girl flushed rosy red and started up.\r\n“Siegfried!” she murmured.\r\n\r\nAgain came the bird motif sifting down through the rustling leaves.\r\n\r\n“Nat!” called Eloise gladly.\r\n\r\n“Any nymphs down there?” questioned a man's voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes!”\r\n\r\n“May Pan come down?”\r\n\r\n“Yes indeed.”\r\n\r\nJewel, watching and wondering, saw a young man in light clothes swing\r\nhimself down from tree to tree, and at last saw both his hands close on\r\nboth her cousin's.\r\n\r\nThe two talked and laughed in unison for a minute, then Eloise freed\r\nherself and turned to the serious-faced child. “You remember my speaking\r\nof Nat the other day?” she asked. “This is he. Mr. Bonnell, this is my\r\ncousin Jewel Evringham. She is landscape gardening just now, and may not\r\nfeel like giving you her hand.”\r\n\r\n“I can wash it,” said Jewel, dipping the earthy member in the brook,\r\nwiping it on the grass, and placing it in the large one that was offered\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“How did you ever find us? I thought you'd gone back to New York. I had\r\nno idea of seeing you,” said Eloise in a breath.\r\n\r\n“Didn't your mother tell you? I have a week off.”\r\n\r\nThe girl's bright face sobered. “Poor mother! She had a--a shock after\r\nyou were here yesterday. I suppose it put everything out of her head.\r\nWas it she who sent you to find us?”\r\n\r\n“No; a massive lady met me at the door and informed me that your mother\r\nwished to be excused from every one to-day, but that you had fallen down\r\na crack in the earth which could be reached up this road.” The speaker\r\nlooked about. “As there doesn't seem any place to stand here, hadn't we\r\nbetter sit down before we fall in the brook? I might rescue you, but the\r\ncurrent is swift.”\r\n\r\nEloise at once sank upon the green incline, and he followed her example.\r\nJewel watched him with consideration, and he became aware of her gaze.\r\n\r\n“What are you making, little girl?” he asked, with his sunshiny smile.\r\n\r\n“A garden; and I could dig the pond if I had brought the trowel.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps my knife will do.” He took it out and opened the largest blade.\r\n“What do you think of that?”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose I should break it?” asked the child doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“You're welcome to try,” he replied.\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward and accepted it from his outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nMUTUAL SURPRISES\r\n\r\n“I thought I knew Bel-Air Park,” said Bonnell looking about him. “I\r\nnever suspected this.”\r\n\r\n“Jewel is the Columbus of this spot. She has named it the Ravine of\r\nHappiness.”\r\n\r\nNat looked at his speaker. “That's rather ambiguous. Does she mean where\r\nhappiness is buried or where it is found?”\r\n\r\nEloise smiled. “Jewel never buries any happiness. Well, how is\r\neverybody, Nat? Your mother, first of all.”\r\n\r\n“Didn't Mrs. Evringham tell you?”\r\n\r\nThe girl's face clouded with apprehension at his surprised tone.\r\n“No. You will think it very strange, but poor mamma was under such\r\nexcitement, you must pardon her. Everything went out of her head. Don't\r\ntell me that dear Mrs. Bonnell”--she lowered her voice--“that you have\r\nlost her!”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. “No, I've gained her. She's well.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” repeated the girl amazed. “Why, what do you mean? How glorious!\r\nHow long since?”\r\n\r\n“About three months.”\r\n\r\n“I am so glad! Tell me more good news. Tell me about your own frivoling,\r\nand then I shall hear about the other people.”\r\n\r\nThe young man shook his head. “I observed Lent this year scrupulously,\r\nand I haven't changed my tactics since Easter. I've been keeping my nose\r\nto the grindstone. Began to see things a little differently, Eloise. I\r\ndecided it was mother's innings--decided to drop the butterfly and do\r\nthe bee act.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible!” The girl laughed. “Will wonders never cease! What was\r\nthe matter? Did the heiresses cut you?”\r\n\r\n“I cut the whole thing, and I have my reward. I suppose your mother\r\ndidn't tell you that, either. I'm going into business with Mr. Reeves.\r\nDo you know him? Jewel does.” He smiled toward the child, who lifted an\r\ninterested face.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” she said. “You remember about him, cousin Eloise.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.” The girl looked at her friend questioningly.\r\n\r\n“I'm spending this week at his house.”\r\n\r\n“And you know about Jewel? He has told you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. The one person of his acquaintance who hasn't to unlearn\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\n“You mean he talked to you of Christian Science?”\r\n\r\nBonnell's hands were clasping his knees. His hat lay on the bank beside\r\nhim and the thick hair tossed away from his brow. He nodded slowly,\r\nwondering at the sudden attentive interest of her look.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied. “We talked on the tabooed subject.”\r\n\r\n“Tabooed with whom? You?” she asked disappointedly.\r\n\r\n“No, with you I understand.”\r\n\r\nColor flew into Eloise's face. “Who told you that? Mother of course.”\r\n\r\nBonnell nodded, giving a fleeting glance toward the child, who was again\r\nbusy at her excavation.\r\n\r\n“Are congratulations in order, Eloise?” he asked quietly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, congratulations.” Her eyes grew full of light. “For I have come to\r\nsee the truth. That child has shown me.”\r\n\r\nThe young man's lips remained apart for a second in his surprise at this\r\ndeclaration, after Mrs. Evringham's detailed representations.\r\n\r\n“Then I may tell you how my mother was healed,” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“Oh, was it really so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Nat?” Unconsciously Eloise leaned her whole body toward him,\r\nsupporting her hand on the ground. “You know about it yourself? You\r\nunderstand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you believe in it?”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart.”\r\n\r\nHer face shone. “Oh, Jewel, do you hear? Mr. Bonnell is a Scientist.”\r\n The girl's breathing was hastened. Her eyes were like stars.\r\n\r\nThe child sank back from her work and regarded the visitor, smiling. She\r\nwas glad, but she was not astonished. In her world a great many young\r\nmen had found the key to life, but to Eloise it was something wonderful.\r\nShe looked at her old friend as if she had never seen him before. She\r\nreviewed all she knew of his gay life with its background of suffering.\r\n\r\n“Do you study the lessons?” she asked incredulously. “_You_?”\r\n\r\n“Every day. I am surprised beyond measure to find you interested, for\r\nyour mother told me--And the doctor--?”\r\n\r\n“Is a very fine man,” returned Eloise gravely, as he paused.\r\n\r\nBonnell's mental questions were answered by her manner. He put his hand\r\nin the pocket of his sack coat and drew out a small, thin, black book.\r\n\r\nEloise took it. “'Unity of Good,'” she read on its cover. “I haven't\r\nseen this one,” she said eagerly.\r\n\r\n“You will,” he replied.\r\n\r\nShe looked up. “Do you know, I thought just now you were going to take\r\nout your pipe?” she said naively. “That's where you used to keep it.”\r\n\r\n“My pipe doesn't like me any more,” he rejoined quietly.\r\n\r\n“Are you happy, Nat?” she asked, scrutinizing his face with childlike,\r\nsearching eyes.\r\n\r\n“I was never a very solemn codger, was I?” he returned.\r\n\r\n“But are you happier? Does the world look different? Of course it does,\r\nwith your mother well.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” he answered in a changed tone, tossing his head back, and\r\nmaking a gesture as of throwing away something. “There was nothing in it\r\nbefore, nothing in it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know,” she returned comprehendingly.\r\n\r\nJewel had watched them, and now, as they paused, her voice broke the\r\nsilence in which the two friends looked into each other's faces.\r\n\r\n“Cousin Eloise is going to church with me on Sunday,” she announced.\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly.” Bonnell smiled. “Wednesday evening meetings and all\r\nnow, Eloise. Haven't you attended yet?”\r\n\r\n“No, I've only just learned. I've only just seen. I'm only beginning to\r\nsee, Nat. Your mother was healed. Oh, it is _true_, isn't it! It's so\r\nwonderful to find that you, _you_, know more about it than I do, when I\r\nsupposed you would scorn it. I can't help expecting to wake up.”\r\n\r\n“That is just what you will do,” returned Bonnell. “You will waken--to a\r\nthousand things. So your mother objects.”\r\n\r\n“Poor little mother,” returned Eloise, looking down with sudden sadness.\r\n\r\n“My mother wants you and yours to make us a long visit at View Point\r\nthis summer.”\r\n\r\nThe girl's lovely eyes raised hopefully. “The best thing that could\r\nhappen,” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I think so,” responded her companion.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Evringham returned from golf that afternoon, only his\r\ndaughter-in-law was in sight. She inclined her head toward him with the\r\nair of a Lady Macbeth.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen anything of the girls?” she asked as he approached her.\r\n\r\n“Nothing. Where are they?”\r\n\r\nShe slowly shrugged her shoulders. “I'm the last one to ask. They\r\nwouldn't think of telling me,” she returned.\r\n\r\n“What's up now?” thought Mr. Evringham. “You don't look well, Madge,” he\r\nsaid aloud.\r\n\r\nOnce she would have welcomed the evidence of solicitude. Now nothing\r\nmattered.\r\n\r\n“I don't feel well,” she replied, “and I can't even call the physician I\r\nprefer.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham stared down at her for a silent minute, and light broke\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n“Is it all off with Ballard?” he asked bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and that's what you have done, father, by allowing that child\r\nJewel to come here.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham bit his lip. This amused him.\r\n\r\n“Eloise has mounted the new hobby, and is riding for dear life away from\r\ncommon sense, away from everything that promised such happiness.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean Christian Science?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I do.”\r\n\r\n“It's a strange thing, Madge. Do you know, it captures people with good\r\nheads.” Mr. Evringham seated himself near his daughter's chair. “I\r\ncame out on the train with my friend Reeves. He was talking about young\r\nBonnell, of whom you spoke last night. Said his mother was cured when\r\nthe doctors couldn't do anything. You know her, eh?”\r\n\r\n“As well as if she were my own flesh and blood.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a fact, what they say?”\r\n\r\n“She was considered incurable. I know nothing about the rest of it.\r\nNat was telling me yesterday. Now he is probably infatuated also, and,\r\nsooner or later, Eloise is sure to meet him.”\r\n\r\n“H'm, h'm. An old flame, you said,” remarked Mr. Evringham. “Indeed!\r\nIn--deed! I trust for your sake, Madge, that his is not objectionable to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“He is,” snapped Mrs. Evringham. “A poor fellow, with his way to make\r\nin the world. He's been out of college a couple of years and hasn't done\r\nanything worth speaking of yet.”\r\n\r\n“Reeves is going to take him into the business,” returned Mr. Evringham.\r\n“I don't know why or wherefore, but the mere fact is decidedly\r\npromising.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, who can tell if that will last!” returned the other with scornful\r\npessimism. “Nat has let too many cotillions to do anything else well. I\r\ncan only pray that he will get away without seeing Eloise. Mrs. Bonnell\r\nhas invited us to make her a visit this summer. I certainly shall not go\r\none step!”\r\n\r\nA sudden sound of laughter was heard on the quiet air. Mrs. Evringham\r\nleaned forward. “There are the children now,” she said, as\r\nfigures turned in at the gateway; “and who is that? It is”--with\r\ndesperation,--“he's here! Nat Bonnell is with them!”\r\n\r\nShe sat upright with disapproval, clasping the arm of her chair, while\r\nher father-in-law looked curiously at the approaching group. His gaze\r\nfixed on the young man with the well-set head who, swinging his hat in\r\nhis hand, was talking fast to Eloise of something that amused them both.\r\nJewel apparently interrupted him and he stooped with a quick motion,\r\nand in a second she was sitting on his shoulder, shrieking in gleeful\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nThus they approached the piazza and came close before noting that it was\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa, see me!” cried Jewel delightedly.\r\n\r\nBonnell met the unsmiling gaze of his host as Mr. Evringham rose, and\r\nthen caught sight of Mrs. Evringham stonily gazing from her chair.\r\n\r\n“Ah, how do you do?” he called laughingly.\r\n\r\n“Jove, he is a good looking chap!” thought the host, and Bonnell set\r\nJewel down at his feet with such velocity that Anna Belle was cast\r\nheavily to earth.\r\n\r\n“A thousand pardons!” exclaimed Nat, catching up the doll by the skirt\r\nand restoring her.\r\n\r\nJewel gave him a bright look. “_She_ knows there is no sensation in\r\nmatter,” she said scornfully.\r\n\r\nPoor Anna Belle! The topography of the ravine was full of hazards for\r\nher, and her seasons there were always so adventurous and full of sudden\r\nand unlooked-for bumps that her philosophy was well tested, and she\r\nmight reasonably have complained of this gratuitous blow; but she smiled\r\non, as Jewel hugged her. Her mental poise was marvelous, whatever might\r\nbe said of the physical.\r\n\r\nEloise introduced her friend and went to her mother's side, while\r\nBonnell shook hands with Mr. Evringham and exchanged some words\r\nconcerning Mr. Reeves and business matters.\r\n\r\n“Wide awake,” was the older man's mental comment. “Doesn't seem at all\r\nthe sort of person to be fooled about that healing business. Good eye.\r\nGood manner. Perhaps this was Ballard's handicap all the time. I guess\r\nyou're in for it, Madge.”\r\n\r\nNat moved to greet Mrs. Evringham, who gave him no welcoming smile. She\r\nleaned back listlessly, not caring what effect she produced. He seemed\r\nto her a part of the combination entered into by the Fates to thwart and\r\nannoy.\r\n\r\nBonnell knew her nearly as well as Eloise did. “I'm sorry you're under\r\nthe weather,” he said sympathetically, when he had discovered that, in\r\nhis own phrase, there was “nothing doing.” “I received a letter from my\r\nmother to-day, in which she impressed upon me that she expected you both\r\nby the middle of June.”\r\n\r\n“My plans have changed since yesterday, Nat,” returned Mrs. Evringham\r\ndismally. “Yes. We shall not be able to go to your mother's, as I had\r\nhoped. Some time during the season I shall try to look in on her of\r\ncourse. You tell her so, Nat, when you write.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, nonsense, Mrs. Evringham. You don't in the least mean it,” he\r\nreturned cheerfully, with the smile and manner which she could not and\r\nwould not endure.\r\n\r\n“I do mean it, Nat. I tell you my plans are changed. Eloise and I may go\r\nto Europe.”\r\n\r\nNaturally she had never thought of Europe until that moment, but that\r\nlaughing, caressing light in Nat Bonnell's eyes was insufferable.\r\n\r\n“Ah, in that case, of course,” he returned, “we couldn't say a word,”\r\n and then he moved to go.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham urged the visitor to stay to dinner, but he declined and\r\nonce more shook hands.\r\n\r\n“Good-by, Jewel,” he said to the child. “Sunday, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes indeed, I know,” she returned, an irresistible tendency to hop\r\nmoving her feet. On nearer acquaintance she had found Mr. Bonnell\r\nexhilarating.\r\n\r\n“Good-by, Nat,” said Eloise.\r\n\r\nHe looked into the face on which rested a cloud. “I think you might be a\r\ndegree more attentive,” he suggested.\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Oh--take me to the gate, for instance.”\r\n\r\nEloise smiled and went with him. He turned with a slight bow that\r\nincluded the group, and they strolled down the path.\r\n\r\n“It's all up, Madge,” remarked Mr. Evringham, half smiling. “No use\r\nwriggling, no use staying away from the mother. Might as well yield\r\ngracefully. I think Ballard might have been told, that's all.”\r\n\r\n“There was nothing to tell, father! How can you be so unkind? That's\r\njust Nat's manner. He is used to everybody liking him, and always having\r\nhis own way; but Eloise never--she _never_”--the speaker saw that if she\r\ncontinued, in a moment more she would be weeping, and she certainly was\r\nnot going to weep in this company. So she contented herself by\r\nglaring toward the gate, where could be seen two figures in earnest\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“I had counted so much on Mrs. Bonnell's influence,” Eloise was saying.\r\n“What does mother mean? She knows my mind is made up as to Christian\r\nScience. What is she afraid of?”\r\n\r\nBonnell caught his thumbs in his coat pockets and lifted himself\r\nslightly on his toes. “She is afraid of me.”\r\n\r\n“Of you?” The girl lifted surprised eyes to his and let them fall again,\r\nher grave face coloring.\r\n\r\n“She has always been more or less afraid of me. I'm ineligible, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are, awfully, Nat,” returned Eloise earnestly. “That's what\r\nmakes you so nice. Didn't we always have a good time together?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, on those rare occasions when we had a chance, but Mrs. Evringham\r\nalways suspected me. She never felt certain that I wasn't waiting for\r\nyour skirts to be lengthened and your hair to go up in order to steal\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nEloise tried to look at him, but found it more comfortable to examine\r\nthe inexpressive gravel path. “But now you have something to think of\r\nbesides girls,” she said gently.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Do you know, Eloise, if I had been promised the granting of one\r\nwish as I took the cars for Bel-Air, it would have been that I might\r\nfind you convinced of the truth of Christian Science.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him now brightly, gladly. “It is such a help to me to know\r\nthat you are in it,” she returned. Their hands simultaneously went forth\r\nand clasped. “What shall we do about mother?”\r\n\r\nHe smiled. “That will all come right,” he returned confidently.\r\n\r\n“There are classes, Nat,” she said. “Have you been through one?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet. Perhaps we could enter together.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” she returned eagerly.\r\n\r\nHe was looking down at her still--calm, strong.\r\n\r\nShe started. “I mustn't be late to dinner. Good-by. Sunday, Nat.”\r\n\r\n“Not to-morrow? I want some golf.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, go. It's a fine links. I'm sorry, but I'd better not go there for\r\nthe present. Good-by.”\r\n\r\nShe was gone, so he strolled on and out through the park, and as he\r\nwent he put two and two together, and suspected the cause of the girl's\r\nobjection to golf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nON WEDNESDAY EVENING\r\n\r\n“This is my silk dress, grandpa,” said Jewel, coming out on the piazza\r\nSunday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham was sitting there reading the paper. He looked up to\r\nbehold his granddaughter standing expectantly.\r\n\r\nShe had on the cherished frock. Her plump black legs ended in new shoes,\r\nthe brim of her large hat was wreathed with daisies, snowy ribbons\r\nfinished her well-brushed braids, while, happiest touch of all, Little\r\nFaithful was ticking away on her breast.\r\n\r\n“Well, who is this bonnie lassie?” asked Mr. Evringham, viewing her.\r\n\r\n“It's my best one,” said Jewel, smilingly, coming close to him.\r\n\r\n“I should hope so. If you were anything grander I should have to put on\r\nsmoked glasses to look at you. Church, eh?” He took the brown pamphlet\r\nshe carried and examined it.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I wish you were coming.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have an important engagement at the golf club this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Have you? Well, grandpa, I was thinking you can't play golf or ride at\r\nnight, and wouldn't you take me Wednesday evening?”\r\n\r\n“Where to?”\r\n\r\n“Church.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens, child! Wednesday evening prayer meeting?” asked the broker in\r\nperturbation.\r\n\r\n“No. It's just lovely reading and singing and interesting stories,”\r\n replied Jewel, endeavoring to paint the picture as attractively as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n“H'm. H'm. Do you suppose Mr. Reeves goes?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course,” replied the child. “Scientists never stay away.”\r\n\r\n“Then should I be considered a Scientist if I went? I still have some\r\nregard for my reputation.”\r\n\r\n“A great many visitors go,” replied the child earnestly. Then she added,\r\nwith unmistakably sincere naivete, “I don't mind leaving you in the\r\ndaytime, because we're used to it; but I was thinking it would make\r\nme homesick, grandpa, to go away in the evening and leave you in the\r\nlibrary.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham took her little hand in his. “Have you thought, Jewel,” he\r\nasked, “how it will be when you leave me altogether?”\r\n\r\n“I shall have mother and father then,” returned the child.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but whom shall I have?”\r\n\r\nThe question came curtly, and Jewel looked into the deep-set eyes in\r\nsurprise. “Shall you miss me, grandpa?” she asked wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“Whom shall I have, I say?” he repeated.\r\n\r\nThe child thought a minute. “Just who you had before,” she answered,\r\nslipping her arm around his neck. “There's Essex Maid, you know.”\r\n\r\nThe broker gave a short laugh. “Yes. It's lucky, isn't it?” he returned,\r\nrather bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Do you like to have me with you, grandpa?” pursued the child, pleased.\r\n\r\n“Yes; confound it, Jewel, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then Divine Love will fix it somehow, for I love to be with you, too.”\r\n\r\n“You do, eh? Then I'll tell you that I received a letter from your\r\nfather yesterday. It was a very pleasant letter, but it said they felt\r\nobliged, if they could, to stay over a little longer--two or three weeks\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\nThe child's face grew thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“He said they had just received your letter, and were very pleased and\r\nthankful to know that you were happy. He said it would be a business\r\nadvantage to them to stay, but that they could come home at the\r\nappointed time if you wished it. I am to cable them to-morrow, if you\r\ndo.” Silence for a minute while Jewel thought. “Do you think you can be\r\nhappy with me a little longer than you expected?”\r\n\r\n“I do want to see mother and father very much,” returned the child, “but\r\nI'm just as happy as anything,” she added heartily, after a pause.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham had listened with surprising anxiety for the verdict.\r\n“Very well, very well,” he returned, with extra brusqueness, picking up\r\nhis newspaper. “I guess there won't be anything to prevent my going\r\nto that meeting with you Wednesday evening, Jewel. Just once, you\r\nunderstand, once only.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the brougham drove around to the steps, and Eloise came\r\nout upon the piazza. She was a vision of dainty purity in her white\r\ngown, white hat, and gloves.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham rose, lifted his hat, and going down the steps opened\r\nthe door of the carriage. “A man need not be ashamed to have these two\r\nladies represent him at church,” he said, looking into Eloise's calm\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nShe smiled back at him. There was no suspicion now of sarcasm or stings.\r\nThe air she breathed was wholesome and inviting. The lump had been\r\nleavened.\r\n\r\nArrived at the hall where the services were held, the girls were ushered\r\ninto good seats before the room rapidly filled.\r\n\r\nThey saw Mr. Reeves and his family and Mr. Bonnell come in on the other\r\nside, and the latter did not rest until he had found them and sent over\r\na bright, quick nod.\r\n\r\nThe platform was beautiful by a tall vase of roses at the side of the\r\nwhite reading-desk, and Eloise listened eagerly to the voices of the\r\nman and woman who alternately read the morning lesson. The peace,\r\nsimplicity, and quiet of the service enthralled her. She looked over the\r\ncrowd of listening, reverent faces with wistful wonder. Nat was among\r\nthem, _Nat_! Sometimes she glanced across at his attentive face. Nat at\r\nchurch, in the morning; thoroughly interested! She pinched her arm to\r\nmake quite certain.\r\n\r\nOnce when they rose to sing, it was the hymn she had heard. The voices\r\nswelled:--\r\n\r\n     “O'er waiting harpstrings of the mind\r\n     There sweeps a strain,\r\n     Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind\r\n     The power of pain.”\r\n\r\nThe girl in the white dress did not sing. She swallowed often. The voice\r\nof the child at her side soared easily.\r\n\r\n     “And o'er earth's troubled, angry sea,\r\n     I see Christ walk;\r\n     And come to me, and tenderly,\r\n     Divinely, talk.”\r\n\r\nWhat a haven of promise and peace seemed this sunny, simple place of\r\npurity.\r\n\r\n     “From tired joy and grief afar,\r\n     And nearer Thee,\r\n     Father, where Thine own children are\r\n     I love to be.”\r\n\r\nJewel, looking up at her companion, was surprised to see her lashes wet\r\nand her lower lip caught between her teeth.\r\n\r\n“What's the matter, cousin Eloise?” she whispered softly as they sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe girl tried to smile. Words were not at her command. “Gladness,” she\r\nreturned briefly; which reply caused Jewel to meditate for some time.\r\n\r\nThey had a talk with Nat and were presented to the Reeves family after\r\nchurch, and Eloise felt herself in an atmosphere of love.\r\n\r\nJewel left the group for a private word to Zeke before her cousin\r\nshould come to enter the brougham. 'Zekiel sat bolt upright in the most\r\napproved style, and did not turn his face, even when the child addressed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I've been wondering this morning,” she said, “how we can manage for you\r\nto come to church, 'Zekiel.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have it six times a week,” returned the coachman.\r\n\r\n“But it's so lovely just to listen to them read and not have to hunt up\r\nthe places or anything.”\r\n\r\n“I'm satisfied with my minister,” returned Zeke, almost smiling.\r\n\r\nEloise and Mr. Bonnell came out to the carriage, so there was no further\r\ntime for talk.\r\n\r\nThe subject remained in Jewel's mind, however. On Wednesday morning,\r\njust before Mr. Evringham went to the station, the child seized him in\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa, don't you think it would be nice to go in the trolley car to\r\nchurch to-night?”\r\n\r\n“To--where?” asked the broker, frowning.\r\n\r\n“This is the night we're going to church, you know.”\r\n\r\n“The dev--Ah, to be sure. So we are. Well--a--what did you say? Trolley\r\ncar? Why?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we could all go then, you know,” returned Jewel. “Cousin Eloise\r\nwants to go, but,” the child's honesty compelled her, “she wouldn't have\r\nto go with us because it is Mr. Bonnell's last night in Bel-Air, and\r\nI heard him ask if he might come for her; but I do so want Zeke to go,\r\ngrandpa!”\r\n\r\n“Well, for the love of”--began the broker slowly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Zeke is getting to understand a good deal about Christian Science.\r\nHe has some claims of error that his mother knows about, and they make\r\nher sorry, and I've been helping him and reading to him out of my books,\r\nand I do want him to go to the testimonial meeting so much.”\r\n\r\nThe child looked wistfully up into the dark eyes that rested upon her.\r\nMr. Evringham had remarked his housekeeper's change of spirit toward the\r\nlittle girl, had wondered at the increasing and even reckless indulgence\r\nof Anna Belle, who from being an exile in the stair closet had now\r\narrived at a degree of consideration and pampering which threatened to\r\nturn her head.\r\n\r\n“Jewel,” he said impressively, “I wish you to understand one thing\r\ndistinctly. You are not now or at any future time to try to make a\r\nChristian Scientist of Essex Maid.”\r\n\r\nFrom wondering sobriety Jewel's lips broke into a gleeful smile. “I\r\ndon't have to,” she cried triumphantly. “She is one! Anyway, she has\r\ndemonstrated everything a horse ought to!”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham flung his hands over his head despairingly. “Great\r\nheavens!” he exclaimed tragically, rushing out to the brougham, Jewel at\r\nhis heels in peals of laughter.\r\n\r\nBut they went to church in the trolley car. Eloise reached the same\r\nplace with Mr. Bonnell, but whether she walked or drove or rode nobody\r\never knew, and it didn't matter much, for a full moon illumined the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nEarly in the evening a young man entered the hall quietly and took a\r\nback seat. It was Zeke.\r\n\r\nMr. Reeves saw Jewel and her grandfather come in, and softly he smote\r\nhis knee. “She's done it!” he ejaculated mentally. He noted the broker's\r\nhaughty carriage, the half challenging glances he threw to right and\r\nleft as he proceeded up the aisle to the position of Jewel's choice.\r\n\r\nMr. Reeves composed his countenance with some difficulty, and catching\r\nthe wandering eye, gave his friend a grave bow.\r\n\r\nTestimonial meetings differ in point of continued interest. This proved\r\nto be a good one. The most interesting narrative of the evening was Nat\r\nBonnell's. His self possession, fine presence, and good voice made more\r\neffective the marvelous story of his mother's resurrection to strength.\r\nHe told it with dignity and directness, and Mr. Evringham was impressed.\r\n\r\n“What's my rheumatism to that, eh, Jewel?” he whispered, as Nat sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n“Just nothing, grandpa,” replied the child.\r\n\r\n“You think the Creator'd consider me worth attending to, eh?”\r\n\r\n“God doesn't know you have the rheumatism,” exclaimed Jewel with soft\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n“Doesn't? Well! I've always supposed He thought I needed reminding on\r\naccount of a number of things, and so touched me up with that. I didn't\r\nblame Him much.\r\n\r\n“If He knew it, it would be real, and then it couldn't be changed,”\r\n returned Jewel earnestly in the ear he bent to her.\r\n\r\nThe broker sat up and looked down on her large hat and short legs.\r\n“Whew, but I'm a back number!” he mused.\r\n\r\nThe next testimonial made Jewel's eyes brighten. It was given by a man\r\nwho told a story of hopeless intemperance and his family's want. The\r\nunaffected humility and gratitude that sounded in his voice as he\r\ndescribed the changed conditions which followed his cure caused the\r\nroses to deepen in Jewel's cheeks. She wondered where Zeke was sitting.\r\n\r\nAltogether she was happy over the meeting, and her grandfather's\r\nattitude was as kindly as could have been expected.\r\n\r\nEloise came into her mother's room that night, beaming.\r\n\r\n“I wish you had come with us,” she said. “It was wonderful.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham turned to her with a lofty air. “I have too much loyalty\r\nto friendship to be seen in such a place,” she returned.\r\n\r\n“Nat said he wouldn't ask you to come down to bid him good-by, because\r\nhe expects to come out to spend Sundays for a while.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham looked at her daughter. All the girl's face had lacked of\r\nvivacity and happy expression it wore now, making her radiant.\r\n\r\n“You could never guess the news I have for you, mother.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham's lips tightened. “Eloise, if you will not marry the fine\r\nman who had my entire approval, it will be outrageous for you to marry\r\nan ineligible, a young fellow whose goods are all in the show window,\r\nwho has not proved himself in any way. I refuse to hear your news,” she\r\nreturned impetuously.\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed. “Do you mean Nat, dear?” she asked, her rosy face\r\ncoming close. “I'm afraid he's going to spoil himself by becoming\r\neligible. He has been telling me a lot about the business to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Ho! Nat Bonnell could always talk.”\r\n\r\nEloise's arms closed around her. “There's only one source of supply,\r\nmother. Nat has found Him. I am finding Him. We shall not want. What do\r\nyou think I have here for you? Grandfather gave it to me.” Eloise put\r\ninto her mother's hands a draft for a thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham appeared to lose sight of the dagger she had been seeing\r\nbefore her for days. “What is this?” she ejaculated. “A present from\r\nfather?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. Some unknown man owed it to papa, and his conscience made\r\nhim pay the debt. It came in grandfather's evening mail, and he has only\r\njust opened it.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham examined the paper eagerly.\r\n\r\n“How wonderful!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“How natural,” returned Eloise. “That is the wonderful part of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nA REALIZED HOPE\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Mr. Evringham did not return from the city at the usual\r\ntime. Jewel, watching for him, was surprised after a while to see him\r\nwalking up from the gate.\r\n\r\n“Why, what's happened?” she asked. “Zeke went for you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but he found he had to leave Dick to be shod.”\r\n\r\n“Then are you going to saddle Essex Maid yourself? Oh, can I see you do\r\nit, grandpa?” She hopped with anticipation.\r\n\r\n“I don't know that I'll ride just now. It's an excellent day for\r\nwalking. It seems rather strange to me, Jewel, that you've never shown\r\nme the Ravine of Happiness. You talk a good deal about it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, would you like to come?” cried the child, flushing. “Good! I have\r\nthe pond all fixed in Anna Belle's garden, and the ferns droop over it\r\njust like a fairy story.”\r\n\r\n“Have you put up a sign for the fairies to keep out?”\r\n\r\n“No--o,” returned Jewel, drawing in her chin and smiling.\r\n\r\n“Oh well, you may be sure they're at it, then, every moonlight night.\r\nThey haven't a particle of respect, you know, for anything. If I were in\r\nAnna Belle's place, I should put up a sign, 'Private Grounds.'”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she's so unselfish she wouldn't. If they only won't break the\r\nflowers she won't care,” returned the child, entering into the fancy\r\nwith zest.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham took the doll from her arms, and carrying it up the steps\r\ndeposited it in the piazza chair.\r\n\r\n“Isn't she going?” asked Jewel soberly.\r\n\r\n“No, not this time. She doesn't care, she's been there so much. Just see\r\nhow cheerful and comfortable she looks!”\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, a smile of almost cloying sweetness on Anna Belle's\r\ncountenance, and she seemed to be seeing pleasing visions.\r\n\r\n“I never saw such a good child!” said Jewel with an admiring sigh; then\r\nshe put her hand in her grandfather's and they strolled out into the\r\npark and up the shady road. Just before reaching the bend around which\r\nlay the gorge, Mr. Evringham surprised his companion by breaking in upon\r\nher lively chatter with a tune which he whistled loudly.\r\n\r\nIt was such an unusual ebullition that Jewel looked up at him. “Why,\r\ngrandpa, I never heard you whistle before,” she said.\r\n\r\n“You didn't? That's because you never before saw me out on a lark. I\r\ntell you, I'm a gay one when I get started,” and forthwith there burst\r\nagain from his lips a gay refrain, that sounded shrilly up the leafy\r\npath. They rounded the bend in the road, and the broker looked down into\r\nthe eyes that were bent upon him in admiration.\r\n\r\n“You whistle almost as well as Mr. Bonnell,” said the child.\r\n\r\n“Give me time and I dare say I shall beat him out,” was the swaggering\r\nresponse. “Ah, here's your ravine, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that's”--began Jewel, and went no further.\r\n\r\nA couple of rods from where she suddenly came to a standstill was an\r\nobject which for a moment rooted her to the spot. A small horse, black\r\nas jet, with a white star in his forehead and a flowing, wavy mane and\r\ntail, stood by the roadside. His coat, gleaming like satin, set off the\r\npure white leather of his trappings. On his back was fastened a side\r\nsaddle, and he was tethered to the rail of the light fence.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham appeared not to see him. He was looking down the rocks and\r\ngrass of the steep incline.\r\n\r\n“Is there any sort of a path?” he asked, “or do you descend it as you\r\nwould a cellar door? I think you might have told me, so I could change\r\nthese light trousers.”\r\n\r\n“Grandpa!” exclaimed Jewel in a hushed tone, pointing before her. “See\r\nthat horse--just like the coal black steed the princess rides in a fairy\r\nstory.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that's so. He is a beauty. Where do you suppose the princess is?”\r\n\r\n“She's probably gone down the ravine,” returned the child, her feet\r\ndrawn forward as if by a magnet. “Let's not go down yet.”\r\n\r\nThe broker allowed himself to be led close to the pony, who turned his\r\nfull bright eyes upon the pair curiously.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I might touch him, grandpa?” asked the child, still in the\r\nhushed voice.\r\n\r\n“If he's a fairy horse he might vanish,” returned Mr. Evringham. “Let's\r\nsee how he stands it.” So saying he gave the shining flank some sturdy\r\nlove pats. “Oh, he's all right. He's good substantial flesh and blood.”\r\n\r\n“But the lady,” said Jewel, looking about, the pupils of her eyes\r\ndilated with excitement.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don't think a very big lady has been riding in that saddle. You\r\ncan do as you'd be done by, I fancy.”\r\n\r\nUpon this Jewel stroked the pony over and over lovingly, and he nosed\r\nabout her in a friendly way.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa, see him, see him! And oh grandpa, see his beautiful star,\r\nwhite as a snowflake!”\r\n\r\n“Well, upon my word, if this isn't lucky,” remarked Mr. Evringham. “Here\r\nis some sugar in my pocket, now.” He passed some lumps to the child.\r\n\r\n“Would it be right?” she asked, glancing down the ravine. “Had I better\r\nwait till the girl comes up?”\r\n\r\n“She won't mind, I'll wager,” returned Mr. Evringham; so the child,\r\nthus encouraged, fed the coal black steed, who, for all his poetical\r\nappearance, had evidently a strongly developed sweet tooth.\r\n\r\n“Hello, what's this!” exclaimed the broker, stepping to the fence and\r\ntaking up something black and folded. When he shook it out, it proved to\r\nbe a child's riding skirt.\r\n\r\n“She's left it there,” said Jewel eagerly. “We ought not to touch it.\r\nIt's very hard on clothes going down the ravine, and she's left it\r\nthere. Don't you think, grandpa, you _ought_ to put it back?” for to her\r\ngreat surprise her punctilious and particular relative was shaking the\r\nfine skirt about recklessly and examining it.\r\n\r\n“Here's a name,” he said, bringing his prize to Jewel and showing her an\r\noblong bit of white cloth, much as tailors use inside dresses. “What do\r\nyou make of it?”\r\n\r\nThe child, disturbed by such daring, and dreading to see the owner of\r\nthese splendid possessions scramble up the bank, looked reluctantly.\r\n\r\nThe name was a long one, but so familiar that she recognized it at once.\r\n“Evringham.”\r\n\r\nShe lifted her eyes to her grandfather. “It's the same as ours.”\r\n\r\n“There isn't another Evringham in Bel-Air,” returned the broker. “The\r\nfairies dropped this for you, I guess, Jewel. It certainly won't fit me.\r\nLet's try it on.”\r\n\r\nHe slipped it over the head of the dazed child and hooked it around her\r\nwaist.\r\n\r\n“'It fitted her exactly,'” murmured Jewel. “They always say so in fairy\r\nstories.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said her grandfather. He put his hand into the stirrup and\r\ndrew out a folded bit of paper. He handed it to the child, who began to\r\nwonder if she was dreaming.\r\n\r\nDEAR JEWEL (she read),--I believe you expected Divine Love to send you a\r\nhorse. I have come to belong to you, and my name is STAR.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing what a large, round penmanship the pony possessed.\r\nThere was no possibility of mistaking a word.\r\n\r\nJewel read the note over twice as she stood there, the long, scant\r\nskirt, making her look tall. Mr. Evringham stood watching her. His part\r\nin the comedy was played. He waited.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him with eyes that seemed trying to comprehend a fact\r\ntoo large.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa, have you given me this horse?” she asked solemnly, and he\r\ncould see her hands beginning to tremble.\r\n\r\n“Oh, am _I_ to get some credit for this?” returned the broker, smiling\r\nand twisting his mustache. “I didn't expect that.”\r\n\r\nHe knew her lack of motion would not last long, and was bracing himself\r\nfor the attack when, to his surprise, she pulled up the impeding skirt\r\nand made a rush, not for him, but for the pony. Hiding her face on the\r\ncreature's satin shoulder, she flung her arm around his throat, and\r\nseizing his rippling mane, sobbed as if her heart would break.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham had not spent weeks in selecting and testing a horse for\r\nhis granddaughter without choosing one whose nervous system would be\r\nproof against sudden assaults of affection; but this onslaught was so\r\nenergetic that the pony tossed his head and backed to the end of his\r\ntether.\r\n\r\nHis new mistress stumbled after him, her face still hidden. She was\r\ntrying heroically to stifle the sobs that were shaking her from head to\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n“Jewel, Jewel, child!” ejaculated her grandfather, much dismayed. “Come,\r\ncome, what's this?”\r\n\r\nHe drew her with a strong hand, and she deserted the pony, much to the\r\nlatter's relief, and clasping Mr. Evringham as high up as she could\r\nreach, began bedewing his vest buttons with her tears.\r\n\r\n“Oh, gra--grandpa, I c--can't have him!” she sobbed. “There isn't any\r\nroo--room for him in our--our fla--fla--flat!”\r\n\r\n“Well, did you expect to keep him in the flat?” inquired Mr. Evringham,\r\nstooping tenderly, his own eyes shining suspiciously, as he put his arms\r\naround the little shaking form.\r\n\r\n“N--no; but we--we haven't any bar--barn.”\r\n\r\nThe broker smiled above the voluminous, quivering bows.\r\n\r\n“Well, hasn't some good livery man in your neighborhood a stable?”\r\n\r\n“Ye--yes.” Jewel made greater efforts to stop crying. “But I--I talked\r\nwith mo--mother once about cou--could I ha--have a horse sometime before\r\nI grew up, and she said she might buy the horse, but it would cost so\r\nmuch--much money every week to board it, it would be error.”\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham patted the heaving shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Ah, but you don't know yet all about your horse. In some respects I've\r\nnever seen a pony like him.”\r\n\r\n“I--I never have,” returned the child.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you'll be surprised at _this_. This pony has a bank account.”\r\n\r\nJewel slowly grew quiet.\r\n\r\n“Nobody has to pay for _his_ board and clothes. He is very independent.\r\nHe would have it that way.”\r\n\r\n“Grandpa!” came in muffled tones from the broker's vest.\r\n\r\n“So don't you think you'd better cheer up and look at him once more, and\r\ntell him you won't cry on his shoulder very often?”\r\n\r\nIn a minute Jewel looked up, revealing her swollen eyes. “I'm ashamed,”\r\n she said softly, “but he was--so--be--_autiful_--I forgot to remember.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess you did forget to remember,” returned Mr. Evringham,\r\nshaking his head and leading the child to her pony's side.\r\n\r\nHe lifted her into the saddle and arranged her skirt, brushing away the\r\ndust.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa!” she exclaimed softly, with a long, quivering sigh, “I'm so\r\n_happy_!”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever ridden, Jewel?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, a thousand times,” she answered quickly; “but not on a real\r\nhorse,” she added as an afterthought.\r\n\r\n“H'm. That might make a difference.” Mr. Evringham loosed the pony\r\nand put the white bridle in the child's hands; then he led the pretty\r\ncreature down the woodland road.\r\n\r\n“I'm _so_ happy,” repeated Jewel. “What will mother and father say!”\r\n\r\n“You'll be a regular circus rider by the time they come home.”\r\n\r\nAs the broker spoke these words Zeke appeared around the bend in the\r\nroad, riding Essex Maid. His face was alight with interest in the sight\r\nthat met him.\r\n\r\nJewel called to him radiantly. “Oh, Zeke, what do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I think it's great,” he responded. “Hello, little kid,” he said, as he\r\ncame nearer and perceived the signs in the child's face. “Pony do any\r\nharm, Mr. Evringham?” he asked with respectful concern.\r\n\r\n“No; Jewel cried a little, but it was only because I told her she could\r\nnot sleep nights in Star's manger.”\r\n\r\nThe child gave one look of astonishment at the speaker's grave\r\ncountenance, and then shouted with a laugh as spontaneous as though no\r\ntear had ever fallen from her shining eyes.\r\n\r\n“See Essex Maid look at my pony, grandpa!” she said joyously. “She looks\r\nso proud and stuck _up_.”\r\n\r\n“Look away, my lady,” said the broker. “You'll see a great deal more of\r\nthis young spring before you see less.”\r\n\r\nZeke dismounted.\r\n\r\n“Now then,” Mr. Evringham looked up at the child. “I'm going to let go\r\nyour bridle.”\r\n\r\n“I want you to,” she answered gayly.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham mounted his horse. “We'll take a sedate walk through the\r\nwoods,” he said. “Zeke, you might lead her a little way.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, _please_,” begged the child. “I know how to ride. I _do_.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let her go then,” smiled the broker, and Essex Maid trotted\r\nslowly, noting with haughty bright eyes the little black companion,\r\nwho might have stepped out of a picture book, but whose easy canter was\r\ntossing Jewel at every step.\r\n\r\n“I haven't--any--whip!” The words were bounced out of the child's lips,\r\nand Mr. Evringham's laugh resounded along the avenue.\r\n\r\n“I believe she'd use it,” he said to Zeke, who was running along beside\r\nthe black pony.\r\n\r\n“I guess she would, sir,” grinned the young fellow responsively.\r\n\r\nIt was not many days before Jewel had learned to stay in the saddle. She\r\nhad an efficient teacher who worked with her _con amore_, and the sight\r\nof the erect, gray-haired man on his famous mare, always accompanied\r\nby the rosy little girl on a black pony, came to be a familiar sight in\r\nBel-Air, and one which people always turned to follow with their eyes.\r\n\r\nEloise had her talk with Mr. Evringham one evening when Jewel was\r\nexcluded from the library, and she emerged from the interview with a\r\nmore contented heart than she had known for a year.\r\n\r\nShe endeavored to convey the situation to her mother in detail, but when\r\nthat lady had learned that there were no happy surprises, she declined\r\nto listen.\r\n\r\n“Tastes differ, Eloise,” she said. “I am one who believes that where\r\nignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise.” Mrs. Evringham had regained a\r\nquite light-hearted appearance in the interest of expending a portion of\r\nher windfall on her own and Eloise's summer wardrobe.\r\n\r\n“Well, you shan't be bothered then,” returned her daughter. “You have me\r\nto take care of our money matters.”\r\n\r\n“I prefer to let father do it,” returned Mrs. Evringham decidedly. “He\r\nis a changed being of late, and we are as well situated as we could hope\r\nto be. I don't feel quite satisfied with the lining of the brougham, but\r\nsome day I mean to speak of it.”\r\n\r\nEloise threw up both hands, but she laughed. She and her grandfather had\r\nan excellent understanding, and she knew that the mills of the gods were\r\nabout to grind.\r\n\r\nOne evening the broker called his daughter-in-law into the library.\r\n\r\n“I hope it isn't on business,” she remarked flippantly as she entered.\r\n“I tell you right at the start, father, I can't understand it.” Her eyes\r\nwandered about the room curiously. It was strange to her. She took up a\r\nwoman's picture from the desk. “Who is this?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“How do you like the face?” he returned.\r\n\r\nThe dark eyes and sweet mouth looked back at her. She frowned slightly.\r\nShe did not like the situation in which she had found the photograph. It\r\nwas far too intimate for a stranger, and made her a little nervous.\r\n\r\n“If he is going to marry again, then good-by indeed!” she thought.\r\n\r\n“I think it is rather sentimental,” she returned, with an air of\r\nengaging candor, “don't you? Just my first impression, you know; but\r\nit's a face I shouldn't trust. Who is it?”\r\n\r\n“It is Jewel's mother,” returned the broker quietly, “my daughter Julia.\r\nJewel brought it down last night, also a lot of little letters her\r\nmother had put in the pockets of the child's dresses when she packed\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Mrs. Evringham triumphantly. “Didn't I say she was\r\nsentimental? About that sort of thing my perceptions are always so\r\nkeen.”\r\n\r\n“H'm. I read the letters, and I judged from them that one can trust her.\r\nWill you be seated?” He placed a chair. “I should like to ask your plans\r\nfor the summer.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham looked up quickly, startled. “Oh, I haven't any. Have\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I always seek some cool spot. You have an invitation to View\r\nPoint, I understand. You could scarcely do better.”\r\n\r\n“I have reasons, father,” impressively, “reasons for declining that.”\r\n\r\n“Then where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“I would just as lief stay here and take care of your house as not,”\r\n declared the lady magnanimously.\r\n\r\n“Ha! Without any servants?”\r\n\r\n“Why, what do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“They are going away for a vacation. I am intending to have the house\r\nwired, and Mrs. Forbes and Zeke will hold sway in the barn. She doesn't\r\nwish to leave him.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham was silenced and dismayed. She felt herself being firmly\r\nand inexorably pushed out of this well-lined nest.\r\n\r\nHer eyes fell before the impenetrable ones regarding her.\r\n\r\n“How did Jewel ever win him?” she thought. The picturesque pony, with\r\nhis arched neck and expensive trappings, had outraged her feelings for\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n“About the View Point plan,” continued Mr. Evringham deliberately.\r\n“I think there are influences waiting for you there that will be of\r\nbenefit. There is a new philosophy percolating in these days through our\r\nworldly rubbish which you and I would be the better for grasping. Your\r\nchances are better than mine, for you are young still. Your daughter is\r\nexpanding like a flower already, in the first rays of her understanding\r\nof it. This young man whom you fancy you can avoid is a help to her. Mr.\r\nReeves was talking to me about him last night. He says that so far as\r\nhis business is concerned, young Bonnell is proving the square peg in\r\nthe square hole. I don't know what Eloise's sentiments are toward him,\r\nbut I do know that she shall be independent of any one's financial help\r\nbut mine.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Evringham lifted her eyes hopefully.\r\n\r\n“I shall eke out the little income which is left to you with sufficient\r\nfor you to live--not as you have done--but comfortably.”\r\n\r\nThe eager light faded from his listener's eyes.\r\n\r\n“Eloise and I have arranged that,” he continued, “and she is satisfied.\r\nTake my advice, Madge. Go to View Point.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose Eloise doesn't need horses so long as Jewel has them,” said\r\nMrs. Evringham rising.\r\n\r\nHer host followed her example. “She thinks not,” he returned concisely;\r\nthen he opened the library door, and his daughter-in-law swept from his\r\npresence with all the dignity she could muster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nAT TWILIGHT\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, and Mr. Bonnell was dining at Bel-Air Park. Had Jewel\r\nthought of it, she might have contrasted the expression of Mrs. Forbes's\r\nface as she waited at table this evening with the look it wore on the\r\nday she first arrived; might have noted the cheerful flow of talk which\r\nenlivened the board, in distinction from the stiff silence or bitter\r\nrepartee which once chilled her. As she responded to the smiles hovering\r\nnow about Eloise's lovely lips, she might have remembered the once\r\nsombre sadness of those eyes. Even Mrs. Evringham had buried\r\nthe Macbethian dagger, and wore the meek and patient air of one\r\nmisunderstood; but nothing would have amazed the child so much as to be\r\ntold that she had had anything to do with this metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nAnna Belle,--deserted often now, perforce, on account of the pony,\r\nwhose life was a strenuous one, owing to the variety of Jewel's\r\nattentions,--Anna Belle was petted with extra fondness when her turn\r\ncame; and she sat at table now in a pleasing trance, her smile an\r\nimpartial benediction upon all.\r\n\r\nIt had been a glorious June day, the park was at its best. After dinner\r\nthe family strolled out toward the piazza.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forbes had attended her own Baptist church that morning, and the\r\nfamiliar Sunday-school tune that the children sang floated through her\r\nmind as she looked after the group.\r\n\r\n     “When He cometh, when He cometh,\r\n     To make up His jewels,\r\n     All His pure ones, all His bright ones,\r\n     His loved and His own.\r\n\r\n     “Little children, little children,\r\n     Who love their Redeemer,\r\n     Are the jewels, precious jewels,\r\n     His loved and His own.”\r\n\r\n“What is Mr. Evringham going to do without that child?” she thought.\r\n\r\nThe broker was invaded with the same problem as Jewel lingered with\r\nhim on the piazza, while the others walked on toward a seat beneath a\r\nspreading maple.\r\n\r\nHe ensconced himself in his favorite chair. The thrushes were singing\r\nvespers. The pure air was faintly and deliciously scented.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa, is it too late to bring Star out for a nibble?” asked the\r\nlittle girl wistfully.\r\n\r\n“No, I guess not,” returned the broker as he opened his cigar case.\r\n“Star may have a short life, but he's certainly experiencing a merry\r\none. There's no moss gathering on that pony.”\r\n\r\nJewel had not waited for more than the permission. She was fleeing\r\ntoward the barn.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham lighted his cigar, and then his eye fell upon the doll,\r\ntoo hastily set down, and fallen at a distressing angle. Her eyes were\r\nclosed as if her sensibilities had been shocked overmuch.\r\n\r\n“Anna Belle, Anna Belle, has it come to this!” he murmured, picking\r\nup the neglected one, who, with her usual elasticity and exuberance\r\nof spirit, at once opened her eyes and beamed optimistically on her\r\nrescuer. He set her, facing him, on his knee. “Such is youth!” he\r\nsighed. “When she throws you down, I feel that I'm not going to be\r\nso recuperative as you, Anna Belle. I have a plan, however, a plan of\r\nself-defense; but if it weren't for your discretion, I shouldn't tell it\r\nto you, for I'm an old bird, young lady, and can't be caught with chaff.\r\nThere are many worthy persons who may rise to lofty heights in eternity,\r\nwho nevertheless, meanwhile are not desirable to sit opposite a man at\r\nhis breakfast table. A visit, Anna Belle, a short visit from my daughter\r\nJulia is all I shall ask for at first, and I shall test her, test her,\r\nmy dear. I'll look at her through a magnifying glass. Of course, if\r\nthey'd give me Jewel, it would be all I'd ask for; but they won't. That\r\nis self-evident.”\r\n\r\nHere the child came around the corner of the house, leading her pet by a\r\nhalter, but with her hand in his mane as she pressed close to his side,\r\ncaressing and talking to him. In fact it was the harassing problem of\r\nthe pony's life to manage to avoid stepping on her. Zeke lounged in the\r\nbackground on account equally of his orders and his inclination.\r\n\r\nStar began cropping the grass, and Mr. Evringham continued his\r\ndisquisition to the bright-eyed young person on his knee:--\r\n\r\n“My son Harry is turning out a pretty good sort, I fancy. I'm not\r\nparticularly shy of giving him a trial, provided he'll do the same by\r\nme; but I suppose he will have to go West at first, anyway. Julia is a\r\ndifferent thing. I can't whistle her on and off with the same frankness;\r\nand I must be careful, Anna Belle. Do you understand? Careful! And I'm\r\ngoing to be, by Jove, in spite of the way it makes me cringe to think\r\nof this big house, empty as a drum. It wasn't empty before, that's the\r\nmischief of it. What has happened to me? I thought things were well\r\nenough in those days. Nobody whom I knew was particularly happy. Why\r\nshould I be?”\r\n\r\nThe thrushes stopped, for Jewel's childish voice floated out on the\r\nevening air.\r\n\r\nMr. Evringham knew what had happened. He knew that Zeke had asked her to\r\nsing. They two were sitting on the ground, while the pony cropped away\r\nat the sweet grass.\r\n\r\n     “From tired joy and grief afar,\r\n     And nearer Thee,\r\n     Father, where Thine own children are\r\n     I love to be!”\r\n\r\nThe broker listened for a minute.\r\n\r\n“I'll take Jewel and her mother to the seashore somewhere; for I must\r\nleave the house, if only to let Madge down easily, and too, I wish to\r\nstudy Julia outside her atmosphere. Poor Madge, she's a light weight,\r\nbut I think there are better times coming for her. At View Point she'll\r\nfind friends.”\r\n\r\nTime passed, and at last Mr. Evringham called, “That will do, Jewel.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want Star to go in?” she returned.\r\n\r\nThe broker nodded, and the child sprang up and began patting and\r\nsmoothing the little horse with energetic affection.\r\n\r\n“It's your bedtime, Star,” she said, “but morning's coming.” She kissed\r\nhis sleek shoulder. “We'll have such a good time in the morning. I don't\r\nbounce a bit now, do I, Zeke?” she asked, turning to him.\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess not,” returned Zeke scornfully. “You ain't the kind that\r\ngets bounced after a fellow knows you,” he added, smiling. He took the\r\npony's halter. “Good-night, Jewel.”\r\n\r\n“Good-night, Zeke.” She ran across the lawn and up the piazza steps.\r\n“How kind of you, grandpa, to amuse Anna Belle!” she exclaimed\r\ngratefully, observing the doll on his knee. At the same time she most\r\nabruptly whisked that patient person into a neighboring chair and\r\nusurped her place. Cuddling down in her grandfather's arms, she nestled\r\nher head against his shoulder and sighed happily.\r\n\r\nThe light began to fade, the last smoke from the broker's cigar curled\r\nout into the summer air. He tossed it away and pressed the child more\r\nclosely to him.\r\n\r\n“Sing once again the song you sang for Zeke.” he said.\r\n\r\nAnd she began softly in her true, clear voice:--\r\n\r\n     “From tired joy and grief afar,\r\n     And nearer Thee,\r\n     Father, where Thine own children are\r\n     I love to be!”\r\n\r\n“Amen,” breathed Mr. Evringham.",
