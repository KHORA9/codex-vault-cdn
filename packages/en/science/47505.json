Whence comes this intimate one? who is he? what is his\r\nbusiness? He is only known as a friend of the house. He has no other\r\ntitle, and he is almost proud of having no other. Stripped of his\r\nown personality, he speaks only of the labours and the success of\r\nhis illustrious friend, in the radiance of whose glory he moves with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nThe author of this work is a person of this description. Intimately\r\nconnected with the life of M. Pasteur, and a constant inmate of his\r\nlaboratory, he has passed happy years near this great investigator, who\r\nhas discovered a new world--the world of the infinitely little. Since\r\nthe first studies of M. Pasteur on molecular dissymmetry, down to his\r\nmost recent investigations on hydrophobia, on virulent diseases, and on\r\nthe artificial cultures of living contagia, which have been converted\r\nby such cultures into veritable vaccines--passing by the intermediate\r\ncelebrated experiments on spontaneous generation, fermentation, the\r\ndiseases of wine, the manufacture of beer and vinegar, and the diseases\r\nof silkworms--the author of these pages has been able, if not to\r\nwitness all, at least to follow in its principal developments this\r\nuninterrupted series of scientific conquests.\r\n\r\n'What a beautiful book,' he remarked one day to M. Pasteur, 'might be\r\nwritten about all this!'\r\n\r\n'But it is all in the Comptes-rendus of the Academy of Sciences.'\r\n\r\n'It is not for the readers of the Comptes-rendus that such a book needs\r\nto be written, but for the great public, who know that you have done\r\ngreat things, but who know it only vaguely, by the records of journals,\r\nor by fragments of biography. The persons are few who know the history\r\nof your discoveries. What was your point of departure? How have you\r\narrived at such and such principles, and at the consequences which\r\nflow from these principles? What is the connection and rigorous bond\r\nof your method? These are the things which it would be interesting to\r\nput together in a book which would have some chance of enduring as an\r\nhistoric document.'\r\n\r\n'I could not waste my time in going back upon things already\r\naccomplished.'\r\n\r\n'No; but my desire is that someone else should consecrate his time to\r\nthe work. And listen,' added this friend, with audacious frankness--'do\r\nyou know by whom, in my opinion, this book ought to be written? By\r\na man who, without having been in any way trained to follow in your\r\nfootsteps, is animated by the most lively desire to understand the\r\ncourse which you have pursued; who, while living at your side, has been\r\neach day impregnated with your method and your ideas; who, having had\r\nthe happiness of comprehending your life and its achievements, does not\r\nwish to confine the pleasure thus derived to himself alone.'\r\n\r\n'Where, then,' interrupted Pasteur with a kindly smile, not without a\r\ntinge of irony, 'is this man, at once so happy, and so impatient to\r\nshare his happiness with others?'\r\n\r\n'He is now pleading his cause before you. Yes, I would gladly attempt\r\nsuch a work. I have seen your efforts and observed your success. The\r\nexperiments which I have not witnessed you have always freely explained\r\nto me, with that gift of clearness which Vauvenargues called the\r\n\"polish\" of masters.[1] Initiated by affection, I would make myself\r\ninitiator by admiration. It would be the history of a learned man by\r\nan ignorant one. My ignorance would save me from dwelling too strictly\r\nor too long on technical details. With the exposition of your doctrine\r\nI would mingle some fragments of your biography. I would pass from a\r\ndiscovery to an anecdote, and so arrange matters as to give the book\r\nnot only the character of a familiar scientific conversation, which\r\nwould hardly be more than the echo of what I have learnt while near\r\nyou, but also to make it a reflex of your life.'\r\n\r\n'You should postpone that until I am no longer here.'\r\n\r\n'Why so? Why, before assigning to them their places, should we wait\r\ntill those whose names will endure have disappeared from the scene?\r\nNo; it is you, living, that I wish to paint--you, in full work, in the\r\nmidst of your laboratory. And, in addition to all other considerations,\r\nI would add, that your presence in the flesh will be the guarantee of\r\nmy exactitude.'\r\n\r\n  _July 1883._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] 'Vernis des maîtres.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         PAGE\r\n\r\n                INTRODUCTION, BY PROFESSOR TYNDALL         xi\r\n\r\n                RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD\r\n                  AND YOUTH--FIRST DISCOVERIES              1\r\n\r\n                FERMENTATION                               40\r\n\r\n                ACETIC FERMENTATION--\r\n                  THE MANUFACTURE OF VINEGAR               66\r\n\r\n                THE QUESTION OF SPONTANEOUS GENERATION     89\r\n\r\n                STUDIES ON WINE                           112\r\n\r\n                THE SILKWORM-DISEASE                      127\r\n\r\n                DECISIVE EXPERIMENTS                      164\r\n\r\n                STUDIES ON BEER                           168\r\n\r\n                VIRULENT DISEASES--SPLENIC FEVER,\r\n                  SEPTICÆMIA                              176\r\n\r\n\r\n                FOWL CHOLERA                              212\r\n\r\n                ATTENUATED VIRUS, OR VACCINATION--\r\n                  THE FOWL CHOLERA VACCINE                220\r\n\r\n                THE VACCINE OF SPLENIC FEVER              231\r\n\r\n                THE RETURN TO VIRULENCE                   246\r\n\r\n                ETIOLOGY OF SPLENIC FEVER                 250\r\n\r\n                METHOD OF DISCUSSION AND CONTRADICTIONS   262\r\n\r\n                THE LABORATORY OF THE ÉCOLE NORMALE--\r\n                  VARIOUS STUDIES--HYDROPHOBIA            271\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the present year the French original of this work\r\nwas sent to me from Paris by its author. It was accompanied by a letter\r\nfrom M. Pasteur, expressing his desire to have the work translated and\r\npublished in England. Responding to this desire, I placed the book in\r\nthe hands of the Messrs. Longman, who, in the exercise of their own\r\njudgment, decided on publication. The translation was confided, at my\r\nsuggestion, to Lady Claud Hamilton.\r\n\r\nThe translator's task was not always an easy one, but it has, I\r\nthink, been well executed. A few slight abbreviations, for which I\r\nam responsible, have been introduced, but in no case do they affect\r\nthe sense. It was, moreover, found difficult to render into suitable\r\nEnglish the title of the original: '_M. Pasteur, Histoire d'un Savant\r\npar un Ignorant_.' A less piquant and antithetical English title was,\r\ntherefore, substituted for the French one.\r\n\r\nThis filial tribute, for such it is, was written, under the immediate\r\nsupervision of M. Pasteur, by his devoted and admiring son-in-law, M.\r\nValery Radot. It is the record of a life of extraordinary scientific\r\nardour and success, the picture of a mind on which facts fall like\r\ngerms upon a nutritive soil, and, like germs so favoured, undergo rapid\r\nincrease and multiplication. One hardly knows which to admire most--the\r\nintuitive vision which discerns in advance the new issues to which\r\nexisting data point, or the skill in device, the adaptation of means\r\nto ends, whereby the intuition is brought to the test and ordeal of\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nIn the investigation of microscopic organisms--the 'infinitely little,'\r\nas Pouchet loved to call them--and their doings in this our world,\r\nM. Pasteur has found his true vocation. In this broad field it has\r\nbeen his good fortune to alight upon a crowd of connected problems\r\nof the highest public and scientific interest, ripe for solution,\r\nand requiring for their successful treatment the precise culture and\r\ncapacities which he has brought to bear upon them. He may regret his\r\nabandonment of molecular physics; he may look fondly back upon the\r\nhopes with which his researches on the tartrates and paratartrates\r\ninspired him; he may think that great things awaited him had he\r\ncontinued to labour in this line. I do not doubt it. But this does not\r\nshake my conviction that he yielded to the natural affinities of his\r\nintellect, that he obeyed its truest impulses, and reaped its richest\r\nrewards, in pursuing the line that he has chosen, and in which his\r\nlabours have rendered him one of the most conspicuous scientific\r\nfigures of this age.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the earliest labours of M. Pasteur, a few remarks\r\nsupplementary to those of M. Radot may be introduced here. The days\r\nwhen angels whispered into the hearkening human ear, secrets which had\r\nno root in man's previous knowledge or experience, are gone for ever.\r\nThe only revelation--and surely it deserves the name--now open to the\r\nwise arises from 'intending the mind' on acquired knowledge. When,\r\ntherefore, M. Radot, following M. Pasteur, speaks with such emphasis\r\nabout 'preconceived ideas,' he does not mean ideas without antecedents.\r\nPreconceived ideas, if out of deference to M. Pasteur the term be\r\nadmitted, are the vintage of garnered facts. We in England should\r\nrather call them inductions, which, as M. Pasteur truly says, inspire\r\nthe mind, and shape its course, in the subsequent work of deduction and\r\nverification.\r\n\r\nAt the time when M. Pasteur undertook his investigation of the diseases\r\nof silkworms, which led to such admirable results, he had never seen a\r\nsilkworm; but, so far from this being considered a disqualification,\r\nM. Dumas regarded his freedom from preconceived ideas a positive\r\nadvantage. His first care was to make himself acquainted with what\r\nothers had done. To their observations he added his own, and then,\r\nsurveying all, came to the conclusion that the origin of the disease\r\nwas to be sought, not in the worms, not in the eggs, but in the moths\r\nwhich laid the eggs. I am not sure that this conclusion is happily\r\ndescribed as 'a preconceived idea.' Every whipster may have his\r\npreconceived ideas; but the divine power, so largely shared by M.\r\nPasteur, of distilling from facts their essences--of extracting from\r\nthem the principles from which they flow--is given only to a few.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith regard to the discovery of crystalline facets in the tartrates,\r\nwhich has been dwelt upon by M. Radot, a brief reference to antecedent\r\nlabours may be here allowed. It had been discovered by Arago, in 1811,\r\nand by Biot, in 1812 and 1818, that a plate of rock-crystal, cut\r\nperpendicular to the axis of the prism, possessed the power of rotating\r\nthe plane of polarisation through an angle, dependent on the thickness\r\nof the plate and the refrangibility of the light. It had, moreover,\r\nbeen proved by Biot that there existed two species of rock-crystal,\r\none of which turned the plane of polarisation to the right, and the\r\nother to the left. They were called, respectively, right-handed and\r\nleft-handed crystals. No external difference of crystalline form was\r\nat first noticed which could furnish a clue to this difference of\r\naction. But closer scrutiny revealed upon the crystals minute facets,\r\nwhich, in the one class, were ranged along a right-handed, and, in\r\nthe other, along a left-handed spiral. The symmetry of the hexagonal\r\nprism, and of the two terminal pyramids of the crystal, was disturbed\r\nby the introduction of these spirally-arranged facets. They constituted\r\nthe outward and visible sign of that inward and invisible molecular\r\nstructure which produced the observed action, and difference of action,\r\non polarised light.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the celebrated Mitscherlich brought forward his\r\ntartrates and paratartrates of ammonia and soda, and affirmed them to\r\npossess the same atoms, the same internal arrangement of atoms, and\r\nthe same outward crystalline form, one of them, nevertheless, causing\r\nthe plane of polarisation to rotate, while the other did not, Pasteur,\r\nremembering, no doubt, the observations just described, instituted a\r\nsearch for facets like those discovered in rock-crystal, and which,\r\nwithout altering chemical constitution, destroyed crystalline identity.\r\nHe first found such facets in the tartrates, while he subsequently\r\nproved the neutrality of the paratartrate to be due to the equal\r\nadmixture of right-handed and left-handed crystals, one of which, when\r\nthe paratartrate was dissolved, exactly neutralised the other.\r\n\r\nPrior to Pasteur the left-handed tartrate was unknown. Its discovery,\r\nmoreover, was supplemented by a series of beautiful researches on the\r\ncompounds of right-handed and left-handed tartaric acid; he having\r\npreviously extracted from the two tartrates, acids which, in regard\r\nto polarised light, behaved like themselves. Such was the worthy\r\nopening of M. Pasteur's scientific career, which has been dwelt upon so\r\nfrequently and emphatically by M. Radot. The wonder, however, is, not\r\nthat a searcher of such penetration as Pasteur should have discovered\r\nthe facets of the tartrates, but that an investigator so powerful and\r\nexperienced as Mitscherlich should have missed them.\r\n\r\nThe idea of molecular dissymmetry, introduced by Biot, was forced\r\nupon Biot's mind by the discovery of a number of liquids, and of some\r\nvapours, which possessed the rotatory power. Some, moreover, turned the\r\nplane of polarisation to the right, others to the left. Crystalline\r\nstructure being here out of the question, the notion of dissymmetry,\r\nderived from the crystal, was transferred to the molecule. 'To produce\r\nany such phenomena,' says Sir John Herschel, 'the individual molecule\r\nmust be conceived as unsymmetrically constituted.' The illustrations\r\nemployed by M. Pasteur to elucidate this subject, though well\r\ncalculated to give a general idea of dissymmetry, will, I fear, render\r\nbut little aid to the reader in his attempts to realise _molecular_\r\ndissymmetry. Should difficulty be encountered here at the threshold\r\nof this work, I would recommend the reader not to be daunted by it,\r\nor prevented by it from going further. He may comfort himself by the\r\nassurance that the conception of a dissymmetric molecule is not a very\r\nprecise one, even in the mind of M. Pasteur.\r\n\r\nOne word more with regard to the parentage of preconceived ideas.\r\nM. Radot informs us that at Strasburg M. Pasteur invoked the aid of\r\nhelices and magnets, with a view to rendering crystals dissymmetrical\r\nat the moment of their formation. There can, I think, be but little\r\ndoubt that such experiments were suggested by the pregnant discovery of\r\nFaraday published in 1845. By both helices and magnets Faraday caused\r\nthe plane of polarisation in perfectly neutral liquids and solids to\r\nrotate. If the turning of the plane of polarisation be a demonstration\r\nof molecular dissymmetry, then, in the twinkling of an eye, Faraday was\r\nable to displace symmetry by dissymmetry, and to confer upon bodies,\r\nwhich in their ordinary state were inert and dead, this power of\r\nrotation which M. Pasteur considers to be the exclusive attribute of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of M. Pasteur here referred to, which M. Radot justly\r\ndescribes as 'worthy of the most serious consideration,' is sure\r\nto arrest the attention of a large class of people, who, dreading\r\n'materialism,' are ready to welcome any generalisation which\r\ndifferentiates the living world from the dead. M. Pasteur considers\r\nthat his researches point to an irrefragable physical barrier between\r\norganic and inorganic nature. Never, he says, have you been able to\r\nproduce in the laboratory, by the ordinary processes of chemistry, a\r\ndissymmetric molecule--in other words, a substance which, in a state\r\nof solution, where molecular forces are paramount, has the power of\r\ncausing a polarised beam to rotate. This power belongs exclusively to\r\nderivatives from the living world. Dissymmetric _forces_, different\r\nfrom those of the laboratory, are, in Pasteur's mind, the agents of\r\nvitality; it is they that build up dissymmetric molecules which baffle\r\nthe chemist when he attempts to reproduce them. Such molecules trace\r\ntheir ancestry to life alone. 'Pourrait-on indiquer une séparation plus\r\nprofonde entre les produits de la nature vivante, et ceux de la nature\r\nminérale, que cette dissymmétrie chez les uns, et son absence chez les\r\nautres?' It may be worth calling to mind that molecular dissymmetry\r\nis the _idea_, or _inference_, the observed rotation of the plane of\r\npolarisation, by masses of sensible magnitude, being the _fact_ on\r\nwhich the inference is based.\r\n\r\nThat the molecule, or unit brick, of an organism should be different\r\nfrom the molecule of a mineral is only to be expected, for otherwise\r\nthe profound distinction between them would disappear. And that\r\none of the differences between the two classes of molecules should\r\nbe the possession, by the one, of this power of rotation, and its\r\nnon-possession by the other, would be a fact, interesting no doubt, but\r\nnot surprising. The critical point here has reference to the power\r\nand range of chemical processes, apart from the play of vitality.\r\nBeginning with the elements themselves, can they not be so combined\r\nas to produce organic compounds? Not to speak of the antecedent\r\nlabours of Wöhler and others in Germany, it is well known that various\r\nFrench investigators, among whom are some of M. Pasteur's illustrious\r\ncolleagues of the Academy, have succeeded in forming substances which\r\nwere once universally regarded as capable of being elaborated by plants\r\nand animals alone. Even with regard to the rotation of the plane of\r\npolarisation, M. Jungfleisch, an extremely able pupil of the celebrated\r\nBerthelot, affirms that the barrier erected by M. Pasteur has been\r\nbroken down; and though M. Pasteur questions this affirmation, it is at\r\nleast hazardous, where so many supposed distinctions between organic\r\nand inorganic have been swept away, to erect a new one. For my part, I\r\nfrankly confess my disbelief in its permanence.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for new facts, those already in our possession tend, I\r\nthink, to render the association which M. Pasteur seeks to establish\r\nbetween dissymmetry and life insecure. Quartz, as a crystal, exerts\r\na very powerful twist on the plane of polarisation. Quartz dissolved\r\nexerts no power at all. The molecules of quartz, then, do not belong to\r\nthe same category as the crystal of which they are the constituents;\r\nthe former are symmetrical, the latter is dissymmetrical. This, in my\r\nopinion, is a very significant fact. By the act of crystallisation, and\r\nwithout the intervention of life, the forces of molecules, possessing\r\nplanes of symmetry, are so compounded as to build up crystals which\r\nhave no planes of symmetry. Thus, in passing from the symmetrical to\r\nthe dissymmetrical, we are not compelled to interpolate new forces; the\r\nforces extant in mineral nature suffice. The reasoning which applies\r\nto the dissymmetric crystal applies to the dissymmetric molecule. The\r\ndissymmetry of the latter, however pronounced and complicated, arises\r\nfrom the composition of atomic forces which, when reduced to their\r\nmost elementary action, are exerted along straight lines. In 1865 I\r\nventured, in reference to this subject, to define the position which I\r\nam still inclined to maintain. 'It is the compounding, in the organic\r\nworld, of forces belonging equally to the inorganic that constitutes\r\nthe mystery and the miracle of vitality.'[2]\r\n\r\nAdd to these considerations the discovery of Faraday already adverted\r\nto. An electric current is not an organism, nor does a magnet possess\r\nlife; still, by their action, Faraday, in his first essay, converted\r\nover one hundred and fifty symmetric and inert aqueous solutions into\r\ndissymmetric and active ones.[3]\r\n\r\nTheory, however, may change, and inference may fade away, but\r\nscientific experiment endures for ever. Such durability belongs, in\r\nthe domain of molecular physics, to the experimental researches of M.\r\nPasteur.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe weightiest events of life sometimes turn upon small hinges; and\r\nwe now come to the incident which caused M. Pasteur to quit a line\r\nof research the abandonment of which he still regrets. A German\r\nmanufacturer of chemicals had noticed that the impure commercial\r\ntartrate of lime, sullied with organic matters of various kinds,\r\nfermented on being dissolved in water and exposed to summer heat. Thus\r\nprompted, Pasteur prepared some pure, right-handed tartrate of ammonia,\r\nmixed with it albuminous matter, and found that the mixture fermented.\r\nHis solution, limpid at first, became turbid, and the turbidity he\r\nfound to be due to the multiplication of a microscopic organism, which\r\nfound in the liquid its proper aliment. Pasteur recognised in this\r\nlittle organism a _living ferment_. This bold conclusion was doubtless\r\nstrengthened, if not prompted, by the previous discovery of the\r\nyeast-plant--the alcoholic ferment--by Cagniard-Latour and Schwann.\r\n\r\nPasteur next permitted his little organism to take the carbon\r\nnecessary for its growth from the pure paratartrate of ammonia. Owing\r\nto the opposition of its two classes of crystals, a solution of this\r\nsalt, it will be remembered, does not turn the plane of polarised\r\nlight either to the right or to the left. Soon after fermentation\r\nhad set in, a rotation to the left was noticed, proving that the\r\nequilibrium previously existing between the two classes of crystals\r\nhad ceased. The rotation reached a maximum, after which it was found\r\nthat all the right-handed tartrate had disappeared from the liquid.\r\nThe organism thus proved itself competent to select its own food. It\r\nfound, as it were, one of the tartrates more digestible than the other,\r\nand appropriated it, to the neglect of the other. No difference of\r\nchemical constitution determined its choice; for the elements, and the\r\nproportions of the elements, in the two tartrates were identical. But\r\nthe peculiarity of structure which enabled the substance to rotate the\r\nplane of polarisation to the right, also rendered it a fit aliment for\r\nthe organism. This most remarkable experiment was successfully made\r\nwith the seeds of our common mould, _Penicillium glaucam_.\r\n\r\nHere we find Pasteur unexpectedly landed amid the phenomena of\r\nfermentation. With true scientific instinct he closed with the\r\nconception that ferments are, in all cases, living things, and that\r\nthe substances formerly regarded as ferments are, in reality, the food\r\nof the ferments. Touched by this wand, difficulties fell rapidly\r\nbefore him. He proved the ferment of lactic acid to be an organism of a\r\ncertain kind. The ferment of butyric acid he proved to be an organism\r\nof a different kind. He was soon led to the fundamental conclusion\r\nthat the capacity of an organism to act as a ferment depended on its\r\npower to live, without air. The fermentation of beer was sufficient to\r\nsuggest this idea. The yeast-plant, like many others, can live either\r\nwith or without free air. It flourishes best in contact with free\r\nair, for it is then spared the labour of wresting from the malt the\r\noxygen required for its sustenance. Supplied with free air, however,\r\nit practically ceases to be a ferment; while in the brewing vat, where\r\nthe work of fermentation is active, the budding _torula_ is completely\r\ncut off by the sides of the vessel, and by a deep layer of carbonic\r\nacid gas, from all contact with air. The butyric ferment not only lives\r\nwithout air, but Pasteur showed that air is fatal to it. He finally\r\ndivided microscopic organisms into two great classes, which he named\r\nrespectively _ærobies_ and _anærobies_, the former requiring free\r\noxygen to maintain life, the latter capable of living without free\r\noxygen, but able to wrest this element from its combinations with other\r\nelements. This destruction of pre-existing compounds and formation of\r\nnew ones, caused by the increase and multiplication of the organism,\r\nconstitute the process of fermentation.\r\n\r\nUnder this head are also rightly ranked the phenomena of putrefaction.\r\nAs M. Radot well expresses it, the fermentation of sugar may be\r\ndescribed as the putrefaction of sugar. In this particular field\r\nM. Pasteur, whose contributions to the subject are of the highest\r\nvalue, was preceded by Schwann, a man of great merit, of whom the\r\nworld has heard too little.[4] Schwann placed decoctions of meat in\r\nflasks, sterilised the decoctions by boiling, and then supplied them\r\nwith calcined air, the power of which to support life he showed to\r\nbe unimpaired. Under these circumstances putrefaction never set in.\r\nHence the conclusion of Schwann, that putrefaction was not due to the\r\ncontact of air, as affirmed by Gay-Lussac, but to something suspended\r\nin the air which heat was able to destroy. This something consists of\r\nliving organisms which nourish themselves at the expense of the organic\r\nsubstance, and cause its putrefaction.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe grasp of Pasteur on this class of subjects was embracing. He\r\nstudied acetic fermentation, and found it to be the work of a minute\r\nfungus, the _mycoderma aceti_, which, requiring free oxygen for its\r\nnutrition, overspreads the surface of the fermenting liquid. By the\r\nalcoholic ferment the sugar of the grape-juice is transformed into\r\ncarbonic acid gas and alcohol, the former exhaling, the latter\r\nremaining in the wine. By the _mycoderma aceti_ the wine is, in its\r\nturn, converted into vinegar. Of the experiments made in connection\r\nwith this subject one deserves especial mention. It is that in\r\nwhich Pasteur suppressed all albuminous matters, and carried on\r\nthe fermentation with purely crystallisable substances. He studied\r\nthe deterioration of vinegar, revealed its cause, and the means of\r\npreventing it. He defined the part played by the little eel-like\r\norganisms which sometimes swarm in vinegar casks, and ended by\r\nintroducing important ameliorations and improvements in the manufacture\r\nof vinegar. The discussion with Liebig and other minor discussions of a\r\nsimilar nature, which M. Radot has somewhat strongly emphasized, I will\r\nnot here dwell upon.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for an inquirer like Pasteur to evade the\r\nquestion--Whence come these minute organisms which are demonstrably\r\ncapable of producing effects on which vast industries are built and on\r\nwhich whole populations depend for occupation and sustenance? He thus\r\nfound himself face to face with the question of spontaneous generation,\r\nto which the researches of Pouchet had just given fresh interest.\r\nTrained as Pasteur was in the experimental sciences, he had an immense\r\nadvantage over Pouchet, whose culture was derived from the sciences of\r\nobservation. One by one the statements and experiments of Pouchet were\r\nexplained or overthrown, and the doctrine of spontaneous generation\r\nremained discredited until it was revived with ardour, ability, and,\r\nfor a time, with success, by Dr. Bastian.\r\n\r\nA remark of M. Radot's on page 103 needs some qualification. 'The\r\ngreat interest of Pasteur's method consists,' he says, 'in its proving\r\nunanswerably that the origin of life in infusions which have been\r\nheated to the boiling point is solely due to the solid particles\r\nsuspended in the air.' This means that living germs cannot exist _in\r\nthe liquid_ when once raised to a temperature of 212° Fahr. No doubt a\r\ngreat number of organisms collapse at this temperature; some indeed,\r\nas M. Pasteur has shown, are destroyed at a temperature 90° below\r\nthe boiling point. But this is by no means universally the case. The\r\nspores of the hay-bacillus, for example, have, in numerous instances,\r\nsuccessfully resisted the boiling temperature for one, two, three, four\r\nhours; while in one instance _eight hours'_ continuous boiling failed\r\nto sterilise an infusion of desiccated hay. The knowledge of this fact\r\ncaused me a little anxiety some years ago when a meeting was projected\r\nbetween M. Pasteur and Dr. Bastian. For though, in regard to the main\r\nquestion, I knew that the upholder of spontaneous generation could not\r\nwin, on the particular issue touching the death temperature he might\r\nhave come off victor.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture and maladies of wine next occupied Pasteur's attention.\r\nHe had, in fact, got the key to this whole series of problems, and he\r\nknew how to use it. Each of the disorders of wine was traced to its\r\nspecific organism, which, acting as a ferment, produced substances\r\nthe reverse of agreeable to the palate. By the simplest of devices,\r\nPasteur, at a stroke, abolished the causes of wine disease. Fortunately\r\nthe foreign organisms which, if unchecked, destroy the best red\r\nwines are extremely sensitive to heat. A temperature of 50° Cent.\r\n(122° Fahr.) suffices to kill them. Bottled wines once raised to\r\nthis temperature, for a single minute, are secured from subsequent\r\ndeterioration. The wines suffer in no degree from exposure to this\r\ntemperature. The manner in which Pasteur proved this, by invoking\r\nthe judgment of the wine-tasters of Paris, is as amusing as it is\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMoved by the entreaty of his master, the illustrious Dumas, Pasteur\r\ntook up the investigation of the diseases of silkworms at a time\r\nwhen the silk-husbandry of France was in a state of ruin. In doing\r\nso he did not, as might appear, entirely forsake his former line\r\nof research. Previous investigators had got so far as to discover\r\nvibratory corpuscles in the blood of the diseased worms, and with such\r\ncorpuscles Pasteur had already made himself intimately acquainted. He\r\nwas therefore to some extent at home in this new investigation. The\r\ncalamity was appalling, all the efforts made to stay the plague having\r\nproved futile. In June 1865 Pasteur betook himself to the scene of the\r\nepidemic, and at once commenced his observations. On the evening of\r\nhis arrival he had already discovered the corpuscles, and shown them\r\nto others. Acquainted as he was with the work of living ferments, his\r\nmind was prepared to see in the corpuscles the cause of the epidemic.\r\nHe followed them through all the phases of the insect's life--through\r\nthe eggs, through the worm, through the chrysalis, through the moth.\r\nHe proved that the germ of the malady might be present in the eggs\r\nand escape detection. In the worm also it might elude microscopic\r\nexamination. But in the moth it reached a development so distinct as to\r\nrender its recognition immediate. From healthy moths healthy eggs were\r\nsure to spring; from healthy eggs healthy worms; from healthy worms\r\nfine cocoons: so that the problem of the restoration to France of its\r\nsilk-husbandry reduced itself to the separation of the healthy from\r\nthe unhealthy moths, the rejection of the latter, and the exclusive\r\nemployment of the eggs of the former. M. Radot describes how this is\r\nnow done on the largest scale, with the most satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of this investigation on the parasitic theory of\r\ncommunicable diseases was thus illustrated: Worms were infected\r\nby permitting them to feed for a single meal on leaves over which\r\ncorpusculous matter had been spread; they were infected by inoculation,\r\nand it was shown how they infected each other by the wounds and\r\nscratches of their own claws. By the association of healthy with\r\ndiseased worms, the infection was communicated to the former. Infection\r\nat a distance was also produced by the wafting of the corpuscles\r\nthrough the air. The various modes in which communicable diseases\r\nare diffused among human populations were illustrated by Pasteur's\r\ntreatment of the silkworms. 'It was no hypothetical, infected\r\nmedium--no problematical pythogenic gas--that killed the worms. It\r\nwas a definite organism.'[5] The disease thus far described is that\r\ncalled _pébrine_, which was the principal scourge at the time. Another\r\nformidable malady was also prevalent, called _flacherie_, the cause\r\nof which, and the mode of dealing with it, were also pointed out by\r\nPasteur.\r\n\r\nOverstrained by years of labour in this field, Pasteur was smitten with\r\nparalysis in October 1868. But this calamity did not prevent him from\r\nmaking a journey to Alais in January 1869, for the express purpose\r\nof combating the criticisms to which his labours had been subjected.\r\nPasteur is combustible, and contradiction readily stirs him into\r\nflame. No scientific man now living has fought so many battles as he.\r\nTo enable him to render his experiments decisive, the French Emperor\r\nplaced a villa at his disposal near Trieste, where silkworm culture had\r\nbeen carried on for some time at a loss. The success here is described\r\nas marvellous; the sale of cocoons giving to the villa a net profit of\r\ntwenty-six millions of francs.[6] From the Imperial villa M. Pasteur\r\naddressed to me a letter, a portion of which I have already published.\r\nIt may perhaps prove usefully suggestive to our Indian or Colonial\r\nauthorities if I reproduce it here:--\r\n\r\n'Permettez-moi de terminer ces quelques lignes que je dois dicter,\r\nvaincu que je suis par la maladie, en vous faisant observer que vous\r\nrendriez service aux Colonies de la Grande-Bretagne en répandant la\r\nconnaissance de ce livre, et des principes que j'établis touchant la\r\nmaladie des vers à soie. Beaucoup de ces colonies pourraient cultiver\r\nle mûrier avec succès, et, en jetant les yeux sur mon ouvrage, vous\r\nvous convaincrez aisément qu'il est facile aujourd'hui, non-seulement\r\nd'éloigner la maladie régnante, mais en outre de donner aux récoltes de\r\nla soie une prospérité qu'elles n'ont jamais eue.'\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe studies on wine prepare us for the 'Studies on Beer,' which\r\nfollowed the investigation of silkworm diseases. The sourness,\r\nputridity, and other maladies of beer Pasteur traced to special\r\n'ferments of disease,' of a totally different form, and therefore\r\neasily distinguished from the true _torula_ or yeast-plant. Many\r\nmysteries of our breweries were cleared up by this inquiry. Without\r\nknowing the cause, the brewer not unfrequently incurred heavy losses\r\nthrough the use of bad yeast. Five minutes' examination with the\r\nmicroscope would have revealed to him the cause of the badness, and\r\nprevented him from using the yeast. He would have seen the true\r\n_torula_ overpowered by foreign intruders. The microscope is, I\r\nbelieve, now everywhere in use. At Burton-on-Trent its aid was very\r\nsoon invoked. At the conclusion of his studies on beer M. Pasteur came\r\nto London, where I had the pleasure of conversing with him. Crippled by\r\nparalysis, bowed down by the sufferings of France, and anxious about\r\nhis family at a troubled and an uncertain time, he appeared low in\r\nhealth and depressed in spirits. His robust appearance when he visited\r\nLondon, on the occasion of the Edinburgh Anniversary, was in marked and\r\npleasing contrast with my memory of his aspect at the time to which I\r\nhave referred.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile these researches were going on, the Germ Theory of infectious\r\ndisease was noised abroad. The researches of Pasteur were frequently\r\nreferred to as bearing upon the subject, though Pasteur himself\r\nkept clear for a long time of this special field of inquiry. He was\r\nnot a physician, and he did not feel called upon to trench upon the\r\nphysician's domain. And now I would beg of him to correct me if, at\r\nthis point of the Introduction, I should be betrayed into any statement\r\nthat is not strictly correct.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the eminent microscopist, Professor Cohn of Breslau, was in\r\nLondon, and he then handed me a number of his 'Beiträge,' containing a\r\nmemoir by Dr. Koch on Splenic Fever (_Milzbrand_, _Charbon_, Malignant\r\nPustule), which seemed to me to mark an epoch in the history of this\r\nformidable disease. With admirable patience, skill, and penetration,\r\nKoch followed up the life history of _bacillus anthracis_, the\r\ncontagium of this fever. At the time here referred to he was a young\r\nphysician holding a small appointment in the neighbourhood of Breslau,\r\nand it was easy to predict, as I predicted at the time, that he would\r\nsoon find himself in a higher position. When I next heard of him he\r\nwas head of the Imperial Sanitary Institute of Berlin. Koch's recent\r\nhistory is pretty well known in England, while his appreciation by the\r\nGerman Government is shown by the rewards and honours lately conferred\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nKoch was not the discoverer of the parasite of splenic fever. Davaine\r\nand Rayer, in 1850, had observed the little microscopic rods in the\r\nblood of animals which had died of splenic fever. But they were\r\nquite unconscious of the significance of their observation, and for\r\nthirteen years, as M. Radot informs us, strangely let the matter drop.\r\nIn 1863 Davaine's attention was again directed to the subject by the\r\nresearches of Pasteur, and he then pronounced the parasite to be the\r\ncause of the fever. He was opposed by some of his fellow-countrymen;\r\nlong discussions followed, and a second period of thirteen years,\r\nending with the publication of Koch's paper, elapsed, before M. Pasteur\r\ntook up the question. I always, indeed, assumed that from the paper\r\nof the learned German came the impulse towards a line of inquiry in\r\nwhich M. Pasteur has achieved such splendid results. Things presenting\r\nthemselves thus to my mind, M. Radot will, I trust, forgive me if I\r\nsay that it was with very great regret that I perused the disparaging\r\nreferences to Dr. Koch which occur in the chapter on splenic fever.\r\n\r\nAfter Koch's investigation, no doubt could be entertained of the\r\nparasitic origin of this disease. It completely cleared up the\r\nperplexity previously existing as to the two forms--the one fugitive,\r\nthe other permanent--in which the contagium presented itself. I may\r\nsay that it was on the conversion of the permanent hardy form into\r\nthe fugitive and sensitive one, in the case of _bacillus subtilis_\r\nand other organisms, that the method of sterilising by 'discontinuous\r\nheating' introduced by me in February 1877 was founded. The difference\r\nbetween an organism and its spores, in point of durability, had not\r\nescaped the penetration of Pasteur. This difference Koch showed to be\r\nof paramount importance in splenic fever. He, moreover, proved that\r\nwhile mice and guinea-pigs were infallibly killed by the parasite,\r\nbirds were able to defy it.\r\n\r\nAnd here we come upon what may be called a hand-specimen of the genius\r\nof Pasteur, which strikingly illustrates its quality. Why should birds\r\nenjoy the immunity established by the experiments of Koch? Here is the\r\nanswer. The temperature which prohibits the multiplication of _bacillus\r\nanthracis_ in infusions is 44° Cent. (111° Fahr.). The temperature of\r\nthe blood of birds is from 41° to 42°. It is therefore close to the\r\nprohibitory temperature. But then the blood globules of a living fowl\r\nare sure to offer a certain resistance to any attempt to deprive them\r\nof their oxygen--a resistance not experienced in an infusion. May not\r\nthis resistance, added to the high temperature of the fowl, suffice\r\nto place it beyond the power of the parasite? Experiment alone could\r\nanswer this question, and Pasteur made the experiment. By placing its\r\nfeet in cold water he lowered the temperature of a fowl to 37° or 38°.\r\nHe inoculated the fowl, thus chilled, with the splenic fever parasite,\r\nand in twenty-four hours it was dead. The argument was clinched by\r\ninoculating a chilled fowl, permitting the fever to come to a head,\r\nand then removing the fowl, wrapped in cotton-wool, to a chamber with a\r\ntemperature of 35°. The strength of the patient returned as the career\r\nof the parasite was brought to an end, and in a few hours health was\r\nrestored. The sharpness of the reasoning here is only equalled by the\r\nconclusiveness of the experiment, which is full of suggestiveness as\r\nregards the treatment of fevers in man.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPasteur had little difficulty in establishing the parasitic origin of\r\nfowl cholera; indeed, the parasite had been observed by others before\r\nhim. But by his successive cultivations, he rendered the solution\r\nsure. His next step will remain for ever memorable in the history of\r\nmedicine. I allude to what he calls 'virus attenuation.' And here it\r\nmay be well to throw out a few remarks in advance. When a tree, or a\r\nbundle of wheat or barley straw, is burnt, a certain amount of mineral\r\nmatter remains in the ashes--extremely small in comparison with the\r\nbulk of the tree or of the straw, but absolutely essential to its\r\ngrowth. In a soil lacking, or exhausted of, the necessary mineral\r\nconstituents, the tree cannot live, the crop cannot grow. Now contagia\r\nare living things, which demand certain elements of life just as\r\ninexorably as trees, or wheat, or barley; and it is not difficult to\r\nsee that a crop of a given parasite may so far use up a constituent\r\nexisting in small quantities in the body, but essential to the growth\r\nof the parasite, as to render the body unfit for the production of a\r\nsecond crop. The soil is exhausted, and, until the lost constituent is\r\nrestored, the body is protected from any further attack of the same\r\ndisorder. Such an explanation of non-recurrent diseases naturally\r\npresents itself to a thorough believer in the germ theory, and such\r\nwas the solution which, in reply to a question, I ventured to offer\r\nnearly fifteen years ago to an eminent London physician. To exhaust\r\na soil, however, a parasite less vigorous and destructive than the\r\nreally virulent one may suffice; and if, after having by means of a\r\nfeebler organism exhausted the soil, without fatal result, the most\r\nhighly virulent parasite be introduced into the system, it will prove\r\npowerless. This, in the language of the germ theory, is the whole\r\nsecret of vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe general problem, of which Jenner's discovery was a particular case,\r\nhas been grasped by Pasteur, in a manner, and with results, which five\r\nshort years ago were simply unimaginable. How much 'accident' had to do\r\nwith shaping the course of his enquiries I know not. A mind like his\r\nresembles a photographic plate, which is ready to accept and develop\r\nluminous impressions, sought and unsought. In the chapter on fowl\r\ncholera is described how Pasteur first obtained his attenuated virus.\r\nBy successive cultivations of the parasite he showed, that after it\r\nhad been a hundred times reproduced, it continued to be as virulent\r\nas at first. One necessary condition was, however, to be observed. It\r\nwas essential that the cultures should rapidly succeed each other--that\r\nthe organism, before its transference to a fresh cultivating liquid,\r\nshould not be left long in contact with air. When exposed to air for a\r\nconsiderable time the virus becomes so enfeebled that when fowls are\r\ninoculated with it, though they sicken for a time, they do not die.\r\nBut this 'attenuated' virus, which M. Radot justly calls 'benign,'\r\nconstitutes a sure protection against the virulent virus. It so\r\nexhausts the soil that the really fatal contagium fails to find there\r\nthe elements necessary to its reproduction and multiplication.\r\n\r\nPasteur affirms that it is the oxygen of the air which, by lengthened\r\ncontact, weakens the virus and converts it into a true vaccine. He has\r\nalso weakened it by transmission through various animals. It was this\r\nform of attenuation that was brought into play in the case of Jenner.\r\n\r\nThe secret of attenuation had thus become an open one to Pasteur. He\r\nlaid hold of the murderous virus of splenic fever, and succeeded in\r\nrendering it, not only harmless to life, but a sure protection against\r\nthe virus in its most concentrated form. No man, in my opinion, can\r\nwork at these subjects so rapidly as Pasteur without falling into\r\nerrors of detail. But this may occur while his main position remains\r\nimpregnable. Such a result, for example, as that obtained in presence\r\nof so many witnesses at Melun must surely remain an ever-memorable\r\nconquest of science. Having prepared his attenuated virus, and proved,\r\nby laboratory experiments, its efficacy as a protective vaccine,\r\nPasteur accepted an invitation from the President of the Society of\r\nAgriculture at Melun, to make a public experiment on what might be\r\ncalled an agricultural scale. This act of Pasteur's is, perhaps, the\r\nboldest thing recorded in this book. It naturally caused anxiety among\r\nhis colleagues of the Academy, who feared that he had been rash in\r\nclosing with the proposal of the President.\r\n\r\nBut the experiment was made. A flock of sheep was divided into\r\ntwo groups, the members of one group being all vaccinated with\r\nthe attenuated virus, while those of the other group were left\r\nunvaccinated. A number of cows were also subjected to a precisely\r\nsimilar treatment. Fourteen days afterwards, all the sheep and all\r\nthe cows, vaccinated and unvaccinated, were inoculated with a very\r\nvirulent virus; and three days subsequently more than two hundred\r\npersons assembled to witness the result. The 'shout of admiration,'\r\nmentioned by M. Radot, was a natural outburst under the circumstances.\r\nOf twenty-five sheep which had not been protected by vaccination,\r\ntwenty-one were already dead, and the remaining ones were dying. The\r\ntwenty-five vaccinated sheep, on the contrary, were 'in full health and\r\ngaiety.' In the unvaccinated cows intense fever was produced, while\r\nthe prostration was so great that they were unable to eat. Tumours\r\nwere also formed at the points of inoculation. In the vaccinated cows\r\nno tumours were formed; they exhibited no fever, nor even an elevation\r\nof temperature, while their power of feeding was unimpaired. No\r\nwonder that 'breeders of cattle overwhelmed Pasteur with applications\r\nfor vaccine.' At the end of 1881 close upon 34,000 animals had been\r\nvaccinated, while the number rose in 1883 to nearly 500,000.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Pasteur is now exactly sixty-two years of age; but his energy is\r\nunabated. At the end of this volume we are informed that he has already\r\ntaken up and examined with success, as far as his experiments have\r\nreached, the terrible and mysterious disease of rabies or hydrophobia.\r\nThose who hold all communicable diseases to be of parasitic origin,\r\ninclude, of course, rabies among the number of those produced and\r\npropagated by a living contagium. From his first contact with the\r\ndisease Pasteur showed his accustomed penetration. If we see a man mad,\r\nwe at once refer his madness to the state of his brain. It is somewhat\r\nsingular that in the face of this fact the virus of a mad dog should be\r\nreferred to the animal's saliva. The saliva is, no doubt, infected,\r\nbut Pasteur soon proved the real seat and empire of the disorder to be\r\nthe nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe parasite of rabies had not been securely isolated when M. Radot\r\nfinished his task. But last May, at the instance of M. Pasteur, a\r\ncommission was appointed by the Minister of Public Instruction in\r\nFrance, to examine and report upon the results which he had up to\r\nthat time obtained. A preliminary report, issued to appease public\r\nimpatience, reached me before I quitted Switzerland this year. It\r\ninspires the sure and certain hope that, as regards the attenuation of\r\nthe rabic virus, and the rendering of an animal, by inoculation, proof\r\nagainst attack, the success of M. Pasteur is assured. The commission,\r\nthough hitherto extremely active, is far from the end of its labours;\r\nbut the results obtained so far may be thus summed up:--\r\n\r\nOf six dogs unprotected by vaccination, three succumbed to the bites of\r\na dog in a furious state of madness.\r\n\r\nOf eight unvaccinated dogs, six succumbed to the intravenous\r\ninoculation of rabic matter.\r\n\r\nOf five unvaccinated dogs, all succumbed to inoculation, by trepanning,\r\nof the brain.\r\n\r\nFinally, of three-and-twenty vaccinated dogs, not one was attacked with\r\nthe disease subsequent to inoculation with the most potent virus.\r\n\r\nSurely results such as those recorded in this book are calculated,\r\nnot only to arouse public interest, but public hope and wonder. Never\r\nbefore, during the long period of its history, did a day like the\r\npresent dawn upon the science and art of medicine. Indeed, previous\r\nto the discoveries of recent times, medicine was not a science, but\r\na collection of empirical rules dependent for their interpretation\r\nand application upon the sagacity of the physician. How does England\r\nstand in relation to the great work now going on around her? She is,\r\nand must be, behindhand. Scientific chauvinism is not beautiful in my\r\neyes. Still one can hardly see, without deprecation and protest, the\r\nEnglish investigator handicapped in so great a race by short-sighted\r\nand mischievous legislation.\r\n\r\nA great scientific theory has never been accepted without opposition.\r\nThe theory of gravitation, the theory of undulation, the theory of\r\nevolution, the dynamical theory of heat--all had to push their way\r\nthrough conflict to victory. And so it has been with the Germ Theory of\r\ncommunicable diseases. Some outlying members of the medical profession\r\ndispute it still. I am told they even dispute the communicability of\r\ncholera. Such must always be the course of things, as long as men are\r\nendowed with different degrees of insight. Where the mind of genius\r\ndiscerns the distant truth, which it pursues, the mind not so gifted\r\noften discerns nothing but the extravagance, which it avoids. Names,\r\nnot yet forgotten, could be given to illustrate these two classes of\r\nminds. As representative of the first class, I would name a man whom\r\nI have often named before, who, basing himself in great part on the\r\nresearches of Pasteur, fought, in England, the battle of the germ\r\ntheory with persistent valour, but whose labours broke him down before\r\nhe saw the triumph which he _fore_saw completed. Many of my medical\r\nfriends will understand that I allude here to the late Dr. William\r\nBudd, of Bristol.\r\n\r\nThe task expected of me is now accomplished, and the reader is here\r\npresented with a record, in which the verities of science are endowed\r\nwith the interest of romance.\r\n\r\n                                                  JOHN TYNDALL.\r\n\r\n  ROYAL INSTITUTION: _December 1884_\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Art.

Marbach has discovered that chlorate of soda\r\nproduces circular polarisation in all directions through the crystal,\r\nwhile in quartz it occurs only in the direction of the axis. Marbach\r\nalso discovered facets upon his crystals, resembling those of quartz.\r\n\r\n[4] It was late in the day when the Royal Society made him a foreign\r\nmember.\r\n\r\n[5] These words were uttered at a time when the pythogenic theory was\r\nmore in favour than it is now.\r\n\r\n[6] The work on _Diseases of Silkworms_ was dedicated to the Empress of\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                _RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH._\r\n\r\n                          FIRST DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Come, M. Pasteur! you must shake off the demon of idleness!' It was\r\nthe night watcher of the College of Besançon, who invariably at four\r\no'clock in the morning entered Pasteur's room and roused him with this\r\nvigorous salute, which was accompanied, when necessary, by a sound\r\nshaking. Pasteur was then eighteen years of age. In addition to his\r\nfood and lodging, the royal college paid him twenty-four francs a\r\nmonth. But if his place was a modest one, it sufficed at the time for\r\nhis ambition: it was the first tie which bound him to the University.\r\n\r\n'Ah,' said his father to him frequently, 'if only you could become some\r\nday professor in the College of Arbois I should be the happiest man on\r\nearth.'\r\n\r\nAlready, when he resided at Dôle, and when his son was not yet two\r\nyears old, this father permitted himself to dream thus of the future.\r\nWhat would he have said had it been announced to him that fifty-eight\r\nyears later, on the façade of the little house in the Rue des Tanneurs,\r\nwould be placed, in the presence of his living son--laden with honours,\r\nladen with glory, passing in the midst of a triumphal procession along\r\nthe paved town--a plate bearing these words in letters of gold:\r\n\r\n                     HERE WAS BORN LOUIS PASTEUR,\r\n                         _December 27, 1822._\r\n\r\nPausing before this house, Pasteur recalled the image of his father and\r\nmother--of those whom he called his dear departed ones--and from the\r\nfar-off depths of his childhood came so many memories of affection,\r\ndevotion, and paternal sacrifices that he burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThe life of his father had been a rough one. An old soldier, decorated\r\non the field of battle, on returning to France, where he had no longer\r\na home, he was obliged to work hard to earn his bread. He took up the\r\ntrade of a tanner. Soon afterwards, having made the acquaintance of\r\na worthy young girl, he joined his lot with hers, and together they\r\nentered courageously on the labours of their married life--he calm,\r\nreflective, and more eager, whenever he had a moment of repose, for the\r\nsociety of books than for the society of his neighbours; she full of\r\nenthusiasm, her heart and spirit agitated by thoughts above the level\r\nof her modest life. Both of them watched with ceaseless solitude over\r\ntheir little Louis, of whom, with mingled pride and tenderness, they\r\nused to say, 'We will make of him an educated man.'\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the Pasteur family quitted Dôle and established themselves\r\nat Arbois, where, on the borders of the Cuisance, the father of our\r\nhero had bought a small tanyard. At this town, and in this yard,\r\nLouis Pasteur spent his childhood. As soon as he was old enough to be\r\nreceived as a half-pay scholar he was sent to the communal college. He,\r\nthe smallest of all the pupils, was so proud of passing under the great\r\narched doorway of this ancient establishment, that he arrived laden\r\nwith enormous dictionaries, of which there was no need.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his laborious occupations the father of Pasteur took\r\nupon himself the task of superintending his son's lessons every\r\nevening. This was at first no sinecure. Louis Pasteur did not always\r\ntake the shortest road either to reach his class or to return to his\r\nwork at home. Some old friends still living remember having made with\r\nthe little Pasteur fishing parties, which proved so pleasant that they\r\nhave been continued to the present day. The boy, moreover, instead of\r\napplying himself to his lessons, often escaped and amused himself by\r\nmaking large portraits of his neighbours, male and female. A dozen of\r\nthese portraits are still to be seen in the houses of Arbois, all\r\nbearing his signature. Considering that his age at the time was only\r\nthirteen, the accuracy of the drawing is astonishing.\r\n\r\n'What a pity,' said an old lady of Arbois a short time since, 'that he\r\nshould have buried himself in chemistry! He has missed his vocation,\r\nfor he might by this time have made his reputation as a painter.'\r\n\r\nIt was not until he reached the third class that Louis Pasteur,\r\nbeginning to realise the sacrifices which his father imposed upon\r\nhimself, determined to abandon his fishing implements and his crayons,\r\nfeeling aroused within him that passion for work which was to form the\r\nfoundation of his life. The Principal of the college, who followed with\r\nwatchful interest the progress of a pupil who, in his first effort, had\r\noutstripped all his comrades, used to say, 'He will go far. It is not\r\nfor the chair of a small college like ours that we must prepare him; he\r\nmust become professor in a royal college. My little friend,' he would\r\nadd, 'think of the great École Normale.'\r\n\r\nThe College of Arbois having no professor of philosophy, Pasteur\r\nquitted it for Besançon. There he remained for the scholars' year,\r\nreceived the degree of _bachelier ès lettres_, and was immediately\r\nappointed tutor in the same college. In the intervals of his duties\r\nhe followed the course of mathematics necessary to prepare him for\r\nthe scientific examinations of the École Normale. He must have been\r\nalready endowed with a singular maturity of character, for the\r\ndirector confided to him the superintendence of the quarters of the\r\nolder pupils, who during class time were his comrades. In the class\r\nroom his table was in the midst of them; and never had so young a\r\nmaster so much authority, and at the same time so little need for its\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nHis first taste for chemistry manifested itself by frequent questions\r\naddressed during class time to an old professor named Darlay. This\r\nquestioning was so often repeated that the good man, quite bewildered,\r\nended by declaring that it was for him to interrogate Pasteur and not\r\nfor Pasteur to interrogate him. His pupil pressed him no further, but\r\nhaving heard that at Besançon there lived an apothecary who had once\r\ndistinguished himself by a paper inserted in the 'Annales de Chimie et\r\nde Physique,' he sought this man, with a view of ascertaining whether,\r\non holidays, he would consent to give him lessons secretly.\r\n\r\nAt the examination for the École Normale, Pasteur passed as fourteenth\r\nin the list. This rank, however, did not satisfy him. Notwithstanding\r\nthe censure of his fellow candidates he declared that he would begin\r\na new year of preparation. It was in Paris itself that he chose to\r\nwork--in one of the silent corners of the city, amid the seclusion of\r\npreparatory schools and convents.\r\n\r\nIn the Impasse des Feuillantines, there lived a schoolmaster, M.\r\nBarbet by name, or rather _le père Barbet_, as the Franc-Comtois,\r\nwith provincial familiarity, used to call him. Pasteur begged to be\r\nallowed to enter his institution, not as an assistant, but as a simple\r\npupil. Knowing how slender were the means of his young compatriot, M.\r\nBarbet reduced the fees of his pupil by one-third. Such kindness was\r\ncustomary with the _père Barbet_, who did not like to be reminded of\r\nhis generosity. This, however, gives double pleasure to him who records\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe year passes, the time of the examination arrives, and Pasteur is\r\nreceived as fourth on the list. Thus at last, in the month of October\r\n1843, he finds himself in that École Normale in which he was destined\r\nto take so great a place. Pasteur's taste for chemistry had become a\r\npassion which he could now satisfy to his heart's content. Chemistry\r\nwas at this time taught at the Sorbonne by M. Dumas and at the École\r\nNormale by M. Balard. The pupils of the École attended both courses of\r\nlectures. Different as were the two professors, both of them exercised\r\ngreat influence on their pupils. M. Dumas, with his serene gravity\r\nand his profound respect for his auditory, never allowed the smallest\r\nincorrectness to slip into his exposition. M. Balard, with a vivacity\r\nquite juvenile, with the excitement of a southerner in the tribune, did\r\nnot always give his words time to follow his thoughts. It was he who\r\nonce, showing a little potash to his audience, exclaimed with a fervour\r\nwhich has become celebrated, 'Potash, which--potash, then--potash, in\r\nshort, which I now present to you.'\r\n\r\nThe general principles which M. Dumas in his teaching delighted to\r\ndevelop, the multitude of facts which M. Balard unfolded to his pupils,\r\nall answered to the needs of Pasteur's mind. If he loved the vaster\r\nhorizons of science, he was also possessed by the anxious desire\r\nfor exactitude, and for the perpetual control of experiment. Each\r\nof the lectures of the École Normale and of the Sorbonne excited in\r\nhim a profound enthusiasm. One day M. Dumas, while illustrating the\r\nsolidification of carbonic acid, begged for the loan of a handkerchief\r\nto receive the carbonic acid snow. Pasteur rushed forward, and,\r\npresenting his handkerchief, received the snow. He returned triumphant,\r\nand running forthwith to the École Normale, repeated the principal\r\nexperiments which the illustrious chemist had just exhibited to his\r\naudience. He preserved religiously the handkerchief which had been\r\ntouched by M. Dumas.\r\n\r\nPasteur usually spent his Sundays with M. Barruel, the assistant of M.\r\nDumas. He thought of nothing but experiments. For a long time in one of\r\nthe laboratories of the École Normale was exhibited a basin--perhaps\r\nit is still shown--containing sixty grammes of phosphorus obtained\r\nfrom bones bought at the butcher's by Pasteur. These he had calcined,\r\nsubmitted to the processes known to chemists, and finally reduced,\r\nafter a whole day's heating, from four in the morning to nine in the\r\nevening, to the said sixty grammes. It was the first time that the long\r\nmanipulations required in the preparation of this simple substance were\r\nattempted at the École Normale.\r\n\r\nIsolated in laboratory or library, Pasteur's only thought was to\r\nsearch, to learn, to question, and to verify. As the rule of the school\r\nleaves much to individual initiative, he devoted himself to his work\r\nwith a joyful heart. This daily liberty constitutes the charm and the\r\nhonour of the École Normale. Not only does it permit but it encourages\r\nindividual effort; it allows the student to visit at his will the\r\nlibrary, and to consult there the scientific journals and reviews. This\r\nfree system of education develops singularly the spirit of research.\r\nThere is in it an element of superiority over the École Polytechnique.\r\nInfluenced by its military origin, constrained, moreover, by the number\r\nof its pupils to impose on all an exact discipline, and to introduce\r\ninto their exercises a strict regularity, the École Polytechnique is,\r\nperhaps, less calculated than the École Normale to awaken in the minds\r\nof its pupils a taste for speculative science. It is certain that\r\nPasteur owed to the freedom of work, and to the facilities for solitary\r\nreading which he there enjoyed, the first occasion for an investigation\r\nwhich was the starting-point to a veritable discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\nUnlike the old professor of physics and chemistry at Besançon, one\r\nof the lecturers in the École Normale often took pleasure, not only\r\nin answering Pasteur's questions, but in leading him on to talk over\r\nscientific subjects. M. Delafosse, whose memory remains dear to all\r\nhis pupils, was one of those men who fail to do themselves justice, or\r\nwho, according to the expression of Cardinal de Retz, do not fulfil\r\nall their merit. Not that circumstances have been unfavourable to\r\nthem, but that an invincible modesty, and a natural nonchalance which\r\nfinds in that modesty a shield against latent self-reproach, leave\r\nthem in a sort of twilight in which they are content to dwell. Pupil,\r\nand afterwards fellow worker, of the celebrated crystallographer Haüy,\r\nM. Delafosse had devoted himself to questions of molecular physics.\r\nPasteur, who had read with enthusiasm the works of Haüy, conversed\r\nincessantly with Delafosse about the arrangements of molecules, when an\r\nunexpected note from the German chemist Mitscherlich, communicated to\r\nthe Academy of Sciences, came to trouble all his scientific beliefs.\r\nHere is the note:--\r\n\r\n'The paratartrate and the tartrate of soda and ammonia have the same\r\nchemical composition, the same crystalline form, the same angles, the\r\nsame specific weight, the same double refraction, and consequently\r\nthe same inclination of the optic axes. Dissolved in water, their\r\nrefraction is the same. But while the dissolved tartrate causes the\r\nplane of polarised light to rotate, the paratartrate exerts no such\r\naction. M. Biot has found this to be the case with the whole series of\r\nthese two kinds of salts. Here (adds Mitscherlich) the nature and the\r\nnumber of the atoms, their arrangement, and their distances apart are\r\nthe same in the two bodies.'\r\n\r\nImbued as he was with the teachings of Haüy and Delafosse, and full of\r\nthe ideas of M. Dumas in molecular chemistry, Pasteur asked himself\r\nthis question: 'How can it be admitted that the nature and number of\r\nthe atoms, their arrangement and distances apart, in two chemical\r\nsubstances are the same; that the crystalline forms are equally the\r\nsame, without concluding that the two substances are absolutely\r\nidentical? Is there not a profound incompatibility between the identity\r\naffirmed by Mitscherlich and the discrepancy of optic character\r\nmanifested by the two compounds, tartaric and paratartaric, which form\r\nthe subject of his note?'\r\n\r\nThis difficulty rested in Pasteur's mind with the tenacity of a fixed\r\nidea. Received as _agrégé_ of physical science at the end of his third\r\nyear at the École, and then keeping near his master, M. Balard, he had\r\nbegun the study of crystals and the determination of their angles and\r\nforms, when his nomination to the professorship of physics in the Lycée\r\nof Tournon surprised and distressed him. M. Balard repaired immediately\r\nto the bureau of the Minister of Education, and spoke of his assistant\r\nin terms which caused the nomination to be cancelled. Pasteur remained\r\nin the laboratory of the École Normale.\r\n\r\nWith a view to mastering the science of crystallography, he took for\r\nhis guide the extensive work of M. de la Provostaye, resolving to\r\nrepeat all the measurements of angles and all the other determinations\r\nof this author with a view to a comparison of their respective\r\nresults. The work of M. de la Provostaye, who was distinguished by the\r\nexactitude of his researches, had for its subject the tartaric and\r\nparatartaric acids and their saline compounds.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo or three years ago, while we were walking together along a road in\r\nthe Jura, M. Pasteur, after quoting textually the note of Mitscherlich,\r\ndescribed to me with enthusiasm the pleasure he had experienced in\r\ncrystallising tartaric acid and its salts, the crystals of which, he\r\nsaid, rivalled in size and beauty the most exquisite of crystalline\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n'I should have great difficulty,' I remarked, 'in following you through\r\nthe labyrinth of tartaric acid, tartrates, and paratartrates. However\r\nmuch your other studies have attracted me, those which had for their\r\nstarting-point the note of Mitscherlich and the memoir of M. de la\r\nProvostaye have appeared to me, whenever I tried to master them,\r\ndifficult of access. Ah,' I added, 'you would have done well, out of\r\nconsideration for those who love to speak of your labours, had you made\r\nno discoveries in this field.'\r\n\r\nPasteur, with a mixture of indignation and indulgence, replied:--'Is it\r\npossible that you have not discerned the grand horizons that lie behind\r\nthese researches in physics and molecular optics? If I have a regret,\r\nit is that I did not follow out this path. Less rough than it at first\r\nsight appears, it would, I am convinced, have led to the most important\r\ndiscoveries. By a sudden turn it threw me unexpectedly upon the subject\r\nof fermentation, and fermentation led me to the study of diseases; but\r\nI still continue to lament that I have never had time to retrace my\r\nsteps.'\r\n\r\nThen, with a simplicity of exposition in which one recognised the\r\nteacher who had always endeavoured to place his ideas within the range\r\nof his hearers, he said--\r\n\r\n'If you picture to yourself all the bodies in nature--mineral, animal,\r\nor vegetable, and consider even the objects formed by the hands of man,\r\nyou will see that they divide themselves into two great categories.\r\nThe one has a plane of symmetry and the other has not. Take, for\r\ninstance, a table, a chair, a playing die, or the human body; we can\r\nimagine a plane passing through these objects which divides each of\r\nthem into two absolutely similar halves. Thus, a plane passing through\r\nthe middle of the seat and of the back of an arm-chair would have, on\r\nits right and left, identical parts; in like manner a vertical plane\r\npassing through the middle of the forehead, nose, mouth, and chin of\r\nan individual, would have similar parts to the right and to the left.\r\nAll these objects, and a multitude of similar ones, constitute our\r\nfirst category. They have, as mathematicians express it, one or several\r\nplanes of symmetry.\r\n\r\n'But, as regards the repetition of similar parts, it is far from\r\nbeing the case that all bodies are constituted in the manner here\r\ndescribed. Consider, for example, your right hand: it is impossible\r\nto find for it a plane of symmetry. Whatever be the position of a\r\nplane which you imagine cutting the hand, you will never find on the\r\nright of this plane exactly the same as you find on its left. The same\r\nremark applies to your left hand, to your right ear and to your left\r\near, to your right eye and to your left eye; to your two arms, your\r\ntwo legs, and your two feet. The human body, taken as a whole, has a\r\nplane of symmetry, but none of the parts composing one or the other\r\nof its halves has such a plane. The stalk of a plant whose leaves are\r\ndistributed spirally round its stem has not a plane of symmetry, nor\r\nhas a spiral staircase such a plane; but a straight one has. You see\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n'It would have been truly extraordinary, would it not, if the various\r\nkinds of minerals, such as sea salt, alum, the diamond, rock crystal,\r\nand so many others which illustrate the great law of crystallisation,\r\nand which clothe themselves in geometric forms, should not present to\r\nus examples of the two categories of which we have just been speaking?\r\nThey do so in fact. Thus a cube, which has the form of a player's die,\r\nhas a plane of symmetry; it has indeed several planes. The form of\r\nthe diamond, which is a regular octahedron, has also several planes\r\nof symmetry. It is thus also with the great majority of the mineral\r\nforms met with in nature or in the laboratory. They have generally\r\none or several planes of symmetry. There are, however, exceptions.\r\nRock crystal, which is found in prisms, often of large volume, in the\r\nfissures of certain primitive rocks, has no plane of symmetry. This\r\ncrystal exhibits certain small facets, distributed in such a manner\r\nthat in their totality they might be compared to a helix, or spiral, or\r\nscrew, which are all objects not possessing a plane of symmetry.\r\n\r\n'Every object which has a plane of symmetry, when placed before a\r\nlooking-glass, has an image which is rigorously identical with the\r\nobject itself. The image can be superposed upon the reality. Place a\r\nchair before a mirror; the image faithfully reproduces the chair. The\r\nmirror also reproduces the human body considered as a whole. But place\r\nbefore the mirror your right hand and you will see a left hand. The\r\nright hand is not superposable on the left, just as the glove of your\r\nright hand cannot be fitted to your left, and inversely.'\r\n\r\nThen reverting to the beginnings of his studies in crystallography,\r\nPasteur recounted to me briefly that, after having gone through the\r\nwork of M. de la Provostaye, he perceived that a very interesting fact\r\nhad escaped the notice of this skilful physicist. M. de la Provostaye\r\nhad failed to observe that the crystalline forms of tartaric acid and\r\nof its compounds all belong to the group of objects which have not a\r\nplane of symmetry. Certain minute facets had escaped him. In other\r\nwords, Pasteur discerned that the crystalline form of tartaric acid,\r\nplaced before a mirror, produced an image which was not superposable\r\nupon the crystal itself. The same was found to be true of the forms\r\nof all the chemical compounds of this acid. On the other hand, he\r\nimagined that the crystalline form of paratartaric acid, and of all the\r\ncompounds of this acid, would be found to form part of the group of\r\nnatural objects which have a plane of symmetry.\r\n\r\nPasteur was transported with joy by this double result. He saw in it\r\nthe possibility of reaching by experiment the explanation of the\r\ndifficulty which the note of Mitscherlich had thrown down as a kind of\r\nchallenge to science, when it signalised an optical difference between\r\ntwo chemical compounds affirmed to be otherwise rigorously identical.\r\nPasteur reasoned thus:--Since I find tartaric acid and all its\r\ntartrates without a plane of symmetry, while its isomer, paratartaric\r\nacid, and its compounds have such a plane, I will hasten to prepare\r\nthe tartrate and the paratartrate of the note of Mitscherlich. I will\r\ncompare their forms, and in all probability the tartrate will be found\r\ndissymmetrical--that is to say, without a plane of symmetry--while\r\nthe paratartrate will continue to have such a plane. Henceforward the\r\nabsolute identity stated by Mitscherlich to exist between the forms\r\nof these two compounds will have no existence. It will be proved\r\nthat he has erred, and his note will no longer have in it anything\r\nmysterious. As the optic action proper to the tartrates spoken of in\r\nhis note manifests itself by a deviation of the plane of polarisation\r\nto the right, we have here a kind of dissymmetry which has nothing\r\nincompatible with the dissymmetry of form. On the contrary, these\r\ntwo dissymmetries can be referred to one and the same cause. In like\r\nmanner, the absence of dissymmetry in the form of the paratartrate will\r\nbe connected with the optical neutrality of that compound.\r\n\r\nThe fulfilment of Pasteur's hopes was only partial. The tartrates\r\nof soda and ammonia presented, as did all the other tartrates, the\r\ndissymmetry manifested by the absence of any plane of symmetry; that is\r\nto say, the crystals of this salt placed before a mirror produced an\r\nimage which was not superposable upon the crystal. It was like a right\r\nhand having its left for an image. With regard to the paratartrates of\r\nsoda and ammonia, one circumstance struck Pasteur in a quite unexpected\r\nmanner. Far from establishing in the crystals of this salt the absence\r\nof all dissymmetry, he found that they all manifestly possessed it.\r\nBut, strange to say, certain crystals possessed it in one sense and\r\nother crystals in a sense opposite. Some of these crystals, when\r\nplaced before a mirror, produced the image of the others, and one of\r\nthe two kinds of crystals corresponded rigorously in form with the\r\ntartrate prepared by means of the tartaric acid of the grape. Pasteur\r\ncontinued his reasoning thus:--Since there is no difference between\r\nthe form of the tartrate derived from the tartaric acid of the grape\r\nand one of the two kinds of crystals deposited at the moment of\r\ncrystallisation of the paratartrate, the simple observation of the\r\ndissymmetry proper to each will enable me to separate, by hand, all\r\nthe crystals of the paratartrate which are identical with those of\r\nthe tartrate. By ordinary chemical processes I ought to be able to\r\nextract a tartaric acid identical with that of the grape, possessing\r\nall its physical, mineralogical, and chemical properties--that is to\r\nsay, a tartaric acid possessing, like the natural tartaric acid of the\r\ngrape, dissymmetry of form, and exerting an action on polarised light.\r\n_Per contra_, I ought to be able to extract from the second sort of\r\ncrystals, associated with the former in the paratartaric group, an\r\nacid which will reproduce ordinary tartaric acid, but possessing a\r\ndissymmetry of an inverse kind and exerting an action equally inverse\r\non polarised light.\r\n\r\nWith a feverish ardour Pasteur hastened to make this double experiment.\r\nImagine his joy when he saw his anticipations not only realised but\r\nrealised with an exactitude truly mathematical. His delight was so\r\ngreat that he quitted the laboratory abruptly. Hardly had he gone\r\nout when he met the assistant of the physical professor. He embraced\r\nhim, exclaiming, 'My dear Monsieur Bertrand, I have just made a great\r\ndiscovery! I have separated the double paratartrate of soda and ammonia\r\ninto two salts of inverse dissymmetry, and exerting an inverse action\r\non the plane of polarisation of light. I am so happy that a nervous\r\ntremulousness has taken possession of me, which prevents me from\r\nlooking again through the polariscope. Let us go to the Luxembourg, and\r\nI will explain it all to you.'\r\n\r\nThese results excited in a high degree the attention of the Academy of\r\nSciences, where sat, at the time now referred to, Arago, Biot, Dumas,\r\nDe Senarmont, and Balard. It might be said without exaggeration that\r\nthe Academy was astounded. At the same time there were many members who\r\nwere slow to believe in this discovery. Charged with drawing up the\r\nreport, M. Biot began by requiring from Pasteur the verification of\r\neach point which he had announced. To this verification M. Biot brought\r\nhis habitual precision, which was associated with a kind of suspicious\r\nscepticism.\r\n\r\nIn one of his lectures Pasteur thus described his interview with M.\r\nBiot:--'He made me come to his house, where he put into my hands\r\nsome paratartaric acid which he had carefully studied himself, and\r\nfound perfectly neutral as regards polarised light. It was not in the\r\nlaboratory of the École Normale, it was in his own kitchen, and in his\r\npresence, that I was to prepare this double salt with soda and ammonia\r\nprocured by himself. The liquor was left slowly to evaporate, and at\r\nthe end of ten days, when it had deposited thirty or forty grammes of\r\ncrystals, he begged me to go over to the Collège de France to collect\r\nthe crystals and to extract from them specimens of the two kinds, which\r\nhe proposed to have placed, the one on his right hand, the other on\r\nhis left, desiring me to declare if I was ready to re-affirm, that\r\nthe crystals to the right would turn the plane of polarisation to\r\nthe right and the others to the left. This declaration made, he said\r\nthat he would charge himself with the rest of the inquiry. M. Biot\r\nthen prepared the solutions in well-measured proportions, and at the\r\nmoment of observing them in the polarising apparatus he invited me\r\nagain to come into his study. He placed first in the apparatus the\r\nmost interesting solution, that which ought to deviate to the left.\r\nWithout even making any measurements, he saw, by the mere inspection of\r\nthe colours of the ordinary and extraordinary images of the analyser,\r\nthat there was a strong deviation to the left. Visibly moved, the\r\nillustrious old man took my arm and said, \"My dear child, I have loved\r\nscience so well throughout my life that this makes my heart beat.\"'\r\n\r\nThe emotion of M. Biot was all the more profound because he had been\r\nhimself the first to discover the rotation of the plane of polarisation\r\nby chemical substances, and had, for more than thirty years, affirmed\r\nthat the study of these substances and of their action in regard to\r\nrotatory polarisation was, perhaps, the surest means of penetrating\r\ninto the intimate constitution of bodies. His counsels were received\r\nwith deference, but they had never been followed out. And now there\r\nappeared before the old man, already somewhat discouraged, a youth\r\nof twenty-five, who from his first investigation had proved himself\r\na master, who had dissipated the obscurities of the famous German\r\nnote, and created a new chapter in crystallographic chemistry. The\r\ncomposition and nature of paratartaric acid had been explained, and\r\na new substance, the left-handed tartaric acid, with its truly\r\nsurprising properties, had been discovered; molecular physics and\r\nchemistry had been enriched with new facts and theories of great value.\r\n\r\nThe first care of Pasteur, after having discovered the left-handed\r\ntartaric acid and the constitution of paratartaric acid, was to compare\r\nvery carefully the properties of the new left-handed acid with those of\r\nthe right, endeavouring to determine by strict experiment the influence\r\non these properties of the internal atomic arrangements of the two\r\nacids. Although we are unable to picture the exact figure of these\r\natomic groupings, there can be no doubt that they are formed of the\r\nsame elementary particles, that they are, moreover, dissymmetrical, and\r\nthat, in short, the dissymmetry of the one group is the same as that of\r\nthe other, but in an inverse sense. If, for example, the arrangement\r\nof the atoms of the right-handed tartaric acid present the exterior\r\nappearance of an irregular pyramid, the arrangement of the atoms of the\r\nleft-handed tartaric acid ought, of necessity, to present the form of a\r\npyramid irregular in the inverse sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nNominated assistant professor of chemistry at Strasburg, Pasteur\r\nfollowed up with enthusiasm these curious studies. To interrupt them\r\nfor an instant it required nothing less than his engagement with\r\nMademoiselle Marie Laurent, daughter of the Rector of the Academy.\r\nIt is even asserted that on the very morning of his marriage it was\r\nnecessary to go to his laboratory and remind him of the event that\r\nwas to take place on that day. But if Pasteur was thus guilty of an\r\nabsent-mindedness worthy of La Fontaine, he proved as a husband so\r\ndifferent from La Fontaine that Madame Pasteur, when reminded of this\r\nlapse of memory, receives the reminder with an indulgent smile.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the laboratory: Under the same conditions of weight,\r\ntemperature, and quantity of solvent, Pasteur placed successively, in\r\npresence of the two acids, all the substances capable of combining with\r\nthem. In this way he obtained right-handed and left-handed tartrates\r\nof potash, of soda, of ammonia, of lime, and of all the oxides\r\nproperly so called. He applied himself to the compounds--and they are\r\nnumerous--which deposit themselves in liquids under well-determined\r\ncrystalline forms. Without entering into the details of these long\r\nand patient studies, it may be stated generally that Pasteur proved\r\nthat whatever could be done with one of the tartaric acids could be\r\nrepeated rigorously, under similar conditions, with the other, the\r\nresultant products manifesting constantly the same properties, with\r\nthe single difference already exhibited by the two acids--that in the\r\none case the deviation of the plane of polarisation was to the right,\r\nwhile in the other it was to the left. With regard to all their other\r\nproperties, both chemical and physical, the identity was absolute.\r\nSolubility, simple refraction by solutions, double refraction by\r\ncrystals, the action of heat in producing decomposition, &c., the\r\nsimilitude extended to the most perfect identity.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Sciences, which shows by the rarity of its reports the\r\nimportance which it attaches to them, gave for the second time an\r\naccount of these new researches. M. Biot was again the reporter. It was\r\nwith a sort of coquetry that Pasteur brought from Strasburg perfectly\r\nlabelled specimens of the magnificent crystallisations of the double\r\nseries of right-handed and left-handed tartrates. By means of models he\r\nwas able to render the forms of these crystals visible at a distance.\r\n\r\nM. Biot undertook to bring the subject before the Academy. On the\r\nmorning of the day when he was to read his report he spent several\r\nhours in conversation with Pasteur. M. Biot became so excited during\r\nthe discussion that Madame Biot, with the solicitude peculiar to the\r\nwives of Academicians, requested Pasteur to change the subject of\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Academy shared the enthusiasm of M. Biot. Arago\r\nmoved that the report be inserted in the collected _mémoires_ of the\r\nAcademy. This was an exceptional honour. Arrived for the most part at\r\nthe end of their own careers, these learned men observed with pleasure\r\nthe incipient ray which had not yet become a glory but which was the\r\nprecursor thereof.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'My young friend,' said M. Biot to Pasteur, when presenting him to\r\nMitscherlich somewhere about that time, 'you may boast of having done\r\nsomething great, in having discovered what had escaped such a man as\r\nthis.'\r\n\r\n'I had studied,' replied Mitscherlich, not without a shade of regret,\r\naddressing himself to Pasteur, 'I had studied with so much care and\r\nperseverance, in their smallest details, the two salts which formed the\r\nsubject of my note to the Academy, that, if you have established what I\r\nwas unable to discover, you must have been guided to your result by a\r\npreconceived idea.'\r\n\r\nMitscherlich was right, and this preconceived idea might have been\r\nformulised thus: A dissymmetry in the internal molecular arrangement\r\nof a chemical substance ought to manifest itself in all its external\r\nproperties which are themselves capable of dissymmetry.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf this theoretic conception was correct, Pasteur might expect to\r\nfind that all the substances in which M. Biot had observed the power\r\nof rotating the plane of polarisation would possess the crystalline\r\ndissymmetry revealed by the absence of superposability. The result was\r\nin great part conformable to those previsions. The substances which\r\nacted upon polarised light, as liquids or solutions, were generally\r\nfound by Pasteur to produce dissymmetric crystals. Some of them,\r\nhowever, notwithstanding their power of crystallisation, exhibited,\r\nwhen crystallised, no dissymmetric face. This difficulty did not deter\r\nPasteur. It gave him, on the contrary, the opportunity of showing that\r\nwhen a theory had in so many cases proved itself correct, an apparent\r\nobjection must not be assumed insuperable without first sounding it to\r\nthe bottom. May it not be, he reasoned, that the absence of dissymmetry\r\nin substances which have the molecular rotatory power is not an\r\naccident; and may it not be possible, by changing the conditions of the\r\ncrystallisation, to make the dissymmetry appear?\r\n\r\nThen, in order to modify the crystalline forms of substances which\r\ndid not show themselves to be spontaneously dissymmetrical, Pasteur\r\nemployed a method which had been often tried before, though its\r\nprinciples could not be explained or its effects foreseen. In imitation\r\nof Romé de Lisle, Leblanc, and Beudant, he varied the nature of his\r\nsolvents; he introduced into the solution, sometimes an excess of acid\r\nor of base, sometimes foreign matters incapable of acting chemically\r\nupon those which were to be modified; he even employed sometimes impure\r\nmother liquids. On each occasion new facets were thus produced, and\r\nthese new facets showed the kind of dissymmetry which the optical\r\ncharacter demanded. Although he had to limit his researches to those\r\nsubstances which, by their ready crystallisation and the beauty of\r\ntheir forms, lent themselves best to this class of proofs, the results\r\nwere so far in accord with the previsions of theory, that no reasonable\r\ndoubt could exist as to the necessary correlation between dissymmetry\r\nand the power to deviate polarised light.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy these researches Pasteur was led to a conclusion, which is worthy\r\nof the most serious consideration, regarding the difference which\r\nexists between mineral species and artificial products on the one\r\nside, and the organic products which can be extracted from vegetables\r\nor animals on the other. All mineral or artificial products--for\r\nbrevity let us say all the products of inorganic nature--have a\r\nsuperposable image, and are therefore not dissymmetrical, while\r\nvegetable and animal products--in other words, products formed under\r\nthe influence of life--have an image not superposable; that is to say,\r\nthey are atomically dissymmetrical, this dissymmetry expressing itself\r\nexternally in the power of turning the plane of polarisation. If any\r\nexceptions exist they are more apparent than real. Pasteur himself\r\npointed out some of them, while demonstrating at the same time that\r\nit is easy to explain why all trace of dissymmetry disappears when\r\nsubstances which, like rock crystal, have an external dissymmetry are\r\nsubjected to the process of solution.\r\n\r\nAn apparent contradiction to this law of demarcation between artificial\r\nproducts and those of animal and vegetable life is presented by the\r\nexistence in living creatures of substances like oxalic acid, formic\r\nacid, urea, uric acid, creatine, &c. None of these products exert an\r\naction on polarised light or show any dissymmetry in the form of their\r\ncrystals. But it is necessary to observe that these products are the\r\nresult of secondary actions. Their formation is evidently governed by\r\nthe laws which determine the constitution of the artificial products\r\nof our laboratories, or of the mineral kingdom properly so called.\r\nIn living beings they are the products of excretion rather than\r\nsubstances essential to vegetable or animal life. When, on the other\r\nhand, we consider the most primordial substances of vegetables and\r\nanimals--those whereof it may be justly said that they are born under\r\nthe directive influence of _becoming_ life, such as cellulose, fecula,\r\nalbumen, fibrine, &c.--they are found to possess the power of acting,\r\non polarised light, a characteristic necessary and sufficient to\r\nestablish their internal dissymmetry, even when, through the absence of\r\ncrystallising power, they fail to manifest this dissymmetry outwardly.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, true to say that the products of inorganic nature,\r\nwhether mineral or artificial, have never yet presented molecular\r\ndissymmetry. It may also be affirmed that the substances which exert\r\nthe greatest influence in vital manifestations, which are present and\r\nactive in the seed and in the egg at the moment of the marvellous start\r\nof animal and vegetable life, all present molecular dissymmetry.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to indicate a more profound distinction between\r\nthe respective products of living and of mineral nature, than the\r\nexistence of this dissymmetry on the part of the one and its absence\r\non the part of the other? Is it not strange that not one of these\r\nthousands and thousands of artificial products of the laboratory, the\r\nnumber of which is each day augmented, should manifest either the power\r\nof turning the plane of polarisation or non-superposable dissymmetry?\r\nNo doubt natural dissymmetric substances--gum, sugar, tartaric and\r\nmalic acids, quinine, strychnine, essence of turpentine, &c.--may be\r\nemployed in forming new compounds which remain dissymmetric, though\r\nthey are artificially prepared; but it is evident that all these new\r\nproducts do but inherit the original dissymmetry of the substances from\r\nwhich they are derived. When chemical action becomes more profound, all\r\ndissymmetry disappears, and is never seen to reappear in the successive\r\nulterior products.\r\n\r\nWhat can be the causes of so great a difference? M. Pasteur has often\r\nexpressed to me the conviction that it must be attributed to the\r\ncircumstance that the molecular forces which operate in the mineral\r\nkingdom, and which are brought into play every day in our laboratories,\r\nare forces of the symmetrical order; while the forces which are\r\npresent and active at the moment when the grain sprouts, when the egg\r\ndevelops, and when, under the influence of the sun, the green matter\r\nof the leaves decomposes the carbonic acid of the air and utilises in\r\ndivers ways the carbon of this acid, the hydrogen of the water, and the\r\noxygen of these two products--are of the dissymmetric order, probably\r\ndepending on some of the grand, dissymmetric, cosmic phenomena of our\r\nuniverse. While expounding this opinion before the Academy of Sciences,\r\nPasteur, on one occasion, expressed himself thus:--\r\n\r\n'The universe is a dissymmetric whole. I am inclined to think that\r\nlife, as manifested to us, must be a function of the dissymmetry of the\r\nuniverse or of the consequences that follow in its train. The universe\r\nis dissymmetrical; for, placing before a mirror the group of bodies\r\nwhich compose the solar system, with their proper movements, we obtain\r\nin the mirror an image not superposable on the reality. Even the motion\r\nof solar light is dissymmetrical. A luminous ray never strikes in a\r\nstraight line, and at rest, the leaf wherein organic matter is created\r\nby vegetable life. Terrestrial magnetism, the opposition which exists\r\nbetween the north and south poles of a magnet, the opposition presented\r\nto us by positive and negative electricity, are all the resultants of\r\ndissymmetric actions and motions.'\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Pasteur, entering upon the labours which form the\r\nprincipal subject of this book, abandoned the study of molecular\r\nphysics and chemistry which had previously occupied him, all his\r\nthoughts were directed to the search of means suited to render evident\r\nthe influence of these causes and these phenomena. At Strasburg he\r\nhad procured powerful magnets with the view of comparing the actions\r\nof their poles, and, if possible, of introducing by their aid, among\r\nthe forms of crystals, a manifestation of dissymmetry. At Lille, where\r\nhe was nominated Dean of the Faculty of Sciences in 1854, he had\r\ncontrived a piece of clockwork intended to keep a plant in continual\r\nrotary motion, first in one direction and then in the other. 'All\r\nthis was gross,' he said to me one day; 'but, further than this, I\r\nhad proposed, with the view of influencing the vegetation of certain\r\nplants, to invert, by means of a heliostat and a reflecting mirror,\r\nthe motion of the solar rays which should strike them from the birth\r\nof their earliest shoots, and in this direction there was more to\r\nbe hoped for.' He never spoke of these attempts, because he had not\r\nhad the time to follow them to the issues of which he dreamed; but to\r\nthis day he remains persuaded that the barrier which exists between\r\nthe mineral and organic kingdoms--and which is revealed to our eyes by\r\nthe impossibility of producing, in the reactions of the laboratory,\r\ndissymmetric organic substances--can never be crossed until we have\r\nsucceeded in introducing among these reactions influences of the\r\ndissymmetric order. According to Pasteur, success in this direction\r\nwould give access to a new world of substances, and probably also of\r\norganic transformations. As we have succeeded in finding the inverse\r\nof right-handed tartaric acid, we may hope to obtain some day all the\r\nimmediate principles inverse to those now known to us. Who could say\r\nwhat vegetable and animal species would become if it were possible to\r\nreplace, in the living cells, cellulose, albumen, and their congeners,\r\nby their isomers with an inverse action? Certainly the thing is not\r\neasy, and Pasteur would be the last person to deceive himself as to\r\nthe difficulty of the problem. His latest thought on the matter is\r\nthis:--When the attempt is made to introduce into living species\r\nprimordial substances, inverse to those now existing, the great\r\ndifficulty will be to master the _tendency_ (_devenir_[7]) proper to\r\nthe species, a tendency which is potential in the germ of each of them.\r\nIn this germ, it is to be feared, the dissymmetry of the dissymmetric\r\nprimordial substances which it embraces will always manifest itself.\r\nAh! if spontaneous generation were possible; if we could form from\r\nmineral matter a living cell, how much more accessible would the\r\nproblem become! However this may be, we must seek, by all possible\r\nmeans, to produce molecular dissymmetry by the application of forces\r\nwhich have a dissymmetric action. 'We must,' said Pasteur to me on the\r\nday when, starting from the note of Mitscherlich, he passed all these\r\nthings in review, 'we must invoke the action of solenoid or helix.\r\nEntangled at present in labours more than sufficient to absorb whatever\r\nof ardour and of force still remains to me, I have no longer time to\r\noccupy myself with these questions.' But what great things are to be\r\ndone in following out this order of ideas, and what a route will be\r\nopened to young men possessed of that genius of invention which is\r\nevoked so often by persistent work!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis complete opposition between artificial mineral products and\r\nvegetable and animal ones was to Pasteur a truth so well established\r\nthat he found frequent opportunity of affirming it under decisive\r\ncircumstances. One day, a very skilful chemist, M. Dessaignes,\r\nwho later on became one of the correspondents of the Academy of\r\nSciences, announced that he had transformed fumaric and malic acids\r\ninto aspartic acid. Pasteur, who some time previously had had\r\noccasion to study these same acids, had proved that the two first\r\nhad no molecular dissymmetry--that is to say, they exercised no\r\noptic action. In the state of solution they did not turn the plane\r\nof polarised light. Aspartic acid, on the contrary, had presented to\r\nhim molecular dissymmetry, like asparagine itself. If the observation\r\nof M. Dessaignes were true, then bodies which were inert in regard\r\nto polarised light, and consequently non-dissymmetric, could be\r\ntransformed in the laboratory into active dissymmetric bodies. The\r\nline of demarcation so well established would be broken. Pasteur,\r\nwhose experience regarding the note of Mitscherlich had shown him how\r\neven the most conscientious observers may fail to seize upon fugitive\r\nappearances, when unprompted to seek them by a preconceived idea,\r\ndoubted at once the accuracy of the facts cited by M. Dessaignes. From\r\nStrasburg he started for Vendôme, where M. Dessaignes at that time\r\nresided. M. Dessaignes immediately gave Pasteur a small quantity of\r\nthe aspartic acid which he had prepared by means of fumaric and malic\r\nacids. Returning to his laboratory, Pasteur immediately recognised\r\nthat, despite the very close resemblance of the new acid of M.\r\nDessaignes to that derived from asparagine, the former differed from\r\nthe latter by the complete absence in its case of molecular dissymmetry.\r\n\r\nWith regard to other facts of the same kind, announced not only in\r\nFrance, but in Italy, and in England--chiefly the pretended formation\r\nof grape tartaric acid from succinic acid, artificial and inert,\r\nby Perkin and Duppa--Pasteur testified with absolute certainty of\r\njudgment to the existence of phenomenal peculiarities proper to these\r\nsubstances, which he had never seen, and which had, on the other hand,\r\nbeen the object of careful study by observers of great talent.\r\n\r\nAfter these verifications and deductions from theoretic views, Pasteur\r\ndiscovered a surprising connection between the prior researches of\r\nchemistry and crystallographic physics and the new and entirely\r\nunexpected results of physiological chemistry. This connection, like\r\nthe thread of Ariadne, conducted him to his recent great discoveries\r\nin medical biology. M. Chevreul was right when, some years ago, at the\r\nAcademy of Sciences, he expressed himself thus:--\r\n\r\n'It is by first examining in their chronological order the researches\r\nof M. Pasteur, and then considering them as a whole, that we are\r\nenabled to appreciate the rigour of judgment of that learned man in\r\nforming his conclusions, and the perspicacity of a mind which, strong\r\nin the truths which it has already discovered, is carried forward to\r\nthe establishment of new ones.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\nPasteur had thus established that bodies endowed with internal\r\ndissymmetry carried this property, in varying degrees, into their\r\ncompounds or their derivatives. When two of these bodies whose nature\r\nhas been revealed by the discovery of right-handed and left-handed\r\ntartaric acid, where all is chemically identical--and which are only\r\nto be distinguished from each other by their inverse crystallographic\r\nform, and by their action on polarised light--enter into combination\r\nwith a substance which is optically and crystallographically inert, the\r\nchemical identity ought, under these new conditions, to be preserved.\r\nEverything remains optically and crystallographically comparable.\r\nThe inert element adds nothing to, and takes away nothing from, the\r\ndissymmetric faculties of the active one.\r\n\r\nTo these curious studies Pasteur soon added a new chapter. He reasoned\r\nthus:--If into these compounds I introduce a substance possessing in\r\nitself the specific properties of dissymmetry, it is evident that this\r\nsubstance, while entering into these combinations, must preserve its\r\nown properties. The active substance would, from the moment of its\r\ncombination, add something to the properties of the molecular group\r\nwhich acts like itself, and subtract something from the properties\r\nof the group which acts in the opposite manner. The resultant effect\r\nof these actions, sometimes concordant, sometimes antagonistic, would\r\ncease to be alike in absolute quantity. And if this be the necessary\r\ncondition of similitude as to molecular arrangement, this similitude\r\nwould cease to exist, and with its disappearance would appear all the\r\ndifferences of chemical and physical properties which constitute its\r\noutward manifestations.\r\n\r\nThe facts were found to harmonise with these logical deductions. After\r\nhaving made dissymmetry intervene as a modifier of chemical affinity,\r\nhe had a strange and manifest proof of the influence of dissymmetry in\r\nthe phenomena of life.\r\n\r\nIt had been long known, through the observations of a manufacturer\r\nof chemical products in Germany, that the impure tartrate of lime of\r\ncommerce, if contaminated with organic matters and permitted to remain\r\nunder water in summer, would ferment and yield various products.\r\nPasteur caused the ordinary right-handed tartrate of ammonia to\r\nferment in the following manner:--He took some very pure crystalline\r\nsalt and dissolved it, adding at the same time to the liquid some\r\nalbuminoid matter, about one gramme to 100 grammes of the tartrate.\r\nThe liquid placed in a warm chamber fermented. During the process of\r\nfermentation the liquid mass, previously limpid, became gradually\r\nturbid, in consequence of the appearance of a small organism which\r\nplayed the part of ferment. Pasteur applied this mode of fermentation\r\nto the paratartrate of ammonia. He saw that this salt also fermented,\r\ndepositing the same organism. All appeared as if the course of things\r\nwas the same as in the case of the right-handed tartrate. But Pasteur,\r\nhaving had the idea of following the course of the operation with the\r\naid of the polariscope, soon detected a profound difference between\r\nthe two fermentations. In the case of the paratartrate, the liquid,\r\nat first inert, gradually assumed a sensible power of deviation to\r\nthe left, which augmented by degrees and attained a maximum. The\r\nfermentation was then suspended; there was no longer any of the\r\nright-handed acid in the liquid, which, when evaporated and mixed\r\nwith its own volume of alcohol, immediately furnished a beautiful\r\ncrystallisation of left-handed tartrate of ammonia.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment a great new fact was established--namely, that the\r\nmolecular dissymmetry proper to organic matters intervened in a\r\nphenomenon of the physiological order, and did so as a modifier of\r\nchemical affinity. The kind of dissymmetry proper to the molecular\r\narrangement of the left-handed tartaric acid was, no doubt, the sole\r\ncause of the difference between this acid and the right-handed acid, in\r\nregard to the fermentation produced by a microscopic fungus. We shall\r\nsee later on that organised ferments are almost always microscopic\r\nvegetables, which embrace in their constitution cellulose, albumen,\r\n&c., identical with these same substances taken from the higher class\r\nof vegetables and equally dissymmetric. We can thus understand, that\r\nfor the nutrition of the ferment and the formation of its principles\r\nthe chemical changes are more easy with one of the two tartaric acids\r\nthan with the other.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of the properties of the two tartaric acids, right and\r\nleft, at the moment when the conditions of life and nutrition of an\r\norganised being intervened, showed themselves still more strikingly\r\nin a very curious experiment made by Pasteur. He was the first to\r\nprove that mildew could live and multiply on a purely mineral soil,\r\ncomposed, for example, of the phosphates of potash, of magnesia, and\r\nan ammoniacal salt of an organic acid. For such a development of\r\nvegetable life he employed the seed of _penicillium glaucum_, which\r\nis to be found everywhere as common mould, and to which he offered,\r\nas its only carbon aliment, paratartaric acid. At the end of a little\r\ntime the left-handed tartaric acid appeared. Now this left-handed\r\nacid could only show itself on the condition that a rigorously equal\r\nquantity of the right-handed acid had been decomposed. The carbon of\r\nthe tartaric acid evidently supplied to the little plant the carbon\r\nthat was necessary for the formation of its constituents and all\r\ntheir organic accessories. If the microscopic seed of penicillium\r\nsown upon this soil was not formed of dissymmetric elements, as is\r\nthe case with all other vegetable substances, its development, its\r\nlife, its fructification would accommodate themselves equally well\r\nwith the left-handed tartaric acid as with the right. The fact that\r\nthe left-handed tartaric acid is less assimilable than its opposite\r\nis due solely and evidently to the dissymmetry of one or other of the\r\nprimordial substances of the little plant.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus for the first time was introduced into physiological studies and\r\nconsiderations the fact of the influence of the molecular dissymmetry\r\nof natural organic products.\r\n\r\nPasteur always speaks with enthusiasm of the grand future reserved for\r\nresearches which have this influence for their object; for molecular\r\ndissymmetry is the only sharp line of demarcation which exists between\r\nthe chemistry of inorganic and that of organic nature.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] [M. Pasteur appears to use the word _devenir_ as a substantive in a\r\nsense equivalent to the German _Werdende_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _FERMENTATION._\r\n\r\n\r\nArrived at this unexpected turn in the road which he had hitherto\r\npursued, Pasteur paused for an instant. Should he commit himself to the\r\ncourse which abruptly opened before him? His scientific instincts urged\r\nhim to do so, but the prudence and reserve which show themselves to be\r\nthe basis of his character, whenever he finds himself called upon to\r\nmake a choice of which the necessity is not absolutely demonstrated,\r\nheld him back. Was it not wiser to continue in the domain of molecular\r\nphysics and chemistry? M. Biot counselled his doing so; the route had\r\nbeen made plain, success awaited him at each step, but an incident\r\nconnected with the University triumphed over his hesitations.\r\n\r\nHe had just been nominated, at thirty-two years of age, Dean of the\r\nFaculté des Sciences at Lille. One of the principal industries of the\r\nDépartement du Nord is the fabrication of alcohol from beetroot and\r\nfrom corn. Pasteur resolved to devote a portion of his lectures to the\r\nstudy of fermentation. He felt that if he could make himself directly\r\nuseful to his hearers he would thereby excite general sympathy with,\r\nand direct attention to the new Faculté. The young man congratulated\r\nhimself on this idea, and the man of science rejoiced in it still more.\r\nHe was filled by the reflections suggested to him by the strangeness of\r\nthe phenomena which he had just encountered in regard to the molecular\r\ndissymmetry of the two tartaric acids, in connection with the life\r\nof a microscopic organism. He saw new light thrown upon the obscure\r\nproblem of fermentation. The part so active performed by an infinitely\r\nsmall organism could not, he thought, be an isolated fact. Behind this\r\nphenomenon must lie some great general law.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\nAll that has lived must die, and all that is dead must be\r\ndisintegrated, dissolved or gasified; the elements which are the\r\nsubstratum of life must enter into new cycles of life. If things were\r\notherwise, the matter of organised beings would encumber the surface of\r\nthe earth, and the law of the perpetuity of life would be compromised\r\nby the gradual exhaustion of its materials. One grand phenomenon\r\npresides over this vast work, the phenomenon of fermentation. But\r\nthis is only a word, and it suggests to the mind simply the internal\r\nmovements which all organised matter manifests spontaneously after\r\ndeath, without the intervention of the hand of man. What is, then,\r\nthe cause of the processes of fermentation, of putrefaction, and of\r\nslow combustion? How is the disappearance of the dead body or of the\r\nfallen plant to be accounted for? What is the explanation of the\r\nfoaming of the must in the vintage cask? of dough, which, abandoned to\r\nitself, rises and becomes sour? of milk, which curdles? of blood, which\r\nputrefies? of the heap of straw, which becomes manure? of dead leaves\r\nand plants embedded in the earth, which transform themselves into soil?\r\n\r\nMany different attempts were made to account for this mystery before\r\nscience was in a condition to approach it. In our age, and at the time\r\nwhen Pasteur was led to the study of the question, one theory held\r\nalmost undisputed sway. It was a very ancient theory, to which Liebig,\r\nin reviving it, had given the weight of his name. 'The ferments,' said\r\nLiebig, 'are all nitrogenous substances--albumen, fibrine, caseine;\r\nor the liquids which embrace them, milk, blood, urine--in a state of\r\nalteration which they undergo in contact with the air.'\r\n\r\nThe oxygen of the air was, according to this system, the first cause of\r\nthe molecular breaking up of the nitrogenous substances. The molecular\r\nmotions are gradually communicated from particle to particle in the\r\ninterior of the fermentable matter, which is thus resolved into new\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThese theoretic ideas regarding the part played in fermentation\r\nby the oxygen of the air were based upon experiments made in the\r\nbeginning of the century by Gay-Lussac. In examining the process of\r\nAppert for the preservation of animal and vegetable substances--a\r\nprocess which consisted in inclosing these substances in hermetically\r\nsealed vessels and heating them afterwards to a sufficiently high\r\ntemperature--Gay-Lussac had seen, for example, the must of the grape,\r\nwhich had been preserved without alteration during a whole year,\r\ncaused to enter into a state of fermentation by the simple fact of its\r\ntransference to another vessel--that is to say, by having been brought\r\nfor an instant into contact with the oxygen of the air. The oxygen of\r\nthe air appeared, then, to be the _primum movens_ of fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious chemists Berzelius and Mitscherlich explained the\r\nphenomena of fermentation otherwise. They placed these phenomena in the\r\nobscure class known as _phenomena of contact_. The ferment, in their\r\nview, took nothing from, and added nothing to, the fermentable matter.\r\nIt was an albuminoid substance, endowed with a force to which the name\r\n_catalytic_ was given. The ferment in fact acted by its mere presence.\r\n\r\nA very curious observation, however, had been made in France by\r\nCagniard-Latour and in Germany by Schwann. Cagniard-Latour, however,\r\nwas the first to publish this observation, which was destined to\r\nbecome so fruitful. One of the ferments most in use, and known as\r\nearly as the leavening of dough or the turning of milk, is the deposit\r\nformed in beer barrels, which is commonly called _yeast_. Repeating an\r\nobservation of the naturalist Leuwenhoeck, Cagniard-Latour saw this\r\nyeast, which was composed of cells, multiplying itself by budding, and\r\nhe proposed to himself the question whether the fermentation of sugar\r\nwas not connected with this act of cellular vegetation. But as in\r\nother fermentations the existence of an organism had not been observed\r\neven by the most careful search, the hypothesis of Cagniard-Latour of\r\na possible relation between the organisation of the ferment and the\r\nproperty of being a ferment was abandoned, though not without regret\r\nby some physiologists. M. Dumas, for example, recognised that in the\r\nbudding of the yeast globules there must be some clue to the phenomenon\r\nof fermentation. I, however, repeat that as nothing of the kind had\r\nbeen found elsewhere, and as all other fermentations presented the\r\ncommon character of requiring, to put them in train, organic matter in\r\na state of decomposition, the hypothesis of Cagniard-Latour remained a\r\nsimple incident, instead of having the value of a scientific principle.\r\n\r\nLiebig, moreover, carrying general opinion along with him, contended\r\nthat it is not because of its being organised that yeast is active,\r\nbut because of its being in contact with air. It is the dead\r\nportion of the yeast--that which has lived and is in the course of\r\nalteration--which acts upon the sugar.\r\n\r\nThe new memoirs published on the subject agreed in rejecting the\r\nhypothesis of any influence whatever of organisation or of life in the\r\nprocess of fermentation. Books, memoirs, dogmatic teaching, all were\r\nfavourable to the theoretic ideas of Liebig. If a few rare observers\r\nindicated the presence in certain fermentations of living organisms,\r\nthis presence was, in their opinion, a purely accidental fact, which,\r\ninstead of favouring the phenomenon of fermentation, was injurious to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFrom his first investigation on lactic fermentation Pasteur was led to\r\ntake an entirely different view of the matter. In this fermentation he\r\nrecognised the presence and the action of a living organism, which was\r\nthe ferment, just as yeast was the ferment of alcoholic fermentation.\r\nThe lactic ferment was formed of cells, or rather of little rods nipped\r\nat their centres, extremely small, being hardly the thousandth part\r\nof a millimeter in diameter.[8] It reproduced itself by fission--that\r\nis to say, the little rod divided itself at its middle and formed two\r\nshorter rods, which became elongated, nipped, in their turn, at their\r\ncentres, each giving rise, as before, to two rods. Each of these,\r\nagain, soon divided itself into two, and so on. Why had not this\r\nbeen observed prior to Pasteur? For the simple reason that chemists\r\nhad never observed the production of lactic fermentation except in\r\ncomplex substances. They mixed chalk with their milk for the purpose\r\nof preserving the neutrality of the fermenting medium. They employed\r\nsubstances such as caseine, gluten, animal membranes, all of which,\r\nwhen examined by the microscope, exhibited a multitude of mineral or\r\norganic granules, with which the lactic ferment was confounded. Thus\r\nthe first care of Pasteur, with the view of proving the presence of\r\nthe ferment and its life, was to replace the cheesy matter and all its\r\ncongeners by a soluble, nitrogenous body, which would permit of the\r\nmicroscopic examination of all the living cellular products.\r\n\r\nIn a memoir presented to the Academy of Sciences in 1857 Pasteur\r\nstated that there were 'cases where it is possible to recognise in\r\nlactic fermentation, as practised by chemists and manufacturers, above\r\nthe deposit of chalk and the nitrogenous matter, a grey substance\r\nwhich forms a zone on the surface of the deposit. Its examination\r\nby the microscope hardly permits of its being distinguished from\r\nthe disintegrated caseum or gluten which has served to start the\r\nfermentation. So that nothing indicates that it is a special kind\r\nof matter which had its birth during the fermentation. It is this,\r\nnevertheless, which plays the principal part.'\r\n\r\nTo isolate this substance and to prepare it in a state of purity,\r\nPasteur boiled a little yeast with from fifteen to twenty times its\r\nweight of water. He then carefully filtered the liquid, dissolved in it\r\nabout fifty grammes of sugar to the litre, and added to it some chalk.\r\nTaking then, by means of a drawn-out tube, from a good ordinary lactic\r\nfermentation a trace of the grey matter of which we have just spoken,\r\nhe placed it as the seed of the ferment in the limpid saccharine\r\nsolution. By the next day a lively and regular fermentation had set\r\nin, the liquid becoming turbid and the chalk disappearing, and one\r\ncould distinguish a deposit which progressed continually as the chalk\r\ndissolved. This deposit was the lactic ferment.\r\n\r\nPasteur reproduced this experiment by substituting for the water of the\r\nyeast a clear decoction of nitrogenous plastic substances. The ferment\r\ninvariably presented the same aspect and the same multiplication. These\r\nresults, however, did not yet satisfy Pasteur. He desired more rigour\r\nin a subject of such theoretic importance. Might not the partisans of\r\nLiebig's theory argue, if not without subtlety yet with a semblance\r\nof justice, that the fermentation was not due to the formation and\r\nprogressive growth of this feeble nitrogenous globular deposit, but\r\nrather to the nitrogenous matter dissolved during the decoction of the\r\nyeast used in the composition of the liquor? Up to a certain point\r\nit might be maintained that the dissolved matters which had been in\r\ncontact with the oxygen of the air had been thrown into molecular\r\nmotion, that this motion had been communicated to the fermentable\r\nmatter, and that the deposit of the pretended organised ferment was but\r\nan accident--one of the physical changes or one of the precipitates\r\nso frequently observed in the modifications of albuminoid matters. In\r\nthe observation of Cagniard-Latour and of Schwann as to the life of\r\nthe yeast, Liebig saw nothing more. 'One cannot deny,' said he, 'the\r\norganisation of the yeast or its multiplication by budding, but these\r\nliving cells are always associated with other dead cells in process of\r\nmolecular alteration. It is these molecular motions which communicate\r\nthemselves to the molecules of the sugar, break them up, and cause them\r\nto ferment.'\r\n\r\nThe arguments of Liebig derived great strength from the belief\r\nwhich was shared by all chemists that the cells of yeast perish\r\nduring fermentation and form lactate of ammonia. On examining this\r\nassertion, Pasteur found that not only was there no ammonia formed\r\nduring alcoholic fermentation, but that even if ammonia were added it\r\ndisappeared, entering into the formation of new yeast cells. Was not\r\nthis a proof of the potency of the organised ferment?\r\n\r\nTormented, however, by the idea that, notwithstanding all these facts,\r\nthe reasonings of Liebig might still find some credit, Pasteur worked\r\nearnestly to discover new facts capable of demonstrating that Liebig's\r\ntheory was absolutely false. He made two crucial experiments, the one\r\nrelating to the yeast of beer, or of alcohol, and the other relating\r\nto the lactic ferment. He introduced into a pure solution of sugar a\r\nsmall quantity of crystallisable salt of ammonia, then some phosphates\r\nof potash and magnesia, and he sowed in this medium an imponderable\r\nquantity, if we may so express it, of fresh cells of yeast. The cells\r\nthus sown multiplied, and the sugar fermented. In other words, the\r\nphosphorus, the potassium, the magnesium of the mineral salts, united\r\nto form the substances which compose the ferment. By this experiment,\r\nso simple and yet so demonstrative, the power of the organisation\r\nof the ferment was once for all established. The contact theory of\r\nBerzelius had no longer any meaning, since it was evident that the\r\nfermentable matter here furnished to the ferment one of its essential\r\nelements, namely, carbon. Liebig's theory of communicated molecular\r\nmotion, originating in a nitrogenous albuminoid substance, had no\r\nbetter claim, since such substances had been discarded. The whole\r\nprocess took place between the sugar and a ferment germ which owed its\r\nlife and development to nutritive matters, the most important of which\r\nwas the fermentable substance. Fermentation, in short, was simply a\r\nphenomenon of nutrition. The ferment augmented in weight, feeding upon\r\nthe sugar, and its vitality was such that it contrived to build up the\r\ncomplex materials of its own organisation by means of sugar and purely\r\nmineral elements.\r\n\r\nIn a second experiment, Pasteur demonstrated that, notwithstanding\r\ntheir smallness and the possibility of confounding them with the\r\namorphous granules of caseine and gluten, the little particles of\r\nlactic ferment were indeed alive, and that they, and they only, were\r\nthe cause of lactic fermentation. He mixed with some water, sweetened\r\nwith sugar, a small quantity of a salt of ammonia, some alkaline\r\nand earthy phosphates, and some pure carbonate of lime obtained by\r\nprecipitation. At the end of twenty-four hours the liquid began to get\r\nturbid and to give off gas. The fermentation continued for some days.\r\nThe ammonia disappeared, leaving a deposit of phosphates and calcareous\r\nsalt. Some lactate of lime was formed, and at the same time one could\r\nnotice the deposition of the little lactic ferment. The germs of the\r\nlactic ferment had, in this case, been derived from particles of dust\r\nadhering to the substances themselves, of which the mixtures were made,\r\nor to the vessels used, or from the surrounding air. The chapter on\r\nspontaneous generation will render this clear.\r\n\r\nIt suffices here to state that the results of this second experiment\r\nwere absolutely conclusive, and that the theories of contact force or\r\nof communicated motion, which up to that time had reigned in science,\r\nwere completely overthrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nThe light shed by these experiments quickly extended its sphere; and\r\nPasteur lost no time in discovering a new ferment, that of butyric\r\nacid. Having shown the absolute independence which exists between the\r\nferment of butyric acid and the others, he found, contrary to the\r\ngeneral belief, that the lactic ferment is incapable of giving rise\r\nto butyric acid, and that there exists a butyric fermentation having\r\nits own special ferment. This ferment consists of a species of vibrio.\r\nLittle transparent cylindrical rods, rounded at their extremities,\r\nisolated or united in chains of two or three, or sometimes even more,\r\nform these vibrios. They move by gliding, the body straight, or bending\r\nand undulating. They reproduce themselves by fission, and to this mode\r\nof generation their frequent arrangement in the form of a chain is due.\r\n\r\nSometimes one of the little rods, with a train of others behind it,\r\nagitates itself in a lively manner as if to detach itself from the\r\nrest. Often, also, the little rod, after being broken off, holds on\r\nstill to its chain by a mucous transparent thread.\r\n\r\nThese little infusoriæ may be sown like the yeast of beer or the lactic\r\nferment. If the medium in which they are sown is suitable for their\r\nnourishment, they will multiply to infinity; but the character most\r\nessential to be observed is, that they may be sown in a liquid which\r\ncontains only ammonia and crystallisable substances, together with\r\nthe fermentable substances, sugar, lactic acid, gum, &c. The butyric\r\nfermentation manifests itself as these little organisms multiply. Their\r\nweight sensibly increases, though it is always minute in comparison\r\nwith the quantity of butyric acid produced; this is found to be the\r\ncase in all other fermentations.\r\n\r\nThis experiment no doubt resembles those made with the alcoholic and\r\nlactic ferments. But it is distinguished from them by one circumstance\r\neminently worthy of attention. The butyric ferment, by its motions\r\nand by its mode of generation, furnishes the irrefutable proof of its\r\norganisation and of its life. This ferment, moreover, presented to\r\nPasteur a new and unexpected peculiarity. The vibrios live and multiply\r\nwithout the smallest supply of air or of free oxygen. Not only, indeed,\r\ndo they live without air, but the air destroys them and arrests the\r\nfermentation which they initiate. If a current of pure carbonic acid\r\nis made to pass into the liquid where they are multiplying, their life\r\nand reproduction do not appear to be at all affected by it. If, on the\r\ncontrary, instead of the current of carbonic acid we employ one of\r\natmospheric air for only one or two hours, the vibrios fall without\r\nmovement to the bottom of the vessel, and the butyric fermentation\r\nwhich was dependent on their existence is immediately arrested.\r\n\r\nPasteur designated this new class of organisms by the name of\r\n_anaérobies_; that is to say, beings which can live without air. He\r\nreserves the designation _aérobies_ for all the other microscopic\r\nbeings which, like the larger animals, cannot live without free oxygen.\r\n'It matters little,' added Pasteur, 'whether the progress of science\r\nmakes of this vibrio a plant or an animal; it is a living organism,\r\nendowed with motion, which is a ferment and which lives without air.'\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn meditating upon these facts, and upon the general character of\r\nfermentation, Pasteur soon found himself in a position to approach more\r\nnearly to the essential nature of these mysterious phenomena. In what\r\nway do microscopic organisms provoke the phenomena of fermentation?\r\n\r\nThe organism eats, if one may say so, one part of the fermentable\r\nmatter. But how does this phenomenon of nutrition differ so much from\r\nthat of higher beings? In general, for a given weight of nutritive\r\nmatter which the animal takes in, it assimilates a quantity of the\r\nsame order. In fermentation, on the contrary, the ferment, while\r\nnourishing itself with fermentable matter, decomposes a quantity\r\ngreat in comparison to its own individual weight. Again, the butyric\r\nferment lives without free oxygen. Is there not, said Pasteur, a hidden\r\nrelation between the property of being a ferment and the faculty of\r\nliving without free oxygen? Are not vibrios which imperatively require\r\nfor their nutrition and multiplication the presence of oxygen gas those\r\nwhich will never have the properties of ferments?\r\n\r\nPasteur then contrived a series of experiments with the view of placing\r\nin parallelism these two curious physiological facts: life without air\r\nand the characteristics of ferments.\r\n\r\nWe know how wine and beer are prepared. The must of grapes and the\r\nmust of beer are placed in wooden vats, or in barrels of greater or\r\nless dimensions. Whether the fermentation proceeds from germs taken\r\nfrom the exterior surface of the grapes, or from a small quantity\r\nof ferment sown in the must under the form of yeast, as in the\r\nfermentation of beer, the life of the ferment, its multiplication,\r\nthe augmentation of its weight, are so many vital actions which to a\r\ncertainty cannot borrow from the free oxygen of the external air, or\r\nfrom that originally dissolved in the must, an appreciable quantity of\r\nthis gas. All the life of the cells of the ferment which multiplies\r\nitself indefinitely appears then to take place apart from free oxygen\r\ngas. In certain breweries in England the fermenting vats have sometimes\r\na capacity of several thousands of hectolitres; and the fermentation\r\nliberates pure carbonic acid, a gas much heavier than atmospheric\r\nair, which rests on the surface of the liquid in the vat in a layer\r\nthick enough to protect the liquid underneath from any contact with\r\nthe external air. All this liquid mass, then, is inclosed between the\r\nwooden sides of the vat and a deep layer of heavy gas which contains\r\nno trace of free oxygen. In this liquid, nevertheless, the life of\r\nthe cells of the ferment and the production of all its constituents\r\ngo on for several days with extraordinary activity. Here certainly\r\nwe have life without air, and the ferment character expresses itself\r\nin the enormous difference between the weight of the ferment formed\r\nand collected from the vats under the name of yeast, at the end of\r\nthe operation, and the weight of the sugar which has fermented,\r\ntransforming itself into alcohol, carbonic acid, and various other\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nPasteur has studied experimentally that which takes place when, without\r\notherwise changing the conditions of these phenomena, the arrangement\r\nis so modified as to permit the introduction of the free oxygen of the\r\natmosphere. It sufficed for this purpose to provoke a fermentation of\r\nthe must of beer, or the must of grapes, upon shallow glass dishes\r\npresenting a large surface, or in a flat-bottomed wooden trough with\r\nsides a few centimeters in height, instead of in deep vats as before.\r\nIn these new conditions the fermentation manifests an activity even\r\nmore extraordinary than it did in the deep vats. The life of the\r\nferment is itself singularly enhanced, but the proportion of the weight\r\nof the decomposed sugar to that of the yeast formed is absolutely\r\ndifferent in the two cases. While, for example, in the deep vats, a\r\nkilogram of ferment sometimes decomposes seventy, eighty, one hundred,\r\nor even one hundred and fifty kilograms of sugar, in the shallow\r\ntroughs one kilogram of the ferment will be found to correspond to only\r\nfive or six kilograms of decomposed sugar. These proportions between\r\nthe weight of the sugar which ferments and the weight of the ferment\r\nproduced, constitute the measure of what one might call the ferment's\r\ncharacter--of that character which distinguishes its mode of life from\r\nthat of all other existences, great or small, in which the weight of\r\nthe organising matter and the assimilated alimentary matter are about\r\nequal. In other words, the more free oxygen the yeast ferment consumes,\r\nthe less is its power as a ferment. Such is the case in the shallow\r\ntroughs where the extended surface is exposed to the contact of the\r\noxygen of the air. The more, on the contrary, the life of the ferment\r\nis carried on without the presence of free oxygen, the greater is its\r\npower of decomposing and of fermenting the saccharine matter. This is\r\nthe case in deep casks. The intimate co-relation then between life\r\nwithout air and fermentation appears complete.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected light which these facts threw upon the cause of the\r\nphenomena of fermentation made a forcible impression upon all thinking\r\nminds. 'In these infinitely small organisms,' M. Dumas said one day\r\nto M. Pasteur before the Academy of Sciences, 'you have discovered\r\na third kingdom--the kingdom to which those organisms belong which,\r\nwith all the prerogatives of animal life, do not require air for their\r\nexistence, and which find the heat that is necessary for them in the\r\nchemical decompositions which they set up around them.'\r\n\r\nThe work of Pasteur, demonstrating that fermentation was always\r\ndependent on the life of a microscopic organism, continued without\r\ninterruption. One of the most remarkable of his researches is that\r\nwhich relates to the fermentation of the tartrate of lime. The\r\ndemonstration of life and of fermentation without free oxygen is in\r\nthis paper carried to the utmost limits of experimental rigour and\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\nBut there is still another class of chemical phenomena where the life\r\nwithout air of microscopic organisms is fully shown. Pasteur proved\r\nthat in the special fermentation which bears the name of putrefaction\r\nthe _primum movens_ of the putrefaction resides in microscopic vibrios\r\nof absolutely the same order as those which compose the butyric\r\nferment. The fermentation of sugar, of mannite, of gums, of lactate\r\nof lime, by the butyric vibrio, so closely resembles the phenomena of\r\nputrefaction, that one might call these fermentations the putrefaction\r\nof sugar and of the other products.\r\n\r\nIf it has been thought right to call the fermentation of animal matters\r\nputrefaction, it is because at the moment of the decomposition of\r\nfibrine, of albumen, of blood, of gelatine, of the substance of the\r\ntendons, &c., the sulphur, and even the phosphorus, which enter into\r\ntheir composition give rise to putrid odours, due to the evil-smelling\r\ngases of sulphur and phosphorus.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of putrefaction being then simply fermentations,\r\ndiffering only in regard to the chemical composition of the fermenting\r\nmatters, Liebig naturally included them in his general theory of\r\nthe decomposition of organic matters after death. At a period long\r\nantecedent to Pasteur's labours it had been established that there\r\nexisted in putrefying matters fungi or microscopic animalculæ, and the\r\nidea had taken shape that these creatures might have an influence in\r\nthe phenomena. The proofs were wanting, but the notion of a possible\r\nrelation remained. We may read in his 'Lessons on Chemistry' with what\r\ndisdain Liebig mentioned these hypothetical opinions.\r\n\r\n'Those who pretend to explain the putrefaction of animal substances\r\nby the presence of animalculæ,' he wrote, 'reason very much like a\r\nchild who would explain the rapidity of the Rhine by attributing it\r\nto the violent motions imparted to it in the direction of Bingen\r\nby the numerous wheels of the mills of Mayence. Is it possible to\r\nconsider plants and animals as the causes of the destruction of\r\nother organisms when their own elements are condemned to undergo\r\nthe same decompositions as the creatures which have preceded them?\r\nIf the fungus is the cause of the destruction of the oak, if the\r\nmicroscopic animalcula is the cause of the putrefaction of the dead\r\nelephant, I would ask in my turn what is the cause which determines the\r\nputrefaction of the fungus or of the microscopic animalcula when life\r\nis withdrawn from these two organisms?'\r\n\r\nThirty-two years later, and after Pasteur had accumulated, during more\r\nthan twenty years, proof upon proof that the theory of Liebig would not\r\nstand examination, a physician of Paris, M. Bouillaud, asked, with the\r\ninsistent voice of a querulous octogenarian: 'Let M. Pasteur then tell\r\nus here, in presence of the Académie de Médecine, what are the ferments\r\nof the ferments.'\r\n\r\nBefore replying to this argument, which Liebig and M. Bouillaud\r\nbelieved to be irrefutable, Pasteur, wishing to mark all the phases\r\nof the phenomena, expounded in a short preamble the part played by\r\natmospheric oxygen in the destruction of animal and vegetable matters\r\nafter death. It is easy to understand, indeed, that fermentation and\r\nputrefaction only represent the first phase of the return to the\r\natmosphere and to the soil of all that has lived. Fermentations and\r\nputrefactions give rise to substances which are still very complex,\r\nalthough they represent the products of decomposition of fermentable\r\nmatters. When sugar ferments, a large proportion of it becomes gas;\r\nbut alongside of the carbonic acid gas which is formed, and which\r\nis, indeed, a partial return of the sugar to the atmosphere, new\r\nsubstances, such as alcohol, succinic acid, glycerine, and materials\r\nof yeast, are produced. When the flesh of animals putrifies, certain\r\nproducts of decomposition, also very complex, are formed with the\r\nvapour of water and the other gases of putrefaction. Where, then, does\r\nnature find the agents of destruction of these secondary products?\r\n\r\nThe great fact of the destruction of animal and vegetable matters\r\nis accomplished by slow combustion, through the appropriation of\r\natmospheric oxygen. Here, again, one must banish from science the\r\npreconceived views which assumed that the oxygen seized directly on the\r\norganic matter after death, and that this matter was consumed by purely\r\nchemical processes. It is life that presides over this work of death.\r\n\r\nIf fermentation and putrefaction are principally the work of\r\nmicroscopic anaérobies, living without free oxygen, the slow combustion\r\nis found very largely, if not exclusively, to depend upon a class of\r\ninfinitely small aérobies. It is these last which have the property\r\nof consuming the oxygen of the air. It is these lower organisms which\r\nare the powerful agents in the return to the atmosphere of all which\r\nhas lived. Mildew, mould, bacteria, which we have already noticed,\r\nmonads, two thousand of which would go to make up a millimeter,\r\nall these microscopic organisms are charged with the great work of\r\nre-establishing the equilibrium of life by giving back to it all that\r\nit has formed.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the important part played everywhere by these\r\nmicroscopic organisms, Pasteur made two experiments. He first\r\nintroduced into vessels air deprived of all dust. This process we shall\r\nhave occasion to examine in all its details, in connection with the\r\nresearches on spontaneous generation. In these vessels, containing pure\r\nair, were placed the water of yeast with sugar dissolved in it, milk,\r\nsawdust--all of which had been deprived by heat of the germs of the\r\nlower organisms. The vessels and their contents were then subjected to\r\na temperature of twenty-five to thirty-five degrees Centigrade. In a\r\nseries of parallel experiments, made under the same conditions and at\r\nthe same temperature, Pasteur took no steps to prevent the germination\r\nof the little seeds of mould suspended in the air, or associated with\r\nthe substances contained in the vessels, neither did he avoid other\r\ninfinitely small germs of the class aérobies.\r\n\r\nAfter some time the air of all the vessels of the two series was\r\nsubmitted to analysis, when, behold, a very interesting fact! In the\r\nvessels where life had been withdrawn from the organic matters--that\r\nis to say, where there were no germs--the air still contained a\r\nlarge proportion of oxygen. In the vessels, on the contrary, where\r\nthe microscopic organisms had been allowed to develop, the oxygen\r\nwas totally absent, having been replaced by carbonic acid gas. And,\r\nfurther, for this absorption and total consumption of the oxygen gas a\r\nfew days had sufficed; while in the vessels without microscopic life\r\nthere remained, after several years, a considerable quantity of oxygen\r\nin a free state, so weak is the proportion of oxygen that the organic\r\nmatters consume directly and chemically when the infinitely small\r\norganisms are absent.\r\n\r\nBut can these microscopic organisms, after having decomposed or burnt\r\nup all these secondary products, be in their turn decomposed?\r\n\r\nHow, cried M. Bouillaud, repeating his question, can they be destroyed\r\nor decomposed? How can their materials, which are of the same order\r\nas those of all the living creatures of the earth, be gasified and\r\ncaused to return to the atmosphere? After having been charged with the\r\ntransformation of others, whose business will it be to transform them?\r\n\r\nA ferment which has finished its work, replied Pasteur, and which\r\nfor want of aliment cannot continue it, becomes in its turn an\r\naccumulation, so to speak, of dead organic matters. Such, for example,\r\nwould be an accumulation of yeast exposed to the air. Leave this\r\nmass to itself in summer temperature, and you will see appear in the\r\ninterior of the mass anaérobic vibrios and the putrefactions associated\r\nwith their life when protected from contact with the air. At the same\r\ntime, on the surface of the entire mass--that is to say, that which\r\nfinds itself in immediate contact with the oxygen of the air--the germs\r\nof bacteria, the seeds of mould will grow, and, by fixing the oxygen,\r\ndetermine the slow combustions which gasify the mass. The ferments\r\nof ferments are simply ferments. As long as the aérobic ferments of\r\nthe surface have at their disposal free oxygen, they will multiply\r\nand continue their work of destruction. The anaérobic vibrios perish\r\nfor want of new matter to decompose, and they form, in their turn, a\r\nmass of organic matter which, by and by, becomes the prey of aérobies.\r\nThe portion of the aérobies which has lived becomes the prey either\r\nof new aérobies of different species, or of individuals of their own\r\nspecies, so that from putrefaction to putrefaction, and from combustion\r\nto combustion, the organic mass with which we started finds itself\r\nreduced to an assemblage of anaérobic and aérobic germs--of those same\r\ngerms which were mixed up in the original primitive organic substances.\r\n\r\nThough a collection of germs becomes again in its turn a collection\r\nof organic matter, subject to the double action of the phenomena of\r\nputrefaction and of combustion, there need be no anxiety as to their\r\nultimate destruction; in the final analysis they represent life under\r\nits eternal form, for life is the germ, and the germ is life.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus in the destruction of that which has lived, all reduces\r\nitself to the simultaneous action of these three great natural\r\nphenomena--fermentation, putrefaction, and slow combustion. A living\r\norganism dies--animal, or plant, or the remains of one or the other.\r\nIt is exposed to the contact of the air. To the life which has quitted\r\nit succeeds life under other forms. In the superficial parts, which\r\nthe air can reach, the germs of the infinitely small aérobies hatch\r\nand multiply themselves. The carbon, the hydrogen, and the nitrogen\r\nof the organic matters are transformed by the oxygen of the air, and\r\nunder the influence of the life of these aérobies, into carbonic acid,\r\nvapour of water, and ammonia gas. As long as organic matter and air\r\nare present, these combustions will continue. While these superficial\r\ncombustions are going on, fermentation and putrefaction are doing\r\ntheir work in the interior of the mass by the developed germs of the\r\nanaérobies, which not only do not require oxygen for their life, but\r\nwhich oxygen actually kills. Little by little, at length, by this work\r\nof fermentation and slow combustion, the phenomenon is accomplished.\r\nWhether in the free atmosphere, or under the earth, which is always\r\nmore or less impregnated with air, all animal and vegetable matters\r\nend by disappearing. To arrest these phenomena an extremely low\r\ntemperature is required. It is thus that in the ice of the Polar\r\nregions antediluvian elephants have been found perfectly intact. The\r\nmicroscopic organisms could not live in so cold a temperature. These\r\nfacts still further strengthen all the new ideas as to the important\r\npart performed by these infinitely small organisms, which are, in fact,\r\nthe masters of the world. If we could suppress their work, which is\r\nalways going on, the surface of the globe, encumbered with organic\r\nmatters, would soon become uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[8] [A millimeter is 1/25th of an inch.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _ACETIC FERMENTATION._\r\n\r\n                      THE MANUFACTURE OF VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Pasteur came upon a most curious illustration of\r\nthe 'fixation' of atmospheric oxygen by a microscopic organism--the\r\ntransformation of wine into vinegar. As its name indicates, vinegar is\r\nnothing else than wine turned sour. Everybody has remarked that wine,\r\nleft to itself, in circumstances which occur daily, is frequently\r\ntransformed into vinegar. This is noticed more particularly when\r\nbottles, having been uncorked, are left in a half-empty condition.\r\nSometimes, however, wine turns sour even in corked bottles. In this\r\ncase we may be sure that the bottles have been standing upright, and\r\nthat corks more or less defective have permitted the air to penetrate\r\ninto the wine. The presence of air, in fact, is indispensable to the\r\nchemical act of transforming wine into vinegar. How does this air\r\nintervene? And what is the little microscopic creature which, in\r\nconjunction with the air, becomes the agent of this fermentation?\r\n\r\nIn a celebrated lecture given at Orleans at the request of the\r\nmanufacturers of vinegar in that town, Pasteur, after having stated the\r\ntwo foregoing scientific questions, proceeded to examine the difference\r\nbetween wine and vinegar. What takes place in the fermentation of the\r\njuice of the grape which yields the wine? The sugar of this juice\r\ndisappears, giving place to carbonic acid gas, which is exhaled during\r\nfermentation, and to alcohol, which remains in the fermented liquid.\r\nFormerly, chemists gave the name of 'spirit' to all volatile matters\r\nwhich could be collected from distillation. Now, when we distil wine\r\nand condense the vapour in a worm surrounded by cold water, we collect\r\nthe spirit of wine at the extremity of the worm--this, when the water\r\nwith which it is mixed during distillation is withdrawn from it, we\r\ndesignate by the name of alcohol. Vinegar contains no alcohol. When\r\ndistilled it yields water and a spirit. But this spirit is acid, with a\r\nvery pungent odour, and not inflammable like spirit of wine. Separated\r\nfrom the water which had accompanied it during the distillation, this\r\nspirit takes the name of acetic acid. This is the form in which it is\r\nused in smelling bottles--in those bottles of English salts the vapour\r\nof which is so penetrating.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of vinegar in contact with air the alcohol disappears,\r\nand is replaced by acetic acid. The air has thus given up something to\r\nthe wine. Atmospheric air every one knows to be a mixture of nitrogen\r\nand oxygen, the nitrogen in the proportion of four-fifths of the total\r\nvolume, and the oxygen of one-fifth. Well, in the transformation of\r\nwine into vinegar the nitrogen remains inactive. It is the oxygen alone\r\nwhich enters into combination with the alcohol. You ask for the proof\r\nof this? Take a bottle of wine turned sour, a bottle which at the same\r\ntime is stopped hermetically; if the oxygen of the air contained in the\r\nbottle has combined with the alcohol, then, instead of air, there will\r\nbe nothing in the bottle but nitrogen gas. Turn the bottle upside down\r\nand open it in a basin of water. The water of the basin will rush into\r\nthe bottle to fill the partial vacuum created by the disappearance of\r\nthe oxygen. The volume of water which enters the bottle is precisely\r\nequal to a fifth part of the total original volume of the air which the\r\nbottle contained at the time when it was closed. Moreover, it is easy\r\nto show that the gas which remains in the bottle has the properties of\r\nnitrogen gas. A lighted match is extinguished in it as if plunged into\r\nwater, and a bird dies immediately in it of asphyxia.\r\n\r\nIf we confine our knowledge to what has gone before, it would seem that\r\nalcohol diluted with water and exposed to the air ought to furnish\r\nacetic acid. It is not so, however. Pure water alcoholised to the\r\ndegree of ordinary wines may remain for whole years in contact with\r\nthe air, without the least acetification. In this difference between\r\nnatural wine and pure water alcoholised, and exposed to contact with\r\nair, we touch upon a vital point in the phenomena of fermentation. The\r\ncelebrated theory of Liebig, which Pasteur was destined to overthrow,\r\nmight be thus summed up:--If pure alcoholised water cannot become sour\r\nin contact with air, as is the case with wine, it is because the pure\r\nalcoholised water lacks the albuminoid substance which exists in the\r\nwine in a state of chemical alteration, and which is a ferment capable\r\nof causing the oxygen of the air to combine with the alcohol. And the\r\nproof, according to Liebig, that things act rigorously thus is, that if\r\nyou add to the mixture of water and alcohol a little flour, or a little\r\nmeat-juice, or even a minute quantity of any vegetable juice, the\r\nacetic fermentation arises, as if by compulsion. In other words, by the\r\naddition of a small quantity of any nitrogenised substance in process\r\nof alteration, you cause the union of the oxygen of the air with the\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nThere is doubtless always in the wine, when it turns sour, a necessary\r\nintermediary, producing the fixation of the oxygen of the air; since\r\nin no circumstances can pure alcohol, diluted to any degree whatever\r\nwith pure water, transform itself into vinegar. But this necessary\r\nintermediary is not, as the German theory would have it, a dead\r\nalbuminoid substance; it is a plant, and of all plants one of the\r\nsimplest and most minute, which has been known from time immemorial\r\nunder the name of flower of vinegar. This little fungus is invariably\r\npresent on the surface of a wine which is being transformed into\r\nvinegar. Liebig was not ignorant of this, but he regarded it as a\r\nsimple coincidence. Do we not know, said he, that whenever an infusion\r\nof organic matter is exposed to the air it becomes covered with a\r\ncryptogamic vegetation, or is invaded by a crowd of animalculæ? Is not\r\nvinegar a vegetable infusion? Vinegar affords a refuge to the flower of\r\nvinegar, just as it gives refuge to what are called the little eels of\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\nWe can appreciate here the uncertainties of pure observation. The\r\ngreat art--and no one practised it better than Pasteur--consists in\r\ninstituting decisive experiments which leave no room for an inexact\r\ninterpretation of facts. These decisive proofs of the true part\r\nplayed by the little microscopic fungus, by this flower of vinegar,\r\nthis mycoderma aceti, are thus formulated by Pasteur. It is but\r\nanother example of the method which he used in alcoholic, lactic, and\r\ntartaric fermentations. The theories of Berzelius, of Mitscherlich,\r\nand of Liebig were destined again to receive the rudest shocks by the\r\ndemonstration of these rigorous facts.\r\n\r\nLet us place a little wine in a bottle, then hermetically seal it,\r\nand leave it to itself. In these conditions the wine becomes sour.\r\nBut if we take the precaution of putting the bottle into hot water,\r\nso that the wine and the air in the bottle may be heated for some\r\ninstants to a temperature of 60° Centigrade, and if, after cooling, we\r\nleave the bottle to itself, the wine in these conditions will never\r\nbecome transformed into vinegar. The heating, however, must have left\r\nintact the albuminoid or nitrogenous substances contained in the\r\nwine. These, then, cannot constitute the ferment of the vinegar. Can\r\nit be maintained that by heating the wine to 60° we have altered the\r\nalbuminoid matter, which is, on this account, no longer able to act as\r\na ferment, or, in other words, no longer able to determine the union\r\nof the oxygen of the air with the alcohol? This hypothesis falls to\r\npieces before the following experiment. Open the bottle, blow into it\r\nwith bellows, so that the once heated wine shall come into contact with\r\nordinary air, and the acetification of the wine will take place.\r\n\r\nBut the master experiment is the following. We have seen that pure\r\nalcoholised water never turns sour unless some albuminoid matter is\r\nintroduced into it. Pasteur saw that this albuminoid matter might\r\nbe completely suppressed and replaced by saline crystallisable\r\nsubstances, alkaline and earthy phosphates, to which has been added a\r\nlittle phosphate of ammonia. In these conditions, especially if the\r\nalcoholised water be acidulated by small quantities of pure acetic\r\nacid, one actually sees the mycoderm developing, and the alcohol\r\ntransforming itself into acetic acid. It is not possible to demonstrate\r\nin a more convincing manner that the albuminoid matters of the wine are\r\nnot in this case the acetic ferment. These albuminoid matters, however,\r\ncontribute to the acetic fermentation, but only as being an aliment to\r\nthe mycoderma aceti, and notably a nitrogenous aliment. The true and\r\nonly ferment of vinegar is the little fungus; it is the great agent of\r\nthe phenomenon; it, indeed, accomplishes all.\r\n\r\nIs there not a great charm in seeing an obscure subject clearly\r\nilluminated by facts well understood and well interpreted? If in a\r\nbottle containing wine and air and raised to a temperature of 50° or\r\n60° the wine never turns sour, it is because the germs of the mycoderma\r\naceti, which the wine and the air hold in suspension, are deprived of\r\nall vitality by the heat. Placed, however, in contact with ordinary\r\nair, this once-heated wine can turn sour; because, though the germs of\r\nthe mycoderma aceti contained at first in the wine are killed, this\r\nis not the case with those derived from the surrounding air. Pure\r\nalcoholised water never turns sour, even in contact with ordinary air,\r\nand with whatever germs this air may carry, or that may be found in the\r\ndust of the vessels which receive it. The reason is that these germs\r\ncannot become fertile because of the absence of their indispensable\r\nfood. Wine in bottles well filled and laid flat do not acetify; this is\r\nbecause the mycoderm cannot multiply for lack of oxygen. Without doubt\r\nthe air constantly penetrates through the pores of the cork, but always\r\nin such feeble quantities that the colouring matters of the wine, and\r\nother more or less oxydisable constituents, take possession of it\r\nwithout leaving the smallest quantity for the germs of the mycoderm\r\nwhich are generally suspended in the wine. When the bottle is upright\r\nthe conditions are quite altered. The desiccation of the cork renders\r\nit much more permeable to the air, and the germs of the mycoderm on the\r\nsurface of the liquid, if any exist there, are enveloped by air.\r\n\r\nThus, to recapitulate in a few words the principles which have just\r\nbeen established; it is easy to see that the formation of vinegar is\r\nalways preceded by the development, on the surface of the wine, of a\r\nlittle plant formed of strangulated particles, of an extreme tenuity,\r\nand the accumulation of which sometimes takes the form of a hardly\r\nvisible veil, sometimes of a wrinkled film of very slight thickness,\r\nand greasy to the touch, because of the various fatty matters which the\r\nplant contains.\r\n\r\nThis cryptogam has the singular property of condensing considerable\r\nquantities of oxygen and of provoking the _fixation_ of this gas upon\r\nthe alcohol, which is thereby transformed into acetic acid. The little\r\nmycoderm is not less exacting than larger vegetables. It must have\r\nits appropriate aliments. Wine offers them in abundance: nitrogenous\r\nmatters, the phosphates of magnesia and of potash. The mycoderm\r\nthrives, moreover, in warm climates. To cultivate it in temperate\r\nregions like ours it is well to warm artificially the places where it\r\nis cultivated. But if wine contains within itself all the elements\r\nnecessary to the life of the little mycoderm, this life is further\r\npromoted by rendering the wine more acid through the addition of acetic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, can be more simple than to produce vinegar from wine--a\r\nmanufacture which justly makes the reputation of the town of Orleans?\r\nTake some wine, and after having mixed with it one-fourth or one-third\r\nof its volume of vinegar already formed, sow on its surface the little\r\nplant which does the work of acetification. It is only necessary to\r\nskim off, by means of a wooden spatula, a little of the mycodermic film\r\nfrom a liquid covered with it, and to transfer it to the liquid to be\r\nacetified. The fatty matters which it contains render the wetting of\r\nit difficult. Thus, when we plunge into the liquid the spatula covered\r\nwith the film, the latter detaches itself and spreads out over the\r\nsurface instead of falling to the bottom. When we operate in summer,\r\nor in a room heated to 15° or 25° Centigrade in winter, in twenty-four\r\nor forty-eight hours at most, the mycoderm covers the whole liquid,\r\nso easy and rapid is its development. After some days all the wine has\r\nbecome vinegar.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, in a discussion which he was holding at the Academy\r\nof Sciences, Pasteur, wishing to affirm the prodigious activity of the\r\nlife and multiplication of this little organism, expressed himself\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n'I would undertake in the space of twenty-four hours to cover with\r\nmycoderma aceti a surface of vinous liquid as large as the hall in\r\nwhich we are here assembled. I should only have to sow in it the day\r\nbefore almost invisible particles of newly-formed mycoderma aceti.'\r\n\r\nLet the reader try to imagine the millions upon millions of little\r\nmycoderma particles which would come to life in that one day.\r\n\r\nBut how is the mycoderm seed to be obtained in the first instance?\r\nNothing more simple. The mycoderma aceti is one of those little\r\nso-called 'spontaneous' productions which are sure to appear of\r\nthemselves on the surface of liquids or infusions suitable to their\r\ndevelopment. In wine, in vinegar, or suspended in air, everywhere\r\naround us, in our towns, in our houses, there exist germs of this\r\nlittle plant. If we wish to procure some fresh mycoderm it is only\r\nnecessary to put a mixture of wine and vinegar into a warm place. In a\r\nfew days, generally, if not always, there appear here and there little\r\ngreyish patches scattering the light instead of regularly reflecting\r\nit, as does the surrounding liquid. These specks go on increasing\r\nprogressively and rapidly. This is the mycoderma aceti raised from\r\nthe seeds which the wine or the added vinegar contained, or which the\r\nair deposited; just as we see a field covered with divers weeds by\r\nseeds naturally distributed in the earth, or which have been brought\r\nto it by the wind or by animals. Even in this last circumstance the\r\ncomparison holds good, for after you have put wine or vinegar in a\r\nwarm place there soon appear, whence we know not, little reddish\r\nflies, so commonly seen in vinegar manufactories, and in all places\r\nwhere vegetable matter is turning sour. With their feet, or with their\r\nprobosces, these flies transport the seed.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Orleans the process for the manufacture of vinegar is very simple.\r\nBarrels ranged over each other have on each of their vertically-placed\r\nbottoms a circular opening some centimeters in diameter, and a smaller\r\nhole adjacent, called _fausset_, for the air to pass in and out when\r\nthe large opening is closed, either by the funnel, through which the\r\nwine is introduced, or by the syphon, which is used for drawing off the\r\nvinegar. These barrels, of which the capacity is 230 litres, are half\r\nfilled. The manual labour consists in keeping up a suitable temperature\r\nin the vessel, and in drawing from it every eight days about eight or\r\nten litres of vinegar, which are replaced by eight or ten litres of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nA barrel in which this give-and-take of wine and vinegar goes on is\r\ntechnically called a 'mother.' The starting of a 'mother' is not a\r\nrapid process. We begin by introducing into the barrel 100 litres of\r\nvery good and very limpid vinegar; then two litres only of wine are\r\nadded. Eight days after, three litres of wine are added, a week later\r\nfour or five, until the barrel contains about 180 to 200 litres. Then\r\nfor the first time vinegar is drawn off in sufficient quantity to bring\r\nback the volume of the liquid to about 100 litres. At this moment the\r\nlabours of the 'mother' begin. Henceforward ten litres of vinegar may\r\nbe drawn off every eight days, to be replaced by ten litres of wine.\r\nThis is the maximum that a cask can yield in a week. When the casks\r\nwork badly, as is often the case, it is necessary to diminish their\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThis Orleans system has many drawbacks. It requires three or four\r\nmonths to prepare what is called a 'mother,' which must be nourished\r\nwith wine _very_ regularly once a week under penalty of seeing it\r\nlose all its power. Then it is necessary to continue the manufacture\r\nat all times, whether the vinegar be required or not. To reconstitute\r\na 'mother,' one must begin from the very beginning, a process which\r\ninvolves a loss of three or four months' time. Lastly--a condition\r\nwhich is at times very inconvenient--a 'mother' cannot be transported\r\nfrom one place to another, or even from one part of the same locality\r\nto another. The 'mother,' in fact, must rest immovable.\r\n\r\nPasteur advised the suppression of the 'mothers.' He recommended an\r\napparatus, which is simply a vat, placed in a chamber the temperature\r\nof which can be raised to 20° or 25° Centigrade. In these vats vinegar\r\nalready formed is mixed with wine. On the surface is sown the little\r\nplant which converts the wine into vinegar. The mode of sowing it has\r\nbeen already explained. The acetification begins with the development\r\nof the plant.\r\n\r\nA great merchant of Orleans, who had from the first adopted Pasteur's\r\nprocess, and who had won the prize offered by the 'Society for the\r\nEncouragement of National Industry' for a manufactory perfected after\r\nthese principles, has stated that at the end of nine or ten days,\r\nsometimes even in eight, all the acetified wine is converted into\r\nvinegar. From a hundred litres of wine he drew off ninety-five litres\r\nof vinegar. After the great rise of temperature observed at the moment\r\nof the formation of the vinegar, and which is caused by the chemical\r\nunion of the alcohol and the oxygen of the air, the vinegar is allowed\r\nto cool. It may then be drawn from the vat, introduced into barrels,\r\nrefined, and straightway delivered, fit for consumption. When the vat\r\nis quite emptied, and well cleaned, a new mixture is made of vinegar\r\nand wine, the little plant is sown as before, and the same facts are\r\nreproduced in the second as in the first operation.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the vessels where vinegar is preserved, whether in the\r\nmanufactories, in private houses, or in grocers' shops, it often\r\nhappens that the liquid becomes turbid, and impoverished in an\r\nextraordinary manner; it even ends in putrefaction, if a remedy be\r\nnot promptly applied. Pasteur has pointed out the cause of these\r\nphenomena. After the alcohol has become acetic acid by the combustive\r\naction of the mycoderm, the question remains, what becomes of the\r\nmycoderm? Most frequently it falls to the bottom of the vessel,\r\nhaving no more work to accomplish. This is a phase of the manufacture\r\nwhich must be watched with care. It is shown by the experiments of\r\nPasteur that the mycoderma aceti can live on vinegar already formed,\r\nmaintaining its power of fixing the oxygen on certain constituents of\r\nthe liquid. In this case the acetic acid itself is the seat of the\r\nchemical action--in other words, the oxygen unites with the carbon\r\nof the acetic acid, and transforms it into carbonic acid, and as the\r\nacetic acid has a composition which can be represented by carbon and\r\nwater, it follows that if the combustion is allowed to take its course,\r\ninstead of vinegar we have eventually nothing but water mixed with a\r\nsmall proportion of nitrogenous and mineral matters, and the remains\r\nof the mycoderm. We have thus an ordinary organic infusion exempt\r\nfrom all acidity, and one which could not be better fitted to become\r\nthe prey of the vibrios of putrefaction or of the aérobic mucors. By\r\nthese mucors, moreover, which form a film on the surface of the liquid\r\nafter the mycoderm has fallen, the anaérobic vibrios, protected from\r\nthe action of the air, can come into active existence. Here we find\r\nourselves in presence of one of those double phenomena, of putrefaction\r\nin the deeper parts of the liquid, and of combustion at the surface\r\nwhich is in contact with the air. Nothing is more prejudicial to the\r\nquality of the vinegar than the setting in of this combustion after\r\nthe vinegar has been formed, and when it contains no more alcohol. The\r\nfirst materials of the vinegar upon which the oxygen transmitted by the\r\nmycoderm fixes are, in fact, the ethereal and aromatic constituents\r\nwhich give to vinegar its chief value.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the deterioration of the quality of vinegar, which is\r\nsometimes very annoying to the manufacturer, consists in the frequent\r\npresence of little eel-like organisms, very curious when viewed with a\r\nstrong magnifier. Their bodies are so transparent that their internal\r\norgans can be easily distinguished. These eel-like creatures multiply\r\nwith extraordinary rapidity. Certainly there is not a single barrel\r\nof vinegar manufactured by the Orleans system which does not contain\r\nthem in alarming numbers. Prior to Pasteur's investigations, the\r\nignorance regarding these organisms was such that they were actually\r\nconsidered necessary to the production of the vinegar; whereas they\r\nare, on the contrary, most inimical to it, and must, if possible, be\r\ngot rid of. This is, moreover, rendered desirable by the repugnance\r\nwhich is naturally felt to using a liquid defiled by the presence of\r\nsuch animalcules--a repugnance which becomes almost insurmountable to\r\nanyone who has once seen through a microscope the swarms contained\r\nin a drop of vinegar. The mischief wrought by these little beings in\r\nthe manufacture of vinegar results from the fact that they require\r\nair to live. The effect can easily be perceived by filling to the\r\nbrim a bottle of vinegar, corking it, and then comparing it with a\r\nsimilar bottle half filled with the same vinegar, and left uncorked in\r\ncontact with the air. In the first bottle, the motions of the eel-like\r\ncreatures become gradually slower, until after a few days they cease to\r\nmultiply and fall lifeless to the bottom of the vessel. In the second\r\nbottle, on the contrary, they continue to swarm and move about. This\r\nneed of oxygen is further demonstrated by the fact that, if the vinegar\r\nreaches a certain depth in the bottle, life is suspended in the lower\r\nparts, and the little eel-like organisms, in order to breathe more\r\nfreely, form a crawling zone in the upper layers of the liquid.\r\n\r\nConnecting these observations with the other fact that the vinegar\r\nis formed by the action of the mycodermic film on its surface, we can\r\nunderstand at once that the mycoderm and the little eels continually\r\ncarry on a struggle for existence, since both of these living\r\nthings--the one animal the other vegetable--imperiously demand the same\r\naliment, oxygen. They live, moreover, in the same superficial layers, a\r\ncircumstance which gives rise to very curious phenomena. When, for one\r\nreason or another, the film of mycoderm is not formed, or when there\r\nis any delay in its production, the little eels invade in such great\r\nnumbers the upper layers of the liquid that they absorb all the oxygen.\r\nThe little plant has in consequence great difficulty in developing\r\nitself or even in beginning its life. Reciprocally, when the work of\r\nacetification is active, and when the mycoderm has occupied the upper\r\nlayers, it gradually drives away the eels, which take refuge, not deep\r\ndown, where they would perish, but against the moist sides of the\r\nbarrel or the vat. There they form a thick whitish scum all in motion.\r\nIt is a very curious spectacle. Here their enemy, the mycoderm, can no\r\nlonger injure them to the same extent, since they are surrounded with\r\nair; and here they wait with impatience for the moment when they can\r\nagain take their place in the liquid, and, in their turn, fight against\r\nthe mycoderm. In Pasteur's process, where the vats are very often\r\ncleansed, it is easy to keep them free from these little animalcules;\r\nthey have not time to multiply to a hurtful extent. Indeed, if the\r\noperation be well conducted, they do not make their appearance at all.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNearly all Pasteur's publications have had from the moment of their\r\nappearance to undergo the severest criticism. Their novelty caused\r\nthem to clash with the prejudices and errors current in science. His\r\nresearches on fermentation provoked lively opposition. Liebig did not\r\naccept without recrimination a series of researches which concurred in\r\nupsetting the theory he had enunciated and defended in all his works.\r\nAfter having kept silence for ten years, he published, at Munich, where\r\nhe was professor, a long memoir entirely directed against Pasteur's\r\nresults. In 1870, on the eve of the war, Pasteur, who was at that time\r\nreturning from a scientific journey into Austria, determined to pass\r\nby Munich, with the view of attempting to convince his distinguished\r\nadversary. Liebig received him with great courtesy, but, hardly\r\nrecovered from an illness, he alleged his convalescence as a reason for\r\ndeclining all discussion.\r\n\r\nThen followed the Franco-German war. Hardly was it terminated when\r\nPasteur brought before the Academy of Sciences at Paris a defence\r\nof what he had published, as a sort of challenge to his illustrious\r\nopponent. The memoir of Liebig was filled with the most skilful\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n'I pondered it for nearly ten years before producing it,' he wrote.\r\nPasteur, putting aside all subtleties of argument, went straight to\r\nthe two objections of the German chemist which lay at the root of the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that one of the most decisive proofs by which\r\nPasteur overthrew Liebig's theory resulted from the experiments in\r\nwhich by the aid of mineral bodies and fermentable matter he produced\r\na special living ferment for each definite fermentation. By removing\r\nall nitrogenous organic matter, which in Liebig's theory constitutes\r\nthe ferment, Pasteur established, at one and the same time, the life\r\nof the ferment and the absence of all action of albuminoid matter in\r\nprocess of alteration. Liebig here formally contested the fact that\r\nPasteur had been able to produce yeast and alcoholic fermentation in a\r\nsweetened mineral medium by sowing therein an infinitesimal quantity of\r\nyeast. It is certain that, ten years previously, when Pasteur announced\r\nthe production of yeast life and alcoholic fermentation under such\r\nconditions, his experiment was one so difficult to perform that it\r\nsometimes happened to Pasteur himself to be unable to reproduce it. The\r\ncells of yeast sown in the sweetened mineral medium found themselves\r\noften associated with other microscopic organisms, which were\r\nsingularly hurtful to the life of the yeast. Pasteur was at this period\r\nfar from being familiarised with the delicacy which such experiments\r\nrequire, and he did not yet know all the precautions indicated later\r\non, which were indispensable to success. Though in his original memoir\r\nof 1860 Pasteur had pointed out the difficulties of his experiment,\r\nthese difficulties existed nevertheless. Liebig took hold of them\r\nwith skill, exaggerated them; saw, so to speak, nothing but them; and\r\ndeclared that the results announced never could have been obtained. But\r\nin 1871 the fundamental experiment of Pasteur, on the life of yeast\r\nin a sweetened mineral medium, had become a trifle for him. He knew\r\nexactly how to form media deprived of all foreign germs, how to prepare\r\npure yeast, and how to prevent the introduction of new germs, which\r\ncould develop in the liquids and hinder the life of the yeast.\r\n\r\n'Choose,' said he to Liebig, 'from the members of the Academy one or\r\nseveral, and ask them to decide between you and me. I am ready to\r\nprepare before you and before them, in a sweetened mineral medium, as\r\nmuch yeast as you can reasonably ask for, and with substances provided\r\nby yourself.'\r\n\r\nLiebig's second objection had reference to acetic fermentation. The\r\nprocess of acetification known as that of 'beech shavings' is widely\r\npractised in Germany and even in France. It consists in causing alcohol\r\ndiluted with water and with the addition of some _millièmes_ of acetic\r\nacid to trickle slowly into barrels or vats filled with shavings of\r\nbeech, either massed together without order or disposed in layers\r\nafter having been rolled up like the spring of a watch. Openings\r\nformed in the sides of the barrel, and in a double bottom upon which\r\nthe shavings rest, permit the access of the air, which rises into the\r\nbarrel as it would in a chimney, and yields all or part of its oxygen\r\nto the alcohol to convert it into acetic acid. All writers prior to\r\nPasteur, and Liebig in particular, maintained that the shavings acted\r\nlike porous bodies in the same manner as finely divided platinum. The\r\nacetic acid, they said, was formed by a direct oxidation, without any\r\nother influence than the porosity of the wood. This view of the subject\r\nwas rendered plausible by the fact that in many manufactories the\r\nalcohol employed is that of distillation, which contains no albuminoid\r\nsubstances. Moreover, the duration of the shavings is in a sense\r\nindefinite.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pasteur, the shavings perform only a passive part in\r\nthe manufacture. They promote the division of the liquid and cause\r\na considerable augmentation of the surface exposed to the air. They\r\nmoreover serve as a support for the ferment, which is still, according\r\nto him, the mycoderma aceti, under the mucous form proper to it when\r\nsubmerged.\r\n\r\nCertainly appearances were far from being favourable to this view.\r\nWhen the shavings of a barrel which has been in work for several\r\nmonths or even for several years are examined, they are found to be\r\nextraordinarily clean. It might be said that they had just been\r\ncarefully washed. Pasteur has shown that this is but a deceptive\r\nappearance, and that in reality these shavings are partly or wholly\r\ncovered with a mucous film of mycoderma aceti of excessive tenuity.\r\nIt is necessary to scrape the surface of the wood with a scalpel and\r\nexamine the scrapings with the microscope to be assured of the presence\r\nof this pellicle.\r\n\r\nLiebig, who somewhere speaks, not without a certain contempt, of the\r\nmicroscope, denied formally the exactitude of these assertions.\r\n\r\n'With diluted alcohol, which is used for the rapid manufacture of\r\nvinegar,' he wrote, 'the elements of nutrition of the mycoderm are\r\nexcluded, and the vinegar is made without its intervention.' He\r\nasserted also in his memoir of 1869 that he had consulted the head of\r\none of the principal manufactories of vinegar in Germany, that in this\r\nmanufactory the diluted alcohol did not receive during the whole course\r\nof its transformation any foreign addition, and that beyond the air and\r\nthe surfaces of wood and charcoal--for charcoal is sometimes associated\r\nwith the beech shavings--nothing can act upon the alcohol. Liebig added\r\nthat the director of the manufactory did not believe at all in the\r\npresence of the mycoderm, and that finally he, Liebig, in examining the\r\nshavings which had been used for twenty-five years in the manufactory,\r\nsaw no trace of mycoderm on their surface.\r\n\r\nThe argument appeared conclusive. How, in fact, could we understand the\r\nproduction of a plant containing within itself nitrogen and mineral\r\nelements which was nevertheless to be nourished by water and alcohol.\r\n\r\n'You do not take into account,' replied Pasteur, 'the nature of the\r\nwater which serves to dilute your alcohol. This water, like all\r\nordinary waters, even the purest, contains salts of ammonia and mineral\r\nmatters which are capable of nourishing the plant. Finally, you have\r\nnot rightly examined with the microscope the surface of the shavings,\r\notherwise you would have seen the little particles of the mycoderma\r\naceti united, in some cases, to a thin film which can even be lifted\r\nup. I propose to you, moreover, to send to the Academic Commission\r\ncharged with the decision of the debate, some shavings that you have\r\nobtained yourself in the manufactory at Munich, and in the presence\r\nof its director. I will undertake to prove before the members of\r\nthe commission the presence of the mycoderm on the surface of these\r\nshavings.'\r\n\r\nLiebig did not accept this challenge. To-day the question is decided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               _THE QUESTION OF SPONTANEOUS GENERATION._\r\n\r\n\r\n'All dry bodies,' said Aristotle, 'which become damp, and all damp\r\nbodies which are dried, engender animal life.' Bees, according to\r\nVirgil, are produced from the corrupted entrails of a young bull. At\r\nthe time of Louis XIV. we were hardly more advanced. A celebrated\r\nalchemist doctor, Van Helmont, wrote: 'The smells which rise from the\r\nbottom of morasses produce frogs, slugs, leeches, grasses, and other\r\nthings.' But most extraordinary of all was the true recipe given by Van\r\nHelmont for producing a pot of mice. It suffices to press a dirty shirt\r\ninto the orifice of a vessel containing a little corn. After about\r\ntwenty-one days, the ferment proceeding from the dirty shirt modified\r\nby the odour of the corn effects the transmutation of the wheat into\r\nmice. Van Helmont, who asserted that he had witnessed the fact, added\r\nwith assurance:\r\n\r\n'The mice are born full grown; there are both males and females. To\r\nreproduce the species it suffices to pair them.'\r\n\r\n'Scoop out a hole,' said he again, 'in a brick, put into it some sweet\r\nbasil, crushed, lay a second brick upon the first so that the hole may\r\nbe perfectly covered. Expose the two bricks to the sun, and at the\r\nend of a few days the smell of the sweet basil, acting as a ferment,\r\nwill change the herb into real scorpions. An Italian naturalist, Redi,\r\nwas the first to subject this question of spontaneous generation to\r\na more attentive examination. He showed that maggots in meat are not\r\nspontaneously generated, but that they are the larvæ of flies' eggs.\r\nTo prevent the production of maggots, Redi showed that it was only\r\nnecessary to surround the meat with fine gauze before exposing it to\r\nthe air. As no flies could alight upon meat thus protected, there were\r\nno eggs deposited, and consequently neither larvæ nor maggots. But at\r\nthe moment when the doctrine of spontaneous generation began to lose\r\nground by the limitation of its domain, the discovery of the microscope\r\nbrought to this doctrine new and formidable support. In presence of\r\nthe world of animalculæ, the partisans of spontaneous generation\r\nraised a note of triumph. 'We may have been mistaken,' they said, 'as\r\nto the origin of mice and maggots, but is it possible to believe that\r\nmicroscopic organisms are not the outcome of spontaneous generation?\r\nHow can we otherwise explain their presence and rapid multiplication\r\nin all dead animal or vegetable matter in process of decomposition?'\r\n\r\nBuffon lent the authority of his name to the doctrine of spontaneous\r\ngeneration. He even devised a system to explain this hypothesis. In\r\n1745 two ecclesiastics entered upon an eager controversy for and\r\nagainst this question. While the English Catholic priest Needham\r\nadopted the theory of spontaneous generation, the Italian priest\r\nSpallanzani energetically opposed it; but while in the eyes of the\r\npublic the Italian remained master of the dispute, his success was more\r\napparent than real, more in word than in deed.\r\n\r\nThe problem was again brought forward in a more emphatic manner in\r\n1858. M. Pouchet, director of the Museum of Natural History at Rouen,\r\nin addressing the Academy of Sciences, declared that he had succeeded\r\nin demonstrating in a manner absolutely certain the existence of\r\nmicroscopic living organisms, which had come into the world without\r\ngerms, and consequently without parents similar to themselves.\r\n\r\nHow came Pasteur to throw himself into this discussion, at first\r\nsight so far removed from his other occupations? The results of his\r\nresearches on fermentation led him to it as a sort of duty. He was\r\ncarried on by a series of logical deductions. Let us recall to mind,\r\nfor example, the experiment in which Pasteur exposed to the heat of the\r\nsun water sweetened with sugar and mixed with phosphates of potash\r\nand magnesia, a little sulphate of ammonia, and some carbonate of\r\nlime. In these conditions the lactic fermentation was often seen to\r\ndevelop itself--that is to say, the sugar became lactic acid, which\r\ncombined with the lime of the carbonate to form lactate of lime. This\r\nsalt crystallises in long needles, and ends sometimes by filling the\r\nwhole vase, while a little organised living thing is at the same time\r\nproduced and multiplied. If the experiment is carried on further,\r\nanother fermentation generally succeeds to this one. Moving vibrios\r\nmake their appearance and multiply, the lactate of lime disappears, the\r\nfluidity returns to the mass, and the lactate finds itself replaced\r\nby butyrate of lime. What a succession of strange phenomena! How did\r\nlife appear in this sweetened medium, composed originally of such\r\nsimple elements, and apparently so far removed from all production of\r\nlife? This lactic ferment, these butyric vibrios, whence do they come?\r\nAre they formed of themselves? or are they produced by germs? If the\r\nlatter, whence do the germs come? The appearance of living organised\r\nferments had become for Pasteur the all-important question, since in\r\nall fermentations he had observed a correlation between the chemical\r\naction set up and the presence of microscopic organisms. Prior to the\r\nestablishment of the facts already mentioned, these difficulties did\r\nnot exist. The theory of Liebig was universally accepted.\r\n\r\nThus the question as to the origin of microscopic organisms and the\r\npart played by them in fermentation was imposed as a necessity on\r\nPasteur. He could not proceed further in his researches without having\r\nsolved this question.\r\n\r\nIn the month of October, 1857, Pasteur was called to Paris. After\r\nhaving been made dean at an incredibly early age, he was now, at the\r\nage of thirty-five, entrusted with the scientific studies at the École\r\nNormale Supérieure. But if the position was flattering, it did not\r\ngive to Pasteur what he most desired. As he had no Professor's chair,\r\nhe had no laboratory. In those days science, and the higher education\r\nin science, were at a discount. It was the period when Claude Bernard\r\nlived in a small damp laboratory, when M. Berthelot, though known\r\nthrough his great labours, was still nothing more than an assistant in\r\nthe Collège de France.\r\n\r\nAt the time here referred to, the Minister of Public Instruction said\r\nto Pasteur, 'There is no clause in the budget to grant you 1,500\r\nfrancs a year to defray the expense of experiments.' Pasteur did not\r\nhesitate to establish a laboratory at his own expense in one of the\r\ngarrets of the École Normale. We can readily imagine the modesty of\r\nsuch an establishment in such a place. Dividing his time between his\r\nprofessional duties and his laboratory experiments, Pasteur never went\r\nout but to talk over his daily researches with M. Biot, M. Dumas,\r\nM. de Senarmont, and M. Balard. M. Biot especially was his habitual\r\nconfidant. The day when M. Biot learned that Pasteur proposed to study\r\nthe obscure question of spontaneous generation, he strongly dissuaded\r\nhim from entangling himself in this labyrinth. 'You will never escape\r\nfrom it,' said he, 'you will only lose your time;' and when Pasteur\r\nattempted some timid observations with the view of showing that in\r\nthe order of his studies it was indispensable for him to attack this\r\nproblem, M. Biot grew angry. Although endowed, as Sainte-Beuve has\r\nsaid, with all the qualities of curiosity, of subtlety, of penetration,\r\nof ingenious exactitude, of method, and of perspicuity, with all the\r\nqualities, in short, essential and secondary, M. Biot treated the\r\nproject of Pasteur as a presumptuous adventure.\r\n\r\nBolder than M. Biot, but with a circumspection always alive, M. Dumas\r\ndeclared to Pasteur, without, however, further insisting upon the\r\npoint, that he would not advise anyone to occupy himself too long with\r\nsuch a subject. M. de Senarmont alone took the part of Pasteur, and\r\nsaid to M. Biot:\r\n\r\n'Let Pasteur alone. If there is nothing to be found in the path which\r\nhe has entered upon, do not be alarmed, he will not continue in it.\r\nBut,' added he, 'I should be surprised if he found nothing in it.'\r\n\r\nM. Pouchet had previously stated the problem with precision:\r\n\r\n'The opponents of spontaneous generation assert that the germs of\r\nmicroscopic organisms exist in the air, which transports them to a\r\ndistance. What, then, will these opponents say if I succeed in inducing\r\nthe generation of living organisms, while substituting artificial air\r\nfor that of the atmosphere?'\r\n\r\nPouchet then devised this ingenious experiment. He filled a bottle\r\nwith boiling water, hermetically sealed it with the greatest care, and\r\nplunged it upside down into a basin of mercury. When the water was\r\nquite cold he uncorked the bottle under the metal, and introduced into\r\nit half a litre of pure oxygen gas, which is as necessary to the life\r\nof the smallest microscopic organism as it is to that of the larger\r\nanimals and vegetables. Up to this time there was nothing in the vessel\r\nbut pure water and oxygen. Pouchet then introduced a minute bunch of\r\nhay which had been enclosed in a corked bottle, and exposed in a stove\r\nfor a long time to a temperature of more than 100 degrees. At the end\r\nof eight days a mouldiness was developed in this infusion of hay.\r\n'Where does this come from?' cried M. Pouchet triumphantly. Certainly\r\nnot from the oxygen, which had been prepared from a chemical compound\r\nat the temperature of incandescence. The water had been equally\r\ndeprived of germs, since at the boiling temperature all germs would\r\nhave been destroyed. The hay also could not have contained them, for it\r\nhad been taken from a stove heated to 100 degrees. As it was urged,\r\nhowever, that certain organisms could resist this temperature, M.\r\nPouchet heated the hay from 200 to 300 degrees, or to any temperature\r\nthat might be desired.\r\n\r\nPasteur came to disturb the triumph of M. Pouchet.\r\n\r\nIn a lecture which he gave at the Sorbonne in 1864, before a large\r\nassembly composed of savants, philosophers, ladies, priests, and\r\nnovelists--Alexandre Dumas was in the first row--all showing eager\r\ninterest in the problems to be dealt with in the lecture, Pasteur\r\nthus criticised the experiment of Pouchet: 'This experiment is\r\nirreproachable, but irreproachable only on those points which have\r\nattracted the attention of its author. I will demonstrate before you\r\nthat there is a cause of error which M. Pouchet has not perceived,\r\nwhich he has not in the least suspected, which no one before him\r\nsuspected, but which renders his experiment as completely illusory as\r\nthat of Van Helmont's pot of dirty linen. I will show you where the\r\nmice got in. I will prove to you, in short, that it is the mercury\r\nwhich carries the germs into the vessels, or, rather, not to go beyond\r\nthe demonstrated fact, the dust which is suspended in the air.'\r\n\r\nTo render visible this floating dust, Pasteur caused the hall to\r\nbe darkened, and pierced the obscurity by a beam of light. There\r\nthen appeared, dancing and twirling in the beam, thousands of little\r\nparticles of dust.\r\n\r\n'If we had time to examine them well,' continued Pasteur, 'we should\r\nsee them, though agitated with various movements, falling downwards\r\nmore or less quickly. It is thus that all objects become covered with\r\ndust--the furniture, the table, the mercury in this basin. Since this\r\nmercury was taken from the mine, how much dust must have fallen upon\r\nit, to say nothing of all that has been intimately mixed up with it\r\nduring the numerous manipulations to which it has been subjected in the\r\nlaboratory? It is not possible to touch this mercury, to place the hand\r\nin it, or a bottle, without introducing into the interior of the basin\r\nthe dust which lies on its surface. You will now see what takes place.'\r\n\r\nProjecting, in the darkness, the beam of light upon the basin of\r\nmercury, the liquid metal shone forth with its usual brilliancy.\r\nPasteur then sprinkled some dust upon the mercury, and, plunging a\r\nglass rod into it, the dust was seen to travel towards the spot where\r\nthe rod entered the mercury, and to penetrate into the space between\r\nthe glass and the metal.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' exclaimed Pasteur with a voice which gave evidence of the\r\nsincerity of his conviction, 'yes, M. Pouchet had removed the germs\r\nfrom the water and from the hay, but he had neglected to remove the\r\ndust from the surface of the mercury. This is the cause of his error;\r\nthis is what has vitiated his whole arrangement.'\r\n\r\nPasteur then instituted experiments exactly similar to those of\r\nPouchet, but taking care to remove every cause of error which had\r\nescaped the latter. He employed a glass bulb with a long neck, which\r\nhe bent, and connected with a tube of platinum placed in a furnace, so\r\nthat it could be heated nearly to redness. In the bulb he placed some\r\nvery putrescible liquids--urine for example. When the furnace which\r\nsurrounded the platinum tube was in action, Pasteur boiled the liquid\r\nfor some minutes, then he allowed it to cool, keeping the fire around\r\nthe platinum tube still active. During the cooling of the bulb the\r\nexternal air was introduced, after having first travelled through the\r\nred-hot platinum tube. The liquid was thus placed in contact with air\r\nwhose suspended germs were all burnt up.\r\n\r\nIn an experiment thus carried out, the urine remains unchanged--it\r\nundergoes only a very slight oxidation, which darkens its colour a\r\nlittle--but it exhibits no kind of putrefaction. If it be desired\r\nto repeat this experiment with alkaline liquids, such as milk, the\r\ntemperature must be raised a little above the boiling point--a\r\ncondition easily realised with the apparatus just described. It is\r\nonly necessary to connect with the free extremity of the platinum\r\ntube a glass tube bent at right angles, and to plunge the latter\r\nto a depth of some centimeters into a basin of mercury. In these\r\ncircumstances ebullition goes on under a pressure greater than that of\r\nthe atmosphere, consequently at a temperature higher than 100 degrees\r\nCentigrade.\r\n\r\nIt remained, however, to be proved that the floating dust of the air\r\nembraces the germs of the lower organisms. Through a tube stopped with\r\ncotton wool, Pasteur, by means of an aspirator, drew ordinary air.\r\nIn passing through the wool it was filtered, depositing therein all\r\nits dust. Taking a watch-glass, Pasteur placed on it a drop of water\r\nin which he steeped the cotton wool stopper and squeezed out of it,\r\nupon a glass slide, a drop of water which contained a portion of the\r\nintercepted dust. He repeated this process until he had extracted from\r\nthe cotton nearly all the intercepted dust. The operation is simple\r\nand easily executed. Placing the glass slide with a little of the\r\nsoiled liquid under a microscope, we can distinguish particles of soot,\r\nfragments of silk, scraps of wool, or of cotton. But, in the midst of\r\nthis inanimate dust, living particles make their appearance--that is\r\nto say, organisms belonging to the animal or vegetable kingdom, eggs\r\nof infusoria, and spores of cryptogams. Germs, animalculæ, flakes of\r\nmildew, float in the atmosphere, ready to fall into any appropriate\r\nmedium, and to develop themselves at a prodigious rate.\r\n\r\nBut are these apparently organised particles which are found thus\r\nassociated with amorphous dust indeed the germs of microscopic living\r\nbeings? Granting the experiment devised by Pasteur to verify that\r\nof Pouchet to be irreproachable, is Pasteur's interpretation of it\r\nrigorously true? In presence of the problem of the origin of life,\r\nall hypotheses are possible as long as the truth has not been clearly\r\nrevealed. Truly, it might be argued, if fermentation be caused by\r\ngerms, then the air which has passed through a red-hot platinum tube\r\ncannot provoke fermentation, or putrefaction, or the formation of\r\norganisms, because the germs of these last, which were suspended in the\r\nair, have lost all vitality. But what right have you to speak of germs?\r\nHow do you know that the previous existence of germs is necessary to\r\nthe appearance and development of microscopic organisms? May not the\r\nprime mover of the life of microscopic organisms be some appropriate\r\nmedium started into activity by magnetism, electricity, or even ozone?\r\nNow, by the passing of the air through your red-hot platinum tube these\r\nactive powers are destroyed, and the sterility of your bulb of urine\r\nhas nothing surprising in it.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of spontaneous generation had often employed this\r\napparently formidable reasoning, and Pasteur thought it necessary to\r\nstrengthen the proof that the cotton wool through which his air had\r\nfiltered was really charged with germs.\r\n\r\nBy an ingenious method he sowed the contents of the cotton wool in the\r\nsame liquids that had been rendered sterile by boiling. The liquids\r\nbecame fertile, even more fertile than if they had been exposed to\r\nthe free contact of atmospheric air. Now, what was there in the dust\r\ncontained in the cotton wool? Only amorphous particles of silk,\r\ncotton, starch; and, along with these, minute bodies which, by their\r\ntransparency and their structure, were not to be distinguished from the\r\ngerms of microscopic organisms. The presence of imponderable fluids\r\ncould not here be pleaded.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, fearing that determined scepticism might still attribute\r\nto the cotton wool an influence of some sort on account of its being\r\nan organised substance, Pasteur substituted for the stoppers of cotton\r\nwool stoppers of asbestos previously heated to redness. The result was\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWishing still further to dispose of the hypothesis that, in ordinary\r\nair, an unknown something existed which, independent of germs, might be\r\nthe cause of the observed microscopic life, Pasteur began a new series\r\nof experiments as simple as they were demonstrative. Having placed a\r\nvery putrescible infusion--in other words, one very appropriate to\r\nthe appearance of microscopic organisms--in a glass bulb with a long\r\nneck, by means of the blowpipe, he drew out this neck to a very small\r\ndiameter, at the same time bending the soft glass to and fro, so as\r\nto form a sinuous tube. The extremity of this narrow tube remained\r\nopen. He then boiled his liquid for some minutes until the vapour of\r\nthe water came out in abundance through the narrow open tube. In these\r\nconditions the liquid in the bulb, however putrescible, is preserved\r\nindefinitely without the least alteration. One may handle it, transport\r\nit from place to place, expose it to every variety of climate, place\r\nit in a stove with a temperature of thirty or forty degrees, the\r\nliquid remains as clear as it was at first. A slight oxidation of the\r\nconstituents of the liquid, is barely perceptible. In this experiment\r\nthe ordinary air, entering suddenly at the first moment, finds in the\r\nbulb a liquid very near the boiling temperature; and when the liquid\r\nis so far cooled that it can no longer destroy the vitality of the\r\ngerms, the entrance of the air is correspondingly retarded, so that the\r\ngerms capable of acting upon the liquid, and of producing in it living\r\norganisms, are deposited in the bends of the still moist tube, not\r\ncoming into contact with the liquid at all.\r\n\r\nIf, after remaining for weeks, months, or even years, in a heated\r\nchamber, the sinuous neck of the bulb is snipped off by a file in the\r\nvertical part of the stem, after twenty-four or forty-eight hours there\r\nbegin to appear mildew, mucors, bacteria, infusoria, exactly as in the\r\ncase of infusions recently exposed to the contact of ordinary air.\r\n\r\nThe same experiments may be repeated with slightly alkaline liquids,\r\nsuch as milk, the precaution being taken of raising them to a\r\ntemperature higher than that of 100 degrees Centigrade.\r\n\r\nThe great interest of Pasteur's method consists in its proving\r\nunanswerably that the origin of life, in infusions which have been\r\nheated to the boiling point, is solely due to the solid particles\r\nsuspended in the air. Of gas, electricity, magnetism, ozone, things\r\nknown or unknown, there is nothing in ordinary atmospheric air which,\r\napart from these solid particles, can cause the fermentation or\r\nputrefaction of the infusions.\r\n\r\nLastly, to convince the most prejudiced minds, and to leave no\r\ncontradiction standing, Pasteur showed one of these bulbs with the\r\nsinuous neck which he had prepared and preserved for months and years.\r\nThe bulb was covered with dust. 'Let us,' said he, 'take up a little\r\nof this outside dust on a bit of glass, porcelain, or platinum, and\r\nintroduce it into the liquid; the following day you will find that the\r\ninfusion, which up to this time remained perfectly clear, has become\r\nturbid, and that it behaves in the same manner as other infusions in\r\ncontact with ordinary air.'\r\n\r\nIf the bulb be tilted so as to cause a little drop of the clear\r\ninfusion to reach the extremity of the bent part of the neck where\r\nthe dust particles are arrested, and if this drop be then allowed to\r\ntrickle back into the infusion, the result is the same--turbidity\r\nsupervenes and the microscopic organisms are developed. Finally, if one\r\nof those bulbs which have stood the test of months and years without\r\nalteration be several times shaken violently, so that the external air\r\nshall rush into it, and if it be then placed once more in the stove,\r\nlife will soon appear in it.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the Academy of Sciences had offered a prize, the conditions of\r\nwhich were stated in the following terms:\r\n\r\n'To endeavour by well-contrived experiments to throw new light upon the\r\nquestion of spontaneous generation.' The Academy added that it demanded\r\nprecise and rigorous experiments equally well studied on all sides;\r\nsuch experiments, in short, as should render it possible to deduce from\r\nthem results free from all confusion due to the experiments themselves.\r\nPasteur carried away the prize, and no one, it will be acknowledged,\r\ndeserved it better than he. Nevertheless, to his eyes, the subject was\r\nstill beset with difficulties. In the hot discussions to which the\r\nquestion of spontaneous generation gave rise, the partisans of the\r\ndoctrine continually brought forward an objection based on an opinion\r\nalready referred to, and first enunciated by Gay-Lussac. As already\r\nknown to the reader, Gay-Lussac had arrived at the conclusion that,\r\nin Appert's process, one condition of the preservation of animal and\r\nvegetable substances consisted in the exclusion of oxygen.\r\n\r\nEven this proposition was soon improved upon, and it became a current\r\nopinion in science that the smallest bubble of oxygen or of air which\r\nmight come in contact with a preserve would be sufficient to start\r\nits decomposition. The partisans of spontaneous generation--the\r\nheterogenists--thenceforward threw their objections to Pasteur into\r\nthis form:\r\n\r\n'How can the germs of microscopic organisms be so numerous that even\r\nthe smallest bubble of air contains germs capable of developing\r\nthemselves in every organic infusion? If such were the case the air\r\nwould be encumbered with organic germs.' M. Pouchet said and wrote that\r\nthey would form a thick fog, as dense as iron.\r\n\r\nBut Pasteur showed that the interpretation of Gay-Lussac's experiment,\r\nwith respect to the possible alteration of preserves by a small\r\nquantity of oxygen gas, was quite erroneous. If, after a certain time,\r\nan Appert preserve contains no oxygen, this is simply because the\r\noxygen has been gradually absorbed by the substances of the preserve,\r\nwhich are always more or less chemically oxidisable. But in reality\r\nit is easy to find oxygen in these preserves. Pasteur did not fail to\r\nperceive that the interpretation given to Gay-Lussac's experiment was\r\nwrong in another particular. He proved the fallacy of the assumption\r\nthat the smallest quantity of air was always capable of producing\r\nmicroscopic organisms.\r\n\r\nMore thickly spread in towns than in the country, the germs become\r\nfewer in proportion as they recede from human habitations. Mountains\r\nhave fewer than plains, and at a certain height they are very rare.\r\n\r\nPasteur's experiments to prove these facts were extremely simple. He\r\ntook a series of bulbs of about a quarter of a litre in capacity, and,\r\nafter having half filled the bulbs with a putrescible liquid, he drew\r\nout the necks by means of the blowpipe, then he caused the liquid to\r\nboil for some minutes, and during the ebullition, while the steam\r\nissued from the tapering ends of the bulbs, he sealed them with the\r\nlamp. Thus prepared, the bulbs can be easily transported. As they are\r\nempty of air--that which they originally contained having been driven\r\nout with the steam--when the sealed end of a bulb is broken off, the\r\nair rushes into the tube, carrying with it all the germs which this\r\nair holds in suspension. If it is closed again immediately afterwards\r\nby a flame, and if the vessels are then left to themselves, it is easy\r\nto recognise those in which a change occurs. Now, Pasteur established\r\nthat, in whatever place the operation might be carried on, a certain\r\nnumber of bulbs would escape alteration. They must not, however, be\r\nopened in a room after dusting the furniture or sweeping the floor, for\r\nin this case all the bulbs would become altered because of the great\r\nquantity of germs raised by the dusting and remaining suspended in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nPasteur started for Arbois with a series of bulbs. Some he opened in\r\nthe country far from all habitations; others he opened at the foot\r\nof the mountains which form the first range of the Jura; a series of\r\ntwenty-four bulbs was opened upon Mount Poupet, at 850 meters above the\r\nlevel of the sea; and, lastly, twenty others were transported to the\r\nMontanvert, near the Mer de Glace, at an elevation of 2,000 meters.\r\nHe afterwards brought his whole collection back to Paris, and in the\r\nmonth of November, 1860, deposited them on the table at the Academy of\r\nSciences.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty bulbs first opened in the country, eight contained\r\norganised productions. Of the twenty opened on the heights of the Jura,\r\nfive only were altered, and of the twenty opened upon the Montanvert\r\nduring a strong wind which blew from the glacier, one alone was altered.\r\n\r\nIf a similar series of experiments were made in a balloon, it would be\r\nfound that the air of the higher atmosphere is absolutely free from\r\ngerms. Care would, however, be necessary to prevent the introduction of\r\ndust particles, which the rigging and the aëronauts themselves might\r\ncarry with them.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet related all. So far, all these conclusive\r\nexperiments had been made only on organic liquids, very putrescible\r\nit is true, but which had all been subjected to boiling or even to\r\ntemperatures higher than 100 degrees Centigrade. The partisans of\r\nspontaneous generation might then be justified in saying that if the\r\nprecaution had been taken of putting into contact with pure air natural\r\norganic liquids in a state compatible with the operations of animal\r\nand vegetable life, the results would have been different. Under such\r\nconditions, life would have appeared spontaneously in the production of\r\nmicroscopic organisms. None of Pasteur's opponents had formulated this\r\nargument; but Pasteur himself, who had within him an adversary always\r\npresent, always on the alert, prepared to yield only to accumulated\r\nproofs, saw this objection. He was not satisfied until he had succeeded\r\nin completely refuting it. Having by means of ingenious experimental\r\narrangements deprived some air of all living germs, he placed in\r\ncontact with this pure air the most putrescible liquids, particularly\r\nvenous blood, arterial blood, and urine. He took these liquids directly\r\nfrom the veins, the arteries, and the bladders of animals in full\r\nhealth. No alteration was produced. In due time a chemical absorption\r\nof small quantities of oxygen took place, but neither fermentation nor\r\nputrefaction, nor the smallest development of bacteria, of vibrios, or\r\nof mould. After this, Pasteur was able legitimately to exclaim in his\r\ncelebrated lecture at the Sorbonne:\r\n\r\n'There is not one circumstance known at the present day which\r\njustifies the assertion that microscopic organisms come into the world\r\nwithout germs or without parents like themselves. Those who maintain\r\nthe contrary have been the dupes of illusions and of ill-conducted\r\nexperiments, tainted with errors which they know not how either to\r\nperceive or to avoid. Spontaneous generation is a chimera.'\r\n\r\nPasteur was not alone in affirming this fixed conviction. With the\r\nauthority of a judge delivering sentence in court, M. Flourens,\r\npermanent Secretary of the Academy of Sciences, pronounced these words\r\nbefore the whole Academy:\r\n\r\n'As long as my opinion was not formed I had nothing to say; now\r\nit _is_ formed and I can speak. The experiments are decisive. If\r\nspontaneous generation be a fact, what is necessary for the production\r\nof animalculæ? Air and putrescible liquids. Now Pasteur puts together\r\nair and putrescible liquids and nothing is produced. Spontaneous\r\ngeneration, then, has no existence. Those who still doubt have failed\r\nto grasp the question.'\r\n\r\nBut some adversaries remained incredulous. When Pasteur had announced\r\nthe result of his experiments, and brought before the Academy his\r\nseries of bulbs, Pouchet and Joly declared that if Pasteur had opened\r\nhis bulbs in the Jura and on the Mer de Glace, they, on their part, had\r\nbeen on the top of the Maladetta, and had proved there the inexactitude\r\nof Pasteur's results.\r\n\r\nPasteur asked to be judged by the Academy. 'A commission alone,' said\r\nhe, 'will terminate the debate.' The commission was named, and the\r\nposition on both sides was clearly stated.\r\n\r\n'I affirm,' said Pasteur, 'that everywhere it is possible to take\r\nfrom the midst of the atmosphere a certain quantity of air which\r\ncontains neither egg nor spore, and which does not produce organisms in\r\nputrescible solutions.'\r\n\r\nOn his side, M. Joly wrote: 'If one alone of your bulbs remains\r\nunaltered we shall loyally acknowledge our defeat.' Lastly, M.\r\nPouchet, as distinct and positive as M. Pasteur, said: 'I affirm that\r\nin whatever place I take a cubic decimeter of air, when this air\r\nis placed in contact with a fermentable liquid enclosed in a glass\r\nvessel hermetically sealed, the liquid will become filled with living\r\norganisms.'\r\n\r\nThis double declaration, which excited at that time all the learned\r\nworld, took place in the month of January, 1864. Eager to engage in the\r\ncombat, Pasteur waited impatiently for the order of the Commission that\r\nthis experiment, which was to decide everything, should be made. But M.\r\nPouchet begged for a postponement, desiring, he said, to wait for the\r\nwarm season. Pasteur was astonished, but resigned himself to the delay.\r\nThe Commission and the opponents met on June 15.\r\n\r\nThe Commission announced, 'that, as the whole dispute turned upon one\r\nsimple fact, one single experiment ought to be undertaken, which alone\r\nwould close the discussion.'\r\n\r\nThe partisans of spontaneous generation wished nevertheless to go\r\nthrough the entire series of their experiments. In vain the Commission\r\ntried to persuade them that this would make the judgment as long as the\r\ndiscussion itself had been, that all bore upon one fact, and that this\r\nfact could be decided by a single experiment. The heterogenists would\r\nnot listen to this. M. Pouchet and M. Joly withdrew from the contest.\r\n\r\nM. Jamin, an exact and authorised historian of these debates, observed\r\nthat 'the heterogenists, however they may have covered their retreat,\r\nwere thereby self-condemned. If they had been sure of the fact--which\r\nthey were solemnly engaged to prove, under penalty of acknowledging\r\nthemselves defeated--they would have hastened to demonstrate it, for\r\nit would have been the triumph of their doctrine. People do not allow\r\nthemselves to be condemned by default except in causes in which they\r\nhave no confidence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _STUDIES ON WINE._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus solved the problem of spontaneous generation, a problem\r\nwhich was but a parenthesis forced upon his attention, Pasteur\r\nreturned to fermentation. Guided by his studies on vinegar and other\r\nobservations of detail, he undertook an inquiry into the diseases of\r\nwine. The explanations of the changes which wine was known to undergo\r\nrested only on hypothesis. From the time of Chaptal, who was followed\r\nby Liebig and Berzelius, all the world believed wine to be a liquid\r\nin which the various constituents react upon each other mutually\r\nand slowly. The wine was thought to be continually 'working.' When\r\nthe fermentation of the grape is finished, equilibrium is not quite\r\nestablished between the diverse elements of the liquor. Time is needed\r\nfor them to blend together. If this reciprocal action be not regular,\r\nthe wine becomes bad. This was, in other words, the doctrine of\r\nspontaneity. Without support from carefully reasoned experiments, these\r\nexplanations could not satisfy Pasteur, especially at a moment when he\r\nhad just been proving that there was nothing spontaneous either in the\r\nphenomena of fermentation or in animal and vegetable infusions.\r\n\r\nPasteur tried first of all to show that wine does not 'work' as\r\nmuch as it was supposed to do. Wine being a mixture of different\r\nsubstances, among which are acids and alcohol, particular ethers are\r\nno doubt formed in it in course of time, and similar reactions perhaps\r\ntake place between the other constituents of the liquid. But if the\r\nexactitude of such facts cannot be denied, based as they are upon\r\ngeneral laws, confirmed and extended by recent inquiries, Pasteur\r\nthought that a false application was made of them when they were\r\nemployed to explain the maladies of wine, the changes which occur in\r\nit through age--in a word, the alterations, whether good or bad, which\r\nwines are subject to. The 'ageing' of wine soon appeared to him to\r\nconsist essentially in the phenomena of oxidation, due to the oxygen of\r\nthe air which dissolves and is diffused in the wine. He gave manifest\r\nproofs of this. I will only mention one of them. New wine inclosed\r\nin a glass vessel hermetically sealed keeps its freshness; it does\r\nnot 'work,' it does not 'age.' Pasteur demonstrated besides, that all\r\nthe processes of wine-making are explained by the double necessity\r\nof oxygenising the wine to a suitable degree, and of preventing\r\nits deterioration. In seeking for the actual causes of injurious\r\nalterations, Pasteur, always obedient to a preconceived idea, while\r\ncarefully controlling it with the utmost rigour of the experimental\r\nmethod, asked himself whether the diseases of wine did not proceed\r\nfrom organised ferments, from little microscopic vegetations? In the\r\nobserved alterations, he thought, there must be some influences at work\r\nforeign to the normal composition of the wine.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis was verified. In his hands the injurious modifications\r\nsuffered by wines were shown to be correlative with the presence and\r\nthe multiplication of microscopic vegetations. Such growths alter\r\nthe wine, either by subtracting from it what they need for their\r\nnourishment, or, and principally, by forming new products which are the\r\neffect of the multiplication of these parasites in the mass of the wine.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows what is meant by _acid wine_, _sharp wine_, _sour wine_.\r\nThe former experiments of Pasteur had clearly shown that no wine\r\ncan become acid, sharp--can, in a word, become vinegar--without the\r\npresence of a little microscopic fungus known by the name of _mycoderma\r\naceti_. This little plant is the necessary agent in the condensation\r\nof the oxygen of the air, and its fixation on the alcohol of the wine.\r\nChaptal, who published a volume on the art of wine-making, knew of the\r\nexistence of these mycoderm flowers; but to his eyes they were only\r\n'elementary forms of vegetation,' which had no influence whatever upon\r\nthe quality of the liquid. Besides the _mycoderma aceti_, which is the\r\nagent of acetification, there is another mycoderm called _mycoderma\r\nvini_. This one deposits nothing which is hurtful to the wine, and its\r\nflowers are developed by preference in new wines, still immature, and\r\npreserving the astringency of the first period of their fabrication.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the two sorts of flowers are such that even\r\nwhen the flower of vinegar is sown on the surface of a new wine, no\r\ndevelopment takes place. Conversely, the _mycoderma vini_ sown on wines\r\nthat have grown old in casks or in bottles will refuse to multiply. The\r\n_mycoderma vini_ produces no alteration in the wine; it does not turn\r\nthe wine acid. In proportion as the wine grows old the flower tends to\r\ndisappear, the wine 'despoils' itself, to use a technical expression;\r\nphysiologically speaking, the wine loses its aptitude to nourish the\r\n_mycoderma vini_, which, finding itself progressively deprived of\r\nappropriate nourishment, fades and withers. But it is then that the\r\n_mycoderma aceti_ appears, and multiplies with a facility so much the\r\ngreater that it draws its first nourishment from the cells of the\r\n_mycoderma vini_. The _mycoderma aceti_ has played so large a part in\r\nthe early pages of this book that it is not necessary to go back upon\r\nit here.\r\n\r\nThere is another disease very common among wines when the great heat\r\nof summer begins to make itself felt in the vintage tubs. The wine\r\nis said to _turn_, to _rise_, to _spurt_. The wine becomes slightly\r\nturbid and at the same time flat and piquant. When it is poured into a\r\nglass, very small bubbles of gas form like a crown upon the surface.\r\nOn placing the glass between the eye and the light and slightly\r\nshaking it, one can distinguish silky waves shifting about and moving\r\nin different directions in the liquid. When the _turned_ wine is in a\r\ncask, it is not unusual to see the bottom of the cask bulge a little\r\nand sometimes a leakage takes place at the joints of the staves. If a\r\nlittle opening is made, the wine spurts out, and that is the reason why\r\nthe wine is said to spurt.\r\n\r\nAuthors who have written on the subject of wine attributed this malady\r\nto the rising of the lees. They believed that the deposit which always\r\nexists in greater or less quantities in the lower part of the cask\r\nrises and spreads itself into all the mass of the wine.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more inexact. If this phenomenon is sometimes\r\nproduced--that is to say, if the deposit rises into the mass of\r\nwine--the effect is due to a sudden diminution of the atmospheric\r\npressure, as in times of storm, for example. As the wine is always\r\ncharged with carbonic acid gas, which it holds in solution from the\r\nmoment of fermentation, one can conceive that a lowering of barometric\r\npressure would cause the escape of some bubbles of carbonic acid.\r\nThese bubbles, rising from the lower part of the cask, may disturb a\r\nportion of the deposit, which then mixes with the wine and renders\r\nit turbid. But the real cause of the disease is quite different. The\r\nturbidity is without exception due to the presence of little filaments\r\nof an extreme tenuity, about a thousandth part of a millimeter in\r\ndiameter. Their length is very variable. It is these which, when the\r\nwine is agitated, give rise to the silky waves just referred to. Often\r\nthe deposit of the casks leaves a swarm of these filaments entangled\r\nin each other, forming a glutinous mass, which under the microscope is\r\nseen to be composed entirely of these little filaments. In acting upon\r\ncertain constituents of the wine particularly upon the tartar, this\r\nferment generates carbonic acid. The phenomenon of spurting is then\r\nproduced, because when the cask is closed the internal pressure of the\r\nliquid augments. The sparkling and the crown of little gas-bubbles,\r\nobserved when the turned wine is poured out into a glass, is similarly\r\nexplained. In a word, the disease of turned wine is nothing else than\r\na fermentation, due to an organised ferment which, without any doubt,\r\nproceeds originally from germs existing on the surface of the grapes\r\nat the moment of gathering them, or on spoilt grapes such as are found\r\nin every vintage. It is very rare not to find this parasite of turned\r\nwine in the deposit of the wine at the bottom of the casks, but the\r\nparasite is not troublesome unless it multiplies very largely. Pasteur\r\nfound the means of preventing this multiplication by a very simple\r\nremedy, equally applicable to other diseases of wines, such as that of\r\nbitterness or greasiness (_maladie de la graisse_).\r\n\r\nMany wines acquire with age a more or less bitter taste, sometimes to\r\na degree which renders them unfit for consumption. Red wines, without\r\nexception, are subject to this disease. It attacks by preference wines\r\nof the best growth, and particularly the finest wines of the Côte-d'Or.\r\nIt is once more a little filamented fungus which works the change;\r\nand not only does it cause in the wine a bitterness which little by\r\nlittle deprives it of all its better qualities, but it forms in the\r\nbottles a deposit which never adheres to the glass, but renders the\r\nwine muddy or turbid. It is in this deposit that the filaments of\r\nthe fungus float. If white wines do not suffer from this disease of\r\nbitterness, they are exposed, particularly the white wines of Orleans\r\nand of the basin of the Loire, to the disease of greasiness. The wines\r\nlose their limpidity; they become flat and insipid and viscous, like\r\noil when poured out. The disease declares itself in the casks or in the\r\nbest-corked bottles. M. Pasteur has discovered that the greasiness of\r\nwines is likewise produced by a special ferment, which the microscope\r\nshows to be formed of filaments, like the ferments of the preceding\r\ndiseases, but differing in structure from the other organisms, and in\r\ntheir physiological action on the wine.\r\n\r\nIn short, according to Pasteur's observations, the deterioration of\r\nwines should not in any case be attributed to a natural working of\r\nthe constituents of the wine, proceeding from a sort of interior\r\nspontaneous movement, which would only be affected by variations\r\nof temperature or atmospheric pressure. They are, on the contrary,\r\nexclusively dependent on the development of microscopic organisms,\r\nthe germs of which exist in the wine from the moment of the original\r\nfermentation which gave it birth. What vast multitudes of germs of\r\nevery kind must there not be introduced into every vintage tub! What\r\nmodifications do we not meet with in the leaves and in the fruit of\r\neach individual spoilt vine! How numerous are the varieties of organic\r\ndust to be found on the stems of the bunches, on the surface of the\r\ngrapes, on the implements of the grape gatherers! What varieties of\r\nmoulds and mildews! A vast proportion of these germs are evidently\r\nsterilised by the wine, whose composition, being at the same time acid,\r\nalcoholic, and devoid of air, is so little favourable to life. But is\r\nit to be wondered at that some of these exterior germs, so numerous,\r\nand possessing in a more or less marked degree the anaerobic character,\r\nshould find at certain moments, in the state of the wine, the right\r\nconditions for their existence and multiplication?\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cause of these alterations having been found, a mode of preventing\r\nthe development of all these parasites had still to be sought.\r\nPasteur's first endeavour was to discover some substance which would be\r\nantagonistic to the life of these ferments of disease, while harmless\r\nto the wine itself, and devoid of any special smell or taste. But\r\nin this research success was dependent on too many conditions to be\r\neasily attainable. After some fruitless trials, the thought occurred\r\nto Pasteur of having recourse to heat. He soon ascertained that, to\r\nsecure wine from all ulterior changes, it sufficed to raise it, for\r\nsome instants only, to a temperature of from fifty-five to sixty\r\ndegrees. His experiments were first directed upon the disease of\r\n'bitterness.' He procured some of the best wines of Burgundy, wines\r\nof Beaune, and of Pomard, of different years--1858, 1862, and 1863.\r\nTwenty-five bottles were left standing forty-eight hours to allow all\r\nthe particles suspended in the wine to settle; for, however clear wine\r\nmay be, it always produces a slight deposit. Pasteur then decanted the\r\nwine with minute care, by means of a syphon of slow delivery. This last\r\nprecaution was necessary to prevent the deposit from being stirred\r\nup. When there remained in each bottle only one cubic centimeter of\r\nliquid, Pasteur shook the bottle, and then examined with the microscope\r\nthe residue of each bottle. He perceived in each case distinct\r\nfilaments of ferment. The wines, however, were not in the least bitter\r\nto the taste, but the germs of a possible evil were there--an evil\r\nwhich would have been first detected by the palate when the little\r\nfungus had fully developed.\r\n\r\nWithout uncorking it, Pasteur then heated a bottle of each of these\r\nwines. The heating was carried to a temperature of sixty degrees (140°\r\nFahr.). After the cooling of the bottles he laid them by the side of\r\nother unheated bottles of the same wines in a cellar, the temperature\r\nof which varied in summer between thirteen and seventeen degrees. Every\r\nfifteen days Pasteur inspected them. Without uncorking the bottles,\r\nhe held them up against the light, so that he could see the sediment\r\nat the bottom of each bottle, and thus detect the least formation of\r\ndeposit. In less than six weeks, particularly in the wine of 1863, a\r\nvery perceptible floating deposit began to form in all the unheated\r\nbottles. These deposits gradually augmented, and on examining them with\r\nthe microscope they were seen to be formed of organised filaments,\r\nmixed sometimes with a little colouring matter which had become\r\ninsoluble. No deposit appeared in the heated bottles.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe idea of heating wines does not belong to Pasteur. Those who love\r\nto search into questions of priority will find described in the works\r\nof Latin agriculturists various methods for the preservation of wine,\r\nbased on the employment of heat. To give the wine durability, they\r\nsometimes added to the vintage variable quantities of boiled must,\r\nreduced to half or two thirds, in which orris, myrrh, cinnamon, white\r\nresin, and other ingredients, were infused. But, to cite examples\r\nnearer our own time, Appert, whose preserves have become so popular,\r\nrelates that he sent to St. Domingo some bottles of Beaune which had\r\nbeen previously heated to seventy degrees, and that he compared, on\r\ntheir return into France, two bottles of this wine with a bottle which\r\nhad remained at Havre, and also with other bottles of the same wine\r\nwhich had remained in his cellar, neither of which had undergone the\r\noperation of heating. The superiority of the wine which came from\r\nSt. Domingo, said Appert, was incontestable. Nothing could equal its\r\ndelicacy or its perfume. But Appert did not by any means describe the\r\nwine of the two bottles which remained in France as either injured\r\nor diseased. His remark was based upon an incomplete observation. It\r\nsimply stated the fact, which indeed was previously known, that a long\r\nvoyage, added to the employment of heat, had an excellent effect upon\r\nthe Beaune. This incident had been so completely forgotten, that it\r\nwas only in 1865 that Pasteur, during the historical researches which\r\npreceded his 'Etudes sur le vin,' accidentally met with this story\r\nof the bottles of St. Domingo, and hastened to communicate it to the\r\nAcademy. But in reference to this question of heating, a discussion\r\narose as to priority, which was quite unexpected by him. A Burgundian\r\nwine grower, M. de Vergnette, having first proposed the congealing of\r\nwines as a protective influence, had afterwards spoken, without much\r\nprecision, of heat as another means of preservation. On this ground he\r\nclaimed for himself a great part of the invention of Pasteur's process.\r\n'If, after having subjected some specimens of wines which are to be\r\nsent abroad to the ordeal of heating,' said M. de Vergnette, 'one\r\nsees that they have been able to resist the action of the heat, then\r\nthey may safely be shipped. In the contrary case they ought not to be\r\nsent.' According to M. de Vergnette, it was to the composition of the\r\nwine, its robust condition, and good constitution, that it owed its\r\npower of supporting the heating process. Pasteur had no difficulty in\r\ndemonstrating that these assertions are contradicted by experiment.\r\nWine never changes by the moderate application of heat when air is\r\nexcluded; and it is precisely when of doubtful soundness that it should\r\nbe subjected to the process of heating. This operation does not alter\r\nit any more than would be the case if it were in a perfectly healthy\r\nstate. All wines may undergo the action of heat without the least\r\ndeterioration, and one minute's heating at the proper temperature\r\nsuffices to insure the preservation of every kind of wine. Thanks to\r\nthis operation, the weakest wine, the most disposed to turn sour, to\r\nbecome greasy, or to be threatened with bitterness, is insured against\r\ninjurious change.\r\n\r\nNothing is more simple than to realise the condition of heating in\r\nbottles. After having firmly tied down the corks, the bottles are\r\nplaced in a water-bath. An iron basket is here useful. The water ought\r\nto rise up to the wire of the cork. Among these bottles is placed a\r\nbottle of water, into which the bulb of a thermometer is plunged. The\r\nbath being heated, as soon as the thermometer marks fifty or sixty\r\ndegrees Centigrade, the basket is withdrawn. The subsequent soundness\r\nof the wine is thus insured.\r\n\r\nBut if Pasteur had overlooked nothing in his efforts to prevent or\r\narrest the evil changes of wine, he still saw that full confidence\r\nwas not felt in the efficacy of a process which must, it was thought,\r\ndamage the taste, or the colour, or the limpidity of the wine. After\r\nhaving invited the judgment of people in society, whose preference,\r\nif they felt any, was generally for the heated wines, Pasteur wished\r\nto have a more decisive opinion. He addressed himself first to wine\r\nmerchants and others practised in detecting the smallest peculiarities\r\nof wines; and afterwards he organised a grand experiment in tasting. On\r\nNovember 16, 1865, a sub-commission, nominated by the representative\r\ncommission of the wholesale wine-sellers of Paris, repaired to the\r\nÉcole Normale and examined a considerable number of specimens. After\r\na series of tastings, which recognised, if not a superiority over\r\nthe heated wines, at least a shade of imperceptible flavour, which,\r\nhowever, it was admitted, would escape nine-tenths of the consumers,\r\nPasteur, fearing that there remained still in the mind of the majority\r\nof the commission a slight prejudice against the operation of heating,\r\nand that imagination, moreover, had some share in determining shades\r\nof flavour, proposed that at the next sitting there should be no\r\nindication which of the samples of wine had been heated and which had\r\nnot. The commission, having no other desire than to arrive at the\r\ntruth, at once accepted this proposition.\r\n\r\nThe resulting uncertainty as to whether the heated or the unheated\r\nwines were to be preferred was so absolute as to be comical. It is\r\nunnecessary to say that the heated wines had not experienced the\r\nleast alteration. At a certain point Pasteur, who was astonished at\r\nthe extraordinary delicacy of the palate of these tasters, employed a\r\nlittle trickery. He offered them two specimens absolutely identical,\r\ntaken out of the same bottle. There were preferences, very slight\r\nit is true, but preferences gravely expressed for one or the other\r\nglass. The commission, making allusion in its report to this special\r\ntasting experiment, was the first to allow with a good grace that the\r\ndifferences between the heated and non-heated wines were insignificant,\r\nimperceptible if they existed, and that the imagination--added the\r\nreport--was not without considerable influence in the tasting; since\r\nthe members of the commission had themselves fallen into a little\r\nexperimental snare.\r\n\r\nThus Pasteur, after having revealed the causes which determine the\r\nalterations of wines, had found the means of practically neutralising\r\nthem. By the application of heat, and without producing any change in\r\nthe colour or flavour of the wines, he had been able to insure their\r\nlimpidity, and to render them capable of being indefinitely preserved\r\nin well-closed vessels. If these wines, being afterwards exposed too\r\nlong to the air, were again threatened with alteration, it was because\r\nthe air brought to them new living germs of those ferments which had\r\nbeen destroyed by the heat. But germs from this source are so trifling\r\ncompared with those contained in the wine itself, that one may almost\r\nsay the heating process renders the wine unalterable even after it\r\nhas been rebottled in contact with the air. Thus, by a series of\r\nexperiments which left nothing to chance, one of the greatest economic\r\nquestions of the day was solved. Wines could be kept or transported\r\ninto all countries without losing their flavour or their perfume.\r\nThese experiments of the laboratory were destined to have an extensive\r\napplication; for very soon arrangements were made for heating wine\r\nin barrels, the inquiry thereby assuming the proportions of a public\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _THE SILKWORM-DISEASE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of the population of certain departments in the South of\r\nFrance hangs on the existence of silkworms. In each house there is\r\nnothing to be seen but hurdles, over which the worms crawl. They are\r\nplaced even in the kitchens, and often in well-to-do families they\r\noccupy the best rooms. In the largest cultivations, regular stages of\r\nthese hurdles are raised one above the other in immense sheds, under\r\nroofs of disjointed tiles, where thousands and thousands of silkworms\r\ncrawl upon the litters which they have the instinct never to leave.\r\nGreat or small, the silkworm-rearing establishments exist everywhere.\r\nWhen people accost each other, instead of saying 'How are you?' they\r\nsay 'How are the silkworms?' In the night they get up to feed them or\r\nto keep up around them a suitable temperature. And then what anxiety\r\nis felt at the least change of weather! Will not the mulberry leaves\r\nbe wet? Will the worms digest well? Digestion is a matter of great\r\nimportance to the health of the worms, which do nothing all their lives\r\nbut eat! Their appetites become especially insatiable during the last\r\ndays of rearing. All the world is then astir, day and night. Sacks\r\nof leaves are incessantly brought in and spread out on the litters.\r\nSometimes the noise of the worms munching these leaves resembles that\r\nof rain falling upon thick bushes. With what impatience is the moment\r\nwaited for when the worms arrive at the last moulting! Their bodies\r\nswollen with silk, they mount upon the brambles prepared for them,\r\nthere they shut themselves up in their golden prisons and become\r\nchrysalides. What days of rejoicing are those in which the cocoons are\r\ngathered; when, to use the words of Olivier de Serres, the silk harvest\r\nis garnered in!\r\n\r\nJust as in all agricultural harvests, this ingathering of the silk is\r\nexposed to many risks. Nearly always, however, it pays the cultivator\r\nfor his trouble, and sometimes pays him largely. But in 1849, after\r\nan exceptionally good year, and without any atmospheric conditions to\r\naccount for the fact, a number of cultivations entirely broke down.\r\nA disease which little by little took the proportions of an epidemic\r\nfell upon the silkworm nurseries. Worms hardly hatched, and worms\r\narrived at the last moulting, were equally stricken in large numbers.\r\nIt mattered little in what phase the silkworm happened to be: in all it\r\nwas assailable by the evil.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a schoolboy who has not reared in the recesses of his\r\ndesk some five or six silkworms, feeding them, in default of mulberry\r\nleaves, with leaves of lettuce or salsify. Therefore it is hardly\r\nnecessary to remind my readers how the silkworm is born, grows, and is\r\ntransformed. Coming out of its egg, which is called a grain, because of\r\nits resemblance to a small vegetable seed, the silkworm appears in the\r\nfirst fine days of spring. It does not then weigh more than one or two\r\nmilligrammes. Little by little its size and its activity augment. The\r\nseventh day after its birth it rests on a leaf and appears to sleep. It\r\nremains thus for nearly thirty hours. Presently, its head moves, as if\r\nit did not belong to the rest of the body, and under the skin of this\r\nhead appears a second quite new head. Just as if it came out of a case,\r\nthe silkworm disengages itself from its old withered skin. Here are its\r\nfront feet, there the false feet (_fausses pattes_), which it carries\r\nbehind. At length the worm is quite complete. It rests a while and\r\nthen begins to eat. At the end of a few days new sleep, new skin, new\r\nshedding of the skin, then a third, and then a fourth metamorphosis.\r\nAbout eight days after the fourth shedding of its skin, the worm ceases\r\nto eat, its body becomes more slender, more transparent; it seeks to\r\nleave its litter, it raises its head and appears uneasy. Some twigs of\r\ndried heather are then arranged for it to fasten upon; these it climbs,\r\nnever to descend again. It spins its cocoon and becomes a chrysalis.\r\nWhen the worms of a cultivation have all spun their cocoons, they are\r\nsmothered in a steam stove, and, after being dried in the sun, they are\r\nhanded over to the spinners. If it is desired to reserve some of the\r\ncocoons for seed, instead of being smothered, they are strung together\r\nin chaplets. After about three weeks, the moth comes out of its\r\nchrysalis. It pierces the cocoon by means of a liquid which issues from\r\nits mouth, and which has the property of so softening the silk that the\r\nmoth is able to pass through the cocoon. It has hardly dried itself and\r\ndeveloped its wings when the males and females pair for several hours.\r\nThen the females lay their eggs, of which they can produce from four to\r\nsix hundred. These are all the phases through which silkworms pass in\r\nthe space of two months.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the epidemic which ravaged the silkworm nurseries in 1849 the\r\nsymptoms were numerous and changeable. Sometimes the disease exhibited\r\nitself immediately. Many of the eggs were sterile, or the worms died\r\nduring the first days of their existence. Often the hatching was\r\nexcellent, and the worms arrived at their first moulting, but that\r\nmoulting was a failure. A great number of the worms, taking little\r\nnourishment at each repast, remained smaller than the others, having\r\na rather shining appearance and a blackish tint. Instead of all the\r\nworms going through the phases of this first moulting together, as\r\nis usually the case in a batch of silkworms, they began to present\r\na marked inequality, which displayed itself more and more at each\r\nsuccessive moulting. Instead of the worms swarming on the tables, as\r\nif their number was uniformly augmenting, empty spaces were everywhere\r\nseen; every morning corpses were collected on the litters.\r\n\r\nSometimes the disease manifested itself under still more painful\r\ncircumstances. The batch would progress favourably to the third, and\r\neven to the fourth moulting, the uniform size and the health of the\r\nworms leaving nothing to be desired; but after the fourth moulting\r\nthe alarm of the husbandman began. The worms did not turn white, they\r\nretained a rusty tint, their appetite diminished, they even turned away\r\nfrom the leaves which were offered to them. Spots appeared on their\r\nbodies, black bruises irregularly scattered over the head, the rings,\r\nthe false feet, and the spur. Here and there dead worms were to be\r\nseen. On lifting the litter, numbers of corpses would be found. Every\r\nbatch attacked was a lost batch. In 1850 and 1851 there were renewed\r\nfailures. Some cultivators, discouraged, attributed these accidents to\r\nbad eggs, and got their supplies from abroad.\r\n\r\nAt first everything went as well as could be wished. The year 1853,\r\nin which many of these eggs were reared in France, was one of the\r\nmost productive of the century. As many as twenty-six millions of\r\nkilogrammes of cocoons were collected, which produced a revenue of\r\n130,000,000 francs. But the year following, when the eggs produced by\r\nthe moths of these fine crops of foreign origin were tried, a singular\r\ndegeneracy was immediately recognised. The eggs were of no more value\r\nthan the French eggs. It was in fact a struggle with an epidemic. How\r\nwas it to be arrested? Would it be always necessary to have recourse to\r\nforeign seed? and what if the epidemic spread into Italy, Spain, and\r\nthe other silk cultivating countries?\r\n\r\nThe thing dreaded came to pass. The plague spread; Spain and Italy were\r\nsmitten. It became necessary to seek for eggs in the Islands of the\r\nArchipelago, in Greece, or in Turkey. These eggs, at first very good,\r\nbecame infected in their turn in their native country; the epidemic had\r\nspread even to that distance. The eggs were then procured from Syria\r\nand the provinces of the Caucasus. The plague followed the trade in the\r\neggs. In 1864 all the cultivations, from whatever corner of Europe they\r\ncame, were either diseased or suspected of being so. In the extreme\r\nEast, Japan alone still remained healthy.\r\n\r\nAgricultural societies, governments, all the world was preoccupied with\r\nthis scourge and its invading march. It was said to be some malady\r\nlike cholera which attacked the silkworms. Hundreds of pamphlets were\r\npublished each year. The most foolish remedies were proposed, as quite\r\ninfallible--from flowers of sulphur, cinders, and soot spread over the\r\nworms, or over the leaves of the mulberry, to gaseous fumigations of\r\nchlorine, of tar, and of sulphurous acid. Wine, rum, absinthe, were\r\nprescribed for the worms, and after the absinthe it was advised to try\r\ncreosote and nitrate of silver. In 1863 the Minister of Agriculture\r\nsigned an agreement with an Italian who had offered for purchase a\r\nprocess destined to combat the disease of the silkworms, by which he\r\n(the Minister) engaged himself, in case the efficacy of the remedy was\r\nestablished, to pay 500,000 francs as an indemnity to the Italian silk\r\ncultivator. Experiments were instituted in twelve departments, but\r\nwithout any favourable result. In 1865 the weight of the cocoons had\r\nfallen to four million kilogrammes. This entailed a loss of 100,000,000\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nThe Senate was assailed by a despairing petition signed by 3,600\r\nmayors, municipal councillors, and capitalists of the silk-cultivating\r\ndepartments. The great scientific authority of M. Dumas, his knowledge\r\nof silk husbandry, his sympathy for one of the departments most\r\nseverely smitten, the Gard, his own native place, all contributed to\r\ncause him to be nominated Reporter of the Commission. While drawing up\r\nhis report the idea occurred to him of trying to persuade Pasteur to\r\nundertake researches as to the best means of combating the epidemic.\r\n\r\nPasteur at first declined this offer. It was at the moment when the\r\nresults of his investigations on organised ferments opened to him a\r\nwide career; it was at the time when, as an application of his latest\r\nstudies, he had just recognised the true theory of the fabrication of\r\nvinegar, and had discovered the cause of the diseases of wines; it\r\nwas, in short, at the moment when, after having thrown light upon the\r\nquestion of spontaneous generation, the infinitely little appeared\r\ninfinitely great. He saw living ferments present everywhere, whether as\r\nagents of decomposition employed to render back to the atmosphere all\r\nthat had lived, or as direct authors of contagious maladies. And now\r\nit was proposed to him to quit this path, where his footing was sure,\r\nwhich offered him an unlimited horizon in all directions, to enter on\r\nan unknown road, perhaps without an outlet. Might he not expose himself\r\nto the loss of months, perhaps of years, in barren efforts?\r\n\r\nM. Dumas insisted. 'I attach,' said he to his old pupil, now become\r\nhis colleague and his friend, 'an extreme value to your fixing your\r\nattention upon the question which interests my poor country. Its misery\r\nis beyond anything that you can imagine.'\r\n\r\n'But consider,' said Pasteur, 'that I have never handled a silkworm.'\r\n\r\n'So much the better,' replied M. Dumas. 'If you know nothing about the\r\nsubject, you will have no other ideas than those which come to you\r\nfrom your own observations.'\r\n\r\nPasteur allowed himself to be persuaded, less by the force of these\r\narguments than by the desire to give his illustrious master a proof of\r\nhis profound deference.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as the promise was given and the resolution made to go to the\r\nSouth, Pasteur thought over the method to be employed in the pursuit\r\nof the problem. Certainly, amidst the labyrinth of facts and opinions,\r\nit was not hypotheses which were wanting. For seventeen years they had\r\nbeen rising up on all sides.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent and the most comprehensive memoirs upon the\r\nterrible epidemic had been presented to the Academy of Sciences by\r\nM. de Quatrefages. One paragraph of this paper had forcibly struck\r\nPasteur. M. de Quatrefages related that some Italian naturalists,\r\nespecially Filippi and Cornalia, had discovered in the worms and moths\r\nof the silkworm minute corpuscles visible only with the microscope.\r\nThe naturalist Lebert affirmed that they might always be detected in\r\ndiseased silkworms. Dr. Osimo, of Padua, had even perceived corpuscles\r\nin some of the silkworms' eggs, and Dr. Vittadini had proposed to\r\nexamine the eggs with a microscope in order to secure having sound\r\nones. M. de Quatrefages only mentioned this matter of the corpuscles\r\nas a passing remark, being doubtful of its importance, and perhaps of\r\nits accuracy. This doubt might have removed from Pasteur's mind the\r\nthought of examining the significance of these little corpuscles, but,\r\namid the general confusion of opinions, Pasteur was attracted to the\r\nstudy of these little bodies all the more readily because it related\r\nto an organic element which was visible only with the microscope.\r\nThis instrument had already rendered such services to Pasteur in his\r\ndelicate experiments on ferments, that he was fascinated by the thought\r\nof resuming it again as a means of research.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1865, Pasteur started for Alais. The emotion he felt on the\r\nactual spot where the plague raged in all its force, in the presence\r\nof a problem requiring solution, caused him at once to forget the\r\nsacrifices he had made in quitting his laboratory at the École Normale.\r\nHe determined not to return to Paris until he had exhausted all the\r\nsubjects requiring study, and had triumphed over the plague.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours after his arrival he had already proved the presence\r\nof corpuscles in certain worms, and was able to show them to the\r\nPresident and several members of the Agricultural Committee, who had\r\nnever seen them. The following day he installed himself in a little\r\nhouse three kilometers from Alais. Two small cultures were there\r\ngoing on; they were nearly the last, the cocoons had all been spun.\r\nOne of these cultures, proceeding from eggs imported that very year\r\nfrom Japan, had succeeded very well. The other, proceeding also from\r\nJapanese eggs which had been reproduced in the country, had arrived\r\nat their fourth moulting and had a very bad appearance. But, strange\r\nto say, on examining with the microscope a number of chrysalides and\r\nmoths of the group which had so delighted its proprietor, Pasteur\r\nfound corpuscles almost always present, whereas the examination of the\r\nworms of the bad group only exhibited them occasionally. This double\r\nresult struck Pasteur as very strange. He at once sent messengers into\r\nall the neighbourhood of Alais to seek for the remains of backward\r\ncultivations. He attached extreme importance to ascertaining whether\r\nthe presence of corpuscles in the chrysalides or moths of the good\r\ngroups, and the absence of the same corpuscles in the worms of the bad\r\ngroups, was an accidental or a general fact. He soon recognised that\r\nthese results did very frequently occur. But what would happen when the\r\nworms of the bad group spun their cocoons? Pasteur found that in the\r\nchrysalides, especially in the old ones, the corpuscles were numerous.\r\nAs regards the moths proceeding from these cocoons, not one was free\r\nfrom them, and they existed in profusion.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the idea that a connection between the disease and the\r\ncorpuscles might possibly exist, as other observers had previously\r\nimagined, Pasteur declared, in a Note presented to the Agricultural\r\nCommittee of Alais on June 26, 1865, twenty days after his arrival,\r\nthat it was a mistake to seek for the corpuscle in the eggs or in the\r\nworms. Both the one and the other could carry in them the germ of the\r\ndisease, without exhibiting distinct corpuscles, visible under the\r\nmicroscope. The evil developed itself especially in the chrysalides and\r\nin the moths, and it was in them that search should be made. Finally,\r\nPasteur came to the conclusion that the only infallible method of\r\nprocuring healthy eggs must be by having recourse to moths free from\r\ncorpuscles.\r\n\r\nPasteur hastened to apply this new method of obtaining pure eggs.\r\nNotwithstanding that the malady was universally prevalent, he\r\nsucceeded, after several days of assiduous microscopic observations,\r\nin finding some moths free from corpuscles. He carefully preserved\r\ntheir eggs, as well as other eggs which had proceeded from very\r\ncorpusculous couples, intending to wait for what these eggs would\r\nproduce the following year; the first would be probably free from\r\ncorpuscles, while the latter would contain them. He would thus have\r\nin future, though on a small scale, samples of originally healthy and\r\nof originally unhealthy cultivations, by the comparison of which with\r\nthe cultivations of the trade--all more or less smitten with the\r\nevil--totally new views might be expected to emerge. Who can tell,\r\nthought Pasteur, whether the prosperity of the silk cultivation may not\r\ndepend on the practical application of this production of pure eggs by\r\nmeans of moths free from corpuscles?\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nScarcely had Pasteur made known, first to the Committee of Alais,\r\nand then to the Academy of Sciences, the results of his earliest\r\nobservations and the inductions to which they pointed, when critics\r\nwithout number arose on all sides. It was objected that the labours\r\nof several Italian _savants_ had established beyond all doubt that\r\nthe corpuscles were a normal element of certain worms, and especially\r\nof all the moths when old; that other authors had affirmed it to be\r\nsufficient to starve certain worms to make these famous corpuscles\r\nappear in all their tissues; and that Dr. Gaetano Cantoni had already\r\ntried some cultivations with eggs coming from moths without corpuscles,\r\nand that he had totally failed.\r\n\r\n'Your efforts will be vain,' wrote the celebrated Italian entomologist\r\nCornalia; 'your selected eggs will produce healthy worms, but these\r\nworms will become sickly through the influence of the epidemic demon\r\nwhich reigns everywhere.'\r\n\r\nAnyone but Pasteur would have been staggered, but he was not the man\r\nto allow himself to be discouraged by _à priori_ opinions, and by\r\nassertions which were more or less guesswork. He was resolved not to\r\nabandon his preconceived idea until experiment had pronounced upon it\r\nwith precision. All scientific research, in order to be undertaken\r\nand followed up with success, should have, as point of departure,\r\na preconceived idea, an hypothesis which we must seek to verify by\r\nexperiment. To judge of the value of the facts which Pasteur had just\r\nannounced, it was necessary to know if there existed the relation of\r\ncause and effect between the corpuscles and the disease. This was the\r\ngreat point to be elucidated.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut if, without preliminary groping, he had discovered the way to\r\nbe pursued, Pasteur subsequently brought to bear his rare prudence\r\nas an experimentalist. For five years he returned annually for some\r\nmonths to Alais. The little house nestling among the trees called\r\nPont-Guisquet became at the same time his habitation and his silkworm\r\nnursery. It is hemmed in by mountains, up the sides of which terraces\r\nrise, one above the other, planted with mulberry trees. The solitude\r\nwas profound. Madame Pasteur and her daughter constituted themselves\r\nsilkworm-rearers--performing their part in earnest, not only gathering\r\nthe leaves of the mulberry trees, but also taking part in all the\r\nexperiments. The assistants of the École Normale, Duclaux, Maillot,\r\nGernez, and Raulin, grouped themselves around their master. Thus, in\r\nan out-of-the-way corner of the Cévennes was formed a colony seeking\r\nwith ardour the solution of an obscure problem, and the means of curing\r\nor preventing a disease which had for so long a time blighted one of\r\nthe great sources of the national wealth.\r\n\r\nOne of the first cares of Pasteur was to settle the question as to the\r\ncontagion of the disease. Many hypotheses had been formed regarding\r\nthis contagion, but few experiments had been made, and none of them\r\nwere decisive. Opinions were also very much divided. Some considered\r\nthat contagion was certain; the majority, however, either doubted or\r\ndenied its existence; some considered it as accidental. It was said,\r\nfor example, that the evil was not contagious by itself, but that it\r\nbecame so through the presence and complication of other diseases which\r\nwere themselves contagious. This hypothesis was convenient, and it\r\nenabled contradictory facts to be explained. If some persons had seen\r\nhealthy worms, which had been mixed up either by mistake or intention\r\nwith sickly ones, perish, and if they insisted on contagion, others\r\nforthwith replied by diametrically opposite observations.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the divergences of opinion might be, everyone at all\r\nevents believed in the existence of a poisonous medium rendered\r\nepidemic by some occult influence. Pasteur soon succeeded, by accurate\r\nexperiments, in proving absolutely that the evil was contagious.\r\n\r\nOne of the first experiments was as follows. After their first\r\nmoulting, he took some very sound worms free from corpuscles, and fed\r\nthem with corpusculous matter, which he prepared in the following\r\nsimple manner. He pounded up a silkworm in a little water, and passed\r\na paint-brush dipped in this liquid over the whole surface of the\r\nleaves. During several days there was not the least appearance of\r\ndisease in the worms fed on those leaves; they reached their second\r\nmoulting at the same time as the standard worms which had not been\r\ninfected. The second moulting was accomplished without any drawback.\r\nThis was a proof that all the worms, those infected as well as the\r\nstandard lot, had taken the same amount of nourishment. The parasite\r\nwas apparently not present. Matters remained in this state for some\r\ndays longer. Even the third moulting was got through without any marked\r\ndifference between the two groups of worms. But soon important changes\r\nset in. The corpuscles, which had hitherto only showed themselves in\r\nthe integuments of the intestines, began to appear in the other organs.\r\nFrom the second day following the third moulting--that is to say,\r\nthe twelfth after the infection--a visible inequality distinguished\r\nthe infected from the non-infected worms. Those of the standard lot\r\nwere clearly in much the best health. On examining the infected worms\r\nthrough a magnifying glass, a multitude of little spots were discovered\r\non their heads, and on the rings of their bodies, which had not before\r\nshown themselves. These spots appeared on the exterior skin when the\r\ninterior skin of the intestinal canal contained a considerable number\r\nof corpuscles. It was these corpuscles that impeded the digestive\r\nfunctions, and interfered with the assimilation of the food. Hence\r\narose the inequality of size of the worms. After the fourth moulting,\r\nthe same type of disease was noticed as that which was breaking out\r\neverywhere in the silkworm nurseries, especially the symptom of spots\r\non the skin, which had led to the disease being called _pébrine_.\r\nThe peasants said that the worms were peppered. The majority of the\r\nworms were full of corpuscles. Those which spun their cocoons produced\r\nchrysalides which were nothing but corpusculous pulp, if such a term be\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nIt was thus proved that the corpuscles, introduced into the intestinal\r\ncanal at the same time as the food of the worms, convey the infection\r\ninto the intestinal canal, and progressively into all the tissues. The\r\nmalady had in certain cases a long period of incubation, since it was\r\nonly on the twelfth day that it became perceptible. Finally, the spots\r\nof _pébrine_ on the skin, far from being the disease itself, were but\r\nthe effect of the corpuscles developed in the interior; they were but a\r\nsign, already removed from the true seat of the evil. 'If these spots\r\nof _pébrine_,' thought Pasteur, 'were considered in conjunction with\r\ncertain human maladies in which spots and irruptions appear on the\r\nbody, what interesting inductions might present themselves to minds\r\nprepared to receive them!'\r\n\r\nPasteur was never tired of repeating this curious experiment, or of\r\nvarying its conditions. Sometimes he introduced the corpusculous\r\nfood into healthy worms at their birth, sometimes at the second or\r\nthird moulting. Occasionally, when the worms were about to spin their\r\ncocoons, the corpusculous food was given them. All the disasters that\r\nwere known to have happened in the silkworm nurseries, their extent and\r\ntheir varied forms, were faithfully reproduced. Pasteur created at will\r\nany required manifestation of _pébrine_. When he infected quite healthy\r\nworms, after their fourth moulting, with fresh corpusculous matter,\r\nthese worms, even after several meals of corpusculous leaves alternated\r\nwith meals of wholesome leaves, made their cocoons. It might have been\r\nsupposed that in this case the contagion had not taken effect. This was\r\nbut a deceptive appearance. The communication of the disease exhibited\r\nitself in a marked degree in the chrysalides and in the moths. Many of\r\nthe chrysalides died before they turned into moths, and their bodies\r\nmight be said to be entirely composed of corpuscles. Such moths as\r\nwere formed, and which emerged from their cocoons, had a most miserable\r\nappearance. The disease sometimes went so far as to render breeding and\r\nthe laying of eggs impossible.\r\n\r\nFaithful to the rules prescribed by the experimental method, Pasteur\r\nwas careful to reproduce these same experiments with the worms of the\r\nstandard lot, from which all infected worms had been selected. He fed\r\nthese healthy worms on leaves over which a clear infusion made from the\r\nremains of moths or worms exempt from corpuscles had been spread with a\r\npaint-brush, instead of leaves contaminated with corpusculous remains.\r\nThis food kept the worms in their usual health. Could there be a better\r\nproof that the corpuscles alone were the real cause of the _pébrine_\r\ndisease?\r\n\r\nThese experiments, I repeat, threw a strong light on the nature of the\r\ndisease, and exactly accounted for what took place in the industrial\r\ncultivations. From the malady which attacked the worms at their birth,\r\ndecimating a whole cultivation, down to the invisible disease that may\r\nbe said to inclose itself in the cocoon, all was now explained. One\r\nof the effects of the plague which had most excited the surprise and\r\nthwarted the efforts of cultivators was the impossibility of finding\r\nproductive eggs, even when they tried to obtain them from the cocoons\r\nof groups which had succeeded perfectly well as far as the production\r\nof cocoons was concerned. It was proved that almost invariably the\r\nfollowing year the eggs of these fine-looking groups were unproductive.\r\nNumbers of the agricultural boards, and practitioners, not being able\r\nto believe in the existence of the disease in collections that were\r\nso satisfactory as regards the abundance and beauty of the cocoons,\r\npersisted in thinking that the failures had an origin not connected\r\nwith the seed itself. This resulted in deception after deception,\r\noften even in mistakes that were much to be regretted. Frequently the\r\nbest husbandmen were known to reserve for the production of eggs some\r\nvery fine cultivations, not having observed in the worms either spots\r\nof _pébrine_ or corpuscles even up to the time when the mounting of\r\nthe brambles had been accomplished; and the year following they had\r\nthe pain of seeing all the cultivations from these eggs perish. These\r\ncircumstances, so well calculated to produce discouragement and to give\r\nthe disease a mysterious character, met with their natural explanation\r\nin the facts proved by experimental infection.\r\n\r\nStill, as it never occurs to the cultivator to infect the worms\r\ndirectly by giving them food charged with corpusculous débris, it might\r\nbe asked how, in the industrial establishments, such results can be\r\nproduced. Pasteur lost no time in solving this difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn a cultivation containing corpusculous worms these worms perpetually\r\nfurnish contagious matter, which falls upon the leaf and fouls it.\r\nThis is the excreta of the worms, which the microscope shows to be more\r\nor less filled with corpuscles drawn from the lining of the intestinal\r\ncanal. It is there that they swarm. It is easy to understand that these\r\nexcreta, falling on the leaves, contaminate them all the more easily\r\nbecause the worms, by the weight of their bodies in crawling, press the\r\nexcreta against the leaves. This is one cause of natural contagion. By\r\nthe excreta of corpusculous worms which he crushed, mixed with water,\r\nand spread with a paint-brush over the mulberry leaves intended for a\r\nsingle meal, Pasteur was able to communicate the contagion to as many\r\nworms as he liked.\r\n\r\nHe also indicated another natural and direct cause of contagion. The\r\nsix fore-feet of the worm have sharp hooks at their ends, by means of\r\nwhich the worms prick each other's skins. Let any one imagine a healthy\r\nworm passing over the body of the corpusculous worm. The hooks of the\r\nfirst worm, by penetrating the skin of the second, are liable to be\r\nsoiled by the corpuscles immediately below that skin; and these hooks\r\nare capable of carrying the seeds of disease to other healthy worms,\r\nwhich may be pricked in their turn. To demonstrate experimentally, as\r\nPasteur did, the existence of this cause of contagion, it was only\r\nnecessary to take some worms and allow them to wound each other.\r\nLastly, infection at a distance, through the medium of the air and the\r\ndust it carries, is a fact equally well established. It is sufficient,\r\nby sweeping the breeding-houses, or by shaking the hurdles, to stir\r\nup the dust of corpusculous excretions and the dried remains of dead\r\nworms, and to allow them to be spread over the hurdles of the healthy\r\nworms, to cause, after a certain time, contagion to appear among these\r\nworms. When very healthy worms were placed in a breeding nursery at a\r\nconsiderable distance from unhealthy worms, they, in their turn, became\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\nAfter so many decisive experiments it was no longer possible not to see\r\nin _pébrine_ an essentially contagious disease. Nevertheless, among\r\nfacts invoked in favour of non-contagion, there was one which it was\r\ndifficult to explain. There existed several examples of successful\r\ncultivations conducted in nurseries which had totally failed from the\r\neffects of _pébrine_ the year before. The explanation is, as shown by\r\nPasteur, that the dust can only act as a contagion when it is fresh.\r\nCorpusculous matter, when thoroughly dried, loses its virulence. A few\r\nweeks suffice to render such matter inoffensive: hence the dust of\r\none year is not injurious to the cultivations of the next year. The\r\ncorpuscles contained in the eggs intended for future cultivation alone\r\ncause the transmission of the disease to future generations.\r\n\r\nAnd what can be more easily understood than the presence of\r\ncorpusculous parasites in the egg? The egg comes into existence during\r\nthat marvellous phase of the life of a silkworm when, after having spun\r\nits cocoon, it sleeps within it as a chrysalis, resolving itself, so to\r\nspeak, into those kinds of albumen and yelk from which the fully-formed\r\nmoth will emerge, as a chick emerges from its egg. Let anyone imagine\r\nthis origin of an approaching life, no longer in its normal purity,\r\nbut associated with a parasite which will find in the materials\r\nsurrounding it, so adapted to life and transformation, the elements of\r\nits own nourishment and multiplication. This parasite will be present\r\nwhen the eggs of the female moth, tender and soft as albumen, begin\r\nto define their outlines. Woe betide those eggs if they then enclose\r\nany particles of corpuscle, or of its original matrix. In vain will\r\nthe envelope of those eggs become by degrees hard and horny; the enemy\r\nis within, and later on he will be discovered in the embryo of the\r\nsilkworm.\r\n\r\nThus this terrible plague is at the same time contagious and\r\nhereditary, helping us to understand the evolution of this double\r\ncharacter in certain maladies both of men and animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nThe first time Pasteur went to Alais the silkworm epidemic was\r\nuniversally attributed to a single cause--_pébrine_. _Pébrine_ was\r\ncalled _the disease_. This word expressed everything. It indicated the\r\nexistence of a mysterious scourge, the origin and nature of which could\r\nnot be traced, but which was ready to fall upon all the establishments\r\ndevoted to the nurture of the worms. Whatever might happen, or whatever\r\nmight be the cause of ruin in a silkworm nursery, _the disease_ was\r\nheld responsible. One of the most striking proofs that the evil was\r\nattributed to _pébrine_ alone is found in the fact that a prize of\r\n5,000 florins was offered by the Austrian Government in 1868, as a\r\nreward for the discovery of the best remedy for the prevention and cure\r\nof _pébrine_--'the epidemic disease which devastates the silkworm.'\r\n\r\nA rapid glance at the principles which have just been established\r\nsuffices to show that _pébrine_ might now be regarded as vanquished.\r\nPasteur had demonstrated that moths free from corpuscles never produced\r\na single corpusculous egg; he had proved, moreover, that eggs brought\r\nup in a state of isolation, at a distance from contaminated eggs,\r\nproduce no worms, chrysalides, or moths which are corpusculous. It was\r\neasy, therefore, to multiply cultivations free from _pébrine_. The\r\nproduction of silk and the production of eggs was thus secured. To make\r\nsure that the eggs were pure it was only necessary to have recourse to\r\nthe microscopic examination of the moths which had produced them. These\r\nobservations might be made by women, by young girls, even by children.\r\nIt was sufficient to crush up a moth in a little water, and to put\r\na drop of this mixture under the microscope, to see the corpuscles\r\nclearly, if they existed. It seemed, then, that the plague was got rid\r\nof. But Pasteur was not slow in recognising that the general belief in\r\na single malady could not be justified. If the experiments of 1866 had\r\ndemonstrated to him the full extent of the corpusculous malady, and had\r\nestablished the principles of a treatment proper for its prevention,\r\nthe method he had adopted had also shown him that _pébrine_ was far\r\nfrom being the only cause from which the silk culture suffered.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1867 that this result was obtained. From an experimental\r\npoint of view, that year counted double for Pasteur. Influenced by a\r\nprofound sympathy for the misery which he had witnessed during two\r\nsuccessive years, and, at the same time, impatient to find the cause\r\nof the scourge, Pasteur, in the months of February, March, and April,\r\nin advance of the great industrial cultivations, commenced a series of\r\nexperiments on worms hatched by artificial heat, and fed with mulberry\r\nleaves from a hothouse.\r\n\r\nDuring these forced experiments Pasteur observed that out of sixteen\r\nbroods derived from non-corpusculous parents, fifteen succeeded, while\r\nthe sixteenth perished almost entirely between the fourth moulting\r\nand the climbing on to the brambles. After having exhibited a most\r\nhealthful appearance, the worms died suddenly. In a cultivation of\r\n100 worms, ten, fifteen, twenty dead ones were picked up daily: these\r\nturned black, and became putrid with extraordinary rapidity, often\r\nwithin the space of twenty-four hours. Sometimes they were soft and\r\nflabby, like an empty, crumpled intestine. Consulting the authors who\r\nhad written upon silkworms, Pasteur could not doubt that he had before\r\nhis eyes a characteristic specimen of the disease called _morts-flats_,\r\nor _flacherie_. Not only were these worms free from all _pébrine_\r\nspots, but no corpuscles were to be found in any part of their bodies.\r\nA still more significant fact was, that corpuscles were also absent\r\nfrom the chrysalides and the moths of those few worms which were able\r\nto spin their cocoons. Although this sample was confined to a single\r\ngroup of eggs derived from parents free from corpuscles, Pasteur\r\ncontinued to entertain doubts as to the existence of only a single\r\ndisease, and also as to the necessary connection of _pébrine_ with\r\n_flacherie_.\r\n\r\nThese suspicions were confirmed by his cultivations of April and\r\nMay. Numerous cases of _flacherie_ presented themselves. Uncertainty\r\nwas no longer possible as to the mutual independence of the two\r\nmaladies--_pébrine_ and _flacherie_. The cultivations most seriously\r\ninvaded by the last-mentioned disease came from eggs produced by\r\nparents free from corpuscles, and led on to reproducers also free from\r\nthis parasite. On visiting a multitude of industrial cultivations,\r\nPasteur discerned that what had passed in his own laboratory was of\r\nvery general occurrence, and that, contrary to the received opinion,\r\ntwo distinct maladies divided between them the cause of all the\r\nmisfortunes. _Pébrine_ was evidently the most widely spread, but\r\n_flacherie_ had also its share, and a very large share, in the calamity.\r\n\r\nHere, once more, the microscope came to Pasteur's assistance. If, at\r\nthe period of the rearing of the silkworms, when the mean temperature\r\nis always rather high, some mulberry leaves are crushed in a mortar\r\nand mixed with a little water, the liquid being left to itself, in\r\ntwenty-four hours it will be found filled with microscopic organisms;\r\nsome motionless, resembling little rods or spores joined end to end,\r\nlike strings of beads, others more or less active, flexible, endowed\r\nwith a sinuous movement like that of the vibrios found in nearly all\r\norganic infusions in process of decomposition. Whence come these\r\nmicroscopic organisms? The facts relating to spontaneous generation\r\nindicate that the germs of these organisms were on the surface of the\r\npounded leaf, spread in the form of dust over the instruments used to\r\ntriturate the leaf, possibly on the mortar, the pestle, or in the water\r\nadded to the pounded leaves.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, that if the intestinal canal of a worm in full\r\nprocess of digestion be opened, the pounded leaf which fills it from\r\none end to the other will not show microscopic organisms of any kind,\r\nbut only cells of parenchyma, green granules of the chlorophyl of the\r\nleaf, and remains of the air-vessels of the plant. Through the action\r\nof the liquids secreted by the glands which line the integuments of the\r\nintestinal canal, the germs of organisms are themselves digested or\r\nhindered in their development. The digestive functions of silkworms are\r\nso active that everything is carried away, destroyed in the same manner\r\nas the leaves themselves.\r\n\r\nBut if from any cause the digestion of the worms be impeded or\r\nsuspended, then the germs introduced with the food into the intestinal\r\ncanal will give rise to the multiplication of microscopic organisms\r\nwhich are always found in the artificially bruised leaf when mixed\r\nwith a little water. How numerous are the causes which may check this\r\ndigestive function of the worm--a function of such importance to a\r\ncreature which in the space of one month passes from the weight of\r\nhalf a milligramme to that of five, six, seven, or even eight grammes!\r\nPasteur proved that whenever a worm was attacked with _flacherie_,\r\nit always had, associated with the food in its intestinal canal, one\r\nor other of the microscopic organisms which are invariably to be met\r\nwith among crushed mulberry leaves. Summing up in a kind of aphorism\r\na series of observations, Pasteur observes: 'Every _ver flat_ is one\r\nwhich digests badly, and, conversely, every worm which digests badly\r\nis doomed to perish of _flacherie_, or to furnish a chrysalis and\r\na moth the life of which, through the injury produced by organised\r\nferments, is not normally perfected.'\r\n\r\nThus, as in the case of _pébrine_, the morbid symptoms of _flacherie_\r\nare very variable. All depends on the intensity of the evil--that is\r\nto say, on the abundance and the nature of the parasites developed in\r\nthe intestinal canal, and also on the period in the life of the worm\r\nwhen this fermentation begins to show itself. The most dangerous of\r\nall these ferments are those of the family of vibrios. If they exist\r\nin the first phases of the life of the worm, it dies quickly and very\r\nsoon becomes putrid, sometimes resolving itself into an infected pus.\r\nThe disease often manifests itself in a manner particularly distressing\r\nand disastrous to the cultivator. The worms have presented the most\r\nbeautiful appearance up to the time of climbing the heather. The\r\nmortality has scarcely been two or three per cent., which is nothing;\r\nthe moultings have been effected in a perfect manner, when suddenly,\r\nsome days after the fourth moulting, the worms become languid, crawling\r\nwith difficulty, and hesitating to take the leaves which are thrown\r\nupon their hurdles. If some few have mounted on to the heather, they\r\nstretch themselves on the twigs, their bodies swollen with food which\r\nthey cannot digest. Sometimes they remain there motionless till they\r\ndie, or, falling, remain suspended only by their false feet. The few\r\nmoths which have succeeded in piercing their cocoons do not show any\r\ncorpuscles. They can produce eggs, but these eggs, coming from parents\r\nweakened by disease, give rise the following year to a generation\r\nthreatened with _flacherie_. It is in this sense that the disease may\r\nbe regarded as hereditary, although the parasites of the intestinal\r\ncanal to which _flacherie_ is due do not transmit themselves to the\r\neggs or to the worms which issue from them. The worms inherit weakly\r\nconstitutions, and, being without power of resistance against anything\r\nthat can derange their digestive functions, they are at the mercy of\r\nthe accidents of their culture.\r\n\r\nToo large an assemblage of worms in one nursery; too high a temperature\r\nat the time of moulting; a thunderous atmosphere, which predisposes\r\norganic matter to fermentation; the use of heated or wet leaves,\r\nespecially if the wetting be caused by a fog or by the morning or\r\nevening dew, which deposits on the leaf the germs suspended in a great\r\nmass of air;--these are so many causes calculated to diminish the\r\nactivity of the digestive functions of the worms, and to produce in\r\nconsequence a fermentation of the leaf in the intestinal canal--the\r\nmalady now under consideration. Often also _flacherie_ depends upon\r\nmistakes committed by the husbandman while tending his precious 'kine,'\r\nto use an expression of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nA Chinese book published on the rearing of silkworms contains a series\r\nof little practical counsels. 'The person who takes care of the\r\nsilkworms,' says this guide to the perfect cultivator, 'ought to wear\r\na simple garment, not lined. He must regulate the temperature of the\r\nspinning-house according to the sensation of heat or cold which he\r\nexperiences; if he feels cold, he may conclude that the worms are cold,\r\nand he will increase the fire; if he feels hot, he will conclude that\r\nthe worms are hot, and he will suitably diminish the fire.'\r\n\r\nOne point which had been ignored before the experiments of Pasteur was\r\nthe contagious character of _flacherie_. This contagion may surpass\r\nthat of _pébrine_ itself as regards duration. In _pébrine_ the dried\r\ncorpusculous matter loses all virulence after the lapse of some weeks.\r\nThe disease cannot, therefore, communicate itself from one year to\r\nanother by the corpusculous dust of a rearing establishment. The\r\ngerms, on the contrary, of the microscopic organisms which provoke\r\nfermentation in the mulberry leaves, especially the vibrios, retain\r\ntheir vitality for several years. The dust of a silkworm nursery\r\ninfected by _flacherie_ appears under a microscope quite full of cysts\r\nor spores of vibrios. These spores or cysts rest, like the sleeping\r\nbeauty in the forest, until a drop of water falls upon them and\r\nawakens them into life. Deposited on the leaves which are to serve as\r\nnourishment, these germs of vibrios are carried into the intestinal\r\ncanal of the worm, develop and multiply themselves, and completely\r\ndisturb the digestive functions, unless the digestion is so strong\r\nthat the germs are immediately arrested, and disposed of like the food\r\nitself. This is what happens when the worms are in full vigour. It is a\r\nstruggle for life, in which the worms often gain the victory.\r\n\r\nGiving to some very healthy worms a meal of leaves covered with the\r\ndry dust of a silkworm nursery, infected the year before by _pébrine_\r\nand _flacherie_, Pasteur reproduced _flacherie_, and not _pébrine_.\r\nStill more readily did he produce the first of these maladies, when he\r\ngave, as food, leaves polluted by the contents of the intestinal canal\r\nof worms which had died of the disease. As in the case of _pébrine_,\r\nthe excreta of the worms attacked by _flacherie_, defiling the leaves,\r\ncarry the mischief to the healthy worms, or add to the dangerous\r\nfermentation in the intestines of those which are already in part\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nTo preserve silkworms from accidental _flacherie_, hygienic precautions\r\nare sufficient. As regards hereditary _flacherie_, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, that which develops itself easily on any diminution of\r\nvigour in the eggs and in the embryo, Pasteur again found a remedy\r\nby having recourse to the microscope. By means of the microscope it\r\nis possible to obtain information as to the health of the worms,\r\nthe chrysalides, and the moths destined to produce the eggs. Every\r\nattention should be directed to the complete exclusion of ferments from\r\nthe intestinal canal of the worms, and from the stomach-pouch of the\r\nchrysalides--a little pouch to which the intestinal canal of the worm\r\nis reduced, with its contents more or less transformed. But if there\r\nis not time to make this examination for parasitic ferments with the\r\nmicroscope, a simple inspection of the worms in their last stage will\r\nsuffice. Pasteur laid great stress upon the observation of the worms\r\nwhen they climbed on to the heather.\r\n\r\n'If I were a cultivator of silkworms,' he wrote in his beautiful work\r\non the diseases of silkworms, 'I would never hatch an egg produced from\r\nworms that I had not observed many times during the last days of their\r\nlife, so as to make sure of their vigour at the moment when they spin\r\ntheir silk. If you use eggs produced by moths the worms of which have\r\nmounted the heather with agility, have shown no signs of _flacherie_\r\nbetween the fourth moulting and mounting time, and do not contain\r\nthe least corpuscle of _pébrine_, then you will succeed in all your\r\ncultivations.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the end of this long investigation. All the\r\nobscurity which enveloped the origin of the diseases of silkworms had\r\nnow been dispelled. Pasteur had arrived at such accurate knowledge\r\nboth of the causes of the evil and their different manifestations,\r\nthat he was able to produce at will either _pébrine_ or _flacherie_.\r\nHe could so regulate the intensity of the disease as to cause it to\r\nappear on a given day, almost at a given hour. He had now to carry into\r\npractice the results of his laboratory labours.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the plague, and after some doubts which were\r\nsoon dispelled, it was clearly seen that all the mischief was to be\r\nattributed to the bad condition of the eggs. The remedy of distant\r\nexplorations for procuring non-infected eggs was both insufficient and\r\nprecarious. It simply amounted to going very far to seek, and paying\r\nvery dear, for seed which could not be relied on with certainty. The\r\nprosperity of the silkworm culture could only be secured by measures\r\ncapable of restoring to the native eggs their pristine qualities.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by Pasteur were sufficient to solve this problem.\r\nThe struggle against _flacherie_ was easy, but there remained the\r\nstruggle against _pébrine_. To triumph over this disease, which was so\r\nthreatening, Pasteur devised a series of observations as simple as they\r\nwere ingenious.\r\n\r\nHere is a crop which has perfectly succeeded. The moultings, and the\r\nclimbing upon the heather, are all that could be desired. The cocoons\r\nare finished, and the appearance of the moths alone is waited for.\r\nThey arrive, and they pair. Then begins the work of the cultivator,\r\nwho is careful about the production of his eggs. He separates the\r\ncouples at the end of the day; laying each female moth by itself on\r\na little linen cloth suspended horizontally. The females lay their\r\neggs. After the laying, he takes each female in turn and secures her\r\nby a pin passed through the wings to a folded corner of the little\r\ncloth, where are grouped some hundreds of eggs which she has laid. The\r\nmale moth also might be pinned in another corner of the cloth, but\r\nthe examination of the male is useless, as it has been found that he\r\ndoes not communicate the _pébrine_. The female moth, after having been\r\ndesiccated by free contact with the air, is examined at leisure, it may\r\nbe even in the autumn or winter. Nothing is easier than to ascertain\r\nwhether there are any corpuscles in its dead body. The moth is crushed\r\nin a mortar and mixed with a little water, and then a drop of the\r\nmixture is examined by the microscope. If corpuscles be found, the bit\r\nof cloth corresponding to the examined moth is known, and it is burnt\r\nwith all the eggs it contains.\r\n\r\nThis method of procuring pure eggs is, in fact, only the rational\r\ndevelopment of the first inductions which Pasteur had submitted to the\r\nAgricultural Committee of Alais in June 1865. At that time he hardly\r\nventured to hope that he should be able to find the means of preparing\r\nmore than very small quantities of healthy eggs for his experiments;\r\nbut events were so ordered that the starting-point, which seemed to\r\nbe purely scientific, unfolded a method susceptible of a widespread\r\npractical application. This process of procuring sound eggs is now\r\nuniversally adopted. In the Basses-Alpes, in Ardèche, in Gard, in the\r\nDrôme, and in other countries, may be met with everywhere, at the\r\ntime of the cultivation, workshops where hundreds of women and young\r\ngirls are occupied, with a remarkable division of labour and under the\r\nstrictest supervision of skilful overseers, in pounding the moths, in\r\nexamining them microscopically, and in sorting and classifying the\r\nlittle cloths upon which the eggs are deposited.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut if Pasteur had brought back wealth to ruined countries, if he had\r\nreturned to Paris happy in the victory he had gained, he had also\r\nundergone such fatigues, and had so overstrained himself in the use of\r\nthe microscope while absorbed in his daily and varied experiments, that\r\nin October 1868 he was struck with paralysis of one side. Seeing, as he\r\nthought, death approaching, he dictated to his wife a last note on the\r\nstudies which he had so much at heart. This note was communicated to\r\nthe Academy of Sciences eight days after this terrible trial.\r\n\r\nA soul like his, possessing so great a mastery over the body, ended\r\nby triumphing over the affliction. Paralysed on the left side, Pasteur\r\nnever recovered the use of his limbs. To this day, sixteen years after\r\nthe attack, he limps like a wounded man. But what stages had this\r\nwounded man yet to travel over, what triumphs were yet in store for\r\nhim!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _DECISIVE EXPERIMENTS._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having dictated this scientific note, which he thought would have\r\nbeen his last, his courage forsook him for a time. 'I regret to die,'\r\nhe said to his friend, Sainte-Claire Deville, who had hastened to his\r\nbedside; 'I should have wished to render more service to my country.'\r\nHis life was spared, but for several months Pasteur remained entirely\r\nparalysed, incapable of the slightest movement. Smitten thus in his\r\nfull strength at the age of forty-five, he took a sad review of his own\r\nstate. Even at the height of his attack his mind had always retained\r\nits clearness. He had pointed out to the doctor without any faltering\r\nof voice the progressive symptoms of the paralysis. Then reproaching\r\nhimself for having added to the grief of his wife by thus dwelling on\r\nthe details of his illness, he never allowed another word to escape\r\nhim about his infirm condition. Sometimes, even when he heard his two\r\nassistants, M. Gernez and M. Duclaux, whose devotion to him during\r\nthose sad days could only be compared to that of his wife, talking to\r\nhim of future labours, he entered into these thoughts and appeared to\r\nadd faith to their hopes. He finished by sharing them.\r\n\r\nIn January 1869, although it was still impossible for him to drag\r\nhimself about his room, he was so much excited by the contradictions\r\nthat his system of culture had aroused that he wished to start again\r\nfor Alais. 'Aided by the method of artificial cultivation,' he\r\nremarked, 'we shall soon annihilate these latest oppositions. There is\r\nhere both a scientific principle and an element of national wealth.'\r\n\r\nHis wish could not be opposed, but a terrible and anxious journey\r\nit was! At some leagues from Alais, at a place called Saint\r\nHippolyte-du-Fort, where the earliest experiments were made, Pasteur\r\nstopped. He installed himself--we might rather say he encamped--with\r\nhis family and his assistants, in a more than humble lodging, one of\r\nthose miserable, cold, paved houses of the rural districts. Seated\r\nin his arm-chair, Pasteur directed the experiments, and verified the\r\nobservations which he had made the year before. Each of his predictions\r\nas to the destiny of the different groups of worms was fulfilled to\r\nthe smallest detail. In the following spring he left for Alais, where\r\nhe followed in all their phases, from the egg up to the cocoon, the\r\ncultivations there undertaken, and he had the happiness of proving once\r\nmore the certainty of his method.\r\n\r\nBut opposition still continued. The French Government, shaken by the\r\nviolence and tenacity of the opponents, hesitated to decide upon this\r\nprocess of culture. The Emperor interposed; he instructed Marshal\r\nVaillant to propose to Pasteur to go into Austria to the Villa\r\nVicentina, which belonged to the Prince Imperial. For ten years the\r\nsilk harvest at this place had not sufficed to pay the cost of eggs.\r\nPasteur accepted with joy the prospect of a great decisive experiment.\r\nHe traversed France and Italy, reclining in a railway carriage or in\r\nan arm-chair, and at last arrived at the Imperial villa near Trieste.\r\nPasteur succeeded in a marvellous manner. The sale of the cocoons gave\r\nto the villa a net profit of twenty-six million francs. The Emperor,\r\nimpressed with the practical value of the system, nominated Pasteur\r\na Senator, in the month of July 1870. But this nomination, like so\r\nmany other things, was swept away before it had time to appear in the\r\n'Journal Officiel.' Pasteur, however, cared little for the title of\r\nSenator. He returned to France on the eve of the declaration of war.\r\n\r\nA patriot to the heart's core, he learned with poignant grief the news\r\nof his country's disasters. The bulletins of defeat, which succeeded\r\neach other with mournful monotony, threw him into deep despair. For the\r\nfirst time in his life he had not the strength to work. He lived at his\r\nlittle house in Arbois as one completely vanquished. Those who went\r\ninto his room found him often bathed in tears. On January 18, 1871,\r\nhe wrote, to the Dean of the Academy of Medicine at the University of\r\nBonn, a letter in which all his grief and all his pride as a Frenchman\r\nwere displayed, requesting him to withdraw the diploma of German doctor\r\nwhich the Faculty of Medicine of the University had conferred upon him\r\nin 1868. Whilst he wrote this letter, which was a cry of patriotism,\r\nhis son, enrolled as a volunteer, though hardly eighteen years of age,\r\nwas gallantly doing his duty in the Army of the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _STUDIES ON BEER._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war was over. Little by little the life of the country was resumed,\r\nand with returning hope the desire and necessity for renewed work.\r\nAfter two years of infirmity, Pasteur at length began to feel the\r\nrecovery of health. It was like a slow and gentle renewal of all\r\nthings. He wished to return as soon as possible to his laboratory in\r\nParis to put into execution projects of experiments which had long been\r\nworking in his brain. At the moment when he was preparing to start,\r\nthe rebellion of the Commune broke out. M. Duclaux, who had become\r\nProfessor of the Faculty of Sciences in Clermont-Ferrand, offered the\r\nuse of his laboratory to his old master. Pasteur accepted it. Eager to\r\ncommence an investigation which would bring him again to the study of\r\nfermentation, he attacked the diseases of beer. But it was not only\r\nfor the purpose of creating a new link between these researches and\r\nhis former ones that he occupied himself with this subject, he was\r\nalso influenced by a somewhat patriotic idea. He dreamt of success in\r\nan industry in which Germany is superior to France. He hoped by means\r\nof scientific principles, by which commerce would largely profit, to\r\nsucceed in making for French beer a reputation equal, if not superior,\r\nto that of Germany.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeer is much more liable to contract diseases than wine. It may be\r\nsaid that while old wine is often to be found, there is no such thing\r\nas old beer. It is consumed as fast as it is made. Less acid and less\r\nalcoholic than wine, beer is more laden with gummy and saccharine\r\nmatters, which expose it to rapid changes. Thus the trade in this\r\nbeverage is constantly struggling with the difficulties of its\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of beer is simple. It is extracted from germinated\r\nbarley, or malt, an infusion of which is made and gradually heated to\r\nthe boiling point. It is then flavoured by hops. When the infusion of\r\nmalt and hops, which is called 'wort,' is completed, it is subjected\r\nto a cooling process, and drawn off into tuns and barrels. It is\r\nthen that alcoholic fermentation sets in. The cooling ought to be\r\nperformed rapidly. While the wort is at a high temperature there is\r\nnothing to fear, it remains sound; but under 70° Centigrade, and\r\nparticularly between 25° and 35°, it is easily attacked by injurious\r\nferments--acetic, lactic, or butyric. After the wort is cooled, a\r\nlittle of the yeast proceeding from a former fermentation is added\r\nto it, in order that the whole mass of the wort should be invaded as\r\nsoon as possible after its cooling by the alcoholic ferment alone--the\r\nonly one, properly speaking, which can produce beer. If this wort\r\nwere treated in the same way as the must of the grape, if it were\r\nabandoned to fermentation without yeast--to so-called spontaneous\r\nfermentation--this would hardly ever be purely alcoholic, as in the\r\nmust of grapes, which is protected by its acidity. Most frequently,\r\ninstead of beer, an acid or putrid liquid would be obtained. Divers\r\nfermentations would simultaneously take place in it. When the wort has\r\nfermented and the beer is made, there is still the fear of its rapid\r\ndeterioration, which necessitates its being quickly consumed. This\r\ncondition is sometimes disastrous to those employed in the beer trade;\r\nand the improvements in the manufacture of beer which have been made\r\nduring the last forty years have all had for their object the removal\r\nof this necessity for the daily production, so to speak, of an article\r\nof which the consumption is liable to constant variations.\r\n\r\nFormerly only one kind of beer was known, the beer of high\r\nfermentation. The wort, after having undergone cooling in the troughs,\r\nis collected in a large open vat at a temperature of 20°, and yeast is\r\nadded to it. When the fermentation begins to show itself on the surface\r\nof the liquid, by the formation of a light white froth, the wort is\r\ntransferred to a series of small barrels, which are placed in cellars\r\nor store-rooms, kept at a temperature of from 18° to 20° Centigrade.\r\nThe activity of the fermentation soon causes a foam to rise, which\r\nbecomes more and more thick and viscous. This is owing to the abundance\r\nof yeast which it contains. This yeast, collected in a large trough\r\nplaced under the casks, is gathered up for future operations. The\r\nfermentation lasts for three or four days, then the beer is made and\r\nhas become clear; the bungs are fixed in the barrels, and they are sent\r\ndirect to the retail dealer or to the consumer. During the transit, a\r\ncertain quantity of yeast, fallen to the bottom of the casks, thickens\r\nthe beer, but a few days of repose suffice to make it again clear and\r\nfit to drink, or to be bottled.\r\n\r\nThis system of 'high' fermentation (so called because it begins at a\r\ntemperature of 18° to 20°, and is raised one or two degrees higher by\r\nthe act of fermentation itself) is very commonly practised in the north\r\nof France, and to a greater extent in the breweries of England. Ale,\r\npale ale, bitter beer, are all beers from high fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe 'low' fermentation, which is almost exclusively employed in\r\nGermany, and which is spreading more and more in France, consists\r\nin a slow fermentation, at low temperature, during which the yeast\r\nsettles at the bottom of the tubs and casks. The wort, after it\r\nhas been cooled, is passed into open wooden tuns, and the working\r\nof the yeast takes place at a temperature of about 6° Centigrade.\r\nThis temperature is maintained by means of floats, in the form of\r\ncones or cylinders, thrown into the fermenting tuns and kept filled\r\nwith ice. The fermentation lasts for ten, fifteen, and even twenty\r\ndays. When the beer is drawn off, the yeast is collected from the\r\nbottom of the fermenting tuns. This kind of beer, which is sometimes\r\ncalled German beer, sometimes Strasburg beer, is generally much more\r\nesteemed than the other, but it requires certain expensive, or at\r\nleast inconvenient, conditions. There must be ice-caves, where the\r\ntemperature is maintained all the year round at a few degrees only\r\nabove zero. This makes it necessary to have enormous piles of ice. It\r\nhas been calculated that for one single hectolitre of good beer, from\r\nthe beginning of the cooling of the wort until the time when it is fit\r\nfor sale, 100 kilogrammes of ice are required. The 'low' beer, called\r\nalso _bière de garde_, beer for keeping, is principally manufactured in\r\nwinter, and is preserved in ice-caves until the summer.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the taste of the consumers which has favoured the\r\nmanufacture of beer of low fermentation everywhere except in England;\r\nit is also the advantage this beer possesses in being much less liable\r\nto deterioration than the other. By employing ice, the brewer may\r\nmanufacture in winter, or in the beginning of spring, and thus place\r\nhimself in a position to meet the demands of consumption without fear\r\nof seeing his beer attacked by disease.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll the diseases of beer, as Pasteur has shown, are caused exclusively\r\nby the development of little microscopic fungi, or organised ferments,\r\nthe germs of which are brought by the dust constantly floating in\r\nthe air, or which gets mixed with the original substances used in\r\nthe manufacture. 'By the expression _diseases_ of wort and of beer,\r\nI mean,' said Pasteur, 'those serious alterations which affect the\r\nquality of these liquids so as to render them disagreeable to the\r\ntaste, especially when they have been kept for some time, and which\r\ncause the beer to be described as sharp, sourish, turned, ropy,\r\nputrid.' The wort of beer, after it has been raised to the boiling\r\nheat, may, as Pasteur's experiments testify, be preserved indefinitely,\r\neven in the highest atmospheric temperatures, when in contact with\r\nair free from the germs of the lower microscopic organisms. The\r\nmust, leavened by the addition of pure yeast, kept free from foreign\r\norganisms, contains nothing but the alcoholic ferment, and undergoes no\r\nother changes than those due to the action of the oxygen, which does\r\nnot give rise to acidity, putridity, or bitterness. Since the causes\r\nof deterioration are the same in beer as in wine, would it not appear\r\nas if the action of heat must be the best preservative? But beer is\r\na drink necessarily charged with carbonic acid, and the application\r\nof heat to considerable masses of the liquid would expel this gas. It\r\nwould be a very complicated business to attempt to preserve this gas,\r\nor to introduce it afresh after it had been expelled. This difficulty\r\ndoes not arise when the beer is bottled. At a temperature of 50° to\r\n55°, the process of heating not only cannot take away from the beer all\r\nits carbonic acid, but it does not prevent the secondary fermentation\r\nfrom taking place to a certain extent, and this allows of the beer\r\nbeing heated immediately after it is put into bottles. This heating of\r\nthe beer is practised on a large scale in Europe and in America. In\r\nhonour of Pasteur the process is called _Pasteurisation_, and the beer\r\n_Pasteurised_ beer.\r\n\r\nBut Pasteur was not content with simply destroying the ferments of\r\nthese diseases, he wished above all to prevent their introduction. At\r\nthe moment when the wort is raised to the boiling-point, when the germs\r\nof disease are destroyed by the heat, if the cooling of the wort is\r\neffected in contact with both air and yeast free from exterior germs,\r\nthe beer may be made under conditions of exceptional purity. Some\r\nbrewers, taking for their basis Pasteur's principles, constructed an\r\napparatus which enabled them to protect the wort while it was cooling\r\nfrom the organisms of the air, and to ferment this wort with a leaven\r\nas pure as possible. At the Exhibition of Amsterdam there might be\r\nseen bottles half full, containing a perfectly clear beer, which had\r\nbeen tapped from the time of opening of the Exhibition. This was French\r\nbeer, manufactured according to Pasteur's principles, by a great\r\nbrewer of Marseilles, M. Velten. The happy effect of these studies\r\nis universally recognised. At Copenhagen, M. Jacobsen has had a bust\r\nof Pasteur, by Paul Dubois, placed in the _salle d'honneur_ of his\r\ncelebrated laboratory.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn terminating his _Studies on Beer_, Pasteur recalled to mind the\r\nprinciples which for twenty years had directed his labours, the\r\nresources and applications of which appeared to him unlimited. 'The\r\netiology of contagious diseases,' he wrote with a scientific certainty\r\nof conviction, 'is on the eve of having unexpected light shed upon it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _VIRULENT DISEASES._\r\n\r\n                 SPLENIC FEVER (CHARBON)--SEPTICÆMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n'He that thoroughly understands the nature of ferments and\r\nfermentations,' said the physicist Robert Boyle, 'shall probably be\r\nmuch better able than he that ignores them, to give a fair account of\r\ndivers phenomena of certain diseases (as well fevers as others), which\r\nwill perhaps be never properly understood without an insight into the\r\ndoctrine of fermentations.'\r\n\r\nAt all times, medical theories, more particularly those which concern\r\nthe etiology of virulent diseases, have had to encounter the opposition\r\nof explanations invented to account for the phenomena of fermentation.\r\nWhen Pasteur in 1856 began his labours on these subjects, the ideas\r\nof Liebig were everywhere revived. Like the ferments, so the viruses\r\nand processes of disease were considered as the results of atomic\r\nmotions proper to substances in course of molecular change, and able to\r\ncommunicate themselves to the diverse constituents of the living body.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Pasteur on the part played by microscopic organisms\r\nin fermentation, changed the course of these ideas. The ancient\r\nmedical theory of parasites and living contagia was revived. A German\r\nProfessor, Dr. Traube, in 1864, put forward, in one of his clinical\r\nlectures, a new doctrine of the ammoniacal fermentation of urine.\r\n\r\n'For a long period,' he said, 'the mucus of the bladder was regarded\r\nas the agent of the alkaline decomposition of urine. It was supposed\r\nthat, in consequence of the distension produced by the retention\r\nof the liquid, the irritated bladder produced a larger quantity of\r\nmucus, and this mucus was regarded as the ferment which brought about\r\nthe decomposition of urea, by an innate chemical force. This opinion\r\n(which was that of Liebig) cannot hold its ground in presence of the\r\nresearches of Pasteur. This investigator has demonstrated, in the most\r\ndecisive manner, that alkaline fermentation, like alcoholic and acetic\r\nfermentation, is produced by living organisms, the pre-existence of\r\nwhich in the liquid is the _sine quâ non_ of the process.' And Dr.\r\nTraube, citing some facts which confirmed the doctrine of Pasteur,\r\nconcluded thus: 'Notwithstanding the long retention of the urine, its\r\nalkaline fermentation is not produced by an increased secretion of\r\nmucus or of pus; it only begins to develop from the moment when the\r\ngerms of vibrios find access to the bladder from without.\r\n\r\nThe opposite doctrines of Liebig and Pasteur are here brought into\r\nclear juxtaposition; and thus was their mutual and reciprocal influence\r\nestablished in dealing with the etiology of one of the most serious\r\ndiseases of the bladder. So far back as 1862, Pasteur, in his memoir\r\non spontaneous generation, had announced, contrary to all the notions\r\nthen held, that whenever urine becomes ammoniacal, a little microscopic\r\nfungus is the cause of this alteration. Later on he established that\r\nin affections of the bladder ammoniacal urine was never found without\r\nthe presence of this fungus; and in order to show how in these studies\r\ntherapeutic application often runs hand in hand with scientific\r\ndiscovery, Pasteur, having proved, with his assistant, M. Joubert,\r\nthat boracic acid is antagonistic to the development of the ammoniacal\r\nferment, advised Dr. Guyon, Clinical Professor of Urinary Diseases in\r\nthe Faculty of Paris, to combat the dangerous ammoniacal fermentation\r\nby injection of boracic acid into the bladder. The celebrated surgeon\r\nhastened to follow this advice, and with the most happy results. While\r\nattributing to Pasteur the honour of this discovery, M. Guyon, in one\r\nof his lectures, said:--\r\n\r\n'Boracic acid has this immense advantage, that it can be applied in\r\nlarge doses--3 to 4 per cent.--without causing the slightest pain.\r\nIt has therefore become, in our practice, the agent continually and\r\nsuccessfully used for injections. I also have recourse to a solution\r\nof boracic acid to produce large evacuations after the operation of\r\nbreaking up stones in the bladder (lithotrity). I never omit to use\r\nthis antiseptic agent in operations where breaking up is required,\r\nand I never wash the bladders of lithotritised patients with any\r\nother substance. I have also had good results from copiously washing\r\nthe bladders and the wounds of patients on whom lithotomy has been\r\nperformed with boracic acid. I always finish the operation by prolonged\r\nirrigations with a solution of from 3 to 4 per cent.'\r\n\r\nIt was not only into France and Germany that Pasteur's ideas\r\npenetrated; in England, surgery borrowed from Pasteur's researches\r\nimportant therapeutic applications. In 1865 Dr. Lister began in\r\nEdinburgh the brilliant series of his triumphs in surgery by the\r\napplication of his antiseptic method, now universally adopted. In the\r\nmonth of February 1874 in a letter which does honour to the sincerity\r\nand modesty of the great English surgeon, he wrote to Pasteur as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n'It gives me pleasure to think that you will read with some interest\r\nwhat I have written about an organism which you were the first to\r\nstudy in your memoir on lactic fermentation. I do not know whether you\r\nread the 'British Medical Journal;' if so, you will from time to time\r\nhave seen accounts of the antiseptic system which for the last nine\r\nyears I have been trying to bring to perfection. Allow me to take this\r\nopportunity of sending you my most cordial thanks, for having, by your\r\nbrilliant researches, demonstrated to me the truth of the germ theory\r\nof putrefaction, thus giving me the only principle which could lead to\r\na happy end the antiseptic system.'\r\n\r\nPasteur followed with lively interest the movement of thought and the\r\nsuccessful applications to which his labours had given rise. It was\r\na realisation of the hopes he had ventured to entertain. Already,\r\nin 1860, he expressed the wish that he might be able to carry his\r\nresearches far enough to prepare the way for a profound study of the\r\norigin of diseases. And, as he gradually advanced in the discovery of\r\nliving ferments, he hoped more and more to arrive at the knowledge of\r\nthe causes of contagious diseases.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he hesitated long before definitely engaging himself in\r\nthis direction. 'I am neither doctor nor surgeon,' he used to repeat\r\nwith modest self-distrust. But the moment came when, notwithstanding\r\nall his scruples, he could no longer be content himself to play the\r\npart of a simple spectator of the labours started by his studies on\r\nfermentation, on spontaneous generation, and on the diseases of wines\r\nand beer. The hopes to which his methods gave rise, the eulogies of\r\nwhich they were the object, obliged him to go forward. In February\r\n1876 Tyndall wrote to him thus:--\r\n\r\n'In taking up your researches relating to infusorial organisms, I have\r\nhad occasion to refresh my memory of your labours; they have revived\r\nin me all the admiration which I felt on first reading them. It is my\r\nintention to follow up these researches until I shall have dissipated\r\nevery doubt that has been raised as to the unassailable exactitude of\r\nyour conclusions.\r\n\r\n'For the first time in the history of science we are able to entertain\r\nthe sure and certain hope that, in relation to epidemic diseases,\r\nmedicine will soon be delivered from empiricism, and placed upon a\r\nreal scientific basis. When this great day shall come, humanity will\r\nrecognise that it is to you the greatest part of its gratitude is due.'\r\n\r\nPasteur approached the study of viruses by seeking to penetrate into\r\nall the causes of the terrible malady called splenic fever (_charbon_,\r\nGerm. _Milzbrand_). Each year this disease decimates the flocks not\r\nonly in France but in Spain, in Italy, in Russia, where it is called\r\nthe Siberian plague, and in Egypt, where it is supposed to date back\r\nto the ten plagues of Moses. Hungary and Brazil pay it a formidable\r\nyearly tribute; and to come back to France, the losses have amounted\r\nin certain years to from fifteen to twenty millions of francs. For\r\ncenturies the cause of this pest has eluded all research; and further,\r\nas the malady did not always exhibit the same symptoms, but varied\r\naccording to the kind of animal that was smitten by it, the disease was\r\nsupposed to vary with the species that was attacked by it. The splenic\r\nfever of the horse was distinct from that of the cow; the splenic\r\nfever of horse and cow were again different from that of the sheep. In\r\nthe latter, splenic fever was called _sang-de-rate_; in the cow, it\r\nwas _maladie du sang_; in the horse, splenic fever; in man, malignant\r\npustule.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1850 that trustworthy data were first collected\r\nregarding the nature of the malady, its identity with and difference\r\nfrom other maladies. From 1849 to 1852 a commission of the Medical\r\nAssociation of Eure-et-Loir made a great number of inoculations,\r\napplied other tests, and proved that the splenic fever of the sheep\r\nis communicable to other sheep, to the horse, to the cow, and to\r\nthe rabbit; that the splenic fever of the horse is communicable to\r\nthe horse and to the sheep; that the splenic fever of the cow is\r\ncommunicable to the sheep, to the horse, and to the rabbit. As for the\r\nmalignant pustule in man, no doubt remained that it must arise from the\r\nsame cause as splenic fever in animals. What class of men is it that\r\nthe malignant pustule most frequently attacks? Shepherds, cowherds,\r\ncattle breeders, farm servants, dealers in hides, tanners, wool\r\ncleaners, knackers, butchers--all who derive their living from domestic\r\nanimals. In handling contaminated subjects the slightest excoriation\r\nor scratch of the skin is sufficient to allow the virus to enter. When\r\nothers besides the class that we have named become infected, it is\r\nbecause they live in the neighbourhood of herds smitten with splenic\r\nfever. There are also certain flies which transport the virus. Suppose\r\none of these flies to have sucked the blood of an animal which has died\r\nof splenic fever, a person stung by that fly is forthwith inoculated\r\nwith the virus.\r\n\r\nAt the very time (1850) when these first experiments were being made\r\nby the Medical Association of the Eure-et-Loir, Dr. Rayer, giving\r\nan account in the 'Bulletin de la Société de Biologie de Paris' of\r\nthe researches he had made, with his colleague, Dr. Davaine, on the\r\ncontagion of splenic fever, wrote:--'In the blood are found little\r\nthread-like bodies about twice the length of a blood corpuscle. These\r\nlittle bodies exhibit no spontaneous motion.'\r\n\r\nThis is the date of the first observation on the presence of little\r\nparasitic bodies in splenic fever, but, strange to say, no attention\r\nwas paid to these minute filaments. Rayer and Davaine also paid no\r\nattention to them. This indifference lasted for thirteen years; it\r\nwould have lasted longer still, if the parasitic origin of communicable\r\ndiseases had not been brought before the mind by each new publication\r\nof Pasteur's. From 1857 to 1860 it will be remembered that he had\r\ndemonstrated lactic fermentation, like alcoholic fermentation, to\r\nbe the work of a living ferment; in 1861 he had discovered that the\r\nagent of butyric fermentation consisted of little moving thread-like\r\nbodies, of dimensions similar to those of the filaments discovered by\r\nDavaine and Rayer in the blood of splenic fever patients; in 1861 he\r\nhad announced that no ammoniacal urine existed without the presence\r\nof a microscopic organism; in 1863 he had established that the bodies\r\nof animals in full health are sealed against the introduction of the\r\ngerms of microscopic organisms; that blood drawn with sufficient\r\nprecaution from the veins and the arteries, and urine taken direct\r\nfrom the bladder, could be exposed to the contact of pure air without\r\nputrefaction, and without the appearance of living thread-like\r\norganisms of any kind whatever, mobile or immobile. It was all these\r\nfacts which in 1863 brought back the attention of Davaine, as he\r\nhimself has acknowledged, to the observation which he had made in 1850.\r\n\r\n'M. Pasteur,' said M. Davaine in a communication made to the Academy\r\nof Sciences, 'published some time ago a remarkable memoir on butyric\r\nfermentation, which consists of little cylindrical rods, possessing\r\nall the characteristics of vibrios or of bacteria. The thread-like\r\ncorpuscles which in 1850 I saw in the blood of sheep attacked with\r\n_sang-de-rate_, having a great analogy with these vibrios, I was led\r\nto examine whether filiform corpuscles, analogous to or of the same\r\nkind as those which determined the butyric fermentation, would not,\r\nif introduced into the blood of an animal, equally act the part of a\r\nferment. Thus would be easily explained the alteration, and the rapid\r\ninfection of the mass of the blood, in an animal which had received\r\naccidentally or experimentally into its veins a certain number of these\r\nbacteria--that is to say, of this ferment.'\r\n\r\nBut two summers passed before M. Davaine was able to procure a sheep\r\naffected with the _sang-de-rate_. It was only in 1863 that he first\r\nrecognised the constant presence of a parasite, in the blood of sheep\r\nand rabbits which had died from successive inoculations with blood\r\ntaken after death or in the last hours of life. He further proved that\r\nthe inoculated animal, in the blood of which no parasites were as yet\r\nvisible with the microscope, had every appearance of health, and that\r\nin these conditions the blood could not communicate splenic fever.\r\n\r\n'In the present state of science,' Davaine concluded, 'no one would\r\nthink of going beyond these corpuscles to seek for the agent of the\r\ncontagion. This agent is visible, palpable; it is an organised being,\r\nendowed with life, which is developed and propagated in the same manner\r\nas other living beings. By its presence, and its rapid multiplication\r\nin the blood, it without doubt produces in the constitution of this\r\nliquid, after the manner of ferments, modifications which speedily\r\ndestroy the infected animal.' 'For a long time,' he repeated,\r\n'physicians and naturalists have admitted theoretically that contagious\r\ndiseases, serious epidemic fevers, the plague, &c., are caused by\r\ninvisible animalculæ, or by ferments, but I do not know that these\r\nviews have ever been confirmed by any positive observations.'\r\n\r\nA few months after the publication of the results obtained by Davaine,\r\ntwo professors of Val-de-Grâce, MM. Jaillard and Leplat, sought to\r\nrefute the preceding conclusions. After having inoculated rabbits and\r\ndogs with various putrefying liquids filled with vibrios, they could\r\nnot cause the death of these animals. To bring about this result it was\r\nnecessary to introduce into the blood of these dogs and rabbits several\r\ncubic centimeters of very putrid liquid. Again in this case, which only\r\nadded another example to the experiments of Gaspard and Magendie upon\r\nthe action of putrid liquids, they failed to generate any virulence in\r\nthe blood. Davaine had no difficulty in showing that MM. Jaillard and\r\nLeplat's experiments were made under conditions totally different from\r\nhis; that he, Davaine, had not made use of the vibrios or bacteria of\r\nunselected infusions, but of bacteria which had been found in the blood\r\nof sheep which had died from _sang-de-rate_.\r\n\r\nJaillard and Leplat returned to the charge, and this time with entirely\r\nnew and unexpected experiments. They inoculated some rabbits, as\r\nDavaine desired, with the blood of a cow which had died of splenic\r\nfever. The rabbits died rapidly, but without showing before or after\r\ntheir death the least trace of bacteria. Other rabbits, inoculated with\r\nthe blood of the first, perished in the same manner, but it was still\r\nimpossible to discover any parasite in their blood. MM. Jaillard and\r\nLeplat offered Davaine some drops of this blood. Davaine, taking up the\r\nexperiments of his opponents, confirmed the exactitude of the facts\r\nthey had announced, but concluded by saying that these two professors\r\nhad not employed true splenic fever blood, but the blood of a new\r\ndisease, unknown up to that time, which Davaine proposed to call the\r\ncow disease.\r\n\r\n'The blood which we used,' replied MM. Jaillard and Leplat, 'was\r\nfurnished to us by the director of the knacker's establishment of\r\nSours, near Chartres, and this director is undeniably competent as to\r\nthe knowledge of splenic fever.'\r\n\r\nFull of sincerity and conviction, MM. Jaillard and Leplat recommenced\r\ntheir experiments, using this time the blood of a sheep which had\r\ndied of splenic fever, and which M. Boutet, the most experienced\r\nveterinary surgeon of the town of Chartres, had procured for them.\r\nTheir results were the same as those obtained with the blood of the\r\ncow. Notwithstanding the replies of Davaine, which, however, added\r\nnothing to the facts already adduced on one side or the other, it was\r\ndifficult to pronounce decidedly in such a debate. Unprejudiced minds\r\nreceived from these important discussions the impression that Jaillard\r\nand Leplat, in producing facts the exactitude of which were admitted by\r\nDr. Davaine himself, had given a blow to the assertions of the latter,\r\nand that the subject required, in every case, new experimental studies.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, a German physician, Dr. Koch, took up the question. He\r\nconfirmed the opinion of Davaine, but without in the least producing\r\nconviction, since he threw no light upon the facts adduced by MM.\r\nJaillard and Leplat, of which, indeed, he did not even deign to speak.\r\nAt the very same moment when the memoir of Koch appeared in Germany,\r\nthe eminent physician Paul Bert came forward to corroborate the opinion\r\nof Jaillard and Leplat.\r\n\r\n'I can,' said M. Paul Bert, 'destroy the bacteria in a drop of blood\r\nby compressed oxygen, inoculate with what remains, and reproduce the\r\ndisease and death without any appearance of bacteria. Therefore, the\r\nbacteria are neither the cause nor the necessary effect of the disease\r\nof splenic fever. It is due to a virus.'\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the opinion of Jaillard and Leplat. Pasteur, in\r\nobedience to the necessity he felt to get at the fundamental truth of\r\nthings, and also in his eager desire to discover some decisive proofs\r\nas to the etiology of this terrible disease, resolved in his turn to\r\nattack the subject.\r\n\r\nDr. Koch had stated in his memoir that the little filiform bodies,\r\nseen for the first time by Davaine in 1850, had two modes of\r\nreproduction--one by fission, which Davaine had observed, and another\r\nby bright corpuscles or spores. The existence of this latter mode of\r\nreproduction Pasteur had already discovered in 1865, reasserted and\r\nillustrated in 1870, as being common to the filaments of the butyric\r\nferment, and to all the ferments of putrefaction. Was Dr. Koch ignorant\r\nof this important fact, or did he prefer by keeping silence to reserve\r\nto himself the advantage of apparent priority?\r\n\r\nIn order to solve the first difficulty which presented itself to\r\nhis mind--that is to say, the question as to whether splenic fever\r\nwas to be attributed to a substance, solid or liquid, associated or\r\nnot associated with the filaments discovered by Davaine, or whether\r\nit depended exclusively upon the presence and the life of these\r\nfilaments--Pasteur had recourse to the methods which for twenty\r\nyears had served him as guides in his studies on the organisms of\r\nfermentation. These methods, delicate as they are, are very simple.\r\nWhen he wished, for example, to demonstrate that the microbe-ferment\r\nof the butyric fermentation was the very agent of decomposition, he\r\nprepared an artificial liquid formed of phosphates of potash, of\r\nmagnesia, and of sulphate of ammonia, added to the solution of the\r\nfermentable matter, and in this medium he caused the microbe-ferments\r\nto be sown in a pure state. The microbe multiplied, and provoked\r\nfermentation. From this liquid he could pass to a second or third\r\nfermentable liquid composed in the same manner, and so on in\r\nsuccession. The butyric fermentation appeared successively in each.\r\nSince the year 1857 this method was supreme. In this particular\r\nresearch on the disease of splenic fever Pasteur proposed to isolate\r\nthe microbe of the infected blood, to cultivate it in a state of purity\r\nin artificial liquids, and then to come back to the examination of\r\nits action on animals. But as, since his attack of paralysis in 1868,\r\nPasteur had not recovered the use of his left hand, and consequently\r\nfound it impossible to carry on a long series of experiments alone, he\r\nwas obliged to seek for a courageous and devoted assistant. He found\r\none in a former pupil of his at the École Normale, M. Joubert, now\r\nProfessor of Physics at the Collège Rollin. If M. Joubert incurred\r\nthe danger of these experiments on splenic fever, he also shared with\r\nPasteur, in the Comptes-rendus of the Academy of Sciences, the honour\r\nof the researches and the triumph of the discoveries.\r\n\r\nOn April 30, 1877, Pasteur read to the Academy of Sciences, in his own\r\nname and in that of his fellow-worker, a note in which he demonstrated,\r\nthis time in a completely unanswerable manner, that the bacilli called\r\nbacteria, bacterides, filaments, rods, in a word the bacilli discovered\r\nby Davaine and Rayer in 1850, constituted the only agent of the malady.\r\n\r\nA little drop of splenic fever blood, sown in urine or in the water of\r\nyeast, previously sterilised--that is to say, rendered _un_putrescible\r\nby contact with air free from all suspended germs--produces in a few\r\nhours myriads of bacilli or of bacteria. A little drop of this first\r\ncultivation sown in a second flask containing the same liquid as the\r\nfirst and prepared with the same precautions as to sterility and\r\npurity, shows itself no less fertile. Finally, after ten or twenty\r\nsimilar cultures the parasite is evidently freed from the substances\r\nwhich the initial drop of blood might carry with it; yet, if a very\r\nsmall quantity of the last culture is injected under the skin of a\r\nrabbit or a sheep, it kills them in two or three days at most, with all\r\nthe clinical symptoms of natural splenic fever.\r\n\r\nIt might be objected that the parasite was associated in the\r\ncultivating liquid with some dissolved substance that it had\r\nproduced during its life and which acted as a poison. Pasteur\r\naccordingly transported some cultivating tubes into the cellars of\r\nthe Observatory, where a temperature absolutely constant reigned,\r\na circumstance which permits of the deposit of all the parasitic\r\nfilaments at the bottom of the tubes. Inoculating afterwards both with\r\nthe clear upper liquid and with the deposit at the bottom, he found\r\nthat the latter alone produced disease and death. It is, then, the\r\nbacteria which cause splenic fever. The proof was given and no further\r\ndoubt remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\nYes, splenic fever is no doubt produced by bacteria just as itch is\r\nproduced by acaries and trichinosis by trichinæ. The only difference\r\nis that the parasite of splenic fever can only be seen by means of a\r\nrather powerful microscope. Here, then, is a disease in the highest\r\ndegree virulent, due in its first cause to the _infinitely little_.\r\nPasteur laid hold of and isolated this terrible virus. It was in a\r\nmicroscopic parasite, and in it alone, that the virulence of splenic\r\nfever resided. A great scientific fact had been gained. A virus might\r\nconsist not of amorphous matter, but of microscopic beings. The\r\nvirulence was due to their life.\r\n\r\nLiebig, and all the chemists and doctors who had accepted and\r\nmaintained his doctrine, totally repudiated all vital action in\r\nfermentation as well as in contagious and infectious diseases.\r\nDominated by their hypotheses, they allowed themselves to be deceived\r\nby false assimilations to facts of a purely chemical kind, which\r\nappeared to them to be connected with the phenomena of fermentation and\r\nvirulence.\r\n\r\nLiebig wrote, 'By the contact of the virus of small-pox the blood\r\nundergoes an alteration, in consequence of which its elements reproduce\r\nthe virus, and this metamorphosis is not arrested until after the\r\ncomplete transformation of all the globules capable of decomposition.'\r\n\r\nThis vague theory of viruses was forced to give way before the\r\nmultiplied experiments of Pasteur. But before occupying himself with\r\nfurther discoveries, although it had been irrefutably proved that the\r\nmicroscopic parasite was the true contagium, it was necessary to throw\r\nlight upon the facts, mainly accurate, which had been announced by\r\nJaillard and Leplat, and to bring them into harmony with the facts, not\r\nless certain, which had been advanced by Davaine. The rabbits which\r\nJaillard and Leplat had inoculated with a drop of the blood of a cow or\r\nsheep stricken with splenic fever, died rapidly, and the blood of these\r\nrabbits was shown to be also virulent. It was sufficient to inoculate\r\nother rabbits with a very minute quantity to cause their death. But\r\nJaillard and Leplat affirmed that the examination of that blood did not\r\nreveal the existence of any microscopic organisms. Paul Bert, on his\r\npart, had succeeded in destroying the bacteria by compressed oxygen,\r\nand yet the virulence had continued.\r\n\r\nWere there, then, two kinds of virus? What escape was there from this\r\ndarkness? A new light suddenly began to dawn. Pasteur had already some\r\nyears previously demonstrated that the animal body is sealed against\r\nthe introduction of lower organisms--that in the blood, the urine, the\r\nmuscles, the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, the brain, the marrow,\r\nand the nerves, in a normal state, no germ is found, or particle of\r\nany kind, known or unknown, which could be transformed into bacteria,\r\nvibrios, monads, or microbes. The intestinal canal alone is filled\r\nwith matters associated with a host of germs and living products in\r\nprocess of development, and in divers states of physiological action.\r\nNot only is its temperature favourable to the life of infusoria,\r\nbut it receives incessantly matters charged with the germs of these\r\nmicroscopic organisms. To the upper portions of the canal the air\r\nstill has access, so that even in the stomach aerobic microbes may be\r\nfound, but in the lower parts of the intestinal canal oxygen is absent,\r\nand only anaerobic microbes can be developed there. Although the life\r\nexerted in the mucous surface of the intestines opposes itself to the\r\npassage of those little organisms into the interior of the body, this\r\nceases to be the case after death. There is no longer any obstacle to\r\narrest or prevent them from acting according to the respective laws of\r\ntheir evolution and of the decomposing influence which belongs to them.\r\nIt is by anaerobic organisms, in fact, that the putrefaction of dead\r\nbodies is begun. They penetrate into the organs and into the blood as\r\nsoon as this liquid is deprived of oxygen; and it is not long before\r\nthis happens, the oxygen fixed in the globules being soon consumed. In\r\nthe body of an animal which has died of splenic fever, putrefaction is\r\nstill more rapid, because, through the action of the disease, the blood\r\nis already in a great degree deprived of oxygen at the time of death.\r\nNothing is more striking than the rapid inflation and almost immediate\r\nputrefaction of animals which have succumbed to splenic fever. Of all\r\nthe vibrios ready to pass from the intestinal canal into the network\r\nof mesenteric veins which surround the canal those which seem to take\r\nthe foremost place are the septic vibrios. These specially merit the\r\nname of vibrios of putrefaction, from the very putrid gases which\r\nresult from their action upon nitrogenous and sulphurous substances.\r\nThe others diffuse themselves more or less slowly in the blood, but\r\nthe septic vibrio takes almost immediate possession of the dead body.\r\nAlready after twelve or fifteen hours, the blood of the diseased\r\nanimal, which at the time of its death and during the first following\r\nhours contained exclusively the parasite of splenic fever, harbours\r\nat one and the same time both the bacillus of splenic fever and the\r\nseptic vibrio. Then occur the very curious effects arising from the\r\nanaerobic nature of these vibrios, and their opposition to the bacillus\r\nof splenic fever, which is exclusively aerobic. Diffused in blood\r\ndeprived of oxygen gas, the splenic bacillus soon perishes. In its\r\nplace are to be found amorphous granulations deprived of all virulence.\r\nThe septic anaerobic vibrio, on the contrary, finds itself after death\r\nin the most favourable conditions for its life and development. Not\r\nonly does it penetrate into the blood by the deep mesenteric veins, but\r\nalso into the liquids which ooze out of the abdomen and muscles.\r\n\r\nFrom the antagonism existing between the physiological peculiarities of\r\nthe splenic bacilli and the septic vibrio, it results that if, in order\r\nto inoculate an animal capable of contracting the fever, a drop of\r\nblood be taken from one that has just died of it, and if the operation\r\nis performed during the first few hours after death, it is certain to\r\ncommunicate to that animal splenic fever, and splenic fever only. If,\r\non the other hand, the operation is performed after a greater number\r\nof hours--say, between twelve and twenty, according to the season of\r\nthe year--then the inoculation of the blood will communicate, at one\r\nand the same time, splenic fever and septicæmia--acute septicæmia, as\r\nit may be called, because of the rapid inflammatory disorders that the\r\nseptic vibrio causes in the inoculated animal. The two diseases may be\r\ndeveloped simultaneously in the inoculated animal, but generally one\r\nprecedes the other. The septic contagium is the quickest in its action;\r\nit generally causes death before the splenic fever has had time to\r\ndevelop itself and to produce appreciable effects.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to explain all the contradictory results\r\nobtained by MM. Jaillard and Leplat on one side, and by Davaine on\r\nthe other. In a country which splenic fever had made famous, the\r\nDépartement d'Eure-et-Loir, they had asked for a little splenic fever\r\nblood. Now, what takes place in a farm where an animal has died of\r\nthis disease? The dead body is thrown upon a dungheap, or into some\r\nshed or stall, until the knacker's cart happens to pass. The knacker\r\ntakes his own time, and the body often remains there twenty-four or\r\nforty-eight hours. The blood taken from this animal is more or less\r\ninvaded by putrefaction, and vibrios are mingled with the bacteria of\r\nsplenic fever, the development of which is arrested the moment the\r\nanimal dies. In short, it may be easily conceived that an experimenter\r\nwriting to Chartres to procure some splenic fever blood might, without\r\nhis knowledge, or the knowledge of his correspondent, receive blood at\r\nthe same time both splenic and septic. And this septicæmia is sometimes\r\nmanifold, for a special septicæmia may be said to correspond to every\r\nsort of vibrio of putrefaction.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances which, without their being aware of\r\nit, accompanied Jaillard and Leplat's researches upon splenic fever\r\ninfection. This impression will be derived from reading the successive\r\nnotes laid by them before the Academy of Sciences. The blood of the cow\r\nwhich had died of splenic fever, sent from the knacker's establishment\r\nof Sours, and the blood of the sheep sent by M. Boutet, must both have\r\nbeen taken from the bodies of animals which had been dead a sufficient\r\nnumber of hours to render their blood both splenic and septic; and it\r\nwas septicæmia, so prompt in its action, that had killed the rabbits\r\nof Jaillard and Leplat. As the examination of the blood of these\r\nanimals showed no signs of bacteria, they had concluded, with great\r\napparent truth, that the inoculation of splenic blood could cause death\r\nwithout any appearance of these organisms, even while the blood used\r\nfor inoculation was full of them. The presence of _septic_ vibrios in\r\nthe blood of the inoculated rabbits escaped their notice. When Davaine\r\nreplied that Jaillard and Leplat had not worked with pure splenic blood\r\nhe had hit upon the truth, but he could not give plausible reasons for\r\nit. The contest was carried on by experiments in which, on both sides,\r\ntruth and error were closely blended.\r\n\r\nThe work of M. Paul Bert, at the close of 1876, was surrounded with\r\ncircumstances no less complex. To thoroughly understand them we must\r\ncall to mind Pasteur's discovery as to the mode of reproducing the\r\nanaerobic germs of putrefaction. These vibrios reproduce themselves\r\nby spores. In the vibrio of acute septicæmia this is the mode of\r\ngeneration. Short or long jointed filaments show themselves studded\r\nwith brilliant points, which are precisely the spores of which we\r\nspeak. Experience proves that these spores resist perfectly the\r\npoisonous action of compressed oxygen. Inoculating an animal with blood\r\nwhich is at the same time septic and splenic, after the blood has been\r\ncompressed, the septic germs, remaining alive, produce death, although\r\nneither bacteria nor filaments may be perceptible in its blood at\r\nthe moment of death. It was likewise from Chartres that M. Paul Bert\r\nobtained his supply of splenic fever blood. The blood he had received\r\nwas without doubt not only splenic but also septic. The filaments of\r\nbacteria and the filaments of septic vibrios had perished under the\r\ninfluence of the compressed oxygen; but the spores were there, and the\r\ngreat pressure of oxygen gas had not affected them. The new contagium\r\nwhich had appeared, and which had killed the inoculated animals, was\r\ndue to these spores.\r\n\r\nAs regards the proof that this virulence in the blood of the body of\r\nan animal which has died of splenic fever is really the effect of\r\nthe septic vibrio, Pasteur, assisted by Joubert and a new assistant,\r\nM. Chamberland, has given that proof, as he did in the case of the\r\nbacterium of splenic fever, by resorting to the method of successive\r\ncultivations in an artificial medium. These cultivations, however, of\r\nthe septic vibrio require very special precautions and conditions.\r\nThey should be carried on in as perfect a vacuum as it is possible\r\nto obtain, or in contact with carbonic acid gas without the presence\r\nof air. In contact with air the cultivations of septic vibrios would\r\nprove sterile, because the vibrio is exclusively anaerobic and air\r\nkills it. If a spore of this organism could germinate in contact with\r\nthe air, the product of the germination would be at once arrested and\r\nwould perish by the action of the oxygen. It is exactly the contrary\r\nwith the bacilli of splenic fever, which prove sterile in a vacuum or\r\nin presence of carbonic acid gas. If one of the spores of the splenic\r\nfever bacillus (for it also produces spores) could germinate, the\r\nproduct of the germination, deprived of free oxygen, would at once\r\nperish. And, to mention in passing a very ingenious experiment of\r\nPasteur's, we thus obtain a means of separating by culture the bacillus\r\nof splenic fever from the septic vibrio when they are temporarily\r\nassociated together. If this mixture of pathogenic organisms is\r\ncultivated in contact with the air, the bacilli of splenic fever alone\r\nwill be developed. If this same mixture is cultivated without air,\r\neither in a vacuum or in carbonic acid gas, the septic vibrio alone\r\nwill be developed. This device of culture is one of the best which can\r\nbe employed to demonstrate that the blood of a body dead from splenic\r\nfever possesses immediately after death a single contagium, that of\r\nsplenic fever, and that twenty-four hours after death, on the contrary,\r\nthere are two contagia, that of splenic fever and that of septicæmia.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome months ago a very hot discussion arose between Pasteur and a\r\ncommission formed principally of professors of the veterinary school\r\nin Turin, regarding the facts above mentioned. One experiment, in\r\nthe success of which Pasteur was extremely interested, had been made\r\nat this school. Instead of employing pure splenic fever blood, free\r\nfrom all contagium, the Italian professors, whether from ignorance\r\nof the preceding facts or from inadvertence, employed the blood of\r\na diseased sheep, which, from their own showing, had been dead more\r\nthan twenty-four hours. Pasteur immediately wrote, pointing out that\r\nthe commission had done wrong in using blood which must have been at\r\nthe same time splenic and septic. The Turin professors grew angry,\r\nand affirmed that this assertion of Pasteur's was incorrect; that\r\nthis sheep's blood had been studied with care, and that no filaments\r\nhad been found in it except those of splenic fever; and it would,\r\nmoreover, be marvellous, they added ironically, that Pasteur from\r\nthe depths of his laboratory in Paris should be able to assert that\r\nthis blood was mixed with septic poison, whilst they, good observers,\r\narmed with a microscope, had had this sheep's blood under their eyes.\r\nPasteur contented himself with replying that his assertion rested\r\nupon a principle, and that he was perfectly able, without having seen\r\nthe blood of the sheep, to affirm that under the conditions in which\r\nit had been collected that blood was septic. A public correspondence\r\nensued, but no understanding could be come to. Pasteur then offered to\r\ngo himself to Turin, in order to demonstrate upon as many bodies of\r\nsheep dead of splenic fever as they would like to give him, that the\r\nblood of these dead bodies--at the end of twenty-four hours if in the\r\nmonth of March, and in twelve or fifteen hours if in the month of June,\r\nwould be found to be both splenic and septic. Pasteur also proposed,\r\nby appropriate cultures, to withdraw at pleasure the splenic fever\r\npoison or the septic poison, or the two together, at the choice of the\r\nItalians. The Italians, however, shrank from Pasteur's proposal to pay\r\nthem a visit in order to convince them of their error.\r\n\r\nThe clearness and certainty of Pasteur's assertions are celebrated, but\r\nwhat gives such authority to all that he advances is, as M. Paul Bert\r\nonce said, that Pasteur's boldness of assertion is only equalled by his\r\ndiffidence when he has not experiment to back him up. He never fights\r\nexcept on ground with which he has made himself familiar, but then he\r\nfights with such resolution, and sometimes with such impetuosity, that\r\none might say to his adversary, whoever he be, 'Je vous plains de\r\ntomber dans ses mains redoutables.'\r\n\r\n'Take care!' said a member of the Academy of Sciences to a member of\r\nthe Academy of Medicine, who a short time after the incident just\r\nrelated was proposing scientifically to 'strangle' Pasteur, 'take care!\r\nPasteur is never mistaken.'\r\n\r\nOne day, in 1879, a professor attached to a faculty of medicine in\r\none of the provinces announced to the Academy of Sciences that he had\r\nfound, in the blood of a woman who had died in a hospital after two\r\nweeks' illness from severe puerperal fever, a considerable number of\r\nmotionless filaments, simple or jointed, transparent, straight, or\r\nbent, which belonged to the genus Leptothrix. Engaged in studies on\r\npuerperal fever, and having never met with a fact of this kind in his\r\nresearches, Pasteur wrote at once to this professor to ask him for a\r\nspecimen of the infected blood. The blood arrived at the laboratory,\r\nand some days after Pasteur wrote to the doctor, 'Your leptothrix is\r\nnothing else than the bacterium of splenic fever.'\r\n\r\nThis answer perplexed the doctor very much. He wrote to Pasteur that he\r\ndid not dispute the affirmation, but that he proposed to control it;\r\nthat if he found he had been in error he would publish it.\r\n\r\nPasteur offered to send him guinea-pigs which had been inoculated with\r\nsplenic fever. 'You will receive them still living; they will die under\r\nyour eyes. You will make the autopsy and you will yourself recognise\r\nyour leptothrix.' The doctor accepted the test. Pasteur inoculated\r\nthree guinea-pigs, had them placed in a cage and sent by rail to the\r\nprofessor. They arrived the following morning and died twenty-four\r\nhours afterwards under the doctor's own eyes. The first had been\r\ninoculated with the infectious blood of the dead woman, the second with\r\nthe bacterium of splenic fever blood from Chartres, the third with the\r\nblood of a cow which had died of splenic fever in the Jura. At the\r\nautopsy it was impossible to discover the slightest difference in the\r\nblood of the three animals. Not only the blood but the internal organs,\r\nand especially the spleen, were in exactly the same condition.\r\n\r\nThen, in the most honourable manner, the doctor hastened to state, in a\r\ncommunication to the Academy of Sciences, that he regretted doubly not\r\nhaving known about splenic fever the year before, as he might have been\r\nable, on the one hand, to diagnose the formidable complication which\r\nhad manifested itself in the woman who died on April 4, 1878, and, on\r\nthe other hand, to have traced out the mode of contamination which\r\nnow eluded him. He had, however, succeeded in learning a few details\r\nregarding the unhappy woman. She was a charwoman, and lived in a little\r\nroom adjoining the stables of a horse-dealer. Through these stables a\r\nlarge number of horses passed continually.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our septic vibrios. If air destroys them, if their\r\nculture is impossible in contact with air, how can septicæmia exist,\r\nsince air is everywhere present? How can blood exposed to the air\r\nbecome septic from particles of dust on the surface of objects or which\r\nthe air holds in suspension? Where can the septic germs be formed? The\r\nobjection seems a serious one, but it disappears before a very simple\r\nexperiment. Take some serum from the abdomen of a guinea-pig which has\r\ndied of acute septicæmia. It will be found full of septic vibrios in\r\nprocess of generation by fission. Let this liquid be then exposed to\r\nthe contact of air, with the precaution of giving a certain depth to\r\nthe liquid--say, a centimeter of depth. In some hours, if examined with\r\nthe microscope, the following curious spectacle will be witnessed: In\r\nthe upper layers the oxygen of the air is absorbed, which is manifested\r\nby the already changed colour of the liquid. There the filamentous\r\nvibrio dies, and disappears under the form of fine amorphous\r\ngranulations deprived of virulence. At the bottom of this layer of one\r\ncentimeter in thickness, on the contrary, the vibrios, protected from\r\nthe approach of oxygen by those of their own kind which have perished\r\nabove them, continue to multiply by fission until by degrees they pass\r\ninto the state of spores; so that instead of moving threads of all\r\ndimensions, the length of which sometimes even extends beyond the\r\nfield of the microscope, nothing is now seen but a dust of brilliant\r\nisolated specks, upon which the oxygen of the air has no action. It\r\nis thus that a dust of septic germs can be formed even in contact\r\nwith air. And thus it becomes possible to understand how anaerobic\r\norganisms may be sown in putrescible liquids by the dust suspended in\r\nthe atmosphere. Thus also may be explained the permanence of putrid\r\ndiseases, even of those which are caused by anaerobic microbes, that\r\ncannot live in the atmosphere and which escape destruction by becoming\r\nspores.\r\n\r\nBy means of these experiments, as unexpected as they were conclusive,\r\nPasteur had demonstrated that Jaillard and Leplat had not really\r\ninoculated their rabbits with an amorphous virus, liquid or solid, but\r\nwith a virus constituted of a living microscopic organism--in other\r\nwords, with a true ferment. By the side of the parasite of splenic\r\nfever we have thus a fresh example of a living animated virus, with\r\ngerms forming dust. And the extraordinary thing is that among the\r\nmicrobes of special maladies--which they produce by penetrating and\r\nmultiplying in the bodies of animals--are to be found aerobies like\r\nthe bacilli of splenic fever, and anaerobies like the vibrios of acute\r\nsepticæmia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nIn these two virulent maladies, then, splenic fever and septicæmia, the\r\nresearches of Pasteur had clearly established the parasitic theory. A\r\ngrand and novel opening was made for future studies on the origin of\r\ndiseases. Yet, judging from the surprising differences which separate\r\nsepticæmia and splenic fever, we can foresee that should the future,\r\ncopying the past, in regard to this and still more recent discoveries,\r\nhave in store, as it no doubt has, the knowledge of new microbes of\r\ndisease, the specific properties of these microscopic organisms will\r\ndemand, for each new exploration, ceaselessly repeated efforts, not\r\nonly to make the existence of these organisms evident, but also to\r\nfurnish decisive proofs of their morbific power. But the question\r\nwhich may be considered as already solved is the non-spontaneity of\r\nthese infectious microbes. By what is called spontaneous disease\r\nis meant parasitic disease. But in the present state of science\r\nspontaneous disease has no more existence than spontaneous generation.\r\nSuch aphorisms, however, are not allowed to pass without occasional\r\ncontradictions, all the more vehement from their rarity. At the\r\nInternational Medical Congress held in London, August 1881, Dr.\r\nBastian, who practises in one of the principal hospitals of London,\r\ndeclared that though he was unable to deny the existence of parasitic\r\ndiseases, yet, in his opinion, the microbes were the effect and not the\r\ncause of these diseases.\r\n\r\n'Is it possible,' cried Pasteur, who was present at the meeting, 'that\r\nat this day such a scientific heresy should be held? My answer to Dr.\r\nBastian will be short. Take the limb of an animal and crush it in a\r\nmortar; let there be diffused in this limb, around these crushed bones,\r\nas much blood, or any other normal or abnormal liquid as you please.\r\nTake care only that the skin of the limb is neither torn nor laid open,\r\nand I defy you to exhibit on the following day, or during all the time\r\nthe malady lasts, the least microscopic organism in the humours of this\r\nlimb.'\r\n\r\nAfter the example of Liebig in 1870, Dr. Bastian did not accept the\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nBut if a disease like splenic fever is carried by a microbe, this\r\nmicrobe is under the influence of the medium in which it finds itself.\r\nIt does not develop everywhere. Easily inoculable and fatal to the\r\nox, the sheep, the rabbit, and the guinea pig, splenic fever is very\r\nrare in the dog and in the pig. These must be inoculated several times\r\nbefore they contract the disease, and even then it is not always\r\npossible to produce it. Again, there are some creatures which are never\r\nassailable by it. It can never be taken by fowls. In vain they are\r\ninoculated with a considerable quantity of splenic blood; it has no\r\neffect upon them. This invulnerability had very much struck Pasteur\r\nand his two assistants, Joubert and Chamberland. What was it in the\r\nbody of a fowl that enabled it to thus resist inoculations of which\r\nthe most infinitesimal quantity sufficed to kill an ox? They proved\r\nby a series of experiments that the microbe of splenic fever does not\r\ndevelop when subjected to a temperature of 44° Centigrade. Now, the\r\ntemperature of birds being between 41 and 42 degrees, may it not be,\r\nsaid Pasteur, that the fowls are protected from the disease because\r\ntheir blood is too warm--not far removed from the temperature at which\r\nthe splenic fever organism can no longer be cultivated? Might not the\r\nvital resistance encountered in the living fowl suffice to bridge over\r\nthe small gap between 41-42, and 44-45 degrees? For we must always\r\nallow for a certain resistance in all living creatures to disease and\r\ndeath. No doubt, life to a parasite in the body of an animal would not\r\nbe as easy as in a cultivating liquid contained in a glass vessel. If\r\nthe inoculating microbe is aerobic, it can only be cultivated in blood\r\nby taking away the oxygen from the globules, which retain it with a\r\ncertain force for their own life. Nothing was more legitimate than to\r\nsuppose that the globules of the blood of the fowl had such an avidity\r\nfor oxygen that the filaments of the splenic parasite were deprived of\r\nit, and that their multiplication was thus rendered impossible. This\r\nidea conducted Pasteur and his assistants to new researches. 'If the\r\nblood of a fowl was cooled,' they asked, 'could not the splenic fever\r\nparasite live in this blood?'\r\n\r\nThe experiment was made. A hen was taken, and, after inoculating it\r\nwith splenic fever blood, it was placed with its feet in water at 25\r\ndegrees. The temperature of the blood of the hen went down to 37 or 38\r\ndegrees. At the end of twenty-four hours the hen was dead, and all its\r\nblood was filled with splenic fever bacteria.\r\n\r\nBut if it was possible to render a fowl assailable by splenic fever\r\nsimply by lowering its temperature, is it not also possible to restore\r\nto health a fowl so inoculated by warming it up again? A hen was\r\ninoculated, subjected, like the first, to the cold-water treatment, and\r\nwhen it became evident that the fever was at its height it was taken\r\nout of the water, wrapped carefully in cotton wool, and placed in an\r\noven at a temperature of 35 degrees. Little by little its strength\r\nreturned; it shook itself, settled itself again, and in a few hours\r\nwas fully restored to health. The microbe had disappeared. Hens killed\r\nafter having been thus saved, no longer showed the slightest trace of\r\nsplenic organisms.\r\n\r\nHow great is the light which these facts throw upon the phenomenon\r\nof life in its relation to external physical conditions, and what\r\nimportant inferences do they warrant as to the influence of external\r\nmedia and conditions upon the life and development of living contagia!\r\nThere have been great discussions in Germany and France upon a mode\r\nof treatment in typhoid fever, which consists in cooling the body of\r\nthe patient by frequently repeated baths. The possible good effects of\r\nthis treatment may be understood when viewed in conjunction with the\r\nforegoing experiment on fowls. In typhoid fever the cold arrests the\r\nfermentation, which may be regarded as at once the expression and the\r\ncause of the disease, just as, by an inverse process, the heat of the\r\nbody arrests the development of the splenic fever microbe in the hen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _FOWL CHOLERA._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf fowls are naturally impervious to the infection of splenic\r\nfever, there is a disastrous malady to which they are subject, and\r\nwhich is commonly called 'fowl cholera.' Pasteur thus describes the\r\ndisorder:--'The bird which is attacked by this disease is without\r\nstrength, staggering, the wings drooping. The ruffled feathers of the\r\nbody give it the shape of a ball. An overpowering somnolence takes\r\npossession of it. If forced to open its eyes, it appears as if it were\r\nawakened out of a deep sleep. Very soon the eyelids close again, and\r\ngenerally death comes without the animal changing its place, or without\r\nany struggle, except at times a slight movement of the wings for a few\r\nseconds.' The examination after death reveals considerable internal\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nHere, again, the disease is produced by a microscopic organism. A\r\nveterinary surgeon of Alsace, M. Moritz by name, was the first who\r\nsuspected the presence of microbes in this disease; a veterinary\r\nsurgeon of Turin, M. Peroncito, depicted it in 1878; a professor of\r\nthe veterinary school of Toulouse, M. Toussaint, recognised it, in his\r\nturn, in 1879, and sent to Pasteur the head of a cock which had died\r\nof the cholera. But, however skilful they were, these observers had\r\nnot succeeded in deciding the question of parasitism. None of them had\r\nhit upon a suitable cultivating medium for the parasite, nor had they\r\nreared it in successive crops. This, however, is the only method of\r\nproving that the virulence belongs exclusively to a parasite.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary, in the study of maladies caused by\r\nmicroscopic organisms, to procure a liquid where the infectious\r\nparasite can grow and multiply without possible mixture of other\r\norganisms of different kinds. An infusion of the muscles of the fowl,\r\nneutralised by potash, and rendered sterile by a temperature of 110 to\r\n115 degrees, has proved to be wonderfully appropriate to the culture of\r\nthe microbe of fowl cholera. The facility of its multiplication in this\r\nmedium is almost miraculous. In some hours the clearest infusion begins\r\nto grow turbid, and is found to be filled with a multitude of little\r\norganisms of an extreme tenuity slightly strangulated at their centres.\r\nThese organisms have no movement of their own. In some days they change\r\ninto a multitude of isolated specks, so diminished in volume that\r\nthe liquid, which had been turbid to the extent of resembling milk,\r\nbecomes again almost as clear as at first. The microbe here described\r\nbelongs to a totally different group from that of the vibrios. It is\r\nranged under the genus called 'micrococci.' 'It is in this group,' said\r\nPasteur on one occasion, 'that the microbes of the viruses which are\r\nyet unknown will probably be one day found.'\r\n\r\nIn the cultivation of the microbe of fowl cholera, Pasteur tried one\r\nof the cultivating liquids which he had previously made use of with\r\nmost success--the water of yeast--that is to say, a decoction of\r\nyeast in water rendered clear by filtration and then sterilised by a\r\ntemperature of over 100 degrees. The most diverse microscopic organisms\r\nfind in this liquid suitable nourishment, particularly if it has been\r\nneutralised. When, for example, the bacterium of splenic fever is sown\r\nin the liquid, it assumes in a few hours a surprising development.\r\nNow, it is remarkable that this medium is quite unsuited to the life\r\nof the microbe of fowl cholera. Not only does it not develop, but the\r\nmicrobe perishes in this liquid in less than forty-eight hours. May\r\nwe not connect this singular fact with that which is observed when\r\na microscopic organism proves innocuous in an animal which has been\r\ninoculated with it? It is innocuous because it cannot develop itself in\r\nthe body of the animal, or because, its development being arrested, it\r\ncannot attain the vital organs.\r\n\r\nThe decoction extracted from the muscles of the fowl is the only\r\nmedium which really suits the microbe of fowl cholera. It suffices\r\nto inoculate the fowl with the hundredth, even the thousandth, part\r\nof a drop of this mixture, to produce the disease and cause death.\r\nBut here is a strange peculiarity. If guinea-pigs are inoculated with\r\nthis little parasite they are hardly ever killed by it. Guinea-pigs\r\nof a certain age generally exhibit only a local lesion at the point\r\nof inoculation, which ends in an abscess more or less prominent.\r\nAfter opening spontaneously, the abscess closes again and heals,\r\nwhile the animal preserves its appetite and its appearance of health.\r\nThese abscesses sometimes last several weeks. They are surrounded\r\nby a pyogenic membrane and filled with a creamy pus, in which the\r\nmicrobe swarms side by side with the pus globules. It is the life of\r\nthe microbe inoculated under the skin which causes the abscess. The\r\nabscess, with the membrane which surrounds it, becomes for the little\r\norganism a sort of closed vessel, which it is even easy to tap without\r\nsacrificing the guinea-pig. The organism is mixed with the pus in a\r\nstate of great purity, and although it is localised its virulence is\r\nextreme. When fowls are inoculated with the contents of the abscess\r\nthey die rapidly, while the guinea-pig, which has furnished the virus,\r\ngets well without the least suffering. A curious instance this is of\r\nthe local evolution of a very virulent microscopic organism, which\r\nproduces neither internal disorders nor the death of the animal\r\nupon which it lives and multiplies, but which can carry death to\r\nother species inoculated with it. Fowls and rabbits living among the\r\nguinea-pigs suffering from these abscesses might in a moment be smitten\r\nand perish, while the health of the guinea-pigs remained unchanged. To\r\nproduce this result it would suffice that a little of the discharge\r\nfrom the abscess of a guinea-pig should get smeared over the food of\r\nthe fowls and rabbits. An observer witnessing such deaths without\r\napparent cause, and ignorant of this strange dependency, would no doubt\r\nbe tempted to believe in the spontaneity of the disease. He would be\r\nfar from supposing that the evil had originated in the guinea-pigs,\r\nwhich were all in good health. In the history of contagia what\r\nmysteries may some day be cleared up by even more simple solutions than\r\nthis one!\r\n\r\nWhen some drops of the liquid containing this microbe are placed on\r\nthe food of fowls, the disease penetrates by the intestinal canal.\r\nThere the little organism increases in such great abundance that\r\ninoculation with the excrements of the injected fowls produces death.\r\nIt is thus easy to account for the mode of propagation of this very\r\nserious disease, which depopulates sometimes all the poultry yards in\r\nthe country. The only means of arresting the contagion is to isolate,\r\nfor a few days only, the fowls and the chickens, to remove the dung\r\nheaps, to wash the yard thoroughly, especially with water acidulated\r\nwith a little sulphuric acid, or carbolised water with two grammes of\r\nacid to the litre. These liquids readily destroy the microbe, or at\r\nleast suspend its development. Thus all causes of contagion disappear,\r\nbecause, during their isolation, the animals already smitten die. The\r\naction of the disease, in fact, is very rapid.\r\n\r\nThe repeated cultivation of the infectious microbe in the fowl\r\ninfusion, passing always from one infusion to the next following,\r\nby sowing in the latter an infinitely small quantity, so to speak,\r\nof the virus--as much, for example, as may be retained on the point\r\nof a needle simply plunged into the cultivation--does not sensibly\r\nlessen the virulence of the microscopic organism. Its multiplication\r\ninside the bodies of fowls is quite as easy with the last as with the\r\nfirst culture. In short, whatever may be the number of the successive\r\ncultures of the microbe in the fowl infusion, the last culture is\r\nstill very virulent. This proves the microbe to be the cause of the\r\ndisease--a proof the same in kind as that which had already enabled\r\nPasteur to show that splenic fever and septicæmia are produced by\r\nspecific microbes.\r\n\r\nLike the bacillus of splenic fever, the microbe of the fowl cholera is\r\nan aerobic organism. It is cultivated in contact with the air, or in\r\naerated liquids. At the same time, though it is entitled to be called\r\nan aerobic organism, it differs essentially in certain respects from\r\nthe parasite of splenic fever. If splenic fever blood filled with\r\nfilaments of the parasite be enclosed in a vessel protected from the\r\nair--say, in a tube closed at its two extremities--in a few days,\r\neight or ten at the most, and much fewer in summer, the parasite\r\ndisappears, or rather is reduced to fine amorphous granulations, and\r\nthe blood loses all its virulence. If the same system of shutting out\r\nthe air be employed with the blood of a fowl charged with the microbe\r\nof fowl cholera, this microbe will be preserved with its virulence for\r\nweeks, months, even years. Pasteur has been able to keep for three\r\nyears tubes thus sealed, a drop of blood from which when cultivated\r\nin fowl infusion, sufficed to infect the birds in the poultry yard\r\nwith cholera. And not only is the microbe preserved thus in the blood\r\ncontained in the tube; the same occurs if fowl infusion be put into\r\ntubes and then sealed by the flame of a lamp.\r\n\r\nWhen, in course of time, such tubes lose their virulence, it is because\r\nthe vitality of the organism is extinct. The moment the contents of the\r\ntube cease to be virulent, it is a sign that the contagium is dead. It\r\nis useless, then, to attempt to cultivate it: the microbe cannot be\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a third virulent disease, also produced by a microscopic\r\norganism. The characteristics of fowl cholera are very different\r\nfrom those of splenic fever and acute septicemia, and these three\r\nmicrobes do not in the least resemble each other. But, glancing back\r\nover Pasteur's work, are not the diseases of silkworms, pébrine and\r\nflacherie, also virulent diseases? Thus, in so many things, through\r\nso many studies, the same connection holds good. Each discovery of\r\nPasteur's is linked to those which precede it, and is the rigorous\r\nverification by experimental method of a preconceived idea.\r\n\r\n'Nothing can be done,' said he one day, 'without preconceived ideas;\r\nonly there must be the wisdom not to accept their deductions beyond\r\nwhat experiments confirm. Preconceived ideas, subjected to the severe\r\ncontrol of experimentation, are the vivifying flame of scientific\r\nobservation, whilst fixed ideas are its danger. Do you remember the\r\nfine saying of Bossuet? \"The greatest sign of an ill-regulated mind is\r\nto believe things because you wish them to be so.\" To choose a road, to\r\nstop habitually and to ask whether you have not gone astray, that is\r\nthe true method.'\r\n\r\nIt is this method which conducted him in 1880 to that wonderful\r\ndiscovery, the attenuation of contagia. What certain of these contagia\r\nare, we have already seen. We shall now learn what they become in the\r\nhands of Pasteur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     _THE ATTENUATED VIRUS, OR VACCINATION OF VIRULENT DISEASES._\r\n\r\n                     THE VACCINE OF FOWL CHOLERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the scourges which afflict humanity there are none greater\r\nthan virulent diseases. Measles, scarlatina, diphtheria, small-pox,\r\nsyphilis, splenic fever, yellow fever, camp typhus, the plague of\r\nthe East--what a terrible enumeration! I pass over some, such as\r\nglanders, leprosy, and hydrophobia. The history of these diseases\r\npresents extraordinary circumstances. The most strange, assuredly,\r\nis that which has been from all time established with a great number\r\nof these diseases, that they are non-recurrent. As a general rule,\r\nnotwithstanding some rare exceptions, man can only have measles,\r\nscarlet fever, plague, yellow fever once. What explanation, even\r\nhypothetically, can be given of such a fact? Still more difficult is it\r\nto explain how vaccination, which is itself a virulent though benign\r\ndisease, preserves from a more serious malady, the small-pox? Has\r\nthere ever been a discovery more mysterious in its causes and origin,\r\nstanding, as it does, alone in the history of medicine, and for more\r\nthan a century defying all comparison?\r\n\r\nAfter dwelling long on Jenner's discovery this question arose in\r\nPasteur's mind: If contagious maladies do not repeat themselves, why\r\nshould there not be found for each of them a disease different from\r\nthem, but having some likeness to them, which, acting upon them as\r\ncow-pox does upon small-pox, would have the virtue of a prophylactic? A\r\nchance occurrence, one of those chances which not unfrequently occur to\r\nthose who are steadfastly looking out for them, opened out to Pasteur\r\nthe way to a discovery which may well be called one of the greatest\r\ndiscoveries of the age.\r\n\r\nIn causing the microbe of fowl cholera to pass from culture to culture,\r\nin an artificial medium, a sufficient number of times to render it\r\nimpossible that the least trace of the virulent matter from which it\r\noriginally started should still exist in the last cultivation, Pasteur\r\ngave in an absolute manner the proof that infectious microbes are the\r\nsole authors of the diseases which correspond to them. This culture\r\nmay be repeated ten, twenty, a hundred, even a thousand times: in the\r\nlatest culture the virulence is not extinguished, or even sensibly\r\nweakened. But it is a fact worthy of attention that the preservation\r\nof the virulence in successive cultures is assured only when no great\r\ninterval has been allowed to elapse between the cultures. For example,\r\nthe second culture must be sown twenty-four hours after the first, the\r\nthird twenty-four hours after the second, the hundredth twenty-four\r\nhours after the ninety-ninth, and so on. If a culture is not passed on\r\nto the following one until after an interval of several days or several\r\nweeks, and particularly if several months have elapsed, a great change\r\nmay then be observed in the virulence. This change, which generally\r\nvaries with the duration of the interval, shows itself by the weakening\r\nof the power of the contagium.\r\n\r\nIf the successive cultures of fowl cholera, made at short intervals,\r\nhave such virulence that ten or twenty inoculated birds perish in\r\nthe space of twenty-four or forty-eight hours, a culture which has\r\nremained, say, for three months in its flask, the mouth of which has\r\nbeen protected from the introduction of all foreign germs by a stopper\r\nof cotton wool, which allows nothing but pure air to pass through\r\nit--this culture, if used to inoculate twenty fowls, though it may\r\nrender them more or less ill, does not cause death in any of them.\r\nAfter some days of fever they recover both their appetite and spirits.\r\nBut if this phenomenon is extraordinary, here is one which is surely\r\nin a different sense singular. If after the cure of these twenty birds\r\nthey are reinoculated with a very virulent virus--that, for instance,\r\nwhich was just now mentioned as capable of killing its hundred per\r\ncent. of those inoculated with it, in twenty-four or forty-eight\r\nhours--these fowls would perhaps become rather ill, but they would not\r\ndie. The conclusion is simple; the disease can protect _from_ itself.\r\nIt has evidently that characteristic of all virulent diseases, that it\r\ncannot attack a second time.\r\n\r\nHowever curious it may be, this characteristic is not a thing unknown\r\nin pathology. Formerly it was the custom to inoculate with small-pox to\r\npreserve from small-pox. Sheep are still inoculated to preserve them\r\nfrom the _rot_; to protect horned cattle from peripneumonia they are\r\ninoculated with the virus of the disease. Fowl cholera offers the same\r\nimmunity; it is an additional scientific acquisition, but not a novelty\r\nin principle.\r\n\r\nThe great novelty which is the outcome of the preceding facts, and\r\nwhich gives them a distinct place in our knowledge of virulent\r\ndiseases, is that we have here to do with a disease of which the\r\nvirulent agent is a microscopic parasite, a living organism cultivated\r\noutside of the animal body, and that the attenuation of the virulence\r\nis in the power of the experimenter. He creates it, he diminishes it,\r\nhe does what he wishes with it; and all these variable virulences he\r\nobtains from the maximum virulence by manipulation in the laboratory.\r\nLooked at in juxtaposition with the great fact of vaccination for\r\nsmall-pox, this weakened microbe, which does not cause death, behaves\r\nlike a real vaccine relatively to the microbe which kills, producing a\r\nmalady which may be called benign, since it does not cause death, but\r\nis a protection from the same malady in its more deadly form.\r\n\r\nBut for this enfeebled microbe to be a real vaccine, comparable to that\r\nof cow-pox, must it not be fixed, so to speak, in its own variety, so\r\nthat there should be no necessity for having recourse again to the\r\npreparation from which it was originally derived? Jenner, when he had\r\ndemonstrated that cow-pox vaccination preserved from small-pox, feared\r\nfor some time that it would be always necessary to have recourse to the\r\ncow to procure fresh vaccinating matter. His true discovery consisted\r\nin establishing that the cow-pox from the cow could be dispensed with,\r\nand that inoculation could be performed from arm to arm. Pasteur made\r\nhis enfeebled microbe pass from one cultivation to another. What would\r\nit become? Would it resume its very active virulence, or would it\r\npreserve its moderate virulence?\r\n\r\nThe virulence remained enfeebled and, we may say, unchanged. This\r\nshowed it to be a real vaccine. Some veterinary surgeons and farmers,\r\non the announcement of this discovery, applied to Pasteur for a vaccine\r\nagainst the disease which was so disastrous among their poultry. Some\r\ntrials were made, and all succeeded beyond expectation. To preserve\r\nthis vaccine it must be secured from contact with the air, the cultures\r\nbeing enclosed in tubes, the extremities of which are sealed by the\r\nflame of a blowpipe.\r\n\r\nWhat takes place during that interval of time intentionally placed\r\nbetween two successive cultivations of the cholera microbe--that\r\ninterval which is employed in effecting the attenuation and producing\r\nthe vaccine? What is the secret of this result? The agent which\r\nintervenes is no other than the oxygen of the air. Here is the proof.\r\nIf the cultivation of this microbe is carried on in a tube containing\r\nvery little air, and if the tube is then closed by the flame of a lamp,\r\nthe microbe, by its development and life, quickly appropriates all the\r\nfree oxygen contained in the tube, as well as the oxygen dissolved in\r\nthe liquid. Thus, completely protected from contact with oxygen, the\r\nmicrobe does not become sensibly weakened for months, sometimes even\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen of the air, then, appears to be the cause of modification in\r\nthe virulence of the microbe.\r\n\r\nBut how, then, is the absence of influence on the part of the\r\natmospheric oxygen, in the successive cultures which are practised\r\nevery twenty-four hours, to be explained? There is, in Pasteur's\r\nopinion, but one possible explanation; it is that the oxygen of the air\r\nin this latter case is solely employed in the life of the microbe. A\r\nculture has a duration of some days; in twenty-four hours it is not\r\nterminated. The air which comes in contact with it is then entirely\r\nemployed in nourishing and largely reproducing the microbe. During the\r\nlonger intervals of culture, the air acts only as a modifier, and at\r\nlast there arrives a moment when the virulence is so much weakened as\r\nto become nil.\r\n\r\nThis very extraordinary fact is, then, established that the virulence\r\nmay be entirely gone while yet the microbe lives. The cultures offer\r\nthe spectacle of a microbe indefinitely cultivable, yet, on the other\r\nhand, incapable of living in the bodies of fowls, and in consequence\r\ndeprived of virulence. May not this domesticated microbe, as M. Bouley\r\ncalls it, be compared to those inoffensive microbes of which there are\r\nso many in nature? May not our common microbes be those organisms which\r\nhave lost their former virulence? But may not these harmless microbes,\r\nbecome infectious in some particular circumstances? And if there are\r\nfewer virulent maladies now than there were in times past, might not\r\nthe number of these maladies again increase?\r\n\r\nQuestions multiply as the facts relating to the attenuation of a virus\r\nsuggest inductions, awaken ideas, and throw new lights upon a problem\r\nwhich, until within these last few years, has remained so obscure.\r\nFormerly it was believed that these viruses were morbid entities.\r\nA virus was a unity. This opinion has still its declared upholders.\r\nAccording to Pasteur a virus has different degrees of virulence; it can\r\npass from the weakest virulence to the maximum. Modifying, at will, the\r\nvirus of fowl cholera, Pasteur inoculates some hens, for instance, with\r\na virus too attenuated to protect from death, but which nevertheless\r\nis effectual in securing them against a virus stronger than itself.\r\nThe second virus will preserve them from the attacks of a third virus,\r\nand thus passing from virus to virus they end by being guaranteed\r\nagainst the most deadly virulences. The whole question of vaccination\r\nresolves itself into knowing at what moment a certain degree of virus\r\nattenuation is a guarantee of protection against the mortal virus.\r\n\r\nIt seems that between small-pox and cow-pox facts of a similar kind\r\ntake place. It is probable that vaccination rarely gives perfect\r\nsecurity against the infection of a very malignant small-pox; moreover,\r\nduring epidemics of small-pox many persons who have been previously\r\nvaccinated are attacked, and some even die of the disease.\r\n\r\nAs regards the practice of vaccinating fowls against the cholera\r\npeculiar to them--which, though it certainly is not of the same\r\nimportance as human vaccination, is a scientifically _capital_ fact--we\r\nmay hope that whatever the differences of receptivity in different\r\nraces, or in different individuals of the same race, there will be\r\nfound vaccines to suit them all, special care being taken to resort to\r\nthe employment of two successive vaccines of unequal power, employed\r\nafter an interval of ten or fifteen days. The first vaccine may always\r\nbe chosen of a degree of weakness which will not in any case cause\r\ndeath, and yet of sufficient strength to prevent dangerous consequences\r\nfrom the second vaccine, which would in some cases be fatal if employed\r\nat once, and to enable it to act as a vaccine against the most virulent\r\nvirus.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the preparation of vaccines, and the ascertaining of\r\ntheir proper strength, it is necessary to make trials upon a certain\r\nnumber of fowls, even at the risk of sacrificing a few in these\r\npreliminary experiments. Beyond such questions of manipulation there\r\nremains still a scientific question. How are the effects of vaccination\r\nto be conceived? What explanation can be given of the fact that a\r\nbenign disease can preserve from a more serious and deadly one? Pasteur\r\nlong sought for the solution of this problem. Without flattering\r\nhimself that he has unravelled the difficulty, he has nevertheless\r\namassed facts which, amid these physiological mysteries, permit us to\r\nframe a hypothesis which can satisfy the mind. Pasteur believes, for\r\nexample, that the vaccine, when cultivated in the body of the animal,\r\nrobs the globules of the blood, for example, of certain material\r\nprinciples which the vital actions take a long time to restore to the\r\nsystem, and which to the most deadly contagium is a condition of life.\r\nThe impossibility of action of the progressive virus and of the deadly\r\nvirus is thus accounted for.\r\n\r\nWhen Pasteur communicated to the Academy of Sciences these important\r\nand unforeseen facts, they were at first received with hesitation.\r\nIt was not without some surprise that the word vaccination, hitherto\r\nexclusively reserved for Jenner's discovery, was heard applied to\r\nfowl cholera. At the International Medical Congress held in London in\r\nAugust 1881, Pasteur, in the presence of 3,000 doctors of medicine\r\nfrom all parts of the world, who received him with an enthusiasm which\r\nreflected glory on France, justified the name that he had given to his\r\nprophylactic experiments.\r\n\r\n'I have lent,' he said, 'to the expression vaccination an extension\r\nthat I hope science will consecrate, as a homage to the merit and\r\nimmense services rendered to humanity by one of the greatest men of\r\nEngland--Jenner.'\r\n\r\nStill, while rendering homage to the sentiment which induced Pasteur\r\nto efface himself in favour of Jenner, we may be permitted to say that\r\nthere is no likeness between the two discoveries. Great as was the\r\ndiscovery of Jenner, it was but a chance observation, which had no\r\nulterior development; and for a whole century, medicine has not been\r\nable to derive anything from it beyond its actual application, which\r\nis the one result achieved. 'Vaccination is vaccination,' an opponent\r\nof Pasteur's, who was driven hard, was obliged to say. The opponent\r\nfound no other answer, and he could not have found any other. The\r\ncow-pox is a malady belonging exclusively to a race of animals. Man\r\ncan only observe it; he cannot produce it. Suppress cow-pox and there\r\nwill be no more vaccination. In the French discovery, on the contrary,\r\nit is the deadly virus itself which serves as a starting point for\r\nthe vaccine. It is the hand of man which makes the vaccine, and this\r\nvaccine may be artificially prepared in the laboratory, in sufficient\r\nquantity to supply all needs. What a future is presented to the mind\r\nin the thought that the virus and its vaccines are a living species,\r\nand that in this species there are all sorts of varieties susceptible\r\nof being fixed by artificial cultivation! The genius of Jenner made a\r\ndiscovery, but Pasteur discovered a method of genius.\r\n\r\n'This is but a beginning,' said M. Bouley on the day when Pasteur\r\nannounced these facts to the Academy of Sciences. 'A new doctrine\r\nopens itself in medicine, and this doctrine appears to me powerful\r\nand luminous. A great future is preparing; I wait for it with the\r\nconfidence of a believer and with the zeal of an enthusiast.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _THE VACCINE OF SPLENIC FEVER._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the facts have been established with regard to the\r\nmicrobe of fowl cholera. Immunity against a virulent disease may be\r\nobtained by the influence of a benign malady which is induced by the\r\nsame microbe, only weakened in virulence. What a future there would be\r\nfor medicine if this method could be applied to the prevention of all\r\nvirulent diseases! As splenic fever was at that time being studied in\r\nthe laboratory of the École Normale, it was upon this fever that the\r\nresearch was first attempted. But the success of this research, said\r\nPasteur, can only be hoped for if the disease is non-recurrent. It\r\nis only in this case that inoculation with the weakened microbe can\r\nprotect from the deadly splenic fever. Unfortunately, human medicine\r\nis dumb as regards this question of non-recurrence. The man who is\r\nsmitten with malignant pustule rarely recovers. If there are any\r\ncases of recovery--and there are some authentic ones--he who has so\r\nnarrowly escaped death could not confidently count upon his chance of\r\nprotection from the disease in future. In order to acquire such a\r\nsense of security he would have to expose himself to experiments of\r\ndirect inoculation, which he would hardly care to do. Animals alone\r\noffer the possibility of solving this problem. Yet it is not to all\r\nspecies of animals that we can have recourse. Every sheep inoculated\r\nwith splenic fever infection is a sheep lost; but the ox and the cow\r\nhave more power of resistance. Among them there are frequent cases of\r\ncure. An incident occurred which enabled Pasteur to push very far this\r\nexperimental study.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 the Minister of Agriculture appointed him to give judgment upon\r\nthe value of a proposed mode of cure for cows smitten with splenic\r\nfever, which had been devised by M. Louvrier, a veterinary surgeon\r\nof the Jura. Choosing M. Chamberland as his assistant to watch the\r\napplication of M. Louvrier's remedy, Pasteur instituted a series of\r\ncomparative experiments. Some cows were inoculated, two and sometimes\r\nfour at a time, with the virulent splenic fever virus. Half of these\r\ncows were treated by M. Louvrier's method; the other half were left\r\nwithout treatment. A certain number of the cows under M. Louvrier's\r\ncare resisted the disease, but an equal number of those not under\r\ntreatment recovered also. The inefficacy of the remedy was demonstrated\r\nas well as the cause of the inventor's illusions. But one precious\r\nresult remained from the trial of this remedy. Pasteur and Chamberland\r\nhad thus at their disposition several cows which had recovered from\r\nsplenic fever, and which had experienced in their attack all the worst\r\nsymptoms. At the places of inoculation enormous swellings were formed,\r\nwhich extended to the limbs, or under the abdomen, and which contained\r\nseveral quarts of watery fluid. The fever had been intense, and at one\r\ntime death had appeared imminent. When these cows recovered they were\r\nreinoculated with great quantities of virulent virus. Not the least\r\ntrace of disease showed itself, even in cases where the inoculation was\r\nperformed after an interval of more than a year.\r\n\r\nThe question was solved; splenic fever, like most of the virulent\r\ndiseases which it has been possible to study, was non-recurrent. The\r\nimmunity obtained has a long duration. With that valiant ardour which\r\nalways urges him on, Pasteur next proposed to examine the vaccine of\r\nsplenic fever. In view of these new investigations, which would require\r\nlong and careful labours, and which necessitated a certain amount of\r\nmedical knowledge, Pasteur associated with himself, in addition to M.\r\nChamberland, a young savant, now a doctor of medicine, M. Roux.\r\n\r\nFollowing the rigorous course of his deductions, Pasteur naturally\r\nturned to the oxygen of the air in his attempts to modify the virulence\r\nof the splenic microbe. But a difficulty presented itself at the\r\noutset. Between this microbe and the microbe of fowl cholera there\r\nexists an essential difference. The microbe of fowl cholera, as is the\r\ncase with a great number of microscopic organisms, reproduces itself\r\nonly by fission. The parasite of splenic fever, on the contrary, has\r\nanother mode of generation; it forms spores, nothing analogous to which\r\nis found in the microbe of cholera.\r\n\r\nIn the blood of animals, as in the cultures at the beginning, the\r\nsplenic fever microbe appears at first in transparent filaments, more\r\nor less divided into segments. Up to that point, the resemblance\r\nbetween the microbe of splenic fever and the microbe of cholera is\r\ncomplete. But this blood, or the cultures exposed to the free contact\r\nof the air, instead of continuing this first mode of generation,\r\nfrequently exhibit, even in the course of twenty-four hours, spores\r\ndistributed more or less regularly along the length of the filaments.\r\nAll around these corpuscles the matter of the filaments is absorbed,\r\nin the manner formerly illustrated by Pasteur in the diagrams of\r\nhis work on the diseases of silkworms, when treating of the bacilli\r\nof putrefaction. Little by little, all cohesion between the spores\r\ndisappears, and the whole collection soon forms nothing more than\r\na dust of germs. But--and here lies the great difficulty which\r\nexperimenters encountered in applying to splenic fever the method\r\nof gradual attenuation which was practised with the microbe of\r\ncholera--these germs of splenic fever may be exposed for years to\r\nthe air without losing their virulence, always ready to reproduce\r\nthemselves without any appreciable change, and to manifest their\r\neffects in the bodies of animals. How can it be hoped to discover a\r\nvaccine of splenic fever by the method used with the contagium of fowl\r\ncholera, since the splenic fever virulence, at the end of twenty-four\r\nhours, is concentrated in a spore? Before the oxygen of the air has had\r\ntime to attenuate the contagium, the virulence of the parasite would be\r\nencased in these spores. Yet this objection did not appear insuperable\r\nto Pasteur. Since (said he to himself), under its filamentous form,\r\nthe microbe of splenic fever is quite analogous to the microbe of fowl\r\ncholera, may not the problem of exposing the splenic microbe to the\r\nair be reduced to the following one: to determine the conditions which\r\nwould prevent the production of spores? The difficulty would thus\r\nbe surmounted; for, once we have got rid of the spores, the splenic\r\nfilaments might be maintained in contact with air for any length of\r\ntime, and we might then no doubt fall back upon the conditions which\r\nhad produced the attenuation of the cholera microbe.\r\n\r\nPasteur and his two assistants gave themselves up to this research.\r\nDays passed and experiments were multiplied. Pasteur became more and\r\nmore engrossed: he had, what his daughter called, 'the face of an\r\napproaching discovery.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! what a grand thing it would be,' he was heard from time to time\r\nto murmur to himself with a suppressed voice, 'if one could arrive at\r\nthat--if the fact that the attenuation of the microbe of fowl cholera\r\nproved not to be an isolated one!' But if anyone ventured to ask him a\r\ntimid question as to the phase his experiments were going through, he\r\nwould reply, 'No, I can tell you nothing. I dare not express aloud what\r\nI hope.'\r\n\r\nAt last one day he came up from his laboratory with a triumphant face.\r\nHis joy was such that tears stood in his eyes. I have never seen a\r\nmore radiant expression of the highest and most generous emotions than\r\nemanated from his countenance.\r\n\r\n'I should never console myself,' he said while embracing us, 'if a\r\ndiscovery such as my assistants and I have just made were not a French\r\ndiscovery.'\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd with the clearness which is the charm of this powerful mind, he\r\nrelated to us the most recent discoveries of his laboratory.\r\n\r\nIn neutralised chicken infusion the splenic microbe can no longer be\r\ncultivated at a temperature of 44 or 45 degrees. Its cultivation, on\r\nthe contrary, is easy at 42 or 43 degrees; and in these conditions the\r\nmicrobe produces no spores. At this latter temperature, therefore,\r\nand in contact with pure air, we can maintain a culture of filamentous\r\nparasites of splenic fever, deprived of all germs. In some weeks the\r\ncrop dies--that is to say, when this culture is sown in fresh broth\r\nthe sterility of the broth remains complete. But during the preceding\r\ndays life exists in the cultivating liquid. If after two, four, six, or\r\neight days of exposure to the air and to heat, the contagium is tried\r\nupon animals, its virulence is found to be continually changing with\r\nthe time of its exposure to the air, and, consequently, it represents\r\na series of attenuated contagia. From the moment when the formation\r\nof the spores of the splenic fever bacillus is prevented, all becomes\r\nsubstantially the same as in the case of the microbe of fowl cholera.\r\nMoreover, as in the cholera microbe, each of these states of attenuated\r\nvirulence can be reproduced by cultivation. Finally, splenic fever not\r\nbeing recurrent, each of these splenic fever microbes constitutes a\r\nvaccine for the more virulent microbe.\r\n\r\nIn order to apportion the virulence of the vaccine to the species\r\nit is desired to vaccinate, it must be tried on a certain number\r\nof individuals of the same species. If some vaccinated animals are\r\ninoculated with the virulent virus, and none of them perish, the\r\nvaccine is good. Among individuals of the same species, however,\r\nthe difference of receptivity is in general great enough to make it\r\nprudent, and even necessary, to have recourse to two vaccines, one\r\nweak and the other stronger, with an interval of from 12 to 15 days\r\nbetween the two inoculations.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was on February 28, 1881, that Pasteur communicated to the Academy\r\nof Sciences, in his own name, and in those of his two fellow workers,\r\nthe exposition of this great discovery. Loud applause burst forth with\r\npatriotic joy and pride. And yet so marvellous were these results that\r\nsome colleagues could not help saying, 'There is a little romance in\r\nall this.' All this reminds one, in fact, of what the alchemist of\r\nLesage did to the demons which annoyed him. He shut them up in little\r\nbottles, well corked, and so kept them imprisoned and inoffensive.\r\nPasteur shut up in glass bulbs a whole world of microbes, with all\r\nsorts of varieties which he cultivated at will. Virulences attenuated\r\nor terrible, diseases benign or deadly, he could offer all. Hardly had\r\nthe journals published the _compte-rendu_ of this communication when\r\nthe President of the Society of Agriculture in Melun, M. le Baron de la\r\nRochette, came, in the name of the Society, to invite Pasteur to make a\r\npublic experiment of splenic fever vaccination.\r\n\r\nPasteur accepted. On April 28 a sort of convention was entered\r\ninto between him and the Society. The Society agreed to place at\r\nthe disposal of Pasteur and his two young assistants, Chamberland\r\nand Roux, sixty sheep. Ten of these sheep were not to receive\r\nany treatment; twenty-five were to be subjected to two vaccinal\r\ninoculations at intervals of from twelve to fifteen days, by two\r\nvaccines of unequal strength. Some days later these twenty-five sheep,\r\nas well as the twenty-five remaining ones, were to be inoculated with\r\nthe virus of virulent splenic fever. A similar experiment was to be\r\nmade upon ten cows. Six were to be vaccinated, four not vaccinated; and\r\nthe ten cows were afterwards, on the same day as the fifty sheep, to\r\nreceive inoculation from a very virulent virus.\r\n\r\nPasteur affirmed that the twenty-five sheep which had not been\r\nvaccinated would perish, while the twenty-five vaccinated ones would\r\nresist the very virulent virus; that the six vaccinated cows would not\r\ntake the disease, while the four which had not been vaccinated, even if\r\nthey did not die, would at least be extremely ill.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the agricultural and scientific press had published this\r\nprogramme, and recorded Pasteur's prophecies, several of his colleagues\r\nat the Academy of Sciences, startled by such boldness in reference to a\r\nsubject which had hitherto been enveloped in such profound obscurity,\r\nand fearing to see the illustrious company somewhat compromised by\r\nthese affirmations in relation to problems of physiology and pathology,\r\naddressed some observations to M. Pasteur on what they called 'a\r\nscientific imprudence.'\r\n\r\n'Take care,' they said to him, 'you are committing yourself without\r\npossibility of retreat. Your experiments in the laboratory hardly\r\nauthorise you to attempt experiments like those at Melun.'\r\n\r\n'No doubt,' Pasteur answered, 'we have never had in our experimental\r\nstudies so many animals at our disposition to inoculate; but I have\r\nfull confidence. What has been already done in my laboratory is to me a\r\nguarantee of what can be done.'\r\n\r\nAnd M. Bouley, confident also in the assurances of his illustrious\r\nfriend, and arranging to meet him, to witness these audacious\r\nexperiments, said to his anxious colleagues, 'Fear nothing; he will\r\ncome back triumphant.'\r\n\r\nThe experiments began on May 5, 1881, at four kilometers' distance\r\nfrom Melun, in a farm of the commune of Pouilly-le-Fort, belonging to\r\na veterinary doctor, M. Rossignol, secretary-general of the Society\r\nof Melun. At the desire of the Society of Agriculture, a goat had\r\nbeen substituted for one of the twenty-five sheep of the first lot.\r\nOn the 5th of May they inoculated, by means of the little syringe of\r\nPravaz--that which is used in all hypodermic injections--twenty-four\r\nsheep, the goat, and six cows with five drops of an attenuated splenic\r\nvirus. Twelve days after, on May 17, they reinoculated these thirty-one\r\nanimals with an attenuated virus, which was, however, stronger than the\r\npreceding one.\r\n\r\nOn May 31 very virulent inoculation was effected. Veterinary doctors,\r\ninquisitive people, and agriculturists formed a crowd round this\r\nlittle flock. The thirty-one vaccinated subjects awaiting the terrible\r\ntrial stood side by side with the twenty-five sheep and the four cows,\r\nwhich awaited also their first turn of virulent inoculation. Upon the\r\nproposal of a veterinary doctor, who disguised his scepticism under the\r\nexpressed desire to render the trials more comparative, they inoculated\r\nalternately a vaccinated and a non-vaccinated animal. A meeting was\r\nthen arranged by Pasteur and all other persons present for Thursday,\r\nJune 2, thus allowing an interval of forty-eight hours after the\r\nvirulent inoculation.\r\n\r\nMore than two hundred persons met that day at Melun. The Prefect of\r\nSeine-et-Marne, M. Patinot, senators, general counsellors, journalists,\r\na great number of doctors, of veterinary surgeons, and farmers; those\r\nwho believed, and those who doubted, came, impatient for the result. On\r\ntheir arrival at the farm of Pouilly-le-Fort, they could not repress\r\na shout of admiration. Out of the twenty-five sheep which had not\r\nbeen vaccinated, twenty-one were dead; the goat was also dead; two\r\nother sheep were dying, and the last, already smitten, was certain\r\nto die that very evening. The non-vaccinated cows had all voluminous\r\nswellings at the point of inoculation, behind the shoulder. The fever\r\nwas intense, and they had no longer strength to eat. The vaccinated\r\nsheep were in full health and gaiety. The vaccinated cows showed no\r\ntumour; they had not even suffered an elevation of temperature, and\r\nthey continued to eat quietly.\r\n\r\nThere was a burst of enthusiasm at these truly marvellous results.\r\nThe veterinary surgeons especially, who had received with entire\r\nincredulity the anticipations recorded in the programme of the\r\nexperiments, who in their conversations and in their journals\r\nhad declared very loudly that it was difficult to believe in the\r\npossibility of preparing a vaccine capable of triumphing over such\r\ndeadly diseases as fowl cholera and splenic fever, could not recover\r\nfrom their surprise. They examined the dead, they felt the living.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said M. Bouley to one of them, 'are you convinced? There\r\nremains nothing for you to do but to bow before the master,' he added,\r\npointing to Pasteur, 'and to exclaim--\r\n\r\n             \"I see, I know, I believe, I am undeceived.\"'\r\n\r\nHaving suddenly become fervent apostles of the new doctrine, the\r\nveterinary surgeons went about proclaiming everywhere what they\r\nhad seen. One of those who had been the most sceptical carried his\r\nproselytising zeal to such a point that he wished to inoculate himself.\r\nHe did so with the two first vaccines, without other accident than a\r\nslight fever. It required all the efforts of his family to prevent him\r\nfrom inoculating himself with the most virulent virus.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary movement was everywhere produced in favour of\r\nvaccination. A great number of agricultural societies wished to repeat\r\nthe celebrated experiment of Pouilly-le-Fort. The breeders of cattle\r\noverwhelmed Pasteur with applications for vaccine. Pasteur was obliged\r\nto start a small manufactory for the preparation of these vaccines in\r\nthe Rue Vauquelin, a few paces from his laboratory. At the end of the\r\nyear 1881, he had already vaccinated 33,946 animals. This number was\r\ncomposed of 32,550 sheep, 1,254 oxen, 142 horses. In 1882, the number\r\nof animals vaccinated amounted to 399,102, which included 47,000 oxen\r\nand 2,000 horses. In 1883, 100,000 animals were added to the total of\r\n1882.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the practical application of this new system,\r\nthe results were topical. Among flocks where half had been vaccinated\r\nand the other half not vaccinated--all the animals continuing to live\r\ntogether--the mortality from splenic fever in 1881 was ten times less\r\nin the vaccinated sheep than in the non-vaccinated, being 1 in 740 as\r\nagainst 1 in 78; and in cows and oxen fourteen times less, being 1\r\nin 1,254 against 1 in 88. In 1882 also, the mortality was ten times\r\ngreater among the non-vaccinated than among the vaccinated animals.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 it was proved that the duration of the immunity generally\r\nlasted longer than a year. It is, however, prudent to vaccinate\r\nevery year, and to select for performing the operation a period when\r\nsplenic fever has not yet become developed--in March and April. If\r\nthe vaccinating is postponed until the fever is in the sheepfolds,\r\nthere is the risk of attributing to vaccination the losses which in\r\nreality belong to the natural disease. Just as human vaccination cannot\r\npreserve from small-pox a patient who is already under the influence of\r\nsmall-pox, so the splenic vaccinations are powerless against a fever\r\nalready in process of incubation.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that the duration of immunity to animals\r\nafter splenic vaccination cannot be compared with the duration of\r\nimmunity from small-pox after Jennerian vaccination. Jenner and his\r\ncontemporaries believed that vaccination was able to preserve from\r\nsmall-pox during the whole life. That illusion disappeared long ago,\r\nand now ten years has been fixed as the average duration of that\r\nimmunity and of the interval which ought to separate successive\r\nvaccinations. This interval, moreover, is too long for a certain\r\nnumber of individuals. Besides, in order to judge of the immunity of\r\nantisplenic vaccination, we must not lose sight of the formidable trial\r\nwhich vaccinated animals have to undergo when inoculated with the most\r\nvirulent virus. What doctor would dare to subject a vaccinated child\r\nto inoculation from virulent small-pox a year after its vaccination?\r\nFinally, taking into consideration the commercial and economic view of\r\nthe life of a sheep--if such an expression may be used--the average\r\nscarcely exceeds three years. The duration, then, of the immunity that\r\nvaccination confers is about a third of the duration of the animal's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _THE RETURN TO VIRULENCE._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having reduced the microbes of fowl cholera and splenic fever\r\nto all degrees of virulence, and brought them to a point where they\r\ncould no longer multiply in the bodies of animals inoculated with\r\nthem, and fixed them in media appropriate to their life, Pasteur asked\r\nhimself whether it would not be possible to restore to these attenuated\r\nmicrobes--weakened to such a degree as to have lost all virulence--a\r\ndeadly virulence, and to render them again capable of living and\r\nmultiplying in the bodies of animals.\r\n\r\nExperiment soon confirmed this mental prevision. An attenuated\r\nsplenic fever virus which could cause no danger of disease or death\r\nto guinea-pigs of a year, or a month, or even a week old, could kill\r\na little guinea-pig just born, or one or two days old. The attenuated\r\nmicrobe could multiply itself in the blood of so young an animal. We\r\ncan well imagine that in an animal, scarcely formed, the power of\r\noxygenation of the blood globules is not as yet capable of preventing\r\nthe aerobic microbe from turning to its own account the oxygen of the\r\nblood. The disease does its work and death supervenes.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the vital\r\nresistance of a newly-born guinea-pig should differ from that of an\r\nadult one. But what is very remarkable is, that if an older guinea-pig\r\nbe inoculated with the blood of one a day old; if a third, still\r\nolder, be inoculated with the blood of the second; and so on; the\r\nvirulence of the microbe will be gradually reinforced--that is to\r\nsay, the usual habit of this parasite to develop itself in the body\r\nof the animal will be restored. The process may be likened to that of\r\nan animal or vegetable species, passing by successive stages and long\r\nsojourns, from one region to another very distant one, subjected to\r\nquite new conditions of climate, and gradually becoming acclimatised\r\nto the last one. How great, then, must be the importance of the medium\r\nof cultivation, with regard to the virulence of the microbes of\r\ncommunicable diseases! Cultivating the microbe by passing it from one\r\nguinea-pig to another, we soon arrive at a strength capable of killing\r\nguinea-pigs of a week, a month, or several years old, until at last\r\nthe smallest drop of the blood of these guinea-pigs suffices to kill a\r\nsheep; and from the sheep we may pass on to the ox.\r\n\r\nThe same is the case with the microbe of fowl cholera. When it has\r\nceased to have any effect upon fowls, its virulence can be restored by\r\ninoculating small birds. Blackbirds, canaries, sparrows, all die, if\r\nthe virus has not been too much attenuated; and the effect is similar\r\non young chicks. Thus by several successive transitions from bird to\r\nbird a virulence may be fostered capable of destroying full-grown fowls.\r\n\r\nThese facts suggested to Pasteur certain inductions which may be well\r\nfounded. Is not the attenuation of the virus by the influence of the\r\nair one of the factors in the extinction of great epidemics? And\r\nmay not the reappearance of these scourges be accounted for by the\r\nreinforcement of the virulence?\r\n\r\n'The accounts which I have read,' Pasteur remarked some months ago,\r\n'of the spontaneous appearance of the plague in Benghazi in 1856 and\r\nin 1858 tend to prove that this outbreak could not be traced to any\r\noriginal contagion. Let us suppose, guided by the facts now known\r\nto us, that the plague, a malignant disease belonging to certain\r\ncountries, has germs of long duration. In all these countries its\r\nattenuated virus must exist, ready to resume its active form whenever\r\nthe conditions of climate, of famine, of misery present themselves\r\nafresh. The condition of long duration in the vitality of the germs of\r\nevil is not even indispensable; for, if I may believe the doctors who\r\nhave visited these countries, in all places subject to the plague, and\r\nin the intervals of the great outbreaks of the epidemic, cases may be\r\nmet with of people attacked with boils, not fatal, but resembling those\r\nof the deadly plague. Is it not probable that these boils contain an\r\nattenuated virus of the plague, and that the passage of this virus into\r\nexhausted bodies, which abound only too freely in periods of famine,\r\nmay restore to it a greater virulence?\r\n\r\n'The same may be the case with other maladies which appear suddenly,\r\nlike typhus in armies and in camps. Without doubt, the germs which are\r\nthe authors of these diseases are everywhere scattered around, but\r\nattenuated; and in this state a man may carry them about him or in his\r\nintestinal canal without great damage. They only become dangerous when,\r\nby conditions of overcrowding, and perhaps of successive developments\r\non the surfaces of wounds, in bodies enfeebled by disease, their\r\nvirulence is reinforced.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _ETIOLOGY OF SPLENIC FEVER._\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Pasteur had triumphed over splenic fever with as much rigour as\r\nprecision. But he considered that he had still to make one further\r\ninvestigation. He had established the effects of the pest; he had\r\ndiscovered a preventive method with which to combat it: he now\r\nwished to know the origin of the evil. Whence comes splenic fever?\r\nWhy is it endemic in certain departments of France, in certain parts\r\nof Russia, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, and America? How is it\r\nsustained? It was for a long time believed that splenic fever was born\r\nspontaneously under the influence of various accidental causes. M.\r\nBouley has related, in his learned work on the 'Progress of Medicine\r\nby Experimentation,' that in 1842 the Minister of Agriculture, M.\r\nCunin-Gridaine, at the request of the deputies of the departments that\r\nwere ravaged by the epidemic, entrusted to M. Delafond, a professor of\r\nthe school at Alfort, the task of investigating this malady, commonly\r\ncalled the 'blood disease,' in the districts in which it was raging.\r\nHe was to search out its causes, and ascertain whether they did not\r\nresult from the system of cultivation prevalent in the country.\r\n\r\nM. Delafond arrived in Beauce. One fact struck him--namely, that almost\r\nall the animals attacked by the disease were young, fine, and vigorous:\r\nthose, in short, that gave the best promise. Viewing the richness of\r\nthe soil and the abundance and quality of the crops in conjunction with\r\nthis observation, Delafond at once elaborated a speculative theory.\r\n'The blood disease,' said he, 'is nothing but an overfulness--an excess\r\nof blood circulating in the vessels, and especially the predominance in\r\nthat liquid of red globules.'\r\n\r\nStarting from this idea, his one object was, by means of logical\r\ndeduction, to trace everything to this fundamental error. He analysed\r\nthe soil, and demonstrated to what extent it was fitted to furnish\r\ncrops that were rich and abounding in nutritive properties. He analysed\r\nthe plants. He then complacently referred the richness of blood of\r\nthe Beauce sheep to the richness in nitrogenous principles of the\r\nsubstances on which they were fed. He examined the lesions of the\r\ndiseased animals, and concluded that they were the consequence of the\r\nblood containing too large a proportion of the organic elements, called\r\nglobules, fibrine, albumen, and too small a proportion of water.\r\n\r\n'Reduce the proportion of nutritious elements,' he wrote as his\r\nadvice to the agriculturists, 'mix roots with all that is too rich in\r\nnitrogenous principles, and you will reduce in proportion the losses\r\ncaused by the excess of the ultra-nutritious substances with which you\r\nsupersaturate your cattle.'\r\n\r\n'Such is the very logical conclusion to which Delafond was led,'\r\nadds M. Bouley, ridiculing these observations, based on a method of\r\nreasoning, instead of on the experimental method. 'And as a fresh\r\nproof of his theory he mentions the fact that the disease decreases\r\nas you descend the country towards the Loire. On the right bank of\r\nthat river--in Sologne, for instance, which is a low, sandy, damp\r\ndistrict--blood disease is unknown. In the arrondissements of Gien and\r\nMontargis and in parts of those of Orleans and Pithiviers it prevails\r\nbut little. There, Delafond imperturbably remarks, the soil is sandy\r\nand the herbage not nearly so rich as in the Beauce plateau; and there\r\nthe blood disease is consequently less common.'\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that such opinions could be written unchallenged only\r\nforty years ago, that they could even borrow a scientific character\r\nfrom the inspiration that gave them birth, we can see the progress that\r\nhas since been made, and can realise how great were the obscurity and\r\nuncertainty which have been dispelled by the experimental method.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a parasite having been brought to public notice in\r\nthe blood of animals suffering from splenic fever, at the very time\r\nwhen Pasteur had shaken the belief in spontaneous generation, people\r\ngrew accustomed to the idea that the stricken animals might have\r\ncontracted the germs of the malady from the outer world, without any\r\nspontaneous birth, strictly so called, of the disease. This opinion\r\nwas strengthened by a knowledge of the spores of the splenic bacillus.\r\nPasteur, aided by Messieurs Chamberland and Roux, commenced experiments\r\nwith a view to solving this difficult etiological question. The first\r\nexperiments took place in the fields of a farm at the village of St.\r\nGermain, near Chartres. Several groups of sheep were fed on lucern\r\ngrass which had been sprinkled with artificially-reared splenic fever\r\nbacteria, or with their germs or spores. Although all the sheep of the\r\nsame group absorbed an immense number of the spores of the parasite,\r\nmany survived, even after being visibly affected. Those that died\r\nshowed all the symptoms of what is called spontaneous splenic fever.\r\nThe period of incubation lasted as long as eight or ten days, although,\r\nin its latter stages, the disease exhibited those startling features\r\nwhich have caused a belief that the incubating period is a very short\r\none--short, that is to say, for those conditions of contagion where the\r\nparasite is not deposited in its pure state under the animal's skin.\r\n\r\nBut if prickly plants (notably the pointed ends of dried thistle\r\nleaves, or beards of barley blades cut into little bits about a\r\ncentimeter in length) were added to this infected food, the mortality\r\nincreased to a striking extent. On examination after death, the\r\nlesions of these animals were found to be similar to those observed in\r\nsheep which were attacked by splenic fever in sheds, or which died of\r\nthe disease in the open fields.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward, the idea which had been predominant in the\r\nminds of Pasteur and his fellow-workers during all their inquiries, was\r\nmaterially strengthened. They were convinced that the animals which\r\ndied of blood disease in the department of Eure et Loire had been\r\ninfected by germs or spores of the splenic microbe contained in their\r\nfood; but the question remained, Whence came these germs?\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when all belief in the spontaneous generation of the\r\nparasite is rejected, attention is naturally drawn to the possible\r\nconsequences which may arise from burying in the earth animals which\r\nhave died of splenic fever. In the greater number of cases, when the\r\nknacker's establishment is too far off and the dead animal is of little\r\nvalue, a trench is dug on the spot, at a depth varying from half a\r\nmeter to a meter. If the animal dies in a field, it is buried where it\r\nfalls; if it dies in a shed the body is carried into a neighbouring\r\nfield. There it is buried, and putrefaction sets in; and since all the\r\nsplenic fever filaments of the blood are destroyed by putrefaction, it\r\nwas thought that no dissemination of the germs of splenic fever, after\r\nthe animal had been buried, could occur. Pasteur showed that this\r\nopinion rested on a superficial observation. Even when the animal is\r\nnot cut up, blood spreads itself outside of the body in more or less\r\nabundance. Is it not an habitual characteristic of the disease, that\r\nat the time of death blood issues from the nostrils and the mouth, and\r\nthat the urine is often bloody? All around the corpse, therefore, the\r\nearth is polluted with blood. Moreover it takes several days for the\r\nsplenic fever microbe to resolve itself into harmless granulations by\r\nthe action of gases, other than oxygen, which putrefaction generates.\r\nDuring this time, the excessive inflation of the dead body causes\r\nthe liquids of the interior to issue from all the natural apertures.\r\nHow often also, a rent in the skin or the tissues increases this\r\nflow. The blood and other matters, mixed with the surrounding aerated\r\nsoil, are no longer in the conditions of putrefaction, but rather in\r\nthose which form a suitable medium of cultivation for the microbe.\r\nExperiments confirmed these views. Adding some splenic fever blood\r\nto earth sprinkled with the water of yeast, or with urine, at summer\r\ntemperature, or at the temperature which the fermentation of a dead\r\nbody keeps up around it, as in a dung heap, in less than twenty-four\r\nhours the splenic fever filaments deposited with the blood had\r\nmultiplied and resolved themselves into spores. These spores were\r\nafterwards found in their state of latent life, ready to germinate and\r\nto communicate splenic fever, after remaining in the earth for months,\r\nand even years.\r\n\r\nThese experiments, curious as they were, were only, so to speak,\r\nlaboratory experiments. It was necessary to investigate what happened\r\nin the open country with all the variations of dryness, of damp, and of\r\ncultivation. A happy inspiration came to Pasteur and his assistants.\r\nThey had buried in the midst of summer, in an isolated corner of the\r\nfarm of St. Germain, near Chartres, a sheep which had died of natural\r\nsplenic fever, and of which they had made the autopsy. Ten months\r\nafterwards, and again fourteen months afterwards, the idea occurred\r\nto them of collecting some of the earth from this grave. After having\r\nexamined it, and established the presence of the spores of the microbe,\r\nthey produced, by the inoculation of guinea-pigs, the splenic disease\r\nand death. But the circumstance which deserves the greatest attention,\r\nis that the same experiment was successfully made with the earth on\r\nthe _surface_ of the grave, though this earth had not been disturbed\r\nduring the interval. Some experiments were afterwards made on the earth\r\nof some trenches dug in a meadow of the Jura, where some cows which\r\nhad died of splenic fever had been buried at a depth of two meters.\r\nTwo years afterwards, by successive washings of the earth on the\r\nsurface of the graves, deposits were extracted which at once produced\r\nsplenic disease. At three trials within these two years the same\r\nsurface earths produced splenic fever, while, away from the graves,\r\nthe earth exhibited nothing of the kind. Finally, Pasteur and his\r\nassistants proved that on the surface of the earth which covered the\r\nburied animals, the germs were again found, after all the operations of\r\nploughing, sowing, and reaping.\r\n\r\nBut how, it will be asked, can the earth, which is so powerful a\r\nfilter, allow the germs of microscopic organisms to rise again to its\r\nsurface? Is one not tempted here to quote Pasteur against himself,\r\nsince, in his joint researches with M. Joubert, Pasteur had proved\r\nthat the waters of springs issuing from the earth, even at a shallow\r\ndepth, are entirely free from germs? Such waters, nevertheless, being\r\nsupplied from the earth's surface, which is constantly washed by rain,\r\nthe effect must be to carry down the finest particles to the springs.\r\nBut these latter, notwithstanding conditions so conducive to their\r\npollution, remain perfectly pure. Can there be a better proof that\r\nearth of a certain thickness will arrest all solid particles, even the\r\nmost minute? Nevertheless, in these experiments on splenic fever, we\r\nhear of microscopic germs, starting from the depths and coming up to\r\nthe surface--that is to say, in a direction contrary to the flow of the\r\nrain. This is an enigma.\r\n\r\nThe explanation will cause surprise. The earth-worms transport the\r\ngerms, and bring up, from the depths where they lie buried, the\r\nterrible microbes. In the tiny cylinders of earth which the worms\r\ndeposit on the surface of the soil, after the dews of the morning or\r\nafter rain, the splenic germs are to be found. It is easy to prove\r\nthis directly. If in earth, with which spores of the microbe have been\r\npreviously mingled, we place some worms, and at the end of several days\r\nopen the bodies of these worms, with all necessary precautions, so as\r\nto extract from them the earthy matter which fills their intestinal\r\ncanals, we find in them large numbers of splenic fever spores. It\r\nis, then, absolutely proved, that if splenic fever germs exist, as\r\nthey often do, in the light earth which covers the pits in which\r\nanimals dead of that disease lie buried, these germs result from the\r\ndisintegration by rain of the little excremental cylinders deposited by\r\nthe earth-worms. The dust of this disintegrated earth spreads itself\r\nover the grasses on a level with the soil, and thus it is that animals\r\ncome to find on the pasture-field, and in particular kinds of forage,\r\nthe germs of splenic fever by which they are infected.\r\n\r\n'In these results,' said Pasteur a short time ago at the Academy of\r\nMedicine, 'what outlooks are opened to the mind in regard to the\r\npossible influence of earths in the etiology of diseases, and the\r\npossible danger of the earth of cemeteries!'\r\n\r\nThe earth-worms also bring to the surface other germs, which,\r\nwhile they are as harmless to the worms as the splenic germs, are\r\nnevertheless bearers of diseases to which animals are liable. All sorts\r\nof germs are found in them, and the germs of splenic fever are in fact\r\nalways associated with those of putrefaction and septicæmia.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'And now,' concluded Pasteur, when laying before the Academy a rapid\r\nsurvey of the etiology of splenic fever, 'is not the remedy naturally\r\nindicated? We should never bury animals in fields destined either for\r\ncultivation, for forage, or for sheep pasture. When it is possible a\r\nsandy soil should be chosen for the purpose, or any poor calcareous\r\nsoil, dry, and easily desiccated--in a word, soil not suited to the\r\nexistence of earth-worms.' M. Tisserand, Director of Agriculture, has\r\nremarked that splenic fever is unknown in the region of the Savarts\r\nof Champagne, although it is surrounded by countries invaded by the\r\ndisease. If the conditions of commerce introduce splenic fever, it is\r\nbut a passing accident. Must not this be attributed to the fact that\r\nin these poor soils, such as that of the camp at Châlons, where the\r\nthickness of arable soil is only from 4 to 5 inches, superposed upon\r\nchalk, the worms cannot live? In such a soil the burial of a splenic\r\nfever animal will give rise to great quantities of germs, which, owing\r\nto the absence of earth-worms, will abide in the depths of the soil\r\nand remain harmless. Finally, it has been proved that the countries\r\nsubject to splenic fever have an argillaceous-calcareous soil, and that\r\nthe disease is unknown in schistose and granitic soils. The contrast of\r\nthe results, in relation to such differences of soil, is seen sometimes\r\nin the Department of the Aveyron, between the right and left side of\r\none and the same road or watercourse.\r\n\r\nMay we not now in all confidence assert that, if the cultivators\r\nchoose, splenic fever may soon be a thing of the past among their\r\nanimals, their shepherds, and among the butchers and the tanners of\r\nthe towns, because splenic fever and malignant pustule are never\r\nspontaneous? The disease exists only where it has been sown, or\r\nwhere it has been diffused by the unconscious instrumentality of the\r\nearth-worm.\r\n\r\nThe progress of vaccination will also contribute to the disappearance\r\nof splenic fever; for this preventive, if extensively used, as there\r\nis no doubt it will be, must end by establishing a race of domestic\r\nanimals which, having all sprung from vaccinated parents, will in\r\nconsequence be more resistant to the disease in its worst form. It\r\nwill be with them in relation to splenic fever as it is with ourselves\r\nin relation to small-pox. It is a well-known fact that the ravages of\r\nsmall-pox are much less considerable in our days than when it first\r\nappeared in Europe. It is difficult not to attribute this, at least in\r\npart, to the prevalence of vaccination.\r\n\r\nIn the populations where small-pox is introduced for the first time\r\nit has an exceptional intensity. Some months ago a significant fact of\r\nthis nature occurred in Paris. A whole family of Esquimaux perished\r\nfrom small-pox in the 'Jardin d'Acclimatation.' They had never been\r\nvaccinated, nor had their ancestors. They were new to the attacks of\r\nsmall-pox, which did not spread beyond them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              _METHOD OF DISCUSSION AND CONTRADICTIONS._\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery new discovery produces a revolution in general ideas; a\r\nrevolution gladly hailed by some, but opposed by others as disturbing\r\ntheir habits of thought and reasoning. Those also who are thrown out\r\nin their calculations, while engaged in working out a problem in any\r\nway similar to the one that has been solved, too often atone for their\r\ndilatoriness by furious denial of the newly asserted truth. The great\r\nfact of the attenuation of virus, the artificial production of the\r\nvaccines of chicken cholera and of splenic fever, the importance of\r\ntheir employment for the preservation of animals from these diseases,\r\nexcited throughout the world a surprise and enthusiasm which passionate\r\ncritics soon sought to disparage. The fiercest attack was from Germany.\r\nIt commenced immediately after Pasteur's triumph at the International\r\nCongress of Medicine held in London in 1881. The German doctor Koch\r\nand his colleagues, MM. Gaffki and Lœffler, published in Berlin,\r\nin the report of the German Sanitary Office, a kind of scientific\r\ntirade against the discovery of virus vaccine, and the possibility of\r\nutilising it in the large operations of cattle-breeding.\r\n\r\nAt the London Congress Dr. Koch had said to a French physician that the\r\npossibility of attenuating virus was a thing too good to be true. The\r\nwhole question was therefore reopened by Dr. Koch and his disciples. At\r\nfirst Pasteur let the torrent flow; but, not being the man to give way\r\nbefore an adversary, he at last declared that the attacks of the German\r\nsavants must be repelled at Berlin itself. Continual applications for\r\nsplenic vaccine were made to him from different parts of Germany.\r\nM. Pasteur replied that, seeing that the discovery was so formally\r\ncontested in Prussia, it would be well, before sending any vaccine\r\nabroad, to institute a great demonstrative experiment, as had been done\r\nat Pouilly-le-Fort.\r\n\r\nDr. Roloff, head of the Veterinary School of Berlin, hastened to\r\ntake the initiative, by an application to the German Minister of\r\nAgriculture. The minister at once nominated a Commission to follow\r\nthe experiments in vaccination and to draw up a report for the German\r\nGovernment. M. Pasteur entrusted the conduct of the vaccinations to his\r\nnew colleague, Louis Thuillier, who accepted with deep and silent joy\r\nthe management of an experiment that was to test a French discovery.\r\nHe was always ready for anything, this brave Thuillier, who was\r\ndestined to die, a martyr to the cause of science, in the full promise\r\nof his youth, and in the full hope of glory. His courage and his work\r\nwere alike great and silent. In the laboratory he would spend days,\r\neven weeks, without speaking, bent over his microscope with tenacious\r\nresolution, endeavouring to follow Pasteur in all his investigations:\r\nproud to live near his illustrious master, happy to be his disciple and\r\nto be loved by him almost as a son. What a vacancy he has left in the\r\nlaboratory! What a place he might have held in science!\r\n\r\nThe composition of the German Commission, over which M. Beyer, member\r\nof the Superior Council of Government, presided, showed clearly the\r\nimportance attached by Germany to the investigation of this French\r\ndiscovery. Among its members was the famous Professor Virchow.\r\n\r\nThe experiments were carried out on the estate of Pakisch. The minutes\r\nand reports of the Commission left no doubt as to the correctness of\r\nthe facts announced by Pasteur. But, as the negations of Dr. Koch and\r\nhis colleagues embraced questions beyond that of the prophylaxy of\r\nsplenic fever, Pasteur did not rest content with this initial success;\r\nhe sought for a fresh opportunity of convincing his opponents. This\r\nopportunity occurred in September 1882, when an International Hygienic\r\nCongress was held at Geneva. Thither went Pasteur, hoping to meet\r\nDr. Koch at the sittings; and he was not disappointed. Dr. Koch was\r\nthere, surrounded by his disciples. From the tribune of the Congress,\r\nPasteur refuted his criticism, exposed his errors, and challenged\r\nhim to a discussion in the presence of competent judges. There was\r\nan instantaneous salvo of applause, and everyone awaited Dr. Koch's\r\nreply. But he declined all debate, reserving his case for careful and\r\ndeliberate statement in the press.\r\n\r\nIt took three months for Dr. Koch to bring out a small pamphlet,\r\nand these three months had borne their fruit. The discovery of the\r\nattenuation of virus, which had been so vehemently attacked only a year\r\nbefore in the report of the Sanitary Office, was now extolled by Dr.\r\nKoch as a discovery of the first importance. Being, however, unwilling\r\nabsolutely to stultify himself, he continued the attack by denying its\r\nefficacy in practical agriculture.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe clear, direct style of argument, which goes straight to its point,\r\nwas invariably adopted by Pasteur.\r\n\r\n'Contradictions may retard, although they cannot ultimately prevent,\r\nthe recognition of truth,' he once remarked to me when walking in the\r\ngardens of the École Normale; 'that is why it is so important to remove\r\nthe obstacles which temporarily clog and hamper it. In scientific\r\ndiscussions, it is not as in politics,' he added with a smile, 'where\r\ndemonstration is often difficult. In the natural sciences, doctrines\r\nmust be based on an assemblage of results, of observations, and of\r\nexperiments. If a doctrine is challenged, it seldom happens that its\r\ntruth or falsehood cannot be established by the application of some\r\ncrucial test. Even a single experiment will often suffice either to\r\nrefute or consolidate the doctrine.'\r\n\r\nReviewing the labours of the past forty years, Pasteur then called to\r\nmind the numerous controversies in which he had been engaged. Not only\r\nhad he been attacked by Pouchet and Joly on the question of spontaneous\r\ngeneration, by Liebig on the subject of fermentation, by Germans and\r\nItalians regarding the attenuation of virus, but every one of his\r\nassertions had been met with such passionate opposition that, from\r\nsheer weariness, he had invariably ended by referring the matter to\r\nsome authorised commission, only asking it to put an end to all strife\r\nby coming to some definite decision.\r\n\r\nThe upshot was at times somewhat amusing. For instance, when Pasteur\r\ndescribed to the Academy of Medicine how, simply by lowering the\r\ntemperature of a hen, he had made her susceptible to inoculation with\r\nsplenic fever, the facts were at once denied by M. Colin, a professor\r\nof the school of Alfort. Pasteur immediately requested that a\r\ncommission might be named, which should include both himself and his\r\nopponent among its members. This was on a Tuesday, one of the Academy\r\ndays of sitting. The following Saturday, in presence of the whole\r\ncommission, Pasteur produced four hens that had died of splenic fever.\r\nM. Colin himself conducted the autopsy. It was clear to everyone that\r\ntheir blood was full of the filaments of the splenic fever parasite.\r\nThe _procès-verbal_ was drawn up and signed by all the members of the\r\ncommission, necessarily including M. Colin. The following Tuesday it\r\nwas read at the sitting of the Academy. To cover his retreat M. Colin\r\nnow contended that the hens had taken splenic fever not because they\r\nhad been subjected to a chilling process, but because, so as to keep\r\nthem in the water, the poor creatures had had their wings and feet tied\r\nto planks. This sentimental objection was disposed of by comparative\r\nexperiments that had been made on hens similarly tied and inoculated,\r\nbut not chilled. The latter had in no case taken the disease.\r\n\r\nAt the Academy of Sciences, some days later, a mine was sprung upon\r\nPasteur by a posthumous publication of Claude Bernard's. He again\r\nsubmitted this abruptly raised question to the decision of the Academy.\r\nA series of experiments had been found among Bernard's papers, having\r\nas their object the inauguration of a new method of spontaneously\r\ngenerating the substance which causes the fermentation of the must of\r\nthe grape.\r\n\r\n'I will start for the Jura,' said Pasteur. 'In the midst of my\r\nvineyard, which,' he proudly added, 'is ten meters square, I will cover\r\nover some stocks with an improvised frame. These stocks will go on\r\nliving and bearing grapes, which will ripen. It is now July. At this\r\ntime of year, as I have already declared, the germs of the cellules\r\nwhich form the ferment of the grape in the vats do not yet exist,\r\neither on the green grapes, on the bunches, or on the vine leaves. I\r\nwill envelop the bunches of the stocks that are underneath the frame\r\nwith a layer of cotton wool that has been raised to a temperature of\r\n150 degrees Centigrade. This done, I will come back to Paris with the\r\nkeys of the frame in my pocket, not returning to the Jura until the\r\nvintage season, at the beginning of October. I predict to the Academy,\r\nthat the grapes wrapped in cotton wool under the frame, and which will\r\nhave grown ripe, may be crushed in the open air, and that the juice\r\ncoming from them will not be capable of fermentation.'\r\n\r\nThis prediction was fulfilled. In October, Pasteur returned to the\r\nJura, plucked off several of these stocks, laden with ripe bunches,\r\nand brought them with the utmost care to Paris. He had at last the\r\nsatisfaction of depositing them intact on the table of the Academy of\r\nSciences. He then invited M. Berthelot (editor of Bernard's pamphlet),\r\nand all his colleagues, to cut off as many bunches as they pleased.\r\n'Only crush them in contact with pure air,' said he, 'and I defy you to\r\nproduce fermentation.'\r\n\r\nHow often was Pasteur obliged to return to facts already proved, not\r\nonly at the Academy of Sciences, but at the Academy of Medicine, where\r\nM. Jules Guérin, at the age of eighty, challenged him to a duel as his\r\nscientific ultimatum! If M. Pasteur at times pleaded his cause with\r\ntoo much passion, it was the passion of truth, the burning desire to\r\nconvince, which lent such power and defiance to his vibrating voice.\r\nHe could not endure his work to be attacked--not from pride, none was\r\nmore modest than he--but from irritation at the denial of positive\r\nfacts; facts of which he was a thousand times assured, and which all\r\nthe world might verify. No one now remembers these discussions. Time\r\nhas passed, and opposition has been overthrown. It has been granted\r\nto Pasteur to see, everywhere around him, the beneficent results of\r\nhis discoveries. From all parts, from his own as well as from foreign\r\ncountries, such proofs of admiration and gratitude have been showered\r\nupon him as are usually granted only to those whose death has atoned\r\nfor their genius. He has opened up such sources of wealth to industry\r\nand agriculture that, as the learned English professor Huxley has truly\r\nsaid, 'Pasteur's discoveries suffice, of themselves, to cover the war\r\nindemnity of five milliards of francs paid by France to Germany.'\r\nHis investigations of contagious diseases have revealed immense\r\npossibilities in prophylaxy. But Pasteur considered these marvellous\r\ndiscoveries as a mere beginning. 'You will see,' he often said, 'how it\r\nwill all grow by-and-by. Would that my time were longer!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                _THE LABORATORY OF THE ÉCOLE NORMALE._\r\n\r\n                     VARIOUS STUDIES. HYDROPHOBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the day when a minister told Pasteur, that there were not 1,500\r\nfrancs in the budget to allow for the expenses of his laboratory,\r\nscience has obtained a little more consideration. At the present time\r\nshe has nothing to complain of: her sovereignty is recognised; her\r\nschools are becoming palaces; she has an amply sufficient civil list:\r\nshe is rich enough, in short, to pay for her researches. M. Pasteur's\r\nlaboratory has had its full share of the well-bestowed generosity of\r\nthe State. The municipal council of Paris even wished to attach vast\r\ndependencies to this laboratory. The old garden of the ancient Collège\r\nRollin was placed at the disposal of Pasteur; who at once hastened\r\nto build stables for lodging horses attacked by glanders, stalls for\r\nsheltering splenic fever sheep, and kennels for the reception of mad\r\ndogs. But, while taking advantage of these hospitable premises, Pasteur\r\nstill retained, in the basement of his laboratory in the Rue d'Ulm, a\r\nwhole population of animals under experiment. Isolated in round cages\r\nwhich impart some sense of security, are the rabid dogs; some attacked\r\nwith furious madness, biting their bars, devouring hay, uttering\r\ndoleful howls which those who have once heard can never forget; others\r\ncarrying the germ of this terrible disease, still fawning with a humble\r\nlook of tenderness, as if imploring attention. Hens and chickens pass\r\ntheir heads through the wooden bars of their coops. From time to time\r\na cock from the bottom of his den crows 'a gloomy dawn.' Rabbits eat\r\npeaceably, while little families of guinea-pigs cluster together,\r\nand at the least alarm utter a frightened cry. All these animals are\r\ndestined to be shortly inoculated. Each morning a round of inspection\r\nis made in this little hospital of condemned animals. The dead are\r\ntaken out, carried to one of the upper rooms, and placed on the\r\ndissecting-boards.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is also to such boards that living animals are fastened when it is\r\nnecessary to experiment upon them. Certainly when one sees a dog lying\r\nwith a forlorn look, its feet tied, its body trembling from fright, on\r\nthe point of undergoing, though in full health, a bloody operation,\r\none cannot suppress the feelings of pity. But a single visit to a\r\nphysiological laboratory suffices to reveal vivisection in its only\r\nand true light; that of the interest it offers to science, and the\r\nresults it may have in store for the benefit of humanity. Moreover,\r\nin Pasteur's laboratory, every dog subjected to vivisection is\r\nchloroformed. The persons who take up the controversy about vivisection\r\nare careful that the outside world shall see only the suffering and\r\nanguish of the animal, where the solution of a problem should be\r\nthe object kept in view. Would the English physiologist Harvey have\r\ndiscovered the circulation of the blood, if he had not practised\r\nvivisection on deer in the park of Charles I.? Would Claude Bernard\r\nhave been able, without vivisection, to demonstrate the glycogenic\r\nfunction of the liver? If Pasteur had not sacrificed some fowls and\r\nsheep, would the great scientific fact of the attenuation of virus\r\nhave been discovered? If 500 dogs had to perish, what would that be,\r\ncompared with the discovery tomorrow of the cause of hydrophobia, and\r\nof the means of protecting humanity against this frightful scourge?\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, in presence of a large assembly, Pasteur made an\r\nexperiment on atmospheric oxygen. He placed under a glass bell a bird,\r\nwhich in a short time, after having consumed the oxygen contained in\r\nthe bell, gathered itself up into a ball, opened its beak, and shut its\r\neyes, as if it were going to die. At this moment Pasteur introduced a\r\nsecond sparrow, which, passing directly from the ordinary air into the\r\nbell, without any gradual preparation, immediately fell, asphyxiated.\r\nThere was a little exclamation of horror and a movement of pity in the\r\naudience. While the first sparrow, which had gone through the ordeal\r\nunharmed, was set free, and gradually revived, Pasteur turned towards\r\nthe assembly and said--\r\n\r\n'I never had the courage to kill a bird in sport, but when it is a\r\nquestion of experiment I am deterred by no scruple. Science has the\r\nright to assert the sovereignty of its aims.'\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut to return to the animals of the laboratory: From the little white\r\nmice, which hide themselves in a packet of wadding, to the dogs which\r\nbark furiously in their iron cages, all are devoted to death. But it is\r\nnot only the inmates of the laboratory which daily succeed each other\r\nupon the operating and dissecting tables. From divers parts of France,\r\nhampers full of fowls which have died of cholera, or of some other\r\ndisease, are sent to Pasteur. Here is an enormous basket packed with\r\nstraw containing the dead body of a pig which had died of measles. This\r\nfragment of lung, packed in a tin box, belonged to a cow which died of\r\nperipneumonia. Other packets are still more precious. Since Pasteur\r\nwent to Pauillac two years ago, to watch for the return of a ship\r\nwhich was to bring back some passengers attacked with yellow fever,\r\nhe sometimes receives from a distant country a bottled dose of _vomito\r\nnegro_.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, on the work tables, are to be seen tubes filled with blood,\r\nmicroscope slides carrying little drops. In the stoves are ranged\r\nthe cultivating flasks, which resemble little flasks of liqueur. The\r\npoint of a needle dipped into one of these flasks is sufficient to\r\ncause death. Enclosed in their glass prison, millions upon millions of\r\nmicrobes live and multiply.\r\n\r\nIt is really a curious spectacle this workshop of research and\r\ndiscovery. How numerous and varied are the subjects which are being\r\nstudied, and with what energy and patience does Pasteur attack them!\r\nIt is not only to the most dreaded diseases that he has applied the\r\ngerm theory. He has extended it to certain common disorders. Everything\r\nto him is a subject for experiment. In May 1879, a person who was\r\nworking in the laboratory was troubled with boils, which reappeared, as\r\nusually happens, at short intervals, sometimes on one part of the body,\r\nsometimes on another. Pasteur, whose mind was constantly dwelling on\r\nthe part played by microscopic organisms, asked himself if the pus of\r\nthe boils did not contain a parasite, the presence and development of\r\nwhich, and its accidental transport here and there in the body, might\r\nbe the cause of the local inflammation and of the formation of the pus.\r\nThe constant reappearance of the evil would be thus accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe pus of the first boil, which was situated on the nape of the\r\nneck, was collected in great purity; some days afterwards, the pus of\r\na second boil, then of a third boil, was collected. The pus, or the\r\nblood-stained lymph of the red swelling which preceded the formation of\r\nthe pus, were sown in a sterilised infusion, and each time a microbe,\r\nformed of little spherical points connected in pairs, frequently united\r\nin small clusters, was seen to develop itself. The cultivating liquid\r\nwas sometimes infusion of fowl, sometimes of yeast. In the infusion of\r\nyeast the little grains are suspended in pairs throughout the liquid,\r\nwhich is uniformly thickened with them. In the fowl infusion, the\r\ngrains are united into little clusters, which cover the sides of the\r\nvessels, the liquid remaining clear as long as it is not shaken.\r\n\r\nNew observations were made upon a series of boils, in the case of a\r\nman sent to Pasteur by Dr. Maurice Raynaud. The same parasite was\r\nagain found--a unique parasite, distinct from all others. At the\r\nHospital Lariboisière, a woman whose back was covered with boils,\r\noffered another opportunity for experiment, and with the same result.\r\nIt appears certain, then, that every boil contains a microscopic\r\naerobic microbe, and that to it are due the local inflammation and the\r\nconsequent formation of pus.\r\n\r\nWhen guinea-pigs or rabbits are inoculated with the cultivating\r\nliquids, little abscesses are formed, which, however, quickly\r\ndisappear. As long as the cure of these little abscesses is not quite\r\ncompleted, one can extract from them the microscopic organism which\r\nhas formed them. When the little parasite is sought for in the general\r\nblood of those attacked with boils it is not found. The cause of this,\r\nno doubt, is that an aerobic parasite has always some difficulty in\r\ndeveloping itself in the blood. The blood corpuscles appropriate, and\r\ndo not willingly give up to a foreign organism, the oxygen which they\r\nrequire. There is a struggle for life, and in the struggle against the\r\nboils the victory is not doubtful. It might be thought, then, that\r\nthe little organism of boils does not exist in the blood, but there\r\nis no doubt that if, instead of a small drop of blood, one could put\r\nseveral grammes or more into cultivation fruitful results would follow.\r\nThe little parasite is no doubt conveyed by the blood at one time or\r\nother. It is transported from a boil, in the process of development, to\r\nanother point of the body, where it may be fortuitously arrested, there\r\nto cultivate itself and form a new boil.\r\n\r\n'It is to be wished,' said Pasteur, 'that a patient would submit to a\r\nnumber of punctures on different parts of the body, distant from boils\r\nalready formed or in process of formation, and that with the blood thus\r\ntaken from the general circulation a multitude of cultivations might be\r\ncarried on. I am persuaded,' he added, 'that, among these cultivations,\r\nwe should find some fruitful in the little organism of the boils.'\r\n\r\nBut whilst Dr. Maurice Raynaud gave Pasteur the means of studying\r\nboils, Dr. Lannelongue enabled him to investigate that serious\r\ndisease of the bones and marrow called 'osteomyelitis.' In February\r\n1880 that skilful surgeon, who has published a highly esteemed work\r\non osteomyelitis, and on the possibility of its cure by trepanning\r\nthe bone, followed by washings and antiseptic dressings, conducted\r\nPasteur to the Hospice Trousseau. A little girl twelve years of age,\r\nattacked with this cruel malady, was about to be operated upon. The\r\nright knee was much swollen, as was also all the leg to below the calf,\r\nand a part of the thigh above the knee. After having chloroformed\r\nthe child, Dr. Lannelongue made a long incision below the knee, from\r\nwhich pus flowed abundantly. The bone of the tibia was laid bare for\r\na considerable length. Three trepanning perforations were then made\r\nin the bone, from each of which the pus issued in great quantities.\r\nPasteur carefully collected, with all the conditions necessary to the\r\npreservation of their purity, the pus of the exterior and the pus of\r\nthe interior of the bone, and, returning to his laboratory, he examined\r\nthem attentively. The direct observation, by a microscope, of the two\r\nspecimens of pus was extremely interesting. It was obvious that they\r\ncontained, in large quantities, an organism like that of boils, in\r\npairs of two or four, and also in parcels, some with a clearly defined\r\noutline, others scarcely visible, and with very faint outlines. The\r\nexternal pus showed an abundance of pus globules, but that of the\r\ninterior did not show any. It was like a paste entirely composed of\r\nmicrobes, so numerous and fertile that, in less than six hours after\r\nsowing them in the cultivating liquid, the development of the little\r\nmicrobe had commenced, and was rendered visible to the naked eye by a\r\nslight but general turbidity of the liquid.\r\n\r\nIts close resemblance to the organism of the boil might lead to the\r\nassertion that they are identical, if it were not known how great\r\nare the physiological differences that may exist between microscopic\r\nparasites of the same appearance and the same dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\nAs Pasteur advanced in these studies, he found at the Academy of\r\nMedicine some fellow labourers, who being keenly interested in such\r\nresearches did all they could to promote them. Thus M. Villemin,\r\nthe chief medical officer of the Val de Grâce (who had with so much\r\nsagacity discovered the contagion of tuberculosis) when typhoid fever\r\nwas raging in Paris two years ago, never allowed a case of the fever\r\nto pass through his hands without informing Pasteur, who habitually\r\nwent himself to collect specimens of the blood of those who had died.\r\nHow numerous were the drops of blood thus enclosed in little tubes, and\r\nhow frequent the attempts at cultivation, as yet without result, in the\r\nhope of finding the cause of a disease which claims so many victims!\r\nThere is another malady to which Dr. Hervieux especially called\r\nPasteur's attention, and by which so many women are attacked--puerperal\r\nfever. He went with M. Hervieux to the Maternity Hospital, to visit a\r\nwoman under his charge who had contracted puerperal fever some days\r\nafter her confinement. By means of a pin a prick was made in the\r\nforefinger of the left hand, which had been washed previously with\r\ndilute alcohol and carbolic acid, and dried with singed linen. The\r\ndrop of blood taken in this way was sown in an infusion of fowl. For\r\nsome days the cultivation remained sterile. Next day blood was taken\r\nfrom a fresh puncture, and this time it proved fertile. The woman\r\ndied three days after. The blood, therefore, already at the time when\r\nPasteur had taken it, three days at least before death, contained a\r\nmicroscopic parasite capable of cultivation. Eighteen hours before this\r\nwoman died, some blood taken from the left foot had been sown, and,\r\nlike the former, it had proved productive; but--and this fact deserves\r\nto be noted--while the first productive cultivation only contained a\r\nmicrobe resembling that of boils, the other cultivation contained long\r\nflexible chaplets clustered together like tangled strings of beads.\r\n\r\nAt the post-mortem examination of this woman large quantities of pus\r\nwere found in the peritoneum and the uterus. This pus was sown with all\r\ndue precaution. Some blood taken from the basilic and femoral veins was\r\nlikewise sown. It was everywhere easy to recognise the long chaplets\r\nin little tangled parcels, and always without admixture of other\r\norganisms, except in the cultivation of the peritoneal pus, which,\r\nbesides the long strings of grains, showed also the little pyogenic\r\nvibrios to which Pasteur had already assigned the name of the pus\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nFrom the Maternity Hospital Pasteur went to the Hôpital Lariboisière,\r\nwhere he had been informed that another woman had just died of the same\r\nfever. From a puncture in the peritoneum he collected some pus which\r\nwas found there in great abundance. He sowed this, as well as some\r\nblood taken from a vein in the arm. The culture of the pus furnished\r\nthe long strings of grains and the little pyogenic vibrio. The culture\r\nof the blood exhibited only the long strings quite pure.\r\n\r\nPasteur made many other observations of the same kind in cases of\r\npuerperal fever. He arrived at the conclusion that, under the name\r\nof puerperal fever, diseases of different symptoms were classed, but\r\nwhich all appear to be the result of the invasion of common organisms,\r\nwhich develop themselves on the surface of wounded parts, and from\r\nthence spread themselves, in one form or another, by the medium of the\r\nblood or of the lymphatics, over different parts of the body. Here the\r\nvarious morbid symptoms are determined by the nature of the parasite\r\nand the general constitution of the patient. Pasteur is convinced that,\r\nwith the possible exception of cases where, by the presence either of\r\ninternal or external abscesses, the body, before confinement, contains\r\nmicroscopic organisms, the antiseptic treatment ought to be infallible\r\nin preventing puerperal fever from declaring itself. The employment\r\nof carbolic acid may be of great service; but its smell, and often\r\nthe melancholy association of ideas which it awakens, might render\r\nit unsuitable for women in labour. There is not the same objection\r\nto concentrated solutions of boric acid, which, at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, contain from thirty to forty grammes of acid to one litre\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n'Would it not be very useful,' said Pasteur one day, when developing\r\nhis ideas and observations before the Academy of Sciences, 'to place\r\nalways by the bedside of each patient the concentrated and warm\r\nsolution of boric acid, with compresses to be very frequently renewed,\r\nafter having been soaked in the solution, these applications being\r\nbegun immediately after the confinement? It would also be prudent,\r\nbefore using the compresses, to put them into a hot-air stove, at a\r\ntemperature of 150 degrees, which is more than sufficient to kill all\r\nthe germs of common organisms.\r\n\r\n'I have,' he added, 'represented the facts as they have appeared to me,\r\nand I have hazarded the interpretation of them; but I do not disguise\r\nfrom myself that, in the domain of medicine, it is difficult to\r\nwithdraw oneself entirely from a pre-existing subjective bias; neither\r\ndo I forget that the medical and veterinary studies are foreign to\r\nmyself: therefore I earnestly desire judgment and criticism. While I am\r\nlittle tolerant of frivolous contradiction or of prejudice, despising\r\nas I do that vulgar scepticism which would erect doubt into a system,\r\nI honour that militant scepticism which makes doubt the basis of a\r\nmethod, whose motto is \"More light.\"'\r\n\r\nSince these ideas have penetrated further into practice; puerperal\r\nfever, I was told lately by a distinguished medical man, is hardly\r\nknown in the Maternity Hospital. The employment of a solution of one\r\nto a thousandth of corrosive sublimate, which is one of the best\r\nantiseptics, gives excellent results, and keeps off all danger. May\r\nit not be permitted to hope that puerperal fever will soon disappear\r\nin the same way that purulent infection has disappeared in hospitals,\r\nsince the introduction of Lister's dressings?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, a new malady occupied the attention of the laboratory of\r\nthe École Normale, a malady the name of which was not even known in\r\nParis, but which made great ravages in the country--namely, swine fever\r\n(_rouget_). Here, again, it is a microbe which causes the disorder.\r\nThis microbe was first perceived by Thuillier, in a little commune of\r\nthe Département de Vienne, when examining the blood and humours of pigs\r\nwhich had died of the fever. Experiments were at once set on foot in\r\nthe laboratory, with the view of proving that the microbe was really\r\nthe cause of the disease. The microbe was cultivated in a sterilised\r\ninfusion of veal. This cultivation was passed on to a succeeding one,\r\na small drop of the preceding cultivation being always taken for seed.\r\nInoculations from these last cultivations produced the fever in certain\r\nbreeds of pigs. The proof was thus given that the microbe was really\r\nthe origin of the disease.\r\n\r\nPasteur then, accompanied by Thuillier and a young assistant, M. Loir,\r\nwent, in his turn, to study the disease in the Department of Vaucluse.\r\nHe remained more than a month in the canton of Bollène, in the house\r\nof a veterinary surgeon, M. Maucuer, who took him to all the pigsties\r\nin the arrondissement. After having had recourse to the oxygen of\r\nthe air to attenuate the virulence of the microbe, Pasteur made some\r\nexperiments in vaccination. Some pigs which had been vaccinated\r\nremained in the canton of Bollène, under the supervision of M. Maucuer,\r\nthe owners having pledged themselves to keep their vaccinated pigs\r\nfor at least a year. In the ensuing September, when swine fever\r\nraged everywhere in the canton of Bollène and in the arrondissement\r\nof Orange, not a single vaccinated pig was attacked. 'They are all\r\nflourishing,' wrote M. Maucuer. An address of thanks was sent to\r\nPasteur by the municipal council of Bollène.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding these happy results, the question of the\r\napplication of vaccines to different breeds requires still further\r\ninvestigation, before the vaccination of pigs can become general.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards a method, different from that of the atmospheric\r\noxygen, for weakening the virulence of the fever virus, was tried in\r\nthe laboratory.\r\n\r\nPasteur had proved that viruses are not morbid entities, that they\r\ncan assume numerous forms, and especially physiological properties,\r\ndependent on the medium in which they live and multiply. The virulence\r\nbelongs to living microscopic species, but is at the same time\r\nessentially modifiable. It may be weakened or intensified, and each of\r\nthese states is capable of being made permanent by culture. A microbe\r\nis virulent in an animal, when it has the power of swarming in the\r\nbody of that animal, after the manner of a parasite, and of producing,\r\nby the renewal of its own life, disturbances which cause disease\r\nand death. If this microbe has lived in any species of animal--that\r\nis to say, if several times over it has passed from the body of one\r\nindividual into that of another of the same kind, without having been\r\nsubjected to any sensible exterior influence during its passage--we\r\nmay consider that the virulence of this parasite has reached a fixed\r\nand maximum state for the individuals of that race. The splenic fever\r\nparasite pertaining to sheep, for instance, varies little from one\r\nsubject to another or from one year to another in the same country;\r\nthis must be attributed, doubtless, to the fact that, in its successive\r\npassages through the sheep, the habit of the parasite to live in sheep\r\nhas, so to speak, attained a definite state. It is thus with the virus\r\nof the Jennerian vaccination. But the virulence of a virus which is\r\nnot at its maximum may be essentially modified by its passage into a\r\nsuccession of individuals of the same race. It will be remembered how,\r\nwhen Pasteur and his assistants wished to increase progressively the\r\nvirulence of the virus of chicken cholera and splenic fever, so as to\r\nbring them at last to their maximum intensity, these viruses were first\r\ninoculated into young subjects, and from them successively into older\r\nones.\r\n\r\n'The Academy remembers, without doubt,' said Pasteur in a recent\r\ncommunication, 'that, some time ago, we discovered a microbe virus\r\nin the saliva of hydrophobia. This microbe, though very virulent for\r\nrabbits, is shown to be harmless for adult guinea-pigs, but it kills\r\nrapidly guinea-pigs only some hours or days old. In following out\r\nthis inoculation from young guinea-pigs, we have seen the virulence\r\nincrease, and easily arrive at the point of causing death to older\r\nguinea-pigs. There was even at last a marked difference in the lesions.\r\nThe increase of virulence, by successive passages through individuals\r\nof one race, was clearly shown.\r\n\r\n'But the new and unexpected result that I wish to point out to the\r\nAcademy consists in this: that the microbe, after having increased its\r\nvirulence by successive passages through the bodies of guinea-pigs,\r\nshows itself to be less virulent in relation to rabbits than it was\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n'In these new conditions, it gives to the rabbit a disease which is\r\nspontaneously curable; and, moreover, having once gone through the\r\nmalady, the animal becomes refractory in regard to the microbe which\r\nis deadly to rabbits. From this arises the all-important consequence,\r\nthat the habit of living in one species (the guinea-pig) at a definite\r\ncorresponding degree of virulence, can change this virulence in\r\nrelation to another species (the rabbit), so much diminishing its\r\neffects as to cause it to become a vaccine for this latter species.\r\n\r\n'The importance of this result cannot fail to be perceived by everyone,\r\nfor it contains the secret of a new method of attenuation, which can be\r\napplied to some of the most virulent viruses. We will give an example\r\nand an application of it.\r\n\r\n'If a pigeon be inoculated in the pectoral muscle with the microbe of\r\nswine fever, the pigeon dies in an interval of six or eight days, after\r\nhaving shown the apparent exterior symptoms of fowl cholera.\r\n\r\n'When a second pigeon is inoculated with the blood of the first, a\r\nthird with that of the second, and so on in succession, the microbe\r\nacclimatises itself to the pigeon. The symptoms of forming itself into\r\na ball, and of somnolence, which are the habitual characteristics of\r\nthe disease, appear in a much shorter time than with the first pigeons\r\nof the series. Death likewise comes on more rapidly. Finally, the blood\r\nof the last pigeons exhibits much more virulence in the pig than even\r\nthe most infectious products of a pig that has died of what is called\r\nspontaneous fever.\r\n\r\n'The passage of the swine fever microbe through rabbits leads to quite\r\na different result. Rabbits inoculated with the infectious products of\r\na pig that has died of the fever, or with the cultivations of them, are\r\nalways made ill and most frequently die.\r\n\r\n'When the virus is inoculated from rabbit to rabbit, the microbe\r\nacclimatises itself to the rabbit. All the animals die, and death\r\ncomes in a very few days. The cultures of the blood of these rabbits\r\nin sterilised media become progressively easy and more abundant. The\r\nmicrobe itself changes its aspect somewhat, grows rather larger than\r\nin the pig, and appears in the form of an 8, without the filiform\r\nlengthening out characteristic of certain other cultures.'\r\n\r\n'When pigs are inoculated with the blood of the last rabbits, and the\r\nresults compared with those obtained from the first of the series, it\r\nis found that the virulence has been progressively diminishing from the\r\nfirst rabbit to the following ones. Very soon the blood of the rabbits\r\nceases to cause death in the pigs, though it renders them ill. On\r\nrecovery they are proof against the deadly swine fever.'\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of these investigations undertaken by Pasteur, there\r\nis one which is paramount over all the others, one on which for three\r\nyears all his efforts, as well as those of his pupils, have been\r\nconcentrated, and this is Hydrophobia. Mysterious in its incubation,\r\nalarming in its symptoms, Pasteur's attention had for a long time\r\nbeen drawn to it, when in 1880 he finally attacked it. Besides the\r\nattraction which an obscure problem had for him, he felt that if he\r\nsucceeded in discovering the probably microbean etiology of such a\r\ndisease, he would carry all minds with him into the current of these\r\nnew ideas. He had been very often struck, if not with the opposition,\r\nat least with the prudent and circumspect reserve, shown in the\r\nexamination of his doctrine, by a considerable number of physicians\r\nwho, possessed by the idea that the moral element could cause\r\nmodifications in the symptoms and development of a malady in man, are\r\nnot disposed to recognise the least assimilation between human diseases\r\nand those of the animal species. No doubt the emotional qualities,\r\ngrave family cares, the terror of approaching death, the dread of the\r\ngreat unknown, may modify the course of the evil in man, may aggravate\r\nit, even hasten it; but, whilst recognising--for never was there a man\r\nmore a creature of sentiment than he--what there is of deep truth in\r\nthis opinion, Pasteur could not help thinking that the first origin,\r\nthe cause of every contagious malady, is physiologically the same in\r\nthe two groups, and that our bodies, notwithstanding our superior moral\r\nqualities, are exposed to the same dangers, to the same disorders, as\r\nthe bodies of animals.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these resistances, it was necessary, as in the great\r\nexperiments on splenic fever, to attack a disease common both to\r\nmen and animals--one in which experimentation, the only, but great,\r\nstrength of Pasteur, was supreme. Hydrophobia offered these conditions.\r\n\r\nAgain, it was Dr. Lannelongue who introduced Pasteur to his first\r\ncase of hydrophobia. On December 10, 1880, a child of five years old,\r\nwho had been bitten in the face a month previously, was dying in the\r\nTrousseau Hospital. Devoured at the time by a raging thirst, and\r\nseized with a horror for all liquids, he approached with his lips the\r\nspout of a closed coffee pot, then suddenly started back--the throat\r\ncontracted--a prey to such fury that he insulted the nursing sister who\r\nwas attending on him. He was at the same time attacked by aerophobia\r\nto a prodigious degree. At a certain moment, the heel of one of his\r\nfeet protruded from the bed. An assistant blew on it. The child had not\r\nseen the assistant, and the breath of air was so light as to be almost\r\nimperceptible. The poor child flew into a rage, and a violent spasm\r\nseized him in the throat. The next day delirium began, a frightful\r\ndelirium. The frothy matters which filled his throat suffocated him.\r\n\r\nFour hours after his death, the mucus from the palate of the child\r\nwas collected. It was diluted with a little water, and two rabbits\r\nwere inoculated under the skin of the abdomen. The rabbits perished\r\nin less than thirty-six hours. The saliva of these dead rabbits also\r\ntransmitted the disease to fresh rabbits. Did it not seem as if one\r\nhad got hold of an inoculation of hydrophobia? Such was in fact the\r\nconclusion of Dr. Maurice Raynaud, who, having been informed, at the\r\nsame time as Pasteur, of the illness of the child, had made, on his own\r\naccount, some experiments on rabbits. His rabbits were dead. Already\r\na year previously M. Maurice Raynaud had announced the transmission,\r\nby the saliva, of rabies from man to rabbits. 'We are, then, in the\r\npresence of a new fact of this kind,' he said, 'and we really believe,\r\nuntil a proof to the contrary is given us, that these latter rabbits\r\ndied of hydrophobia.'\r\n\r\nWith his habitual prudence, and trusting more to the results of\r\nexperiment than to medical observation alone, Pasteur was not in a\r\nhurry to form such positive conclusions. He began by doing what Dr.\r\nMaurice Raynaud had neglected to do. He examined with the microscope\r\nthe tissues and the blood of the rabbits inoculated in the laboratory;\r\nhe discovered, both in those that were dead, and in those which were\r\non the point of death, the presence of a special microbe, easily\r\ncultivable in a pure state and of which the successive cultures caused\r\nthe death of other rabbits. Invariably, the same microbe appeared in\r\nthe blood. As one or two days sufficed to cause death, hydrophobia\r\ncould not have had time to make its appearance. Pasteur, moreover,\r\nfound this same microbe in the saliva of children who had died of\r\ncommon maladies, and even in the normal saliva of healthy adults.\r\nIt was a new microbe, causing a disease unknown up to that time. To\r\nPasteur it seemed, in the case of the experiments made with the mucus\r\nfrom the child's palate, to be simply an accompaniment of the rabic\r\nvirus.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis microbe of the saliva is very easily cultivated in sterile\r\ninfusions--that of veal, for example--and successive cultures can be\r\nmade in the usual way. The virulence continues. Could the virulence\r\nbe attenuated, asked Pasteur, by the action of the oxygen of the air?\r\nThis would, by a new example, go to establish the generalisation of the\r\nmethod of attenuation by oxygen. The attempt succeeded. When care is\r\ntaken, as with the attenuation of the fowl cholera contagium, not to\r\nallow more than some hours' interval to elapse between one cultivation\r\nand the succeeding one, the virulence of the successive cultivations\r\nof the microbe of the saliva is preserved in some sort indefinitely.\r\nIn other words, if it be arranged that the cultures succeed each other\r\nevery twelve hours, the rabbits inoculated from the last cultures die\r\nas quickly as those inoculated from the first. Thuillier had had the\r\npatience to make, in this manner, eighty cultures in contact with\r\nair, and eighty cultures in a vacuum; the microbe of the saliva being\r\nboth aerobic and anaerobic. The eightieth culture killed as quickly\r\nas the first. But by allowing the successive cultures to remain for\r\nsome time in contact with the air, before passing from one culture to\r\nthe following one, the virulence of the cultures becomes enfeebled.\r\nThus, then, as in fowl cholera, attenuated cultures of the microbe can\r\nbe obtained. Unlike what happens with cholera, however, the cultures\r\nof the microbe of the saliva, exposed to the contact of air, perish\r\nvery quickly. Two or three days of keeping suffice for the parent\r\ncultivation to lose all virulence. The seed, taken in any quantity from\r\nit, does not fertilise a new cultivation. But, before perishing, this\r\nculture passes through very different degrees of progressively weakened\r\nvirulence, and it is easy with these cultivations to render rabbits ill\r\nwithout causing their death. Once cured, they resist all inoculation\r\nwhich would be mortal for others. The oxygen of the air is manifestly\r\nthe transformer of this virulent virus into vaccine virus; for, if the\r\nvirulent blood or cultivations remain inclosed in their tubes, sealed\r\nfrom all entrance of the air, they retain not only for some hours, but\r\nfor months, their life and their original virulence.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut though these results were as new as they were unexpected, and\r\nthough one cause of confusion in the study of this terrible problem was\r\nremoved, yet these first researches were not marked by any progress in\r\nthe etiology of hydrophobia. The question remained wholly unsolved.\r\n\r\nImpatient with the length of time required for the incubation of the\r\ndisease, and with the obligation of waiting whole months for the result\r\nof an experiment, when the subject demanded such numerous ones, Pasteur\r\nbegan to seek some means of producing hydrophobia with certainty and\r\nof making it appear more rapidly. Notwithstanding the assertion of a\r\nprofessor of the veterinary school at Lyons that the saliva of the\r\nrabid dog alone contained the virus of the disease, and that he had\r\nfailed in every attempt to inoculate, whether with the substance of the\r\nbrain or with the spinal marrow of rabid dogs; Pasteur, with due care\r\nas to purity, introduced under the skin of some rabbits and some dogs,\r\ndivers parts of the brain of a dog which had died in a rabid state.\r\nHydrophobia declared itself in both dogs and rabbits, with a duration\r\nof incubation about equal to that which followed the ordinary bite of a\r\ndog. Although it was necessary still to submit to this long uncertainty\r\nwith regard to the incubation, one great result was obtained:\r\nhydrophobia _could_ be inoculated with other matter than saliva.\r\nNot only is the saliva always impure, containing a saliva microbe,\r\nwhich is endowed with a special virulence of its own, but it presents\r\nother inconveniences. It is necessary, in these researches, to have a\r\nsupply of material constantly at hand. Now, the saliva loses its rabic\r\nvirulence in twenty-four hours. The existence of the rabic virulence\r\nin the brain substance placed, on the contrary, at the disposal of the\r\nexperimenter, an abundance of the virus, in a state of great purity and\r\ncapable of long preservation.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe idea then occurred to Pasteur and his assistants, to inoculate\r\nthe virulent rabic matter in its pure state under the _dura mater_\r\non the surface of the brain of a dog. Why not carry the virus, said\r\nPasteur, directly to the place of its activity and development? After\r\nhaving trepanned the skull of a chloroformed dog, a little bit of the\r\nmedulla of an animal which had died of hydrophobia was deposited on\r\nthe surface of the brain. As soon as the influence of the chloroform\r\nwas dissipated, the dog recovered its healthy appearance. It ate its\r\nfood that same evening. But after some days the symptoms of hydrophobia\r\nappeared. The animal became dejected and restless; it tossed its\r\nlitter about, refused all nourishment. A doleful, sharp howling was\r\nthe first indication of the rabic voice, which is but one long cry\r\nof suffering and appeal, mingled with barkings from hallucinations.\r\nThe stomach became depraved; the dog swallowed hay and straw. It soon\r\ngrew furious, agitated with violent convulsions; finally, after a last\r\nfit, it died. During all this time there was great rejoicing in the\r\nlaboratory. They were at last in possession of a method for singularly\r\nshortening the period of incubation, and for communicating the disease\r\nwith certainty. The experiments were multiplied; all the dogs which\r\nwere trepanned, and which received on the surface of the brain a\r\nlittle of the medulla of the rabid animal, succumbed to the disease,\r\nwith very rare exceptions, within a period of twenty days. Did not the\r\nmethod pursued demonstrate, among other things, that hydrophobia is a\r\ndisease of the brain; that the seat of the rabic virus, far from being\r\nexclusively in the saliva, belongs, above all, to the cerebral matter?\r\n\r\nOther results, in addition to this one, were not slow in revealing\r\nthemselves. It was established that not only the brain, but the spinal\r\nmarrow, along its whole length, may be rabic, and that the nerves\r\nthemselves throughout their whole system, from the centre to the\r\nperiphery, may contain the virus of hydrophobia. If there exists a\r\nmicrobe of hydrophobia, its medium of cultivation in the body is, _par\r\nexcellence_, the brain, the spinal marrow, and the nerves. It was also\r\nestablished that there were localisations of virus in certain parts\r\nof the mucous system, and that the very considerable differences of\r\nrabic symptoms which exist in different cases of hydrophobia, must be\r\nsought for in this fact. At the moment of death the medulla oblongata\r\nis always rabic. Finally, it was established that hydrophobia could be\r\ngiven (and almost as rapidly as by trepanning) by inoculating rabic\r\nnervous matter into the circulation of the blood by a vein.\r\n\r\nIn presence of such facts it is easy to account for what takes place in\r\nthe case of a bite from a mad dog. The circulation of the blood carries\r\nthe virus to the surface of the brain, or to the surface of the spinal\r\nmarrow; there it houses itself in particular spots, and, little by\r\nlittle, invades the nervous matter. This last would be progressively\r\nattacked throughout, if death from the medulla oblongata did not almost\r\nalways supervene before the propagation of the virus can become general.\r\n\r\nThe saliva glands are often rabic, doubtless because the virus oozes\r\ninto them, little by little, from the nerves which enter these glands.\r\nThus may the presence of this virus be explained in the saliva of mad\r\ndogs, where, at all times since the disease was first known, it has\r\nbeen found to exist. When the first point attacked by the virus is the\r\nspinal marrow, or certain portions of it, a general paralysis often\r\nprecedes death. In this case the howling and biting symptoms are for\r\nthe most part absent, and the dog continues to be caressing until it\r\ndies.\r\n\r\nIn a thesis written by M. Roux, Pasteur's laboratory assistant, last\r\nJuly, we read the following:--'If we examine with care a little of\r\nthe pulp taken freshly from the brain of a rabid animal, and compare\r\nit with the same substance from the brain of a healthy animal, it is\r\ndifficult to distinguish any difference between the two. In the rabic\r\npulp, however, besides the granulations which are found in profusion\r\nin the healthy pulp, there seem to exist little grains of extreme\r\nminuteness, almost imperceptible even with the strongest microscopes.\r\nIn the cephalo-rachidic liquid so limpid in appearance, it is possible\r\nwith great attention to detect similar little grains. Can this be the\r\nmicrobe of hydrophobia? Some do not hesitate to affirm that it is.\r\nFor ourselves, as long as the cultivation of the microbe outside of\r\nthe organism has not been effected, and that hydrophobia has not been\r\ncommunicated by means of artificial cultures, we shall abstain from\r\nexpressing a definite opinion on the subject.'\r\n\r\nBut the grand problem in regard to hydrophobia is, not so much the\r\nisolation of the microbe, as the finding of a means of preventing this\r\nfrightful disease.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven now the experiments are in full swing. Biting dogs and bitten\r\ndogs fill the laboratory. Without reckoning the hundreds of mad dogs\r\nthat have died in the laboratory during the last three years, there\r\nnever occurs a case of hydrophobia in Paris of which Pasteur is not\r\ninformed. Not long ago a veterinary surgeon telegraphed to him, 'Attack\r\nat its height in poodle-dog and bull-dog. Come.' Pasteur invited me\r\nto accompany him, and we started, carrying six rabbits with us in a\r\nbasket. The two dogs were rabid to the last degree. The bull dog\r\nespecially, an enormous creature, howled and foamed in its cage. A\r\nbar of iron was held out to him: he threw himself upon it, and there\r\nwas great difficulty in drawing it away from his bloody fangs. One\r\nof the rabbits was then brought near to the cage, and its drooping\r\near was allowed to pass through the bars. But, notwithstanding this\r\nprovocation, the dog flung himself down at the bottom of his cage and\r\nrefused to bite.\r\n\r\nTwo youths then threw a cord with a slip loop over the dog, as a lasso\r\nis thrown. The animal was caught and drawn to the edge of the cage.\r\nThere they managed to get hold of him and to secure his jaws; and the\r\ndog, suffocating with fury, his eyes bloodshot, and his body convulsed\r\nwith a violent spasm, was extended upon a table and held motionless,\r\nwhile Pasteur, leaning over his foaming head, at the distance of a\r\nfinger's length, sucked up into a narrow tube some drops of the saliva.\r\nIn the basement of the veterinary surgeon's house, witnessing this\r\nformidable _tête-à-tête_, I thought Pasteur grander than I had ever\r\nthought him before.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\nFootnotes have been moved to the end of each chapter and renumbered\r\nconsecutively through the document.\r\n\r\nFootnotes 7 and 8 are [enclosed in brackets] in the original, and this\r\nhas been preserved.\r\n\r\nItalic text is denoted by _underscores_.\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been standardized.\r\n\r\nVariations in spelling and hyphenation were retained as they appear in\r\nthe original publication, except as noted below.\r\n\r\nChanges have been made as follows:\r\n\r\nEcole changed to École in several places (École Normale)\r\n\r\nPage ix: ETUDIES changed to STUDIES (STUDIES ON WINE)\r\n\r\nPage 48: buding changed to budding (multiplication by budding,)\r\n\r\nPage 166: nett changed to net (villa a net profit)\r\n\r\nPage 219: pebrine changed to pébrine (pébrine and flacherie, also)\r\n\r\nPage 258 earth worms changed to earth-worms (by the earth-worms.)\r\n\r\nPage 260: resistent changed to resistant (more resistant to the)",
