This method of treatment, practically unknown\r\nfifteen years ago, has advanced in popularity during the last decade in\r\na most remarkable manner, and in 1918 over forty millions of people are\r\nbeing supplied with chlorinated water.\r\n\r\nIt may justifiably be said that no other sanitary measure has\r\naccomplished so much at so small a cost; and that civilization owes a\r\ndeep debt of gratitude to the pioneers in municipal water chlorination:\r\nDr. A. C. Houston in England, and Mr. G. A. Johnson and Dr. Leal in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn this volume I have endeavoured to collect and correlate the\r\ninformation hitherto scattered in various journals and treatises and to\r\npresent it in a comprehensible manner. The various aspects and methods\r\nof chlorination are discussed and suggestions have been made which, I\r\nhope, will stimulate research work in this fertile field of science.\r\n\r\nI wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to the engineering staff of the\r\nOttawa Water Works Department and to Lieut. W. M. Bryce for the\r\npreparation of diagrams.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH RACE.\r\n\r\nOTTAWA, ONT.,\r\n\r\nApril, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n\r\n  I.

In mineral form, enormous deposits of\r\nsodium chloride are found in Galicia, Transylvania, Spain, in England\r\n(particularly in Cheshire), and in sections of North America. The most\r\nimportant deposits of potassium chloride are those at Stassfurt,\r\nGermany, where it occurs either in the crystalline condition as sylvine\r\nor combined with magnesium chloride as carnallite.\r\n\r\nChlorine was discovered by the Swedish chemist Scheele in 1774, but he,\r\nlike Lavoisier and his pupil Berthollet, who declared it an oxygenated\r\nmuriatic acid, was unaware of the elemental nature of the new substance.\r\nSir Humphrey Davy investigated this body in 1810 and definitely proved\r\nit to be an element; Davy designated the element chlorine from the Greek\r\n[Greek: chloros] = green.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to utilise chlorine, or its compounds, for bleaching\r\npurposes, appears to have been due to James Watt, who noticed the\r\ndecolourising properties of chlorine during a visit to Berthollet. This\r\nattempt ended in failure because of the destructive effect on the\r\nfibres, but, in later trials, this was prevented by first absorbing the\r\ngas in a solution of fixed alkali. These experiments proved the\r\npossibility of bleaching by means of chlorine compounds but the high\r\ncost of soda made the process unprofitable, and it was not until Henry\r\nsucceeded in preparing a combination with lime that could be reduced to\r\na dry powder that this mode of chemical bleaching became a commercial\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of chloride of lime (hypochlorite of lime, bleaching\r\npowder, bleach) was taken up by Charles Tennant in 1799 at St. Rollox\r\nnear Glasgow, and in 1800 about 50 tons were sold at a price of $680\r\n(L139) per ton.\r\n\r\nChlorine is produced as a by-product in the manufacture of soda by the\r\nLeblanc process, but until 1865, when the British Alkali Act stopped the\r\ndischarge of hydrochloric acid vapours into the atmosphere, the\r\ndevelopment of the bleaching powder industry was not rapid. The\r\nhydrochloric acid that was formerly discharged into the air as a waste\r\nproduct afterwards became a valuable asset that enabled the Leblanc\r\nprocess to successfully compete with the newer ammonia-soda process. In\r\n1890 another competitor to the Leblanc process was introduced when\r\ncaustic and chlorine were produced in Germany by electrolytic methods.\r\nAfter the successful development of this method in Germany, it was taken\r\nup in the United States of America and in 1912 more than 30,000\r\nelectrical horse-power were daily used in this industry. In 1914 the\r\nalmost complete cessation of exports of bleach from Europe raised the\r\nprice, which attained phenomenal heights in 1916 (cf. page 125), and\r\nstimulated the production of bleach both in the U. S. A. and Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.--BLEACH STATISTICS.

A committee of the\r\nAmerican Public Health Association reported in 1885 that chloride of\r\nlime was the best disinfectant available when cost and efficiency were\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nEau de Javelle, first made by Percy at the Javelle works near Paris in\r\n1792, is another chlorine compound that has enjoyed a considerable\r\nreputation as a disinfectant and deodouriser for over a century; it is\r\nessentially a mixture of sodium chloride and sodium hypochlorite.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of electrolytic hypochlorites dates back to 1859, when\r\nWatt found that chlorides of the fixed alkalies and alkaline earths\r\nyielded hypochlorites on being submitted to the action of an electrical\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of the last century disinfection was regarded as a\r\nprocess that arrested or prevented putrefactive changes but the nature\r\nof these changes was imperfectly comprehended and micro-organisms were\r\nnot associated with them.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Theodor Schwann,[1] who might be regarded as the founder of the\r\nschool of antiseptics, reported that \"Fermentation is arrested by any\r\ninfluence capable of killing fungi, especially by heat, potassium\r\narseniate, etc....\"; but his results were not accepted by the adherents\r\nof the theory of spontaneous generation and it was not until the\r\npublication of the work of Schroder and Dusch[2] that Schwann's views\r\nwere even partially accepted. The final refutation to the spontaneous\r\ngeneration theory was given by the monumental researches of Pasteur who,\r\nin 1862, proved the possibility of preparing sterile culture media and\r\ndemonstrated the manner in which they could be protected from\r\ncontamination. Bacteria and other micro-organisms were shown to be\r\nresponsible for the phenomena that had been attributed previously to the\r\n\"oxygen of the air,\" and from this period the development of\r\nbacteriology as a science proceeded rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe next important step, from the public health standpoint, was the\r\ndiscovery by Koch, in 1876, that a specific bacterium (_B. anthracis_)\r\nwas the cause of a specific disease in cattle (anthrax or splenic\r\nfever). In 1882 Koch made a further advance by developing a solid\r\nculture medium which permitted disinfectants and antiseptics to be\r\nstudied quantitatively with a greater degree of accuracy than had been\r\npossible previously.\r\n\r\nSince 1845, when Semmelweiss succeeded in stamping out puerperal fever\r\nin Vienna, where it had been so long established as to be endemic,\r\nchlorine has been very generally employed in sanitary work and the\r\nconditions necessary for obtaining successful results have been\r\npartially elucidated. Baxter was the first to state that the\r\ndisinfecting action depended more upon the nature of the pabulum than\r\nupon the specific organism present and this was confirmed later by Kuhn,\r\nBucholtz, and Haberkorn. The latter found that urine consumed large\r\nquantities of chlorine before any disinfection occurred.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest preparations used in sanitary work was an\r\nelectrolysed sea water, usually known as Hermite Fluid. This was\r\nintroduced by M. Hermite in 1889 and was employed for domestic purposes\r\nand for flushing sewers and latrines. It was used at Brest for the\r\ndissolution of faecal matter and a prolonged trial was given to it at\r\nWorthing in 1894. The report of Dupre and Klein, who conducted the\r\nbacteriological examinations, was against the process, but Ruffer and\r\nRoscoe reported more favourably and further trials were carried out at\r\nHavre, l'Orient, and Nice. The _Lancet_ (May 26, 1894) reported at\r\nlength upon the Worthing experiments: it was found that during the\r\nelectrolysis of the sea water, the magnesium chloride was also partially\r\nconverted into hypochlorite, which then dissociated into magnesium\r\nhydrate and hypochlorous acid; the former deposited in the electrolyser\r\nand left the solution acid and unstable; urine was found to act upon it\r\nat once with a consequent loss in strength of over 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nAnother electrolytic method was that of Webster,[3] who installed an\r\nexperimental plant at Crossness, near London, in 1889. A low-tension\r\ndirect current was passed between iron electrodes placed in the sewage\r\nand although the process was largely one of chemical precipitation,\r\nWebster noted the disinfecting value of the hypochlorite formed from the\r\nchlorides normally present in the sewage. He also directed the attention\r\nof sanitarians to the possibility of using sea water as a cheap source\r\nof chlorides and a plant based on this principle was erected in Bradford\r\nin 1890 and reported upon by McLintock.[4]\r\n\r\nStrong salt solutions were substituted for sea water by Woolf and the\r\nproduct was commercially known as \"Electrozone.\" A plant of this\r\ndescription was installed at Brewster, N. Y., in 1893[5] for\r\nchlorinating the sewage from a small group of houses. The sewage was\r\ndischarged into a small creek which polluted Croton Lake. Successful\r\nresults led to a similar treatment near Tonetta Creek.[6] This was\r\napparently the first occasion on which the specific object was the\r\ndestruction of bacteria.\r\n\r\nElectrozone was used at Maidenhead, on the Thames, in 1897 and the\r\ninstallation was reported upon by Robinson, Kanthack, and Rideal in\r\n1898. Kanthack found that a dosage 3-3.6 p.p.m. reduced the organisms in\r\na sewage effluent to 10-50 per c.cm. whilst Rideal found that about 18\r\np.p.m. of chlorine produced a condition of sterility in 1 c.cm.\r\n\r\nChloride of lime had previously been used in the London sewage as a\r\ndeodourant by Dibden in 1884 but the treatment was not successful and\r\nwas abandoned in favour of other oxidisers.\r\n\r\nDuring the last decade of the twentieth century the use of bleach for\r\nthe disinfection of both sewage and water received the attention of many\r\nwell-known German sanitarians and many important results were obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier experiments made at Hamburg, Proskauer and Elsner[7]\r\nobtained satisfactory results with 3-4 p.p.m. of chlorine on a clarified\r\nsewage with 10 minutes contact. Dunbar and Zirn (_ibid._) used crude\r\nsewage and found that 17 p.p.m. of available chlorine were required to\r\nremove _B. typhosus_ and cholera vibria with a contact period of two\r\nhours. A striking feature of all the German work on chlorination is the\r\nvery high degree of purification aimed at: quantities as large as one\r\nlitre were tested for specific organisms and in many of the experiments\r\nwith sewage _B. coli_ was found to be absent from a considerable\r\npercentage of the samples.\r\n\r\nThe importance of previously removing suspended matter, which could not\r\nbe penetrated by the germicide, was emphasised by Schwartz[8] although\r\nit had been previously noted by Schumacher.\r\n\r\nAt the Royal Testing Station in Berlin, numerous experiments on sewage\r\nchlorination were made by Kranejuhl and Kurpjuivut.[9] The results were\r\njudged by the _B. coli_ content, which was taken as an index of\r\npathogenicity because this typical intestinal bacillus was found to be\r\nmore frequent and less viable than the majority of the pathogenic\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nOther important work on this subject was carried out, in connection with\r\nthe pollution of the Hooghly River, by a Bengal Government Commission in\r\n1904; and by the State Board of Health of Ohio in co-operation with the\r\nBureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nin 1907. The chlorination experiments of the latter were reported by\r\nKellerman, Pratt, and Kimberly.[10]\r\n\r\nThe most valuable contribution to the disinfection of sewage was that of\r\nPhelps,[11] who critically examined the work of previous experimenters\r\nand directed attention to the unnecessary stringent standards adopted in\r\nEuropean practice. His work at Boston in 1906, at Red Bank, N. J., and\r\nat Baltimore in 1907, demonstrated in an indubitable manner the economic\r\npossibilities of sewage chlorination. The dosages necessary for crude\r\nsewage and filter effluents were indicated and also the necessary\r\ncontact periods. This work marks the commencement of a new era in\r\nsanitary science.\r\n\r\nThe first occasion on which chlorine compounds were first used for the\r\ndisinfection of water cannot be definitely ascertained. It has been\r\nstated to the author that bleach was used for treating wells as early as\r\n1850 but this treatment was apparently made without definite knowledge\r\nof the destruction of micro-organisms.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, Sims Woodhead employed bleach solutions for the sterilisation\r\nof the distribution mains at Maidstone, Kent, subsequent to an epidemic\r\nof typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nThe credit for the first systematic use of chlorine in water\r\ndisinfection is due to A. C. Houston with whom McGowan was associated in\r\nthe work carried out at Lincoln in 1904-1905.[12] The reservoirs,\r\nfilters, and distribution system, owing to flood conditions, became\r\ninfected with typhoid bacilli which caused a severe epidemic amongst the\r\nconsumers. The storage and purifications works were thoroughly treated\r\nwith a solution of \"chloros\" (sodium hypochlorite containing\r\napproximately 10 per cent of available chlorine) which was regulated to\r\ngive an approximate dosage of 1 part per million. The bacteriological\r\nresults were entirely satisfactory but many complaints were received\r\nthat the treatment had imparted a mawkish taste to the water. This was\r\nattributed to the action of the alkaline chloros on the organic\r\nimpurities in the water. It was also stated that the water injured\r\nplants, fish, and birds and extracted abnormal amounts of tannin from\r\ntea but no substantiating evidence was produced in support of these\r\ncomplaints. Houston made a continuous physiological test of the effect\r\nof the chlorinated water on small fish by suspending a cage of gold fish\r\nin the filter effluent chamber and also proved that the treatment had no\r\nappreciable effect on the plumbo-solvency of the supply.\r\n\r\nNesfield, of the Indian Army Medical Service,[13] reported in 1903 the\r\nresults of numerous experiments on the destruction of pathogenic\r\norganisms by chlorine compounds and suggested their use in military work\r\nto prevent a recurrence of the appalling loss of life from water-borne\r\ndiseases (especially enteric fever) such as took place during the Boer\r\nWar. Nesfield proposed to use about 100 p.p.m. of available chlorine and\r\nto remove the excess after a contact period of 10 minutes. This work is\r\nespecially interesting from the historical standpoint because it\r\ncontains the first suggestion of the possibilities of compressed\r\nchlorine gas in steel cylinders.\r\n\r\nA few years later, electrolytic hypochlorite (oxychloride) was used at\r\nGuildford by Rideal and various chlorine compounds were tried on the\r\nwater of the Seine and Vanne, in France, and at Middlekerke and Ostend,\r\nin Belgium. Experimental work on water chlorination was also reported by\r\nThresh and by Moor and Hewlett.[14]\r\n\r\nDuring the nineties many experiments on water chlorination were made by\r\nTraube, Sickenberger, Kauffman, Berge, Bassenge, and others. Traube[15]\r\nwas able to completely sterilise water rich in bacteria in 2 hours by\r\nthe addition of bleach equal to 1.06 p.p.m. of available chlorine. At\r\nthe end of the contact period about 90 per cent of the added chlorine\r\nwas unabsorbed and was destroyed by the addition of sodium bisulphite.\r\nBassenge[16] followed up the work of Traube and that of Sickenberger and\r\nKauffman, who had shown that it was possible to destroy cholera vibrio\r\nin Nile water by means of sodium hypochlorite. Bassenge used higher\r\nconcentrations than Traube and found it possible to destroy _B.\r\ntyphosus_ and _B. coli_ in ten minutes with 60-90 p.p.m. of available\r\nchlorine. The excess was destroyed by adding calcium bisulphite.\r\nLode[17] experimented with waters seeded with _B. coli_, _B. typhosus_,\r\nand _B. tetani_ and found, contrary to Traube, that 1-2 p.p.m. of\r\nchlorine did not sterilise in two hours. _B. coli_ was usually destroyed\r\nby 4 p.p.m. of chlorine in ten minutes and even better results were\r\nobtained with _B. typhosus_ and cholera vibrio: the former was destroyed\r\nin one hour by 1 p.p.m. and in ten minutes by 2 p.p.m.; the latter\r\norganism required 1-2 p.p.m. with a twenty-minute contact period. Lode\r\nnoted that organic matter lowered the bactericidal activity of chlorine\r\nand recommended the use of 30 p.p.m. of chlorine to ensure rapid and\r\ncomplete sterilisation. Berge[18] used chlorine peroxide, generated by\r\nthe action of hydrochloric acid on potassium chlorate, for the\r\nsterilisation of water and this process was afterwards used at Ostend at\r\na plant having a capacity of about 1,300,000 gallons per day. The dosage\r\nwas equal to 0.53 p.p.m. of available chlorine and coke filters were\r\nused to destroy the excess although they were not found to be\r\nindispensable as the free chlorine disappeared spontaneously. This\r\nprocess appears to have been tried on the Brussels supply and also for\r\nthe treatment of a hospital supply at Petrograd.\r\n\r\nThe object of German sanitarians seems to have been to obtain\r\npractically instantaneous sterilisation of water for the use of\r\ntravellers and troops in the field. Until the commencement of the\r\nEuropean War they did not have a high opinion of chlorination and\r\ngenerally regarded it as inefficient. Schumberg[19] expressed the\r\nopinion that no chemical method of disinfection could be absolutely\r\nrelied upon, under all circumstances, to prove fatal to bacteria.\r\nPlucker[20] stated that several investigators, particularly Schuder, had\r\nshown that chlorine, even in the proportion of 40 p.p.m. did not\r\ninvariably destroy cholera vibrio and _B. typhosus_; and that with\r\nsmaller doses the destruction was still less complete. He also stated\r\nthat the bacteriological experiments of American workers were open to\r\ncriticism and that they employed antiquated methods.\r\n\r\nBy 1916 the German sanitarians appeared to have realised that their\r\nbacteriological standards were too stringent (Langer[21]) and that the\r\nprocess had proved its value in an indisputable manner.\r\n\r\nEuropean practice, in the comparatively few instances in which it has\r\nbeen used, has been to employ large doses of chlorine and to remove the\r\nexcess by chemicals or by filtration through special media. In 1916,\r\nhowever, London commenced to chlorinate a portion of its supply and the\r\nfollowing year practically the whole supply was chlorinated. A dosage of\r\napproximately 0.5 p.p.m. is used and the bleach solution is added to\r\nthe pre-filtered water. Worcester is also proposing to chlorinate the\r\nsupply to maintain the purity of the water without extending the slow\r\nsand filtration plant.\r\n\r\nIn North America, hypochlorite of soda and chlorine were used on the\r\nJewell Filter at the Louisville Experimental Station in about 1896 by\r\nGeorge W. Fuller and a year later they were used at Adrian by Jewell.\r\nThe first commercial successful attempt was made by G. A. Johnson. In\r\n1908 the Union Stock Yards Company of Chicago were proceeded against by\r\nthe City of Chicago regarding the condition of the effluent of the\r\nBubbly Creek filter plant. Copper sulphate had been previously used in\r\nconjunction with the filters but stock shippers complained that the\r\nwater had a deleterious effect upon the animals consuming it. Johnson\r\neliminated the copper treatment and substituted bleach which was added\r\nseven and a half hours previous to filtration, with a dosage of 1.5\r\np.p.m. The results were very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Johnson and Leal commenced the treatment of the\r\nBoonton supply of Jersey City, N. J., consumed about 40 million gallons\r\nper day. The water was first treated with 36 pounds of bleach per\r\nmillion gallons (1.4 p.p.m. of available chlorine) but this quantity was\r\ngradually reduced until only 5 pounds per million gallons (0.2 p.p.m. of\r\nchlorine) were being used in April, 1909. The ability of the process to\r\nadequately purify water became the cause of a lawsuit and the decision\r\nof the Court was:\r\n\r\n\"From the proofs taken before me, of the constant observation of the\r\neffect of this device, I am of the opinion and find that it is an\r\neffective process which destroys in the water the germs, the presence of\r\nwhich is deemed to indicate danger, including the pathogenic germs, so\r\nthat the water after this treatment attains a purity much beyond that\r\nattained in water supplies of other municipalities. The reduction and\r\npractical elimination of such germs from the water was shown to be\r\nsubstantially continuous.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the proofs before me, I find that the solution described leaves no\r\ndeleterious substances in the water. It does produce a slight increase\r\nin the hardness but the increase is so slight as in my judgment to be\r\nnegligible.\r\n\r\n\"I do therefore find and report that this device is capable of rendering\r\nthe water delivered in Jersey City pure and wholesome, for the purposes\r\nfor which it is intended and is effective in removing from the water\r\nthose dangerous germs which were deemed by the decree to possibly exist\r\ntherein at certain times.\"[22]\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years the use of hypochlorite in water purification,\r\nboth alone and in conjunction with filtration, became very popular and\r\nin 1911 over 800 million gallons per day were treated in this manner.\r\nAmongst the users were some of the largest cities in North America,\r\nincluding Brooklyn, Albany, and New York City, N. Y., Cincinnati and\r\nColumbus, Ohio, Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, and Erie, Pa.,\r\nHartford, Conn., Nashville, Tenn., St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo.,\r\nMontreal, P. Q., Toronto and Ottawa, Ont., Baltimore, Md., and\r\nMinneapolis, Minn. At present (1918) over 3,000 million gallons per day\r\nare being chlorinated in North America and more than 1,000 cities and\r\ntowns are employing this process.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n[1] Schwann.

The general composition of commercial\r\nbleach is fairly uniform. This is shown in the following analyses of\r\nwhich two are of German bleach examined by Lunge and one of Canadian\r\nmanufacture analysed by the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------+----------------+--------\r\n                                 |     Lunge.     | Race.\r\n  -------------------------------+--------+-------+--------\r\n                                 |   %    |   %   |   %\r\n  Available chlorine             | 37.00  | 38.30 | 37.50\r\n  Chlorine as chlorides          |  0.35  |  0.59 |  0.52\r\n  Chlorine as chlorates          |  0.25  |  0.08 |  0.18\r\n  Lime                           | 44.49  | 43.34 | 44.12\r\n  Magnesia                       |  0.40  |  0.31 |  1.28\r\n  Iron oxide                     |  0.05  |  0.04 |  0.11\r\n  Alumina                        |  0.43  |  0.41 |  0.46\r\n  Carbon dioxide                 |  0.18  |  0.31 |  0.22\r\n  Silica                         |  0.40  |  0.30 |  0.52\r\n  Water and undetermined         | 16.45  | 16.32 | 15.09\r\n  -------------------------------+--------+-------+--------\r\n\r\nFrom these analyses the constitutional of commercial bleach might be\r\nrepresented by the formula\r\n\r\n  4CaOCl_{2}.2Ca(OH)_{2}.5H_{2}O\r\n\r\nwhich assumes it to contain:\r\n\r\n      68.0 per cent of calcium hypochlorite,\r\n      20.0 per cent of calcium hydroxide,\r\n  and 12.0 per cent of water.\r\n\r\nIn this formula calcium hypochlorite has been written CaOCl_{2}, but\r\nthis substance actually contains one atom of oxygen less than the true\r\nhypochlorite, which has the constitutional formula ClO-Ca-OCl. This\r\ndifference led some of the earlier chemists to regard CaOCl_{2} as a\r\nmixture of equal molecules of calcium chloride and calcium hypochlorite\r\n(CaCl_{2} + Ca(OCl)_{2} = 2CaOCl_{2}), but it has been definitely\r\nestablished that no calcium chloride exists in the free state in dry\r\ncommercial bleach.\r\n\r\nSince the very earliest days when the process of bleaching was\r\ninvestigated it was considered to be a process of oxidation and it is\r\nnot surprising that Lavoisier and his pupils, who had noted the strong\r\ndecolourising action of the gas discovered previously by Scheele, should\r\nregard it as a compound that contained oxygen. They were confirmed in\r\nthis view by the fact that an aqueous solution of the gas slowly evolved\r\noxygen when placed in bright sunlight, and lost its bleaching\r\nproperties. Watt disproved this and showed that the evolution of oxygen\r\nwas due to the action of the chlorine on water.\r\n\r\n  Cl_{2} + H_{2}O = 2HCl + O.\r\n\r\nThe bleaching action was not due to the chlorine \"per se\" but to the\r\nnascent oxygen produced in the presence of moisture. Later, when bleach\r\nand other chlorine compounds came into use as deodourisers, their action\r\nwas attributed to the oxygen produced and when their germicidal\r\nproperties became known it was natural to assume that the destruction of\r\nbacteria was due to the same cause. Some of the earlier experimental\r\nwork supported this view. Fischer and Proskauer[1] found that humidity\r\nplayed an important part in chlorine disinfection, probably because it\r\nfavoured oxidation. In air saturated with moisture micro-organisms were\r\nkilled by 0.3 per cent of chlorine in three hours but when the air was\r\ndry practically no action occurred. They concluded that chlorine was not\r\ndirectly toxic. Warouzoff, Winogradoff, and Kolessnikoff[2] were unable\r\nto confirm the results of Fischer and Proskauer and found that a mixture\r\nof chlorine gas and air killed tetanus spores in one minute.\r\n\r\nThe nascent oxygen hypothesis was clearly and succinctly expressed by\r\nProf. Leal during the hearing of the Boonton, N. J., case and the\r\nfollowing abstracts have been taken from his evidence:\r\n\r\n\"... That on the addition of bleach to water the loosely formed\r\ncombination forming the bleach splits up into chloride of calcium and\r\nhypochlorite of calcium. The chloride of calcium being inert, the\r\nhypochlorite acted upon by the carbonic acid in the water either free or\r\nhalf bound, splits up into carbonate of calcium and hypochlorous acid.\r\nThe hypochlorous acid in the presence of oxidisable matter gives off its\r\noxygen; hydrochloric acid being left. The hydrochloric acid then drives\r\noff the weaker carbonic acid and unites with the calcium forming\r\nchloride of calcium.\r\n\r\n\"That the process was wholly an oxidising one, the work being done\r\nentirely by the oxygen set free from the hypochlorous acids in the\r\npresence of oxidizable matter....\r\n\r\n\"We have used during our investigations, the term 'potential oxygen' as\r\nexpressing its factor of power. When set free, it is really nascent or\r\natomic oxygen and is, in its most active state, entirely different from\r\nthe oxygen normally in water....\"\r\n\r\nThe reactions suggested are expressed in the following equations:\r\n\r\n    (i).  2CaOCl_{2} = CaCl_{2} + Ca(OCl)_{2}\r\n\r\n   (ii). Ca(OCl)_{2} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O = CaCO_{3} + 2HClO\r\n\r\n  (iii). 2HClO = 2HCl + O_{2}\r\n\r\n   (iv). CaCO_{3} + 2HCl = CaCl_{2} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nPhelps, during the hearing of this case, suggested that hypochlorites\r\nwere directly toxic to micro-organisms but this view was not supported\r\nby any definite evidence and the nascent oxygen hypothesis met with\r\nalmost universal acceptance. Investigations made by the author in 1915,\r\n1916 and 1917 have produced data which cannot be adequately explained by\r\nthe nascent oxygen hypothesis.[3]\r\n\r\nThe disinfecting action of bleach can be most conveniently considered by\r\nregarding it as a heterogeneous mixture of the reactants and resultants\r\nof the reaction\r\n\r\n  CaO + H_{2}O + Cl_{2} <=> CaOCl_{2} + H_{2}O\r\n\r\nwhich is in equilibrium for the temperature and pressure obtaining\r\nduring the process of manufacture. Under suitable physical conditions\r\nthe chlorine content can be increased to 40-42 per cent but such a\r\nproduct is not so stable as those represented by the analyses on page 14\r\nand which contain approximately 20 per cent of excess hydrate of lime.\r\nThe stability of bleach depends upon this excess of base (Griffen and\r\nHedallen[4]) and although magnesia can be partially substituted for this\r\nexcess of lime, a minimum of 5 per cent of free hydrate of lime is\r\nrequired to ensure stability.\r\n\r\nOn dissolving bleach in water the first action is the decomposition of\r\ncalcium oxychloride into an equal number of molecules of calcium\r\nhypochlorite and calcium chloride.\r\n\r\n  2CaOCl_{2} = Ca(OCl)_{2} + CaCl_{2}.\r\n\r\nIn dilute solution these salts are dissociated and hydrolysis tends to\r\noccur in accordance with the equations\r\n\r\n  2Ca(OCl)_{2} + 4H_{2}O <=> 2Ca(OH)_{2} + HOCl + HCl and\r\n\r\n  CaCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O <=> Ca(OH)_{2} + 2HCl.\r\n\r\nCalcium hydrate and hydrochloric acid are both practically completely\r\ndissociated, i.e. there is a large and equal quantity of H^{.} and OH',\r\nand the product is much greater than K_{_w_} (ionic product of water),\r\nand hence there is a combination of these ions, leaving the solution\r\nneutral and no undissociated acid or base exists. This statement is only\r\napproximately correct as hydrochloric acid is slightly more dissociated\r\nthan calcium hydroxide (ratio 9:8) and the solution is consequently\r\nslightly acid, i.e. the H^{.} concentration is greater than 1 x 10^{-7}.\r\n\r\nHypochlorous acid is only very slightly dissociated, especially in the\r\npresence of the OCl' ion due to the dissociation of the Ca(OCl)_{2}, as\r\ncompared with Ca(OH)_{2} and hydrolysis of the Ca(OCl)_{2} proceeds with\r\nincreased dilution. The action is best represented by the equation\r\n\r\n  2Ca(OCl)_{2} + 2H_{2}O <=> CaCl_{2} + Ca(OH)_{2} + 2HOCl\r\n\r\nThe hydrolytic constant of hypochlorous acid has apparently not been\r\ndetermined but as the acid is weaker than carbonic acid, which has a\r\nhydrolytic constant of 1 x 10^{-4}, the value is probably between 1 x\r\n10^{-3} and 1 x 10^{-4}. From the formula _x_^{2}/(1 - _x_)_v_ =\r\n_k__{_wv_} in which 1 mole of pure Ca(OCl)_{2} is dissolved in _v_\r\nlitres, _x_ is the fraction hydrolysed, and _k__{_wv_} is the hydrolytic\r\nconstant, complete hydrolysis occurs (_x_ = 1) when _v_ is not greater\r\nthan 1 x 10^{4} litres. This is equivalent to a concentration of not\r\nless than 7.1 p.p.m. of available chlorine. Solutions of pure\r\nhypochlorites are alkaline in reaction because of the excess of hydroxyl\r\nions (minimum concentration 1 x 10^{-4}). In solutions of bleach the\r\nhydrolytic action is retarded by the OH' due to the free base, and\r\naccelerated by the excess of H^{.} caused by the dissociation and\r\npartial hydrolysis of CaCl_{2}; the final result is determined by the\r\nrelative proportions and the effect of the free base usually\r\npreponderates. The addition of any substance that reduces the OH'\r\nconcentration enables hydrolysis to proceed to completion and affords a\r\nrational explanation of the fact that solutions of bleach, on\r\ndistillation with such weak acids as boric acid, yield a solution of\r\nhypochlorous acid. It also explains why the addition of an acid is\r\nnecessary in Bunsen's method (_vide_ p. 79) of analysing hypochlorite\r\nsolutions. It has been stated that when hydrochloric acid is employed\r\nthe increase in the oxidising power is due to the action of the acid\r\nupon calcium chloride but this never occurs under ordinary conditions;\r\nweak acids such as carbonic or acetic will give practically the same\r\nresult as hydrochloric acid in solutions of bleach of the strength used\r\nin water treatment. The slightly higher result obtained with strong\r\nacids is due to the decomposition of chlorates.\r\n\r\nThe effect of dilution alone is shown by the data given below. A 2 per\r\ncent bleach solution, containing very little excess base, was diluted\r\nwith distilled water and the various dilutions titrated with\r\nthiosulphate after the addition of potassium iodide. In one series the\r\nsolutions were titrated directly, and after acidification in the other.\r\nThe results[A] were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROLYSIS OF BLEACH SOLUTION\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------+-----------------------\r\n  Strength of Solution.

The above figures are only applicable to the particular\r\nsample used; other samples containing different excesses of base would\r\nyield different hydrolytic values. The results are in agreement with the\r\nhypothesis presented and confirm the theoretical deduction that very\r\ndilute bleach solutions are completely hydrolysed if no salts are\r\npresent that will dissociate and increase the OH' concentration.\r\nHydrolysis is reduced by caustic alkalies and alkaline carbonates, and\r\nincreased by acids and acid carbonates that reduce the OH'\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\nThe effect of chlorides is anomalous and no adequate explanation for\r\ntheir action can be given at present. The addition of small quantities\r\nof sodium chloride (0.1 per cent) increases the hydrolysis of bleach\r\nsolutions but much larger quantities tend to the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these substances upon the velocity of the germicidal\r\naction of bleach solutions is in the same direction as the hydrolysing\r\neffect.[4] Sodium chloride in quantities up to 10 parts per million has\r\na very limited effect but larger quantities (90 p.p.m.) increase the\r\nvelocity of the reaction. Sodium chloride, in the absence of\r\nhypochlorites, was found to have no influence upon the viability of _B.\r\ncoli_ in water.\r\n\r\nIn quantities up to approximately 5 p.p.m., sodium hydroxide has but\r\nlittle influence; 5-10 p.p.m. reduce the velocity to a marked degree,\r\nbut when the quantity of caustic is still further increased the\r\ngermicidal action of the alkali commences to be appreciable and may\r\nnullify the retarding action on the hypochlorite. Normal carbonates tend\r\nto reduce the velocity of the germicidal action and bicarbonates to\r\nincrease it.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid, even in very small quantities (5 p.p.m.), has a marked\r\naccelerating effect and the total effect produced is much greater than\r\ncan be accounted for by the germicidal activity of the acid alone. Weak\r\nacids such as carbonic acid and acetic acid are also effective\r\naccelerators. In one experiment a 0.01 per cent solution of bleach was\r\nfound to be 40 per cent hydrolysed. By passing carbonic acid gas this\r\nwas increased to 95 per cent and the velocity of the germicidal action\r\nof this solution was found to be approximately 100 per cent greater than\r\nthat of the uncarbonated one. Norton and Hsu[5] have shown that the\r\ngermicidal activity of some disinfectants is a function of the hydrogen\r\nion concentration, but this factor is insufficient to account for the\r\neffect of acids on bleach solutions.\r\n\r\nThe effect of sodium chloride on the bacteriological results, like that\r\non the hydrolytic constant, is anomalous. Similar effects have been\r\nobserved on the addition of this salt to phenol and other disinfectants.\r\nThe _raison d'etre_ of the increased activity is obscure but it is\r\npossible that the salt renders the organisms more susceptible to the\r\naction of the germicide.\r\n\r\nAmmonia, though decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration of bleach and\r\nother hypochlorite solutions, markedly increases the velocity of the\r\nreaction; chlorinated derivatives of ammonia (chloramines), which have a\r\nspecific germicidal action, are formed. These will be discussed at\r\nlength in Chapter IX, p. 115.\r\n\r\nRideal[6] has shown that the addition of ammonia to sodium hypochlorite\r\ndestroys the bleaching activity in acid solution. This has been found by\r\nthe author to be also true for calcium hypochlorite (bleach). If the\r\nbleaching effect is due to oxidation, the oxidising power of\r\nhypochlorites must be considered to be destroyed by the addition of\r\nammonia. The property of oxidising organic matter in water is also\r\ndestroyed; this is well illustrated in Table II which shows the rate of\r\nabsorption of chlorine and chloramine by the Ottawa River water. The\r\nwater used in this experiment contained 40 p.p.m. of colour and absorbed\r\n9.5 p.p.m. of oxygen (30 mins. at 100 deg. C.).\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II.[A]\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-------------------------------------------------\r\n                    |   ABSORPTION OF AVAILABLE CHLORINE AT 63 deg.

They attributed\r\nthe marked beneficial action to the formation of chloramines _in situ_\r\nby the action of hypochlorous acid upon amino acids and proteid bodies.\r\nCompound chloramines (chlorinated aminobenzoic acids) were prepared in\r\nthe laboratory and found to give excellent results in reducing wound\r\ninfection. Later, other compounds were prepared for the purpose of\r\nsterilising small quantities of water for the use of mobile troops (see\r\np. 128).\r\n\r\nRideal[6] was the first to note the strong germicidal power of\r\nchloramine and attributed the persistent germicidal activity of\r\nhypochlorites in sewage to the formation of chloramine and chloramine\r\nderivatives.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence against the nascent oxygen theory of chlorine\r\ndisinfection is to be found in the fact that such active oxidising\r\nagents as sodium, potassium, and hydrogen peroxides have a much lower\r\ngermicidal activity than chlorine when compared on the basis of their\r\noxygen equivalents. Table III shows chlorine to be approximately five\r\ntimes as active as potassium permanganate when compared on this basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III.[A]--COMPARISON OF BLEACH AND POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE\r\n\r\n  -----------+------------------+-------------------\r\n             |     BLEACH       |\r\n             |Available Chlorine|     POTASSIUM\r\n  Contact    |    0.35 p.p.m.   |   PERMANGANATE.\r\n    Period.  +------------------+-------------------\r\n             |Oxygen Equivalent.

Hypochlorous acid\r\nis far superior to hydrogen peroxide as a germicidal agent and is as\r\nactive as ozone, which liberates a greater amount of energy.\r\n\r\n  2HClO = 2HCl + O_{2} + 18,770 calories\r\n\r\n  2H_{2}O_{2} = 2H_{2}O + O_{2} + 46,120 calories\r\n\r\n  2O_{3} = 3O_{2} + 60,000 calories.\r\n\r\nAgain, solutions of chlorine gas and hypochlorites having the same\r\noxidising activity, as determined by titration with thiosulphate after\r\nthe addition of potassium iodide and acid, i.e. contain equal amounts of\r\navailable chlorine, show approximately the same germicidal activity in\r\nwater. On the addition of ammonia, the hypochlorite solutions retain\r\ntheir ability to liberate iodine from potassium iodide (Wagner test) but\r\nthe property of oxidising such dyestuffs as indigo is destroyed and the\r\ngermicidal activity is increased. Ammonia, when added to solutions of\r\nchlorine gas, diminishes the property of liberating iodine from\r\npotassium iodide, the bleaching effect on dyestuffs, and the germicidal\r\naction. It is often assumed that chlorine forms hypochlorous acid on\r\nsolution in water Cl_{2} + H_{2}O = HClO + HCl but the results obtained\r\non the addition of ammonia indicate that either very little hypochlorous\r\nacid is formed or that ammonia and hypochlorous acid do not form\r\nchloramine in the presence of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nWhen chlorine gas was treated with a 0.5 per cent solution of ammonia in\r\nthe proportion of 1 molecule of chlorine to 1.90-1.95 molecules of\r\nammonia, Noyes and Lyon[8] found that nitrogen and nitrogen-trichloride\r\nwere formed in equimolar quantities.\r\n\r\n  12NH_{3} + 6Cl_{2} = N_{2} + NCl_{3} + 9NH_{4}Cl.\r\n\r\nBray and Dowell[9] showed that this reaction depended upon the hydrogen\r\nion concentration and proceeded in accordance with the following\r\nequations:\r\n\r\n   (i). Acid solution 4NH_{3} + 3Cl_{2} = NCl_{3} + 3NH_{4}Cl\r\n\r\n  (ii). Alkaline solution 8NH_{3} + 3Cl_{2} = N_{2} + 6NH_{4}Cl.\r\n\r\nIn (i) with a ratio of chlorine to ammonia of 3:1 by weight, one-half of\r\nthe chlorine is lost as ammonium chloride and one-half forms nitrogen\r\ntrichloride, concerning which comparatively little is known; in (ii) the\r\nwhole of the chlorine forms ammonium chloride, which has no germicidal\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe effect of ammonia on the germicidal action of a solution of chlorine\r\ngas is shown in the Table IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IV.[A]--EFFECT OF AMMONIA ON CHLORINE GAS SOLUTION\r\n\r\n_Conditions._ Colour of water 40 p.p.m. Turbidity, 5 p.p.m.\r\n\r\n  ---------+----------------------------------------\r\n           |Available Chlorine 0.20 p.p.m., Ammonia.\r\n   Contact |           Parts Per Million.\r\n   Period. +---------+---------+----------+---------\r\n           |   Nil.  |   0.05  |   0.10   |   0.20\r\n  ---------+---------+---------+----------+---------\r\n  Nil.     |   130   |   ...   |   ...    |   ...\r\n  10 mins. |   135   |   140   |   130    |   135\r\n   1 hour  |   130   |   130   |   128    |   120\r\n   4 hours |   120   |   112   |   110    |   105\r\n  24 hours |   120   |   145   |   160    |   170\r\n  ---------+---------+---------+----------+---------\r\n\r\n  [A] Results are _B. coli_ per 10 c.cms.\r\n\r\nEven when the ratio of Cl:NH_{3} was 4:1 by weight, practically the same\r\nas was used in the experiments of Noyes and Lyon, and Bray and Dowell,\r\nquoted above, the germicidal action was totally destroyed and the\r\n24-hour results showed aftergrowths which were somewhat proportional to\r\nthe amount of ammonia added. This was probably due to the formation of\r\nammonium chloride, which provided additional nutriment for the\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nIt has often been assumed that hypochlorite solutions are decomposed on\r\naddition to water containing free or half-bound carbonic acid with the\r\nproduction of free chlorine, but no evidence has been adduced in\r\nsupport. Free chlorine can be separated from hypochlorous acid in\r\naqueous solution by extraction with carbon tetrachloride and when this\r\nsolvent is shaken with a carbonated hypochlorite solution it is found\r\nthat only traces of chlorine are removed.\r\n\r\nHypochlorous acid reacts with hydrochloric acid with the evolution of\r\nfree chlorine HClO + HCl = Cl_{2} + H_{2}O but in very dilute solution\r\nthe amount of free chlorine formed is exceedingly minute. Jakowkin[10]\r\nhas shown that this reaction does not proceed to completion and that the\r\nconcentration of free chlorine can be calculated from the equation HClO\r\nx H^{.} x Cl' = 320Cl_{2} in which the reactions are expressed in gram\r\nmolecules per litre. The hydrogen ions and chlorine ions are obtained\r\nfrom the dissociation of carbonic acid (H_{2}CO_{3} <=> H^{.} +\r\nHCO_{3}') and chlorides (NaCl <=> Na^{.} + Cl') and also by the\r\ndissociation of hydrochloric acid produced by the interaction of\r\nhypochlorous acid and organic matter. HClO = O + HCl <=> H^{.} + Cl'. If\r\nthe formula of Jakowkin can be correctly applied to solutions containing\r\nfractions of a part per million of hypochlorous acid the free chlorine\r\nliberated by the addition of 1 p.p.m. of bleach to a water low in\r\nchlorides would be of the order 10^{-7}-10^{-8} p.p.m.\r\n\r\n_Sodium hypochlorite_ is probably hydrolysed in dilute solution in a\r\nmanner similar to that of bleach.\r\n\r\n  2NaOCl = NaCl + NaOH + HClO.\r\n\r\nFor solutions containing equal amounts of available chlorine,\r\nelectrolytic sodium hypochlorite is more dissociated than bleach because\r\nof the absence of an excess of base, and this, together with the\r\npresence of sodium chloride, accounts for the slightly higher germicidal\r\nvelocity obtained. The experience of pulp mills, with bleach and\r\nelectrolytic hypochlorites, confirms this: the latter is a much quicker\r\nbleaching agent than bleach and it is often so rapid as to make it\r\ndesirable to reduce the velocity by the addition of soda ash.\r\n\r\nRegarding hypochlorite solutions a phenomenon of more scientific\r\ninterest than of practical importance has been noted by Breteau[12] who\r\nfound that alkaline solutions of sodium hypochlorite containing 0.94 per\r\ncent of available chlorine lost 3.6 per cent of their titer on dilution\r\nwith 80 volumes of water; also that this loss was increased by the\r\naddition of small quantities of salt (sodium chloride) and more so by\r\ncarbonates and bicarbonates. The author has noted similar losses on\r\ndiluting bleach solutions and that the loss increased on standing. The\r\nloss can be explained by the decomposition of hypochlorous acid, in the\r\npresence of light, into hydrochloric acid and oxygen. 2HClO = 2HCl +\r\nO_{2}\r\n\r\nCHLORINE WATER. When a solution of chlorine in water is used as a\r\ngermicide the chemical reactions that occur differ materially from those\r\nof hypochlorite solutions. On solution in water, hydration or solvation\r\nprobably takes place with the production of heat. Cl_{2}.Aq. = 2,600\r\ncalories. Chlorine water is comparatively stable but decomposes under\r\nthe influence of light in accordance with the equation Cl_{2} + H_{2}O =\r\n2HCl + O; a similar reaction occurs in the presence of organic matter or\r\nany substance capable of oxidation. Chlorine water contains only minute\r\ntraces of hypochlorous acid and there is no evidence that the\r\nendothermic reaction\r\n\r\n  Cl_{2}.Aq + H_{2}O = HClO.Aq + HCl.Aq\r\n    -2600   - 68,460 = -29,930 - 39,315 - 1815\r\n\r\noccurs in a measurable degree.\r\n\r\nFrom thermochemical considerations hypochlorous acid and chlorine water\r\nshould be about equally active as oxidising agents.\r\n\r\n  2HClO.Aq = 2HCl + O_{2} + 18,770 calories\r\n\r\n  2Cl_{2}.Aq + 2H_{2}O = 2HCl + O_{2} + 15,340 calories\r\n\r\n  2Cl_{2}. + Aq + 2H_{2}O = 2HCl + O_{2} + 20,540 calories\r\n\r\nWhen a solution of chlorine or hypochlorite is added to water as a\r\ngermicidal agent, a variety of reactions occur the character of which is\r\ndetermined by the nature of the mineral and organic matter in the water\r\nand the type of chlorine compound added. The general reactions are of\r\nthree types (1) oxidation of the organic matter, (2) direct chlorination\r\nof the organic matter, and (3) a bactericidal action.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of waters that contain appreciable amounts of organic\r\nmatter almost all the chlorine is consumed in reaction (1) and even with\r\nfilter effluents it is probably true that oxidation accounts for the\r\ngreater portion of the chlorine consumed. The author has found that a\r\ndosage of 0.02 part per million of available chlorine was more effective\r\nin destroying _B. coli_ in distilled water than 0.40 p.p.m. in a water\r\nabsorbing 9.5 p.p.m. of oxygen (30 mins. at 100 deg. C.).\r\n\r\nReaction (1) can be adequately explained by the nascent oxygen\r\nhypothesis and it is this reaction that determines the dosage required\r\nfor effective sterilisation. (See Chap. III.)\r\n\r\nVery little information is available regarding reaction (2) but there is\r\nlittle doubt that a direct chlorination of the organic matter does occur\r\nand it is more than probable that these chlorinated derivatives are\r\nlargely responsible for the obnoxious tastes and odours produced in some\r\nwaters. It has been suggested that these were due to the formation of\r\nchloramines. This view was formerly supported by the author but the\r\nchloramine treatment at Ottawa and other places has demonstrated the\r\ninadequacy of this explanation. It is true that the odour of chloramine\r\nis stronger and more pungent than that of chlorine, but chloramine in\r\nthe Ottawa supply, even with doses as high as 0.5 part per million of\r\navailable chlorine, has caused no complaints.\r\n\r\nThe odour of some of the organo-chloro compounds is more penetrating and\r\nobnoxious than those of chlorine and chloramine, and it is quite\r\npossible that some of the higher homologues of chloramine are in this\r\nclass. It should be noted, however, that some of the chloro-amido\r\ncompounds prepared by Dakin are white, odourless, crystalline\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nPractically nothing is known regarding the specific nature of the\r\nmechanism involved in reaction (3). The hypothesis that chlorine, and\r\nchlorine compounds, exert a direct toxic action on the micro-organisms\r\nmarks an advance in the science of water treatment but does not indicate\r\nthe physiological processes involved. Cross and Bevan[11] have shown\r\nthat chloro-amines have a tendency to combine with nitrogenous molecules\r\nand to become fixed on cellulose; it is therefore possible that reaction\r\nis a cytolytic one in which the chlorine attacks and partially or wholly\r\ndestroys the membranous envelope of the organisms. A portion of the\r\nchlorine or chlorine-compound may also penetrate the membrane and\r\nproduce changes that result in the death of the organism.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n[1] Fischer and Proskauer, Rev. d'Hyg., 1884, 6, 515.\r\n\r\n[2] Warouzoff, Winogradoff, and Kolessnikoff.

Many experimenters have reported results that\r\nwould indicate that appreciable concentrations of chlorine are required\r\nfor bactericidal action but the details of the technique, as published,\r\nshow that the effect of the organic matter added with the test organism\r\nwas not thoroughly appreciated. One cubic centimetre of a culture in\r\nordinary peptone water, added to one litre of water, would increase the\r\norganic content by approximately 10 parts per million, an amount that\r\nwould absorb appreciable amounts of chlorine.\r\n\r\nOther conditions also make it very difficult to compare the results\r\nobtained in the past: one of these is the degree of purity set as the\r\nobjective. German bacteriologists added enormous numbers of the test\r\norganism and endeavoured to obtain the complete removal of the organism\r\nfrom such quantities as one litre of water with a contact period often\r\nas short as 10 minutes. Nissen,[1] of the Hygienic Institute of Berlin,\r\nfound that a 1: 800 dilution of bleach (420 p.p.m. of chlorine) was\r\nrequired to destroy _B. typhosus_ in one minute and a 1:1600 dilution\r\n(210 p.p.m. of chlorine) in 10 minutes. Delepine[2] obtained somewhat\r\nsimilar results by means of the thread method for testing disinfectants.\r\nPhelps,[3] using gelatine plates for enumeration of the bacteria,\r\nobtained a 90 per cent reduction of _B. typhosus_ in twenty minutes\r\nwith 5 p.p.m. of available chlorine; over 99 per cent reduction in one\r\nhour, and over 99.99 per cent reduction in 18 hours. Wesbrook,\r\nWhittaker, and Mohler[4] tested bleach solutions with various strains of\r\n_B. typhosus_ by means of the plate method and found that the most\r\nresistant one was reduced from 20,000 per c.cm. to sterility (in 1\r\nc.cm.) by 3 p.p.m. of available chlorine in fifty minutes and that the\r\nleast resistant one only required 1.0 p.p.m. with a thirty minutes'\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nLederer and Bachmann[5] have reported the following results:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE V\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGE REDUCTION, 15 MINUTES' CONTACT\r\n\r\n  ----------+-------------------------------------------------------\r\n            |               NATURE OF TEST ORGANISM.\r\n            +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Available |       |   B.  |       |       |       |   B.  |\r\n  Chlorine  |   B.  |faecalis|  B.   |Proteus|  B.   |lactis | B.\r\n  p.p.m.    |cloacae.|alkali-|paraty-| mira- |enter- | aero- |choler[oe]-\r\n            |       |genes. |phosus.|bilis. |itidis.| genes |suis.\r\n  ----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  0.1       |  .....|  99.98|  .....|  27.3 |  .....|  .....| .....\r\n  0.2       |  99.69|  99.99|  99.97|  45.5 |  99.83|  99.17|  95.8\r\n  0.3       |  99.75| 100.00| 100.00|  63.7 |  99.98|  99.98| 100.0\r\n  0.5       | 100.00|  .....|  .....|  72.7 | 100.00| 100.00| .....\r\n  0.7       |  .....|  .....|  .....|  63.7 |  .....|  .....| .....\r\n  1.0       |  .....|  .....|  .....|  63.7 |  .....|  .....| .....\r\n  3.0       |  .....|  .....|  .....|  90.9 |  .....|  .....| .....\r\n  5.0       |  .....|  .....|  .....|  90.0 |  .....|  .....| .....\r\n  Original }|       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  number of}|       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  organisms}|160,000|  9,500|  3,000| 8,000 |180,000|180,000|  500\r\n  per c.cm.}|       |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  ----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nWith the exception of _P. mirabilis_, which forms endospores, all the\r\norganisms were killed (less than 1 per c.cm.) by 0.5 p.p.m. of available\r\nchlorine in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nAll these observers found that _B. coli_, the organism usually employed\r\nas an index of contamination, had approximately the same degree of\r\nresistance to chlorine as _B. typhosus_, though Wesbrook et al. directed\r\nattention to the varying viability of organisms derived from different\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nThese experiments merely indicate the dosage required for exceptional\r\nconditions such as it is inconceivable would ever occur in water-works\r\npractice. No information is available regarding the actual _B. typhosus_\r\ncontent of waters that have caused epidemics of typhoid fever, but for\r\nthe present purpose it may be assumed that the extreme condition would\r\nbe a pollution by fresh sewage giving a _B. coli_ content of 1,000 per\r\nc.cm. or 200 times worse than the average condition that can be\r\nsatisfactorily purified without overloading a filter plant (500 _B.\r\ncoli_ per 100 c.cms.). Experiments made by the author indicate that a\r\nsuspension of 1,000 _B. coli_ per c.cm. in water, in the absence of\r\norganic matter, can be reduced to a 2 _B. coli_ per 100 c.cms. standard\r\n(the U.S. Treasury Standard) by 0.1 p.p.m. of available chlorine in ten\r\nminutes at 65 deg. F. This experiment indicates the amount of chlorine that\r\nis required for the bactericidal action only; such a dosage could never\r\nbe used in practice to meet a pollution of this degree because of the\r\naccompanying organic matter. In actual practice the author has\r\nexperienced the above condition but once, and on that occasion the _B.\r\ncoli_ were derived from soil washings and not from fresh sewage.\r\n\r\nThe amount of chlorine required for germicidal action is small, and the\r\nmain factors that determine the dosage necessary to obtain this action\r\nare (1) the content of readily oxidisable organic matter, (2) the\r\ntemperature of the water, (3) the method of application of the chlorine\r\nand (4) the contact period.\r\n\r\n=Oxidisable Matter.= The oxidisable matter may be divided into two\r\nclasses (_a_) inorganic and (_b_) organic. The inorganic constituents\r\nnaturally found in water, that are readily oxidisable, are ferrous salts\r\n(usually carbonates), nitrites, and sulphuretted hydrogen, and these\r\nreact quantitatively with chlorine until fully oxidised. The oxygen\r\nvalue of chlorine is approximately one-quarter (actually 16: 71) the\r\navailable chlorine content in accordance with the equation Cl_{2}/71 +\r\nH_{2}O = 2HCl + O/16. One part per million of available chlorine will\r\noxidise 1.58 p.p.m. of ferrous iron; 0.197 p.p.m. of nitrous nitrogen;\r\nand 0.479 p.p.m. of sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VI.[A]--EFFECT OF COLOUR\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE 63 deg.

The humus compounds of\r\nswamps and muskeg are usually associated with the characteristic colour\r\nof the water derived from these sources. The effect of this coloured\r\norganic matter upon the chlorine dosage is well illustrated in Table VI.\r\nIn this experiment _B. coli_ was used as the test organism and the only\r\nvarying factor was the organic matter. To obtain the same result with a\r\ncontact period of one hour at 63 deg. F. it was necessary to use about two\r\nand one-half times the amount of chlorine with a water containing 40\r\np.p.m. of colour as with one practically free from colour. It will be\r\nnoted that water \"A,\" in which the colour had been reduced to 3 p.p.m.\r\nby coagulation with aluminium sulphate, required a greater dosage of\r\nchlorine than was necessary for bactericidal action only. This was due\r\nto a residual organic content which produced none or but a trace of\r\ncolour, for although the colour had been reduced by 92 per cent the\r\norganic matter, as measured by the oxygen absorbed test, had only been\r\nreduced by 70 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by Harrington[6] at Montreal are in the same\r\ndirection. During the greater part of the year the water is obtained\r\nfrom the St. Lawrence river, which is colourless and low in organic\r\nmatter; in the spring months the flood waters of the Ottawa, a highly\r\ncoloured river, enter the intake and necessitated a much higher dosage.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORINE TREATMENT AT MONTREAL\r\n\r\n  -------------+--------+-------+--------+---------+----------+---------\r\n               |        |       | Oxygen | Chlorine|          |\r\n   Source of   | Alkali-|Colour.|Absorbed| Required| Bacteria | Per Cent\r\n    Supply.    |  nity. |       |  (30   |  p.p.m. | per c.cm.| Removed.\r\n               |        |       | mins.) |         |          |\r\n  -------------+--------+-------+--------+---------+----------+--------\r\n  Ottawa river | 15-20  | 50-70 |  14.0  |  1.50   |  3,000   | over 98\r\n  St. Lawrence |        |       |        |         |          |\r\n    river      | 90-100 |  Nil. |   0.30 |  0.30   |    500   | over 99\r\n  -------------+--------+-------+--------+---------+----------+---------\r\n\r\nEllms[7] obtained similar results and reported \"that the rate at which\r\nsterilisation proceeds varies, in a general way, directly with the\r\nconcentration of the applied available chlorine and the temperature, and\r\ninversely as the amount of easily oxidisable matter present.\"\r\n\r\nExperience with filter plants shows the same facts, the amount of\r\nchlorine required for the sterilisation of a filter effluent being\r\ninvariably less than that necessary to purify the raw water to the same\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe effect of coloured organic matter upon the absorption of chlorine,\r\nin the form of hypochlorite, is shown on Diagram I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM I\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF COLOUR ON ABSORPTION OF CHLORINE BY WATER\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------+----------------------------+\r\n  |                               | Value of K calculated from |\r\n  |                               |                            |\r\n  |    Absorption of Chlorine     |     Log(N_{1}/N_{2})       |\r\n  |      by water at 63 deg.

The mathematical expression of this law is\r\n_dN_/_dt_ = _KN_ where _N_ is the concentration of the available\r\nchlorine in parts per million. Integrating between _t__{1} and _t__{2}\r\nthe formula _K_ = log(_N__{1}/_N__{2})/(_t__{2} - _t__{1}) is obtained.\r\nIf the compound absorbing the chlorine were simple in character, and the\r\nchlorine were present in large excess, the value of _K_ would be\r\nconstant. In the experiments recorded, _K_ constantly decreases, due to\r\nthe decreasing concentrations of the reacting substances and the complex\r\nnature of the organic matter.\r\n\r\nThe results show the effect of organic matter on the reduction of the\r\nchlorine concentration available for germicidal action and also the\r\nimportance of avoiding a local excess of chlorine (_vide_ p. 41).\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made by some observers to find a quantitative\r\nrelation between the organic matter, expressed as oxygen absorbed in\r\nparts per million, and the chlorine required for oxidation, but without\r\ndefinite result. Some of the results obtained are given in Table VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VII.--OXYGEN TO CHLORINE RATIO\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+-------------------------\r\n                           |        Oxygen Absorbed\r\n        Observer.          | Ratio -----------------.\r\n                           |       Chlorine Absorbed\r\n  -------------------------+-------------------------\r\n  Rouquette                |           1\r\n  Bonjean                  |           0.5\r\n  Orticoni                 | Less than 1\r\n  Valeski and Elmanovitsch |           0.4\r\n  Race                     |           0.4\r\n  Theoretical              |           0.22\r\n  -------------------------+-------------------------\r\n\r\nThe value of 0.4 (0.39) obtained by the author is the average of over\r\none hundred determinations covering a period of two years. The\r\nexperiments of Zaleski and Elmanovitsch were made with the water of the\r\nNeva River.\r\n\r\nThe divergence in the ratios affords additional evidence in favor of\r\nreaction (2) mentioned on page 28 and also shows that the chlorinated\r\ncompounds are less readily oxidized than those from which they are\r\nproduced. Heise[8] has found that the amount of chlorine consumed is\r\nusually proportional to the concentration in which it is added though\r\nnot necessarily a function of the concentration of the organic matter.\r\n\r\n=Temperature.= The evidence regarding the effect of temperature upon the\r\ndosage required is somewhat conflicting. Ellms (_vide supra_) found that\r\nthe velocity of the germicidal action varied directly with the\r\ntemperature and this has also been the author's experience with\r\nlaboratory experiments.

From the value of _[theta]_, the velocity\r\nconstant of a germicide for any temperature may be calculated from the\r\nequation _K__{_T_} = _K__{20} deg. x _[theta]_^{(_T_ - _T__{20} deg.)}.\r\n_K__{1} and _K__{2} are obtained from the formula _K__{_T_} =\r\nlog(_N__{1}/_N__{2})/(_t__{2} - _t__{1}) in which _N__{1} - _N__{2} is\r\nthe number of bacteria destroyed in the interval _t__{2} - _t__{1}.\r\n\r\nA reduction of temperature also lowers the oxidizing activity of the\r\nchlorine so that a greater concentration is available for germicidal\r\naction.

The results with bleach and\r\nliquid chlorine are in the same direction (_vide_ Diagrams III and IV).\r\nThe bleach was regulated so as to maintain a constant purity, whilst in\r\nthe other case the dosage was constant with a varying _B. coli_ content.\r\nIn Diagram IV the _B. coli_ is plotted; this does not represent all the\r\nfactors involved as the _B. coli_ content of the treated water is also a\r\nfunction of that of the raw water, but in the example given this factor\r\nis of no moment because it was comparatively constant during the period\r\nplotted (extreme variation 80 per cent).\r\n\r\nThe discrepancies between the laboratory and works results cannot be\r\neasily explained. The only difference in the conditions is the nature of\r\nthe containing vessel. Glass is practically inert at all temperatures\r\nbut the iron pipes, through which the water passed before the samples\r\nwere taken, may exert an absorptive influence on the chlorine at the\r\nhigher temperatures experienced during the summer months.\r\n\r\nWaters containing organic matter that differs much in quantity from the\r\nexamples above may yield very different results and no generalisation\r\ncan be made that will cover all cases. An increase of temperature\r\nincreases the germicidal velocity and also the rate of absorption of\r\nchlorine by the organic matter; other factors determine which of these\r\ncompetitive actions predominates.\r\n\r\n=Method of Application (admixture).= A thorough admixture of the water\r\nand chlorine is a _sine qua non_ for successful operation. This should,\r\nif possible, be attained by natural means, but if there is any doubt as\r\nto the efficiency of the mixing process, mechanical appliances should be\r\nutilised. Pumps, especially centrifugal pumps, constitute a very\r\nconvenient and efficacious method of mixing the germicide and the\r\nwater, and the solutions should never be injected into the discharge\r\npipes when it is possible to make connections with the suctions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM III\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF TEMPERATURE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM IV\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF TEMPERATURE]\r\n\r\nInefficient admixture leads to local concentration of the chlorine, a\r\ncondition which (_vide_ p. 35), results in a wastage of the\r\ndisinfectant. Two practical examples of this effect may be cited. In one\r\ncase the water was free from colour and contained very little organic\r\nmatter. This water was chlorinated at one plant by allowing the bleach\r\nsolution to drop into one vertical limb of a syphon approximately 6,000\r\nfeet long, the other vertical limb being used as a suction well for the\r\npumps which discharged into the distribution mains. At the other plant\r\nthe bleach solution was injected into the discharge pipe of a\r\nreciprocating pump through a pipe perforated with a number of small\r\nholes. The results for two typical months are given in Table X.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE X.--EFFECT OF EFFICIENT MIXING\r\n\r\n  ------+-----------+-----------------------+---------------\r\n        | Available | BACTERIA PER C.CM.    |\r\n        |  Chlorine +-----------------------+\r\n        | Parts Per |       |               | B.

The hypochlorite and\r\nwater did not mix thoroughly and, as several suctions pipes were\r\nsituated in the suction shaft, there was no subsequent admixture in the\r\npumps; this also caused complaints regarding taste and odour but the\r\ncomplaints were localised, and not general as would result from an\r\noverdose of solution due to irregularities at the plant.\r\n\r\nThe second example deals with a water containing 40-45 p.p.m. of colour.\r\nThis supply was taken from the river by low-lift pumps and discharged\r\ninto a header which was connected with the high-lift pumps by two intake\r\npipes about 5,000 feet in length. During 1914 a baffled storage basin of\r\ntwo hours capacity was constructed and in June the hypochlorite was\r\nadded at the inlet to this basin by means of a perforated pipe. The\r\nobject was to increase the contact period prior to the delivery of the\r\nwater into the header.

Langer[10] has also noted the\r\neffect of local concentration and found that the disinfecting action is\r\nincreased by adding the bleach solution in fractions, a cumulative\r\neffect replacing that of concentration.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the admixture factor was not thoroughly appreciated\r\nduring the earlier periods of chlorination but later installations, and\r\nparticularly the liquid chlorine ones, have been designed to take full\r\nadvantage of it.\r\n\r\nThe point of application in American water-works practice varies\r\nconsiderably (Longley[11]). In 57 per cent of those cases in which it is\r\nemployed as an adjunct to filtration, it is used in the final treatment;\r\nin 26 per cent it is used after coagulation or sedimentation and before\r\nfiltration; in the remaining 17 per cent it is applied before\r\ncoagulation and filtration. The report of the committee adds: \"The data\r\nat hand do not give any reasons for the application before coagulation.\r\nIn general, an effective disinfection may be secured with a smaller\r\nquantity of hypochlorite, if it is applied after rather than before\r\nfiltration. It should be noted that the storage of chlorinated water in\r\ncoagulating basins, and its passage through filters, tend to lessen\r\ntastes and odors contributed by the treatment and this fact may in some\r\ncases account for its use in this way.\"\r\n\r\n=Contact Period.= Other things being equal, the efficiency of the\r\ntreatment will vary directly, within certain limits, with the contact\r\nperiod. When a chlorinated water has to be pumped to the distribution\r\nmains directly after treatment, the dosage must be high enough to secure\r\nthe desired standard of purity within twenty to thirty minutes. The\r\nchlorine is sometimes not completely absorbed in this period and may\r\ncause complaints as to tastes and odours. The examples given above show\r\nthat the lack of contact period can be largely compensated by ensuring\r\nproper admixture. Experience has amply demonstrated that there is no\r\nnecessity to use heroic doses for water that is delivered for\r\nconsumption almost immediately after treatment, and that, with proper\r\nsupervision, complaints can be almost entirely prevented.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of the effect of contact period is shown in Tables\r\nVIII and IX on page 37. Another example of a coloured water is given in\r\nTable XI, whilst Table XII shows the results obtained with a colourless\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XI.[A]--EFFECT OF CONTACT PERIOD\r\n\r\n  -----------------+-------------------------------\r\n                   |  CHLORINE, PARTS PER MILLION.\r\n   Contact Period. +-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                   |  0.30 |  0.40 |  0.55 |  1.21\r\n  -----------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Nil              | 3,800 |   ... |  ...  |  ...\r\n   1 minute        | 1,400 |   120 |    0  |    0\r\n  10 minutes       |   720 |     5 |    0  |    0\r\n  20 minutes       |    35 |     0 |    0  |    0\r\n  -----------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n  [A] Results are _B. coli_ per 10 c.cms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XII.--EFFECT OF CONTACT PERIOD AVAILABLE CHLORINE 0.27 PART PER\r\nMILLION\r\n\r\n  -----------------+--------------------------------+-------------------\r\n                   |        Sampling Point.         | Bacteria Per c.cm.\r\n  -----------------+--------------------------------+-------------------\r\n  Average of series|  5,000 ft. from pumping station|       300\r\n    of samples     |  6,000  \"   \"     \"       \"    |       203\r\n                   |  7,000  \"   \"     \"       \"    |       103\r\n                   | 12,000  \"   \"     \"       \"    |        86\r\n                   | 14,000  \"   \"     \"       \"    |        87\r\n  -----------------+--------------------------------+-------------------\r\n\r\nTable XIII is taken from the work of Wesbrook et al.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XIII.[B]--TREATMENT OF MISSISSIPPI RIVER WATER AUG. 8, 1910\r\n\r\n  -------------+-------------------------------------------------\r\n               |      CONTACT PERIOD.

This\r\nincrease in the bacteria is technically known as \"aftergrowth\" and will\r\nbe discussed more fully in Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nThe replies to queries sent out by the Committee on Water Supplies of\r\nthe American Public Health Association[11] indicate that the contact\r\nperiod after treatment varies considerably in American water-works\r\npractice. Forty per cent of the replies indicated no storage after\r\ntreatment; 18 per cent less than one hour; 9 per cent from one to three\r\nhours; 5 per cent three to twelve hours; 11 per cent twelve to\r\ntwenty-four hours, and 17 per cent a storage of more than twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n=Turbidity= is usually considered to exert an effect upon the dosage\r\nrequired but no definite evidence has been adduced in support of this\r\nhypothesis. Turbidity is generally caused by the presence of very finely\r\ndivided suspended matter, usually silt or clay, which is inert to\r\nhypochlorites. The condition that produces turbidity, however, produces\r\na concomitant increase in the pollution and some of the organisms are\r\nembedded in mineral or organic material that prevents access of the\r\nchlorine to the organisms which consequently survive treatment. A larger\r\nconcentration is required to meet these conditions but it is not\r\nnecessitated by the turbidity _per se_.\r\n\r\n=Effect of Light.= Light exerts a marked photo-chemical effect on the\r\ngermicidal velocity of chlorine and hypochlorites. When chlorinated\r\nwater is passed through closed conduits and basins the effect of light\r\nis of course nil but in open conduits and reservoirs this factor is\r\nappreciable and reduces the necessary contact period. The effect of\r\nlight on laboratory experiments made with colourless glass bottles is\r\nso marked as to make it impossible to compare the results obtained on\r\ndifferent days under different actinic conditions. The following figures\r\nillustrate the effect of sunlight:\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF SUNLIGHT\r\n\r\n  -----------------+-------------------------------------\r\n                   |  AVAILABLE CHLORINE 0.35 P.P.M.\r\n   Contact Period. +-------------------+-----------------\r\n                   | Exposed to Bright | Stored in Dark\r\n                   | Sunlight (April)  |    Cupboard.\r\n  -----------------+-------------------+-----------------\r\n   Nil             |        215        |      215\r\n   30    minutes   |        130        |      145\r\n   1     hour      |        122        |      136\r\n   2-1/2 hours     |         61        |      130\r\n   3-1/2 hours     |          0        |       32\r\n  -----------------+-------------------+-----------------\r\n\r\n=Determination of Dosage Required.= The dosage required for the\r\ntreatment of a water can only be accurately determined by treating\r\nsamples with various amounts of chlorine and estimating the number of\r\nbacteria and _B. coli_ after an interval of time equal to that available\r\nin practice. The temperature of the water during the experiment should\r\nbe the same as that of the water at the time of sampling.\r\n\r\nIn order to limit the range covered by the experiments the approximate\r\ndosage can be ascertained from Diagram V if the amount of oxygen\r\nabsorbed by the water is known. This diagram is calculated on the amount\r\nof available chlorine, present as chlorine or hypochlorite, that will\r\nreduce the _B. coli_ content to the U. S. Treasury standard (2 _B. coli_\r\nper 100 c.cms.) in two hours. If the oxygen absorbed values are\r\ndetermined by the four-hour test at 27 deg. C. they should be multiplied by\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nAnother method which has been generally adopted for military work during\r\nthe war, consists in the addition of definite volumes of a standard\r\nchlorine solution to several samples of the water and, after a definite\r\ninterval, testing for the presence of free chlorine by the\r\nstarch-iodide reaction. The details of the method of Gascard and\r\nLaroche, which is used by the French sanitary service, have been given\r\nby Comte.[12] One hundred c.cms. of the water to be examined are placed\r\nin each of 5 vessels and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 drops of dilute Eau de\r\nJavelle (1:100) are added and the contents stirred. After twenty\r\nminutes, 1 c.cm. of potassium iodide-starch reagent (1 gram each of\r\nstarch, potassium, iodide and crystallized sodium carbonate to 100\r\nc.cms.) is added and the samples again stirred. The lowest dilution\r\nshowing a definite blue colour is regarded as the dose required, and the\r\nnumber of drops is identical with that required of the undiluted Eau de\r\nJavelle for 10 litres of water when the same dropping instrument is\r\nused. The actual concentration represented by these dilutions depends\r\nnecessarily upon the size of the drops and the strength of the undiluted\r\nEau de Javelle, but one drop per 100 c.cms. usually represents\r\napproximately 1 p.p.m.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM V\r\n\r\nRELATION OF DOSAGE TO OXYGEN ABSORBED]\r\n\r\nIn Horrocks's method, as used in the British army, a standard bleach\r\nsolution is added and is almost immediately followed by the zinc\r\niodide-starch reagent. The two methods were compared by Massy,[13] who\r\nfound that the French method gave an average result of only 0.06 m.gr.\r\nper litre (0.06 p.p.m.) higher than the English method. Water in the\r\nGallipoli campaign required from 0.21 to 1.06 p.p.m. as determined by\r\nboth methods.\r\n\r\nDienert, Director of the Paris Service for investigating drinking water,\r\nadds 3 p.p.m. of available chlorine and allows the mixture to stand\r\nfifteen minutes after shaking; the residual chlorine is then titrated\r\nwith thiosulphate. The amount absorbed is increased by 0.5 p.p.m. and in\r\nthe opinion of Dienert this dosage is correct for a contact period of\r\nthree hours.\r\n\r\nFor military camps where a standpipe usually provides a reasonable\r\ncontact period, it has been found good practice to add sufficient\r\nchlorine to give a rich blue colour with the starch-iodide reagent and\r\nsubsequently reduce the dosage gradually until the water, after standing\r\none hour, gives but a faint reaction to the test reagent. This method\r\nshould be checked up as soon as possible by bacteriological\r\nexaminations. An example of this method is given in Table XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XIV.--CONTROL OF DOSAGE BY STARCH-IODIDE REACTION\r\n\r\n  --------------------+-----------------------------------+--------------\r\n     Starch-iodide    |    BACTERIA ON AGAR PER C.CM.     |\r\n   Reaction After One +-----------------+-----------------+ B.

This distinction is\r\nentirely arbitrary as the ability of a substance to kill organisms or\r\nmerely inhibit their growth depends upon the concentration employed.\r\n\r\nChlorine and hypochlorites, even in minute doses, exert a toxic effect\r\nthat is sufficient to produce death in organisms but when still smaller\r\nconcentrations are employed the toxic effect is transient and the\r\nreproductive faculty may be entirely regained.\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of bacteria by means of solid media depends upon the\r\nability of the organism to reproduce at such a rate as to produce a\r\nvisible colony within the period of incubation and any substance that\r\nprevents the growth of a visible colony is classified as a disinfectant;\r\nif on further incubation the bacterial count approximates that of the\r\nuntreated sample the added substance has acted mainly as an antiseptic.\r\nIn practice no substance acts entirely as an antiseptic as the organisms\r\npresent have varying degrees of resistance and the less viable ones are\r\nkilled by doses that are only antiseptic to the more resistant ones.\r\nAn example of an antiseptic effect followed by a mild disinfectant\r\naction, caused by small doses of bleach is shown in Table XV. In this\r\nexperiment the water designated as control was from the same source as\r\nthe treated water. In order to make the bacterial count in this water\r\napproximately the same as in the treated water, the original count was\r\nreduced by diluting the sample with water from the same source,\r\nsterilised by boiling, and afterwards reaerated with sterile air.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XV.[A]--ANTISEPTIC EFFECT OF CHLORINE\r\n\r\nSample treated with 0.1 part per million of available chlorine.\r\n\r\n  -------------+---------------------------------------+------------------\r\n               |                                       |    RATIO OF\r\n     PLATED.   |        INCUBATION PERIOD, DAYS.       |    BACTERIAL\r\n               |                                       |     COUNTS.\r\n  --------+----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+------\r\n    Time. |Day.|    2  |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   | 2:4 | 2:5 | 2:6\r\n          |    |       |       |       |       |       |Days.|Days.|Days.\r\n  --------+----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+------\r\n   11 a.m.|  1 |    520|    940|  1,350|  2,360|  2,780|1:2.6|1:4.5|1:5.3\r\n   12 noon|  1 |    390|    770|  1,080|  2,040|  2,320|  2.8|  5.2|  5.8\r\n    2 p.m.|  1 |    187|    260|    690|  1,840|  2,080|  3.7|  9.9| 16.4\r\n    4 p.m.|  1 |     91|    130|    280|    760|    840|  3.1|  8.3|  9.2\r\n   10 a.m.|  2 |     42|    120|    670|    920|    ...| 15.9| 22. |  ...\r\n   10 a.m.|  3 |    320|  1,210|  3,500|    ...|    ...| 10.9|  ...|  ...\r\n   10 a.m.|  4 |  8,700| 14,200| 26,000|    ...|    ...|  2.9|  ...|  ...\r\n  --------+----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+------\r\n                         CONTROL.

The common intestinal organisms are\r\nalso very susceptible to destruction by chlorine and there is\r\nconsiderable evidence that _B. Coli_ is slightly more susceptible than\r\nmany of the vegetative forms usually found in water. The specific\r\norganisms causing the water-borne diseases, typhoid fever and cholera,\r\nare, on the average, not more resistant than _B. coli_.\r\n\r\nThe spore-forming bacteria usually found in water are those of the\r\nsubtilis group, derived largely from soil washings, and _B. enteritidis\r\nsporogenes_, from sewage and manure. The spores of these organisms are\r\nvery resistant and survive all ordinary concentrations. Wesbrook et\r\nal.[1] found that 3 p.p.m. of available chlorine had little effect on a\r\nspore-forming bacillus isolated from the Mississippi water and the\r\nauthor has obtained similar results with _B. subtilis_.\r\n\r\nThomas,[2] during the chlorination of the Bethlehem, Pa., supply, found\r\nfour organisms that survived a concentration of 2 p.p.m. of available\r\nchlorine: _Bact. aerophilum_, _B. cuticularis_, and _B. subtilis_, all\r\nspore formers and _M. agilis_.\r\n\r\nIn practice no attempt is made, except in special cases, to destroy the\r\nspore-bearing organisms as they have no sanitary significance and the\r\nconcentration of chlorine required for their destruction would cause\r\ncomplaints as to tastes and odours if the excess of chlorine were not\r\nremoved. Such doses are unnecessary and result in waste of material. It\r\nis found that, when the dose is sufficient to eliminate the _B. coli_\r\ngroup from 25-50 c.cms. of water, the majority of the residual bacteria\r\nare of the spore-bearing type. Smeeton[3] has investigated the bacteria\r\nsurviving in the Croton supply of New York City after treatment with 0.5\r\np.p.m. of available chlorine as bleach. Table XVII gives the results\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe organisms of the _B. subtilis_ group outnumbered all the others, 66\r\n(62.8 per cent) belonging to this group alone. This group contained _B.\r\nsubtilis_--Cohn (36 strains), _B. tumescens_--Chester (15 strains) _B.\r\nruminatus_--Chester (13 strains), and _B. simplex_--Chester 1904, (2\r\nstrains). Three of the four coccus forms were classified as _M. luteus_.\r\nNo intestinal forms were found.\r\n\r\nClark and De Gage[4] in 1910 directed attention to the fact that the\r\nbacterial counts, made at 37 deg. C. on chlorinated samples, were often much\r\ngreater than the counts obtained at room temperature. \"This phenomenon\r\nof reversed ratios between counts at the two temperatures,\" they stated,\r\n\"has been occasionally observed with natural water, but a study of the\r\nrecord of many thousands of samples shows that the percentage of such\r\nsamples is very small, not over 3-5 per cent.... On the other hand 20-25\r\nper cent. of samples treated with calcium hypochlorite show higher\r\ncounts at body temperature than at room temperature.\" Clark and De Gage\r\nwere unable to state the true significance of this phenomenon but were\r\nof the opinion that it was not due to larger percentages of\r\nspore-forming bacteria in the treated samples. Other observers, on the\r\ncontrary, have invariably found the spore-formers to be more resistant\r\nto chlorine and thermophylic in type.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XVII.--ORGANISMS SURVIVING TREATMENT NEW YORK\r\n\r\n(SMEETON)\r\n\r\n  ---------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n                 |  Morphology   | Spore       |   Gelatine  | Reaction in\r\n                 |               | Formation   |Liquefaction | Litmus Milk\r\n                 +--------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                 |Bacilli.|Cocci.| Pos. | Neg. | Pos. | Neg. | Pos. | Neg.\r\n  ---------------+--------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n  No. of strains | 100    |  5   | 89   | 16   | 68   | 37   | 98   |  7\r\n  Per cent.      |  95.2  |  4.7 | 84.7 | 15.2 | 64.7 | 35.2 | 93.3 |  6.6\r\n  ===============+========+======+======+======+======+======+======+======\r\n                 |     Indol     |    Acid     |  Reduction  | Inhibition\r\n                 |   Production  | Production  |     of      | by Gentian\r\n                 |               | in Glucose  |  Nitrates   |   Violet\r\n                 +--------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                 |  Pos.  | Neg. | Pos. | Neg. | Pos. | Neg. | Pos. | Neg.\r\n  ---------------+--------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n  No. of strains |  75    | 30   | 61   | 44   | 40   | 65   | 98   |  7\r\n  Per cent.      |  71.4  | 28.5 | 58   | 41.9 | 38   | 61.9 | 93.3 |  6.6\r\n  ---------------+--------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nThe removal of intestinal forms is, of course, merely a relative one and\r\nwhen large quantities of treated water are tested their presence can be\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nThe author, in 1915, made a number of experiments to ascertain whether\r\nthe _B. coli_ found after chlorination were more resistant to chlorine\r\nthan the original culture. The strains surviving treatment with\r\ncomparatively large doses were fished into lactose broth and subjected\r\nto a second treatment, the process being repeated several times. The\r\nvelocity of the germicidal reaction with the strains varied somewhat,\r\nbut not always in the same direction, and the variations were not\r\ngreater than were found in control experiments on the original culture.\r\nNo evidence was obtained that the surviving strains were in any way more\r\nresistant to chlorine than the original strain; in considering the\r\nresults it should be borne in mind that the surviving strains were\r\ncultivated twice on media free from chlorine before again being\r\nsubjected to chlorination.\r\n\r\nA number of the strains that survived several treatments were cultivated\r\nin lactose broth and the acidity determined quantitatively. All the\r\ncultures produced less acid than the original culture, and the average\r\nwas materially less than the original. These results point to a\r\ndiminution of the bio-chemical activity by action of the chlorine.\r\n\r\nA point of perhaps more scientific interest than practical utility is\r\nthe relative proportion of the various types of _B. coli_ found before\r\nand after treatment with chlorine. The author, in 1914, commenced the\r\ndifferentiation of the types by means of dulcite and saccharose and\r\nobtained the results shown in Table XVIII. These figures are calculated\r\nfrom several hundreds of strains.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a slight difference in the relative proportions of the\r\ntypes found at Ottawa and Baltimore, both sets of results show\r\ndefinitely that there is no difference in the resistance of the various\r\ntypes to chlorination.\r\n\r\n=Aftergrowths.= In Tables XIII (p. 44) and XV (p. 51), it will be\r\nnoticed that, after the preliminary germicidal action has subsided, a\r\nsecond phase occurs in which there is a rapid growth of organisms. This\r\nis usually known as aftergrowth. When the contact period between\r\nchlorination and consumption is short, the reaction does not proceed\r\nbeyond the first phase, but when the treated water is stored in service\r\nreservoirs the second phase may ensue. At one purification plant, where\r\nthe service reservoirs are of large capacity, the aftergrowths amounted\r\nto 20,000 bacteria per c.cm. although the water left the purification\r\nplant with a bacterial count usually lower than 50 per c.cm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XVIII.--TYPES OF _B.

When the dosage is\r\nsmall, a small number of active organisms, in addition to the spore\r\nbearers, will escape destruction, and others will suffer a reduction of\r\nreproductive capacity. The flora of the aftergrowth in this case will\r\nonly differ from the original flora by the elimination of a majority of\r\nthe organisms that are most susceptible to the action of chlorine and\r\nthe weaker members of other species of greater average resistance. As\r\nthe dose is increased these factors become relatively less important\r\nuntil a stage is reached when only the most resistant cells, the spores,\r\nremain. The resultant aftergrowth must necessarily be almost entirely\r\ncomposed of spore-bearing organisms. A small number of the most\r\nresistant members of non-sporulating organisms may also be present but\r\nthey will, in the majority of instances, form a very small minority.\r\nThis is the condition that usually obtains in practice and it is\r\nnecessary to consider whether the aftergrowth may have any sanitary\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nConcerning the secondary development of _B. coli_, the usual index of\r\npollution, there is but little information. H. E. Jordon[6] reported\r\nthat, of 201 samples, 21 gave a positive _B. coli_ reaction immediately\r\nafter treatment, 39 after standing for twenty-four hours, and 42 after\r\nforty-eight hours. These increases were confined to the warm months, the\r\ncold months actually showing a decrease. The following figures, taken\r\nfrom the author's routine tests for 1913 and 1914, show a similar\r\ntendency, but an analysis of the results by months did not show that\r\nthis was confined to the warm season. The sequence of the results from\r\nleft to right, in the following Table, is in the same order as the\r\ncontact period. Approximately 290 samples were taken at each sampling\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nAt station No. 2 the germicidal action was still proceeding but at No.\r\n5, representing an outlying section of the city, the increase in the _B.\r\ncoli_ content is very apparent.\r\n\r\nDuring 1915 and 1916 the author endeavoured to duplicate these results\r\nunder laboratory conditions and entirely failed. These experiments,\r\nwhich were made with the same materials as were in use at the city\r\nchlorination plant, but in glass containers, were usually only carried\r\nto a forty-eight hours contact, as this was the extreme limit for the\r\ncity mains; one, however, was prolonged to five days. Many experiments\r\nwere made under varying conditions, with similar results. Typical\r\nexamples are given in Tables VI, VIII and IX on pages 33 and 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XIX.--AFTERGROWTHS OF B. COLI\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGE OF SAMPLES SHOWING B. COLI IN 10 C.CMS.\r\n\r\n  -----+----------------------------------\r\n       |        SAMPLING POINT NO.\r\n       +------+------+------+------+------\r\n       |   1  |   2  |   3  |  4   |  5\r\n       +------+------+------+------+------\r\n  1913 | 15.2 | 14.4 | 16.3 | 16.8 | 26.8\r\n  1914 |  7.0 |  5.7 |  6.0 | .... | 11.6\r\n  -----+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nIn every case there was persistent diminution in the number of _B. coli_\r\nwith increase of contact period. Determination of the bacterial count on\r\nnutrient agar showed that, in several experiments, the aftergrowth had\r\ncommenced, and in some instances there was evidence that the second\r\ncycle was partially complete i.e. the number had reached a maximum and\r\nthen commenced to decline. The time required for the completion of the\r\ntwo cycles, comprising the first reduction caused by the chlorine, the\r\nincrease or aftergrowth, and the final reduction due to lack of suitable\r\nfood material, is dependent upon several factors of which the dosage and\r\ntemperature are the most important. With a small dosage the germicidal\r\nperiod is short and the second phase is quickly reached; with large\r\ndoses, the second phase is not reached in forty-eight hours; the higher\r\nthe temperature the quicker is the action and the development of the\r\naftergrowth. These statements refer only to the bacteria capable of\r\ndevelopment on nutrient agar. The _B. coli_ group behaved differently\r\nand persistently diminished in every case. If _B. typhosus_ acts in a\r\nsimilar manner to _B. coli_, the laboratory experiments show that\r\naftergrowths are of no sanitary significance and can safely be ignored,\r\nbut as the results obtained in practice are contradictory to the\r\nlaboratory ones, the matter must be regarded as _sub judice_ until more\r\ndefinite evidence is available.\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that samples of water from \"dead ends\" of\r\ndistribution mains show high counts and much larger quantities of _B.\r\ncoli_ than the water delivered to the mains. This is another phase of\r\naftergrowth problem that often causes complaints and can only be\r\neliminated by \"blowing off\" the mains frequently or by providing\r\ncirculation by connecting up the \"dead ends.\" One extreme case of this\r\ndescription might be cited. A small service was taken off the main at\r\nthe extreme edge of the city to supply a Musketry School two miles away\r\nand was only in use for a few months in the summer season. This service\r\npipe delivered water containing _B. coli_ in a considerable percentage\r\nof the 10 c.cm. samples and in a few instances in 1 c.cm., although the\r\nwater delivered to the city mains never exceeded 2 _B. coli_ per 100\r\nc.cms. and averaged about one-tenth that quantity. No epidemiological\r\nrecords of the effect of this water are available because it was put\r\nthrough a Forbes steriliser before consumption.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the rate of development of the organisms after\r\nchlorination is greater than in the same water stored under similar\r\nconditions. This is especially noticeable in the presence of organic\r\nmatter and has been ascribed to the action of the chlorine on the\r\norganic matter with the production of other compounds that are available\r\nas food material for the organisms.\r\n\r\nHouston, during the treatment of prefiltered water Lincoln in 1905,\r\nfound that although the removal of _B. coli_ and other organisms growing\r\nat 37 deg. C. was satisfactory, there was almost invariably an increase in\r\nthe bacteria growing on gelatine at 20 deg. C. This was ascribed to the\r\naction mentioned above and the chemical results supported this view,\r\nmore organic matter being found in the filter effluents than in the\r\nprefiltered water. Rideal's experiments with sewage at Guildford\r\nindicate that a similar action may occur in contact beds. The addition\r\nof bleach to the prefiltered water at Yonkers also resulted in an\r\nincreased count and in these instances the aftergrowths are due to a\r\ndisturbance of the equilibrium by the action of the chlorine on the\r\nzooglea and other organic matter invariably found in ripe filters.\r\nSimilar results can be produced by the addition of chlorinated water to\r\nsmall experimental sand filters. This is shown by the results in Tables\r\nXX and XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XX.--AFTERGROWTHS IN SAND\r\n\r\n  --------------+---------------+---------------+----------------\r\n                |  Bacteria Per |               |\r\n    Available   |    Gram of    |Typical B. coli| FREE CHLORINE\r\n   Chlorine in  |   Sand After  |After 24 Hours.| AFTER 24 HRS.\r\n   Water p.p.m. +-------+-------+---+---+---+---+-------+--------\r\n                |       |       |100| 10| 1 |0.1|Without| After\r\n                | 3 Hrs.|24 Hrs.|Gr.|Gr.|Gr.|Gr.| Acidification.\r\n  --------------+-------+-------+---+---+---+---+-------+--------\r\n   Nil          | 12,000| 21,000| + | + | + | - |   -   |   -\r\n    3.0         |     80|114,000| - | - | - | - |   -   |   -\r\n    5.0         |     50|150,000| - | - | - | - |   -   |   -\r\n    7.0         |     25|214,000| - | - | - | - |   -   |   -\r\n   10.0         |     26|500,000| - | - | - | - |   -   |   -\r\n  --------------+-------+-------+---+---+---+---+-------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XXI.--AFTERGROWTHS IN SAND\r\n\r\n  --------------+---------------------------------\r\n                | BACTERIA PER GRAM OF SAND AFTER\r\n   Available in +----------+----------+-----------\r\n   Water p.p.m. | 3 Hours. |24 Hours. |48 Hours.\r\n  --------------+----------+----------+-----------\r\n   Nil          |  70,000  |   .....  |   .....\r\n   0.1          |   7,200  |  20,400  |  12,800\r\n   0.3          |   5,240  |   6,400  |  11,200\r\n   0.5          |   5,120  |   4,700  |  10,800\r\n   1.0          |   1,100  |   8,800  |  20,400\r\n  --------------+----------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\nIt is observable that the effect of small doses was comparatively small\r\nand transient; large doses of bleach reduced the bacteria very\r\nmaterially but the reduction was not maintained and the subsequent\r\nincrease was abnormally rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n[1] Wesbrook, Whittaker and Mohler.

Similar observations have been made in laboratory experiments\r\nwhen independent observers have been requested to detect the chlorinated\r\nwaters from an equal number of treated and untreated waters. Such\r\nobservers are wrong in the majority of the waters which they designate\r\nas treated ones if the dosage is not in excess of that required for\r\nsatisfactory purification.\r\n\r\nOne amusing example of auto-suggestion was experienced by the author\r\nsome years ago. During a ceremonial visit to the waterworks, the Mayor\r\nand several civic representatives happened to visit a hypochlorite plant\r\nthat was built on a pier over the river and which had no ostensible\r\nconnection with the city mains. One of the party expressed a desire for\r\na drink of good river water without any hypochlorite in it and was\r\nserved with water from the plant supply by an assistant engineer of the\r\nwaterworks department. The water was consumed by all with great relish\r\nand as it was being finished, the writer entered the plant and was\r\ninvited to join them in the enjoyment of this \"dopeless\" water; on\r\nasking where it had been obtained he was astonished to hear that it was\r\nfrom a tap which was supplied with the ordinary chlorinated water of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nOn many occasions, complaints are justifiable and should be carefully\r\ninvestigated instead of, as is often the case, being attributed to\r\nauto-suggestion. The time and energy that are often devoted to\r\nendeavouring to persuade water consumers that their complaints are\r\nwithout foundation, can better be utilised in so improving the\r\nchlorination process as to eliminate tastes and odours. All complaints\r\nshould be carefully investigated and a record kept for future reference,\r\nfor the cause, although not manifest at the time, may be discovered\r\nlater. The records then provide valuable corroborative evidence.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the complaints against chlorinated water is very\r\ndiversified and includes imparting foreign tastes and odours, causing\r\ncolic, killing fish and birds, the extraction of abnormal amounts of\r\ntannin from tea, the destruction of plants and flowers, the corrosion of\r\nwater pipes, and that horses and other animals refuse to drink it.\r\n\r\n_Tastes and Odours._ When an excess of hypochlorite or liquid chlorine\r\nis added to a water it imparts a sharp pungent odour and acid taste,\r\ncharacteristic of chlorine, that render it offensive to the nose and\r\npalate. In some instances the presence of chlorine compounds is not\r\nobtrusive when the temperature of the water is low but becomes so when\r\nthe temperature is raised. It is especially observable when the faucets\r\nof hot water services are first opened and the chlorine is carried off\r\nas a vapour by the other gases liberated by the reduction in pressure.\r\nFor this reason the complaints regarding hot water are relatively more\r\nnumerous and sometimes constitute the whole of the complaints. In cold\r\nwater containing appreciable quantities of mineral salts the\r\nhypochlorites and hypochlorous acid might not be entirely dissociated;\r\nthey may become more hydrolysed with an increase in temperature and\r\nfinally broken down under the influence of the carbonic acid liberated\r\nfrom the bicarbonates by heat.\r\n\r\nChlorine also forms chlorinated organic compounds by action on the\r\norganic matter present in water and some of the objectionable tastes and\r\nodours of chlorinated waters have been attributed to this agency. Some\r\nobservers have stated that chloramines were amongst the chloro-organo\r\ncompounds produced but the author's experience with the Ottawa supply\r\nhas demonstrated that simple chloramine (NH_{2}Cl) can be successfully\r\nemployed for water treatment without causing complaints. It was\r\nsuggested on page 28 that some of the higher chloro-amines might be the\r\ncause of some complaints but at present there is no definite information\r\nregarding the formation of these compounds in water and all such\r\nhypotheses are little more than conjectures. Letton[1] has reported that\r\nat Trenton, in 1911, when the water of the Delaware River was first\r\ntreated, the dosage was as high as 1.2 p.p.m. of available chlorine and\r\nalthough chemical tests showed the absence of free chlorine, the water\r\nhad an extremely disagreeable taste which was especially noticeable in\r\nthe hot water. The conclusion was reached that \"the taste and odour were\r\nnot those of chlorine, but were due to some complex chemical change\r\nbrought about by the action of the chlorine on the organic matter\r\npresent in the water.\"\r\n\r\nThe waters that require the most accurate adjustment of chlorine dosage,\r\nif complaints are to be avoided, are those containing very small amounts\r\nof organic matter. The margin between the dosage required for the\r\nattainment of a satisfactory degree of bacteriological purity and that\r\nwhich may cause complaints is usually very small, often less than 25\r\nper cent, with the waters of the Great Lakes and many filter effluents.\r\nOn the other hand, coloured waters containing large amounts of organic\r\nmatter can be treated with an excess of chlorine without causing tastes\r\nand odours. The author found that the addition of 1.5 p.p.m. of\r\navailable chlorine to the Ottawa River water did not cause complaints\r\nalthough only 0.8 to 0.9 p.p.m. were usually required for satisfactory\r\npurification. Harrington of Montreal has had a similar experience with\r\nthis water.\r\n\r\nThe presence of traces of foreign substances in water sometimes produces\r\nchlorinated derivatives having repugnant tastes and odours. Creosote and\r\ntar oils have caused an odour somewhat resembling that of iodoform and\r\nindustrial wastes have also produced complaints.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of chlorine gas (liquid chlorine) for bleach solutions\r\nhas apparently eliminated tastes and odours in some cases but this may\r\nbe due to a more perfect control over the dosage rather than to any\r\nproperty of the bleach _per se_.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the sludge from bleach plants has caused complaints by\r\nproducing an excessive concentration of chlorine during the period of\r\nits discharge. This occurred in Ottawa on several occasions before it\r\nwas discovered and corrected. When the sludge in the storage tanks\r\nreached the discharge valve it was customary to wash out the tank and\r\ndischarge the sludge into the river. The operators opened the wash out\r\nvalves to the full extent and the sludge and liquor were discharged into\r\nthe river about 70 feet away from the inlet to the sedimentation basin\r\nand on the downstream side of it. A portion of the hypochlorite was\r\nalmost invariably carried into the basin and increased the dosage. This\r\ncondition was remedied by carrying the sludge drain farther down stream\r\nand insisting upon the sludge being discharged at a slower rate.\r\n\r\nKienle[2] has reported similar occurrences at Chicago. The hypochlorite\r\nwas applied at the intake cribs situated a considerable distance off\r\nshore. The direction of the wind often necessitated holding the sludge\r\nfor a considerable length of time but occasionally it was found\r\nimpossible to await favourable conditions with the result that the wind\r\nand wave action carried a portion of the sludge back into the crib and\r\ndown into the shaft and tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the water at the time of treatment is another factor\r\nbearing on the production of tastes and odours. When the temperature is\r\nlow, water absorbs relatively less chlorine (_vide_ Diagram No. II, page\r\n38) in the same period of time with the consequence that, if the dosage\r\nis kept constant, more chlorine is present in the free condition. At\r\nMilwaukee (Kienle)[2] with a dosage of 0.24 p.p.m. of available chlorine\r\n(as bleach) no complaints were received during the spring, summer, and\r\nautumn seasons but when the temperature reached 40 deg. F., they were\r\ncompelled to reduce the chlorine to 0.12 p.p.m. in order to prevent\r\nobjectionable tastes and odours in the tap waters.\r\n\r\nAbnormal conditions such as freshets, and storms, sometimes cause\r\ncomplaints regarding tastes and odours. Adams[3] found that the\r\ncomplaints in Toronto usually accompanied a change in the direction of\r\nthe wind, a sustained east wind being the one most productive of\r\ntrouble. The exact cause for this could not be ascertained but it was\r\nusually found that there was an accompanying increase in the number of\r\nmicroscopical organisms (plankton) present in the raw water.\r\n\r\nFreshets usually increase the bacterial contamination and necessitate an\r\nincreased dosage which may cause complaints.\r\n\r\nComplaints as to tastes and odours can be best avoided by ensuring\r\nregularity of dosage, perfect admixture, and storage of the treated\r\nwater for a reasonable period. These factors are discussed in detail\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Colic._ Although claims have been made that the consumption of\r\nchlorinated water has produced \"colic\" no corroborative evidence has\r\nbeen adduced and the symptoms have probably been due to some other\r\ncause. Dilute solutions of chlorine have been used as intestinal\r\nantiseptics in the treatment of typhoid fever without producing\r\nirritation of the mucous lining and the usual dose for this treatment is\r\none grain of chlorine. Before taking a _medicinal_ dose of chlorine 140\r\ngallons of water containing 0.1 p.p.m. would have to be consumed, a\r\nquantity greater than is ordinarily drunk in a year.\r\n\r\nChlorine and hypochlorites are destructive and irritant to skin and it\r\nis possible that hot chlorinated water has, in some instances, a similar\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt is inconceivable that the addition of minute traces of bleach or\r\nchlorine to water should cause it to extract abnormal amounts of tannin\r\nfrom tea but it is possible that free chlorine, when present, acts upon\r\nthe tea extractives and produces compounds having obnoxious tastes and\r\nodours. Tannin to the ordinary tea drinker represents the disagreeable\r\nportion of the tea and an obnoxious taste in tea brewed with chlorinated\r\nwater would consequently be ascribed to the extraction of abnormal\r\nquantities of tannin.\r\n\r\nAlmost all waterworks departments using chlorination have received\r\ncomplaints to the effect that the water had killed fish and small birds.\r\nThere is usually no evidence that the loss was due to chlorinated water\r\nbut it is generally impossible to convince the owners that the process\r\nof water treatment was not the cause. Many continuous physiological\r\ntests have been made of the effect of chlorinated water on small fish\r\nand have shown that the concentration used in water treatment is without\r\neffect. The author kept a tank of minnows in one of the pumping stations\r\nfor months without loss although the tank was continuously supplied with\r\nwater that had been treated but a few seconds previously. The bleach\r\nsolution was discharged into the suction of the pumps and the water for\r\nthe fish test was taken from the discharge header.\r\n\r\nIt has been found on many occasions that fish are extremely susceptible\r\nto chlorine and hypochlorites. This knowledge has been sometimes used\r\nfor such nefarious purposes as fish poaching, a few pounds of bleach in\r\na small stream being a simple and most effective method of killing all\r\nthe fish which are then carried down stream into a convenient net.\r\nChlorinated sewage effluents have also been known to destroy the fish\r\nlife of the stream into which they were discharged.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of fish culturists as to the action of chlorinated waters\r\nupon fish eggs in hatcheries is almost unanimously to the effect that it\r\nis a destructive one. Fish eggs are extremely sensitive to chlorine and\r\nhypochlorous acid and very few will survive in a water containing 0.1\r\np.p.m. of free chlorine. The Department of Fisheries of the Dominion of\r\nCanada has informed the author that free chlorine in the water had a\r\nmarked adverse effect on the hatching of the eggs of Atlantic salmon,\r\nGreat Lake trout, pickerel, and whitefish, but no effect was noticed\r\nwhen free chlorine was absent. The Department has, however, decided to\r\nremove all the hatcheries to localities where water that does not\r\nrequire chlorination can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe effect of chlorinated water upon seeds, plants, and flowers has been\r\ninvestigated by the Dominion Department of Agriculture and Dr. Gussow\r\n(Dominion Botanist) and Dr. Shutt (Agricultural Chemist) who were in\r\ncharge of the work, have reported that water treated with hypochlorite\r\ncaused no apparent injury to carnations and hybrid roses. Six varieties\r\nof wheat seed, after soaking in freshly prepared hypochlorite solutions\r\n(0.05 to 10 parts per million of available chlorine) were all sown on\r\nthe same day. Germination was found to be uniform throughout and no\r\neffect of the chlorine was observed either as regards the rate of\r\ngermination or the development of the young plants. Experiments on\r\nbarley and oats produced similar results. Radishes, turnips, cucumbers,\r\nand beans also showed no retardation in development after treatment with\r\nchlorinated water.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were conducted with solutions of bleach in distilled\r\nwater, but identical results were obtained in a later series when the\r\ntreated city supply (Ottawa) was used.\r\n\r\nThe results proved conclusively that statements alleging damage to\r\nplants, flowers, and seeds by the hypochlorite treatment of water are\r\nunfounded and do not merit the slightest consideration.\r\n\r\n_Corrosion of Pipes._ Chlorinated water, it has been alleged on many\r\noccasions, causes rapid corrosion of galvanised iron water services and\r\nespecially of the water tubes of boilers, water heaters, etc. When\r\nbleach is used for water treatment, a slight increase in the hardness is\r\nproduced but as this is mostly due to calcium chloride, there is no\r\ncorresponding increase in the salts that form a protective coating. The\r\npresence of traces of calcium chloride and chloro-organic compounds\r\nmight tend to increase the corrosive properties of a water but this\r\nincrease is probably so small as to be negligible.\r\n\r\nIf pipe corrosion is considered by the carbonic acid hypothesis, the use\r\nof bleach should tend to reduce it because bleach contains an excess of\r\nbase that combines with a portion of the free carbonic acid. The results\r\nof routine tests for free carbonic acid made on the raw and treated\r\nwaters at Ottawa are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  -------+----------------------+-------------------------\r\n         |   CARBONIC ACID.     |\r\n         |  PARTS PER MILLION   |\r\n   Year. +----------+-----------+   Nature of Treatment.\r\n         |Raw Water.|Chlorinated|\r\n         |          |   Water.  |\r\n  -------+----------+-----------+-------------------------\r\n   1915  |   1.44   |   1.41    | Bleach\r\n   1916  |   0.92   |   0.85    | Bleach\r\n   1917  |   0.84   |   0.81    | Bleach first four months\r\n         |          |           | Chloramine during last\r\n         |          |           | eight months\r\n  -------+----------+-----------+-------------------------\r\n\r\nThese figures shown that the hypochlorite treatment produced a small but\r\ndefinite decrease in the carbonic acid content and should, _caeteris\r\nparibus_, tend to reduce and not increase corrosion.\r\n\r\nIf the corrosion of pipes is considered according to the electrolytic\r\ntheory, a slight increase, due to an increased electrical conductivity,\r\nmight be anticipated. The effect of the addition of hypochlorite upon\r\nthe electrical conductivity of distilled water and the Ottawa River\r\nwater is shown in Diagram VI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM VI\r\n\r\nEffect of Calcium Hypochlorite on Electrical Conductivity]\r\n\r\nWith the concentrations of hypochlorite ordinarily used in water\r\ntreatment it is inconceivable that the slight increase in the electrical\r\nconductivity has any practical significance at low temperatures. The\r\nconductivity increases rapidly, however, with increase of temperature\r\nand any increment due to chlorination might produce a slight appreciable\r\neffect at temperatures approaching the boiling-point of water.\r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine does not increase the conductivity to the same extent as\r\nan equivalent quantity of hypochlorite but it increases the carbonic\r\nacid content in proportion to the dosage used.\r\n\r\nThe author investigated the action of hypochlorite on galvanised pipes\r\nin 1914 and was unable to detect any definite corrosion with normal\r\nconcentrations of chlorine. The experiments were made with 2-inch pipes\r\nand an examination of the first consignment received showed that,\r\nalthough the galvanising on the outside was perfect, the inner coat was\r\nvery inferior: in some parts there was an excess of zinc that broke away\r\non scraping whilst in others the iron pipe was bare.\r\n\r\nA committee of the Pittsburg Board of Trade, appointed to investigate\r\ncomplaints as to pipe corrosion, reported in 1917 that they were largely\r\ndue to inferior qualities of pipes and not to the method of water\r\npurification employed (slow sand filtration and chlorination).\r\n\r\nThe effect of chlorination on the _plumbo-solvency_ of water was\r\ninvestigated in 1904 by Houston who found that chlorine, as chloros, in\r\namounts between one and ten parts per million, did not appreciably\r\nincrease the plumbo-solvent action of either unfiltered or filtered\r\nwater. Similar results were obtained by the author with the Toronto\r\nsupply: raw lake water, filtered water, and water treated with 0.25 and\r\n0.50 p.p.m. of chlorine, all dissolved the same quantity of lead in\r\ntwenty-four hours. The amount in each case was too small to be of any\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n[1] Letton. J. Amer. Waterworks Assoc., 1915, 2, 688.\r\n\r\n[2] Kienle. J. Amer.

Health Assoc., 1916, 6, 867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBLEACH TREATMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treatment of water with bleach alone has been largely supplanted by\r\nthe liquid chlorine process but the following details will be of use on\r\nmeeting conditions for which liquid chlorine cannot be used and also for\r\nthe preparation of the hypochlorite solution required in the chloramine\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe essential features of a bleach installation are the solution or\r\nmixing tanks, storage tanks, piping system, discharge orifice or weir,\r\nand sludge drain.\r\n\r\nBleach is usually sent out by the manufacturers in sheet steel drums, 39\r\ninches high and 29-1/2 inches in diameter, which contain about 14 cu.\r\nft. of bleach and weigh approximately 750 pounds gross and 690 pounds\r\nnet. It can be most economically purchased in car lots and if the\r\nconsumption warrants this procedure storage should be provided for about\r\n70 drums or rather more than one car load. According to Hooker[1] bleach\r\nloses 1 per cent of available chlorine per month in hot seasons and 0.3\r\nper cent in cold ones so that it is advisable to carry as little stock\r\nas possible during hot weather. Hot weather also causes a further loss\r\nby accelerating the action of the bleach on the drum which rapidly\r\ndisintegrates and cannot be handled. Bleach can often be purchased more\r\ncheaply in hot weather but such a policy is a short sighted one unless\r\nit is required for immediate use.\r\n\r\nThe general design of a hypochlorite plant is largely determined by the\r\ncapacity but in all cases an effort should be made to avoid complicated\r\ndetails which may appear advantageous in the drafting office but do not\r\nstand up in actual practice. Many metals rapidly develop a protective\r\ncoating on immersion in bleach solution but if this is removed by\r\nfriction, rapid erosion ensues; bearing metallic surfaces should be\r\nreduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\n_Mixing Tanks._ All tanks, whether mixing or storage, should be\r\nconstructed of concrete and painted with two coats of asphalt.\r\nExperience has shown that wooden tanks are not suitable. The author has\r\nused pine, oak, and cypress tanks but all were rapidly leached by the\r\nhypochlorite and ultimately had to be lined with concrete.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable variation in the concentration of bleach\r\nsolution made in mixing tanks at various works. Some operators use about\r\none gallon of water per pound of bleach and mix the two to a cream by\r\nwooden paddles, revolving on a central axis, for 1-2 hours; the paddles\r\nare then stopped and the cream run out into the storage tanks and\r\ndiluted to the required strength by passing water through the mixing\r\ntank. There are two objections to this method: (1) the addition of small\r\nquantities of water to bleach tends to gelatinisation which may protect\r\nlumps from the further action of water and (2) a stratification of the\r\nsolution occurs in the storage tank unless agitation is used.\r\nGelatinisation causes loss of available chlorine and stratification\r\ncauses irregular dosage unless corrected by agitation, which\r\nnecessitates power. Other operators mix the bleach and water to the\r\nfinal concentration in the mixing tank and discharge the contents into\r\nthe storage tank, the intermittent process being repeated until the\r\nstorage tank is full. Gelatinisation is avoided by using a low original\r\nconcentration and as all batches are of equal density no stratification\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\nAt Ottawa the bleach is crushed and, after weighing, dumped into a\r\ncircular concrete tank provided with a hinged wooden lid. The stirring\r\narrangement consists of a bronze shaft on which an aluminium impeller is\r\nfixed which revolves in an iron tube set slightly above the bottom of\r\nthe tank (see Fig. 1). After the requisite amount of water has been\r\nadded the motor connected to the bronze shaft is started and the mixture\r\npumped for 15-20 minutes; without waiting for the sludge to settle the\r\ncontents are discharged into the storage tank and the operation repeated\r\nuntil the tank is full. The piping between the mixing and storage tanks\r\nis of galvanised iron of generous dimension so as to compensate for\r\nincrustation. The pipes are straight and are provided with crosses at\r\nevery change of direction to enable excessive incrustation to be\r\nremoved. The valves should be made of hard rubber or special bronze; if\r\nbrass valves are used they will probably require renewing every twelve\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Mixing Tank for Bleach.]\r\n\r\nThe concentration of solution necessarily depends upon local conditions\r\nbut it is usually advisable to keep it below 2.5 per cent of bleach,\r\nwhich is equivalent to 0.85 per cent of available chlorine.\r\n\r\n_Storage Tanks._ These should be built of reinforced concrete and\r\npainted inside with asphalt, which should be periodically renewed to\r\nprevent the solution seeping through to the reinforcement. At least two\r\ntanks should be provided so that one may be filled and allowed to settle\r\nbefore being put in operation. The hypochlorite discharge pipe is\r\nusually 6-9 inches from the bottom to permit the collection of sludge,\r\nwhich is run off when it reaches the elevation of the hypochlorite\r\ndischarge. The sludge drain, which opens into the bottom of the tank, is\r\nusually a 4- or 6-inch cast-iron pipe, with suitable gate valve, which\r\ndischarges into a common drain made of clay pipe.\r\n\r\nThe storage tanks should be provided with either glass gauges or float\r\nindicators to enable the orifice discharge to be checked up at\r\nperiodical intervals.\r\n\r\n_Regulation of Dosage._ The discharge of the hypochlorite solution is\r\nusually regulated either by maintaining a constant head on an orifice of\r\nvariable dimension or by varying the head on an orifice of fixed\r\ndimension. The weir principle may also be used but it is not so well\r\nadapted for hypochlorite as for other chemicals.\r\n\r\nIn the constant head method, the head is maintained by a bronze valve\r\nconnected to a float made of glass or tinned copper. In many cases the\r\norifice is a rectangular slot in a brass plate and is adjusted by means\r\nof a brass slide operated by a micrometer screw. Brass plates are not\r\nvery suitable as they become corroded and so reduce the size of the\r\norifice; if the incrustation is removed the orifice will discharge more\r\nthan the calibration indicates. Needle valves are unsuitable for similar\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nAn example of an orifice feed box of the constant head type is shown in\r\nFig. 2. A vertically arranged hard-rubber pipe passes though a hard\r\nrubber stuffing box in the bottom of the tank and has one or more\r\norifices near its upper end. The area of the submerged portions of the\r\norifices is controlled by the hand wheel which is connected with the\r\nthreaded stem of the pipe. The stem has sixteen threads per inch, and\r\none revolution of the wheel will submerge the orifices one-sixteenth of\r\nan inch. The extent to which the orifices are submerged is indicated on\r\nthe dial fixed to the side of the tank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Dosage Tank.]\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows the regulating mechanism of another apparatus of the\r\nconstant head type. The orifice consists of a circular slot in a hard\r\nrubber disc and is regulated by means of a hand wheel which operates a\r\nhard rubber slide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Orifice Controlling Device.]\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of one of the variable head types is shown in\r\nFig. 4. A constant head is maintained on the valve _V_ by a float and\r\ncock operating in a lead- or porcelain-lined tank. The circular tapered\r\norifice _O_, cut in glass, is situated in the flanged end of the iron\r\ncasting _C_ and the head, indicated on the gauge glass, is regulated by\r\nvalve _V_. This arrangement is simple and reasonably accurate. The\r\norifice may show slight incrustation after being in service for some\r\ntime but it can be easily cleaned by means of a test-tube brush or a\r\nsmall swab moistened with acid; a wire or rod tends to break the edge of\r\nthe conical orifice and should not be used.\r\n\r\nThe volume of solution discharged by orifices of various dimensions is\r\nshown in Diagram XV, page 149. Diagram XVI, page 149, facilitates the\r\ncalculation of the number of pounds of bleach required for any dosage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Variable Head Dosage Box.]\r\n\r\nThe solution discharged from the orifice box is carried to the point of\r\napplication either in galvanised iron pipes of generous dimension or in\r\nrubber hose. Pumps may be used for raising the solution to a higher\r\nelevation but unless special material is used in their construction they\r\ncorrode rapidly and cannot be kept in service. Whenever possible, a\r\nwater injector should be used as it does not corrode and assists in\r\nmaintaining the delivery pipes free from sludge. All delivery pipes\r\nshould be duplicated and blown out regularly by water under pressure;\r\nthey should also be protected from frost.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment of the hypochlorite dosage can be automatically regulated\r\nin plants where the flow of the water to be treated is measured by a\r\nVenturi meter or other suitable appliance. Various devices have been\r\nsuggested and used but, in general, they are not so successful as\r\nautomatic regulators for liquid chlorine on account of the presence of\r\nsludge particles which tend to diminish the area of the orifice.\r\n\r\nFor small plants, barrels have often been used as solution and storage\r\nvessels with, in some instances, fairly successful results. The bleach\r\nprocess, however, cannot be recommended for small installations because\r\nthe chemical control necessary for successful operation is usually not\r\navailable. One drum of bleach may suffice for several months operation\r\nand as the powder gradually loses strength, the dosage constantly\r\ndiminishes and may jeopardise the safety of the supply. Liquid chlorine\r\nmachines are much more suitable than hypochlorite installations for\r\nsupplies having no chemical control.\r\n\r\nBleach is being very extensively used for the sterilisation of the water\r\nused by the allied troops in France. The water supplies on the British\r\nfront are all more or less subject to pollution and it is consequently\r\nnecessary, to ensure adequate protection, to chlorinate all supplies\r\nwith bleach. Other forms of chlorine have been tried but have not proved\r\nsuccessful near the firing lines. The details of the technique employed\r\ncannot be given but it may be stated that the concentration of chlorine\r\nemployed is always more than sufficient and that residual tastes and\r\nodours are regarded as secondary considerations. Treated water is always\r\ntested by the starch-iodide method and a bacteriological examination is\r\nfrequently made by mobile laboratories.\r\n\r\n=Control of Hypochlorite Plants.= If efficient operation and regular\r\ndosage is to be obtained, it is necessary that hypochlorite plants\r\nshould be controlled by a trained chemist. Good results are occasionally\r\nobtained without such control but in every plant circumstances arise at\r\nsome period or another which only a chemist is qualified to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe points that require consideration are (1) the composition of the\r\nbleach; (2) concentration of available chlorine in the prepared\r\nsolutions; and (3) chemical tests for free chlorine in the treated\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n(1) _Composition of Bleach._ Each drum of bleach should be sampled and\r\nanalysed before use. The sample is obtained by cutting out the head of\r\nthe drum and removing a vertical section by means of a special sampling\r\ntube or a piece of half-inch iron pipe which is forced to the bottom of\r\nthe drum with a boring motion and then removed; the core is then forced\r\nout by means of a rod, mixed, and quartered down to the required size.\r\n\r\nFor analysis weigh out 5 grms. on a balance sensitive to 0.01 grm. and\r\ngrind in a mortar with 50-70 c.cms. of water; wash into a 250 c.cm.\r\nflask and make the volume up to 250 c.cms.; shake. After allowing the\r\nsludge to settle remove 10 c.cms. by means of a pipette and titrate by\r\none of the following methods:\r\n\r\n_Bunsen's Method._ Add 10 c.cms. of a 5 per cent solution of potassium\r\niodide and 0.5 c.cm. glacial acetic acid and titrate with sodium\r\nthiosulphate (24.8 grms. of the C.P. crystalline salt and 1 c.cm. of\r\nchloroform per litre) using a starch solution as indicator. Each cubic\r\ncentimetre of thiosulphate used = 1.755 per cent of available chlorine\r\n(1 c.cm. N/10 sodium thiosulphate = 0.00355 grm. available chlorine).\r\n\r\n_Penot's Method._ Dilute the hypochlorite solution with 15 c.cms. of\r\nwater and titrate with a solution of N/10 sodium arsenite using\r\nstarch-iodide paper as an external indicator. Each c.cm. of solution\r\nused = 1.755 per cent of available chlorine (1 c.cm. = 0.00355 grm.\r\navailable chlorine). The use of an external indicator makes this process\r\na slow one and to overcome this objection Mohr proposed the addition of\r\nan excess of sodium arsenite solution and then titrating with N/10\r\niodine solution after adding a few drops of starch solution.\r\n\r\nGriffen and Hedallen[2] compared these three methods and found that\r\nPenot's method and Mohr's modification of that method gave results\r\nwhich were 0.6 per cent lower than those obtained by Bunsen's method.\r\n\r\nFor a separate estimation of the chlorine present as chloride, chlorate,\r\nand hypochlorite the method given in Sutton's Volumetric Analysis, 10th\r\nedition, page 178, should be followed.\r\n\r\n_Storage Liquor._ This is tested by any of the above methods. It has\r\nbeen proposed to determine the strength of the bleach solution by the\r\nuse of a hydrometer but the results are not sufficiently accurate and\r\nthe method cannot be recommended.\r\n\r\nIf bleach is properly broken up and thoroughly agitated in the mixing\r\ntank at least 95 per cent of the available chlorine should be extracted.\r\nThe efficiency of the extraction process is checked by comparing the\r\ntests of the storage liquor with those of the dry bleach and each batch\r\nof liquor should be tested daily. It is sometimes advisable to take two\r\nsamples from each tank, one soon after a tank has been put into\r\noperation, and a second sample at the end of the run. Considerable\r\ndifferences are occasionally found between these samples and are due,\r\neither to inadequate agitation of the liquor in the storage tank, or\r\ninefficient mixing in the mixing tank. If the results are irregular the\r\nformer is the more probable cause but if the second sample is invariably\r\nstronger the mixing tank operations should be investigated. The\r\nincreased concentration of the second sample is due to unextracted\r\nbleach passing out of the mixing tank and gradually becoming leached as\r\nthe tank contents are run off. If the bleach is lumpy and is not\r\nsubsequently broken up, losses are almost inevitable.\r\n\r\nHale[3] found that during the period when the New York City supply was\r\nbeing treated with bleach it was necessary to constantly check the\r\noperations of the labourers by frequent samples. \"During one week about\r\n95 per cent of the chlorine added was actually applied, the second week\r\nit dropped to 85 per cent. and the third week to 75 per cent. Whenever\r\na poor run is called to the attention of the labourers, results\r\nimprove.\"\r\n\r\nBy taking two samples daily from each tank discharged the author has\r\nbeen able to obtain an average annual efficiency on the Ottawa plant of\r\n94 per cent., i.e. the solutions contained 94 per cent. of the available\r\nchlorine contained in the bleach. In making such checks it is necessary\r\nto keep a careful account of the stock of bleach to prevent labourers\r\nadding a few extra pounds of bleach to compensate for losses.\r\n\r\nSludge forms an appreciable but unavoidable source of loss of material.\r\nWhen the sludge reaches the outlet of the hypochlorite pipe the sludge\r\nmust be run to waste; otherwise it will pass over and tend to choke the\r\ndosage control apparatus. If the sludge is run into the same body of\r\nwater that forms the source of supply, it must be discharged very slowly\r\nto prevent a possibility of over dosage and damage to fish life. With\r\nproper control, sludge losses can easily be kept under 2 per cent. and\r\noften under 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe greatest source of unavoidable loss in hypochlorite plants is from\r\ndeterioration of the bleach during storage; in warm climates this loss\r\nmay exceed 10 per cent. In Ottawa where high temperatures are only\r\nexperienced during the summer months the loss from this cause has\r\naveraged from 7-8 per cent. on the bleach stored during that period.\r\n\r\n_Detection and Estimation of Free Chlorine._ The oldest and probably the\r\nbest known test for free chlorine in water is the Wagner test, made by\r\nadding a few drops of potassium iodide and starch; the presence of\r\nchlorine is indicated by a deep rich blue colouration that is\r\nproportional in intensity to the quantity of chlorine present. When this\r\ntest is used as a colorimetric method for the estimation of chlorine\r\nseveral difficulties are encountered; the intensity of the colour\r\nproduced by the majority of treated waters gradually diminishes and the\r\nloss is usually more rapid than in the standards made up with distilled\r\nwater; a different result is obtained if the solutions are acidified and\r\nthe results vary with different acids, acetic acid yielding a much lower\r\nresult than a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid; in the presence of\r\nacid the colouration usually intensifies on standing, whereas the\r\nstandard intensifies but little. The difference caused by the addition\r\nof acid is imperfectly understood but it is obvious that the chlorine\r\nset free by the acid cannot be present in the \"free\" state; it is\r\nprobably in a semi-labile condition loosely attached to organic\r\ncompounds. Whether this semi-labile chlorine is available for germicidal\r\naction is at present not definitely known but it has been noted by\r\nseveral observers that the germicidal action proceeds after the \"free\"\r\nchlorine reaction has disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe method used by the author for the estimation of free chlorine is as\r\nfollows: place 500 c.cms. of the sample in a stoppered bottle, add 1\r\nc.cm. of 5 per cent KI solution, 2 drops of conc. HCl and 1 c.cm. of\r\nstarch solution and titrate with N/1000 sodium thiosulphate until\r\ncolourless. The difficulty introduced by the opalescence of the liquid\r\nis overcome by pouring portions of the liquid into two Nessler tubes and\r\nadding a drop of thiosulphate solution to one and noting if any\r\nreduction of colour occurs on shaking; if the intensity of the colour is\r\ndiminished, the contents of both tubes are poured back into the bottle\r\nand titrated until no further colour removal, as shown by the tubes, can\r\nbe obtained. One c.cm. of N/1000 sodium thiosulphate = 0.07 p.p.m. of\r\navailable chlorine when 500 c.cms. of water are used.\r\n\r\nAdams[4] has employed the colorimetric method of estimating the colour\r\nobtained after the addition of dilute H_{2}SO_{4}, KI, and starch but\r\nused standard solutions of dyes for comparison. The standards were\r\nprepared from mixtures of Brilliant Mill Green \"S\" and Cardinal Red \"J\"\r\nand were made up weekly.\r\n\r\nPhelps found that ortho-tolidine in acetic acid solution produced an\r\nintense yellow colouration with free chlorine and suggested the use of\r\nthis reagent as a qualitative test for chlorine. Ellms and Hauser[5]\r\ndeveloped this process into a quantitative one and substituted\r\nhydrochloric acid for acetic acid as a solvent. One c.cm. of the reagent\r\n(1 gram of pure _o_-tolidine dissolved in 1 litre of 10 per cent of\r\nhydrochloric acid) is added to 100 c.cms. of the sample in a Nessler\r\ntube and the colour compared after five minutes with permanent standards\r\nmade up with mixtures of potassium bichromate and copper sulphate. This\r\nmethod was adopted as the official standard method of the American\r\nPublic Health Association; the details are given in the Appendix (p.\r\n147).\r\n\r\nThe author has found that this method gives excellent results except for\r\ncoloured waters. The colouring matter in many waters diminishes in\r\nintensity on the addition of acids and is somewhat similar in tint to\r\nthat produced by addition of _o_-tolidine. If the reaction is used\r\nqualitatively on coloured treated water and a comparison made with the\r\nuntreated sample, a negative result, due to the reduction in colour\r\nproduced by the acid being greater than the increase caused by the\r\nreagent, might be obtained when traces of free chlorine are present.\r\nSimilar difficulties are encountered when quantitative comparisons are\r\nmade against permanent standards.\r\n\r\nBenzidine (Wallis[6]) has also been suggested for the detection of free\r\nchlorine. On adding this reagent a blue colouration is produced but on\r\nstirring it rapidly changes to a bright yellow which is proportional in\r\nintensity to the amount of free chlorine present. Ellms and Hauser[5]\r\ninvestigated benzidine in 1913 and found it to be inferior to\r\n_o_-tolidine as a test reagent for free chlorine.\r\n\r\nLeRoy[7] has proposed the use of\r\nhexamethyltri_para_-aminotriphenylmethane for detecting and estimating\r\nfree chlorine. On the addition of a hydrochloric acid solution of this\r\ncompound to a sample containing free chlorine a violet colouration is\r\nproduced that can be matched in the usual way with standards. It is\r\nstated that 0.03 p.p.m. of free chlorine gives a distinct colouration\r\nand that the reagent reacts very slowly with nitrites and is quite\r\nunaffected by hydrogen peroxide.\r\n\r\nThe starch-iodide and _o_-tolidine reactions are affected by oxidising\r\nagents or reducible substances; nitrites and ferric salts are the\r\ncompounds that are most likely to interfere and Ellms and Hauser[5] have\r\nfound that these bodies do not affect the _o_-tolidine reaction to the\r\nsame extent as the starch-iodide reaction. Very small quantities of\r\nnitrites (0.03 p.p.m. of N) and ferric salts (0.2 p.p.m. Fe) give a blue\r\ncolouration with the starch-iodide reagent and for this reason it is\r\nalways advisable, whenever possible, to make a control test on the\r\nuntreated water. Nitrites are oxidised by free chlorine and consequently\r\ndo not interfere with the estimation of it by the thiosulphate method;\r\nthe influence of ferric salts can be overcome by substituting 3 c.cms.\r\nof 25 per cent phosphoric acid for hydrochloric acid (Winkler[8]).\r\n\r\nAn electrical instrument called a \"chlorometer\" has been devised by E.\r\nK. Rideal and Evans[9] for the estimation of free chlorine. The\r\ndiagrammatic sketch, reproduced in Fig. 5, shows the general\r\nconstruction of the apparatus. When water containing no free chlorine\r\npasses through the copper tube, hydrogen is liberated on the platinum\r\nrod by the electrolytic solution pressure of the copper and an electric\r\ncurrent is generated; a polarizing action follows and the flow of\r\ncurrent ceases. When free chlorine is present it combines with the\r\nhydrogen as produced and so enables more copper to dissolve and produces\r\na permanent flow of current. The current produced is a function of the\r\ndepolarizing action, i.e. of the free chlorine, and is indicated by the\r\ncurrent meter which is graduated in parts per million of available\r\nchlorine. The usual range of instrument is 5 p.p.m. and each division of\r\nthe scale is equal to one-tenth of one part per million.\r\n\r\nOnly strong oxidisers, such as chlorine, ozone, and permanganates, which\r\nhave a great affinity for hydrogen, are able to produce a permanent\r\ncurrent; ferric chloride and other weak oxidisers do not affect the\r\nindicator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Rideal-Evans Chlorometer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTS\r\n\r\n_Cost of Construction._ According to the replies received by\r\nthe Committee on Water Supplies of the American Public Health\r\nAssociation[10] the total cost of equipment for disinfection varies\r\nwidely and bears no apparent relation to the capacity of the equipment.\r\nThis is due to the temporary nature of the plants erected in many cities\r\nand the necessity of erecting expensive structures in others. The cost\r\nof construction varies also in different localities. The cost of\r\nequipping hypochlorite plants with standard concrete tanks and dosage\r\nregulators would be more uniform and for capacities between 10 and 50\r\nmillion gallons per day would approximate $15 to $50 per million\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\n_The operating cost_ of bleach plants shows similar wide variations. In\r\nsome cases the labour required for mixing and supervision can be\r\nobtained without extra cost whilst in others the labour charge exceeds\r\nthe cost of hypochlorite.\r\n\r\nThe price of bleach has shown violent fluctuations during the last three\r\nyears (see Diagram IX, page 125) but is now (1918) comparatively steady\r\nat $2.25 to $2.75 per 100 pounds. Assuming that 33.3 per cent of\r\navailable chlorine can be extracted, each pound of chlorine costs\r\n6.75-7.25 cents as compared with 15-25 cents for liquid chlorine. The\r\nfixed charges on the capital expenditures together with the labour and\r\nincidental charges almost invariably make the total cost of operation of\r\na straight bleach plant higher than that of a liquid chlorine plant. The\r\ntendency during the last four years has been to substitute liquid\r\nchlorine for hypochlorite and the majority of the plants are now of the\r\nformer type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ANTICHLORS\"\r\n\r\nSubstances used for the removal of excess chlorine are usually known as\r\n\"antichlors\" and those that have been most frequently employed are\r\nsodium bisulphite, NaHSO_{3}, and sodium thiosulphate Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}.\r\nThe reactions with chlorine are:\r\n\r\n   (i) NaHSO_{3} + Cl_{2} + H_{2}O = NaHSO_{4} + 2HCl.\r\n\r\n  (ii) Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3} + Cl_{2} = Na_{2}S_{4}O_{6} + 2NaCl.\r\n\r\nSodium bisulphite is a very efficient \"antichlor,\" only 1.46 parts being\r\nrequired to remove 1 part of chlorine, but owing to its instability the\r\naction is uncertain. Sodium thiosulphate is a comparatively stable\r\ncheap salt, containing 5 molecules of water of crystallization,\r\nNa_{2}S_{2}O_{3} . 5H_{2}O but 7 parts are necessary to remove 1 part by\r\nweight of chlorine.\r\n\r\n\"Antichlors\" are used as aqueous solutions and the dosage controlled in\r\nthe same manner as for bleach solutions. The action is an instantaneous\r\none and it is consequently necessary that the germicidal action should\r\nbe complete before the \"antichlor\" is added.\r\n\r\nFilters, containing solid materials capable of absorbing free chlorine,\r\nhave also been used for removing the excess of the germicidal reagent.\r\nIron borings and aluminium were used experimentally by Thresh[11] but\r\nthe process was not commercially developed. The \"De Chlor\" filter, in\r\nwhich carbon is the active substance, has been installed at several\r\nwater works in England (Reading, Exeter, Aldershot) with apparently\r\nsuccessful results. The Reading experimental installation, described by\r\nWalker,[12] consisted of a steel drum, 8 feet 3 inches in width, the top\r\nand bottom being domed. In the upper portion, 10 feet 9 inches in depth,\r\nprovision was made for thorough admixture of the bleach solution and\r\nwater and a subsequent storage of thirty minutes. The lower section of\r\nthe filter was divided into three compartments, the first and last of\r\nwhich contained graded silica; the middle compartment was filled with a\r\nlayer (20 inches deep) of specially prepared granulated charcoal or\r\ncarbon.\r\n\r\nThe filter was operated under pressure and passed an average of 192,000\r\nImp. gallons per day, the rate being 32,000 Imp. gallons per square yard\r\nper day.\r\n\r\nWater from the pre-filters (polarite and sand) was treated with bleach\r\nto give a concentration of 1 p.p.m. of available chlorine and passed\r\nthrough the De Chlor filter. The average bacteriological results\r\nobtained during the first six months operation were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Bacteria Per  c.cm.       B. coli Index\r\n                           Gelatine 3 Days at 20 deg. C.

It is stated\r\nthat the carbon has to be removed and revivified periodically. The\r\nfilter was washed about once per week, the wash water being only\r\none-tenth of one per cent.\r\n\r\nThe experimental filter was operated for nearly two years before being\r\nremoved to permit the erection of larger units having a total capacity\r\nof one million Imp. gallons per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n[1] Hooker.

He\r\nstated that: \"It occurred to me that chlorine gas might be found\r\nsatisfactory ... if suitable means could be found for using it.... The\r\nnext important question was how to render the gas portable. This might\r\nbe accomplished in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in\r\nlead-lined iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal,\r\nand fitted with a tap or a screw cap. The tap is turned on, and the\r\ncylinder placed in the amount of water required. The chlorine bubbles\r\nout, and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe, and has\r\nonly to be rendered tasteless by the addition of sodium sulphite made\r\ninto a cake or tablet.... The cylinders could, of course, be refilled.\r\nThis method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water\r\ncarts.\"\r\n\r\nThe first _practical_ demonstration of the possibilities of this method\r\nwas made by Major Darnall[2] of the Medical Corps, United States Army,\r\nin 1910. Chlorine was taken from steel cylinders and passed through\r\nautomatic reducing valves which provided a uniform flow of gas for the\r\nwater requiring treatment. A uniform flow of water was maintained\r\nthrough the mixing pipe and so secured a uniform dosage. This apparatus\r\nmight be considered as the forerunner of the various commercial types of\r\nmachines that were developed later and which are being so extensively\r\nused at the present time.\r\n\r\nA working model, having a capacity of 500 gallons per hour, was erected\r\nat Fort Myer, Va., and was operated on water that had been treated with\r\nalum but had received no further purification. Despite the presence of\r\nthe flocculated organic matter, satisfactory purification was obtained\r\nwith 0.5 to 1.0 p.p.m. of available chlorine and no taste or odour was\r\nimparted to the supply.\r\n\r\nFrom the results obtained at Fort Myer, and Washington, D.C., Darnall\r\nconcluded that \"In general, it may be said that with an average\r\nunfiltered river water such as that of the Potomac, about one-half of\r\none part (by weight) of chlorine gas per million of water will be\r\nrequired. For clear lake waters three-tenths to four-tenths of a part\r\nper million will be sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nA Board of Officers of the War Department examined the results and\r\nreported (June, 1911) \"That the apparatus is as efficient as\r\npurification by ozone or hypochlorite and is more reliable in operation\r\nthan either.... That it could be installed at a very low cost and that\r\nthe cost of operation would be very slight.\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1912, Ornstein experimented with chlorine gas, obtained from\r\nthe liquefied gas in cylinders, for sewage and water disinfection but\r\nhis method differed from Darnall's in first dissolving the gas in water\r\nand feeding the solution to the liquid to be treated.\r\n\r\nKienle[3] made experiments at Wilmington, Del., in November, 1912, and\r\nobtained a constant flow of gas by means of high- and low-pressure\r\nvalves; the gas was dissolved in water in an absorption tower and\r\nafterwards fed to the water to be treated.\r\n\r\nVan Loan and Thomas of Philadelphia experimented with liquid chlorine on\r\na large scale at the Belmont Filter Plant in September, 1912. The\r\nchlorine was fed into the filtered water basin in the gaseous state and\r\nthe quantity was regulated by the loss in weight of the containers. The\r\ndosage was approximately 0.14 p.p.m. (West[4]).\r\n\r\nJackson, of Brooklyn, made similar experiments about the same time at\r\nthe Ridgewood Reservoir, Brooklyn, and his type of apparatus was shortly\r\nafterwards put on the market as the Leavitt-Jackson Liquid Chlorine\r\nMachine. The regulation of the flow in this machine was determined by\r\nthe loss in weight of the gas cylinder which was suspended from a\r\nsensitive scale beam. By moving the counterbalancing weight on the beam\r\nat a constant rate, a uniform flow of gas was obtained, the area of the\r\norifice being kept constant by the equilibrium in the balance operating\r\ncontrolling valves through a system of levers.\r\n\r\nThis type of apparatus was tried at several places but it was found that\r\nthe adjustment of the regulating mechanism was too sensitive and\r\nproduced considerable irregularities in the flow of gas.\r\n\r\nThe type used by Ornstein and Kienle were combined and commercially\r\ndeveloped by the Electric Bleaching Gas Co. of New York.[A] In this\r\ncombined type the gas was collected from one or more cylinders by means\r\nof a manifold which delivered it to the regulating mechanism at the\r\npressure indicated by a gauge attached to the inlet pipe. Beyond this\r\ngauge were two pressure-regulating devices, the first being used\r\nprimarily to reduce the initial pressure to about 15 pounds per square\r\ninch, and the second for controlling the pressure through a range\r\nsufficient to give the desired discharge of gas. The gas from the second\r\nregulator passed through an orifice in a plate at a pressure indicated\r\nby a suitable gauge which was calibrated in terms of weight of chlorine\r\nper unit of time. The gas, on leaving the regulating apparatus, passed\r\nup an absorption tower of hard rubber, where it met a descending stream\r\nof water. The solution was carried by suitable piping to the point of\r\napplication. This type was modified in some cases by the substitution of\r\na flow meter of the float type for the inferential pressure meter.\r\n\r\n  [A] This type has recently been withdrawn from the market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Manual Control Chlorinator, Solution Feed, Type\r\nA.]\r\n\r\nAnother type of apparatus, developed by Wallace and Tiernan,[A] is shown\r\nin Figs. 6 and 7. The gas under the pressure indicated by the tank\r\npressure gauge (Fig. 6) passes into the pressure compensating chamber,\r\nwhich maintains a constant drop in pressure across the chlorine control\r\nvalve, through the check valve, and into the solution jar after\r\nmeasurement in the pulsating meter. The water required for dissolving\r\nthe chlorine enters the jar through the feed line and check valve and\r\nthe solution passes along the feed line after being water sealed in a\r\nspecial chamber. The meter is a volumetric displacement one and is\r\nregulated by observing the number of pulsations per minute. Each\r\npulsation corresponds to 100 milligrams or 0.00022 pound of chlorine;\r\ndiagrams for converting pulsations per minute into weight per\r\ntwenty-four hours are usually provided with the apparatus. This type of\r\nmeter is suitable for quantities between 0.1 and 12 pounds per day and\r\npossesses the distinct advantage of enabling the operator to see the\r\nactual delivery of the gas.\r\n\r\n  [A] Manufactured by Wallace and Tiernan Co. Inc. N. Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Manual Control Chlorinator, Solution Feed, Type\r\nB.]\r\n\r\nThe quantities of gas exceeding 12 pounds per day the type shown in Fig.\r\n7 may be used. The gas from the control valve passes through a visible\r\nglass orifice which is connected with the manometer. This manometer, or\r\nchlorine meter, contains carbon tetrachloride and is graduated\r\nempirically in terms of weight of chlorine per unit of time. A suitable\r\ngauge indicates the back pressure thrown by the check valve and\r\nregisters the same pressure as the tank gauge when the flow of gas is\r\nstopped. The gas passes into the glass cylinder where it is dissolved in\r\nwater and passes out by the feed pipe.\r\n\r\nThe most accurate range of the orifice type is from 1-6, i.e. if the\r\nminimum graduation on the scale is 10, the maximum is 60. If quantities\r\nless than the minimum graduation are desired, a smaller orifice with its\r\ncorresponding scale can be substituted in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThese types are manually controlled, but automatic control types, to\r\nmeet almost any condition, can be obtained and are in use in many\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nIn some instances (dry-feed types) the chlorine gas is not dissolved in\r\nwater prior to addition to the water requiring treatment but is carried\r\nto the point of application as a dry gas and enters the water through a\r\ndiffusion plate made of carborundum sponge. The sponge becomes saturated\r\nwith water because of the capillary action of the carborundum upon the\r\nwater. The pressure of the chlorine in the feed pipe forces the gas\r\nthrough the diffuser in the form of minute bubbles which become\r\nsaturated with moisture. On meeting the water they immediately go into\r\nsolution and no gas escapes.\r\n\r\nThe operation of liquid chlorine machines is exceedingly simple. After\r\nthe cylinders have been connected, the cylinder valves are opened and\r\nthe joints tested for leakage by holding a swab of absorbent cotton\r\nsaturated with strong ammonia under them; a leakage is indicated by the\r\nappearance of white fumes of ammonium chloride. The control valve is\r\nthen slightly opened and the auxiliary cylinder valves partially opened;\r\nwhilst the pressure in the apparatus is slowly increasing the remainder\r\nof the joints are tested and if found to be tight, the cylinder valves\r\nare fully opened and the control valve opened to the desired amount. In\r\nthe solution feed types the water required as solvent is turned on\r\nbefore the control valve is opened. Once the apparatus is working, no\r\nfurther attention is required, except for the regulation of the dosage\r\nin the manual control types, until the cylinders are replaced. When the\r\nstock of gas in the cylinders is almost depleted the pressure falls but\r\nit is always preferable to determine the stock by standing the cylinders\r\non a platform scale and weighing at regular intervals. This also\r\nprovides a check on the apparatus and can be utilised to check the\r\noperators.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of substances that impede the flow of gas is usually\r\nslow and is indicated by a gradual increase in the back pressure. The\r\norifice is calibrated at 25 pounds back pressure and any deviation from\r\nthis figure will show a discrepancy between the actual weight of\r\nchlorine evaporated and the amount calculated from the scale reading.\r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine is usually sent out by the manufacturers in steel\r\ncylinders which contain about 1.1 cubic feet of liquid or approximately\r\n100 pounds (1 cu. ft. = 89.75 pounds).[A]\r\n\r\n  [A] An effort is now being made to standardise cylinders of 150 lbs.\r\n      capacity.\r\n\r\nFor small installations only one cylinder is necessary but it is always\r\npreferable to connect more than one. When the flow of gas is rapid the\r\ntemperature of the liquid chlorine falls and reduces the pressure. The\r\neffect of the fall in temperature, due to the latent heat of\r\nevaporation, can be partially overcome by using a larger number of\r\ncylinders; in addition a source of external heat should be provided that\r\nwill maintain the temperature of the cylinders at a minimum of 80 deg. F.\r\nThis is a \"sine qua non\" for successful operation. The effect of the\r\ntemperature upon the pressure in the cylinders is shown in Diagram VII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM VII\r\n\r\nCHLORINE GAS PRESSURES AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES]\r\n\r\nIn practice it is found impossible to utilise all the gas contained in\r\nthe containers; when the cylinders are almost empty the pressure\r\nnecessary for the operation of the regulating device cannot be obtained\r\nand full cylinders must be attached. When sufficient heat is provided\r\nthe weight of chlorine in the cylinder can be reduced to 1 - 1-1/2\r\npounds before the tank pressure becomes too low.\r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine machines will operate, with ordinary care, for long\r\nperiods. The various parts are made of such metals as experience has\r\ndemonstrated to be best able to resist the corrosive action of the dry\r\ngas and the apparatus is designed to prevent the access of moisture\r\nwhich would otherwise produce corrosion and impede the flow of gas.\r\nStoppages are sometimes caused by brown deposits derived from\r\nimpurities in the liquid chlorine. These are primarily due to variations\r\nin the graphite electrodes used in the electrolytic process for the\r\nmanufacture of chlorine from salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Dunwoodie Chlorinating Plant Treating\r\n400,000,000 Gallons Per Day for New York City.]\r\n\r\nTo convey the dry gas from the apparatus to the point of application,\r\ncopper or iron pipes may be used; for aqueous solutions, flexible rubber\r\nhose must be employed. Chlorine water is exceedingly active, chemically,\r\nand rapidly attacks all the common metals; ordinary galvanised iron pipe\r\nis eroded in a few days and should never be used.\r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine, for water disinfection, possesses several marked\r\nadvantages over the ordinary bleach process.\r\n\r\n(1) The sterilising agent is practically 100 per cent pure, the only\r\nimpurities being traces of carbon dioxide and air, and does not\r\ndeteriorate on storage; it will, in fact, keep almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\n(2) Liquid chlorine practically eliminates all labour costs because of\r\nthe simplicity of the apparatus and the concentrated form of the\r\nsterilising agent. The apparatus is so compact that all the cylinders\r\nand regulating apparatus required for delivering 200 pounds of gas per\r\nday can be placed in an area of about 50 square feet and it can\r\nconsequently be almost invariably accommodated in locations where the\r\ntrifling amount of attention required can be obtained without extra\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n(3) The sludge problem, inseparable from bleach installations, is\r\neliminated.\r\n\r\n(4) Regulation of the dosage is simpler and consequently usually more\r\naccurate. The dosing apparatus in bleach plants invariably tends to\r\nchoke and demands regular attention from intelligent operators; a\r\nsimilar tendency in liquid chlorine machines is easily detected and\r\nelectrical devices can be installed to indicate automatically any\r\nchanges in the flow.\r\n\r\n(5) The first cost is smaller. The cost of liquid chlorine machines\r\nvaries from $400, for the small manual control types, to $1,200, for the\r\nautomatic control types. The capital outlay is mainly determined by the\r\nnumber of machines and accessories required and not, within certain\r\nlimits, by the capacity. One machine will deliver up to 200 pounds of\r\ngas per day, an amount sufficient to treat 60,000,000 U. S. A. gallons\r\n(50,000,000 Imp. gals.) at 0.40 p.p.m. of available chlorine. Unless\r\nduplicate machines are installed for the higher rates, the first cost is\r\ninversely proportional, though not directly so, to the volume of water\r\ntreated. It is in all cases less than the first cost of a bleach plant\r\nof equal capacity, accuracy, and durability.\r\n\r\n(6) Liquid chlorine installations usually tend to produce less\r\ncomplaints as to tastes and odours. This is probably due, not to any\r\nmerit of the chlorine _per se_, but to a more accurate regulation of the\r\ndosage and efficient distribution of the chlorine in the treated water.\r\nThe advantages ensuing from thorough admixture had only become partially\r\nappreciated before liquid chlorine machines were fully developed and\r\nthey have been more fully utilised in the design of these later\r\ninstallations.\r\n\r\nClaims have also been made that liquid chlorine prevents \"aftergrowths\"\r\nbut no evidence can be adduced in support of this statement.\r\nAftergrowths have occurred at many places where this process is employed\r\nand in this respect it possesses no advantage over hypochlorite\r\ninstallations.\r\n\r\nIt is also claimed that one pound of liquid chlorine is more efficient,\r\nas a germicide, than an equal weight of chlorine in the form of bleach.\r\nJackson[5] has stated that 1 pound of chlorine is equal to 9 pounds of\r\nbleach; Kienle (_loc. cit._) that it was equal to 8 pounds of bleach,\r\nwhilst Huy claimed to have obtained an efficiency ratio of 1:10 at\r\nNiagara Falls, N. Y. The conditions of the experiment were not\r\ncomparable however, in the last mentioned ratio. Catlett, at Wilmington,\r\nN. C. (West[4]) obtained a better bacterial reduction with 1 pound of\r\nliquid chlorine than with 6 pounds of bleach.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency ratio of chlorine to bleach has been reported upon by\r\nWest.[4] From 1910-1913 the mixed filter effluents of the Torresdale\r\nplant at Philadelphia were treated with bleach but in November, 1913 the\r\nliquid chlorine process was substituted. On comparing the results\r\nobtained during the same months of the two periods it was found that, in\r\ngeneral, 1 pound of liquid chlorine gave a slightly higher percentage\r\npurification than 6-7 pounds of bleach. Similar results were obtained at\r\nthe other Philadelphia plants. The figures published by West show that\r\nthe hypochlorite solutions used were abnormally strong (3.6-10.4 per\r\ncent of available chlorine), a condition that would increase the\r\ndifficulty of extracting all the soluble hypochlorite. It was found\r\nindeed, that, under the most advantageous conditions, only 87 per cent\r\nof the available chlorine was extracted. The average chlorine content of\r\nthe bleach used during 1912-1913 was 36.1 per cent but the figures given\r\nwould indicate that at least 1.5 per cent, a reduction of 4.6 per cent\r\nof the total, was lost during storage. It would seem not improbable that\r\nthe total loss under average conditions was not less than 20 per cent,\r\nwhich would reduce the efficiency ratio to 1:4.8-5.6.\r\n\r\nHale[6] also made a comparison of the relative efficiency of liquid\r\nchlorine and hypochlorite of lime at New York, and the earlier results\r\nagreed with West's ratio of 1:6-7. An investigation showed that large\r\nquantities of chlorine were not extracted from the bleach and when this\r\ncondition was rectified the total loss averaged only 4 per cent and the\r\nresults obtained were equal to those given by the liquid chlorine\r\nmachines. Hale's comparative figures are given in Table XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XXIII.--COMPARISON OF LIQUID CHLORINE WITH EFFICIENT USE OF\r\nBLEACH--(HALE)\r\n\r\n  ----------------+----------+-----------+------------+---------------\r\n    Treatment.    |  Water   | Number of |  Chlorine  |   Reduction\r\n                  | Treated. |  Samples. |   p.p.m.   |  of B. coli.\r\n  ----------------+----------+-----------+------------+---------------\r\n  Bleach          | Croton   |    84     | 0.27-0.36  |     93%\r\n  Liquid chlorine | Bronx    |    84     | 0.27-0.36  |     93%\r\n  ----------------+----------+-----------+------------+---------------\r\n\r\nHale concluded that, when efficiently used, the ratio of chlorine to\r\nbleach required to produce equal bacterial purification, approached 1:3.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by the author in Ottawa are similar to those of\r\nHale. During the earlier period of the bleach treatment a dosage of 1.5\r\np.p.m. of available chlorine was required to obtain satisfactory\r\npurification but various improvements that were subsequently made\r\nenabled the quantity to be reduced to 0.8 p.p.m. The same raw water\r\nusually requires 0.75 to 0.80 p.p.m. of liquid chlorine to obtain the\r\nsame purification. The total losses in the Ottawa bleach plant averaged\r\n6-8 per cent and based on these figures the efficiency ratio is\r\napproximately 1:3.5.\r\n\r\nRatios as low as 1:3.5 can only be obtained by the supervision of a\r\nchemist and this analytical control involves additional expense that\r\nmust be charged against the bleach process. No chemical analyses are\r\nnecessary for the control of liquid chlorine plants.\r\n\r\n_Disadvantages of Liquid Chlorine Plants._ The main objection to the use\r\nof liquid chlorine is that the slight leaks of gas occur occasionally\r\nand unless removed by forced ventilation may produce a concentration of\r\nchlorine that will injure the operators.\r\n\r\nPettenkofer and Lehmann[7] found that 0.001-0.005 per cent of chlorine\r\nin air affected the respiratory organs; 0.04-0.06 per cent produced\r\ndangerous symptoms, whilst concentrations exceeding 0.06 per cent\r\nrapidly proved fatal.\r\n\r\nThe danger of gas leakages can be eliminated by placing the apparatus in\r\na small separate room provided with a fan and a ventilation duct. By the\r\nliberal use of glass in the construction of the room, the operation of\r\nthe plant can be seen at all times without entering the chamber.\r\n\r\nA portion of the liquid chlorine apparatus is made of glass and is\r\nconsequently easily fractured. Duplicates of the glass parts should be\r\nkept in stock to prevent interrupting the supply of gas; a duplicate\r\nmachine is also advisable in large installations.\r\n\r\n_Cost of Treatment._ Prior to the outbreak of war in 1914, liquid\r\nchlorine sold at 10-11 cents per pound in small quantities and for 8-9\r\ncents per pound in large shipments. In 1917 the price was 18-20 cents\r\nper pound for small quantities and 15 cents upwards for large contracts.\r\nCanadian prices are 25 per cent higher.\r\n\r\nThe amount of chlorine required for satisfactory disinfection (see\r\nChapter III) depends upon the nature of the water and the cost of\r\ntreatment varies accordingly. In the majority of plants the cost varies\r\nfrom 25-90 cents per million gallons.\r\n\r\n_Popularity of Process._ Since 1913, when the first commercial liquid\r\nchlorine machines were used, the popularity of this process has\r\nincreased in a most remarkable manner. In 1913 over 1,700 million\r\ngallons per day were treated with hypochlorite; in 1915, 1,000 million\r\ngallons per day were treated with liquid chlorine and an approximately\r\nequal amount with hypochlorite; in January 1918, the amounts were 3,500\r\nmillion gallons per day (liquid chlorine) and 500 million gallons per\r\nday (hypochlorite).\r\n\r\nThis wonderful development has been largely due to the intrinsic merits\r\nof the process and the reliability of the machines manufactured although\r\nit has been indirectly assisted by the excessive cost of hypochlorite\r\nduring 1915-1916.\r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine machines are being used for the purification of water on\r\nthe Western Front of the European battlefield. The outfit is a mobile\r\none and consists of a rapid sand filter, liquid chlorine apparatus, a\r\nsmall storage tank and solution tanks. Owing to the limited contact\r\nperiod available a large dosage of chlorine is employed and the excess\r\nafterwards removed by the addition of a solution of sodium thiosulphate.\r\n\r\n_Chlorine Water._ Marshall[8] has proposed the use of chlorine water for\r\nthe sterilisation of water for troops. The solution is contained in\r\nampoules which are of two sizes, one for water carts and the other for\r\nwater bottles of one quart capacity.\r\n\r\nThe coefficient of solubility of chlorine, from 10 deg.-41 deg. C. is _C_ =\r\n3.0361 - 0.04196_t_ + 0.0001107_t_^{2}; when _t_ = 10 deg. C. 1 c.cm. of\r\nwater absorbs 2.58 c.cms. of chlorine or 8.2 m.gr., a quantity\r\nsufficient to give a concentration of 1 p.p.m. in 8 litres of water.\r\nMarshall has stated that, when pure materials are used, chlorine water\r\nis stable but the author is unable to confirm this. A saturated solution\r\nof chlorine in distilled water lost over 50 per cent of its available\r\nchlorine content when stored for five days in the dark at 70 deg. F. The\r\nchlorine present as hypochlorous acid increased slightly but the\r\nquantity never exceeded very small proportions. Chlorine solutions\r\ndecompose in accordance with the equation, Cl_{2} + H_{2}O = 2HCl + O.\r\n\r\nAlthough chlorine water appears to be of little value because of its\r\ninstability there appears to be no reason why chlorine hydrate should\r\nnot be successfully employed. The hydrate was first prepared by\r\nFaraday[9] by passing chlorine into water surrounded by a freezing\r\nmixture. A thick yellow magma resulted from which the crystals of\r\nchlorine hydrate were separated by pressing between filter paper at 0 deg.\r\nC. The hydrate prepared by Faraday was found to have the composition\r\nrepresented by the formula Cl.5H_{2}O but later investigators have shown\r\nthat more concentrated hydrates can be prepared. Roozeboom[10] prepared\r\na hydrate represented by the formula Cl.4H_{2}O and Forcrand[11] one\r\ncontaining only 3-1/2 molecules of water (Cl_{2}.7H_{2}O). Chlorine\r\nhydrate separates into chlorine gas and chlorine water at 9.6 deg. C. in\r\nopen vessels and at 28.7 deg. C. in closed vessels. Pedler[12] has shown\r\nthat when the ratio of Cl_{2}:H_{2}O is 1:64 or greater, the mixture of\r\nchlorine hydrate and water exhibits great stability and can be exposed\r\nto tropical sunlight for several months without decomposition.\r\n\r\nCl_{2}.64H_{2}O contains 5.8 per cent of chlorine and about 8. c.cms.\r\nwould be required to give a concentration of 1 p.p.m. in 110 Imp.\r\ngallons of water, the usual capacity of a military water cart.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n[1] Nesfield.

Two of these preparations were named Hermite fluid, and\r\nelectrozone (c.f. page 5). Sodium hypochlorite, made by passing chlorine\r\ninto solutions of caustic soda, or by the decomposition of bleach by\r\nsodium carbonate, has also been used and preparations of this character\r\nhave been sold under such names as Eau de Javelle, Labarraque solution,\r\nchloros, and chlorozone. These solutions contain mixtures of sodium\r\nhypochlorite and sodium chloride together with some free alkali.\r\nChlorozone was the name given by Count Dienheim-Brochoki to a number of\r\npreparations patented in 1876 and subsequently down to 1885. They were\r\nproduced by passing air and chlorine into solutions of caustic soda.\r\nLunge and Landolt[1] have shown that the air introduced is without\r\neffect and that the advantages claimed for chlorozone are illusory.\r\n\r\nThe earliest electrolytic installation on this continent was operated at\r\nBrewster, N. Y., in 1893 and since that date several plants have been\r\nerected where local conditions conduced to economical operation.\r\n\r\nWhen a uni-directional current of electricity is passed through a\r\nsolution of sodium chloride, the salt is dissociated and the components\r\nliberated, NaCl = Na + Cl. If the elements are not separated, the\r\nchlorine combines with the sodium hydrate, formed by the action of the\r\nsodium on the water, to form sodium hypochlorite. The equations 2Na +\r\n2H_{2}O = 2NaOH + H_{2}, and 2NaOH + Cl_{2} = NaOCl + NaCl + H_{2}O show\r\nthat only one-half of the chlorine produced is found as hypochlorite;\r\nthe other half reforming sodium chloride.\r\n\r\nSeveral types of electrolysers have been used for the production of\r\nhypochlorites and chlorine but only two are suitable for water-works\r\npurposes: in one, the cathodic and anodic products recombine in the main\r\nbody of the electrolyte; in the other, the diaphragm process, they are\r\nseparated as removed and the final products are chlorine gas and a\r\nsolution containing caustic soda and some undecomposed salt.\r\n\r\nUntil a few years ago the non-diaphragm process was the only one used\r\nfor water treatment and it will consequently be discussed first.\r\n\r\n_Non-diaphragm Process._ The theoretical voltage required for the\r\ndecomposition of sodium chloride is 2.3 but when the products recombine\r\nin the electrolyte, side reactions occur which increase the minimum\r\nvoltage to 3.54. On this basis one kilowatt hour gives 272 ampere hours\r\nand as one ampere hour is theoretically capable of producing 1.33 grams\r\nof chlorine, 1.21 kilowatt hours are necessary for the production of 1\r\npound of chlorine by the decomposition of 1.65 pounds of salt.\r\n\r\nCharles Watt (1851) discovered this process and was the first to\r\nrecognize the necessary conditions which are (1) insoluble electrodes,\r\n(2) low temperature of electrolyte, and (3) rapid circulation of\r\nelectrolyte from the cathode to the anode. The control of the\r\ntemperature is very important, for as it increases, side reactions occur\r\nwith the formation of chlorates, and the efficiency is decreased.\r\n\r\nThe non-diaphragm cells used in Europe (Haas and Oettel, Kellner,\r\nHermite, Vogelsand, and Mather and Platt) have been described by\r\nKershaw.[2] In the Haas and Oettel electrolyser the electrodes are\r\ncomposed of carbon but in the other types at least one electrode is made\r\nfrom platinum or a platinum alloy. The Dayton electrolyser, which is the\r\ncell most familiar in North America, is shown in Fig. 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Dayton Electrolytic Cell.]\r\n\r\nThe outer cell is made of soapstone and is approximately 2-1/2 feet long\r\nand 2 feet wide. The main electrodes consist of four pieces of Atcheson\r\ngraphite connected together by screws and metal strips to which is\r\nattached a clamp for connecting electrical terminals. Circulation of the\r\nbrine is produced by glass baffle plates and secondary electrodes placed\r\none inch apart between the main electrodes. The cell is intended to be\r\nused at 110-volts pressure but by wiring two cells in series a 220-volt\r\ncircuit may be employed. An inlet and outlet are provided at each end of\r\nthe tank to permit the direction of the flow to be periodically reversed\r\nfor the purpose of removing the lime deposit from the graphite plates.\r\n\r\nThe salt solution is prepared in wooden tanks from coarse clean salt\r\n(ground rock salt is unsuitable), containing as little iron as possible,\r\nin the proportion of 50 pounds to 100 gallons of water. After passing\r\nthrough a gravel or other suitable filter the brine solution is carried\r\nby brass pipes to the electrolyser. The rate of flow is adjusted to the\r\ntemperature of the hypochlorite solution leaving the cell but under\r\nnormal conditions it is stated that the cell described will pass 40\r\ngallons per hour with a consumption of 70 amperes and produce 2-1/2\r\npounds of chlorine per hour. This is equal to 8 pounds of salt and 3.08\r\nkilowatt hours per pound of chlorine. After the cells have been operated\r\nfor several months the efficiency usually falls and 10-11 pounds of salt\r\nand 3.5-3.7 kilowatt hours are required for the production of one pound\r\nof chlorine. The concentration of the hypochlorite solution is usually\r\nabout 6 grams per litre.\r\n\r\nRickard[3] stated that by cooling the Dayton cell with ice 1 pound of\r\nchlorine could be produced from 2.65 kilowatt hours and 6.9 pounds of\r\nsodium chloride; without cooling the figures were 3.62 kilowatt hours\r\nand 7.2 pounds of salt. Based on the figures that have been obtained\r\nfrom mature cells, the efficiency of the Dayton cell as compared with\r\nthose described by Kershaw is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n                    |        SALT.         |        POWER.\r\n                    |     PER POUND OF AVAILABLE CHLORINE.\r\n    Type of Cell.   +----------+-----------+----------+-----------\r\n                    |  Pounds. | Per Cent  | Kilowatt | Efficiency\r\n                    |          | Consumed. |  Hours.  | Per Cent.\r\n  ------------------+----------+-----------+----------+-----------\r\n  Haas and Oettel   |   10.7   |    15.4   |   3.8    |    31.9\r\n  Kellner           |    7.5   |    22.0   |   2.75   |    43.9\r\n  Hermite           |   11.2   |    14.5   |   2.87   |    42.2\r\n  Mather and Platt  |   ....   |    ....   |   2.75   |    43.9\r\n  Dayton            |   10.0   |    16.5   |   3.6    |    33.6\r\n  Theoretical       |    1.65  |   100.0   |   1.21   |   100.0\r\n  ------------------+----------+-----------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\nThe cost of production depends upon local conditions: if alternating\r\ncurrent is available at $30 per horse-power per annum, and low-grade\r\nsalt can be obtained for $5 per ton the cost of 1 pound of chlorine\r\nwould be\r\n\r\n\r\n  -----------------+----------------------------\r\n                   | COST (CENTS) PER POUND OF\r\n                   |    AVAILABLE CHLORINE.\r\n    Type of Cell.  +--------+----------+--------\r\n                   |  Salt. | Current. | Total.\r\n  -----------------+--------+----------+--------\r\n  Haas and Oettel  |  2.67  |   1.97   |  4.64\r\n  Kellner          |  1.87  |   1.43   |  3.30\r\n  Hermite          |  2.80  |   1.49   |  4.29\r\n  Dayton           |  2.50  |   1.92   |  4.42\r\n  -----------------+--------+----------+--------\r\n\r\nThe electrical and chemical efficiencies of the Haas and Oettel and\r\nDayton cells, which contain carbon electrodes, are smaller than those\r\ncontaining platinum electrodes but for water sterilisation the carbon\r\ncells have been found to be more suitable. To prevent the action of\r\nmagnesium salts on the platinum electrodes it is necessary to use a\r\nhigher grade of salt or to provide means of purification. Because of the\r\nabsence of a base and the presence of chlorides, electrolytic\r\nhypochlorite cannot be stored for more than a few hours without\r\nappreciable loss of titre. Unless used for the treatment of the effluent\r\nof a filter plant operated at a fairly constant rate a small storage\r\ntank is necessary to compensate for the irregular demand and to provide\r\nthe head required by orifice feed boxes. Small variations can be made by\r\nregulating the flow through the cells but large ones are not compatible\r\nwith efficiency, which is the highest under a constant load.\r\n\r\nClaims have been made that electrolytic hypochlorite is more efficient\r\nas a germicide than bleach when compared on the basis of their available\r\nchlorine content but no evidence of it has been produced. Bleach\r\ncontains an excess of base, which retards the germicidal action, and\r\nelectrolytic hypochlorite contains an excess of sodium chloride, which\r\naccelerates it (Race[4]) but the ultimate effect is the same with both.\r\nThis is shown in Table XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XXIV.[A]--COMPARISON OF BLEACH WITH ELECTROLYTIC HYPOCHLORITE\r\n\r\n  ----------------+-------------------++-------------------\r\n                  |   BLEACH.         ||  ELECTROLYTIC\r\n                  |                   ||  HYPOCHLORITE.\r\n                  +-------------------++-------------------\r\n  Contact Period. | Available Chlorine.

The instability of the liquor and cell troubles have also\r\nprevented the process being generally utilised. Baltimore and Cincinnati\r\nexperimented with this method but did not adopt it. Winslow[6] has\r\nreported that, owing to the difficulty in obtaining bleach since the\r\noutbreak of war, Petrograd has used electrolytic hypochlorite made from\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n_Diaphragm Process._ The various types of diaphragm cells that have been\r\ncommercially operated are of two varieties: (1) cells with submerged\r\ndiaphragms and (2) cells in which the electrolyte comes in contact with\r\none face only of an unsubmerged diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe Le Sueur, Gibbs, Crocker, Billiter-Siemens, Nelson, and\r\nHargreaves-Bird cells are of the submerged diaphragm variety. The Nelson\r\ncell has been operated for some time at the filtration plant at Little\r\nFalls, N. J. The cells are fed with brine solution previously purified\r\nby the addition of soda ash and have given fairly successful results\r\nalthough the cost of maintenance is comparatively high. Tolman[7] has\r\nreported that several towns in West Virginia use a bleach solution\r\nprepared by absorbing chlorine, manufactured by the Hargreaves-Bird\r\nprocess, in lime water; the solution contains about 1.95 per cent of\r\navailable chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragms in both the submerged and unsubmerged types are usually\r\nconstructed either with asbestos paper or cloth, placed in such a manner\r\nas to divide the cells into two separate compartments: the anodic, into\r\nwhich the brine is fed and where the chlorine is produced; and the\r\ncathodic, where caustic soda is formed.\r\n\r\nBy maintaining the liquor in the anodic compartment at a higher\r\nelevation than in the cathodic one, the direction of flow is towards the\r\nlatter, but owing to osmosis and diffusion the separation is not\r\ncomplete and a portion of the caustic soda passes the diaphragm and\r\nproduces hypochlorite with a consequent loss of efficiency and rapid\r\ndeterioration of the anodes. With the exception of the Billiter-Siemens\r\ncell, the submerged diaphragm cells operate at not more than 85 per cent\r\nefficiency and the cost of maintenance is usually high.\r\n\r\nIn the non-submerged diaphragm types the invasion of the anodic\r\ncompartment by caustic is much reduced and the efficiency and life\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAn electrolyser of the non-submerged diaphragm type is the Allen-Moore\r\ncell which has been adopted by the Montreal Water and Power Co. This\r\nhas been described by Pitcher and Meadows.[8] The general lay-out of the\r\ninstallation is shown in Fig. 10, and the essential features are: a salt\r\nstorage bin having a capacity of 40 tons; the brine saturating and\r\npurifying apparatus; duplicate 15 horse-power motor-generator sets; four\r\nchlorine cells; and the silver ejectors and distributing lines for\r\ncarrying the chlorine solution to the point of application.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10--Brine Saturating and Purifying Equipment.]\r\n\r\nThe brine solution, which is prepared by passing water through the\r\nsaturators previously filled with salt, is delivered to the two concrete\r\nreaction tanks where an amount of soda ash and caustic liquor sufficient\r\nto combine with the calcium and magnesium salts is added, and the\r\nmixture filtered through sand and stored in the purified brine tanks. To\r\nprevent the formation of hypochlorites by the interaction of chlorine\r\nand alkali, the alkalinity of the liquor is determined and sufficient\r\nhydrochloric acid added to ensure an acidity of 0.01 per cent. The acid\r\nbrine is delivered at one end of the four cells (Fig. 11) each of which\r\nis 7 feet long and 20-3/8 inches wide and consumes 600 amperes at 3.3\r\nvolts. The cell box is built of concrete and is provided with a\r\nperforated wrought iron cathode box and graphite anode plates which are\r\nseparated by an unsubmerged asbestos paper diaphragm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Sections of Allen-Moore Cell.]\r\n\r\nEach cell has a capacity of 32 pounds of chlorine per day and the gas\r\nflow is determined by measuring the volume of caustic soda produced in a\r\ngiven period of time and calculating the weight from the volume and\r\nconcentration as determined by titration with standard acid; each gram\r\nof NaOH is equal to 0.88 gram of chlorine. The efficiency of the cell is\r\nobtained by dividing the number of grams of chlorine produced per hour\r\nby the product of the current volume (in amperes) and the factor 1.33,\r\nthe theoretical production of chlorine for one ampere hour. The average\r\nefficiency of the Montreal cells was found to be 93 per cent. The\r\ninstallation comprises four cells, one being held in reserve, and the\r\nannual cost of producing 90 pounds of chlorine per day is given as\r\n$2,500. The details are:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Salt at $8.00 per ton, delivered         $500.00\r\n  Power, 15 H.P., at $30.00 flat rate       450.00\r\n  Labour and superintendence                500.00\r\n  Interest at 6 per cent on capital cost    300.00\r\n  Depreciation, 15 per cent                 750.00\r\n                                         ---------\r\n                                         $2,500.00\r\n\r\ncost per pound of chlorine = 7.6 cents.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm cells, like the non-diaphragm ones, operate most\r\nefficiently under a constant load; they are consequently suitable for\r\ntreating the effluent of filter plants.\r\n\r\nWhere very cheap electrical power can be obtained, the cost per pound of\r\navailable chlorine is less for the electrolytic method just described\r\nthan for liquid chlorine or chlorine obtained from bleach; but this\r\ncondition obtains in very few places. Mr. J. A. Meadows has suggested to\r\nthe author that the cost could be reduced by converting the chlorine gas\r\ninto hypochlorite and then adding dilute ammonia as in the chloramine\r\nprocess (_vide_ page 115). The caustic liquor, usually run to waste from\r\nthe cathodic compartment, could be delivered into a feed box from which\r\nit would be drawn off by the water injector used for dissolving the\r\nchlorine gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n[1] Lunge and Landolt.

Chloramine was prepared by cooling dilute solutions\r\nof bleach and ammonia and adding the latter to the former contained in a\r\nflask surrounded by a freezing mixture. The proportions were as the\r\nequivalent weights of anhydrous ammonia and available chlorine\r\n(approximately two parts by weight of chlorine to one part by weight of\r\nammonia). After gas evolution had ceased the mixture was saturated with\r\nzinc chloride and the magma distilled under reduced pressure. The\r\ndistillate was a dilute solution of comparatively pure chloramine.\r\n\r\nThe first to notice the effect of ammonia on the germicidal value of\r\nhypochlorites was S. Rideal[2] who noted that during the chlorination of\r\nsewage, the first rapid consumption of chlorine was succeeded by a\r\nslower action which continued for days in some instances, and was\r\naccompanied by a germicidal action after free chlorine or hypochlorite\r\nhad disappeared. Rideal stated that: \"It became evident that chlorine,\r\nin supplement to its oxidising action, which had been exhausted, was\r\nacting by substitution for hydrogen in ammonia and organic compounds,\r\nyielding products more or less germicidal.\" On investigating the effect\r\nof ammonia on hypochlorite it was found that the addition of an\r\nequivalent of ammonia to electrolytic hypochlorite increased the\r\ncarbolic acid coefficient of 2.18, for one per cent available chlorine,\r\nto 6.36 (nearly three times the value). Further experimental work showed\r\nthat the increase was due to the formation of chloramine.\r\n\r\nThe author, in 1915, during a series of experiments on the relative\r\ngermicidal action of hypochlorites, attempted to prepare the ammonium\r\nsalt by double decomposition of bleach and ammonium oxalate solutions.\r\n\r\n  Ca(OCl)_{2} + (NH_{4})_{2}C_{2}O_{4} = CaC_{2}O_{4} + 2NH_{4}OCl.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of the germicidal action of the solution was found to be\r\nabout ten times greater than the germicidal velocities of other\r\nhypochlorites of equal concentrations, (Race[3]), and from a\r\nconsideration of the chemical formula of ammonium hypochlorite it\r\nappeared probable that it would be very unstable and decompose into\r\nchloramine, which Rideal had previously shown to have an abnormal\r\ngermicidal action, and water. NH_{4}OCl = NH_{2}CL + H_{2}O. After these\r\nresults have been confirmed, the effect of adding ammonia to bleach\r\nsolution was tried and it was found that 0.20 p.p.m. of available\r\nchlorine and 0.10 p.p.m. of ammonia produced equally good results as\r\n0.60 p.p.m. of chlorine only. Similar results were obtained on the\r\naddition of ammonia to electrolytic hypochlorite.\r\n\r\nExperiments made with a view to determining the most efficient ratios of\r\nammonia gave very surprising results: chlorine to ammonia ratios (by\r\nweight) between 8:1 and 1:2 gave approximately the same germicidal\r\nvelocity.[3] The action of the ammonia on the oxidising power of bleach,\r\nas measured by the indigo test, was also found to be disproportionate to\r\nthe amount added.\r\n\r\nThe oxidising action of various mixtures of bleach and ammonia as\r\nmeasured by the rate of absorption of the available by the organic\r\nmatter in the Ottawa River water is shown in Table XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XXV.--RATE OF ABSORPTION OF AVAILABLE CHLORINE\r\n\r\n  --------------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n  Ratio Chlorine / Ammonia  | PERCENTAGE OF ORIGINAL FOUND AFTER\r\n         by Weight.         +-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n                            | 10 Mins.  | 4 Hours.  | 20 Hours.\r\n  --------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Infinity (ammonia absent) |   66.8    |    40.0   |    25.1\r\n    8:1                     |   83.2    |    77.8   |    67.3\r\n    4:1                     |   97.2    |    94.7   |    88.5\r\n  2.7:1                     |   98.3    |    96.5   |    92.8\r\n    2:1                     |   99.8    |    98.2   |    96.2\r\n  --------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nThe 8:1 ratio caused a marked reduction in the rate of absorption of the\r\nchlorine whilst a 4:1 ratio was almost as active as the ratios\r\ncontaining more ammonia.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the abnormal results were obtained with ammonium\r\nhypochlorite and mixtures of bleach and ammonia, the phenomenon appeared\r\nto be of scientific interest only and especially so as Rideal had\r\nattributed the obnoxious tastes and odours, sometimes produced by\r\nchlorination, to the formation of chloramines. During the winter of\r\n1915-1916 the price of bleach, however, advanced to extraordinary\r\nheights and the author then determined to try out the process on a\r\npractical scale for the purification of water. A subsidiary plant\r\npumping about 200,000 Imperial gallons per day (240,000 U. S. A.\r\ngallons) was found to be available for this purpose and the chloramine\r\nprocess was substituted for the bleach method previously in operation.\r\nThe process was commenced by the addition of pure ammonia fort, in the\r\namount required to give a chlorine to ammonia ratio of 2:1, to the\r\nbleach solutions in the barrels. The results were not in accordance with\r\nthose obtained in the laboratory and it was found that the samples of\r\nbleach solutions received for analysis were far below the strength\r\ncalculated from the amount of dry bleach used. This experience was\r\nrepeated on subsequent days and the deficiency was found to increase on\r\nincreasing the ammonia dosage. Solutions of similar concentration were\r\nthen used in the laboratory with similar losses, and it was observed\r\nthat on the addition of ammonia a copious evolution of gas occurred. An\r\ninvestigation showed that the ammonia and bleach must be mixed as dilute\r\nsolutions and prolonged contact avoided (_vide_ p. 127). Alterations\r\nwere accordingly made in the plant and the bleach and ammonia were\r\nprepared as dilute solutions in separate vessels and allowed to mix for\r\nonly a few seconds before delivery to the suction of the pumps. This\r\nmethod of application was instantaneously successful and results equal\r\nto those obtained in the laboratory were at once secured. The dosage was\r\nreduced until the bacteriological results were adversely affected and\r\ncontinued at values slightly in excess of this figure (0.15 p.p.m.) for\r\na short period to prove that the process was reliable.\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of the work of Raschig and Rideal, it appeared that\r\nthe most efficient proportions of available chlorine and ammonia would\r\nbe two parts by weight of the former to one part of the latter and this\r\nratio was maintained during the run on the experimental plant. Lower\r\nratios of chlorine to ammonia were contra-indicated by the laboratory\r\nexperiments, which showed that the efficiency was not increased thereby\r\nwhilst higher ratios were left for future consideration.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained on the experimental plant, together with those\r\nobtained on the main plant, where 24 million gallons per day were\r\ntreated with bleach only, are given in Tables XXVI, XXVII and XXVIII.\r\nThe two periods given represent the spring flood condition and that\r\nimmediately preceding it; these are respectively the worst and best\r\nwater periods.

Be.), containing\r\napproximately 29 per cent of anhydrous ammonia, was used. The material\r\nwas first examined by the presence of such noxious substance as cyanides\r\nand found to be very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Sketch of Ottawa Chloramine Plant.]\r\n\r\nThe general design of the plant is shown in Fig. 12. The bleach is mixed\r\nin tank _A_ as a solution containing 0.3 to 0.6 per cent of available\r\nchlorine and delivered to tanks _B_ and _D_, each of which has a\r\ntwenty-four-hour storage capacity. The ammonia solution is mixed and\r\nstored in tank _B_ and contains 0.3-0.5 per cent of anhydrous ammonia.\r\nThe two solutions are run off into boxes _E_ and _F_ which maintain a\r\nconstant head on valves _V_ and _V'_ controlling the head on the\r\norifices. Both orifices discharge into a common feed box _G_ from which\r\nthe mixture is carried by the water injector _J_ through one of\r\nduplicate feed pipes and discharged into the suction well through a\r\nperforated pipe.\r\n\r\nAs tank _B_ was previously used as a bleach storage tank, the change\r\nfrom hypochlorite alone to chloramine necessitated very little expense.\r\n\r\nThe treatment was commenced by gradually increasing the quantity of\r\nammonia, until a dosage of 0.12 p.p.m. was reached, and constantly\r\nincreasing the dosage of bleach, which was formerly 0.93 p.p.m. of\r\navailable chlorine. Owing to the restrictions imposed by the Provincial\r\nauthorities it has not been possible to maintain a dosage as low as that\r\nindicated as sufficient by the experimental plants results, but some\r\ninteresting data have been obtained. Table XXIX shows the results\r\nobtained from February to October, 1917, from the chloramine treatment\r\nat Ottawa and also those obtained with liquid chlorine at Hull where the\r\nsame raw water is treated with 0.7-0.8 p.p.m. of chlorine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XXIX.--CHLORAMINE RESULTS AT OTTAWA\r\n\r\n  ---------+--------------+----------+--------+------------------+-------\r\n           |  _B. coli_   |          |        |                  |  Hull\r\n           |PER 100 C.CMS.|          |        |  DOSAGE P.P.M.   |_B. coli_\r\n    1917   +------+-------+Turbidity.| Colour.+---------+--------+Per 100\r\n           | Raw  |  Tap  |          |        |         |        |c.cms.\r\n           |Water.| Water.|          |        |Chlorine.|Ammonia.|\r\n  ---------+------+-------+----------+--------+---------+--------+-------\r\n  Feb.     |  268 |  0.88 |     3    |   40   |   0.57  |  0.05  | ....\r\n  Mar. 1-18|  250 |  0.96 |     4    |   40   |   0.32  |  0.11  | ....\r\n  Mar. 1-31|  643 |  0.43 |     4    |   40   |   0.47  |  0.14  | ....\r\n  April    | 5228 |  0.34 |    31    |   32   |   0.56  |  0.10  | ....\r\n  May      |  162 | <0.08 |     3    |   39   |   0.52  |  0.08  | ....\r\n  June     |  114 | <0.08 |     3    |   41   |   0.51  |  0.08  | ....\r\n  July     |  237 |  0.08 |     5    |   41   |   0.51  |  0.08  | 44.4\r\n  Aug.     |  165 |  0.08 |     4    |   42   |   0.51  |  0.10  | 28.0\r\n  Sept.    |   55 | <0.08 |     6    |   42   |   0.50  |  0.09  | 15.2\r\n  Oct.     |   31 |  0.15 |     5    |   42   |   0.42  |  0.08  |  1.1\r\n  ---------+------+-------+----------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n  Average  |  211 |  0.22 |     7    |   40   |   0.51  |  0.09  |\r\n  ---------+------+-------+----------+--------+---------+--------+-------\r\n\r\nAt the height of the spring floods the raw water contained 80 p.p.m. of\r\nturbidity and over 500 _B. coli_ per c.cm. but 0.6 p.p.m. of chlorine\r\nand 0.13 p.p.m. of ammonia reduced the _B. coli_ index in the tap\r\nsamples to 2.5 per 100 c.cms.; samples taken in Hull on the same day\r\n(treated with 0.7-0.8 p.p.m. of liquid chlorine) gave a _B. coli_ index\r\nof 26.7. Previous experiences in Ottawa has shown that a dosage of\r\napproximately 1.5 p.p.m. of available chlorine is required to reduce the\r\n_B. coli_ index to 2.0 per 100 c.cms. under similar physical and\r\nbacteriological conditions.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of nine months covered by the results in Table XXIX,\r\nonly five cases of typhoid fever were reported in which the evidence did\r\nnot clearly indicate that the infection had occurred outside the city.\r\nThe reduction in the bleach consumed during the same period effected a\r\nsaving of $3,200.\r\n\r\nDuring one period of operation the hypochlorite dosage was gradually\r\nreduced to ascertain what factor of safety was maintained with a dosage\r\nof 0.5 p.p.m. of available chlorine and 0.06-0.08 p.p.m. of ammonia. The\r\nresults are shown in Diagram VIII. The percentage of samples of treated\r\nwater showing _B. coli_ in 50 c.cms. was calculated from the results of\r\nthe examination of 4-7 samples daily.\r\n\r\nThe results showed that it was possible to reduce the chlorine dosage to\r\n0.25 p.p.m. with 0.06 p.p.m. of ammonia without adversely affecting the\r\nbacteriological purity of the tap supply and fully confirmed the\r\nexperimental results previously obtained.\r\n\r\nThe lowest ratio of available chlorine to ammonia used during this test\r\nwas approximately 4:1. This is the ratio indicated by a consideration of\r\nthe theory of the reaction, and not 2:1 as was formerly stated\r\n(Race[4]). If bleach is represented as Ca(OCl)_{2}, the equation\r\n\r\n  Ca(OCl)_{2} + 2NH_{3} = 2NH_{2}Cl + Ca(OH)_{2}\r\n\r\nwould indicate a ratio of 2:1; but only one molecule of Ca(OCl)_{2} is\r\nproduced from two molecules of bleach and the theoretical ratio is\r\ntherefore 4:1 (142:34),\r\n\r\n  2CaOCl_{2} = CaCl_{2} + Ca(OCl)_{2} and Ca(OCl)_{2} + 2NH_{3} =\r\n   Cl = 142                                              34\r\n                                               = 2NH_{2}Cl + Ca(OH)_{2}.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine to ammonia ratio is very important because of its influence\r\non the economics of the process (_vide_ p. 124).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM VIII\r\n\r\nCHLORAMINE TREATMENT, OTTAWA]\r\n\r\nAll the laboratory and works results that have been obtained in Ottawa\r\nindicate the importance of an adequate contact period. The superiority\r\nof chloramine over other processes is due to the non-absorption of the\r\ngermicidal agent and to obtain the same degree of efficiency the contact\r\nperiod must be increased as the concentration is decreased. For this\r\nreason the best results will be obtained by chlorinating at the entrance\r\nto reservoirs or under other conditions that will ensure several hours\r\ncontact. At Ottawa the capacity of the pipes connecting the pumping\r\nstation (point of chlorination) and the distribution mains provides a\r\ncontact period of one and a quarter hours but even better results would\r\nbe obtained if the contact period were increased.\r\n\r\nThe general results obtained during the use of chloramine at Ottawa in\r\n1917 have shown that the aftergrowths noted during the use of\r\nhypochlorite (see p. 56) have been entirely eliminated and that the _B.\r\ncoli_ content of the tap samples from outlying districts has been\r\ninvariably less than that of samples taken from taps near to the point\r\nof application of the chloramine. At Denver, Col., where the chloramine\r\nprocess has also been used, similar results were obtained[5]: four days\r\nafter the initiation of the chloramine treatment the aftergrowth count\r\non gelatine of the Capitol Hill reservoir dropped from 15,000 to 10 per\r\nc.cm. The hypochlorite dosage was cut from 0.26-0.13 p.p.m. of available\r\nchlorine and 0.065 p.p.m. of ammonia added.\r\n\r\n_Economics of the Chloramine Process._ The chloramine process was\r\nintroduced at Ottawa for the purpose of obtaining relief from the effect\r\nof the high price of bleach caused by the cessation of imports from\r\nEurope in 1915. The results obtained with the experimental plant\r\nindicated that, calculated on the prices current at the beginning of\r\n1917, appreciable economies could be made. Although the reduction in the\r\nchlorine dosage has not been as great as was anticipated, due to the\r\nrestrictions previously mentioned, the cost of sterilising chemicals in\r\n1917 was $3,200 less than the cost of straight hypochlorite treatment.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of 1917 the relative cost of bleach and ammonia\r\nchanged (see Diagram IX).\r\n\r\nWhen calculated on the New York prices for January, 1918, the cost of\r\nchloramine treatment in the United States would be greater than\r\nhypochlorite alone unless a large reduction in the dosage could be\r\nsecured by very long contact periods. This condition is only temporary,\r\nhowever, and the price of ammonia will probably gradually decline as\r\nthe plants for fixation of atmospheric nitrogen commence operations and\r\nreduce the demand for the ammonia produced from ammoniacal gas liquor.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the market conditions are still (1918) favourable to the\r\nchloramine process: bleach is 25 per cent higher than the U.S.A. product\r\nand ammonia can be obtained for one-half the New York prices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM IX\r\n\r\nBLEACH AND AMMONIA PRICES]\r\n\r\n_Advantages of the Chloramine Process._ Although the market conditions\r\nmay, in some instances, be unfavourable to the chloramine process, the\r\nmethod possesses certain advantages that more than offset a slight\r\npossible increase in the cost of materials. The taste and odour of\r\nchloramine is even more pungent than that of chlorine but since the\r\nintroduction of the process in Ottawa no complaints have been received.\r\nOwing to the reduced dosage, slight proportional fluctuations in the\r\ndosage do not produce the same variations in the amount of free chlorine\r\nwhich is the usual cause of complaints. A public announcement that the\r\namount of hypochlorite has been reduced also has a psychological\r\neffect upon the consumers and tends to reduce complaints due to\r\nauto-suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe most important advantage of the process is the elimination of the\r\naftergrowth problem. At Denver, where the aftergrowth trouble is\r\npossibly more acute than at any other city on the continent, it was\r\neffectively banished by the use of chloramine. At Ottawa, the sanitary\r\nsignificance of _B. coli_ aftergrowths is no longer of practical\r\ninterest because such aftergrowths have ceased to occur. Whatever may be\r\ntheir opinion as to the sanitary significance of aftergrowths, all water\r\nsanitarians will agree that the better policy is to prevent their\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n_Operation of Chloramine Process._ For the successful operation of the\r\nchloramine process, the essential factors are low concentrations of the\r\nhypochlorite and ammonia solutions. The author has found that\r\nhypochlorite containing 0.3-0.5 per cent of available chlorine and\r\nammonia containing 0.3-0.5 per cent of anhydrous ammonia can be mixed in\r\na 4:1 or 8:1 ratio without appreciable loss in titre. Solutions of these\r\nconcentrations mixed in 4:1 ratio lost only 2-3 per cent of available\r\nchlorine in fifteen minutes and less than 10 per cent in five hours. The\r\neffect of mixing solutions containing 4.35 per cent of available\r\nchlorine and 2.2 per cent of ammonia is shown in Table XXX.\r\n\r\nThe stability of chloramine is a function of the concentration and the\r\ntemperature and in practice it will be found advisable to determine in\r\nthe laboratory the maximum concentrations that can be used at the\r\nmaximum temperature attained by the water to be treated (cf. Muspratt\r\nand Smith[6]).\r\n\r\nAccording to Raschig[1] two competing reactions occur when ammonia is in\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\n      (1) NH_{2}Cl + NH_{3} = N_{2}H_{4}HCl hydrazine hydrochloride\r\n  and (2) 3NH_{2}Cl + 2NH_{3} = N_{2} + 3NH_{4}Cl.\r\n\r\nWhen the excess of ammonia is large, as on the addition of ammonia fort,\r\nthe second reaction predominates and the yield of nitrogen gas is almost\r\nquantitatively proportional to the quantity of available chlorine\r\npresent. As ammonium chloride has no germicidal action, and hydrazine a\r\ncarbolic coefficient of only 0.24 (Rideal), the formation of these\r\ncompounds should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XXX.--LOSS ON MIXING HYPOCHLORITE AND AMMONIA\r\n\r\nHypochlorite containing 4.35 per cent available chlorine.

Routine\r\ndeterminations of the latter made in Ottawa show that practically the\r\nwhole (90-95 per cent) of the added ammonia can be recovered by\r\ndistillation with alkaline permanganate and that 85-90 per cent is in\r\nthe \"free\" condition.\r\n\r\nIn operating the chloramine process it is important that the pipes used\r\nfor conveying the chloramine solution should be of ample dimensions and\r\nprovided with facilities for blowing out the lime that deposits from the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n  Ca(OCl)_{2} + 2NH_{3} = 2NH_{2}Cl + Ca(OH)_{2}.\r\n\r\nThe marked activity of chloramine as a chlorinating agent could be\r\npredicated from its heat of formation, which is 8,230 calories. The\r\nother possible chloramines should be even more active as the heat of\r\nformation of these compounds are:\r\n\r\n  Dichloramine          NHCl_{2} -- 36,780 calories.\r\n  Nitrogen trichloride  NCl_{3}  -- 65,330 calories.\r\n\r\nDichloramine is unknown but nitrogen chloride has been prepared and is a\r\nhighly explosive yellow oil that decomposes slowly when kept under water\r\nin the ice box. NCl_{3} can be easily prepared by passing chlorine gas\r\ninto a solution of ammonium chloride and this process would suggest that\r\na method might be found of utilising chlorine and ammonia as gases for\r\nthe production of nitrogen trichloride as a germicide for water\r\nchlorination. NH_{4}Cl + 3Cl_{2} = NCl_{3} + 4HCl.\r\n\r\nThe \"available\" chlorine content of the chloramines is double the actual\r\nchlorine content as each atom of chlorine will liberate two atoms of\r\niodine from hydriodic acid.\r\n\r\n  NH_{2}Cl + 2HI = I_{2} + NH_{4}Cl.\r\n\r\n  NCl_{3} + 6HI  = 3I_{2} + NH_{4}Cl + 2HCl.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALAZONE\r\n\r\nFor the sterilisation of small individual quantities of water such as\r\nare required by cavalry and other mobile troops bleach and acid sulphate\r\ntablets have been usually employed. Such tablets have given fairly\r\nsatisfactory results but certain difficulties inherent to these\r\nchemicals have made it desirable to seek other methods.\r\n\r\nThe subject was investigated by Dakin and Dunham,[7] who first tried\r\nchloramine-T (sodium toluene-_p_-sulphochloramide). It was found that\r\nheavily contaminated waters, and particularly those containing much\r\ncarbonates, required a comparatively high concentration of the\r\ndisinfectant: 40 parts per million of chloramine-T were necessary in\r\nsome cases and such an amount was distinctly unpalatable. By adding\r\ntartaric acid or citric acid the effective concentration could be\r\nreduced to 4 p.p.m. but the mixture could not be made into a tablet\r\nwithout decomposition and a two-tablet system was deemed undesirable.\r\n\r\nToluene sulphodichloramines were next tried. Excellent bacteriological\r\nresults were obtained but the manufacture of tablets again presented\r\ndifficulties. When the necessary quantity of dichloramine was mixed with\r\nwhat were assumed to be inert salts--sodium chloride for example--the\r\nnormal slow rate of decomposition was accelerated. The dichloramine, in\r\ntablet form, was also found to be too insoluble to effect prompt\r\nsterilisation.\r\n\r\nThe most suitable substance found by Dakin and Dunham was \"halazone\" or\r\n_p_-sulphodichloraminobenzoic acid (Cl_{2}N.O_{2}S.C_{6}H_{4}.COOH).\r\nThis compound is easily prepared from cheap readily available materials\r\nand was found to be effective and reasonably stable.\r\n\r\nThe starting point in the preparation of halazone is\r\n_p_-toluenesulphonic chloride, a cheap waste product in the manufacture\r\nof saccharine. By the action of ammonia, _p_-toluene sulphonamide is\r\nproduced and is subsequently oxidised by bichromate and sulphuric acid\r\nto _p_-sulphonamidobenzoic acid. This acid, on chlorination at low\r\ntemperatures, yields _p_-sulphondichloraminobenzoic acid (halazone). The\r\nreactions may be expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n   CH_{3}              COOH                COOH\r\n  / \\                 / \\                 / \\\r\n  | |           -->   | |           -->   | |\r\n  \\ /                 \\ /                 \\ /\r\n   SO_{2}.NH_{3}       SO_{2}.NH_{2}       SO_{2}.NCl_{2}\r\n\r\nHalazone is a white crystalline solid, sparingly soluble in water and\r\nchloroform, and insoluble in petroleum. It readily dissolves in glacial\r\nacetic acid from which it crystallizes in prisms (M.P. 213 deg. C.).\r\n\r\nThe purity of the compound can be ascertained by dissolving in glacial\r\nacetic acid, adding potassium iodide, and titrating with thiosulphate;\r\n0.1 gram should require 14.8 to 14.9 c.cms. of N/10 sodium thiosulphate.\r\nEach chlorine atom in halazone is equivalent to 1 molecule of\r\nhypochlorous acid and the \"available\" chlorine content is consequently\r\n52.5 per cent or double the actual chlorine content.\r\n\r\n  >SO_{2}.NCl_{2} + 4HI = >SO_{2}.NH_{2} + 2HCl + 2I_{2}.\r\n\r\nFrom the bacteriological results given by Dakin and Dunham it would\r\nappear that 3 parts per million of halazone (1.5 p.p.m. available\r\nchlorine) are sufficient to sterilise heavily polluted waters in thirty\r\nminutes and that this concentration can be relied upon to remove\r\npathogenic organisms.\r\n\r\nThe formula recommended for the preparation of tablets is halazone 4 per\r\ncent, sodium carbonate, 4 per cent (or dried borax 8 per cent), and\r\nsodium chloride (pure) 92 per cent.\r\n\r\nHalazone and halazone tablets, when tested in the author's laboratory on\r\nthe coloured Ottawa River water seeded with _B. coli_, have given rather\r\ninferior results. With 1 tablet per quart, over six hours were required\r\nto reduce a _B. coli_ content of 100 per 10 c.cms. to less than 1 per 10\r\nc.cms. Clear well waters gave excellent results and large numbers of _B.\r\ncoli_ were reduced to less than 1 per 10 c.cms. in less than thirty\r\nminutes. McCrady[A] has also obtained excellent results with various\r\nstrains of _B. coli_ seeded into the colourless St. Lawrence water.\r\n\r\n  [A] Private communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n[1] Raschig.

In a\r\nfew instances some collateral advantages are also obtained but, in\r\ngeneral, no other object is aimed at or secured.\r\n\r\nChlorination does not change the physical appearance of water; it does\r\nnot reduce or increase the turbidity nor does it decrease the colour in\r\nan appreciable degree.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition is also practically unaltered. When bleach is\r\nused there is a proportionate increase in the hardness but the amount is\r\nusually trifling and is without significance. During 1916 when the\r\nOttawa supply was entirely treated with bleach at the rate of 2.7 parts\r\nper million (0.92 p.p.m. of available chlorine) the average increase in\r\nthe total hardness as determined by the soap method was 2.5 parts per\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\nWhen chlorine is added to prefiltered water, as an adjunct to\r\nfiltration, an increase in the number of gallons filtered per run has\r\nbeen noted at some plants. This increase is not so great with rapid as\r\nwith slow sand filters but in some instances it has led to appreciable\r\neconomies.\r\n\r\nWalden and Powell[1] of Baltimore, found that the addition of a quantity\r\nof bleach equal to approximately 0.50 p.p.m. of available chlorine\r\nenabled the alum to be reduced from 0.87 to 0.58 grain per gallon. The\r\npercentage of water used in washing the filters was also reduced, from\r\n4.1 per cent to 2.9 per cent, whilst the filter runs were increased on\r\nthe average by one hour and ten minutes. The net saving in coagulant\r\nalone amounted to 30 cents per million gallons.\r\n\r\nClark and De Gage[2] found that the use of smaller amounts of coagulant\r\nduring the period of combined disinfection and coagulation resulted in\r\nan increase of nearly 25 per cent in the quantity of water passed\r\nthrough the filter between washings, and also in a material reduction of\r\nthe cost of chemicals, which averaged $2.62 per million gallons for\r\ncombined disinfection and coagulation as against $4.86 for coagulation\r\nalone. The water used in these experiments was obtained from the\r\nMerrimac River at Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe effect of hypochlorite on the reduction of algae growths on slow sand\r\nfilters was first noticed by Houston during the treatment of the Lincoln\r\nsupply in 1905. Two open service reservoirs were fed with treated water\r\nand were themselves dosed from time to time. \"Previous to 1905 they\r\ndeveloped seasonally most abundant growths, but during the hypochlorite\r\ntreatment it was noticed that they remained bright, clear, and\r\nremarkably free from growths\" (Houston[3]).\r\n\r\nEllms,[4] of Cincinnati, has also noted the effect of hypochlorite on\r\nalgae. When the bleach was added to the coagulated water the destruction\r\nof the plankton was not as satisfactory as had been anticipated and it\r\nwas found that large doses destroyed the coating of the sand particles\r\nand rendered the filters less efficient. The use of bleach in the\r\nfiltered water basin was more successful and cleared it of troublesome\r\ngrowths.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, during the treatment of the London Supply with bleach (dosage\r\n0.5 p.p.m. of available chlorine), Houston made further observations on\r\nthis point. The Thames water, taken at Staines, had previously been\r\nstored for considerable periods in reservoirs, but this necessitated\r\nlifting the water by pumps which consumed large quantities of coal that\r\nwere urgently needed for national purposes. As a war measure, the\r\nstorage was eliminated and the water treated with hypochlorite at\r\nStaines and allowed to flow by gravitation to the various works where\r\nthe slow sand filters are situated. The treatment resulted in a marked\r\nreduction in the growths of algae, the reduction in the area of filters\r\ncleaned in 1916 (June to September) as compared with 1915 being as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Percentage\r\n      Filter Works.             Reduction\r\n                              (Approximate).\r\n  Grand Junction (Hampton)          6\r\n  Grand Junction (Kew)             43\r\n  East London (Sunbury)            30\r\n  Kempton Park                     33\r\n  West Middlesex                   56\r\n\r\nA portion of this reduction can probably be attributed to the\r\nelimination of storage.\r\n\r\nChlorination, by decreasing the load on filter beds, has enabled the\r\nrate of filtration to be increased in some cases. This increased\r\ncapacity, which would otherwise have necessitated additional filter\r\nunits, has been obtained without any further capital outlay. At\r\nPittsburg (Johnson[5]) the rate of filtration, after cleaning, was\r\nincreased 250,000 gallons each hour until the normal rate was reached;\r\nrestored beds were maintained at a 250,000 gallon rate for one week.\r\nAfter the introduction of chlorination it was found possible to increase\r\nthe rates more rapidly without adversely affecting the purity of the\r\nmixed filter affluents.\r\n\r\n_Hygienic Results._ Evidence as to the actual reduction of the number of\r\nsuch pathogenic germs as _B. typhosus_ in water supplies by chlorination\r\nis most readily found in the death rates from typhoid fever in cities\r\nthat have no other means of water purification. In some cases this\r\nevidence is necessarily of a circumstantial nature; in others it is\r\ndefinite and conclusive.\r\n\r\nSome of the earlier results of the effect of chlorination on typhoid\r\nmorbidity and mortality rates were compiled by Jennings[6] and others\r\nhave been published by Longley.[7] These data have been brought up to\r\ndate in Table XXXI and other statistics added.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XXXI.--EFFECT OF CHLORINATION ON TYPHOID RATES\r\n\r\nAVERAGE TYPHOID DEATH RATE PER 100,000 POPULATION\r\n\r\n  ----------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+-----------\r\n      City.       |  Commenced  | BEFORE USING.| AFTER USING. |\r\n                  |Chlorination.+-------+------+-------+------+ Percentage\r\n                  |             |Period.|Rate. |Period.|Rate. | Reduction.\r\n  ----------------+-------------+-------+------+-------+------+-----------\r\n  Baltimore       |June 1911    |1900-10| 35.2 |1912-15| 22.2 |    36\r\n  Cleveland       |Sept. 1911   |1900-10| 35.5 |1912-16|  8.2 |    77\r\n  Des Moines      |Dec. 1910    |1905-10| 22.7 |1911-13| 13.4 |    41\r\n  Erie            |Mar. 1911    |1906-10| 50.6 |1912-14| 15.0 |    70\r\n  Evanston, Ill.  |Dec. 1911    |1908-11| 29.0 |1912-13| 14.5 |    50\r\n  Jersey City     |Sept. 1908   |1900-17| 18.7 |1909-16|  8.4 |    55\r\n  Kansas City, Mo.|Jan. 1911    |1900-10| 42.5 |1911-16| 14.2 |    66\r\n  Omaha, Neb.     |May 1910     |1900-09| 22.5 |1911-16| 10.6 |    53\r\n  Trenton         |Dec. 1911    |1907-11| 46.0 |1911-14| 28.7 |    35\r\n  Montreal        |Feb. 1910    |1906-10| 40.0 |1911-16| 25.0 |    37\r\n  Toronto         |Apr. 1911    |1906-10| 31.2 |1912-16|  7.8 |    75\r\n  Ottawa          |Sept. 1912   |1906-10| 34.0 |1913-17| 17.0 |    50\r\n  ----------------+-------------+-------+------+-------+------+-----------\r\n\r\nThe figures given in this table show the effect of chlorination only; no\r\nother form of purification was used during the periods given, except at\r\nToronto where a portion of the supply has been subjected to filtration.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that since chlorination was adopted the typhoid death\r\nrates have been reduced by approximately 50 per cent and that the\r\naverages for the period after treatment are almost invariably less than\r\n20 per 100,000, a figure that a few years ago was regarded as\r\nsatisfactory. The average death rate for the last available year is 11\r\nper 100,000, a result that is even more satisfactory and exceeds the\r\nanticipations of the most optimistic of sanitarians.\r\n\r\nA portion of the reduction in the typhoid rates is no doubt due to\r\nimprovements in general sanitary conditions but the reduction is much\r\ngreater than can be accounted for in that manner alone and in many\r\ncases there was a sharp decline immediately following the commencement\r\nof chlorination.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances there is evidence that chlorination has reduced the\r\ntyphoid rates of cities previously supplied with filtered water. Diagram\r\nX, drawn from data supplied by Dr. West, of the Torresdale Filtration\r\nPlant, shows the effect of disinfecting the filter effluents at\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM X\r\n\r\nTYPHOID IN PHILADELPHIA]\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1909-10-11, when practically the whole of the city\r\nsupply was filtered, the average typhoid death rate was 18, but when the\r\nwater was also chlorinated, in 1914-15-16, the rate was only 7, a\r\nreduction of 61 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe figures in Table XXXII show that the Torresdale filters, during\r\n1915-16 were unable to adequately purify the water and that chlorination\r\nwas necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XXXII.--CHLORINATION OF FILTER EFFLUENTS\r\n\r\n(TORRESDALE)\r\n\r\n  ----+---------+---------+----------+----------------------------------\r\n      |         |         |          | BACTERIA PER CUBIC CENTIMETER.\r\n      | Oxygen  |         |          +-----------------+----------------\r\n      |Consumed.| Colour. |Turbidity.|    Untreated.   |    Treated.\r\n      |         |         |          +---------+-------+---------+------\r\n      |         |         |          |Gelatine.| Agar. |Gelatine.| Agar.\r\n  ----+---------+---------+----------+---------+-------+---------+------\r\n  1915|  1.70   |   12    |   0.6    |   141   |  30   |   28    |  14\r\n  1916|  1.90   |   12    |   Nil.   |    88   |  23   |   38    |  11\r\n  ====+=========+=========+==========+=========+=======+=========+======\r\n      |               _B. coli communis_               |\r\n      |            Per Cent Positive Tests.            |\r\n      +----------------------+-------------------------+\r\n      |    Untreated.        |         Treated.        | Added Chlorine\r\n      +----------+-----------+------------+------------+   Parts Per\r\n      |10 c.cms. |  1 c.cm.  | 10 c.cms.  |  1 c.cm.   |   Million.\r\n  ----+----------+-----------+------------+------------+----------------\r\n  1915|    66    |     24    |     5      |    0.3     |      0.18\r\n  1916|    49    |     16    |     7.4    |    1.9     |      0.15\r\n  ----+----------+-----------+------------+------------+----------------\r\n\r\nIn Diagram XI the typhoid death rates of Columbus, Ohio, and New Orleans\r\nare shown to exemplify conditions that have not been improved by\r\nchlorination. The endemic condition of typhoid in Columbus was brought\r\nto an abrupt conclusion by the installation and operation of the\r\nsoftening and filter plant in September, 1908, and no further reduction\r\nfollowed the introduction of chlorination in December, 1909.\r\n\r\nIn New Orleans the typhoid rate decreased on the inception of the new\r\nwater works system in 1909 and again after the installation of the\r\nCarrollton filters in 1912. The product of the filtration plants has\r\nalways been above suspicion but aftergrowths occasionally developed and\r\nthe bacterial count then exceeded the United States Treasury standard.\r\nTo overcome this difficulty, hypochlorite was used in 1915, but, as was\r\nanticipated, it had no effect on the typhoid rate. The high rate in New\r\nOrleans is largely due to outside cases received for hospital treatment\r\nand to other circumstances beyond the control of the water and sewerage\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nIn all the examples previously cited, the evidence as to the effect of\r\nchlorination on typhoid mortality rates is circumstantial but, taken as\r\na whole, it is fairly conclusive. In the examples to be considered next\r\nthe evidence is more direct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM XI\r\n\r\nTYPHOID IN COLUMBUS AND NEW ORLEANS]\r\n\r\nOne of the most conclusive experiments as to the beneficial effect of\r\nchlorination is that reported by Young[8] of Chicago. The water supply\r\nof Chicago was obtained from Lake Michigan by means of intake pipes and\r\npumped to various parts of the city. The distribution system was divided\r\ninto four districts and, although there was a certain amount of mixing\r\nalong the borders, the water supplied to each district was substantially\r\nseparate. The rapid and progressive decline in the typhoid rate of\r\nChicago (from 19 in 1900 to 10.8 in 1911) subsequent to the diversion\r\nof the city sewage from the lake, led to the assumption that water-borne\r\ntyphoid had ceased to be of any moment. Early in 1912, however,\r\npermission was secured to chlorinate the supply of one district (No. 1)\r\nand the treatment was continued until December when the solutions\r\ncommenced to freeze. Diagram XII shows the effect of the treatment on\r\nthe autumnal increase in District No. 1 as compared with the other three\r\ndistricts. The autumnal increase was calculated from the excess of\r\ntyphoid incidence for July to November inclusive, over that for February\r\nto June inclusive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM XII\r\n\r\nAUTUMNAL INCREASE IN TYPHOID, CHICAGO (Young)]\r\n\r\nThese results demonstrate in a most striking manner the beneficial\r\neffect of chlorination. The general conditions, with the exception of\r\nthe raw water supply, were approximately the same in all four districts.\r\nDiagram XIII shows that the raw water supply of District No. 1 was\r\nslightly worse than any of the others, 21.8 per cent of the samples from\r\nDistrict No. 1 containing _B. coli_ in 1 c.cm. as compared with 21.0 per\r\ncent in the most polluted supply of the other districts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM XIII\r\n\r\nB. COLI IN CHICAGO RAW WATER (Young)]\r\n\r\nThe results obtained at Ottawa are also conclusive. Following two\r\nepidemics of typhoid fever in 1911 and 1912, caused by breaks in the\r\nintake pipe, hypochlorite treatment was commenced and has been in\r\ncontinuous operation until February, 1917, when chloramine treatment was\r\nsubstituted. The dosage has been so regulated as to assure a high degree\r\nof purity at all times in the water delivered to the mains and as\r\nevidence of this it might be mentioned that the average _B. coli_ index\r\n(calculated by Phelps' method) for the years 1916 and 1917 was only 0.27\r\nper 100 c.cms. The typhoid rates for the five years preceding the\r\nepidemic years and for a similar subsequent period are given in Diagram\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM XIV\r\n\r\nTYPHOID IN OTTAWA]\r\n\r\nThe diagram shows that there has been a constant reduction in the city\r\ntyphoid rate since the last severe epidemic with the exception of the\r\nyear 1915. The high rate of that year was caused by a localised epidemic\r\nstarted by polluted well water and spread by flies from an unsewered\r\narea. This outbreak was the cause of about seven deaths registered\r\nduring that year (population 100,000).\r\n\r\nThe objection might be raised that if the reduction of the typhoid rate\r\nwere due to the water treatment, the decline should have been abrupt and\r\nnot a gradual one. It is probable that there has been practically no\r\nwater-borne typhoid in the city since chlorination was commenced but\r\nthis fact is masked by cases from other sources. During 1911 and 1912\r\nover 3,500 cases of typhoid were reported, of which an appreciable\r\nnumber would become carriers for various periods of time. As these\r\ncarriers decreased the number of cases infected by them would also\r\ndecrease and so account for a gradually declining death rate.\r\n\r\nIt might be further objected that the reduced typhoid rate is due to a\r\ngeneral improvement in the sanitary conditions. If the death rate from\r\ncauses other than typhoid can be regarded as a measure of the general\r\nsanitary conditions it is obvious from the data in Table XXXIII that the\r\nimprovement in the typhoid rate is immeasurably greater than can be\r\nascribed to that cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XXXIII.--DEATH RATES IN OTTAWA BEFORE AND AFTER CHLORINATION\r\n\r\n  --------------------------+-------------------+---------------------\r\n                            |  RATE PER 100,000 |      PERCENTAGE\r\n          Cause.            +---------+---------+-----------+---------\r\n                            | 1908-12 | 1913-17 | Reduction | Increase\r\n  --------------------------+---------+---------+-----------+---------\r\n  Total[A]                  |  14.90  |  14.78  |    1.2    |   ...\r\n  Typhoid, total            |  34[B]  |  17     |   50.0    |   ...\r\n  Typhoid, city             |  26[B]  |   8     |   69.2    |   ...\r\n  Pneumonia                 | 100     | 107     |    ...    |   7.0\r\n  Tuberculosis              | 133     | 138     |    ...    |   3.7\r\n  Diarrh[oe]a and Enteritis | 139     | 128     |    7.9    |   ...\r\n    under 2 years           |         |         |           |\r\n  --------------------------+---------+---------+-----------+---------\r\n\r\n  [A] Rate per 1,000.\r\n\r\n  [B] 1906-10, epidemic years 1911-12 excluded.\r\n\r\nOne further objection might be made: that the raw water was not infected\r\nduring 1913-17 or infected to a smaller extent than during the previous\r\nperiod. Attempts to isolate _B. typhosus_ from the raw water have\r\ninvariably been futile but their presence in 1914 might be inferred from\r\nthe fact that during the latter part of the summer of that year an\r\nepidemic of typhoid fever occurred at Aylmer, a village that discharges\r\nits sewage into the Ottawa River about six miles above the Ottawa\r\nintake. Hull, situated on the opposite bank of the river and having a\r\npopulation of 20,000, takes its water supply from the same channel that\r\nsupplies Ottawa but at a point a few hundred feet further down stream.\r\nDuring November and December, 1914, some 200 cases of typhoid fever\r\n(incidence 1,000 per 100,000) occurred in Hull as compared with 28 in\r\nOttawa. As the Ottawa intake is situated between the Hull intake and the\r\noutlet of the Aylmer sewer it is incredible that the Ottawa raw water\r\nwas not also infected.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 a liquid chlorine plant was installed in Hull, but in 1917,\r\nowing to an accident, it was out of commission for a short period and at\r\nleast 100 cases of fever developed during the following month. During\r\nthe same period only two cases were reported in Ottawa and of these one\r\nwas obviously contracted outside the city.\r\n\r\nIn view of the preceding facts it must be granted that the improvement\r\nin the typhoid rate of Ottawa can be definitely attributed to an\r\nimprovement in the water supply caused by chlorination.\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of chlorination to prevent and check epidemics of\r\nwater-borne typhoid has never been doubted. Innumerable instances could\r\nbe cited in which the prompt treatment of large public supplies has\r\npromptly checked outbreaks that threatened to assume serious proportions\r\nand there is no doubt that the extremely low typhoid morbidity rate on\r\nthe Western Front of the European battlefield is partially due to the\r\nextensive and rigorous chlorination measures that have been instigated.\r\nProphylactic vaccination and the prompt isolation of typhoid carriers\r\nhave largely contributed to the wonderful results obtained but due\r\ncredit must also be given to the systematic purification and treatment\r\nof water supplies. Similar results have been obtained at training camps\r\nin Canada and in other countries by effective treatment with either\r\nliquid chlorine or hypochlorite.\r\n\r\nSince the inception of water chlorination in America in 1908, the merit\r\nof the method has been very generally recognized throughout the\r\nContinent but was regarded with scepticism in Europe, except as a\r\ntemporary expedient, until the results obtained by the military forces\r\ncompelled more general recognition. Before the war, chlorination of\r\nwater supplies in England was only practised in a few isolated and\r\nrelatively unimportant instances; in 1917, practically the whole supply\r\nof London was chlorinated and at Worcester a similar treatment has been\r\nrecommended to enable the slow sand filters to be operated at higher\r\nrates without reducing the quality of the water supplied to the\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n_Use and Abuse of Chlorine._ Inasmuch as chlorination has no beneficial\r\neffect on water except the reduction of the bacterial content it should\r\nbe used for this purpose only and under such conditions as permit the\r\noperations to be under full control at all times. The supplies that can\r\nbe most efficiently and safely treated are those that are relatively\r\nconstant in chemical composition and bacterial pollution. Changes in\r\nvolume can be dealt with by automatic apparatus but sudden changes in\r\norganic and bacterial content require a change of dosage that cannot be\r\nmade by any mechanical appliance. Long experience and accurate\r\nmeteorological records may in some cases enable those in charge of\r\nchlorination plants to anticipate changes in the conditions of the water\r\nsupply, but it is always preferable to provide a positive method of\r\npreventing sudden changes by using chlorination merely as an adjunct to\r\nother processes of purification. Unpurified waters that are\r\nobjectionable on account of their bacterial content only are very rare,\r\nas the cause that produces the bacterial pollution usually produces\r\nother conditions that are equally objectionable though not so dangerous\r\nto health. Sudden storms in summer, or sudden thaws in winter, usually\r\ncause large increments in turbidity accompanied by soil washings that\r\noften carry appreciable quantities of faecal matter into surface water\r\nsupplies. Lake supplies often suffer in the same manner and sewage,\r\nwhich during normal conditions is carried safely away from water\r\nintakes, obtains access to the supply. If the dosage is maintained at a\r\nlevel sufficiently high to meet these abnormal conditions, complaints as\r\nto taste and odour would ensue, and in general, such a practice is\r\nimpossible. Some supplies have been chlorinated successfully for years\r\nbut the principle of using chlorination as the first and last line of\r\ndefence cannot be recommended. Success can only be obtained by eternal\r\nvigilance and the responsibility for results is more than water works\r\nofficials should be called upon to assume.\r\n\r\nChlorination is an invaluable adjunct to other forms of water\r\npurification and it is not improbable that, in the future, filter plants\r\nwill be designed to remove aesthetic objections at the lowest possible\r\ncost and that chlorination will be relied upon for bacterial reduction.\r\nChlorination is the simplest, most economical, and efficient process by\r\nwhich the removal of bacteria can be accomplished and there is no valid\r\nreason why it should not be used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of this process has suffered through the efforts of over\r\nzealous enthusiasts who have been unable either to recognize its\r\nlimitations or to appreciate the fact that a domestic water supply\r\nshould be something more than a palatable liquid that does not contain\r\npathogenic organisms. Every system of water purification has its limited\r\nsphere of utility and chlorination is no exception to the rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n[1] Weldon and Powell. Eng.

One gram of _o_-tolidine, purified by\r\nrecrystallization from alcohol, is dissolved in 1 litre of 10 per cent\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n2. Copper sulphate solution. Dissolve 1.5 grams of copper sulphate and 1\r\nc.cm. of concentrated sulphuric acid in distilled water and dilute the\r\nsolution to 100 c.cms.\r\n\r\n3. Potassium bichromate solution. Dissolve 0.025 gram of potassium\r\nbichromate and 0.1 c.cm. of concentrated sulphuric acid in distilled\r\nwater and dilute the solution to 100 c.cms.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURE. Mix 1 c.cm. of the tolidine reagent with 100 c.cms. of the\r\nsample in a Nessler tube and allow the solution to stand at least five\r\nminutes. Small amounts of free chlorine give a yellow and larger amounts\r\nan orange colour.\r\n\r\nFor quantitative determination compare the colour with that of standards\r\nin similar tubes prepared from the solutions of copper sulphate and\r\npotassium bichromate.
