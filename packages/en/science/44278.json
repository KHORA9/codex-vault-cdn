It is well\r\nknown with what energy the taste for military matters became developed\r\namongst that nation of ship-owners, shopkeepers, and mechanics. Simple\r\ntradesmen jumped their counters to become extemporized captains, colonels,\r\nand generals, without having ever passed the School of Instruction at\r\nWest Point: nevertheless, they quickly rivalled their compeers of the\r\nold continent, and, like them, carried off victories by dint of lavish\r\nexpenditure in ammunition, money, and men.\r\n\r\nBut the point in which the Americans singularly distanced the Europeans\r\nwas in the science of _gunnery._ Not, indeed, that their weapons retained\r\na higher degree of perfection than theirs, but that they exhibited\r\nunheard-of dimensions, and consequently attained hitherto unheard-of\r\nranges. In point of grazing, plunging, oblique, or enfilading, or\r\npoint-blank firing, the English, French, and Prussians have nothing to\r\nlearn; but their cannon, howitzers, and mortars are mere pocket-pistols\r\ncompared with the formidable engines of the American artillery.\r\n\r\nThis fact need surprise no one. The Yankees, the first mechanicians in\r\nthe world, are engineers—just as the Italians are musicians and the\r\nGermans metaphysicians—by right of birth. Nothing is more natural,\r\ntherefore, than to perceive them applying their audacious ingenuity to\r\nthe science of gunnery. Witness the marvels of Parrott, Dahlgren, and\r\nRodman. The Armstrong, Palliser, and Beaulieu guns were compelled to bow\r\nbefore their transatlantic rivals.\r\n\r\nNow when an American has an idea, he directly seeks a second American to\r\nshare it. If there be three, they elect a president and two secretaries.\r\nGiven _four,_ they name a keeper of records, and the office is ready\r\nfor work; _five,_ they convene a general meeting, and the club is fully\r\nconstituted. So things were managed in Baltimore. The inventor of a new\r\ncannon associated himself with the caster and the borer. Thus was formed\r\nthe nucleus of the \"Gun Club.\" In a single month after its formation it\r\nnumbered 1833 effective members and 30,565 corresponding members.\r\n\r\nOne condition was imposed as a _sine qua non_ upon every candidate for\r\nadmission into the association, and that was the condition of having\r\ndesigned, or (more or less) perfected a cannon; or, in default of a\r\ncannon, at least a firearm of some description. It may, however, be\r\nmentioned that mere inventions of revolvers, five-shooting carbines,\r\nand similar small arms, met with but little consideration. Artillerists\r\nalways commanded the chief place of favour.\r\n\r\nThe estimation in which these gentlemen were held, according to one\r\nof the most scientific exponents of the Gun Club, was \"proportional to\r\nthe masses of their guns, and in the direct ratio of the square of the\r\ndistances attained by their projectiles.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gun Club once founded, it is easy to conceive the result of the\r\ninventive genius of the Americans. Their military weapons attained colossal\r\nproportions, and their projectiles, exceeding the prescribed limits,\r\nunfortunately occasionally cut in two some unoffending pedestrians.\r\nThese inventions, in fact, left far in the rear the timid instruments of\r\nEuropean artillery.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to add that these Yankees, brave as they have ever proved\r\nthemselves to be, did not confine themselves to theories and formulæ,\r\nbut that they paid heavily, in _propriâ personâ,_ for their inventions.\r\nAmongst them were to be counted officers of all ranks, from lieutenants\r\nto generals; military men of every age, from those who were just making\r\ntheir _début_ in the profession of arms up to those who had grown old on\r\nthe gun-carriage. Many had found their rest on the field of battle whose\r\nnames figured in the \"Book of Honour\" of the Gun Club; and of those who\r\nmade good their return the greater proportion bore the marks of their\r\nindisputable valour. Crutches, wooden legs, artificial arms, steel hooks,\r\ncaoutchouc jaws, silver craniums, platinum noses, were all to be found in\r\nthe collection; and it was calculated by the great statistician Pitcairn\r\nthat throughout the Gun Club there was not quite one arm between four\r\npersons and exactly two legs between six.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these valiant artillerists took no particular account of\r\nthese little facts, and felt justly proud when the despatches of a battle\r\nreturned the number of victims at tenfold the quantity of the projectiles\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\nOne day, however—sad and melancholy day!—peace was signed between\r\nthe survivors of the war; the thunder of the guns gradually ceased,\r\nthe mortars were silent, the howitzers were muzzled for an indefinite\r\nperiod, the cannon, with muzzles depressed, were returned into the\r\narsenal, the shot were repiled, all bloody reminiscences were effaced;\r\nthe cotton-plants grew luxuriantly in the well-manured fields, all\r\nmourning garments were laid aside, together with grief; and the Gun Club\r\nwas relegated to profound inactivity.\r\n\r\nSome few of the more advanced and inveterate theorists set themselves\r\nagain to work upon calculations regarding the laws of projectiles. They\r\nreverted invariably to gigantic shells and howitzers of unparalleled\r\ncalibre. Still, in default of practical experience what was the value\r\nof mere theories? Consequently, the club-rooms became deserted, the\r\nservants dozed in the antechambers, the newspapers grew mouldy on the\r\ntables, sounds of snoring came from dark corners, and the members of the\r\nGun Club, erstwhile so noisy in their seances, were reduced to silence\r\nby this disastrous peace and gave themselves up wholly to dreams of a\r\nPlatonic kind of artillery.\r\n\r\n\"This is horrible!\" said Tom Hunter one evening, while rapidly carbonizing\r\nhis wooden legs in the fireplace of the smoking-room; \"nothing to do!\r\nnothing to look forward to! what a loathsome existence! When again shall\r\nthe guns arouse us in the morning with their delightful reports?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those days are gone by,\" said jolly Bilsby, trying to extend his missing\r\narms. \"It was delightful once upon a time! One invented a gun, and hardly\r\nwas it cast, when one hastened to try it in the face of the enemy! Then\r\none returned to camp with a word of encouragement from Sherman or a\r\nfriendly shake of the hand from M'Clellan. But now the generals are gone\r\nback to their counters; and in place of projectiles, they despatch bales\r\nof cotton. By Jove, the future of gunnery in America is lost!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! and no war in prospect!\" continued the famous James T. Maston,\r\nscratching with his steel hook his gutta-percha cranium. \"Not a cloud in\r\nthe horizon! and that too at such a critical period in the progress of\r\nthe science of artillery! Yes, gentlemen! I who address you have myself\r\nthis very morning perfected a model (plan, section, elevation, &c.) of\r\na mortar destined to change all the conditions of warfare!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! is it possible?\" replied Tom Hunter, his thoughts reverting\r\ninvoluntarily to a former invention of the Hon. J. T. Maston, by which,\r\nat its first trial, he had succeeded in killing three hundred and\r\nthirty-seven people.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE ARTILLERY MEN OF THE GUN CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fact!\" replied he. \"Still, what is the use of so many studies worked\r\nout, so many difficulties vanquished? It's mere waste of time! The New\r\nWorld seems to have made up its mind to live in peace; and our bellicose\r\n_Tribune_ predicts some approaching catastrophes arising out of this\r\nscandalous increase of population.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" replied Colonel Blomsberry, \"they are always struggling\r\nin Europe to maintain the principle of nationalities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there might be some field for enterprise down there; and if they\r\nwould accept our services—\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you dreaming of?\" screamed Bilsby; \"work at gunnery for the\r\nbenefit of foreigners?\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be better than doing nothing here,\" returned the colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said J. T. Maston; \"but still we need not dream of that\r\nexpedient.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" demanded the colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Because their ideas of progress in the Old World are contrary to our\r\nAmerican habits of thought. Those fellows believe that one can't become\r\na general without having served first as an ensign; which is as much as\r\nto say that one can't point a gun without having first cast it oneself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous!\" replied Tom Hunter, whittling with his bowie-knife the arms\r\nof his easy-chair; \"but if that be the case there, all that is left for\r\nus is to plant tobacco and distil whale-oil.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" roared J. T. Maston, \"shall we not employ these remaining\r\nyears of our life in perfecting fire-arms? Shall there never be a fresh\r\nopportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles? Shall the air never again\r\nbe lighted with the glare of our guns? No international difficulty ever\r\narise to enable us to declare war against some transatlantic power? Shall\r\nnot the French sink one of our steamers, or the English, in defiance of\r\nthe rights of nations, hang a few of our countrymen?\"\r\n\r\n\"No such luck,\" replied Colonel Blomsberry; \"nothing of the kind is likely\r\nto happen; and even if it did, we should not profit by it. American\r\nsusceptibility is fast declining, and we are all going to the dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is too true,\" replied J. T. Maston, with fresh violence; \"there are\r\na thousand grounds for fighting, and yet we don't fight. We save up our\r\narms and legs for the benefit of nations who don't know what to do with\r\nthem! But stop—without going out of one's way to find a cause for\r\nwar—did not North America once belong to the English?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Tom Hunter, stamping his crutch with fury.\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" replied J. T. Maston, \"why should not England in her turn\r\nbelong to the Americans?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be but just and fair,\" returned Colonel Blomsberry.\r\n\r\n\"Go and propose it to the President of the United States,\" cried J. T.\r\nMaston, \"and see how he will receive you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" growled Bilsby between the four teeth which the war had left him;\r\n\"that will never do!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" cried J. T. Maston, \"he mustn't count on my vote at the next\r\nelection!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor on ours,\" replied unanimously all the bellicose invalids.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" replied J. T. M., \"allow me to say that, if I cannot get an\r\nopportunity to try my new mortars on a real field of battle, I shall say\r\ngood-bye to the members of the Gun Club, and go and bury myself in the\r\nprairies of Arkansas!\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case we will accompany you,\" cried the others.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this unfortunate condition, and the club was threatened\r\nwith approaching dissolution, when an unexpected circumstance occurred\r\nto prevent so deplorable a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow after this conversation every member of the association\r\nreceived a sealed circular couched in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n   \"BALTIMORE, _Oct._ 3.\r\n\r\n   \"The President of the Gun Club has the honour to inform his colleagues\r\n   that, at the meeting of the 5th instant, he will bring before them\r\n   a communication of an extremely interesting nature. He requests,\r\n   therefore, that they will make it convenient to attend in accordance\r\n   with the present invitation.—Very cordially,\r\n\r\n   Impey Barbicane, P.G.C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n   PRESIDENT BARBICANE'S COMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of October, at 8 p.m., a dense crowd pressed towards the\r\nsaloons of the Gun Club at No. 21, Union Square. All the members of\r\nthe association resident in Baltimore attended the invitation of their\r\npresident. As regards the corresponding members, notices were delivered\r\nby hundreds throughout the streets of the city, and, large as was the\r\ngreat hall, it was quite inadequate to accommodate the crowd of _savants_.\r\nThey overflowed into the adjoining rooms, down the narrow passages, into\r\nthe outer courtyards. There they ran against the vulgar herd who pressed\r\nup to the doors, each struggling to reach the front ranks, all eager to\r\nlearn the nature of the important communication of President Barbicane;\r\nall pushing, squeezing, crushing with that perfect freedom of action which\r\nis peculiar to the masses when educated in ideas of \"self-government.\"\r\n\r\nOn that evening a stranger who might have chanced to be in Baltimore\r\ncould not have gained admission for love or money into the great hall.\r\nThat was reserved exclusively for resident or corresponding members; no\r\none else could possibly have obtained a place; and the city magnates,\r\nmunicipal councillors, and \"select men\" were compelled to mingle with the\r\nmere townspeople in order to catch stray bits of news from the interior.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the vast hall presented a curious spectacle. Its immense\r\narea was singularly adapted to the purpose. Lofty pillars formed of\r\ncannon, superposed upon huge mortars as a base, supported the fine\r\nironwork of the arches, a perfect piece of cast-iron lacework. Trophies\r\nof blunderbuses, matchlocks, arquebuses, carbines, all kinds of fire-arms,\r\nancient and modern, were picturesquely interlaced against the walls.\r\nThe gas lit up in full glare myriads of revolvers grouped in the form\r\nof lustres, whilst groups of pistols, and candelabra formed of muskets\r\nbound together, completed this magnificent display of brilliance. Models\r\nof cannon, bronze castings, sights covered with dents, plates battered by\r\nthe shots of the Gun Club, assortments of rammers and sponges, chaplets\r\nof shells, wreaths of projectiles, garlands of howitzers—in short, all\r\nthe apparatus of the artillerist, enchanted the eye by this wonderful\r\narrangement and induced a kind of belief that their real purpose was\r\nornamental rather than deadly.\r\n\r\nAt the further end of the saloon the president, assisted by four\r\nsecretaries, occupied a large platform. His chair, supported by a carved\r\ngun-carriage, was modelled upon the ponderous proportions of a 32-inch\r\nmortar. It was pointed at an angle of ninety degrees, and suspended upon\r\ntrunnions, so that the president could balance himself upon it as upon\r\na rocking-chair, a very agreeable fact in the very hot weather. Upon the\r\ntable (a huge iron plate supported upon six carronnades) stood an inkstand\r\nof exquisite elegance, made of a beautifully chased Spanish piece, and a\r\nsonnette, which, when required, could give forth a report equal to that\r\nof a revolver. During violent debates this novel kind of bell scarcely\r\nsufficed to drown the clamour of these excitable artillerists.\r\n\r\nIn front of the table benches arranged in zigzag form, like the\r\ncircumvallations of a retrenchment, formed a succession of bastions and\r\ncurtains set apart for the use of the members of the club; and on this\r\nespecial evening one might say, \"All the world was on the ramparts.\" The\r\npresident was sufficiently well known, however, for all to be assured\r\nthat he would not put his colleagues to discomfort without some very\r\nstrong motive.\r\n\r\nImpey Barbicane was a man of forty years of age, calm, cold, austere;\r\nof a singularly serious and self-contained demeanour, punctual as a\r\nchronometer, of imperturbable temper and immovable character; by no means\r\nchivalrous, yet adventurous withal, and always bringing practical ideas\r\nto bear upon the very rashest enterprises; an essentially New-Englander,\r\na Northern colonist, a descendant of the old anti-Stuart Roundheads,\r\nand the implacable enemy of the gentlemen of the South, those ancient\r\nCavaliers of the mother-country. In a word, he was a Yankee to the\r\nbackbone.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had made a large fortune as a timber-merchant. Being nominated\r\nDirector of Artillery during the war, he proved himself fertile in\r\ninvention. Bold in his conceptions, he contributed powerfully to\r\nthe progress of that arm and gave an immense impetus to experimental\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nHe was a personage of the middle height, having, by a rare exception\r\nin the Gun Club, all his limbs complete. His strongly-marked features\r\nseemed drawn by square and rule; and if it be true that, in order to\r\njudge of a man's character one must look at his profile, Barbicane, so\r\nexamined, exhibited the most certain indications of energy, audacity,\r\nand _sang-froid._\r\n\r\nAt this moment he was sitting in his armchair, silent, absorbed, lost in\r\nreflection, sheltered under his high-crowned hat—a kind of black silk\r\ncylinder which always seems firmly screwed upon the head of an American.\r\n\r\nJust when the deep-toned clock in the great hall struck eight, Barbicane,\r\nas if he had been set in motion by a spring, raised himself up. A profound\r\nsilence ensued, and the speaker, in a somewhat emphatic tone of voice,\r\ncommenced as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"My brave colleagues, too long already a paralyzing peace has plunged\r\nthe members of the Gun Club in deplorable inactivity. After a period of\r\nyears full of incidents we have been compelled to abandon our labours,\r\nand to stop short on the road of progress. I do not hesitate to state,\r\nboldly, that any war which should recall us to arms would be welcome!\"\r\n(_Tremendous applause!_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: PRESIDENT BARBICANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But war, gentlemen, is impossible under existing circumstances; and,\r\nhowever we may desire it, many years may elapse before our cannon shall\r\nagain thunder in the field of battle. We must make up our minds, then,\r\nto seek in another train of ideas some field for the activity which we\r\nall pine for.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting felt that the president was now approaching the critical\r\npoint, and redoubled their attention accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"For some months past, my brave colleagues,\" continued Barbicane, \"I\r\nhave been asking myself whether, while confining ourselves to our own\r\nparticular objects, we could not enter upon some grand experiment worthy\r\nof the nineteenth century; and whether the progress of artillery science\r\nwould not enable us to carry it out to a successful issue. I have been\r\nconsidering, working, calculating; and the result of my studies is the\r\nconviction that we are safe to succeed in an enterprise which to any\r\nother country would appear wholly impracticable. This project, the result\r\nof long elaboration, is the object of my present communication. It is\r\nworthy of yourselves, worthy of the antecedents of the Gun Club; and it\r\ncannot fail to make some noise in the world.\"\r\n\r\nA thrill of excitement ran through the meeting.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, having by a rapid movement firmly fixed his hat upon his head,\r\ncalmly continued his harangue:—\r\n\r\n\"There is no one among you, my brave colleagues, who has not seen _the\r\nMoon,_ or, at least, heard speak of it. Don't be surprised if I am about\r\nto discourse to you regarding this Queen of the Night. It is perhaps\r\nreserved for us to become the Columbuses of this unknown world. Only enter\r\ninto my plans, and second me with all your power, and I will lead you\r\nto its conquest, and its name shall be added to those of the thirty-six\r\nStates which compose this Great Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for the Moon!\" roared the Gun Club, with one voice.\r\n\r\n\"The moon, gentlemen, has been carefully studied,\" continued Barbicane;\r\n\"her mass, density, and weight; her constitution, motions, distance, as\r\nwell as her place in the solar system, have all been exactly determined.\r\nSelenographic charts have been constructed with a perfection which equals,\r\nif it does not even surpass, that of our terrestrial maps. Photography\r\nhas given us proofs of the incomparable beauty of our satellite; in short,\r\nall is known regarding the moon which mathematical science, astronomy,\r\ngeology, and optics can learn about her. But up to the present moment no\r\ndirect communication has been established with her.\"\r\n\r\nA violent movement of interest and surprise here greeted this remark of\r\nthe speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me,\" he continued, \"to recount to you briefly how certain ardent\r\nspirits, starting on imaginary journeys, have penetrated the secrets\r\nof our satellite. In the seventeenth century a certain David Fabricius\r\nboasted of having seen with his own eyes the inhabitants of the moon. In\r\n1649 a Frenchman, one Jean Baudoin, published a 'Journey performed from\r\nthe Earth to the Moon by Domingo Gonzalez,' a Spanish Adventurer. At\r\nthe same period Cyrano de Bergerac published that celebrated 'Journeys\r\nin the Moon' which met with such success in France. Somewhat later\r\nanother Frenchman, named Fontenelle, wrote 'The Plurality of Worlds,'\r\na _chef-d'œuvre_ of its time. About 1835 a small treatise, translated\r\nfrom the _New York American_, related how Sir John Herschell, having\r\nbeen despatched to the Cape of Good Hope for the purpose of making there\r\nsome astronomical calculations, had, by means of a telescope brought to\r\nperfection by means of internal lighting, reduced the apparent distance of\r\nthe moon to eighty yards! He then distinctly perceived caverns frequented\r\nby hippopotami, green mountains bordered by golden lace-work, sheep with\r\nhorns of ivory, a white species of deer and inhabitants with membranous\r\nwings, like bats. This _brochure,_ the work of an American named Locke,\r\nhad a great sale. But, to bring this rapid sketch to a close, I will\r\nonly add that a certain Hans Pfaal, of Rotterdam, launching himself in\r\na balloon filled with a gas extracted from nitrogen, thirty-seven times\r\nlighter than hydrogen, reached the moon after a passage of nineteen\r\nhours. This journey, like all the previous ones, was purely imaginary;\r\nstill, it was the work of a popular American author—I mean Edgar Poe!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: MEETING OF THE GUN CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Cheers for Edgar Poe!\" roared the assemblage, electrified by their\r\npresident's words.\r\n\r\n\"I have now enumerated,\" said Barbicane, \"the experiments which I\r\ncall purely paper ones, and wholly insufficient to establish serious\r\nrelations with the Queen of Night. Nevertheless, I am bound to add that\r\nsome practical geniuses have attempted to establish actual communication\r\nwith her. Thus, a few years ago, a German geometrician proposed to\r\nsend a scientific expedition to the steppes of Siberia. There, on those\r\nvast plains, they were to describe enormous geometric figures, drawn\r\nin characters of reflecting luminosity, amongst which was the prop.\r\nregarding the 'square of the hypothenuse,' commonly called the '_Ass's\r\nbridge_' by the French. 'Every intelligent being,' said the geometrician,\r\n'must understand the scientific meaning of that figure. The Selenites, do\r\nthey exist, will respond by a similar figure; and, a communication being\r\nthus once established, it will be easy to form an alphabet which shall\r\nenable us to converse with the inhabitants of the moon.' So spoke the\r\nGerman geometrician; but his project was never put into practice, and up\r\nto the present day there is no bond in existence between the earth and\r\nher satellite. It is reserved for the practical genius of Americans to\r\nestablish a communication with the sidereal world. The means of arriving\r\nthither are simple, easy, certain, infallible—and that is the purpose\r\nof my present proposal.\"\r\n\r\nA storm of acclamations greeted these words. There was not a single\r\nperson in the whole audience who was not overcome, carried away, lifted\r\nout of himself by the speaker's words!\r\n\r\nLong continued applause resounded from all sides.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the excitement had partially subsided, Barbicane resumed his\r\nspeech in a somewhat graver voice.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" said he, \"what progress artillery science has made during\r\nthe last few years, and what a degree of perfection firearms of every\r\nkind have reached. Moreover, you are well aware that, in general terms,\r\nthe resisting power of cannon and the expansive force of gunpowder are\r\npractically unlimited. Well! starting from this principle, I ask myself\r\nwhether, supposing sufficient apparatus could be obtained constructed\r\nupon the conditions of ascertained resistance, it might not be possible\r\nto project a shot up to the moon?\"\r\n\r\nAt these words a murmur of amazement escaped from a thousand panting\r\nchests; then succeeded a moment of perfect silence, resembling that\r\nprofound stillness which precedes the bursting of a thunderstorm. In\r\npoint of fact, a thunderstorm did peal forth, but it was the thunder of\r\napplause, of cries, and of uproar which made the very hall tremble. The\r\npresident attempted to speak, but could not. It was fully ten minutes\r\nbefore he could make himself heard.\r\n\r\n\"Suffer me to finish,\" he calmly continued. \"I have looked at the\r\nquestion in all its bearings, I have resolutely attacked it, and by\r\nincontrovertible calculations I find that a projectile endowed with an\r\ninitial velocity of 12,000 yards per second, and aimed at the moon, must\r\nnecessarily reach it. I have the honour, my brave colleagues, to propose\r\na trial of this little experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n   EFFECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the effect produced by the last words of\r\nthe honorable president—the cries, the shouts, the succession of roars,\r\nhurrahs, and all the varied vociferations which the American language\r\nis capable of supplying. It was a scene of indescribable confusion and\r\nuproar. They shouted, they clapped, they stamped on the floor of the\r\nhall. All the weapons in the museum discharged at once could not have more\r\nviolently set in motion the waves of sound. One need not be surprised at\r\nthis. There are some cannoneers nearly as noisy as their\r\nown guns.\r\n\r\nBarbicane remained calm in the midst of this enthusiastic clamour; perhaps\r\nhe was desirous of addressing a few more words to his colleagues, for by\r\nhis gestures he demanded silence, and his powerful alarum was worn out\r\nby its violent reports. No attention, however, was paid to his request.\r\nHe was presently torn from his seat and passed from the hands of his\r\nfaithful colleagues into the arms of a no less excited crowd.\r\n\r\nNothing can astound an American. It has often been asserted that the word\r\n\"impossible\" is not a French one. People have evidently been deceived\r\nby the dictionary. In America, all is easy, all is simple; and as for\r\nmechanical difficulties, they are overcome before they arise. Between\r\nBarbicane's proposition and its realization no true Yankee would have\r\nallowed even the semblance of a difficulty to be possible. A thing with\r\nthem is no sooner said than done.\r\n\r\nThe triumphal progress of the president continued throughout the evening.\r\nIt was a regular torchlight procession. Irish, Germans, French, Scotch,\r\nall the heterogeneous units which make up the population of Maryland\r\nshouted in their respective vernaculars; and the \"vivas,\" \"hurrahs,\" and\r\n\"bravos\" were intermingled in inexpressible enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nJust at this crisis, as though she comprehended all this agitation\r\nregarding herself, the Moon shone forth with serene splendour, eclipsing\r\nby her intense illumination all the surrounding lights. The Yankees\r\nall turned their gaze towards her resplendent orb, kissed their hands,\r\ncalled her by all kinds of endearing names. Between eight o'clock and\r\nmidnight one optician in Jones'-Fall Street made his fortune by the sale\r\nof opera-glasses.\r\n\r\nMidnight arrived, and the enthusiasm showed no signs of diminution.\r\nIt spread equally among all classes of citizens—men of science,\r\nshopkeepers, merchants, porters, chair-men, as well as \"greenhorns,\"\r\nwere stirred in their innermost fibres. A national enterprise was at\r\nstake. The whole city, high and low, the quays bordering the Patapsco,\r\nthe ships lying in the basins, disgorged a crowd drunk with joy, gin,\r\nand whisky. Every one chattered, argued, discussed, disputed, applauded,\r\nfrom the gentleman lounging upon the barroom settee with his tumbler of\r\nsherry-cobbler before him down to the waterman who got drunk upon his\r\n\"knock-me-down\" in the dingy taverns of Fell Point.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 a.m., however, the excitement began to subside. President\r\nBarbicane reached his house, bruised, crushed, and squeezed almost\r\nto a mummy. A Hercules could not have resisted a similar outbreak of\r\nenthusiasm. The crowd gradually deserted the squares and streets. The\r\nfour railways from Philadelphia and Washington, Harrisburg and Wheeling,\r\nwhich converge at Baltimore, whirled away the heterogeneous population\r\nto the four corners of the United States, and the city subsided into\r\ncomparative tranquillity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, thanks to the telegraphic wires, five hundred\r\nnewspapers and journals, daily, weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly, all\r\ntook up the question. They examined it under all its different aspects,\r\nphysical, meteorological, economical, or moral, up to its bearings on\r\npolitics or civilization. They debated whether the moon was a finished\r\nworld, or whether it was destined to undergo any further transformation.\r\nDid it resemble the earth at the period when the latter was destitute as\r\nyet of an atmosphere? What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere\r\npresent to our terrestrial spheroid? Granting that the question at\r\npresent was simply that of sending a projectile up to the moon, every one\r\nmust see that that involved the commencement of a series of experiments.\r\nAll must hope that some day America would penetrate the deepest secrets\r\nof that mysterious orb; and some even seemed to fear lest its conquest\r\nshould not sensibly derange the equilibrium of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe project once under discussion, not a single paragraph suggested a doubt\r\nof its realization. All the papers, pamphlets, reports—all the journals\r\npublished by the scientific, literary, and religious societies enlarged\r\nupon its advantages; and the Society of Natural History of Boston, the\r\nSociety of Science and Art of Albany, the Geographical and Statistical\r\nSociety of New York, the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and the\r\nSmithsonian of Washington sent innumerable letters of congratulation to\r\nthe Gun Club, together with offers of immediate assistance and money.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward Impey Barbicane became one of the greatest citizens\r\nof the United States, a kind of Washington of Science. A single trait of\r\nfeeling, taken from many others, will serve to show the point which this\r\nhomage of a whole people to a single individual attained.\r\n\r\nSome few days after this memorable meeting of the Gun Club, the manager\r\nof an English company announced, at the Baltimore theatre, the production\r\nof \"Much ado about Nothing.\" But the populace, seeing in that title an\r\nallusion damaging to Barbicane's project, broke into the auditorium,\r\nsmashed the benches, and compelled the unlucky director to alter his\r\nplaybill. Being a sensible man, he bowed to the public will and replaced\r\nthe offending comedy by \"As you like it;\" and for many weeks he realized\r\nfabulous profits.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n   REPLY FROM THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane, however, lost not one moment amidst all the enthusiasm of which\r\nhe had become the object. His first care was to reassemble his colleagues\r\nin the board-room of the Gun Club. There, after some discussion, it was\r\nagreed to consult the astronomers regarding the astronomical part of the\r\nenterprize. Their reply once ascertained, they could then discuss the\r\nmechanical means, and nothing should be wanting to ensure the success of\r\nthis great experiment.\r\n\r\nA note couched in precise terms, containing special interrogatories,\r\nwas then drawn up and addressed to the Observatory of Cambridge in\r\nMassachusetts. This city, where the first University of the United States\r\nwas founded, is justly celebrated for its astronomical staff. There are\r\nto be found assembled all the most eminent men of science. Here is to\r\nbe seen at work that powerful telescope which enabled Bond to resolve\r\nthe nebula of Andromeda, and Clarke to discover the satellite of Sirius.\r\nThis celebrated institution fully justified on all points the confidence\r\nreposed in it by the Gun Club.\r\n\r\nSo, after two days, the reply so impatiently awaited was placed in the\r\nhands of President Barbicane.\r\n\r\nIt was couched in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n\"_The Director of the Cambridge Observatory to the President of the Gun\r\nClub at Baltimore._\r\n\r\n\"CAMBRIDGE, _Oct._ 7.\r\n\r\n\"On the receipt of your favour of the 6th inst., addressed to the\r\nObservatory of Cambridge in the name of the Members of the Baltimore\r\nGun Club, our staff was immediately called together, and it was judged\r\nexpedient to reply as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"The questions which have been proposed to it are these,—\r\n\r\n\"'1. Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?\r\n\r\n\"'2. What is the exact distance which separates the earth from its\r\nsatellite?\r\n\r\n\"'3. What will be the period of transit of the projectile when endowed\r\nwith sufficient initial velocity? and, consequently, at what moment ought\r\nit to be discharged in order that it may touch the moon at a particular\r\npoint?\r\n\r\n\"'4. At what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most\r\nfavourable position to be reached by the projectile?\r\n\r\n\"'5. What point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed at which is\r\nintended to discharge the projectile?\r\n\r\n\"'6. What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the\r\nprojectile's departure?'\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the _first_ question, 'Is it possible to transmit a projectile\r\nup to the moon?'\r\n\r\n\"_Answer_.—Yes; provided it possess an initial velocity of 1200 yards\r\nper second; calculations prove that to be sufficient. In proportion as\r\nwe recede from the earth the action of gravitation diminishes in the\r\ninverse ratio of the square of the distance; that is to say, _at three\r\ntimes a given distance the action is nine times less._ Consequently, the\r\nweight of a shot will decrease, and will become reduced to zero at the\r\ninstant that the attraction of the moon exactly counterpoises that of\r\nthe earth; that is to say, at 47/52 of its passage. At that instant the\r\nprojectile will have no weight whatever; and, if it passes that point,\r\nit will fall into the moon by the sole effect of the lunar attraction.\r\nThe _theoretical possibility_ of the experiment is therefore absolutely\r\ndemonstrated; its success must depend upon the power of the engine\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n\"As to the _second question_, 'What is the exact distance which separates\r\nthe earth from its satellite?'\r\n\r\n\"_Answer._—The moon does not describe a circle round the earth, but\r\nrather an _ellipse_, of which our earth occupies one of the _foci;_ the\r\nconsequence, therefore, is, that at certain times it approaches nearer\r\nto, and at others it recedes farther from, the earth; in astronomical\r\nlanguage, it is at one time in _apogee_, at another in _perigee._ Now the\r\ndifference between its greatest and its least distance is too considerable\r\nto be left out of consideration. In point of fact, in its apogee the moon\r\nis 247,552 miles, and in its perigee, 218,657 miles only distant; a fact\r\nwhich makes a difference of 28,895 miles, or more than one ninth of the\r\nentire distance. The perigee distance, therefore, is that which ought to\r\nserve as the basis of all calculations.\r\n\r\n\"To the _third_ question:—\r\n\r\n\"_Answer._—If the shot should preserve continuously its initial velocity\r\nof 12,000 yards per second, it would require little more than nine\r\nhours to reach its destination; but, inasmuch as that initial velocity\r\nwill be continually decreasing, it results that, taking everything into\r\nconsideration, it will occupy 300,000 seconds, that is 83hrs. 20m. in\r\nreaching the point where the attraction of the earth and moon will be\r\n_in equilibrio._ From this point it will fall into the moon in 50,000\r\nseconds, or 13hrs. 53m. 20sec. It will be desirable, therefore, to\r\ndischarge it 97hrs. 13m. 20sec. before the arrival of the moon at the\r\npoint aimed at.\r\n\r\n\"Regarding question _four_, 'At what precise moment will the moon present\r\nherself in the most favourable position, &c.?'\r\n\r\n\"_Answer_.—After what has been said above, it will be necessary, first\r\nof all, to choose the period when the moon will be in perigee, and also\r\nthe moment when she will be crossing the zenith, which latter event will\r\nfurther diminish the entire distance by a length equal to the radius of\r\nthe earth, i.e. 3919 miles; the result of which will be that the final\r\npassage remaining to be accomplished will be 214,976 miles. But although\r\nthe moon passes her perigee every month, she does not reach the zenith\r\nalways at _exactly the same moment._ She does not appear under these two\r\nconditions simultaneously, except at long intervals of time. It will be\r\nnecessary, therefore, to wait for the moment when her passage in perigee\r\nshall coincide with that in the zenith. Now, by a fortunate circumstance,\r\non the 4th December in the ensuing year the moon _will_ present these two\r\nconditions. At midnight she will be in perigee, that is, at her shortest\r\ndistance from the earth, and at the same moment she will be crossing the\r\nzenith.\r\n\r\n\"On the _fifth_ question, 'At what point in the heavens ought the cannon\r\nto be aimed?'\r\n\r\n\"_Answer_.—The preceding remarks being admitted, the cannon ought to\r\nbe pointed to the zenith of the place. Its fire, therefore, will be\r\nperpendicular to the plane of the horizon; and the projectile will soonest\r\npass beyond the range of the terrestrial attraction. But, in order that\r\nthe moon should reach the zenith of a given place, it is necessary that\r\nthe place should not exceed in latitude the declination of the luminary;\r\nin other words, it must be comprised within the degrees 0° and 28° of\r\nlat. N. or S. In every other spot the fire must necessarily be oblique,\r\nwhich would seriously militate against the success of the experiment.\r\n\r\n\"As to the _sixth_ question, 'What place will the moon occupy in the\r\nheavens at the moment of the projectile's departure?'\r\n\r\n\"_Answer_.—At the moment when the projectile shall be discharged\r\ninto space, the moon, which travels daily forward 13° 10' 35\", will be\r\ndistant from the zenith point by four times that quantity, i.e. by 52°\r\n42' 20\", a space which corresponds to the path which she will describe\r\nduring the entire journey of the projectile. But, inasmuch as it is\r\nequally necessary to take into account the deviation which the rotary\r\nmotion of the earth will impart to the shot, and as the shot cannot reach\r\nthe moon until after a deviation equal to 16 radii of the earth, which,\r\ncalculated upon the moon's orbit, are equal to about eleven degrees, it\r\nbecomes necessary to add these eleven degrees to those which express the\r\nretardation of the moon just mentioned: that is to say, in round numbers,\r\nabout 64 degrees. Consequently, at the moment of firing the visual radius\r\napplied to the moon will describe, with the vertical line of the place,\r\nan angle of sixty-four degrees.\r\n\r\n\"These are our answers to the questions proposed to the Observatory of\r\nCambridge by the members of the Gun Club:—\r\n\r\n\"To sum up,—\r\n\r\n\"1st. The cannon ought to be planted in a country situated between\r\nbetween 0° and 28° of N. or S. lat.\r\n\r\n\"2ndly. It ought to be pointed directly towards the zenith of the place.\r\n\r\n\"3rdly. The projectile ought to be propelled with an initial velocity of\r\n12,000 yards per second.\r\n\r\n\"4thly. It ought to be discharged at 10hrs. 46m. 40sec. of the 1st\r\nDecember of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n\"5thly. It will meet the moon four days after its discharge, precisely\r\nat midnight on the 4th December, at the moment of its transit across the\r\nzenith.\r\n\r\n\"The members of the Gun Club ought, therefore, without delay, to commence\r\nthe works necessary for such an experiment, and to be prepared to set\r\nto work at the moment determined upon; for, if they should suffer this\r\n4th December to go by, they will not find the moon again under the same\r\nconditions of perigee and of zenith until eighteen years and eleven days\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\"The Staff of the Cambridge Observatory place themselves entirely at\r\ntheir disposal in respect of all questions of theoretical astronomy; and\r\nherewith add their congratulations to those of all the rest of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"For the Astronomical Staff,\r\n\r\n   \"J. M. BELFAST,\r\n\r\n   \"_Director of the Observatory of Cambridge._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n   THE ROMANCE OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn observer endued with an infinite range of vision, and placed in\r\nthat unknown centre around which the entire world revolves, might have\r\nbeheld myriads of atoms filling all space during the chaotic epoch of\r\nthe universe. Little by little, as ages went on, a change took place;\r\na general law of attraction manifested itself, to which the hitherto\r\nerrant atoms became obedient: these atoms combined together chemically\r\naccording to their affinities, formed themselves into molecules, and\r\ncomposed those nebulous masses with which the depths of the heavens are\r\nstrewed.\r\n\r\nThese masses became immediately endued with a rotary motion around\r\ntheir own central point. This centre, formed of indefinite molecules,\r\nbegan to revolve round its own axis during its gradual condensation;\r\nthen, following the immutable laws of mechanics, in proportion as its\r\nbulk diminished by condensation, its rotary motion became accelerated,\r\nand these two effects continuing, the result was the formation of one\r\nprincipal star, the centre of the nebulous mass.\r\n\r\nBy attentively watching, the observer would then have perceived the\r\nother molecules of the mass, following the example of this central\r\nstar, become likewise condensed by gradually accelerated rotation, and\r\ngravitating round it in the shape of innumerable stars. Thus was formed\r\nthe _Nebulæ,_ of which astronomers have reckoned up nearly 5000.\r\n\r\nAmongst these 5000 nebulæ there is one which has received the name of\r\nthe Milky Way, and which contains eighteen millions of stars, each of\r\nwhich has become the centre of a solar world.\r\n\r\nIf the observer had then specially directed his attention to one of the\r\nmore humble and less brilliant of these stellar bodies, a star of the\r\nfourth class, that which is arrogantly called the Sun, all the phenomena\r\nto which the formation of the Universe is to be ascribed would have\r\nbeen successively fulfilled before his eyes. In fact, he would have\r\nperceived this sun, as yet in the gaseous state, and composed of moving\r\nmolecules, revolving round its axis in order to accomplish its work of\r\nconcentration. This motion, faithful to the laws of mechanics, would\r\nhave been accelerated with the diminution of its volume; and a moment\r\nwould have arrived when the centrifugal force would have overpowered the\r\ncentripetal, which causes the molecules all to tend towards the centre.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon would now have passed before the observer's eye, and\r\nthe molecules situated on the plane of the equator escaping, like a stone\r\nfrom a sling of which the cord had suddenly snapped, would have formed\r\naround the sun sundry concentric rings resembling that of Saturn. In\r\ntheir turn, again, these rings of cosmical matter, excited by a rotary\r\nmotion round the central mass, would have been broken up and decomposed\r\ninto secondary nebulosities, that is to say, into planets. Similarly he\r\nwould have observed these planets throw off one or more rings each, which\r\nbecame the origin of the secondary bodies which we call satellites.\r\n\r\nThus, then, advancing from atom to molecule, from molecule to nebulous\r\nmass, from that to a principal star, from star to sun, from sun to planet,\r\nand hence to satellite, we have the whole series of transformations\r\nundergone by the heavenly bodies during the first days of the world.\r\n\r\nNow, of those attendant bodies which the sun maintains in their elliptical\r\norbits by the great law of gravitation, some few in their turn possess\r\nsatellites. Uranus has eight, Saturn eight, Jupiter four, Neptune possibly\r\nthree, and the Earth _one._ This last, one of the least important of the\r\nentire solar system, we call _the Moon_; and it is she whom the daring\r\ngenius of the Americans professed their intention of conquering.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE MOON'S DISC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon, by her comparative proximity, and the constantly varying\r\nappearances produced by her several phases, has always occupied a\r\nconsiderable share of the attention of the inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Thales of Miletus, in the fifth century b.c., down to\r\nthat of Copernicus in the fifteenth and Tycho Brahé in the sixteenth\r\ncentury a.d., observations have been from time to time carried on with\r\nmore or less correctness, until in the present day the altitudes of the\r\nlunar mountains have been determined with exactitude. Galileo explained\r\nthe phenomena of the lunar light produced during certain of her phases\r\nby the existence of mountains, to which he assigned a mean altitude of\r\n27,000 feet. After him Hévelius, an astronomer of Dantzic, reduced the\r\nhighest elevations to 15,000 feet; but the calculations of Riccioli\r\nbrought them up again to 21,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the eighteenth century Herschell, armed with a powerful\r\ntelescope, considerably reduced the preceding measurements. He assigned\r\na height of 11,400 feet to the maximum elevations, and reduced the mean\r\nof the different altitudes to little more than 2400 feet. But Herschell's\r\ncalculations were in their turn corrected by the observations of Halley,\r\nNasmyth, Bianchini, Gruithuysen, and others; but it was reserved for\r\nthe labours of Bœer and Mædler finally to solve the question. They\r\nsucceeded in measuring 1905 different elevations, of which six exceed\r\n15,000 feet, and twenty-two exceed 14,400 feet. The highest summit of all\r\ntowers to a height of 22,606 feet above the surface of the lunar disc. At\r\nthe same period the examination of the moon was completed. She appeared\r\ncompletely riddled with craters, and her essentially volcanic character\r\nwas apparent at each observation. By the absence of refraction in the\r\nrays of the planets occulted by her we conclude that she is absolutely\r\ndevoid of an atmosphere. The absence of air entails the absence of water.\r\nIt became, therefore, manifest that the Selenites, to support life under\r\nsuch conditions, must possess a special organization of their own, must\r\ndiffer remarkably from the inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nAt length, thanks to modern art, instruments of still higher perfection\r\nsearched the moon without intermission, not leaving a single point of\r\nher surface unexplored; and notwithstanding that her diameter measures\r\n2150 miles, her surface equals the 1-15th part of that of our globe, and\r\nher bulk the 1-49th part of that of the terrestrial spheroid—not one\r\nof her secrets was able to escape the eyes of the astronomers; and these\r\nskilful men of science carried to even greater degree their prodigious\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThus they remarked that, during full moon, the disc appeared scored in\r\ncertain parts with _white_ lines; and, during the phases, with _black._\r\nOn prosecuting the study of these with still greater precision, they\r\nsucceeded in obtaining an exact account of the nature of these lines.\r\nThey were long and narrow furrows sunk between parallel ridges, bordering\r\ngenerally upon the edges of the craters. Their length varied between\r\nten and 100 miles, and their width was about 1600 yards. Astronomers\r\ncalled them chasms, but they could not get any farther. Whether these\r\nchasms were the dried-up beds of ancient rivers or not they were unable\r\nthoroughly to ascertain.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, amongst others, hoped one day or other to determine this\r\ngeological question. They also undertook to examine the true nature\r\nof that system of parallel ramparts discovered on the moon's surface\r\nby Gruithuysen, a learned professor of Munich, who considered them to\r\nbe \"a system of fortifications thrown up by the Selenitic engineers.\"\r\nThese two points, yet obscure, as well as others, no doubt, could not be\r\ndefinitively settled except by direct communication with the moon.\r\n\r\nRegarding the degree of intensity of its light, there was nothing more\r\nto learn on this point. It was known that it is 300,000 times weaker\r\nthan that of the sun, and that its heat has no appreciable effect upon\r\nthe thermometer. As to the phenomenon known as the \"ashy light,\" it is\r\nexplained naturally by the effect of the transmission of the solar rays\r\nfrom the earth to the moon, which give the appearance of completeness to\r\nthe lunar disc, while it presents itself under the crescent form during\r\nits first and last phases.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of knowledge acquired regarding the earth's satellite,\r\nwhich the Gun Club undertook to perfect in all its aspects, cosmographic,\r\ngeological, political, and moral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n   THE PERMISSIVE LIMITS OF IGNORANCE AND BELIEF IN THE\r\n      UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of Barbicane's proposition was to place upon the\r\norders of the day all the astronomical facts relative to the Queen of\r\nNight. Everybody set to work to study assiduously. One would have thought\r\nthat the moon had just appeared for the first time, and that no one had\r\never before caught a glimpse of her in the heavens. The papers revived\r\nall the old anecdotes in which the \"sun of the wolves\" played a part;\r\nthey recalled the influences which the ignorance of past ages ascribed\r\nto her; in short, all America was seized with seleno-mania, or had become\r\nmoon-mad.\r\n\r\nThe scientific journals, for their part, dealt more especially with the\r\nquestions which touched upon the enterprise of the Gun Club. The letter\r\nof the Observatory of Cambridge was published by them, and commented upon\r\nwith unreserved approval.\r\n\r\nUntil that time most people had been ignorant of the mode in which the\r\ndistance which separates the moon from the earth is calculated. They took\r\nadvantage of this fact to explain to them that this distance was obtained\r\nby measuring the parallax of the moon. The term parallax proving \"caviare\r\nto the general,\" they further explained that it meant the angle formed\r\nby the inclination of two straight lines drawn from either extremity\r\nof the earth's radius to the moon. On doubts being expressed as to the\r\ncorrectness of this method, they immediately proved that not only was\r\nthe mean distance 234,347 miles, but that astronomers could not possibly\r\nbe in error in their estimate by more than 70 miles either way.\r\n\r\nTo those who were not familiar with the motions of the moon, they\r\ndemonstrated that she possesses two distinct motions, the first being\r\nthat of rotation upon her axis, the second that of revolution round the\r\nearth, accomplishing both together in an equal period of time, that is\r\nto say, in 27⅓ days.\r\n\r\nThe motion of rotation is that which produces day and night on the\r\nsurface of the moon; save that there is only one day and one night in\r\nthe lunar month, each lasting 354⅓ hours. But, happily for her, the\r\nface turned towards the terrestrial globe is illuminated by it with an\r\nintensity equal to the light of fourteen moons. As to the other face,\r\nalways invisible to us, it has of necessity 354 hours of absolute night,\r\ntempered only by that \"pale glimmer which falls upon it from the stars.\"\r\n\r\nSome well-intentioned but rather obstinate persons, could not at first\r\ncomprehend how, if the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth\r\nduring her revolution, she can describe one turn round herself. To such\r\nthey answered, \"Go into your dining-room, and walk round the table in\r\nsuch a way as always to keep your face turned towards the centre; by the\r\ntime you will have achieved one complete round you will have completed\r\none turn round yourself, since your eye will have traversed successively\r\nevery point of the room. Well, then, the room is the heavens, the table\r\nis the earth, and the moon is yourself.\" And they would go away delighted.\r\n\r\nSo, then, the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth;\r\nnevertheless, to be quite exact, it is necessary to add that, in\r\nconsequence of certain fluctuations of north and south, and of west and\r\neast, termed her libration, she permits rather more than the half, that\r\nis to say, five-sevenths, to be seen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ignoramuses came to understand as much as the Director of\r\nthe Observatory himself knew, they began to worry themselves regarding\r\nher revolution round the earth, whereupon twenty scientific reviews\r\nimmediately came to the rescue. They pointed out to them then that the\r\nfirmament, with its infinitude of stars, may be considered as one vast\r\ndial-plate, upon which the moon travels, indicating the true time to all\r\nthe inhabitants of the earth; that it is during this movement that the\r\nQueen of Night exhibits her different phases; that the moon is _full_\r\nwhen she is in _opposition_ with the sun, that is when the three bodies\r\nare on the same straight line, the earth occupying the centre; that she\r\nis _new_ when she is in _conjunction_ with the sun, that is, when she\r\nis between it and the earth; and lastly, that she is in her _first_ or\r\n_last_ quarter, when she makes with the sun and the earth an angle of\r\nwhich she herself occupies the apex.\r\n\r\nRegarding the altitude which the moon attains above the horizon, the\r\nletter of the Cambridge Observatory had said all that was to be said\r\nin that respect. Every one knew that this altitude varies according to\r\nthe latitude of the observer. But the only zones of the globe in which\r\nthe moon passes the zenith, that is, the point directly over the head\r\nof the spectator, are of necessity comprised between the twenty-eighth\r\nparallels and the equator. Hence the importance of the advice to try\r\nthe experiment upon some point of that part of the globe, in order that\r\nthe projectile might be discharged perpendicularly, and so the soonest\r\nescape the action of gravitation. This was an essential condition to the\r\nsuccess of the enterprise, and continued actively to engage the public\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nRegarding the path described by the moon in her revolution round the\r\nearth, the Cambridge Observatory had demonstrated that this path is a\r\nre-entering curve, not a perfect circle, but an ellipse, of which the\r\nearth occupies one of the _foci_. It was also well understood that it is\r\nfarthest removed from the earth during its _apogee,_ and approaches most\r\nnearly to it at its _perigee._\r\n\r\nSuch then was the extent of knowledge possessed by every American on the\r\nsubject, and of which no one could decently profess ignorance. Still,\r\nwhile these true principles were being rapidly disseminated many errors\r\nand illusory fears proved less easy to eradicate.\r\n\r\nFor instance, some worthy persons maintained that the moon was an ancient\r\ncomet which, in describing its elongated orbit round the sun, happened to\r\npass near the earth, and became confined within her circle of attraction.\r\nThese drawing-room astronomers professed so to explain the charred aspect\r\nof the moon—a disaster which they attributed to the intensity of the\r\nsolar heat; only, on being reminded that comets have an atmosphere, and\r\nthat the moon has little or none, they were fairly at a loss for a reply.\r\n\r\nOthers again, belonging to the doubting class expressed certain fears as\r\nto the position of the moon. They had heard it said that, according to\r\nobservations made in the time of the Caliphs, her revolution had become\r\naccelerated in a certain degree. Hence they concluded, logically enough,\r\nthat an acceleration of motion ought to be accompanied by a corresponding\r\ndiminution in the distance separating the two bodies; and that, supposing\r\nthe double effect to be continued to infinity, the moon would end by\r\none day falling into the earth. However, they became reassured as to\r\nthe fate of future generations on being apprised that, according to the\r\ncalculations of Laplace, this acceleration of motion is confined within\r\nvery restricted limits, and that a proportional diminution of speed will\r\nbe certain to succeed it. So, then, the stability of the solar system\r\nwould not be deranged in ages to come.\r\n\r\nThere remains but the third class, the superstitious. These worthies were\r\nnot content merely to rest in ignorance; they must know all about things\r\nwhich had no existence whatever, and as to the moon, they had long known\r\nall about her. One set regarded her disc as a polished mirror, by means\r\nof which people could see each other from different points of the earth\r\nand interchange their thoughts. Another set pretended that out of one\r\nthousand new moons that had been observed, nine hundred and fifty had been\r\nattended with remarkable disturbances, such as cataclysms, revolutions,\r\nearthquakes, the deluge, &c. Then they believed in some mysterious\r\ninfluence exercised by her over human destinies—that every Selenite\r\nwas attached to some inhabitant of the earth by a tie of sympathy; they\r\nmaintained that the entire vital system is subject to her control, &c.,\r\n&c. But in time the majority renounced these vulgar errors, and espoused\r\nthe true side of the question. As for the Yankees, they had no other\r\nambition than to take possession of this new continent of the sky, and to\r\nplant upon the summit of its highest elevation the star-spangled banner\r\nof the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: BARBICANE HOLDS FORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n   THE HYMN OF THE CANNON-BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Observatory of Cambridge in its memorable letter had treated the\r\nquestion from a purely astronomical point of view. The mechanical part\r\nstill remained.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane had, without loss of time, nominated a Working\r\nCommittee of the Gun Club. The duty of this Committee was to resolve the\r\nthree grand questions of the cannon, the projectile, and the powder. It\r\nwas composed of four members of great technical knowledge, Barbicane (with\r\na casting vote in case of equality), General Morgan, Major Elphinstone,\r\nand J. T. Maston, to whom were confided the functions of secretary. On\r\nthe 8th of October the Committee met at the house of President Barbicane,\r\n3, Republican Street. The meeting was opened by the president himself.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"we have to resolve one of the most important\r\nproblems in the whole of the noble science of gunnery. It might appear,\r\nperhaps, the most logical course to devote our first meeting to the\r\ndiscussion of the engine to be employed. Nevertheless, after mature\r\nconsideration, it has appeared to me that the question of the projectile\r\nmust take precedence of that of the cannon, and that the dimensions of\r\nthe latter must necessarily depend upon those of the former.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suffer me to say a word,\" here broke in J. T. Maston. Permission\r\nhaving been granted, \"Gentlemen,\" said he, with an inspired accent, \"our\r\npresident is right in placing the question of the projectile above all\r\nothers. The ball we are about to discharge at the moon is our ambassador\r\nto her, and I wish to consider it from a moral point of view. The\r\ncannon-ball, gentlemen, to my mind, is the most magnificent manifestation\r\nof human power. If Providence has created the stars and the planets,\r\nman has called the cannon-ball into existence. Let Providence claim\r\nthe swiftness of electricity and of light, of the stars, the comets,\r\nand the planets, of wind and sound—we claim to have invented the\r\nswiftness of the cannon-ball, a hundred times superior to that of the\r\nswiftest horses or railway train. How glorious will be the moment when,\r\ninfinitely exceeding all hitherto attained velocities, we shall launch\r\nour new projectile with the rapidity of seven miles a second! Shall it\r\nnot, gentlemen—shall it not be received up there with the honours due\r\nto a terrestrial ambassador?\"\r\n\r\nOvercome with emotion the orator sat down and applied himself to a huge\r\nplate of sandwiches before him.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Barbicane, \"let us quit the domain of poetry and come\r\ndirect to the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" replied the members, each with his mouth full of sandwich.\r\n\r\n\"The problem before us,\" continued the president, \"is how to communicate\r\nto a projectile a velocity of 12,000 yards per second. Let us at present\r\nexamine the velocities hitherto attained. General Morgan will be able to\r\nenlighten us on this point.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the more easily,\" replied the general, \"that during the war I was\r\na member of the Committee of experiments. I may say, then, that the\r\n100-pounder Dahlgrens, which carried a distance of 5000 yards, impressed\r\nupon their projectile an initial velocity of 500 yards a second. The\r\nRodman Columbiad threw a shot weighing half a ton a distance of six\r\nmiles, with a velocity of 800 yards per second—a result which Armstrong\r\nand Palisser have never obtained in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" replied Barbicane, \"is, I believe, the maximum velocity ever\r\nattained?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so,\" replied the general.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE RODMAN COLUMBIAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" groaned J. T. Maston, \"if my mortar had not burst—\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" quietly replied Barbicane, \"but it did burst. We must take, then,\r\nfor our starting-point this velocity of 800 yards. We must increase it\r\ntwenty-fold. Now, reserving for another discussion the means of producing\r\nthis velocity, I will call your attention to the dimensions which it will\r\nbe proper to assign to the shot. You understand that we have nothing to\r\ndo here with projectiles weighing at most but half a ton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" demanded the major.\r\n\r\n\"Because the shot,\" quickly replied J. T. Maston, \"must be big enough to\r\nattract the attention of the inhabitants of the moon, if there are any?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Barbicane, \"and for another reason more important still.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you?\" asked the major.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that it is not enough to discharge a projectile, and then take\r\nno further notice of it; we must follow it throughout its course, up to\r\nthe moment when it shall reach its goal.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" shouted the general and the major in great surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Barbicane composedly, \"or our experiment would\r\nproduce no result.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then,\" replied the major, \"you will have to give this projectile\r\nenormous dimensions.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! Be so good as to listen. You know that optical instruments have\r\nacquired great perfection; with certain telescopes we have succeeded in\r\nobtaining enlargements of 6000 times and reducing the moon to within forty\r\nmiles' distance. Now, at this distance, any objects sixty feet square\r\nwould be perfectly visible. If, then, the penetrative power of telescopes\r\nhas not been further increased, it is because that power detracts from\r\ntheir light; and the moon, which is but a reflecting mirror, does not\r\ngive back sufficient light to enable us to perceive objects of lesser\r\nmagnitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, what do you propose to do?\" asked the general. \"Would you\r\ngive your projectile a diameter of sixty feet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you intend, then, to increase the luminous power of the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so. If I can succeed in diminishing the density of the atmosphere\r\nthrough which the moon's light has to travel I shall have rendered her\r\nlight more intense. To effect that object it will be enough to establish\r\na telescope on some elevated mountain. That is what we will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give it up,\" answered the major. \"You have such a way of simplifying\r\nthings. And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of 48,000 times, which should bring the moon within an apparent\r\ndistance of five miles; and, in order to be visible, objects need not\r\nhave a diameter of more than nine feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, then,\" cried J. T. Maston, \"our projectile need not be more than\r\nnine feet in diameter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me observe, however,\" interrupted Major Elphinstone, \"this will\r\ninvolve a weight such as—\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear major,\" replied Barbicane, \"before discussing its weight, permit\r\nme to enumerate some of the marvels which our ancestors have achieved in\r\nthis respect. I don't mean to pretend that the science of gunnery has\r\nnot advanced, but it is as well to bear in mind that during the middle\r\nages they obtained results more surprising, I will venture to say, than\r\nours. For instance, during the siege of Constantinople by Mahomet II.,\r\nin 1453, stone shot of 1900 lbs. weight were employed. At Malta, in the\r\ntime of the knights, there was a gun of the fortress of St. Elmo which\r\nthrew a projectile weighing 2500 lbs. And, now, what is the extent of\r\nwhat we have seen ourselves? Armstrong guns discharging shot of 500 lbs.,\r\nand the Rodman guns projectiles of half a ton! It seems, then, that if\r\nprojectiles have gained in range, they have lost far more in weight. Now,\r\nif we turn our efforts in that direction, we ought to arrive, with the\r\nprogress of science, at ten times the weight of the shot of Mahomet II.\r\nand the Knights of Malta.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: CANNON AT MALTA IN THE TIME OF THE KNIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Clearly,\" replied the major; \"but what metal do you calculate upon\r\nemploying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply cast iron,\" said General Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" interrupted the major, \"since the weight of a shot is proportionate\r\nto its volume, an iron ball of nine feet in diameter would be of\r\ntremendous weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if it were solid, not if it were hollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hollow? then it would be a shell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a shell,\" replied Barbicane; \"decidedly it must be. A solid shot of\r\n108 inches would weigh more than 200,000 lbs., a weight evidently far too\r\ngreat. Still, as we must reserve a certain stability for our projectile,\r\nI propose to give it a weight of 20,000 lbs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, will be the thickness of the sides?\" asked the major.\r\n\r\n\"If we follow the usual proportion,\" replied Morgan, \"a diameter of 108\r\ninches would require sides of two feet thickness, or less.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be too much,\" replied Barbicane; \"for you will observe that\r\nthe question is not that of a shot intended to pierce an iron plate: it\r\nwill suffice, therefore, to give it sides strong enough to resist the\r\npressure of the gas. The problem, therefore, is this—What thickness\r\nought a cast-iron shell to have in order not to weigh more than 20,000\r\nlbs.? Our clever secretary will soon enlighten us upon this point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing easier,\" replied the worthy secretary of the Committee; and,\r\nrapidly tracing a few algebraical formulæ upon paper, among which _n_²\r\nand _x_² frequently appeared, he presently said,—\r\n\r\n\"The sides will require a thickness of less than two inches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will that be enough?\" asked the major doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Clearly not!\" replied the president.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done, then?\" said Elphinstone, with a puzzled air.\r\n\r\n\"Employ another metal instead of iron.\"\r\n\r\n\"Copper?\" said Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"No; that would be too heavy. I have better than that to offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" asked the major.\r\n\r\n\"Aluminium!\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Aluminium?\" cried his three colleagues in chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably, my friends. This valuable metal possesses the whiteness\r\nof silver, the indestructibility of gold, the tenacity of iron, the\r\nfusibility of copper, the lightness of glass. It is easily wrought, is\r\nvery widely distributed, forming the base of most of the rocks, is three\r\ntimes lighter than iron, and seems to have been created for the express\r\npurpose of furnishing us with the material for our projectile.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear president,\" said the major, \"is not the cost price of\r\naluminium extremely high?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was so at its first discovery, but it has fallen now to nine dollars\r\nthe pound.\"\r\n\r\n\"But still, nine dollars the pound!\" replied the major, who was not\r\nwilling readily to give in; \"even that is an enormous price.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly, my dear major; but not beyond our reach.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will the projectile weigh then?\" asked Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the result of my calculations,\" replied Barbicane. \"A shot of\r\n108 inches in diameter, and 12 inches in thickness, would weigh, in\r\ncast-iron, 67,440 lbs.; cast in aluminium, its weight will be reduced to\r\n19,250 lbs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" cried the major; \"but do you know that, at nine dollars the\r\npound, this projectile will cost—\"\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and seventy-three thousand and fifty dollars ($173,050).\r\nI know it quite well. But fear not, my friends; the money will not be\r\nwanting for our enterprise, I will answer for it. Now what say you to\r\naluminium, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Adopted!\" replied the three members of the Committee. So ended the first\r\nmeeting. The question of the projectile was definitively settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n   HISTORY OF THE CANNON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolutions passed at the last meeting produced a great effect\r\nout of doors. Timid people took fright at the idea of a shot weighing\r\n20,000 lbs. being launched into space; they asked what cannon could ever\r\ntransmit a sufficient velocity to such a mighty mass. The minutes of the\r\nsecond meeting were destined triumphantly to answer such questions. The\r\nfollowing evening the discussion was renewed.\r\n\r\n\"My dear colleagues,\" said Barbicane, without further preamble, \"the\r\nsubject now before us is the construction of the engine, its length, its\r\ncomposition, and its weight. It is probable that we shall end by giving\r\nit gigantic dimensions; but however great may be the difficulties in the\r\nway, our mechanical genius will readily surmount them. Be good enough,\r\nthen, to give me your attention, and do not hesitate to make objections\r\nat the close. I have no fear of them. The problem before us is how to\r\ncommunicate an initial force of 12,000 yards per second to a shell of 108\r\ninches in diameter, weighing 20,000 lbs. Now when a projectile is launched\r\ninto space, what happens to it? It is acted upon by three independent\r\nforces, the resistance of the air, the attraction of the earth, and the\r\nforce of impulsion with which it is endowed. Let us examine these three\r\nforces. The resistance of the air is of little importance. The atmosphere\r\nof the earth does not exceed forty miles. Now, with the given rapidity,\r\nthe projectile will have traversed this in five seconds, and the period\r\nis too brief for the resistance of the medium to be regarded otherwise\r\nthan as insignificant. Proceeding, then, to the attraction of the earth,\r\nthat is, the weight of the shell, we know that this weight will diminish\r\nin the inverse ratio of the square of the distance. When a body left to\r\nitself falls to the surface of the earth, it falls five feet in the first\r\nsecond; and if the same body were removed 257,542 miles farther off, in\r\nother words, to the distance of the moon, its fall would be reduced to\r\nabout half a line in the first second. That is almost equivalent to a\r\nstate of perfect rest. Our business, then, is to overcome progressively\r\nthis action of gravitation. The mode of accomplishing that is by the\r\nforce of impulsion.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the difficulty,\" broke in the major.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied the president; \"but we will overcome that, for this force\r\nof impulsion will depend upon the length of the engine and the powder\r\nemployed, the latter being limited only by the resisting power of the\r\nformer. Our business, then, to-day is with the dimensions of the cannon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, up to the present time,\" said Barbicane, \"our longest guns have\r\nnot exceeded twenty-five feet in length. We shall therefore astonish the\r\nworld by the dimensions we shall be obliged to adopt. It must evidently\r\nbe, then, a gun of great range, since the length of the piece will\r\nincrease the detention of the gas accumulated behind the projectile; but\r\nthere is no advantage in passing certain limits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said the major. \"What is the rule in such a case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ordinarily the length of a gun is 20 to 25 times the diameter of the\r\nshot, and its weight 235 to 240 times that of the shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not enough,\" cried J. T. Maston impetuously.\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, my good friend; and, in fact, following this proportion\r\nfor a projectile nine feet in diameter, weighing 30,000 lbs., the gun\r\nwould only have a length of 225 feet, and a weight of 7,200,000 lbs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous!\" rejoined Maston. \"As well take a pistol.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so too,\" replied Barbicane; \"that is why I propose to quadruple\r\nthat length, and to construct a gun of 900 feet.\"\r\n\r\nThe general and the major offered some objections; nevertheless, the\r\nproposition, actively supported by the secretary, was definitively\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Elphinstone, \"what thickness must we give it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A thickness of six feet,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"You surely don't think of mounting a mass like that upon a carriage?\"\r\nasked the major.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a superb idea, though,\" said Maston.\r\n\r\n\"But impracticable,\" replied Barbicane. \"No; I think of sinking this\r\nengine in the earth alone, binding it with hoops of wrought iron, and\r\nfinally surrounding it with a thick mass of masonry of stone and cement.\r\nThe piece once cast, it must be bored with great precision, so as to\r\npreclude any possible windage. So there will be no loss whatever of\r\ngas, and all the expansive force of the powder will be employed in the\r\npropulsion.\"\r\n\r\n\"One simple question,\" said Elphinstone: \"is our gun to be rifled?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly not,\" replied Barbicane; \"we require an enormous initial\r\nvelocity; and you are well aware that a shot quits a rifled gun less\r\nrapidly than it does a smooth-bore.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" rejoined the major.\r\n\r\nThe Committee here adjourned for a few minutes to tea and sandwiches.\r\n\r\nOn the discussion being renewed, \"Gentlemen,\" said Barbicane, \"we must\r\nnow take into consideration the metal to be employed. Our cannon must\r\nbe possessed of great tenacity, great hardness, be infusible by heat,\r\nindissoluble, and inoxydable by the corrosive action of acids.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt about that,\" replied the major; \"and as we shall have\r\nto employ an immense quantity of metal, we shall not be at a loss for\r\nchoice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: IDEAL SKETCH OF J. T. MASTON'S GUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Morgan, \"I propose the best alloy hitherto known,\r\nwhich consists of 100 parts of copper, 12 of tin, and 6 of brass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit,\" replied the president, \"that this composition has yielded\r\nexcellent results, but in the present case it would be too expensive, and\r\nvery difficult to work. I think, then, that we ought to adopt a material\r\nexcellent in its way and of low price, such as cast iron. What is your\r\nadvice, major?\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite agree with you,\" replied Elphinstone.\r\n\r\n\"In fact,\" continued Barbicane, \"cast iron cost ten times less than\r\nbronze; it is easy to cast, it runs readily from the moulds of sand,\r\nit is easy of manipulation, it is at once economical of money and of\r\ntime. In addition, it is excellent as a material, and I well remember\r\nthat during the war, at the siege of Atlanta, some iron guns fired one\r\nthousand rounds at intervals of twenty minutes without injury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cast iron is very brittle, though,\" replied Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it possesses great resistance. I will now ask our worthy\r\nsecretary to calculate the weight of a cast-iron gun with a bore of nine\r\nfeet and a thickness of six feet of metal.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a moment,\" replied Maston. Then, dashing off some algebraical formulæ\r\nwith marvellous facility, in a minute or two he declared the following\r\nresult:—\r\n\r\n\"The cannon will weigh 68,040 tons. And, at two cents a pound, it will\r\ncost—?\"\r\n\r\n\"2,510,701 dollars.\"\r\n\r\nMaston, the major, and the general regarded Barbicane with uneasy looks.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" replied the president, \"I repeat what I said yesterday.\r\nMake yourselves easy; the millions will not be wanting.\"\r\n\r\nWith this assurance of their president the Committee separated, after\r\nhaving fixed their third meeting for the following evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n   THE QUESTION OF THE POWDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remained for consideration merely the question of powders.\r\nThe public awaited with interest its final decision. The size of the\r\nprojectile, the length of the cannon being settled, what would be the\r\nquantity of powder necessary to produce impulsion?\r\n\r\nIt is generally asserted that gunpowder was invented in the fourteenth\r\ncentury by the monk Schwartz, who paid for his grand discovery with his\r\nlife. It is, however, pretty well proved that this story ought to be\r\nranked amongst the legends of the middle ages. Gunpowder was not invented\r\nby any one; it was the lineal successor of the Greek fire, which, like\r\nitself, was composed of sulphur and saltpetre. Few persons are acquainted\r\nwith the mechanical power of gunpowder. Now this is precisely what is\r\nnecessary to be understood in order to comprehend the importance of the\r\nquestion submitted to the committee.\r\n\r\nA litre of gunpowder weighs about 2 lbs.; during combustion it produces\r\n400 litres of gas. This gas, on being liberated and acted upon by a\r\ntemperature raised to 2400 degrees, occupies a space of 4000 litres:\r\nconsequently the volume of powder is to the volume of gas produced by\r\nits combustion as 1 to 4000. One may judge, therefore, of the tremendous\r\npressure of this gas when compressed within a space 4000 times too\r\nconfined. All this was, of course, well known to the members of the\r\ncommittee when they met on the following evening.\r\n\r\nThe first speaker on this occasion was Major Elphinstone, who had been\r\nthe director of the gunpowder factories during the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE INVENTION OF GUNPOWDER BY THE MONK SCHWARTZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said this distinguished chemist, \"I begin with some figures\r\nwhich will serve as the basis of our calculation. The old 24-pounder shot\r\nrequired for its discharge 16 lbs. of powder.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are certain of the amount?\" broke in Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Quite certain,\" replied the major. \"The Armstrong cannon employs only\r\n75 lbs. of powder for a projectile of 800 lbs., and the Rodman Columbiad\r\nuses only 160 lbs. of powder to send its half-ton shot a distance of six\r\nmiles. These facts cannot be called in question, for I myself raised the\r\npoint during the depositions taken before the Committee of Artillery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true,\" said the general.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied the major, \"these figures go to prove that the quantity\r\nof powder is not increased with the weight of the shot; that is to say,\r\nif a 24-pounder shot requires 16 lbs. of powder;—in other words, if in\r\nordinary guns we employ a quantity of powder equal to two-thirds of the\r\nweight of the projectile, this proportion is not constant. Calculate,\r\nand you will see that in place of 333 lbs. of powder, the quantity is\r\nreduced to no more than 160 lbs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you aiming at?\" asked the president.\r\n\r\n\"If you push your theory to extremes, my dear major,\" said J. T. Maston,\r\n\"you will get to this, that as soon as your shot becomes sufficiently\r\nheavy you will not require any powder at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our friend Maston is always at his jokes, even in serious matters,\"\r\ncried the major; \"but let him make his mind easy, I am going presently\r\nto propose gunpowder enough to satisfy his artillerist's propensities.\r\nI only keep to statistical facts when I say that during the war, and for\r\nthe very largest guns, the weight of powder was reduced, as the result\r\nof experience, to a tenth part of the weight of the shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly correct,\" said Morgan; \"but before deciding the quantity of\r\npowder necessary to give the impulse, I think it would be as well—\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to employ a large-grained powder,\" continued the major,\r\n\"its combustion is more rapid than that of the small.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt about that,\" replied Morgan, \"but it is very destructive, and\r\nends by enlarging the bore of the pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted; but that which is injurious to a gun destined to perform long\r\nservice is not so to our Columbiad. We shall run no danger of an explosion;\r\nand it is necessary that our powder should take fire instantaneously in\r\norder that its mechanical effect may be complete.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must have,\" said Maston, \"several touch-holes, so as to fire it at\r\ndifferent points at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elphinstone; \"but that will render the working of\r\nthe piece more difficult. I return then to my large-grained powder, which\r\nremoves those difficulties. In his Columbiad charges Rodman employed a\r\npowder as large as chestnuts, made of willow charcoal, simply dried in\r\ncast-iron pans. This powder was hard and glittering, left no trace upon\r\nthe hand, contained hydrogen and oxygen in large proportion, took fire\r\ninstantaneously, and, though very destructive, did not sensibly injure\r\nthe mouth-piece.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this point Barbicane had kept aloof from the discussion; he left\r\nthe others to speak while he himself listened; he had evidently got an\r\nidea. He now simply said, \"Well, my friends, what quantity of powder do\r\nyou propose?\"\r\n\r\nThe three members look at one another.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred thousand pounds,\" at last said Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred thousand,\" added the major.\r\n\r\n\"Eight hundred thousand,\" screamed Maston.\r\n\r\nA moment of silence followed this triple proposal; it was at last broken\r\nby the president.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he quietly said, \"I start from this principle, that the\r\nresistance of a gun, constructed under the given conditions, is unlimited.\r\nI shall surprise our friend Maston, then, by stigmatizing his calculations\r\nas timid; and I propose to double his 800,000 lbs. of powder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixteen hundred thousand pounds?\" shouted Maston, leaping from his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Just so.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to come then to my ideal of a cannon half a mile long; for\r\nyou see 1,600,000 lbs. will occupy a space of about 20,000 cubic feet;\r\nand since the contents of your cannon do not exceed 54,000 cubic feet,\r\nit would be half full; and the bore will not be more than long enough\r\nfor the gas to communicate to the projectile sufficient impulse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the president, \"I hold to that quantity of powder.\r\nNow, 1,600,000 lbs. of powder will create 6,000,000,000 of litres of gas.\r\nSix thousand millions! You quite understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done then?\" said the general.\r\n\r\n\"The thing is very simple; we must reduce this enormous quantity of\r\npowder, while preserving to it its mechanical power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good; but by what means?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to tell you,\" replied Barbicane quietly. \"Nothing is more\r\neasy than to reduce this mass to one quarter of its bulk. You know that\r\ncurious cellular matter which constitutes the elementary tissues of\r\nvegetables? This substance is found quite pure in many bodies, especially\r\nin cotton, which is nothing more than the down of the seeds of the cotton\r\nplant. Now cotton, combined with cold nitric acid, becomes transformed\r\ninto a substance eminently insoluble, combustible, and explosive. It was\r\nfirst discovered in 1832, by Braconnot, a French chemist, who called it\r\nxyloidine. In 1838 another Frenchman, Pelouze, investigated its different\r\nproperties, and finally, in 1846, Schonbein, Professor of Chemistry at\r\nBâle, proposed its employment for purposes of war. This powder, now\r\ncalled pyroxyle, or fulminating cotton, is prepared with great facility\r\nby simply plunging cotton for fifteen minutes in nitric acid, then\r\nwashing it in water, then drying it, and it is ready for use.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could be more simple,\" said Morgan.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, pyroxyle is unaltered by moisture—a valuable property to us,\r\ninasmuch as it would take several days to charge the cannon. It ignites\r\nat 170 degrees in place of 240, and its combustion is so rapid that one\r\nmay set light to it on the top of ordinary powder, without the latter\r\nhaving time to ignite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect!\" exclaimed the major.\r\n\r\n\"Only it is more expensive.\"\r\n\r\n\"What matter?\" cried J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, it imparts to projectiles a velocity four times superior to\r\nthat of gunpowder. I will even add, that if we mix with it one-eighth\r\nof its own weight of nitrate of potass, its expansive force is again\r\nconsiderably augmented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will that be necessary?\" asked the major.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Barbicane. \"So, then, in place of 1,600,000 lbs.\r\nof powder, we shall have but 400,000 lbs. of fulminating cotton; and\r\nsince we can, without danger, compress 500 lbs. of cotton into 27 cubic\r\nfeet, the whole quantity will not occupy a height of more than 180 feet\r\nwithin the bore of the Columbiad. In this way the shot will have more\r\nthan 700 feet of bore to traverse under a force of 6,000,000,000 litres\r\nof gas before taking its flight towards the moon.\"\r\n\r\nAt this junction J. T. Maston could not repress his emotion; he flung\r\nhimself into the arms of his friend with the violence of a projectile,\r\nand Barbicane would have been stove in if he had not been bomb-proof.\r\n\r\nThis incident terminated the third meeting of the Committee.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his bold colleagues, to whom nothing seemed impossible,\r\nhad succeeded in solving the complex problems of projectile, cannon,\r\nand powder. Their plan was drawn up, and it only remained to put it in\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n\"A mere matter of detail, a bagatelle,\" said J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: CAPTAIN NICHOLL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n   ONE ENEMY _v._ TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS OF FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American public took a lively interest in the smallest details of\r\nthe enterprise of the Gun Club. It followed day by day the discussions of\r\nthe committee. The most simple preparation for the great experiment, the\r\nquestions of figures which it involved, the mechanical difficulties to\r\nbe resolved—in one word, the entire plan of work—roused the popular\r\nexcitement to the highest pitch.\r\n\r\nThe purely scientific attraction was suddenly intensified by the following\r\nincident:—\r\n\r\nWe have seen what legions of admirers and friends Barbicane's project\r\nhad rallied round its author. There was, however, one single individual\r\nalone in all the States of the Union who protested against the attempt\r\nof the Gun Club. He attacked it furiously on every opportunity, and human\r\nnature is such that Barbicane felt more keenly the opposition of that one\r\nman than he did the applause of all the others. He was well aware of the\r\nmotive of this antipathy, the origin of this solitary enmity, the cause\r\nof its personality and old standing, and in what rivalry of self-love it\r\nhad its rise.\r\n\r\nThis persevering enemy the President of the Gun Club had never seen.\r\nFortunate that it was so, for a meeting between the two men would\r\ncertainly have been attended with serious consequences. This rival was a\r\nman of science, like Barbicane himself, of a fiery, daring, and violent\r\ndisposition; a pure Yankee. His name was Captain Nicholl; he lived at\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nMost people are aware of the curious struggle which arose during the\r\nFederal war between the guns and the armour of iron-plated ships. The\r\nresult was the entire reconstruction of the navy of both the continents;\r\nas the one grew heavier, the other became thicker in proportion. The\r\n\"Merrimac,\" the \"Monitor,\" the \"Tennessee,\" the \"Weehawken\" discharged\r\nenormous projectiles themselves, after having been armour-clad against\r\nthe projectiles of others. In fact they did to others that which they\r\nwould not they should do to them—that grand principle of immorality\r\nupon which rests the whole art of war.\r\n\r\nNow if Barbicane was a great founder of shot, Nicholl was a great forger\r\nof plates; the one cast night and day at Baltimore, the other forged day\r\nand night at Philadelphia. As soon as ever Barbicane invented a new shot,\r\nNicholl invented a new plate, each followed a current of ideas essentially\r\nopposed to the other. Happily for these citizens, so useful to their\r\ncountry, a distance of from fifty to sixty miles separated them from one\r\nanother, and they had never yet met. Which of these two inventors had\r\nthe advantage over the other it was difficult to decide from the results\r\nobtained. By last accounts, however, it would seem that the armour-plate\r\nwould in the end have to give way to the shot; nevertheless, there were\r\ncompetent judges who had their doubts on the point.\r\n\r\nAt the last experiment the cylindro-conical projectiles of Barbicane stuck\r\nlike so many pins in the Nicholl plates. On that day the Philadelphia\r\niron-forger then believed himself victorious, and could not evince\r\ncontempt enough for his rival; but when the other afterwards substituted\r\nfor conical shot simple 600 lb. shells, at very moderate velocity, the\r\ncaptain was obliged to give in. In fact, these projectiles knocked his\r\nbest metal plate to shivers.\r\n\r\nMatters were at this stage, and victory seemed to rest with the shot,\r\nwhen the war came to an end on the very day when Nicholl had completed\r\na new armour-plate of wrought steel. It was a masterpiece of its kind,\r\nand bid defiance to all the projectiles in the world. The captain had it\r\nconveyed to the Polygon at Washington, challenging the President of the\r\nGun Club to break it. Barbicane, peace having been declared, declined to\r\ntry the experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: NICHOLL PUBLISHED A NUMBER OF LETTERS IN THE\r\n   NEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicholl, now furious, offered to expose his plate to the shock of any\r\nshot, solid, hollow, round, or conical. Refused by the president, who\r\ndid not choose to compromise his last success.\r\n\r\nNicholl, disgusted by this obstinacy, tried to tempt Barbicane by offering\r\nhim every chance. He proposed to fix the plate within two hundred yards\r\nof the gun. Barbicane still obstinate in refusal. A hundred yards? Not\r\neven _seventy-five!_\r\n\r\n\"At fifty then!\" roared the captain through the newspapers. \"At twenty-five\r\nyards!! and I'll stand behind!!!\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane returned for answer that, even if Captain Nicholl would be so\r\ngood as to stand in front, he would not fire any more.\r\n\r\nNicholl could not contain himself at this reply; threw out hints of\r\ncowardice; that a man who refused to fire a cannon-shot was pretty near\r\nbeing afraid of it; that artillerists who fight at six miles' distance\r\nare substituting mathematical formulas for individual courage.\r\n\r\nTo these insinuations Barbicane returned no answer; perhaps he never\r\nheard of them, so absorbed was he in the calculations for his great\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nWhen his famous communication was made to the Gun Club, the captain's\r\nwrath passed all bounds; with his intense jealousy was mingled a feeling\r\nof absolute impotence. How was he to invent anything to beat this 900-feet\r\nColumbiad? What armour-plate could ever resist a projectile of 30,000\r\nlbs. weight? Overwhelmed at first under this violent shock, he by and by\r\nrecovered himself, and resolved to crush the proposal by the weight of\r\nhis arguments.\r\n\r\nHe then violently attacked the labours of the Gun Club, published a\r\nnumber of letters in the newspapers, endeavoured to prove Barbicane\r\nignorant of the first principles of gunnery. He maintained that it was\r\nabsolutely impossible to impress upon any body whatever a velocity of\r\n12,000 yards per second; that even with such a velocity a projectile of\r\nsuch a weight could not transcend the limits of the earth's atmosphere.\r\nFurther still, even regarding the velocity to be acquired, and granting\r\nit to be sufficient, the shell could not resist the pressure of the gas\r\ndeveloped by the ignition of 1,600,000 lbs. of powder; and supposing\r\nit to resist that pressure, it would be the less able to support that\r\ntemperature; it would melt on quitting the Columbiad, and fall back in\r\na red-hot shower upon the heads of the imprudent spectators.\r\n\r\nBarbicane continued his work without regarding these attacks.\r\n\r\nNicholl then took up the question in its other aspects. Without touching\r\nupon its uselessness in all points of view, he regarded the experiment\r\nas fraught with extreme danger, both to the citizens, who might sanction\r\nby their presence so reprehensible a spectacle, and also to the towns\r\nin the neighbourhood of this deplorable cannon. He also observed that\r\nif the projectile did not succeed in reaching its destination (a result\r\nabsolutely impossible), it must inevitably fall back upon the earth,\r\nand that the shock of such a mass, multiplied by the square of its\r\nvelocity, would seriously endanger every point of the globe. Under the\r\ncircumstances, therefore, and without interfering with the rights of free\r\ncitizens, it was a case for the intervention of Government, which ought\r\nnot to endanger the safety of all for the pleasure of one individual.\r\n\r\nSpite of all his arguments, however, Captain Nicholl remained alone in\r\nhis opinion. Nobody listened to him, and he did not succeed in alienating\r\na single admirer from the President of the Gun Club. The latter did not\r\neven take the pains to refute the arguments of his rival.\r\n\r\nNicholl, driven into his last entrenchments, and not able to fight\r\npersonally in the cause, resolved to fight with money. He published,\r\ntherefore, in the _Richmond Inquirer_ a series of wagers, conceived in\r\nthese terms, and on an increasing scale:—\r\n\r\nNo. 1 (1000 dols.).—That the necessary funds for the experiment of the\r\nGun Club will not be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 (2000 dols.).—That the operation of casting a cannon of 900 feet\r\nis impracticable, and cannot possibly succeed.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 (3000 dols.).—That it is impossible to load the Columbiad, and\r\nthat the pyroxyle will take fire spontaneously under the pressure of the\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 (4000 dols.).—That the Columbiad will burst at the first fire.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 (5000 dols.).—That the shot will not travel farther than six\r\nmiles, and that it will fall back again a few seconds after its discharge.\r\n\r\nIt was an important sum, therefore, which the captain risked in his\r\ninvincible obstinacy. He had no less than 15,000 dollars at stake.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the importance of the challenge, on the 19th of May\r\nhe received a sealed packet containing the following superbly laconic\r\nreply:—\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Baltimore, _Oct._ 19.\r\n\r\n   \"Done.\r\n\r\n   \"Barbicane.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n   FLORIDA AND TEXAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne question yet remained to be decided: it was necessary to choose\r\na favourable spot for the experiment. According to the advice of the\r\nObservatory of Cambridge, the gun must be fired perpendicularly to the\r\nplane of the horizon, that is to say, towards the zenith. Now the moon\r\ndoes not traverse the zenith, except in places situated between 0° and\r\n28° of latitude. It became, then, necessary to determine exactly that\r\nspot on the globe where the immense Columbiad should be cast.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October, at a general meeting of the Gun Club, Barbicane\r\nproduced a magnificent map of the United States. \"Gentlemen,\" said he,\r\nin opening the discussion, \"I presume that we are all agreed that this\r\nexperiment cannot and ought not to be tried anywhere but within the\r\nlimits of the soil of the Union. Now, by good fortune, certain frontiers\r\nof the United States extend downwards as far as the 28th parallel of the\r\nnorth latitude. If you will cast your eye over this map, you will see\r\nthat we have at our disposal the whole of the southern portion of Texas\r\nand Florida.\"\r\n\r\nIt was finally agreed, then, that the Columbiad must be cast on the soil\r\nof either Texas or Florida. The result, however, of this decision was to\r\ncreate a rivalry entirely without precedent between the different towns\r\nof these two states.\r\n\r\nThe 28th parallel, on reaching the American coast, traverses the peninsula\r\nof Florida, dividing it into two nearly equal portions. Then, plunging\r\ninto the Gulf of Mexico, it subtends the arc formed by the coast of\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana; then skirting Texas, off which it\r\ncuts an angle, it continues its course over Mexico, crosses the Sonora,\r\nOld California, and loses itself in the Pacific Ocean. It was, therefore,\r\nonly those portions of Texas and Florida which were situated below this\r\nparallel which came within the prescribed conditions of latitude.\r\n\r\nFlorida, in its southern part, reckons no cities of importance; it is\r\nsimply studded with forts raised against the roving Indians. One solitary\r\ntown, Tampa Town, was able to put in a claim in favour of its situation.\r\n\r\nIn Texas, on the contrary, the towns are much more numerous and important.\r\nCorpus Christi, in the county of Nuaces, and all the cities situated on\r\nthe Rio Bravo, Laredo, Comalites, San Ignacio on the Web, Rio Grande City\r\non the Starr, Edinburgh in the Hidalgo, Santa Rita, Elpanda, Brownsville\r\nin the Cameron, formed an imposing league against the pretensions of\r\nFlorida. So, scarcely was the decision known, when the Texan and Floridan\r\ndeputies arrived at Baltimore in an incredibly short space of time. From\r\nthat very moment President Barbicane and the influential members of the\r\nGun Club were besieged day and night by formidable claims. If seven cities\r\nof Greece contended for the honour of having given birth to Homer, here\r\nwere two entire states threatening to come to blows about the question\r\nof a cannon.\r\n\r\nThe rival parties promenaded the streets with arms in their hands; and at\r\nevery occasion of their meeting a collision was to be apprehended which\r\nmight have been attended with disastrous results. Happily the prudence\r\nand address of President Barbicane averted the danger. These personal\r\ndemonstrations found a division in the newspapers of the different\r\nstates. The _New York Herald_ and the _Tribune_ supported Texas, while\r\nthe _Times_ and the _American Review_ espoused the cause of the Floridan\r\nDeputies. The members of the Gun Club could not decide to which to give\r\nthe preference.\r\n\r\nTexas produced its array of twenty-six counties; Florida replied that\r\ntwelve counties were better than twenty-six in a country only one-sixth\r\npart of the size.\r\n\r\nTexas plumed itself upon its 330,000 natives; Florida with a far smaller\r\nterritory, boasted of being much more densely populated with 56,000.\r\n\r\nThe Texians, through the columns of the _Herald_, claimed that some regard\r\nshould be had to a state which grew the best cotton in all America,\r\nproduced the best green oak for the service of the navy, and contained\r\nthe finest oil, besides iron mines, in which the yield was fifty per\r\ncent. of pure metal.\r\n\r\nTo this the _American Review_ replied that the soil of Florida, although\r\nnot equally rich, afforded the best conditions for the moulding and\r\ncasting of the Columbiad, consisting as it did of sand and argillaceous\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"That may be all very well,\" replied the Texians; \"but you must first\r\nget to this country. Now the communications with Florida are difficult,\r\nwhile the coast of Texas offers the bay of Galveston, which possesses\r\na circumference of fourteen leagues, and is capable of containing the\r\nnavies of the entire world!\"\r\n\r\n\"A pretty notion truly,\" replied the papers in the interest of Florida,\r\n\"that of Galveston Bay _below the 29th parallel!_ Have _we_ not got the\r\nbay of Espiritu Santo, opening precisely upon _the_ 28_th degree_, and\r\nby which ships can reach Tampa Town by direct route?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fine bay! half choked with sand!\" \"Choked yourselves!\" returned the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThus the war went on for several days, when Florida endeavoured to draw\r\nher adversary away on to fresh ground; and one morning the _Times_ hinted\r\nthat, the enterprise being essentially American, it ought not to be\r\nattempted upon other than purely American territory.\r\n\r\nTo these words Texas retorted, \"American! are we not as much so as you?\r\nWere not Texas and Florida both incorporated into the Union in 1845?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: IT BECAME NECESSARY TO KEEP AN EYE UPON THE DEPUTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied the _Times_; \"but we have belonged to the Americans\r\never since 1820.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" returned the _Tribune_; \"after having been Spaniards or English\r\nfor 200 years, you were sold to the United States for five million\r\ndollars!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! and why need we blush for that? Was not Louisiana bought from\r\nNapoleon in 1803 at the price of sixteen million dollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scandalous!\" roared the Texan deputies. \"A wretched little strip of\r\ncountry like Florida to dare to compare itself to Texas, who, in place\r\nof selling herself, asserted her own independence, drove out the Mexicans\r\nin March 2, 1836, and declared herself a federal republic after the\r\nvictory gained by Samuel Houston, on the banks of the San Jacinto, over\r\nthe troops of Santa Anna!—a country, in fine, which voluntarily annexed\r\nitself to the United States of America!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; because it was afraid of the Mexicans!\" replied Florida.\r\n\r\n\"Afraid!\" From this moment the state of things became intolerable. A\r\nsanguinary encounter seemed daily imminent between the two parties in\r\nthe streets of Baltimore. It became necessary to keep an eye upon the\r\ndeputies.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane knew not which way to look. Notes, documents,\r\nletters full of menaces showered down upon his house. Which side ought\r\nhe to take? As regarded the appropriation of the soil, the facility of\r\ncommunication, the rapidity of transport, the claims of both states were\r\nevenly balanced. As for political prepossessions, they had nothing to do\r\nwith the question.\r\n\r\nThis dead block had existed for some little time, when Barbicane resolved\r\nto get rid of it at once. He called a meeting of his colleagues, and\r\nlaid before them a proposition which, it will be seen, was profoundly\r\nsagacious.\r\n\r\n\"On carefully considering,\" he said, \"what is going on now between Florida\r\nand Texas, it is clear that the same difficulties will recur with all\r\nthe towns of the favoured state. The rivalry will descend from state to\r\ncity, and so on downwards. Now Texas possesses _eleven_ towns within the\r\nprescribed conditions, which will further dispute the honour and create\r\nus new enemies, while Florida has only _one._ I go in, therefore, for\r\nFlorida and Tampa Town.\"\r\n\r\nThis decision, on being made known, utterly crushed the Texan deputies.\r\nSeized with an indescribable fury, they addressed threatening letters to\r\nthe different members of the Gun Club by name. The magistrates had but\r\none course to take, and they took it. They chartered a special train,\r\nforced the Texians into it whether they would or no; and they quitted\r\nthe city with a speed of thirty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nQuickly, however, as they were despatched, they found time to hurl one\r\nlast and bitter sarcasm at their adversaries.\r\n\r\nAlluding to the extent of Florida, a mere peninsula confined between\r\ntwo seas, they pretended that it could never sustain the shock of the\r\ndischarge, and that it would \"bust up\" at the very first shot.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, let it bust up!\" replied the Floridans, with a brevity worthy\r\nof the days of ancient Sparta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n   URBI ET ORBI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe astronomical, mechanical, and topographical difficulties resolved,\r\nfinally came the question of finance. The sum required was far too great\r\nfor any individual, or even any single state, to provide the requisite\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane undertook, despite of the matter being a purely\r\nAmerican affair, to render it one of universal interest, and to request\r\nthe financial co-operation of all peoples. It was, he maintained, the\r\nright and the duty of the whole earth to interfere in the affairs of its\r\nsatellite. The subscription opened at Baltimore extended properly to the\r\nwhole world—_Urbi et orbi._\r\n\r\nThis subscription was successful beyond all expectation; notwithstanding\r\nthat it was a question not of _lending_ but of _giving_ the money. It\r\nwas a purely disinterested operation in the strictest sense of the term,\r\nand offered not the slightest chance of profit.\r\n\r\nThe effect, however, of Barbicane's communication was not confined to\r\nthe frontiers of the United States; it crossed the Atlantic and Pacific,\r\ninvading simultaneously Asia and Europe, Africa and Oceania. The\r\nobservatories of the Union placed themselves in immediate communication\r\nwith those of foreign countries. Some, such as those of Paris, Petersburg,\r\nBerlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Malta, Lisbon, Benares, Madras, and others,\r\ntransmitted their good wishes; the rest maintained a prudent silence,\r\nquietly awaiting the result. As for the observatory at Greenwich, seconded\r\nas it was by the twenty-two astronomical establishments of Great Britain,\r\nit spoke plainly enough. It boldly denied the possibility of success,\r\nand pronounced in favour of the theories of Captain Nicholl. But this\r\nwas nothing more than mere English jealousy.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of October President Barbicane published a manifesto full of\r\nenthusiasm, in which he made an appeal to \"all persons of good will upon\r\nthe face of the earth.\" This document, translated into all languages,\r\nmet with immense success.\r\n\r\nSubscription lists were opened in all the principal cities of the Union,\r\nwith a central office at the Baltimore Bank, 9, Baltimore Street.\r\n\r\nIn addition, subscriptions were received at the following banks in the\r\ndifferent states of the two continents:—\r\n\r\nAt Vienna, with S. M. de Rothschild.\r\n„ Petersburg, Stieglitz and Co.\r\n„ Paris, The Crédit Mobilier.\r\n„ Stockholm, Tottie and Arfuredson.\r\n„ London, N. M. Rothschild and Son.\r\n„ Turin, Ardouin and Co.\r\n„ Berlin, Mendelssohn.\r\n„ Geneva, Lombard, Odier, and Co.\r\n„ Constantinople, The Ottoman Bank.\r\n„ Brussels, J. Lambert.\r\n„ Madrid, Daniel Weisweller.\r\n„ Amsterdam, Netherlands Credit Co.\r\n„ Rome, Torlonia and Co.\r\n„ Lisbon, Lecesne.\r\n„ Copenhagen, Private Bank.\r\n„ Rio Janeiro, do.\r\n„ Monte Video, do.\r\n„ Valparaiso and Lima, Thomas la Chambre and Co.    „ Mexico, Martin\r\nDaran and Co.\r\n\r\nThree days after the manifesto of President Barbicane 4,000,000 of dollars\r\nwere paid into the different towns of the Union. With such a balance\r\nthe Gun Club might begin operations at once. But some days later advices\r\nwere received to the effect that the foreign subscriptions were being\r\neagerly taken up. Certain countries distinguished themselves by their\r\nliberality; others untied their purse-strings with less facility—matter\r\nof temperament. Figures are, however, more eloquent than words, and here\r\nis the official statement of the sums which were paid in to the credit\r\nof the Gun Club at the close of the subscription.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE SUBSCRIPTION WAS OPENED.\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia paid in as her contingent the enormous sum of 368,733 roubles.\r\nNo one need be surprised at this, who bears in mind the scientific taste\r\nof the Russians, and the impetus which they have given to astronomical\r\nstudies—thanks to their numerous observatories.\r\n\r\nFrance began by deriding the pretensions of the Americans. The moon\r\nserved as a pretext for a thousand stale puns and a score of ballads,\r\nin which bad taste contested the palm with ignorance. But as formerly\r\nthe French paid before singing, so now they paid after having had their\r\nlaugh, and they subscribed for a sum of 1,253,930 francs. At that price\r\nthey had a right to enjoy themselves a little.\r\n\r\nAustria showed herself generous in the midst of her financial crisis. Her\r\npublic contributions amounted to the sum of 216,000 florins—a perfect\r\ngodsend.\r\n\r\n52,000 rix-dollars were the remittance of Sweden and Norway; the amount\r\nis large for the country, but it would undoubtedly have been considerably\r\nincreased had the subscription been opened in Christiania simultaneously\r\nwith that at Stockholm. For some reason or other the Norwegians do not\r\nlike to send their money to Sweden.\r\n\r\nPrussia, by a remittance of 250,000 thalers, testified her high approval\r\nof the enterprise.\r\n\r\nTurkey behaved generously; but she had a personal interest in the matter.\r\nThe moon, in fact, regulates the cycle of her years and her fast of\r\nRamadan. She could not do less than give 1,372,640 piastres; and she gave\r\nthem with an eagerness which denoted, however, some pressure on the part\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\nBelgium distinguished herself among the second-rate states by a grant of\r\n513,000 francs—about two centimes per head of her population.\r\n\r\nHolland and her colonies interested themselves to the extent of 110,000\r\nflorins, only demanding an allowance of five per cent, discount for\r\npaying ready money.\r\n\r\nDenmark, a little contracted in territory, gave nevertheless 9000 ducats,\r\nproving her love for scientific experiments.\r\n\r\nThe Germanic Confederation pledged itself to 34,285 florins. It was\r\nimpossible to ask for more; besides, they would not have given it.\r\n\r\nThough very much crippled, Italy found 200,000 lire in the pockets of\r\nher people. If she had had Venetia she would have done better; but she\r\nhad not.\r\n\r\nThe States of the Church thought that they could not send less than\r\n7040 Roman crowns; and Portugal carried her devotion to science as far\r\nas 30,000 cruzados. It was the widow's mite—eighty-six piastres; but\r\nself-constituted empires are always rather short of money.\r\n\r\n257 francs, this was the modest contribution of Switzerland to the\r\nAmerican work. One must freely admit that she did not see the practical\r\nside of the matter. It did not seem to her that the mere despatch of a\r\nshot to the moon could possibly establish any relation of affairs with\r\nher; and it did not seem prudent to her to embark her capital in so\r\nhazardous an enterprise. After all, perhaps she was right.\r\n\r\nAs to Spain, she could not scrape together more than 110 reals. She\r\ngave as an excuse that she had her railways to finish. The truth is,\r\nthat science is not favourably regarded in that country, it is still\r\nin a backward state; and moreover, certain Spaniards, not by any means\r\nthe least educated, did not form a correct estimate of the bulk of the\r\nprojectile compared with that of the moon. They feared that it would\r\ndisturb the established order of things. In that case it were better to\r\nkeep aloof; which they did to the tune of some reals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE MANUFACTORY AT COLDSPRING, NEAR NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remained but England; and we know the contemptuous antipathy with\r\nwhich she received Barbicane's proposition. The English have but one\r\nsoul for the whole twenty-six millions of inhabitants which Great Britain\r\ncontains. They hinted that the enterprise of the Gun Club was contrary to\r\nthe \"principle of non-intervention.\" And they did not subscribe a single\r\nfarthing.\r\n\r\nAt this intimation the Gun Club merely shrugged its shoulders and\r\nreturned to its great work. When South America, that is to say, Peru,\r\nChili, Brazil, the provinces of La Plata and Columbia, had poured forth\r\ntheir quota into their hands, the sum of 300,000 dollars, it found itself\r\nin possession of a considerable capital, of which the following is a\r\nstatement:—\r\n\r\nUnited States subscriptions . . 4,000,000 dollars.\r\nForeign subscriptions    . . . . 1,446,675 „\r\n\r\n                                 —————————\r\nTotal,                           5,446,675 „\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the sum which the public poured into the treasury of the Gun\r\nClub.\r\n\r\nLet no one be surprised at the vastness of the amount. The work of\r\ncasting, boring, masonry, the transport of workmen, their establishment\r\nin an almost uninhabited country, the construction of furnaces and\r\nworkshops, the plant, the powder, the projectile, and incidental expenses,\r\nwould, according to the estimates, absorb nearly the whole. Certain\r\ncannon shots in the Federal war cost 1000 dollars a-piece. This one of\r\nPresident Barbicane, unique in the annals of gunnery, might well cost\r\nfive thousand times more.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October a contract was entered into with the manufactory\r\nat Coldspring, near New York, which during the war had furnished the\r\nlargest Parrott cast-iron guns. It was stipulated between the contracting\r\nparties that the manufactory of Coldspring should engage to transport\r\nto Tampa Town, in southern Florida, the necessary materials for casting\r\nthe Columbiad. The work was bound to be completed at latest by the 15th\r\nof October following, and the cannon delivered in good condition under\r\npenalty of a forfeit of 100 dollars a day to the moment when the moon\r\nshould again present herself under the same conditions—that is to say,\r\nin eighteen years and eleven days.\r\n\r\nThe engagement of the workmen, their pay, and all the necessary details\r\nof the work, devolved upon the Goldspring Company.\r\n\r\nThis contract, executed in duplicate, was signed by Barbicane, President\r\nof the Gun Club, of the one part, and T. Murphison, director of the\r\nColdspring manufactory, of the other, who thus executed the deed on\r\nbehalf of their respective principals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n   STONES HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the decision was arrived at by the Gun Club, to the disparagement of\r\nTexas, every one in America, where reading is an universal acquirement,\r\nset to work to study the geography of Florida. Never before had there\r\nbeen such a sale for works like _Bertram's Travels in Florida, Roman's\r\nNatural History of East and West Florida, William's Territory of Florida,_\r\nand _Cleland on the Cultivation of the Sugar-Cane in Florida._ It became\r\nnecessary to issue fresh editions of these works.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had something better to do than to read. He desired to see\r\nthings with his own eyes, and to mark the exact position of the proposed\r\ngun. So, without a moment's loss of time, he placed at the disposal of\r\nthe Cambridge Observatory the funds necessary for the construction of a\r\ntelescope, and entered into negotiations with the house of Breadwill and\r\nCo., of Albany, for the construction of an aluminium projectile of the\r\nrequired size. He then quitted Baltimore, accompanied by J. T. Maston,\r\nMajor Elphinstone, and the manager of the Coldspring Factory.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the four fellow-travellers arrived at New Orleans.\r\nThere they immediately embarked on board the \"Tampico,\" a despatch-boat\r\nbelonging to the Federal navy, which the Government had placed at their\r\ndisposal; and, getting up steam, the banks of the Louisiana speedily\r\ndisappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nThe passage was not long. Two days after starting, the \"Tampico,\"\r\nhaving made four hundred and eighty miles, came in sight of the coast of\r\nFlorida. On a nearer approach Barbicane found himself in view of a low,\r\nflat country of somewhat barren aspect. After coasting along a series of\r\ncreeks abounding in lobsters and oysters, the \"Tampico\" entered the bay\r\nof Espiritu Santo, where she finally anchored in a small natural harbour,\r\nformed by the _embouchure_ of the River Hillisborough, at seven p.m., on\r\nthe 22d October.\r\n\r\nOur four passengers disembarked at once. \"Gentlemen,\" said Barbicane,\r\n\"we have no time to lose; tomorrow we must obtain horses, and proceed to\r\nreconnoitre the country.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane had scarcely set his foot on shore when three thousand of the\r\ninhabitants of Tampa Town came forth to meet him, an honour due to the\r\npresident who had signalized their country by his choice.\r\n\r\nDeclining, however, every kind of ovation, Barbicane ensconced himself\r\nin a room of the Franklin Hotel.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow some of those small horses of the Spanish breed, full of\r\nvigour and of fire, stood snorting under his windows; but instead of\r\n_four_ steeds, here were _fifty,_ together with their riders. Barbicane\r\ndescended with his three fellow-travellers; and much astonished were they\r\nall to find themselves in the midst of such a cavalcade. He remarked that\r\nevery horseman carried a carbine slung across his shoulders and pistols\r\nin his holsters.\r\n\r\nOn expressing his surprise at these preparations, he was speedily\r\nenlightened by a young Floridan, who quietly said,—\r\n\r\n\"Sir, there are Seminoles there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by Seminoles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Savages who scour the prairies. We thought it best, therefore, to escort\r\nyou on your road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" cried J. T. Maston, mounting his steed.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the Floridan; \"but it is true enough, nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" answered Barbicane, \"I thank you for your kind attention;\r\nbut it is time to be off.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: TAMPA TOWN PREVIOUS TO THE UNDERTAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was five a.m. when Barbicane and his party, quitting Tampa Town,\r\nmade their way along the coast in the direction of Alifia Creek. This\r\nlittle river falls into Hillisborough Bay twelve miles above Tampa Town.\r\nBarbicane and his escort coasted along its right bank to the eastward.\r\nSoon the waves of the bay disappeared behind a bend of rising ground,\r\nand the Floridan \"champagne\" alone offered itself to view.\r\n\r\nFlorida, discovered on Palm Sunday, in 1512, by Juan Ponce de Leon, was\r\noriginally named _Pascha Florida_. It little deserved that designation\r\nwith its dry and parched coasts. But after some few miles of tract the\r\nnature of the soil gradually changes and the country shows itself worthy\r\nof the name. Cultivated plains soon appear, where are united all the\r\nproductions of the northern and tropical floras, terminating in prairies\r\nabounding with pineapples and yams, tobacco, rice, cotton-plants, and\r\nsugar-canes, which extend beyond reach of sight, flinging their riches\r\nbroadcast with careless prodigality.\r\n\r\nBarbicane appeared highly pleased on observing the progressive elevation\r\nof the land; and in answer to a question of J. T. Maston, replied,—\r\n\r\n\"My worthy friend, we cannot do better than sink our Columbiad in these\r\nhigh grounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"To get nearer to the moon, perhaps?\" said the secretary of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" replied Barbicane, smiling; \"do you not see that amongst\r\nthese elevated plateaus we shall have a much easier work of it? No\r\nstruggles with the water-springs, which will save us long and expensive\r\ntubings; and we shall be working in daylight instead of down a deep and\r\nnarrow well. Our business, then, is to open our trenches upon ground some\r\nhundreds of yards above the level of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, sir,\" struck in Murchison, the engineer; \"and, if I\r\nmistake not, we shall ere long find a suitable spot for our purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we were at the first stroke of the pickaxe,\" said the president.\r\n\r\n\"And I wish we were at the _last_,\" cried J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\nAbout ten a.m. the little band had crossed a dozen miles. To fertile\r\nplains succeeded a region of forests. There perfumes of the most varied\r\nkinds mingled together in tropical profusion. These almost impenetrable\r\nforests were composed of pomegranates, orange-trees, citrons, figs,\r\nolives, apricots, bananas, huge vines, whose blossoms and fruits rivalled\r\neach other in colour and perfume. Beneath the odorous shade of these\r\nmagnificent trees fluttered and warbled a little world of brilliantly\r\nplumaged birds.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston and the major could not repress their admiration on finding\r\nthemselves in presence of the glorious beauties of this wealth of\r\nnature. President Barbicane, however, less sensitive to these wonders,\r\nwas in haste to press forward; the very luxuriance of the country was\r\ndispleasing to him. They hastened onwards, therefore, and were compelled\r\nto ford several rivers, not without danger, for they were infested with\r\nhuge alligators from fifteen to eighteen feet long. Maston courageously\r\nmenaced them with his steel hook, but he only succeeded in frightening\r\nsome pelicans and teal, while tall flamingos stared stupidly at the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAt length these denizens of the swamps disappeared in their turn; smaller\r\ntrees became thinly scattered among less dense thickets—a few isolated\r\ngroups detached in the midst of endless plains over which ranged herds\r\nof startled deer.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" cried Barbicane, rising in his stirrups, \"here we are at the\r\nregion of pines!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! and of savages too,\" replied the major.\r\n\r\nIn fact, some Seminoles had just come in sight upon the horizon; they\r\nrode violently backwards and forwards on their fleet horses, brandishing\r\ntheir spears or discharging their guns with a dull report. These hostile\r\ndemonstrations, however, had no effect upon Barbicane and his companions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THEY WERE COMPELLED TO FORD SEVERAL RIVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were then occupying the centre of a rocky plain, which the sun\r\nscorched with its parching rays. This was formed by a considerable\r\nelevation of the soil, which seemed to offer to the members of the Gun\r\nClub all the conditions requisite for the construction of their Columbiad.\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" said Barbicane, reining up. \"Has this place any local appellation?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is called Stones Hill,\" replied one of the Floridans.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, without saying a word, dismounted, seized his instruments,\r\nand began to note his position with extreme exactness. The little band,\r\ndrawn up in rear, watched his proceedings in profound silence.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the sun passed the meridian. Barbicane, after a few\r\nmoments, rapidly wrote down the result of his observations, and said,—\r\n\r\n\"This spot is situated 1800 feet above the level of the sea, in 27° 7'\r\nN. lat. and 5° 7' W. long. of the meridian of Washington. It appears\r\nto me by its rocky and barren character to offer all the conditions\r\nrequisite for our experiment. On that plain will be raised our magazines,\r\nworkshops, furnaces, and workmen's huts; and here, from this very spot,\"\r\nsaid he, stamping his foot on the summit of Stones Hill, \"hence shall\r\nour projectile take its flight into the regions of the Solar\r\nWorld.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n   PICKAXE AND TROWEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same evening Barbicane and his companions returned to Tampa Town;\r\nand Murchison, the engineer, re-embarked on board the \"Tampico\" for New\r\nOrleans. His object was to enlist an army of workmen, and to collect\r\ntogether the greater part of the materials. The members of the Gun Club\r\nremained at Tampa Town, for the purpose of setting on foot the preliminary\r\nworks by the aid of the people of the country.\r\n\r\nEight days after its departure, the \"Tampico\" returned into the bay\r\nof Espiritu Santo, with a whole flotilla of steamboats. Murchison had\r\nsucceeded in assembling together fifteen hundred artisans. Attracted\r\nby the high pay and considerable bounties offered by the Gun Club, he\r\nhad enlisted a choice legion of stokers, iron-founders, lime-burners,\r\nminers, brickmakers, and artisans of every trade, without distinction of\r\ncolour. As many of these people brought their families with them, their\r\ndeparture resembled a perfect emigration.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st October, at ten o'clock in the morning, the troop disembarked\r\non the quays of Tampa Town; and one may imagine the activity which\r\npervaded that little town, whose population was thus doubled in a single\r\nday.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few days they were busy discharging the cargo brought\r\nby the flotilla, the machines, and the rations, as well as a large number\r\nof huts constructed of iron plates, separately pieced and numbered. At\r\nthe same period Barbicane laid the first sleepers of a railway fifteen\r\nmiles in length intended to unite Stones Hill with Tampa Town. On the\r\nfirst of November Barbicane quitted Tampa Town with a detachment of\r\nworkmen; and on the following day the whole town of huts was erected\r\nround Stones Hill. This they enclosed with palisades; and in respect of\r\nenergy and activity, it might have shortly been mistaken for one of the\r\ngreat cities of the Union. Everything was placed under a complete system\r\nof dicipline, and the works were commenced in most perfect order.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the soil having been carefully examined, by means of\r\nrepeated borings, the work of excavation was fixed for the 4th of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nOn that day Barbicane called together his foremen and addressed them as\r\nfollows:—\"You are well aware, my friends, of the object with which I\r\nhave assembled you together in this wild part of Florida. Our business\r\nis to construct a cannon measuring nine feet in its interior diameter,\r\nsix feet thick, and with a stone revetment of nineteen and a half feet\r\nin thickness. We have, therefore, a well of sixty feet in diameter\r\nto dig down to a depth of nine hundred feet. This great work must be\r\ncompleted _within eight months,_ so that you have 2,543,400 cubic feet\r\nof earth to excavate in 255 days; that is to say, in round numbers, 2000\r\ncubic feet per day. That which would present no difficulty to a thousand\r\nnavvies working in open country will be of course more troublesome in\r\na comparatively confined space. However, the thing must be done, and\r\nI reckon for its accomplishment upon your courage as much as upon your\r\nskill.\"\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock in the morning the first stroke of the pickaxe was\r\nstruck upon the soil of Florida; and from that moment that prince of\r\ntools was never inactive for one moment in the hands of the excavators.\r\nThe gangs relieved each other every three hours.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of November fifty workmen commenced digging, in the very\r\ncentre of the enclosed space on the summit of Stones Hill, a circular\r\nhole sixty feet in diameter. The pickaxe first struck upon a kind of\r\nblack earth, six inches in thickness, which was speedily disposed of.\r\nTo this earth succeeded two feet of fine sand, which was carefully laid\r\naside as being valuable for serving for the casting of the inner mould.\r\nAfter the sand appeared some compact white clay, resembling the chalk\r\nof Great Britain, which extended down to a depth of four feet. Then the\r\niron of the picks struck upon the hard bed of the soil; a kind of rock\r\nformed of petrified shells, very dry, very solid, and which the picks\r\ncould with difficulty penetrate. At this point the excavation exhibited\r\na depth of six feet and a half and the work of the masonry was begun.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of this excavation they constructed a wheel of oak, a kind\r\nof circle strongly bolted together, and of immense strength. The centre\r\nof this wooden disc was hollowed out to a diameter equal to the exterior\r\ndiameter of the Columbiad. Upon this wheel rested the first layers of\r\nthe masonry, the stones of which were bound together by hydraulic cement,\r\nwith irresistible tenacity. The workmen, after laying the stones from\r\nthe circumference to the centre, were thus enclosed within a kind of\r\nwell twenty-one feet in diameter. When this work was accomplished, the\r\nminers resumed their picks and cut away the rock from underneath the\r\n_wheel_ itself, taking care to support it as they advanced upon blocks\r\nof great thickness. At every two feet which the hole gained in depth they\r\nsuccessively withdrew the blocks. The _wheel_ then sank little by little,\r\nand with it the massive ring of masonry, on the upper bed of which the\r\nmasons laboured incessantly, always reserving some vent holes to permit\r\nthe escape of gas during the operation of casting.\r\n\r\nThis kind of work required on the part of the workmen extreme nicety and\r\nminute attention. More than one, in digging underneath the wheel, was\r\ndangerously injured by the splinters of stone. But their ardour never\r\nrelaxed, night or day. By day they worked under the rays of the scorching\r\nsun; by night, under the gleam of the electric light. The sounds of\r\nthe picks against the rock, the bursting of mines, the grinding of the\r\nmachines, the wreaths of smoke scattered through the air, traced around\r\nStones Hill a circle of terror which the herds of buffaloes and the war\r\nparties of the Seminoles never ventured to pass. Nevertheless, the works\r\nadvanced regularly, as the steam-cranes actively removed the rubbish.\r\nOf unexpected obstacles there was little account; and with regard to\r\nforeseen difficulties, they were speedily disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE WORK PROGRESSED REGULARLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of the first month the well had attained the depth\r\nassigned for that lapse of time, viz. 112 feet. This depth was doubled\r\nin December, and trebled in January.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of February the workmen had to contend with a sheet of\r\nwater which made its way right across the outer soil. It became necessary\r\nto employ very powerful pumps and compressed engines to drain it off,\r\nso as to close up the orifice from whence it issued; just as one stops\r\na leak on board ship. They at last succeeded in getting the upper hand\r\nof these untoward streams; only, in consequence of the loosening of the\r\nsoil, the wheel partly gave way, and a slight partial settlement ensued.\r\nThis accident cost the life of several workmen.\r\n\r\nNo fresh occurrence thenceforward arrested the progress of the operation;\r\nand on the 10th of June, twenty days before the expiration of the period\r\nfixed by Barbicane, the well, lined throughout with its facing of stone,\r\nhad attained the depth of 900 feet. At the bottom the masonry rested upon\r\na massive block measuring thirty feet in thickness, whilst on the upper\r\nportion it was level with the surrounding soil.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane and the members of the Gun Club warmly congratulated\r\ntheir engineer Murchison: the cyclopean work had been accomplished with\r\nextraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nDuring these eight months Barbicane never quitted Stones Hill for a\r\nsingle instant. Keeping ever close by the work of excavation, he busied\r\nhimself incessantly with the welfare and health of his workpeople, and\r\nwas singularly fortunate in warding off the epidemics common to large\r\ncommunities of men, and so disastrous in those regions of the globe which\r\nare exposed to the influences of tropical climates.\r\n\r\nMany workmen, it is true, paid with their lives for the rashness inherent\r\nin these dangerous labours; but these mishaps are impossible to be\r\navoided, and they are classed amongst details with which the Americans\r\ntrouble themselves but little. They have in fact more regard for human\r\nnature in general than for the individual in particular.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Barbicane professed opposite principles to these, and\r\nput them in force at every opportunity. So, thanks to his care, his\r\nintelligence, his useful intervention in all difficulties, his prodigious\r\nand humane sagacity, the average of accidents did not exceed that of\r\ntransatlantic countries, noted for their excessive precautions, France,\r\nfor instance, among others, where they reckon about one accident for\r\nevery two hundred thousand francs of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n   THE FÊTE OF THE CASTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the eight months which were employed in the work of excavation\r\nthe preparatory works of the casting had been carried on simultaneously\r\nwith extreme rapidity. A stranger arriving at Stones Hill would have been\r\nsurprised at the spectacle offered to his view.\r\n\r\nAt 600 yards from the well, and circularly arranged around it as a central\r\npoint, rose 1200 reverberating ovens, each six feet in diameter, and\r\nseparated from each other by an interval of three feet. The circumference\r\noccupied by these 1200 ovens presented a length of two miles. Being all\r\nconstructed on the same plan, each with its high quadrangular chimney,\r\nthey produced a most singular effect.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that on their third meeting the Committee had\r\ndecided to use cast-iron for the Columbiad, and in particular the _white_\r\ndescription. This metal in fact is the most tenacious, the most ductile,\r\nand the most malleable, and consequently suitable for all moulding\r\noperations; and when smelted with pit coal, is of superior quality for\r\nall engineering works requiring great resisting power, such as cannon,\r\nsteam-boilers, hydraulic presses, and the like.\r\n\r\nCast-iron, however, if subjected to only one single fusion, is rarely\r\nsufficiently homogeneous; and it requires a second fusion completely to\r\nrefine it by dispossessing it of its last earthly deposits. So before\r\nbeing forwarded to Tampa Town, the iron ore, molten in the great furnaces\r\nof Coldspring, and brought into contact with coal and silicium heated to\r\na high temperature, was carburized and transformed into cast-iron. After\r\nthis first operation, the metal was sent on to Stones Hill. They had,\r\nhowever, to deal with 136,000,000 lbs. of iron, a quantity far too costly\r\nto send by railway. The cost of transport would have been double that of\r\nmaterial. It appeared preferable to freight vessels at New York, and to\r\nload them with the iron in bars. This, however, required not less than\r\nsixty-eight vessels of 1000 tons, a veritable fleet, which, quitting New\r\nYork on the 3rd of May, on the 10th of the same month ascended the Bay\r\nof Espiritu Santo, and discharged their cargoes, without dues, in the\r\nport at Tampa Town. Thence the iron was transported by rail to Stones\r\nHill, and about the middle of January this enormous mass of metal was\r\ndelivered at its destination.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily understood that 1200 furnaces were not too many to\r\nmelt simultaneously these 60,000 tons of iron. Each of these furnaces\r\ncontained nearly 140,000 lbs. weight of metal. They were all built after\r\nthe model of those which served for the casting of the Rodman gun, they\r\nwere trapezoidal in shape, with a high elliptical arch. These furnaces,\r\nconstructed of fireproof brick, were especially adapted for burning\r\npit coal, with a flat bottom upon which the iron bars were laid. This\r\nbottom, inclined at an angle of 25°, allowed the metal to flow into the\r\nreceiving troughs; and the 1200 converging trenches carried the molten\r\nmetal down to the central well.\r\n\r\nThe day following that on which the works of the masonry and boring had\r\nbeen completed, Barbicane set to work upon the central mould. His object\r\nnow was to raise within the centre of the well, and with a coincident\r\naxis, a cylinder 900 feet high, and 9 feet in diameter, which should\r\nexactly fill up the space reserved for the bore of the Columbiad. This\r\ncylinder was composed of a mixture of clay and sand, with the addition of\r\na little hay and straw. The space left between the mould and the masonry\r\nwas intended to be filled up by the molten metal, which would thus form\r\nthe walls six feet in thickness. This cylinder, in order to maintain its\r\nequilibrium, had to be bound by iron bands, and firmly fixed at certain\r\nintervals by cross-clamps fastened into the stone lining; after the\r\ncastings these would be buried in the block of metal, leaving no external\r\nprojection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE CASTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis operation was completed on the 8th of July, and the run of the metal\r\nwas fixed for the following day.\r\n\r\n\"This fête of the casting will be a grand ceremony,\" said J. T. Maston\r\nto his friend Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Barbicane; \"but it will not be a public fête.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! will you not open the gates of the enclosure to all comers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must be very careful, Maston. The casting of the Columbiad is an\r\nextremely delicate, not to say a dangerous operation, and I should prefer\r\nits being done privately. At the discharge of the projectile, a fête if\r\nyou like—till then, no!\"\r\n\r\nThe president was right. The operation involved unforeseen dangers, which\r\na great influx of spectators would have hindered him from averting. It was\r\nnecessary to preserve complete freedom of movement. No one was admitted\r\nwithin the enclosure except a delegation of members of the Gun Club,\r\nwho had made the voyage to Tampa Town. Among these was the brisk Bilsby,\r\nTom Hunter, Colonel Blomsberry, Major Elphinstone, General Morgan, and\r\nthe rest of the lot to whom the casting of the Columbiad was a matter\r\nof personal interest. J. T. Maston became their cicerone. He omitted no\r\npoint of detail; he conducted them throughout the magazines, workshops,\r\nthrough the midst of the engines, and compelled them to visit the whole\r\n1200 furnaces one after the other. At the end of the twelve-hundredth\r\nvisit they were pretty well knocked up.\r\n\r\nThe casting was to take place at 12 o'clock precisely. The previous\r\nevening each furnace had been charged with 114,000 lbs. weight of metal\r\nin bars disposed cross-ways to each other, so as to allow the hot air\r\nto circulate freely between them. At daybreak the 1200 chimneys vomited\r\ntheir torrents of flame into the air, and the ground was agitated with\r\ndull tremblings. As many pounds of metal as there were to _cast_, so many\r\npounds of coal were there to _burn_. Thus there were 68,000 tons of coal\r\nwhich projected in the face of the sun a thick curtain of smoke. The heat\r\nsoon became insupportable within the circle of furnaces, the rumbling of\r\nwhich resembled the rolling of thunder. The powerful ventilators added\r\ntheir continuous blasts and saturated with oxygen the glowing plates. The\r\noperation, to be successful, required to be conducted with great rapidity.\r\nOn a signal given by a cannon-shot each furnace was to give vent to the\r\nmolten iron and completely to empty itself. These arrangements made,\r\nforemen and workmen waited the preconcerted moment with an impatience\r\nmingled with a certain amount of emotion. Not a soul remained within the\r\nenclosure. Each superintendent took his post by the aperture of the run.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his colleagues, perched on a neighbouring eminence,\r\nassisted at the operation. In front of them was a piece of artillery\r\nready to give fire on the signal from the engineer. Some minutes before\r\nmidday the first driblets of metal began to flow; the reservoirs filled\r\nlittle by little; and, by the time that the whole melting was completely\r\naccomplished, it was kept in abeyance for a few minutes in order to\r\nfacilitate the separation of foreign substances.\r\n\r\nTwelve o'clock struck! A gunshot suddenly pealed forth and shot its\r\nflame into the air. Twelve hundred melting-troughs were simultaneously\r\nopened and twelve hundred fiery serpents crept towards the central\r\nwell, unrolling their incandescent curves. There, down they plunged\r\nwith a terrific noise into a depth of 900 feet. It was an exciting and\r\na magnificent spectacle. The ground trembled, while these molten waves,\r\nlaunching into the sky their wreaths of smoke, evaporated the moisture\r\nof the mould and hurled it upwards through the vent-holes of the stone\r\nlining in the form of dense vapour-clouds. These artificial clouds\r\nunrolled their thick spirals to a height of 1000 yards into the air.\r\nA savage, wandering somewhere beyond the limits of the horizon, might\r\nhave believed that some new crater was forming in the bosom of Florida,\r\nalthough there was neither any eruption, nor typhoon, nor storm, nor\r\nstruggle of the elements, nor any of those terrible phenomena which\r\nnature is capable of producing. No, it was man alone who had produced\r\nthese reddish vapours, these gigantic flames worthy of a volcano itself,\r\nthese tremendous vibrations resembling the shock of an earthquake, these\r\nreverberations rivalling those of hurricanes and storms; and it was his\r\nhand which precipitated into an abyss, dug by himself, a whole Niagara\r\nof molten metal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n   THE COLUMBIAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the casting succeeded? They were reduced to mere conjecture. There\r\nwas indeed every reason to expect success, since the mould had absorbed\r\nthe entire mass of the molten metal; still some considerable time must\r\nelapse before they could arrive at any certainty upon the matter.\r\n\r\nThe patience of the members of the Gun Club was sorely tried during this\r\nperiod of time. But they could do nothing. J. T. Maston escaped roasting\r\nby a miracle. Fifteen days after the casting an immense column of smoke\r\nwas still rising in the open sky and the ground burnt the soles of the\r\nfeet within a radius of 200 feet round the summit of Stones Hill. It was\r\nimpossible to approach nearer. All they could do was to wait with what\r\npatience they might.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are at the 10th August,\" exclaimed J. T. Maston one morning,\r\n\"only four months to the 1st of December! We shall never be ready in\r\ntime!\" Barbicane said nothing, but his silence covered serious irritation.\r\n\r\nHowever, daily observations revealed a certain change going on in the\r\nstate of the ground. About the 15th August the vapours ejected had\r\nsensibly diminished in intensity and thickness. Some days afterwards the\r\nearth exhaled only a slight puff of smoke, the last breath of the monster\r\nenclosed within its circle of stone. Little by little the belt of heat\r\ncontracted, until on the 22d August Barbicane, his colleagues, and the\r\nengineer were enabled to set foot on the iron sheet which lay level upon\r\nthe summit of Stones Hill.\r\n\r\n\"At last!\" exclaimed the President of the Gun Club, with an immense sigh\r\nof relief.\r\n\r\nThe work was resumed the same day. They proceeded at once to extract the\r\ninterior mould, for the purpose of clearing out the boring of the piece.\r\nPickaxes and boring irons were set to work without intermission. The\r\nclayey and sandy soils had acquired extreme hardness under the action of\r\nthe heat; but by the aid of the machines, the rubbish on being dug out\r\nwas rapidly carted away on railway waggons; and such was the ardour of\r\nthe work, so persuasive the arguments of Barbicane's dollars, that by\r\nthe 3rd of September all traces of the mould had entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nImmediately the operation of boring was commenced; and by the aid of\r\npowerful machines, a few weeks later, the inner surface of the immense\r\ntube had been rendered perfectly cylindrical, and the bore of the piece\r\nhad acquired a thorough polish.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 22nd of September, less than a twelvemonth after\r\nBarbicane's original proposition, the enormous weapon, accurately bored,\r\nand exactly vertically pointed, was ready for work. There was only the\r\nmoon now to wait for; and they were pretty sure that she would not fail\r\nin the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe ecstacy of J. T. Maston knew no bounds, and he narrowly escaped a\r\nfrightful fall while staring down the tube. But for the strong hand of\r\nColonel Blomsberry, the worthy secretary, like a modern Erostratus, would\r\nhave found his death in the depths of the Columbiad.\r\n\r\nThe cannon was then finished; there was no possible doubt as to its\r\nperfect completion. So, on the 6th of October, Captain Nicholl opened\r\nan account between himself and President Barbicane, in which he debited\r\nhimself to the latter in the sum of 2000 dollars. One may believe that\r\nthe Captain's wrath was increased to its highest point, and must have\r\nmade him seriously ill. However, he had still three bets of three, four,\r\nand five thousand dollars, respectively; and if he gained two out of\r\nthese, his position would not be very bad. But the money question did\r\nnot enter into his calculations; it was the success of his rival in\r\ncasting a cannon against which iron plates sixty feet thick would have\r\nbeen ineffectual, that dealt him a terrible blow.\r\n\r\nAfter the 23rd of September the enclosure of Stones Hill was thrown open\r\nto the public; and it will be easily imagined what was the concourse of\r\nvisitors to this spot! There was an incessant flow of people to and from\r\nTampa Town and the place, which resembled a procession, or rather, in\r\nfact, a pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nIt was already clear to be seen that, on the day of the experiment itself,\r\nthe aggregate of spectators would be counted by millions; for they were\r\nalready arriving from all parts of the earth upon this narrow strip of\r\npromontory. Europe was emigrating to America.\r\n\r\nUp to that time, however, it must be confessed, the curiosity of the\r\nnumerous comers was but scantily gratified. Most had counted upon\r\nwitnessing the spectacle of the casting, and they were treated to\r\nnothing but smoke. This was sorry food for hungry eyes; but Barbicane\r\nwould admit no one to that operation. Then ensued grumbling, discontent,\r\nmurmurs; they blamed the President, taxed him with dictatorial conduct.\r\nHis proceedings were declared \"un-American.\" There was very nearly a\r\nriot round Stones Hill; but Barbicane remained inflexible. When, however,\r\nthe Columbiad was entirely finished, this state of closed doors could\r\nno longer be maintained; besides it would have been bad taste, and even\r\nimprudence, to affront the public feeling. Barbicane, therefore, opened\r\nthe enclosure to all comers; but, true to his practical disposition, he\r\ndetermined to coin money out of the public curiosity.\r\n\r\nIt was something, indeed, to be enabled to contemplate this immense\r\nColumbiad; but to descend into its depths, this seemed to the Americans\r\nthe _ne plus ultra_ of earthly felicity. Consequently, there was not\r\none curious spectator who was not willing to give himself the treat of\r\nvisiting the interior of this metallic abyss. Baskets suspended from\r\nsteam-cranes permitted them to satisfy their curiosity. There was a\r\nperfect mania. Women, children, old men, all made it a point of duty to\r\npenetrate the mysteries of the colossal gun. The fare for the descent was\r\nfixed at five dollars per head; and despite this high charge, during the\r\ntwo months which preceded the experiment, the influx of visitors enabled\r\nthe Gun Club to pocket nearly 500,000 dollars!\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: TAMPA TOWN AFTER THE UNDERTAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the first visitors of the Columbiad were the\r\nmembers of the Gun Club. This privilege was justly reserved for that\r\nillustrious body. The ceremony took place on the 25th September. A basket\r\nof honour took down the President, J. T. Maston, Major Elphinstone,\r\nGeneral Morgan, Colonel Blomsberry, and other members of the club, to\r\nthe number of ten in all. How hot it was at the bottom of that long tube\r\nof metal! They were half suffocated. But what delight! What ecstasy! A\r\ntable had been laid with six covers on the massive stone which formed\r\nthe bottom of the Columbiad, and lighted by a jet of electric light\r\nresembling that of day itself. Numerous exquisite dishes, which seemed\r\nto descend from heaven, were placed successively before the guests, and\r\nthe richest wines of France flowed in profusion during this splendid\r\nrepast, served nine hundred feet beneath the surface of the earth!\r\n\r\nThe festival was animated, not to say somewhat noisy. Toasts flew\r\nbackwards and forwards. They drank to the earth and to her satellite, to\r\nthe Gun Club, the Union, the moon, Diana, Phœbe, Selene, the \"peaceful\r\ncourier of the night\"! All the hurrahs, carried upwards upon the sonorous\r\nwaves of the immense acoustic tube, arrived with the sound of thunder\r\nat its mouth; and the multitude ranged round Stones Hill heartily united\r\ntheir shouts with those of the ten revellers hidden from view at the\r\nbottom of the gigantic Columbiad.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston was no longer master of himself. Whether he shouted or\r\ngesticulated, ate or drank most, would be a difficult matter to determine.\r\nAt all events, he would not have given his place up for an empire, \"not\r\neven if the cannon—loaded, primed, and fired at that very moment—were\r\nto blow him in pieces into the planetary world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE BANQUET IN THE COLUMBIAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n   A TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great works undertaken by the Gun Club had now virtually come to an\r\nend; and two months still remained before the day for the discharge of\r\nthe shot to the moon. To the general impatience these two months appeared\r\nas long as years! Hitherto the smallest details of the operation had been\r\ndaily chronicled by the journals, which the public devoured with eager\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment a circumstance, the most unexpected, the most\r\nextraordinary and incredible, occurred to rouse afresh their panting\r\nspirits, and to throw every mind into a state of the most violent\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nOne day, the 30th September, at 3.47 p.m., a telegram, transmitted by\r\ncable from Valentia (Ireland) to Newfoundland and the American mainland,\r\narrived at the address of President Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThe President tore open the envelope, read the despatch, and, despite\r\nhis remarkable powers of self-control, his lips turned pale and his eyes\r\ngrew dim, on reading the twenty words of this telegram.\r\n\r\nHere is the text of the despatch, which figures now in the archives of\r\nthe Gun Club:—\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"France, Paris,\r\n\r\n   \"30 _September_, 4 _a.m._\r\n\r\n   \"Barbicane, Tampa Town, Florida, United States.\r\n\r\n   \"Substitute for your spherical shell a cylindro-conical projectile.\r\n    I shall go inside. Shall arrive by steamer 'Atlanta.'\r\n\r\n   \"Michel Ardan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n   THE PASSENGER OF THE \"ATLANTA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this astounding news, instead of flying through the electric wires,\r\nhad simply arrived by post in the ordinary sealed envelope, Barbicane\r\nwould not have hesitated a moment. He would have held his tongue about\r\nit, both as a measure of prudence, and in order not to have to reconsider\r\nhis plans. This telegram might be a cover for some jest, especially as\r\nit came from a Frenchman. What human being would ever have conceived the\r\nidea of such a journey? and, if such a person really existed, he must be\r\nan idiot, whom one would shut up in a lunatic ward, rather than within\r\nthe walls of the projectile.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the despatch, however, speedily became known; for\r\nthe telegraphic officials possessed but little discretion, and Michel\r\nArdan's proposition ran at once throughout the several States of the\r\nUnion. Barbicane had, therefore, no further motive for keeping silence.\r\nConsequently, he called together such of his colleagues as were at the\r\nmoment in Tampa Town, and without any expression of his own opinions\r\nsimply read to them the laconic text itself. It was received with every\r\npossible variety of expressions of doubt, incredulity, and derision from\r\nevery one, with the exception of J. T. Maston, who exclaimed, \"It is a\r\ngrand idea, however!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Barbicane originally proposed to send a shot to the moon every one\r\nlooked upon the enterprise as simple and practicable enough—a mere\r\nquestion of gunnery; but when a person, professing to be a reasonable\r\nbeing, offered to take passage within the projectile, the whole thing\r\nbecame a farce, or, in plainer language a _humbug._\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: PRESIDENT BARBICANE AT HIS WINDOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne question, however, remained. Did such a being exist? This telegram\r\nflashed across the depths of the Atlantic, the designation of the vessel\r\non board which he was to take his passage, the date assigned for his\r\nspeedy arrival, all combined to impart a certain character of reality to\r\nthe proposal. They must get some clearer notion of the matter. Scattered\r\ngroups of inquirers at length condensed themselves into a compact crowd,\r\nwhich made straight for the residence of President Barbicane. That worthy\r\nindividual was keeping quiet with the intention of watching events as they\r\narose. But he had forgotten to take into account the public impatience;\r\nand it was with no pleasant countenance that he watched the population\r\nof Tampa Town gathering under his windows. The murmurs and vociferations\r\nbelow presently obliged him to appear. He came forward, therefore, and\r\non silence being procured, a citizen put point-blank to him the following\r\nquestion:—\"Is the person mentioned in the telegram, under the name of\r\nMichel Ardan, on his way here? Yes or no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied Barbicane, \"I know no more than you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must know,\" roared the impatient voices.\r\n\r\n\"Time will show,\" calmly replied the President.\r\n\r\n\"Time has no business to keep a whole country in suspense,\" replied the\r\norator. \"Have you altered the plans of the projectile according to the\r\nrequest of the telegram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, gentlemen; but you are right! we must have better information\r\nto go by. The telegraph must complete its information.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the telegraph!\" roared the crowd.\r\n\r\nBarbicane descended; and heading the immense assemblage, led the way to\r\nthe telegraph office. A few minutes later a telegram was despatched to\r\nthe secretary of the underwriters at Liverpool, requesting answers to\r\nthe following queries:—\r\n\r\n\"About the ship 'Atlanta'—when did she leave Europe? Had she on board\r\na Frenchman named Michel Ardan?\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterwards Barbicane received information too exact to leave\r\nroom for the smallest remaining doubt.\r\n\r\n\"The steamer 'Atlanta' from Liverpool put to sea on the 2nd October,\r\nbound for Tampa Town, having on board a Frenchman borne on the list of\r\npassengers by the name of Michel Ardan.\"\r\n\r\nThat very evening he wrote to the house of Breadwill and Co., requesting\r\nthem to suspend the casting of the projectile until the receipt of\r\nfurther orders. On the 20th October, at 9 a.m., the semaphores of the\r\nBahama Canal signalled a thick smoke on the horizon. Two hours later a\r\nlarge steamer exchanged signals with them. The name of the Atlanta flew\r\nat once over Tampa Town. At four o'clock the English vessel entered the\r\nBay of Espiritu Santo. At five it crossed the passage of Hillisborough\r\nBay at full steam. At six she cast anchor at Port Tampa. The anchor had\r\nscarcely caught the sandy bottom when 500 boats surrounded the \"Atlanta,\"\r\nand the steamer was taken by assault. Barbicane was the first to set foot\r\non deck, and in a voice of which he vainly tried to conceal the emotion,\r\ncalled \"Michel Ardan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" replied an individual perched on the poop.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, with arms crossed, looked fixedly at the passenger of the\r\n\"Atlanta.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a man of about 42 years of age, of large build, but slightly\r\nround-shouldered. His massive head momentarily shook a shock of reddish\r\nhair, which resembled a lion's mane. His face was short with a broad\r\nforehead, and furnished with a moustache as bristly as a cat's, and little\r\npatches of yellowish whisker upon full cheeks. Round, wildish eyes,\r\nslightly near-sighted, completed a physiognomy essentially _feline._ His\r\nnose was firmly shaped, his mouth particularly sweet in expression, high\r\nforehead, intelligent and furrowed with wrinkles like a newly-ploughed\r\nfield. The body was powerfully developed and firmly fixed upon long legs.\r\nMuscular arms, and a general air of decision gave him the appearance of\r\na hardy, jolly companion. He was dressed in a suit of ample dimensions,\r\nloose neckerchief, open shirt-collar, disclosing a robust neck; his cuffs\r\nwere invariably unbuttoned, through which appeared a pair of red hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: MICHEL ARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the bridge of the steamer, in the midst of the crowd, he bustled to\r\nand fro, never still for a moment, \"dragging his anchors,\" as the sailors\r\nsay, gesticulating, making free with everybody, biting his nails with\r\nnervous avidity. He was one of those originals which nature sometimes\r\ninvents in the freak of a moment, and of which she then breaks the mould.\r\n\r\nAmongst other peculiarities, this curiosity gave himself out for a\r\nsublime ignoramus, \"like Shakespeare,\" and professed supreme contempt\r\nfor all scientific men. Those \"fellows,\" as he called them, \"are only\r\nfit to mark the points, while we play the game.\" He was, in fact, a\r\nthorough Bohemian, adventurous, but not an adventurer; a hair-brained\r\nfellow, a kind of Icarus, only possessing relays of wings. For the rest,\r\nhe was ever in scrapes, ending invariably by falling on his feet, like\r\nthose little pith figures which they sell for children's toys. In two\r\nwords, his motto was \"I have my opinions,\" and the love of the impossible\r\nconstituted his ruling passion.\r\n\r\nSuch was the passenger of the \"Atlanta,\" always excitable, as if boiling\r\nunder the action of some internal fire by the character of his physical\r\norganization. If ever two individuals offered a striking contrast to each\r\nother, these were certainly Michel Ardan and the Yankee Barbicane; both,\r\nmoreover, being equally enterprising and daring, each in his own way.\r\n\r\nThe scrutiny which the President of the Gun Club had instituted regarding\r\nthis new rival was quickly interrupted by the shouts and hurrahs of the\r\ncrowd. The cries became at last so uproarious, and the popular enthusiasm\r\nassumed so personal a form, that Michel Ardan, after having shaken hands\r\nsome thousands of times, at the imminent risk of leaving his fingers\r\nbehind him, was fain at last to make a bolt for his cabin.\r\n\r\nBarbicane followed him without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n\"You are Barbicane, I suppose?\" said Michel Ardan in a tone of voice in\r\nwhich he would have addressed a friend of twenty years' standing.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the President of the G. C.\r\n\r\n\"All right! how d'ye do, Barbicane? how are you getting on—pretty well?\r\nthat's right.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Barbicane without further preliminary, \"you are quite\r\ndetermined to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite decided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will stop you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. Have you modified your projectile according to my telegram.\"\r\n\r\n\"I waited for your arrival. But,\" asked Barbicane again, \"have you\r\ncarefully reflected?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reflected? have I any time to spare? I find an opportunity of making a\r\ntour in the moon, and I mean to profit by it. There is the whole gist of\r\nthe matter.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane looked hard at this man who spoke so lightly of his project\r\nwith such complete absence of anxiety. \"But, at least,\" said he, \"you\r\nhave some plans, some means of carrying your project into execution?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, my dear Barbicane; only permit me to offer one remark:—My\r\nwish is to tell my story once for all, to everybody, and then to have\r\ndone with it; then there will be no need for recapitulation. So, if you\r\nhave no objection, assemble your friends, colleagues, the whole town,\r\nall Florida, all America if you like, and to-morrow I shall be ready to\r\nexplain my plans and answer any objections whatever that may be advanced.\r\nYou may rest assured I shall wait without stirring. Will that suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\nSo saying, the President left the cabin and informed the crowd of the\r\nproposal of Michel Ardan. His words were received with clappings of hands\r\nand shouts of joy. They had removed all difficulties. To-morrow every\r\none would contemplate at his ease this European hero. However, some of\r\nthe spectators, more infatuated than the rest, would not leave the deck\r\nof the \"Atlanta.\" They passed the night on board. Amongst others, J.\r\nT. Maston got his hook fixed in the combing of the poop, and it pretty\r\nnearly required the capstan to get it out again.\r\n\r\n\"He is a hero! a hero!\" he cried, a theme of which he was never tired of\r\nringing the changes; \"and we are only like weak, silly women, compared\r\nwith this European!\"\r\n\r\nAs to the president, after having suggested to the visitors it was time\r\nto retire, he re-entered the passenger's cabin, and remained there till\r\nthe bell of the steamer made it midnight.\r\n\r\nBut then the two rivals in popularity shook hands heartily and parted on\r\nterms of intimate friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n   A MONSTER MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day Barbicane, fearing that indiscreet questions might\r\nbe put to Michel Ardan, was desirous of reducing the number of the\r\naudience to a few of the initiated, his own colleagues for instance. He\r\nmight as well have tried to check the Falls of Niagara! He was compelled,\r\ntherefore, to give up the idea, and to let his new friend run the chances\r\nof a public conference. The place chosen for this monster meeting was a\r\nvast plain situated in the rear of the town. In a few hours, thanks to the\r\nhelp of the shipping in port, an immense roofing of canvas was stretched\r\nover the parched prairie, and protected it from the burning rays of the\r\nsun. There 300,000 people braved for many hours the stifling heat while\r\nawaiting the arrival of the Frenchman. Of this crowd of spectators a first\r\nset could both see and hear; a second set saw badly and heard nothing\r\nat all; and as for the third, it could neither see nor hear anything at\r\nall. At three o'clock Michel Ardan made his appearance, accompanied by\r\nthe principal members of the Gun Club. He was supported on his right by\r\nPresident Barbicane, and on his left by J. T. Maston, more radiant than\r\nthe midday sun and nearly as ruddy. Ardan mounted a platform, from the\r\ntop of which his view extended over a sea of black hats. He exhibited not\r\nthe slightest embarrassment; he was just as gay, familiar, and pleasant\r\nas if he were at home. To the hurrahs which greeted him he replied by\r\na graceful bow; then, waving his hand to request silence, he spoke in\r\nperfectly correct English as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, despite the very hot weather I request your patience for a\r\nshort time while I offer some explanations regarding the projects which\r\nseem to have so interested you. I am neither an orator nor a man of\r\nscience, and I had no idea of addressing you in public; but my friend\r\nBarbicane has told me that you would like to hear me, and I am quite at\r\nyour service. Listen to me, therefore, with your 600,000 ears, and please\r\nto excuse the faults of the speaker. Now pray do not forget that you see\r\nbefore you a perfect ignoramus whose ignorance goes so far that he cannot\r\neven understand the difficulties! It seemed to him that it was a matter\r\nquite simple, natural, and easy to take one's place in a projectile and\r\nstart for the moon! That journey must be undertaken sooner or later;\r\nand, as for the mode of locomotion adopted, it follows simply the law of\r\nprogress. Man began by walking on all-fours; then, one fine day, on two\r\nfeet; then in a carriage; then in a stage-coach; and lastly by railway.\r\nWell, the projectile is the vehicle of the future, and the planets\r\nthemselves are nothing else! Now some of you, gentlemen, may imagine that\r\nthe velocity we propose to impart to it is extravagant. It is nothing\r\nof the kind. All the stars exceed it in rapidity, and the earth herself\r\nis at this moment carrying us round the sun at three times as rapid a\r\nrate, and yet she is a mere lounger on the way compared with many others\r\nof the planets! And her velocity is constantly _decreasing._ Is it not\r\nevident, then, I ask you, that there will some day appear velocities far\r\ngreater than these, of which light or electricity will probably be the\r\nmechanical agent?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, gentlemen,\" continued the orator, \"in spite of the opinions of\r\ncertain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon\r\nthis globe, as within some magic circle which it must never outstep, we\r\nshall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the\r\nsame facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from\r\nLiverpool to New York! Distance is but a relative expression, and must\r\nend by being reduced to zero.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly, strongly predisposed as they were in favour of the French\r\nhero, were slightly staggered at this bold theory. Michel Ardan perceived\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he continued with a pleasant smile, \"you do not seem quite\r\nconvinced. Very good! Let us reason the matter out. Do you know how long\r\nit would take for an _express train_ to reach the moon? Three hundred\r\ndays; no more! And what is that? The distance is no more than nine times\r\nthe circumference of the earth; and there are no sailors or travellers,\r\nof even moderate activity, who have not made longer journeys than that\r\nin their lifetime. And now consider that I shall be only ninety-seven\r\nhours on my journey. Ah! I see you are reckoning that the moon is a long\r\nway off from the earth, and that one must think twice before making the\r\nexperiment. What would you say, then, if we were talking of going to\r\nNeptune, which revolves at a distance of more than two thousand seven\r\nhundred and twenty millions of miles from the sun! And yet what is that\r\ncompared with the distance of the fixed stars, some of which, such as\r\nArcturus, are at billions of miles distant from us? And then you talk\r\nof the _distance_ which separates the planets from the sun! And there\r\nare people who affirm that such a thing as distance exists. Absurdity,\r\nfolly, idiotic nonsense! Would you know what I think of our own solar\r\nuniverse? Shall I tell you my theory? It is very simple! In my opinion\r\nthe solar system is a solid, homogeneous body; the planets which compose\r\nit are in _actual contact_ with each other; and whatever space exists\r\nbetween them is nothing more than the space which separates the molecules\r\nof the densest metal, such as silver, iron, or platinum! I have the\r\nright, therefore, to affirm, and I repeat, with the conviction which must\r\npenetrate all your minds, 'Distance is but an empty name; distance does\r\nnot really exist!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried one voice (need it be said it was that of J. T. Maston?).\r\n\"Distance does not exist!\" And overcome by the energy of his movements,\r\nhe nearly fell from the platform to the ground. He just escaped a severe\r\nfall, which would have proved to him that distance was by no means _an\r\nempty name._\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: PROJECTILE TRAINS FOR THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" resumed the orator, \"I repeat that the distance between the\r\nearth and her satellite is a mere trifle, and undeserving of serious\r\nconsideration. I am convinced that before twenty years are over one half\r\nof our earth will have paid a visit to the moon. Now, my worthy friends,\r\nif you have any question to put to me, you will, I fear, sadly embarrass\r\na poor man like myself; still I will do my best to answer you.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this point the President of the Gun Club had been satisfied with the\r\nturn which the discussion had assumed. It became now, however, desirable\r\nto divert Ardan from questions of a practical nature, with which he was\r\ndoubtless far less conversant. Barbicane, therefore, hastened to get in\r\na word, and began by asking his new friend whether he thought that the\r\nmoon and the planets were inhabited.\r\n\r\n\"You put before me a great problem, my worthy President,\" replied the\r\norator, smiling. \"Still, men of great intelligence, such as Plutarch,\r\nSwedenborg, Bernardin de St. Pierre, and others have, if I mistake not,\r\npronounced in the affirmative. Looking at the question from the natural\r\nphilosopher's point of view, I should say that _nothing useless_ existed\r\nin the world; and, replying to your question by another, I should venture\r\nto assert, that if these worlds are _habitable_, they either are, have\r\nbeen, or will be inhabited.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one could answer more logically or fairly,\" replied the president.\r\n\"The question then reverts to this: _Are_ these worlds habitable? For my\r\nown part I believe they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"For myself, I feel certain of it,\" said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" retorted one of the audience, \"there are many arguments\r\n_against_ the habitability of the worlds. The conditions of life must\r\nevidently be greatly modified upon the majority of them. To mention\r\nonly the planets, we should be either broiled alive in some, or frozen\r\nto death in others, according as they are more or less removed from the\r\nsun.\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"that I have not the honour of personally\r\nknowing my contradictor, for I would have attempted to answer him. His\r\nobjection has its merits, I admit; but I think we may successfully combat\r\nit, as well as all others which affect the habitability of the other\r\nworlds. If I were a _natural philosopher,_ I would tell him that if less\r\nof caloric were _set in motion_ upon the planets which are nearest to\r\nthe sun, and more, on the contrary, upon those which are farthest removed\r\nfrom it, this simple fact would alone suffice to equalize the heat, and\r\nto render the temperature of those worlds supportable by beings organized\r\nlike ourselves. If I were a _naturalist_, I would tell him that, according\r\nto some illustrious men of science, nature has furnished us with instances\r\nupon the earth of animals existing under very varying conditions of life;\r\nthat fish respire in a medium fatal to other animals; that amphibious\r\ncreatures possess a double existence very difficult of explanation; that\r\ncertain denizens of the seas maintain life at enormous depths, and there\r\nsupport a pressure equal to that of fifty or sixty atmospheres without\r\nbeing crushed; that several aquatic insects, insensible to temperature,\r\nare met with equally among boiling springs and in the frozen plains\r\nof the Polar Sea; in fine, that we cannot help recognizing in nature a\r\ndiversity of means of operation oftentimes incomprehensible, but not the\r\nless real. If I were a _chemist_, I would tell him that the aerolites,\r\nbodies evidently formed exteriorly of our terrestrial globe, have, upon\r\nanalysis, revealed indisputable traces of carbon, a substance which\r\nowes its origin solely to organized beings, and which, according to the\r\nexperiments of Reichenbach, must necessarily itself have been _endued\r\nwith animation._ And lastly, were I a theologian, I would tell him that\r\nthe scheme of the Divine Redemption, according to St. Paul, seems to be\r\napplicable, not merely to the earth, but to all the celestial worlds.\r\nBut, unfortunately I am neither theologian, nor chemist, nor naturalist,\r\nnor philosopher; therefore, in my absolute ignorance of the great laws\r\nwhich govern the universe, I confine myself to saying in reply, 'I do not\r\nknow whether the worlds are inhabited or not; and since I do not know,\r\n_I am going to see!_\"\r\n\r\nWhether Michel Ardan's antagonist hazarded any further arguments or\r\nnot it is impossible to say, for the uproarious shouts of the crowd\r\nwould not allow any expression of opinion to gain a hearing. On silence\r\nbeing restored, the triumphant orator contented himself with adding the\r\nfollowing remarks:—\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, you will observe that I have but slightly touched upon\r\nthis great question. There is another altogether different line of\r\narguments in favour of the habitability of the stars, which I omit for\r\nthe present. I only desire to call attention to one point. To those who\r\nmaintain that the planets are _not_ inhabited one may reply:—You might\r\nbe perfectly in the right, if you could only show that the earth is the\r\n_best possible world,_ spite of what Voltaire has said. She has but _one_\r\nsatellite, while Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune have each several,\r\nan advantage by no means to be despised. But that which renders our own\r\nglobe so uncomfortable is the inclination of its axis to the plane of its\r\norbit. Hence the inequality of days and nights; hence the disagreeable\r\ndiversity of the seasons. On the surface of our unhappy spheroid we\r\nare always either too hot or too cold; we are frozen in winter, broiled\r\nin summer; it is the planet of rheumatism, coughs, bronchitis; while\r\non the surface of Jupiter, for example, where the axis is but slightly\r\ninclined, the inhabitants may enjoy uniform temperatures. It possesses\r\nzones of perpetual springs, summers, autumns, and winters; every Jovian\r\nmay choose for himself what climate he likes, and there spend the whole\r\nof his life in security from all variations of temperature. You will, I\r\nam sure, readily admit this superiority of Jupiter over our own planet,\r\nto say nothing of his years, which each equal twelve of ours! Under\r\nsuch auspices, and such marvellous conditions of existence, it appears\r\nto me that the inhabitants of so fortunate a world must be in every\r\nrespect superior to ourselves. All we require, in order to attain to\r\nsuch perfection, is the mere trifle of having an axis of rotation less\r\ninclined to the plane of its orbit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" roared an energetic voice, \"let us unite our efforts, invent\r\nthe necessary machines, and rectify the earth's axis!\"\r\n\r\nA thunder of applause followed this proposal, the author of which was, of\r\ncourse, no other than J. T. Maston. And, in all probability, if the truth\r\nmust be told, if the Yankees could only have found a point of application\r\nfor it, they would have constructed a lever capable of raising the earth\r\nand rectifying its axis. It was just this deficiency which baffled these\r\ndaring mechanicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n   ATTACK AND RIPOSTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the excitement had subsided, the following words were heard\r\nuttered in a strong and determined voice:—\r\n\r\n\"Now that the speaker has favoured us with so much imagination, would he\r\nbe so good as to return to his subject, and give us a little practical\r\nview of the question?\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed towards the person who spoke. He was a little\r\ndried-up man, of an active figure, with an American \"goatee\" beard.\r\nProfiting by the different movements in the crowd, he had managed by\r\ndegrees to gain the front row of spectators. There, with arms crossed\r\nand stern gaze, he watched the hero of the meeting. After having put\r\nhis question he remained silent, and appeared to take no notice of\r\nthe thousands of looks directed towards himself, nor of the murmur of\r\ndisapprobation excited by his words. Meeting at first with no reply, he\r\nrepeated his question with marked emphasis, adding, \"We are here to talk\r\nabout the _moon_ and not about the _earth_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, sir,\" replied Michel Ardan; \"the discussion has become\r\nirregular. We will return to the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the unknown, \"you pretend that our satellite is inhabited.\r\nVery good; but if Selenites do exist, that race of beings assuredly must\r\nlive without breathing, for—I warn you for your own sake—there is\r\nnot the smallest particle of air on the surface of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nAt this remark Ardan pushed up his shock of red hair; he saw that he was\r\non the point of being involved in a struggle with this person upon the\r\nvery gist of the whole question. He looked sternly at him in his turn\r\nand said,—\r\n\r\n\"Oh! so there is no air in the moon? And pray, if you are so good, who\r\nventures to affirm that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The men of science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied Michel, \"pleasantry apart, I have a profound respect for\r\nmen of science who do possess science, but a profound contempt for men\r\nof science who do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know any who belong to the latter category?\"\r\n\r\n\"Decidedly. In France there are some who maintain that, mathematically,\r\na bird cannot possibly fly; and others who demonstrate theoretically that\r\nfishes were never made to live in water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to do with persons of that description, and I can quote,\r\nin support of my statement, names which you cannot refuse deference to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir, you will sadly embarrass a poor ignorant, who, besides, asks\r\nnothing better than to learn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, do you introduce scientific questions if you have never\r\nstudied them?\" asked the unknown somewhat coarsely.\r\n\r\n\"For the reason that 'he is always brave who never suspects danger.' I\r\nknow nothing, it is true; but it is precisely my very weakness which\r\nconstitutes my strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your weakness amounts to folly,\" retorted the unknown in a passion.\r\n\r\n\"All the better,\" replied our Frenchman, \"if it carries me up to the\r\n_moon._\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his colleagues devoured with their eyes the intruder who had\r\nso boldly placed himself in antagonism to their enterprise. Nobody knew\r\nhim, and the president, uneasy as to the result of so free a discussion,\r\nwatched his new friend with some anxiety. The meeting began to be somewhat\r\nfidgety also, for the contest directed their attention to the dangers,\r\nif not the actual impossibilities, of the proposed expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: ATTACK AND RIPOSTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied Ardan's antagonist, \"there are many and incontrovertible\r\nreasons which prove the absence of an atmosphere in the moon. I might\r\nsay that, _à priori_, if one ever did exist, it must have been absorbed\r\nby the earth; but I prefer to bring forward indisputable facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring them forward then, sir, as many as you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" said the stranger, \"that when any luminous rays cross a\r\nmedium such as the air, they are deflected out of the straight line; in\r\nother words, they undergo _refraction._ Well! When stars are occulted by\r\nthe moon, their rays, on grazing the edge of her disc, exhibit not the\r\nleast deviation, nor offer the slightest indication of refraction. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that the moon cannot be surrounded by an atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"In point of fact,\" replied Ardan, \"this is your chief, if not your _only_\r\nargument; and a really scientific man might be puzzled to answer it. For\r\nmyself, I will simply say that it is defective, because it assumes that\r\nthe angular diameter of the moon has been completely determined, which\r\nis not the case. But let us proceed. Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit\r\nthe existence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Extinct_, yes! In activity, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?\"\r\n\r\n\"True! but, as they furnished themselves the oxygen necessary for\r\ncombustion, the mere fact of their eruption does not prove the presence\r\nof an atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed again, then; and let us set aside this class of arguments in\r\norder to come to direct observations. In 1715 the astronomers Louville\r\nand Halley, watching the eclipse of the 3rd May, remarked some very\r\nextraordinary scintillations. These jets of light, rapid in nature, and\r\nof frequent recurrence, they attributed to thunderstorms generated in\r\nthe lunar atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1715,\" replied the unknown, \"the astronomers Louville and Halley\r\nmistook for lunar phenomena some which were purely terrestrial, such as\r\nmeteoric or other bodies which are generated in our own atmosphere. This\r\nwas the scientific explanation at the time of the facts; and that is my\r\nanswer now.\"\r\n\r\n\"On again, then,\" replied Ardan; \"Herschel, in 1787, observed a great\r\nnumber of luminous points on the moon's surface, did he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! but without offering any solution of them. Herschel himself never\r\ninferred from them the necessity of a lunar atmosphere. And I may add\r\nthat Bœer and Moedler, the two great authorities upon the moon, are\r\nquite agreed as to the entire absence of air on its surface.\"\r\n\r\nA movement was here manifest among the assemblage, who appeared to be\r\ngrowing excited by the arguments of this singular personage.\r\n\r\n\"Let us proceed,\" replied Ardan, with perfect coolness, \"and come to one\r\nimportant fact. A skilful French astronomer, M. Laussedat, in watching\r\nthe eclipse of July 18, 1860, proved that the horns of the solar crescent\r\nwere _rounded and truncated._ Now, this appearance could only have been\r\nproduced by a deviation of the solar rays in traversing the atmosphere\r\nof the moon. There is no other possible explanation of the fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is this established as a fact?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely certain!\"\r\n\r\nA counter-movement here took place in favour of the hero of the meeting,\r\nwhose opponent was now reduced to silence. Ardan resumed the conversation;\r\nand without exhibiting any exultation at the advantage he had gained,\r\nsimply said,—\r\n\r\n\"You see, then, my dear sir, we must not pronounce with absolute\r\npositiveness against the existence of an atmosphere in the moon. That\r\natmosphere is, probably, of extreme rarity; nevertheless at the present\r\nday science generally admits that it exists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the mountains, at all events,\" returned the unknown, unwilling\r\nto give in.\r\n\r\n\"No! but at the bottom of the valleys, and not exceeding a few hundred\r\nfeet in height.\"\r\n\r\n\"In any case you will do well to take every precaution, for the air will\r\nbe terribly rarified.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good sir, there will always be enough for a solitary individual;\r\nbesides, once arrived up there, I shall do my best to economize, and not\r\nto breathe except on grand occasions!\"\r\n\r\nA tremendous roar of laughter rang in the ears of the mysterious\r\ninterlocutor, who glared fiercely round upon the assembly.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Ardan, with a careless air, \"since we are in accord\r\nregarding the presence of a certain atmosphere, we are forced to admit\r\nthe presence of a certain quantity of water. This is a happy consequence\r\nfor me. Moreover, my amiable contradictor, permit me to submit to you\r\none further observation. We only know one side of the moon's disc; and\r\nif there is but little air on the face presented to us, it is possible\r\nthat there is plenty on the one turned away from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for what reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the moon, under the action of the earth's attraction, has\r\nassumed the form of an egg, which we look at from the smaller end. Hence\r\nit follows, by Hausen's calculations, that its centre of gravity is\r\nsituated in the other hemisphere. Hence it results that the great mass\r\nof air and water must have been drawn away to the other face of our\r\nsatellite during the first days of its creation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pure fancies!\" cried the unknown.\r\n\r\n\"No! Pure theories! which are based upon the laws of mechanics, and it\r\nseems difficult to me to refute them. I appeal then to this meeting, and\r\nI put it to them whether life, such as exists upon the earth, is possible\r\non the surface of the moon?\"\r\n\r\nThree hundred thousand auditors at once applauded the proposition.\r\nArdan's opponent tried to get in another word, but he could not obtain\r\na hearing. Cries and menaces fell upon him like hail.\r\n\r\n\"Enough! enough!\" cried some.\r\n\r\n\"Drive the intruder off!\" shouted others.\r\n\r\n\"Turn him out!\" roared the exasperated crowd.\r\n\r\nBut he, holding firmly on to the platform, did not budge an inch, and let\r\nthe storm pass on, which would soon have assumed formidable proportions,\r\nif Michel Ardan had not quieted it by a gesture. He was too chivalrous\r\nto abandon his opponent in an apparent extremity.\r\n\r\n\"You wished to say a few more words?\" he asked, in a pleasant voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a thousand; or rather, no, only one! If you persevere in your\r\nenterprise, you must be a—\"\r\n\r\n\"Very rash person! How can you treat me as such? me, who have demanded a\r\ncylindro-conical projectile, in order to prevent turning round and round\r\non my way like a squirrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, unhappy man, the dreadful recoil will smash you to pieces at your\r\nstarting.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear contradictor, you have just put your finger upon the true and\r\nthe only difficulty; nevertheless, I have too good an opinion of the\r\nindustrial genius of the Americans not to believe that they will succeed\r\nin overcoming it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing\r\nthe strata of air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the walls are thick, and I shall soon have crossed the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"But victuals and water?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have calculated for a twelvemonth's supply, and I shall be only four\r\ndays on the journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"But for air to breathe on the road?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall make it by chemical process.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your fall on the moon, supposing you ever reach it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be six times less dangerous than a sudden fall upon the earth,\r\nbecause the weight will be only one-sixth as great on the surface of the\r\nmoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still it will be enough to smash you like glass!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to prevent my retarding the shock by means of rockets conveniently\r\nplaced, and lighted at the right moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"But after all, supposing all difficulties surmounted, all obstacles\r\nremoved, supposing everything combined to favour you, and granting that\r\nyou may arrive safe and sound in the moon, how will you come back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not coming back!\"\r\n\r\nAt this reply, almost sublime in its very simplicity, the assembly became\r\nsilent. But its silence was more eloquent than could have been its cries\r\nof enthusiasm. The unknown profited by the opportunity and once more\r\nprotested,—\r\n\r\n\"You will inevitably kill yourself!\" he cried; \"and your death will be\r\nthat of a madman, useless even to science!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, my dear unknown, for truly your prophecies are most agreeable!\"\r\n\r\n\"It really is too much!\" cried Michel Ardan's adversary. \"I do not know\r\nwhy I should continue so frivolous a discussion! Please yourself about\r\nthis insane expedition! We need not trouble ourselves about you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray don't stand upon ceremony!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! another person is responsible for your act.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, may I ask?\" demanded Michel Ardan in an imperious tone.\r\n\r\n\"The ignoramus who organized this equally absurd and impossible\r\nexperiment!\"\r\n\r\nThe attack was direct. Barbicane, ever since the interference of the\r\nunknown, had been making fearful efforts of self-control; now, however,\r\nseeing himself directly attacked, he could restrain himself no longer.\r\nHe rose suddenly, and was rushing upon the enemy who thus braved him to\r\nthe face, when all at once he found himself separated from him.\r\n\r\nThe platform was lifted by a hundred strong arms, and the President of\r\nthe Gun Club shared with Michel Ardan triumphal honours. The shield was\r\nheavy, but the bearers came in continuous relays, disputing, struggling,\r\neven fighting among themselves in their eagerness to lend their shoulders\r\nto this demonstration.\r\n\r\nHowever, the unknown had not profited by the tumult to quit his post.\r\nBesides he could not have done it in the midst of that compact crowd.\r\nThere he held on in the front row with crossed arms, glaring at President\r\nBarbicane.\r\n\r\nThe shouts of the immense crowd continued at their highest pitch throughout\r\nthis triumphant march. Michel Ardan took it all with evident pleasure.\r\nHis face gleamed with delight. Several times the platform seemed seized\r\nwith pitching and rolling like a weather-beaten ship. But the two heroes\r\nof the meeting had good sea-legs. They never stumbled; and their vessel\r\narrived without dues at the port of Tampa Town.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan managed fortunately to escape from the last embraces of\r\nhis vigorous admirers. He made for the Hotel Franklin, quickly gained\r\nhis chamber, and slid under the bedclothes, while an army of a hundred\r\nthousand men kept watch under his windows.\r\n\r\nDuring this time a scene, short, grave, and decisive, took place between\r\nthe mysterious personage and the President of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, free at last, had gone straight at his adversary.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" he said shortly.\r\n\r\nThe other followed him on to the quay; and the two presently found\r\nthemselves alone at the entrance of an open wharf on Jones' Fall.\r\n\r\nThe two enemies, still mutually unknown, gazed at each other.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE PLATFORM WAS SUDDENLY CARRIED AWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Captain Nicholl!\"\r\n\r\n\"So I suspected. Hitherto chance has never thrown you in my way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am come for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have insulted me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Publicly!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will answer to me for this insult?\"\r\n\r\n\"At this very moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! I desire that all that passes between us shall be secret. There is\r\na wood situated three miles from Tampa, the wood of Skersnaw. Do you know\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be so good as to enter it to-morrow morning at five o'clock,\r\non one side?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! if you will enter at the other side at the same hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will not forget your rifle?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"No more than you will forget yours,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\nThese words having been coldly spoken, the President of the Gun Club and\r\nthe captain parted. Barbicane returned to his lodging; but instead of\r\nsnatching a few hours of repose, he passed the night in endeavouring to\r\ndiscover a means of evading the recoil of the projectile, and resolving\r\nthe difficult problem proposed by Michel Ardan during the discussion at\r\nthe meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n   HOW A FRENCHMAN MANAGES AN AFFAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the contract of this duel was being discussed by the president and\r\nthe captain—this dreadful, savage duel, in which each adversary became\r\na man-hunter—Michel Ardan was resting from the fatigues of his triumph.\r\n_Resting_ is hardly an appropriate expression, for American beds rival\r\nmarble or granite tables for hardness.\r\n\r\nArdan was sleeping, then, badly enough, tossing about between the cloths\r\nwhich served him for sheets, and he was dreaming of making a more\r\ncomfortable couch in his projectile when a frightful noise disturbed his\r\ndreams. Thundering blows shook his door. They seemed to be caused by some\r\niron instrument. A great deal of loud talking was distinguishable in this\r\nracket, which was rather too early in the morning. \"Open the door,\" some\r\none shrieked, \"for Heaven's sake!\" Ardan saw no reason for complying with\r\na demand so roughly expressed. However, he got up and opened the door\r\njust as it was giving way before the blows of this determined visitor.\r\nThe secretary of the Gun Club burst into the room. A bomb could not have\r\nmade more noise or have entered the room with less ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"Last night,\" cried J. T. Maston, _ex abrupto_, \"our president was\r\npublicly insulted during the meeting. He provoked his adversary, who is\r\nnone other than Captain Nicholl! They are fighting this morning in the\r\nwood of Skersnaw. I heard all particulars from the mouth of Barbicane\r\nhimself. If he is killed, then our scheme is at end. We must prevent this\r\nduel; and one man alone has enough influence over Barbicane to stop him,\r\nand that man is Michel Ardan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: MASTON BURST INTO THE ROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile J. T. Maston was speaking, Michel Ardan, without interrupting him,\r\nhad hastily put on his clothes; and, in less than two minutes, the two\r\nfriends were making for the suburbs of Tampa Town with rapid strides.\r\n\r\nIt was during this walk that Maston told Ardan the state of the case. He\r\ntold him the real causes of the hostility between Barbicane and Nicholl;\r\nhow it was of old date, and why, thanks to unknown friends, the president\r\nand the captain had, as yet, never met face to face. He added that it\r\narose simply from a rivalry between iron plates and shot, and, finally,\r\nthat the scene at the meeting was only the long-wished-for opportunity\r\nfor Nicholl to pay off an old grudge.\r\n\r\nNothing is more dreadful than private duels in America. The two adversaries\r\nattack each other like wild beasts. Then it is that they might well covet\r\nthose wonderful properties of the Indians of the prairies—their quick\r\nintelligence, their ingenious cunning, their scent of the enemy. A single\r\nmistake, a moment's hesitation, a single false step may cause death. On\r\nthese occasions Yankees are often accompanied by their dogs, and keep up\r\nthe struggle for hours.\r\n\r\n\"What demons you are!\" cried Michel Ardan, when his companion had depicted\r\nthis scene to him with much energy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes we are,\" replied J. T. modestly; \"but we had better make haste.\"\r\n\r\nThough Michel Ardan and he had crossed the plain still wet with dew, and\r\nhad taken the shortest route over creeks and ricefields, they could not\r\nreach Skersnaw under five hours and a half.\r\n\r\nBarbicane must have passed the border half an hour ago.\r\n\r\nThere was an old bushman working there, occupied in selling faggots from\r\ntrees that had been levelled by his axe.\r\n\r\nMaston ran towards him, saying, \"Have you seen a man go into the wood,\r\narmed with a rifle? Barbicane, the president, my best friend?\"\r\n\r\nThe worthy secretary of the Gun Club thought that his president must be\r\nknown by all the world. But the bushman did not seem to understand him.\r\n\r\n\"A hunter?\" said Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"A hunter? Yes,\" replied the bushman.\r\n\r\n\"Long ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"About an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late!\" cried Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard any gun-shots?\" asked Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one! that hunter did not look as if he knew how to hunt!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" said Maston.\r\n\r\n\"We must go into the wood, at the risk of getting a ball which is not\r\nintended for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Maston, in a tone which could not be mistaken, \"I would\r\nrather have twenty balls in my own head than one in Barbicane's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forward, then,\" said Ardan, pressing his companion's hand.\r\n\r\nA few moments later the two friends had disappeared in the copse. It was\r\na dense thicket, in which rose huge cypresses, sycamores, tulip-trees,\r\nolives, tamarinds, oaks, and magnolias. These different trees had\r\ninterwoven their branches into an inextricable maze, through which the\r\neye could not penetrate. Michel Ardan and Maston walked side by side in\r\nsilence through the tall grass, cutting themselves a path through the\r\nstrong creepers, casting curious glances on the bushes, and momentarily\r\nexpecting to hear the sound of rifles. As for the traces which Barbicane\r\nought to have left of his passage through the wood, there was not a\r\nvestige of them visible: so they followed the barely perceptible paths\r\nalong which Indians had tracked some enemy, and which the dense foliage\r\ndarkly overshadowed.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour spent in vain pursuit the two stopped in intensified\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\"It must be all over,\" said Maston, discouraged. \"A man like Barbicane\r\nwould not dodge with his enemy, or ensnare him, would not even manœuvre!\r\nHe is too open, too brave. He has gone straight ahead, right into the\r\ndanger, and doubtless far enough from the bushman for the wind to prevent\r\nhis hearing the report of the rifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"since we entered the wood we should\r\nhave heard!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if we came too late?\" cried Maston in tones of despair.\r\n\r\nFor once Ardan had no reply to make, he and Maston resuming their walk\r\nin silence. From time to time, indeed, they raised great shouts, calling\r\nalternately Barbicane and Nicholl, neither of whom, however, answered\r\ntheir cries. Only the birds, awakened by the sound, flew past them\r\nand disappeared among the branches, while some frightened deer fled\r\nprecipitately before them.\r\n\r\nFor another hour their search was continued. The greater part of the\r\nwood had been explored. There was nothing to reveal the presence of the\r\ncombatants. The information of the bushman was after all doubtful, and\r\nArdan was about to propose their abandoning this useless pursuit, when\r\nall at once Maston stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said he, \"there is some one down there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one?\" repeated Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; a man! He seems motionless. His rifle is not in his hands. What\r\ncan he be doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"But can you recognize him?\" asked Ardan, whose short sight was of little\r\nuse to him in such circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes! He is turning towards us,\" answered Maston.\r\n\r\n\"And it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Nicholl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl?\" cried Michel Ardan, feeling a terrible pang of grief.\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl unarmed! He has, then, no longer any fear of his adversary!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go to him,\" said Michel Ardan, \"and find out the truth.\"\r\n\r\nBut he and his companion had barely taken fifty steps when they paused to\r\nexamine the captain more attentively. They expected to find a bloodthirsty\r\nman, happy in his revenge!\r\n\r\nOn seeing him, they remained stupefied.\r\n\r\nA net, composed of very fine meshes, hung between two enormous\r\ntulip-trees, and in the midst of this snare, with its wings entangled,\r\nwas a poor little bird, uttering pitiful cries, while it vainly struggled\r\nto escape. The bird-catcher who had laid this snare was no human being,\r\nbut a venomous spider, peculiar to that country, as large as a pigeon's\r\negg, and armed with enormous claws. The hideous creature, instead of\r\nrushing on its prey, had beaten a sudden retreat and taken refuge in\r\nthe upper branches of the tulip-tree, for a formidable enemy menaced its\r\nstronghold.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was Nicholl, his gun on the ground, forgetful of danger,\r\ntrying if possible to save the victim from its cobweb prison. At last it\r\nwas accomplished, and the little bird flew joyfully away and disappeared.\r\n\r\nNicholl lovingly watched its flight, when he heard these words pronounced\r\nby a voice full of emotion,—\r\n\r\n\"You are indeed a brave man!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned. Michel Ardan was before him, repeating in a different tone,—\r\n\r\n\"And a kindhearted one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Michel Ardan!\" cried the captain. \"Why are you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"To press your hand, Nicholl, and to prevent you from either killing\r\nBarbicane or being killed by him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barbicane!\" returned the captain. \"I have been looking for him for the\r\nlast two hours in vain. Where is he hiding?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: IN THE MIDST OF THIS SNARE WAS A POOR LITTLE BIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl!\" said Michel Ardan, \"this is not courteous! we ought always to\r\ntreat an adversary with respect; rest assured if Barbicane is still alive\r\nwe shall find him all the more easily; because if he has not, like you,\r\nbeen amusing himself with freeing oppressed birds, he must be looking\r\nfor _you_. When we have found him, Michel Ardan tells you this, there\r\nwill be no duel between you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Between President Barbicane and myself,\" gravely replied Nicholl, \"there\r\nis a rivalry which the death of one of us—\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh, pooh!\" said Ardan. \"Brave fellows like you indeed! you shall not\r\nfight!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will fight, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" said J. T. Maston, with much feeling, \"I am a friend of the\r\npresident's, his _alter ego_, his second self; if you really must kill\r\nsome one, _shoot me!_ it will do just as well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" Nicholl replied, seizing his rifle convulsively, \"these jokes—\"\r\n\r\n\"Our friend Maston is not joking,\" replied Ardan. \"I fully understand\r\nhis idea of being killed himself in order to save his friend. But neither\r\nhe nor Barbicane will fall before the balls of Captain Nicholl. Indeed I\r\nhave so attractive a proposal to make to the two rivals, that both will\r\nbe eager to accept it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Nicholl with manifest incredulity.\r\n\r\n\"Patience!\" exclaimed Ardan. \"I can only reveal it in the presence of\r\nBarbicane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go in search of him then!\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\nThe three men started off at once; the captain having discharged his\r\nrifle threw it over his shoulder, and advanced in silence.\r\n\r\nAnother half-hour passed, and the pursuit was still fruitless. Maston was\r\noppressed by sinister forebodings. He looked fiercely at Nicholl, asking\r\nhimself whether the captain's vengeance had been already satisfied, and\r\nthe unfortunate Barbicane, shot, was perhaps lying dead on some bloody\r\ntrack. The same thought seemed to occur to Ardan; and both were casting\r\ninquiring glances on Nicholl, when suddenly Maston paused.\r\n\r\nThe motionless figure of a man leaning against a gigantic catalpa twenty\r\nfeet off appeared, half-veiled by the foliage. \"It is he!\" said Maston.\r\n\r\nBarbicane never moved. Ardan looked at the captain, but he did not wince.\r\nArdan went forward crying,—\r\n\r\n\"Barbicane, Barbicane!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer! Ardan rushed towards his friend; but in the act of seizing\r\nhis arms, he stopped short and uttered a cry of surprise.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, pencil in hand, was tracing geometrical figures in a memorandum\r\nbook, whilst his unloaded rifle lay beside him on the ground.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in his studies, Barbicane, in his turn forgetful of the duel,\r\nhad seen and heard nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen Ardan took his hand, he looked up and stared at his visitor in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it is you!\" he cried at last. \"I have found it, my friend, I have\r\nfound it!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"My plan!\"\r\n\r\n\"What plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"The plan for counteracting the effect of the shock at the departure of\r\nthe projectile!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said Michel Ardan, looking at the captain out of the corner of\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! water! simply water, which will act as a spring—ah! Maston,\"\r\ncried Barbicane, \"you here also?\"\r\n\r\n\"Himself,\" replied Ardan; \"and permit me to introduce to you at the same\r\ntime the worthy Captain Nicholl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl!\" cried Barbicane, who jumped up at once. \"Pardon me, captain,\r\nI had quite forgotten—I am ready!\"\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan interfered, without giving the two enemies time to say\r\nanything more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"GO WITH ME, AND SEE WHETHER WE ARE STOPPED\r\n   ON OUR JOURNEY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven!\" said he. \"It is a happy thing that brave men like you two\r\ndid not meet sooner! we should now have been mourning for one or other\r\nof you. But, thanks to Providence, which has interfered, there is now no\r\nfurther cause for alarm. When one forgets one's anger in mechanics or in\r\ncobwebs, it is a sign that the anger is not dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan then told the president how the captain had been found\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n\"I put it to you now,\" said he in conclusion, \"are two such good fellows\r\nas you are made on purpose to smash each other's skulls with shot?\"\r\n\r\nThere was in \"the situation\" somewhat of the ridiculous, something\r\nquite unexpected; Michel Ardan saw this, and determined to effect a\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\n\"My good friends,\" said he, with his most bewitching smile, \"this is\r\nnothing but a misunderstanding. Nothing more! well! to prove that it is\r\nall over between you, accept frankly the proposal I am going to make to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make it,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Our friend Barbicane believes that his projectile will go straight to\r\nthe moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly,\" replied the president.\r\n\r\n\"And our friend Nicholl is persuaded it will fall back upon the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am certain of it,\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Ardan. \"I cannot pretend to make you agree; but I suggest\r\nthis:—Go with me, and so see whether we are stopped on our journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" exclaimed J. T. Maston, stupefied.\r\n\r\nThe two rivals, on this sudden proposal, looked steadily at each other.\r\nBarbicane waited for the captain's answer. Nicholl watched for the\r\ndecision of the president.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Michel. \"There is now no fear of the shock!\"\r\n\r\n\"Done!\" cried Barbicane.\r\n\r\nBut quickly as he pronounced the word, he was not before Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! bravo! hip! hip! hurrah!\" cried Michel, giving a hand to each\r\nof the late adversaries. \"Now that it is all settled, my friends, allow\r\nme to treat you after French fashion. Let us be off to breakfast!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n   THE NEW CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same day all America heard of the affair of Captain Nicholl and\r\nPresident Barbicane, as well as its singular _denouement_. From that\r\nday forth, Michel Ardan had not one moment's rest. Deputations from all\r\ncorners of the Union harassed him without cessation or intermission.\r\nHe was compelled to receive them all, whether he would or no. How many\r\nhands he shook, how many people he was \"hail-fellow-well-met\" with, it\r\nis impossible to guess! Such a triumphal result would have intoxicated\r\nany other man; but he managed to keep himself in a state of delightful\r\n_semi_-tipsiness.\r\n\r\nAmong the deputations of all kinds which assailed him, that of \"The\r\nLunatics\" were careful not to forget what they owed to the future\r\nconqueror of the moon. One day, certain of these poor people, so numerous\r\nin America, came to call upon him, and requested permission to return\r\nwith him to their native country.\r\n\r\n\"Singular hallucination!\" said he to Barbicane, after having dismissed\r\nthe deputation with promises to convey numbers of messages to friends in\r\nthe moon. \"Do you believe in the influence of the moon upon distempers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely!\"\r\n\r\n\"No more do I, despite some remarkable recorded facts of history. For\r\ninstance, during an epidemic in 1693, a large number of persons died\r\nat the very moment of an eclipse. The celebrated Bacon always fainted\r\nduring an eclipse. Charles VI. relapsed six times into madness during\r\nthe year 1399, sometimes during the new, sometimes during the full\r\nmoon. Gall observed that insane persons underwent an accession of their\r\ndisorder twice in every month, at the epochs of new and full moon. In\r\nfact, numerous observations made upon fevers, somnambulisms, and other\r\nhuman maladies, seem to prove that the moon does exercise some mysterious\r\ninfluence upon man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the how and the wherefore?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can only give you the answer which Arago borrowed from Plutarch,\r\nwhich is nineteen centuries old. 'Perhaps the stories are not true!'\"\r\n\r\nIn the height of his triumph, Michel Ardan had to encounter all the\r\nannoyances incidental to a man of celebrity. Managers of entertainments\r\nwanted to exhibit him. Barnum offered him a million dollars to make the\r\ntour of the United States in his show. As for his photographs, they were\r\nsold of all sizes, and his portrait taken in every imaginable posture.\r\nMore than half a million copies were disposed of in an incredibly short\r\nspace of time.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only the men who paid him homage, but the women also. He\r\nmight have married well a hundred times over, if he had been willing to\r\nsettle in life. The old maids, in particular, of forty years and upwards,\r\nand dry in proportion, devoured his photographs day and night. They\r\nwould have married him by hundreds, even if he had imposed upon them the\r\ncondition of accompanying him into space. He had, however, no intention\r\nof transplanting a race of Franco-Americans upon the surface of the moon.\r\n\r\nHe therefore declined all offers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could withdraw from these somewhat embarrassing\r\ndemonstrations, he went, accompanied by his friends, to pay a visit to\r\nthe Columbiad. He was highly gratified by his inspection, and made the\r\ndescent to the bottom of the tube of this gigantic machine which was\r\npresently to launch him to the regions of the moon.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to mention a proposal of J. T. Maston's. When the\r\nsecretary of the Gun Club found that Barbicane and Nicholl accepted the\r\nproposal of Michel Ardan, he determined to join them, and make one of\r\na snug party of four. So one day he determined to be admitted as one\r\nof the travellers. Barbicane, pained at having to refuse him, gave him\r\nclearly to understand that the projectile could not possibly contain\r\nso many passengers. Maston, in despair, went in search of Michel Ardan,\r\nwho counselled him to resign himself to the situation, adding one or two\r\narguments _ad hominem_.\r\n\r\n\"You see, old fellow,\" he said, \"you must not take what I say in bad part;\r\nbut really, between ourselves, you are in too incomplete a condition to\r\nappear in the moon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Incomplete?\" shrieked the valiant invalid.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear fellow! imagine our meeting some of the inhabitants up\r\nthere! Would you like to give them such a melancholy notion of what goes\r\non down here? to teach them what war is, to inform them that we employ\r\nour time chiefly in devouring each other, in smashing arms and legs, and\r\nthat too on a globe which is capable of supporting a hundred billions of\r\ninhabitants, and which actually does contain nearly two hundred millions?\r\nWhy, my worthy friend, we should have to turn you out of doors!\"\r\n\r\n\"But still, if you arrive there in pieces, you will be as _incomplete_\r\nas I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably,\" replied Michel Ardan; \"but we shall not.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, a preparatory experiment, tried on the 18th October, had yielded\r\nthe best results and caused the most well-grounded hopes of success.\r\nBarbicane, desirous of obtaining some notion of the effect of the shock\r\nat the moment of the projectile's departure, had procured a 38-inch\r\nmortar from the arsenal of Pensacola. He had this placed on the bank of\r\nHillisborough Roads, in order that the shell might fall back into the\r\nsea, and the shock be thereby destroyed. His object was to ascertain the\r\nextent of the shock of departure, and not that of the return.\r\n\r\nA hollow projectile had been prepared for this curious experiment. A thick\r\npadding fastened upon a kind of elastic network, made of the best steel,\r\nlined the inside of the walls. It was a veritable _nest_ most carefully\r\nwadded.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity I can't find room in there,\" said J. T. Maston, regretting\r\nthat his height did not allow of his trying the adventure.\r\n\r\nWithin this shell were shut up a large cat, and a squirrel belonging to\r\nJ. T. Maston, and of which he was particularly fond. They were desirous,\r\nhowever, of ascertaining how this little animal, least of all others\r\nsubject to giddiness, would endure this experimental voyage.\r\n\r\nThe mortar was charged with 160 lbs. of powder, and the shell placed in\r\nthe chamber. On being fired, the projectile rose with great velocity,\r\ndescribed a majestic parabola, attained a height of about a thousand\r\nfeet, and with a graceful curve descended in the midst of the vessels\r\nthat lay there at anchor.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's loss of time a small boat put off in the direction of\r\nits fall; some active divers plunged into the water and attached ropes\r\nto the handles of the shell, which was quickly dragged on board. Five\r\nminutes did not elapse between the moment of enclosing the animals and\r\nthat of unscrewing the coverlid of their prison.\r\n\r\nArdan, Barbicane, Maston, and Nicholl were present on board the boat,\r\nand assisted at the operation with an interest which may readily be\r\ncomprehended. Hardly had the shell been opened when the cat leaped out,\r\nslightly bruised, but full of life, and exhibiting no signs whatever of\r\nhaving made an aerial expedition. No trace, however, of the squirrel\r\ncould be discovered. The truth at last became apparent;—the cat had\r\neaten its fellow-traveller!\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston grieved much for the loss of his poor squirrel, and proposed\r\nto add its case to that of other martyrs to science.\r\n\r\nAfter this experiment all hesitation, all fear disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE CAT TAKEN OUT OF THE SHELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides, Barbicane's plans would ensure greater perfection for his\r\nprojectile, and go far to annihilate altogether the effects of the shock.\r\nNothing now remained but to go!\r\n\r\nTwo days later Michel Ardan received a message from the President of the\r\nUnited States, an honour of which he showed himself especially sensible.\r\n\r\nAfter the example of his illustrious fellow-countryman, the Marquis de\r\nla Fayette, the government had decreed to him the title of \"Citizen of\r\nthe United States of America.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n   THE PROJECTILE-VEHICLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the Columbiad the public interest centred in the\r\nprojectile itself, the vehicle which was destined to carry the three\r\nhardy adventurers into space.\r\n\r\nThe new plans had been sent to Breadwill and Co., of Albany, with the\r\nrequest for their speedy execution. The projectile was consequently cast\r\non the 2d November, and immediately forwarded by the Eastern Railway to\r\nStones Hill, which it reached without accident on the 10th of that month,\r\nwhere Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl were waiting impatiently for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe projectile had now to be filled to the depth of three feet with a\r\nbed of water, intended to support a watertight wooden disc, which worked\r\neasily within the walls of the projectile. It was upon this kind of\r\nraft that the travellers were to take their place. This body of water\r\nwas divided by horizontal partitions, which the shock of the departure\r\nwould have to break in succession. Then each sheet of the water, from\r\nthe lowest to the highest, running off into escape tubes toward the top\r\nof the projectile, constituted a kind of spring; and the wooden disc,\r\nsupplied with extremely powerful plugs, could not strike the lowest plate\r\nexcept after breaking successively the different partitions. Undoubtedly\r\nthe travellers would still have to encounter a violent _recoil_ after\r\nthe complete escapement of the water; but the first shock would be almost\r\nentirely destroyed by this powerful spring. The upper part of the walls\r\nwere lined with a thick padding of leather, fastened upon springs of the\r\nbest steel, behind which the escape tubes were completely concealed; thus\r\nall imaginable precautions had been taken for averting the first shock;\r\nand if they _did_ get crushed, they must, as Michel Ardan said, be made\r\nof very bad materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE ARRIVAL OF THE PROJECTILE AT STONE'S HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entrance into this metallic tower was by a narrow aperture contrived\r\nin the wall of the cone. This was hermetically closed by a plate of\r\naluminium, fastened internally by powerful screw-pressure. The travellers\r\ncould therefore quit their prison at pleasure, as soon as they should\r\nreach the moon.\r\n\r\nLight and view were given by means of four thick lenticular glass\r\nscuttles, two pierced in the circular wall itself, the third in the\r\nbottom, the fourth in the top. These scuttles then were protected against\r\nthe shock of departure by plates let into solid grooves, which could\r\neasily be opened outwards by unscrewing them from the inside. Reservoirs\r\nfirmly fixed contained water and the necessary provisions; and fire and\r\nlight were procurable by means of gas, contained in a special reservoir\r\nunder a pressure of several atmospheres. They had only to turn a tap,\r\nand for six hours the gas would light and warm this comfortable vehicle.\r\n\r\nThere now remained only the question of air; for allowing for the\r\nconsumption of air by Barbicane, his two companions, and two dogs which\r\nhe proposed taking with him, it was necessary to renew the air of the\r\nprojectile. Now air consists principally of twenty-one parts of oxygen\r\nand seventy-nine of nitrogen. The lungs absorb the oxygen, which is\r\nindispensable for the support of life, and reject the nitrogen. The air\r\nexpired loses nearly five per cent. of the former and contains nearly an\r\nequal volume of carbonic acid, produced by the combustion of the elements\r\nof the blood. In an air-tight enclosure, then, after a certain time, all\r\nthe oxygen of the air will be replaced by the carbonic acid—a gas fatal\r\nto life. There were two things to be done then—first, to replace the\r\nabsorbed oxygen; secondly, to destroy the expired carbonic acid; both\r\neasy enough to do, by means of chlorate of potassium and caustic potash.\r\nThe former is a salt which appears under the form of white crystals;\r\nwhen raised to a temperature of 400° it is transformed into chlorate\r\nof potass, and the oxygen which it contains is entirely liberated. Now\r\ntwenty-eight pounds of chlorate of potassium produce seven pounds of\r\noxygen, or 2400 _litres_—the quantity necessary for the travellers\r\nduring twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nCaustic potash has a great affinity for carbonic acid; and it is\r\nsufficient to shake it in order for it to seize upon the acid and form\r\nbi-carbonate of potass. By these two means they would be enabled to\r\nrestore to the vitiated air its life-supporting properties.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, to add that the experiments had hitherto been\r\nmade _in anima vili_. Whatever its scientific accuracy was, they were at\r\npresent ignorant how it would answer with human beings. The honour of\r\nputting it to the proof was energetically claimed by J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Since I am not to go,\" said the brave artillerist, \"I may at least live\r\nfor a week in the projectile.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been hard to refuse him; so they consented to his wish.\r\nA sufficient quantity of chlorate of potassium and of caustic potash\r\nwas placed at his disposal, together with provisions for eight days.\r\nAnd having shaken hands with his friends, on the 12th November, at six\r\no'clock a.m., after strictly informing them not to open his prison before\r\nthe 20th, at six o'clock p.m., he slid down the projectile, the plate\r\nof which was at once hermetically sealed. What did he do with himself\r\nduring that week? They could get no information. The thickness of the\r\nwalls of the projectile prevented any sound reaching from the inside\r\nto the outside. On the 20th of November, at six p.m. exactly, the plate\r\nwas opened. The friends of J. T. Maston had been all along in a state of\r\nmuch anxiety; but they were promptly reassured on hearing a jolly voice\r\nshouting a boisterous hurrah.\r\n\r\nPresently afterwards the secretary of the Gun Club appeared at the top\r\nof the cone in a triumphant attitude. He had grown fat!\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: J. T. MASTON HAD GROWN FAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n   THE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 20th October in the preceding year, after the close of the\r\nsubscription, the president of the Gun Club had credited the Observatory\r\nof Cambridge with the necessary sums for the construction of a gigantic\r\noptical instrument. This instrument was designed for the purpose of\r\nrendering visible on the surface of the moon any object exceeding nine\r\nfeet in diameter.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the Gun Club essayed their great experiment, such\r\ninstruments had reached a high degree of perfection, and produced some\r\nmagnificent results. Two telescopes in particular, at this time, were\r\npossessed of remarkable power and of gigantic dimensions. The first,\r\nconstructed by Herschel, was thirty-six feet in length, and had an\r\nobject-glass of four feet six inches; it possessed a magnifying power\r\nof 6000. The second was raised in Ireland, in Parsonstown Park, and\r\nbelongs to Lord Rosse. The length of this tube is forty-eight feet, and\r\nthe diameter of its object-glass six feet; it magnifies 6400 times, and\r\nrequired an immense erection of brickwork and masonry for the purpose of\r\nworking it, its weight being twelve tons and a half.\r\n\r\nStill, despite these colossal dimensions, the actual enlargements\r\nscarcely exceeded 6000 times in round numbers; consequently, the moon\r\nwas brought within no nearer an apparent distance than thirty-nine miles;\r\nand objects of less than sixty feet in diameter, unless they were of very\r\nconsiderable length, were still imperceptible.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, dealing with a projectile nine feet in diameter\r\nand fifteen feet long, it became necessary to bring the moon within an\r\napparent distance of five miles at most; and for that purpose to establish\r\na magnifying power of 48,000 times.\r\n\r\nSuch was the question proposed to the Observatory of Cambridge. There\r\nwas no lack of funds; the difficulty was purely one of construction.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable discussion as to the best form and principle of\r\nthe proposed instrument the work was finally commenced. According to\r\nthe calculations of the Observatory of Cambridge, the tube of the new\r\nreflector would require to be 280 feet in length, and the object-glass\r\nsixteen feet in diameter. Colossal as these dimensions may appear, they\r\nwere diminutive in comparison with the 10,000 foot telescope proposed by\r\nthe astronomer Hooke only a few years ago!\r\n\r\nRegarding the choice of locality, that matter was promptly determined.\r\nThe object was to select some lofty mountain, and there are not many of\r\nthese in the United States. In fact there are but two chains of moderate\r\nelevation, between which runs the magnificent Mississippi, the \"king of\r\nrivers,\" as these Republican Yankees delight to call it.\r\n\r\nEastwards rise the Apalachians, the very highest point of which, in New\r\nHampshire, does not exceed the very moderate altitude of 5600 feet.\r\n\r\nOn the west, however, rise the Rocky Mountains, that immense range which,\r\ncommencing at the Straits of Magellan, follows the western coast of\r\nSouthern America under the name of the Andes or the Cordilleras, until\r\nit crosses the Isthmus of Panama, and runs up the whole of North America\r\nto the very borders of the Polar Sea. The highest elevation of this range\r\nstill does not exceed 10,700 feet. With this elevation, nevertheless, the\r\nGun Club were compelled to be content, inasmuch as they had determined\r\nthat both telescope and Columbiad should be erected within the limits of\r\nthe Union. All the necessary apparatus was consequently sent on to the\r\nsummit of Long's Peak, in the territory of Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither pen nor language can describe the difficulties of all kinds\r\nwhich the American engineers had to surmount, or the prodigies of daring\r\nand skill which they accomplished. They had to raise enormous stones,\r\nmassive pieces of wrought iron, heavy corner-clamps and huge portions\r\nof cylinder, with an object-glass weighing nearly 30,000 lbs., above\r\nthe line of perpetual snow for more than 10,000 feet in height, after\r\ncrossing desert prairies, impenetrable forests, fearful rapids, far\r\nfrom all centres of population, and in the midst of savage regions, in\r\nwhich every detail of life becomes an almost insoluble problem. And yet,\r\nnotwithstanding these innumerable obstacles, American genius triumphed.\r\nIn less than a year after the commencement of the works, towards the close\r\nof September, the gigantic reflector rose into the air to a height of\r\n280 feet. It was raised by means of an enormous iron crane; an ingenious\r\nmechanism allowed it to be easily worked towards all the points of the\r\nheavens, and to follow the stars from the one horizon to the other during\r\ntheir journey through the heavens.\r\n\r\nIt had cost 400,000 dollars. The first time it was directed towards the\r\nmoon the observers evinced both curiosity and anxiety. What were they\r\nabout to discover in the field of this telescope which magnified objects\r\n48,000 times? Would they perceive peoples, herds of lunar animals,\r\ntowns, lakes, seas? No! there was nothing which science had not already\r\ndiscovered! and on all the points of its disc the volcanic nature of the\r\nmoon became determinable with the utmost precision.\r\n\r\nBut the telescope of the Rocky Mountains, before doing its duty to the Gun\r\nClub, rendered immense services to astronomy. Thanks to its penetrative\r\npower, the depths of the heavens were sounded to the utmost extent; the\r\napparent diameter of a great number of stars was accurately measured; and\r\nMr. Clark, of the Cambridge staff, resolved the Crab nebula in Taurus,\r\nwhich the reflector of Lord Rosse had never been able to decompose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n   FINAL DETAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the 22nd of November; the departure was to take place in ten days.\r\nOne operation alone remained to be accomplished to bring all to a happy\r\ntermination; an operation delicate and perilous, requiring infinite\r\nprecautions, and against the success of which Captain Nicholl had laid\r\nhis third bet. It was, in fact, nothing less than the loading of the\r\nColumbiad, and the introduction into it of 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton.\r\nNicholl had thought, not perhaps without reason, that the handling of\r\nsuch formidable quantities of pyroxyle would, in all probability, involve\r\na grave catastrophe; and at any rate, that this immense mass of eminently\r\ninflammable matter would inevitably ignite when submitted to the pressure\r\nof the projectile.\r\n\r\nThere were indeed dangers accruing as before from the carelessness of\r\nthe Americans, but Barbicane had set his heart on success, and took all\r\npossible precautions. In the first place, he was very careful as to the\r\ntransportation of the gun-cotton to Stones Hill. He had it conveyed in\r\nsmall quantities, carefully packed in sealed cases. These were brought\r\nby rail from Tampa Town to the camp, and from thence were taken to the\r\nColumbiad by barefooted workmen, who deposited them in their places by\r\nmeans of cranes placed at the orifice of the cannon. No steam-engine was\r\npermitted to work, and every fire was extinguished within two miles of\r\nthe works.\r\n\r\nEven in November they feared to work by day, lest the sun's rays acting\r\non the gun-cotton might lead to unhappy results. This led to their\r\nworking at night, by light produced in a vacuum by means of Rühmkorff's\r\napparatus, which threw an artificial brightness into the depths of the\r\nColumbiad. There the cartridges were arranged with the utmost regularity,\r\nconnected by a metallic thread, destined to communicate to them all\r\nsimultaneously the electric spark, by which means this mass of gun-cotton\r\nwas eventually to be ignited.\r\n\r\nBy the 28th of November 800 cartridges had been placed in the bottom\r\nof the Columbiad. So far the operation had been successful! But what\r\nconfusion, what anxieties, what struggles were undergone by President\r\nBarbicane! In vain had he refused admission to Stones Hill; every day\r\nthe inquisitive neighbours scaled the palisades, some even carrying\r\ntheir imprudence to the point of smoking while surrounded by bales of\r\ngun-cotton. Barbicane was in a perpetual state of alarm. J. T. Maston\r\nseconded him to the best of his ability, by giving vigorous chase to the\r\nintruders, and carefully picking up the still lighted cigar ends which\r\nthe Yankees threw about. A somewhat difficult task! seeing that more\r\nthan 300,000 persons were gathered round the enclosure. Michel Ardan\r\nhad volunteered to superintend the transport of the cartridges to the\r\nmouth of the Columbiad; but the president, having surprised him with an\r\nenormous cigar in his mouth, while he was hunting out the rash spectators\r\nto whom he himself offered so dangerous an example, saw that he could not\r\ntrust this fearless smoker, and was therefore obliged to mount a special\r\nguard over him.\r\n\r\nAt last, Providence being propitious, this wonderful loading came to\r\na happy termination, Captain Nicholl's third bet being thus lost. It\r\nremained now to introduce the projectile into the Columbiad, and to place\r\nit on its soft bed of gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nBut before doing this, all those things necessary for the journey had to\r\nbe carefully arranged in the projectile-vehicle. These necessaries were\r\nnumerous; and had Ardan been allowed to follow his own wishes, there\r\nwould have been no space remaining for the travellers. It is impossible\r\nto conceive of half the things this charming Frenchman wished to convey to\r\nthe moon. A veritable stock of useless trifles! But Barbicane interfered\r\nand refused admission to anything not absolutely needed. Several\r\nthermometers, barometers, and telescopes were packed in the instrument\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe travellers being desirous of examining the moon carefully during\r\ntheir voyage, in order to facilitate their studies, they took with them\r\nBœer and Moedler's excellent _Mappa Selenographica_, a masterpiece of\r\npatience and observation, which they hoped would enable them to identify\r\nthose physical features in the moon, with which they were acquainted.\r\nThis map reproduced with scrupulous fidelity the smallest details of the\r\nlunar surface which faces the earth; the mountains, valleys, craters,\r\npeaks, and ridges were all represented, with their exact dimensions,\r\nrelative positions, and names; from the mountains Doërfel and Leibnitz\r\non the eastern side of the disc, to the _Mare frigoris_ of the North\r\nPole.\r\n\r\nThey took also three rifles and three fowling-pieces, and a large quantity\r\nof balls, shot, and powder.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot tell whom we shall have to deal with,\" said Michel Ardan. \"Men\r\nor beasts may possibly object to our visit. It is only wise to take all\r\nprecautions.\"\r\n\r\nThese defensive weapons were accompanied by pickaxes, crowbars, saws,\r\nand other useful implements, not to mention clothing adapted to every\r\ntemperature, from that of the polar regions to that of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nArdan wished to convey a number of animals of different sorts (not\r\nindeed a pair of every known species), as he could not see the necessity\r\nof acclimatizing serpents, tigers, alligators, or any other noxious\r\nbeasts in the moon. \"Nevertheless,\" he said to Barbicane, \"some valuable\r\nand useful beasts, bullocks, cows, horses, and donkeys, would bear the\r\njourney very well, and would also be very useful to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say, my dear Ardan,\" replied the president, \"but our\r\nprojectile-vehicle is no Noah's ark, from which it differs both in\r\ndimensions and object. Let us confine ourselves to possibilities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE INTERIOR OF THE PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a prolonged discussion, it was agreed that the travellers should\r\nrestrict themselves to a sporting-dog belonging to Nicholl, and to a\r\nlarge Newfoundland. Several packets of seeds were also included among the\r\nnecessaries. Michel Ardan, indeed, was anxious to add some sacks full of\r\nearth to sow them in; as it was, he took a dozen shrubs carefully wrapped\r\nup in straw to plant in the moon.\r\n\r\nThe important question of provisions still remained; it being necessary\r\nto provide against the possibility of their finding the moon absolutely\r\nbarren. Barbicane managed so successfully, that he supplied them with\r\nsufficient rations for a year. These consisted of preserved meats and\r\nvegetables, reduced by strong hydraulic pressure to the smallest possible\r\ndimensions. They were also supplied with brandy, and took water enough\r\nfor two months, being confident, from astronomical observations, that\r\nthere was no lack of water on the moon's surface. As to provisions,\r\ndoubtless the inhabitants of the _earth_ would find nourishment somewhere\r\nin the _moon_. Ardan never questioned this; indeed, had he done so, he\r\nwould never have undertaken the journey.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" he said one day to his friends, \"we shall not be completely\r\nabandoned by our terrestrial friends; they will take care not to forget\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" replied J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing would be simpler,\" replied Ardan; \"the Columbiad will be always\r\nthere. Well! whenever the moon is in a favourable condition as to the\r\nzenith, if not to the perigee, that is to say about once a year, could\r\nyou not send us a shell packed with provisions, which we might expect on\r\nsome appointed day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" cried J. T. Maston; \"what an ingenious fellow! what a\r\nsplendid idea! Indeed, my good friends, we shall not forget you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall reckon upon you! Then, you see, we shall receive news regularly\r\nfrom the earth, and we shall indeed be stupid if we hit upon no plan for\r\ncommunicating with our good friends here!\"\r\n\r\nThese words inspired such confidence, that Michel Ardan carried all the\r\nGun Club with him in his enthusiasm. What he said seemed so simple and\r\nso easy, so sure of success, that none could be so sordidly attached to\r\nthis earth as to hesitate to follow the three travellers on their lunar\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nAll being ready at last, it remained to place the projectile in the\r\nColumbiad, an operation abundantly accompanied by dangers and difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe enormous shell was conveyed to the summit of Stones Hill. There,\r\npowerful cranes raised it, and held it suspended over the mouth of the\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nIt was a fearful moment! What if the chains should break under its\r\nenormous weight? The sudden fall of such a body would inevitably cause\r\nthe gun-cotton to explode!\r\n\r\nFortunately this did not happen; and some hours later the\r\nprojectile-vehicle descended gently into the heart of the cannon and\r\nrested on its couch of pyroxyle, a veritable bed of explosive eider-down.\r\nIts pressure had no result, other than the more effectual ramming down\r\nof the charge of the Columbiad.\r\n\r\n\"I have lost,\" said the Captain, who forthwith paid President Barbicane\r\nthe sum of 3000 dollars.\r\n\r\nBarbicane did not wish to accept the money from one of his\r\nfellow-travellers, but gave way at last before the determination of\r\nNicholl, who wished before leaving the earth to fulfil all his\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Michel Ardan, \"I have only one thing more to wish for you,\r\nmy brave Captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"It is that you may lose your two other bets! Then we shall be sure not\r\nto be stopped on our journey!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: AN INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE COVERED THE PRAIRIE ROUND STONE'S\r\nHILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n   FIRE!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of December had arrived! the fatal day! for, if the projectile\r\nwere not discharged that very night at 10h. 46m. 40s. p.m., more than\r\neighteen years must roll by before the moon would again present herself\r\nunder the same conditions of zenith and perigee.\r\n\r\nThe weather was magnificent. Despite the approach of winter, the sun\r\nshone brightly, and bathed in its radiant light that earth which three\r\nof its denizens were about to abandon for a new world.\r\n\r\nHow many persons lost their rest on the night which preceded this\r\nlong-expected day! All hearts beat with disquietude, save only the heart\r\nof Michel Ardan. That imperturbable personage came and went with his\r\nhabitual business-like air, while nothing whatever denoted that any\r\nunusual matter preoccupied his mind.\r\n\r\nAfter dawn, an innumerable multitude covered the prairie which extends,\r\nas far as the eye can reach, round Stones Hill. Every quarter of an hour\r\nthe railway brought fresh accessions of sightseers; and, according to\r\nthe statement of the _Tampa Town Observer_, not less than five millions\r\nof spectators thronged the soil of Florida.\r\n\r\nFor a whole month previously, the mass of these persons had bivouacked\r\nround the enclosure, and laid the foundations for a town which was\r\nafterwards called \"Ardan's Town.\" The whole plain was covered with huts,\r\ncottages, and tents. Every nation under the sun was represented there;\r\nand every language might be heard spoken at the same time. It was a\r\nperfect Babel re-enacted. All the various classes of American society were\r\nmingled together in terms of absolute equality. Bankers, farmers, sailors,\r\ncotton-planters, brokers, merchants, watermen, magistrates, elbowed\r\neach other in the most free-and-easy way. Louisiana Creoles fraternised\r\nwith farmers from Indiana; Kentucky and Tennessee gentlemen and haughty\r\nVirginians conversed with trappers and the half-savages of the lakes\r\nand butchers from Cincinnati. Broad-brimmed white hats and Panamas, blue\r\ncotton trowsers, light coloured stockings, cambric frills, were all here\r\ndisplayed; while upon shirt-fronts, wristbands, and neckties, upon every\r\nfinger, even upon the very _ears_, they wore an assortment of rings,\r\nshirt-pins, brooches, and trinkets, of which the value only equalled\r\nthe execrable taste. Women, children, and servants, in equally expensive\r\ndress, surrounded their husbands, fathers, or masters, who resembled the\r\npatriarchs of tribes in the midst of their immense households.\r\n\r\nAt meal-times, all fell to work upon the dishes peculiar to the Southern\r\nStates, and consumed with an appetite that threatened speedy exhaustion\r\nof the victualling powers of Florida, fricasseed frogs, stuffed monkey,\r\nfish chowder, underdone 'possum, and raccoon steaks. And as for the\r\nliquors which accompanied this indigestible repast! The shouts, the\r\nvociferations that resounded through the bars and taverns decorated with\r\nglasses, tankards, and bottles of marvellous shape, mortars for pounding\r\nsugar, and bundles of straws! \"Mint-julep!\" roars one of the barmen;\r\n\"Claret sangaree!\" shouts another; \"Cocktail!\" \"Brandy-smash!\" \"Real\r\nmint-julep in the new style!\" All these cries intermingled produced a\r\nbewildering and deafening hubbub.\r\n\r\nBut on this day, 1st December, such sounds were rare. No one thought\r\nof eating or drinking, and at four p.m. there were vast numbers of\r\nspectators who had not even taken their customary lunch! And, a still\r\nmore significant fact, even the national passion for play seemed quelled\r\nfor the time under the general excitement of the hour.\r\n\r\nUp till nightfall, a dull, noiseless agitation, such as precedes great\r\ncatastrophes, ran through the anxious multitude. An indescribable\r\nuneasiness pervaded all minds, an indefinable sensation which oppressed\r\nthe heart. Every one wished it was over.\r\n\r\nHowever, about seven o'clock, the heavy silence was dissipated. The moon\r\nrose above the horizon. Millions of hurrahs hailed her appearance. She\r\nwas punctual to the rendezvous, and shouts of welcome greeted her on all\r\nsides, as her pale beams shone gracefully in the clear heavens. At this\r\nmoment the three intrepid travellers appeared. This was the signal for\r\nrenewed cries of still greater intensity. Instantly the vast assemblage,\r\nas with one accord, struck up the national hymn of the United States,\r\nand \"Yankee Doodle,\" sung by five millions of hearty throats, rose like a\r\nroaring tempest to the farthest limits of the atmosphere. Then a profound\r\nsilence reigned throughout the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman and the two Americans had by this time entered the enclosure\r\nreserved in the centre of the multitude. They were accompanied by the\r\nmembers of the Gun Club, and by deputations sent from all the European\r\nObservatories. Barbicane, cool and collected, was giving his final\r\ndirections. Nicholl, with compressed lips, his arms crossed behind his\r\nback, walked with a firm and measured step. Michel Ardan, always easy,\r\ndressed in thorough traveller's costume, leathern gaiters on his legs,\r\npouch by his side, in loose velvet suit, cigar in mouth, was full of\r\ninexhaustible gaiety, laughing, joking, playing pranks with J. T. Maston.\r\nIn one word, he was the thorough \"Frenchman\" (and worse, a \"Parisian\")\r\nto the last moment.\r\n\r\nTen o'clock struck! The moment had arrived for taking their places in the\r\nprojectile! The necessary operations for the descent, and the subsequent\r\nremoval of the cranes and scaffolding that inclined over the mouth of\r\nthe Columbiad, required a certain period of time.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had regulated his chronometer to the tenth part of a second by\r\nthat of Murchison the engineer, who was charged with the duty of firing\r\nthe gun by means of an electric spark. Thus the travellers enclosed\r\nwithin the projectile were enabled to follow with their eyes the impassive\r\nneedle which marked the precise moment of their departure.\r\n\r\nThe moment had arrived for saying \"Good-bye!\" The scene was a touching\r\none. Despite his feverish gaiety, even Michel Ardan was touched. J. T.\r\nMaston had found in his own dry eyes one ancient tear, which he had\r\ndoubtless reserved for the occasion. He dropped it on the forehead of\r\nhis dear president.\r\n\r\n\"Can I not go?\" he said, \"there is still time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, old fellow!\" replied Barbicane. A few moments later, the\r\nthree fellow-travellers had ensconced themselves in the projectile, and\r\nscrewed down the plate which covered the entrance-aperture. The mouth of\r\nthe Columbiad, now completely disencumbered, was open entirely to the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThe moon advanced upwards in a heaven of the purest clearness, outshining\r\nin her passage the twinkling light of the stars. She passed over the\r\nconstellation of the Twins, and was now nearing the halfway point between\r\nthe horizon and the zenith. A terrible silence weighed upon the entire\r\nscene! Not a breath of wind upon the earth! not a sound of breathing\r\nfrom the countless chests of the spectators! Their hearts seemed afraid\r\nto beat! All eyes were fixed upon the yawning mouth of the Columbiad.\r\n\r\nMurchison followed with his eye the hand of his chronometer. It wanted\r\nscarce forty seconds to the moment of departure, but each second seemed\r\nto last an age! At the twentieth there was a general shudder, as it\r\noccurred to the minds of that vast assemblage that the bold travellers\r\nshut up within the projectile were also counting those terrible seconds.\r\nSome few cries here and there escaped the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-five!—thirty-six!—thirty-seven!—thirty-eight!—thirty-nine!\r\n—forty! Fire!!!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstantly Murchison pressed with his finger the key of the electric\r\nbattery, restored the current of the fluid, and discharged the spark into\r\nthe breach of the Columbiad.\r\n\r\nAn appalling unearthly report followed instantly, such as can be compared\r\nto nothing whatever known, not even to the roar of thunder, or the blast\r\nof volcanic explosions! No words can convey the slightest idea of the\r\nterrific sound! An immense spout of fire shot up from the bowels of the\r\nearth as from a crater. The earth heaved up, and with great difficulty\r\nsome few spectators obtained a momentary glimpse of the projectile\r\nvictoriously cleaving the air in the midst of the fiery vapours!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n   FOUL WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment when that pyramid of fire rose to a prodigious height into\r\nthe air, the glare of the flame lit up the whole of Florida; and for a\r\nmoment day superseded night over a considerable extent of the country.\r\nThis immense canopy of fire was perceived at a distance of 100 miles\r\nout at sea, and more than one ship's captain entered in his log the\r\nappearance of this gigantic meteor.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of the Columbiad was accompanied by a perfect earthquake.\r\nFlorida was shaken to its very depths. The gases of the powder, expanded\r\nby heat, forced back the atmospheric strata with tremendous violence,\r\nand this artificial hurricane rushed like a waterspout through the air.\r\n\r\nNot a single spectator remained on his feet! Men, women, children, all\r\nlay prostrate like ears of corn under a tempest. There ensued a terrible\r\ntumult; a large number of persons were seriously injured. J. T. Maston,\r\nwho, despite of all dictates of prudence had kept in advance of the mass,\r\nwas pitched back 120 feet, shooting like a projectile over the heads of\r\nhis fellow-citizens. Three hundred thousand persons remained deaf for a\r\ntime, and as though struck stupefied.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first effects were over, the injured, the deaf, and lastly,\r\nthe crowd in general, woke up with frenzied cries. \"Hurrah for Ardan!\r\nHurrah for Barbicane! Hurrah for Nicholl!\" rose to the skies. Thousands\r\nof persons, noses in air, armed with telescopes and race-glasses, were\r\nquestioning space, forgetting all contusions and emotions in the one idea\r\nof watching for the projectile. They looked in vain! It was no longer to\r\nbe seen, and they were obliged to wait for telegrams from Long's Peak.\r\nThe Director of the Cambridge Observatory was at his post on the Rocky\r\nMountains; and to him, as a skilful and persevering astronomer, all\r\nobservations had been confided.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: EFFECT OF THE EXPLOSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE DIRECTOR AT HIS POST.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut an unforeseen phenomenon came in to subject the public impatience to\r\na severe trial.\r\n\r\nThe weather, hitherto so fine, suddenly changed; the sky became heavy with\r\nclouds. It could not have been otherwise after the terrible derangement\r\nof the atmospheric strata, and the dispersion of the enormous quantity\r\nof vapour arising from the combustion of 200,000 lbs. of\r\npyroxyle!\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the horizon was covered with clouds—a thick and\r\nimpenetrable curtain between earth and sky, which unhappily extended as\r\nfar as the Rocky Mountains. It was a fatality! But since man had chosen\r\nso to disturb the atmosphere, he was bound to accept the consequences of\r\nhis experiment.\r\n\r\nSupposing, now, that the experiment had succeeded, the travellers having\r\nstarted on the 1st of December, at 10h. 46m. 40s. p.m., were due on\r\nthe 4th at 0h. p.m. at their destination. So that up to that time it\r\nwould have been very difficult after all to have observed, under such\r\nconditions, a body so small as the shell. Therefore they waited with what\r\npatience they might.\r\n\r\nFrom the 4th to the 6th of December inclusive, the weather remaining much\r\nthe same in America, the great European instruments of Herschel, Rosse,\r\nand Foucault, were constantly directed towards the moon, for the weather\r\nwas then magnificent; but the comparative weakness of their glasses\r\nprevented any trustworthy observations being made.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th the sky seemed to lighten. They were in hopes now, but their\r\nhope was of but short duration, and at night again thick clouds hid the\r\nstarry vault from all eyes.\r\n\r\nMatters were now becoming serious, when on the 9th, the sun reappeared\r\nfor an instant, as if for the purpose of teasing the Americans. It was\r\nreceived with hisses; and wounded, no doubt, by such a reception, showed\r\nitself very sparing of its rays.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, no change! J. T. Maston went nearly mad, and great fears\r\nwere entertained regarding the brain of this worthy individual, which\r\nhad hitherto been so well preserved within his gutta-percha cranium.\r\n\r\nBut on the 11th one of those inexplicable tempests peculiar to those\r\nintertropical regions was let loose in the atmosphere. A terrific east\r\nwind swept away the groups of clouds which had been so long gathering,\r\nand at night the semi-disc of the orb of night rode majestically amidst\r\nthe soft constellations of the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n   A NEW STAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat very night, the startling news so impatiently awaited, burst like\r\na thunderbolt over the United States of the Union, and thence, darting\r\nacross the ocean, ran through all the telegraphic wires of the globe.\r\nThe projectile had been detected, thanks to the gigantic reflector of\r\nLong's Peak! Here is the note received by the Director of the Observatory\r\nof Cambridge. It contains the scientific conclusion regarding this great\r\nexperiment of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\n\"Long's Peak December 12.\r\n\r\n\"To the Officers of the Observatory of Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\"The projectile discharged by the Columbiad at Stones Hill has been\r\ndetected by Messrs. Belfast and J. T. Maston, 12th December, at 8.47\r\np.m., the moon having entered her last quarter. This projectile has not\r\narrived at its destination. It has passed by the side; but sufficiently\r\nnear to be retained by the lunar attraction.\r\n\r\n\"The rectilinear movement has thus become changed into a circular motion\r\nof extreme velocity, and it is now pursuing an elliptical orbit round\r\nthe moon, of which it has become a true satellite.\r\n\r\n\"The elements of this new star we have as yet been unable to determine;\r\nwe do not yet know the velocity of its passage. The distance which\r\nseparates it from the surface of the moon may be estimated at about 2833\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\"However, two hypothesis come here into our consideration.\r\n\r\n\"1. Either the attraction of the moon will end by drawing them into\r\nitself, and the travellers will attain their destination; or,—\r\n\r\n\"2. The projectile, following an immutable law, will continue to gravitate\r\nround the moon till the end of time.\r\n\r\n\"At some future time, our observations will be able to determine this\r\npoint, but till then the experiment of the Gun Club can have no other\r\nresult than to have provided our solar system with a new star.\r\n\r\n\"J. Belfast.\"\r\n\r\nTo how many questions did this unexpected denouement give rise? What\r\nmysterious results was the future reserving for the investigations of\r\nscience? At all events, the names of Nicholl, Barbicane, and Michel Ardan\r\nwere certain to be immortalized in the annals of astronomy!\r\n\r\nWhen the despatch from Long's Peak had once become known, there was but\r\none universal feeling of surprise and alarm. Was it possible to go to the\r\naid of these bold travellers? No! for they had placed themselves beyond\r\nthe pale of humanity, by crossing the limits imposed by the Creator on\r\nhis earthly creatures. They had air enough for _two_ months; they had\r\nvictuals enough for _twelve;—but after that?_ There was only one man\r\nwho would not admit that the situation was desperate,—he alone had\r\nconfidence; and that was their devoted friend J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\nBesides, he never let them get out of sight. His home was henceforth the\r\npost at Long's Peak; his horizon, the mirror of that immense reflector.\r\nAs soon as the moon rose above the horizon, he immediately caught her in\r\nthe field of the telescope; he never let her go for an instant out of\r\nhis sight, and followed her assiduously in her course through the stellar\r\nspaces. He watched with untiring patience the passage of the projectile\r\nacross her silvery disc, and really the worthy man remained in perpetual\r\ncommunication with his three friends, whom he did not despair of seeing\r\nagain some day.\r\n\r\n\"Those three men,\" said he, \"have carried into space all the resources\r\nof art, science, and industry. With that, one can do anything; and you\r\nwill see that, some day, they will come out all right.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   ROUND THE MOON:\r\n\r\n   A Sequel To\r\n\r\n   FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON.\r\n\r\n      ——————\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   PRELIMINARY CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n   RECAPITULATING THE FIRST PART OF THIS WORK, AND\r\n      SERVING AS A PREFACE TO THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the year 186—, the whole world was greatly excited by a scientific\r\nexperiment unprecedented in the annals of science. The members of the\r\nGun Club, a circle of artillerymen formed at Baltimore after the American\r\nwar, conceived the idea of putting themselves in communication with the\r\nmoon!—yes, with the moon,—by sending to her a projectile. Their\r\npresident, Barbicane, the promoter of the enterprise, having consulted\r\nthe astronomers of the Cambridge Observatory upon the subject, took all\r\nnecessary means to ensure the success of this extraordinary enterprise,\r\nwhich had been declared practicable by the majority of competent judges.\r\nAfter setting on foot a public subscription, which realized nearly\r\n1,200,000_l._ they began the gigantic work.\r\n\r\nAccording to the advice forwarded from the members of the Observatory,\r\nthe gun destined to launch the projectile had to be fixed in a country\r\nsituated between the 0 and 28th degrees of north or south latitude, in\r\norder to aim at the moon when at the zenith; and its initiatory velocity\r\nwas fixed at twelve thousand yards to the second. Launched on the 1st\r\nof December, at 10hrs. 46m. 40s. p.m., it ought to reach the moon four\r\ndays after its departure, that is on the 5th of December, at midnight\r\nprecisely, at the moment of her attaining her _perigee_, that is her\r\nnearest distance from the earth, which is exactly 86,410 leagues (French),\r\nor 238,833 miles _mean distance_ (English).\r\n\r\nThe principal members of the Gun Club, President Barbicane, Major\r\nElphinstone, the secretary Joseph T. Maston, and other learned men, held\r\nseveral meetings, at which the shape and composition of the projectile\r\nwere discussed, also the position and nature of the gun, and the quality\r\nand quantity of the powder to be used. It was decided: 1st, that the\r\nprojectile should be a shell made of aluminium with a diameter of 108\r\ninches and a thickness of twelve inches to its walls; and should weigh\r\n19,250 lbs. 2ndly, that the gun should be a Columbiad cast in iron,\r\n900 feet long, and run perpendicularly into the earth. 3rdly, that the\r\ncharge should contain 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton, which, giving out\r\nsix billions of litres of gas in rear of the projectile, would easily\r\ncarry it towards the orb of night.\r\n\r\nThese questions determined President Barbicane, assisted by Murchison\r\nthe engineer, to choose a spot situated in Florida, in 27° 7' North\r\nlatitude, and 77° 3' West (Greenwich) longitude. It was on this spot,\r\nafter stupendous labour, that the Columbiad was cast with full success.\r\nThings stood thus, when an incident took place which increased the\r\ninterest attached to this great enterprise a hundredfold.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman, an enthusiastic Parisian, as witty as he was bold, asked\r\nto be enclosed in the projectile, in order that he might reach the moon,\r\nand reconnoitre this terrestrial satellite. The name of this intrepid\r\nadventurer was Michel Ardan. He landed in America, was received with\r\nenthusiasm, held meetings, saw himself carried in triumph, reconciled\r\nPresident Barbicane to his mortal enemy, Captain Nicholl, and, as a\r\ntoken of reconciliation, persuaded them both to start with him in the\r\nprojectile. The proposition being accepted, the shape of the projectile\r\nwas slightly altered. It was made of a cylindro-conical form. This species\r\nof aerial car was lined with strong springs and partitions to deaden the\r\nshock of departure. It was provided with food for a year, water for some\r\nmonths, and gas for some days. A self-acting apparatus supplied the three\r\ntravellers with air to breathe. At the same time, on one of the highest\r\npoints of the Rocky Mountains, the Gun Club had a gigantic telescope\r\nerected, in order that they might be able to follow the course of the\r\nprojectile through space. All was then ready.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th November, at the hour fixed upon, from the midst of an\r\nextraordinary crowd of spectators, the departure took place; and for the\r\nfirst time, three human beings quitted the terrestrial globe, and launched\r\ninto interplanetary space with almost a certainty of reaching their\r\ndestination. These bold travellers, Michel Ardan, President Barbicane,\r\nand Captain Nicholl, ought to make the passage in ninety-seven hours,\r\nthirteen minutes, and twenty seconds. Consequently, their arrival on\r\nthe lunar disc could not take place until the 5th December at twelve at\r\nnight, at the exact moment when the moon should be full, and not on the\r\n4th, as some badly-informed journals had announced.\r\n\r\nBut an unforeseen circumstance, viz., the detonation produced by\r\nthe Columbiad, had the immediate effect of troubling the terrestrial\r\natmosphere, by accumulating a large quantity of vapour, a phenomenon\r\nwhich excited universal indignation, for the moon was hidden from the\r\neyes of the watchers for several nights.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Joseph T. Maston, the staunchest friend of the three\r\ntravellers, started for the Rocky Mountains, accompanied by the Hon. J.\r\nBelfast, director of the Cambridge Observatory, and reached the station\r\nof Long's Peak, where the telescope was erected which brought the moon\r\nwithin an apparent distance of two leagues. The honorable secretary of\r\nthe Gun Club wished himself to observe the vehicle of his daring friends.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of clouds in the atmosphere prevented all observations\r\non the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th of December. Indeed it was\r\nthought that all observations would have to be put off to the 3rd of\r\nJanuary in the following year; for the moon entering its last quarter on\r\nthe 11th, would then only present an ever-decreasing portion of her disc,\r\ninsufficient to allow of their following the course of the projectile.\r\n\r\nAt length, to the general satisfaction, a heavy storm cleared the\r\natmosphere on the night of the 11th and 12th December, and the moon, with\r\nhalf illuminated disc, was plainly to be seen upon the black\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThat very night a telegram was sent from the station of Long's Peak\r\nby Joseph T. Maston and Belfast to the gentlemen of the Cambridge\r\nObservatory, announcing that on the 11th of December at 8h. 47m. p.m.,\r\nthe projectile launched by the Columbiad of Stones Hill had been detected\r\nby Messrs. Belfast and Maston,—that it had deviated from its course\r\nfrom some unknown cause, and had not reached its destination; but that\r\nit had passed near enough to be retained by the lunar attraction; that\r\nits rectilinear movement had been changed to a circular one, and that\r\nfollowing an elliptical orbit round the star of night it had become its\r\n_satellite._ The telegram added that the elements of this new star had\r\nnot yet been calculated; and indeed three observations made upon a star\r\nin three different positions are necessary to determine these elements.\r\nThen it showed that the distance separating the projectile from the lunar\r\nsurface \"might\" be reckoned at about 2833 miles.\r\n\r\nIt ended with this double hypothesis; either the attraction of the moon\r\nwould draw it to herself, and the travellers thus attain their end; or\r\nthat the projectile, held in one immutable orbit, would gravitate around\r\nthe lunar disc to all eternity.\r\n\r\nWith such alternatives, what would be the fate of the travellers?\r\nCertainly they had food for some time. But supposing they did succeed\r\nin their rash enterprise, how would they return? Could they ever return?\r\nShould they hear from them? These questions, debated by the most learned\r\npens of the day, strongly engrossed the public attention.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable here to make a remark which ought to be well considered\r\nby hasty observers. When a purely speculative discovery is announced to\r\nthe public, it cannot be done with too much prudence. No one is obliged\r\nto discover either a planet, a comet, or a satellite; and whoever makes\r\na mistake in such a case exposes himself justly to the derision of the\r\nmass. Far better is it to wait; and that is what the impatient Joseph T.\r\nMaston should have done before sending this telegram forth to the world,\r\nwhich, according to his idea, told the whole result of the enterprise.\r\nIndeed this telegram contained two sorts of errors, as was proved\r\neventually. 1st, errors of observation, concerning the distance of the\r\nprojectile from the surface of the moon, for on the 11th December it was\r\nimpossible to see it; and what Joseph T. Maston had seen, or thought he\r\nsaw, could not have been the projectile of the Columbiad. 2ndly, errors\r\nof theory on the fate in store for the said projectile; for in making it\r\na satellite of the moon, it was putting it in direct contradiction to\r\nall mechanical laws.\r\n\r\nOne single hypothesis of the observers of Long's Peak could ever be\r\nrealized, that which foresaw the case of the travellers (if still alive)\r\nuniting their efforts with the lunar attraction to attain the surface of\r\nthe disc.\r\n\r\nNow these men, as clever as they were daring, _had_ survived the terrible\r\nshock consequent on their departure, and it is their journey in the\r\nprojectile car which is here related in its most dramatic as well as in\r\nits most singular details. This recital will destroy many illusions and\r\nsurmises; but it will give a true idea of the singular changes in store\r\nfor such an enterprise; it will bring out the scientific instincts of\r\nBarbicane, the industrious resources of Nicholl, and the audacious humour\r\nof Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nBesides this, it will prove that their worthy friend, Joseph T. Maston,\r\nwas wasting his time, while leaning over the gigantic telescope he\r\nwatched the course of the moon through the starry space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n   FROM TWENTY MINUTES PAST TEN TO FORTY-SEVEN MINUTES\r\n      PAST TEN P.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs ten o'clock struck, Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl, took leave\r\nof the numerous friends they were leaving on the earth. The two dogs,\r\ndestined to propagate the canine race on the lunar continents, were\r\nalready shut up in the projectile.\r\n\r\nThe three travellers approached the orifice of the enormous cast-iron\r\ntube, and a crane let them down to the conical top of the projectile.\r\nThere, an opening made for the purpose gave them access to the aluminium\r\ncar. The tackle belonging to the crane being hauled from outside, the\r\nmouth of the Columbiad was instantly disencumbered of its last supports.\r\n\r\nNicholl, once introduced with his companions inside the projectile,\r\nbegan to close the opening by means of a strong plate, held in position\r\nby powerful screws. Other plates, closely fitted, covered the lenticular\r\nglasses, and the travellers, hermetically enclosed in their metal prison,\r\nwere plunged in profound darkness.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dear companions,\" said Michel Ardan, \"let us make ourselves\r\nat home; I am a domesticated man and strong in housekeeping. We are bound\r\nto make the best of our new lodgings, and make ourselves comfortable.\r\nAnd first let us try and see a little. Gas was not invented for moles.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the thoughtless fellow lit a match by striking it on the\r\nsole of his boot; and approached the burner fixed to the receptacle,\r\nin which the carbonized hydrogen, stored at high pressure, sufficed for\r\nthe lighting and warming of the projectile for a hundred and forty-four\r\nhours, or six days and six nights. The gas caught fire, and thus lighted\r\nthe projectile looked like a comfortable room with thickly padded walls,\r\nfurnished with a circular divan, and a roof rounded in the shape of a\r\ndome.\r\n\r\nThe objects it contained, arms, instruments, and utensils securely\r\nfastened against the rounds of wadding, could bear the shock of departure\r\nwith impunity. Humanly speaking, every possible precaution had been taken\r\nto bring this rash experiment to a successful termination.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan examined everything, and declared himself satisfied with\r\nhis installation.\r\n\r\n\"It is a prison,\" said he, \"but a travelling prison; and, with the right\r\nof putting my nose to the window, I could well stand a lease of a hundred\r\nyears. You smile, Barbicane. Have you any _arrière-pensée?_ Do you say\r\nto yourself, 'This prison may be our tomb?' Tomb, perhaps; still I would\r\nnot change it for Mahomet's, which floats in space but never advances an\r\ninch!\"\r\n\r\nWhilst Michel Ardan was speaking, Barbicane and Nicholl were making their\r\nlast preparations.\r\n\r\nNicholl's chronometer marked twenty minutes past ten p.m. when the three\r\ntravellers were finally enclosed in their projectile. This chronometer\r\nwas set within the tenth of a second by that of Murchison the engineer.\r\nBarbicane consulted it.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"it is twenty minutes past ten. At forty-seven\r\nminutes past ten Murchison will launch the electric spark on the wire\r\nwhich communicates with the charge of the Columbiad. At that precise\r\nmoment we shall leave our spheroid. Thus we have still twenty-seven\r\nminutes to remain on the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-six minutes thirteen seconds,\" replied the methodical Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, in a good-humoured tone, \"much may be\r\ndone in twenty-six minutes. The gravest questions of morals and politics\r\nmay be discussed, and even solved. Twenty-six minutes well employed are\r\nworth more than twenty-six years in which nothing is done. Some\r\n_seconds_ of a Pascal or a Newton are more precious than the whole\r\nexistence of a crowd of raw simpletons—\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE GAS CAUGHT FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And you conclude, then, you everlasting talker?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"I conclude that we have twenty-six minutes left,\" replied Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-four only,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, twenty-four, if you like, my noble captain,\" said Ardan;\r\n\"twenty-four minutes in which to investigate—\"\r\n\r\n\"Michel,\" said Barbicane, \"during the passage we shall have plenty of\r\ntime to investigate the most difficult questions. For the present we must\r\noccupy ourselves with our departure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we not ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless; but there are still some precautions to be taken, to deaden\r\nas much as possible the first shock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have we not the water-cushions placed between the partition-breaks,\r\nwhose elasticity will sufficiently protect us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, Michel,\" replied Barbicane gently, \"but I am not sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the joker!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan. \"He hopes!—He is not\r\nsure!—and he waits for the moment when we are encased to make this\r\ndeplorable admission! I beg to be allowed to get out!\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said Michel Ardan, \"it is not easy; we are in the train, and\r\nthe guard's whistle will sound before twenty-four minutes are over.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Twenty_,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\nFor some moments the three travellers looked at each other. Then they\r\nbegan to examine the objects imprisoned with them.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is in its place,\" said Barbicane. \"We have now to decide how\r\nwe can best place ourselves to resist the shock. Position cannot be an\r\nindifferent matter; and we must, as much as possible, prevent the rush\r\nof blood to the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied Michel Ardan, ready to suit the action to the word, \"let\r\nus put our heads down and our feet in the air, like the clowns in the\r\ngrand circus.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Barbicane, \"let us stretch ourselves on our sides; we shall\r\nresist the shock better that way. Remember that, when the projectile\r\nstarts, it matters little whether we are in it or before it; it amounts\r\nto much the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is only 'much the same thing,' I may cheer up,\" said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Do you approve of my idea, Nicholl?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Entirely,\" replied the captain. \"We've still thirteen minutes and a\r\nhalf.\"\r\n\r\n\"That Nicholl is not a man,\" exclaimed Michel; \"he is a chronometer with\r\nseconds, an escape, and eight holes.\"\r\n\r\nBut his companions were not listening; they were taking up their last\r\npositions with the most perfect coolness. They were like two methodical\r\ntravellers in a car, seeking to place themselves as comfortably as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWe might well ask ourselves of what materials are the hearts of these\r\nAmericans made, to whom the approach of the most frightful danger added\r\nno pulsation.\r\n\r\nThree thick and solidly-made couches had been placed in the projectile.\r\nNicholl and Barbicane placed them in the centre of the disc forming the\r\nfloor. There the three travellers were to stretch themselves some moments\r\nbefore their departure.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Ardan, not being able to keep still, turned in his\r\nnarrow prison like a wild beast in a cage, chatting with his friends,\r\nspeaking to the dogs Diana and Satellite, to whom, as may be seen, he\r\nhad given significant names.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Diana! Ah, Satellite!\" he exclaimed, teazing them; \"so you are going\r\nto show the moon-dogs the good habits of the dogs of the earth! That\r\nwill do honour to the canine race! If ever we do come down again, I will\r\nbring a cross type of 'moon-dogs,' which will make a stir!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: DIANA AND SATELLITE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If there _are_ dogs in the moon,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"There are,\" said Michel Ardan, \"just as there are horses, cows, donkeys,\r\nand chickens. I bet that we shall find chickens.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred dollars we shall find none!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Done, my captain!\" replied Ardan, clasping Nicholl's hand. \"But, by\r\nthe bye, you have already lost three bets with our president, as the\r\nnecessary funds for the enterprise have been found, as the operation of\r\ncasting has been successful, and lastly, as the Columbiad has been loaded\r\nwithout accident, six thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Nicholl. \"Thirty-seven minutes six seconds past ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is understood, captain. Well, before another quarter of an hour\r\nyou will have to count 9000 dollars to the president; 4000 because the\r\nColumbiad will not burst, and 5000 because the projectile will rise more\r\nthan six miles in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the dollars,\" replied Nicholl, slapping the pocket of his coat.\r\n\"I only ask to be allowed to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Nicholl, I see that you are a man of method, which I could never\r\nbe; but indeed you have made a series of bets of very little advantage\r\nto yourself, allow me to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Because, if you gain the first, the Columbiad will have burst, and the\r\nprojectile with it; and Barbicane will no longer be there to reimburse\r\nyour dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"My stake is deposited at the bank in Baltimore,\" replied Barbicane\r\nsimply; \"and if Nicholl is not there, it will go to his heirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you practical men!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan; \"I admire you the more\r\nfor not being able to understand you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-two minutes past ten!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Only five minutes more!\" answered Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, five little minutes!\" replied Michel Ardan; \"and we are enclosed\r\nin a projectile, at the bottom of a gun 900 feet long! And under this\r\nprojectile are rammed 400,000 lbs. of gun-cotton, which is equal to\r\n1,600,000 lbs. of ordinary powder! And friend Murchison, with his\r\nchronometer in hand, his eye fixed on the needle, his finger on the\r\nelectric apparatus, is counting the seconds preparatory to launching us\r\ninto interplanetary space.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, Michel, enough!\" said Barbicane, in a serious voice; \"let us\r\nprepare. A few instants alone separate us from an eventful moment. One\r\nclasp of the hand, my friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, more moved than he wished to appear; and\r\nthe three bold companions were united in a last embrace.\r\n\r\n\"God preserve us!\" said the religious Barbicane.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan and Nicholl stretched themselves on the couches placed in\r\nthe centre of the disc.\r\n\r\n\"Forty seven minutes past ten!\" murmured the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty seconds more!\" Barbicane quickly put out the gas and lay down by\r\nhis companions, and the profound silence was only broken by the ticking\r\nof the chronometer marking the seconds.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a dreadful shock was felt, and the projectile, under the force\r\nof six billions of litres of gas, developed by the combustion of the\r\npyroxyle, mounted into space.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE COURAGEOUS FRENCHMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n   THE FIRST HALF-HOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat had happened? What effect had this frightful shock produced? Had\r\nthe ingenuity of the constructors of the projectile obtained any happy\r\nresult? Had the shock been deadened, thanks to the springs, the four\r\nplugs, the water-cushions, and the partition-breaks? Had they been able\r\nto subdue the frightful pressure of the initiatory speed of more than\r\n11,000 yards, which was enough to traverse Paris or New York in a second?\r\nThis was evidently the question suggested to the thousand spectators\r\nof this moving scene. They forgot the aim of the journey, and thought\r\nonly of the travellers. And if one amongst them—Joseph T. Maston for\r\nexample—could have cast one glimpse into the projectile, what would he\r\nhave seen?\r\n\r\nNothing then. The darkness was profound. But its cylindro-conical\r\npartitions had resisted wonderfully. Not a rent or a dent anywhere! The\r\nwonderful projectile was not even heated under the intense deflagration\r\nof the powder, nor liquefied, as they seemed to fear, in a shower of\r\naluminium.\r\n\r\nThe interior showed but little disorder; indeed, only a few objects had\r\nbeen violently thrown towards the roof; but the most important seemed\r\nnot to have suffered from the shock at all; their fixtures were intact.\r\n\r\nOn the movable disc, sunk down to the bottom by the smashing of the\r\npartition-breaks and the escape of the water, three bodies lay apparently\r\nlifeless. Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan— did they still breathe?\r\nor was the projectile nothing now but a metal coffin, bearing three\r\ncorpses into space?\r\n\r\nSome minutes after the departure of the projectile, one of the bodies\r\nmoved, shook its arms, lifted its head, and finally succeeded in getting\r\non its knees. It was Michel Ardan. He felt himself all over, gave a\r\nsonorous \"Hem!\" and then said,—\r\n\r\n\"Michel Ardan is whole. How about the others?\"\r\n\r\nThe courageous Frenchman tried to rise, but could not stand. His head\r\nswam, from the rush of blood; he was blind; he was like a drunken man.\r\n\r\n\"Bur-r!\" said he. \"It produces the same effect as two bottles of Corton,\r\nthough perhaps less agreeable to swallow.\" Then, passing his hand several\r\ntimes across his forehead and rubbing his temples, he called in a firm\r\nvoice,—\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl! Barbicane!\"\r\n\r\nHe waited anxiously. No answer; not even a sigh to show that the hearts\r\nof his companions were still beating. He called again. The same silence.\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" he exclaimed. They look as if they had fallen from a fifth\r\nstory on their heads. \"Bah!\" he added, with that imperturbable confidence\r\nwhich nothing could check, \"if a Frenchman can get on his knees, two\r\nAmericans ought to be able to get on their feet. But first let us light\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nArdan felt the tide of life return by degrees. His blood became calm,\r\nand returned to its accustomed circulation. Another effort restored his\r\nequilibrium. He succeeded in rising, drew a match from his pocket, and\r\napproaching the burner lighted it. The receiver had not suffered at all.\r\nThe gas had not escaped. Besides, the smell would have betrayed it; and\r\nin that case Michel Ardan could not have carried a lighted match with\r\nimpunity through the space filled with hydrogen. The gas mixing with the\r\nair would have produced a detonating mixture, and the explosion would\r\nhave finished what the shock had perhaps begun. When the burner was lit,\r\nArdan leaned over the bodies of his companions: they were lying one on\r\nthe other, an inert mass, Nicholl above, Barbicane underneath.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THEY RAISED BARBICANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nArdan lifted the captain, propped him up against the divan, and began to\r\nrub vigorously. This means, used with judgment, restored Nicholl, who\r\nopened his eyes, and instantly recovering his presence of mind, seized\r\nArdan's hand and looked around him.\r\n\r\n\"And Barbicane?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Each in turn,\" replied Michel Ardan. \"I began with you, Nicholl, because\r\nyou were on the top. Now let us look to Barbicane.\" Saying which, Ardan\r\nand Nicholl raised the president of the Gun Club and laid him on the\r\ndivan. He seemed to have suffered more than either of his companions; he\r\nwas bleeding, but Nicholl was reassured by finding that the hemorrhage\r\ncame from a slight wound on the shoulder, a mere graze, which he bound\r\nup carefully.\r\n\r\nStill, Barbicane was a long time coming to himself, which frightened his\r\nfriends, who did not spare friction.\r\n\r\n\"He breathes though,\" said Nicholl, putting his ear to the chest of the\r\nwounded man.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Ardan, \"he breathes like a man who has some notion of that\r\ndaily operation. Rub, Nicholl; let us rub harder.\" And the two improvised\r\npractitioners worked so hard and so well that Barbicane recovered his\r\nsenses. He opened his eyes, sat up, took his two friends by the hands,\r\nand his first words were—\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl, are we moving?\"\r\n\r\nNicholl and Barbicane looked at each other; they had not yet troubled\r\nthemselves about the projectile; their first thought had been for the\r\ntraveller, not for the car.\r\n\r\n\"Well, are we really moving?\" repeated Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Or quietly resting on the soil of Florida?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Or at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico?\" added Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"What an idea!\" exclaimed the president.\r\n\r\nAnd this double hypothesis suggested by his companions had the effect\r\nof recalling him to his senses. In any case they could not yet decide\r\non the position of the projectile. Its apparent immovability, and the\r\nwant of communication with the outside, prevented them from solving the\r\nquestion. Perhaps the projectile was unwinding its course through space.\r\nPerhaps after a short rise it had fallen upon the earth, or even in the\r\nGulf of Mexico—a fall which the narrowness of the peninsula of Florida\r\nwould render not impossible.\r\n\r\nThe case was serious, the problem interesting, and one that must be\r\nsolved as soon as possible. Thus, highly excited, Barbicane's moral\r\nenergy triumphed over physical weakness, and he rose to his feet. He\r\nlistened. Outside was perfect silence; but the thick padding was enough\r\nto intercept all sounds coming from the earth. But one circumstance\r\nstruck Barbicane, viz., that the temperature inside the projectile was\r\nsingularly high. The president drew a thermometer from its case and\r\nconsulted it. The instrument showed 81° Fahr.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he exclaimed, \"yes, we are moving! This stifling heat, penetrating\r\nthrough the partitions of the projectile, is produced by its friction on\r\nthe atmospheric strata. It will soon diminish, because we are already\r\nfloating in space, and after having been nearly stifled, we shall have\r\nto suffer intense cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Michel Ardan. \"According to your showing, Barbicane, we are\r\nalready beyond the limits of the terrestrial atmosphere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without a doubt, Michel. Listen to me. It is fifty-five minutes past\r\nten; we have been gone about eight minutes; and if our initiatory speed\r\nhas not been checked by the friction, six seconds would be enough for us\r\nto pass through the forty miles of atmosphere which surrounds the globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Nicholl; \"but in what proportion do you estimate the\r\ndiminution of speed by friction?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the proportion of one-third, Nicholl. This diminution is considerable,\r\nbut according to my calculations it is nothing less. If, then, we had\r\nan initiatory speed of 12,000 yards, on leaving the atmosphere this\r\nspeed would be reduced to 9165 yards. In any case we have already passed\r\nthrough this interval, and—\"\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" said Michel Ardan, \"friend Nicholl has lost his two bets:\r\nfour thousand dollars because the Columbiad did not burst; five thousand\r\ndollars because the projectile has risen more than six miles. Now,\r\nNicholl, pay up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us prove it first,\" said the captain, \"and we will pay afterwards.\r\nIt is quite possible that Barbicane's reasoning is correct, and that I\r\nhave lost my nine thousand dollars. But a new hypothesis presents itself\r\nto my mind, and it annuls the wager.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Barbicane quickly.\r\n\r\n\"The hypothesis that, for some reason or other, fire was never set to\r\nthe powder, we have not started at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"My goodness, captain,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"that hypothesis is\r\nworthy of my brain! It cannot be a serious one. For have we not been\r\nhalf annihilated by the shock? Did I not recall you to life? Is not the\r\npresident's shoulder still bleeding from the blow it has received?\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted,\" replied Nicholl; \"but one question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the detonation, which certainly ought to be loud?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Ardan, much surprised; \"certainly I did not hear the\r\ndetonation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Barbicane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well now,\" murmured the president \"why did we not hear the detonation?\"\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked at each other with a disconcerted air. It\r\nwas quite an inexplicable phenomenon. The projectile had started, and\r\nconsequently there must have been a detonation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us first find out where we are,\" said Barbicane, \"and let down the\r\npanel.\"\r\n\r\nThis very simple operation was soon accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe nuts which held the bolts to the outer plates of the right-hand\r\nscuttle gave way under the pressure of the English wrench. These bolts\r\nwere pushed outside, and buffers covered with india-rubber stopped up\r\nthe holes which let them through. Immediately the outer plate fell back\r\nupon its hinges like a porthole, and the lenticular glass which closed\r\nthe scuttle appeared. A similar one was let into the thick partition on\r\nthe opposite side of the projectile, another in the top of the dome, and\r\nfinally a fourth in the middle of the base. They could, therefore, make\r\nobservations in four different directions: the firmament by the side\r\nand most direct windows, the earth or the moon by the upper and under\r\nopenings in the projectile.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his two companions immediately rushed to the uncovered\r\nwindow. But it was lit by no ray of light. Profound darkness surrounded\r\nthem, which, however, did not prevent the president from exclaiming,—\r\n\r\n\"No, my friends, we have not fallen back upon the earth; no, nor are we\r\nsubmerged in the Gulf of Mexico. Yes! we are mounting into space. See\r\nthose stars shining in the night, and that impenetrable darkness heaped\r\nup between the earth and us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan and Nicholl in one voice.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this thick darkness proved that the projectile had left the earth,\r\nfor the soil, brilliantly lit by the moonbeams, would have been visible\r\nto the travellers, if they had been lying on its surface. This darkness\r\nalso showed that the projectile had passed the atmospheric strata, for\r\nthe diffused light spread in the air would have been reflected on the\r\nmetal walls, which reflection was wanting. This light would have lit\r\nthe window, and the window was dark. Doubt was no longer possible; the\r\ntravellers had left the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: IT WAS AN ENORMOUS DISC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have lost,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you,\" replied Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Here are the nine thousand dollars,\" said the captain, drawing a roll\r\nof paper dollars from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Will you have a receipt for it?\" asked Barbicane, taking the sum.\r\n\r\n\"If you do not mind,\" answered Nicholl; \"it is more business-like.\"\r\n\r\nAnd coolly and seriously, as if he had been at his strong-box, the\r\npresident drew forth his note-book, tore out a blank leaf, wrote a proper\r\nreceipt in pencil, dated and signed it with the usual flourish,* and gave\r\nit to the captain, who carefully placed it in his pocketbook. Michel\r\nArdan, taking off his hat, bowed to his two companions without speaking.\r\nSo much formality under such circumstances left him speechless. He had\r\nnever before seen anything so \"American.\"\r\n\r\n* This is a purely French habit.\r\n\r\nThis affair settled, Barbicane and Nicholl had returned to the window,\r\nand were watching the constellations. The stars looked like bright points\r\non the black sky. But from that side they could not see the orb of night,\r\nwhich, travelling from east to west, would rise by degrees towards the\r\nzenith. Its absence drew the following remark from Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"And the moon; will she perchance fail at our rendezvous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not alarm yourself,\" said Barbicane; \"our future globe is at its\r\npost, but we cannot see her from this side; let us open the other.\"\r\n\r\nAs Barbicane was about leaving the window to open the opposite scuttle,\r\nhis attention was attracted by the approach of a brilliant object. It\r\nwas an enormous disc, whose colossal dimension could not be estimated.\r\nIts face, which was turned to the earth, was very bright. One might have\r\nthought it a small moon reflecting the light of the larger one. She\r\nadvanced with great speed, and seemed to describe an orbit round the\r\nearth, which would intersect the passage of the projectile. This body\r\nrevolved upon its axis, and exhibited the phenomena of all celestial\r\nbodies abandoned in space.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"what is that? another projectile?\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane did not answer. The appearance of this enormous body surprised\r\nand troubled him. A collision was possible, and might be attended with\r\ndeplorable results; either the projectile would deviate from its path,\r\nor a shock, breaking its impetus, might precipitate it to the earth; or,\r\nlastly, it might be irresistibly drawn away by the powerful asteroid. The\r\npresident caught at a glance the consequences of these three hypotheses,\r\neither of which would, one way or the other, bring their experiment to\r\nan unsuccessful and fatal termination. His companions stood silently\r\nlooking into space. The object grew rapidly as it approached them, and\r\nby an optical illusion the projectile seemed to be throwing itself before\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"we shall run into one another!\"\r\n\r\nInstinctively the travellers drew back. Their dread was great, but it\r\ndid not last many seconds. The asteroid passed several hundred yards\r\nfrom the projectile and disappeared, not so much from the rapidity of\r\nits course, as that its face being opposite the moon, it was suddenly\r\nmerged into the perfect darkness of space.\r\n\r\n\"A happy journey to you,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, with a sigh of relief.\r\n\"Surely infinity of space is large enough for a poor little projectile\r\nto walk through without fear. Now, what is this portentous globe which\r\nnearly struck us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! you know everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" said Barbicane, \"a simple meteorite, but an enormous one, which\r\nthe attraction of the earth has retained as a satellite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan; \"the earth then has two moons\r\nlike Neptune?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friend, two moons, though it passes generally for having only\r\none; but this second moon is so small, and its speed so great, that the\r\ninhabitants of the earth cannot see it. It was by noticing disturbances\r\nthat a French astronomer, M. Petit, was able to determine the existence\r\nof this second satellite and calculate its elements. According to his\r\nobservations, this meteorite will accomplish its revolution round the\r\nearth in three hours and twenty minutes, which implies a wonderful rate\r\nof speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Barbicane; \"but if, like us, they had met it, they could\r\nno longer doubt it. Indeed, I think that this meteorite, which, had it\r\nstruck the projectile, would have much embarrassed us, will give us the\r\nmeans of deciding what our position in space is.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Because its distance is known, and when we met it, we were exactly 4650\r\nmiles from the surface of the terrestrial globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than 2000 French leagues,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan. \"That beats the\r\nexpress trains of the pitiful globe called the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" replied Nicholl, consulting his chronometer; \"it\r\nis eleven o'clock, and it is only thirteen minutes since we left the\r\nAmerican Continent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only thirteen minutes?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nicholl; \"and if our initiatory speed of 12,000 yards has\r\nbeen kept up, we shall have made about 20,000 miles in the hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all very well, my friends,\" said the president, \"but the\r\ninsoluble question still remains. Why did we not hear the detonation of\r\nthe Columbiad?\"\r\n\r\nFor want of an answer the conversation dropped, and Barbicane began\r\nthoughtfully to let down the shutter of the second side. He succeeded;\r\nand through the uncovered glass the moon filled the projectile with\r\na brilliant light. Nicholl, as an economical man, put out the gas,\r\nnow useless, and whose brilliancy prevented any observation of the\r\ninterplanetary space.\r\n\r\nThe lunar disc shone with wonderful purity. Her rays, no longer filtered\r\nthrough the vapoury atmosphere of the terrestrial globe, shone through\r\nthe glass, filling the air in the interior of the projectile with silvery\r\nreflections. The black curtain of the firmament in reality heightened the\r\nmoon's brilliancy, which in this void of ether unfavourable to diffusion\r\ndid not eclipse the neighbouring stars. The heavens, thus seen, presented\r\nquite a new aspect, and one which the human eye could never dream of.\r\nOne may conceive the interest with which these bold men watched the orb\r\nof night, the great aim of their journey.\r\n\r\nIn its motion the earth's satellite was insensibly nearing the zenith,\r\nthe mathematical point which it ought to attain ninety-six hours later.\r\nHer mountains, her plains, every projection was as clearly discernible\r\nto their eyes as if they were observing it from some spot upon the earth;\r\nbut its light was developed through space with wonderful intensity. The\r\ndisc shone like a platinum mirror. Of the earth flying from under their\r\nfeet, the travellers had lost all recollection.\r\n\r\nIt was Captain Nicholl who first recalled their attention to the vanishing\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Michel Ardan, \"do not let us be ungrateful to it. Since we\r\nare leaving our country, let our last looks be directed to it. I wish to\r\nsee the earth once more before it is quite hidden from my eyes.\"\r\n\r\nTo satisfy his companions, Barbicane began to uncover the window at the\r\nbottom of the projectile, which would allow them to observe the earth\r\ndirect. The disc, which the force of the projection had beaten down to\r\nthe base, was removed, not without difficulty. Its fragments, placed\r\ncarefully against the wall, might serve again upon occasion. Then a\r\ncircular gap appeared, nineteen inches in diameter, hollowed out of\r\nthe lower part of the projectile. A glass cover, six inches thick and\r\nstrengthened with upper fastenings, closed it tightly. Beneath was fixed\r\nan aluminium plate, held in place by bolts. The screws being undone,\r\nand the bolts let go, the plate fell down, and visible communication was\r\nestablished between the interior and the exterior.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan knelt by the glass. It was cloudy, seemingly opaque.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" he exclaimed, \"and the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"The earth?\" said Barbicane. \"There it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! that little thread; that silver crescent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless, Michel. In four days, when the moon will be full, at the\r\nvery time we shall reach it, the earth will be new, and will only appear\r\nto us as a slender crescent which will soon disappear, and for some days\r\nwill be enveloped in utter darkness.\"\r\n\r\n\"That the earth?\" repeated Michel Ardan, looking with all his eyes at\r\nthe thin slip of his native planet.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given by President Barbicane was correct. The earth,\r\nwith respect to the projectile, was entering its last phase. It was in\r\nits octant, and showed a crescent finely traced on the dark background\r\nof the sky. Its light, rendered bluish by the thick strata of the\r\natmosphere was less intense than that of the crescent moon, but it was\r\nof considerable dimensions, and looked like an enormous arch stretched\r\nacross the firmament. Some parts brilliantly lighted, especially on its\r\nconcave part, showed the presence of high mountains, often disappearing\r\nbehind thick spots, which are never seen on the lunar disc. They were\r\nrings of clouds placed concentrically round the terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\nWhilst the travellers were trying to pierce the profound darkness, a\r\nbrilliant cluster of shooting stars burst upon their eyes. Hundreds of\r\nmeteorites, ignited by the friction of the atmosphere, irradiated the\r\nshadow of the luminous train, and lined the cloudy parts of the disc\r\nwith their fire. At this period the earth was in its perihelium, and\r\nthe month of December is so propitious to these shooting stars, that\r\nastronomers have counted as many as twenty-four thousand in an hour. But\r\nMichel Ardan, disdaining scientific reasonings, preferred thinking that\r\nthe earth was thus saluting the departure of her three children with her\r\nmost brilliant fireworks.\r\n\r\nIndeed this was all they saw of the globe lost in the shadow, an inferior\r\norb of the solar world, rising and setting to the great planets like a\r\nsimple morning or evening star! This globe, where they had left all their\r\naffections, was nothing more than a fugitive crescent!\r\n\r\nLong did the three friends look without speaking, though united in heart,\r\nwhilst the projectile sped onward with an ever-decreasing speed. Then\r\nan irresistible drowsiness crept over their brain. Was it weariness both\r\nof body and mind? No doubt; for after the over-excitement of those last\r\nhours passed upon earth, reaction was inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Nicholl, \"since we must sleep, let us sleep.\"\r\n\r\nAnd stretching themselves on their couches, they were all three soon in\r\na profound slumber.\r\n\r\nBut they had not forgotten themselves more than a quarter of an hour,\r\nwhen Barbicane sat up suddenly, and rousing his companions with a loud\r\nvoice, exclaimed,—\r\n\r\n\"I have found it!\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you found?\" asked Michel Ardan, jumping from his bed.\r\n\r\n\"The reason why we did not hear the detonation of the Columbiad.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is—?\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Because our projectile travelled _faster than the sound!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n   THEIR PLACE OF SHELTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis curious but certainly correct explanation once given, the three\r\nfriends returned to their slumbers. Could they have found a calmer or\r\nmore peaceful spot to sleep in? On the earth, houses, towns, cottages,\r\nand country feel every shock given to the exterior of the globe. On sea,\r\nthe vessels rocked by the waves are still in motion; in the air, the\r\nballoon oscillates incessantly on the fluid strata of divers densities.\r\nThis projectile alone, floating in perfect space, in the midst of perfect\r\nsilence, offered perfect repose.\r\n\r\nThus the sleep of our adventurous travellers might have been indefinitely\r\nprolonged, if an unexpected noise had not awakened them at about seven\r\no'clock in the morning of the 2nd of December, eight hours after their\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThis noise was a very natural barking.\r\n\r\n\"The dogs! it is the dogs!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, rising at once.\r\n\r\n\"They are hungry,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" replied Michel, \"we have forgotten them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThey looked and found one of the animals crouched under the divan.\r\nTerrified and shaken by the initiatory shock, it had remained in the\r\ncorner till its voice returned with the pangs of hunger. It was the\r\namiable Diana, still very confused, who crept out of her retreat, though\r\nnot without much persuasion, Michel Ardan encouraging her with most\r\ngracious words.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Diana,\" said he; \"come, my girl! thou whose destiny will be\r\nmarked in the cynegetic annals; thou whom the pagans would have given as\r\ncompanion to the god Anubis, and Christians as friend to St. Roch; thou\r\nwho art rushing into interplanetary space, and wilt perhaps be the Eve\r\nof all Selenite dogs! come, Diana, come here.\"\r\n\r\nDiana, flattered or not, advanced by degrees, uttering plaintive cries.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Barbicane; \"I see Eve, but where is Adam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Adam?\" replied Michel; \"Adam cannot be far off; he is there somewhere;\r\nwe must call him. Satellite! here, Satellite!\"\r\n\r\nBut Satellite did not appear. Diana would not leave off howling. They\r\nfound, however, that she was not bruised, and they gave her a pie, which\r\nsilenced her complaints. As to Satellite, he seemed quite lost. They had\r\nto hunt a long time before finding him in one of the upper compartments\r\nof the projectile, whither some unaccountable shock must have violently\r\nhurled him. The poor beast, much hurt, was in a piteous state.\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" said Michel.\r\n\r\nThey brought the unfortunate dog down with great care. Its skull had been\r\nbroken against the roof, and it seemed unlikely that he could recover\r\nfrom such a shock. Meanwhile, he was stretched comfortably on a cushion.\r\nOnce there, he heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"We will take care of you,\" said Michel; \"we are responsible for your\r\nexistence. I would rather lose an arm than a paw of my poor Satellite.\"\r\n\r\nSaying which, he offered some water to the wounded dog, who swallowed it\r\nwith avidity.\r\n\r\nThis attention paid, the travellers watched the earth and the moon\r\nattentively. The earth was now only discernible by a cloudy disc ending\r\nin a crescent, rather more contracted than that of the previous evening;\r\nbut its expanse was still enormous, compared with that of the moon, which\r\nwas approaching nearer and nearer to a perfect circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THEY GAVE HER A PIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" said Michel Ardan, \"I am really sorry that we did not start\r\nwhen the earth was full, that is to say, when our globe was in opposition\r\nto the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Because we should have seen our continents and seas in a new light,—the\r\nfirst resplendent under the solar rays, the latter cloudy as represented\r\non some maps of the world. I should like to have seen those poles of the\r\nearth on which the eye of man has never yet rested.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say,\" replied Barbicane; \"but if the earth had been _full_, the\r\nmoon would have been _new_; that is to say, invisible, because of the\r\nrays of the sun. It is better for us to see the destination we wish to\r\nreach, than the point of departure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Barbicane,\" replied Captain Nicholl; \"and, besides, when\r\nwe have reached the moon, we shall have time during the long lunar nights\r\nto consider at our leisure the globe on which our likenesses swarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our likenesses!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan; \"they are no more our likenesses\r\nthan the Selenites are! We inhabit a new world, peopled by ourselves—the\r\nprojectile! I am Barbicane's likeness, and Barbicane is Nicholl's. Beyond\r\nus, around us, human nature is at an end, and we are the only population\r\nof this microcosm until we become pure Selenites.\"\r\n\r\n\"In about eighty-eight hours,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Which means to say?\" asked Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"That it is half-past eight,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" retorted Michel; \"then it is impossible for me to find even\r\nthe shadow of a reason why we should not go to breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed the inhabitants of the new star could not live without eating, and\r\ntheir stomachs were suffering from the imperious laws of hunger. Michel\r\nArdan, as a Frenchman, was declared chief cook, an important function,\r\nwhich raised no rival. The gas gave sufficient heat for the culinary\r\napparatus, and the provision-box furnished the elements of this first\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast began with three bowls of excellent soup, thanks to the\r\nliquefaction in hot water of those precious cakes of Liebig, prepared from\r\nthe best parts of the ruminants of the Pampas. To the soup succeeded some\r\nbeefsteaks, compressed by an hydraulic press, as tender and succulent as\r\nif brought straight from the kitchen of an English eating-house. Michel,\r\nwho was imaginative, maintained that they were even \"red.\"\r\n\r\nPreserved vegetables (\"fresher than nature,\" said the amiable Michel)\r\nsucceeded the dish of meat; and was followed by some cups of tea with\r\nbread and butter, after the American fashion.\r\n\r\nThe beverage was declared exquisite, and was due to the infusion of the\r\nchoicest leaves, of which the Emperor of Russia had given some chests\r\nfor the benefit of the travellers.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, to crown the repast, Ardan brought out a fine bottle of Nuits,\r\nwhich was found \"by chance\" in the provision-box. The three friends drank\r\nto the union of the earth and her satellite.\r\n\r\nAnd, as if he had not already done enough for the generous wine which\r\nhe had distilled on the slopes of Burgundy, the sun chose to be of the\r\nparty. At this moment the projectile emerged from the conical shadow\r\ncast by the terrestrial globe, and the rays of the radiant orb struck\r\nthe lower disc of the projectile direct occasioned by the angle which\r\nthe moon's orbit makes with that of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The sun!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" replied Barbicane; \"I expected it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Michel, \"the conical shadow which the earth leaves in space\r\nextends beyond the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Far beyond it, if the atmospheric refraction is not taken into\r\nconsideration,\" said Barbicane. \"But when the moon is enveloped in this\r\nshadow, it is because the centres of the three stars, the sun, the earth,\r\nand the moon, are all in one and the same straight line. Then the _nodes_\r\ncoincide with the _phases_ of the moon, and there is an eclipse. If we\r\nhad started when there was an eclipse of the moon, all our passage would\r\nhave been in the shadow, which would have been a pity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE SUN CHOSE TO BE OF THE PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, though we are floating in space, our projectile, bathed in the\r\nsolar rays, will receive their light and heat. It economizes the gas,\r\nwhich is in every respect a good economy.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, under these rays which no atmosphere can temper, either in\r\ntemperature or brilliancy, the projectile grew warm and bright, as if\r\nit had passed suddenly from winter to summer. The moon above, the sun\r\nbeneath, were inundating it with their fire.\r\n\r\n\"It is pleasant here,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" said Michel Ardan. \"With a little earth spread on\r\nour aluminium planet we should have green peas in twenty-four hours. I\r\nhave but one fear, which is that the walls of the projectile might melt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, my worthy friend,\" replied Barbicane; \"the projectile\r\nwithstood a very much higher temperature than this as it slid through\r\nthe strata of the atmosphere. I should not be surprised if it did not\r\nlook like a meteor on fire to the eyes of the spectators in Florida.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then Joseph T. Maston will think we are roasted!\"\r\n\r\n\"What astonishes me,\" said Barbicane, \"is that we have not been. That\r\nwas a danger we had not provided for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feared it,\" said Nicholl simply.\r\n\r\n\"And you never mentioned it, my sublime captain,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan,\r\nclasping his friend's hand.\r\n\r\nBarbicane now began to settle himself in the projectile as if he was\r\nnever to leave it. One must remember that this aerial car had a base\r\nwith a superficies of fifty-four square feet. Its height to the roof\r\nwas twelve feet. Carefully laid out in the inside, and little encumbered\r\nby instruments and travelling utensils which each had their particular\r\nplace, it left the three travellers a certain freedom of movement. The\r\nthick window inserted in the bottom could bear any amount of weight, and\r\nBarbicane and his companions walked upon it as if it were solid plank;\r\nbut the sun striking it directly with its rays lit the interior of the\r\nprojectile from beneath, thus producing singular effects of light.\r\n\r\nThey began by investigating the state of their store of water and\r\nprovisions, neither of which had suffered, thanks to the care taken to\r\ndeaden the shock. Their provisions were abundant, and plentiful enough\r\nto last the three travellers for more than a year. Barbicane wished to\r\nbe cautious, in case the projectile should land on a part of the moon\r\nwhich was utterly barren. As to water and the reserve of brandy, which\r\nconsisted of fifty gallons, there was only enough for two months; but\r\naccording to the last observations of astronomers, the moon had a low,\r\ndense, and thick atmosphere, at least in the deep valleys, and there\r\nsprings and streams could not fail. Thus, during their passage, and\r\nfor the first year of their settlement on the lunar continent, these\r\nadventurous explorers would suffer neither hunger nor thirst.\r\n\r\nNow about the air in the projectile. There, too, they were secure.\r\nReiset and Regnaut's apparatus, intended for the production of oxygen,\r\nwas supplied with chlorate of potassium for two months. They necessarily\r\nconsumed a certain quantity of gas, for they were obliged to keep the\r\nproducing substance at a temperature of above 400°. But there again they\r\nwere all safe. The apparatus only wanted a little care. But it was not\r\nenough to renew the oxygen; they must absorb the carbonic acid produced by\r\nexpiration. During the last twelve hours the atmosphere of the projectile\r\nhad become charged with this deleterious gas. Nicholl discovered the\r\nstate of the air by observing Diana panting painfully. The carbonic\r\nacid, by a phenomenon similar to that produced in the famous Grotto del\r\nCane, had collected at the bottom of the projectile owing to its weight.\r\nPoor Diana, with her head low, would suffer before her masters from the\r\npresence of this gas. But Captain Nicholl hastened to remedy this state\r\nof things, by placing on the floor several receivers containing caustic\r\npotash which he shook about for a time, and this substance, greedy of\r\ncarbonic acid, soon completely absorbed it, thus purifying the air.\r\n\r\nAn inventory of instruments was then begun. The thermometers and\r\nbarometers had resisted, all but one minimum thermometer, the glass of\r\nwhich was broken. An excellent aneroid was drawn from the wadded box\r\nwhich contained it and hung on the wall. Of course it was only affected\r\nby and marked the pressure of the air inside the projectile, but it also\r\nshowed the quantity of moisture which it contained. At that moment its\r\nneedle oscillated between 25.24 and 25.08.\r\n\r\nIt was fine weather.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had also brought several compasses, which he found intact.\r\nOne must understand that under present conditions their needles were\r\nacting _wildly_, that is without any _constant_ direction. Indeed, at\r\nthe distance they were from the earth, the magnetic pole could have no\r\nperceptible action upon the apparatus; but the box placed on the lunar\r\ndisc might perhaps exhibit some strange phenomena. In any case it would\r\nbe interesting to see whether the earth's satellite submitted like\r\nherself to its magnetic influence.\r\n\r\nA hypsometer to measure the height of the lunar mountains, a sextant\r\nto take the height of the sun, glasses which would be useful as they\r\nneared the moon, all these instruments were carefully looked over, and\r\npronounced good in spite of the violent shock.\r\n\r\nAs to the pickaxes and different tools which were Nicholl's especial\r\nchoice; as to the sacks of different kinds of grain and shrubs which\r\nMichel Ardan hoped to transplant into Selenite ground, they were stowed\r\naway in the upper part of the projectile. There was a sort of granary\r\nthere, loaded with things which the extravagant Frenchman had heaped up.\r\nWhat they were no one knew, and the good-tempered fellow did not explain.\r\nNow and then he climbed up by cramp-irons riveted to the walls, but kept\r\nthe inspection to himself. He arranged and rearranged, he plunged his\r\nhand rapidly into certain mysterious boxes, singing in one of the falsest\r\nof voices an old French refrain to enliven the situation.\r\n\r\nBarbicane observed with some interest that his guns and other arms had\r\nnot been damaged. These were important, because, heavily loaded, they\r\nwere to help to lessen the fall of the projectile, when drawn by the\r\nlunar attraction (after having passed the point of neutral attraction) on\r\nto the moon's surface; a fall which ought to be six times less rapid than\r\nit would have been on the earth's surface, thanks to the difference of\r\nbulk. The inspection ended with general satisfaction, when each returned\r\nto watch space through the side windows and the lower glass\r\ncoverlid.\r\n\r\nThere was the same view. The whole extent of the celestial sphere swarmed\r\nwith stars and constellations of wonderful purity, enough to drive an\r\nastronomer out of his mind! On one side the sun, like the mouth of a\r\nlighted oven, a dazzling disc without a halo, standing out on the dark\r\nbackground of the sky! On the other, the moon returning its fire by\r\nreflection, and apparently motionless in the midst of the starry world.\r\nThen, a large spot seemingly nailed to the firmament, bordered by a\r\nsilvery cord: it was the earth! Here and there nebulous masses like large\r\nflakes of starry snow; and from the zenith to the nadir, an immense ring\r\nformed by an impalpable dust of stars, the \"Milky Way,\" in the midst of\r\nwhich the sun ranks only as a star of the fourth magnitude. The observers\r\ncould not take their eyes from this novel spectacle, of which no\r\ndescription could give an adequate idea. What reflections it suggested!\r\nWhat emotions hitherto unknown awoke in their souls! Barbicane wished\r\nto begin the relation of his journey while under its first impressions,\r\nand hour after hour took notes of all facts happening in the beginning\r\nof the enterprise. He wrote quietly, with his large square writing, in\r\na businesslike style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: ARDAN PLUNGED HIS HAND RAPIDLY INTO CERTAIN\r\n   MYSTERIOUS BOXES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this time Nicholl, the calculator, looked over the minutes of\r\ntheir passage, and worked out figures with unparalleled dexterity. Michel\r\nArdan chatted first with Barbicane, who did not answer him, and then\r\nwith Nicholl, who did not hear him, with Diana, who understood none of\r\nhis theories, and lastly with himself, questioning and answering, going\r\nand coming, busy with a thousand details; at one time bent over the\r\nlower glass, at another roosting in the heights of the projectile, and\r\nalways singing. In this microcosm he represented French loquacity and\r\nexcitability, and we beg you to believe that they were well represented.\r\nThe day, or rather (for the expression is not correct) the lapse of\r\ntwelve hours, which forms a day upon earth, closed with a plentiful\r\nsupper carefully prepared. No accident of any nature had yet happened\r\nto shake the travellers' confidence; so, full of hope, already sure of\r\nsuccess, they slept peacefully, whilst the projectile under an uniformly\r\ndecreasing speed was crossing the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n   A LITTLE ALGEBRA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night passed without incident. The word \"night,\" however, is scarcely\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nThe position of the projectile with regard to the sun did not change.\r\nAstronomically, it was daylight on the lower part, and night on the upper;\r\nso when during this narrative these words are used, they represent the\r\nlapse of time between the rising and setting of the sun upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThe travellers' sleep was rendered more peaceful by the projectile's\r\nexcessive speed, for it seemed absolutely motionless. Not a motion\r\nbetrayed its onward course through space. The rate of progress, however\r\nrapid it might be, cannot produce any sensible effect on the human frame\r\nwhen it takes place in a vacuum, or when the mass of air circulates\r\nwith the body which is carried with it. What inhabitant of the earth\r\nperceives its speed, which, however, is at the rate of 68,000 miles per\r\nhour? Motion under such conditions is \"felt\" no more than repose; and\r\nwhen a body is in repose it will remain so as long as no strange force\r\ndisplaces it; if moving, it will not stop unless an obstacle comes in\r\nits way. This indifference to motion or repose is called inertia.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his companions might have believed themselves perfectly\r\nstationary, being shut up in the projectile; indeed, the effect would\r\nhave been the same if they had been on the outside of it. Had it not been\r\nfor the moon, which was increasing above them, they might have sworn that\r\nthey were floating in complete stagnation.\r\n\r\nThat morning, the 3rd of December, the travellers were awakened by a\r\njoyous but unexpected noise; it was the crowing of a cock which sounded\r\nthrough the car. Michel Ardan, who was the first on his feet, climbed\r\nto the top of the projectile, and shutting a box, the lid of which\r\nwas partly open, said in a low voice, \"Will you hold your tongue? That\r\ncreature will spoil my design!\"\r\n\r\nBut Nicholl and Barbicane were awake.\r\n\r\n\"A cock!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Why no, my friends,\" Michel answered quickly; \"it was I who wished to\r\nawake you by this rural sound.\" So saying, he gave vent to a splendid\r\ncock-a-doodledoo, which would have done honour to the proudest of\r\npoultry-yards.\r\n\r\nThe two Americans could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Fine talent that,\" said Nicholl, looking suspiciously at his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Michel; \"a joke in my country. It is very Gallic; they play\r\nthe cock so in the best society.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning the conversation,—\r\n\r\n\"Barbicane, do you know what I have been thinking of all night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the president.\r\n\r\n\"Of our Cambridge friends. You have already remarked that I am an\r\nignoramus in mathematical subjects; and it is impossible for me to\r\nfind out how the savants of the Observatory were able to calculate what\r\ninitiatory speed the projectile ought to have on leaving the Columbiad\r\nin order to attain the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say,\" replied Barbicane, \"to attain that neutral point where\r\nthe terrestrial and lunar attractions are equal; for, starting from that\r\npoint, situated about nine-tenths of the distance travelled over, the\r\nprojectile would simply fall upon the moon, on account of its weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Michel; \"but, once more; how could they calculate the\r\ninitiatory speed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can be easier,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"And you knew how to make that calculation?\" asked Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. Nicholl and I would have made it, if the Observatory had not\r\nsaved us the trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, old Barbicane,\" replied Michel; \"they might have cut off my\r\nhead, beginning at my feet, before they could have made me solve that\r\nproblem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you do not know algebra,\" answered Barbicane quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, there you are, you eaters of _x_¹; you think you have said all when\r\nyou have said 'Algebra.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Michel,\" said Barbicane, \"can you use a forge without a hammer, or\r\nplough without a ploughshare?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, algebra is a tool, like the plough or the hammer, and a good tool\r\nto those who know how to use it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seriously?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite seriously.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can you use that tool in my presence?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it will interest you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And show me how they calculated the initiatory speed of our car?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my worthy friend; taking into consideration all the elements of\r\nthe problem, the distance from the centre of the earth to the centre of\r\nthe moon, of the radius of the earth, of its bulk, and of the bulk of\r\nthe moon, I can tell exactly what ought to be the initiatory speed of\r\nthe projectile, and that by a simple formula.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see it; only I shall not give you the real course drawn\r\nby the projectile between the moon and the earth in considering their\r\nmotion round the sun. No, I shall consider these two orbs as perfectly\r\nmotionless, which will answer all our purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it will be trying to solve the problem called 'the problem of\r\nthe three bodies,' for which the integral calculus is not yet far enough\r\nadvanced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Michel Ardan, in his sly tone, \"mathematics have not said\r\ntheir last word?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps the Selenites have carried the integral calculus farther\r\nthan you have; and, by the bye, what is 'integral calculus?'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a calculation the converse of the differential,\" replied Barbicane\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\"Much obliged; it is all very clear, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" continued Barbicane, \"a slip of paper and a bit of pencil,\r\nand before a half-hour is over I will have found the required formula.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour had not elapsed before Barbicane, raising his head, showed\r\nMichel Ardan a page covered with algebraical signs, in which the general\r\nformula for the solution was contained.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and does Nicholl understand what that means?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Michel,\" replied the captain. \"All these signs, which seem\r\ncabalistic to you, form the plainest, the clearest, and the most logical\r\nlanguage to those who know how to read it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you pretend, Nicholl,\" asked Michel, \"that by means of these\r\nhieroglyphics, more incomprehensible than the Egyptian Ibis, you can find\r\nwhat initiatory speed it was necessary to give to the projectile?\"\r\n\r\n\"Incontestably,\" replied Nicholl; \"and even by this same formula I can\r\nalways tell you its speed at any point of its transit.\"\r\n\r\n\"On your word?\"\r\n\r\n\"On my word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are as cunning as our president.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Michel; the difficult part is what Barbicane has done; that is, to\r\nget an equation which shall satisfy all the conditions of the problem.\r\nThe remainder is only a question of arithmetic, requiring merely the\r\nknowledge of the four rules.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is something!\" replied Michel Ardan, who for his life could not\r\ndo addition right, and who defined the rule as a Chinese puzzle, which\r\nallowed one to obtain all sorts of totals.\r\n\r\n\"The expression _v_ zero, which you see in that equation, is the speed\r\nwhich the projectile will have on leaving the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl; \"it is from that point that we must calculate\r\nthe velocity, since we know already that the velocity at departure was\r\nexactly one and a half times more than on leaving the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand no more,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very simple calculation,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Not as simple as I am,\" retorted Michel.\r\n\r\n\"That means, that when our projectile reached the limits of the terrestrial\r\natmosphere it had already lost one-third of its initiatory speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"As much as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friend; merely by friction against the atmospheric strata. You\r\nunderstand that the faster it goes the more resistance it meets with from\r\nthe air.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I admit,\" answered Michel; \"and I understand it, although your x's\r\nand zero's, and algebraic formulæ, are rattling in my head like nails\r\nin a bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"First effects of algebra,\" replied Barbicane; \"and now, to finish, we\r\nare going to prove the given number of these different expressions, that\r\nis, work out their value.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finish me!\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\nBarbicane took the paper, and began again to make his calculations with\r\ngreat rapidity. Nicholl looked over and greedily read the work as it\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n\"That's it! that's it!\" at last he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Is it clear?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"DO I UNDERSTAND IT?\" CRIED ARDAN;\r\n   \"MY HEAD IS SPLITTING WITH IT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is written in letters of fire,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful fellows!\" muttered Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand it at last?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Do I understand it?\" cried Ardan; \"my head is splitting with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Nicholl, \"to find out the speed of the projectile when\r\nit left the atmosphere, we have only to calculate that.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain, as a practical man equal to all difficulties, began to write\r\nwith frightful rapidity. Divisions and multiplications grew under his\r\nfingers; the figures were like hail on the white page. Barbicane watched\r\nhim, whilst Michel Ardan nursed a growing headache with both hands.\r\n\r\n\"Very well?\" asked Barbicane, after some minutes' silence.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" replied Nicholl; \"every calculation made, _v_ zero, that is to\r\nsay, the speed necessary for the projectile on leaving the atmosphere,\r\nto enable it to reach the equal point of attraction, ought to be—\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Twelve thousand yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Barbicane, starting; \"you say—\"\r\n\r\n\"Twelve thousand yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" cried the president, making a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Michel Ardan, much surprised.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter! why, if at this moment our speed had already\r\ndiminished one-third by friction, the initiatory speed ought to have\r\nbeen—\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventeen thousand yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Cambridge Observatory declared that 12,000 yards was enough at\r\nstarting; and our projectile, which only started with that speed—\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it will not be enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not be able to reach the neutral point.\"\r\n\r\n\"The deuce!\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not even get half way.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the projectile!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, jumping as if\r\nit was already on the point of striking the terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\n\"And we shall fall back upon the earth!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n   THE COLD OF SPACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis revelation came like a thunderbolt. Who could have expected such an\r\nerror in calculation? Barbicane would not believe it. Nicholl revised\r\nhis figures: they were exact. As to the formula which had determined\r\nthem, they could not suspect its truth; it was evident that an initiatory\r\nvelocity of 17,000 yards in the first second was necessary to enable them\r\nto reach the neutral point.\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked at each other silently. There was no thought\r\nof breakfast. Barbicane, with clenched teeth, knitted brows, and hands\r\nclasped convulsively, was watching through the window. Nicholl had\r\ncrossed his arms, and was examining his calculations. Michel Ardan was\r\nmuttering,—\r\n\r\n\"That is just like those scientific men: they never do anything else. I\r\nwould give twenty pistoles if we could fall upon the Cambridge Observatory\r\nand crush it, together with the whole lot of dabblers in figures which\r\nit contains.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a thought struck the captain, which he at once communicated to\r\nBarbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he; \"it is seven o'clock in the morning; we have already been\r\ngone thirty-two hours; more than half our passage is over, and we are\r\nnot falling that I am aware of.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane did not answer, but after a rapid glance at the captain,\r\ntook a pair of compasses wherewith to measure the angular distance\r\nof the terrestrial globe; then from the lower window he took an exact\r\nobservation, and noticed that the projectile was apparently stationary.\r\nThen rising and wiping his forehead, on which large drops of perspiration\r\nwere standing, he put some figures on paper. Nicholl understood that the\r\npresident was deducting from the terrestrial diameter the projectile's\r\ndistance from the earth. He watched him anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" exclaimed Barbicane, after some moments, \"no, we are not falling!\r\nno, we are already more than 50,000 leagues from the earth. We have\r\npassed the point at which the projectile would have stopped if its speed\r\nhad only been 12,000 yards at starting. We are still going up.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is evident,\" replied Nicholl; \"and we must conclude that our\r\ninitial speed, under the power of the 400,000 lbs. of gun-cotton, must\r\nhave exceeded the required 12,000 yards. Now I can understand how, after\r\nthirteen minutes only, we met the second satellite, which gravitates\r\nround the earth at more than 2000 leagues' distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this explanation is the more probable,\" added Barbicane, \"because,\r\nin throwing off the water enclosed between its partition-breaks, the\r\nprojectile found itself lightened of a considerable weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my brave Nicholl, we are saved!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well then,\" said Michel Ardan quietly; \"as we are safe, let us have\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\nNicholl was not mistaken. The initial speed had been, very fortunately,\r\nmuch above that estimated by the Cambridge Observatory; but the Cambridge\r\nObservatory had nevertheless made a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe travellers, recovered from this false alarm, breakfasted merrily. If\r\nthey ate a great deal, they talked more. Their confidence was greater\r\nafter than before \"the incident of the algebra.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should we not succeed?\" said Michel Ardan; \"why should we not arrive\r\nsafely? We are launched; we have no obstacle before us, no stones in our\r\nway; the road is open, more so than that of a ship battling with the sea;\r\nmore open than that of a balloon battling with the wind; and if a ship\r\ncan reach its destination, a balloon go where it pleases, why cannot our\r\nprojectile attain its end and aim?\"\r\n\r\n\"It _will_ attain it,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"If only to do honour to the Americans,\" added Michel Ardan, \"the only\r\npeople who could bring such an enterprise to a happy termination, and\r\nthe only one which could produce a President Barbicane. Ah, now we are\r\nno longer uneasy, I begin to think, What will become of us? We shall get\r\nright royally weary.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl made a gesture of denial.\r\n\r\n\"But I have provided for the contingency, my friends,\" replied Michel;\r\n\"you have only to speak, and I have chess, draughts, cards, and dominoes\r\nat your disposal; nothing is wanting but a billiard-table.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Barbicane; \"you brought away such trifles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Michel, \"and not only to distract ourselves, but\r\nalso with the laudable intention of endowing the Selenite smoking divans\r\nwith them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said Barbicane, \"if the moon is inhabited, its inhabitants\r\nmust have appeared some thousands of years before those of the earth, for\r\nwe cannot doubt that their star is much older than ours. If then these\r\nSelenites have existed their hundreds of thousands of years, and if their\r\nbrain is of the same organization as the human brain, they have already\r\ninvented all that we have invented, and even what we may invent in future\r\nages. They have nothing to learn from _us_, and we have everything to\r\nlearn from _them_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Michel; \"you believe that they have artists like Phidias,\r\nMichael Angelo, or Raphael?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poets like Homer, Virgil, Milton, Lamartine, and Hugo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scientific men like Archimedes, Euclid, Pascal, Newton?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could swear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comic writers like Arnal, and photographers like—like Nadar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, friend Barbicane, if they are as strong as we are, and even\r\nstronger—these Selenites—why have they not tried to communicate\r\nwith the earth? why have they not launched a lunar projectile to our\r\nterrestrial regions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you that they have never done so?\" said Barbicane seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" added Nicholl, \"it would be easier for them than for us, for\r\ntwo reasons; first, because the attraction on the moon's surface is six\r\ntimes less than on that of the earth, which would allow a projectile to\r\nrise more easily; secondly, because it would be enough to send such a\r\nprojectile only at 8000 leagues instead of 80,000, which would require\r\nthe force of projection to be ten times less strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Michel, \"I repeat it, why have they not done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"And I repeat,\" said Barbicane; \"who told you that they have not done\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thousands of years before man appeared on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the projectile—where is the projectile? I demand to see the\r\nprojectile.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" replied Barbicane, \"the sea covers five-sixths of our globe.\r\nFrom that we may draw five good reasons for supposing that the lunar\r\nprojectile, if ever launched, is now at the bottom of the Atlantic or\r\nthe Pacific, unless it sped into some crevasse at that period when the\r\ncrust of the earth was not yet hardened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Barbicane,\" said Michel, \"you have an answer for everything, and I\r\nbow before your wisdom. But there is one hypothesis that would suit me\r\nbetter than all the others, which is, that the Selenites, being older\r\nthan we, are wiser, and have not invented _gunpowder_.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Diana joined in the conversation by a sonorous barking.\r\nShe was asking for her breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Michel Ardan, \"in our discussion we have forgotten Diana and\r\nSatellite.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately a good-sized pie was given to the dog, which devoured it\r\nhungrily.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see, Barbicane,\" said Michel, \"we should have made a second\r\nNoah's Ark of this projectile, and borne with us to the moon a couple of\r\nevery kind of domestic animal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say; but room would have failed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Michel, \"we might have squeezed a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" replied Nicholl, \"that cows, bulls, and horses, and all\r\nruminants, would have been very useful on the lunar continent, but\r\nunfortunately the car could neither have been made a stable nor a shed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we might at least have brought a donkey, only a little donkey;\r\nthat courageous beast which old Silenus loved to mount. I love those old\r\ndonkeys; they are the least favoured animals in creation; they are not\r\nonly beaten while alive, but even after they are dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you make that out?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Michel, \"they make their skins into drums.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing at this ridiculous remark.\r\nBut a cry from their merry companion stopped them. The latter was leaning\r\nover the spot where Satellite lay. He rose, saying,—\r\n\r\n\"My good Satellite is no longer ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Michel, \"he is dead! There,\" added he, in a piteous tone,\r\n\"that is embarrassing. I much fear, my poor Diana, that you will leave\r\nno progeny in the lunar regions!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed the unfortunate Satellite had not survived its wound.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dead. Michel Ardan looked at his friends with a rueful\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"One question presents itself,\" said Barbicane. \"We cannot keep the dead\r\nbody of this dog with us for the next forty-eight hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! certainly not,\" replied Nicholl; \"but our scuttles are fixed on\r\nhinges; they can be let down. We will open one, and throw the body out\r\ninto space.\"\r\n\r\nThe president thought for some moments, and then said,—\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we must do so, but at the same time taking very great precautions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"For two reasons which you will understand,\" answered Barbicane. \"The\r\nfirst relates to the air shut up in the projectile, and of which we must\r\nlose as little as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we manufacture the air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only in part. We make only the oxygen, my worthy Michel; and with\r\nregard to that, we must watch that the apparatus does not furnish the\r\noxygen in too great a quantity; for an excess would bring us very serious\r\nphysiological troubles. But if we make the oxygen, we do not make the\r\nazote, that medium which the lungs do not absorb, and which ought to\r\nremain intact; and that azote will escape rapidly through the open\r\nscuttles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the time for throwing out poor Satellite?\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Agreed; but we must act quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the second reason?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"The second reason is that we must not let the outer cold, which is\r\nexcessive, penetrate the projectile or we shall be frozen to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the sun?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun warms our projectile, which absorbs its rays; but it does not\r\nwarm the vacuum in which we are floating at this moment. Where there is\r\nno air, there is no more heat than diffused light; and the same with\r\ndarkness: it is cold where the sun's rays do not strike direct. This\r\ntemperature is only the temperature produced by the radiation of the\r\nstars; that is to say, what the terrestrial globe would undergo if the\r\nsun disappeared one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is not to be feared,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows?\" said Michel Ardan. \"But, in admitting that the sun does not\r\ngo out, might it not happen that the earth might move away from it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Barbicane, \"there is Michel with his ideas.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" continued Michel, \"do we not know that in 1861 the earth passed\r\nthrough the tail of a comet? Or let us suppose a comet whose power of\r\nattraction is greater than that of the sun. The terrestrial orbit will\r\nbend towards the wandering star, and the earth, becoming its satellite,\r\nwill be drawn such a distance that the rays of the sun will have no\r\naction on its surface.\"\r\n\r\n\"That _might_ happen, indeed,\" replied Barbicane, \"but the consequences\r\nof such a displacement need not be so formidable as you suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the heat and the cold would be equalized on our globe. It has\r\nbeen calculated that, had our earth been carried along in its course by\r\nthe comet of 1861, at its perihelion, that is, its nearest approach to\r\nthe sun, it would have undergone a heat 28,000 times greater than that\r\nof summer. But this heat, which is sufficient to evaporate the waters,\r\nwould have formed a thick ring of cloud, which would have modified that\r\nexcessive temperature; hence the compensation between the cold of the\r\naphelion and the heat of the perihelion.\"\r\n\r\n\"At how many degrees,\" asked Nicholl, \"is the temperature of the planetary\r\nspaces estimated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Formerly,\" replied Barbicane, \"it was greatly exaggerated; but now,\r\nafter the calculations of Fourier, of the French Academy of Science, it\r\nis not supposed to exceed 60° Centigrade below zero.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" said Michel, \"that's nothing!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very much,\" replied Barbicane; \"the temperature which was observed\r\nin the polar regions, at Melville Island and Fort Reliance, that is 76°\r\nFahrenheit below zero.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I mistake not,\" said Nicholl, \"M. Pouillet, another savant, estimates\r\nthe temperature of space at 250° Fahrenheit below zero. We shall,\r\nhowever, be able to verify these calculations for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at present; because the solar rays, beating directly upon our\r\nthermometer, would give, on the contrary, a very high temperature. But,\r\nwhen we arrive in the moon, during its fifteen days of night at either\r\nface, we shall have leisure to make the experiment, for our satellite\r\nlies in a vacuum.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by a _vacuum?_\" asked Michel. \"Is it perfectly such?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is absolutely void of air.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is the air replaced by nothing whatever?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the ether only,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"And pray what is the ether?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ether, my friend, is an agglomeration of imponderable atoms, which,\r\nrelatively to their dimensions, are as far removed from each other as\r\nthe celestial bodies are in space. It is these atoms which, by their\r\nvibratory motion, produce both light and heat in the universe.\"\r\n\r\nThey now proceeded to the burial of Satellite. They had merely to drop\r\nhim into space, in the same way that sailors drop a body into the sea;\r\nbut, as President Barbicane suggested, they must act quickly, so as to\r\nlose as little as possible of that air whose elasticity would rapidly\r\nhave spread it into space. The bolts of the right scuttle, the opening\r\nof which measured about twelve inches across, were carefully drawn,\r\nwhilst Michel, quite grieved, prepared to launch his dog into space.\r\nThe glass, raised by a powerful lever, which enabled it to overcome the\r\npressure of the inside air on the walls of the projectile, turned rapidly\r\non its hinges, and Satellite was thrown out. Scarcely a particle of air\r\ncould have escaped, and the operation was so successful, that later on\r\nBarbicane did not fear to dispose of the rubbish which encumbered the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: SATELLITE WAS THROWN OUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n   QUESTION AND ANSWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of December, when the travellers awoke after fifty-four\r\nhours' journey, the chronometer marked five o'clock of the terrestrial\r\nmorning. In time it was just over five hours and forty minutes, half of\r\nthat assigned to their sojourn in the projectile; but they had already\r\naccomplished nearly seven-tenths of the way. This peculiarity was due to\r\ntheir regularly decreasing speed.\r\n\r\nNow when they observed the earth through the lower window, it looked\r\nlike nothing more than a dark spot, drowned in the solar rays. No more\r\ncrescent, no more cloudy light! The next day, at midnight, the earth\r\nwould be _new_, at the very moment when the moon would be full. Above,\r\nthe orb of night was nearing the line followed by the projectile, so\r\nas to meet it at the given hour. All around the black vault was studded\r\nwith brilliant points, which seemed to move slowly; but, at the great\r\ndistance they were from them, their relative size did not seem to change.\r\nThe sun and stars appeared exactly as they do to us upon earth. As to\r\nthe moon, she was considerably larger; but the travellers' glasses, not\r\nvery powerful, did not allow them as yet to make any useful observations\r\nupon her surface, or reconnoitre her topographically or\r\ngeologically.\r\n\r\nThus the time passed in never-ending conversations all about the\r\nmoon. Each one brought forward his own contingent of particular facts;\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl always serious, Michel Ardan always enthusiastic.\r\nThe projectile, its situation, its direction, incidents which might\r\nhappen, the precautions necessitated by their fall on to the moon, were\r\ninexhaustible matters of conjecture.\r\n\r\nAs they were breakfasting, a question of Michel's, relating to the\r\nprojectile, provoked rather a curious answer from Barbicane, which is\r\nworth repeating. Michel, supposing it to be roughly stopped, while still\r\nunder its formidable initial speed, wished to know what the consequences\r\nof the stoppage would have been.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Barbicane, \"I do not see how it could have been stopped.\"\r\n\r\n\"But let us suppose so,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"It is an impossible supposition,\" said the practical Barbicane; \"unless\r\nthe impulsive force had failed; but even then its speed would diminish\r\nby degrees, and it would not have stopped suddenly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Admit that it had struck a body in space.\"\r\n\r\n\"What body?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why that enormous meteor which we met.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Nicholl, \"the projectile would have been broken into a\r\nthousand pieces, and we with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than that,\" replied Barbicane; \"we should have been burnt to\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Burnt?\" exclaimed Michel, \"by Jove! I am sorry it did not happen, 'just\r\nto see.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And you would have seen,\" replied Barbicane. \"It is known now that heat\r\nis only a modification of motion. When water is warmed—that is to say,\r\nwhen heat is added to it—its particles are set in motion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Michel, \"that is an ingenious theory!\"\r\n\r\n\"And a true one, my worthy friend; for it explains every phenomenon of\r\ncaloric. Heat is but the motion of atoms, a simple oscillation of the\r\nparticles of a body. When they apply the brake to a train, the train\r\ncomes to a stop; but what becomes of the motion which it had previously\r\npossessed? It is transformed into heat, and the brake becomes hot.\r\nWhy do they grease the axles of the wheels? To prevent their heating,\r\nbecause this heat would be generated by the motion which is thus lost by\r\ntransformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I understand,\" replied Michel, \"perfectly. For example, when I\r\nhave run a long time, when I am swimming, when I am perspiring in large\r\ndrops, why am I obliged to stop? Simply because my motion is changed into\r\nheat.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane could not help smiling at Michel's reply; then, returning to\r\nhis theory, said,—\r\n\r\n\"Thus, in case of a shock, it would have been with our projectile as\r\nwith a ball which falls in a burning state after having struck the metal\r\nplate; it is its motion which is turned into heat. Consequently I affirm\r\nthat, if our projectile had struck the meteor, its speed thus suddenly\r\nchecked would have raised a heat great enough to turn it into vapour\r\ninstantaneously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" asked Nicholl, \"what would happen if the earth's motion were to\r\nstop suddenly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her temperature would be raised to such a pitch,\" said Barbicane, \"that\r\nshe would be at once reduced to vapour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Michel, \"that is a way of ending the earth which will\r\ngreatly simplify things.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if the earth fell upon the sun?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"According to calculation,\" replied Barbicane, \"the fall would develope\r\na heat equal to that produced by 16,000 globes of coal, each equal in\r\nbulk to our terrestrial globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good additional heat for the sun,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"of which the\r\ninhabitants of Uranus or Neptune would doubtless not complain; they must\r\nbe perished with cold on their planets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus, my friends,\" said Barbicane, \"all motion suddenly stopped produces\r\nheat. And this theory allows us to infer that the heat of the solar disc\r\nis fed by a hail of meteors falling incessantly on its surface. They have\r\neven calculated—\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" murmured Michel, \"the figures are coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have even calculated,\" continued the imperturbable Barbicane, \"that\r\nthe shock of each meteor on the sun ought to produce a heat equal to that\r\nof 4000 masses of coal of an equal bulk.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the solar heat?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"It is equal to that produced by the combustion of a stratum of coal\r\nsurrounding the sun to a depth of forty-seven miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that heat—\"\r\n\r\n\"Would be able to boil two billions nine hundred millions of cubic\r\nmyriameters* of water.\"\r\n\r\n  *The myriameter is equal to rather more than 10,936 cubic yards\r\n   English.—(Ed.)\r\n\r\n\"And it does not roast us!\" exclaimed Michel.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Barbicane, \"because the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs\r\nfour-tenths of the solar heat; besides, the quantity of heat intercepted\r\nby the earth is but a billionth part of the entire radiation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that all is for the best,\" said Michel, \"and that this atmosphere\r\nis a useful invention; for it not only allows us to breathe, but it\r\nprevents us from roasting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" said Nicholl, \"unfortunately, it will not be the same in the\r\nmoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Michel, always hopeful. \"If there are inhabitants, they must\r\nbreathe. If there are no longer any, they must have left enough oxygen\r\nfor three people, if only at the bottom of ravines, where its own weight\r\nwill cause it to accumulate, and we will not climb the mountains; that\r\nis all.\" And Michel, rising, went to look at the lunar disc, which shone\r\nwith intolerable brilliancy.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" said he, \"it must be hot up there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Without considering,\" replied Nicholl, \"that the day lasts 360 hours!\"\r\n\r\n\"And to compensate that,\" said Barbicane, \"the nights have the same\r\nlength; and as heat is restored by radiation, their temperature can only\r\nbe that of the planetary space.\"\r\n\r\n\"A pretty country, that!\" exclaimed Michel. \"Never mind! I wish I was\r\nthere! Ah! my dear comrades, it will be rather curious to have the earth\r\nfor our moon, to see it rise on the horizon, to recognize the shape\r\nof its continents, and to say to oneself, 'There is America, there is\r\nEurope;' then to follow it when it is about to lose itself in the sun's\r\nrays! By-the-bye, Barbicane, have the Selenites eclipses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, eclipses of the sun,\" replied Barbicane, \"when the centres of the\r\nthree orbs are on a line, the earth being in the middle. But they are\r\nonly partial, during which the earth, cast like a screen upon the solar\r\ndisc, allows the greater portion to be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why,\" asked Nicholl, \"is there no total eclipse? Does not the cone\r\nof the shadow cast by the earth extend beyond the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if we do not take into consideration the refraction produced by the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere. No, if we take that refraction into consideration.\r\nThus δ be the horizontal parallel, and _p_ the apparent semidiameter—\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Michel. \"Do speak plainly, you man of algebra!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well;\" replied Barbicane, \"in popular language the mean distance\r\nfrom the moon to the earth being sixty terrestrial radii, the length of\r\nthe cone of the shadow, on account of the refraction, is reduced to less\r\nthan forty-two radii. The result is that when there are eclipses, the\r\nmoon finds itself beyond the cone of pure shadow, and that the sun sends\r\nher its rays, not only from its edges, but also from its centre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Michel, in a merry tone, \"why are there eclipses, when there\r\nought not to be any?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply because the solar rays are weakened by this refraction, and\r\nthe atmosphere through which they pass extinguishes the greater part of\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\n\"That reason satisfies me,\" replied Michel. \"Besides we shall see when\r\nwe get there. Now, tell me, Barbicane, do you believe that the moon is\r\nan old comet?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's an idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Michel, with an amiable swagger, \"I have a few ideas of\r\nthat sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that idea does not spring from Michel,\" answered Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I am a plagiarist.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt about it. According to the ancients, the Arcadians pretend\r\nthat their ancestors inhabited the earth before the moon became her\r\nsatellite. Starting from this fact, some scientific men have seen in the\r\nmoon a comet whose orbit will one day bring it so near to the earth that\r\nit will be held there by its attraction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any truth in this hypothesis?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"None whatever,\" said Barbicane, \"and the proof is, that the moon has\r\npreserved no trace of the gaseous envelope which always accompanies\r\ncomets.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued Nicholl, \"before becoming the earth's satellite,\r\ncould not the moon, when in her perihelion, pass so near the sun as by\r\nevaporation to get rid of all those gaseous substances?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible, friend Nicholl, but not probable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because—Faith I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel, \"what hundreds of volumes we might make of all\r\nthat we do not know!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! indeed. What time is it?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Three o'clock,\" answered Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"How time goes,\" said Michel, \"in the conversation of scientific men such\r\nas we are! Certainly, I feel I know too much! I feel that I am becoming\r\na well!\"\r\n\r\nSaying which, Michel hoisted himself to the roof of the projectile, \"to\r\nobserve the moon better,\" he pretended. During this time his companions\r\nwere watching through the lower glass. Nothing new to note!\r\n\r\nWhen Michel Ardan came down, he went to the side scuttle; and suddenly\r\nthey heard an exclamation of surprise!\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThe president approached the window, and saw a sort of flattened sack\r\nfloating some yards from the projectile. This object seemed as motionless\r\nas the projectile, and was consequently animated with the same ascending\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\"What is that machine?\" continued Michel Ardan. \"Is it one of the bodies\r\nof space which our projectile keeps within its attraction, and which will\r\naccompany it to the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"What astonishes me,\" said Nicholl, \"is that the specific weight of the\r\nbody, which is certainly less than that of the projectile, allows it to\r\nkeep so perfectly on a level with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicholl,\" replied Barbicane, after a moment's reflection, \"I do not know\r\nwhat the object is, but I do know why it maintains our level.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we are floating in space, my dear captain, and in space bodies\r\nfall or move (which is the same thing) with equal speed whatever be their\r\nweight or form; it is the air, which by its resistance creates these\r\ndifferences in weight. When you create a vacuum in a tube, the objects\r\nyou send through it, grains of dust or grains of lead, fall with the same\r\nrapidity. Here in space is the same cause and the same effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl, \"and everything we throw out of the projectile\r\nwill accompany it until it reaches the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! fools that we are!\" exclaimed Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Why that expletive?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Because we might have filled the projectile with useful objects, books,\r\ninstruments, tools, &c. We could have thrown them all out, and all would\r\nhave followed in our train. But happy thought! Why cannot we walk outside\r\nlike the meteor? Why cannot we launch into space through the scuttle?\r\nWhat enjoyment it would be to feel oneself thus suspended in ether, more\r\nfavoured than the birds who must use their wings to keep themselves up!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: IT WAS THE BODY OF SATELLITE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Granted,\" said Barbicane, \"but how to breathe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang the air, to fail so inopportunely!\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it did not fail, Michel, your density being less than that of\r\nthe projectile, you would soon be left behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must remain in our car?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter,\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I know, I guess, what this pretended meteor is! It is no asteroid which\r\nis accompanying us! It is not a piece of a planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it then?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"It is our unfortunate dog! It is Diana's husband!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, this deformed, unrecognizable object, reduced to nothing, was\r\nthe body of Satellite, flattened like a bagpipe without wind, and ever\r\nmounting, mounting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n   A MOMENT OF INTOXICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus a phenomenon, curious but explicable, was happening under these\r\nstrange conditions.\r\n\r\nEvery object thrown from the projectile would follow the same course and\r\nnever stop until it did. There was a subject for conversation which the\r\nwhole evening could not exhaust.\r\n\r\nBesides, the excitement of the three travellers increased as they drew\r\nnear the end of their journey. They expected unforeseen incidents, and\r\nnew phenomena; and nothing would have astonished them in the frame of\r\nmind they then were in. Their over-excited imagination went faster than\r\nthe projectile, whose speed was evidently diminishing, though insensibly\r\nto themselves. But the moon grew larger to their eyes, and they fancied\r\nif they stretched out their hands they could seize it.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 5th of November, at five in the morning, all three\r\nwere on foot. That day was to be the last of their journey, if all\r\ncalculations were true. That very night, at twelve o'clock, in eighteen\r\nhours, exactly at the full moon, they would reach its brilliant disc.\r\nThe next midnight would see that journey ended, the most extraordinary\r\nof ancient or modern times. Thus from the first of the morning, through\r\nthe scuttles silvered by its rays, they saluted the orb of night with a\r\nconfident and joyous hurrah.\r\n\r\nThe moon was advancing majestically along the starry firmament. A few\r\nmore degrees, and she would reach the exact point where her meeting with\r\nthe projectile was to take place.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own observations, Barbicane reckoned that they would\r\nland on her northern hemisphere, where stretch immense planes, and where\r\nmountains are rare. A favourable circumstance if, as they thought, the\r\nlunar atmosphere was stored only in its depths.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" observed Michel Ardan, \"a plain is easier to disembark upon\r\nthan a mountain. A Selenite, deposited in Europe on the summit of Mont\r\nBlanc, or in Asia on the top of the Himalayas, would not be quite in the\r\nright place.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" added Captain Nicholl, \"on a flat ground, the projectile will\r\nremain motionless when it has once touched; whereas on a declivity it\r\nwould roll like an avalanche, and not being squirrels we should not come\r\nout safe and sound. So it is all for the best.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the success of the audacious attempt no longer appeared doubtful.\r\nBut Barbicane was preoccupied with one thought; but not wishing to make\r\nhis companions uneasy, he kept silence on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe direction the projectile was taking towards the moon's northern\r\nhemisphere, showed that her course had been slightly altered. The\r\ndischarge, mathematically calculated, would carry the projectile to the\r\nvery centre of the lunar disc. If it did not land there, there must have\r\nbeen some deviation. What had caused it? Barbicane could neither imagine\r\nnor determine the importance of the deviation, for there were no points\r\nto go by.\r\n\r\nHe hoped, however, that it would have no other result than that of\r\nbringing them near the upper border of the moon, a region more suitable\r\nfor landing.\r\n\r\nWithout imparting his uneasiness to his companions, Barbicane contented\r\nhimself with constantly observing the moon, in order to see whether the\r\ncourse of the projectile would not be altered; for the situation would\r\nhave been terrible if it failed in its aim, and being carried beyond\r\nthe disc should be launched into interplanetary space. At that moment,\r\nthe moon, instead of appearing flat like a disc, showed its convexity.\r\nIf the sun's rays had struck it obliquely, the shadow thrown would have\r\nbrought out the high mountains, which would have been clearly detached.\r\nThe eye might have gazed into the crater's gaping abysses, and followed\r\nthe capricious fissures which wound through the immense plains. But all\r\nrelief was as yet levelled in intense brilliancy. They could scarcely\r\ndistinguish those large spots which give to the moon the appearance of\r\na human face.\r\n\r\n\"Face, indeed!\" said Michel Ardan; \"but I am sorry for the amiable sister\r\nof Apollo. A very pitted face!\"\r\n\r\nBut the travellers, now so near the end, were incessantly observing\r\nthis new world. They imagined themselves walking through its unknown\r\ncountries, climbing its highest peaks, descending into its lowest depths.\r\nHere and there they fancied they saw vast seas, scarcely kept together\r\nunder so rarefied an atmosphere, and watercourses emptying the mountain\r\ntributaries. Leaning over the abyss, they hoped to catch some sounds\r\nfrom that orb for ever mute in the solitude of space. That last day left\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey took down the most trifling details. A vague uneasiness took\r\npossession of them as they neared the end. This uneasiness would have\r\nbeen doubled had they felt how their speed had decreased. It would\r\nhave seemed to them quite insufficient to carry them to the end. It was\r\nbecause the projectile then \"weighed\" almost nothing. Its weight was\r\never decreasing, and would be entirely annihilated on that line where\r\nthe lunar and terrestrial attractions would neutralize each other.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his preoccupation, Michel Ardan did not forget to prepare\r\nthe morning repast with his accustomed punctuality. They ate with a good\r\nappetite. Nothing was so excellent as the soup liquefied by the heat of\r\nthe gas; nothing better than the preserved meat. Some glasses of good\r\nFrench wine crowned the repast, causing Michel Ardan to remark that\r\nthe lunar vines, warmed by that ardent sun, ought to distil even more\r\ngenerous wines; that is, if they existed. In any case, the far-seeing\r\nFrenchman had taken care not to forget in his collection some precious\r\ncuttings of the Médoc and Côte d'Or, upon which he founded his hopes.\r\n\r\nReiset and Regnault's apparatus worked with great regularity. Not an\r\natom of carbonic acid resisted the potash; and as to the oxygen, Captain\r\nNicholl said \"it was of the first quality.\" The little watery vapour\r\nenclosed in the projectile mixing with the air tempered the dryness; and\r\nmany apartments in London, Paris, or New York, and many theatres, were\r\ncertainly not in such a healthy condition.\r\n\r\nBut that it might act with regularity, the apparatus must be kept in\r\nperfect order; so each morning Michel visited the escape regulators,\r\ntried the taps, and regulated the heat of the gas by the pyrometer.\r\nEverything had gone well up to that time, and the travellers, imitating\r\nthe worthy Joseph T. Maston, began to acquire a degree of embonpoint,\r\nwhich would have rendered them unrecognizable if their imprisonment had\r\nbeen prolonged to some months. In a word, they behaved like chickens in\r\na coop; they were getting fat.\r\n\r\nIn looking through the scuttle Barbicane saw the spectre of the dog,\r\nand other divers objects which had been thrown from the projectile\r\nobstinately following them. Diana howled lugubriously on seeing the\r\nremains of Satellite, which seemed as motionless as if they reposed on\r\nthe solid earth.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, my friends,\" said Michel Ardan, \"that if one of us had\r\nsuccumbed to the shock consequent on departure, we should have had a\r\ngreat deal of trouble to bury him? What am I saying? to _etherize_ him,\r\nas here ether takes the place of earth. You see the accusing body would\r\nhave followed us into space like a remorse.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would have been sad,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" continued Michel, \"what I regret is not being able to take a walk\r\noutside. What voluptuousness to float amid this radiant ether, to bathe\r\noneself in it, to wrap oneself in the sun's pure rays. If Barbicane had\r\nonly thought of furnishing us with a diving apparatus and an air-pump,\r\nI could have ventured out and assumed fanciful attitudes of feigned\r\nmonsters on the top of the projectile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, old Michel,\" replied Barbicane, \"you would not have made a feigned\r\nmonster long, for in spite of your diver's dress, swollen by the expansion\r\nof air within you, you would have burst like a shell, or rather like a\r\nballoon which has risen too high. So do not regret it, and do not forget\r\nthis—as long as we float in space, all sentimental walks beyond the\r\nprojectile are forbidden.\"\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan allowed himself to be convinced to a certain extent. He\r\nadmitted that the thing was difficult but not _impossible_, a word which\r\nhe never uttered.\r\n\r\nThe conversation passed from this subject to another, not failing for\r\nan instant. It seemed to the three friends as though, under present\r\nconditions, ideas shot up in their brains as leaves shoot at the first\r\nwarmth of spring. They felt bewildered. In the middle of the questions\r\nand answers which crossed each other, Nicholl put one question which did\r\nnot find an immediate solution.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed!\" said he; \"it is all very well to go to the moon, but how\r\nto get back again?\"\r\n\r\nHis two interlocutors looked surprised. One would have thought that this\r\npossibility now occurred to them for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that, Nicholl?\" asked Barbicane gravely.\r\n\r\n\"To ask for means to leave a country,\" added Michel, \"when we have not\r\nyet arrived there, seems to me rather inopportune.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say that, wishing to draw back,\" replied Nicholl; \"but I repeat\r\nmy question, and I ask, 'How shall we return?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing about it,\" answered Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Michel, \"if I had known how to return, I would never have\r\nstarted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"I COULD HAVE VENTURED OUT ON THE TOP OF\r\n   THE PROJECTILE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There's an answer!\" cried Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I quite approve of Michel's words,\" said Barbicane; \"and add, that the\r\nquestion has no real interest. Later, when we think it advisable to\r\nreturn, we will take counsel together. If the Columbiad is not there,\r\nthe projectile will be.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a step certainly. A ball without a gun!\"\r\n\r\n\"The gun,\" replied Barbicane, \"can be manufactured. The powder can be\r\nmade. Neither metals, saltpetre, nor coal can fail in the depths of\r\nthe moon, and we need only go 8000 leagues in order to fall upon the\r\nterrestrial globe by virtue of the mere laws of weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" said Michel with animation. \"Let it be no longer a question of\r\nreturning: we have already entertained it too long. As to communicating\r\nwith our former earthly colleagues, that will not be difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\"\r\n\r\n\"By means of meteors launched by lunar volcanos.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well thought of, Michel,\" said Barbicane in a convinced tone of voice.\r\n\"Laplace has calculated that a force five times greater than that of\r\nour gun would suffice to send a meteor from the moon to the earth, and\r\nthere is not one volcano which has not a greater power of propulsion than\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" exclaimed Michel; \"these meteors are handy postmen, and\r\ncost nothing. And how we shall be able to laugh at the post-office\r\nadministration. But now I think of it—\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of?\"\r\n\r\n\"A capital idea. Why did we not fasten a thread to our projectile, and\r\nwe could have exchanged telegrams with the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"The deuce!\" answered Nicholl. \"Do you consider the weight of a thread\r\n250,000 miles long nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"As nothing. They could have trebled the Columbiad's charge; they could\r\nhave quadrupled or quintupled it!\" exclaimed Michel, with whom the verb\r\ntook a higher intonation each time.\r\n\r\n\"There is but one little objection to make to your proposition,\" replied\r\nBarbicane, \"which is that, during the rotary motion of the globe, our\r\nthread would have wound itself round it like a chain on a capstan, and\r\nthat it would inevitably have brought us to the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the thirty-nine stars of the Union!\" said Michel, \"I have nothing\r\nbut impracticable ideas to-day; ideas worthy of J. T. Maston. But I have\r\na notion that, if we do not return to earth, J. T. Maston will be able\r\nto come to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he'll come,\" replied Barbicane; \"he is a worthy and a courageous\r\ncomrade. Besides, what is easier? Is not the Columbiad still buried\r\nin the soil of Florida? Is cotton and nitric acid wanted wherewith to\r\nmanufacture the pyroxile? Will not the moon again pass to the zenith of\r\nFlorida? In eighteen years' time will she not occupy exactly the same\r\nplace as to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Michel, \"yes, Marston will come, and with him our\r\nfriends Elphinstone, Blomsberry, all the members of the Gun Club, and they\r\nwill be well received. And by and by they will run trains of projectiles\r\nbetween the earth and the moon! Hurrah for J. T. Maston!\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, if the Hon. J. T. Maston did not hear the hurrahs\r\nuttered in his honour, his ears at least tingled. What was he doing then?\r\nDoubtless posted in the Rocky Mountains, at the station of Long's Peak,\r\nhe was trying to find the invisible projectile gravitating in space. If\r\nhe was thinking of his dear companions, we must allow that they were not\r\nfar behind him; and that, under the influence of a strange excitement,\r\nthey were devoting to him their best thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut whence this excitement, which was evidently growing upon the\r\ntenants of the projectile? Their sobriety could not be doubted. This\r\nstrange irritation of the brain, must it be attributed to the peculiar\r\ncircumstances under which they found themselves, to their proximity to\r\nthe orb of night, from which only a few hours separated them, to some\r\nsecret influence of the moon acting upon their nervous system? Their\r\nfaces were as rosy as if they had been exposed to the roaring flames\r\nof an oven; their voices resounded in loud accents; their words escaped\r\nlike a champagne cork driven out by carbonic acid; their gestures became\r\nannoying, they wanted so much room to perform them; and, strange to say,\r\nthey none of them noticed this great tension of the mind.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Nicholl, in a short tone, \"now that I do not know whether we\r\nshall ever return from the moon, I want to know what we are going to do\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"What we are going to do there?\" replied Barbicane, stamping with his\r\nfoot as if he was in a fencing saloon; \"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know!\" exclaimed Michel, with a bellow which provoked a\r\nsonorous echo in the projectile.\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not even thought about it,\" retorted Barbicane, in the same\r\nloud tone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, then,\" cried Nicholl, who could no longer contain the growling\r\nof his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I shall speak if it suits me,\" exclaimed Michel, seizing his companions'\r\narms with violence.\r\n\r\n\"_It must_ suit you,\" said Barbicane, with an eye on fire and a threatening\r\nhand. \"It was you who drew us into this frightful journey, and we want\r\nto know what for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the captain, \"now that I do not know where I am going, I want\r\nto know _why_ I am going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" exclaimed Michel, jumping a yard high, \"why? To take possession\r\nof the moon in the name of the United States; to add a fortieth State to\r\nthe Union; to colonize the lunar regions; to cultivate them, to people\r\nthem, to transport thither all the prodigies of art, of science, and\r\nindustry; to civilize the Selenites, unless they are more civilized than\r\nwe are; and to constitute them a republic, if they are not already one!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if there are no Selenites?\" retorted Nicholl, who, under the\r\ninfluence of this unaccountable intoxication, was very contradictory.\r\n\r\n\"Who said that there were no Selenites?\" exclaimed Michel in a threatening\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" howled Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" said Michel, \"do not repeat that insolence, or I will knock\r\nyour teeth down your throat!\"\r\n\r\nThe two adversaries were going to fall upon each other, and the incoherent\r\ndiscussion threatened to merge into a fight, when Barbicane intervened\r\nwith one bound.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, miserable men,\" said he, separating his two companions; \"if there\r\nare no Selenites, we will do without them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed Michel, who was not particular; \"yes, we will do without\r\nthem. We have only to make Selenites. Down with the Selenites!\"\r\n\r\n\"The empire of the moon belongs to us,\" said Nicholl. \"Let us three\r\nconstitute the republic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be the congress,\" cried Michel.\r\n\r\n\"And I the senate,\" retorted Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"And Barbicane, the president,\" howled Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Not a president elected by the nation,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, a president elected by the congress,\" cried Michel; \"and as\r\nI am the congress, you are unanimously elected!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! for President Barbicane,\" exclaimed Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Hip! hip! hip!\" vociferated Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nThen the President and the Senate struck up in a tremendous voice the\r\npopular song \"Yankee Doodle,\" whilst from the Congress resounded the\r\nmasculine tones of the \"Marseillaise.\"\r\n\r\nThen they struck up a frantic dance, with maniacal gestures, idiotic\r\nstampings, and somersaults like those of the boneless clowns in the\r\ncircus. Diana, joining in the dance, and howling in her turn, jumped to\r\nthe top of the projectile. An unaccountable flapping of wings was then\r\nheard amidst most fantastic cock-crows, while five or six hens fluttered\r\nlike bats against the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THEY STRUCK UP A FRANTIC DANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the three travelling companions, acted upon by some unaccountable\r\ninfluence above that of intoxication, inflamed by the air which had set\r\ntheir respiratory apparatus on fire, fell motionless to the bottom of\r\nthe projectile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n   AT SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND\r\n      FOURTEEN LEAGUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat had happened? Whence the cause of this singular intoxication, the\r\nconsequences of which might have been very disastrous? A simple blunder\r\nof Michel's, which, fortunately, Nicholl was able to correct in time.\r\n\r\nAfter a perfect swoon, which lasted some minutes, the captain, recovering\r\nfirst, soon collected his scattered senses. Although he had breakfasted\r\nonly two hours before, he felt a gnawing hunger, as if he had not eaten\r\nanything for several days. Everything about him, stomach and brain, were\r\noverexcited to the highest degree. He got up and demanded from Michel a\r\nsupplementary repast. Michel, utterly done up, did not answer.\r\n\r\nNicholl then tried to prepare some tea destined to help the absorption\r\nof a dozen sandwiches. He first tried to get some fire, and struck a\r\nmatch sharply. What was his surprise to see the sulphur shine with so\r\nextraordinary a brilliancy as to be almost unbearable to the eye. From\r\nthe gas-burner which he lit rose a flame equal to a jet of electric\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nA revelation dawned on Nicholl's mind. That intensity of light, the\r\nphysiological troubles which had arisen in him, the overexcitement of\r\nall his moral and quarrelsome faculties,—he understood all.\r\n\r\n\"The oxygen!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd leaning over the air apparatus, he saw that the tap was allowing\r\nthe scentless colourless gas to escape freely, life-giving, but in its\r\npure state producing the gravest disorders in the system. Michel had\r\nblunderingly opened the tap of the apparatus to the full.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"THE OXYGEN!\" HE EXCLAIMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicholl hastened to stop the escape of oxygen with which the atmosphere\r\nwas saturated, which would have been the death of the travellers, not by\r\nsuffocation, but by combustion. An hour later, the air less charged with\r\nit restored the lungs to their normal condition. By degrees the three\r\nfriends recovered from their intoxication; but they were obliged to sleep\r\nthemselves sober over their oxygen as a drunkard does over his wine.\r\n\r\nWhen Michel learnt his share of the responsibility of this incident,\r\nhe was not much disconcerted. This unexpected drunkenness broke the\r\nmonotony of the journey. Many foolish things had been said while under\r\nits influence, but also quickly forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" added the merry Frenchman, \"I am not sorry to have tasted\r\na little of this heady gas. Do you know, my friends, that a curious\r\nestablishment might be founded with rooms of oxygen, where people whose\r\nsystem is weakened could for a few hours live a more active life. Fancy\r\nparties where the room was saturated with this heroic fluid, theatres\r\nwhere it should be kept at high pressure; what passion in the souls of\r\nthe actors and spectators! what fire, what enthusiasm! And if, instead of\r\nan assembly only a whole people could be saturated, what activity in its\r\nfunctions, what a supplement to life it would derive. From an exhausted\r\nnation they might make a great and strong one, and I know more than one\r\nstate in old Europe which ought to put itself under the regime of oxygen\r\nfor the sake of its health!\"\r\n\r\nMichel spoke with so much animation that one might have fancied that the\r\ntap was still too open. But a few words from Barbicane soon scattered\r\nhis enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"That is all very well, friend Michel,\" said he, \"but will you inform\r\nus where these chickens came from which have mixed themselves up in our\r\nconcert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those chickens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, half a dozen chickens and a fine cock were walking about, flapping\r\ntheir wings and chattering.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the awkward things!\" exclaimed Michel. \"The oxygen has made them\r\nrevolt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you want to do with these chickens?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"To acclimatize them in the moon, by Jove!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you hide them?\"\r\n\r\n\"A joke, my worthy president, a simple joke, which has proved a miserable\r\nfailure. I wanted to set them free on the lunar continent, without\r\nsaying anything. Oh, what would have been your amazement on seeing these\r\nearthly-winged animals pecking in the lunar fields!\"\r\n\r\n\"You rascal, you unmitigated rascal,\" replied Barbicane, \"you do not\r\nwant oxygen to mount to the head. You are always what _we_ were under\r\nthe influence of the gas; you are always foolish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, who says that we were not wise then?\" replied Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nAfter this philosophical reflection, the three friends set about restoring\r\nthe order of the projectile. Chickens and cock were reinstated in their\r\ncoup. But whilst proceeding with this operation, Barbicane and his two\r\ncompanions had a most desired perception of a new phenomenon. From the\r\nmoment of leaving the earth, their own weight, that of the projectile,\r\nand the objects it enclosed, had been subject to an increasing diminution.\r\nIf they could not prove this loss of the projectile, a moment would\r\narrive when it would be sensibly felt upon themselves and the utensils\r\nand instruments they used.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that a _scale_ would not show this loss; for the\r\nweight destined to weigh the object would have lost exactly as much as\r\nthe object itself; but a spring steelyard for example, the tension of\r\nwhich was independent of the attraction, would have given a just estimate\r\nof this loss.\r\n\r\nWe know that the attraction, otherwise called the _weight_, is in\r\nproportion to the densities of bodies, and inversely as the squares of\r\nthe distances. Hence this effect: If the earth had been alone in space, if\r\nthe other celestial bodies had been suddenly annihilated, the projectile,\r\naccording to Newton's laws, would weigh less as it got farther from the\r\nearth, but without ever losing its weight _entirely_, for the terrestrial\r\nattraction would always have made itself felt, at whatever distance.\r\n\r\nBut, in reality, a time must come when the projectile would no longer\r\nbe subject to the law of weight, after allowing for the other celestial\r\nbodies whose effect could not be set down as zero. Indeed, the\r\nprojectile's course was being traced between the earth and the moon.\r\nAs it distanced the earth, the terrestrial attraction diminished: but\r\nthe lunar attraction rose in proportion. There must then come a point\r\nwhere these two attractions would neutralize each other: the projectile\r\nwould possess weight no longer. If the moon's and the earth's densities\r\nhad been equal, this point would have been at an equal distance between\r\nthe two orbs. But taking the different densities into consideration, it\r\nwas easy to reckon that this point would be situated at 47-60ths of the\r\nwhole journey, i.e. at 78,114 leagues from the earth. At this point, a\r\nbody having no principle of speed or displacement in itself, would remain\r\nimmovable for ever, being attracted equally by both orbs, and not being\r\ndrawn more towards one than towards the other.\r\n\r\nNow if the projectile's impulsive force had been correctly calculated, it\r\nwould attain this point without speed, having lost all trace of weight,\r\nas well as all the objects within it. What would happen then? Three\r\nhypotheses presented themselves.\r\n\r\n1. Either it would retain a certain amount of motion, and pass the point\r\nof equal attraction, and fall upon the moon by virtue of the excess of\r\nthe lunar attraction over the terrestrial.\r\n\r\n2. Or, its speed failing, and unable to reach the point of equal\r\nattraction, it would fall upon the moon by virtue of the excess of the\r\nlunar attraction over the terrestrial.\r\n\r\n3. Or, lastly, animated with sufficient speed to enable it to reach the\r\nneutral point, but not sufficient to pass it, it would remain for ever\r\nsuspended in that spot like the pretended tomb of Mahomet, between the\r\nzenith and the nadir.\r\n\r\nSuch was their situation; and Barbicane clearly explained the consequences\r\nto his travelling companions, which greatly interested them. But how\r\nshould they know when the projectile had reached this neutral point\r\nsituated at that distance, especially when neither themselves, nor the\r\nobjects enclosed in the projectile, would be any longer subject to the\r\nlaws of weight?\r\n\r\nUp to this time, the travellers, whilst admitting that this action was\r\nconstantly decreasing, had not yet become sensible to its total absence.\r\n\r\nBut that day, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Nicholl having\r\naccidentally let a glass slip from his hand, the glass, instead of\r\nfalling, remained suspended in the air.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"that is rather an amusing piece of natural\r\nphilosophy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd immediately divers other objects, firearms and bottles, abandoned\r\nto themselves, held themselves up as by enchantment. Diana too, placed\r\nin space by Michel, reproduced, but without any trick, the wonderful\r\nsuspension practised by Caston and Robert Houdin. Indeed the dog did not\r\nseem to know that she was floating in air.\r\n\r\nThe three adventurous companions were surprised and stupefied, despite\r\ntheir scientific reasonings. They felt themselves being carried into the\r\ndomain of wonders! they felt that _weight_ was really wanting to their\r\nbodies. If they stretched out their arms, they did not attempt to fall.\r\nTheir heads shook on their shoulders. Their feet no longer clung to the\r\nfloor of the projectile. They were like drunken men having no stability\r\nin themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"AH! IF RAPHAEL HAD SEEN US THUS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFancy has depicted men without reflection, others without shadow. But\r\nhere _reality,_ by the neutralisation of attractive forces, produced men\r\nin whom nothing had any weight, and who weighed nothing themselves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Michel, taking a spring, left the floor and remained suspended\r\nin the air, like Murillo's monk of the _Cusine des Anges._\r\n\r\nThe two friends joined him instantly, and all three formed a miraculous\r\n\"Ascension\" in the centre of the projectile.\r\n\r\n\"Is it to be believed? is it probable? is it possible?\" exclaimed Michel;\r\n\"and yet it is so. Ah! if Raphael had seen us thus, what an 'Assumption'\r\nhe would have thrown upon canvas!\"\r\n\r\n\"The 'Assumption' cannot last,\" replied Barbicane. \"If the projectile\r\npasses the neutral point, the lunar attraction will draw us to the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then our feet will be upon the roof,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Barbicane, \"because the projectile's centre of gravity is very\r\nlow; it will only turn by degrees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then all our portables will be upset from top to bottom, that is a\r\nfact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, Michel,\" replied Nicholl; \"no upset is to be feared; not\r\na thing will move, for the projectile's evolution will be imperceptible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" continued Barbicane; \"and when it has passed the point of equal\r\nattraction, its base, being the heavier, will draw it perpendicularly to\r\nthe moon; but, in order that this phenomenon should take place, we must\r\nhave passed the neutral line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pass the neutral line!\" cried Michel; \"then let us do as the sailors do\r\nwhen they cross the equator.\"\r\n\r\nA slight side movement brought Michel back towards the padded side;\r\nthence he took a bottle and glasses, placed them \"in space\" before his\r\ncompanions, and, drinking merrily, they saluted the line with a triple\r\nhurrah. The influence of these attractions scarcely lasted an hour;\r\nthe travellers felt themselves insensibly drawn towards the floor, and\r\nBarbicane fancied that the conical end of the projectile was varying a\r\nlittle from its normal direction towards the moon. By an inverse motion\r\nthe base was approaching first; the lunar attraction was prevailing\r\nover the terrestrial; the fall towards the moon was beginning, almost\r\nimperceptibly as yet, but by degrees the attractive force would become\r\nstronger, the fall would be more decided, the projectile, drawn by its\r\nbase, would turn its cone to the earth, and fall with ever-increasing\r\nspeed on to the surface of the Selenite continent; their destination\r\nwould then be attained. Now nothing could prevent the success of their\r\nenterprise, and Nicholl and Michel Ardan shared Barbicane's joy.\r\n\r\nThen they chatted of all the phenomena which had astonished them one\r\nafter the other, particularly the neutralization of the laws of weight.\r\nMichel Ardan, always enthusiastic, drew conclusions which were purely\r\nfanciful.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my worthy friends,\" he exclaimed, \"what progress we should make\r\nif on earth we could throw off some of that weight, some of that chain\r\nwhich binds us to her; it would be the prisoner set at liberty; no more\r\nfatigue of either arms or legs. Or, if it is true that in order to fly\r\non the earth's surface, to keep oneself suspended in the air merely by\r\nthe play of the muscles, there requires a strength a hundred and fifty\r\ntimes greater than that which we possess, a simple act of volition, a\r\ncaprice, would bear us into space, if attraction did not exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Nicholl, smiling; \"if we could succeed in suppressing\r\nweight as they suppress pain by anæsthesia, that would change the face\r\nof modern society!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" cried Michel, full of his subject, \"destroy weight, and no more\r\nburdens!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said,\" replied Barbicane; \"but if nothing had any weight, nothing\r\nwould keep in its place, not even your hat on your head, worthy Michel;\r\nnor your house, whose stones only adhere by weight; not a boat, whose\r\nstability on the water is caused only by weight; not even the ocean,\r\nwhose waves would no longer be equalized by terrestrial attraction; and\r\nlastly, not even the _atmosphere,_ whose atoms, being no longer held in\r\ntheir places, would disperse in space!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is tiresome,\" retorted Michel; \"nothing like these matter-of-fact\r\npeople for bringing one back to the bare reality.\"\r\n\r\n\"But console yourself, Michel,\" continued Barbicane, \"for if no orb\r\nexists from whence all laws of weight are banished, you are at least\r\ngoing to visit one where it is much less than on the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the moon, on whose surface objects weigh six times less than on\r\nthe earth, a phenomenon easy to prove.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we shall feel it?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently, as 200 lbs. will only weigh 30 pounds on the surface of the\r\nmoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And our muscular strength will not diminish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all; instead of jumping one yard high, you will rise eighteen\r\nfeet high.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we shall be regular Herculeses in the moon!\" exclaimed Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Nicholl; \"for if the height of the Selenites is in\r\nproportion to the density of their globe, they will be scarcely a foot\r\nhigh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lilliputians!\" ejaculated Michel; \"I shall play the part of Gulliver.\r\nWe are going to realize the fable of the giants. This is the advantage\r\nof leaving one's own planet and overrunning the solar world.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment, Michel,\" answered Barbicane; \"if you wish to play the part\r\nof Gulliver, only visit the inferior planets, such as Mercury, Venus, or\r\nMars, whose density is a little less than that of the earth; but do not\r\nventure into the great planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune; for\r\nthere the order will be changed, and you will become Lilliputian.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in the sun?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the sun, if its density is thirteen hundred and twenty-four thousand\r\ntimes greater, and the attraction is twenty-seven times greater than\r\non the surface of our globe, keeping everything in proportion, the\r\ninhabitants ought to be at least two hundred feet high.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed Michel; \"I should be nothing more than a pigmy, a\r\nshrimp!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gulliver with the giants,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"And it would not be quite useless to carry some pieces of artillery to\r\ndefend oneself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" replied Nicholl; \"your projectiles would have no effect on the\r\nsun; they would fall back on the earth after some minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a strong remark.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certain,\" replied Barbicane; \"the attraction is so great on this\r\nenormous orb, that an object weighing 70,000 lbs. on the earth would\r\nweigh but 1920 lbs. on the surface of the sun. If you were to fall upon\r\nit you would weigh—let me see—about 5000 lbs., a weight which you\r\nwould never be able to raise again.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" said Michel; \"one would want a portable crane. However, we\r\nwill be satisfied with the moon for the present; there at least we shall\r\ncut a great figure. We will see about the sun by and by.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n   THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEVIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane had now no fear of the issue of the journey, at least as far\r\nas the projectile's impulsive force was concerned; its own speed would\r\ncarry it beyond the neutral line; it would certainly not return to earth;\r\nit would certainly not remain motionless on the line of attraction. One\r\nsingle hypothesis remained to be realized, the arrival of the projectile\r\nat its destination by the action of the lunar attraction.\r\n\r\nIt was in reality a fall of 8296 leagues on an orb, it is true, where\r\nweight could only be reckoned at one-sixth of terrestrial weight; a\r\nformidable fall, nevertheless, and one against which every precaution\r\nmust be taken without delay.\r\n\r\nThese precautions were of two sorts, some to deaden the shock when the\r\nprojectile should touch the lunar soil, others to delay the fall, and\r\nconsequently make it less violent.\r\n\r\nTo deaden the shock, it was a pity that Barbicane was no longer able to\r\nemploy the means which had so ably weakened the shock at departure, that\r\nis to say, by water used as springs and the partition-breaks.\r\n\r\nThe partitions still existed but water failed, for they could not use\r\ntheir reserve, which was precious, in case during the first days the\r\nliquid element should be found wanting on lunar soil.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed this reserve would have been quite insufficient for a spring.\r\nThe layer of water stored in the projectile at their departure, and on\r\nwhich the waterproof disc lay, occupied no less than three feet in depth,\r\nand spread over a surface of not less than fifty-four square feet. Besides,\r\nthe cistern did not contain one fifth part of it; they must therefore\r\ngive up this efficient means of deadening the shock of arrival. Happily,\r\nBarbicane, not content with employing water, had furnished the movable\r\ndisc with strong spring plugs, destined to lessen the shock against the\r\nbase after the breaking of the horizontal partitions. These plugs still\r\nexisted; they had only to readjust them and replace the movable disc;\r\nevery piece, easy to handle, as their weight was now scarcely felt, was\r\nquickly mounted.\r\n\r\nThe different pieces were fitted without trouble, it being only a matter\r\nof bolts and screws; tools were not wanting, and soon the reinstated\r\ndisc lay on its steel plugs, like a table on its legs. One inconvenience\r\nresulted from the replacing of the disc, the lower window was blocked\r\nup; thus it was impossible for the travellers to observe the moon from\r\nthat opening while they were being precipitated perpendicularly upon\r\nher; but they were obliged to give it up; even by the side openings they\r\ncould still see vast lunar regions, as an aeronaut sees the earth from\r\nhis car.\r\n\r\nThis replacing of the disc was at least an hour's work. It was past twelve\r\nwhen all preparations were finished. Barbicane took fresh observations\r\non the inclination of the projectile, but to his annoyance it had not\r\nturned over sufficiently for its fall; it seemed to take a curve parallel\r\nto the lunar disc. The orb of night shone splendidly into space, while\r\nopposite, the orb of day blazed with fire.\r\n\r\nTheir situation began to make them uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"Are we reaching our destination?\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Let us act as if we were about reaching it,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"You are sceptical,\" retorted Michel Ardan. \"We shall arrive, and that,\r\ntoo, quicker than we like.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer brought Barbicane back to his preparations, and he occupied\r\nhimself with placing the contrivances intended to break their descent.\r\nWe may remember the scene of the meeting held at Tampa Town, in Florida,\r\nwhen Captain Nicholl came forward as Barbicane's enemy and Michel Ardan's\r\nadversary. To Captain Nicholl's maintaining that the projectile would\r\nsmash like glass, Michel replied that he would break their fall by means\r\nof rockets properly placed.\r\n\r\nThus, powerful fireworks, taking their starting-point from the base and\r\nbursting outside, could, by producing a recoil, check to a certain degree\r\nthe projectile's speed. These rockets were to burn in space, it is true;\r\nbut oxygen would not fail them, for they could supply themselves with\r\nit, like the lunar volcanoes, the burning of which has never yet been\r\nstopped by the want of atmosphere round the moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had accordingly supplied himself with these fireworks, enclosed\r\nin little steel guns, which could be screwed on to the base of the\r\nprojectile. Inside, these guns were flush with the bottom; outside, they\r\nprotruded about eighteen inches. There were twenty of them. An opening\r\nleft in the disc allowed them to light the match with which each was\r\nprovided. All the effect was felt outside. The burning mixture had been\r\nalready rammed into each gun. They had, then, nothing to do but to raise\r\nthe metallic buffers fixed in the base, and replace them by the guns,\r\nwhich fitted closely in their places.\r\n\r\nThis new work was finished about three o'clock, and after taking all\r\nthese precautions there remained but to wait. But the projectile was\r\nperceptibly nearing the moon, and evidently succumbed to her influence\r\nto a certain degree; though its own velocity also drew it in an oblique\r\ndirection. From these conflicting influences resulted a line which might\r\nbecome a tangent. But it was certain that the projectile would not fall\r\ndirectly on the moon; for its lower part, by reason of its weight, ought\r\nto be turned towards her.\r\n\r\nBarbicane's uneasiness increased as he saw his projectile resist the\r\ninfluence of gravitation. The Unknown was opening before him, the Unknown\r\nin interplanetary space. The man of science thought he had foreseen the\r\nonly three hypotheses possible—the return to the earth, the return to\r\nthe moon, or stagnation on the neutral line; and here a fourth hypothesis,\r\nbig with all the terrors of the Infinite, surged up inopportunely. To\r\nface it without flinching, one must be a resolute savant like Barbicane,\r\na phlegmatic being like Nicholl, or an audacious adventurer like Michel\r\nArdan.\r\n\r\nConversation was started upon this subject. Other men would have\r\nconsidered the question from a practical point of view; they would have\r\nasked themselves whither their projectile carriage was carrying them.\r\nNot so with these; they sought for the cause which produced this effect.\r\n\r\n\"So we have become diverted from our route,\" said Michel; \"but why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I very much fear,\" answered Nicholl, \"that, in spite of all precautions\r\ntaken, the Columbiad was not fairly pointed. An error, however small,\r\nwould be enough to throw us out of the moon's attraction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they must have aimed badly?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think so,\" replied Barbicane. \"The perpendicularity of the gun\r\nwas exact, its direction to the zenith of the spot incontestible; and\r\nthe moon passing to the zenith of the spot, we ought to reach it at the\r\nfull. There is another reason, but it escapes me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we not arriving too late?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Too late?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Nicholl. \"The Cambridge Observatory's note says that the\r\ntransit ought to be accomplished in ninety-seven hours thirteen minutes\r\nand twenty seconds; which means to say, that _sooner_ the moon will _not_\r\nbe at the point indicated, and that _later_ it will have passed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied Barbicane. \"But we started the 1st of December, at\r\nthirteen minutes and twenty-five seconds to eleven at night; and we\r\nought to arrive on the 5th at midnight, at the exact moment when the moon\r\nwould be full; and we are now at the 5th of December. It is now half past\r\nthree in the evening; half past eight ought to see us at the end of our\r\njourney. Why do we not arrive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Might it not be an excess of speed?\" answered Nicholl; \"for we know now\r\nthat its initial velocity was greater than they supposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! a hundred times, No!\" replied Barbicane. \"An excess of speed, if the\r\ndirection of the projectile had been right, would not have prevented us\r\nreaching the moon. No, there has been a deviation. We have been turned\r\nout of our course.\"\r\n\r\n\"By whom? by what?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, Barbicane,\" said Michel, \"do you wish to know my\r\nopinion on the subject of finding out this deviation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not give half a dollar to know it. That we have deviated is a\r\nfact. Where we are going to matters little; we shall soon see. Since we\r\nare being borne along in space we shall end by falling into some centre\r\nof attraction or other.\"\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan's indifference did not content Barbicane. Not that he was\r\nuneasy about the future, but he wanted to know at any cost _why_ his\r\nprojectile had deviated.\r\n\r\nBut the projectile continued its course sideways to the moon, and with\r\nit the mass of things thrown out. Barbicane could even prove, by the\r\nelevations which served as landmarks upon the moon, which was only 2000\r\nleagues distant, that its speed was becoming uniform—fresh proof that\r\nthere was no fall. Its impulsive force still prevailed over the lunar\r\nattraction, but the projectile's course was certainly bringing it nearer\r\nto the moon, and they might hope that at a nearer point the weight,\r\npredominating, would cause a decided fall.\r\n\r\nThe three friends, having nothing better to do, continued their\r\nobservations; but they could not yet determine the topographical position\r\nof the satellite; every relief was levelled under the reflection of the\r\nsolar rays.\r\n\r\nThey watched thus through the side windows until eight o'clock at night.\r\nThe moon had then grown so large in their eyes that it filled half of\r\nthe firmament. The sun on one side, and the orb of night on the other,\r\nflooded the projectile with light.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Barbicane thought he could estimate the distance which\r\nseparated them from their aim at no more than 700 leagues. The speed of\r\nthe projectile seemed to him to be more than 200 yards, or about 170\r\nleagues a second. Under the centripetal force, the base of the projectile\r\ntended towards the moon; but the centrifugal still prevailed; and it was\r\nprobable that its rectilineal course would be changed to a curve of some\r\nsort, the nature of which they could not at present determine.\r\n\r\nBarbicane was still seeking the solution of his insoluble problem. Hours\r\npassed without any result. The projectile was evidently _nearing_ the\r\nmoon, but it was also evident that it would never _reach_ her. As to the\r\nnearest distance at which it would pass her, that must be the result of\r\nthe two forces, attraction and repulsion, affecting its motion.\r\n\r\n\"I ask but one thing,\" said Michel; \"that we may pass near enough to\r\npenetrate her secrets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cursed be the thing that has caused our projectile to deviate from its\r\ncourse,\" cried Nicholl.\r\n\r\nAnd, as if a light had suddenly broken in upon his mind, Barbicane\r\nanswered, \"Then cursed be the meteor which crossed our path.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" exclaimed Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" said Barbicane in a decided tone, \"I mean that our deviation\r\nis owing solely to our meeting with this erring body.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it did not even brush us as it passed,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"What does that matter? Its mass, compared to that of our projectile,\r\nwas enormous, and its attraction was enough to influence our course.\"\r\n\r\n\"So little?\" cried Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Nicholl; but however little it might be,\" replied Barbicane, \"in a\r\ndistance of 84,000 leagues, it wanted no more to make us miss the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n   THE OBSERVERS OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane had evidently hit upon the only plausible reason of this\r\ndeviation. However slight it might have been, it had sufficed to modify\r\nthe course of the projectile. It was a fatality. The bold attempt had\r\nmiscarried by a fortuitous circumstance; and unless by some exceptional\r\nevent, they could now never reach the moon's disc.\r\n\r\nWould they pass near enough to be able to solve certain physical and\r\ngeological questions until then insoluble? This was the question, and\r\nthe only one, which occupied the minds of these bold travellers. As to\r\nthe fate in store for themselves, they did not even dream of it.\r\n\r\nBut what would become of them amid these infinite solitudes, these who\r\nwould soon want air? A few more days, and they would fall stifled in\r\nthis wandering projectile. But some days to these intrepid fellows was a\r\ncentury; and they devoted all their time to observe that moon which they\r\nno longer hoped to reach.\r\n\r\nThe distance which then separated the projectile from the satellite\r\nwas estimated at about 200 leagues. Under these conditions, as regards\r\nthe visibility of the details of the disc, the travellers were farther\r\nfrom the moon than are the inhabitants of the earth with their powerful\r\ntelescopes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE TELESCOPE AT PARSONTOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, we know that the instrument mounted by Lord Rosse at Parsonstown,\r\nwhich magnifies 6500 times, brings the moon to within an apparent\r\ndistance of sixteen leagues. And more than that, with the powerful one\r\nset up at Long's Peak, the orb of night, magnified 48,000 times, is\r\nbrought to within less than two leagues, and objects having a diameter\r\nof thirty feet are seen very distinctly. So that, at this distance, the\r\ntopographical details of the moon, observed without glasses, could not\r\nbe determined with precision. The eye caught the vast outline of those\r\nimmense depressions inappropriately called \"seas,\" but they could not\r\nrecognize their nature. The prominence of the mountains disappeared\r\nunder the splendid irradiation produced by the reflection of the solar\r\nrays. The eye, dazzled as if it was leaning over a bath of molten silver,\r\nturned from it involuntarily; but the oblong form of the orb was quite\r\nclear. It appeared like a gigantic egg, with the small end turned towards\r\nthe earth. Indeed the moon, liquid and pliable in the first days of its\r\nformation, was originally a perfect sphere; but being soon drawn within\r\nthe attraction of the earth, it became elongated under the influence\r\nof gravitation. In becoming a satellite, she lost her native purity of\r\nform; her centre of gravity was in advance of the centre of her figure;\r\nand from this fact some savants draw the conclusion that the air and\r\nwater had taken refuge on the opposite surface of the moon, which is\r\nnever seen from the earth. This alteration in the primitive form of the\r\nsatellite was only perceptible for a few moments. The distance of the\r\nprojectile from the moon diminished very rapidly under its speed, though\r\nthat was much less than its initial velocity,—but eight or nine times\r\ngreater than that which propels our express trains. The oblique course\r\nof the projectile, from its very obliquity, gave Michel Ardan some hopes\r\nof striking the lunar disc at some point or other. He could not think\r\nthat they would never reach it. No! he could not believe it; and this\r\nopinion he often repeated. But Barbicane, who was a better judge, always\r\nanswered him with merciless logic.\r\n\r\n\"No, Michel, no! We can only reach the moon by a fall, and we are not\r\nfalling. The centripetal force keeps us under the moon's influence, but\r\nthe centrifugal force draws us irresistibly away from it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was said in a tone which quenched Michel Ardan's last hope.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the moon which the projectile was nearing was the northern\r\nhemisphere, that which the Selenographic maps place below; for these\r\nmaps are generally drawn after the outline given by the glasses, and we\r\nknow that they reverse the objects. Such was the _Mappa Selenographica_\r\nof Bœer and Moedler which Barbicane consulted. This northern hemisphere\r\npresented vast plains, dotted with isolated mountains.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the moon was full. At that precise moment the travellers\r\nshould have alighted upon it, if the mischievous meteor had not diverted\r\ntheir course. The orb was exactly in the condition determined by the\r\nCambridge Observatory. It was mathematically at its perigee, and at the\r\nzenith of the twenty-eighth parallel. An observer placed at the bottom\r\nof the enormous Columbiad, pointed perpendicularly to the horizon, would\r\nhave framed the moon in the mouth of the gun. A straight line drawn\r\nthrough the axis of the piece would have passed through the centre of\r\nthe orb of night. It is needless to say, that during the night of the\r\n5th—6th of December, the travellers took not an instant's rest. Could\r\nthey close their eyes when so near this new world? No! All their feelings\r\nwere concentrated in one single thought:—See! Representatives of the\r\nearth, of humanity, past and present, all centred in them! It is through\r\ntheir eyes that the human race look at these lunar regions, and penetrate\r\nthe secrets of their satellite! A strange emotion filled their hearts as\r\nthey went from one window to the other.\r\n\r\nTheir observations, reproduced by Barbicane, were rigidly determined. To\r\ntake them, they had glasses; to correct them, maps.\r\n\r\nAs regards the optical instruments at their disposal, they had excellent\r\nmarine glasses specially constructed for this journey.\r\n\r\nThey possessed magnifying powers of 100. They would thus have brought the\r\nmoon to within a distance (apparent) of less than 2000 leagues from the\r\nearth. But then, at a distance which for three hours in the morning did\r\nnot exceed sixty-five miles, and in a medium free from all atmospheric\r\ndisturbances, these instruments could reduce the lunar surface to within\r\nless than 1500 yards!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n   FANCY AND REALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen the moon?\" asked a professor, ironically, of one of\r\nhis pupils.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir!\" replied the pupil, still more ironically, \"but I must say I\r\nhave heard it spoken of.\"\r\n\r\nIn one sense, the pupil's witty answer might be given by a large majority\r\nof sublunary beings. How many people have heard speak of the moon who\r\nhave never seen it—at least through a glass or a telescope! How many\r\nhave never examined the map of their satellite!\r\n\r\nIn looking at a selenographic map, one peculiarity strikes us. Contrary\r\nto the arrangement followed for that of the Earth and Mars, the continents\r\noccupy more particularly the southern hemisphere of the lunar globe.\r\nThese continents do not show such decided, clear, and regular boundary\r\nlines as South America, Africa, and the Indian peninsula. Their angular,\r\ncapricious, and deeply indented coasts are rich in gulfs and peninsulas.\r\nThey remind one of the confusion in the islands of the Sound, where the\r\nland is excessively indented. If navigation ever existed on the surface\r\nof the moon, it must have been wonderfully difficult and dangerous; and\r\nwe may well pity the Selenite sailors and hydrographers; the former,\r\nwhen they came upon these perilous coasts, the latter when they took the\r\nsoundings of its stormy banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD SPEAK OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may also notice that, on the lunar sphere, the south pole is much more\r\ncontinental than the north pole. On the latter, there is but one slight\r\nstrip of land separated from other continents by vast seas. Towards the\r\nsouth, continents clothe almost the whole of the hemisphere. It is even\r\npossible that the Selenites have already planted the flag on one of\r\ntheir poles, whilst Franklin, Ross, Kane, Dumont d'Urville, and Lambert\r\nhave never yet been able to attain that unknown point of the terrestrial\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nAs to islands, they are numerous on the surface of the moon. Nearly\r\nall oblong or circular, and as if traced with the compass, they seem to\r\nform one vast Archipelago, equal to that charming group lying between\r\nGreece and Asia Minor, and which mythology in ancient times adorned with\r\nmost graceful legends. Involuntarily the names of Naxos, Tenedos, and\r\nCarpathos, rise before the mind, and we seek vainly for Ulysses' vessel\r\nor the \"clipper\" of the Argonauts. So at least it was in Michel Ardan's\r\neyes. To him it was a Grecian Archipelago that he saw on the map. To\r\nthe eyes of his matter-of-fact companions, the aspect of these coasts\r\nrecalled rather the parcelled-out land of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia;\r\nand where the Frenchman discovered traces of the heroes of fable, these\r\nAmericans were marking the most favourable points for the establishment\r\nof stores in the interests of lunar commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering over these vast continents, the eye is attracted by still\r\ngreater seas. Not only their formation, but their situation and aspect\r\nremind one of the terrestrial oceans; but again, as on earth, these seas\r\noccupy the greater portion of the globe. But in point of fact, these\r\nare not liquid spaces, but plains, the nature of which the travellers\r\nhoped soon to determine. Astronomers, we must allow, have graced these\r\npretended seas with at least odd names, which science has respected up to\r\nthe present time. Michel Ardan was right when he compared this map to a\r\n\"Tendre card,\" got up by a Scudary or a Cyrano de Bergerac. \"Only,\" said\r\nhe, \"it is no longer the sentimental card of the seventeenth century, it\r\nis the card of life, very neatly divided into two parts, one feminine,\r\nthe other masculine; the right hemisphere for woman, the left for man.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking thus, Michel made his prosaic companions shrug their\r\nshoulders. Barbicane and Nicholl looked upon the lunar map from a very\r\ndifferent point of view to that of their fantastic friend. Nevertheless,\r\ntheir fantastic friend was a little in the right. Judge for yourselves.\r\n\r\nIn the left hemisphere stretches the \"Sea of Clouds,\" where human reason\r\nis so often shipwrecked. Not far off lies the \"Sea of Rains,\" fed by all\r\nthe fever of existence. Near this is the \"Sea of Storms,\" where man is\r\never fighting against his passions, which too often gain the victory.\r\nThen, worn out by deceit, treasons, infidelity, and the whole body of\r\nterrestrial misery, what does he find at the end of his career? that vast\r\n\"Sea of Humours,\" barely softened by some drops of the waters from the\r\n\"Gulf of Dew!\" Clouds, rain, storms, and humours,—does the life of man\r\ncontain aught but these? and is it not summed up in these four words?\r\n\r\nThe right hemisphere, \"dedicated to the ladies,\" encloses smaller seas,\r\nwhose significant names contain every incident of a feminine existence.\r\nThere is the \"Sea of Serenity,\" over which the young girl bends; \"The\r\nLake of Dreams,\" reflecting a joyous future; \"the Sea of Nectar,\" with its\r\nwaves of tenderness and breezes of love; \"The Sea of Fruitfulness;\" \"The\r\nSea of Crises;\" then the \"Sea of Vapours,\" whose dimensions are perhaps\r\na little too confined; and lastly, that vast \"Sea of Tranquillity,\" in\r\nwhich every false passion, every useless dream, every unsatisfied desire\r\nis at length absorbed, and whose waves emerge peaceably into the \"Lake\r\nof Death!\"\r\n\r\nWhat a strange succession of names! What a singular division of the moon's\r\ntwo hemispheres, joined to one another like man and woman, and forming\r\nthat sphere of life carried into space! And was not the fantastic Michel\r\nright in thus interpreting the fancies of the ancient astronomers? But\r\nwhilst his imagination thus roved over \"the seas,\" his grave companions\r\nwere considering things more geographically. They were learning this new\r\nworld by heart. They were measuring angles and diameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n   OROGRAPHIC DETAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course taken by the projectile, as we have before remarked, was\r\nbearing it towards the moon's northern hemisphere. The travellers were\r\nfar from the central point which they would have struck, had their course\r\nnot been subject to an irremediable deviation. It was past midnight; and\r\nBarbicane then estimated the distance at 750 miles, which was a little\r\ngreater than the length of the lunar radius, and which would diminish\r\nas it advanced nearer to the North Pole. The projectile was then not\r\nat the altitude of the equator; but across the tenth parallel, and from\r\nthat latitude, carefully taken on the map to the pole, Barbicane and his\r\ntwo companions were able to observe the moon under the most favourable\r\nconditions. Indeed, by means of glasses, the above named distance was\r\nreduced to little more than fourteen miles. The telescope of the Rocky\r\nMountains brought the moon much nearer; but the terrestrial atmosphere\r\nsingularly lessened its power. Thus Barbicane, posted in his projectile,\r\nwith the glasses to his eyes, could seize upon details which were almost\r\nimperceptible to earthly observers.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said the president, in a serious voice, \"I do not know\r\nwhither we are going; I do not know if we shall ever see the terrestrial\r\nglobe again. Nevertheless, let us proceed as if our work would one day\r\nbe useful to our fellow-men. Let us keep our minds free from every other\r\nconsideration. We are astronomers; and this projectile is a room in the\r\nCambridge University, carried into space. Let us make our observations!\"\r\n\r\nThis said, work was begun with great exactness; and they faithfully\r\nreproduced the different aspects of the moon, at the different distances\r\nwhich the projectile reached.\r\n\r\nAt the time that the projectile was as high as the tenth parallel,\r\nnorth latitude, it seemed rigidly to follow the twentieth degree, east\r\nlongitude. We must here make one important remark with regard to the map\r\nby which they were taking observations. In the selenographical maps where,\r\non account of the reversing of the objects by the glasses, the south\r\nis above and the north below, it would seem natural that, on account of\r\nthat inversion, the east should be to the left hand, and the west to the\r\nright. But it is not so. If the map were turned upside down, showing the\r\nmoon as we see her, the east would be to the _left_, and the west to the\r\n_right_, contrary to that which exists on terrestrial maps. The following\r\nis the reason of this anomaly. Observers in the northern hemisphere\r\n(say in Europe) see the moon in the south,— according to them. When\r\nthey take observations, they turn their backs to the north, the reverse\r\nposition to that which they occupy when they study a terrestrial map. As\r\nthey turn their backs to the north, the east is on their left, and the\r\nwest to their right. To observers in the southern hemisphere (Patagonia\r\nfor example), the moon's west would be quite to their left, and the east\r\nto their right, as the south is behind them. Such is the reason of the\r\napparent reversing of these two cardinal points, and we must bear it in\r\nmind in order to be able to follow President Barbicane's\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Bœer and Moedler's _Mappa Selenographica_, the travellers\r\nwere able at once to recognise that portion of the disc enclosed within\r\nthe field of their glasses.\r\n\r\n\"What are we looking at, at this moment?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"At the northern part of the 'Sea of Clouds,'\" answered Barbicane. \"We\r\nare too far off to recognize its nature. Are these plains composed of\r\narid sand, as the first astronomer maintained? Or are they nothing but\r\nimmense forests, according to M. Warren de la Rue's opinion, who gives\r\nthe moon an atmosphere, though a very low and a very dense one? That we\r\nshall know by and by. We must affirm nothing until we are in a position\r\nto do so.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"Sea of Clouds\" is rather doubtfully marked out upon the maps. It\r\nis supposed that these vast plains are strewn with blocks of lava from\r\nthe neighbouring volcanoes on its right, Ptolemy, Purbach, Arzachel.\r\nBut the projectile was advancing, and sensibly nearing it. Soon there\r\nappeared the heights which bound this sea at this northern limit. Before\r\nthem rose a mountain radiant with beauty, the top of which seemed lost\r\nin an eruption of solar rays.\r\n\r\n\"That is—?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Copernicus,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Let us see Copernicus.\"\r\n\r\nThis mount situated in 9° north latitude and 20° east longitude,\r\nrose to a height of 10,600 feet above the surface of the moon. It is\r\nquite visible from the earth; and astronomers can study it with ease,\r\nparticularly during the phase between the last quarter and the new\r\nmoon, because then the shadows are thrown lengthways from east to west,\r\nallowing them to measure the heights.\r\n\r\nThis Copernicus forms the most important of the radiating system, situated\r\nin the southern hemisphere, according to Tycho Brahé. It rises isolated\r\nlike a gigantic lighthouse on that portion of the Sea of Clouds, which is\r\nbounded by the \"Sea of Tempests,\" thus lighting by its splendid rays two\r\noceans at a time. It was a sight without an equal, those long luminous\r\ntrains, so dazzling in the full moon, and which, passing the boundary\r\nchain on the north, extends to the \"Sea of Rains.\" At one o'clock of the\r\nterrestrial morning, the projectile, like a balloon borne into space,\r\noverlooked the top of this superb mountain. Barbicane could recognize\r\nperfectly its chief features. Copernicus is comprised in the series of\r\nringed mountains of the first order, in the division of great circles.\r\nLike Kepler and Aristarchus, which overlook the Ocean of Tempests,\r\nsometimes it appeared like a brilliant point through the cloudy light,\r\nand was taken for a volcano in activity. But it is only an extinct\r\none,—like all on that side of the moon. Its circumference showed a\r\ndiameter of about twenty-two leagues. The glasses discovered traces of\r\nstratification produced by successive eruptions, and the neighbourhood\r\nwas strewn with volcanic remains which still choked some of the craters.\r\n\r\n\"There exist,\" said Barbicane, \"several kinds of circles on the surface\r\nof the moon, and it is easy to see that Copernicus belongs to the\r\nradiating class. If we were nearer, we should see the cones bristling on\r\nthe inside, which in former times were so many fiery mouths. A curious\r\narrangement, and one without an exception on the lunar disc, is that\r\nthe interior surface of these circles is the reverse of the exterior,\r\nand contrary to the form taken by terrestrial craters. It follows, then,\r\nthat the general curve of the bottom of these circles gives a sphere of\r\na smaller diameter than that of the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why this peculiar disposition?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"We do not know,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"What splendid radiation!\" said Michel. \"One could hardly see a finer\r\nspectacle, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you say, then,\" replied Barbicane, \"if chance should bear us\r\ntowards the southern hemisphere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should say that it was still more beautiful,\" retorted Michel\r\nArdan.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the projectile hung perpendicularly over the circle. The\r\ncircumference of Copernicus formed almost a perfect circle, and its steep\r\nescarpments were clearly defined. They could even distinguish a second\r\nringed enclosure. Around spread a greyish plain, of a wild aspect, on\r\nwhich every relief was marked in yellow. At the bottom of the circle,\r\nas if enclosed in a jewel case, sparkled for one instant two or three\r\neruptive cones, like enormous dazzling gems. Towards the north the\r\nescarpments were lowered by a depression which would probably have given\r\naccess to the interior of the crater.\r\n\r\nIn passing over the surrounding plains, Barbicane noticed a great number\r\nof less important mountains; and among others a little ringed one called\r\nGuy Lussac, the breadth of which measured twelve miles.\r\n\r\nTowards the south, the plain was very flat, without one elevation,\r\nwithout one projection. Towards the north, on the contrary, till where it\r\nwas bounded by the Sea of Storms it resembled a liquid surface agitated\r\nby a storm, of which the hills and hollows formed a succession of waves\r\nsuddenly congealed. Over the whole of this, and in all directions, lay\r\nthe luminous lines, all converging to the summit of Copernicus.\r\n\r\nThe travellers discussed the origin of these strange rays; but they could\r\nnot determine their nature any more than terrestrial observers.\r\n\r\n\"But why,\" said Nicholl, \"should not these rays be simply spurs of\r\nmountains which reflect more vividly the light of the sun?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Barbicane; \"if it was so, under certain conditions of the\r\nmoon, these ridges would cast shadows, and they do not cast any.\"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, these rays only appeared when the orb of day was in opposition\r\nto the moon, and disappeared as soon as its rays became oblique.\r\n\r\n\"But how have they endeavoured to explain these lines of light?\" asked\r\nMichel; \"for I cannot believe that savants would ever be stranded for\r\nwant of an explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Barbicane; \"Herschel has put forward an opinion, but he\r\ndid not venture to affirm it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. What was the opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"He thought that these rays might be streams of cooled lava which shone\r\nwhen the sun beat straight upon them. It may be so; but nothing can\r\nbe less certain. Besides, if we pass nearer to Tycho, we shall be in a\r\nbetter position to find out the cause of this radiation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"THIS PLAIN WOULD THEN BE NOTHING BUT AN IMMENSE\r\n   CEMETERY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are\r\nat, resembles?\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; with all those pieces of lava lengthened like rockets, it\r\nresembles an immense game of spelikans thrown pell-mell. There wants but\r\nthe hook to pull them out one by one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do be serious,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us be serious,\" replied Michel quietly; \"and instead of\r\nspelikans, let us put bones. This plain would then be nothing but an\r\nimmense cemetery, on which would repose the mortal remains of thousands\r\nof extinct generations. Do you prefer that high-flown comparison?\"\r\n\r\n\"One is as good as the other,\" retorted Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"My word, you are difficult to please,\" answered Michel.\r\n\r\n\"My worthy friend,\" continued the matter-of-fact Barbicane, \"it matters\r\nbut little what it _resembles_, when we do not know what it _is_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well answered,\" exclaimed Michel. \"That will teach me to reason with\r\nsavants.\"\r\n\r\nBut the projectile continued to advance with almost uniform speed around\r\nthe lunar disc. The travellers, we may easily imagine, did not dream of\r\ntaking a moment's rest. Every minute changed the landscape which fled\r\nfrom beneath their gaze. About half-past one o'clock in the morning, they\r\ncaught a glimpse of the tops of another mountain. Barbicane, consulting\r\nhis map, recognized Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\nIt was a ringed mountain 9000 feet high, and one of those circles so\r\nnumerous on this satellite. With regard to this, Barbicane related\r\nKepler's singular opinion on the formation of circles. According to that\r\ncelebrated mathematician, these crater-like cavities had been dug by the\r\nhand of man.\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"For a very natural one,\" replied Barbicane. \"The Selenites might have\r\nundertaken these immense works and dug these enormous holes for a refuge\r\nand shield from the solar rays which beat upon them during fifteen\r\nconsecutive days.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Selenites are not fools,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"A singular idea,\" replied Nicholl; \"but it is probable that Kepler did\r\nnot know the true dimensions of these circles, for the digging of them\r\nwould have been the work of giants quite impossible for the Selenites.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? if weight on the moon's surface is six times less than on the\r\nearth?\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"But if the Selenites are six times smaller?\" retorted Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"And if there are no Selenites?\" added Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThis put an end to the discussion.\r\n\r\nSoon Eratosthenes disappeared under the horizon without the projectile\r\nbeing sufficiently near to allow of close observation. This mountain\r\nseparated the Apennines from the Carpathians. In the lunar orography they\r\nhave discerned some chains of mountains, which are chiefly distributed\r\nover the northern hemisphere. Some, however, occupy certain portions of\r\nthe southern hemisphere also.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock in the morning Barbicane found that they were above the\r\ntwentieth lunar parallel. The distance of the projectile from the moon\r\nwas not more than 600 miles. Barbicane, now perceiving that the projectile\r\nwas steadily approaching the lunar disc, did not despair, if of reaching\r\nher, at least of discovering the secrets of her configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n   LUNAR LANDSCAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past two in the morning, the projectile was over the thirteenth\r\nlunar parallel and at the effective distance of 500 miles, reduced by\r\nthe glasses to five. It still seemed impossible, however, that it could\r\never touch any part of the disc. Its motive speed, comparatively so\r\nmoderate, was inexplicable to President Barbicane. At that distance from\r\nthe moon it must have been considerable, to enable it to bear up against\r\nher attraction. Here was a phenomenon the cause of which escaped them\r\nagain. Besides, time failed them to investigate the cause. All lunar\r\nrelief was defiling under the eyes of the travellers, and they would not\r\nlose a single detail.\r\n\r\nUnder the glasses the disc appeared at the distance of five miles. What\r\nwould an aeronaut, borne to this distance from the earth, distinguish on\r\nits surface? We cannot say, since the greatest ascension has not been\r\nmore than 25,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is an exact description of what Barbicane and his companions\r\nsaw at this height. Large patches of different colours appeared on the\r\ndisc. Selenographers are not agreed upon the nature of these colours.\r\nThere are several, and rather vividly marked. Julius Schmidt pretends\r\nthat, if the terrestrial oceans were dried up, a Selenite observer could\r\nnot distinguish on the globe a greater diversity of shades between the\r\noceans and the continental plains than those on the moon present to a\r\nterrestrial observer. According to him, the colour common to the vast\r\nplains known by the name of \"seas\" is a dark grey mixed with green and\r\nbrown. Some of the large craters present the same appearance. Barbicane\r\nknew this opinion of the German selenographer, an opinion shared by Bœer\r\nand Moedler. Observation has proved that right was on their side, and not\r\non that of some astronomers who admit the existence of only grey on the\r\nmoon's surface. In some parts green was very distinct, such as springs,\r\naccording to Julius Schmidt, from the seas of Serenity and Humours.\r\nBarbicane also noticed large craters, without any interior cones, which\r\nshed a bluish tint similar to the reflection of a sheet of steel freshly\r\npolished. These colours belonged really to the lunar disc, and did not\r\nresult, as some astronomers say, either from the imperfection in the\r\nobjective of the glasses or from the interposition of the terrestrial\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nNot a doubt existed in Barbicane's mind with regard to it, as he observed\r\nit through space, and so could not commit any optical error. He considered\r\nthe establishment of this fact as an acquisition to science. Now, were\r\nthese shades of green, belonging to tropical vegetation, kept up by a\r\nlow dense atmosphere? He could not yet say.\r\n\r\nFarther on, he noticed a reddish tint, quite defined. The same shade had\r\nbefore been observed at the bottom of an isolated enclosure, known by\r\nthe name of Lichtenburg's circle, which is situated near the Hercynian\r\nmountains, on the borders of the moon; but they could not tell the nature\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThey were not more fortunate with regard to another peculiarity of the\r\ndisc, for they could not decide upon the cause of it.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan was watching near the president, when he noticed long\r\nwhite lines, vividly lighted up by the direct rays of the sun. It was\r\na succession of luminous furrows, very different from the radiation of\r\nCopernicus not long before; they ran parallel with each other.\r\n\r\nMichel, with his usual readiness, hastened to exclaim,— \"Look there!\r\ncultivated fields!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"WHAT GIANT OXEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Cultivated fields!\" replied Nicholl, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Ploughed, at all events,\" retorted Michel Ardan; \"but what labourers\r\nthose Selenites must be, and what giant oxen they must harness to their\r\nplough to cut such furrows!\"\r\n\r\n\"They are not furrows,\" said Barbicane; \"they are _rifts_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rifts? stuff!\" replied Michel mildly; \"but what do you mean by 'rifts'\r\nin the scientific world?\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane immediately enlightened his companion as to what he knew about\r\nlunar rifts. He knew that they were a kind of furrow found on every part\r\nof the disc which was not mountainous; that these furrows, generally\r\nisolated, measured from 400 to 500 leagues in length; that their breadth\r\nvaried from 1000 to 1500 yards, and that their borders were strictly\r\nparallel; but he knew nothing more either of their formation or their\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, through his glasses, observed these rifts with great attention.\r\nHe noticed that their borders were formed of steep declivities; they\r\nwere long parallel ramparts, and with some small amount of imagination\r\nhe might have admitted the existence of long lines of fortifications,\r\nraised by Selenite engineers. Of these different rifts some were perfectly\r\nstraight, as if cut by a line; others were slightly curved, though still\r\nkeeping their borders parallel; some crossed each other, some cut through\r\ncraters; here they wound through ordinary cavities, such as Posidonius or\r\nPetavius; there they wound through the seas, such as the Sea of Serenity.\r\n\r\nThese natural accidents naturally excited the imaginations of these\r\nterrestrial astronomers. The first observations had not discovered these\r\nrifts. Neither Hevelius, Cassim, La Hire, nor Herschel seemed to have\r\nknown them. It was Schroeter who in 1789 first drew attention to them.\r\nOthers followed who studied them, as Pastorff, Gruithuysen, Bœer, and\r\nMoedler. At this time their number amounts to seventy; but, if they\r\nhave been counted, their nature has not yet been determined; they are\r\ncertainly not fortifications, any more than they are the ancient beds of\r\ndried-up rivers; for, on one side, the waters, so slight on the moon's\r\nsurface, could never have worn such drains for themselves; and, on the\r\nother, they often cross craters of great elevation.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, allow that Michel Ardan had \"an idea,\" and that,\r\nwithout knowing it, he coincided in that respect with Julius Schmidt.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said he, \"should not these unaccountable appearances be simply\r\nphenomena of vegetation?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Barbicane quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Do not excite yourself, my worthy president,\" replied Michel; \"might it\r\nnot be possible that the dark lines forming that bastion were rows of\r\ntrees regularly placed?\"\r\n\r\n\"You stick to your vegetation, then?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"I like,\" retorted Michel Ardan, \"to explain what you savants cannot\r\nexplain; at least my hypothesis has the advantage of indicating why these\r\nrifts disappear, or seem to disappear, at certain seasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for what reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the reason that the trees become invisible when they lose their\r\nleaves, and visible when they regain them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your explanation is ingenious, my dear companion,\" replied Barbicane,\r\n\"but inadmissible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, so to speak, there are no seasons on the moon's surface, and\r\nthat, consequently, the phenomena of vegetation of which you speak cannot\r\noccur.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the slight obliquity of the lunar axis keeps the sun at an almost\r\nequal height in every latitude. Above the equatorial regions the radiant\r\norb almost invariably occupies the zenith, and does not pass the limits\r\nof the horizon in the polar regions; thus, according to each region,\r\nthere reigns a perpetual winter, spring, summer, or autumn, as in the\r\nplanet Jupiter, whose axis is but little inclined upon its orbit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: HE COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT DESERT BEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat origin do they attribute to these rifts? That is a question difficult\r\nto solve. They are certainly anterior to the formation of craters and\r\ncircles, for several have introduced themselves by breaking through their\r\ncircular ramparts. Thus it may be that, contemporary with the latter\r\ngeological epochs, they are due to the expansion of natural forces.\r\n\r\nBut the projectile had now attained the 40° of lunar lat., at a distance\r\nnot exceeding 400 miles. Through the glasses objects appeared to be only\r\nfour miles distant.\r\n\r\nAt this point, under their feet, rose Mount Helicon, 1520 feet high,\r\nand round about the left rose moderate elevations, enclosing a small\r\nportion of the \"Sea of Rains,\" under the name of the Gulf of Iris. The\r\nterrestrial atmosphere would have to be one hundred and seventy times more\r\ntransparent than it is, to allow astronomers to make perfect observations\r\non the moon's surface; but in the void in which the projectile floated\r\nno fluid interposed itself between the eye of the observer and the\r\nobject observed. And more, Barbicane found himself carried to a greater\r\ndistance than the most powerful telescopes had ever done before, either\r\nthat of Lord Rosse or that of the Rocky Mountains. He was, therefore,\r\nunder extremely favourable conditions for solving that great question\r\nof the habitability of the moon; but the solution still escaped him; he\r\ncould distinguish nothing but desert beds, immense plains, and towards\r\nthe north, arid mountains. Not a work betrayed the hand of man; not a\r\nruin marked his course; not a group of animals was to be seen indicating\r\nlife, even in an inferior degree. In no part was there life, in no part\r\nwas there an appearance of vegetation. Of the three kingdoms which share\r\nthe terrestrial globe between them, one alone was represented on the\r\nlunar and that the mineral.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed!\" said Michel Ardan, a little out of countenance; \"then you\r\nsee no one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Nicholl; \"up to this time not a man, not an animal, not\r\na tree! After all, whether the atmosphere has taken refuge at the bottom\r\nof cavities, in the midst of the circles, or even on the opposite face\r\nof the moon, we cannot decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" added Barbicane, \"even to the most piercing eye a man cannot\r\nbe distinguished farther than three miles and a half off; so that, if\r\nthere are any Selenites, they can see our projectile, but we cannot see\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nTowards four in the morning, at the height of the fiftieth parallel, the\r\ndistance was reduced to 300 miles. To the left ran a line of mountains\r\ncapriciously shaped, lying in the full light. To the right, on the\r\ncontrary, lay a black hollow resembling a vast well, unfathomable and\r\ngloomy, drilled into the lunar soil.\r\n\r\nThis hole was the \"Black Lake;\" it was Pluto, a deep circle which can be\r\nconveniently studied from the earth, between the last quarter and the\r\nnew moon, when the shadows fall from west to east.\r\n\r\nThis black colour is rarely met with on the surface of the satellite. As\r\nyet it has only been recognized in the depths of the circle of Endymion,\r\nto the east of the Cold Sea, in the northern hemisphere, and at the\r\nbottom of Grimaldi's circle, on the equator, towards the eastern border\r\nof the orb.\r\n\r\nPluto is an annular mountain, situated in 51° north latitude, and 9°\r\neast longitude. Its circuit is forty-seven miles long and thirty-two\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nBarbicane regretted that they were not passing directly above this vast\r\nopening. There was an abyss to fathom, perhaps some mysterious phenomenon\r\nto surprise; but the projectile's course could not be altered. They must\r\nrigidly submit. They could not guide a balloon, still less a projectile,\r\nwhen once enclosed within its walls. Towards five in the morning the\r\nnorthern limits of the Sea of Rains was at length passed. The mounts\r\nof Condamine and Fontenelle remained—one on the right, the other on\r\nthe left. That part of the disc beginning with 60° was becoming quite\r\nmountainous. The glasses brought them to within two miles, less than\r\nthat separating the summit of Mont Blanc from the level of the sea. The\r\nwhole region was bristling with spikes and circles. Towards the 60°\r\nPhilolaus stood predominant at a height of 5550 feet with its elliptical\r\ncrater, and seen from this distance, the disc showed a very fantastical\r\nappearance. Landscapes were presented to the eye under very different\r\nconditions from those on the earth, and also very inferior to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe moon having no atmosphere, the consequences arising from the absence\r\nof this gaseous envelope have already been shown. No twilight on her\r\nsurface; night following day and day following night with the suddenness\r\nof a lamp which is extinguished or lighted amidst profound darkness,—no\r\ntransition from cold to heat, the temperature falling in an instant from\r\nboiling point to the cold of space.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of this want of air is that absolute darkness\r\nreigns where the sun's rays do not penetrate. That which on earth is\r\ncalled diffusion of light, that luminous matter which the air holds in\r\nsuspension, which creates the twilight and the daybreak, which produces\r\nthe _umbræ_ and the _penumbræ_, and all the magic of _chiaro-oscuro_,\r\ndoes not exist on the moon. Hence the harshness of contrasts, which only\r\nadmit of two colours, black and white. If a Selenite were to shade his\r\neyes from the sun's rays, the sky would seem absolutely black, and the\r\nstars would shine to him as on the darkest night. Judge of the impression\r\nproduced on Barbicane and his three friends by this strange scene! Their\r\neyes were confused. They could no longer grasp the respective distances\r\nof the different plains. A lunar landscape without the softening of the\r\nphenomena of _chiaro-oscuro_ could not be rendered by an earthly landscape\r\npainter: it would be spots of ink on a white page—nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThis aspect was not altered even when the projectile, at the height of\r\n80°, was only separated from the moon by a distance of fifty miles; nor\r\neven when, at five in the morning, it passed at less than twenty-five\r\nmiles from the mountain of Gioja, a distance reduced by the glasses to\r\na quarter of a mile. It seemed as if the moon might be touched by the\r\nhand! It seemed impossible that, before long, the projectile would not\r\nstrike her, if only at the north pole, the brilliant arch of which was\r\nso distinctly visible on the black sky.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan wanted to open one of the scuttles and throw himself on to\r\nthe moon's surface! A very useless attempt; for if the projectile could\r\nnot attain any point whatever of the satellite, Michel, carried along by\r\nits motion, could not attain it either.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, at six o'clock, the lunar pole appeared. The disc only\r\npresented to the travellers' gaze one half brilliantly lit up, whilst\r\nthe other disappeared in the darkness. Suddenly the projectile passed\r\nthe line of demarcation between intense light and absolute darkness, and\r\nwas plunged in profound night!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n   THE NIGHT OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR HOURS\r\n      AND A HALF.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment when this phenomenon took place so rapidly, the projectile\r\nwas skirting the moon's north pole at less than twenty-five miles\r\ndistance. Some seconds had sufficed to plunge it into the absolute\r\ndarkness of space. The transition was so sudden, without shade, without\r\ngradation of light, without attenuation of the luminous waves, that the\r\norb seemed to have been extinguished by a powerful blow.\r\n\r\n\"Melted, disappeared!\" Michel Ardan exclaimed, aghast.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was neither reflection nor shadow. Nothing more was to be\r\nseen of that disc, formerly so dazzling. The darkness was complete, and\r\nrendered even more so by the rays from the stars. It was \"that blackness\"\r\nin which the lunar nights are insteeped, which last three hundred and\r\nfour hours and a half at each point of the disc, a long night resulting\r\nfrom the equality of the translatory and rotary movements of the moon. The\r\nprojectile, immerged in the conical shadow of the satellite, experienced\r\nthe action of the solar rays no more than any of its invisible points.\r\n\r\nIn the interior, the obscurity was complete. They could not see each\r\nother. Hence the necessity of dispelling the darkness. However desirous\r\nBarbicane might be to husband the gas, the reserve of which was small,\r\nhe was obliged to ask from it a fictitious light, an expensive brilliancy\r\nwhich the sun then refused.\r\n\r\n\"Devil take the radiant orb!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"which forces us\r\nto expend gas, instead of giving us his rays gratuitously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not let us accuse the sun,\" said Nicholl, \"it is not his fault, but\r\nthat of the moon, which has come and placed herself like a screen between\r\nus and it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the sun!\" continued Michel.\r\n\r\n\"It is the moon!\" retorted Nicholl.\r\n\r\nAn idle dispute, which Barbicane put an end to by saying,—\r\n\r\n\"My friends, it is neither the fault of the sun nor of the moon; it is\r\nthe fault of the _projectile_, which, instead of rigidly following its\r\ncourse, has awkwardly missed it. To be more just, it is the fault of that\r\nunfortunate meteor which has so deplorably altered our first direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"as the matter is settled, let us have\r\nbreakfast. After a whole night of watching it is fair to build ourselves\r\nup a little.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal meeting with no contradiction, Michel prepared the repast\r\nin a few minutes. But they ate for eating's sake, they drank without\r\ntoasts, without hurrahs. The bold travellers being borne away into gloomy\r\nspace, without their accustomed cortège of rays, felt a vague uneasiness\r\nat their hearts. The \"strange\" shadow so dear to Victor Hugo's pen bound\r\nthem on all sides. But they talked over the interminable night of three\r\nhundred and fifty-four hours and a half, nearly fifteen days, which the\r\nlaw of physics has imposed on the inhabitants of the moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane gave his friends some explanation of the causes and the\r\nconsequences of this curious phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"Curious indeed,\" said they; \"for, if each hemisphere of the moon is\r\ndeprived of solar light for fifteen days, that above which we now float\r\ndoes not even enjoy during its long night any view of the earth so\r\nbeautifully lit up. In a word she has no moon (applying this designation\r\nto our globe) but on one side of her disc. Now if this were the case\r\nwith the earth,—if, for example, Europe never saw the moon, and she\r\nwas only visible at the Antipodes, imagine to yourself the astonishment\r\nof a European on arriving in Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"IT IS THE FAULT OF THE MOON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They would make the voyage for nothing but to see the moon!\" replied\r\nMichel.\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\" continued Barbicane, \"that astonishment is reserved for the\r\nSelenites who inhabit the face of the moon opposite to the earth, a face\r\nwhich is ever invisible to our countrymen of the terrestrial globe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And which we should have seen,\" added Nicholl, \"if we had arrived here\r\nwhen the moon was new, that is to say fifteen days later.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will add, to make amends,\" continued Barbicane, \"that the inhabitants\r\nof the visible face are singularly favoured by nature, to the detriment\r\nof their brethren on the invisible face. The latter, as you see, have\r\ndark nights of 354 hours, without one single ray to break the darkness.\r\nThe other, on the contrary, when the sun which has given its light for\r\nfifteen days sinks below the horizon, see a splendid orb rise on the\r\nopposite horizon. It is the earth, which is thirteen times greater than\r\nthat diminutive moon that we know;—the earth which develops itself\r\nat a diameter of two degrees, and which sheds a light thirteen times\r\ngreater than that qualified by atmospheric strata—the earth which only\r\ndisappears at the moment when the sun reappears in its turn!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicely worded!\" said Michel, \"slightly academical perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"It follows, then,\" continued Barbicane, without knitting his brows,\r\n\"that the visible face of the disc must be very agreeable to inhabit,\r\nsince it always looks on either the sun when the moon is full, or on the\r\nearth when the moon is new.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Nicholl, \"that advantage must be well compensated by the\r\ninsupportable heat which the light brings with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The inconvenience, in that respect, is the same for the two faces, for\r\nthe earth's light is evidently deprived of heat. But the invisible face\r\nis still more searched by the heat than the visible face. I say that for\r\n_you_, Nicholl, because Michel will probably not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" continued Barbicane, \"when the invisible face receives at\r\nthe same time light and heat from the sun, it is because the moon is\r\nnew; that is to say, she is situated between the sun and the earth. It\r\nfollows, then, considering the position which she occupies in opposition\r\nwhen full, that she is nearer to the sun by twice her distance from the\r\nearth; and that distance may be estimated at the two-hundredth part of\r\nthat which separates the sun from the earth, or in round numbers 400,000\r\nmiles. So that invisible face is so much nearer to the sun when she\r\nreceives its rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" continued Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"One moment,\" said Michel, interrupting his grave companion.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask to be allowed to continue the explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"To prove that I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get along with you,\" said Barbicane, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Michel, imitating the tone and gestures of the\r\npresident, \"on the contrary, when the visible face of the moon is lit by\r\nthe sun, it is because the moon is full, that is to say, opposite the\r\nsun with regard to the earth. The distance separating it from the radiant\r\norb is then increased in round numbers to 400,000 miles, and the heat\r\nwhich she receives must be a little less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well said!\" exclaimed Barbicane. \"Do you know, Michel, that, for\r\nan amateur, you are intelligent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Michel coolly, \"we are all so on the Boulevard des\r\nItaliens.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane gravely clasped the hand of his amiable companion, and continued\r\nto enumerate the advantages reserved for the inhabitants of the visible\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAmongst others, he mentioned eclipses of the sun, which only take place\r\non this side of the lunar disc; since, in order that they may take place,\r\nit is necessary for the moon to be _in opposition_. These eclipses,\r\ncaused by the interposition of the earth between the moon and the sun,\r\ncan last _two hours_; during which time, by reason of the rays refracted\r\nby its atmosphere, the terrestrial globe can appear as nothing but a\r\nblack point upon the sun.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Nicholl, \"there is a hemisphere, that invisible hemisphere\r\nwhich is very ill supplied, very ill treated, by nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" replied Michel; \"if we ever become Selenites, we will\r\ninhabit the visible face. I like the light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless, by any chance,\" answered Nicholl, \"the atmosphere should be\r\ncondensed on the other side, as certain astronomers pretend.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be a consideration,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, the observers returned to their post. They tried to\r\nsee through the darkened scuttles by extinguishing all light in the\r\nprojectile; but not a luminous spark made its way through the darkness.\r\n\r\nOne inexplicable fact preoccupied Barbicane. Why, having passed within\r\nsuch a short distance of the moon—about twenty-five miles only—why\r\nthe projectile had not fallen? If its speed had been enormous, he could\r\nhave understood that the fall would not have taken place; but, with\r\na relatively moderate speed, that resistance to the moon's attraction\r\ncould not be explained. Was the projectile under some foreign influence?\r\nDid some kind of body retain it in the ether? It was quite evident that\r\nit could never reach any point of the moon. Whither was it going? Was\r\nit going farther from, or nearing, the disc? Was it being borne in that\r\nprofound darkness through the infinity of space? How could they learn,\r\nhow calculate, in the midst of this night? All these questions made\r\nBarbicane uneasy, but he could not solve them.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the invisible orb was _there_, perhaps only some few miles\r\noff; but neither he nor his companions could see it. If there was any\r\nnoise on its surface, they could not hear it. Air, that medium of sound,\r\nwas wanting to transmit the groanings of that moon which the Arabic\r\nlegends call \"a man already half granite, and still breathing.\"\r\n\r\nOne must allow that that was enough to aggravate the most patient\r\nobservers. It was just that unknown hemisphere which was stealing from\r\ntheir sight. That face which fifteen days sooner, or fifteen days later,\r\nhad been, or would be, splendidly illuminated by the solar rays, was then\r\nbeing lost in utter darkness. In fifteen days where would the projectile\r\nbe? Who could say? Where would the chances of conflicting attractions\r\nhave drawn it to? The disappointment of the travellers in the midst of\r\nthis utter darkness may be imagined. All observation of the lunar disc\r\nwas impossible. The constellations alone claimed all their attention;\r\nand we must allow that the astronomers Faye, Charconac, and Secchi, never\r\nfound themselves in circumstances so favourable for their\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, nothing could equal the splendour of this starry world, bathed\r\nin limpid ether. Its diamonds set in the heavenly vault sparkled\r\nmagnificently. The eye took in the firmament from the Southern Cross to\r\nthe North Star, those two constellations which in 12,000 years, by reason\r\nof the succession of equinoxes, will resign their part of polar stars,\r\nthe one to Canopus in the southern hemisphere, the other to Wega in\r\nthe northern. Imagination loses itself in this sublime Infinity, amidst\r\nwhich the projectile was gravitating, like a new star created by the\r\nhand of man. From a natural cause, these constellations shone with a soft\r\nlustre; they did not _twinkle_, for there was no atmosphere which, by\r\nthe intervention of its layers unequally dense and of different degrees\r\nof humidity, produces this scintillation. These stars were soft eyes,\r\nlooking out into the dark night, amidst the silence of absolute\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: NOTHING COULD EQUAL THE SPLENDOR OF THIS STARRY WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong did the travellers stand mute, watching the constellated firmament,\r\nupon which the moon, like a vast screen, made an enormous black hole.\r\nBut at length a painful sensation drew them from their watchings. This\r\nwas an intense cold, which soon covered the inside of the glass of the\r\nscuttles with a thick coating of ice. The sun was no longer warming the\r\nprojectile with its direct rays, and thus it was losing the heat stored\r\nup in its walls by degrees. This heat was rapidly evaporating into space\r\nby radiation, and a considerably lower temperature was the result. The\r\nhumidity of the interior was changed into ice upon contact with the\r\nglass, preventing all observation.\r\n\r\nNicholl consulted the thermometer, and saw that it had fallen to seventeen\r\ndegrees (centigrade) below zero.* So that, in spite of the many reasons\r\nfor economizing, Barbicane, after having begged light from the gas, was\r\nalso obliged to beg for heat. The projectile's low temperature was no\r\nlonger endurable. Its tenants would have been frozen to death.\r\n\r\n*1° Fahr. (Ed.)\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" observed Michel, \"we cannot reasonably complain of the monotony\r\nof our journey! What variety we have had, at least in temperature. Now\r\nwe are blinded with light and saturated with heat, like the Indians of\r\nthe Pampas! now plunged into profound darkness, amidst the cold like the\r\nEsquimauxs of the north pole. No, indeed! we have no right to complain;\r\nnature does wonders in our honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" asked Nicholl, \"what is the temperature outside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly that of the planetary space,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Michel Ardan, \"would not this be the time to make the\r\nexperiment which we dared not attempt when we were drowned in the sun's\r\nrays?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is now or never,\" replied Barbicane, \"for we are in a good position\r\nto verify the temperature of space, and see if Fourier or Pouillet's\r\ncalculations are exact.\"\r\n\r\n\"In any case it is cold,\" said Michel. \"See! the steam of the interior\r\nis condensing on the glasses of the scuttles. If the fall continues, the\r\nvapour of our breath will fall in snow around us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us prepare a thermometer,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine that an ordinary thermometer would afford no result under\r\nthe circumstances in which this instrument was to be exposed. The mercury\r\nwould have been frozen in its ball, as below forty-two degrees below\r\nzero* it is no longer liquid. But Barbicane had furnished himself with\r\na spirit thermometer on Wafferdin's system, which gives the minima of\r\nexcessively low temperatures.\r\n\r\n*-44° Fahr.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning the experiment, this instrument was compared with an\r\nordinary one, and then Barbicane prepared to use it.\r\n\r\n\"How shall we set about it?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is easier,\" replied Michel Ardan, who was never at a loss.\r\n\"We open the scuttle rapidly; throw out the instrument; it follows the\r\nprojectile with exemplary docility; and a quarter of an hour after, draw\r\nit in.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the hand?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"With the hand,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, my friend, do not expose yourself,\" answered Barbicane, \"for\r\nthe hand that you draw in again will be nothing but a stump frozen and\r\ndeformed by the frightful cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will feel as if you had had a terrible burn, like that of iron at\r\na white heat; for whether the heat leaves our bodies briskly or enters\r\nbriskly, it is exactly the same thing. Besides, I am not at all certain\r\nthat the objects we have thrown out are still following us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Because, if we are passing through an atmosphere of the slightest\r\ndensity, these objects will be retarded. Again, the darkness prevents\r\nour seeing if they still float around us. But in order not to expose\r\nourselves to the loss of our thermometer, we will fasten it, and we can\r\nthen more easily pull it back again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"THE VAPOR OF OUR BREATH WILL FALL IN SNOW\r\n   AROUND US.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane's advice was followed. Through the scuttle rapidly opened,\r\nNicholl threw out the instrument which was held by a short cord, so that\r\nit might be more easily drawn up. The scuttle had not been opened more\r\nthan a second, but that second had sufficed to let in a most intense\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"it is cold enough to freeze a white\r\nbear.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane waited until half an hour had elapsed, which was more than time\r\nenough to allow the instrument to fall to the level of the surrounding\r\ntemperature. Then it was rapidly pulled in.\r\n\r\nBarbicane calculated the quantity of spirits of wine overflowed into the\r\nlittle phial soldered to the lower part of the instrument, and said,—\r\n\r\n\"A hundred and forty degrees centigrade* below zero!\"\r\n\r\n*-218° Fahr. (Ed.)\r\n\r\nM. Pouillet was right and Fourier wrong. That was the undoubted temperature\r\nof the starry space. Such is, perhaps, that of the lunar continents, when\r\nthe orb of night has lost by radiation all the heat which fifteen days\r\nof sun have poured into her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n   HYPERBOLA OR PARABOLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may, perhaps, be astonished to find Barbicane and his companions so\r\nlittle occupied with the future reserved for them in their metal prison\r\nwhich was bearing them through the infinity of space. Instead of asking\r\nwhere they were going, they passed their time making experiments, as if\r\nthey had been quietly installed in their own study.\r\n\r\nWe might answer that men so strong-minded were above such anxieties—that\r\nthey did not trouble themselves about such trifles—and that they had\r\nsomething else to do than to occupy their minds with the future.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that they were not masters of their projectile; they could\r\nneither check its course, nor alter its direction.\r\n\r\nA sailor can change the head of his ship as he pleases; an aeronaut can\r\ngive a vertical motion to his balloon. They, on the contrary, had no power\r\nover their vehicle. Every maneuver was forbidden. Hence the inclination\r\nto let things alone, or as the sailors say, \"let her run.\"\r\n\r\nWhere did they find themselves at this moment, at eight o'clock in the\r\nmorning of the day called upon the earth the 6th of December? Very\r\ncertainly in the neighbourhood of the moon, and even near enough for her\r\nto look to them like an enormous black screen upon the firmament. As to\r\nthe distance which separated them, it was impossible to estimate it. The\r\nprojectile, held by some unaccountable force, had been within four miles\r\nof grazing the satellite's north pole.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: A DISCUSSION AROSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since entering the cone of shadow these last two hours, had the\r\ndistance increased or diminished? Every point of mark was wanting by\r\nwhich to estimate both the direction and the speed of the projectile.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was rapidly leaving the disc, so that it would soon quit the\r\npure shadow. Perhaps, again, on the other hand, it might be nearing it\r\nso much that in a short time it might strike some high point on the\r\ninvisible hemisphere, which would doubtlessly have ended the journey much\r\nto the detriment of the travellers.\r\n\r\nA discussion arose on this subject, and Michel Ardan, always ready with\r\nan explanation, gave it as his opinion that the projectile, held by the\r\nlunar attraction, would end by falling on the surface of the terrestrial\r\nglobe like an aërolite.\r\n\r\n\"First of all, my friend,\" answered Barbicane, \"every aërolite does not\r\nfall to the earth; it is only a small proportion which do so; and if we\r\nhad passed into an aërolite, it does not necessarily follow that we\r\nshould ever reach the surface of the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how if we get near enough?\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Pure mistake,\" replied Barbicane. \"Have you not seen shooting stars rush\r\nthrough the sky by thousands at certain seasons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, these stars, or rather corpuscules, only shine when they are\r\nheated by gliding over the atmospheric layers. Now, if they enter the\r\natmosphere, they pass at least within forty miles of the earth, but they\r\nseldom fall upon it. The same with our projectile. It may approach very\r\nnear to the moon, and yet not fall upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then,\" asked Michel, \"I shall be curious to know how our erring\r\nvehicle will act in space?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see but two hypotheses,\" replied Barbicane, after some moments'\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"The projectile has the choice between two mathematical curves, and it\r\nwill follow one or the other according to the speed with which it is\r\nanimated, and which at this moment I cannot estimate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nicholl, \"it will follow either a parabola or a hyperbola.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Barbicane. \"With a certain speed it will assume the\r\nparabola, and with a greater the hyperbola.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like those grand words,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan; \"one knows directly\r\nwhat they mean. And pray what is your parabola, if you please?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" answered the captain, \"the parabola is a curve of the\r\nsecond order, the result of the section of a cone intersected by a plane\r\nparallel to one of its sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! ah!\" said Michel, in a satisfied tone.\r\n\r\n\"It is very nearly,\" continued Nicholl, \"the course described by a bomb\r\nlaunched from a mortar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect! And the hyperbola?\"\r\n\r\n\"The hyperbola, Michel, is a curve of the second order, produced by the\r\nintersection of a conic surface and a plane parallel to its axis, and\r\nconstitutes two branches separated one from the other, both tending\r\nindefinitely in the two directions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan in a serious tone, as if they\r\nhad told him of some serious event. \"What I particularly like in your\r\ndefinition of the hyperbola (I was going to say hyperblague) is that it\r\nis still more obscure than the word you pretend to define.\"\r\n\r\nNicholl and Barbicane cared little for Michel Ardan's fun. They were deep\r\nin a scientific discussion. What curve would the projectile follow? was\r\ntheir hobby. One maintained the hyperbola, the other the parabola. They\r\ngave each other reasons bristling with _x_. Their arguments were couched\r\nin language which made Michel jump. The discussion was hot, and neither\r\nwould give up his chosen curve to his adversary.\r\n\r\nThis scientific dispute lasted so long that it made Michel very impatient.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen cosines, will you cease to throw parabolas and hyperbolas\r\nat each other's heads? I want to understand the only interesting question\r\nin the whole affair. We shall follow one or other of these curves? Good.\r\nBut where will they lead us to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"How, nowhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Evidently,\" said Barbicane, \"they are open curves, which may be prolonged\r\nindefinitely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, savants!\" cried Michel; \"and what are either the one or the other\r\nto us from the moment we know that they equally lead us into infinite\r\nspace?\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not forbear smiling. They had just been\r\ncreating \"art for art's sake.\" Never had so idle a question been raised\r\nat such an inopportune moment. The sinister truth remained that, whether\r\nhyperbolically or parabolically borne away, the projectile would never\r\nagain meet either the earth or the moon.\r\n\r\nWhat would become of these bold travellers in the immediate future? If\r\nthey did not die of hunger, if they did not die of thirst, in some days,\r\nwhen the gas failed, they would die from want of air, unless the cold\r\nhad killed them first. Still, important as it was to economize the gas,\r\nthe excessive lowness of the surrounding temperature obliged them to\r\nconsume a certain quantity. Strictly speaking, they could do without its\r\n_light_, but not without its _heat_. Fortunately the caloric generated by\r\nReiset's and Regnaut's apparatus raised the temperature of the interior\r\nof the projectile a little, and without much expenditure they were able\r\nto keep it bearable.\r\n\r\nBut observations had now become very difficult. The dampness of the\r\nprojectile was condensed on the windows and congealed immediately. This\r\ncloudiness had to be dispersed continually. In any case they might hope\r\nto be able to discover some phenomena of the highest interest.\r\n\r\nBut up to this time the disc remained dumb and dark. It did not answer\r\nthe multiplicity of questions put by these ardent minds; a matter which\r\ndrew this reflection from Michel, apparently a just one,—\r\n\r\n\"If ever we begin this journey over again, we shall do well to choose\r\nthe time when the moon is at the full.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Nicholl, \"that circumstance will be more favourable.\r\nI allow that the moon, immersed in the sun's rays, will not be visible\r\nduring the transit, but instead we should see the earth, which would\r\nbe full. And what is more, if we were drawn round the moon, as at this\r\nmoment, we should at least have the advantage of seeing the invisible\r\npart of her disc magnificently lit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, Nicholl,\" replied Michel Ardan. \"What do you think, Barbicane?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think this,\" answered the grave president: \"If ever we begin this\r\njourney again, we shall start at the same time and under the same\r\nconditions. Suppose we had attained our end, would it not have been\r\nbetter to have found continents in broad daylight than a country plunged\r\nin utter darkness? Would not our first installation have been made under\r\nbetter circumstances? Yes, evidently. As to the _invisible_ side, we\r\ncould have visited it in our exploring expeditions on the lunar globe.\r\nSo that the time of the full moon was well chosen. But we ought to have\r\narrived at the end; and in order to have so arrived, we ought to have\r\nsuffered no deviation on the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to say to that,\" answered Michel Ardan. \"Here is, however,\r\na good opportunity lost of observing the other side of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nBut the projectile was now describing in the shadow that incalculable\r\ncourse which no sight-mark would allow them to ascertain. Had its\r\ndirection been altered, either by the influence of the lunar attraction,\r\nor by the action of some unknown star? Barbicane could not say. But\r\na change had taken place in the relative position of the vehicle; and\r\nBarbicane verified it about four in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe change consisted in this, that the base of the projectile had\r\nturned towards the moon's surface, and was so held by a perpendicular\r\npassing through its axis. The attraction, that is to say the _weight_,\r\nhad brought about this alteration. The heaviest part of the projectile\r\ninclined towards the invisible disc as if it would fall upon it.\r\n\r\nWas it falling? Were the travellers attaining that much desired end? No.\r\nAnd the observation of a sign-point, quite inexplicable in itself, showed\r\nBarbicane that his projectile was not nearing the moon, and that it had\r\nshifted by following an almost concentric curve.\r\n\r\nThis point of mark was a luminous brightness, which Nicholl sighted\r\nsuddenly, on the limit of the horizon formed by the black disc. This\r\npoint could not be confounded with a star. It was a reddish incandescence\r\nwhich increased by degrees, a decided proof that the projectile was\r\nshifting towards it and not falling normally on the surface of the moon.\r\n\r\n\"A volcano! it is a volcano in action!\" cried Nicholl; \"a disembowelling\r\nof the interior fires of the moon! That world is not quite extinguished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, an eruption,\" replied Barbicane, who was carefully studying the\r\nphenomenon through his night glass. \"What should it be, if not a volcano?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, then,\" said Michel Ardan, \"in order to maintain that combustion,\r\nthere must be air. So an atmosphere _does_ surround that part of the\r\nmoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Perhaps_ so,\" replied Barbicane, \"but not necessarily. The volcano,\r\nby the decomposition of certain substances, can provide its own oxygen,\r\nand thus throw flames into space. It seems to me that the deflagration,\r\nby the intense brilliancy of the substances in combustion, is produced\r\nin pure oxygen. We must not be in a hurry to proclaim the existence of\r\na lunar atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nThe fiery mountain must have been situated about the 45° south latitude\r\non the invisible part of the disc; but, to Barbicane's great displeasure,\r\nthe curve which the projectile was describing was taking it far from\r\nthe point indicated by the eruption. Thus he could not determine its\r\nnature exactly. Half an hour after being sighted, this luminous point\r\nhad disappeared behind the dark horizon; but the verification of this\r\nphenomenon was of considerable consequence in their selenographic studies.\r\nIt proved that all heat had not yet disappeared from the bowels of this\r\nglobe; and where heat exists, who can affirm that the vegetable kingdom,\r\nnay, even the animal kingdom itself, has not up to this time resisted\r\nall destructive influences? The existence of this volcano in eruption,\r\nunmistakably seen by these earthly savants, would doubtless give rise\r\nto many theories favourable to the grave question of the habitability of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane allowed himself to be carried away by these reflections. He\r\nforgot himself in a deep reverie in which the mysterious destiny of the\r\nlunar world was uppermost. He was seeking to combine together the facts\r\nobserved up to that time, when a new incident recalled him briskly to\r\nreality. This incident was more than a cosmical phenomenon; it was a\r\nthreatened danger, the consequences of which might be disastrous in the\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of the ether, in the profound darkness, an\r\nenormous mass appeared. It was like a moon, but an incandescent moon\r\nwhose brilliancy was all the more intolerable as it cut sharply on the\r\nfrightful darkness of space. This mass, of a circular form, threw a\r\nlight which filled the projectile. The forms of Barbicane, Nicholl, and\r\nMichel Ardan, bathed in its white sheets, assumed that livid spectral\r\nappearance which physicians produce with the fictitious light of alcohol\r\nimpregnated with salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: A PREY TO FRIGHTFUL TERROR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" cried Michel Ardan, \"we are hideous. What is that\r\nill-conditioned moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"A meteor,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"A meteor burning in space?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThis shooting globe suddenly appearing in shadow at a distance of at most\r\n200 miles, ought, according to Barbicane, to have a diameter of 2000\r\nyards. It advanced at a speed of about one mile and a half per second.\r\nIt cut the projectile's path and must reach it in some minutes. As it\r\napproached it grew to enormous proportions.\r\n\r\nImagine, if possible, the situation of the travellers! It is impossible\r\nto describe it. In spite of their courage, their _sang-froid_, their\r\ncarelessness of danger, they were mute, motionless with stiffened limbs,\r\na prey to frightful terror. Their projectile, the course of which they\r\ncould not alter, was rushing straight on this ignited mass, more intense\r\nthan the open mouth of an oven. It seemed as though they were being\r\nprecipitated towards an abyss of fire.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had seized the hands of his two companions, and all three\r\nlooked through their half-open eyelids upon that asteroid heated to a\r\nwhite heat. If thought was not destroyed within them, if their brains\r\nstill worked amidst all this awe, they must have given themselves up for\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes after the sudden appearance of the meteor (to them two\r\ncenturies of anguish) the projectile seemed almost about to strike it,\r\nwhen the globe of fire burst like a bomb, but without making any noise\r\nin that void where sound, which is but the agitation of the layers of\r\nair, could not be generated.\r\n\r\nNicholl uttered a cry, and he and his companions rushed to the scuttle.\r\nWhat a sight! What pen can describe it? What palette is rich enough in\r\ncolours to reproduce so magnificent a spectacle?\r\n\r\nIt was like the opening of a crater, like the scattering of an immense\r\nconflagration. Thousands of luminous fragments lit up and irradiated\r\nspace with their fires. Every size, every colour, was there intermingled.\r\nThere were rays of yellow and pale yellow, red, green, grey—a crown\r\nof fireworks of all colours. Of the enormous and much-dreaded globe\r\nthere remained nothing but these fragments carried in all directions,\r\nnow become asteroids in their turn, some flaming like a sword, some\r\nsurrounded by a whitish cloud, and others leaving behind them trains of\r\nbrilliant cosmical dust.\r\n\r\nThese incandescent blocks crossed and struck each other, scattering\r\nstill smaller fragments, some of which struck the projectile. Its left\r\nscuttle was even cracked by a violent shock. It seemed to be floating\r\namidst a hail of howitzer shells, the smallest of which might destroy it\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nThe light which saturated the ether was so wonderfully intense, that\r\nMichel, drawing Barbicane and Nicholl to his window, exclaimed, \"The\r\ninvisible moon, visible at last!\"\r\n\r\nAnd through a luminous emanation, which lasted some seconds, the whole\r\nthree caught a glimpse of that mysterious disc which the eye of man now\r\nsaw for the first time. What could they distinguish at a distance which\r\nthey could not estimate? Some lengthened bands along the disc, real clouds\r\nformed in the midst of a very confined atmosphere, from which emerged\r\nnot only all the mountains, but also projections of less importance; its\r\ncircles, its yawning craters, as capriciously placed as on the visible\r\nsurface. Then immense spaces, no longer arid plains, but real seas,\r\noceans, widely distributed, reflecting on their liquid surface all the\r\ndazzling magic of the fires of space; and, lastly, on the surface of the\r\ncontinents, large dark masses, looking like immense forests under the\r\nrapid illumination of a brilliance.\r\n\r\nWas it an illusion, a mistake, an optical illusion? Could they give a\r\nscientific assent to an observation so superficially obtained? Dared\r\nthey pronounce upon the question of its habitability after so slight a\r\nglimpse of the invisible disc?\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: WHAT A SIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the lightnings in space subsided by degrees; its accidental\r\nbrilliancy died away; the asteroids dispersed in different directions\r\nand were extinguished in the distance. The ether returned to its\r\naccustomed darkness; the stars, eclipsed for a moment, again twinkled in\r\nthe firmament, and the disc, so hastily discerned, was again buried in\r\nimpenetrable night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n   THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe projectile had just escaped a terrible danger, and a very unforeseen\r\none. Who would have thought of such a rencontre with meteors? These\r\nerring bodies might create serious perils for the travellers. They were\r\nto them so many sandbanks upon that sea of ether which, less fortunate\r\nthan sailors, they could not escape. But did these adventurers complain\r\nof space? No, not since nature had given them the splendid sight of a\r\ncosmical meteor bursting from expansion, since this inimitable firework,\r\nwhich no Ruggieri could imitate, had lit up for some seconds the invisible\r\nglory of the moon. In that flash, continents, seas, and forests had\r\nbecome visible to them. Did an atmosphere, then, bring to this unknown\r\nface its life-giving atoms? Questions still insoluble, and for ever\r\nclosed against human curiosity!\r\n\r\nIt was then half past three in the afternoon. The projectile was\r\nfollowing its curvilinear direction round the moon. Had its course been\r\nagain altered by the meteor? It was to be feared so. But the projectile\r\nmust describe a curve unalterably determined by the laws of mechanical\r\nreasoning. Barbicane was inclined to believe that this curve would be\r\nrather a parabola than a hyperbola. But admitting the parabola, the\r\nprojectile must quickly have passed through the cone of shadow projected\r\ninto space opposite the sun. This cone, indeed, is very narrow, the\r\nangular diameter of the moon being so little when compared with the\r\ndiameter of the orb of day; and up to this time the projectile had\r\nbeen floating in this deep shadow. Whatever had been its speed (and it\r\ncould not have been insignificant) its period of occultation continued.\r\nThat was evident, but perhaps that would not have been the case in a\r\nsupposed rigidly parabolical trajectory,—a new problem which tormented\r\nBarbicane's brain, imprisoned as he was in a circle of unknowns which he\r\ncould not unravel.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"THE SUN!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither of the travellers thought of taking an instant's repose. Each\r\none watched for an unexpected fact, which might throw some new light on\r\ntheir uranographic studies. About five o'clock, Michel Ardan distributed,\r\nunder the name of dinner, some pieces of bread and cold meat, which were\r\nquickly swallowed without either of them abandoning their scuttle, the\r\nglass of which was incessantly encrusted by the condensation of vapour.\r\n\r\nAbout forty-five minutes past five in the evening, Nicholl, armed with\r\nhis glass, sighted towards the southern border of the moon, and in the\r\ndirection followed by the projectile, some bright points cut upon the\r\ndark shield of the sky. They looked like a succession of sharp points\r\nlengthened into a tremulous line. They were very bright. Such appeared\r\nthe terminal line of the moon when in one of her octants.\r\n\r\nThey could not be mistaken. It was no longer a simple meteor. This\r\nluminous ridge had neither colour nor motion. Nor was it a volcano in\r\neruption. And Barbicane did not hesitate to pronounce upon it.\r\n\r\n\"The sun!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"What! the sun?\" answered Nicholl and Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friends, it is the radiant orb itself lighting up the summit\r\nof the mountains situated on the southern borders of the moon. We are\r\nevidently nearing the south pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"After having passed the north pole,\" replied Michel. \"We have made the\r\ncircuit of our satellite, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my good Michel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, no more hyperbolas, no more parabolas, no more open curves to\r\nfear?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but a _closed_ curve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is called—\"\r\n\r\n\"An ellipse. Instead of losing itself in interplanetary space, it is\r\nprobable that the projectile will describe an elliptical orbit around\r\nthe moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"And that it will become _her_ satellite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moon of the moon!\" cried Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Only, I would have you observe, my worthy friend,\" replied Barbicane,\r\n\"that we are none the less lost for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in another manner, and much more pleasantly,\" answered the careless\r\nFrenchman with his most amiable smile.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"LIGHT AND HEAT; ALL LIFE IS CONTAINED IN THEM.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n   TYCHO.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt six in the evening the projectile passed the south pole at less than\r\nforty miles off, a distance equal to that already reached at the north\r\npole. The elliptical curve was being rigidly carried out.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the travellers once more entered the blessed rays of the\r\nsun. They saw once more those stars which move slowly from east to west.\r\nThe radiant orb was saluted by a triple hurrah. With its light it also\r\nsent heat, which soon pierced the metal walls. The glass resumed its\r\naccustomed appearance. The layers of ice melted as if by enchantment; and\r\nimmediately, for economy's sake, the gas was put out, the air apparatus\r\nalone consuming its usual quantity.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Nicholl, \"these rays of heat are good. With what impatience\r\nmust the Selenites wait the reappearance of the orb of day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Michel Ardan, \"imbibing as it were the brilliant ether,\r\nlight and heat, all life is contained in them.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the bottom of the projectile deviated somewhat from the\r\nlunar surface, in order to follow the slightly lengthened elliptical\r\norbit. From this point, had the earth been at the full, Barbicane and\r\nhis companions could have seen it, but immersed in the sun's irradiation\r\nshe was quite invisible. Another spectacle attracted their attention,\r\nthat of the southern part of the moon, brought by the glasses to within\r\n450 yards. They did not again leave the scuttles, and noted every detail\r\nof this fantastical continent.\r\n\r\nMounts Doerfel and Leibnitz formed two separate groups very near the\r\nsouth pole. The first group extended from the pole to the eighty-fourth\r\nparallel, on the eastern part of the orb; the second occupied the eastern\r\nborder, extending from the 65° of latitude to the pole.\r\n\r\nOn their capriciously formed ridge appeared dazzling sheets, as mentioned\r\nby Pere Secchi. With more certainty than the illustrious Roman astronomer,\r\nBarbicane was enabled to recognize their nature.\r\n\r\n\"They are snow,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Snow?\" repeated Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Nicholl, snow; the surface of which is deeply frozen. See how they\r\nreflect the luminous rays. Cooled lava would never give out such intense\r\nreflection. There must then be water, there must be air on the moon. As\r\nlittle as you please, but the fact can no longer be contested.\" No, it\r\ncould not be. And if ever Barbicane should see the earth again, his notes\r\nwill bear witness to this great fact in his selenographic observations.\r\n\r\nThese mountains of Doerfel and Leibnitz rose in the midst of plains of a\r\nmedium extent, which were bounded by an indefinite succession of circles\r\nand annular ramparts. These two chains are the only ones met with in\r\nthis region of circles. Comparatively but slightly marked, they throw up\r\nhere and there some sharp points, the highest summit of which attains an\r\naltitude of 24,600 feet.\r\n\r\nBut the projectile was high above all this landscape, and the projections\r\ndisappeared in the intense brilliancy of the disc. And to the eyes of the\r\ntravellers there reappeared that original aspect of the lunar landscapes,\r\nraw in tone, without gradation of colours, and without degrees of shadow,\r\nroughly black and white, from the want of diffusion of light.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: HE DISTINGUISHED ALL THIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the sight of this desolate world did not fail to captivate them by its\r\nvery strangeness. They were moving over this region as if they had been\r\nborne on the breath of some storm, watching heights defile under their\r\nfeet, piercing the cavities with their eyes, going down into the rifts,\r\nclimbing the ramparts, sounding these mysterious holes, and levelling all\r\ncracks. But no trace of vegetation, no appearance of cities; nothing but\r\nstratification, beds of lava, overflowings polished like immense mirrors,\r\nreflecting the sun's rays with overpowering brilliancy. Nothing belonging\r\nto a _living_ world—everything to a dead world, where avalanches,\r\nrolling from the summits of the mountains, would disperse noiselessly at\r\nthe bottom of the abyss, retaining the motion, but wanting the sound. In\r\nany case it was the image of death, without its being possible even to\r\nsay that life had ever existed there.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan, however, thought he recognized a heap of ruins, to which\r\nhe drew Barbicane's attention. It was about the 80th parallel, in 30°\r\nlongitude. This heap of stones, rather regularly placed, represented a\r\nvast fortress, overlooking a long rift, which in former days had served\r\nas a bed to the rivers of prehistorical times. Not far from that, rose\r\nto a height of 17,400 feet the annular mountain of Short, equal to the\r\nAsiatic Caucasus. Michel Ardan, with his accustomed ardour, maintained\r\n\"the evidences\" of his fortress. Beneath it he discerned the dismantled\r\nramparts of a town; here the still intact arch of a portico, there two\r\nor three columns lying under their base; farther on, a succession of\r\narches which must have supported the conduit of an aqueduct; in another\r\npart the sunken pillars of a gigantic bridge, run into the thickest parts\r\nof the rift. He distinguished all this, but with so much imagination in\r\nhis glance, and through glasses so fantastical, that we must mistrust\r\nhis observation. But who could affirm, who would dare to say, that the\r\namiable fellow did not really see that which his two companions would\r\nnot see?\r\n\r\nMoments were too precious to be sacrificed in idle discussion. The\r\nSelenite city, whether imaginary or not, had already disappeared afar off.\r\nThe distance of the projectile from the lunar disc was on the increase,\r\nand the details of the soil were being lost in a confused jumble. The\r\nreliefs, the circles, the craters and plains alone remained, and still\r\nshowed their boundary lines distinctly. At this moment, to the left,\r\nlay extended one of the finest circles of lunar orography, one of the\r\ncuriosities of this continent. It was Newton, which Barbicane recognized\r\nwithout trouble, by referring to the _Mappa Selenographica_.\r\n\r\nNewton is situated in exactly 77° south lat., and 16° east long. It\r\nforms an annular crater, the ramparts of which, rising to a height of\r\n21,300 feet, seemed to be impassable.\r\n\r\nBarbicane made his companions observe that the height of this mountain\r\nabove the surrounding plain was far from equalling the depth of its\r\ncrater. This enormous hole was beyond all measurement, and formed a\r\ngloomy abyss, the bottom of which the sun's rays could never reach.\r\nThere, according to Humboldt, reigns utter darkness, which the light of\r\nthe sun and the earth cannot break. Mythologists could well have made it\r\nthe mouth of hell.\r\n\r\n\"Newton,\" said Barbicane, \"is the most perfect type of these annular\r\nmountains, of which the earth possesses no sample. They prove that\r\nthe moon's formation, by means of cooling, is due to violent causes;\r\nfor whilst under the pressure of internal fires the reliefs rise to\r\nconsiderable height, the depths withdraw far below the lunar level.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not dispute the fact,\" replied Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nSome minutes after passing Newton, the projectile directly overlooked\r\nthe annular mountain of Moret. It skirted at some distance the summits\r\nof Blancanus, and at about half-past seven in the evening reached the\r\ncircle of Clavius.\r\n\r\nThis circle, one of the most remarkable of the disc, is situated in 58°\r\nsouth lat., and 15° east long. Its height is estimated at 22,950 feet.\r\nThe travellers, at a distance of twenty-four miles (reduced to four by\r\ntheir glasses), could admire this vast crater in its entirety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: CAN YOU PICTURE TO YOURSELVES?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Terrestrial volcanoes,\" said Barbicane, \"are but molehills compared\r\nwith those of the moon. Measuring the old craters formed by the first\r\neruptions of Vesuvius and Etna, we find them little more than three miles\r\nin breadth. In France the circle of Cantal measures six miles across; at\r\nCeyland the circle of the island is forty miles, which is considered the\r\nlargest on the globe. What are these diameters against that of Clavius,\r\nwhich we overlook at this moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is its breadth?\" asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"It is 150 miles,\" replied Barbicane. \"This circle is certainly the most\r\nimportant on the moon, but many others measure 150, 100, or 75 miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my friends,\" exclaimed Michel, \"can you picture to yourselves what\r\nthis now peaceful orb of night must have been when its craters, filled\r\nwith thunderings, vomited at the same time smoke and tongues of flame.\r\nWhat a wonderful spectacle then, and now what decay! This moon is nothing\r\nmore than a thin carcase of fireworks, whose squibs, rockets, serpents\r\nand suns, after a superb brilliancy, have left but sadly broken cases.\r\nWho can say the cause, the reason, the motive force of these cataclysms?\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane was not listening to Michel Ardan; he was contemplating those\r\nramparts of Clavius, formed by large mountains spread over several\r\nmiles. At the bottom of the immense cavity burrowed hundreds of small\r\nextinguished craters, riddling the soil like a colander, and overlooked\r\nby a peak 15,000 feet high.\r\n\r\nAround the plain appeared desolate. Nothing so arid as these reliefs,\r\nnothing so sad as these ruins of mountains, and (if we may so express\r\nourselves) these fragments of peaks and mountains which strewed the soil.\r\nThe satellite seemed to have burst at this spot.\r\n\r\nThe projectile was still advancing, and this movement did not subside.\r\nCircles, craters, and uprooted mountains succeeded each other incessantly.\r\nNo more plains; no more seas. A never-ending Switzerland and Norway. And\r\nlastly, in the centre of this region of crevasses, the most splendid\r\nmountain on the lunar disc, the dazzling Tycho, in which posterity will\r\never preserve the name of the illustrious Danish astronomer.\r\n\r\nIn observing the full moon in a cloudless sky no one has failed to remark\r\nthis brilliant point of the southern hemisphere. Michel Ardan used every\r\nmetaphor that his imagination could supply to designate it by. To him this\r\nTycho was a focus of light, a centre of irradiation, a crater vomiting\r\nrays. It was the tire of a brilliant wheel, an _asteria_ enclosing the\r\ndisc with its silver tentacles, an enormous eye filled with flames, a\r\nglory carved for Pluto's head, a star launched by the Creator's hand,\r\nand crushed against the face of the moon!\r\n\r\nTycho forms such a concentration of light that the inhabitants of the\r\nearth can see it without glasses, though at a distance of 240,000 miles!\r\nImagine, then, its intensity to the eye of observers placed at a distance\r\nof only fifty miles! Seen through this pure ether, its brilliancy was so\r\nintolerable that Barbicane and his friends were obliged to blacken their\r\nglasses with the gas smoke before they could bear the splendour. Then\r\nsilent, scarcely uttering an interjection of admiration, they gazed, they\r\ncontemplated. All their feelings, all their impressions, were concentrated\r\nin that look, as under any violent emotion all life is concentrated at\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nTycho belongs to the system of radiating mountains, like Aristarchus\r\nand Copernicus; but it is of all the most complete and decided, showing\r\nunquestionably the frightful volcanic action to which the formation of\r\nthe moon is due. Tycho is situated in 43° south lat., and 12° east\r\nlong. Its centre is occupied by a crater fifty miles broad. It assumes\r\na slightly elliptical form, and is surrounded by an enclosure of annular\r\nramparts, which on the east and west overlook the outer plain from a\r\nheight of 15,000 feet. It is a group of Mont Blancs, placed round one\r\ncommon centre and crowned by radiating beams.\r\n\r\nWhat this incomparable mountain really is, with all the projections\r\nconverging towards it, and the interior excrescences of its crater,\r\nphotography itself could never represent. Indeed, it is during the full\r\nmoon that Tycho is seen in all its splendour. Then all shadows disappear,\r\nthe foreshortening of perspective disappears, and all proofs become\r\nwhite—a disagreeable fact; for this strange region would have been\r\nmarvellous if reproduced with photographic exactness. It is but a group\r\nof hollows, craters, circles, a network of crests; then, as far as the\r\neye could see, a whole volcanic network cast upon this encrusted soil.\r\nOne can then understand that the bubbles of this central eruption have\r\nkept their first form. Crystallized by cooling, they have stereotyped\r\nthat aspect which the moon formerly presented when under the Plutonian\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe distance which separated the travellers from the annular summits of\r\nTycho was not so great but that they could catch the principal details.\r\nEven on the causeway forming the fortifications of Tycho, the mountains\r\nhanging on to the interior and exterior sloping flanks rose in stories\r\nlike gigantic terraces. They appeared to be higher by 300 or 400 feet\r\nto the west than to the east. No system of terrestrial encampment could\r\nequal these natural fortifications. A town built at the bottom of this\r\ncircular cavity would have been utterly inaccessible.\r\n\r\nInaccessible and wonderfully extended over this soil covered with\r\npicturesque projections! Indeed, nature had not left the bottom of\r\nthis crater flat and empty. It possessed its own peculiar orography, a\r\nmountainous system, making it a world in itself. The travellers could\r\ndistinguish clearly cones, central hills, remarkable positions of the soil,\r\nnaturally placed to receive the chefs-d'œuvre of Selenite architecture.\r\nThere was marked out the place for a temple, here the ground of a forum,\r\non this spot the plan of a palace, in another the plateau for a citadel;\r\nthe whole overlooked by a central mountain of 1500 feet. A vast circle,\r\nin which ancient Rome could have been held in its entirety ten times\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, enthusiastic at the sight; \"what a grand\r\ntown might be constructed within that ring of mountains! A quiet city,\r\na peaceful refuge, beyond all human misery. How calm and isolated those\r\nmisanthropes, those haters of humanity might live there, and all who have\r\na distaste for social life!\"\r\n\r\n\"All! It would be too small for them,\" replied Barbicane simply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n   GRAVE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the projectile had passed the enceinte of Tycho, and Barbicane and\r\nhis two companions watched with scrupulous attention the brilliant rays\r\nwhich the celebrated mountain shed so curiously all over the horizon.\r\n\r\nWhat was this radiant glory? What geological phenomenon had designed\r\nthese ardent beams? This question occupied Barbicane's mind.\r\n\r\nUnder his eyes ran in all directions luminous furrows, raised at the edges\r\nand concave in the centre, some twelve miles, others thirty miles broad.\r\nThese brilliant trains extended in some places to within 600 miles of\r\nTycho, and seemed to cover, particularly towards the east, the northeast\r\nand the north, the half of the southern hemisphere. One of these jets\r\nextended as far as the circle of Neander, situated on the 40th meridian.\r\nAnother by a slight curve furrowed the Sea of Nectar, breaking against\r\nthe chain of Pyrenees, after a circuit of 800 miles. Others, towards the\r\nwest, covered the Sea of Clouds and the Sea of Humours with a luminous\r\nnetwork. What was the origin of these sparkling rays, which shone on the\r\nplains as well as on the reliefs, at whatever height they might be? All\r\nstarted from a common centre, the crater of Tycho. They sprang from him.\r\nHerschel attributed their brilliancy to currents of lava congealed by the\r\ncold; an opinion, however, which has not been generally adopted. Other\r\nastronomers have seen in these inexplicable rays a kind of _moraines_,\r\nrows of erratic blocks, which had been thrown up at the period of Tycho's\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" asked Nicholl of Barbicane, who was relating and rejecting\r\nthese different opinions.\r\n\r\n\"Because the regularity of these luminous lines, and the violence\r\nnecessary to carry volcanic matter to such distances, is inexplicable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh! by Jove!\" replied Michel Ardan, \"it seems easy enough to me to\r\nexplain the origin of these rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" continued Michel. \"It is enough to say that it is a vast star,\r\nsimilar to that produced by a ball or a stone thrown at a square of\r\nglass!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" replied Barbicane, smiling. \"And what hand would be powerful\r\nenough to throw a ball to give such a shock as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The hand is not necessary,\" answered Nicholl, not at all confounded;\r\n\"and as to the stone, let us suppose it to be a comet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! those much-abused comets!\" exclaimed Barbicane. \"My brave Michel,\r\nyour explanation is not bad; but your comet is useless. The shock which\r\nproduced that rent must have come from the inside of the star. A violent\r\ncontraction of the lunar crust, while cooling, might suffice to imprint\r\nthis gigantic star.\"\r\n\r\n\"A contraction! something like a lunar stomach-ache,\" said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" added Barbicane, \"this opinion is that of an English savant,\r\nNasmyth, and it seems to me to sufficiently explain the radiation of\r\nthese mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"That Nasmyth was no fool!\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\nLong did the travellers, whom such a sight could never weary, admire\r\nthe splendours of Tycho. Their projectile, saturated with luminous\r\ngleams in the double irradiation of sun and moon, must have appeared\r\nlike an incandescent globe. They had passed suddenly from excessive cold\r\nto intense heat. Nature was thus preparing them to become Selenites.\r\nBecome Selenites! That idea brought up once more the question of the\r\nhabitability of the moon. After what they had seen, could the travellers\r\nsolve it? Would they decide for or against it? Michel Ardan persuaded his\r\ntwo friends to form an opinion, and asked them directly if they thought\r\nthat men and animals were represented in the lunar world.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: A VIOLENT CONTRACTION OF THE LUNAR CRUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I think that we can answer,\" said Barbicane; \"but according to my\r\nidea the question ought not to be put in that form. I ask it to be put\r\ndifferently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put it your own way,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" continued Barbicane. \"The problem is a double one, and\r\nrequires a double solution. Is the moon _habitable?_ Has the moon ever\r\nbeen _inhabitable?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" replied Nicholl. \"First let us see whether the moon is habitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, I know nothing about it,\" answered Michel.\r\n\r\n\"And I answer in the negative,\" continued Barbicane. \"In her actual\r\nstate, with her surrounding atmosphere certainly very much reduced,\r\nher seas for the most part dried up, her insufficient supply of water\r\nrestricted, vegetation, sudden alterations of cold and heat, her days\r\nand nights of 354 hours; the moon does not seem habitable to me, nor does\r\nshe seem propitious to animal development, nor sufficient for the wants\r\nof existence as we understand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" replied Nicholl. \"But is not the moon habitable for creatures\r\ndifferently organized from ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"That question is more difficult to answer, but I will try; and I ask\r\nNicholl if _motion_ appears to him to be a necessary result of _life_,\r\nwhatever be its organization?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without a doubt!\" answered Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Then, my worthy companion, I would answer that we have observed the\r\nlunar continent at a distance of 500 yards at most, and that nothing\r\nseemed to us to move on the moon's surface. The presence of any kind\r\nof life would have been betrayed by its attendant marks, such as divers\r\nbuildings, and even by ruins. And what have we seen? Everywhere and always\r\nthe geological works of nature, never the work of man. If, then, there\r\nexist representatives of the animal kingdom on the moon, they must have\r\nfled to those unfathomable cavities which the eye cannot reach; which\r\nI cannot admit, for they must have left traces of their passage on those\r\nplains which the atmosphere must cover, however slightly raised it may be.\r\nThese traces are nowhere visible. There remains but one hypothesis, that\r\nof a living race to which motion, which is life, is foreign.\"\r\n\r\n\"One might as well say, living creatures which do not live,\" replied\r\nMichel.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Barbicane, \"which for us has no meaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we may form our opinion?\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" continued Michel Ardan, \"the Scientific Commission assembled\r\nin the projectile of the Gun Club, after having founded their argument\r\non facts recently observed, decide unanimously upon the question of the\r\nhabitability of the moon—_'No!_ the moon is not habitable.'\"\r\n\r\nThis decision was consigned by President Barbicane to his notebook, where\r\nthe process of the sitting of the 6th of December may be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Nicholl, \"let us attack the second question, an indispensable\r\ncomplement of the first. I ask the honourable Commission, if the moon is\r\nnot habitable, has she ever been inhabited, Citizen Barbicane?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" replied Barbicane, \"I did not undertake this journey in\r\norder to form an opinion on the past habitability of our satellite; but I\r\nwill add that our personal observations only confirm me in this opinion.\r\nI believe, indeed I affirm, that the moon has been inhabited by a human\r\nrace organized like our own; that she has produced animals anatomically\r\nformed like the terrestrial animals; but I add that these races, human\r\nor animal, have had their day, and are now for ever extinct!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" asked Michel, \"the moon must be older than the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Barbicane decidedly, \"but a world which has grown old quicker,\r\nand whose formation and deformation have been more rapid. Relatively,\r\nthe organizing force of matter has been much more violent in the interior\r\nof the moon than in the interior of the terrestrial globe. The actual\r\nstate of this cracked twisted, and burst disc abundantly proves this.\r\nThe moon and the earth were nothing but gaseous masses originally. These\r\ngases have passed into a liquid state under different influences, and\r\nthe solid masses have been formed later. But most certainly our sphere\r\nwas still gaseous or liquid, when the moon was solidified by cooling,\r\nand had become habitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Barbicane, \"an atmosphere surrounded it, the waters\r\ncontained within this gaseous envelope could not evaporate. Under the\r\ninfluence of air, water, light, solar heat, and central heat, vegetation\r\ntook possession of the continents prepared to receive it, and certainly\r\nlife showed itself about this period, for nature does not expend herself\r\nin vain; and a world so wonderfully formed for habitation must necessarily\r\nbe inhabited.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Nicholl, \"many phenomena inherent in our satellite might\r\ncramp the expansion of the animal and vegetable kingdom. For example,\r\nits days and nights of 354 hours?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the terrestrial poles they last six months,\" said Michel.\r\n\r\n\"An argument of little value, since the poles are not inhabited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us observe, my friends,\" continued Barbicane, \"that if in the actual\r\nstate of the moon its long nights and long days created differences\r\nof temperature insupportable to organization, it was not so at the\r\nhistorical period of time. The atmosphere enveloped the disc with a\r\nfluid mantle; vapour deposited itself in the shape of clouds; this\r\nnatural screen tempered the ardour of the solar rays, and retained the\r\nnocturnal radiation. Light, like heat, can diffuse itself in the air;\r\nhence an equality between the influences which no longer exists, now that\r\nthat atmosphere has almost entirely disappeared. And now I am going to\r\nastonish you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Astonish us?\" said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"I firmly believe that at the period when the moon was inhabited, the\r\nnights and days did not last 354 hours!\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\" asked Nicholl quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Because most probably then the rotary motion of the moon upon her axis\r\nwas not equal to her revolution, an equality which presents each part of\r\nher disc during fifteen days to the action of the solar rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted,\" replied Nicholl, \"but why should not these two motions have\r\nbeen equal, as they are really so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because that equality has only been determined by terrestrial attraction.\r\nAnd who can say that this attraction was powerful enough to alter the\r\nmotion of the moon at that period when the earth was still fluid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Nicholl; \"and who can say that the moon has always\r\nbeen a satellite of the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"And who can say,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"that the moon did not exist\r\nbefore the earth?\"\r\n\r\nTheir imaginations carried them away into an indefinite field of\r\nhypothesis. Barbicane sought to restrain them.\r\n\r\n\"Those speculations are too high,\" said he; \"problems utterly insoluble.\r\nDo not let us enter upon them. Let us only admit the insufficiency of the\r\nprimordial attraction; and then by the inequality of the two motions of\r\nrotation and revolution, the days and nights could have succeeded each\r\nother on the moon as they succeed each other on the earth. Besides, even\r\nwithout these conditions, life was possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" asked Michel Ardan, \"humanity has disappeared from the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Barbicane, \"after having doubtless remained persistently\r\nfor millions of centuries; by degrees the atmosphere becoming rarefied,\r\nthe disc became uninhabitable, as the terrestrial globe will one day\r\nbecome by cooling.\"\r\n\r\n\"By cooling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Barbicane; \"as the internal fires became extinguished,\r\nand the incandescent matter concentrated itself, the lunar crust cooled.\r\nBy degrees the consequences of these phenomena showed themselves in the\r\ndisappearance of organized beings, and by the disappearance of vegetation.\r\nSoon the atmosphere was rarefied, probably withdrawn by terrestrial\r\nattraction; then aerial departure of respirable air, and disappearance\r\nof water by means of evaporation. At this period the moon becoming\r\nuninhabitable, was no longer inhabited. It was a dead world, such as we\r\nsee it to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you say that the same fate is in store for the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most probably.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the cooling of its crust shall have made it uninhabitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have they calculated the time which our unfortunate sphere will take\r\nto cool?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you know these calculations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But speak, then, my clumsy savant,\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, \"for you\r\nmake me boil with impatience!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, my good Michel,\" replied Barbicane quietly, \"we know what\r\ndiminution of temperature the earth undergoes in the lapse of a century.\r\nAnd according to certain calculations, this mean temperature will, after\r\na period of 400,000 years, be brought down to zero!\"\r\n\r\n\"Four hundred thousand years!\" exclaimed Michel. \"Ah! I breathe again.\r\nReally I was frightened to hear you; I imagined that we had not more than\r\n50,000 years to live.\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing at their companion's\r\nuneasiness. Then Nicholl, who wished to end the discussion, put the\r\nsecond question, which had just been considered again.\r\n\r\n\"Has the moon been inhabited?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe answer was unanimously in the affirmative. But during this discussion,\r\nfruitful in somewhat hazardous theories, the projectile was rapidly\r\nleaving the moon; the lineaments faded away from the travellers' eyes,\r\nmountains were confused in the distance; and of all the wonderful,\r\nstrange, and fantastical form of the earth's satellite, there soon\r\nremained nothing but the imperishable remembrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n   A STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IMPOSSIBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time Barbicane and his companions looked silently and sadly\r\nupon that world which they had only seen from a distance, as Moses saw\r\nthe land of Canaan, and which they were leaving without a possibility of\r\never returning to it. The projectile's position with regard to the moon\r\nhad altered, and the base was now turned to the earth.\r\n\r\nThis change, which Barbicane verified, did not fail to surprise them.\r\nIf the projectile was to gravitate round the satellite in an elliptical\r\norbit, why was not its heaviest part turned towards it, as the moon turns\r\nhers to the earth? That was a difficult point.\r\n\r\nIn watching the course of the projectile they could see that on leaving\r\nthe moon it followed a course analogous to that traced in approaching\r\nher. It was describing a very long ellipse, which would most likely\r\nextend to the point of equal attraction, where the influences of the\r\nearth and its satellite are neutralized.\r\n\r\nSuch was the conclusion which Barbicane very justly drew from facts\r\nalready observed, a conviction which his two friends shared with him.\r\n\r\n\"And when arrived at this dead point, what will become of us?\" asked\r\nMichel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know,\" replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"But one can draw some hypotheses, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two,\" answered Barbicane; \"either the projectile's speed will be\r\ninsufficient, and it will remain for ever immovable on this line of\r\ndouble attraction—\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer the other hypothesis, whatever it may be,\" interrupted Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Or,\" continued Barbicane, \"its speed will be sufficient, and it will\r\ncontinue its elliptical course, to gravitate for ever around the orb of\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"A revolution not at all consoling,\" said Michel, \"to pass to the state\r\nof humble servants to a moon whom we are accustomed to look upon as our\r\nown handmaid. So that is the fate in store for us?\"\r\n\r\nNeither Barbicane nor Nicholl answered.\r\n\r\n\"You do not answer,\" continued Michel impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to answer,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Is there nothing to try?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Barbicane. \"Do you pretend to fight against the impossible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? Do one Frenchman and two Americans shrink from such a word?\"\r\n\r\n\"But what would you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Subdue this motion which is bearing us away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Subdue it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Michel, getting animated, \"or else alter it, and employ\r\nit to the accomplishment of our own ends.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is your affair. If artillerymen are not masters of their projectile\r\nthey are not artillerymen. If the projectile is to command the gunner,\r\nwe had better ram the gunner into the gun. My faith! fine savants! who\r\ndo not know what is to become of us after inducing me—\"\r\n\r\n\"Inducing you!\" cried Barbicane and Nicholl. \"Inducing you! What do you\r\nmean by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No recrimination,\" said Michel. \"I do not complain; the trip has pleased\r\nme, the projectile agrees with me; but let us do all that is humanly\r\npossible to do to fall somewhere, even if only on the moon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: AROUND THE PROJECTILE WERE THE OBJECTS WHICH\r\n   HAD BEEN THROWN OUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We ask no better, my worthy Michel,\" replied Barbicane, \"but means fail\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot alter the motion of the projectile?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor diminish its speed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even by lightening it, as they lighten an overloaded vessel?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you throw out?\" said Nicholl. \"We have no ballast on board;\r\nand indeed it seems to me that if lightened it would go much quicker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Slower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quicker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither slower nor quicker,\" said Barbicane, wishing to make his two\r\nfriends agree; \"for we float in space, and must no longer consider\r\nspecific weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" cried Michel Ardan in a decided voice; \"then there remains\r\nbut one thing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast,\" answered the cool, audacious Frenchman, who always brought\r\nup this solution at the most difficult juncture.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if this operation had no influence on the projectile's\r\ncourse, it could at least be tried without inconvenience, and even with\r\nsuccess from a stomachic point of view. Certainly Michel had none but\r\ngood ideas.\r\n\r\nThey breakfasted then at two in the morning; the hour mattered little.\r\nMichel served his usual repast, crowned by a glorious bottle drawn from\r\nhis private cellar. If ideas did not crowd on their brains, we must\r\ndespair of the Chambertin of 1853. The repast finished, observations\r\nbegan again. Around the projectile, at an invariable distance, were\r\nthe objects which had been thrown out. Evidently, in its translatory\r\nmotion round the moon, it had not passed through any atmosphere, for\r\nthe specific weight of these different objects would have checked their\r\nrelative speed.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the terrestrial sphere nothing was to be seen. The earth\r\nwas but a day old, having been new the night before at twelve; and two\r\ndays must elapse before its crescent, freed from the solar rays, would\r\nserve as a clock to the Selenites, as in its rotary movement each of its\r\npoints after twenty-four hours repasses the same lunar meridian.\r\n\r\nOn the moon's side the sight was different; the orb shone in all her\r\nsplendour amidst innumerable constellations, whose purity could not be\r\ntroubled by her rays. On the disc, the plains were already returning to\r\nthe dark tint which is seen from the earth. The other part of the nimbus\r\nremained brilliant, and in the midst of this general brilliancy Tycho\r\nshone prominently like a sun.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had no means of estimating the projectile's speed, but\r\nreasoning showed that it must uniformly decrease, according to the laws of\r\nmechanical reasoning. Having admitted that the projectile was describing\r\nan orbit round the moon, this orbit must necessarily be elliptical;\r\nscience proves that it must be so. No motive body circulating round an\r\nattracting body fails in this law. Every orbit described in space is\r\nelliptical. And why should the projectile of the Gun Club escape this\r\nnatural arrangement? In elliptical orbits, the attracting body always\r\noccupies one of the foci; so that at one moment the satellite is nearer,\r\nand at another farther from the orb around which it gravitates. When the\r\nearth is nearest the sun she is in her perihelion; and in her aphelion\r\nat the farthest point. Speaking of the moon, she is nearest to the earth\r\nin her perigee, and farthest from it in her apogee. To use analogous\r\nexpressions, with which the astronomers' language is enriched, if the\r\nprojectile remains as a satellite of the moon, we must say that it is\r\nin its \"aposelene\" at its farthest point, and in its \"periselene\" at its\r\nnearest. In the latter case, the projectile would attain its maximum of\r\nspeed; and in the former its minimum. It was evidently moving towards\r\nits aposelenitical point; and Barbicane had reason to think that its\r\nspeed would decrease up to this point, and then increase by degrees as\r\nit neared the moon. This speed would even become _nil_, if this point\r\njoined that of equal attraction. Barbicane studied the consequences of\r\nthese different situations, and thinking what inference he could draw\r\nfrom them, when he was roughly disturbed by a cry from Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed, \"I must admit we are downright simpletons!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say we are not,\" replied Barbicane; \"but why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we have a very simple means of checking this speed which is\r\nbearing us from the moon, and we do not use it!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the means?\"\r\n\r\n\"To use the recoil contained in our rockets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done!\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"We have not used this force yet,\" said Barbicane, \"it is true, but we\r\nwill do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\" asked Michel.\r\n\r\n\"When the time comes. Observe, my friends, that in the position occupied\r\nby the projectile, an oblique position with regard to the lunar disc,\r\nour rockets, in slightly altering its direction, might turn it from the\r\nmoon instead of drawing it nearer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Let us wait, then. By some inexplicable influence, the projectile is\r\nturning its base towards the earth. It is probable that at the point\r\nof equal attraction, its conical cap will be directed rigidly towards\r\nthe moon; at that moment we may hope that its speed will be _nil_; then\r\nwill be the moment to act, and with the influence of our rockets we may\r\nperhaps provoke a fall directly on the surface of the lunar disc.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" said Michel. \"What we did not do, what we could not do on our\r\nfirst passage at the dead point, because the projectile was then endowed\r\nwith too great a speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well reasoned,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"Let us wait patiently,\" continued Barbicane. \"Putting every chance on\r\nour side, and after having so much despaired, I may say I think that we\r\nshall gain our end.\"\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was a signal for Michel Ardan's hips and hurrahs. And\r\nnone of the audacious boobies remembered the question that they themselves\r\nhad solved in the negative. No! the moon is not inhabited; no! the moon\r\nis probably not habitable. And yet they were going to try every thing to\r\nreach her.\r\n\r\nOne single question remained to be solved. At what precise moment the\r\nprojectile would reach the point of equal attraction, on which the\r\ntravellers must play their last card. In order to calculate this to\r\nwithin a few seconds, Barbicane had only to refer to his notes, and\r\nto reckon the different heights taken on the lunar parallels. Thus the\r\ntime necessary to travel over the distance between the dead point and\r\nthe south pole would be equal to the distance separating the north pole\r\nfrom the dead point. The hours representing the time travelled over\r\nwere carefully noted, and the calculation was easy. Barbicane found that\r\nthis point would be reached at one in the morning on the night of the\r\n7th—8th of December. So that, if nothing interfered with its course,\r\nit would reach the given point in twenty-two hours.\r\n\r\nThe rockets had primarily been placed to check the fall of the projectile\r\nupon the moon, and now they were going to employ them for a directly\r\ncontrary purpose. In any case they were ready, and they had only to wait\r\nfor the moment to set fire to them.\r\n\r\n\"Since there is nothing else to be done,\" said Nicholl, \"I make a\r\nproposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n\"I propose to go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a motion!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n\"It is forty hours since we closed our eyes,\" said Nicholl. \"Some hours\r\nof sleep will restore our strength.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"THESE PRACTICAL PEOPLE HAVE SOMETIMES MOST\r\n   OPPORTUNE IDEAS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" interrupted Michel.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Nicholl, \"every one to his taste; I shall go to sleep.\"\r\nAnd stretching himself on the divan, he soon snored like a forty-eight\r\npounder.\r\n\r\n\"That Nicholl has a good deal of sense,\" said Barbicane, \"presently I\r\nshall follow his example.\" Some moments after his continued base supported\r\nthe captain's barytone.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Michel Ardan, finding himself alone, \"these practical\r\npeople have sometimes most opportune ideas.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with his long legs stretched out, and his great arms folded under\r\nhis head, Michel slept in his turn.\r\n\r\nBut this sleep could be neither peaceful nor lasting, the minds of these\r\nthree men were too much occupied, and some hours after, about seven in\r\nthe morning, all three were on foot at the same instant.\r\n\r\nThe projectile was still leaving the moon, and turning its conical part\r\nmore and more towards her.\r\n\r\nAn explicable phenomenon, but one which happily served Barbicane's ends.\r\n\r\nSeventeen hours more, and the moment for action would have arrived.\r\n\r\nThe day seemed long. However bold the travellers might be, they were\r\ngreatly impressed by the approach of that moment which would decide\r\nall—either precipitate their fall on to the moon, or for ever chain\r\nthem in an immutable orbit. They counted the hours as they passed too\r\nslow for their wish; Barbicane and Nicholl were obstinately plunged in\r\ntheir calculations, Michel going and coming between the narrow walls,\r\nand watching that impassive moon with a longing eye.\r\n\r\nAt times recollections of the earth crossed their minds. They saw once\r\nmore their friends of the Gun Club, and the dearest of all, J. T. Maston.\r\nAt that moment, the honourable secretary must be filling his post on\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. If he could see the projectile through the glass of\r\nhis gigantic telescope, what would he think? After seeing it disappear\r\nbehind the moon's south pole, he would see them reappear by the north\r\npole! They must therefore be a satellite of a satellite! Had J. T. Maston\r\ngiven this unexpected news to the world? Was this the dénouement of this\r\ngreat enterprise?\r\n\r\nBut the day passed without incident. The terrestrial midnight arrived.\r\nThe 8th of December was beginning. One hour more, and the point of equal\r\nattraction would be reached. What speed would then animate the projectile?\r\nThey could not estimate it. But no error could vitiate Barbicane's\r\ncalculations. At one in the morning this speed ought to be and would be\r\n_nil._\r\n\r\nBesides, another phenomenon would mark the projectile's stopping-point on\r\nthe neutral line. At that spot the two attractions, lunar and terrestrial,\r\nwould be annulled. Objects would \"weigh\" no more. This singular fact,\r\nwhich had surprised Barbicane and his companions so much in going, would\r\nbe repeated on their return under the very same conditions. At this\r\nprecise moment they must act.\r\n\r\nAlready the projectile's conical top was sensibly turned towards the\r\nlunar disc, presented in such a way as to utilize the whole of the recoil\r\nproduced by the pressure of the rocket apparatus. The chances were in\r\nfavour of the travellers. If its speed was utterly annulled on this dead\r\npoint, a decided movement towards the moon would suffice, however slight,\r\nto determine its fall.\r\n\r\n\"Five minutes to one,\" said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n\"All is ready,\" replied Michel Ardan, directing a lighted match to the\r\nflame of the gas.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" said Barbicane, holding his chronometer in his hand.\r\n\r\nAt that moment weight had no effect. The travellers felt in themselves\r\nthe entire disappearance of it. They were very near the neutral point,\r\nif they did not touch it.\r\n\r\n\"One o'clock,\" said Barbicane.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan applied the lighted match to a train in communication with\r\nthe rockets. No detonation was heard in the inside, for there was no air.\r\nBut, through the scuttles Barbicane saw a prolonged smoke, the flames of\r\nwhich were immediately extinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: ARDEN APPLIED THE LIGHTED MATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe projectile sustained a certain shock, which was sensibly felt in the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked and listened without speaking, and scarcely\r\nbreathing. One might have heard the beating of their hearts amidst this\r\nperfect silence.\r\n\r\n\"Are we falling?\" asked Michel Ardan, at length.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Nicholl, \"since the bottom of the projectile is not turning\r\nto the lunar disc!\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Barbicane, quitting the scuttle, turned to his two\r\ncompanions. He was frightfully pale, his forehead wrinkled, and his lips\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\n\"We are falling!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Michel Ardan, \"on to the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"On to the earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed Michel Ardan, adding philosophically, \"well, when\r\nwe came into this projectile we were very doubtful as to the ease with\r\nwhich we should get out of it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now this fearful fall had begun. The speed retained had borne the\r\nprojectile beyond the dead point. The explosion of the rockets could not\r\ndivert its course. This speed in going had carried it over the neutral\r\nline, and in returning had done the same thing. The laws of physics\r\ncondemned _it to pass through every point which it had already gone\r\nthrough_. It was a terrible fall, from a height of 160,000 miles, and no\r\nsprings to break it. According to the laws of gunnery, the projectile\r\nmust strike the earth with a speed equal to that with which it left the\r\nmouth of the Columbiad, a speed of 16,000 yards in the last second.\r\n\r\nBut to give some figures of comparison, it has been reckoned that an\r\nobject thrown from the top of the towers of Notre Dame, the height of\r\nwhich is only 200 feet, will arrive on the pavement at a speed of 240\r\nmiles per hour. Here the projectile must strike the earth with a speed\r\nof 115,200 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n\"We are lost!\" said Michel coolly.\r\n\r\n\"Very well! if we die,\" answered Barbicane, with a sort of religious\r\nenthusiasm, \"the result of our travels will be magnificently spread.\r\nIt is His own secret that God will tell us! In the other life the soul\r\nwill want to know nothing, either of machines or engines! It will be\r\nidentified with eternal wisdom!\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact,\" interrupted Michel Ardan, \"the whole of the other world may\r\nwell console us for the loss of that inferior orb called the moon!\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane crossed his arms on his breast, with a motion of sublime\r\nresignation, saying at the same time,—\r\n\r\n\"The will of heaven be done!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n   THE SOUNDINGS OF THE \"SUSQUEHANNA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, lieutenant, and our soundings?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, sir, that the operation is nearing its completion,\" replied\r\nLieutenant Bronsfield. \"But who would have thought of finding such a\r\ndepth so near in shore, and only 200 miles from the American coast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Bronsfield, there is a great depression,\" said Captain\r\nBlomsberry. \"In this spot there is a submarine valley worn by Humboldt's\r\ncurrent, which skirts the coast of America as far as the Straits of\r\nMagellan.\"\r\n\r\n\"These great depths,\" continued the lieutenant, \"are not favourable for\r\nlaying telegraphic cables. A level bottom, like that supporting the\r\nAmerican cable between Valentia and Newfoundland, is much better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, Bronsfield. With your permission, lieutenant, where\r\nare we now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, at this moment we have 3508 fathoms of line out, and the ball which\r\ndraws the sounding lead has not yet touched the bottom; for if so, it\r\nwould have come up of itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brook's apparatus is very ingenious,\" said Captain Blomsberry; \"it gives\r\nus very exact soundings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Touch!\" cried at this moment one of the men at the fore-wheel, who was\r\nsuperintending the operation.\r\n\r\nThe captain and the lieutenant mounted the quarter-deck. \"What depth have\r\nwe?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Three thousand six hundred and twenty-seven fathoms,\" replied the\r\nlieutenant, entering it in his note-book.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Bronsfield,\" said the captain, \"I will take down the result. Now\r\nhaul in the sounding line. It will be the work of some hours. In that time\r\nthe engineer can light the furnaces, and we shall be ready to start as\r\nsoon as you have finished. It is ten o'clock, and with your permission,\r\nlieutenant, I will turn in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so, sir; do so!\" replied the lieutenant obligingly.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the \"Susquehanna,\" as brave a man as need be, and the\r\nhumble servant of his officers, returned to his cabin, took a brandy-grog,\r\nwhich earned for the steward no end of praise, and turned in, not without\r\nhaving complimented his servant upon his making beds, and slept a peaceful\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nIt was then ten at night. The eleventh day of the month of December was\r\ndrawing to a close in a magnificent night.\r\n\r\nThe \"Susquehanna,\" a corvette of 500 horse-power, of the United States'\r\nnavy, was occupied in taking soundings in the Pacific Ocean about\r\n200 miles off the American coast, following that long peninsula which\r\nstretches down the coast of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe wind had dropped by degrees. There was no disturbance in the air.\r\nTheir pennant hung motionless from the maintop-gallant-mast truck.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jonathan Blomsberry (cousin-german of Colonel Blomsberry, one of\r\nthe most ardent supporters of the Gun Club, who had married an aunt of\r\nthe captain and daughter of an honourable Kentucky merchant,)—Captain\r\nBlomsberry could not have wished for finer weather in which to bring to\r\na close his delicate operations of sounding. His corvette had not even\r\nfelt the great tempest, which by sweeping away the groups of clouds on\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, had allowed them to observe the course of the famous\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\nEverything went well, and with all the fervour of a Presbyterian, he did\r\nnot forget to thank heaven for it. The series of soundings taken by the\r\n\"Susquehanna,\" had for its aim the finding of a favourable spot for the\r\nlaying of a submarine cable to connect the Hawaiian Islands with the\r\ncoast of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: \"I FANCY I SEE THEM.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a great undertaking, due to the instigation of a powerful company.\r\nIts managing director, the intelligent Cyrus Field, purposed even covering\r\nall the islands of Oceania with a vast electrical network, an immense\r\nenterprise, and one worthy of American genius.\r\n\r\nTo the corvette Susquehanna had been confided the first operations of\r\nsounding. It was on the night of the 11th—12th of December, she was in\r\nexactly 27° 7' north lat., and 41° 37' west long., on the meridian of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe moon, then in her last quarter, was beginning to rise above the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Captain Blomsberry, the lieutenant and some\r\nofficers were standing together on the poop. On the appearance of\r\nthe moon, their thoughts turned to that orb which the eyes of a whole\r\nhemisphere were contemplating. The best naval glasses could not have\r\ndiscovered the projectile wandering around its hemisphere, and yet all\r\nwere pointed towards that brilliant disc which millions of eyes were\r\nlooking at at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\"They have been gone ten days,\" said Lieutenant Bronsfield at last. \"What\r\nhas become of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have arrived, lieutenant,\" exclaimed a young midshipman, \"and\r\nthey are doing what all travellers do when they arrive in a new country,\r\ntaking a walk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I am sure of that, if you tell me so, my young friend,\" said\r\nLieutenant Bronsfield, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued another officer, \"their arrival cannot be doubted.\r\nThe projectile was to reach the moon when full on the 5th at midnight.\r\nWe are now at the 11th of December, which makes six days. And in six\r\ntimes twenty-four hours, without darkness, one would have time to settle\r\ncomfortably. I fancy I see my brave countrymen encamped at the bottom of\r\nsome valley, on the borders of a Selenite stream, near a projectile half\r\nburied by its fall amidst volcanic rubbish, Captain Nicholl beginning\r\nhis levelling operations, President Barbicane writing out his notes, and\r\nMichel Ardan embalming the lunar solitudes with the perfume of his—\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! it must be so, it is so!\" exclaimed the young midshipman, worked\r\nup to a pitch of enthusiasm by this ideal description of his superior\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to believe it,\" replied the lieutenant, who was quite\r\nunmoved. \"Unfortunately direct news from the lunar world is still\r\nwanting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beg pardon, lieutenant,\" said the midshipman, \"but cannot President\r\nBarbicane write?\"\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter greeted this answer.\r\n\r\n\"No letters!\" continued the young man quickly. \"The postal administration\r\nhas something to see to there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might it not be the telegraphic service that is at fault?\" asked one of\r\nthe officers ironically.\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily,\" replied the midshipman, not at all confused. \"But it\r\nis very easy to set up a graphic communication with the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\"\r\n\r\n\"By means of the telescope at Long's Peak. You know it brings the moon\r\nto within four miles of the Rocky Mountains, and that it shows objects on\r\nits surface of only nine feet in diameter. Very well; let our industrious\r\nfriends construct a gigantic alphabet; let them write words three fathoms\r\nlong, and sentences three miles long, and then they can send us news of\r\nthemselves?\"\r\n\r\nThe young midshipman, who had a certain amount of imagination, was loudly\r\napplauded; Lieutenant Bronsfield allowing that the idea was possible,\r\nbut observing that if by these means they could _receive_ news from the\r\nlunar world they could not send any from the terrestrial, unless the\r\nSelenites had instruments fit for taking distant observations at their\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently,\" said one of the officers; \"but what has become of the\r\ntravellers? what they have done, what they have seen, that above all\r\nmust interest us. Besides, if the experiment has succeeded (which I do\r\nnot doubt), they will try it again. The Columbiad is still sunk in the\r\nsoil of Florida. It is now only a question of powder and shot; and every\r\ntime the moon is at her zenith a cargo of visitors may be sent to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is clear,\" replied Lieutenant Bronsfield, \"that J. T. Maston will\r\none day join his friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he will have me,\" cried the midshipman, \"I am ready!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! volunteers will not be wanting,\" answered Bronsfield; \"and if it\r\nwere allowed, half of the earth's inhabitants would emigrate to the\r\nmoon!\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation between the officers of the Susquehanna was kept up\r\nuntil nearly one in the morning. We cannot say what blundering systems\r\nwere broached, what inconsistent theories advanced by these bold spirits.\r\nSince Barbicane's attempt, nothing seemed impossible to the Americans.\r\nThey had already designed an expedition, not only of savants, but of a\r\nwhole colony towards the Selenite borders, and a complete army, consisting\r\nof infantry, artillery, and cavalry, to conquer the lunar world.\r\n\r\nAt one in the morning, the hauling in of the sounding-line was not yet\r\ncompleted; 1670 fathoms were still out, which would entail some hours'\r\nwork. According to the commander's orders, the fires had been lighted,\r\nand steam was being got up. The Susquehanna could have started that very\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nAt that moment (it was seventeen minutes past one in the morning)\r\nLieutenant Bronsfield was preparing to leave the watch and return to his\r\ncabin, when his attention was attracted by a distant hissing noise. His\r\ncomrades and himself first thought that this hissing was caused by the\r\nletting off of steam; but lifting their heads, they found that the noise\r\nwas produced in the highest regions of the air. They had not time to\r\nquestion each other before the hissing became frightfully intense, and\r\nsuddenly there appeared to their dazzled eyes an enormous meteor, ignited\r\nby the rapidity of its course and its friction through the atmospheric\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThis fiery mass grew larger to their eyes, and fell, with the noise\r\nof thunder, upon the bowsprit, which it smashed close to the stem, and\r\nburied itself in the waves with a deafening roar!\r\n\r\nA few feet nearer, and the Susquehanna would have foundered with all on\r\nboard!\r\n\r\nAt this instant Captain Blomsberry appeared, half dressed, and rushing on\r\nto the forecastle-deck, whither all the officers had hurried, exclaimed,\r\n\"With your permission, gentlemen, what has happened?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the midshipman, making himself as it were the echo of the body,\r\ncried, \"Commander, it is 'they' come back again!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: A FEW FEET NEARER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n   J. T. MASTON RECALLED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is 'they' come back again!\" the young midshipman had said; and\r\nevery one had understood him. No one doubted but that that meteor was\r\nthe projectile of the Gun Club. As to the travellers which it enclosed,\r\nopinions were divided regarding their fate.\r\n\r\n\"They are dead!\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"They are alive!\" said another; \"the crater is deep, and the shock was\r\ndeadened.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they must have wanted air,\" continued a third speaker; \"they must\r\nhave died of suffocation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Burnt!\" replied a fourth; \"the projectile was nothing but an incandescent\r\nmass as it crossed the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter!\" they exclaimed unanimously; \"living or dead, we\r\nmust pull them out!\"\r\n\r\nBut Captain Blomsberry had assembled his officers, and \"with their\r\npermission,\" was holding a council. They must decide upon something\r\nto be done immediately. The more hasty ones were for fishing up the\r\nprojectile. A difficult operation, though not an impossible one. But the\r\ncorvette had no proper machinery, which must be both fixed and powerful;\r\nso it was resolved that they should put in at the nearest port, and give\r\ninformation to the Gun Club of the projectile's fall.\r\n\r\nThis determination was unanimous. The choice of the port had to be\r\ndiscussed. The neighbouring coast had no anchorage on 27° lat. Higher\r\nup, above the peninsula of Monterey, stands the important town from which\r\nit takes its name; but, seated on the borders of a perfect desert, it\r\nwas not connected with the interior by a network of telegraphic wires,\r\nand electricity alone could spread these important news fast enough.\r\n\r\nSome degrees above opened the bay of San Francisco. Through the capital\r\nof the gold country communication would be easy with the heart of the\r\nUnion. And in less than two days the \"Susquehanna,\" by putting on high\r\npressure, could arrive in that port. She must therefore start at once.\r\n\r\nThe fires were made up; they could set off immediately. Two thousand\r\nfathoms of line were still out, which Captain Blomsberry, not wishing to\r\nlose precious time in hauling in, resolved to cut.\r\n\r\n\"We will fasten the end to a buoy,\" said he, \"and that buoy will show us\r\nthe exact spot where the projectile fell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" replied Lieutenant Bronsfield, \"we have our situation\r\nexact—27° 7' north lat. and 41° 37' west long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Bronsfield,\" replied the captain, \"now, with your permission,\r\nwe will have the line cut.\"\r\n\r\nA strong buoy, strengthened by a couple of spars, was thrown into the\r\nocean. The end of the rope was carefully lashed to it; and, left solely\r\nto the rise and fall of the billows, the buoy would not sensibly deviate\r\nfrom the spot.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the engineer sent to inform the captain that steam was\r\nup and they could start, for which agreeable communication the captain\r\nthanked him. The course was then given north-north-east, and the corvette,\r\nwearing, steered at full steam direct for San Francisco. It was three in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nFour hundred and fifty miles to cross; it was nothing for a good vessel\r\nlike the \"Susquehanna.\" In thirty-six hours she had covered that distance;\r\nand on the 14th of December, at twenty-seven minutes past one at night,\r\nshe entered the bay of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of a ship of the national navy arriving at full speed, with\r\nher bowsprit broken, public curiosity was greatly roused. A dense crowd\r\nsoon assembled on the quay, waiting for them to disembark.\r\n\r\nAfter casting anchor, Captain Blomsberry and Lieutenant Bronsfield\r\nentered an eight-oared cutter, which soon brought them to land.\r\n\r\nThey jumped on to the quay.\r\n\r\n\"The telegraph?\" they asked, without answering one of the thousand\r\nquestions addressed to them.\r\n\r\nThe officer of the port conducted them to the telegraph-office through\r\na concourse of spectators. Blomsberry and Bronsfield entered, while the\r\ncrowd crushed each other at the door.\r\n\r\nSome minutes later a fourfold telegram was sent out—the first to the\r\nNaval Secretary at Washington; the second to the Vice-President of the Gun\r\nClub, Baltimore; the third to the Hon. J. T. Maston, Long's Peak, Rocky\r\nMountains; the fourth to the Sub-Director of the Cambridge Observatory,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nIt was worded as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"In 20° 7' north lat., and 41° 37' west long., on the 12th of December,\r\n    at 17 past one in the morning, the projectile of the Columbiad fell\r\n        into the Pacific. Send instructions.—Blomsberry, Commander\r\n        'Susquehanna.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFive minutes afterwards the whole town of San Francisco learned the news.\r\nBefore six in the evening the different States of the Union had heard\r\nthe great catastrophe; and after midnight, by the cable, the whole of\r\nEurope knew the result of the great American experiment.\r\n\r\nWe will not attempt to picture the effect produced on the entire world\r\nby that unexpected denouement.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the telegram the Naval Secretary telegraphed to the\r\nSusquehanna to wait in the bay of San Francisco without extinguishing\r\nher fires. Day and night she must be ready to put to sea.\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge Observatory called a special meeting; and, with that\r\ncomposure which distinguishes learned bodies in general, peacefully\r\ndiscussed the scientific bearings of the question. At the Gun Club there\r\nwas an explosion. All the gunners were assembled. Vice-President the\r\nHon. Wilcome was in the act of reading the premature despatch, in which\r\nJ. T. Maston and Belfast announced that the projectile had just been\r\nseen in the gigantic reflector of Long's Peak, and also that it was held\r\nby lunar attraction, and was playing the part of under satellite to the\r\nlunar world.\r\n\r\nWe know the truth on that point.\r\n\r\nBut on the arrival of Blomsberry's despatch, so decidedly contradicting\r\nJ. T. Maston's telegram, two parties were formed in the bosom of the Gun\r\nClub. On one side were those who admitted the fall of the projectile, and\r\nconsequently the return of the travellers; on the other, those who believed\r\nin the observations of Long's Peak, concluded that the commander of the\r\nSusquehanna had made a mistake. To the latter the pretended projectile\r\nwas nothing but a meteor! nothing but a meteor, a shooting globe, which\r\nin its fall had smashed the bows of the corvette. It was difficult to\r\nanswer this argument, for the speed with which it was animated must have\r\nmade observation very difficult. The commander of the Susquehanna and\r\nher officers might have made a mistake in all good faith; one argument\r\nhowever, was in their favour, namely, that if the projectile had fallen\r\non the earth, its place of meeting with the terrestrial globe could only\r\ntake place on this 27° north lat., and (taking into consideration the\r\ntime that had elapsed, and the rotary motion of the earth) between the\r\nforty-first and the forty-second degree of west longitude. In any case,\r\nit was decided in the Gun Club that Blomsberry brothers, Bilsby, and\r\nMajor Elphinstone should go straight to San Francisco, and consult as to\r\nthe means of raising the projectile from the depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThese devoted men set off at once; and the railroad, which will soon\r\ncross the whole of central America, took them as far as St. Louis, where\r\nthe swift mail-coaches awaited them. Almost at the same moment in which\r\nthe Secretary of Marine, the Vice-President of the Gun Club, and the\r\nSub-Director of the Observatory received the despatch from San Francisco,\r\nthe Honourable J. T. Maston was undergoing the greatest excitement he\r\nhad ever experienced in his life, an excitement which even the bursting\r\nof his pet gun, which had more than once nearly cost him his life, had\r\nnot caused him. We may remember that the Secretary of the Gun Club had\r\nstarted soon after the projectile (and almost as quickly) for the station\r\nin Long's Peak, in the Rocky Mountains, J. Belfast, Director of the\r\nCambridge Observatory, accompanying him. Arrived there, the two friends\r\nhad installed themselves at once, never quitting the summit of their\r\nenormous telescope. We know that this gigantic instrument had been set up\r\naccording to the reflecting system, called by the English \"front view.\"\r\nThis arrangement subjected all objects to but one reflection, making\r\nthe view consequently much clearer; the result was that, when they were\r\ntaking observations, J. T. Maston and Belfast were placed in the upper\r\npart of the instrument and not in the lower, which they reached by a\r\ncircular staircase, a masterpiece of lightness, while below them opened\r\na metal well terminated by the metallic mirror, which measured 280 feet\r\nin depth.\r\n\r\nIt was on a narrow platform placed above the telescope that the two\r\nsavants passed their existence, execrating the day which hid the moon\r\nfrom their eyes, and the clouds which obstinately veiled her during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was their delight when, after some days of waiting, on the\r\nnight of the 5th of December, they saw the vehicle which was bearing their\r\nfriends into space! To this delight succeeded a great deception, when,\r\ntrusting to a cursory observation, they launched their first telegram\r\nto the world, erroneously affirming that the projectile had become a\r\nsatellite of the moon, gravitating in an immutable orbit.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment it had never shown itself to their eyes—a disappearance\r\nall the more easily explained, as it was then passing behind the moon's\r\ninvisible disc; but when it was time for it to reappear on the visible\r\ndisc, one may imagine the impatience of the fuming J. T. Maston and his\r\nnot less impatient companion. Each minute of the night they thought they\r\nsaw the projectile once more, and they did not see it. Hence constant\r\ndiscussions and violent disputes between them, Belfast affirming that\r\nthe projectile could not be seen, J. T. Maston maintaining that \"it had\r\nput his eyes out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the projectile!\" repeated J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Belfast; \"it is an avalanche detached from a lunar\r\nmountain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall see it to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we shall not see it any more. It is carried into space.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\nAnd at these moments, when contradictions rained like hail, the well-known\r\nirritability of the Secretary of the Gun Club constituted a permanent\r\ndanger for the Honorable Belfast. The existence of these two together\r\nwould soon have become impossible; but an unforeseen event cut short\r\ntheir everlasting discussions.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, from the 14th to the 15th of December, the two\r\nirreconcilable friends were busy observing the lunar disc, J. T. Maston\r\nabusing the learned Belfast as usual, who was by his side; the Secretary\r\nof the Gun Club maintaining for the thousandth time that he had just seen\r\nthe projectile, and adding that he could see Michel Ardan's face looking\r\nthrough one of the scuttles, at the same time enforcing his argument by\r\na series of gestures which his formidable hook rendered very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Belfast's servant appeared on the platform (it was\r\nten at night) and gave him a despatch. It was the commander of the\r\n\"Susquehanna's\" telegram.\r\n\r\nBelfast tore the envelope and read, and uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE UNFORTUNATE MAN HAD DISAPPEARED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The projectile!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Has fallen to the earth!\"\r\n\r\nAnother cry, this time a perfect howl, answered him. He turned towards J.\r\nT. Maston. The unfortunate man, imprudently leaning over the metal tube,\r\nhad disappeared in the immense telescope. A fall of 280 feet! Belfast,\r\ndismayed, rushed to the orifice of the reflector.\r\n\r\nHe breathed. J. T. Maston, caught by his metal hook was holding on by\r\none of the rings which bound the telescope together, uttering fearful\r\ncries.\r\n\r\nBelfast called. Help was brought, tackle was let down, and they hoisted\r\nup, not without some trouble, the imprudent Secretary of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\nHe reappeared at the upper orifice without hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"if I had broken the mirror?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have paid for it,\" replied Belfast severely.\r\n\r\n\"And that cursed projectile has fallen?\" asked J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Into the Pacific!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go!\"\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour after the two savants were descending the declivity\r\nof the Rocky Mountains; and two days after, at the same time as their\r\nfriends of the Gun Club, they arrived at San Francisco, having killed\r\nfive horses on the road.\r\n\r\nElphinstone, the brothers Blomsberry, and Bilsby rushed towards them on\r\ntheir arrival.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" they exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Fish up the projectile,\" replied J. T. Maston, \"and the sooner the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n   RECOVERED FROM THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spot where the projectile sank under the waves was exactly known;\r\nbut machinery to grasp it and bring it to the surface of the ocean was\r\nstill wanting. It must first be invented, then made. American engineers\r\ncould not be troubled with such trifles. The grappling-irons once fixed,\r\nby their help they were sure to raise it in spite of its weight, which\r\nwas lessened by the density of the liquid in which it was plunged.\r\n\r\nBut fishing-up the projectile was not the only thing to be thought of.\r\nThey must act promptly in the interest of the travellers. No one doubted\r\nthat they were still living.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" repeated J. T. Maston incessantly, whose confidence gained over\r\neverybody, \"our friends are clever people, and they cannot have fallen\r\nlike simpletons. They are alive, quite alive; but we must make haste if\r\nwe wish to find them so. Food and water do not trouble me; they have\r\nenough for a long while. But air, air, that is what they will soon want;\r\nso quick, quick!\"\r\n\r\nAnd they did go quick. They fitted up the Susquehanna for her new\r\ndestination. Her powerful machinery was brought to bear upon the\r\nhauling-chains. The aluminium projectile only weighed 19,250 lbs., a\r\nweight very inferior to that of the transatlantic cable which had been\r\ndrawn up under similar conditions. The only difficulty was in fishing-up\r\na cylindro-conical projectile, the walls of which were so smooth as to\r\noffer no hold for the hooks. On that account Engineer Murchison hastened\r\nto San Francisco, and had some enormous grappling-irons fixed on an\r\nautomatic system, which would never let the projectile go if it once\r\nsucceeded in seizing it in its powerful claws. Diving-dresses were also\r\nprepared, which through this impervious covering allowed the divers to\r\nobserve the bottom of the sea. He also had put on board an apparatus\r\nof compressed air very cleverly designed. There were perfect chambers\r\npierced with scuttles, which, with water let into certain compartments,\r\ncould draw it down into great depths. These apparatuses were at San\r\nFrancisco, where they had been used in the construction of a submarine\r\nbreakwater; and very fortunately it was so, for there was no time to\r\nconstruct any. But in spite of the perfection of the machinery, in spite\r\nof the ingenuity of the savants entrusted with the use of them, the\r\nsuccess of the operation was far from being certain. How great were the\r\nchances against them, the projectile being 20,000 feet under the water!\r\nAnd if even it was brought to the surface, how would the travellers\r\nhave borne the terrible shock which 20,000 feet of water had perhaps\r\nnot sufficiently broken? At any rate they must act quickly. J. T. Maston\r\nhurried the workmen day and night. He was ready to don the diving-dress\r\nhimself, or try the air apparatus, in order to reconnoitre the situation\r\nof his courageous friends.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all diligence displayed in preparing the different\r\nengines, in spite of the considerable sum placed at the disposal of\r\nthe Gun Club by the Government of the Union, five long days (five\r\ncenturies!) elapsed before the preparations were complete. During this\r\ntime public opinion was excited to the highest pitch. Telegrams were\r\nexchanged incessantly throughout the entire world by means of wires and\r\nelectric cables. The saving of Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan was\r\nan international affair. Every one who had subscribed to the Gun Club\r\nwas directly interested in the welfare of the travellers.\r\n\r\nAt length the hauling-chains, the air-chambers, and the automatic\r\ngrappling-irons were put on board. J. T. Maston, Engineer Murchison, and\r\nthe delegates of the Gun Club, were already in their cabins. They had\r\nbut to start, which they did on the 21st of December, at eight o'clock\r\nat night, the corvette meeting with a beautiful sea, a north-easterly\r\nwind, and rather sharp cold. The whole population of San Francisco was\r\ngathered on the quay, greatly excited but silent, reserving their hurrahs\r\nfor the return. Steam was fully up, and the screw of the Susquehanna\r\ncarried them briskly out of the bay.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to relate the conversations on board between the officers,\r\nsailors, and passengers. All these men had but one thought. All these\r\nhearts beat under the same emotion. Whilst they were hastening to help\r\nthem, what were Barbicane and his companions doing? What had become\r\nof them? Were they able to attempt any bold maneuver to regain their\r\nliberty? None could say. The truth is that every attempt must have\r\nfailed! Immersed nearly four miles under the ocean, this metal prison\r\ndefied every effort of its prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd inst., at eight in the morning, after a rapid passage, the\r\nSusquehanna was due at the fatal spot. They must wait till twelve to\r\ntake the reckoning exactly. The buoy to which the sounding line had been\r\nlashed had not yet been recognized.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, Captain Blomsberry, assisted by his officers who superintended\r\nthe observations, took the reckoning in the presence of the delegates of\r\nthe Gun Club. Then there was a moment of anxiety. Her position decided,\r\nthe Susquehanna was found to be some minutes to westward of the spot\r\nwhere the projectile had disappeared beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nThe ship's course was then changed so as to reach this exact point.\r\n\r\nAt forty-seven minutes past twelve they reached the buoy, it was in\r\nperfect condition, and must have shifted but little.\r\n\r\n\"At last!\" exclaimed J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we begin?\" asked Captain Blomsberry.\r\n\r\n\"Without losing a second.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE DESCENT BEGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery precaution was taken to keep the corvette almost completely\r\nmotionless. Before trying to seize the projectile, Engineer Murchison\r\nwanted to find its exact position at the bottom of the ocean. The\r\nsubmarine apparatus destined for this expedition was supplied with air.\r\nThe working of these engines was not without danger, for at 20,000 feet\r\nbelow the surface of the water, and under such great pressure, they were\r\nexposed to fracture, the consequences of which would be dreadful.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston, the Brothers Blomsberry, and Engineer Murchison, without\r\nheeding these dangers, took their places in the air-chamber. The\r\ncommander, posted on his bridge, superintended the operation, ready to\r\nstop or haul in the chains on the slightest signal. The screw had been\r\nshipped, and the whole power of the machinery collected on the capstan\r\nwould have quickly drawn the apparatus on board. The descent began at\r\ntwenty-five minutes past one at night, and the chamber, drawn under by\r\nthe reservoirs full of water, disappeared from the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe emotion of the officers and sailors on board was now divided between\r\nthe prisoners in the projectile and the prisoners in the submarine\r\napparatus. As to the latter, they forgot themselves, and, glued to the\r\nwindows of the scuttles, attentively watched the liquid mass through\r\nwhich they were passing.\r\n\r\nThe descent was rapid. At seventeen minutes past two, J. T. Maston\r\nand his companions had reached the bottom of the Pacific; but they saw\r\nnothing but an arid desert, no longer animated by either fauna or flora.\r\nBy the light of their lamps, furnished with powerful reflectors, they\r\ncould see the dark beds of the ocean for a considerable extent of view,\r\nbut the projectile was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe impatience of these bold divers cannot be described, and having an\r\nelectrical communication with the corvette, they made a signal already\r\nagreed upon, and for the space of a mile the Susquehanna moved their\r\nchamber along some yards above the bottom.\r\n\r\nThus they explored the whole submarine plain, deceived at every turn by\r\noptical illusions which almost broke their hearts. Here a rock, there a\r\nprojection from the ground, seemed to be the much-sought-for projectile;\r\nbut their mistake was soon discovered, and then they were in despair.\r\n\r\n\"But where are they? where are they?\" cried J. T. Maston. And the poor\r\nman called loudly upon Nicholl, Barbicane, and Michel Ardan, as if his\r\nunfortunate friends could either hear or answer him through such an\r\nimpenetrable medium! The search continued under these conditions until\r\nthe vitiated air compelled the divers to ascend.\r\n\r\nThe hauling in began about six in the evening, and was not ended before\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" said J. T. Maston, as he set foot on the bridge of the\r\ncorvette.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Captain Blomsberry.\r\n\r\n\"And on another spot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston did not doubt of their final success, but his companions,\r\nno longer upheld by the excitement of the first hours, understood all\r\nthe difficulty of the enterprise. What seemed easy at San Francisco,\r\nseemed here in the wide ocean almost impossible. The chances of success\r\ndiminished in rapid proportion; and it was from chance alone that the\r\nmeeting with the projectile might be expected.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 24th, in spite of the fatigue of the previous day, the\r\noperation was renewed. The corvette advanced some minutes to westward,\r\nand the apparatus, provided with air, bore the same explorers to the\r\ndepths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe whole day passed in fruitless research; the bed of the sea was a\r\ndesert. The 25th brought no other result, nor the 26th.\r\n\r\nIt was disheartening. They thought of those unfortunates shut up in\r\nthe projectile for twenty-six days. Perhaps at that moment they were\r\nexperiencing the first approach of suffocation; that is, if they had\r\nescaped the dangers of their fall. The air was spent, and doubtless with\r\nthe air all their _morale_.\r\n\r\n\"The air, possibly,\" answered J. T. Maston resolutely, \"but their _morale_\r\nnever!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, after two more days of search, all hope was gone. This\r\nprojectile was but an atom in the immensity of the ocean. They must give\r\nup all idea of finding it.\r\n\r\nBut J. T. Maston would not hear of going away. He would not abandon the\r\nplace without at least discovering the tomb of his friends. But Commander\r\nBlomsberry could no longer persist, and in spite of the exclamations of\r\nthe worthy Secretary, was obliged to give the order to sail.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of December, at nine a.m., the \"Susquehanna,\" heading N.E.,\r\nresumed her course to the bay of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIt was ten in the morning; the corvette was under half steam, as if\r\nregretting to leave the spot where the catastrophe had taken place, when\r\na sailor, perched on the maintop gallant crosstrees, watching the sea,\r\ncried suddenly,—\r\n\r\n\"A buoy on the lee bow!\"\r\n\r\nThe officers looked in the direction indicated, and by the help of\r\ntheir glasses saw that the object signalled had the appearance of one\r\nof those buoys which are used to mark the passages of bays or rivers.\r\nBut, singularly to say, a flag floating on the wind surmounted its cone,\r\nwhich emerged five or six feet out of water. This buoy shone under the\r\nrays of the sun as if it had been made of plates of silver. Commander\r\nBlomsberry, J. T. Maston, and the delegates of the Gun Club were mounted\r\non the bridge, examining this object straying at random on\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nAll looked with feverish anxiety, but in silence. None dared give\r\nexpression to the thoughts which came to the minds of all.\r\n\r\nThe corvette approached to within two cables' lengths of the object.\r\n\r\nA shudder ran through the whole crew. That flag was the American flag!\r\n\r\nAt this moment a perfect howling was heard; it was the brave J. T. Maston\r\nwho had just fallen all in a heap. Forgetting on the one hand that his\r\nright arm had been replaced by an iron hook, and on the other that a\r\nsimple gutta-percha cap covered his brain-box, he had given himself a\r\nformidable blow.\r\n\r\nThey hurried towards him, picked him up, restored him to life. And what\r\nwere his first words?\r\n\r\n\"Ah! trebly brutes! quadruply idiots! quintuply boobies that we are!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" exclaimed every one around him.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, simpletons,\" howled the terrible Secretary, \"it is that the\r\nprojectile only weighs 19,250 lbs.!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"And that it displaces twenty-eight tons, or in other words 56,000 lbs.,\r\nand that consequently _it floats!_\"\r\n\r\nAh! what stress the worthy man laid on the verb \"float!\" And it was\r\ntrue! All, yes! all these savants had forgotten this fundamental law,\r\nnamely, that on account of its specific lightness, the projectile, after\r\nhaving been drawn by its fall to the greatest depths of the ocean, must\r\nnaturally return to the surface. And now it was floating quietly at the\r\nmercy of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe boats were put to sea. J. T. Maston and his friends had rushed into\r\nthem! Excitement was at its height! Every heart beat loudly whilst they\r\nadvanced to the projectile. What did it contain? Living or dead? Living,\r\nyes! living, at least unless death had struck Barbicane and his two\r\nfriends since they had hoisted the flag. Profound silence reigned on\r\nthe boats. All were breathless. Eyes no longer saw. One of the scuttles\r\nof the projectile was open. Some pieces of glass remained in the frame,\r\nshowing that it had been broken. This scuttle was actually five feet\r\nabove the water.\r\n\r\nA boat came alongside, that of J. T. Maston, and J. T. Maston rushed to\r\nthe broken window.\r\n\r\nAt that moment they heard a clear and merry voice, the voice of Michel\r\nArdan, exclaiming in an accent of triumph,—\r\n\r\n\"White all, Barbicane, white all!\"\r\n\r\nBarbicane, Michel Ardan, and Nicholl were playing at dominoes!\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: WHITE ALL BARBICANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n   THE END\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may remember the intense sympathy which had accompanied the travellers\r\non their departure. If at the beginning of the enterprise they had excited\r\nsuch emotion both in the old and new world, with what enthusiasm would\r\nthey be received on their return! The millions of spectators which had\r\nbeset the peninsula of Florida, would they not rush to meet these sublime\r\nadventurers? Those legions of strangers, hurrying from all parts of the\r\nglobe towards the American shores, would they leave the Union without\r\nhaving seen Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan? No! and the ardent\r\npassion of the public was bound to respond worthily to the greatness of\r\nthe enterprise. Human creatures who had left the terrestrial sphere, and\r\nreturned after this strange voyage into celestial space, could not fail\r\nto be received as the prophet Elias would be if he came back to earth. To\r\nsee them first, and then to hear them, such was the universal longing.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, Michel Ardan, Nicholl, and the delegates of the Gun Club,\r\nreturning without delay to Baltimore, were received with indescribable\r\nenthusiasm. The notes of President Barbicane's voyage were ready to be\r\ngiven to the public. The _New York Herald_ bought the manuscript at a\r\nprice not yet known, but which must have been very high. Indeed, during\r\nthe publication of \"A Journey to the Moon,\" the sale of this paper\r\namounted to five millions of copies. Three days after the return of\r\nthe travellers to the earth, the slightest detail of their expedition\r\nwas known. There remained nothing more but to see the heroes of this\r\nsuperhuman enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Barbicane and his friends round the moon had enabled\r\nthem to correct the many admitted theories regarding the terrestrial\r\nsatellite. These savants had observed _de visu_, and under particular\r\ncircumstances. They knew what systems should be rejected, what retained\r\nwith regard to the formation of that orb, its origin, its habitability.\r\nIts past, present, and future had even given up their last secrets. Who\r\ncould advance objections against conscientious observers, who at less\r\nthan twenty-four miles distance had marked that curious mountain of\r\nTycho, the strangest system of lunar orography? How answer those savants\r\nwhose sight had penetrated the abyss of Pluto's circle? How contradict\r\nthose bold ones whom the chances of their enterprise had borne over that\r\ninvisible face of the disc, which no human eye until then had ever seen?\r\nIt was now their turn to impose some limit on that Selenographic science,\r\nwhich had reconstructed the lunar world as Cuvier did the skeleton of a\r\nfossil, and say, \"The moon _was_ this, a habitable world, inhabited before\r\nthe earth! The moon _is_ that, a world uninhabitable, and now uninhabited.\"\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the return of its most illustrious member and his two\r\ncompanions, the Gun Club decided upon giving a banquet, but a banquet\r\nworthy of the conquerors, worthy of the American people, and under such\r\nconditions that all the inhabitants of the Union could directly take part\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nAll the head lines of railroads in the State were joined by flying rails;\r\nand on all the platforms, lined with the same flags, and decorated with\r\nthe same ornaments, were tables laid and all served alike. At certain\r\nhours, successively calculated, marked by electric clocks which beat\r\nthe seconds at the same time, the population were invited to take their\r\nplace at the banquet tables. For four days, from the 5th to the 9th of\r\nJanuary, the trains were stopped as they are on Sundays on the railways\r\nof the United States, and every road was open. One engine only at full\r\nspeed, drawing a triumphal carriage, had the right of travelling for\r\nthose four days on the railroads of the United States. The engine was\r\nmanned by a driver and a stoker, and bore, by special favour, the Hon.\r\nJ. T. Maston, Secretary of the Gun Club. The carriage was reserved for\r\nPresident Barbicane, Colonel Nicholl, and Michel Ardan. At the whistle\r\nof the driver, amid the hurrahs, and all the admiring vociferations\r\nof the American language, the train left the platform of Baltimore. It\r\ntravelled at a speed of 160 miles in the hour. But what was this speed\r\ncompared with that which had carried the three heroes from the mouth of\r\nthe Columbiad?\r\n\r\nThus they sped from one town to the other, finding whole populations\r\nat table on their road, saluting them with the same acclamations,\r\nlavishing the same bravos! They travelled in this way through the east\r\nof the Union, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine,\r\nand New Hampshire; the north and the west by New York, Ohio, Michigan,\r\nand Wisconsin; returning to the south by Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas,\r\nTexas, and Louisiana; they went to the southeast by Alabama and Florida,\r\ngoing up by Georgia and the Carolinas, visiting the centre by Tennessee,\r\nKentucky, Virginia, and Indiana, and, after quitting the Washington\r\nstation, re-entered Baltimore, where for four days one would have thought\r\nthat the United States of America were seated at one immense banquet,\r\nsaluting them simultaneously with the same hurrahs! The apotheosis was\r\nworthy of these three heroes whom fable would have placed in the rank of\r\ndemigods.\r\n\r\nAnd now will this attempt, unprecedented in the annals of travels, lead\r\nto any practical result? Will direct communication with the moon ever be\r\nestablished? Will they ever lay the foundation of a travelling service\r\nthrough the solar world? Will they go from one planet to another, from\r\nJupiter to Mercury, and after awhile from one star to another, from the\r\nPolar to Sirius? Will this means of locomotion allow us to visit those\r\nsuns which swarm in the firmament?\r\n\r\nTo such questions no answer can be given. But knowing the bold ingenuity\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon race, no one would be astonished if the Americans seek\r\nto make some use of President Barbicane's attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: THE APOTHEOSIS WAS WORTHY OF THE THREE HEROES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, some time after the return of the travellers, the public received\r\nwith marked favour the announcement of a company, limited, with a capital\r\nof a hundred million of dollars, divided into a hundred thousand shares\r\nof a thousand dollars each, under the name of the \"_National Company\r\nof Interstellary Communication._\" President Barbicane; Vice-president,\r\nCaptain Nicholl; Secretary, J. T. Maston; Director of Movements, Michel\r\nArdan.\r\n\r\nAnd as it is part of the American temperament to foresee everything in\r\nbusiness, even failure, the Honourable Harry Trolloppe, judge commissioner,\r\nand Francis Drayton, magistrate, were nominated beforehand!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nMinor inconsistencies in the spelling of character names have been\r\nregularized.\r\n\r\nThe spelling of the names of historical scientists \"Bœer and Moedler\"\r\nhave been regularized to be consistent as possible with the author's\r\ninconsistent spelling, which today are spelled variously but perhaps\r\nmost commonly \"Beer and Moedler\".\r\n\r\nObvious minor typesetting errors have been silently corrected.",
