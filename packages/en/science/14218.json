There must be some extraordinary difficulty in the way of\r\ndisentangling the steps of those changes wherein substances of one\r\nkind are produced from substances totally unlike them. To inquire how\r\nthose of acute intellects and much learning regarded such occurrences\r\nin the times when man's outlook on the world was very different from\r\nwhat it is now, ought to be interesting, and the results of that\r\ninquiry must surely be instructive.\r\n\r\nIf the reader turns to a modern book on chemistry (for instance, _The\r\nStory of the Chemical Elements_, in this series), he will find, at\r\nfirst, superficial descriptions of special instances of those\r\noccurrences which are the subject of the chemist's study; he will\r\nlearn that only certain parts of such events are dealt with in\r\nchemistry; more accurate descriptions will then be given of changes\r\nwhich occur in nature, or can be produced by altering the ordinary\r\nconditions, and the reader will be taught to see certain points of\r\nlikeness between these changes; he will be shown how to disentangle\r\nchemical occurrences, to find their similarities and differences; and,\r\ngradually, he will feel his way to general statements, which are more\r\nor less rigorous and accurate expressions of what holds good in a\r\nlarge number of chemical processes; finally, he will discover that\r\nsome generalisations have been made which are exact and completely\r\naccurate descriptions applicable to every case of chemical change.\r\n\r\nBut if we turn to the writings of the alchemists, we are in a\r\ndifferent world. There is nothing even remotely resembling what one\r\nfinds in a modern book on chemistry.\r\n\r\nHere are a few quotations from alchemical writings [1]:\r\n\r\n   [1] Most of the quotations from alchemical writings, in this\r\n   book, are taken from a series of translations, published in\r\n   1893-94, under the supervision of Mr A.E. Waite.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"It is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to\r\n  draw out its soul.... Copper is like a man; it has a soul and a\r\n  body ... the soul is the most subtile part ... that is to say, the\r\n  tinctorial spirit. The body is the ponderable, material,\r\n  terrestrial thing, endowed with a shadow.... After a series of\r\n  suitable treatments copper becomes without shadow and better than\r\n  gold.... The elements grow and are transmuted, because it is their\r\n  qualities, not their substances which are contrary.\" (Stephanus of\r\n  Alexandria, about 620 A.D.)\r\n\r\n  \"If we would elicit our Medecine from the precious metals, we must\r\n  destroy the particular metalic form, without impairing its\r\n  specific properties. The specific properties of the metal have\r\n  their abode in its spiritual part, which resides in homogeneous\r\n  water. Thus we must destroy the particular form of gold, and\r\n  change it into its generic homogeneous water, in which the spirit\r\n  of gold is preserved; this spirit afterwards restores the\r\n  consistency of its water, and brings forth a new form (after the\r\n  necessary putrefaction) a thousand times more perfect than the\r\n  form of gold which it lost by being reincrudated.\" (Philalethes,\r\n  17th century.)\r\n\r\n  \"The bodily nature of things is a concealing outward vesture.\"\r\n  (Michael Sendivogius, 17th century.)\r\n\r\n  \"Nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance, but\r\n  in the virtue ... the less there is of body, the more in\r\n  proportion is the virtue.\" (Paracelsus, 16th century.)\r\n\r\n  \"There are four elements, and each has at its centre another\r\n  element which makes it what it is. These are the four pillars of\r\n  the world.... It is their contrary action which keeps up the\r\n  harmony and equilibrium of the mundane machinery.\" (Michael\r\n  Sendivogius.)\r\n\r\n  \"Nature cannot work till it has been supplied with a material: the\r\n  first matter is furnished by God, the second matter by the sage.\"\r\n  (Michael Sendivogius.)\r\n\r\n  \"When corruptible elements are united in a certain substance,\r\n  their strife must sooner or later bring about its decomposition,\r\n  which is, of course, followed by putrefaction; in putrefaction,\r\n  the impure is separated from the pure; and if the pure elements\r\n  are then once more joined together by the action of natural heat,\r\n  a much nobler and higher form of life is produced.... If the\r\n  hidden central fire, which during life was in a state of\r\n  passivity, obtain the mastery, it attracts to itself all the pure\r\n  elements, which are thus separated from the impure, and form the\r\n  nucleus of a far purer form of life.\" (Michael Sendivogius.)\r\n\r\n  \"Cause that which is above to be below; that which is visible to\r\n  be invisible; that which is palpable to become impalpable. Again\r\n  let that which is below become that which is above; let the\r\n  invisible become visible, and the impalpable become palpable. Here\r\n  you see the perfection of our Art, without any defect or\r\n  diminution.\" (Basil Valentine, 15th century.)\r\n\r\n  \"Think most diligently about this; often bear in mind, observe and\r\n  comprehend, that all minerals and metals together, in the same\r\n  time, and after the same fashion, and of one and the same\r\n  principal matter, are produced and generated. That matter is no\r\n  other than a mere vapour, which is extracted from the elementary\r\n  earth by the superior stars, or by a sidereal distillation of the\r\n  macrocosm; which sidereal hot infusion, with an airy sulphurous\r\n  property, descending upon inferiors, so acts and operates as that\r\n  there is implanted, spiritually and invisibly, a certain power and\r\n  virtue in those metals and minerals; which fume, moreover,\r\n  resolves in the earth into a certain water, wherefrom all metals\r\n  are thenceforth generated and ripened to their perfection, and\r\n  thence proceeds this or that metal or mineral, according as one of\r\n  the three principles acquires dominion, and they have much or\r\n  little of sulphur and salt, or an unequal mixture of these; whence\r\n  some metals are fixed--that is, constant or stable; and some are\r\n  volatile and easily changeable, as is seen in gold, silver,\r\n  copper, iron, tin, and lead.\" (Basil Valentine.)\r\n\r\n  \"To grasp the invisible elements, to attract them by their\r\n  material correspondences, to control, purify, and transform them\r\n  by the living power of the Spirit--this is true Alchemy.\"\r\n  (Paracelsus.)\r\n\r\n  \"Destruction perfects that which is good; for the good cannot\r\n  appear on account of that which conceals it.... Each one of the\r\n  visible metals is a concealment of the other six metals.\"\r\n  (Paracelsus.)\r\n\r\nThese sayings read like sentences in a forgotten tongue.\r\n\r\nHumboldt tells of a parrot which had lived with a tribe of American\r\nIndians, and learnt scraps of their language; the tribe totally\r\ndisappeared; the parrot alone remained, and babbled words in the\r\nlanguage which no living human being could understand.\r\n\r\nAre the words I have quoted unintelligible, like the parrot's prating?\r\nPerhaps the language may be reconstructed; perhaps it may be found to\r\nembody something worth a hearing. Success is most likely to come by\r\nconsidering the growth of alchemy; by trying to find the ideas which\r\nwere expressed in the strange tongue; by endeavouring to look at our\r\nsurroundings as the alchemists looked at theirs.\r\n\r\nDo what we will, we always, more or less, construct our own universe.\r\nThe history of science may be described as the history of the\r\nattempts, and the failures, of men \"to see things as they are.\"\r\n\"Nothing is harder,\" said the Latin poet Lucretius, \"than to separate\r\nmanifest facts from doubtful, what straightway the mind adds on of\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nObservations of the changes which are constantly happening in the sky,\r\nand on the earth, must have prompted men long ago to ask whether there\r\nare any limits to the changes of things around them. And this question\r\nmust have become more urgent as working in metals, making colours and\r\ndyes, preparing new kinds of food and drink, producing substances with\r\nsmells and tastes unlike those of familiar objects, and other pursuits\r\nlike these, made men acquainted with transformations which seemed to\r\npenetrate to the very foundations of things.\r\n\r\nCan one thing be changed into any other thing; or, are there classes\r\nof things within each of which change is possible, while the passage\r\nfrom one class to another is not possible? Are all the varied\r\nsubstances seen, tasted, handled, smelt, composed of a limited number\r\nof essentially different things; or, is each fundamentally different\r\nfrom every other substance? Such questions as these must have pressed\r\nfor answers long ago.\r\n\r\nSome of the Greek philosophers who lived four or five hundred years\r\nbefore Christ formed a theory of the transformations of matter, which\r\nis essentially the theory held by naturalists to-day.\r\n\r\nThese philosophers taught that to understand nature we must get\r\nbeneath the superficial qualities of things. \"According to\r\nconvention,\" said Democritus (born 460 B.C.), \"there are a sweet and a\r\nbitter, a hot and a cold, and according to convention there is\r\ncolour. In truth there are atoms and a void.\" Those investigators\r\nattempted to connect all the differences which are observed between\r\nthe qualities of things with differences of size, shape, position, and\r\nmovement of atoms. They said that all things are formed by the\r\ncoalescence of certain unchangeable, indestructible, and impenetrable\r\nparticles which they named atoms; the total number of atoms is\r\nconstant; not one of them can be destroyed, nor can one be created;\r\nwhen a substance ceases to exist and another is formed, the process is\r\nnot a destruction of matter, it is a re-arrangement of atoms.\r\n\r\nOnly fragments of the writings of the founders of the atomic theory\r\nhave come to us. The views of these philosophers are preserved, and\r\ndoubtless amplified and modified, in a Latin poem, _Concerning the\r\nNature of Things_, written by Lucretius, who was born a century before\r\nthe beginning of our era. Let us consider the picture given in that\r\npoem of the material universe, and the method whereby the picture was\r\nproduced.[2]\r\n\r\n   [2] The quotations from Lucretius are taken from Munro's\r\n   translation (4th Edition, 1886).\r\n\r\nAll knowledge, said Lucretius, is based on \"the aspect and the law of\r\nnature.\" True knowledge can be obtained only by the use of the senses;\r\nthere is no other method. \"From the senses first has proceeded the\r\nknowledge of the true, and the senses cannot be refuted. Shall reason,\r\nfounded on false sense, be able to contradict [the senses], wholly\r\nfounded as it is on the senses? And if they are not true, then all\r\nreason as well is rendered false.\" The first principle in nature is\r\nasserted by Lucretius to be that \"Nothing is ever gotten out of\r\nnothing.\" \"A thing never returns to nothing, but all things after\r\ndisruption go back to the first bodies of matter.\" If there were not\r\nimperishable seeds of things, atoms, \"first-beginnings of solid\r\nsingleness,\" then, Lucretius urges, \"infinite time gone by and lapse\r\nof days must have eaten up all things that are of mortal body.\"\r\n\r\nThe first-beginnings, or atoms, of things were thought of by Lucretius\r\nas always moving; \"there is no lowest point in the sum of the\r\nuniverse\" where they can rest; they meet, clash, rebound, or sometimes\r\njoin together into groups of atoms which move about as wholes. Change,\r\ngrowth, decay, formation, disruption--these are the marks of all\r\nthings. \"The war of first-beginnings waged from eternity is carried on\r\nwith dubious issue: now here, now there, the life-bringing elements of\r\nthings get the mastery, and are o'ermastered in turn; with the funeral\r\nwail blends the cry which babies raise when they enter the borders of\r\nlight; and no night ever followed day, nor morning night, that heard\r\nnot, mingling with the sickly infant's cries, the attendants' wailings\r\non death and black funeral.\"\r\n\r\nLucretius pictured the atoms of things as like the things perceived by\r\nthe senses; he said that atoms of different kinds have different\r\nshapes, but the number of shapes is finite, because there is a limit\r\nto the number of different things we see, smell, taste, and handle; he\r\nimplies, although I do not think he definitely asserts, that all atoms\r\nof one kind are identical in every respect.\r\n\r\nWe now know that many compounds exist which are formed by the union of\r\nthe same quantities by weight of the same elements, and, nevertheless,\r\ndiffer in properties; modern chemistry explains this fact by saying\r\nthat the properties of a substance depend, not only on the kind of\r\natoms which compose the minute particles of a compound, and the number\r\nof atoms of each kind, but also on the mode of arrangement of the\r\natoms.[3] The same doctrine was taught by Lucretius, two thousand\r\nyears ago. \"It often makes a great difference,\" he said, \"with what\r\nthings, and in what positions the same first-beginnings are held in\r\nunion, and what motions they mutually impart and receive.\" For\r\ninstance, certain atoms may be so arranged at one time as to produce\r\nfire, and, at another time, the arrangement of the same atoms may be\r\nsuch that the result is a fir-tree. The differences between the\r\ncolours of things are said by Lucretius to be due to differences in\r\nthe arrangements and motions of atoms. As the colour of the sea when\r\nwind lashes it into foam is different from the colour when the waters\r\nare at rest, so do the colours of things change when the atoms whereof\r\nthe things are composed change from one arrangement to another, or\r\nfrom sluggish movements to rapid and tumultuous motions.\r\n\r\n   [3] See the chapter _Molecular Architecture_ in the _Story of\r\n   the Chemical Elements_.\r\n\r\nLucretius pictured a solid substance as a vast number of atoms\r\nsqueezed closely together, a liquid as composed of not so many atoms\r\nless tightly packed, and a gas as a comparatively small number of\r\natoms with considerable freedom of motion. Essentially the same\r\npicture is presented by the molecular theory of to-day.\r\n\r\nTo meet the objection that atoms are invisible, and therefore cannot\r\nexist, Lucretius enumerates many things we cannot see although we know\r\nthey exist. No one doubts the existence of winds, heat, cold and\r\nsmells; yet no one has seen the wind, or heat, or cold, or a smell.\r\nClothes become moist when hung near the sea, and dry when spread in\r\nthe sunshine; but no one has seen the moisture entering or leaving the\r\nclothes. A pavement trodden by many feet is worn away; but the minute\r\nparticles are removed without our eyes being able to see them.\r\n\r\nAnother objector urges--\"You say the atoms are always moving, yet the\r\nthings we look at, which you assert to be vast numbers of moving\r\natoms, are often motionless.\" Him Lucretius answers by an analogy.\r\n\"And herein you need not wonder at this, that though the\r\nfirst-beginnings of things are all in motion, yet the sum is seen to\r\nrest in supreme repose, unless when a thing exhibits motions with its\r\nindividual body. For all the nature of first things lies far away from\r\nour senses, beneath their ken; and, therefore, since they are\r\nthemselves beyond what you can see, they must withdraw from sight\r\ntheir motion as well; and the more so, that the things which we can\r\nsee do yet often conceal their motions when a great distance off.\r\nThus, often, the woolly flocks as they crop the glad pastures on a\r\nhill, creep on whither the grass, jewelled with fresh dew, summons or\r\ninvites each, and the lambs, fed to the full, gambol and playfully\r\nbutt; all which objects appear to us from a distance to be blended\r\ntogether, and to rest like a white spot on a green hill. Again, when\r\nmighty legions fill with their movements all parts of the plains,\r\nwaging the mimicry of war, the glitter lifts itself up to the sky, and\r\nthe whole earth round gleams with brass, and beneath a noise is raised\r\nby the mighty tramplings of men, and the mountains, stricken by the\r\nshouting, echo the voices to the stars of heaven, and horsemen fly\r\nabout, and suddenly wheeling, scour across the middle of the plains,\r\nshaking them with the vehemence of their charge. And yet there is some\r\nspot on the high hills, seen from which they appear to stand still and\r\nto rest on the plains as a bright spot.\"\r\n\r\nThe atomic theory of the Greek thinkers was constructed by reasoning\r\non natural phenomena. Lucretius constantly appeals to observed facts\r\nfor confirmation of his theoretical teachings, or refutation of\r\nopinions he thought erroneous. Besides giving a general mental\r\npresentation of the material universe, the theory was applied to many\r\nspecific transmutations; but minute descriptions of what are now\r\ncalled chemical changes could not be given in terms of the theory,\r\nbecause no searching examination of so much as one such change had\r\nbeen made, nor, I think, one may say, could be made under the\r\nconditions of Greek life. More than two thousand years passed before\r\ninvestigators began to make accurate measurements of the quantities of\r\nthe substances which take part in those changes wherein certain\r\nthings seem to be destroyed and other totally different things to be\r\nproduced; until accurate knowledge had been obtained of the quantities\r\nof the definite substances which interact in the transformations of\r\nmatter, the atomic theory could not do more than draw the outlines of\r\na picture of material changes.\r\n\r\nA scientific theory has been described as \"the likening of our\r\nimaginings to what we actually observe.\" So long as we observe only in\r\nthe rough, only in a broad and general way, our imaginings must also\r\nbe rough, broad, and general. It was the great glory of the Greek\r\nthinkers about natural events that their observations were accurate,\r\non the whole, and as far as they went, and the theory they formed was\r\nbased on no trivial or accidental features of the facts, but on what\r\nhas proved to be the very essence of the phenomena they sought to\r\nbring into one point of view; for all the advances made in our own\r\ntimes in clear knowledge of the transformations of matter have been\r\nmade by using, as a guide to experimental inquiries, the conception\r\nthat the differences between the qualities of substances are connected\r\nwith differences in the weights and movements of minute particles; and\r\nthis was the central idea of the atomic theory of the Greek\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nThe atomic theory was used by the great physicists of the later\r\nRenaissance, by Galileo, Gassendi, Newton and others. Our own\r\ncountryman, John Dalton, while trying (in the early years of the 19th\r\ncentury) to form a mental presentation of the atmosphere in terms of\r\nthe theory of atoms, rediscovered the possibility of differences\r\nbetween the sizes of atoms, applied this idea to the facts concerning\r\nthe quantitative compositions of compounds which had been established\r\nby others, developed a method for determining the relative weights of\r\natoms of different kinds, and started chemistry on the course which it\r\nhas followed so successfully.\r\n\r\nInstead of blaming the Greek philosophers for lack of quantitatively\r\naccurate experimental inquiry, we should rather be full of admiring\r\nwonder at the extraordinary acuteness of their mental vision, and the\r\nsoundness of their scientific spirit.\r\n\r\nThe ancient atomists distinguished the essential properties of things\r\nfrom their accidental features. The former cannot be removed,\r\nLucretius said, without \"utter destruction accompanying the\r\nseverance\"; the latter may be altered \"while the nature of the thing\r\nremains unharmed.\" As examples of essential properties, Lucretius\r\nmentions \"the weight of a stone, the heat of fire, the fluidity of\r\nwater.\" Such things as liberty, war, slavery, riches, poverty, and the\r\nlike, were accounted accidents. Time also was said to be an accident:\r\nit \"exists not by itself; but simply from the things which happen, the\r\nsense apprehends what has been done in time past, as well as what is\r\npresent, and what is to follow after.\"\r\n\r\nAs our story proceeds, we shall see that the chemists of the middle\r\nages, the alchemists, founded their theory of material changes on the\r\ndifference between a supposed essential substratum of things, and\r\ntheir qualities which could be taken off, they said, and put on, as\r\nclothes are removed and replaced.\r\n\r\nHow different from the clear, harmonious, orderly, Greek scheme, is\r\nany picture we can form, from such quotations as I have given from\r\ntheir writings, of the alchemists' conception of the world. The Greeks\r\nlikened their imaginings of nature to the natural facts they observed;\r\nthe alchemists created an imaginary world after their own likeness.\r\n\r\nWhile Christianity was superseding the old religions, and the\r\ntheological system of the Christian Church was replacing the\r\ncosmogonies of the heathen, the contrast between the power of evil and\r\nthe power of good was more fully realised than in the days of the\r\nGreeks; a sharper division was drawn between this world and another\r\nworld, and that other world was divided into two irreconcilable and\r\nabsolutely opposite parts. Man came to be regarded as the centre of a\r\ntremendous and never-ceasing battle, urged between the powers of good\r\nand the powers of evil. The sights and sounds of nature were regarded\r\nas the vestments, or the voices, of the unseen combatants. Life was at\r\nonce very real and the mere shadow of a dream. The conditions were\r\nfavourable to the growth of magic; for man was regarded as the measure\r\nof the universe, the central figure in an awful tragedy.\r\n\r\nMagic is an attempt, by thinking and speculating about what we\r\nconsider must be the order of nature, to discover some means of\r\npenetrating into the secret life of natural things, of realising the\r\nhidden powers and virtues of things, grasping the concealed thread of\r\nunity which is supposed to run through all phenomena however seemingly\r\ndiverse, entering into sympathy with the supposed inner oneness of\r\nlife, death, the present, past, and future. Magic grows, and gathers\r\nstrength, when men are sure their theory of the universe must be the\r\none true theory, and they see only through the glasses which their\r\ntheory supplies. \"He who knows himself thoroughly knows God and all\r\nthe mysteries of His nature,\" says a modern writer on magic. That\r\nsaying expresses the fundamental hypothesis, and the method, of all\r\nsystems of magic and mysticism. Of such systems, alchemy was one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA SKETCH OF ALCHEMICAL THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system which began to be called _alchemy_ in the 6th and 7th\r\ncenturies of our era had no special name before that time, but was\r\nknown as _the sacred art, the divine science, the occult science, the\r\nart of Hermes_.\r\n\r\nA commentator on Aristotle, writing in the 4th century A.D., calls\r\ncertain instruments used for fusion and calcination \"_chuika organa_,\"\r\nthat is, instruments for melting and pouring. Hence, probably, came\r\nthe adjective _chyic_ or _chymic_, and, at a somewhat later time, the\r\nword _chemia_ as the name of that art which deals with calcinations,\r\nfusions, meltings, and the like. The writer of a treatise on\r\nastrology, in the 5th century, speaking of the influences of the stars\r\non the dispositions of man, says: \"If a man is born under Mercury he\r\nwill give himself to astronomy; if Mars, he will follow the profession\r\nof arms; if Saturn, he will devote himself to the science of alchemy\r\n(_Scientia alchemiae_).\" The word _alchemia_ which appears in this\r\ntreatise, was formed by prefixing the Arabic _al_ (meaning _the_) to\r\n_chemia_, a word, as we have seen, of Greek origin.\r\n\r\nIt is the growth, development, and transformation into chemistry, of\r\nthis _alchemia_ which we have to consider.\r\n\r\nAlchemy, that is, _the_ art of melting, pouring, and transforming,\r\nmust necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles,\r\nfurnaces, alembics, and other vessels wherein things are fused,\r\ndistilled, calcined, and dissolved. The old drawings of alchemical\r\noperations show us men busy calcining, cohobating, distilling,\r\ndissolving, digesting, and performing other processes of like\r\ncharacter to these.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in\r\ntheir laboratories. Paracelsus (16th century) says of them: \"They are\r\nnot given to idleness, nor go in a proud habit, or plush and velvet\r\ngarments, often showing their rings on their fingers, or wearing\r\nswords with silver hilts by their sides, or fine and gay gloves on\r\ntheir hands; but diligently follow their labours, sweating whole days\r\nand nights by their furnaces. They do not spend their time abroad for\r\nrecreation, but take delight in their laboratories. They put their\r\nfingers among coals, into clay and filth, not into gold rings. They\r\nare sooty and black, like smiths and miners, and do not pride\r\nthemselves upon clean and beautiful faces.\"\r\n\r\nIn these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the\r\npractice of the alchemists who were his predecessors. You can nose a\r\nchemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about\r\nhim; you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes. He\r\nalso \"takes delight in his laboratory\"; he does not always \"pride\r\nhimself on a clean and beautiful face\"; he \"sweats whole days and\r\nnights by his furnace.\"\r\n\r\nWhy does the chemist toil so eagerly? Why did the alchemists so\r\nuntiringly pursue their quest? I think it is not unfair to say: the\r\nchemist experiments in order that he \"may liken his imaginings to the\r\nfacts which he observes\"; the alchemist toiled that he might liken the\r\nfacts which he observed to his imaginings. The difference may be put\r\nin another way by saying: the chemist's object is to discover \"how\r\nchanges happen in combinations of the unchanging\"; the alchemist's\r\nendeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion, \"that\r\nevery substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities, and\r\ncan be brought outward and forward into perfection.\"\r\n\r\nLooking around him, and observing the changes of things, the alchemist\r\nwas deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and\r\nanimals; he argued that minerals and metals also grow, change,\r\ndevelop. He said in effect: \"Nature is one, there must be unity in all\r\nthe diversity I see. When a grain of corn falls into the earth it\r\ndies, but this dying is the first step towards a new life; the dead\r\nseed is changed into the living plant. So it must be with all other\r\nthings in nature: the mineral, or the metal, seems dead when it is\r\nburied in the earth, but, in reality, it is growing, changing, and\r\nbecoming more perfect.\" The perfection of the seed is the plant. What\r\nis the perfection of the common metals? \"Evidently,\" the alchemist\r\nreplied, \"the perfect metal is gold; the common metals are trying to\r\nbecome gold.\" \"Gold is the intention of Nature in regard to all\r\nmetals,\" said an alchemical writer. Plants are preserved by the\r\npreservation of their seed. \"In like manner,\" the alchemist's argument\r\nproceeded, \"there must be a seed in metals which is their essence; if\r\nI can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions, I\r\ncan cause it to grow into the perfect metal.\" \"Animal life, and human\r\nlife also,\" we may suppose the alchemist saying, \"are continued by the\r\nsame method as that whereby the life of plants is continued; all life\r\nsprings from seed; the seed is fructified by the union of the male and\r\nthe female; in metals also there must be the two characters; the union\r\nof these is needed for the production of new metals; the conjoining of\r\nmetals must go before the birth of the perfect metal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" we may suppose the argument to proceed, \"now, the passage from\r\nthe imperfect to the more perfect is not easy. It is harder to\r\npractise virtue than to acquiesce in vice; virtue comes not naturally\r\nto man; that he may gain the higher life, he must be helped by grace.\r\nTherefore, the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect\r\ngold, of developing the lower order into the higher, is not easy. If\r\nNature does this, she does it slowly and painfully; if the exaltation\r\nof the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly, it\r\ncan be done only by the help of man.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as I can judge from their writings, the argument of the\r\nalchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing. A\r\ncareful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on\r\na (supposed) intimate knowledge of nature's plan of working, and the\r\ncertainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan.\r\n\r\nThat the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature,\r\nand their own knowledge of the ways of nature's work, is apparent from\r\ntheir writings.\r\n\r\nThe author of _The New Chemical Light_ (17th century) says:\r\n\"Simplicity is the seal of truth.... Nature is wonderfully simple, and\r\nthe characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all\r\nthat is true and noble in Nature.\" In another place the same author\r\nsays: \"Nature is one, true, simple, self-contained, created of God,\r\nand informed with a certain universal spirit.\" The same author,\r\nMichael Sendivogius, remarks: \"It may be asked how I come to have this\r\nknowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human\r\nken. My answer is that the sages have been taught by God that this\r\nnatural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and\r\nspiritual pattern; that the very existence of this world is based upon\r\nthe reality of its heavenly archetype.... Thus the sage sees heaven\r\nreflected in Nature as in a mirror, and he pursues this Art, not for\r\nthe sake of gold or silver, but for the love of the knowledge which it\r\nreveals.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Only True Way_ advises all who wish to become true alchemists to\r\nleave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers, and to follow\r\nnature, which is simple; the complicated processes described in books\r\nare said to be the traps laid by the \"cunning sophists\" to catch the\r\nunwary.\r\n\r\nIn _A Catechism of Alchemy_, Paracelsus asks: \"What road should the\r\nphilosopher follow?\" He answers, \"That exactly which was followed by\r\nthe Great Architect of the Universe in the creation of the world.\"\r\n\r\nOne might suppose it would be easier, and perhaps more profitable, to\r\nexamine, observe, and experiment, than to turn one's eyes inwards with\r\nthe hope of discovering exactly \"the road followed by the Great\r\nArchitect of the Universe in the creation of the world.\" But the\r\nalchemical method found it easier to begin by introspection. The\r\nalchemist spun his universe from his own ideas of order, symmetry, and\r\nsimplicity, as the spider spins her web from her own substance.\r\n\r\nA favourite saying of the alchemists was, \"What is above is as what is\r\nbelow.\" In one of its aspects this saying meant, \"processes happen\r\nwithin the earth like those which occur on the earth; minerals and\r\nmetals live, as animals and plants live; all pass through corruption\r\ntowards perfection.\" In another aspect the saying meant \"the human\r\nbeing is the world in miniature; as is the microcosm, so is the\r\nmacrocosm; to know oneself is to know all the world.\"\r\n\r\nEvery man knows he ought to try to rise to better things, and many men\r\nendeavour to do what they know they ought to do; therefore, he who\r\nfeels sure that all nature is fashioned after the image of man,\r\nprojects his own ideas of progress, development, virtue, matter and\r\nspirit, on to nature outside himself; and, as a matter of course, this\r\nkind of naturalist uses the same language when he is speaking of the\r\nchanges of material things as he employs to express the changes of his\r\nmental states, his hopes, fears, aspirations, and struggles.\r\n\r\nThe language of the alchemists was, therefore, rich in such\r\nexpressions as these; \"the elements are to be so conjoined that the\r\nnobler and fuller life may be produced\"; \"our arcanum is gold exalted\r\nto the highest degree of perfection to which the combined action of\r\nnature and art can develop it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch commingling of ethical and physical ideas, such application of\r\nmoral conceptions to material phenomena, was characteristic of the\r\nalchemical method of regarding nature. The necessary results were;\r\ngreat confusion of thought, much mystification of ideas, and a\r\nsuperabundance of _views_ about natural events.\r\n\r\nWhen the author of _The Metamorphosis of Metals_ was seeking for an\r\nargument in favour of his view, that water is the source and primal\r\nelement of all things, he found what he sought in the Biblical text:\r\n\"In the beginning the spirit of God moved upon the face of the\r\nwaters.\" Similarly, the author of _The Sodic Hydrolith_ clenches his\r\nargument in favour of the existence of the Philosopher's Stone, by the\r\nquotation: \"Therefore, thus saith the Lord; behold I lay in Zion for a\r\nfoundation a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious corner Stone, a sure\r\nfoundation. He that has it shall not be confounded.\" This author works\r\nout in detail an analogy between the functions and virtues of the\r\n_Stone_, and the story of man's fall and redemption, as set forth in\r\nthe Old and New Testaments. The same author speaks of \"Satan, that\r\ngrim pseudo-alchemist.\"\r\n\r\nThat the attribution, by the alchemists, of moral virtues and vices to\r\nnatural things was in keeping with some deep-seated tendency of human\r\nnature, is shown by the persistence of some of their methods of\r\nstating the properties of substances: we still speak of \"perfect and\r\nimperfect gases,\" \"noble and base metals,\" \"good and bad conductors of\r\nelectricity,\" and \"laws governing natural phenomena.\"\r\n\r\nConvinced of the simplicity of nature, certain that all natural events\r\nfollow one course, sure that this course was known to them and was\r\nrepresented by the growth of plants and animals, the alchemists set\r\nthemselves the task, firstly, of proving by observations and\r\nexperiments that their view of natural occurrences was correct; and,\r\nsecondly, of discovering and gaining possession of the instrument\r\nwhereby nature effects her transmutations and perfects her operations.\r\nThe mastery of this instrument would give them power to change any\r\nmetal into gold, the cure of all diseases, and the happiness which\r\nmust come from the practical knowledge of the supreme secret of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe central quest of alchemy was the quest of an undefined and\r\nundefinable something wherein was supposed to be contained all the\r\npowers and potencies of life, and whatever makes life worth living.\r\n\r\nThe names given to this mystical something were as many as the\r\nproperties which were assigned to it. It was called _the one thing,\r\nthe essence, the philosopher's stone, the stone of wisdom, the\r\nheavenly balm, the divine water, the virgin water, the carbuncle of\r\nthe sun, the old dragon, the lion, the basilisk, the phoenix_; and\r\nmany other names were given to it.\r\n\r\nWe may come near to expressing the alchemist's view of the essential\r\ncharacter of the object of their search by naming it _the soul of all\r\nthings_. \"Alchemy,\" a modern writer says, \"is the science of the soul\r\nof all things.\"\r\n\r\nThe essence was supposed to have a material form, an ethereal or\r\nmiddle nature, and an immaterial or spiritual life.\r\n\r\nNo one might hope to make this essence from any one substance,\r\nbecause, as one of the alchemists says, \"It is the attribute of God\r\nalone to make one out of one; you must produce one thing out of two\r\nby natural generation.\" The alchemists did not pretend to create gold,\r\nbut only to produce it from other things.\r\n\r\nThe author of _A Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby_ says: \"We do not,\r\nas is sometimes said, profess to create gold and silver, but only to\r\nfind an agent which ... is capable of entering into an intimate and\r\nmaturing union with the Mercury of the base metals.\" And again: \"Our\r\nArt ... only arrogates to itself the power of developing, through the\r\nremoval of all defects and superfluities, the golden nature which the\r\nbaser metals possess.\" Bonus, in his tract on _The New Pearl of Great\r\nPrice_ (16th century), says: \"The Art of Alchemy ... does not create\r\nmetals, or even develop them out of the metallic first-substance; it\r\nonly takes up the unfinished handicraft of Nature and completes it....\r\nNature has only left a comparatively small thing for the artist to\r\ndo--the completion of that which she has already begun.\"\r\n\r\nIf the essence were ever attained, it would be by following the course\r\nwhich nature follows in producing the perfect plant from the imperfect\r\nseed, by discovering and separating the seed of metals, and bringing\r\nthat seed under the conditions which alone are suitable for its\r\ngrowth. Metals must have seed, the alchemists said, for it would be\r\nabsurd to suppose they have none. \"What prerogative have vegetables\r\nabove metals,\" exclaims one of them, \"that God should give seed to the\r\none and withhold it from the other? Are not metals as much in His\r\nsight as trees?\"\r\n\r\nAs metals, then, possess seed, it is evident how this seed is to be\r\nmade active; the seed of a plant is quickened by descending into the\r\nearth, therefore the seed of metals must be destroyed before it\r\nbecomes life-producing. \"The processes of our art must begin with\r\ndissolution of gold; they must terminate in a restoration of the\r\nessential quality of gold.\" \"Gold does not easily give up its nature,\r\nand will fight for its life; but our agent is strong enough to\r\novercome and kill it, and then it also has power to restore it to\r\nlife, and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body.\"\r\n\r\nThe application of the doctrine of the existence of seed in metals led\r\nto the performance of many experiments, and, hence, to the\r\naccumulation of a considerable body of facts established by\r\nexperimental inquiries. The belief of the alchemists that all natural\r\nevents are connected by a hidden thread, that everything has an\r\ninfluence on other things, that \"what is above is as what is below,\"\r\nconstrained them to place stress on the supposed connexion between the\r\nplanets and the metals, and to further their metallic transformations\r\nby performing them at times when certain planets were in conjunction.\r\nThe seven principal planets and the seven principal metals were called\r\nby the same names: _Sol_ (gold), _Luna_ (silver), _Saturn_ (lead),\r\n_Jupiter_ (tin), _Mars_ (iron), _Venus_ (copper), and _Mercury_\r\n(mercury). The author of _The New Chemical Light_ taught that one\r\nmetal could be propagated from another only in the order of\r\nsuperiority of the planets. He placed the seven planets in the\r\nfollowing descending order: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus,\r\nMercury, Luna. \"The virtues of the planets descend,\" he said, \"but do\r\nnot ascend\"; it is easy to change Mars (iron) into Venus (copper), for\r\ninstance, but Venus cannot be transformed into Mars.\r\n\r\nAlthough the alchemists regarded everything as influencing, and\r\ninfluenced by, other things, they were persuaded that the greatest\r\neffects are produced on a substance by substances of like nature with\r\nitself. Hence, most of them taught that the seed of metals will be\r\nobtained by operations with metals, not by the action on metals of\r\nthings of animal or vegetable origin. Each class of substances, they\r\nsaid, has a life, or spirit (an essential character, we might say) of\r\nits own. \"The life of sulphur,\" Paracelsus said, \"is a combustible,\r\nill-smelling, fatness.... The life of gems and corals is mere\r\ncolour.... The life of water is its flowing.... The life of fire is\r\nair.\" Grant an attraction of like to like, and the reason becomes\r\napparent for such directions as these: \"Nothing heterogeneous must be\r\nintroduced into our magistery\"; \"Everything should be made to act on\r\nthat which is like it, and then Nature will perform her duty.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough each class of substances was said by the alchemists to have\r\nits own particular character, or life, nevertheless they taught that\r\nthere is a deep-seated likeness between all things, inasmuch as the\r\npower of _the essence_, or _the one thing_, is so great that under its\r\ninfluence different things are produced from the same origin, and\r\ndifferent things are caused to pass into and become the same thing.\r\nIn _The New Chemical Light_ it is said: \"While the seed of all things\r\nis one, it is made to generate a great variety of things.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not easy now--it could not have been easy at any time--to give\r\nclear and exact meanings to the doctrines of the alchemists, or the\r\ndirections they gave for performing the operations necessary for the\r\nproduction of the object of their search. And the difficulty is much\r\nincreased when we are told that \"The Sage jealously conceals [his\r\nknowledge] from the sinner and the scornful, lest the mysteries of\r\nheaven should be laid bare to the vulgar gaze.\" We almost despair when\r\nan alchemical writer assures us that the Sages \"Set pen to paper for\r\nthe express purpose of concealing their meaning. The sense of a whole\r\npassage is often hopelessly obscured by the addition or omission of\r\none little word, for instance the addition of the word _not_ in the\r\nwrong place.\" Another writer says: \"The Sages are in the habit of\r\nusing words which may convey either a true or a false impression; the\r\nformer to their own disciples and children, the latter to the\r\nignorant, the foolish, and the unworthy.\" Sometimes, after\r\ndescriptions of processes couched in strange and mystical language,\r\nthe writer will add, \"If you cannot perceive what you ought to\r\nunderstand herein, you should not devote yourself to the study of\r\nphilosophy.\" Philalethes, in his _Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby_,\r\nseems to feel some pity for his readers; after describing what he\r\ncalls \"the generic homogeneous water of gold,\" he says: \"If you wish\r\nfor a more particular description of our water, I am impelled by\r\nmotives of charity to tell you that it is living, flexible, clear,\r\nnitid, white as snow, hot, humid, airy, vaporous, and digestive.\"\r\n\r\nAlchemy began by asserting that nature must be simple; it assumed that\r\na knowledge of the plan and method of natural occurrences is to be\r\nobtained by thinking; and it used analogy as the guide in applying\r\nthis knowledge of nature's design to particular events, especially the\r\nanalogy, assumed by alchemy to exist, between material phenomena and\r\nhuman emotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ALCHEMICAL CONCEPTION OF THE UNITY AND SIMPLICITY OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter I have referred to the frequent use made by\r\nthe alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan,\r\nor at any rate a very similar plan, in all her processes. If this\r\nsupposition is accepted, the primary business of an investigator of\r\nnature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the\r\nsurface to be dissimilar and unconnected events. As this idea, and\r\nthis practice, were the foundations whereon the superstructure of\r\nalchemy was raised, I think it is important to amplify them more fully\r\nthan I have done already.\r\n\r\nMention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage\r\nnamed _Hermes Trismegistus_, who is said to have lived a little later\r\nthan the time of Moses. Representations of Hermes Trismegistus are\r\nfound on ancient Egyptian monuments. We are told that Alexander the\r\nGreat found his tomb near Hebron; and that the tomb contained a slab\r\nof emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written. The eighth\r\nsentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven, and then\r\nagain descend to the earth, and unite together the powers of things\r\nsuperior and things inferior. Thus you will obtain the glory of the\r\nwhole world, and obscurity will fly away from you.\"\r\n\r\nThis sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and\r\nthings on earth, and asserts the possibility of gaining, not merely a\r\ntheoretical, but also a practical, knowledge of the essential\r\ncharacters of all things. Moreover, the sentence implies that this\r\nfruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature, using as\r\nguide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things\r\nabove and things beneath.\r\n\r\nThe alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme: follow nature;\r\nprovided you never lose the clue, which is simplicity and similarity.\r\n\r\nThe author of _The Only Way_ (1677) beseeches his readers \"to enlist\r\nunder the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience\r\nto the teaching of nature ... in short, the method which nature\r\nherself pursues in the bowels of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written\r\ndirections. When one of them has said all he can say, he adds--\"The\r\nquestion is whether even this book will convey any information to one\r\nbefore whom the writings of the Sages and the open book of Nature are\r\nexhibited in vain.\" Another tells his readers the only thing for them\r\nis \"to beseech God to give you the real philosophical temper, and to\r\nopen your eyes to the facts of nature; thus alone will you reach the\r\ncoveted goal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow nature\" is sound advice. But, nature was to be followed with\r\neyes closed save to one vision, and the vision was to be seen before\r\nthe following began.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists' general conception of nature led them to assign to\r\nevery substance a condition or state natural to it, and wherein alone\r\nit could be said to be as it was designed to be. Each substance, they\r\ntaught, could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent, or\r\nnon-natural, means, and any substance which had been driven from its\r\nnatural condition by violence was ready, and even eager, to return to\r\nthe condition consonant with its nature.\r\n\r\nThus Norton, in his _Ordinal of Alchemy_, says: \"Metals are generated\r\nin the earth, for above ground they are subject to rust; hence above\r\nground is the place of corruption of metals, and of their gradual\r\ndestruction. The cause which we assign to this fact is that above\r\nground they are not in their proper element, and an unnatural position\r\nis destructive to natural objects, as we see, for instance, that\r\nfishes die when they are taken out of the water; and as it is natural\r\nfor men, beasts, and birds to live in the air, so stones and metals\r\nare naturally generated under the earth.\"\r\n\r\nIn his _New Pearl of Great Price_ (16th century), Bonus says:--\"The\r\nobject of Nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the\r\nform which properly belongs to it; and this is also the design of our\r\nArt.\"\r\n\r\nThis view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the\r\nsubstances wherewith experiments were performed. It supposed that man\r\ncould act as a guide, to bring back to its natural condition a\r\nsubstance which had been removed from that condition, either by\r\nviolent processes of nature, or by man's device. The alchemist\r\nregarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural\r\ncondition of each substance he dealt with. He thought he could say,\r\n\"this substance ought to be thus, or thus,\" \"that substance is\r\nconstrained, thwarted, hindered from becoming what nature meant it to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nIn Ben Jonson's play called _The Alchemist_, Subtle (who is the\r\nalchemist of the play) says, \" ... metals would be gold if they had\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThe alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material\r\nthings, he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices\r\nof these things. He thought himself able to recall the erring metal to\r\nthe path of metalline virtue, to lead the extravagant mineral back to\r\nthe moral home-life from which it had been seduced, to show the\r\ndoubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking, and to\r\nhelp it to find the unrealised object of its search. The alchemist\r\nacted as a sort of conscience to the metals, minerals, salts, and\r\nother substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory. He\r\ntreated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat\r\nrefractory patient. \"I know what you want better than you do,\" he\r\nseems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining, separating,\r\njoining and subliming.\r\n\r\nBut the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment.\r\nSometimes the patient rebelled. For instance, Michael Sendivogius, in\r\nhis tract, _The New Chemical Light drawn from the Fountain of Nature\r\nand of Manual Experience_ (17th century), recounts _a dialogue between\r\nMercury, the Alchemist, and Nature_.\r\n\r\n\"On a certain bright morning a number of Alchemists met together in a\r\nmeadow, and consulted as to the best way of preparing the\r\nPhilosopher's Stone.... Most of them agreed that Mercury was the first\r\nsubstance. Others said, no, it was sulphur, or something else.... Just\r\nas the dispute began to run high, there arose a violent wind, which\r\ndispersed the Alchemists into all the different countries of the\r\nworld; and as they had arrived at no conclusion, each one went on\r\nseeking the Philosopher's Stone in his own old way, this one expecting\r\nto find it in one substance, and that in another, so that the search\r\nhas continued without intermission even unto this day. One of them,\r\nhowever, had at least got the idea into his head that Mercury was the\r\nsubstance of the Stone, and determined to concentrate all his efforts\r\non the chemical preparation of Mercury.... He took common Mercury and\r\nbegan to work with it. He placed it in a glass vessel over the fire,\r\nwhen it, of course, evaporated. So in his ignorance he struck his\r\nwife, and said: 'No one but you has entered my laboratory; you must\r\nhave taken my Mercury out of the vessel.' The woman, with tears,\r\nprotested her innocence. The Alchemist put some more Mercury into the\r\nvessel.... The Mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous\r\nsteam. Then the Alchemist was full of joy, because he remembered that\r\nthe first substance of the Stone is described by the Sages as\r\nvolatile; and he thought that now at last he _must_ be on the right\r\ntrack. He now began to subject the Mercury to all sorts of chemical\r\nprocesses, to sublime it, and to calcine it with all manner of things,\r\nwith salts, sulphur, metals, minerals, blood, hair, aqua fortis,\r\nherbs, urine, and vinegar.... Everything he could think of was tried;\r\nbut without producing the desired effect.\" The Alchemist then\r\ndespaired; after a dream, wherein an old man came and talked with him\r\nabout the \"Mercury of the Sages,\" the Alchemist thought he would charm\r\nthe Mercury, and so he used a form of incantation. The Mercury\r\nsuddenly began to speak, and asked the Alchemist why he had troubled\r\nhim so much, and so on. The Alchemist replied, and questioned the\r\nMercury. The Mercury makes fun of the philosopher. Then the Alchemist\r\nagain torments the Mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible\r\nthings. At last Mercury calls in the aid of Nature, who soundly rates\r\nthe philosopher, tells him he is grossly ignorant, and ends by saying:\r\n\"The best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the king's\r\nofficers, who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nAs long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon\r\nthe world was framed, that it was possible for them to follow exactly\r\n\"the road which was followed by the Great Architect of the Universe in\r\nthe creation of the world,\" a real knowledge of natural events was\r\nimpossible; for every attempt to penetrate nature's secrets\r\npresupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which\r\nwas to be investigated. But genuine knowledge begins when the\r\ninvestigator admits that he must learn of nature, not nature of him.\r\nIt might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of\r\nnature that \"his foible was omniscience\"; and omniscience negatives\r\nthe attainment of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe alchemical notion of a natural state as proper to each substance\r\nwas vigorously combated by the Honourable Robert Boyle (born 1626,\r\ndied 1691), a man of singularly clear and penetrative intellect. In _A\r\nParadox of the Natural and Supernatural States of Bodies, Especially\r\nof the Air_, Boyle says:--\"I know that not only in living, but even in\r\ninanimate, bodies, of which alone I here discourse, men have\r\nuniversally admitted the famous distinction between the natural and\r\npreternatural, or violent state of bodies, and do daily, without the\r\nleast scruple, found upon it hypotheses and ratiocinations, as if it\r\nwere most certain that what they call nature had purposely formed\r\nbodies in such a determinate state, and were always watchful that they\r\nshould not by any external violence be put out of it. But\r\nnotwithstanding so general a consent of men in this point, I confess,\r\nI cannot yet be satisfied about it in the sense wherein it is wont to\r\nbe taken. It is not, that I believe, that there is no sense in which,\r\nor in the account upon which, a body may he said to be in its natural\r\nstate; but that I think the common distinction of a natural and\r\nviolent state of bodies has not been clearly explained and\r\nconsiderately settled, and both is not well grounded, and is\r\noftentimes ill applied. For when I consider that whatever state a body\r\nbe put into, or kept in, it obtains or retains that state, assenting\r\nto the catholic laws of nature, I cannot think it fit to deny that in\r\nthis sense the body proposed is in a natural state; but then, upon the\r\nsame ground, it will he hard to deny but that those bodies which are\r\nsaid to be in a violent state may also be in a natural one, since the\r\nviolence they are presumed to suffer from outward agents is likewise\r\nexercised no otherwise than according to the established laws of\r\nuniversal nature.\"\r\n\r\nThere must be something very fascinating and comforting in the\r\nalchemical view of nature, as a harmony constructed on one simple\r\nplan, which can be grasped as a whole, and also in its details, by the\r\nintrospective processes of the human intellect; for that conception\r\nprevails to-day among those who have not investigated natural\r\noccurrences for themselves. The alchemical view of nature still forms\r\nthe foundation of systems of ethics, of philosophy, of art. It appeals\r\nto the innate desire of man to make himself the measure of all\r\nthings. It is so easy, so authoritative, apparently so satisfactory.\r\nNo amount of thinking and reasoning will ever demonstrate its falsity.\r\nIt can be conquered only by a patient, unbiassed, searching\r\nexamination of some limited portion of natural events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ALCHEMICAL ELEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals\r\nwas that they should become gold, for gold was considered to be the\r\nmost perfect metal, and nature, they said, evidently strains after\r\nperfection. The alchemist found that metals were worn away, eaten\r\nthrough, broken, and finally caused to disappear, by many acid and\r\nacrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances. But gold\r\nresisted the attacks of these liquids; it was not changed by heat, nor\r\nwas it affected by sulphur, a substance which changed limpid, running\r\nmercury into an inert, black solid. Hence, gold was more perfect in\r\nthe alchemical scale than any other metal.\r\n\r\nSince gold was considered to be the most perfect metal, it was\r\nself-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly\r\nin the earth, must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold.\r\n\r\n\"The only thing that distinguishes one metal from another,\" writes an\r\nalchemist who went under the name of Philalethes, \"is its degree of\r\nmaturity, which is, of course, greatest in the most precious metals;\r\nthe difference between gold and lead is not one of substance, but of\r\ndigestion; in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to\r\npurge out its metallic impurities. If by any means this superfluous\r\nimpure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals, they\r\nwould become gold and silver. So miners tell us that lead has in many\r\ncases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth, and we contend\r\nthat the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of\r\nour Art.\"\r\n\r\nStories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which\r\nhad been worked out long before; these stories were supposed to prove\r\nthat gold was bred in the earth. The facts that pieces of silver were\r\nfound in tin and lead mines, and gold was found in silver mines, were\r\nadduced as proofs that, as the author of _The New Pearl of Great\r\nPrice_ says, \"Nature is continually at work changing other metals into\r\ngold, because, though in a certain sense they are complete in\r\nthemselves, they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which\r\nthey are capable, and to which nature has destined them.\" What nature\r\ndid in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop. For is not man\r\nthe crown of the world, the masterpiece of nature, the flower of the\r\nuniverse; was he not given dominion over all things when the world was\r\ncreated?\r\n\r\nIn asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold, and\r\nin attempting to effect this transmutation, the alchemist was not\r\nacting on a vague; haphazard surmise; he was pursuing a policy\r\ndictated by his conception of the order of nature; he was following\r\nthe method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself. The\r\ntransmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural\r\nphilosophy. If this transmutation were impossible, the alchemical\r\nscheme of things would be destroyed, the believer in the transmutation\r\nwould be left without a sense of order in the material universe. And,\r\nmoreover, the alchemist's conception of an orderly material universe\r\nwas so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion,\r\nthat to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be\r\nto remove not only the basis of his system of material things, but the\r\nfoundations of his system of ethics also. To take away his belief in\r\nthe possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert\r\nthe alchemist into an atheist.\r\n\r\nHow, then, was the transmutation to be accomplished? Evidently by the\r\nmethod whereby nature brings to perfection other living things; for\r\nthe alchemist's belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled\r\nhim to regard metals as living things.\r\n\r\nPlants are improved by appropriate culture, by digging and enriching\r\nthe soil, by judicious selection of seed; animals are improved by\r\ncareful breeding. By similar processes metals will be encouraged and\r\nhelped towards perfection. The perfect state of gold will not be\r\nreached at a bound; it will be gained gradually. Many partial\r\npurifications will be needed. As _Subtle_ says in _The Alchemist_--\r\n\r\n                                    'twere absurd\r\n      To think that nature in the earth bred gold\r\n      Perfect in the instant; something went before,\r\n      There must be remote matter....\r\n      Nature doth first beget the imperfect, then\r\n      Proceeds she to the perfect.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical. It\r\nmay, perhaps, be rendered somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\nMan is the most perfect of animals; in man there is a union of three\r\nparts, these are body, soul, and spirit. Metals also may be said to\r\nhave a body, a soul, and a spirit; there is a specific bodily, or\r\nmaterial, form belonging to each metal; there is a metalline soul\r\ncharacteristic of this or that class of metals; there is a spirit, or\r\ninner immaterial potency, which is the very essence of all metals.\r\n\r\nThe soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body. If the spiritual\r\nnature is to become the dominating partner, the body must be\r\nmortified: the alchemists, of course, used this kind of imagery, and\r\nit was very real to them. In like manner the spirit of metals will be\r\nlaid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences, only\r\nwhen the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed. The\r\nfirst thing to do, then, is to strip off and cast aside those\r\nproperties of metals which appeal to the senses.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw\r\nout its soul,\" said Stephanus of Alexandria in the 7th century; and in\r\nthe 17th century Paracelsus said, \"Nothing of true value is located in\r\nthe body of a substance, but in the virtue ... the less there is of\r\nbody the more in proportion is the virtue.\"\r\n\r\nBut the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage:\r\nmastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into\r\nanother like itself; it will not suffice for the great transmutation,\r\nfor in that process a metal becomes gold, the one and only perfect\r\nmetal. Hence the soul also must be removed, in order that the spirit,\r\nthe essence, the kernel, may be obtained.\r\n\r\nAnd as it is with metals, so, the alchemists argued, it is with all\r\nthings. There are a few _Principles_ which may be thought of as\r\nconditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things; beneath\r\nthese, there are certain _Elements_ which are common to many things\r\nwhose principles are not the same; and, hidden by the wrappings of\r\nelements and principles, there is the one _Essence_, the spirit, the\r\nmystic uniting bond, the final goal of the philosopher.\r\n\r\nI propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions\r\nof Elements and Principles, and in the next chapter to attempt some\r\nkind of description of the Essence.\r\n\r\nIn his _Tract Concerning the Great Stone of the Ancient Sages_, Basil\r\nValentine speaks of the \"three Principles,\" salt, sulphur, and\r\nmercury, the source of which is the Elements.\r\n\r\n\"There are four Elements, and each has at its centre another element\r\nwhich makes it what it is. These are the four pillars of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nOf the element _Earth_, he says:--\"In this element the other three,\r\nespecially fire, are latent.... It is gross and porous, specifically\r\nheavy, but naturally light.... It receives all that the other three\r\nproject into it, conscientiously conceals what it should hide, and\r\nbrings to light that which it should manifest.... Outwardly it is\r\nvisible and fixed, inwardly it is invisible and volatile.\"\r\n\r\nOf the element _Water_, Basil Valentine says:--\"Outwardly it is\r\nvolatile, inwardly it is fixed, cold, and humid.... It is the solvent\r\nof the world, and exists in three degrees of excellence: the pure, the\r\npurer, and the purest. Of its purest substance the heavens were\r\ncreated; of that which is less pure the atmospheric air was formed;\r\nthat which is simply pure remains in its proper sphere where ... it is\r\nguardian of all subtle substances here below.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the element _Air_, he writes:--\"The most noble Element of\r\nAir ... is volatile, but may be fixed, and when fixed renders all\r\nbodies penetrable.... It is nobler than Earth or Water.... It\r\nnourishes, impregnates, conserves the other elements.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, of the element _Fire_:--\"Fire is the purest and noblest of\r\nall Elements, full of adhesive unctuous corrosiveness, penetrant,\r\ndigestive, inwardly fixed, hot and dry, outwardly visible, and\r\ntempered by the earth.... This Element is the most passive of all, and\r\nresembles a chariot; when it is drawn, it moves; when it is not drawn,\r\nit stands still.\"\r\n\r\nBasil Valentine then tells his readers that Adam was compounded of the\r\nfour pure Elements, but after his expulsion from Paradise he became\r\nsubject to the various impurities of the animal creation. \"The pure\r\nElements of his creation were gradually mingled and infected with the\r\ncorruptible elements of the outer world, and thus his body became more\r\nand more gross, and liable, through its grossness, to natural decay\r\nand death.\" The process of degeneration was slow at first, but \"as\r\ntime went on, the seed out of which men were generated became more and\r\nmore infected with perishable elements. The continued use of\r\ncorruptible food rendered their bodies more and more gross; and human\r\nlife was soon reduced to a very brief span.\"\r\n\r\nBasil Valentine then deals with the formation of the three\r\n_Principles_ of things, by the mutual action of the four Elements.\r\nFire acting on Air produced _Sulphur_; Air acting on Water produced\r\n_Mercury_; Water acting on Earth produced _Salt_. Earth having nothing\r\nto act on produced nothing, but became the nurse of the three\r\nPrinciples. \"The three Principles,\" he says, \"are necessary because\r\nthey are the immediate substance of metals. The remoter substance of\r\nmetals is the four elements, but no one can produce anything out of\r\nthem but God; and even God makes nothing of them but these three\r\nPrinciples.\"\r\n\r\nTo endeavour to obtain the four pure Elements is a hopeless task. But\r\nthe Sage has the three Principles at hand. \"The artist should\r\ndetermine which of the three Principles he is seeking, and should\r\nassist it so that it may overcome its contrary.\" \"The art consists in\r\nan even mingling of the virtues of the Elements; in the natural\r\nequilibrium of the hot, the dry, the cold, and the moist.\"\r\n\r\nThe account of the Elements given by Philalethes differs from that of\r\nBasil Valentine.\r\n\r\nPhilalethes enumerates three Elements only: Air, Water, and Earth.\r\nThings are not formed by the mixture of these Elements, for\r\n\"dissimilar things can never really unite.\" By analysing the\r\nproperties of the three Elements, Philalethes reduced them finally to\r\none, namely, Water. \"Water,\" he says, \"is the first principle of all\r\nthings.\" \"Earth is the fundamental Element in which all bodies grow\r\nand are preserved. Air is the medium into which they grow, and by\r\nmeans of which the celestial virtues are communicated to them.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Philalethes, _Mercury_ is the most important of the three\r\nPrinciples. Although gold is formed by the aid of Mercury, it is only\r\nwhen Mercury has been matured, developed, and perfected, that it is\r\nable to transmute inferior metals into gold. The essential thing to do\r\nis, therefore, to find an agent which will bring about the maturing\r\nand perfecting of Mercury. This agent, Philalethes calls \"Our divine\r\nArcanum.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough it appears to me impossible to translate the sayings of the\r\nalchemists concerning Elements and Principles into expressions which\r\nshall have definite and exact meanings for us to-day, still we may,\r\nperhaps, get an inkling of the meaning of such sentences as those I\r\nhave quoted from Basil Valentine and Philalethes.\r\n\r\nTake the terms _Fire_ and _Water_. In former times all liquid\r\nsubstances were supposed to be liquid because they possessed something\r\nin common; this hypothetical something was called the _Element,\r\nWater_. Similarly, the view prevailed until comparatively recent\r\ntimes, that burning substances burn because of the presence in them of\r\na hypothetical imponderable fluid, called \"_Caloric_\"; the alchemists\r\npreferred to call this indefinable something an Element, and to name\r\nit _Fire_.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to-day to use the words _fire_ and _water_ with\r\ndifferent meanings, according to the ideas we wish to express. When we\r\nsay \"do not touch the fire,\" or \"put your hand into the water,\" we are\r\nregarding fire and water as material things; when we say \"the house is\r\non fire,\" or speak of \"a diamond of the first water,\" we are thinking\r\nof the condition or state of a burning body, or of a substance as\r\ntransparent as water. When we say \"put out the fire,\" or \"his heart\r\nbecame as water,\" we are referring to the act of burning, or are using\r\nan image which likens the thing spoken of to a substance in the act of\r\nliquefying.\r\n\r\nAs we do to-day, so the alchemists did before us; they used the words\r\n_fire_ and _water_ to express different ideas.\r\n\r\nSuch terms as hardness, softness, coldness, toughness, and the like,\r\nare employed for the purpose of bringing together into one point of\r\nview different things which are alike in, at least, one respect. Hard\r\nthings may differ in size, weight, shape, colour, texture, &c. A soft\r\nthing may weigh the same as a hard thing; both may have the same\r\ncolour or the same size, or be at the same temperature, and so on. By\r\nclassing together various things as hard or soft, or smooth or rough,\r\nwe eliminate (for the time) all the properties wherein the things\r\ndiffer, and regard them only as having one property in common. The\r\nwords hardness, softness, &c., are useful class-marks.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the alchemical Elements and Principles were useful\r\nclass-marks.\r\n\r\nWe must not suppose that when the alchemists spoke of certain things\r\nas formed from, or by the union of, the same Elements or the same\r\nPrinciples, they meant that these things contained a common substance.\r\nTheir Elements and Principles were not thought of as substances, at\r\nleast not in the modern meaning of the expression, _a substance_; they\r\nwere qualities only.\r\n\r\nIf we think of the alchemical elements earth, air, fire, and water, as\r\ngeneral expressions of what seemed to the alchemists the most\r\nimportant properties of all substances, we may be able to attach some\r\nkind of meaning to the sayings of Basil Valentine, which I have\r\nquoted. For instance, when that alchemist tells us, \"Fire is the most\r\npassive of all elements, and resembles a chariot; when it is drawn, it\r\nmoves; when it is not drawn, it stands still\"--we may suppose he meant\r\nto express the fact that a vast number of substances can be burnt, and\r\nthat combustion does not begin of itself, but requires an external\r\nagency to start it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of the terms which the alchemists used to\r\ndesignate their Elements and Principles are terms which are now\r\nemployed to designate specific substances. The word _fire_ is still\r\nemployed rather as a quality of many things under special conditions,\r\nthan as a specific substance; but _earth_, _water_, _air_, _salt_,\r\n_sulphur_, and _mercury_, are to-day the names applied to certain\r\ngroups of properties, each of which is different from all other groups\r\nof properties, and is, therefore, called, in ordinary speech, a\r\ndefinite kind of matter.\r\n\r\nAs knowledge became more accurate and more concentrated, the words\r\n_sulphur_, _salt_, _mercury_, &c., began to be applied to distinct\r\nsubstances, and as these terms were still employed in their alchemical\r\nsense as compendious expressions for certain qualities common to great\r\nclasses of substances, much confusion arose. Kunckel, the discoverer\r\nof phosphorus, who lived between 1630 and 1702, complained of the\r\nalchemists' habit of giving different names to the same substance, and\r\nthe same name to different substances. \"The sulphur of one,\" he says,\r\n\"is not the sulphur of another, to the great injury of science. To\r\nthat one replies that everyone is perfectly free to baptise his infant\r\nas he pleases. Granted. You may if you like call an ass an ox, but you\r\nwill never make anyone believe that your ox is an ass.\" Boyle is very\r\nsevere on the vague and loose use of words practised by so many\r\nwriters of his time. In _The Sceptical Chymist_ (published 1678-9) he\r\nsays: \"If judicious men, skilled in chymical affairs, shall once agree\r\nto write clearly and plainly of them, and thereby keep men from being\r\nstunned, as it were, or imposed upon by dark and empty words; it is to\r\nbe hoped that these [other] men finding, that they can no longer write\r\nimpertinently and absurdly, without being laughed at for doing so,\r\nwill be reduced either to write nothing, or books that may teach us\r\nsomething, and not rob men, as formerly, of invaluable time; and so\r\nceasing to trouble the world with riddles or impertinences, we shall\r\neither by their books receive an advantage, or by their silence escape\r\nan inconvenience.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the alchemists taught that the elements produced what they\r\ncalled _seed_, by their mutual reactions, and the principles matured\r\nthis seed and brought it to perfection. They supposed that each class,\r\nor kind, of things had its own seed, and that to obtain the seed was\r\nto have the power of producing the things which sprung from that seed.\r\n\r\nSome of them, however, asserted that all things come from a common\r\nseed, and that the nature of the products of this seed is conditioned\r\nby the circumstances under which it is caused to develop.\r\n\r\nThus Michael Sendivogius writes as follows in _The New Chemical Light,\r\ndrawn from the fountain of Nature and of Manual Experience_ (17th\r\ncentury):--\r\n\r\n  \"Wherever there is seed, Nature will work through it, whether it\r\n  be good or bad.\" \"The four Elements, by their continued action,\r\n  project a constant supply of seed to the centre of the earth,\r\n  where it is digested, and whence it proceeds again in generative\r\n  motions. Now the centre of the earth is a certain void place where\r\n  nothing is at rest, and upon the margin or circumference of this\r\n  centre the four Elements project their qualities.... The magnetic\r\n  force of our earth-centre attracts to itself as much as is needed\r\n  of the cognate seminal substance, while that which cannot be used\r\n  for vital generation is thrust forth in the shape of stones and\r\n  other rubbish. This is the fountain-head of all things\r\n  terrestrial. Let us illustrate the matter by supposing a glass of\r\n  water to be set in the middle of a table, round the margin of\r\n  which are placed little heaps of salt, and of powders of different\r\n  colours. If the water be poured out, it will run all over the\r\n  table in divergent rivulets, and will become salt where it touches\r\n  the salt, red where it touches the red powder, and so on. The\r\n  water does not change the '_places_,' but the several '_places_'\r\n  differentiate the water.[4] In the same way, the seed which is the\r\n  product of the four Elements is projected in all directions from\r\n  the earth-centre, and produces different things, according to the\r\n  quality of the different places. Thus, while the seed of all\r\n  things is one, it is made to generate a great variety of\r\n  things.... So long as Nature's seed remains in the centre it can\r\n  indifferently produce a tree or a metal, a herb or a stone, and in\r\n  like manner, according to the purity of the place, it will produce\r\n  what is less or more pure.\"\r\n\r\n   [4] The author I am quoting had said--\"Nature is divided into\r\n   four '_places_' in which she brings forth all things that\r\n   appear and that are in the shade; and according to the good or\r\n   bad quality of the '_place_,' she brings forth good or bad\r\n   things.... It is most important for us to know her '_places_'\r\n   ... in order that we may join things together according to\r\n   Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE ALCHEMICAL ESSENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I tried to describe the alchemical view of the\r\ninterdependence of different substances. Taking for granted the\r\ntripartite nature of man, the co-existence in him of body, soul, and\r\nspirit (no one of which was defined), the alchemists concluded that\r\nall things are formed as man is formed; that in everything there is a\r\nspecific bodily form, some portion of soul, and a dash of spirit. I\r\nconsidered the term _soul_ to be the alchemical name for the\r\nproperties common to a class of substances, and the term _spirit_ to\r\nmean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to\r\nall things.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in\r\nfour general classes, the marks whereof were expressed by the terms\r\nhot, cold, moist, and dry; they thought of these properties as\r\ntypified by what they called the four Elements--fire, air, water, and\r\nearth. Everything, they taught, was produced from the four Elements,\r\nnot immediately, but through the mediation of the three\r\nPrinciples--mercury, sulphur, and salt. These Principles were regarded\r\nas the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the\r\ntransmutation of one substance into another. The Principles were not\r\nthought of as definite substances, nor as properties of this or that\r\nspecified substance; they were considered to be the characteristic\r\nproperties of large classes of substances.\r\n\r\nThe chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because\r\nall are acids, because all react similarly under similar conditions.\r\nIt used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of _the\r\nprinciple of acidity_. Lavoisier changed the language whereby certain\r\nfacts concerning acids were expressed. He thought that experiments\r\nproved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen; and for many\r\nyears after Lavoisier, the alchemical expression _the principle of\r\nacidity_ was superseded by the word _oxygen_. Although Lavoisier\r\nrecognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid, he taught\r\nthat every acid is a compound of oxygen. We know now that many acids\r\nare not compounds of oxygen, but we have not yet sufficient knowledge\r\nto frame a complete definition of the term _acid_. Nevertheless it is\r\nconvenient, indeed it is necessary, to place together many compounds\r\nwhich react similarly under certain defined conditions, and to give a\r\ncommon name to them all. The alchemists also classified substances,\r\nbut their classification was necessarily more vague than ours; and\r\nthey necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different\r\nsubstances in the same class in a language which arose out of the\r\ngeneral conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was\r\nexpressed by saying; these substances are rich in the principle\r\n_sulphur_, those contain much of the principle _mercury_, and this\r\nclass is marked by the preponderance of the principle _salt_. The\r\nsecondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying;\r\nthis class is characterised by dryness, that by moisture, another by\r\ncoldness, and a fourth by hotness; the dry substances contain much of\r\nthe element _Earth_, the moist substances are rich in the element\r\n_Water_, in the cold substances the element _Air_ preponderates, and\r\nthe hot substances contain more of the element _Fire_ than of the\r\nother elements.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists went a step further in their classification of things.\r\nThey asserted that there is One Thing present in all things; that\r\neverything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the\r\nproperties of the One Thing; that there is a Primal Element common to\r\nall substances. The final aim of alchemy was to obtain the One Thing,\r\nthe Primal Element, the Soul of all Things, so purified, not only from\r\nall specific substances, but also from all admixture of the four\r\nElements and the three Principles, as to make possible the\r\naccomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it.\r\n\r\nIf a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the Essence, he\r\nmight work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion; it was necessary,\r\ntherefore, to know the conditions under which the potencies of the\r\nEssence became active. Hence there was need of prolonged study of the\r\nmutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances, and of minute\r\nand patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs\r\nher marvellous transmutations. The quest of the One Thing was fraught\r\nwith peril, and was to be attempted only by those who had served a\r\nlong and laborious apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nIn _The Chemical Treatise of Thomas Norton, the Englishman, called\r\nBelieve-me, or the Ordinal of Alchemy_ (15th century), the adept is\r\nwarned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people.\r\n\r\n\"You should carefully test and examine the life, character, and mental\r\naptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this Art, and then\r\nyou should bind him, by a sacred oath, not to let our Magistery be\r\ncommonly or vulgarly known. Only when he begins to grow old and\r\nfeeble, he may reveal it to one person, but not to more, and that one\r\nman must be virtuous.... If any wicked man should learn to practise\r\nthe Art, the event would be fraught with great danger to Christendom.\r\nFor such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation, and would\r\nremove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule\r\nover the peoples of Christendom.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of the experimental examination of the compositions and\r\nproperties of substances, made since the time of the alchemists, have\r\nled to the modern conception of the chemical element, and the\r\nisolation of about seventy or eighty different elements. No substance\r\nnow called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting\r\ntwo, or more, distinct substances, nor has any been separated into\r\ntwo, or more, unlike portions. The only decided change which a\r\nchemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it\r\nwith some other element or elements, or with a compound or compounds.\r\n\r\nBut it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations\r\nof different quantities of one primal element. Certain facts make this\r\nsupposition tenable; and some chemists expect that the supposition\r\nwill be proved to be correct. If the hypothetical primal element\r\nshould be isolated, we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy, and\r\ngained the One Thing; but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the\r\nalchemists dreamed.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the alchemical Essence was thought of as the Universal\r\nSpirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any\r\nspecific substance exhibits, it followed that the more perfect a\r\nsubstance the greater is the quantity of the Essence in it. But even\r\nin the most perfect substance found in nature--which substance, the\r\nalchemists said, is gold--the Essence is hidden by wrappings of\r\nspecific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising\r\nit. Remove these wrappings from some special substance, and you have\r\nthe perfect form of that thing; you have some portion of the Universal\r\nSpirit joined to the one general property of the class of things\r\nwhereof the particular substance is a member. Then remove the\r\nclass-property, often spoken of by the alchemists as _the life_, of\r\nthe substance, and you have the Essence itself.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists thought that to every thing, or at any rate to every\r\nclass of things, there corresponds a more perfect form than that which\r\nwe see and handle; they spoke of gold, and the _gold of the Sages_;\r\nmercury, and the _mercury of the Philosophers_; sulphur, and the\r\n_heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened_.\r\n\r\nTo remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present\r\nthemselves to the untrained senses, was regarded by the alchemists to\r\nbe a difficult task; to tear away the soul (the class-property) of a\r\nsubstance, and yet retain the Essence which made that substance its\r\ndwelling place, was possible only after vast labour, and by the use of\r\nthe proper agent working under the proper conditions. An exceedingly\r\npowerful, delicate, and refined agent was needed; and the mastery of\r\nthe agent was to be acquired by bitter experience, and, probably,\r\nafter many disappointments.\r\n\r\n\"Gold,\" an alchemist tells us, \"does not easily give up its nature,\r\nand will fight for its life; but our agent is strong enough to\r\novercome and kill it, and then it also has the power to restore it to\r\nlife, and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Norton, the author of _The Ordinal of Alchemy_, writing in the\r\n15th century, says the worker in transmutations is often tempted to be\r\nin a hurry, or to despair, and he is often deceived. His servants will\r\nbe either stupid and faithful, or quick-witted and false. He may be\r\nrobbed of everything when his work is almost finished. The only\r\nremedies are infinite patience, a sense of virtue, and sound reason.\r\n\"In the pursuit of our Art,\" he says, \"you should take care, from time\r\nto time, to unbend your mind from its sterner employments with some\r\nconvenient recreation.\"\r\n\r\nThe choice of workmen to aid in the mechanical parts of the quest was\r\na great trouble to the alchemists. On this subject Norton says--\"If\r\nyou would be free from all fear over the gross work, follow my\r\ncounsel, and never engage married men; for they soon give in and\r\npretend they are tired out.... Hire your workmen for certain\r\nstipulated wages, and not for longer periods than twenty-four hours at\r\na time. Give them higher wages than they would receive elsewhere, and\r\nbe prompt and ready in your payments.\"\r\n\r\nMany accounts are given by alchemical writers of the agent, and many\r\nnames are bestowed on it. The author of _A Brief Guide to the\r\nCelestial Ruby_ speaks thus of the agent--\"It is our doorkeeper, our\r\nbalm, our honey, oil, urine, maydew, mother, egg, secret furnace,\r\noven, true fire, venomous dragon, Theriac, ardent wine, Green Lion,\r\nBird of Hermes, Goose of Hermogenes, two-edged sword in the hand of\r\nthe Cherub that guards the Tree of Life.... It is our true secret\r\nvessel, and the Garden of the Sages in which our sun rises and sets.\r\nIt is our Royal Mineral, our triumphant vegetable Saturnia, and the\r\nmagic rod of Hermes, by means of which he assumes any shape he likes.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes we are told that the agent is mercury, sometimes that it is\r\ngold, but not common mercury or common gold. \"Supplement your common\r\nmercury with the inward fire which it needs, and you will soon get rid\r\nof all superfluous dross.\" \"The agent is gold, as highly matured as\r\nnatural and artificial digestion can make it, and a thousand times\r\nmore perfect than the common metal of that name. Gold, thus exalted,\r\nradically penetrates, tinges, and fixes metals.\"\r\n\r\nThe alchemists generally likened the work to be performed by their\r\nagent to the killing of a living thing. They constantly use the\r\nallegory of death, followed by resurrection, in describing the steps\r\nwhereby the Essence was to be obtained, and the processes whereby the\r\nbaser metals were to be partially purified. They speak of the\r\nmortification of metals, the dissolution and putrefaction of\r\nsubstances, as preliminaries to the appearance of the true life of the\r\nthings whose outward properties have been destroyed. For instance,\r\nParacelsus says: \"Destruction perfects that which is good; for the\r\ngood cannot appear on account of that which conceals it.\" The same\r\nalchemist speaks of rusting as the mortification of metals; he says:\r\n\"The mortification of metals is the removal of their bodily\r\nstructure.... The mortification of woods is their being turned into\r\ncharcoal or ashes.\"\r\n\r\nParacelsus distinguishes natural from artificial mortification,\r\n\"Whatever nature consumes,\" he says, \"man cannot restore. But whatever\r\nman destroys man can restore, and break again when restored.\" Things\r\nwhich had been mortified by man's device were considered by Paracelsus\r\nnot to be really dead. He gives this extraordinary illustration of his\r\nmeaning: \"You see this is the case with lions, which are all born\r\ndead, and are first vitalised by the horrible noise of their parents,\r\njust as a sleeping person is awakened by a shout.\"\r\n\r\nThe mortification of metals is represented in alchemical books by\r\nvarious images and allegories. Fig. I. is reduced from a cut in a 16th\r\ncentury work, _The Book of Lambspring, a noble ancient Philosopher,\r\nconcerning the Philosophical Stone_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Here the father devours the son;\r\n               The soul and spirit flow forth from the body.\r\n               FIG. I.]\r\n\r\nThe image used to set forth the mortification of metals is a king\r\nswallowing his son. Figs. II. and III. are reduced from Basil\r\nValentine's _Twelve Keys_. Both of these figures represent the process\r\nof mortification by images connected with death and burial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. II.]\r\n\r\nIn his explanation (?) of these figures, Basil Valentine says:--\r\n\r\n  \"Neither human nor animal bodies can be multiplied or propagated\r\n  without decomposition; the grain and all vegetable seed, when cast\r\n  into the ground, must decay before it can spring up again;\r\n  moreover, putrefaction imparts life to many worms and other\r\n  animalculæ.... If bread is placed in honey, and suffered to decay,\r\n  ants are generated ... maggots are also developed by the decay of\r\n  nuts, apples, and pears. The same thing may be observed in regard\r\n  to vegetable life. Nettles and other weeds spring up where no such\r\n  seed has ever been sown. This occurs only by putrefaction. The\r\n  reason is that the soil in such places is so disposed, and, as it\r\n  were, impregnated, that it produces these fruits; which is a\r\n  result of the properties of sidereal influences; consequently the\r\n  seed is spiritually produced in the earth, and putrefies in the\r\n  earth, and by the operation of the elements generates corporeal\r\n  matter according to the species of nature. Thus the stars and the\r\n  elements may generate new spiritual, and ultimately, new vegetable\r\n  seed, by means of putrefaction.... Know that, in like manner, no\r\n  metallic seed can develop, or multiply, unless the said seed, by\r\n  itself alone, and without the introduction of any foreign\r\n  substance, be reduced to a perfect putrefaction.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. III.]\r\n\r\nThe action of the mineral agent in perfecting substances is often\r\nlikened by the alchemists to the conjoining of the male and the\r\nfemale, followed by the production of offspring. They insist on the\r\nneed of a union of two things, in order to produce something more\r\nperfect than either. The agent, they say, must work upon something;\r\nalone it is nothing.\r\n\r\nThe methods whereby the agent is itself perfected, and the processes\r\nwherein the agent effects the perfecting of the less perfect things,\r\nwere divided into stages by the alchemists. They generally spoke of\r\nthese stages as _Gates_, and enumerated ten or sometimes twelve of\r\nthem. As examples of the alchemical description of these gates, I give\r\nsome extracts from _A Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby_.\r\n\r\nThe first gate is _Calcination_, which is \"the drying up of the\r\nhumours\"; by this process the substance \"is concocted into a black\r\npowder which is yet unctuous, and retains its radical humour.\" When\r\ngold passes through this gate, \"We observe in it two natures, the\r\nfixed and the volatile, which we liken to two serpents.\" The fixed\r\nnature is likened to a serpent without wings; the volatile, to a\r\nserpent with wings: calcination unites these two into one. The second\r\ngate, _Dissolution_, is likened to death and burial; but the true\r\nEssence will appear glorious and beautiful when this gate is passed.\r\nThe worker is told not to be discouraged by this apparent death. _The\r\nmercury of the sages_ is spoken of by this author as the queen, and\r\ngold as the king. The king dies for love of the queen, but he is\r\nrevived by his spouse, who is made fruitful by him and brings forth \"a\r\nmost royal son.\"\r\n\r\nFigs. IV. and V. are reduced from _The Book of Lambspring_; they\r\nexpress the need of the conjunction of two to produce one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Here you behold a great marvel--\r\n               Two Lions are joined into one.\r\n\r\n               The spirit and soul must be united in their body.\r\n               FIG. IV.]\r\n\r\nAfter dissolution came _Conjunction_, wherein the separated elements\r\nwere combined. Then followed _Putrefaction_, necessary for the\r\ngermination of the seed which had been produced by calcination,\r\ndissolution, and conjunction. Putrefaction was followed by\r\n_Congelation_ and _Citation_. The passage through the next gate,\r\ncalled _Sublimation_, caused the body to become spiritual, and the\r\nspiritual to be made corporal. _Fermentation_ followed, whereby the\r\nsubstance became soft and flowed like wax. Finally, by _Exaltation_,\r\nthe Stone was perfected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Here are two birds, great and strong--the body and\r\n               spirit; one devours the other.\r\n\r\n               Let the body be placed in horse-dung, or a warm bath,\r\n               the spirit having been extracted from it. The body has\r\n               become white by the process, the spirit red by our art.\r\n               All that exists tends towards perfection, and thus is\r\n               the Philosopher's Stone prepared.\r\n\r\n               FIG. V.]\r\n\r\nThe author of _The Open Entrance_ speaks of the various stages in the\r\nperfecting of the agent as _regimens_. The beginning of the heating\r\nof gold with mercury is likened to the king stripping off his golden\r\ngarments and descending into the fountain; this is the _regimen of\r\nMercury_. As the heating is continued, all becomes black; this is the\r\n_regimen of Saturn_. Then is noticed a play of many colours; this is\r\nthe _regimen of Jupiter_: if the heat is not regulated properly, \"the\r\nyoung ones of the crow will go back to the nest.\" About the end of the\r\nfourth month you will see \"the sign of the waxing moon,\" and all\r\nbecomes white; this is the _regimen of the Moon_. The white colour\r\ngives place to purple and green; you are now in the _regimen of\r\nVenus_. After that, appear all the colours of the rainbow, or of a\r\npeacock's tail; this is the _regimen of Mars_. Finally the colour\r\nbecomes orange and golden; this is the _regimen of the Sun_.\r\n\r\nThe reader may wish to have some description of the Essence. The\r\nalchemists could describe it only in contraries. It had a bodily form,\r\nbut its method of working was spiritual. In _The Sodic Hydrolith, or\r\nWater Stone of the Wise_ we are told:--\r\n\r\n  \"The stone is conceived below the earth, born in the earth,\r\n  quickened in heaven, dies in time, and obtains eternal glory....\r\n  It is bluish-grey and green.... It flows like water, yet it makes\r\n  no wet; it is of great weight, and is small.\"\r\n\r\nPhilalethes says, in _A Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby_: \"The\r\nPhilosopher's Stone is a certain heavenly, spiritual, penetrative, and\r\nfixed substance, which brings all metals to the perfection of gold or\r\nsilver (according to the quality of the Medicine), and that by natural\r\nmethods, which yet in their effects transcend Nature.... Know then\r\nthat it is called a stone, not because it is like a stone, but only\r\nbecause, by virtue of its fixed nature, it resists the action of fire\r\nas successfully as any stone. In species it is gold, more pure than\r\nthe purest; it is fixed and incombustible like a stone, but its\r\nappearance is that of very fine powder, impalpable to the touch, sweet\r\nto the taste, fragrant to the smell, in potency a most penetrative\r\nspirit, apparently dry and yet unctuous, and easily capable of tinging\r\na plate of metal.... If we say that its nature is spiritual, it would\r\nbe no more than the truth; if we described it as corporeal, the\r\nexpression would be equally correct.\"\r\n\r\nThe same author says: \"There is a substance of a metalline species\r\nwhich looks so cloudy that the universe will have nothing to do with\r\nit. Its visible form is vile; it defiles metalline bodies, and no one\r\ncan readily imagine that the pearly drink of bright Phoebus should\r\nspring from thence. Its components are a most pure and tender mercury,\r\na dry incarcerate sulphur, which binds it and restrains fluxation....\r\nKnow this subject, it is the sure basis of all our secrets.... To deal\r\nplainly, it is the child of Saturn, of mean price and great venom....\r\nIt is not malleable, though metalline. Its colour is sable, with\r\nintermixed argent which mark the sable fields with veins of glittering\r\nargent.\"\r\n\r\nIn trying to attach definite meanings to the alchemical accounts of\r\nPrinciples, Elements, and the One Thing, and the directions which the\r\nalchemists give for changing one substance into others, we are very\r\napt to be misled by the use of such an expression as _the\r\ntransmutation of the elements_. To a chemist that phrase means the\r\nchange of an element into another element, an element being a definite\r\nsubstance, which no one has been able to produce by the combination of\r\ntwo or more substances unlike itself, or to separate into two or more\r\nsubstances unlike itself. But whatever may have been the alchemical\r\nmeaning of the word _element_, it was certainly not that given to the\r\nsame word to-day. Nor did the word _transmutation_ mean to the\r\nalchemist what it means to the chemist.\r\n\r\nThe facts which are known at present concerning the elements make\r\nunthinkable such a change as that of lead into silver; but new facts\r\n_may_ be discovered which will make possible the separation of lead\r\ninto things unlike itself, and the production of silver by the\r\ncombination of some of these constituents of lead. The alchemist\r\nsupposed he knew such facts as enabled him not only to form a mental\r\npicture of the change of lead into silver, or tin into gold, but also\r\nto assert that such changes must necessarily happen, and to accomplish\r\nthem. Although we are quite sure that the alchemist's facts were only\r\nimaginings, we ought not to blame him for his reasoning on what he\r\ntook to be facts.\r\n\r\nEvery metal is now said to be an element, in the modern meaning of\r\nthat word: the alchemist regarded the metals as composite substances;\r\nbut he also thought of them as more simple than many other things.\r\nHence, if he was able to transmute one metal into another, he would\r\nhave strong evidence in support of his general conception of the\r\nunity of all things. And, as transmutation meant, to the alchemist,\r\nthe bringing of a substance to the condition of greatest perfection\r\npossible for that substance, his view of the unity of nature might be\r\nsaid to be proved if he succeeded in changing one of the metals, one\r\nof these comparatively simple substances, into the most perfect of all\r\nmetals, that is, into gold.\r\n\r\nThe transmutation of the baser metals into gold thus came to be the\r\npractical test of the justness of the alchemical scheme of things.\r\n\r\nSome alchemists assert they had themselves performed the great\r\ntransmutation; others tell of people who had accomplished the work.\r\nThe following story is an example of the accounts given of the making\r\nof gold. It is taken from _John Frederick Helvetius' Golden Calf,\r\nwhich the world worships and adores_ (17th century):--\r\n\r\n  \"On the 27th December 1666, in the forenoon, there came to my\r\n  house a certain man, who was a complete stranger to me, but of an\r\n  honest grave countenance, and an authoritative mien, clothed in a\r\n  simple garb.... He was of middle height, his face was long and\r\n  slightly pock-marked, his hair was black and straight, his chin\r\n  close-shaven, his age about forty-three or forty-four, and his\r\n  native province, as far as I could make out, North Holland. After\r\n  we had exchanged salutations, he asked me whether he might have\r\n  some conversation with me. He wished to say something to me about\r\n  the Pyrotechnic Art, as he had read one of my tracts (directed\r\n  against the Sympathetic Powder of Dr Digby), in which I hinted a\r\n  suspicion whether the Grand Arcanum of the Sages was not after all\r\n  a gigantic hoax. He, therefore, took that opportunity of asking me\r\n  whether I could not believe that such a grand mystery might exist\r\n  in the nature of things, by means of which a physician could\r\n  restore any patient whose vitals were not irreparably destroyed. I\r\n  answered, 'Such a medicine would be a most desirable acquisition\r\n  for any physician; nor can any man tell how many secrets there may\r\n  be hidden in Nature; yet, though I have read much about the truth\r\n  of this art, it has never been my good fortune to meet with a real\r\n  master of the alchemical science.' ... After some further\r\n  conversation, the Artist Elias (for it was he) thus addressed me:\r\n  'Since you have read so much in the works of the alchemists about\r\n  this stone, its substance, its colour and its wonderful effects,\r\n  may I be allowed the question, whether you have not prepared it\r\n  yourself?' On my answering his question in the negative, he took\r\n  out of his bag a cunningly-worked ivory box, in which were three\r\n  large pieces of substance resembling glass, or pale sulphur, and\r\n  informed me that here was enough of the tincture for the\r\n  production of twenty tons of gold. When I had held the precious\r\n  treasure in my hand for a quarter of an hour (during which time I\r\n  listened to a recital of its wonderful curative properties), I was\r\n  compelled to restore it to its owner, which I could not help doing\r\n  with a certain degree of reluctance.... My request that he would\r\n  give me a piece of his stone (though it were no larger than a\r\n  coriander seed), he somewhat brusquely refused, adding, in a\r\n  milder tone, that he could not give it me for all the wealth I\r\n  possessed, and that not on account of its great preciousness, but\r\n  for some other reason which it was not lawful for him to\r\n  divulge.... Then he inquired whether I could not show him into a\r\n  room at the back of the house, where we should be less liable to\r\n  the observation of passers-by. On my conducting him into the state\r\n  parlour (which he entered without wiping his dirty boots), he\r\n  demanded of me a gold coin, and while I was looking for it, he\r\n  produced from his breast pocket a green silk handkerchief, in\r\n  which were folded up five medals, the gold of which was infinitely\r\n  superior to that of my gold piece.\" Here follows the inscriptions\r\n  on the medals. \"I was filled with admiration, and asked my visitor\r\n  whence he had obtained that wonderful knowledge of the whole\r\n  world. He replied that it was a gift freely bestowed on him by a\r\n  friend who had stayed a few days at his house.\" Here follows the\r\n  stranger's account of this friend's experiments. \"When my strange\r\n  visitor had concluded his narrative, I besought him to give me a\r\n  proof of his assertion, by performing the transmutatory operation\r\n  on some metals in my presence. He answered evasively, that he\r\n  could not do so then, but that he would return in three weeks, and\r\n  that, if he was then at liberty to do so, he would show me\r\n  something that would make me open my eyes. He appeared punctually\r\n  to the promised day, and invited me to take a walk with him, in\r\n  the course of which we discoursed profoundly on the secrets of\r\n  Nature in fire, though I noticed that my companion was very chary\r\n  in imparting information about the Grand Arcanum.... At last I\r\n  asked him point blank to show me the transmutation of metals. I\r\n  besought him to come and dine with me, and to spend the night at\r\n  my house; I entreated; I expostulated; but in vain. He remained\r\n  firm. I reminded him of his promise. He retorted that his promise\r\n  had been conditional upon his being permitted to reveal the secret\r\n  to me. At last, however, I prevailed upon him to give me a piece\r\n  of his precious stone--a piece no larger than a grain of rape\r\n  seed.... He bid me take half an ounce of lead ... and melt it in\r\n  the crucible; for the Medicine would certainly not tinge more of\r\n  the base metal than it was sufficient for.... He promised to\r\n  return at nine o'clock the next morning.... But at the stated hour\r\n  on the following day he did not make his appearance; in his stead,\r\n  however, there came, a few hours later, a stranger, who told me\r\n  that his friend the artist was unavoidably detained, but that he\r\n  would call at three o'clock in the afternoon. The afternoon came;\r\n  I waited for him till half-past seven o'clock. He did not appear.\r\n  Thereupon my wife came and tempted me to try the transmutation\r\n  myself. I determined however to wait till the morrow. On the\r\n  morrow ... I asked my wife to put the tincture in wax, and I\r\n  myself ... prepared six drachms of lead; I then cast the tincture,\r\n  enveloped as it was in wax, on the lead; as soon as it was melted,\r\n  there was a hissing sound and a slight effervescence, and after a\r\n  quarter of an hour I found that the whole mass of lead had been\r\n  turned into the finest gold.... We immediately took it to the\r\n  goldsmith, who at once declared it the finest gold he had ever\r\n  seen, and offered to pay fifty florins an ounce for it.\" He then\r\n  describes various tests which were made to prove the purity of the\r\n  gold. \"Thus I have unfolded to you the whole story from beginning\r\n  to end. The gold I still retain in my possession, but I cannot\r\n  tell you what has become of the Artist Elias.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nALCHEMY AS AN EXPERIMENTAL ART.\r\n\r\n\r\nA modern writer, Mr A.E. Waite, in his _Lives of the Alchemystical\r\nPhilosophers_, says: \"The physical theory of transmutation is based on\r\nthe composite character of the metals, on their generation in the\r\nbowels of the earth, and on the existence in nature of a pure and\r\npenetrating matter which applied to any substance exalts and perfects\r\nit after its own kind.\" It must he admitted that the alchemists could\r\ncite many instances of transmutations which seemed to lead to the\r\nconclusion, that there is no difference of kind between the metals and\r\nother substances such as water, acids, oils, resins, and wood. We are\r\nable to-day to effect a vast number of transformations wherein one\r\nsubstance is exchanged for another, or made to take the place of\r\nanother. We can give fairly satisfactory descriptions of these\r\nchanges; and, by comparing them one with another, we are able to\r\nexpress their essential features in general terms which can be applied\r\nto each particular instance. The alchemists had no searching knowledge\r\nof what may be called the mechanism of such changes; they gave an\r\nexplanation of them which we must call incorrect, in the present state\r\nof our knowledge. But, as Hoefer says in his _Histoire de la Chimie_,\r\n\"to jeer at [the alchemical] theory is to commit at once an\r\nanachronism and an injustice.... Unless the world should finish\r\nto-morrow, no one can have the pretension to suppose that our\r\ncontemporaries have said the last word of science, and nothing will\r\nremain for our descendants to discover, no errors for them to correct,\r\nno theories for them to set straight.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. VI. _See p. 90._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. VII. _See p. 90._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. VIII. _See p. 91._]\r\n\r\nWhat kind of experimental evidence could an alchemist furnish in\r\nsupport of his theory of transmutation? In answering this question, I\r\ncannot do better than give a condensed rendering of certain pages in\r\nHoefer's _Histoire de la Chimie_.\r\n\r\nThe reader is supposed to be present at experiments conducted in the\r\nlaboratory of a Grand Master of the Sacred Art in the 5th or 6th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n_Experiment_.--Ordinary water is boiled in an open vessel; the water\r\nis changed to a vapour which disappears, and a white powdery earth\r\nremains in the vessel.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_.--Water is changed into air and earth.\r\n\r\nDid we not know that ordinary water holds certain substances in\r\nsolution, and that boiling water acts on the vessel wherein it is\r\nboiled, we should have no objection to urge against this conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt only remained to transmute fire that the transmutation of the four\r\nelements might be completed.\r\n\r\n_Experiment._--A piece of red-hot iron is placed in a bell-jar, filled\r\nwith water, held over a basin containing water; the volume of the\r\nwater decreases, and the air in the bell-jar takes fire when a lighted\r\ntaper is brought into it.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._--Water is changed into fire.\r\n\r\nThat interpretation was perfectly reasonable at a time when the fact\r\nwas unknown that water is composed of two gaseous substances; that one\r\nof these (oxygen) is absorbed by the iron, and the other (hydrogen)\r\ncollects in the bell-jar, and ignites when brought into contact with a\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n_Experiment_.--Lead, or any other metal except gold or silver, is\r\ncalcined in the air; the metal loses its characteristic properties,\r\nand is changed into a powdery substance, a kind of cinder or calx.\r\nWhen this cinder, which was said to be the result of the _death of the\r\nmetal_, is heated in a crucible with some grains of wheat, one sees\r\nthe metal revive, and resume its original form and properties.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._--The metal which had been destroyed is revivified by the\r\ngrains of wheat and the action of fire.\r\n\r\nIs this not to perform the miracle of the resurrection?\r\n\r\nNo objection can he raised to this interpretation, as long as we are\r\nignorant of the phenomena of oxidation, and the reduction of oxides by\r\nmeans of carbon, or organic substances rich in carbon, such as sugar,\r\nflour, seeds, etc. Grains of wheat were the symbol of life, and, by\r\nextension, of the resurrection and eternal life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. IX. _See p. 91._]\r\n\r\n_Experiment_.--Ordinary lead is calcined in a cupel made of cinders or\r\npowdered bones; the lead is changed to a cinder which disappears into\r\nthe cupel, and a button of silver remains.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_.--The lead has vanished; what more natural than the\r\nconclusion that it has been transformed into silver? It was not known\r\nthen that all specimens of lead contain more or less silver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. X. _See p. 92._]\r\n\r\n_Experiment._-The vapour of arsenic bleaches copper. This fact gave\r\nrise to many allegories and enigmas concerning the means of\r\ntransforming copper into silver.\r\n\r\nSulphur, which acts on metals and changes many of them into black\r\nsubstances, was looked on as a very mysterious thing. It was with\r\nsulphur that the coagulation (solidification) of mercury was effected.\r\n\r\n_Experiment_.--Mercury is allowed to fall, in a fine rain, on to\r\nmelted sulphur; a black substance is produced; this black substance is\r\nheated in a closed vessel, it is volatilised and transformed into a\r\nbeautiful red solid.\r\n\r\nOne could scarcely suppose that the black and the red substances are\r\nidentical, if one did not know that they are composed of the same\r\nquantities of the same elements, sulphur and mercury.\r\n\r\nHow greatly must this phenomenon have affected the imagination of the\r\nchemists of ancient times, always so ready to be affected by\r\neverything that seemed supernatural!\r\n\r\nBlack and red were the symbols of darkness and light, of the evil and\r\nthe good principle; and the union of these two principles represented\r\nthe moral order. At a later time the idea helped to establish the\r\nalchemical doctrine that sulphur and mercury are the Principles of all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n_Experiment._--Various organic substances are analysed by heating in a\r\ndistillation-apparatus; the products are, in each case, a solid\r\nresidue, liquids which distil off, and certain spirits which are\r\ndisengaged.\r\n\r\nThe results supported the ancient theory which asserted that _earth_,\r\n_water_, _air_, and _fire_ are the four Elements of the world. The\r\nsolid residue represented _earth_; the liquid products of the\r\ndistillation, _water_; and the spirituous substances, _air_. _Fire_\r\nwas regarded sometimes as the means of purification, sometimes as the\r\nsoul, or invisible part, of all substances.\r\n\r\n_Experiment_.-A strong acid is poured on to copper. The metal is\r\nattacked, and at last disappears, giving place to a green liquid, as\r\ntransparent as water. A thin sheet of iron is plunged into the liquid;\r\nthe copper re-appears, and the iron vanishes.\r\n\r\nWhat more simple than to conclude that the iron has been transformed\r\ninto copper?\r\n\r\nHad lead, silver, or gold been used in place of copper, one would have\r\nsaid that the iron was transformed into lead, silver, or gold.\r\n\r\nIn their search for \"the pure and penetrating matter which applied to\r\nany substance exalts and perfects it after its own kind,\" the\r\nalchemists necessarily made many inventions, laid the foundation of\r\nmany arts and manufactures, and discovered many facts of importance in\r\nthe science of chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe practitioners of the _Sacred Art_ of Egypt must have been\r\nacquainted with many operations which we now class as belonging to\r\napplied chemistry; witness, their jewellery, pottery, dyes and\r\npigments, bleaching, glass-making, working in metals and alloys, and\r\ntheir use of spices, essential oils, and soda in embalming, and for\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\nDuring the centuries when alchemy flourished, gunpowder was invented,\r\nthe art of printing was established, the compass was brought into use,\r\nthe art of painting and staining glass was begun and carried to\r\nperfection, paper was made from rags, practical metallurgy advanced by\r\nleaps and bounds, many new alloys of metals came into use, glass\r\nmirrors were manufactured, and considerable advances were made in\r\npractical medicine and sanitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. XI. _See p. 92._]\r\n\r\nBasil Valentine, who was one of the greatest alchemists of the 16th\r\ncentury, discovered many of the properties of the metal antimony, and\r\nprepared and examined many compounds of that metal; he made green\r\nvitriol from pyrites, brandy from fermented grape-juice, fulminating\r\ngold, sulphide of potash, and spirits of salt; he made and used baths\r\nof artificial mineral waters, and he prepared various metals by what\r\nare now called _wet methods_, for instance, copper, by immersing\r\nplates of iron in solutions of bluestone. He examined the air of\r\nmines, and suggested practical methods for determining whether the\r\nair in a mine was respirable. Hoefer draws attention to a remarkable\r\nobservation recorded by this alchemist. Speaking of the \"spirit of\r\nmercury,\" Basil Valentine says it is \"the origin of all the metals;\r\nthat spirit is nothing else than an air flying here and there without\r\nwings; it is a moving wind, which, after it has been chased from its\r\nhome of Vulcan (that is, fire), returns to the chaos; then it expands\r\nand passes into the region of the air from whence it had come.\" As\r\nHoefer remarks, this is perhaps one of the earliest accounts of the\r\ngas discovered by Priestley and studied by Lavoisier, the gas we now\r\ncall oxygen, and recognise as of paramount importance in chemical\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. XII. _See p. 92._]\r\n\r\nBesides discovering and recording many facts which have become part\r\nand parcel of the science of chemistry, the alchemists invented and\r\nused various pieces of apparatus, and conducted many operations, which\r\nare still employed in chemical laboratories. I shall reproduce\r\nillustrations of some of these processes and pieces of apparatus, and\r\nquote a few of the directions, given in a book, published in 1664,\r\ncalled _The Art of Distillation_, by John French, Dr. in Physick.\r\n\r\nThe method recommended by French for hermetically sealing the neck of\r\na glass vessel is shown in Fig. VI. p. 80. The neck of the vessel is\r\nsurrounded by a tray containing burning coals; when the glass melts it\r\nis cut off by shears, and then closed by tongs, which are made hot\r\nbefore use.\r\n\r\nFig. VII. p. 81, represents a method for covering an open vessel,\r\nair-tight, with a receptacle into which a substance may be sublimed\r\nfrom the lower vessel. The lettering explains the method of using the\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nFrench gives very practical directions and much sound advice for\r\nconducting distillations of various kinds. The following are specimens\r\nof his directions and advice:--\r\n\r\n  \"When you put water into a seething Balneum wherein there are\r\n  glasses let it be hot, or else thou wilt endanger the breaking of\r\n  the glasses.\r\n\r\n  \"When thou takest any earthen, or glass vessel from the fire,\r\n  expose it not to the cold aire too suddenly for fear it should\r\n  break.\r\n\r\n  \"In all your operations diligently observe the processes which you\r\n  read, and vary not a little from them, for sometimes a small\r\n  mistake or neglect spoils the whole operation, and frustrates your\r\n  expectations.\r\n\r\n  \"Try not at first experiments of great cost, or great difficulty;\r\n  for it will be a great discouragement to thee, and thou wilt be\r\n  very apt to mistake.\r\n\r\n  \"If any one would enter upon the practices of Chymistry, let him\r\n  apply himself to some expert artist for to be instructed in the\r\n  manual operation of things; for by this means he will learn more\r\n  in two months, than he can by his practice and study in seven\r\n  years, as also avoid much pains and cost, and redeem much time\r\n  which else of necessity he will lose.\"\r\n\r\nFig. VIII. p. 82, represents a common cold still, and Fig. IX. p. 84,\r\nis a sketch of an apparatus for distilling by the aid of boiling\r\nwater. The bath wherein the vessels are placed in Fig. IX. was called\r\nby the alchemists _balneum Mariae_, from Mary the Jewess, who is\r\nmentioned in the older alchemical writings, and is supposed to have\r\ninvented an apparatus of this character. Nothing definite is known of\r\nMary the Jewess. A writer of the 7th century says she was initiated in\r\nthe sacred art in the temple of Memphis; a legend prevailed among some\r\nof the alchemists that she was the sister of Moses.\r\n\r\nFig. X. p. 85, represents methods of distilling with an apparatus for\r\ncooling the volatile products; the lower vessel is an _alembic_, with\r\na long neck, the upper part of which passes through a vessel\r\ncontaining cold water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig XIII. _See p. 94._]\r\n\r\nFig. XI. p. 88, shows a _pelican_, that is a vessel wherein a liquid\r\nmight be heated for a long time, and the volatile products be\r\nconstantly returned to the original vessel.\r\n\r\nFig. XII. p. 89, represents a retort with a receiver.\r\n\r\nSome of the pieces of apparatus for distilling, which are described\r\nby French, are shown in the following figures. Besides describing\r\napparatus for distilling, subliming, and other processes in the\r\nlaboratory, French gives directions for making tinctures, essences,\r\nessential oils, spirits of salt, and pure saltpetre, oil of vitriol,\r\nbutter of antimony, calces (or as we now say, oxides) of metals, and\r\nmany other substances. He describes processes for making fresh water\r\nfrom salt, artificial mineral water, medicated hot baths for invalids\r\n(one of the figures represents an apparatus very like those advertised\r\nto-day as \"Turkish baths at home\"), and artificial precious stones; he\r\ntells how to test minerals, and make alloys, and describes the\r\npreparation of many substances made from gold and silver. He also\r\ngives many curious receipts; for instance, \"To make Firre-trees appear\r\nin Turpentine,\" \"To make a Plant grow in two or three hours,\" \"To make\r\nthe representation of the whole world in a Glass,\" \"To extract a white\r\nMilkie substance from the raies of the Moon.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. XIV. _See p. 94._]\r\n\r\nThe process of making oil of vitriol, by burning sulphur under a hood\r\nfitted with a side tube for the outflow of the oil of vitriol, is\r\nrepresented in Fig. XIII. p. 92.\r\n\r\nFig. XIV. p. 93, is interesting; it is an apparatus for rectifying\r\nspirits, by distilling, and liquefying only the most volatile portions\r\nof the distillate. The spirituous liquor was heated, and the vapours\r\ncaused to traverse a long zigzag tube, wherein the less volatile\r\nportions condensed to liquid, which flowed back into the vessel; the\r\nvapour then passed into another vessel, and then through a second\r\nzigzag tube, and was finally cooled by water, and the condensed liquid\r\ncollected. This apparatus was the forerunner of that used to-day, for\r\neffecting the separation of liquids which boil at different\r\ntemperatures, by the process called _fractional distillation_.\r\n\r\nWe should never forget that the alchemists were patient and laborious\r\nworkers, their theories were vitally connected with their practice,\r\nand there was a constant action and reaction between their general\r\nscheme of things and many branches of what we now call chemical\r\nmanufactures. We may laugh at many of their theories, and regret that\r\nmuch useless material was accumulated by them; we may agree with Boyle\r\n(end of 17th century) when he likens the \"hermetick philosophers,\" in\r\ntheir search for truth, to \"the navigators of Solomon's Tarshish\r\nfleet, who brought home from their long and tedious voyages, not only\r\ngold, and silver, and ivory, but apes and peacocks too; for so the\r\nwritings of several of your hermetick philosophers present us,\r\ntogether with divers substantial and noble experiments, theories,\r\nwhich either like peacocks' feathers make a great show but are neither\r\nsolid nor useful; or else like apes, if they have some appearance of\r\nbeing rational, are blemished with some absurdity or other, that, when\r\nthey are attentively considered make them appear ridiculous.\" But\r\nhowever we may condemn their method, because it rested on their own\r\nconception of what the order of nature must be, we cannot but praise\r\ntheir assiduity in conducting experiments and gathering facts.\r\n\r\nAs Bacon says, in _De Augmentis Scientiarum_:\r\n\r\n  \"Alchemy may be compared to the man who told his sons that he had\r\n  left them gold buried somewhere in his vineyard; where they by\r\n  digging found no gold, but by turning up the mould about the roots\r\n  of the vines, procured a plentiful vintage. So the search and\r\n  endeavours to make gold have brought many useful inventions and\r\n  instructive experiments to light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUAGE OF ALCHEMY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy, and the\r\nattribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists,\r\nnecessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact,\r\nundescriptive, and unsuggestive to modern ears. The same name was\r\ngiven to different things, and the same thing went under many names.\r\nIn Chapter IV. I endeavoured to analyse two terms which were\r\nconstantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance,\r\nthe terms _Element_ and _Principle_. That attempt sufficed, at any\r\nrate, to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were\r\nintended to express, and to make evident the inconsistencies between\r\nthe meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers. The\r\nstory quoted in Chapter III., from Michael Sendivogius, illustrates\r\nthe difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding\r\nwhat they meant by the term _Mercury_; yet there is perhaps no word\r\nmore often used by them than that. Some of them evidently took it to\r\nmean the substance then, and now, called mercury; the results of this\r\nliteral interpretation were disastrous; others thought of mercury as a\r\nsubstance which could be obtained, or, at any rate, might be obtained,\r\nby repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury, both alone and when mixed\r\nwith other substances; others used the word to mean a hypothetical\r\nsomething which was liquid but did not wet things, limpid yet capable\r\nof becoming solid, volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of\r\nother things, and white, yet ready to cause other white things to\r\nchange their colour; they thought of this something, this soul of\r\nmercury, as having properties without itself being tangible, as at\r\nonce a substance and not a substance, at once a bodily spirit and a\r\nspiritual body.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save\r\nthat of far-fetched allegory. The alchemical writings abound in such\r\nallegories. Here are two of them.\r\n\r\nThe first allegory is taken from _The Twelve Keys_, of Basilius\r\nValentinus, the Benedictine:--\r\n\r\n  \"The eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our\r\n  Stone I will put before you in the form of a parable.\r\n\r\n  \"There lived in the East a gilded knight, named Orpheus, who was\r\n  possessed of immense wealth, and had everything that heart can\r\n  wish. He had taken to wife his own sister, Euridice, who did not,\r\n  however, bear him any children. This he regarded as the punishment\r\n  of his sin in having wedded his own sister, and was instant in\r\n  prayer to God both by day and by night, that the curse might be\r\n  taken from him. One night when he was buried in a deep sleep,\r\n  there came to him a certain winged messenger, named Phoebus, who\r\n  touched his feet, which were very hot, and said: 'Thou noble\r\n  knight, since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms\r\n  and suffered many things at sea, in battle, and in the lists, the\r\n  heavenly Father has bidden me make known to thee the following\r\n  means of obtaining thy prayer: Take blood from thy right side, and\r\n  from the left side of thy spouse. For this blood is the heart's\r\n  blood of your parents, and though it may seem to be of two kinds,\r\n  yet, in reality, it is only one. Mix the two kinds of blood, and\r\n  keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise\r\n  Masters. Then that which is generated will be nourished with its\r\n  own flesh and blood, and will complete its course of development\r\n  when the Moon has changed for the eighth time. If thou repeat this\r\n  process again and again, thou shalt see children's children, and\r\n  the offspring of thy body shall fill the world.' When Phoebus\r\n  had thus spoken, he winged his flight heavenward. In the morning\r\n  the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger,\r\n  and God gave to him and to his wife many children, who inherited\r\n  their father's glory, wealth, and knightly honours from generation\r\n  to generation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Dedicatory Epistle\" to his _Triumphal Chariot of Antimony_,\r\nBasil Valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Mercury appeared to me in a dream, and brought me back from my\r\n  devious courses to the one way. 'Behold me clad not in the garb of\r\n  the vulgar, but in the philosopher's mantle.' So he said, and\r\n  straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds. Then,\r\n  when he was tired, he sat down, and, turning to me, who had\r\n  followed him in the spirit, bade me mark that he no longer\r\n  possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first\r\n  have overcome every obstacle, if he had not been allowed a free\r\n  course. Encouraged by his friendly salutation, I addressed him in\r\n  the following terms: 'Mercury, eloquent scion of Atlas, and father\r\n  of all Alchemists, since thou hast guided me hitherto, shew me, I\r\n  pray thee, the way to those Blessed Isles, which thou hast\r\n  promised to reveal to all thine elect children. 'Dost thou\r\n  remember,' he replied, that when I quitted thy laboratory, I left\r\n  behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood,\r\n  that neither the wind could efface it, nor all-devouring time\r\n  destroy its indelible essence? Fetch it hither to me, that I may\r\n  not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which I now\r\n  am; but let me clothe myself warmly in it, and be closely incited\r\n  thereto, so that I may safely reach my bride, who is sick with\r\n  love. She has meekly borne many wrongs, being driven through water\r\n  and fire, and compelled to ascend and descend times without\r\n  number--yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of\r\n  entering with me the bridal chamber, wherein we expect to beget a\r\n  son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not\r\n  share with others. Yet may he bring his friends to the palace,\r\n  where sits enthroned the King of Kings, who communicates his\r\n  dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him.'\r\n\r\n  \"I brought him the garment, and it fitted him so closely, that it\r\n  looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of\r\n  Vulcan. 'Let us proceed,' he then said, and straightway sped\r\n  across the open field, while I boldly strove to keep up with my\r\n  guide.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus we reached his bride, whose virtue and constancy were equal\r\n  to his own. There I beheld their marvellous conjugal union and\r\n  nuptial consummation, whence was born the son crowned with the\r\n  royal diadem. When I was about to salute him as King of Kings and\r\n  Lord of Lords, my Genius stood by me and warned me not to be\r\n  deceived, since this was only the King's forerunner, but not the\r\n  King himself whom I sought.\r\n\r\n  \"When I heard the admonition, I did not know whether to be sad or\r\n  joyful. 'Depart,' then said Mercury, 'with this bridal gift, and\r\n  when you come to those disciples who have seen the Lord himself,\r\n  show them this sign.' And therewith he gave me a gold ring from\r\n  his son's finger. 'They know the golden branch which must be\r\n  consecrated to Proserpina before you can enter the palace of\r\n  Pluto. When he sees this ring, perhaps one will open to you with a\r\n  word the door of that chamber, where sits enthroned in his\r\n  magnificence the Desire of all Nations, who is known only to the\r\n  Sages.'\r\n\r\n  \"When he had thus spoken, the vision vanished, but the bridal gift\r\n  which I still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a\r\n  mere dream. It was of gold, but to me more precious than the most\r\n  prized of all metals. Unto you I will shew it when I am permitted\r\n  to see your faces, and to converse with you freely. Till that\r\n  earnestly wished-for time, I bid you farewell.\"\r\n\r\nOne result of the alchemical modes of expression was, that he who\r\ntried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into\r\ndire confusion. He did not know what substances to use in his\r\noperations; for when he was told to employ \"the homogeneous water of\r\ngold,\" for example, the expression might mean anything, and in despair\r\nhe distilled, and calcined, and cohobated, and tried to decompose\r\neverything he could lay hands on. Those who pretended to know abused\r\nand vilified those who differed from them.\r\n\r\nIn _A Demonstration of Nature_, by John A. Mehung (17th century),\r\nNature addresses the alchemical worker in the following words:--\r\n\r\n  \"You break vials, and consume coals, only to soften your brains\r\n  still more with the vapours. You also digest alum, salt, orpiment,\r\n  and altrament; you melt metals, build small and large furnaces,\r\n  and use many vessels; nevertheless I am sick of your folly, and\r\n  you suffocate me with your sulphurous smoke.... You would do\r\n  better to mind your own business, than to dissolve and distil so\r\n  many absurd substances, and then to pass them through alembics,\r\n  cucurbits, stills, and pelicans.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Madathanas, writing in 1622, says:--\r\n\r\n  \"Then I understood that their purgations, sublimations,\r\n  cementations, distillations, rectifications, circulations,\r\n  putrefactions, conjunctions, calcinations, incinerations,\r\n  mortifications, revivifications, as also their tripods, athanors,\r\n  reverberatory alembics, excrements of horses, ashes, sand, stills,\r\n  pelican-viols, retorts, fixations, etc., are mere plausible\r\n  impostures and frauds.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of _The Only Way_ (1677) says:\r\n\r\n  \"Surely every true Artist must look on this elaborate tissue of\r\n  baseless operations as the merest folly, and can only wonder that\r\n  the eyes of those silly dupes are not at last opened, that they\r\n  may see something besides such absurd sophisms, and read something\r\n  besides those stupid and deceitful books.... I can speak from\r\n  bitter experience, for I, too, toiled for many years ... and\r\n  endeavoured to reach the coveted goal by sublimation,\r\n  distillation, calcination, circulation, and so forth, and to\r\n  fashion the Stone out of substances such as urine, salt, atrament,\r\n  alum, etc. I have tried hard to evolve it out of hairs, wine,\r\n  eggs, bones, and all manner of herbs; out of arsenic, mercury, and\r\n  sulphur, and all the minerals and metals.... I have spent nights\r\n  and days in dissolving, coagulating, amalgamating, and\r\n  precipitating. Yet from all these things I derived neither profit\r\n  nor joy.\"\r\n\r\nAnother writer speaks of many would-be alchemists as \"floundering\r\nabout in a sea of specious book-learning.\"\r\n\r\nIf alchemists could speak of their own processes and materials as\r\nthose authors spoke whom I have quoted, we must expect that the\r\nalchemical language would appear mere jargon to the uninitiated. In\r\nBen Jonson's play _The Alchemist_, _Surley_, who is the sceptic of the\r\npiece, says to Subtle, who is the alchemist--\r\n\r\n      ... Alchemy is a pretty kind of game,\r\n      Somewhat like tricks o' the cards, to cheat a man\r\n      With charming ...\r\n      What else are all your terms,\r\n      Whereon no one of your writers 'grees with other?\r\n      Of your elixir, your _lac virginis_,\r\n      Your stone, your med'cine, and your chrysosperme,\r\n      Your sal, your sulphur, and your mercury,\r\n      Your oil of height, your tree of life, your blood,\r\n      Your marchesite, your tutie, your magnesia,\r\n      Your toad, your crow, your dragon, and your panther;\r\n      Your sun, your moon, your firmament, your adrop,\r\n      Your lato, azoch, zernich, chibrit, heutarit,\r\n      And then your red man, and your white woman,\r\n      With all your broths, your menstrues, and materials,\r\n      Of lye and egg-shells, women's terms, man's blood,\r\n      Hair o' the head, burnt clout, chalk, merds, and clay,\r\n      Powder of bones, scalings of iron, glass,\r\n      And moulds of other strange ingredients,\r\n      Would burst a man to name?\r\n\r\nTo which _Subtle_ answers,\r\n\r\n                And all these named\r\n      Intending but one thing; which art our writers\r\n      Used to obscure their art.\r\n      Was not all the knowledge\r\n      Of the Egyptians writ in mystic symbols?\r\n      Speak not the Scriptures oft in parables?\r\n      Are not the choicest fables of the poets,\r\n      That were the fountains and first springs of wisdom,\r\n      Wrapp'd in perplexed allegories?\r\n\r\nThe alchemists were very fond of using the names of animals as symbols\r\nof certain mineral substances, and of representing operations in the\r\nlaboratory by what may be called animal allegories. The _yellow lion_\r\nwas the alchemical symbol of yellow sulphides, the _red lion_ was\r\nsynonymous with cinnabar, and the _green lion_ meant salts of iron and\r\nof copper. Black sulphides were called _eagles_, and sometimes\r\n_crows_. When black sulphide of mercury is strongly heated, a red\r\nsublimate is obtained, which has the same composition as the black\r\ncompound; if the temperature is not kept very high, but little of the\r\nred sulphide is produced; the alchemists directed to urge the fire,\r\n\"else the black crows will go back to the nest.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A salamander lives in the fire, which imparts to it a\r\n               most glorious hue.\r\n\r\n               This is the reiteration, gradation, and amelioration\r\n               of the Tincture, or Philosopher's Stone; and the whole\r\n               is called its Augmentation.\r\n\r\n               FIG. XV.]\r\n\r\nThe salamander was called the king of animals, because it was supposed\r\nthat he lived and delighted in fire; keeping a strong fire alight\r\nunder a salamander was sometimes compared to the purification of gold\r\nby heating it.\r\n\r\nFig. XV., reduced from _The Book of Lambspring_ represents this\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists employed many signs, or shorthand expressions, in place\r\nof writing the names of substances. The following are a few of the\r\nsigns which were used frequently.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Saturn] Saturn, also lead; [Symbol: Jupiter] Jupiter, also\r\ntin; [Symbol: Mars-1] and [Symbol: Mars-2] Mars, also iron; [Symbol:\r\nSun] Sol, also gold; [Symbol: Venus] Venus, also copper; [Symbol:\r\nMercury-1], [Symbol: Mercury-2] and [Symbol: Mercury-3] Mercury;\r\n[Symbol: Moon] Luna, also silver; [Symbol: Sulphur] Sulphur; [Symbol:\r\nVitriol] Vitriol; [Symbol: Fire] fire; [Symbol: Air] air; [Symbol:\r\nWater] and [Symbol: Aquarius] water; [Symbol: Earth] earth; [Symbol:\r\nAqua Fortis] aqua fortis; [Symbol: Aqua Regis] aqua regis; [Symbol:\r\nAqua Vitæ] aqua vitæ; [Symbol: Day] day; [Symbol: Night] night;\r\n[Symbol: Amalgam] Amalgam; [Symbol: Alembic] Alembic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DEGENERACY OF ALCHEMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried to show that alchemy aimed at giving experimental proof\r\nof a certain theory of the whole system of nature, including humanity.\r\nThe practical culmination of the alchemical quest presented a\r\nthreefold aspect; the alchemists sought the stone of wisdom, for by\r\ngaining that they gained the control of wealth; they sought the\r\nuniversal panacea, for that would give them the power of enjoying\r\nwealth and life; they sought the soul of the world, for thereby they\r\ncould hold communion with spiritual existences, and enjoy the fruition\r\nof spiritual life.\r\n\r\nThe object of their search was to satisfy their material needs, their\r\nintellectual capacities, and their spiritual yearnings. The alchemists\r\nof the nobler sort always made the first of these objects subsidiary\r\nto the other two; they gave as their reason for desiring to make gold,\r\nthe hope that gold might become so common that it would cease to be\r\nsought after by mankind. The author of _An Open Substance_ says:\r\n\"Would to God ... all men might become adepts in our art, for then\r\ngold, the common idol of mankind, would lose its value, and we should\r\nprize it only for its scientific teaching.\"\r\n\r\nBut the desire to make gold must always have been a very powerful\r\nincentive in determining men to attempt the laborious discipline of\r\nalchemy; and with them, as with all men, the love of money was the\r\nroot of much evil. When a man became a student of alchemy merely for\r\nthe purpose of making gold, and failed to make it--as he always\r\ndid--it was very easy for him to pretend he had succeeded in order\r\nthat he might really make gold by cheating other people. Such a man\r\nrapidly degenerated into a charlatan; he used the language of alchemy\r\nto cover his frauds, and with the hope of deluding his dupes by\r\nhigh-sounding phrases. And, it must be admitted, alchemy lent itself\r\nadmirably to imposture. It promised unlimited wealth; it encouraged\r\nthe wildest dreams of the seeker after pleasure; and over these dreams\r\nit cast the glamour of great ideas, the idea of the unity of nature,\r\nand the idea of communion with other spheres of life, of calling in\r\nthe help of 'inheritors of unfulfilled renown,' and so it seemed to\r\ntouch to fine issues the sordidness of unblushing avarice.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the working with strange ingredients and odd-fashioned\r\ninstruments, and the employment of mouth-filling phrases, and scraps\r\nof occult learning which seemed to imply unutterable things, gave just\r\nthat pleasing dash of would-be wickedness to the process of consulting\r\nthe alchemist which acts as a fascination to many people. The earnest\r\nperson felt that by using the skill and knowledge of the alchemists,\r\nfor what he deemed a good purpose, he was compelling the powers of\r\nevil to work for him and his objects.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that such a system as alchemy should appear to the\r\nplain man of the middle ages, when the whole scheme of life and the\r\nuniverse rested on a magical basis, to be more than a kind of magic\r\nwhich hovered between the black magic of the Sorcerer and the white\r\nmagic of the Church. Nor is it to be wondered at that a system which\r\nlends itself to imposture so easily as alchemy did, should be thought\r\nof by the plain man of modern times as having been nothing but a\r\nmachinery of fraud.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the _Canon's Yeoman's Tale_ in Chaucer, that many\r\nof those who professed to turn the base metals into gold were held in\r\nbad repute as early as the 14th century. The \"false chanoun\" persuaded\r\nthe priest, who was his dupe, to send his servant for quicksilver,\r\nwhich he promised to make into \"as good silver and as fyn, As ther is\r\nany in youre purse or myn\"; he then gave the priest a \"crosselet,\" and\r\nbid him put it on the fire, and blow the coals. While the priest was\r\nbusy with the fire,\r\n\r\n      This false chanoun--the foulè feend hym fecche!--\r\n      Out of his bosom took a bechen cole,\r\n      In which ful subtilly was maad an hole,\r\n      And therinne put was of silver lemaille\r\n      An ounce, and stoppéd was withouten faille\r\n      The hole with wex, to kepe the lemaille in.\r\n\r\nThe \"false chanoun\" pretended to be sorry for the priest, who was so\r\nbusily blowing the fire:--\r\n\r\n      Ye been right hoot, I se wel how ye swete;\r\n      Have heer a clooth, and wipe awey the we't.\r\n      And whylès that the preest wipèd his face,\r\n      This chanoun took his cole with hardè grace,\r\n      And leyde it above, upon the middèward\r\n      Of the crosselet, and blew wel afterward.\r\n      Til that the colès gonnè fastè brenne.\r\n\r\nAs the coal burned the silver fell into the \"crosselet.\" Then the\r\ncanon said they would both go together and fetch chalk, and a pail of\r\nwater, for he would pour out the silver he had made in the form of an\r\ningot. They locked the door, and took the key with them. On returning,\r\nthe canon formed the chalk into a mould, and poured the contents of\r\nthe crucible into it. Then he bade the priest,\r\n\r\n      Look what ther is, put in thin hand and grope,\r\n      Thow fyndè shalt ther silver, as I hope.\r\n      What, devel of hellè! Sholde it ellis be?\r\n      Shavyng of silver silver is, _parde!_\r\n      He putte his hand in, and took up a teyne\r\n      Of silver fyn, and glad in every veyne\r\n      Was this preest, when he saugh that it was so.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the _Canon's Yeoman's Tale_ shows that, in the 14th\r\ncentury, there was a general belief in the possibility of finding the\r\nphilosopher's stone, and effecting the transmutation, although the\r\ncommon practitioners of the art were regarded as deceivers. A disciple\r\nof Plato is supposed to ask his master to tell him the \"namè of the\r\nprivee stoon.\" Plato gives him certain directions, and tells him he\r\nmust use _magnasia_; the disciple asks--\r\n\r\n      'What is Magnasia, good sire, I yow preye?'\r\n      'It is a water that is maad, I seye,\r\n      Of elementés fourè,' quod Plato.\r\n      'Telle me the rootè, good sire,' quod he tho,\r\n      Of that water, if it be yourè wille.'\r\n      'Nay, nay,' quod Plato, 'certein that I nylle;\r\n      The philosophres sworn were everychoon\r\n      That they sholden discovers it unto noon,\r\n      Ne in no book it write in no manere,\r\n      For unto Crist it is so lief and deere,\r\n      That he wol nat that it discovered bee,\r\n      But where it liketh to his deitee\r\n      Man for tenspire, and eek for to deffende\r\n      Whom that hym liketh; lo, this is the ende.'\r\n\r\nThe belief in the possibility of alchemy seems to have been general\r\nsometime before Chaucer wrote; but that belief was accompanied by the\r\nconviction that alchemy was an impious pursuit, because the\r\ntransmutation of baser metals into gold was regarded as trenching on\r\nthe prerogative of the Creator, to whom alone this power rightfully\r\nbelonged. In his _Inferno_ (which was probably written about the year\r\n1300), Dante places the alchemists in the eighth circle of hell, not\r\napparently because they were fraudulent impostors, but because, as one\r\nof them says, \"I aped creative nature by my subtle art.\"\r\n\r\nIn later times, some of those who pretended to have the secret and to\r\nperform great wonders by the use of it, became rich and celebrated,\r\nand were much sought after. The most distinguished of these\r\npseudo-alchemists was he who passed under the name of Cagliostro. His\r\nlife bears witness to the eagerness of human beings to be deceived.\r\n\r\nJoseph Balsamo was born in 1743 at Palermo, where his parents were\r\ntradespeople in a good way of business.[5] In the memoir of himself,\r\nwhich he wrote in prison, Balsamo seeks to surround his birth and\r\nparentage with mystery; he says, \"I am ignorant, not only of my\r\nbirthplace, but even of the parents who bore me.... My earliest\r\ninfancy was passed in the town of Medina, in Arabia, where I was\r\nbrought up under the name of Acharat.\"\r\n\r\n   [5] The account of the life of Cagliostro is much condensed\r\n   from Mr A.E. Waite's _Lives of the Alchemystical Philosophers_.\r\n\r\nWhen he was thirteen years of age, Balsamo's parents determined he\r\nshould be trained for the priesthood, but he ran away from his school.\r\nHe was then confined in a Benedictine monastery. He showed a\r\nremarkable taste for natural history, and acquired considerable\r\nknowledge of the use of drugs; but he soon tired of the discipline and\r\nescaped. For some years he wandered about in different parts of Italy,\r\nliving by his wits and by cheating. A goldsmith consulted him about a\r\nhidden treasure; he pretended to invoke the aid of spirits, frightened\r\nthe goldsmith, got sixty ounces of gold from him to carry on his\r\nincantations, left him in the lurch, and fled to Messina. In that\r\ntown he discovered an aged aunt who was sick; the aunt died, and left\r\nher money to the Church. Balsamo assumed her family name, added a\r\ntitle of nobility, and was known henceforward as the Count Alessandro\r\nCagliostro.\r\n\r\nIn Messina he met a mysterious person whom he calls Altotas, and from\r\nwhom, he says in his Memoir, he learnt much. The following account of\r\nthe meeting of Balsamo and the stranger is taken from Waite's book:\r\n\"As he was promenading one day near the jetty at the extremity of the\r\nport he encountered an individual singularly habited and possessed of\r\na most remarkable countenance. This person, aged apparently about\r\nfifty years, seemed to be an Armenian, though, according to other\r\naccounts, he was a Spaniard or Greek. He wore a species of caftan, a\r\nsilk bonnet, and the extremities of his breeches were concealed in a\r\npair of wide boots. In his left hand he held a parasol, and in his\r\nright the end of a cord, to which was attached a graceful Albanian\r\ngreyhound.... Cagliostro saluted this grotesque being, who bowed\r\nslightly, but with satisfied dignity. 'You do not reside in Messina,\r\nsignor?' he said in Sicilian, but with a marked foreign accent.\r\nCagliostro replied that he was tarrying for a few days, and they began\r\nto converse on the beauty of the town and on its advantageous\r\nsituation, a kind of Oriental imagery individualising the eloquence of\r\nthe stranger, whose remarks were, moreover, adroitly adorned with a\r\nfew appropriate compliments.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the stranger said he received no one at his house he allowed\r\nCagliostro to visit him. After various mysterious doings the two went\r\noff to Egypt, and afterwards to Malta, where they performed many\r\nwonderful deeds before the Grand Master, who was much impressed. At\r\nMalta Altotas died, or, at anyrate, vanished. Cagliostro then\r\ntravelled for some time, and was well received by noblemen,\r\nambassadors, and others in high position. At Rome he fell in love with\r\na young and beautiful lady, Lorenza Feliciani, and married her.\r\n\r\nCagliostro used his young wife as a decoy to attract rich and foolish\r\nmen. He and his wife thrived for a time, and accumulated money and\r\njewels; but a confederate betrayed them, and they fled to Venice, and\r\nthen wandered for several years in Italy, France, and England. They\r\nseem to have made a living by the sale of lotions for the skin, and by\r\npractising skilful deceptions.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1770 Cagliostro began to pose as an alchemist. After\r\nanother period of wandering he paid a second visit to London and\r\nfounded a secret society, based on (supposed) Egyptian rites, mingled\r\nwith those of freemasonry. The suggestion of this society is said to\r\nhave come from a curious book he picked up on a second-hand stall in\r\nLondon. The society attracted people by the strangeness of its\r\ninitiatory rites, and the promises of happiness and wellbeing made by\r\nits founder to those who joined it. Lodges were established in many\r\ncountries, many disciples were obtained, great riches were amassed,\r\nand Cagliostro flourished exceedingly.\r\n\r\nIn his _Histoire du Merveilleux dans les Temps modernes_, Figuier,\r\nspeaking of Cagliostro about this period of his career, says:\r\n\r\n\"He proclaimed himself the bearer of the mysteries of Isis and Anubis\r\nfrom the far East.... He obtained numerous and distinguished\r\nfollowers, who on one occasion assembled in great force to hear Joseph\r\nBalsamo expound to them the doctrines of Egyptian freemasonry. At this\r\nsolemn convention he is said to have spoken with overpowering\r\neloquence;... his audience departed in amazement and completely\r\nconverted to the regenerated and purified masonry. None doubted that\r\nhe was an initiate of the arcana of nature, as preserved in the temple\r\nof Apis at the era when Cambyses belaboured that capricious divinity.\r\nFrom this moment the initiations into the new masonry were numerous,\r\nalbeit they were limited to the aristocracy of society. There are\r\nreasons to believe that the grandees who were deemed worthy of\r\nadmission paid exceedingly extravagantly for the honour.\"\r\n\r\nCagliostro posed as a physician, and claimed the power of curing\r\ndiseases simply by the laying on of hands. He went so far as to assert\r\nhe had restored to life the dead child of a nobleman in Paris; the\r\ndiscovery that the miracle was effected by substituting a living child\r\nfor the dead one caused him to flee, laden with spoil, to Warsaw, and\r\nthen to Strassburg.\r\n\r\nCagliostro entered Strassburg in state, amid an admiring crowd, who\r\nregarded him as more than human. Rumour said he had amassed vast\r\nriches by the transmutation of base metals into gold. Some people in\r\nthe crowd said he was the wandering Jew, others that he had been\r\npresent at the marriage feast of Cana, some asserted he was born\r\nbefore the deluge, and one supposed he might be the devil. The\r\ngoldsmith whom he had cheated of sixty ounces of gold many years\r\nbefore was in the crowd, and, recognising him, tried to stop the\r\ncarriage, shouting: \"Joseph Balsamo! It is Joseph! Rogue, where are my\r\nsixty ounces of gold?\" \"Cagliostro scarcely deigned to glance at the\r\nfurious goldsmith; but in the middle of the profound silence which the\r\nincident occasioned among the crowd, a voice, apparently in the\r\nclouds, uttered with great distinctness the following words: 'Remove\r\nthis lunatic, who is possessed by infernal spirits.' Some of the\r\nspectators fell on their knees, others seized the unfortunate\r\ngoldsmith, and the brilliant cortege passed on\" (Waite).\r\n\r\nFrom Strassburg Cagliostro* went to Paris, where he lived in great\r\nsplendour, curing diseases, making gold and diamonds, mystifying and\r\nduping people of all ranks by the splendid ritual and gorgeous\r\nfeasting of his secret society, and amassing riches. He got entangled\r\nin the affair of the Diamond Necklace, and left Paris. Trying to\r\nadvance his society in Italy he was arrested by the agents of the\r\nInquisition, and imprisoned, then tried, and condemned to death. The\r\nsentence was commuted to perpetual imprisonment. After two years in\r\nthe prison of San Angelo he died at the age of fifty.\r\n\r\n   *Transcriber's Note: Original \"Cagliosto\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPARACELSUS AND SOME OTHER ALCHEMISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accounts which have come to us of the men who followed the pursuit\r\nof the _One Thing_ are vague, scrappy, and confusing.\r\n\r\nAlchemical books abound in quotations from the writings of _Geber_.\r\nFive hundred treatises were attributed to this man during the middle\r\nages, yet we have no certain knowledge of his name, or of the time or\r\nplace of his birth. Hoefer says he probably lived in the middle of the\r\n8th century, was a native of Mesopotamia, and was named _Djabar\r\nAl-Konfi_. Waite calls him _Abou Moussah Djafar al-Sofi_. Some of the\r\nmediæval adepts spoke of him as the King of India, others called him a\r\nPrince of Persia. Most of the Arabian writers on alchemy and medicine,\r\nafter the 9th century, refer to Geber as their master.\r\n\r\nAll the MSS. of writings attributed to Geber which have been examined\r\nare in Latin, but the library of Leyden is said to possess some works\r\nby him written in Arabic. These MSS. contain directions for preparing\r\nmany metals, salts, acids, oils, etc., and for performing such\r\noperations as distillation, cupellation, dissolution, calcination, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nOf the other Arabian alchemists, the most celebrated in the middle\r\nages were _Rhasis_, _Alfarabi_, and _Avicenna_, who are supposed to\r\nhave lived in the 9th and 10th centuries.\r\n\r\nThe following story of Alfarabi's powers is taken from Waite's _Lives\r\nof the Alchemystical Philosophers_:--\r\n\r\n  \"Alfarabi was returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca, when, passing\r\n  through Syria, he stopped at the Court of the Sultan, and entered\r\n  his presence, while he was surrounded by numerous sage persons,\r\n  who were discoursing with the monarch on the sciences. Alfarabi\r\n  ... presented himself in his travelling attire, and when the\r\n  Sultan desired he should be seated, with astonishing philosophical\r\n  freedom he planted himself at the end of the royal sofa. The\r\n  Prince, aghast at his boldness, called one of his officers, and in\r\n  a tongue generally unknown commanded him to eject the intruder.\r\n  The philosopher, however, promptly made answer in the same tongue:\r\n  'Oh, Lord, he who acts hastily is liable to hasty repentance.' The\r\n  Prince was equally astounded to find himself understood by the\r\n  stranger as by the manner in which the reply was given. Anxious to\r\n  know more of his guest he began to question him, and soon\r\n  discovered that he was acquainted with seventy languages. Problems\r\n  for discussion were then propounded to the philosophers, who had\r\n  witnessed the discourteous intrusion with considerable indignation\r\n  and disgust, but Alfarabi disputed with so much eloquence and\r\n  vivacity that he reduced all the doctors to silence, and they\r\n  began writing down his discourse. The Sultan then ordered his\r\n  musicians to perform for the diversion of the company. When they\r\n  struck up, the philosopher accompanied them on a lute with such\r\n  infinite grace and tenderness that he elicited the unmeasured\r\n  admiration of the whole distinguished assembly. At the request of\r\n  the Sultan he produced a piece of his own composing, sang it, and\r\n  accompanied it with great force and spirit to the delight of all\r\n  his hearers. The air was so sprightly that even the gravest\r\n  philosopher could not resist dancing, but by another tune he as\r\n  easily melted them to tears, and then by a soft unobtrusive melody\r\n  he lulled the whole company to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the alchemists was he who is generally known as\r\n_Paracelsus_. He was born about 1493, and died about 1540. It is\r\nprobable that the place of his birth was Einsiedeln, near Zurich. He\r\nclaimed relationship with the noble family of Bombast von Hohenheim;\r\nbut some of his biographers doubt whether he really was connected with\r\nthat family. His name, or at any rate the name by which he was known,\r\nwas Aureolus Philippus Theophrastus Bombast von Hohenheim. His father\r\nin alchemy, Trimethius, Abbot of Spannheim and then of Wurzburg, who\r\nwas a theologian, a poet, an astronomer, and a necromancer, named him\r\n_Paracelsus_; this name is taken by some to be a kind of Græco-Latin\r\nparaphrase of von Hohenheim (of high lineage), and to mean \"belonging\r\nto a lofty place\"; others say it signifies \"greater than Celsus,\" who\r\nwas a celebrated Latin writer on medicine of the 1st century.\r\nParacelsus studied at the University of Basle; but, getting into\r\ntrouble with the authorities, he left the university, and for some\r\nyears wandered over Europe, supporting himself, according to one\r\naccount, by \"psalm-singing, astrological productions, chiromantic\r\nsoothsaying, and, it has been said, by necromantic practices.\" He may\r\nhave got as far as Constantinople; as a rumour floated about that he\r\nreceived the Stone of Wisdom from an adept in that city. He returned\r\nto Basle, and in 1527 delivered lectures with the sanction of the\r\nRector of the university. He made enemies of the physicians by abusing\r\ntheir custom of seeking knowledge only from ancient writers and not\r\nfrom nature; he annoyed the apothecaries by calling their tinctures,\r\ndecoctions, and extracts, mere _soup-messes_; and he roused the ire of\r\nall learned people by delivering his lectures in German. He was\r\nattacked publicly and also anonymously. Of the pamphlets published\r\nagainst him he said, \"These vile ribaldries would raise the ire of a\r\nturtle-dove.\" And Paracelsus was no turtle-dove. The following extract\r\nfrom (a translation of) the preface to _The Book concerning the\r\nTinctures of the Philosophers written against those Sophists born\r\nsince the Deluge_, shews that his style of writing was abusive, and\r\nhis opinion of himself, to say the least, not very humble:--\r\n\r\n  \"From the middle of this age the Monarchy of all the Arts has been\r\n  at length derived and conferred on me, Theophrastus Paracelsus,\r\n  Prince of Philosophy and Medicine. For this purpose I have been\r\n  chosen by God to extinguish and blot out all the phantasies of\r\n  elaborate and false works, of delusive and presumptuous words, be\r\n  they the words of Aristotle, Galen, Avicenna, Mesva, or the\r\n  dogmas of any among their followers. My theory, proceeding as it\r\n  does from the light of Nature, can never, through its consistency,\r\n  pass away or be changed; but in the fifty-eighth year after its\r\n  millennium and a half it will then begin to flourish. The practice\r\n  at the same time following upon the theory will be proved by\r\n  wonderful and incredible signs, so as to be open to mechanics and\r\n  common people, and they will thoroughly understand how firm and\r\n  immovable is that Paracelsic Art against the triflings of the\r\n  Sophists; though meanwhile that sophistical science has to have\r\n  its ineptitude propped up and fortified by papal and imperial\r\n  privileges.... So then, you wormy and lousy Sophist, since you\r\n  deem the monarch of Arcana a mere ignorant, fatuous, and prodigal\r\n  quack, now, in this mid age, I determine in my present treatise to\r\n  disclose the honourable course of procedure in these matters, the\r\n  virtues and preparation of the celebrated Tincture of the\r\n  Philosophers for the use and honour of all who love the truth, and\r\n  in order that all who despise the true arts may be reduced to\r\n  poverty.\"\r\n\r\nThe turbulent and restless spirit of Paracelsus brought him into open\r\nconflict with the authorities of Basle. He fled from that town in\r\n1528, and after many wanderings, he found rest at Salzburg, under the\r\nprotection of the archbishop. He died at Salzburg in 1541, in his\r\nforty-eighth year.\r\n\r\nThe character and abilities of Paracelsus have been vastly praised by\r\nsome, and inordinately abused by others. One author says of him: \"He\r\nlived like a pig, looked like a drover, found his greatest enjoyment\r\nin the company of the most dissolute and lowest rabble, and throughout\r\nhis glorious life he was generally drunk.\" Another author says:\r\n\"Probably no physician has grasped his life's task with a purer\r\nenthusiasm, or devoted himself more faithfully to it, or more fully\r\nmaintained the moral worthiness of his calling than did the reformer\r\nof Einsiedeln.\" He certainly seems to have been loved and respected by\r\nhis pupils and followers, for he is referred to by them as \"the noble\r\nand beloved monarch,\" \"the German Hemes,\" and \"our dear Preceptor and\r\nKing of Arts.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems no doubt that Paracelsus discovered many facts which\r\nbecame of great importance in chemistry: he prepared the inflammable\r\ngas we now call hydrogen, by the reaction between iron filings and oil\r\nof vitriol; he distinguished metals from substances which had been\r\nclassed with metals but lacked the essential metalline character of\r\nductility; he made medicinal preparations of mercury, lead and iron,\r\nand introduced many new and powerful drugs, notably laudanum.\r\nParacelsus insisted that medicine is a branch of chemistry, and that\r\nthe restoration of the body of a patient to a condition of chemical\r\nequilibrium is the restoration to health.\r\n\r\nParacelsus trusted in his method; he was endeavouring to substitute\r\ndirect appeal to nature for appeal to the authority of writers about\r\nnature. \"After me,\" he cries, \"you Avicenna, Galen, Rhasis, Montagnana\r\nand the others. You after me, not I after you. You of Paris, you of\r\nMontpellier, you of Swabia, of Meissen and Vienna; you who come from\r\nthe countries along the Danube and the Rhine; and you, too, from the\r\nIslands of the Ocean. Follow me. It is not for me to follow you, for\r\nmine is the monarchy.\" But the work was too arduous, the struggle too\r\nunequal. \"With few appliances, with no accurate knowledge, with no\r\nhelp from the work of others, without polished and sharpened weapons,\r\nand without the skill that comes from long handling of instruments of\r\nprecision, what could Paracelsus effect in his struggle to wrest her\r\nsecrets from nature? Of necessity, he grew weary of the task, and\r\ntried to construct a universe which should be simpler than that most\r\ncomplex order which refused to yield to his analysis.\" And so he came\r\nback to the universe which man constructs for himself, and exclaimed--\r\n\r\n  \"Each man has ... all the wisdom and power of the world in\r\n  himself; he possesses one kind of knowledge as much as another,\r\n  and he who does not find that which is in him cannot truly say\r\n  that he does not possess it, but only that he was not capable of\r\n  successfully seeking for it.\"\r\n\r\nWe leave a great genius, with his own words in our ears: \"Have no care\r\nof my misery, reader; let me bear my burden myself. I have two\r\nfailings: my poverty and my piety. My poverty was thrown in my face by\r\na Burgomaster who had perhaps only seen doctors attired in silken\r\nrobes, never basking in tattered rags in the sunshine. So it was\r\ndecreed I was not a doctor. For my piety I am arraigned by the\r\nparsons, for ... I do not at all love those who teach what they do not\r\nthemselves practise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE ALCHEMICAL DOCTRINE.--THE REPLACEMENT OF THE THREE\r\nPRINCIPLES OF THE ALCHEMISTS BY THE SINGLE PRINCIPLE OF PHLOGISTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Sacred Art_, which had its origin and home in Egypt, was very\r\ndefinitely associated with the religious rites, and the theological\r\nteaching, recognised by the state. The Egyptian priests were initiated\r\ninto the mysteries of the divine art: and as the initiated claimed to\r\nimitate the work of the deity, the priest was regarded by the ordinary\r\npeople as something more than a representative, as a mirror, of the\r\ndivinity. The sacred art of Egypt was transmuted into alchemy by\r\ncontact with European thought and handicrafts, and the tenets and\r\nmysticism of the Catholic Church; and the conception of nature, which\r\nwas the result of this blending, prevailed from about the 9th until\r\ntowards the end of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nLike its predecessor, alchemy postulated an orderly universe; but\r\nalchemy was richer in fantastic details, more picturesquely\r\nembroidered, more prodigal of strange fancies, than the sacred art of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nThe alchemist constructed his ordered scheme of nature on the basis of\r\nthe supposed universality of life. For him, everything lived, and the\r\nlife of things was threefold. The alchemist thought he recognised the\r\nmanifestation of life in the form, or body, of a thing, in its soul,\r\nand in its spirit. Things might differ much in appearance, in size,\r\ntaste, smell, and other outward properties, and yet be intimately\r\nrelated, because, according to the alchemist, they were produced from\r\nthe same principles, they were animated by the same soul. Things might\r\nresemble one another closely in their outward properties and yet\r\ndiffer widely in essential features, because, according to the\r\nalchemist, they were formed from different elements, in their\r\nspiritual properties they were unlike. The alchemists taught that the\r\ntrue transformation, in alchemical language the transmutation, of one\r\nthing into another could be effected only by spiritual means acting on\r\nthe spirit of the thing, because the transmutation consisted\r\nessentially in raising the substance to the highest perfection whereof\r\nit was capable; the result of this spiritual action might become\r\napparent in the material form of the substance. In attempting to apply\r\nsuch vague conceptions as these, alchemy was obliged to use the\r\nlanguage which had been developed for the expression of human emotions\r\nand desires, not only for the explanation of the facts it observed,\r\nbut also for the bare recital of these facts.\r\n\r\nThe outlook of alchemy on the world outside human beings was\r\nessentially anthropomorphic. In the image of man, the alchemist\r\ncreated his universe.\r\n\r\nIn the times when alchemy was dominant, the divine scheme of creation,\r\nand the place given to man in that scheme, were supposed to be\r\nthoroughly understood. Everything had its place, designed for it from\r\nthe beginning, and in that place it remained unless it were forced\r\nfrom it by violent means. A great part of the business of experimental\r\nalchemy was to discover the natural position, or condition, of each\r\nsubstance; and the discovery was to be made by interpreting the facts\r\nbrought to light by observation and experiment by the aid of\r\nhypotheses deduced from the general scheme of things which had been\r\nformed independently of observation or experiment. Alchemy was a part\r\nof magic; for magic interprets and corrects the knowledge gained by\r\nthe senses by the touchstone of generalisations which have been\r\nsupplied, partly by the emotions, and partly by extra-human authority,\r\nand accepted as necessarily true.\r\n\r\nThe conception of natural order which regulates the life of the savage\r\nis closely related to that which guided the alchemists. The essential\r\nfeatures of both are the notion that everything is alive, and the\r\npersuasion that things can be radically acted on only by using life as\r\na factor. There is also an intimate connexion between alchemy and\r\nwitchcraft. Witches were people who were supposed to make an unlawful\r\nuse of the powers of life; alchemists were often thought to pass\r\nbeyond what is permitted to the creature, and to encroach on the\r\nprerogative of the Creator.\r\n\r\nThe long duration of alchemy shows that it appealed to some\r\ndeep-seated want of human beings. Was not that want the necessity for\r\nthe realisation of order in the universe? Men were unwilling to wait\r\nuntil patient examination of the facts of their own nature, and the\r\nfacts of nature outside themselves, might lead them to the realisation\r\nof the interdependence of all things. They found it easier to evolve a\r\nscheme of things from a superficial glance at themselves and their\r\nsurroundings; naturally they adopted the easier plan. Alchemy was a\r\npart of the plan of nature produced by this method. The extraordinary\r\ndominancy of such a scheme is testified to by the continued belief in\r\nalchemy, although the one experiment, which seems to us to be the\r\ncrucial experiment of the system, was never accomplished. But it is\r\nalso to be remembered that the alchemists were acquainted with, and\r\npractised, many processes which we should now describe as operations\r\nof manufacturing and technical chemistry; and the practical usefulness\r\nof these processes bore testimony, of the kind which convinces the\r\nplain man, to the justness of their theories.\r\n\r\nI have always regarded two facts as most interesting and instructive:\r\nthat the doctrine of the essential unity of all things, and the\r\nsimplicity of natural order, was accepted for centuries by many, I\r\nthink one may say, by most men, as undoubtedly a true presentation of\r\nthe divine scheme of things; and, secondly, that in more recent times\r\npeople were quite as certain of the necessary truth of the doctrine,\r\nthe exact opposite of the alchemical, that the Creator had divided his\r\ncreation into portions each of which was independent of all the\r\nothers. Both of these schemes were formed by the same method, by\r\nintrospection preceding observation; both were overthrown by the same\r\nmethod, by observation and experiment proceeding hand in hand with\r\nreasoning. In each case, the humility of science vanquished the\r\nconceit of ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe change from alchemy to chemistry is an admirable example of the\r\nchange from a theory formed by looking inwards, and then projected on\r\nto external facts, to a theory formed by studying facts, and then\r\nthinking about them. This change proceeded slowly; it is not possible\r\nto name a time when it may be said, here alchemy finishes and\r\nchemistry begins. To adapt a saying of one of the alchemists, quoted\r\nin a former chapter; alchemy would not easily give up its nature, and\r\nfought for its life; but an agent was found strong enough to overcome\r\nand kill it, and then that agent also had the power to change the\r\nlifeless remains into a new and pure body. The agent was the accurate\r\nand imaginative investigation of facts.\r\n\r\nThe first great step taken in the path which led from alchemy to\r\nchemistry was the substitution of one Principle, the Principle of\r\nPhlogiston, for the three Principles of salt, sulphur, and mercury.\r\nThis step was taken by concentrating attention and investigation, by\r\nreplacing the superficial examination of many diverse phenomena by the\r\nmore searching study of one class of occurrences. That the field of\r\nstudy should be widened, it was necessary that it should first be\r\nnarrowed.\r\n\r\nLead, tin, iron, or copper is calcined. The prominent and striking\r\nfeature of these events is the disappearance of the metal, and the\r\nformation of something very unlike it. But the original metal is\r\nrestored by a second process, which is like the first because it also\r\nis a calcination, but seems to differ from the first operation in that\r\nthe burnt metal is calcined with another substance, with grains of\r\nwheat or powdered charcoal. Led thereto by their theory that\r\ndestruction must precede re-vivification, death must come before\r\nresurrection, the alchemists confined their attention to one feature\r\ncommon to all calcinations of metals, and gave a superficial\r\ndescription of these occurrences by classing them together as\r\nprocesses of mortification. Sulphur, wood, wax, oil, and many other\r\nthings are easily burned: the alchemists said, these things also\r\nundergo mortification, they too are killed; but, as \"man can restore\r\nthat which man has destroyed,\" it must be possible to restore to life\r\nthe thing which has been mortified. The burnt sulphur, wood, wax, or\r\noil, is not really dead, the alchemists argued; to use the allegory of\r\nParacelsus, they are like young lions which are born dead, and are\r\nbrought to life by the roaring of their parents: if we make a\r\nsufficiently loud noise, if we use the proper means, we shall bring\r\nlife into what seems to be dead material. As it is the roaring of the\r\nparents of the young lions which alone can cause the still-born cubs\r\nto live, so it is only by the spiritual agency of life, proceeded the\r\nalchemical argument, that life can be brought into the mortified\r\nsulphur, wood, wax, and oil.\r\n\r\nThe alchemical explanation was superficial, theoretical, in the wrong\r\nmeaning of that word, and unworkable. It was superficial because it\r\noverlooked the fact that the primary calcination, the mortification,\r\nof the metals, and the other substances, was effected in the air, that\r\nis to say, in contact with something different from the thing which\r\nwas calcined; the explanation was of the kind which people call\r\ntheoretical, when they wish to condemn an explanation and put it out\r\nof court, because it was merely a re-statement of the facts in the\r\nlanguage of a theory which had not been deduced from the facts\r\nthemselves, or from facts like those to be explained, but from what\r\nwere supposed to be facts without proper investigation, and, if facts,\r\nwere of a totally different kind from those to which the explanation\r\napplied; and lastly, the explanation was unworkable, because it\r\nsuggested no method whereby its accuracy could be tested, no definite\r\nline of investigation which might be pursued.\r\n\r\nThat great naturalist, the Honourable Robert Boyle (born in 1626, died\r\nin 1691), very perseveringly besought those who examined processes of\r\ncalcination to pay heed to the action of everything which might take\r\npart in the processes. He was especially desirous they should consider\r\nwhat part the air might play in calcinations; he spoke of the air as a\r\n\"menstruum or additament,\" and said that, in such operations as\r\ncalcination, \"We may well take the freedom to examine ... whether\r\nthere intervene not a coalition of the parts of the body wrought upon\r\nwith those of the menstruum, whereby the produced concrete may be\r\njudged to result from the union of both.\"\r\n\r\nIt was by examining the part played by the air in processes of\r\ncalcination and burning that men at last became able to give\r\napproximately complete descriptions of these processes.\r\n\r\nBoyle recognised that the air is not a simple or elementary substance;\r\nhe spoke of it as \"a confused aggregate of effluviums from such\r\ndiffering bodies, that, though they all agree in constituting by their\r\nminuteness and various motions one great mass of fluid matter, yet\r\nperhaps there is scarce a more heterogeneous body in the world.\"\r\nClement of Alexandria who lived in the end of the 2nd, and the early\r\npart of the 3rd, century A.D., seems to have regarded the air as\r\nplaying a very important part in combustions; he said--\"Airs are\r\ndivided into two categories; an air for the divine flame, which is the\r\nsoul; and a material air which is the nourisher of sensible fire, and\r\nthe basis of combustible matter.\" Sentences like that I have just\r\nquoted are found here and there in the writings of the earlier and\r\nlater alchemists; now and again we also find statements which may be\r\ninterpreted, in the light of the fuller knowledge we now have, as\r\nindicating at least suspicions that the atmosphere is a mixture of\r\ndifferent kinds of air, and that only some of these take part in\r\ncalcining and burning operations. Those suspicions were confirmed by\r\nexperiments on the calcination of metals and other substances,\r\nconducted in the 17th century by Jean Rey a French physician, and by\r\nJohn Mayow of Oxford. But these observations and the conclusions\r\nfounded on them, did not bear much fruit until the time of Lavoisier,\r\nthat is, towards the close of the 18th century. They were overshadowed\r\nand put aside by the work of Stahl (1660-1724). Some of the alchemists\r\nof the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries taught that combustion and\r\ncalcination are processes wherein _the igneous principle_ is\r\ndestroyed, using the word \"destroyed\" in its alchemical meaning. This\r\ndescription of processes of burning was much more in keeping with the\r\nideas of the time than that given by Boyle, Rey and Mayow. It was\r\nadopted by Stahl, and made the basis of a general theory of those\r\nchanges wherein one substance disappears and another, or others, very\r\nunlike it, are produced.\r\n\r\nThat he might bring into one point of view, and compare the various\r\nchanges effected by the agency of fire, Stahl invented a new\r\nPrinciple, which he named _Phlogiston_, and constructed an hypothesis\r\nwhich is generally known as the phlogistic theory. He explained, and\r\napplied, this hypothesis in various books, especially in one published\r\nat Halle in 1717.\r\n\r\nStahl observed that many substances which differed much from one\r\nanother in various respects were alike in one respect; they were all\r\ncombustible. All the combustible substances, he argued, must contain a\r\ncommon principle; he named this supposed principle, _phlogiston_ (from\r\nthe Greek word _phlogistos_ = burnt, or set on fire). Stahl said that\r\nthe phlogiston of a combustible thing escapes as the substance burns,\r\nand, becoming apparent to the senses, is named fire or flame. The\r\nphlogiston in a combustible substance was supposed to be so\r\nintimately associated with something else that our senses cannot\r\nperceive it; nevertheless, the theory said, it is there; we can see\r\nonly the escaping phlogiston, we can perceive only the phlogiston\r\nwhich is set free from its combination with other things. The theory\r\nthought of phlogiston as imprisoned in the thing which can be burnt,\r\nand as itself forming part of the prison; that the prisoner should be\r\nset free, the walls of the prison had to be removed; the freeing of\r\nthe prisoner destroyed the prison. As escaping, or free, phlogiston\r\nwas called fire, or flame, so the phlogiston in a combustible\r\nsubstance was sometimes called combined fire, or flame in the state of\r\ncombination. A peculiarity of the strange thing called phlogiston was\r\nthat it preferred to be concealed in something, hidden, imprisoned,\r\ncombined; free phlogiston* was supposed to be always ready to become\r\ncombined phlogiston.\r\n\r\n   *Transcriber's Note: Original \"phlogstion\".\r\n\r\nThe phlogistic theory said that what remains when a substance has been\r\nburnt is the original substance deprived of phlogiston; and,\r\ntherefore, to restore the phlogiston to the product of burning is to\r\nre-form the combustible substance. But how is such a restoration of\r\nphlogiston to be accomplished? Evidently by heating the burnt thing\r\nwith something which is very ready to burn. Because, according to the\r\ntheory, everything which can be burnt contains phlogiston, the more\r\nready a substance is to burn the richer it is in phlogiston; burning\r\nis the outrush of phlogiston, phlogiston prefers to be combined with\r\nsomething; therefore, if you mix what remains after burning, with\r\nsomething which is very combustible, and heat the mixture, you are\r\nbringing the burnt matter under conditions which are very favourable\r\nfor the reception of phlogiston by it, for you are bringing it into\r\nintimate contact with something from which freedom-hating phlogiston\r\nis being forced to escape.\r\n\r\nCharcoal, sulphur, phosphorus, oils and fats are easily burnt; these\r\nsubstances were, therefore, chosen for the purpose of changing things\r\nwhich had been burnt into things which could again be burnt; these,\r\nand a few other substances like these, were classed together, and\r\ncalled _phlogisticating agents_.\r\n\r\nVery many of the substances which were dealt with by the experimenters\r\nof the last quarter of the 17th, and the first half of the 18th,\r\ncentury, were either substances which could be burned, or those which\r\nhad been produced by burning; hence the phlogistic theory brought into\r\none point of view, compared, and emphasised the similarities between,\r\na great many things which had not been thought of as connected before\r\nthat theory was promulgated. Moreover, the theory asserted that all\r\ncombustible, or incinerable, things are composed of phlogiston, and\r\nanother principle, or, as was often said, another element, which is\r\ndifferent in different kinds of combustible substances. The metals,\r\nfor instance, were said to be composed of phlogiston and an earthy\r\nprinciple or element, which was somewhat different in different\r\nmetals. The phlogisteans taught that the earthy principle of a metal\r\nremains in the form of ash, cinders, or calx, when the metal is\r\ncalcined, or, as they expressed it, when the metal is deprived of its\r\nphlogiston.\r\n\r\nThe phlogistic theory savoured of alchemy; it postulated an undefined,\r\nundefinable, intangible Principle; it said that all combustible\r\nsubstances are formed by the union of this Principle with another,\r\nwhich is sometimes of an earthy character, sometimes of a fatty\r\nnature, sometimes highly volatile in habit. Nevertheless, the theory\r\nof Stahl was a step away from purely alchemical conceptions towards\r\nthe accurate description of a very important class of changes. The\r\nprinciple of phlogiston could be recognised by the senses as it was in\r\nthe act of escaping from a substance; and the other principle of\r\ncombustible things was scarcely a Principle in the alchemical sense,\r\nfor, in the case of metals at any rate, it remained when the things\r\nwhich had contained it were burnt, and could be seen, handled, and\r\nweighed. To say that metals are composed of phlogiston and an earthy\r\nsubstance, was to express facts in such a language that the expression\r\nmight be made the basis of experimental inquiry; it was very different\r\nfrom the assertion that metals are produced by the spiritual actions\r\nof the three Principles, salt, mercury and sulphur, the first of which\r\nis not salt, the second is not mercury, and the third is not sulphur.\r\nThe followers of Stahl often spoke of metals as composed of phlogiston\r\nand an _element_ of an earthy character; this expression also was an\r\nadvance, from the hazy notion of _Element_ in purely alchemical\r\nwritings, towards accuracy and fulness of description. An element was\r\nnow something which could he seen and experimented with; it was no\r\nlonger a semi-spiritual existence which could not be grasped by the\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nThe phlogistic theory regarded the calcination of a metal as the\r\nseparation of it into two things, unlike the metal, and unlike each\r\nother; one of these things was phlogiston, the other was an earth-like\r\nresidue. The theory thought of the re-formation of a metal from its\r\ncalx, that is, the earthy substance which remains after combustion, as\r\nthe combination of two things to produce one, apparently homogeneous,\r\nsubstance. Metals appeared to the phlogisteans, as they appeared to\r\nthe alchemists, to be composite substances. Processes of burning were\r\nregarded by alchemists and phlogisteans alike, as processes of\r\nsimplification.\r\n\r\nThe fact had been noticed and recorded, during the middle ages, that\r\nthe earth-like matter which remains when a metal is calcined is\r\nheavier than the metal itself. From this fact, modern investigators of\r\nnatural phenomena would draw the conclusion, that calcination of a\r\nmetal is an addition of something to the metal, not a separation of\r\nthe metal into different things. It seems impossible to us that a\r\nsubstance should be separated into portions, and one of these parts\r\nshould weigh as much as, or more than, the whole.\r\n\r\nThe exact investigation of material changes called chemistry rests on\r\nthe statement that _mass_, and mass is practically measured by\r\n_weight_, is the one property of what we call matter, the\r\ndetermination whereof enables us to decide whether a change is a\r\ncombination, or coalescence, of different things, or a separation of\r\none thing into parts. That any part of a material system can be\r\nremoved without the weight of the portion which remains being less\r\nthan the original weight of the whole system, is unthinkable, in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge of material changes.\r\n\r\nBut in the 17th century, and throughout most of the 18th, only a few\r\nof those who examined changes in the properties of substances paid\r\nheed to changes of weight; they had not realised the importance of the\r\nproperty of mass, as measured by weight. The convinced upholder of the\r\nphlogistic theory had two answers to the argument, that, because the\r\nearth-like product of the calcination of a metal weighs more than the\r\nmetal itself, therefore the metal cannot have lost something in the\r\nprocess; for, if one portion of what is taken away weighs more than\r\nthe metal from which it has been separated, it is evident that the\r\nweight of the two portions into which the metal is said to have been\r\ndivided must be considerably greater than the weight of the undivided\r\nmetal. The upholders of the theory sometimes met the argument by\r\nsaying, \"Of course the calx weighs more than the metal, because\r\nphlogiston tends to lighten a body which contains it; and therefore\r\nthe body weighs more after it has lost phlogiston than it did when the\r\nphlogiston formed part of it;\" sometimes, and more often, their answer\r\nwas--\"loss or gain of weight is an accident, the essential thing is\r\nchange of qualities.\"\r\n\r\nIf the argument against the separation of a metal into two\r\nconstituents, by calcination, were answered to-day as it was answered\r\nby the upholders of the phlogistic theory, in the middle of the 18th\r\ncentury, the answers would justly be considered inconsequent and\r\nridiculous. But it does not follow that the statements were either\r\nfar-fetched or absurd at the time they were made. They were expressed\r\nin the phraseology of the time; a phraseology, it is true, sadly\r\nlacking in consistency, clearness, and appropriateness, but the only\r\nlanguage then available for the description of such changes as those\r\nwhich happen when metals are calcined. One might suppose that it must\r\nalways have sounded ridiculous to say that the weight of a thing can\r\nbe decreased by adding something to it, that part of a thing weighs\r\nmore than the whole of it. But the absurdity disappears if it can be\r\nadmitted that mass, which is measured by weight, may be a property\r\nlike colour, or taste, or smell; for the colour, taste, or smell of a\r\nthing may certainly be made less by adding something else, and the\r\ncolour, taste, or smell of a thing may also be increased by adding\r\nsomething else. If we did not know that what we call _quantity of\r\nsubstance_ is measured by the property named _mass_, we might very\r\nwell accept the proposition that the entrance of phlogiston into a\r\nsubstance decreases the quantity, hence the mass, and, therefore, the\r\nweight, of the substance.\r\n\r\nAlthough Stahl and his followers were emerging from the trammels of\r\nalchemy, they were still bound by many of the conceptions of that\r\nscheme of nature. We have learned, in previous chapters, that the\r\ncentral idea of alchemy was expressed in the saying: \"Matter must be\r\ndeprived of its properties in order to draw out its soul.\" The\r\nproperties of substances are everything to the modern chemist--indeed,\r\nsuch words as iron, copper, water, and gold are to him merely\r\nconvenient expressions for certain definable groups of properties--but\r\nthe phlogisteans regarded the properties of things, including mass, as\r\nof secondary importance; they were still trying to get beneath the\r\nproperties of a thing, to its hypothetical essence, or substance.\r\n\r\nLooking back, we cannot think of phlogiston as a substance, or as a\r\nthing, in the modern meanings of these terms as they are used in\r\nnatural science. Nowadays we think, we are obliged to think, of the\r\nsum of the quantities of all the things in the universe as unchanging,\r\nand unchangeable by any agency whereof we have definite knowledge. The\r\nmeaning we give to the word _thing_ rests upon the acceptance of this\r\nhypothesis. But the terms _substance_, _thing_, _properties_ were used\r\nvery vaguely a couple of centuries ago; and it would be truly absurd\r\nto carry back to that time the meanings which we give to these terms\r\nto-day, and then to brand as ridiculous the attempts of the men who\r\nstudied, then, the same problems which we study now, to express the\r\nresults of their study in generalisations which employed the terms in\r\nquestion, in what seems to us a loose, vague, and inexact manner.\r\n\r\nBy asserting, and to some extent experimentally proving, the existence\r\nof one principle in many apparently very different substances (or, as\r\nwould be said to-day, one property common to many substances), the\r\nphlogistic theory acted as a very useful means for collecting, and\r\nplacing in a favourable position for closer inspection, many\r\nsubstances which would probably have remained scattered and detached\r\nfrom one another had this theory not been constructed. A single\r\nassumption was made, that all combustible substances are alike in one\r\nrespect, namely, in containing combined fire, or phlogiston; by the\r\nhelp of this assumption, the theory of phlogiston emphasised the\r\nfundamental similarity between all processes of combustion. The theory\r\nof phlogiston was extraordinarily simple, compared with the alchemical\r\nvagaries which preceded it. Hoefer says, in his _Histoire de la\r\nChimie_, \"If it is true that simplicity is the distinctive character\r\nof verity, never was a theory so true as that of Stahl.\"\r\n\r\nThe phlogistic theory did more than serve as a means for bringing\r\ntogether many apparently disconnected facts. By concentrating the\r\nattention of the students of material changes on one class of events,\r\nand giving descriptions of these events without using either of the\r\nfour alchemical Elements, or the three Principles, Stahl, and those\r\nwho followed him, did an immense service to the advancement of clear\r\nthinking about natural occurrences. The principle of phlogiston was\r\nmore tangible, and more readily used, than the Salt, Sulphur, and\r\nMercury of the alchemists; and to accustom people to speak of the\r\nmaterial substance which remained when a metal, or other combustible\r\nsubstance, was calcined or burnt, as one of the _elements_ of the\r\nthing which had been changed, prepared the way for the chemical\r\nconception of an element as a definite substance with certain definite\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these advantages, the phlogistic theory was based on\r\nexperiments, and led to experiments, the results of which proved that\r\nthe capacity to undergo combustion might be conveyed to an\r\nincombustible substance, by causing it to react with some other\r\nsubstance, itself combustible, under definite conditions. The theory\r\nthus prepared the way for the representation of a chemical change as\r\nan interaction between definite kinds of substances, marked by precise\r\nalterations both of properties and composition.\r\n\r\nThe great fault of the theory of phlogiston, considered as a general\r\nconception which brings many facts into one point of view, and leads\r\nthe way to new and exact knowledge, was its looseness, its\r\nflexibility. It was very easy to make use of the theory in a broad and\r\ngeneral way; by stretching it here, and modifying it there, it seemed\r\nto cover all the facts concerning combustion and calcination which\r\nwere discovered during two generations after the publication of\r\nStahl's books. But many of the subsidiary hypotheses which were\r\nrequired to make the theory cover the new facts were contradictory, or\r\nat any rate seemed to be contradictory, of the primary assumptions of\r\nthe theory. The addition of this ancillary machinery burdened the\r\nmechanism of the theory, threw it out of order, and finally made it\r\nunworkable. The phlogistic theory was destroyed by its own\r\ncumbersomeness.\r\n\r\nA scientific theory never lasts long if its fundamental assumptions\r\nare stated so loosely that they may be easily modified, expanded,\r\ncontracted, and adjusted to meet the requirements of newly discovered\r\nfacts. It is true that the theories which have been of the greatest\r\nservice in science, as summaries of the relations between established\r\nfacts, and suggestions of lines of investigation, have been stated in\r\nterms whose full meaning has gradually unfolded itself. But the\r\nfoundations of these theories have been at once so rigidly defined and\r\nclearly stated as to be incapable of essential modification, and so\r\nfull of meaning and widely applicable as to cover large classes of\r\nfacts which were unknown when the theories were constructed. Of the\r\nfounders of the lasting and expansible theories of natural science, it\r\nmay be said, that \"thoughts beyond their thoughts to those high bards\r\nwere given.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF COMBUSTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alchemists thought that the most effectual method of separating a\r\ncomplex substance into more simple substances was to subject it to the\r\naction of heat. They were constantly distilling, incinerating,\r\nsubliming, heating, in order that the spirit, or inner kernel of\r\nthings, might be obtained. They took for granted that the action of\r\nfire was to simplify, and that simplification proceeded whatever might\r\nbe the nature of the substance which was subjected to this action.\r\nBoyle insisted that the effect of heating one substance may be, and\r\noften is, essentially different from the effect of heating another\r\nsubstance; and that the behaviour of the same substance when heated,\r\nsometimes varies when the conditions are changed. He takes the example\r\nof heating sulphur or brimstone: \"Exposed to a moderate fire in\r\nsubliming pots, it rises all into dry, and almost tasteless, flowers;\r\nwhereas being exposed to a naked fire, it affords store of a saline\r\nand fretting liquor.\" Boyle thought that the action of fire was not\r\nnecessarily to separate a thing into its principles or elements, but,\r\nin most cases, was either to rearrange the parts of the thing, so that\r\nnew, and it might be, more complex things, were produced, or to form\r\nless simple things by the union of the substance with what he called,\r\n\"the matter of fire.\" When the product of heating a substance, for\r\nexample, tin or lead, weighed more than the substance itself, Boyle\r\nsupposed that the gain in weight was often caused by the \"matter of\r\nfire\" adding itself to the substance which was heated. He commended to\r\nthe investigation of philosophers this \"subtil fluid,\" which is \"able\r\nto pierce into the compact and solid bodies of metals, and add\r\nsomething to them that has no despicable weight upon the balance, and\r\nis able for a considerable time to continue fixed in the fire.\" Boyle\r\nalso drew attention to the possibility of action taking place between\r\na substance which is heated and some other substance, wherewith the\r\noriginal thing may have been mixed. In a word, Boyle showed that the\r\nalchemical assumption--fire simplifies--was too simple; and he taught,\r\nby precept and example, that the only way of discovering what the\r\naction of fire is, on this substance or on that, is to make accurate\r\nexperiments. \"I consider,\" he says, \"that, generally speaking, to\r\nrender a reason of an effect or phenomenon, is to deduce it from\r\nsomething else in nature more known than itself; and that consequently\r\nthere may be divers kinds of degrees of explication of the same\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\nBoyle published his experiments and opinions concerning the action of\r\nfire on different substances in the seventies of the 17th century;\r\nStahl's books, which laid the foundation of the phlogistic theory, and\r\nconfirmed the alchemical opinion that the action of fire is\r\nessentially a simplifying action, were published about forty years\r\nlater. But fifty years before Boyle, a French physician, named Jean\r\nRey, had noticed that the calcination of a metal is the production of\r\na more complex, from a less complex substance; and had assigned the\r\nincrease in weight which accompanies that operation to the attachment\r\nof particles of the air to the metal. A few years before the\r\npublication of Boyle's work, from which I have quoted, John Mayow,\r\nstudent of Oxford, recounted experiments which led to the conclusion\r\nthat the air contains two substances, one of which supports combustion\r\nand the breathing of animals, while the other extinguishes fire. Mayow\r\ncalled the active component of the atmosphere _fiery air_; but he was\r\nunable to say definitely what becomes of this fiery air when a\r\nsubstance is burnt, although he thought that, in some cases, it\r\nprobably attaches itself to the burning substances, by which,\r\ntherefore, it may be said to be fixed. Mayow proved that the air\r\nwherein a substance is burnt, or an animal breathes, diminishes in\r\nvolume during the burning, or the breathing. He tried, without much\r\nsuccess, to restore to air that part of it which disappears when\r\ncombustion, or respiration, proceeds in it.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a substance is burnt in the air? The alchemists\r\nanswered this question by asserting that the substance is separated or\r\nanalysed into things simpler than itself. Boyle said: the process is\r\nnot necessarily a simplification; it may be, and certainly sometimes\r\nis, the formation of something more complicated than the original\r\nsubstance, and when this happens, the process often consists in the\r\nfixation of \"the matter of fire\" by the burning substance. Rey said:\r\ncalcination, of a metal at anyrate, probably consists in the fixation\r\nof particles of air by the substance which is calcined. Mayow answered\r\nthe question by asserting, on the ground of the results of his\r\nexperiments, that the substance which is being calcined lays hold of a\r\nparticular constituent of the air, not the air as a whole.\r\n\r\nNow, it is evident that if Mayow's answer was a true description of\r\nthe process of calcination, or combustion, it should be possible to\r\nseparate the calcined substance into two different things, one of\r\nwhich would be the thing which was calcined, and the other would be\r\nthat constituent of the air which had united with the burning, or\r\ncalcining, substance. It seems clear to us that the one method of\r\nproving the accuracy of Mayow's supposition must be, to weigh a\r\ndefinite, combustible, substance--say, a metal; to calcine this in a\r\nmeasured quantity of air; to weigh the product, and to measure the\r\nquantity of air which remains; to separate the product of calcination\r\ninto the original metal, and a kind of air or gas; to prove that the\r\nmetal thus obtained is the same, and has the same weight, as the metal\r\nwhich was calcined; and to prove that the air or gas obtained from the\r\ncalcined metal is the same, both in quality and quantity, as the air\r\nwhich disappeared in the process of calcination.\r\n\r\nThis proof was not forthcoming until about a century after the\r\npublication of Mayow's work. The experiments which furnished the proof\r\nwere rendered possible by a notable discovery made on the 1st of\r\nAugust 1774, by the celebrated Joseph Priestley.\r\n\r\nPriestley prepared many \"airs\" of different kinds: by the actions of\r\nacids on metals, by allowing vegetables to decay, by heating beef,\r\nmutton, and other animal substances, and by other methods. He says:\r\n\"Having procured a lens of twelve inches diameter and twenty inches\r\nfocal distance, I proceeded with great alacrity to examine, by the\r\nhelp of it, what kind of air a great variety of substances, natural\r\nand factitious, would yield.... With this apparatus, after a variety\r\nof other experiments.... on the 1st of August, 1774, I endeavoured to\r\nextract air from _mercurius calcinatus per se_; and I presently found\r\nthat, by means of this lens, air was expelled from it very readily.\r\nHaving got about three or four times as much as the bulk of my\r\nmaterials, I admitted water to it, and found that it was not imbibed\r\nby it. But what surprised me more than I can well express was, that a\r\ncandle burned in this air with a remarkably vigorous flame.... I was\r\nutterly at a loss how to account for it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. XVI.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used by Priestley, in his experiments on different kinds\r\nof air, is represented in Fig. XVI., which is reduced from an\r\nillustration in Priestley's book on _Airs_.\r\n\r\nPriestley had made a discovery which was destined to change Alchemy\r\ninto Chemistry. But he did not know what his discovery meant. It was\r\nreserved for the greatest of all chemists, Antoine Lavoisier, to use\r\nthe fact stumbled on by Priestley.\r\n\r\nAfter some months Priestley began to think it possible that the new\r\n\"air\" he had obtained from calcined mercury might be fit for\r\nrespiration. To his surprise he found that a mouse lived in this air\r\nmuch longer than in common air; the new air was evidently better, or\r\npurer, than ordinary air. Priestley measured what he called the\r\n\"goodness\" of the new air, by a process of his own devising, and\r\nconcluded that it was \"between four and five times as good as common\r\nair.\"\r\n\r\nPriestley was a thorough-going phlogistean. He seems to have been able\r\nto describe the results of his experiments only in the language of the\r\nphlogistic theory; just as the results of most of the experiments made\r\nto-day on the changes of compounds of the element carbon cannot be\r\ndescribed by chemists except by making use of the conceptions and the\r\nlanguage of the atomic and molecular theory.[6]\r\n\r\n   [6] I have given numerous illustrations of the truth of this\r\n   statement in the book, in this series, entitled _The Story of\r\n   the Wanderings of Atoms_.\r\n\r\nThe upholder of the phlogistic theory could not think of burning as\r\npossible unless there was a suitable receptacle for the phlogiston of\r\nthe burning substance: when burning occurred in the air, the part\r\nplayed by the air, according to the phlogistic chemist, was to receive\r\nthe expelled phlogiston; in this sense the air acted as the _pabulum_,\r\nor nourishment, of the burning substance. Inasmuch as substances\r\nburned more vigorously and brilliantly in the new air than in common\r\nair, Priestley argued that the new air was more ready, more eager,\r\nthan ordinary air, to receive phlogiston; and, therefore, that the new\r\nair contained less phlogiston than ordinary air, or, perhaps, no\r\nphlogiston. Arguing thus, Priestley, of course, named the new aeriform\r\nsubstance _dephlogisticated air_, and thought of it as ordinary air\r\ndeprived of some, or it might be all, of its phlogiston.\r\n\r\nThe breathing of animals and the burning of substances were supposed\r\nto load the atmosphere with phlogiston. Priestley spoke of the\r\natmosphere as being constantly \"vitiated,\" \"rendered noxious,\"\r\n\"depraved,\" or \"corrupted\" by processes of respiration and combustion;\r\nhe called those processes whereby the atmosphere is restored to its\r\noriginal condition (or \"depurated,\" as he said), \"dephlogisticating\r\nprocesses.\" As he had obtained his _dephlogisticated air_ by heating\r\nthe calx of mercury, that is the powder produced by calcining mercury\r\nin the air, Priestley was forced to suppose that the calcination of\r\nmercury in the air must be a more complex occurrence than merely the\r\nexpulsion of phlogiston from the mercury: for, if the process\r\nconsisted only in the expulsion of phlogiston, how could heating what\r\nremained produce exceedingly pure ordinary air? It seemed necessary\r\nto suppose that not only was phlogiston expelled from mercury during\r\ncalcination, but that the mercury also imbibed some portion, and that\r\nthe purest portion, of the surrounding air. Priestley did not,\r\nhowever, go so far as this; he was content to suppose that in some\r\nway, which he did not explain, the process of calcination resulted in\r\nthe loss of phlogiston by the mercury, and the gain, by the\r\ndephlogisticated mercury, of the property of yielding exceedingly pure\r\nor dephlogisticated air when it was heated very strongly.\r\n\r\nPriestley thought of properties in much the same way as the alchemists\r\nthought of them, as wrappings, or coverings of an essential something,\r\nfrom which they can be removed and around which they can again be\r\nplaced. The protean principle of phlogiston was always at hand, and,\r\nby skilful management, was ready to adapt itself to any facts. Before\r\nthe phenomena of combustion could be described accurately, it was\r\nnecessary to do two things; to ignore the theory of phlogiston, and to\r\nweigh and measure all the substances which take part in some selected\r\nprocesses of burning.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the attempts made in the past to describe natural\r\nevents, we are often inclined to exclaim, \"Why did investigators bind\r\nthemselves with the cords of absurd theories; why did they always wear\r\nblinkers; why did they look at nature through the distorting mists\r\nrising from their own imaginations?\" We are too ready to forget the\r\ntremendous difficulties which beset the path of him who is seeking\r\naccurate knowledge.\r\n\r\n  \"To climb steep hills requires slow pace at first.\"\r\n\r\nForgetting that the statements wherein the men of science of our own\r\ntime describe the relations between natural events are, and must be,\r\nexpressed in terms of some general conception, some theory, of these\r\nrelations; forgetting that the simplest natural occurrence is so\r\ncomplicated that our powers of description are incapable of expressing\r\nit completely and accurately; forgetting the uselessness of\r\ndisconnected facts; we are inclined to overestimate the importance of\r\nour own views of nature's ways, and to underestimate the usefulness of\r\nthe views of our predecessors. Moreover, as naturalists have not been\r\nobliged, in recent times, to make a complete renunciation of any\r\ncomprehensive theory wherein they had lived and moved for many years,\r\nwe forget the difficulties of breaking loose from a way of looking at\r\nnatural events which has become almost as real as the events\r\nthemselves, of abandoning a language which has expressed the most\r\nvividly realised conceptions of generations of investigators, of\r\nforming a completely new mental picture of natural occurrences, and\r\ndeveloping a completely new language for the expression of those\r\nconceptions and these occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe younger students of natural science of to-day are beginning to\r\nforget what their fathers told them of the fierce battle which had to\r\nbe fought, before the upholders of the Darwinian theory of the origin\r\nof species were able to convince those for whom the older view, that\r\nspecies are, and always have been, absolutely distinct, had become a\r\nmatter of supreme scientific, and even ethical, importance.\r\n\r\nA theory which has prevailed for generations in natural science, and\r\nhas been accepted and used by everyone, can be replaced by a more\r\naccurate description of the relations between natural facts, only by\r\nthe determination, labour, and genius of a man of supreme power. Such\r\na service to science, and humanity, was rendered by Darwin; a like\r\nservice was done, more than three-quarters of a century before Darwin,\r\nby Lavoisier.\r\n\r\nAntoine Laurent Lavoisier was born in Paris in 1743. His father, who\r\nwas a merchant in a good position, gave his son the best education\r\nwhich was then possible, in physical, astronomical, botanical, and\r\nchemical science. At the age of twenty-one, Lavoisier gained the prize\r\noffered by the Government for devising an effective and economical\r\nmethod of lighting the public streets. From that time until, on the\r\n8th of May 1794, the Government of the Revolution declared, \"The\r\nRepublic has no need of men of science,\" and the guillotine ended his\r\nlife, Lavoisier continued his researches in chemistry, geology,\r\nphysics, and other branches of natural science, and his investigations\r\ninto the most suitable methods of using the knowledge gained by\r\nnaturalists for advancing the welfare of the community.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VI., I said that when an alchemist boiled water in an open\r\nvessel, and obtained a white earthy solid, in place of the water which\r\ndisappeared, he was producing some sort of experimental proof of the\r\njustness of his assertion that water can be changed into earth.\r\nLavoisier began his work on the transformations of matter by\r\ndemonstrating that this alleged transmutation does not happen; and he\r\ndid this by weighing the water, the vessel, and the earthy solid.\r\n\r\nLavoisier had constructed for him a pelican of white glass (see Fig.\r\nXI., p. 88), with a stopper of glass. He cleaned, dried, and weighed\r\nthis vessel; then he put into it rain-water which he had distilled\r\neight times; he heated the vessel, removing the stopper from time to\r\ntime to allow the expanding air to escape, then put in the stopper,\r\nallowed the vessel to cool, and weighed very carefully. The difference\r\nbetween the second and the first weighing was the weight of water in\r\nthe vessel. He then fastened the stopper securely with cement, and\r\nkept the apparatus at a temperature about 30° or 40° below that of\r\nboiling water, for a hundred and one days. At the end of that time a\r\nfine white solid had collected on the bottom of the vessel. Lavoisier\r\nremoved the cement from the stopper, and weighed the apparatus; the\r\nweight was the same as it had been before the heating began. He\r\nremoved the stopper; air rushed in, with a hissing noise. Lavoisier\r\nconcluded that air had not penetrated through the apparatus during the\r\nprocess of heating. He then poured out the water, and the solid which\r\nhad formed in the vessel, set them aside, dried, and weighed the\r\npelican; it had lost 17-4/10 grains. Lavoisier concluded that the\r\nsolid which had formed in the water was produced by the solvent action\r\nof the water on the glass vessel. He argued that if this conclusion\r\nwas correct, the weight of the solid must be equal to the loss of\r\nweight suffered by the vessel; he therefore separated the solid from\r\nthe water in which it was suspended, dried, and weighed it. The solid\r\nweighed 4-9/10 grains. Lavoisier's conclusion seemed to be incorrect;\r\nthe weight of the solid, which was supposed to be produced by the\r\naction of the water on the vessel, was 12-1/2 grains less than the weight\r\nof the material removed from the vessel. But some of the material\r\nwhich was removed from the vessel might have remained dissolved in the\r\nwater: Lavoisier distilled the water, which he had separated from the\r\nsolid, in a glass vessel, until only a very little remained in the\r\ndistilling apparatus; he poured this small quantity into a glass\r\nbasin, and boiled until the whole of the water had disappeared as\r\nsteam. There remained a white, earthy solid, the weight of which was\r\n15-1/2 grains. Lavoisier had obtained 4-9/10 + 15-1/2 = 20-2/5 grains\r\nof solid; the pelican had lost 17-2/5 grains. The difference between\r\nthese weights, namely, 3 grains, was accounted for by Lavoisier as due\r\nto the solvent action of the water on the glass apparatus wherein it\r\nhad been distilled, and on the glass basin wherein it had been\r\nevaporated to dryness.\r\n\r\nLavoisier's experiments proved that when distilled water is heated in\r\na glass vessel, it dissolves some of the material of the vessel, and\r\nthe white, earthy solid which is obtained by boiling down the water is\r\nmerely the material which has been removed from the glass vessel. His\r\nexperiments also proved that the water does not undergo any change\r\nduring the process; that at the end of the operation it is what it was\r\nat the beginning--water, and nothing but water.\r\n\r\nBy this investigation Lavoisier destroyed part of the experimental\r\nbasis of alchemy, and established the one and only method by which\r\nchemical changes can be investigated; the method wherein constant use\r\nis made of the balance.\r\n\r\nLavoisier now turned his attention to the calcination of metals, and\r\nparticularly the calcination of tin. Boyle supposed that the increase\r\nin weight which accompanies the calcination of a metal is due to the\r\nfixation of \"matter of fire\" by the calcining metal; Rey regarded the\r\nincrease in weight as the result of the combination of the air with\r\nthe metal; Mayow thought that the atmosphere contains two different\r\nkinds of \"airs,\" and one of these unites with the heated metal.\r\nLavoisier proposed to test these suppositions by calcining a weighed\r\nquantity of tin in a closed glass vessel, which had been weighed\r\nbefore, and should be weighed after, the calcination. If Boyle's view\r\nwas correct, the weight of the vessel and the tin would be greater at\r\nthe end than it was at the beginning of the operation; for \"matter of\r\nfire\" would pass through the vessel and unite with the metal. If there\r\nwas no change in the total weight of the apparatus and its contents,\r\nand if air rushed in when the vessel was opened after the calcination,\r\nand the total weight was then greater than at the beginning of the\r\nprocess, it would be necessary to adopt either the supposition of Rey\r\nor that of Mayow.\r\n\r\nLavoisier made a series of experiments. The results were these: there\r\nwas no change in the total weight of the apparatus and its contents;\r\nwhen the vessel was opened after the calcination was finished, air\r\nrushed in, and the whole apparatus now weighed more than it did before\r\nthe vessel was opened; the weight of the air which rushed in was\r\nexactly equal to the increase in the weight of the tin produced by the\r\ncalcination, in other words, the weight of the inrushing air was\r\nexactly equal to the difference between the weights of the tin and the\r\ncalx formed by calcining the tin. Lavoisier concluded that to calcine\r\ntin is to cause it to combine with a portion of the air wherein it is\r\ncalcined. The weighings he made showed that about one-fifth of the\r\nwhole weight of air in the closed flask wherein he calcined tin had\r\ndisappeared during the operation.\r\n\r\nOther experiments led Lavoisier to suspect that the portion of the air\r\nwhich had united with the tin was different from the portion which had\r\nnot combined with that metal. He, therefore, set himself to discover\r\nwhether there are different kinds of \"airs\" in the atmosphere, and, if\r\nthere is more than one kind of \"air,\" what is the nature of that \"air\"\r\nwhich combines with a metal in the process of calcination. He proposed\r\nto cause a metallic calx (that is, the substance formed by calcining\r\na metal in the air) to give up the \"air\" which had been absorbed in\r\nits formation, and to compare this \"air\" with atmospheric air.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Priestley visited Paris, saw Lavoisier, and told him\r\nof the new \"air\" he had obtained by heating calcined mercury.\r\nLavoisier saw the great importance of Priestley's discovery; he\r\nrepeated Priestley's experiment, and concluded that the air, or gas,\r\nwhich he refers to in his Laboratory Journal as \"l'air dephlogistique\r\nde M. Priestley\" was nothing else than the purest portion of the air\r\nwe breathe. He prepared this \"air\" and burned various substances in\r\nit. Finding that very many of the products of these combustions had\r\nthe properties of acids, he gave to the new \"air\" the name _oxygen_,\r\nwhich means _the acid-producer_.\r\n\r\nAt a later time, Lavoisier devised and conducted an experiment which\r\nlaid bare the change of composition that happens when mercury is\r\ncalcined in the air. He calcined a weighed quantity of mercury for\r\nmany days in a measured volume of air, in an apparatus arranged so\r\nthat he was able to determine how much of the air disappeared during\r\nthe process; he collected and weighed the red solid which formed on\r\nthe surface of the heated mercury; finally he heated this red solid to\r\na high temperature, collected and measured the gas which was given\r\noff, and weighed the mercury which was produced. The sum of the\r\nweights of the mercury and the gas which were produced by heating the\r\ncalcined mercury was equal to the weight of the calcined mercury; and\r\nthe weight of the gas produced by heating the calcined mercury was\r\nequal to the weight of the portion of the air which had disappeared\r\nduring the formation of the calcined mercury. This experiment proved\r\nthat the calcination of mercury in the air consists in the combination\r\nof a constituent of the air with the mercury. Fig. XVII. (reduced from\r\nan illustration in Lavoisier's Memoir) represents the apparatus used\r\nby Lavoisier. Mayow's supposition was confirmed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. XVII.]\r\n\r\nLavoisier made many more experiments on combustion, and proved that in\r\nevery case the component of the atmosphere which he had named oxygen\r\ncombined with the substance, or with some part of the substance, which\r\nwas burned. By these experiments the theory of Phlogiston was\r\ndestroyed; and with its destruction, the whole alchemical apparatus of\r\nPrinciples and Elements, Essences and Qualities, Souls and Spirits,\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE RECOGNITION OF CHEMICAL CHANGES AS THE INTERACTIONS OF DEFINITE\r\nSUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experimental study of combustion made by Lavoisier proved the\r\ncorrectness of that part of Stahl's phlogistic theory which asserted\r\nthat all processes of combustion are very similar, but also proved\r\nthat this likeness consists in the combination of a distinct gaseous\r\nsubstance with the material undergoing combustion, and not in the\r\nescape therefrom of the _Principle of fire_, as asserted by the theory\r\nof Stahl. After about the year 1790, it was necessary to think of\r\ncombustions in the air as combinations of a particular gas, or _air_,\r\nwith the burning substances, or some portions of them.\r\n\r\nThis description of processes of burning necessarily led to a\r\ncomparison of the gaseous constituent of the atmosphere which played\r\nso important a part in these processes, with the substances which were\r\nburned; it led to the examination of the compositions of many\r\nsubstances, and made it necessary to devise a language whereby these\r\ncompositions could be stated clearly and consistently.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in former chapters, the extreme haziness of the\r\nalchemical views of composition, and the connexions between\r\ncomposition and properties. Although Boyle[7] had stated very lucidly\r\nwhat he meant by the composition of a definite substance, about a\r\ncentury before Lavoisier's work on combustion, nevertheless the views\r\nof chemists concerning composition remained very vague and incapable\r\nof definite expression, until the experimental investigations of\r\nLavoisier enabled him to form a clear mental picture of chemical\r\nchanges as interactions between definite quantities of distinct\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n   [7] Boyle said, in 1689, \"I mean by elements ... certain\r\n   primitive and simple, or perfectly unmixed bodies; which not\r\n   being made of any other bodies, or of one another, are the\r\n   ingredients of which all those called perfectly mixt bodies are\r\n   immediately compounded, and into which they are ultimately\r\n   resolved.\"\r\n\r\nLet us consider some of the work of Lavoisier in this direction. I\r\nselect his experimental examination of the interactions of metals and\r\nacids.\r\n\r\nMany experimenters had noticed that gases (or airs, as they were\r\ncalled up till near the end of the 18th century) are generally\r\nproduced when metals are dissolving in acids. Most of those who\r\nnoticed this said that the gases came from the dissolving metals;\r\nLavoisier said they were produced by the decomposition of the acids.\r\nIn order to study the interaction of nitric acid and mercury,\r\nLavoisier caused a weighed quantity of the metal to react with a\r\nweighed quantity of the acid, and collected the gas which was\r\nproduced; when all the metal had dissolved, he evaporated the liquid\r\nuntil a white solid was obtained; he heated this solid until it was\r\nchanged to the red substance called, at that time, _red precipitate_,\r\nand collected the gas produced. Finally, Lavoisier strongly heated the\r\nred precipitate; it changed to a gas, which he collected, and mercury,\r\nwhich he weighed.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the mercury obtained by Lavoisier at the end of this\r\nseries of changes was the same, less a few grains, as the weight of\r\nthe mercury which he had caused to react with the nitric acid. The gas\r\nobtained during the solution of the metal in the acid, and during the\r\ndecomposition of the white solid by heat, was the same as a gas which\r\nhad been prepared by Priestley and called by him _nitrous air_; and\r\nthe gas obtained by heating the red precipitate was found to be\r\noxygen. Lavoisier then mixed measured volumes of oxygen and \"nitrous\r\nair,\" standing over water; a red gas was formed, and dissolved in the\r\nwater, and Lavoisier proved that the water now contained nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions regarding the composition of nitric acid drawn by\r\nLavoisier from these experiments was, that \"nitric acid is nothing\r\nelse than _nitrous air_, combined with almost its own volume of the\r\npurest part of atmospheric air, and a considerable quantity of water.\"\r\n\r\nLavoisier supposed that the stages in the complete reaction between\r\nmercury and nitric acid were these: the withdrawal of oxygen from the\r\nacid by the mercury, and the union of the compound of mercury and\r\noxygen thus formed with the constituents of the acid which remained\r\nwhen part of its oxygen was taken away. The removal of oxygen from\r\nnitric acid by the mercury produced _nitrous air_; when the product of\r\nthe union of the oxide of mercury and the nitric acid deprived of part\r\nof its oxygen was heated, more nitrous air was given off, and oxide of\r\nmercury remained, and was decomposed, at a higher temperature, into\r\nmercury and oxygen.\r\n\r\nLavoisier thought of these reactions as the tearing asunder, by\r\nmercury, of nitric acid into definite quantities of its three\r\ncomponents, themselves distinct substances, nitrous air, water, and\r\noxygen; and the combination of the mercury with a certain measurable\r\nquantity of one of these components, namely, oxygen, followed by the\r\nunion of this compound of mercury and oxygen with what remained of the\r\ncomponents of nitric acid.\r\n\r\nLavoisier had formed a clear, consistent, and suggestive mental\r\npicture of chemical changes. He thought of a chemical reaction as\r\nalways the same under the same conditions, as an action between a\r\nfixed and measurable quantity of one substance, having definite and\r\ndefinable properties, with fixed and measurable quantities of other\r\nsubstances, the properties of each of which were definite and\r\ndefinable.\r\n\r\nLavoisier also recognised that certain definite substances could be\r\ndivided into things simpler than themselves, but that other substances\r\nrefused to undergo simplification by division into two or more unlike\r\nportions. He spoke of the object of chemistry as follows:--[8] \"In\r\nsubmitting to experiments the different substances found in nature,\r\nchemistry seeks to decompose these substances, and to get them into\r\nsuch conditions that their various components may be examined\r\nseparately. Chemistry advances to its end by dividing, sub-dividing,\r\nand again sub-dividing, and we do not know what will be the limits of\r\nsuch operations. We cannot be certain that what we regard as simple\r\nto-day is indeed simple; all we can say is, that such a substance is\r\nthe actual term whereat chemical analysis has arrived, and that with\r\nour present knowledge we cannot sub-divide it.\"\r\n\r\n   [8] I have given a free rendering of Lavoisier's words.\r\n\r\nIn these words Lavoisier defines the chemical conception of\r\n_elements_; since his time an element is \"the actual term whereat\r\nchemical analysis has arrived,\" it is that which \"with our present\r\nknowledge we cannot sub-divide\"; and, as a working hypothesis, the\r\nnotion of _element_ has no wider meaning than this. I have already\r\nquoted Boyle's statement that by _elements_ he meant \"certain\r\nprimitive and simple bodies ... not made of any other bodies, or of\r\none another.\" Boyle was still slightly restrained by the alchemical\r\natmosphere around him; he was still inclined to say, \"this _must_ be\r\nthe way nature works, she _must_ begin with certain substances which\r\nare absolutely simple.\" Lavoisier had thrown off all the trammels\r\nwhich hindered the alchemists from making rigorous experimental\r\ninvestigations. If one may judge from his writings, he had not\r\nstruggled to free himself from these trammels, he had not slowly\r\nemerged from the quagmires of alchemy, and painfully gained firmer\r\nground; the extraordinary clearness and directness of his mental\r\nvision had led him straight to the very heart of the problems of\r\nchemistry, and enabled him not only calmly to ignore all the machinery\r\nof Elements, Principles, Essences, and the like, which the alchemists\r\nhad constructed so laboriously, but also to construct, in place of\r\nthat mechanism which hindered inquiry, genuine scientific hypotheses\r\nwhich directed inquiry, and were themselves altered by the results of\r\nthe experiments they had suggested.\r\n\r\nLavoisier made these great advances by applying himself to the minute\r\nand exhaustive examination of a few cases of chemical change, and\r\nendeavouring to account for everything which took part in the\r\nprocesses he studied, by weighing or measuring each distinct substance\r\nwhich was present when the change began, and each which was present\r\nwhen the change was finished. He did not make haphazard experiments;\r\nhe had a method, a system; he used hypotheses, and he used them\r\nrightly. \"Systems in physics,\" Lavoisier writes, \"are but the proper\r\ninstruments for helping the feebleness of our senses. Properly\r\nspeaking, they are methods of approximation which put us on the track\r\nof solving problems; they are the hypotheses which, successively\r\nmodified, corrected, and changed, by experience, ought to conduct us,\r\nsome day, by the method of exclusions and eliminations, to the\r\nknowledge of the true laws of nature.\"\r\n\r\nIn a memoir wherein he is considering the production of carbonic acid\r\nand alcohol by the fermentation of fruit-juice, Lavoisier says, \"It is\r\nevident that we must know the nature and composition of the\r\nsubstances which can be fermented and the products of fermentation;\r\nfor nothing is created, either in the operations of art or in those of\r\nnature; and it may be laid down that the quantity of material present\r\nat the beginning of every operation is the same as the quantity\r\npresent at the end, that the quality and quantity of the principles[9]\r\nare the same, and that nothing happens save certain changes, certain\r\nmodifications. On this principle is based the whole art of\r\nexperimenting in chemistry; in all chemical experiments we must\r\nsuppose that there is a true equality between the principles[10] of\r\nthe substances which are examined and those which are obtained from\r\nthem by analysis.\"\r\n\r\n   [9, 10] Lavoisier uses the word _principle_, here and\r\n   elsewhere, to mean a definite homogeneous substance; he uses it\r\n   as synonymous with the more modern terms element and compound.\r\n\r\nIf Lavoisier's memoirs are examined closely, it is seen that at the\r\nvery beginning of his chemical inquiries he assumed the accuracy, and\r\nthe universal application, of the generalisation \"nothing is created,\r\neither in the operations of art or in those of nature.\" Naturalists\r\nhad been feeling their way for centuries towards such a generalisation\r\nas this; it had been in the air for many generations; sometimes it was\r\nalmost realised by this or that investigator, then it escaped for long\r\nperiods. Lavoisier seems to have realised, by what we call intuition,\r\nthat however great and astonishing may be the changes in the\r\nproperties of the substances which mutually react, there is no change\r\nin the total quantity of material.\r\n\r\nNot only did Lavoisier realise and act on this principle, he also\r\nmeasured quantities of substances by the one practical method, namely,\r\nby weighing; and by doing this he showed chemists the only road along\r\nwhich they could advance towards a genuine knowledge of material\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThe generalisation expressed by Lavoisier in the words I have quoted\r\nis now known as the _law of the conservation of mass_; it is generally\r\nstated in some such form as this:--the sum of the masses of all the\r\nhomogeneous substances which take part in a chemical (or physical)\r\nchange does not itself change. The science of chemistry rests on this\r\nlaw; every quantitative analysis assumes the accuracy, and is a proof\r\nof the validity, of it.[11]\r\n\r\n [11] I have considered the law of the conservation of mass in some\r\n detail in Chapter IV. of _The Story of the Chemical Elements_.\r\n\r\nBy accepting the accuracy of this generalisation, and using it in\r\nevery experiment, Lavoisier was able to form a clear mental picture of\r\na chemical change as the separation and combination of homogeneous\r\nsubstances; for, by using the balance, he was able to follow each\r\nsubstance through the maze of changes, to determine when it united\r\nwith other substances, and when it separated into substances simpler\r\nthan itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS CONTRASTED WITH THE ALCHEMICAL PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was known to many observers in the later years of the 17th century\r\nthat the product of the calcination of a metal weighs more than the\r\nmetal; but it was still possible, at that time, to assert that this\r\nfact is of no importance to one who is seeking to give an accurate\r\ndescription of the process of calcination. Weight, which measures mass\r\nor quantity of substance, was thought of, in these days, as a property\r\nlike colour, taste, or smell, a property which was sometimes\r\ndecreased, and sometimes increased, by adding one substance to\r\nanother. Students of natural occurrences were, however, feeling their\r\nway towards the recognition of some property of substances which did\r\nnot change in the haphazard way wherein most properties seemed to\r\nalter. Lavoisier reached this property at one bound. By his\r\nexperimental investigations, he taught that, however greatly the\r\nproperties of one substance may be masked, or altered, by adding\r\nanother substance to it, yet the property we call mass, and measure by\r\nweight, is not affected by these changes; for Lavoisier showed, that\r\nthe mass of the product of the union of two substances is always\r\nexactly the sum of the masses of these two substances, and the sum of\r\nthe masses of the substances whereinto one substance is divided is\r\nalways exactly equal to that mass of the substance which is divided.\r\n\r\nFor the undefined, ever-changing, protean essence, or soul, of a thing\r\nwhich the alchemists thought of as hidden by wrappings of properties,\r\nthe exact investigations of Lavoisier, and those of others who worked\r\non the same lines as he, substituted this definite, fixed,\r\nunmodifiable property of mass. Lavoisier, and those who followed in\r\nhis footsteps, also did away with the alchemical notion of the\r\nexistence of an essential substratum, independent of changes in those\r\nproperties of a substance which can be observed by the senses. For the\r\nexperimental researches of these men obliged naturalists to recognise,\r\nthat a change in the properties of a definite, homogeneous substance,\r\nsuch as pure water, pure chalk, or pure sulphur, is accompanied (or,\r\nas we generally say, is caused) by the formation of a new substance or\r\nsubstances; and this formation, this apparent creation, of new\r\nmaterial, is effected, either by the addition of something to the\r\noriginal substance, or by the separation of it into portions which are\r\nunlike it, and unlike one another. If the change is a combination, or\r\ncoalescence, of two things into one, then the mass, and hence the\r\nweight, of the product is equal to the sum of those masses, and hence\r\nthose weights, of the things which have united to form it; if the\r\nchange is a separation of one distinct substance into several\r\nsubstances, then the sum of the masses, and hence the weights, of the\r\nproducts is equal to that mass, and hence that weight, of the\r\nsubstance which has been separated.\r\n\r\nConsider the word _water_, and the substance represented by this word.\r\nIn Chapter IV., I gave illustrations of the different meanings which\r\nhave been given to this word; it is sometimes used to represent a\r\nmaterial substance, sometimes a quality more or less characteristic of\r\nthat substance, and sometimes a process to which that substance, and\r\nmany others like it, may be subjected. But when the word _water_ is\r\nused with a definite and exact meaning, it is a succinct expression\r\nfor a certain group, or collocation, of measurable properties which\r\nare always found together, and is, therefore, thought of as a distinct\r\nsubstance. This substance can be separated into two other substances\r\nvery unlike it, and can be formed by causing these to unite. One\r\nhundred parts, by weight, of pure water are always formed by the union\r\nof 11.11 parts of hydrogen, and 88.89 parts of oxygen, and can be\r\nseparated into these quantities of those substances. When water is\r\nformed by the union of hydrogen and oxygen, in the ratio of 11.11\r\nparts by weight of the former to 88.89 of the latter, the properties\r\nof the two substances which coalesce to form it disappear, except\r\ntheir masses. It is customary to say that water _contains_ hydrogen\r\nand oxygen; but this expression is scarcely an accurate description of\r\nthe facts. What we call _substances_ are known to us only by their\r\nproperties, that is, the ways wherein they act on our senses. Hydrogen\r\nhas certain definite properties, oxygen has other definite properties,\r\nand the properties of water are perfectly distinct from those of\r\neither of the substances which it is said to contain. It is,\r\ntherefore, somewhat misleading to say that water _contains_\r\nsubstances the properties whereof, except their masses, disappeared at\r\nthe moment when they united and water was produced. Nevertheless we\r\nare forced to think of water as, in a sense, containing hydrogen and\r\noxygen. For, one of the properties of hydrogen is its power to\r\ncoalesce, or combine, with oxygen to form water, and one of the\r\nproperties of oxygen is its ability to unite with hydrogen to form\r\nwater; and these properties of those substances cannot be recognised,\r\nor even suspected, unless certain definite quantities of the two\r\nsubstances are brought together under certain definite conditions. The\r\nproperties which characterise hydrogen, and those which characterise\r\noxygen, when these things are separated from all other substances, can\r\nbe determined and measured in terms of the similar properties of some\r\nother substance taken as a standard. These two distinct substances\r\ndisappear when they are brought into contact, under the proper\r\nconditions, and something (water) is obtained whose properties are\r\nvery unlike those of hydrogen or oxygen; this new thing can be caused\r\nto disappear, and hydrogen and oxygen are again produced. This cycle\r\nof changes can be repeated as often as we please; the quantities of\r\nhydrogen and oxygen which are obtained when we choose to stop the\r\nprocess are exactly the same as the quantities of those substances\r\nwhich disappeared in the first operation whereby water was produced.\r\nHence, water is an intimate union of hydrogen and oxygen; and, in this\r\nsense, water may be said to contain hydrogen and oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe alchemist would have said, the properties of hydrogen and oxygen\r\nare destroyed when these things unite to form water, but the essence,\r\nor substratum, of each remains. The chemist says, you cannot discover\r\nall the properties of hydrogen and oxygen by examining these\r\nsubstances apart from one another, for one of the most important\r\nproperties of either is manifested only when the two mutually react:\r\nthe formation of water is not the destruction of the properties of\r\nhydrogen and oxygen and the revelation of their essential substrata,\r\nit is rather the manifestation of a property of each which cannot be\r\ndiscovered except by causing the union of both.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, a certain degree of accuracy in the alchemical\r\ndescription of the processes we now call chemical changes, as being\r\nthe removal of the outer properties of the things which react, and the\r\nmanifestation of their essential substance. But there is a vast\r\ndifference between this description and the chemical presentment of\r\nthese processes as reactions between definite and measurable\r\nquantities of elements, or compounds, or both, resulting in the\r\nre-distribution, of the elements, or the separation of the compounds\r\ninto their elements, and the formation of new compounds by the\r\nre-combination of these elements.\r\n\r\nLet us contrast the two descriptions somewhat more fully.\r\n\r\nThe alchemist wished to effect the transmutation of one substance into\r\nanother; he despaired of the possibility of separating the Elements\r\nwhereof the substance might be formed, but he thought he could\r\nmanipulate what he called the _virtues_ of the Elements by a judicious\r\nuse of some or all of the three Principles, which he named Sulphur,\r\nSalt, and Mercury. He could not state in definite language what he\r\nmeant by these Principles; they were states, conditions, or qualities,\r\nof classes of substances, which could not be defined. The directions\r\nthe alchemist was able to give to those who sought to effect the\r\nchange of one thing into another were these. Firstly, to remove those\r\nproperties which characterised the thing to be changed, and leave only\r\nthe properties which it shared with other things like it; secondly, to\r\ndestroy the properties which the thing to be changed possessed in\r\ncommon with certain other things; thirdly, to commingle the Essence of\r\nthe thing with the Essence of something else, in due proportion and\r\nunder proper conditions; and, finally, to hope for the best, keep a\r\nclear head, and maintain a sense of virtue.\r\n\r\nIf he who was about to attempt the transmutation inquired how he was\r\nto destroy the specific properties, and the class properties, of the\r\nthing he proposed to change, and by what methods he was to obtain its\r\nEssence, and cause that Essence to produce the new thing, he would be\r\ntold to travel along \"the road which was followed by the Great\r\nArchitect of the Universe in the creation of the world.\" And if he\r\ndemanded more detailed directions, he would be informed that the\r\nsubstance wherewith his experiments began must first be mortified,\r\nthen dissolved, then conjoined, then putrefied, then congealed, then\r\ncibated, then sublimed, and fermented, and, finally, exalted. He\r\nwould, moreover, be warned that in all these operations he must use,\r\nnot things which he could touch, handle, and weigh, but the _virtues_,\r\nthe _lives_, the _souls_, of such things.\r\n\r\nWhen the student of chemistry desires to effect the transformation of\r\none definite substance into another, he is told to determine, by\r\nquantitative experiments, what are the elements, and what the\r\nquantities of these elements, which compose the compound which he\r\nproposes to change, and the compound into which he proposes to change\r\nit; and he is given working definitions of the words _element_ and\r\n_compound_. If the compound he desires to produce is found to be\r\ncomposed of elements different from those which form the compound\r\nwherewith his operations begin, he is directed to bring about a\r\nreaction, or a series of reactions, between the compound which is to\r\nbe changed, and some other collocation of elements the composition of\r\nwhich is known to be such that it can supply the new elements which\r\nare needed for the production of the new compound.\r\n\r\nSince Lavoisier realised, for himself, and those who were to come\r\nafter him, the meaning of the terms _element_ and _compound_, we may\r\nsay that chemists have been able to form a mental picture of the\r\nchange from one definite substance to another, which is clear,\r\nsuggestive, and consistent, because it is an approximately accurate\r\ndescription of the facts discovered by careful and penetrative\r\ninvestigations. This presentment of the change has been substituted\r\nfor the alchemical conception, which was an attempt to express what\r\nintrospection and reasoning on the results of superficial\r\ninvestigations, guided by specious analogies, suggested ought to be\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nLavoisier was the man who made possible the more accurate, and more\r\nfar-reaching, description of the changes which result in the\r\nproduction of substances very unlike those which are changed; and he\r\ndid this by experimentally analysing the conceptions of the element\r\nand the compound, giving definite and workable meanings to these\r\nconceptions, and establishing, on an experimental foundation, the\r\ngeneralisation that the sum of the quantities of the substances which\r\ntake part in any change is itself unchanged.\r\n\r\nA chemical element was thought of by Lavoisier as \"the actual term\r\nwhereat analysis has arrived,\" a definite substance \"which we cannot\r\nsubdivide with our present knowledge,\" but not necessarily a substance\r\nwhich will never be divided. A compound was thought of by him as a\r\ndefinite substance which is always produced by the union of the same\r\nquantities of the same elements, and can be separated into the same\r\nquantities of the same elements.\r\n\r\nThese conceptions were amplified and made more full of meaning by the\r\nwork of many who came after Lavoisier, notably by John Dalton, who was\r\nborn in 1766 and died in 1844.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter I., I gave a sketch of the atomic theory of the Greek\r\nthinkers. The founder of that theory, who flourished about 500 B.C.,\r\nsaid that every substance is a collocation of a vast number of minute\r\nparticles, which are unchangeable, indestructible, and impenetrable,\r\nand are therefore properly called _atoms_; that the differences which\r\nare observed between the qualities of things are due to differences in\r\nthe numbers, sizes, shapes, positions, and movements of atoms, and\r\nthat the process which occurs when one substance is apparently\r\ndestroyed and another is produced in its place, is nothing more than a\r\nrearrangement of atoms.\r\n\r\nThe supposition that changes in the properties of substances are\r\nconnected with changes in the numbers, movements, and arrangements of\r\ndifferent kinds of minute particles, was used in a general way by many\r\nnaturalists of the 17th and 18th centuries; but Dalton was the first\r\nto show that the data obtained by the analyses of compounds make it\r\npossible to determine the relative weights of the atoms of the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nDalton used the word _atom_ to denote the smallest particle of an\r\nelement, or a compound, which exhibits the properties characteristic\r\nof that element or compound. He supposed that the atoms of an element\r\nare never divided in any of the reactions of that element, but the\r\natoms of a compound are often separated into the atoms of the elements\r\nwhereof the compound is composed. Apparently without knowing that the\r\nsupposition had been made more than two thousand years before his\r\ntime, Dalton was led by his study of the composition and properties of\r\nthe atmosphere to assume that the atoms of different substances,\r\nwhether elements or compounds, are of different sizes and have\r\ndifferent weights. He assumed that when two elements unite to form\r\nonly one compound, the atom of that compound has the simplest\r\npossible composition, is formed by the union of a single atom of each\r\nelement. Dalton knew only one compound of hydrogen and nitrogen,\r\nnamely, ammonia. Analyses of this compound show that it is composed of\r\none part by weight of hydrogen and 4.66 parts by weight of nitrogen.\r\nDalton said one atom of hydrogen combines with one atom of nitrogen to\r\nform an atom of ammonia; hence an atom of nitrogen is 4.66 times\r\nheavier than an atom of hydrogen; in other words, if the _atomic\r\nweight_ of hydrogen is taken as unity, the _atomic weight_ of nitrogen\r\nis expressed by the number 4.66. Dalton referred the atomic weights of\r\nthe elements to the atomic weight of hydrogen as unity, because\r\nhydrogen is lighter than any other substance; hence the numbers which\r\ntell how much heavier the atoms of the elements are than an atom of\r\nhydrogen are always greater than one, are always positive numbers.\r\n\r\nWhen two elements unite in different proportions, by weight, to form\r\nmore than one compound, Dalton supposed that (in most cases at any\r\nrate) one of the compounds is formed by the union of a single atom of\r\neach element; the next compound is formed by the union of one atom of\r\nthe element which is present in smaller quantity with two, three, or\r\nmore, atoms of the other element, and the next compound is formed by\r\nthe union of one atom of the first element with a larger number\r\n(always, necessarily, a whole number) of atoms of the other element\r\nthan is contained in the second compound; and so on. From this\r\nassumption, and the Daltonian conception of the atom, it follows that\r\nthe quantities by weight of one element which are found to unite with\r\none and the same weight of another element must always be expressible\r\nas whole multiples of one number. For if two elements, A and B, form a\r\ncompound, that compound is formed, by supposition, of one atom of A\r\nand one atom of B; if more of B is added, at least one atom of B must\r\nbe added; however much of B is added the quantity must be a whole\r\nnumber of atoms; and as every atom of B is the same in all respects as\r\nevery other atom of B, the weights of B added to a constant weight of\r\nA must be whole multiples of the atomic weight of B.\r\n\r\nThe facts which were available in Dalton's time confirmed this\r\ndeduction from the atomic theory within the limits of experimental\r\nerrors; and the facts which have been established since Dalton's time\r\nare completely in keeping with the deduction. Take, for instance,\r\nthree compounds of the elements nitrogen and oxygen. That one of the\r\nthree which contains least oxygen is composed of 63.64 _per cent._ of\r\nnitrogen, and 36.36 _per cent._ of oxygen; if the atomic weight of\r\nnitrogen is taken to be 4.66, which is the weight of nitrogen that\r\ncombines with one part by weight of hydrogen, then the weight of\r\noxygen combined with 4.66 of nitrogen is 2.66 (63.64:36.36 =\r\n4.66:2.66). The weights of oxygen which combine with 4.66 parts by\r\nweight of nitrogen to form the second and third compounds,\r\nrespectively, must be whole multiples of 2.66; these weights are 5.32\r\nand 10.64. Now 5.32 = 2.66 x 2, and 10.64 = 2.66 x 4. Hence, the\r\nquantities by weight of oxygen which combine with one and the same\r\nweight of nitrogen are such that two of these quantities are whole\r\nmultiples of the third quantity.\r\n\r\nDalton's application of the Greek atomic theory to the facts\r\nestablished by the analyses of compounds enabled him to attach to each\r\nelement a number which he called the atomic weight of the element, and\r\nto summarise all the facts concerning the compositions of compounds in\r\nthe statement, that the elements combine in the ratios of their atomic\r\nweights, or in the ratios of whole multiples of their atomic weights.\r\nAll the investigations which have been made into the compositions of\r\ncompounds, since Dalton's time, have confirmed the generalisation\r\nwhich followed from Dalton's application of the atomic theory.\r\n\r\nEven if the theory of atoms were abandoned, the generalisation would\r\nremain, as an accurate and exact statement of facts which hold good in\r\nevery chemical change, that a number can be attached to each element,\r\nand the weights of the elements which combine are in the ratios of\r\nthese numbers, or whole multiples of these numbers.\r\n\r\nSince chemists realised the meaning of Dalton's book, published in\r\n1808, and entitled, _A New System of Chemical Philosophy_, elements\r\nhave been regarded as distinct and definite substances, which have not\r\nbeen divided into parts different from themselves, and unite with each\r\nother in definite quantities by weight which can be accurately\r\nexpressed as whole multiples of certain fixed quantities; and\r\ncompounds have been regarded as distinct and definite substances\r\nwhich are formed by the union of, and can be separated into,\r\nquantities of various elements which are expressible by certain fixed\r\nnumbers or whole multiples thereof. These descriptions of elements and\r\ncompounds are expressions of actual facts. They enable chemists to\r\nstate the compositions of all the compounds which are, or can be,\r\nformed by the union of any elements. For example, let A, B, C, and D\r\nrepresent four elements, and also certain definite weights of these\r\nelements, then the compositions of all the compounds which can be\r\nformed by the union of these elements are expressed by the scheme\r\nA_{_n_} B_{_m_} C_{_p_} D_{_q_}, where _m_ _n_ _p_ and _q_ are whole\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThese descriptions of elements and compounds also enable chemists to\r\nform a clear picture to themselves of any chemical change. They think\r\nof a chemical change as being; (1) a union of those weights of two, or\r\nmore, elements which are expressed by the numbers attached to these\r\nelements, or by whole multiples of these numbers; or (2) a union of\r\nsuch weights of two, or more, compounds as can be expressed by certain\r\nnumbers or by whole multiples of these numbers; or (3) a reaction\r\nbetween elements and compounds, or between compounds and compounds,\r\nresulting in the redistribution of the elements concerned, in such a\r\nway that the complete change of composition can be expressed by using\r\nthe numbers, or whole multiples of the numbers, attached to the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nHow different is this conception of a change wherein substances are\r\nformed, entirely unlike those things which react to form them, from\r\nthe alchemical presentment of such a process! The alchemist spoke of\r\nstripping off the outer properties of the thing to be changed, and, by\r\noperating spiritually on the soul which was thus laid bare, inducing\r\nthe essential virtue of the substance to exhibit its powers of\r\ntransmutation. But he was unable to give definite meanings to the\r\nexpressions which he used, he was unable to think clearly about the\r\ntransformations which he tried to accomplish. The chemist discards the\r\nmachinery of virtues, souls, and powers. It is true that he\r\nsubstitutes a machinery of minute particles; but this machinery is\r\nmerely a means of thinking clearly and consistently about the changes\r\nwhich he studies. The alchemist thought, vaguely, of substance as\r\nsomething underlying, and independent of, properties; the chemist uses\r\nthe expression, this or that substance, as a convenient way of\r\npresenting and reasoning about certain groups of properties. It seems\r\nto me that if we think of _matter_ as something more than properties\r\nrecognised by the senses, we are going back on the road which leads to\r\nthe confusion of the alchemical times.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists expressed their conceptions in what seems to us a\r\ncrude, inconsistent, and very undescriptive language. Chemists use a\r\nlanguage which is certainly symbolical, but also intelligible, and on\r\nthe whole fairly descriptive of the facts.\r\n\r\nA name is given to each elementary substance, that is, each substance\r\nwhich has not been decomposed; the name generally expresses some\r\ncharacteristic property of the substance, or tells something about\r\nits origin or the place of its discovery. The names of compounds are\r\nformed by putting together the names of the elements which combine to\r\nproduce them; and the relative quantities of these elements are\r\nindicated either by the use of Latin or Greek prefixes, or by\r\nvariations in the terminal syllables of the names of the elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN FORM OF THE ALCHEMICAL QUEST OF THE ONE THING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of the properties of the elements shows that these\r\nsubstances fall into groups, the members of each of which are like one\r\nanother, and form compounds which are similar. The examination of the\r\nproperties and compositions of compounds has shown that similarity of\r\nproperties is always accompanied by similarity of composition. Hence,\r\nthe fact that certain elements are very closely allied in their\r\nproperties suggests that these elements may also be allied in their\r\ncomposition. Now, to speak of the composition of an element is to\r\nthink of the element as formed by the union of at least two different\r\nsubstances; it implies the supposition that some elements at any rate\r\nare really compounds.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there is a very definite connexion between the values of\r\nthe atomic weights, and the properties, of the elements, lends some\r\nsupport to the hypothesis that the substances we call, and are obliged\r\nat present to call, elements, may have been formed from one, or a few,\r\ndistinct substances, by some process of progressive change. If the\r\nelements are considered in the order of increasing atomic weights,\r\nfrom hydrogen, whose atomic weight is taken as unity because it is the\r\nlightest substance known, to uranium, an atom of which is 240 times\r\nheavier than an atom of hydrogen, it is found that the elements fall\r\ninto periods, and the properties of those in one period vary from\r\nelement to element, in a way which is, broadly and on the whole, like\r\nthe variation of the properties of those in other periods. This fact\r\nsuggests the supposition--it might be more accurate to say the\r\nspeculation--that the elements mark the stable points in a process of\r\nchange, which has not proceeded continuously from a very simple\r\nsubstance to a very complex one, but has repeated itself, with certain\r\nvariations, again and again. If such a process has occurred, we might\r\nreasonably expect to find substances exhibiting only minute\r\ndifferences in their properties, differences so slight as to make it\r\nimpossible to assign the substances, definitely and certainly, either\r\nto the class of elements or to that of compounds. We find exactly such\r\nsubstances among what are called the _rare earths_. There are\r\nearth-like substances which exhibit no differences of chemical\r\nproperties, and yet show minute differences in the characters of the\r\nlight which they emit when they are raised to a very high\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe results of analysis by the spectroscope of the light emitted by\r\ncertain elements at different temperatures may be reasonably\r\ninterpreted by supposing that these elements are separated into\r\nsimpler substances by the action on them of very large quantities of\r\nthermal energy. The spectrum of the light emitted by glowing iron\r\nheated by a Bunsen flame (say, at 1200° C. = about 2200° F.) shows a\r\nfew lines and flutings; when iron is heated in an electric arc (say,\r\nto 3500° C. = about 6300° F.) the spectrum shows some two thousand\r\nlines; at the higher temperature produced by the electric\r\nspark-discharge, the spectrum shows only a few lines. As a guide to\r\nfurther investigation, we may provisionally infer from these facts\r\nthat iron is changed at very high temperatures into substances simpler\r\nthan itself.\r\n\r\nSir Norman Lockyer's study of the spectra of the light from stars has\r\nshown that the light from those stars which are presumably the\r\nhottest, judging by the general character of their spectra, reveals\r\nthe presence of a very small number of chemical elements; and that the\r\nnumber of spectral lines, and, therefore, the number of elements,\r\nincreases as we pass from the hottest to cooler stars. At each stage\r\nof the change from the hottest to cooler stars certain substances\r\ndisappear and certain other substances take their places. It may be\r\nsupposed, as a suggestive hypothesis, that the lowering of stellar\r\ntemperature is accompanied by the formation, from simpler forms of\r\nmatter, of such elements as iron, calcium, manganese, and other\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1896, the French chemist Becquerel discovered the fact\r\nthat salts of the metal uranium, the atomic weight of which is 240,\r\nand is greater than that of any other element, emit rays which cause\r\nelectrified bodies to lose their electric charges, and act on\r\nphotographic plates that are wrapped in sheets of black paper, or in\r\nthin sheets of other substances which stop rays of light. The\r\n_radio-activity_ of salts of uranium was proved not to be increased or\r\ndiminished when these salts had been shielded for five years from the\r\naction of light by keeping them in leaden boxes. Shortly after\r\nBecquerel's discovery, experiments proved that salts of the rare metal\r\nthorium are radio-active. This discovery was followed by Madame\r\nCurie's demonstration of the fact that certain specimens of\r\n_pitchblende_, a mineral which contains compounds of uranium and of\r\nmany other metals, are extremely radio-active, and by the separation\r\nfrom pitchblende, by Monsieur and Madame Curie, of new substances much\r\nmore radio-active than compounds of uranium or of thorium. The new\r\nsubstances were proved to be compounds chemically very similar to\r\nsalts of barium. Their compositions were determined on the supposition\r\nthat they were salts of an unknown metal closely allied to barium.\r\nBecause of the great radio-activity of the compounds, the hypothetical\r\nmetal of them was named _Radium_. At a later time, radium was isolated\r\nby Madame Curie. It is described by her as a white, hard, metal-like\r\nsolid, which reacts with water at the ordinary temperature, as barium\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of radium compounds, many radio-active substances\r\nhave been isolated. Only exceedingly minute quantities of any of them\r\nhave been obtained. The quantities of substances used in experiments\r\non radio-activity are so small that they escape the ordinary methods\r\nof measurement, and are scarcely amenable to the ordinary processes of\r\nthe chemical laboratory. Fortunately, radio-activity can be detected\r\nand measured by electrical methods of extraordinary fineness, methods\r\nthe delicacy of which very much more exceeds that of spectroscopic\r\nmethods than the sensitiveness of these surpasses that of ordinary\r\nchemical analysis.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the discovery of radio-activity, about seventy-five\r\nsubstances were called elements; in other words, about seventy-five\r\ndifferent substances were known to chemists, none of which had been\r\nseparated into unlike parts, none of which had been made by the\r\ncoalescence of unlike substances. Compounds of only two of these\r\nsubstances, uranium and thorium, are radio-active. Radio-activity is a\r\nvery remarkable phenomenon. So far as we know at present,\r\nradio-activity is not a property of the substances which form almost\r\nthe whole of the rocks, the waters, and the atmosphere of the earth;\r\nit is not a property of the materials which constitute living\r\norganisms. It is a property of some thirty substances--of course, the\r\nnumber may be increased--a few of which are found widely distributed\r\nin rocks and waters, but none of which is found anywhere except in\r\nextraordinarily minute quantity. Radium is the most abundant of these\r\nsubstances; but only a very few grains of radium chloride can be\r\nobtained from a couple of tons of pitchblende.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter X. of _The Story of the Chemical Elements_ I have given a\r\nshort account of the outstanding phenomena of radio-activity; for the\r\npresent purpose it will suffice to state a few facts of fundamental\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nRadio-active substances are stores of energy, some of which is\r\nconstantly escaping from them; they are constantly changing without\r\nexternal compulsion, and are constantly radiating energy: all\r\nexplosives are storehouses of energy which, or part of which, can be\r\nobtained from them; but the liberation of their energy must be started\r\nby some kind of external shock. When an explosive substance has\r\nexploded, its existence as an explosive is finished; the products of\r\nthe explosion are substances from which energy cannot be obtained:\r\nwhen a radio-active substance has exploded, it explodes again, and\r\nagain, and again; a time comes, sooner or later, when it has changed\r\ninto substances that are useless as sources of energy. The\r\ndisintegration of an explosive, started by an external force, is\r\ngenerally completed in a fraction of a second; change of condition\r\nchanges the rate of explosion: the \"half-life period\" of each\r\nradio-active substance is a constant characteristic of it; if a gram\r\nof radium were kept for about 1800 years, half of it would have\r\nchanged into radio-inactive substances. Conditions may be arranged so\r\nthat an explosive remains unchanged--wet gun-cotton is not exploded by\r\na shock which would start the explosion of dry gun-cotton--in other\r\nwords, the explosion of an explosive can be regulated: the explosive\r\nchanges of a radio-active substance, which are accompanied by the\r\nradiation of energy, cannot be regulated; they proceed spontaneously\r\nin a regular and definable manner which is not influenced by any\r\nexternal conditions--such as great change of temperature, presence or\r\nabsence of other substances--so far as these conditions have been made\r\nthe subject of experiment: the amount of activity of a radio-active\r\nsubstance has not been increased or diminished by any process to which\r\nthe substance has been subjected. Explosives are manufactured\r\narticles; explosiveness is a property of certain arrangements of\r\ncertain quantities of certain elements: so far as experiments have\r\ngone, it has not been found possible to add the property of\r\nradio-activity to an inactive substance, or to remove the property of\r\nradio-activity from an active substance; the cessation of the\r\nradio-activity of an active substance is accompanied by the\r\ndisappearance of the substance, and the production of inactive bodies\r\naltogether unlike the original active body.\r\n\r\nRadio-active substances are constantly giving off energy in the form\r\nof heat, sending forth _rays_ which have definite and remarkable\r\nproperties, and producing gaseous _emanations_ which are very\r\nunstable, and change, some very rapidly, some less rapidly, into other\r\nsubstances, and emit _rays_ which are generally the same as the rays\r\nemitted by the parent substance. In briefly considering these three\r\nphenomena, I shall choose radium compounds as representative of the\r\nclass of radio-active substances.\r\n\r\nRadium compounds spontaneously give off energy in the form of heat. A\r\nquantity of radium chloride which contains 1 gram of radium\r\ncontinuously gives out, per hour, a quantity of heat sufficient to\r\nraise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 100° C., or 100 grams\r\nof water through 1° C. The heat given out by 1 gram of radium during\r\ntwenty-four hours would raise the temperature of 2400 grams of water\r\nthrough 1° C.; in one year the temperature of 876,000 grams of water\r\nwould be raised through 1° C.; and in 1800 years, which is\r\napproximately the half-life period of radium, the temperature of\r\n1,576,800 _kilograms_ of water would be raised through 1° C. These\r\nresults may be expressed by saying that if 1 gram (about 15 grains) of\r\nradium were kept until half of it had changed into inactive\r\nsubstances, and if the heat spontaneously produced during the changes\r\nwhich occurred were caused to act on water, that quantity of heat\r\nwould raise the temperature of about 15½ tons of water from its\r\nfreezing- to its boiling-point.\r\n\r\nRadium compounds send forth three kinds of rays, distinguished as\r\n_alpha_, _beta_, and _gamma_ rays. Experiments have made it extremely\r\nprobable that the [alpha]-rays are streams of very minute particles,\r\nsomewhat heavier than atoms of hydrogen, moving at the rate of about\r\n18,000 miles per second; and that the [beta]-rays are streams of much\r\nmore minute particles, the mass of each of which is about one\r\none-thousandth of the mass of an atom of hydrogen, moving about ten\r\ntimes more rapidly than the [alpha]-particles, that is, moving at the\r\nrate of about 180,000 miles per second. The [gamma]-rays are probably\r\npulsations of the ether, the medium supposed to fill space. The\r\nemission of [alpha]-rays by radium is accompanied by the production of\r\nthe inert elementary gas, helium; therefore, the [alpha]-rays are, or\r\nquickly change into, rapidly moving particles of helium. The particles\r\nwhich constitute the [beta]-rays carry electric charges; these\r\nelectrified particles, each approximately a thousand times lighter\r\nthan an atom of hydrogen, moving nearly as rapidly as the pulsations\r\nof the ether which we call light, are named _electrons_. The rays from\r\nradium compounds discharge electrified bodies, ionise gases, that is,\r\ncause them to conduct electricity, act on photographic plates, and\r\nproduce profound changes in living organisms.\r\n\r\nThe radium emanation is a gas about 111 times heavier than hydrogen;\r\nto this gas Sir William Ramsay has given the name _niton_. The gas has\r\nbeen condensed to a colourless liquid, and frozen to an opaque solid\r\nwhich glows like a minute arc-light. Radium emanation gives off\r\n[alpha]-particles, that is, very rapidly moving atoms of helium, and\r\ndeposits exceedingly minute quantities of a solid, radio-active\r\nsubstance known as radium A. The change of the emanation into helium\r\nand radium A proceeds fairly rapidly: the half-life period of the\r\nemanation is a little less than four days. This change is attended by\r\nthe liberation of much energy.\r\n\r\nThe only satisfactory mental picture which the facts allow us to form,\r\nat present, of the emission of [beta]-rays from radium compounds is\r\nthat which represents these rays as streams of electrons, that is,\r\nparticles, each about a thousand times lighter than an atom of\r\nhydrogen, each carrying an electric charge, and moving at the rate of\r\nabout 180,000 miles per second, that is, nearly as rapidly as light.\r\nWhen an electric discharge is passed from a plate of metal, arranged\r\nas the kathode, to a metallic wire arranged as the anode, both sealed\r\nthrough the walls of a glass tube or bulb from which almost the whole\r\nof the air has been extracted, rays proceed from the kathode, in a\r\ndirection at right angles thereto, and, striking the glass in the\r\nneighbourhood of the anode, produce a green phosphorescence. Facts\r\nhave been gradually accumulated which force us to think of these\r\n_kathode rays_ as streams of very rapidly moving electrons, that is,\r\nas streams of extraordinarily minute electrically charged particles\r\nidentical with the particles which form the [beta]-rays emitted by\r\ncompounds of radium.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of radio-activity, and also the phenomena of the kathode\r\nrays, have obliged us to refine our machinery of minute particles by\r\nincluding therein particles at least a thousand times lighter than\r\natoms of hydrogen. The term _electron_ was suggested, a good many\r\nyears ago, by Dr Johnstone Stoney, for the unit charge of electricity\r\nwhich is carried by an atom of hydrogen when hydrogen atoms move in a\r\nliquid or gas under the directing influence of the electric current.\r\nSome chemists speak of the electrons, which are the [beta]-rays from\r\nradium, and the kathode rays produced in almost vacuous tubes, as\r\nnon-material particles of electricity. Non-material means devoid of\r\nmass. The method by which approximate determinations have been made of\r\nthe charges on electrons consists in measuring the ratio between the\r\ncharges and the masses of these particles. If the results of the\r\ndeterminations are accepted, electrons are not devoid of mass.\r\nElectrons must be thought of as material particles differing from\r\nother minute material particles in the extraordinary smallness of\r\ntheir masses, in the identity of their properties, including their\r\nmass, in their always carrying electric charges, and in the vast\r\nvelocity of their motion. We must think of an electron either as a\r\nunit charge of electricity one property of which is its minute mass,\r\nor as a material particle having an extremely small mass and carrying\r\na unit charge of electricity: the two mental pictures are almost, if\r\nnot quite, identical.\r\n\r\nElectrons are produced by sending an electric discharge through a\r\nglass bulb containing a minute quantity of air or other gas, using\r\nmetallic plates or wires as kathode and anode. Experiments have shown\r\nthat the electrons are identical in all their properties, whatever\r\nmetal is used to form the kathode and anode, and of whatever gas there\r\nis a minute quantity in the bulb. The conclusion must be drawn that\r\nidentical electrons are constituents of, or are produced from, very\r\ndifferent kinds of chemical elements. As the facts about kathode rays,\r\nand the facts of radio-activity are (at present) inexplicable except\r\non the supposition that these phenomena are exhibited by particles of\r\nextraordinary minuteness, and as the smallest particles with which\r\nchemists are concerned in their everyday work are the atoms of the\r\nelements, we seem obliged to think of many kinds of atoms as\r\nstructures, not as homogeneous bodies. We seem obliged to think of\r\natoms as very minute material particles, which either normally are, or\r\nunder definite conditions may be, associated with electrically charged\r\nparticles very much lighter than themselves, all of which are\r\nidentical, whatever be the atoms with which they are associated or\r\nfrom which they are produced.\r\n\r\nIn their study of different kinds of matter, chemists have found it\r\nvery helpful to place in one class those substances which they have\r\nnot been able to separate into unlike parts. They have distinguished\r\nthis class of substances from other substances, and have named them\r\n_elements_. The expression _chemical elements_ is merely a summary of\r\ncertain observed facts. For many centuries chemists have worked with a\r\nconceptual machinery based on the notion that matter has a grained\r\nstructure. For more than a hundred years they have been accustomed to\r\nthink of atoms as the ultimate particles with which they have had to\r\ndeal. Working with this order-producing instrument, they have regarded\r\nthe properties of elements as properties of the atoms, or of groups of\r\na few of the atoms, of these substances. That they might think clearly\r\nand suggestively about the properties of elements, and connect these\r\nwith other chemical facts, they have translated the language of\r\nsense-perceptions into the language of thought, and, for _properties\r\nof those substances which have not been decomposed_, have used the\r\nmore fertile expression _atomic properties_. When a chemist thinks of\r\nan atom, he thinks of the minutest particle of one of the substances\r\nwhich have the class-mark _have-not-been-decomposed_, and the\r\nclass-name _element_. The chemist does not call these substances\r\nelements because he has been forced to regard the minute particles of\r\nthem as undivided, much less because he thinks of these particles as\r\nindivisible; his mental picture of their structure as an atomic\r\nstructure formed itself from the fact that they had not been\r\ndecomposed. The formation of the class _element_ followed necessarily\r\nfrom observed facts, and has been justified by the usefulness of it as\r\nan instrument for forwarding accurate knowledge. The conception of the\r\nelementary atom as a particle which had not been decomposed followed\r\nfrom many observed facts besides those concerning elements, and has\r\nbeen justified by the usefulness of it as an instrument for forwarding\r\naccurate knowledge. Investigations proved radio-activity to be a\r\nproperty of the very minute particles of certain substances, and each\r\nradio-active substance to have characteristic properties, among which\r\nwere certain of those that belong to elements, and to some extent are\r\ncharacteristic of elements. Evidently, the simplest way for a chemist\r\nto think about radio-activity was to think of it as an atomic\r\nproperty; hence, as atomic properties had always been regarded, in the\r\nlast analysis, as properties of elements, it was natural to place the\r\nradio-active substances in the class _elements_, provided that one\r\nforgot for the time that these substances have not the class-mark\r\n_have-not-been-decomposed_.\r\n\r\nAs the facts of radio-activity led to the conclusion that some of the\r\nminute particles of radio-active substances are constantly\r\ndisintegrating, and as these substances had been labelled _elements_,\r\nit seemed probable, or at least possible, that the other bodies which\r\nchemists have long called elements are not true elements, but are\r\nmerely more stable collocations of particles than the substances which\r\nare classed as compounds. As compounds can be changed into certain\r\nother compounds, although not into any other compounds, a way seemed\r\nto be opening which might lead to the transformation of some elements\r\ninto some other elements.\r\n\r\nThe probability that one element might be changed into another was\r\nincreased by the demonstration of the connexions between uranium and\r\nradium. The metal uranium has been classed with the elements since it\r\nwas isolated in 1840. In 1896, Becquerel found that compounds of\r\nuranium, and also the metal itself, are radio-active. In the light of\r\nwhat is now known about radio-activity, it is necessary to suppose\r\nthat some of the minute particles of uranium emit particles lighter\r\nthan themselves, and change into some substance, or substances,\r\ndifferent from uranium; in other words, it is necessary to suppose\r\nthat some particles of uranium are spontaneously disintegrating.\r\nThis supposition is confirmed by the fact, experimentally proved,\r\nthat uranium emits [alpha]-rays, that is, atoms of helium, and\r\nproduces a substance known as uranium X. Uranium X is itself\r\nradio-active; it emits [beta]-rays, that is, it gives off electrons.\r\nInasmuch as all minerals which contain compounds of uranium contain\r\ncompounds of radium also, it is probable that radium is one of the\r\ndisintegration-products of uranium. The rate of decay of radium may be\r\nroughly expressed by saying that, if a quantity of radium were kept\r\nfor ten thousand years, only about one per cent. of the original\r\nquantity would then remain unchanged. Even if it were assumed that at\r\na remote time the earth's crust contained considerable quantities of\r\nradium compounds, it is certain that they would have completely\r\ndisappeared long ago, had not compounds of radium been reproduced from\r\nother materials. Again, the most likely hypothesis is that compounds\r\nof radium are being produced from compounds of uranium.\r\n\r\nUranium is a substance which, after being rightly classed with the\r\nelements for more than half a century, because it had not been\r\nseparated into unlike parts, must now be classed with the radium-like\r\nsubstances which disintegrate spontaneously, although it differs from\r\nother radio-active substances in that its rate of change is almost\r\ninfinitively slower than that of any of them, except thorium.[12]\r\nThorium, a very rare metal, is the second of the seventy-five or\r\neighty elements known when radio-activity was discovered, which has\r\nbeen found to undergo spontaneous disintegration with the emission of\r\nrays. The rate of change of thorium is considerably slower than that\r\nof uranium.[13] None of the other substances placed in the class of\r\nelements is radio-active.\r\n\r\n   [12] The life-period of uranium is probably about eight\r\n   thousand million years.\r\n\r\n   [13] The life-period of thorium is possibly about forty\r\n   thousand million years.\r\n\r\nOn p. 192 I said, that when the radio-active substances had been\r\nlabelled _elements_, the facts of radio-activity led some chemists to\r\nthe conclusion that the other bodies which had for long been called by\r\nthis class-name, or at any rate some of these bodies, are perhaps not\r\ntrue elements, but are merely more stable collocations of particles\r\nthan the substances called compounds. It seems to me that this\r\nreasoning rests on an unscientific use of the term _element_; it rests\r\non giving to that class-name the meaning, _substances asserted to be\r\nundecomposable_. A line of demarcation is drawn between _elements_,\r\nmeaning thereby forms of matter said to be undecomposable but probably\r\ncapable of separation into unlike parts, and _true elements_, meaning\r\nthereby groups of identical undecomposable particles. If one names the\r\nradio-active substances _elements_, one is placing in this class\r\nsubstances which are specially characterised by a property the direct\r\nopposite of that the possession of which by other substances was the\r\nreason for the formation of the class. To do this may be ingenious; it\r\nis certainly not scientific.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Lavoisier, since the last decade of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, careful chemists have meant by an element a substance which\r\nhas not been separated into unlike parts, and they have not meant\r\nmore than that. The term _element_ has been used by accurate thinkers\r\nas a useful class-mark which connotes a property--the property of not\r\nhaving been decomposed--common to all substances placed in the class,\r\nand differentiating them from all other substances. Whenever chemists\r\nhave thought of elements as the ultimate kinds of matter with which\r\nthe physical world is constructed--and they have occasionally so\r\nthought and written--they have fallen into quagmires of confusion.\r\n\r\nOf course, the elements may, some day, be separated into unlike parts.\r\nThe facts of radio-activity certainly suggest some kind of inorganic\r\nevolution. Whether the elements are decomposed is to be determined by\r\nexperimental inquiry, remembering always that no number of failures to\r\nsimplify them will justify the assertion that they cannot be\r\nsimplified. Chemistry neither asserts or denies the decomposability of\r\nthe elements. At present, we have to recognise the existence of\r\nextremely small quantities, widely distributed in rocks and waters, of\r\nsome thirty substances, the minute particles of which are constantly\r\nemitting streams of more minute, identical particles that carry with\r\nthem very large quantities of energy, all of which thirty substances\r\nare characterised, and are differentiated from all other classes of\r\nsubstances wherewith chemistry is concerned, by their spontaneous\r\nmutability, and each is characterised by its special rate of change\r\nand by the nature of the products of its mutations. We have now to\r\nthink of the minute particles of two of the seventy-five or eighty\r\nsubstances which until the other day had not been decomposed, and were\r\ntherefore justly called elements, as very slowly emitting streams of\r\nminuter particles and producing characteristic products of their\r\ndisintegration. And we have to think of some eighty substances as\r\nparticular kinds of matter, at present properly called elements,\r\nbecause they are characterised, and differentiated from all other\r\nsubstances, by the fact that none of them has been separated into\r\nunlike parts.\r\n\r\nThe study of radio-activity has introduced into chemistry and physics\r\na new order of minute particles. Dalton made the atom a beacon-light\r\nwhich revealed to chemists paths that led them to wider and more\r\naccurate knowledge. Avogadro illuminated chemical, and also physical,\r\nways by his conception of the molecule as a stable, although\r\nseparable, group of atoms with particular properties different from\r\nthose of the atoms which constituted it. The work of many\r\ninvestigators has made the old paths clearer, and has shown to\r\nchemists and physicists ways they had not seen before, by forcing them\r\nto think of, and to make use of, a third kind of material particles\r\nthat are endowed with the extraordinary property of radio-activity.\r\nDalton often said: \"Thou knowest thou canst not cut an atom\"; but the\r\nfact that he applied the term _atom_ to the small particles of\r\ncompounds proves that he had escaped the danger of logically defining\r\nthe atom, the danger of thinking of it as a particle which never can\r\nbe cut. The molecule of Avogadro has always been a decomposable\r\nparticle. The peculiarity of the new kind of particles, the particles\r\nof radio-active bodies, is, not that they can be separated into unlike\r\nparts by the action of external forces, but that they are constantly\r\nseparating of their own accord into unlike parts, and that their\r\nspontaneous disintegration is accompanied by the production of energy,\r\nthe quantity of which is enormous in comparison with the minuteness of\r\nthe material specks which are the carriers of it.\r\n\r\nThe continued study of the properties of the minute particles of\r\nradio-active substances--a new name is needed for those most mutable\r\nof material grains--must lead to discoveries of great moment for\r\nchemistry and physics. That study has already thrown much light on the\r\nphenomena of electric conductivity; it has given us the electron, a\r\nparticle at least a thousand times lighter than an atom of hydrogen;\r\nit has shown us that identical electrons are given off by, or are\r\nseparated from, different kinds of elementary atoms, under definable\r\nconditions; it has revealed unlooked-for sources of energy; it has\r\nopened, and begun the elucidation of, a new department of physical\r\nscience; it has suggested a new way of attacking the old problem of\r\nthe alchemists, the problem of the transmutation of the elements.\r\n\r\nThe minute particles of two of the substances for many years classed\r\nas elements give off electrons; uranium and thorium are radio-active.\r\nElectrons are produced by sending an electric discharge through very\r\nsmall traces of different gases, using electrodes of different metals.\r\nElectrons are also produced by exposing various metals to the action\r\nof ultra-violet light, and by raising the temperature of various\r\nmetals to incandescence. Electrons are always identical, whatever be\r\ntheir source. Three questions suggest themselves. Can the atoms of all\r\nthe elements be caused to give off electrons? Are electrons normal\r\nconstituents of all elementary atoms? Are elementary atoms\r\ncollocations of electrons? These questions are included in the\r\ndemand--Is it possible \"to imagine a model which has in it the\r\npotentiality of explaining\" radio-activity and other allied phenomena,\r\nas well as all other chemical and physical properties of elements and\r\ncompounds? These questions are answerable by experimental\r\ninvestigation, and only by experimental investigation. If experimental\r\ninquiry leads to affirmative answers to the questions, we shall have\r\nto think of atoms as structures of particles much lighter than\r\nthemselves; we shall have to think of the atoms of all kinds of\r\nsubstances, however much the substances differ chemically and\r\nphysically, as collocations of identical particles; we shall have to\r\nthink of the properties of atoms as conditioned, in our final\r\nanalysis, by the number and the arrangement of their constitutive\r\nelectrons. Now, if a large probability were established in favour of\r\nthe view that different atoms are collocations of different numbers of\r\nidentical particles, or of equal numbers of differently arranged\r\nidentical particles, we should have a guide which might lead to\r\nmethods whereby one collocation of particles could be formed from\r\nanother collocation of the same particles, a guide which might lead\r\nto methods whereby one element could be transformed into another\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nTo attempt \"to imagine a model which has in it the potentiality of\r\nexplaining\" radio-activity, the production of kathode rays, and the\r\nother chemical and physical properties of elements and compounds,\r\nmight indeed seem to be a hopeless undertaking. A beginning has been\r\nmade in the mental construction of such a model by Professor Sir J.J.\r\nThomson. To attempt a description of his reasoning and his results is\r\nbeyond the scope of this book.[14]\r\n\r\n   [14] The subject is discussed in Sir J.J. Thomson's\r\n   _Electricity and Matter_.\r\n\r\nThe facts that the emanation from radium compounds spontaneously gives\r\noff very large quantities of energy, and that the emanation can easily\r\nbe brought into contact with substances on which it is desired to do\r\nwork, suggested to Sir William Ramsay that the transformation of\r\ncompounds of one element into compounds of another element might\r\npossibly be effected by enclosing a solution of a compound along with\r\nradium emanation in a sealed tube, and leaving the arrangement to\r\nitself. Under these conditions, the molecules of the compound would be\r\nconstantly bombarded by a vast number of electrons shot forth at\r\nenormous velocities from the emanation. The notion was that the\r\nmolecules of the compound would break down under the bombardment, and\r\nthat the atoms so produced might be knocked into simpler groups of\r\nparticles--in other words, changed into other atoms--by the terrific,\r\nsilent shocks of the electrons fired at them incessantly by the\r\ndisintegrating emanation. Sir William Ramsay regards his experimental\r\nresults as establishing a large probability in favour of the assertion\r\nthat compounds of copper were transformed into compounds of lithium\r\nand sodium, and compounds of thorium, of cerium, and of certain other\r\nrare metals, into compounds of carbon. The experimental evidence in\r\nfavour of this statement has not been accepted by chemists as\r\nconclusive. A way has, however, been opened which may lead to\r\ndiscoveries of great moment.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the transformation of one element into another\r\nelement or into other elements has been accomplished. Let us suppose\r\nthat the conception of elementary atoms as very stable arrangements of\r\nmany identical particles, from about a thousand to about a quarter of\r\na million times lighter than the atoms, has been justified by crucial\r\nexperiments. Let us suppose that the conception of the minute grains\r\nof radio-active substances as particular but constantly changing\r\narrangements of the same identical particles, stable groups of which\r\nare the atoms of the elements, has been firmly established. One result\r\nof the establishment of the electronic conception of atomic structure\r\nwould be an increase of our wonder at the complexity of nature's ways,\r\nand an increase of our wonder that it should be possible to substitute\r\na simple, almost rigid, mechanical machinery for the ever-changing\r\nflow of experience, and, by the use of that mental mechanism, not\r\nonly to explain very many phenomena of vast complexity, but also to\r\npredict occurrences of similar entanglement and to verify these\r\npredictions.\r\n\r\nThe results which have been obtained in the examination of\r\nradio-activity, of kathode rays, of spectra at different temperatures,\r\nand of phenomena allied to these, bring again into prominence the\r\nancient problem of the structure of what we call matter. Is matter\r\nfundamentally homogeneous or heterogeneous? Chemistry studies the\r\nrelations between the changes of composition and the changes of\r\nproperties which happen simultaneously in material systems. The\r\nburning fire of wood, coal, or gas; the preparation of food to excite\r\nand to satisfy the appetite; the change of minerals into the iron,\r\nsteel, copper, brass, lead, tin, lighting burning and lubricating\r\noils, dye-stuffs and drugs of commerce; the change of the skins, wool,\r\nand hair of animals, and of the seeds and fibres of plants, into\r\nclothing for human beings; the manufacture from rags, grass, or wood\r\nof a material fitted to receive and to preserve the symbols of human\r\nhopes, fears, aspirations, love and hate, pity and aversion; the\r\nstrange and most delicate processes which, happening without\r\ncessation, in plants and animals and men, maintain that balanced\r\nequilibrium which we call life; and, when the silver cord is being\r\nloosed and the bowl broken at the cistern, the awful changes which\r\nherald the approach of death; not only the growing grass in midsummer\r\nmeadows, not only the coming of autumn \"in dyed garments, travelling\r\nin the glory of his apparel,\" but also the opening buds, the pleasant\r\nscents, the tender colours which stir our hearts in \"the spring time,\r\nthe only pretty ring time, when birds do sing, ding-a--dong-ding\":\r\nthese, and a thousand other changes have all their aspects which it is\r\nthe business of the chemist to investigate. Confronted with so vast a\r\nmultitude of never-ceasing changes, and bidden to find order there, if\r\nhe can--bidden, rather compelled by that imperious command which\r\nforces the human mind to seek unity in variety, and, if need be, to\r\ncreate a cosmos from a chaos; no wonder that the early chemists jumped\r\nat the notion that there must be, that there is, some _One Thing_,\r\nsome _Universal Essence_, which binds into an orderly whole the\r\nperplexing phenomena of nature, some _Water of Paradise_ which is for\r\nthe healing of all disorder, some \"Well at the World's End,\" a draught\r\nwhereof shall bring peace and calm security.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists set forth on the quest. Their quest was barren. They\r\nmade the great mistake of fashioning _The One Thing, The Essence, The\r\nWater of Paradise_, from their own imaginings of what nature ought to\r\nbe. In their own likeness they created their goal, and the road to it.\r\nIf we are to understand nature, they cried, her ways must be simple;\r\ntherefore, her ways are simple. Chemists are people of a humbler\r\nheart. Their reward has been greater than the alchemists dreamed. By\r\nselecting a few instances of material changes, and studying these with\r\npainful care, they have gradually elaborated a general conception of\r\nall those transformations wherein substances are produced unlike those\r\nby the interaction of which they are formed. That general conception\r\nis now both widening and becoming more definite. To-day, chemists see\r\na way opening before them which they reasonably hope will lead them to\r\na finer, a more far-reaching, a more suggestive, at once a more\r\ncomplex and a simpler conception of material changes than any of those\r\nwhich have guided them in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAir, ancient views regarding, 129.\r\n\r\n---- views of Mayow and Rey regarding,
